The food was promptly brought to our table by one of the servers as we were just about settling down after grabbing a can of soda and a bottle of water. \n\nIt is important to note that I set a high bar for an Indian/Pakistani place serving Chicken Karahi and in my heart, I really wanted this place to go above and beyond. The people behind the counter were sweet and the smell of the food was on point. \n\nIf I'm being completely honest about it, the Chicken Karahi looked bang average when it arrived at our table and I was a little unsure of how it was going to taste. That along with the fact that it was missing the bell peppers we were promised on the menu, made me feel a little let down. \n\nAll of my doubts vanished once I tasted the food and it was only after I had gobbled up my meal that I looked up and said another word.

Fresher flavors and spicier spices that all highlight the veggies within :). \n\nFOOD: You can't go wrong here. \n- Saag Paneer (always)--Most saag paneer dishes I consume are drowned in cream to the point of tasting like 1) cream, 2) spice, and 3) something vaguely green. What I love about the saag here is that the fresh notes of spinach really shine through without compromising on spice at all--in fact, I think there's a more pronounced blend in Lahore's saag than in others' :). It's a healthy spice at medium. \n\n- Paneer Tikka Masala--Sometimes I forget tikka and other Pakistani/Indian curries have a tomato base--this dish is a great way to remember. Sweet, nutty, and rich, this is a very satisfying dish. \n\n- Butter naan--I love that these are round :). They are on the puffier/fluffier side of naan I've had--perhaps a product of the real deal tandoor you can see behind the counter! It's filling, replete with air bubbles, and has a lovely texture--crisp on the bottom, soft on the top, and moist in the middle. \n\n- Chicken and cheese stuffed naan--there is a lot going on here in a naan that could be a meal itself. The chicken came out a little dry, but was addressed by dipping in curry. This, my friend told me, is something that you can usually only find in Pakistan. Order it for the novelty or because you are Hulk-level hungry.\n\n- Tandoori chicken--by far what most people order here. It's delicious and I appreciate the variation in portion sizes for different hunger levels.\n\n- Mango lassi--my FAVORITE mango lassi ever. It balances exactly to my tastes the mango flavor without being too sweet and tanginess of the yogurt. It's thick, which I love. I perceive many others are blended with ice to near juice texture. Last time I went, they were closer to room temp than ice cold, which is perfect for me. \n\nSERVICE: Very friendly at the front counter! Order up front--if for here, pay at the end. Food is brought out to you. \n\nIf you want it to go or to your door, Lahore Karahi is on many delivery platforms. Though I heard the front desk fellow tell someone on the phone they \"don't do delivery,\" I've ordered delivery from Eat24 here many times. \n\nAMBIANCE: Very divey--chairs on a tiled floor in a one room joint that can be dusty in some nooks. It can quickly grow warm in the summer, when the heat of the tandoor fills the restaurant. \n\nA note for the squeamish: I saw a cockroach here once, which completely scared off my friend's appetite. When I pointed out that we had just seen a cockroach to the guy up front, he said, \"Yep. It's a problem.\" \n\nI am undeterred because the food is too delicious for me to stay away. This, plus I believe the heat of cooking would eliminate any germs, and Lahore scores highest in my book for least likely for hair to end up in my food (it's never happened here; it's happened at least once from any other takeout I've ordered more than 3 times in the Bay).", "author": "Helen W."}

I might be more accustomed to more savory Indian meals but I have no gauge of how authentic anything is so I sort of just compare places to each other.\n\nThings I noted that were different from other Indian places I've been to:\n\n-the garlic naan was very tough to rip, not fluffy, more fried garlic than fresh garlic, and somewhat bland (tasted mostly like pita)\n-the saag paneer was very watery and not heavily spiced, which made it seem pretty clean\n-the tiki masala wasn't very creamy and the meat was a little dry\n-the mango lassi was very mango-y and yogurt-y--almost as if they used real mangos \n-the lamb samosa had a very thin and somewhat-tough skin so i wasn't dropping crumbs with every bite (thank goodness), and the filling was very well-spiced albeit a little dry. \n\nAlso when you come in, you order up front, seat yourself (they have water/utensils you fetch for yourself), and then pay when you're done.

We randomly found this place on Amazon Prime Now when we were craving some Indian food, and after sifting through a dozen or so Indian restaurants we decided to go with Lahore Karahi.  Since then, we've tried other Indian restaurants that deliver to us, but none of them compare to Lahore Karahi!  \n\nEvery time we order from here, we get the chicken tikki masala and the butter chicken.  Both dishes are always on point, and their \"extra spicy\" is genuinely spicy!  At some other Indian restaurants, their extra spicy would be mild for me.  Their naans are always on point too, and we especially love the garlic naan.  Tons of garlic flavor and cooked just perfectly.  I would skip the cheese naan as there is barely any cheese in it.  Once in a while, we'll order the tandoori chicken, which always comes out moist and super flavorful.", "author": "William L."}

As I stepped inside, nothing immediately threw me off, but I did notice that the kitchen was a bit messy and there were a few open food containers left exposed on random counter top spaces. Realistically though, this probably happens all the time in other restaurants and we just don't see it. At this restaurant, the kitchen area is exposed to the eating area so you see everything. Despite the questionable cleanliness, no one in our group got sick after eating and we all really enjoyed our meal. \n\nMy favorite dish here is the butter chicken. I have been to several Indian restaurants (in the U.S and U.K) and can easily say that this one makes it to the top five. It was packed full of flavor and even had a subtle kick to it. I wish I can make this at home. I recommend it.\n\nWe had a vegan and vegetarian in our group and they both enjoyed their meal.\n\nNote that everything here is self serve. You order at the counter, you pick up your own silverware, and you pour your own water. This makes it cheaper and it would be up to you to leave a tip or not.

The saffron rice brought a light tang and really came packed with flavor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH!\n\n-Lamb Korma for $10.99. Lamb cooked in creamy gravy with herbs and spices. I LOVED this dish as well. The creamy gravy was made at a nice thick consistency. The lamb was also cooked well and super tender. Drizzle this dish over rice and you've got the best combination. OH-EM-GEE!\n\nListen, this place is one of the best Indian joints I've tried in a long time. You need to get your butt up the hill on Leavenworth and try this place out. You will NOT be disappointed.

He then went and made me some tikka sauce on the house! Really [really really really really really] good! I'm no expert on Indian food but this place makes my top 3. \n\nCome here if you have time to spare as the food is made to order.

But now, after this year these things will always be just one degree of separation for me.\n\nWe came here for Christmas eve. It was pretty busy around 8pm. You order up front, seat yourself, and pay at the end when you're finished with your meal. \n\nThe unique thing about Lahore Karahi is all the self service which I've never really had experience with. There is unlimited hot chai tea, wine glasses, water jugs in the refrigerator all DIY. I actually kinda liked it, you don't have to wait around for a server for simple requests at this casual dining spot. \n\nThe food did take kind of long to come but I think the kitchen is small and everything is so fresh, it takes a bit and it's definitely worth the wait. I suppose don't come when you're in a rush and want to be in and out quickly. \n\nWe started off with an order of samosa. It's REALLY simple. Not too many spices, no peas. This is a very basic samosa that gets the job done. I needed some extra salt. Their tamarind sauce is a bit too watery, but the flavor is still good. The cilantro/mint one was spot on. For the main meal, my partner ordered the chicken boti tikka. This was fantastic -- 4 huge pieces of tender and moist chicken in a beautiful bright red color and sauteed onions with lime on a skillet. It doesn't come with a sauce for dipping if you get naan, so be mindful of that. \n\nI ordered the chicken tikka masala which I really did enjoy, but the flavors are little bit muted compared to a great chicken tikka. Still though, with the naan and gravy I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I have to say the naan at Lahore Karahi is off the charts. I might even go so far as to say this is the one of the best, if not the best naan I've ever had. It was super fresh, sooooo soft and chewy and delicious. They have so many kinds of naan, so next time I going to try one of the different flavors -- sesame naan, cheese naan, aloo paratha, Afghani naan, etc.  \n\nWe will definitely be back even if it's just for the naan.", "author": "Priti K."}

Despite the low food safety score... which didn't scare me away, and it hasn't gotten me sick yet (knock on wood). I love the garlic naan, and I feel like their naan is bigger than what other restaurants give. The butter chicken is also one of the best I've had, mostly due to the tenderness of the chicken. Most chicken curries at other places are dry, so I was surprised that they cooked the chicken so well here! I also get the paneer tikka masala which is delicious, though I think I might like the butter chicken sauce better than the tikka masala (though they only offer paneer tikka masala, not paneer makhani, afaik).\n\nIf you can look past its slightly sketch location and the low food safety score, this is an Indian place you cannot skip!

Both were ehhh. The vegetable pakoras didn't have much flavor, I had to drench it in sauce to make it more edible. Whatever the green sauce they gave us was bomb though. Never seen green sauces in Indian food either. I really liked it though! The tikka masala was lacking flavor too, which is just whaaaaat (?!?!?!) for Indian curry. It tastes slightly bland if that's even possible. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. It was just eh. A 3/5.\n \nBut the reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because THERE WAS A CREATURE CRAWLING ALONG THE WALLS.

While this could be considered on the expensive side, it included ~5 small filets - not a bad deal!\n\n* CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA ($8.99) - 3 STARS:\nI've never been a huge fan of tikka masala because the sauce is too creamy and the chicken is usually too dry. This did not break any stereotypes for me, and the portion of chicken was meager.\n\n* ALOO GHOBI ($7.99) - 4 STARS:\nPretty standard but what makes this dish extra special is that you can order it without the potatoes which to me is such a filler ingredient I don't need to have.\n\n* BINDI MASALA ($7.99) - 4 STARS:\nAgain, pretty standard okra dish but I loved that it was chock full of okra rather than fill ingredients like peas, onions and potatoes.", "author": "Jess C."}

The sauce is slightly spicy, enhances the chicken and goes with Naan awesomely. The chicken is a tiny bit dry but still a lot better than Chutney's. They're cut into bite-sized chunks of chicken breast. It's $8.99 \n\nThe Prawn Tikka Masala is cooked in a creamy tomato sauce. This sauce has awesome consistency - it's less fatty than the butter chicken, there no oily layer on top. The shrimp was still crisp - tasted very nice and fresh. It's really worth the $11.99. \n\nThe Garlic Naan looks cute and perfectly rounded. It's topped with garlic and herbs. This Naan is not too thick and smells nice. It's not too soft and floppy but not too dey either. This was $2.50. \n\nThe Roti is made of whole wheat so it's druer and less fluffy. It's more dry than Naan - but it's healthy. The crisp bread is good to pick up the sauces. I think this was $1.50. \n\nThis place is tidy and bright and the food is flavorful and taste good.

And even at that, it's still not enough for me. I could eat it everyday. This past SF visit, as soon as I returned to my hotel room from dinner, I couldn't help but think: \"Man, i want more. Why did we leave our leftovers? Why, oh why?!\"\n\nSo here's the lowdown. This is legit Pakistani resto (and trust me, I'm a halfsie). It's a true hole-in-the-wall with the best, spiciest, most authentic Pakistani fare ... and to top it off, it's inexpensive (not just by SF standards) and it's BYOB! And no cork fee.\n\nThe reason why their prices are so cheap is the fact that everything is self serve. You seat yourself; you grab your own water, non-alcoholic bevs and plates/cutlery at the setup station; you order at the register; and you pay at the register after dinner. All they do is bring out your food - your delicious-delicious, mouth-watering, food.\n\nEverything is served family style, so share with your table-mates. And since the portions are huge, I rec ordering two less entrees than there are people, especially if you're ordering naan and apps (lamb and veggie samosas are always a hit!) \n\nAll and all, this last company dinner we had seven people and dinner was LESS THAN $100. If you factor in our three bottles of wine and beer that we brought in, along with tip, it was $25 a person ... and there was still plenty of food on the table for at least two more people. Tell me where else in SF can you get a quality sit-down, non-fast food dinner plus 2-3 glasses of wine for 25 bones? No where, except Lahore!\n\nAnd my colleagues would agree. Within the Yelp CM family across the globe, we all pretty much love this place. It's practically tradition to visit Lahore.\n\nBTDubb: They don't take rezzies and the place is small, so anticipate a short wait.

Heck, if SF had a restaurant grading system similar to So. Cal, I won't put my money on an \"A\" level grade.\n\nThe sooner we get over that, the sooner we can learn to appreciate what Lahore is really about...just awesome Indian food cooked and presented just the way it ought to be...dishes made to order by a man passionate about his craft...dishes characterized by lively spices and flavors.  In a nutshell, this place is great.\n\nLahore has the best garlic naan I've had.  It had that nice buttery flavor, and it stayed warm and crispy throughout the meal.  The garlic was there but was not obnoxious.  Quite fantastic, really.  The Matar Paneer was also unbelievably good, with the perfect level of creaminess and spice, certainly the kind of dish that will make you use the naan to wipe off every remaining drop.\n\nI was actually at five stars until the chicken vindaloo came.  I'll be brief because the shortcomings are not that big of a deal, but suffice it to say that the chicken vindaloo left more to be desired.  Perhaps Chef Haider inadvertently squeezed one too many lemons, but it crossed the line between tangy and sour, plus it only had three small pieces of chicken.  The side order of bamati rice was also nothing special.\n\nAlso, the tap water was a little cloudy, so I suggest opting for canned soda or lassi.  The water had a subtle coconut flavor, and we couldn't figure out if it was meant to be that way or if the flavor was a remnant of a previous drink order.  \n\nOkay, the water thing was very disappointing.  Other than that, the hits were big and the misses were minor.  It's clear that Lahore is a quality establishment, worthy of all the hype of being considered as one of the best Indian restaurants in SF.  There was even a lady from the New York Times snapping pictures of the food from every conceivable angle.  Apparently, she's featuring this place in an upcoming food review.

The new owner is longer present at the restaurant. Looks like the new owner promoted the kitchen aid to the master chef. This is a serious mistake and is the reason why I must downgrade my review to one star (I gave this place three stars after the new owner took over, after he bought the place from the previous owner). \n\nI ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and Saag Paneer with an order of garlic naan and basmati rice. These are staples that are pretty hard to mess up, but this new \"master\" chef did. Lamb vindaloo had some heavy oil, filled with a invasive chili powder that gave me almost instant heart burn. I love spicy foods and its pretty rare to trigger that response inside me, but I think its the liberal use of cooking oil that is causing this reaction. Not only that, but there's only three pieces of lamb in my dish. Each lamb piece is the size of my pinky finger. \n\nThe Saag Paneer was bland yet spicy at the same time, an odd combination that left the same bad taste in my mouth as trickle-down economics. Saag Paneer is supposed to have this explosive, orgasmically spiced creamy flavor mixed with the mild subtlety of cheese. This Saag Paneer lacked most of those qualities. \n\nSome may seriously disagree with my review, but that's because they're not acquainted with a) the Old Lahore or b) good Indian/Pakistani food. This new chef is merely throwing things into a pan without understanding how the ingredients complement each other (so he doesn't know how to control each ingredient). Combined with the expensive dish prices (I paid $22.10 for my above order: yes, that's expensive for this \"hole-in-the-wall\" place), this place lost any respect I had after the new owner took over.", "author": "Peter C."}

I have so many fond memories of this place, it hurts to write this review. \n\nBack then? Late nights after 12-hour conference setups and takedowns at the the Moscone Center -- meeting new friends who I'm still friends with, about a decade after the fact. Back then, the spicy was spicy, the service was friendly, and the food was just amazingly tasty. Sometimes we would just get random freebees I can't even name after sharing a full table of food. Lahore used to have feel more like a Pakistani greasy spoon. It was local. It was in the TL back when tourists didn't feel comfortable entering the TL.\n\nNow? It's sterile... not that I want cockroaches in my food, but I don't want to feel I'm in a hospital cafeteria either. The service is markedly slower (and frankly, more rude -- I felt like I wasn't wanted there, and I'm accommodating when it comes to food service), and the food? With the departure of Guddu, it's just not the same level of flavor, and it's definitely not the same quality of product.\n\nYou can do better. I'm sad to say goodbye to a memory, but I've got to do something to counter all the 5-stars this place had from its glory days.

Bay Area\" that it finally motivated Jamie W. and me to try it finally after all these years. We were expecting a madhouse of chaos, but we must have come after Katrina came through since all we saw were piles of dirty dishes all around. We honestly didn't know whether we should wait for the young waiter to clean it all up or just pitch in with some Palmolive and a pair of Playtex gloves from the Walgreen's down O'Farrell. \n\nWe decided to wait and hoped the waiter would wipe down the table. Alas, Jamie got a stain on his beloved Threadless T-shirt due to leftover curry sauce on the rim of the table, and only my Diet Coke came. Note we both ordered Diet Cokes and only mine came. Not Jamie's, mine. Things were not off to a promising start. However, once the food started coming, all was forgiven. We started with the $3 basket of Vegetable Pakora, tasty and surprisingly light veggie fritters that looked like they came from South Carolina, not South Pakistan (see photo). But the exotic spices came through with each bite. \n\nI ordered the $6.50 Butter Chicken, which consisted of Tandoori chicken pieces bathing in a buttery cream sauce (see photo). Very tender with carrots and spices complementing the flavor. Jamie went for the $7 Lamb Korma, which was just as tender and succulent though a bit hazardous to spoon since the bowl was filled to the brim with the spicy sauce (see photo). We skipped the naan in favor of a plate of Basmati rice to make sure we sop up all the sauces. Genuinely delicious but maybe bring a sponge just in case the waiter doesn't have time to be thorough next time. \n\nFOOD - 4.5 stars...homemade Pakistani dishes done up right and packed with flavor \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...well... \nSERVICE - 4 stars...the attentive young server was everywhere \nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely worthy of a return visit...thanks Liz!", "author": "Ed U."}

Gross.\n\n I asked the cook if he had any chili sauce or something spicy to accommodate the meal. He told me no, but then said he could make up something. He basically took some type of chili powder and mixed it with water creating a paste.

I had heard good things about the restaurant, so I was excited to try it. But, as many things on Yelp, this place was all hype. I've been to practically every Pakistani restaurant in the tandoor-loin, and Lahore Karhai is literally one of the worst. The food was SO BLAND, I question if they are even allowed to call themselves a Pakistani-Indian restaurant. \n\nA friend and I ordered the following: \n- Beef Seekh Kabob: Horrendous. Had absolutely no flavor or seasoning. \n\n- Palak Aloo: Extremely bland, but not terrible. It was probably my favorite dish of the evening, but thats not saying much since everything else was gross. \n\n- Karhai Chicken: When your restaurant has the word KARAHI in it, you'd think you'd want this dish to be your bread and butter, a dish to show off. Sadly, Lahore Karhais karhai chicken was amongst the worst i've ever had. \n\n- Garlic Naan: The naan was legit. I'm a tough critic, but I genuinely enjoyed my garlic naan and for this sole reason I am rating this place TWO not ONE star. \n\nIn conclusion, the food capital of Pakistan, Lahore, would be ashamed to have such a mediocre restaurant named after it. \n\nLahore Karhai, you let this Pakistani girl down. I will probably never come back to eat your food. Next time, i'm not going to cheat on Shalimar or Mela.", "author": "Moniza M."}

I can't say that I know what anything tasted like (except that the aloo saag was heavy on fenugreek and light on aloos) aside from incredibly, stomach-gurgling-ly, pores-on-scalp-opening spicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-12", "description": "I used to have this theory that if you used Yelp correctly, you should never have a 1-star experience. At least here in SF, with so many great options available for any cuisine, there's no excuse to end up at a bad restaurant. Thanks to Lahore, that theory is now busted.\n\nYou see, at the time of this writing, Lahore has a solid 4-star rating with 830 reviews. Pretty safe bet, right? Wrong. So wrong that I'm busting out my first 1-star review just to express my disappointment in the most bizarre dining experience I've had lately.\n\nIt all started when we showed up about an hour before we had to be at a party down the street at Bourbon and Branch. A perfectly generous amount of time, even though it had taken a little while to get served here in the past. The first sign of trouble was when we had to actually take our own order at the counter. Not just give our order at the counter to someone who'd ring it up, but actually write it down on a waiter's pad and deliver it to the chef ourselves (It was so weird that I had to capture photographic proof: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=o03ZwIhEEbKLxffxBmcuUw&select=99knUe5k4ySIbAw864G9Qw). We laughed about how this couldn't be very efficient, but in retrospect I think it was the most efficient thing about the restaurant.\n\nOnce the order was placed we found a seat and waited. And then waited some more. 30 minutes later it seemed weird that not only had we not seen any food come out of the kitchen, but we hadn't seen a server or anyone else come by our table either to let us know what was going on. When we could track down the server and ask what the holdup was, he quickly said our order was coming right up. Slightly placated, we returned to waiting and got distracted by a Bollywood movie playing on TV. This kept our attention long enough to make it through four dance numbers and some google sleuthing to figure out that it was called \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\" and was the highest-grossing Bollywood film in foreign markets when it was released. Obviously this occupied a good chunk of time, and when we finally looked at our watches again it had been a full hour since we ordered.\n\nA normal person would have realized they'd been played and left. Crazed by hunger, I instead set my iPhone's timer for 10 minutes and declared that we'd be leaving if we still hadn't been served when the timer went off (60 minute wait? No big deal. 70 minute wait? Inexcusable). For the next 10 minutes we sat and watched the clock, joking how our food would come out as the timer was buzzing. Then, like magic, our order appeared with 1:18 left on the timer. Instead of any sort of acknowledgement about the wait, the server just dropped our dishes off without a word and disappeared back into the kitchen. Stunning.\n\nIf you are still reading this, I can only assume you are stuck sitting at Lahore Karahi, waiting for your food and reading reviews trying to figure out where you went wrong. To save yourself some grief, may I suggest you get up now and head over to Shalimar, Chutney or Little Delhi? It's not going to get any better here.", "author": "Mark A."}

I guess I've been pretty fortunate so far with where I've been (which is something I'm quite appreciative of).  But then, it's not everyday you see a ROACH while you're eating.  Yeaaaaah....game over.  Thanks for playing.\n\nNow, before you write this review off as a one star just because of a roach...well, you're partially right.  Seeing a roach certainly put this one a one star path, but it's not like I found the rest of the experience that fantastic anyways.  Unlike other Yelpers, I didn't find the food that remarkable the first time I was here a year or two ago, and it really wasn't any different this time around.  \n\nBetween my two friends and I, we ordered the Garlic Naan, Regular Naan, Butter Chicken, Fish Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, and the Saag Paneer.  As a whole, nothing really stood to me as being anything special.  The Fish Tikka Masala was definitely the best of the bunch, as they did a good job with cooking the fish.  Even then though, it didn't strike me as amazing flavor-wise.  Decent, but not great.  And while none of the dishes were bad per se, it's not like you can't find something just as good (or better) elsewhere in the City or the Bay Area.\n\nConsidering the fact that we had to wait almost 40 minutes for our food and that they still forgot our order of Tandoori Chicken, Lahore already wasn't going to be getting anything better than two stars before the roach showed up anyways.  Now, I'm not so naive to think that roaches aren't a problem at other places, including those that I'm actually fond of.  However, there's a BIG difference between suspecting or thinking they might be around, and then actually seeing the damn things on the wall.\n\nIf people want to keep coming back because they think the food is still great despite it all, then by all means.  That just means the lines will be shorter somewhere else.  I just know I won't be back, and I wouldn't even give it a second thought.  The only part that I'll still be thinking about is whether or not it was a good or bad thing that we didn't see the roach until towards the end of our meal.

Alright, here we goes:\n\n+ Bengan bhartha: slightly sweet and creamy, this mashed up eggplant dish was a good complement to all the other more flavorful and spicy dishes.  Goes well with the rice.\n+ Saag gosht: nice, fatty pieces of lamb, in goopy spinach, but not quite as goopalicious as, say, the standard palak paneer that you'd get in places.  The consistency is more like mush, less like goop.  Still good, not too spicy really.\n+ Chicken tikka masala: Excellent. Do get. My favorite dish of the evening.\n+ Tandoori fish: way too much lemon! The fish was tender and nicely cooked, but they really over did it with the lemon.  I would've preferred if they just gave us lemons on the side, so that we could squeeze our preferred amount of acid on each fish.  But yeah, they oversqueezed = no bueno. \n\nEverything is super fresh and cooked to order, unlike the pre-cooked stuff at Naan 'n Curry (though, I do love Naan 'n Curry too...).\n\nThe naan was fine.  Puffy, soft, and just the way I like it.  Regular naan is only $1! \n\nI also tried the mango lassi, which is like, amazing! The chai is free and unlimited, and VERY creamy, and oh did I mention freeeee? :D  Am happy!\n\nAll that food came out to $45 before tip, which is reasonable.  \n\nMy two main issues were that 1) the wait to order and then the wait for your food is kind of long, and 2) the place is...not the cleanest.

It was slightly spicy for me even though we requested \"mild.\"  The chicken could've been more tender but it wasn't exactly dry.\n\n- Garlic Naan: probably the highlight of Karahi's.  It was one of the best naans I've tried--it was crispy, doughy, and 'reeked' of garlic... just the way I like it. Did it go well with the Chicken Tikka Masala? Yes!\n\nThe ambiance is decent; there aren't too many seats available but the service is good. The waiters were quick and very helpful.", "author": "Jenny O."}

Here's the good, the bad and the downright ugly...\n\nFOOD:\nThe food was ok, not great. Veggie samosa average.The food was nicely spiced, but the goat curry my boyfriend had was very runny with a distinct lack of goat, but with an abundance of bones...and vertebrae at that. I had the the eggplant curry, which was decent. Onion kulcha was burnt, and the garlic naan did not look or taste like it was made with fresh ingredients. Also, uhm, don't drink the water, it did not look or taste potable. Felt queasy when we got home, but boyfriend did not seem to experience any ill effects from the food.\n\nRecap - food ok. On a 1-5 scale, maybe a 2.\n\nWAIT:\nBe prepared to wait. It's a small hole in the wall, which has limited staff. On top of that, it seems like only one person was cooking, with three others doing other stuff that was not customer-related. It mostly looked like they were standing around on the back-line, but I could be wrong. Plenty of time to observe what else was going on, as the wait was so long.\n\nAMBIANCE and CUSTOMER SERVICE:\nAmbiance was lacking, but is not usually a deal breaker for me. Although in this case, I could have done without the rolls of toilet paper on top of their drink fridge or the slew of unbussed tables. \n\nSpeaking of which, don't expect anything from the customer service - seat yourself, come up, order at the kitchen/front-end and expect yourself and your needs to be ignored. We were there for an hour with 2 other tables being occupied, and at no point did ANYONE buss any of the empty tables with dirty plates and food still left on them. We did, however, see a customer buss a table by moving the last guests remains to another table and then sit down. Simply unacceptable. \n\nAlso, while we where there, they were restocking their pantry it seems. I really could have done without seeing boxes of okra and basmati rice everywhere. I have worked extensively in food service, and if you don't have a back door, you NEVER get deliveries during business hours - the whole point is to focus on your customers, and not on everything else. \n\nCLEANLINESS\nThis is where this place gets some serious dings. Tablecloths with black dirt stains at the edge where they meet the clear plastic table top, broken soap dispenser with watered down soap in the bathroom, bathroom in general not in any great state of cleanliness, \"Order Here\" sign with big grease stain, kitchen visibly dirty from where you sit and plastic water glasses with cracks in them. Not good. \n\nAll in all, this will not be somewhere we will re-visit.", "author": "Elena T."}

I truly apologize to the new owners, who seemed nice enough, but to even pretend that your food is the same as that served up by Guddu is like saying that the Niners and the Raiders are basically the same team.  The food was nowhere close to the same.  \n\nWhere to start.  The saag paneer (one of my favorites by Guddu) was a bit more leafy, not pureed as Guddu's was.  But even more challenging was the lack of flavor to the saag.  This seemed to be the trend in the dishes me and my fiancee had tonight.  The karahi chicken was a tad dry and was definitely short on the flavors of before.  The lamb vindaloo was lacking in tenderness as well as quantity of meat.  Finally, the naan was just in a completely different league.  The stuff we had tonight was a lot spongier than that served up by Guddu.  \n\nI would like to say sorry to the new owners for immediately reviewing rather than wait until they find their legs.  However, tonight's food was such a drastic change from before that I felt it necessary to warn people who might be looking to see if the new ownership is close to recapturing Guddu's flavors.  They're not.  I gave The New Lahore Karahi  three stars rather than two simply because I don't know if it's really all that bad of food.  It just isn't as good as Guddu's.\n\nFinally Guddu, if you are sitting there reading this right now just know that I was very lucky to eat your food.  Just last month I tried you fish for the first time at your insistence and I am forever grateful that I did.  You have a gift and I hope one day you will be ready to share it again with us.

Its faults are few, none of which have anything to do with the food. \n\nI arrived for lunch just after noon. The place was small and deserted, which generally is not a good sign during prime lunch time.  Not to worry, I settled in and ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, Basmati Rice and Garlic Naan. After a short wait my food arrived. It all looked great. I found the Vindaloo to be some of the best I have eaten, the lamb was lean and tender, the potatoes perfectly cooked and sauce not a bit greasy and perfect sinus clearing heat. The rice nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. The Garlic Naan to put it simply, the best I have ever eaten. Portions were excellent and would leave most people plenty to take home.  Service was good; however since I was the only person in the place it's hard to judge if there had been a crowd. D\u00e9cor is nothing special but clean. Entrees in $9 range.\n\nIt's a bit tough to find fault with Lahore Karahi, nit picking faults: Not the greatest of neighborhoods, its safe just a bit rundown though not overly so. The serve only canned soft drinks and bottled water.  I saw no beer or wine.  \n\nLahore Karahi Pakistani Indian Cuisine is hard to beat if in the mood for Indian or a cold windy San Francisco day.

Not different as in the selection of food but in the flavors. \n\nI particularly remember the \"Daal Makhani\" which was very authentic in it's flavor but could use a little more softening of the lentils/grams/sprouts (Daal encompasses lentils , sprouts , and chickpeas that it's hard for me to say which is which). If it was a little more \"mushy\" (for lack of a better word, and I agree it does not sound very enticing either --- ok, let's go with \"creamy\") I would surely rate it as the best in the area. \n\nThe other dish they execute way better than *ANY* other Indian restaurant (save Viks in Berkeley) is the Alu Paratha, or the potato stuffed Indian bread. It's still not quite a paratha but more naan/tandoori-roti, yet they executed it really well that I had no cause for complaints. I'd highly recommend it. \n\nI made the mistake of ordering the kebab platter (I think it had beef, chicken, and possibly, lamb kebabs) and realised it was way too much meat for one person. It is best shared by three people. \n\nThe other dishes were standard fare and pretty good but did not jump forth like the aforementioned so I don't remember. \n\nJust be forewarned: your clothes will smell like dinner once you're done due the combination of ventilation that could do better, and the nature of spicy steaming-hot food from the subcontinent. \n\nI had sampled their desserts of Kheer (rice pudding) and Kulfi (frozen spiced reduced milk) and they were on the spot !!!\n\nI'd recommend it.", "author": "Umesh T."}

This time for lunch I tried the chicken kabob (comes w 2) naan and raita... I was a tad disappointed as first of all I ordered at 1230 and food didn't come out until 1246... I had to wolf down my food ASAP... Anyone on a 30 min lunch may try another place.. ( of course I didn't finish all of it either) I won't take off a star for that because it did come out freshly made and piping hot.  Plus I rarely come in for lunch but I do recall now the one other time I came in for lunch that it took about the same time and we were all sweating looking at the clocks.  The kabob had some spice but lacked flavor- almost dry.. It would have been better if they marinated it first. Garlic naan good.. The funny thing too is- I always ask for a smaller raita.. This not just Lahore.  I don't need the big sizes that always go to waste but they always give the big sizes... Cost effectiveness? Oh we'll probably not that much. I'm taking another star off because of the bathroom. Handle was broken- it actually pulled out when I tried to flush! I thought it may not flush because of it but I pushed it back in and it did thank gosh..no toilet paper and soap dispenser was a mess w no top.

The great Indian duel: Lahore vs. Shalimar. \n\nIn my mind, the two are somewhat different in origin and nature, but similar in level of quality and many other attributes. Both are light years beyond anything I get in Portland, and could easily duel with some of my more favorite spots in Seattle. \n\nI finally got in to try Lahore, which is a fairly (but not too) dirty hole in the wall over in the 'loin. The dishes (the ones I care about at least) like curry run in the $7 range, and consist of a decent sized bowl of pungent, earthy curry with meats and in some cases, potatoes and other veggies. Upon my visit I opted for 2 of my lodestar Indian dishes - Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Vindaloo, with some rice and naan, of course. Both ordered medium spicy. \n\nThe meal was delivered quickly (the place was empty when we were in there) and the food came piping hot. The chicken tikka marsala was heavier on the cream/yogurt and lighter on the tomato than usual, and it made for a surprisingly good alternative to my usual favorite. The spice level was perfect for an order of \"medium.\" The flavors were complex and, as indicated above, both pungent and earthy. Delicious. \n\nThe vindaloo was the star of my personal show. The lamb was tender and juicy, and most importantly, plentiful. The curry itself was a nice, dark brown, You can tell the curry base was not over-processed, so random chunks of distinct flavors came bursting from the sauce with each new bite. I'm a big fan of non-homogenized flavors, and this delivered in spades. \n\nThe naan was the only really not-impressive part of our meal, but that said it was still pretty decent naan, and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. At $2.5 for a fairly small portion, I wasn't super stoked on the value. \n\nOverall, 2 curries, one naan, and a rice came to $21.50, which is not a bad deal for a filling dinner for 2 in the City. The lack of ambiance actually adds to my experience at these types of places, but if you're looking for a \"white tablecloth\" place to take a first date, this ain't it. Plus, with the pungent smells of cooking curries and baking tandoori chicken hanging heavy in the air, you and your dinner companion will be stankin' like Indian food all night long. \n\nSo yeah... I was a Shalimar devotee, but my dinner at Lahore has officially split my devotion in tow, and I am torn. Either way, it's a high-class problem to have!", "author": "Don B."}

I think the prices went up too.  \n\nWe ordered fish tikki masala, beef shesh kebap, butter chicken, saag paneer and an eggplant dish (+naan, rice and raita)\n\nThe fish tikki masala was pretty tasty.  The saag paneer was pretty standard.  The eggplant dish was good but I remember it being more flavorful before.  \n\nI was thoroughly disppointed by the butter chicken.  This dish used to be one of my favorites and unfortunately the taste has totally changed.  The chicken is nowhere as succulent as before and the sauce was very average.  Boo!\n\nThe shesh kepab has also lost some of its tastiness from before and in addition to that was on the dry side. \n\nI will probably come back at some point but definitely not as often as before.", "author": "Nhan N."}

He is a super picky eater but when we started dating I wanted to take him to one of my favorite cuisines as he had never had Indian before. I had been here once before and thought it was pretty good so brought him and the best friend here. HE FELL IN LOVE and we come here at least once a month every month. Now he has his coworker and his gf hooked and we just love it. The people here know us now obviously and are always very friendly. Its BYOB and they have awesome butter chicken and tandoori chicken. Oh and garlic naan! There's more but just GO! Its great and super reasonable! You won't be disappointed!", "author": "Sarah S."}

Maybe it's just because my dad cooked curry for us almost every DAMN DAY of my childhood. I learned to grow accustomed to all the spices of the middle east and south asia. Curry, masala, cumin, saffron, cardamom, you name it. My parents grew up eating kulfi, malai, and all that  cardiac health goodness and often crave those sweets.  I've never been a fan of those milky desserts, but I comply.\n\nWe were actually aiming to dine at the Sultan down the street, but we found out that they still hadn't opened. I wonder if they're even going to reopen... ever. Anyways, a quick search on Yelp led us down to Lahore Karahi. Off we went.\n\nOur waiter was very nice. He treated everybody with respect and went out of his way many times just to answer my talkative dad's many questions.\n\nWe ordered a garlic naan, two regular naans, tandoori fish, chicken biriyani, and a mixed grill platter. We all absolutely LOVED everything. The biriyani was amazing. The rice was perfectly cooked, not too soft, not too hard. The fresh aroma of the cilantro blended nicely with the turmeric and other spices. The food definitely wasn't overspiced the way most \"Indian\" restaurants do it. Everything was light with the right amounth of flavor. The garlic naan was delicious as well. The tandoori fish was very tender and fragrant, but it was a bit too sour for my liking. I think I tasted a bit of tamarind as well. It would've been nice in a salad. The lamb and chicken on the mixed grill platter were very tender and juicy. Oh, don't forget to eat the vegetables that accompany the meat! The onions and lettuce that came along with the meat tasted soooo sweet and  good. Mmmm....\n\nThey roll the kulfi right in front of you. In fact, they make everything in front of you since the kitchen is out in the open. My parents enjoyed the kulfi and malai a lot, but I didn't eat it so I can't say much about it. They said it was heavenly.\n\nWe are definitely coming back. This is definitely one of the better Indian places in the city. \n\nGood stuff!", "author": "Colleen W."}

It's just steps away from Naan and Curry (or \"Naan and \"Fury\" as it's sometimes called) and the food is cheaper and much better. I'm not even sure if Naan and Curry can even say they serve halal meat.\n\nThis is one of those places that completely take you by surprise. Looking in, it's nothing special but you're immediately greeted by genuinely friendly faces and a cheerful conversation. The menu is simple, made to order and the restaurant is clean and has a direct view of the open kitchen. \n\nWe ordered a Chicken Vindaloo and Lamb Korma  with two sides of onion kulcha and garlic naan. I asked for the chicken vinadaloo to be extra spicy and they did not disappoint! I felt like standing up on the chair and whistling 'cause it was just that dam good. Eating good Indian food just brings me back to great childhood memories of Chicago and exploring new restaurants on Devon Ave. \n\nThe chicken vindaloo has hardly any oil seeping in the bottom, the sauce didn't separate, their was no trace of fat or mystery parts of chicken and the spices kicked my butt. The lamb korma was tender, almost like cutting through butter and a little gamey which I was all too impressed with but that's why I ordered chicken vindaloo. The naan and kulcha was hot, fluffy and complimented the spices in the vindaloo well. We spoiled our appetite by eating bread before coming to the restaurant so we had to wrap up the food but that didn't stop us from ordering dessert.\n\nWe split a kheer and honest to God, it was the first decent kheer I've ever had in San Francisco during the 2+ years here. I'm a big fan of rice pudding and this was real rice pudding that almost looked green! There was so much pistachio and just enough milk that it was a thick pudding that just exploded with flavor. Usually, Indian restaurants do the opposite where you have to search for the pistachio and it's swimming in a pool of milk but they don't cut corners here and I really do appreciate that. \n\nThe owner was so nice that he even shared his homemade ice cream with it. I have no idea what was in it really but it was thick, hardly melted and had thick pieces of pistachio, mango and all kinds of other bits of yum. It was a difficult task to keep eating after the sensation to pop open a button happened, but I kept pushing onward because genuine warm hospitality like that is hard to come by. \n\nI even noticed the server turned the lights on brighter after taking note of me looking up at all the light bulbs in the center of the restaurant. I don't mind a dim lit place, especially if we're the only table but he took notice and acted on it. I was touched and definitely coming back because of the little touches they make sure happen.", "author": "Jessica K."}

The next day, this got me to thinking.  What if I wasn't able to pay for my meal at Lahore Karahi?  The bill would come, I would pull out my empty pockets and flash a sad face.  Would they send me to the kitchen to wash dishes?\n\nI could only hope.  \n\nAs I sat at my table, I daydreamed about how Guddu the chef would order me to the sink to clean all the pots, pans, plates, etc.  I'd sadly meander back to the sink with my head down, and then (when he wasn't looking) I'd flash a wink & a smile to myself and get to work.  It would be my duty to lick every living morsel, spice, and drip of sauce off of everything.  Since my crime was so dire, I'd have to do this for hours.  \n\nAh, to dream.  But alas, I had cash in hand.  Let's go to the beginning.....\n\nI was staying in the Tenderloin for the weekend, and Lahore Karahi was bookmarked months in advance.  I finally had a free afternoon, so I slushed and slogged through the San Francisco rain to Guddu's Pakistani/Indian dining mecca.  \n\nThe dining area is small.  I patiently waited & shivered at the entry for a few minutes.  I noticed many happy & smile-y faces.  I watched Guddu performing his magic in the kitchen (Yeah, I could do some dish washing/licking in there).    Within seconds I was warmed up.  I was then seated at the table next to the door (it was a little cold there, and I waited a bit, but it made the end result all the more better).\n\nThe server was very apologetic about the wait.  As I waited, I did notice some useful info--they are applying for their liquor license so they can serve beer and wine.  They also received an \"A\" grade for cleanliness.\n\nI went for a standard (Chicken Tikka Masala) and Garlic Naan.  Within a few minutes, the coolness of where I sat was enveloped in steam as my food was brought to me (and my pores were cleared).  \n\nOh the aroma.\n\nI smiled.  I wafted the steamy fragrant aroma to my face with my hands a few times, and let it soak in for a good minute before touching anything.\n\nI then tore a piece of the naan, and placed it on my tongue.  THIS.  WAS. THE.  BEST.  NAAN.  I'VE.  EVER.  HAD!  Oh man, it's been a few weeks, but I still have dreams about the flavor & texture of it.  \n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was more subtle.  The taste didn't hit you quite in the face as the garlic naan.  But y'know, that's what I liked about it.  \n\nIt was like a slow and quiet orchestral piece.  It builds.  The way my taste buds soaked it in was an experience in that all of my little taste buds had a party with every bite.  The crescendo for the party was at the end.  I don't know how food can tell stories, but Guddu's cuisine does it.\n\nI was transported.", "author": "Corey G."}

While at Shalimar I prefer the vegetarian curries, at Lahore Kahari it's the fish that really shines.  On the recommendation of Yelpers I ordered the Tandoori Fish and Bengan Bartha.  \n\nHere I'll have to digress and give you some tips to ease your time here.  The owner is the cook.  The only cook.  So do yourself a favor and do not come here with a group of 10 people during lunch.  You can imagine how long it took to cook dishes for our table plus the other tables with only 1 cook and 2 burners.  If you do come here hungry, the food comes out in the order of 1) biryani, 2) curry and 3) tandoori.  They were nice and gave us dishes of complimentary pappadams.  Also, if the chai tea runs out, they will make more last, after all the food is finishes and the kitchen is quiet.  I'm not complaining; I want my food.  Just FYI.\n\nThe Bengan Bartha was really smooth and smoky.  Not too oily.  I would recommend this.  While I was waiting for my Tandoori Fish I had the opportunity to try the Chicken Biryani (good) and Chicken (korma).  The naan was pretty good but not amazing like I was expecting.  The garlic naan was very garlicky.  At the end of the meal the Tandoori Fish came out.  Wow.  It was totally worth waiting for.  It's unlike any fish dish I've had before.  Fresh (coriander, lime?) and hot (chilies).  I also recommend the Fish Tikka Masala.  Not quite a traditional Tikka Masala sauce but very good.  \n\nI would go back just for the Tandoori Fish.", "author": "Jean K."}

He didn't even looked phased. The smell was captivating.\n\nMy food wasn't quite ready so I watched as he rotated through the pans, stirring and tending, tossing and spicing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-23", "description": "I ate here tonight, and my experience was stupid. It was a stupid experience and it made me angry. This is Yelp, and Yelp is a place where I'm going to talk about my Emotions, and my Emotions after eating at Lahore Karahi were as follows:\n\n(1) Stupid.\n(2) Angry.\n\nBut hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself. First things first. What did I get? Well, I'm glad you asked! I got the tandoori fish. It was delicious. It was spicy and zesty and sizzling and really kind of unique. I don't know where else in the city I'd get tandoori fish. So good work on the tandoori fish, Lahore Karahi! You tandoori'ed the heck out of that fish. That fish had no idea what was coming to it, and what came to it was a tandoor.\n\nBetter still: the menu was generally impressive, and there were a lot of things that I don't normally see on Indian restaurant menus that I wanted to try.\n\nAnd oh man, that naan sure did look good. It looked very good! It looked better than any naan I've ever seen in my life, and let me tell you, I almost certainly have seen a greater-than-average amount of naan in my life. (Provided you take the average across Americans, rather than a worldwide average, in which case it's actually quite possible that I've seen a lower-than-average amount of naan in my life.)\n\nWhich brings me to the \"stupid\" part of my review.\n\nLook, I'm no restauranteur, so I may be talking out of my butt here. But it seems to me that the problem of taking orders and serving customers has been encountered innumerable times throughout the history of the world, in practically every corner of the planet. Surely the top handful of solutions to this problem would have been determined by now.\n\nFor instance, an example methodology might be to have hosts to seat customers and waiters to communicate their orders to the kitchen staff. This is by no means the only possible methodology, nor the most efficient one in every case; it's merely an example of the sort of thing I'm talking about.\n\nFurthermore, the benefits of adopting one of these efficient service methodologies seem clear: increased customer throughput, higher accuracy in fulfilling orders, quicker service, etc. Even if you don't give a care about customer satisfaction, the sheer economic logic of increasing customer throughput seems to demand that you adopt one of these time-tested methodologies.\n\nI mention all this, because as soon as you walk into Lahore Karahi it is apparent that they have closely scrutinized the book of well-established customer service methodologies, stroked their metaphorical chin thoroughly for a few seconds, and then promptly tossed the book over their shoulder with a dismissive, \"Naaaaah, we don't need that.\"\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is how it's supposed to go at Lahore Karahi:\n\n- Walk in, grab your own menu, and seat yourself.\n- Decide on what you want.\n- Walk up to the counter and write down on your ticket what you'd like to order. (!)\n- Hand this ticket to someone working behind the counter and sit back down.\n- After some indeterminate period of time, someone will walk over to you with your food.\n- When you are done eating, you go up to the counter, whereupon someone there will know what you ordered and how much to charge you. You pay and are done.\n\nIt is entirely mysterious how they are supposed to know who you are and what you ordered.\n\nIt is considerably less mysterious once you consider that they appear to get it wrong a lot of the time.\n\nAnd this, THIS is what gets my goat. This is the whole point of this ridiculous essay I've written. Concretely, it's because I ordered a garlic naan and did not get it. Abstractly, it's because I'm an engineer, and it's my job to obsess over things like efficiency and fault-tolerance. This is my trade; it's how my brain works. I simply cannot believe that Lahore Karahi's byzantine order fulfillment methodology is the most effective possible solution. And this fact saddens me, and it hurts me inside.\n\nHeck, if this system were *practical* at the expense of pure efficiency, I would be okay with that. Maybe the most theoretically efficient system is weird and difficult to explain and impossible to get people to participate in. But the thing is: so is Lahore Karahi's system! I mean, who the heck has ever written down their own order on the order ticket? How is that a normal thing at all in California? How is anyone supposed to know how to do this a priori?\n\nSo you get the worst of both worlds: a system that regularly gets people's orders wrong, yet still burdens the customer with a weird learning curve.\n\nAnyway, that it. That's all I've got. Maybe I'm being a jerky jerk McJerkface for writing this idiotically long and ranty review. Maybe I'm just a close-minded dummy who perceives everything different as being weird and terrible. Maybe I just need to relax, chill out, and recognize that sometimes, occasionally, stuff ain't perfect.\n\nOr maybe everyone needs to just recognize that I'm right about everything, all the time, forever.", "author": "Greg P."}

While that term is almost as watered down as the term 'dive bar,' this fits the bill pretty well. Semi-run down, florescent lighting, small quarters and odd linens/place settings. Our table had the classic checkerboard table covers, and none of the plates even came close to matching. In fact, one plate was seemingly smuggled from a Chinese restaurant down the street, as the dish was littered in sinographs. Good stuff!\n\nAs for the food, it was great. We both went with chicken dishes, and while mine was a spicy as Salma Hayek with Tapitio on her naughty bits, causing me to break out in a sweat, it was divine. The lady opted for the vanilla of Indian/Pakistani cuisine (chicken masala), and it was surprisingly delicious. Usually, it's a pretty bland option... but this baby had some kick! While I'm usually not an advocate of the ho-hum menu choices, I'd definitely order that again. We also added some naan and a few drinks... and our bill was only $20!\n\n$20? Are we in San Francisco, or San Bernadino? Not only is that a deal... that's a steal! \n\nTo ask if I'd head back ASAP would be akin to asking me if a three-legged duck swam in a circle. The answer? Uhhh, duh, mother trucker!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

I'm always game for any of it.  But last week when Kathleen M took control of planning a small CM group dinner, she didn't hesitate in bringing us to Lahore - her favorite Indian/Pakistani place on earth!\n\nIf you don't believe me, just ask her... she even named her dog after Lahore's Chicken Tikka Masala!  (Her dog's name is Tikka!)\n\nAnyways, on to the details...  this place is tiny, but they can accommodate a large group - lucky for us, we took over a large table. Kathleen led the way in helping herself to a hot chai tea to start.  I did the same.  Everything on the menu sounded appealing, so we decided to order family style and share... it was great because everyone got to try a little of everything.  Kevin L took charge of the ordering while Kathleen and I threw in our two cents as well.  We had all sorts of dishes from the pakora, tandoori delicacies, chicken tikka masala, korma, prawns, several veggie dishes, biryani, naan, etc... I know it sounds like a lot, but we did have a large group.  \n\nIf you're a fan of Indian / Pakistani food, this place is for sure worth a visit...

I saw Lahore Karahi, and thought wow this place has great reviews we should give it a try. I met up with my best friend during the labor day weekend. It took us awhile to get to this place. I really wanted to impress her, and show her some great eats in San Fran. We got there pretty late, so there wasn't a line. We were seated promptly. It was pretty packed in there. I am pretty sure I only saw 2-3 people that worked in there. \n\nAnyway, I had ordered the Afghani naan, rice, butter chicken and a mango lassi. I was quite disappointed by everything that I had ordered.\nThe Afghani naan was definitely not what I expected. It tasted like a Christmas fruit cake packed inside a different tasting kind of naan. The butter chicken was different. Creamy but in a different way, as in not a good way. \n\nOur meat dishes appeared and we had to wait at least 5 minutes for the rice and the naan. My friend had ordered the tandoori fish, and it was pretty spicy despite asking for it mild. \n\nTo top it off there was a cockroach on the wall. Maybe it was the day.\nRestaurants have off days right? Anyway, not sure if I'd go back. I honestly though Naan 'n Curry was 10 times better. Maybe it's what I ordered.", "author": "Nicole B."}

The quirks and inconsistencies used to be tolerable, even cute, because the service was warm and genuine and the food delectable. I had previously had so many lovely experiences at Lahore Karahi, but that era has sadly ended for this Tenderloin dump. If you click Rating Details next to the business address you'll see the steep decline in recent months that other yelpers have also noted.\n\nUpon each visit, more and more basic elements of a properly run restaurant were taken away - the new 'ordering system' demands that customers grab a pad of paper from the entrance podium and write down their request (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5zKrxtjKK09F_Dwgs5Kxwg?userid=o03ZwIhEEbKLxffxBmcuUw). No number is assigned nor does anyone take the order once you've written it down, so you're really at the mercy of the organization (read: there is none) of the simultaneously frazzled and disinterested servers, who are grossly understaffed. The staff didn't speak to each other and barely acknowledged customers, which was troubling. Owner Guddhu was in the back cooking as usual but seemed completely uninterested in the debacle unfolding in the dining area. \n\n70 minute wait for even a morsel of food - an acknowledgement or apology + overall terrible experience = no return visits.", "author": "Kat F."}

Aside from ordering for delivery using delivery.com and then getting a call that they didnt have  anyone working that could deliver (umm, I literally live across the street) I found the food no short of disgusting.  No joke.  How can food be bland and spicy at the same time?  Well, it can be.  The butter chicken was in a sauce that looked radio-active and was watery.  The roti was the consistency of naan, the rice was plain white rice with a few slivers of carrot and minimal spice, and the Aloo ghobi had no sauce whatsoever.  And there was no one in the restaurant at 7:30 pm.  There ya go.  What a huge (yet predictable) disappointment.  \n\nThe major silver lining to this dark cloud is that thanks to yelp reviewers I now see that Guddu is back in SF and has a new restaurant!

The tandoori fish was a little too spicy for me, but I will have you know that I am the biggest wuss in the world when it comes to spice. It was so freakin good I kept eating it though. Maybe next time I will ask if they can make it non spicy. I wanted to swim in the butter chicken sauce. It was that good. Of course, we ordered naan. Mmm, dip your naan in the sauce. Ignore anyone who glares at you for eating with your hands. \n\nThe waiter recommended the saag paneer, which is spinach and cheese. It was off the hook. Seriously. Dip your naan in that too. Oh man, that's what made it hard for me to breathe. I couldn't stop dipping my naan in it. We also got a side of rice. Yeah, that sounds like a lot of food for two girls, but whatever. Lane Bryant here I come.\n\nSo, the food is 5 stars fer sher. And at SUCH a great price too!!!! AND you can bring your own beer, wine, etc. Now, I know most everyone else who reviewed this placed warned of a wait for a seat and a wait for your food. It was a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was pretty crowded. Honestly, maybe I got really lucky, but I didn't wait at all for a seat and I felt that our food came out at an appropriate pace.  And the waiter was very nice. So 5 stars from me.", "author": "Liz M."}

That said, every food critic and their mothers have given this place glowing reviews, and I can see why. \n\nFirst, the owner/chef is tremendously friendly, and while I'll usually just assume have terrible service if the food is dynamite, the food is great on top of the service. So bonus points there.\n\nSecondly, as mentioned a second ago, the food is awesome. The naan is made fresh right there in front of you, and while there other Pakistani/Indian places nearby with great naan as well, this tastes much more authentic and less greasy. Plus, most of the other restaurants use pre-made naan and just heat it up. Boo on them.\n\nThe lamb korma and tikka masala are wicked good - and spicy! The owner asks up front how hot you like your food, so if you tend to wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares of chili peppers, not to fear.\n\nThe rice has a great blend of spices too, where usually similar restaurants make it plain, and everything is bundled up nicely if you decide to eat on the go.\n\nSide note: we were the last customers in the restaurant to order yesterday, and the owner insisted that I try one of the (delicious) Indian pilsners, on the house. I insisted on paying back, and he doubled-down on the insisting-niceness poker game. Good beer, better because of the service.\n\nAnyways, I could say more, but if you're reading this far into my review, it's a safe bet that your either thoroughly bored with nothing to do and ready and willing to try it out yourself.

It is good not to wash the rice to retain the nutrients but this left a strong unpleasant taste. Also, the best chicken biryani is made with all parts of chicken, the dark meat tastes the best.

Somehow this rice stood out all on its own among great dishes... $2\n\nBottom line... $30 for a meal that would probably cost at least double this much at any other of the so called \"traditional\" indian joints here in the city.

Definitely not for those with zero tolerance for heat, and definitely for those who want a little challenge with their tastebuds. \n\nI usually order the butter chicken EXTRA spicy--it's absolutely amazing. You can see the whole kernels of spices wading in the thick, rich curry sauce and the chicken is always plump, juicy, and abundant. Pair that with the pillowy, naan that's usually basted with oil and can you say SENSORY overload? lol. No, really, another religious experience is had to be found here. \n\nOther no-nonsense delicious picks: tandoori lamb chops, saag paneer, tikka masala, matter paneer....but I'm sure everything will be a hit. I heard through the grapevine that the fish tandoori is to die for.\n\nAnd I love the food so much that even gripes in servicing cant lower my rating.

It's very sad that I didn't review this place before, mostly because I never expected Guddu to sell it and leave.The 'old' Lahore Karahi would easily be 10 out of 10 stars for me.\n\nI have been a ferociously avid Lahore Karahi fan for over 2 years. I'm there pretty much once every week to taste the most authentic and gloriously 'different' Indo-Pak food over n over. The word 'different' is in quotes and is extremely important  because the taste of each n every dish all across the menu is 'different' in the most tastiest way possible than most if not all Indian/Pakistani restaurant all over Bay Area. I have tasted nearly 100% of the menu over 2 years, and being a South Asian I can pretty much bet my life on the fact that the food Guddu(previous owner) cooked cant be replicated by anyone maybe even back home(well at most places!) Being in the States for over 5 years I have tried out this cuisine in over 100 restaurants here. Its pretty much the same ol' tasting staple dishes at 99 of them but Lahore Karahi was the most different,most authentic and the absolute tastiest amongst them all. \n\nFor those of you who don't know, Guddu has sold this place and it is under a new ownership now since past couple of weeks. And from what i have read and seen, the new owner's prime focus is not on the food but on ways to milk most money from different avenues. So it is pretty much safe to say Lahore Karahi is dead, it's history. But again without Guddu the new owner can never achieve that level of taste but he could have at least tried to get closer if his focus was on THE FOOD (damn it! that's what we care for at such hole in the walls , not your fancy lamps and liquor license...BYOB rules!).\nAlso, I totally support the other guy on yelp who said that Yelp needs to be notified so that Ratings and Reviews of Lahore Karahi is nullified and should start from scratch. Otherwise many would question the credibility of Yelp once they go to eat there after checking the current rating of this establishment. Or the owner should just change the name. Also, the new owner better take down the shitload of Awards and Recognitions by leading food reviewers and critics hung on the wall, which Guddu received over the years.\n\nFinally, a shout out to Guddu..Dude I'm not sure why you did what you did but I'm sure you have major reasons. But if you read this someday I would request you to kindly reconsider and open some kind of no-frills food establishment SOON. \nI mean it in the most humblest and grateful of ways- God's purpose for you was to cook your extraordinary food for the ordinary people.

I guess only the owner ever cooks, it's always the same guy, and he must be some kind of genius. I love the chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, karahi chicken, and I'm trying to branch out through the rest of the menu. I try to go every week. It's the best Indian food I've ever had, and it seems to somehow be cheaper than the other Indian restaurants in this neighborhood (there are at least 4 more around here).\n\nThis is a very casual environment, partially self-service. You read the menu at the counter and write your order on one of the pads yourself, then get water and seat yourself. You do not help yourself to beer etc. from the fridge; order that from the waiter, who will eventually stop by your table. When you are done eating your incredibly delicious food, you pay at the counter on the way out. Often it's crowded. It may take a while to get your food if it's busy, and you'll likely have to wait a bit at the counter to pay after eating, but it's well worth it.", "author": "David M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-12", "description": "TL;DR: For now, as long as Zulfiqar is manning the stove, my go to place for solid Punjabi food in the Bay Area. \n\n\nIt might seem that I have universal contempt for veg fare, though that's not really true. The fact of the matter is that, more often than not, veg dishes at many Punjabi joints here well... suck. That the non-veg dishes never quite measure up to my expectations either--well I figure, better to just cut my losses. \n\nWhat's missing exactly? Some kind of weltanschauung--a totality of experience--encompassing the things we love and the art to express it? \n\nDifficult to imagine in a status obsessed, foodie-ville like SF, but opulence and cost have nothing to do with it. Some of my most memorable meals in the subcontinent were for less than a dollar... \n\nFor example, in Old Delhi, Ustad Moinuddin's seekh kababs, made at a tiny street-side charcoal brazier on a congested side lane down from the old haveli of the great Urdu poet Ghalib, are probably the best I've ever had (or will have). While President Clinton can shell out 25 USD for a plate at Bukhara, I'm happy to know that a cycle-rickshaw-wallah can get equal (or better) ones at 4 Rs (10 cents) a pop (this was after a 1 Rs price hike a few years ago). Ustad Moinuddin-ji could easily charge double or triple, but I think that it's not just about money, but about art, along with an obstinate refusal to compromise. \n\n***\n\n\n\nTHE REVIEW:\n\nFor now Lahore Karahi will be my go to place for Punjabi khanna. This is the first place I've been to in the Bay Area where both the non-veg and veg items were done equally well. The food is honest, straightforward--reflecting something of the cook's dedication and skill. Definitely not trying to ingratiate itself to local tastes. While inexpensive, (like nita m. said below) if you choose well, you can get some amazing food.\n\nThe dishes:\n\n* Butter Chicken\n* Palak Paneer\n* Dal Makhani\n* Aloo Paratha\n* Garlic Naan\n* Tandoori Roti\n* Raita\n\nMy measure of a good Punjabi restaurant is how well they make their dal and tandoori rotis. While a North Indian staple, for most restaurants here they are an afterthought. What's more telling about a place is not the specials, but their approach to the basics. To me a flavorless dal, or mediocre tandoori roti reflects a basic lack of skill or respect for the food.  And a shame really, because a good plate of dal accompanied by chawal (rice) or a simple tandoori roti, is to me, basic comfort food.\n\nZulfiqar, the chef and owner in the kitchen, has a touch. The food actually has personality. The tandoori roti was decent, not some kind of dry cracker, and the dal? Flavorful.\n\nButter chicken is really what CTM aspires to be. The latter being merely its pale, poultry shadow. LK's version was a little heavy on the fenugreek and onion for my tastes and lacked a hint of sweetness, but was decent. But what really stood out was the palak paneer. \n\nCompared to other places the flavors were distinct and had depth. The paneer was fried to a golden color with brown edges, giving it a nice firm texture. \n\nAs far as the bread goes, it's okay. The aloo paratha was decent, better than the one that I had at Kabana. The sprinkle of sesame seeds on the garlic naan is a nice touch. Though personally, I prefer my naan to be a little thicker, more pillowy (can't say I've found good naan outside of Old Delhi, honestly). And the fact that they can make tandoori roti already speaks volumes. \n\nThe only thing that kind of sucked was the raita. While they may make their own yogurt at the restaurant--which is great--the raita was way too tart, with a bit of a 'carbonated' taste from being overly fermented.\n\nSans hipsters, all-in-all, LK could be a neighborhood joint in Delhi or Lahore. Like some other reviewers said, if you're missing real Punjabi food, I recommend this place.\n\n\nService was friendly, prompt and good. \n\nCleanliness-wise: during our wait for a table, a roach did double duty as a greeter on a stack of Urdu newspapers by the entrance. Though I'm not really all that squeamish and don't care that much, it does detract from the overall experience.", "author": "Tak N."}

You're not going to just be waiting for a seat, but you're going to be waiting for your food also.  My friends and I came super hungry and it took an hour to get our food.  Not sure if it's because they didn't put in our order, but the fact that they only have one cook (and one guy making the naan) probably didn't help matters.  They also got our order wrong but since we were so hungry, we didn't care and just took whatever dish they made us.\n\nThe butter chicken was easily the favorite dish amongst our table.  Garlic Naan was pretty tasty.  I think the other two dishes we got were vegetarian, the Galoo Gobhi (cauliflower and potato) and Aloo Bengan (eggplant and potato).  They were both bleh to me.  Might be because I'm a carnivore and I'm not happy unless there's meat.  Everything was spicy too.  Two of my friends were dying.\n\nIn the end, I wasn't very impressed.

We decided on Lahore based on the reviews and that it seems reasonably populated with customers each time we have driven by.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nVery basic which is not a problem at all, but I would say that staff were not too friendly; it was quite cold in the restaurant and a lot of people seemed to have been waiting a VERY long time for their food. The tables seemed clean, except the wash rooms were not particularly pleasant.

I decided to return them, only to some attitude from a staff member.... UGH HELLO, we are Indians, do not try and fool us and treat us like tourists who don't know any better.

With Indian on the brain, I resolved to try something new. Lahore has been on my to-do list for a while so I called in my order and enlisted Boy Delivery Service to bring it to my door. FanTAStic idea. \n\nThis place is cheap, cheap, cheap. Think $7 tikka masala and $6 saag paneer. The giant pakoras ($3) are outrageously good, the naan ($1) is delightfully fluffy, and the rice ($2) kicks ass. The Tikka Masala is smoky and spicy and incredibly smooth. I'm not as big a fan of the saag paneer- too sweet, but my dining companion thought it was swell. \n\nThe depth of flavor is a vast improvement over the standard greasy takeaway. It was more like eating great, home-cooked fare than it was like eating heavy Indian food. I'm sincerely considering leveraging this coldover (cold + hangover) for all it's worth and  ordering dinner from them just so I can try the veggie korma I've heard so much about.

Lahore Karahi is one of the smallest restaurants I've ever been in. It fits about 5 or 6 tables that fit 2-4 people each. But it didn't feel cramped. There was complimentary tea by the utensils. It made it homey & I felt welcomed.\n\nI ordered the butter chicken while my friend ordered the chicken tikka masala. She warned me about the spice levels being higher than the usual. So I opted to get mine in a medium instead of hot like she did. My medium butter chicken was SOOO spicy. It was delicious but I must admit, I think I would've enjoyed my meal better with less heat. I was literally sweating I had to take my sweater off. One of the waiters saw & gave us complimentary yogurt to help soften the dish. It really did help! The same waiter also brought us complimentary dessert because he felt bad that I couldn't fully eat my chicken. He really didn't have to because I more than enjoyed my meal!\n\nWith the service being more than helpful, the dishes extremely flavorful, the complimentary treats tasty & delightful, I can honestly say that Lahore Karahi is one of my favorite restaurants!", "author": "Kris B."}

The chicken karahi and fish tandoori were my favs, always fresh and yummy.\n\nRecently, I learned that Lahore Karahi had new owners and Guddu was no longer the chef. It was the only Pakistani restaurant I fully endorsed and somehow I was sure the new owners just wouldn't be able to cut it. Lahore Karahi would now be added to the list of other mediocre Pakistani restaurants in the City.\n\nWell, since I was already there when I learned of this change, I figured I might as well give them a chance and eat something. I expected the worst...no one I knew had eaten here since the new owners and yelp reviews weren't updated yet. I ordered the chef's special Nihari, one of my fav dishes but one that was never on the previous LK menu, as well as the chicken karahi, my LK fav. \n\nThe cons to the new owners are that they're still finding their groove. They don't have service down just yet, they didn't bring us plates or drinks or anything to begin with. The food took a bit longer than expected, especially since most of the tables in the restaurant had already been served, but we could see that they were still trying to move quickly. The food arrived and my primary disappointment was the portion sizes -- smaller than most restaurants. If the owners are reading this, take my word of advice on the service and portions -- you'll need to step it up to restaurant standard, this isn't your dining room at home. My second disappointment was that although the main entrees arrived, there was no naan in sight. We silently waiting a few mins but our food was getting cold and we still had no naan. We politely asked the owner and he rushed an order and sent over naan one by one as soon as he could and we began eating.\n\nNow you must wonder, if I have so many suggestions and disappointments thusfar, then why the 4 stars? Well, because to my dismay and against all expectations, the food was still good. They obviously can't have exactly the same taste as Guddu, every chef has their own way of making food, but the nihari was better than i expected and the chicken karahi flavorful. You've gotta remember, i walked in to this expecting it to be terrible, but I'm still giving them four stars because it's hard learning to run a restaurant and they were clearly trying. Yes, the service could be better, the food could come faster, and the naan could actually make it on time, but I truly think they'll get to that point very soon. They're just experiencing a couple of the pains of working a new business, especially one where everyone has such high expectations.\n\nI know it's hard for a lot of people to look passed the fact that Guddu is gone, but give them a chance. And if you're into beef stew, try the nihari, It was pretty yummy and I think they may just have a couple tricks up their sleeves. Fingers crossed that they work out the kinks.", "author": "Shafaq C."}

LOL... \n\nA couple of my friends and I checked this place out last night and it was a pretty good overall experience, waited only about five to ten minutes for a table and seated right away. From the first look of the place I thought is small, but when we sat down we didn't feel cramp at all. The place isn't the cleanest, but you get the value you pay for and tastier! \n\nThe great thing is that appetizer are price accordingly, they're lower priced than the main dishes; it kind of bugs me that appetizers are priced the same as main dishes at a lot of restaurants nowadays. The same value system goes for the vegetarian dishes, they're slightly cheaper than meat dishes as they should be! : -) \n\nFood: \n* Vegetable Fritters - crispy and tasty! \n* Regular Naan - Not greasy and not doughy thick like Naan-N-Curry! That's good thing! \n* Garlic Naan - Tasty, but you only get one with an order... hmmm \n* Chicken Tikka Marsala - YUM, I always get this at Indian restaurants! Though I did notice that the curry had a sweet onion like taste, than the more common tomato curry base in other Indian places. Still tasty! \n* Lamb Saag - This was goood! The lamb was all meat w/o bones and tender \n* Fish Tandoori - YUMMY! My friend said it was a bit dry. I just thought it could have slightly less cooked, but not dry.... You get like six chucks of fish! A good value compared to other places. \n\nDrinks: \n* Mango Lassi - I think they use fresh mango (not frozen) which is a good thing, but the mango tasted too ripe. So that was bit of a let down. \n\nService: \nConsidering that there's only one cook, one guy making the naan by orders, and one waiter to take orders and serve the food, the service was fast! There is a guy who process the bills and another guy who wash dishes (?). Great friendly service! \n\nGo check this place out! Not the cleanest, but we didn't see and bugs that goodness....Lol", "author": "Fried Rice B."}

By choosing your dishes carefully you can have a five star meal here. You MUST get the palak paneer & garlic naan, and the mango kulfi if you want dessert. The place is a hole in the wall in an unspectacular neighborhood of San Francisco, but is full of well to-do professionals. By hole in the wall I mean I didn't drink out of the water glass. I think it's only the chef & one waiter, so service can be kind of slow but they are very kind. We had: \n\n- Palak Paneer: Probably the best palak paneer I've ever had, my mom has ever had, and my dad has ever had (and between the three of us, that is a lot of palak paneer). This stuff is so fresh! The flavor is amazing, the texture is perfect, and it's a must (order two). \n- Lahore Channa: Their channa masala was ok. It's not the best I've ever had, but rounded out our meal nicely. It's a bit more sweet than most, darker in color, and more 'soft' (the garbanzo beans are more mushed up). Also I thought it tasted a little peanut buttery, which is not a flavor commonly found in channas. \n- Aloo Gobhi: This is a dish I would recommend avoiding. It's really oily & doesn't have very good flavor. \n- Garlic Naan: Lahore puts garlic and a spice rub on their garlic naan, and it's amazing. I saw the cook pat out the dough & stick it into the tandoor fresh to order, so the bread came out super soft and warm. \n- Mango Kulfi: Wow. They make their own homemade, which is amazing on it's own, and it turns out really really good. The flavors of mango, cream, saffron, pistachio, and a little cardamom come together beautifully. \n- Chai Tea: How nice that it's complimentary. It was a nice end to our meal, and way better than Starbucks.", "author": "Jasmine A."}

It's Amritsari style!  Somehow, the fact that they live in the same state as the actual source of this amazing fish style didn't deter them from buying into my suggestion.  And yes, the wanted to try it in San Francisco.  \n\n We were beaten to the entrance by four women who then tragically took the one empty table while we waited. I walked to the nearest liquor store to pick up some beer and upon returning we opened one of the Pilsner's.  \n\nQuickly, there were gasps. The waiter pointed and said \"Nooooo\" as if  I had just stolen his first born child.  I walked over the counter to talk to Gudoo.  I told him I had brought beer from the nearby liquor store several times before and had then drunk it in open view at his fine establishment. I also mentioned how I had specially bought the folks from the old country to try his special fish.  I was confused when he, at first, insisted that I could never have possibly done so but then said he hadn't allowed BYOB for the last three months.  I tried to reason that I didn't know things had changed but he would not let us drink the beer.  We left - sadly - no fish eaten and headed to Pakwan which saved the night with their achar ghost, biryani and beer permissive attitude.   \n\nI still love the fish Gudoo but without a nice beer to wash it down, I must take away a star.

It's not completely a hole in the wall restaurant but it's definitely not fancy or anything either so don't be surprised. Gets very crowded on the weekends and they don't take reservations. \n\nWe went there based off of a review in a magazine. My fianc\u00e9 and brother in law loves, loves, loves hot food and the review they read said this place had it. Super hot that they wouldn't be able to eat. So we made a trip into the city last weekend. \n\nOur order: \n*Vegetable Samosa-It was pretty good, but maybe because we were starving. \n*Naan-It was hot, toasty and yummy...especially dipped in the curry \n*Lahore Karahi Rice-you will definitely need to order this if you're ordering curry \n*Tandoori fish-My fianc\u00e9 ordered this because he saw them make it on Iron Chef and we all must admit, it was a good choice. Probably our favorite dish there. Seasoned just perfectly to give you that nice flavored taste \n*Chicken curry & lamb curry-Flavorable and had a bite to it \n*Mango Lassi drink-Very interesting. They ran out of it but gave us half a glass to try and it was good. Very thick and I don't think I could have finished a full glass \n\nWhat was disappointing was that we had asked for the curry to be extra, super, I can't eat it spicy and it barely even had a bite. We figured they were so busy that they forgot to add some spices to the food. \n\nIt was really crowded and the place isn't big. There was only one waiter and he was running from table to table but he was very apologetic that it was busy so we didn't mind at all.

The very first weekend I moved in I took my mom and brothers here to see if it lived up to it's hype. \n\nIn some ways it certainly did. This is definitely some of the better Indian food I've had. It's a bit of a hole in the wall and you can see all the guys making everything from scratch. If you're in to spice, they put A LOT on. I've had some more mild stuff and this was nowhere near mild. \n\nThe nan was my FAV. I'm a sucker for seasoned bread and theirs is bomb. I also enjoyed the chicken korma and eggplant and potatoes. All good stuff. \n\nIf you're looking for fast, efficient and thoughtful service, this is not the place to come. It was chaos and nobody really seemed to know what they were doing aside from the chef's themselves. The server would come with plates of food, hover over us like he wasn't sure if it was ours and then would actually ask if it was ours. \"umm, how would we know? What is it?\" He didn't know what it was. We also had to wait quite a while for the bill. He kept telling us to go up to the cashier but we wanted to see the bill so we knew what to leave for a tip. We never got it so we just left some $$, went up to the front and waited some more until a chef finally came over to cash us out. We had left entirely too much tip and by then the money had already been taken from the table. \n\nThe poor service won't deter me from coming again bc I know that's not what this place is about. I'm only mentioning it because 1) I believe in fair reviews and 2) People should know that if they're in a huge hurry that this isn't the spot to go. \n\nAnother thing to note is that they don't serve alcohol.

Every table was filled, the kitchen was super busy and there was a line out the door!  Too bad I didn't get to try it.   :*(\n\nLet me paste out the scenario.  It's Saturday night, 12/3 (not really a super special day or holiday) my friend and I came out to the city for dinner prior to a long night of my pre bday celebration with friends.  We were feeling like Indian food so I suggested this place since Yelp was giving it 4 whole stars!  So we are the last people in line when we arrive and I look around... it's a pretty small venue and all the tables were filled.  At that moment I felt a little worried because if all the tables were still filled by the time we ordered - where were we going to eat?  But I quenched that worrying voice in my head and told myself it should be fine.  The couple in front of us handed us a couple of menus (cool - they were really nice).  So we picked out what we were going to order.  About 10 minutes later, we only moved about a foot forward and I'm starting to notice a few things: 1) No one was at the counter taking orders, 2) some of the filled tables had bottles of beer or wine with paper cups.... 3) there was a very long line of receipts on order hanging in front of one of the kitchen workers.  I started to worry a little more.  I didn't want to spend two hours here and completely miss out on my night in the bar with friends.  Still, the glorious smell coming from the kitchen and the authentic looking dishes that were going out made us wait just a little while longer.  Except.....\n\nAnother 10-15 minutes later the couple behind us left, we're still standing in the same spot behind the nice couple who gave us menus and I realize that orders were leaving the kitchen and receipts were getting removed from the hanging line........ but then I notice there's a huge stack of receipts taking place of the ones that were removed!!!!  Holy crap - the realization hits me - about 75% of the people sitting at the tables were STILL waiting for their food!  AND I overheard someone saying that they were allowed to bring in their own wine or beer as they waited.  That explained the wine/beer bottles, paper cups and absence of food!  \n\nThis was the point where I really did start to worry because we now only had an hour to eat before my friends would be at the bar waiting for me.  So I look at my companion, he agrees that we would probably have a very long wait if we stayed and we, with extremely disappointed taste buds, decided to book it outta there.\n\nIt was such a shame we wasted so much time waiting in a line that wasn't moving.  It would have been nice if someone had actually come up to us to let us know there would be an insane long period of wait time.

My Chinese acupuncturist/herbalist probably would have been upset with me but fortunately for both of us I didn't tell her and instead endured the after-effects, left on my own devices.\n\nSpicy, but extremely good, especially with the regular naan (the other naan varieties seem to have a bit too much going on in the flavor department and, to me, detract from the herbal complexity of the tikka masala flavor).\n\nSimilar to my experience at Shalimar, at first I wondered if this restaurant was smoking or non-smoking because of the sheer and visible amount of smoke (which I subsequently realized was coming from the cooking apparatus and food, not from a cig).\n\nAdvice: Expect your clothing to smell strongly of curry for at least 48 hours after your dining experience here, depending on the ventilation in your residence.", "author": "Peter L."}

We also got papadam which you can't really fuck up so won't comment on that but we did ask for some chutney that is suppose to go with the papadam and the server said sure let me get it and he never came back lol We also got some naan.

The kulcha was so tasteful. the onion inside it was sweet and it goes well with both curries.Sesame was fine but the onion kulcha had more impact to us.\n\nBoth curries were certainly delicious and well-spiced. We both love the saag gosht better. The lamb in the curry were so soft and well-flavored. And Karahi Chicken had so much chicken inside it that we were bit surprised of the amount. \n\nThe one thing that we would have hope was that (spice) was not so \"spicy\" enough for us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-20", "description": "Lahore Karahi is as delicious as ever! And, as it seems to be with every delicious downtown eatery, less accessible than ever! Hungry diners, be warned. If you plan on popping in during SF-dinner-rush-hour, (6-8pm) hoping to order-and-eat in a span of two, even three hours... well... lol. Just, lol. \n\nThe problem, my group realized, during our two-plus-hour dining experience, is that there is only one, max two chefs, cooking each order, lovingly, one at a time, be it rush hour or not. So the creamy, stewy daal makhany you ordered? Yeah, it's going to take at least 20 minutes on top of the time it takes Chef Guddu to make everything else. \n\nNot realizing this, my group of four crowded in at 7:30, wrote down our order via the new-fangled self-service process, watched the tab slip into Guddu's pocket, and sat down to wait. And wait. And wait. And then wait some more. When, 45 minutes later, the single waiter hurried out with an urn of hot chai, everyone made a mad beeline for it, hoping to refuel their starved bodies with the sticky, hot concoction of caffeine, milk and sugar. It was gone within 10 minutes, and would not be replenished.\n\nAn hour and 15 minutes later, we went to check on our meal ticket, which was still lying, crinkled and forgotten, in Guddu's pocket. Realizing this, he pulled it out, chuckling apologetically, and placed it in front of all the other meal tickets, which were being arbitrarily assembled and sent out. 30 minutes after that, we flagged down the harried waiter, who asked if we wanted some naan in the meanwhile. We did, and it came out buttery and hot, within five minutes. Having made this awesome discovery (that naan is the only thing that will come out in under five minutes) we called for more, and when we were finally satiated with the puffy rounds of bread, the dishes started coming out, (at this point, past the two hour mark) staggered, one by one. \n\nThe food wafted up to our noses in fragrant curls of steam, and every bite of my chicken tikka masala was tender, silken and spicy. I enjoyed it greatly, despite the fact that I didn't order chicken tikka masala-- I ordered butter chicken, but whatever-- I really didn't want to wait another hour for that to come around. The kabobs were deliciously smoky, and the aloo paratha yielded comforting, giant mouthfuls of spiced potato and fresh cilantro. \n\nAt 9pm, the atmosphere crackled with the polar swing of ravenous irritation and silent content. Merry beer drinkers gave way into irascible finger-tappers. A displeased Indian family dissolved into smiles when their tandoori fish finally made it to their corner table. \n\nAll said, it would probably be easier to know a Pakistani mama who can make similarly delicious food for you, but if that isn't obtainable... Come full so that you can digest your food during the two-hour wait and then be hungry enough to eat again, or just come really late. 9:45pm should do the trick. You'd have to be a real trooper to eat here regularly.\n\nHappy eating!\n\nBottom Line: Epitome of the ridiculous foodie experience.", "author": "Tianyi S."}

So at that time it was dead quiet. However 10-15 minutes into the lunch service the restaurant became more packed and active. Since my friend and I were in a hurry we ordered four dishes: 2 Naans, Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, and my personal favorite Lamb Biryani. The naan was soft and buttery and never went hard (Usually after 5-10 minutes Naan becomes crisp and hard as a rock.) Lahore Karahi does a good job from keeping their Naans soft and tasty until the very end. The Chicken Tikka Masla was spicy, tangy and rich. They also gave generous portions of meat (always a plus in my book because some Indian restaurants only give you tiny chunks and more curry sauce). Here it's balanced. The Tandoori Chicken was tasty, juicy, and had a perfect balance of spice (reminded me of my uncle's cooking)! Last but not the lamb biryani. Juicy lamb with the perfect blend  of pure spices. Not too spicy and not too bland. Also this place serves free chai (tea). A perfect drink to have when having Indian food.

I've been there during lunch when he is the only one cooking, taking orders, and busing the tables.  It makes for incredibly slow service, but good things are worth waiting for.\n\nOrder any of their lamb dishes, or their paneer dishes and you will not be disappointed.  The food is perfectly spicy, savory, and oh-so-good.\n\nMy only disappointment is the rice pudding.  When I ordered it, I was expecting the soupy, cinnamony, yumminess that normally comes at the end of Indian meals.  Unfortunately, they served thick, bland rice pudding that was nothing close to what I'm used to.", "author": "Carmen L."}

I especially liked that everything was cooked pretty much from scratch after we ordered it. However, Lahore didn't knock Shalimar off my #1 spot. The chicken tikka masala is way more flavorful at Shalimar. At Lahore it was really sweet in the beginning with a spiciness at the end and not a lot of flavor in between. Very good but not fantastic.\n\nEverything was spicy enough. The food just lacked that explosion of flavor that I expect from a top-notch Pakistani restaurant. I did think the samosas were excellent and worth the trip alone. I'd definitely come back here but if I want the best chicken tikka masala in SF I'll be heading to Shalimar.", "author": "Aaron V."}

Tried the lamb vindaloo (just a baseline comparison dish I try in virtually all new Indian restaurants) and a ground lamb and potato special. The dishes are cooked fresh and served hot. I thought the portion size was good and in line with the prices. The restaurant is small, sparsely furnished, and the semi-counter service is a bit of a put-off.

We don't like to waste our time, so we rely on reading reviews here to help us when eating out of town.  We liked the reviews we read and decided to take a chance at Lahore Karahi.\n\nWe were not disappointed!!!  There were 6 of us, including a 4 year old who thought everything was too spicy except for the Naan... the rest of us enjoyed everything from the Butter Chicken (the best I've ever had...just the right blend of spices and texture-I ordered mild but the 4 year old still thought it was too spicy,  to the grilled plates, tandoori fish, kabobs and saag paneer for our vegetarian daughter).\n\nMy husband liked the kabob a lot!!!  He is very picky about his Kabobs since he is from Iran and eating good Kabobs is very important to him. \n\nI must say, the highlight of the evening was eating the tasty fresh out of the the tanoor, Naans.  We ordered all kinds... even ones not on the menu (Keema Naan).  Everything was reasonably priced except for the soda cans!!!  (If you can avoid ordering the overpriced drinks... then you won't be angry about having to pay $3 for a can of Sprite/Pepsi when a fresh homemade Naan straight from the oven is only $1.  (But I could be wrong about the price of the drinks since I didn't actually look at the bill personally and just going by what one member of our party was saying... which is why I didn't take a star away from my ratings.)  \n\nAnyway, our server, a young boy (probably owner's son) was very polite and pleasant, but distracted probably because many people do go through.  We were lucky to be there when it wasn't quite so busy just yet.\n\nI highly recommend this place... especially for those tired of the same menu and blah taste of the usual Paskistani/Indian food.

It tasted even better than I recollected.  It wasn't the typical orangish red that I'm accustomed to from tandoori dishes, but more of a curry colored, chunky marinade.  With each bite, I tasted a different mix of exotic spices so each bite gave way to a flavor explosion.  Taking a closer look at the fish, I saw evidence of cumin seeds and pepper flakes, though I wasn't able to distinguish all the flavors were contributing to the deliciousness.  I'm only able to say it has a medium heat with a slightly citrusy flavor, and a garlicky-gingery bite.\n\nI picked up the tandoori mixed grill, which is an assortment of chicken and lamb and was surprised when I opened the to-go box.  Plenty of chicken from a large kabab, boti, a drumstick and breast and one lonely lamb kebab.  The lamb looked out of place in the large poultry parts assortment, almost as if it had mistakenly rolled in before the box had been closed.  I was disappointed that there was so little of it because I love lamb; that is, until I bit into it.  The lamb was dried out and chewy, and tasted a lot like a huge exotic-tasting beef jerky ball.  The chicken was, by contrast, much moister and tender.  I particularly liked the chicken kebab and grilled breast & thigh.\n\nSince I highly doubt I'll be able to replicate the tandoori fish with any success, I'll definitely be back for more.  Definitely go for the tandoori fish, and try the chicken tikka masala too!\n\nAfter feasting on the various tandoori dishes, I smell strongly of curry so I highly suspect I'll be flying solo tonight and running outdoors instead of working out at the gym =)", "author": "Janet L."}

I've never had tandoori style fish anywhere, but it is delish here. \n\nOh and these people do NOT mess around with the spiciness. if you say medium, it is quite spicy. To me it was medium but a lot of people couldn't handle it. They don't mess around like a lot of places. So if you are one of those people that can handle generally spicy food, get medium. The higher spicy level must be REAL spicy, and I never get anything but the highest spicy levels usually, so coming from me it says a lot. Then again, if you come on a different day with a different Chef it might change, so order at your own risk! \n\nIt's a pretty small place so be ready for longer waits during busy times. Family style works well here. The waiter was real cool and knew the friend I went with, so he rewarded us with ice cream on a toothpick at the end. That was some good ice cream...they probably have it on the menu, if so, get it! It's orange.\n\nGreat tasting food, VERY good prices (under 8-9 dollars will fill most people up).

Naan and rice are a must, of course.\n\nBest part: it is incredibly cheap.  With tax and tip, the five of us paid $11 each.  This is after 3 orders of both naan and rice, plus five entrees.

We ended up missing the movie we were supposed to go to because the service was so slow.\n\nLet's start with the food. All of the dishes I've had are richly spiced and really nicely put together, especially for $7 or $8. Even old standbys are extra tasty here, and they aren't greasy which can be the downfall of some cheap South Asian restaurants.\n\nI've had the well loved fish curry, and really liked it, the the potato/cauliflower aloo gobhi (extra interesting here and absolutely delicious with what can be relatively bland ingredients) and the butter chicken. All were delicious.\n\nThe first visit I made a month or so ago (7/09) the service was quick and efficient. It's a small room and one person should be able to cover it even when busy.\n\nLast night, 9/12/09,  was just dreadful. The one waiter was scattered and couldn't seem to figure out that bringing more than one dish from the kitchen at a time would be more efficient and less annoying to the patrons. He would go to the kitchen, get one thing, and then go back and get another and take it to the same table. Crazy. \n\nIt took 30 minutes for our food to come which seems very long in a restaurant of this sort. People who sat down after us got their food before us, which is always irritating, moreso when you're trying to go to a movie up the street. The waiter was also packaging to go orders, so it's not entirely his fault, but he clearly had no idea what he was doing. \n\nWhen the first dish finally came, we reminded him to bring us the bread, rice and mixed pickle we ordered, which he brought ON THREE SEPARATE TRIPS from the kitchen, even though it's either pre-made (pickle) or sitting there waiting to be dished up (bread and rice).\n\nJust crazy. it would make me hesitate to go back, particularly if I was in a hurry, like last night.

I wanted to doggy paddle in the freakin' sauce...it was that good.  The mango laasi's were perfectly paired for the dishes as well...not too thick, and not too sweet like some other places I've been to.\n\nAnd now the pet peeves:  The Bollywood film playing on the television was simply terrible...and yet I could not peel my eyes away from it.  The food was brought out awkwardly...one dish at a time, then the naan.  By the time the raita came - there was nothing left on the table to dip (other than my spoon, and so I ate it like soup).  Also they did not give us enough rice for three people.  Lastly, Jerry bit down on a \n\nR\nO\nC\nK\n\n(okay, it was a pebble)  But still - WTF.  He sank it in his water glass, cleaned it off and passed it around the table.  Sure enough - it was a rock.  We banged it against the table...scratched the table with it in fact.   And then we scratched our heads.  Maybe it was a spicy rock? A spice rock?  A cinna-pebble? We debated how such a pebble could get into the vindaloo, and then debated some more whether to tell the chef-owner when paying.  Jerry decided he should.  The owner just kinda looked at it for a bit.  Then he picked it up and rolled it between his fingers.  The smile never left his face.  I felt awkward.  US/ Pakistani relations are slightly strained right now, and I thought this might add to the tension, so I went out for a smoke...\n\nMoral of story:  Enjoy the food...order extra rice and avoid rocks and uncomfortable situations.", "author": "Mc Matty b."}

For instance, Sav might be a character similar to Samantha's, because they are both slutty Prada scarf-wearing whores; Celebguru could be the Charlotte of our group, with his doofy comments about deep colds and overall lack of comprehension; Ed might very well play a character similar to Miranda because of his thick, lustrous red hair, strong work ethic, and sense of intensity and seriousness.

Not cool on both counts.\n\nMy friends and I had the Butter Chicken, Lamb Korma, Aloo Gobhi (cauliflower and potato), and side orders of Lahore Karahi Rice and naan. Although I'm not a big fan of Indian food, the chicken seriously made me reconsider this--I loved the flavor of the creamy sauce and butter. Butter definitely makes everything better. The lamb was extremely tender and the curry, well-spiced. It's always interesting to see cinnamon sticks used outside of desserts. I found the cauliflower and potato to be mediocre, but my friends really enjoyed this dish. The rice was incredibly fragrant and the naan, hot and doughy--I'm just in love with everything doughy.\n\nThe waiters will serve you water but you have to self-serve Chai tea.

Where shalimar feels like they just threw some curry into a dish and served it to you, the food just felt...crafted here.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, unlike the other places, you actually have a waiter, and he actually takes your order and serves you your food.  The chef Guddu makes GUDDU FOOD!!!  (har har har)  but damn he's aptly named.\r\n\r\nWe started with those little cracker-like, naan-shaped pieces of unrisen bread and chutney, on the house.  Took a while for the food to come, and there was no beer in the fridge (I'm guessing it's BYOB like shalimar), but it was worth the wait.\r\n\r\nWe had the chicken karahi, the eggplant dish (starts with a b), and the tandoori chops.  I couldn't believe the lamb chops could be better than shalimar, but they were actually better marinated, and well grilled.  Served on a hot iron plate, it gets that nice korean bbq smell in your clothes, so BE WARNED.  But it was really tasty.\r\nThe chicken karahi was perfectly stir-fried--just chewy enough, yet still moist, with some flavorful pasty stuff all over, and some good bite (we got all the dishes \"spicy\"), and some good balance of sweetness and flavor in general.\r\nThe eggplant dish was very tasty!  Perhaps a little too sweet, but overall well balanced and flavorful.\r\nThe naan was just right, and we saw Guddu kneading and throwing around the dough as we walked in. \r\n\r\nPrices were good, not quite as cheap as shalimar, but still inexpensive.  I believe the tandoori chop was $8, chicken was $6, eggplant was $6.  But I can't remember, so don't quote me on that.  Total for the meal was $25 before tip, including a coke, garlic naan, and rice.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely a fan now!  One of my bengali buddies introduced me to shalimar back in the day.

Each crescendo or crack of the soprano's voice becomes the *only* way to hear the piece. My taste buds seem to have this dysfunction too because I kept comparing Lahore Karahi to Shalimar with each bite.\n\nI was stoked to visit LK based on great feedback from yelpers with top notch cred. The delicious and filling food, super low price and my curiosity to find a new king of the hill over Shalimar beckoned my appetite.\n\nI ordered Chicken Tikka Marsala, my Indian restaurant litmus test, and a chick pea dish, Lahori Chikkar Choley, along with rice and plain naan. What a bargain ringing in at $20 including tip - very nice! The Chicken Tikka Marsala wasn't the bright radioactive lava orange that I know and love - maybe that's actually a good thing! The familiar spices and flavor came through on my first bite - but it was much denser, creamier, sweeter and less spicy than Shalimar. It was a more subtle experience. The juicy chicken was cooked perfectly and it all paired nicely with the lightly oiled brownish rice. I enjoyed it, especially because it seemed less oily than Shalimar's. However I preferred the fiery kick and bolder flavors of Shalimar's orangey lava.  \n\nThe choley was another story. It was super salty, cloying, dense and pretty much unpalatable. I like chick peas in Indian dishes - but this one rubbed me the wrong way. The naan also fell short of Shalimar. Instead of offering a crisp exterior yielding to a delicately puffy and tender center, I gnawed on a crisp but dense hunk of flat bread. And what was up with that yeasty sour flavor??? In fairness it served its purpose to cut the dish's sweet richness. I shed a little tear cause I loves my naan.\n\nI'll admit I avoid dining in the tenderloin. Walking from Van Ness to LK provides stereotypical tenderloin thrills and chills that I prefer avoiding. Unless we took a cab, I wouldn't be surprised if my girlfriend withheld sex because I made her walk in this crappy neighborhood.\n\nI actually like the idea of hole in the wall restaurants, just so long as the cooking area is clean - or it's kept well hid. Nope, the kitchen's dirty and visible at LK. The show \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" should film on location at LK. LK scores 80 on the SF Dept of Health inspection for exposed storage of food, unclean non-cooking surfaces and poor handwashing facilities. http://sfscores.com/#Yz0zNy43ODksLTEyMi40MSZ6PTE1Jmk9KDM3Ljc4NTU3MiwgLTEyMi40MTUwNjEpJmY9TGFob3JlJTIwS2FyYWhpJnMxPTAmczI9MTAwJm89cm5k\n\nI did admire the Jackson Pollack-style art splattered behind the filthy stoves in shades of day old curry - oh wait! that is day old curry.  Dirty pans were everywhere and containers of ingredients were on the floor in front of the ovens. This sh** makes you go \"Hmmmm.\" Aren't we all believers that a clean kitchen produces tastier, healthier food?\n\nThe owner of LK, \"Guddhu\" was really friendly. I liked the feel of the place and how Bollywood movies were playing in the background. You can tell this restaurant is part of the fabric of our fair city. For example, a customer came back and said something in an Pakistani dialect - perhaps she forgot to tip - and Guddhu smiled and waved a \"no problem\" and she thanked him.\n\nIt's not like Shalimar has a much better health score (86 and I've seen cockroaches there), but I'm still locked into hearing my Indian dishes conducted by Maestro Shalimar.", "author": "Brady K."}

Saying that hurts because I was really looking forward to \"the best Pakistani food in SF\".  \n\nNow before I get into my review, let me say that I do know a thing or two about Pakistani food.  Whereas I am not desi, I have lived on the food for weeks at a time and have experienced everything from the most flame-thrower spicy, yet clean and delicious, to the \"I think I might spend Laylatul Qadr in the bathroom\" fare.\n\nOur evening started out a little strange when it took our waiter a good 5-7 minutes to get us our menu.  That was forgivable.  We weren't particularly crazy-hungry, so we opted for the Saag Gosht (lamb in spinach), Aloo Matter (potatoes and peas), two rotis and an Afghani Naan (naan stuffed with raisins, nuts, cheese, and cherries).  The latter really piqued our interest because my wife is Afghan and she had never heard of anything like it before.\n\nThe food came out really quick and we were pleasantly surprised at that, taking into consideration how others have complained of long wait times.  However, when the roti came out I noticed something different.  It wasn't roti.  Roti is made from whole wheat, at least that is the kind that I have had, and that is what is says it is supposed to be on the menu.  What was delivered was two pieces of naan.  Now, naan is not bad, but it's not roti.  When I brought this up to the waiter, he assured me that this indeed was roti.  It totally wasn't.  I said that I thought roti was whole wheat.  He said it was.  It totally wasn't.  But I wasn't going to argue further.  I settled with the naan, um, I mean roti.\n\nThe saag gosht and aloo matter were nice.  Both were very flavorful with the right amount of spice.  The food was also very clean tasting and fresh as well, and it didn't have a half-inch layer of oil floating on top either.  This I was thankful for.  However, there wasn't much there.  There was plenty of sauce mind you, but the actual ingredients mentioned in the name of each dish were surprisingly sparse.  There were about three cubes of lamb in the saag gosht and about the same amount of potatoes in the aloo matter.  Combine that with about nine peas and you have some disappointment.  Now I know that this is a recession, but come on.\n\nI won't say much about the \"Afghani Naan\" except that if you don't like fruit cake, you'll want to stay away.\n\nAgain, this review hurts because 1) I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, and 2) I really wanted to like it.  I have frequented other spots in SF with expectations met and thought this would be another one.  Who knows, but I won't be coming back and could not recommend it either.", "author": "Nicolas W."}

Somehow my group of 12 friends managed to snag a table here with no reservation on Friday night (our waiter was kind enough to move a few people to another table). We were expecting some slow service since this place was literally packed- almost every seat filled. But it wasn't bad at all! We all ordered and got our food at the same time though they did take a while to get all our naan out. \n\nThe food is very rich, and according to my Indian friend- pretty authentic. We tried the Saag Gosht (lamb and spinah curry) and Prawn Vindaloo. Both were really spicy and went perfectly with the soft, freshly made garlic and onion naan. The lamb was perfect but the prawns were overcooked in my opinion. I also tried my friend's Afghani naan, which is supposed to be filled with raisins and nuts, but it tasted more like a fruitcake (guessing they ran out of ingredients?) Unfortunately, they didn't have any of the appetizers we wanted. \n\nAnother bad thing was that toward the end of the meal, the restaurant started getting really smokey due to the open kitchen. Some of my friends really liked the smell, but it irritated my nose and made it unbearably warm inside. \n\nOverall the food is excellent (especially if you need to accomodate vegetarians) and the service is acceptable (given the restaurant was jam packed.) It's a great place to warm up with some HOT indian food on a cold winter night.

My boyfriend and I stopped by Lahore Karahi for dinner last week after reading the Yelp reviews. We showed up and figured we would place a to-go order and be in and out in 20 minutes or so. Not the case. Yes, there were a handful of people in the dining area but by no means were they crowded. We placed our order and sat down at one of the large tables with our tasty little cups of complementary tea and waited for our food. And waited. And waited. The longer we waited, the more to shambles the service fell. We watched as tables were being delivered the wrong items and some items never came at all. The poor server (granted there was just one guy taking orders, delivering said orders and ringing people up) seemed to have no idea what was going on. After about 40 minutes, we decided to check where our 2 dishes had ended up. Still not ready. Another 10-15 minutes and, alas, our food was ready! We paid and busted out of there as fast as we could only to get home to find out they din't give us one of our dishes. All we wanted was chicken tikka masala, bengan bhartila (roasted eggplant curry) and garlic naan. But it would seem that we would have to settle for the naan, rice and eggplant. \n\nYes, we were incredibly disappointed but, by god, if that wasn't the most delicious Pakistani/Indian food I have ever placed in my flavor-loving mouth, then I don't know what is. Curse you, Lahore! \n\nOf course, we had to go back. There was no way I could turn down the flavor town that is Lahore Karahi. We had to try the chicken tikka masala. This time, we placed a phone order and headed over. The place was empty and everyone working that night seemed super competent as our oder was packaged and we were rung up and out the door in minutes. This time they did not disappoint. Our food was everything I hoped it would be and more!\n\nIf you have the patience of a saint, I strongly advise you try this place!", "author": "Heather U."}

Unfortunately for us, we did actually expect to be able to order and eat at some point in the evening. The waitstaff's unfailingly bizarre behavior sure dampened any notion we had of that actually happening.\n\nWe were initially able to place an order for some food, that's the good part, unfortunately, only a couple of the items we ordered actually ever arrived. While we were hungry, we were more than prepared to wait our turn, it's just that our turn never came. Oddly, the place wasn't even really busy when we first arrived, just a couple of tables filled but most were unoccupied. \n\nWe really tried (and politely I might add) to reorder our food, but it was to no avail. At first I tried politely asking for the items we ordered, the waiter would sort of motion and then run off, but it was simply to no avail as the food never arrived. After trying that a few times, I next resorted to asking another waiter, again, I sort of got a nod and then.. nothing!

The sauces were flavorful, hot, and fresh. \n\nIf you read my other review, you'll know I'm not a lamb fan, but my 2 other friends devored the biryani. Seems like a good sign. My only disappointment was the Afghani naan. I was thinking it would be more like this other sweet naan I was in search of, but this reminded me more of a fruitcake naan. Same colors and odd taste. But hey, what do I know.\n\nI'd definitely go back, without fear nor coupons (the bill was $40 for FOUR people with a few non alcoholic drinks + tip). Be adventurous and go!

Waay better than that bland, oily Naan n' Curry crap. I always order my favorite dish, which is the bengan bharta (eggplant curry..? eggplant something) along with rice and either regular, garlic, onion or potato naan. The eggplant dish is pretty consistent, very flavorful and yummy. The naans are freshly made and cooked to order. You can sometimes see and hear the owner/chef pounding the naan dough before baking(?) it. The rice, well you can't exactly go wrong with rice. \n\nI've also tried their chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo and saag paneer. No complaints about any of those dishes, although I still prefer the bengan bharta - it's THAT good. Every now and then I'll order the mango lassi. It's pretty good, but I can't tell if they use powdered mango flavoring or if it's the real stuff, nor do I really care. It just hits the spot whenever I feel like having one. \n\nNow for the gripe. Service sucks ass. I haven't figured out if this place is like Naan n' Curry where you have to get your own plates, silverware, water, etc. There'd be times when the waiter would get it for us and other times when we'd get it ourselves. Also, there would be times when the waiter would take our orders and other times when we went up to the front counter to place our order. \n\nWait time for the food can take a while. There is only one or two chefs and from what I've noticed, they cook the food according to whichever party placed their order first. So if a large party ordered their food before you, then have fun waiting until the large party receives all their food.\n\nSometimes there is even a long wait to pay after you're done with your meal. From what I've experienced, it's because the owner is the only one who cooks (some nights there is another chef), takes the phone orders AND handles the money. With one person manning everything, a wait is bound to occur.\n\nThis place is a hole in the wall in the Tenderloin, and parking can be hard. So if a crackhead or bum points out a parking spot or guides you while you park, \"tip\" them a dollar or two. You'll never know what might \"accidentally\" happen to your car.\n\nOh, and they take credit cards =)", "author": "Maryann T."}

Naan is buttery and fluffy, I've had the vegetable biriyani and it is SO yummy - full of interesting veggies.  Goat curry isn't on the menu but he always has it on hand.  Tandoor fish - best in the city.  Sheekh kebab - the lamb is mixed with these wonderful herbs and it comes sizzling to your table.  Saag, choley is great.  Dal Makhani is EXTRA spicy.  \n\nThe best part, if that is possible: the price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-07-09", "description": "My quest to find the best tikka masala among the Tandoorloin's many Indian places brought me to Lahore. Upon entering, we were promptly seated and given our drinks. We got fish tikka masala, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken leg, some garlic naan and basmati rice. \n\nThe fish tikka masala is beyond superb. Chilean sea bass cooked in a buttery tikka masala sauce that has a great depth of flavors. Unlike most places where the TM sauce is very smooth and creamy (sometimes almost too creamy), Lahore's version is chunkier, has more texture to it (I think there were nuts in the sauce...or some other crunchy thing) and has a lot more flavor. Some people prefer their tikka masala smooth and creamy -- I was one of those -- but I'm now a convert for the chunkier and more flavorful sauce that Lahore makes. \n\nThe chicken biryani is also good. We asked for it spicy though, which is a little too spicy for me. I must admit that I have a low tolerance level for anything hot, so I think I downed two cups of water for the small portion of biryani that I tasted. \n\nThe tandoori chicken is yum-o as well. For $3, you get a tandoori chicken thigh/leg on a big plate of grilled veggies. It's moist, delicious and just has the right amount of kick to it.\n\nThe garlic naan is goooood. A warning though, they take their garlic seriously here, so if you're a faux or a semi garlic lover, I suggest going for the regular. The garlic and cilantro is just ooozing from the naan and since I love both, I was in naan heaven after having some. \n\nOh and of course, forget about parking when you go here. Try walking instead. I know, it's the Tenderloin, but it's a short little walk from Union Square, the muni, bart, so getting here is no problemo at all. \n\nJust clutch that purse to your chest, have 911 already dialed on your cellphone -- you just need to press the call button -- bring that pepper spray and you're good to go.

Given the neighborhood and the cheap eats I would normally let such humble settings slide.  The prices are about the same as Naan'n'Curry, but even those guys put a little more into the decor.  I don't need much time looking on the menu because I always get chicken tikka masala and chicken tandoori.  In a way, I judge a place by how well they can prepare those staples for me (in Japanese restaurants hamachi is the litmus test).  Both items were not to my liking.  The masala sauce was sweet! (It was spicy too, as it should be) This pretty much ruins it for me.  I'm still appalled. \nThe tandoori was not very juicy but ok, 3 stars.  My friend got a vegetarian dish and it had onions in it and it was spicy.  That was the night I found out my friend hates onions and can't stand spicy food. Ha!

Once the food arrived (which was surprisingly fast considering other's experiences),  I was drawn to the meal and our surroundings disappeared.   We had modest appetites and regrettably only ordered two main dishes.  The Chicken Korma was mild and inviting but the Lamb Biryani stole the show.  With a requested \"medium\" spiciness, the flavors were heightened and not overwhelming.  The rice was light and the lamb was not too.... lamby?.  The garlic Naan was outstanding but the lightly roasted garlic with butter was a little much for my companion.  She has very light tastes so we ordered some plain Naan too but upon its arrival she exclaimed \"oh, it's so greasy\".\n\nI think our host was already a bit irked with us at this point.  My date's questions about certain dishes while ordering were met with some confusion and impatience.  There was a dual language barrier going on so I let it go at the time.

We were expecting a Nan with Cherry Paste and Nuts (similar to the description and what we commonly know and love as Kashmiri Nan). However what arrived (Another 10 minutes after all the food) Looked like they had picked the dried fruits out of a holiday fruit cake (you know the kind no one eats around the holidays). Little Bitz of fake wax cherries and those plasticky green mystery fruit were embedded in a paper thin slice of crispy hot nan like bread. \n\nBy this time, the cockroaches had descended on our table (no joke). After shooing off a few we decided to call it quits and pack up our leftovers (which were not gong to eat anyways) and get the $@#^& outa dodge!\n\nWhile the Waiter Seemed to be a really nice and personable (if not overly pushy) guy, the food and dirty decor were severely lac luster.\n\nI left this restaurant in a daze.. wondering \"WHY GOD WHY?\"  How could so many people on yelp actually like this place? Did they maybe get some crack in their food or get hypnotized by the pushy waiter? I guess ill never know, because you will never find me eating here again ever. \n\nCompared to any other restaurant that serves Pakistani/Indian this was by far the worst I've had in the city..", "author": "Raphael P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-27", "description": "After reading fellow yelpers reviews of this place that is less than a block walking distance from my apartment, I decided to try it out. It is a small restaurant with about 10 or so dining tables. The wait staff and cook (i think he is the owner) are all very friendly and accomodating. Others have stated that the service is terrible. I disagree. The service is slow, yes (we waited about 10 min to have our order taken and about 20 for our food to arrive when the restaurant wasn't full at all), but the staff is eager and willing to assist you in ordering. Plus, the drinks are self service, so all the waiter really does is take your order and bring you plates.  The food is cooked dish by dish and I liked the fact that you could order everything mild or spicy (i like some things really spicy and some not so much). I liked their tea way better than naan and curry's.\n\nSo, the food. I'm going to start with their naan. I thought the naan was delicious, soft and fluffy in some spots, with a few crisp areas. A nice touch also is that they butter, and cut your naan into four pieces which makes it easy when you are sharing with others. We tried the chicken tikka masala and the lamb biryani. Both were delicious and I have since been back one more time and ordered the same thing, this time spicy. I liked the spicy lamb biryani better, but the mild chicken tikka masala was more flavorful to me. \n \nThe next time I go, I plan to branch out and try a few new things. I am new to Indian and Pakistani cuisine, so I think I will ask the staff what they reccomend. The tandoori plates that I saw going to other tables looked awesome, and the mango lassy sounds really yummy. \n\nBasically, this is an awesome, cheap little hole in the wall kind of place with food that will blow you away. I wouldn't reccomend heading over to Lahore Karahi before an event because of the wait times, but it is a great place to go if you are hungry and appreciate fresh cooked delicious food.", "author": "Megan M."}

Only in the Tenderloin.\n\nLove me some chicken tikka masala... and that's exactly what I had (devoured) at Lahore Karahi a couple of weeks ago. I won't bother to add to the already bountiful glowing reviews about the food here, though I fully concur, and will instead limit my 2 cents to advising that you get it to go. \n\nLast time we stopped by, they were so busy that the food took half an hour to appear before us (and we got lucky, it seems, though not without a little friendly insistence). There were most definitely a few awkward instances when a couple of customers got impatient and angry, and the chef proceeded to blurt out that this was a take-out place only, though I'm not sure what that has to do with the speed of the cooking... which does, in turn, have a lot to do with the fact that there is only one -- one! -- cook (albeit a talented one at that). \n\nThe truth is that LK seems to have become popular fairly rapidly and just hasn't had the chance to catch up to its own significantly expanded fan-base, what with its single chef, naan specialist, and two overworked busboys. Moreover, the restaurant does feature a sign on its window that states quite clearly \"take out only\" but has several tables and chairs inside as well, which lends itself to sedentary customers. So the restaurant is certainly undergoing a severe identity crisis which, until resolved, may taint customers' experiences... However, I do recommend that you arm yourself with patience and venture into this tasty Pakistani gem, because the food is positively worth whatever hassle you may have to endure.", "author": "G.

The place was pretty empty and we were seated on the big table in the middle, even though there were only two of us. Next to a us was a little table in the corner full of dirty dishes. I looked around to see four tables that still had dirty dishes...all this was a huge turn-off, but we decided to stay anyway since the reviews were so good. The place is small, and only a few tables were taken, so why the waiter/buss boy was so damn slow in doing his work was beyond me. \n\nIt was irritating to see him walk around, answering his phone every few minutes while doing everything in slow-mo. I asked for a straw...he actually looked around for one when there was a container full sitting in a prominent place next to the drink glasses. Anyone who's been to this place knows how tiny it is...I'd never been there, but still, I knew where the straws were! Near the entrance, somebody was peeling potatoes and onions on a small table. It sure didn't add to the already crappy ambiance.\n\nThe food was not so great, either. We ordered vegetable pakoras which were overdone. The butter chicken had a weird consistency and tasted nothing like any butter chicken I've ever had. The chicken karahi was nicely spicy, but all you could taste was dry chicken and green chillies. The garlic naan was ok, but the regular naan was really good. Mango lassi was watered down and they had no ice for our Cokes.\n\nNeedless to say, dinner sucked. The kitchen was dirty, the owner kept coming and going indoors and out...he actually met a friend at the front door and played with her dog...eeew!

Onwards...\n\nFinding parking in the Tenderloin is creepy and a pain in the ass.  We parked two blocks away and passed a woman putting shiny, silver underwear on her head as we walked to the restaurant.  Nice.\n\nThe place is small and not much by way of decoration.  The tables are equally small and grouped pretty close to one another.  The menu was ample for us vegetarians and it was gloriously cheap.

The server wasn't friendly and  made sure to remind us that we didn't originally order rice.  \"Yes, I know, but we would like some rice now, thank you.\"\n\nThe food was fine.  Nothing to write home about but I'm not much of a connoisseur. \n\nWe had finished our water before the food even got there and were never offered more.  This is frustrating since I'm a pansy for spicy foods and, dammit, i just like having sufficient water at dinner.  I walked up to the pitcher at one point, only to have a waiter swoop in and take it away before I got there.  I had my friend flag down the server since I'm not keen on rejection.\n\nThe server sat someone at the table behind us and reprimanded us for putting a food basket on the table.  First, we didn't even order anything that came in a basket.  And second, even if we had put it there, it wouldn't have been malicious - the tables are very small.  Just pick it up and go on with your business.\n\nThere were only two or three people working there and I don't really mind my food taking a little extra time, but I appreciate normal service like refilling water.\n\nI paid and we walked back to the car, past a woman beating on some guy with a pillowcase and yelling at him.\n\ntotal: $25+tip\n\nPros: very cheap\nCons: unfriendly/unhelpful waitstaff and location", "author": "Lindsay D."}

However, more often then Yelp, your co-worker of the ethnicity in question is even more dead-on. When I saw 4.5 stars on 190 reviews I thought \"this is promising\". When my co-worker said \"The only Indian food that compares is my mom's. I lived in England for 10 years and never had Indian food this good\" - then...I drop everything I'm doing and proceed to the restaurant immediately. Simply put, this is best Indian food I've ever had. Some places have been close, but Lahore Karahi is the new standard-bearer. \n\nLK is in the Tenderloin. So, get your dirty, grimy, SF reality on, and go on a foggy, windy, and freezing summer's evening. The place is BYOB so bring some wine or some beer. When my friend and I arrived, a group of 6 people had already gone through a 6-pack of Fat Tire and were working on a 6-pack of Red Stripe. Two other guys across the room each had one of those large cans of Sapporo to drink with their meal. That alone shows how knowledgeable the patrons here are. They understand that Light lagers, pilsners, and weak ales are the only acceptable beer-forms for Indian (or any other type of equatorial) food.\n\nNow, to the food - My friend and I, seeing that all entrees (other than 3 items) were priced below $7 immediately went into a binge-fest. We ordered an outstanding roti ($1), we ordered naan ($1), we order Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo ($7), and lastly, we ordered the much-hullabalooed Tandoori Fish ($11). Everything was outstanding. The Tandoori Fish was perfectly spiced, perfectly cooked. The Lamb vindaloo was incredibly complex and rich. And of course, the Butter Chicken was butter chicken - but unlike most places they let the chicken shine, not the sauce. We ate until you could not possible eat ever again. I am writing this around lunch-time of the day after and I'm still full.\n\nThe owner/chef/waiter greeted us and, at first glance, was slightly eerie.

It was timely, efficient, and (somewhat) unintrusive. \n\nI will be back here many, many times. Oh..and Bourbon and Branch is like 5 steps away.

I tend to visit a new restaurant every weekend and i am a big fan of food\\cooking myself.\n\nMy first ever review and sorry that it has to be a negative one. But here is why:\n\nThis is what i feel when i follow a Yelp review:\n\nWhen it comes to food, there is a difference between good tasting food and ORIGINAL tasting food. \nYelp reviewers can agree on good tasting food, but not on the later. For example, I have found myself loving certain\nChinese &Mediterranean restaurants which are detested by my Chinese &Mediterranean friends. Reason: I liked how the \nfood at these places tasted, but had no exact idea as to how they were supposed to taste. It is like going to a sushi \nplace and enjoying a sushi with cooked fish(Might be exaggerating a bit :-) ). \n\n\nLahore Karahi will probably fit the former(In my case not even that). Here are reasons why:\n\nMy order:\n\n1)Sheek Kebab\n2)Lamb Biryani\n3)Garlic Naan\n4)Butter Chicken\n\nIn this case, me being from that part of the world(Indian& Pakistan) and being an avid food lover, I know how each of the above should taste like, or how each \nof the above taste in the best restaurants, cooked by the best chefs in that part of the world. let me explain how\nit should have been cooked and how it should have tasted, and how it actually did.\n\n1) Sheek Kebab: Ground lamb kebabs which when pulled out of the tandoor(grill), should never be overcooked.\nWhen served, the meat is tender and juicy and is still cooking from the heat. at Lahori: burnt on the outside, really\ndry meat, overcooked. spices were not bad.\n\n2)Lamb Biryani: usually cooked in a big pot\\vessel with alternate layers of \nrice and meat(Slow cooked for a long time and simmered and when served, the layers are mixed and a serving portion is taken out of the big \npot/vessel). At Lahori: rice and meat mixed together in a frying pan(I saw him do this!).\n\n3) Garlic Naan: Naan usually fluffy and super soft bread with garlic and cilantro pretty much melting on top with the heat of the Naan.\nAt Lahori: dry bread, garlic not fresh.\n\n4) Butter chicken: Creamy sauce, with butter floating on top with super soft chicken pieces. At lahori: Not creamy at all, \nbut rather like a paste of onions and tomatoes. the texture was so that i could feel the onions and tomatoes in my mouth.\nthe color which should be bright red or orange is just red. can barely taste the fresh butter. \n\nA lot of you might be thinking if should expect all this in a small restaurant in tenderloin. But as a matter of fact, Every good\\well known\nstreet side restaurant in that part of Indian/Pakistan serve the above dishes just as explained above.\n\nReasons why my 2 stars: The use of spices were pretty decent .But failed in all other aspects (texture, the way it is \ncooked, served, size, taste) . The service was friendly and good.\n\nAlso to note, probably a reason why this place gets great reviews, is the service part. The old man serving tends to do a great job\nin hyping up the restaurant. I hear him say things like \"No one cooks this dish as good as we do\" and it seems to be working with the\ncustomers as well. i don't rate restaurants on decor unless it fits that category. The decor in this place seems to be good enough for this\nplace. \n\nAs it is my first one, i hope you enjoyed it and also be easy on me!", "author": "Karthick S."}

Let's start with the positive, lamb tandoori came hot and sizzling, chicken biryani was spicy and well flavored, our naan was soft and fluffy, and the curry was up to standards.\n\nNow for the bad part. We walked in, party of 5 on a Sunday early evening. It seemed pleasantly busy, a good sign. We were sat right away. When no one had brought water or offered to take our order after about 20 minutes we realized there was only ONE person taking orders, serving, and busing. We also observed that for some odd reason, plenty of other tables were being served before us (and later receiving their food well after we had placed our order). Long story short, we felt for the man who was doing EVERYTHING but the cooking, so we tipped him generously but this place needs to work on their service. Had the service been up to standards at least, this place would have been great, unfortunately we left the place pretty unhappy and all 5 of us don't believe it's worth ever going back.", "author": "Jamie W."}

I should be generous and assume that they are better on a slower night, but based on the food I can't see them getting more than 3 stars.  Rather than narrate the story, let me lay out what went right and wrong.\n\nRight:\n\n-Made us a very good off-menu salty lassi, by request.\n\n-Waitress was helpful and friendly\n\n-Food was fresh, including freshly made samosas\n\nWrong:\n\n-Long wait for food (admittedly acceptable on a Sat night)\n\n-Friction between male proprietors and female waitperson seemed to make transactions difficult.  Those guys seemed really disrespectful.\n\n-As others have mentioned, the Tikka Masala is sweet.  Worse yet, so is the Saag Paneer.  Yuk.\n\n-No chai.  It ran out before we could get our first cup.  Every time we asked for it, another staff person would practically roll their eyes and tell us we had to get it ourselves, and every time we would point out that THERE WASN'T ANY CHAI TO GET.  Sheesh.  And we were there for almost 2 hours.  Totally unacceptable for a Pakistani restaurant.  Chai should flow like water.\n\n-Took forever to pay.  We sat around waiting at our table for the change.  We were eventually told that the owner is the only one who handles the money, and thus there was a bottleneck.  Later, the older gentleman working the floor was so flustered at the fact we were still taking a precious table that he rudely told us that we were in the way of of people waiting for tables and we'd need to pester the owner ourselves for change.  When I went to do that, the owner spent several minutes pulling bread out of the tandoori oven before making the change.  I guess the owner is the only one trusted to make the bread too.\n\nNow, I am used to the Shalimar / Naan and Curry model of self-service, where there is no table service and all ordering happens at the counter.  In my experience, those places do that fine, and I am completely satisfied.  Their service is excellent if you accept that the terms and conditions.  I don't need to be pampered.  \n\nBut I've never been to a Pakistani place that is out of chai for two hours.  And if a restaurant offers table service, it shouldn't push people out of their tables to go get change.  Especially if the only reason for the hold up is that the owner can't trust his staff enough to delegate.  Overall, this place was seriously dysfunctional, and until they get their management together these sorts of problems will continue.\n\nMind you, I am the sort of person that would overlook it all if the food was good.  Sadly, it was not.", "author": "Jim C."}

Other tables that were sat AFTER us got their orders taken and their food served before our order was even taken. Come on now! Every time we flagged down our waiter, he averted his eye contact. One person in our party actually went TO the counter to give him our order, and once she was done, his question to her was... (get this!) \"Is your order for here or to go?\" *Puzzled look* You're kidding right? I can understand the restaurant was packed, but there are only about 8 tables. So what gives?\n\nThe mango lassi was definitely the worst I've ever had in my life. Once sip and I tossed it aside.\n\nThe only reason this place is getting 2 stars is that the food was excellent. Just the right amount of spice, heat, and meat in each dish. We had a group of 5 and ordered Butter Chicken, which was almost the exact same dish as the chicken tikki masala we ordered!

So, figuring that there was a long wait for the ppl behind us, we were thinking... this place must be THAT good. However, everything was satisfying, but unfortunately wasn't mind blowingly good. Everything seemed to have sauces with more of a sweet base, even their Basmati rice which had cinnamon sprinkled on it. A bit odd when you're looking for something w/ lots of spice. Their Mango Lassis though were just to my liking. Not loaded w/ sugar, it made a perfect addition to the meal. I even bypassed the opportunity to pop open a few bottles of wine just to enjoy the Mango Lassi that much more!\n\nDespite the so-so food, our server was pretty entertaining.

The samosas are just right, served very hot, with a beautiful flaky crust and very good chutney and julep on the table in big squeeze tubes.\n\nAnother thing I love about Lahore Karahi is the atmosphere.  This is a perfect place to come with a medium sized group of friends.  It's BYOB, and after a short wait you can usually take over the larger tables in the middle of the restaurant.  Because the entrees are so cheap, you can get a big variety of dishes and pass everything around.

The chef-owner greeted us warmly and pointed us at an open table.\n\nWe ordered Lamb Vinadloo, Bengan Bhartha, Tandoori Fish, 1 naan, and 1 onion kulcha. When asked if we want spicy, we said yes, please make it as spicy as you like it.\n\nIt took a while for us to get our food, but having read reports we were prepared for this. Thankfully we weren't starving so we didn't mind waiting. I picked up some beer from a nearby market and we drank and waited patiently.\n\nThe lamb arrived and was unlike any vindaloo we had ever had before. It was shreddy and succulent, immersed in a complex and delicious sauce. It was definitely spicy, but was also excellently spiced bursting with a plethora of flavors.\n\nThe bengan bhartha was extremely spicy. Easily the spiciest dish of the night. We were both happy and impressed with the level of spicyness. It's nice to find a place that's not afraid to bring the real heat. The dish was also quite tender and tastey.\n\nThe naan was great. Hot out of the tandoor in all its crispy-chewy glory. The onion kulcha tasted good, too, but I thought it could have used a bit more onion.\n\nLastly, the tandoori fish arrived sizzling on a cast iron hot plate. Flakey and tender chunks of sea bass with nicely charred edges, on a bed of lightly fried onions and lettuce. One bite and I knew it was the best Pakistani-Indian flavored fish dish I had ever laid my mouth upon. \"Wow\", was all I could muster up. The fish was fully flavored with lots of cilantro, coriander seeds, and fresh chilies.\n\nTotally sated I walked up to the front and thanked the chef for all the glorious and amazing food. I asked him what kind of fish was in the tandoori dish and he told me it was seabass. He mentioned that other chefs use salmon or catfish, but that he finds sea bass to be superior in taste. As I'm not a fan of cooked salmon, I totally agreed.\n\nHe offered us some homemade kulfi, but we could not eat anymore, and so told him we would gladly take some home. We wrapped up our leftovers and after paying, the chef gave us an additional complimentary dessert of bread pudding.\n\nLater on that night we delved into the kulfi which was creamy and superb. And yesterday we broke out the leftovers and bread pudding. The leftovers were just as good the next day, and the bread pudding was another winner.\n\nIt's really amazing how much good cheap food there is to be found in the Tenderloin.

Ordered my standard - saag paneer and chicken korma. Completely changes my perception of chicken korma - spicy and a very complex flavorful sauce.  Big cinnamon stick floating in there as well.  Everything was brought hot off the stove and straight to the table so we had no wait, but it was lunchtime on a Tuesday so that could explain it.\n\nSince it was our first time dining here, we were very complimentary to the chef/owner as we were paying and then we asked about how the rice pudding was.  His response was to give us a very large sample so we sat down again to finish it.  I don't like rice pudding much, the texture doesn't do much for me.  This rice pudding is AMAZING.  I will return just for that.\n\nGreat food, I wish it were closer to my neighborhood and had some ambiance but the food makes up for it.", "author": "Amy C."}

Yes, like most Tenderloin places, Lahore Karahi is not about friendly or even timely service. Neither it is about cleanliness, great location, or impeccable take out packaging. \n\nNo. This place is strictly about food. After you are half-starved waiting for at least 40 minutes for your meal to arrive, it strikes you with its aroma and then - its unique taste. This place is no regular Indian restaurant. It is Pakistani-Indian, which really means Pakistani, and unlike most similar joints in the area, it seems to take pride in it. Chicken tikka masala is indeed very different here from most places in town - it is more flavourful, richer in taste and just right in consistency of the curry. Aloo ghobi is delicious, rich on coriander and other spices. Lamb korma is similarly great. Even rice is more earthy, more hearty and again, different from most other places. Finally, nan and kulcha are krispy, fragrant and delicious. \n\nI used to get frustrated about the extremely slow service, cockroaches on walls and the wrong order of food being brought to my table.

Not a problem, we wanted indian and this place de-LIVER-ed (and we had a coupon! oh goodie!). Its in the tenderloin so yeah, you know the drill, one patron broke out a joint while he waited, I read the multitude of reviews pasted on to the window, raving about the place (and its tandoori fish)  which we ordered. We also got spinach cooked with potatoes and kasoori methi, and  eggplant  with onions, tomatoes & cream, and the Chicken Korma. \nIt was all very good. The vegetable dishes were not that spicy ( we never specified the level of heat), but the fish was. What is there to say, the vegetable dishes were mashed up curry style, the chicken was doused in curry sauce, and the fish came on a bed of lettuce and cucumbers. I have to say, why does everyone rave about the fish? It fell apart (good), and was cooked well, but it just tasted like.... fish. Void of spices, which made it pretty good... but nothing amazing.  The chicken was tender, fleshy, good, and the vegetable dishes were good, naan was  soft and good, not doughy. This is the place I will go to when I want indian.

I have been coming to this location back when it was the German Cook  and have eaten at Lahore probably 6 or 7 times and always had a good meal.\nWe lucked out and grabbed the first table to the right as  you entered which could sit three persons, great for sharing food and having a good conversation. Unfortunately, as soon as we sat down we noticed a little roach on the table slowly crawling up the wall........not a good start but not enough to make me walk out the door.\nThe owner and waiter were very attentive and friendly but the service was slower than usual but I think that's kind of nice so you can visit longer.\n\nThis evening we shared the Vegetable Samosas, Tandoori Lamb Chop, Tandoori Fish, Lahore Karahi Rice and garlic Naan.\nThe Vegetable Samosas were big and stuffed full, fried perfectly and served warm. I liked the mint sauce that accompanied them, I thought these were the best part of my meal.\nNext up was the Tandoori Lamb Chop, these were the smallest lamb chops I have ever seen. To say there was a mouthful of meat on each chop would be generous. \nWe followed with the Tandoori Fish which I will say looked beautifully cooked but I wasn't a fan of the type of fish that was used, maybe it was Catfish? It had a muddy taste to it that just took away any desire to eat the rest of the fish. The Karahi Rice was rice with some spice in it, nothing that caught my attention to make me order this rice dish again. I did enjoy the Garlic Naan, I'm amazed how each Indian/Pakistani restaurant has their own way of making Naan. Lahore's Naan is flat vs puffy and moist with lots of garlic and cilantro.\n I like the location of Lahore because it's in the Tenderloin, it's a perfectly safe neighborhood although it looks sketchy but this seems to weed out the \"Oh so trendy\" from the \"Gotta have authentic food\" folks like me. I like the size of the restaurant, it worked when it was the German Cook and it seems to work well for Lahore. I do wish they had a liquor license or at the very least we could bring our own. I was going to give Lahore 2 stars because of tonight's meal but because I have been here before and have had some great food I am giving 3 stars.\nI'll come back to Lahore even after this mediocre review but will order something different.", "author": "David P."}

It should have been the perfect time for cheapo Indian in the Tenderloin (Tenderloindian?). But instead... I lost both legs and three fingers to a biryani gone bad and a poppadom of pure evil beat me and stole my wallet.\n\nEither that, or the waiter here was just fucking weird.\n\nAfter my hot date and I had taken our seats, the waiter walked up to us and gave us our menus and, first thing, asks, \"Where do you live?\"\n\nWe told him. San Francisco. He nodded, but gave us a look like we were totally lying, as if we were tourists who were scared of a non-white person knowing we were tourists because when non-white people run into tourists they abduct, rape, and murder them. That, or they try to sell you postcards. Same thing.\n\nAnyway, since he thought we were tourists, he started telling us how good his restaurant was. According to this waiter, Lahore Karahi has some very good reviews on some website called thaifoodreview.org (I shit you not!). And also, according to this waiter, Yelp *loves* Lahore Karahi. On Yelp, Lahore Karahi has over 150 reviews. On Yelp, Lahore Karahi has a 4.5 star average. I was almost like, \"Dude, on Yelp, Ben P has 27 local photos. On Yelp, Dawn M has regular conniption fits 'cause she thinks Ben P had a fake profile named Mister E. So take that!\"\n\nOnce we were sufficiently briefed about the glories of Lahore Karahi according to the internets, he concluded his speech: \"So um yes. Order whatever you like.\" \n\nWhich was, dear reader, like the most ironic thing he could have said. When he came to take our order, the first thing we asked for was an appetizer of aloo tikki. He said, straight up, \"No.\" He explained, \"If you order that, the chef will have to stop everything he is doing and make them for you. Better you eat samosas. 1 order of samosas, OK? They're better anyway.\" \n\nI saw his point: it *is* pretty whack that a chef at a restaurant has to drop what he's doing (currently: scratching balls) and cook something that you ordered. \n\nThen, we ordered some curries, a biryani, and some naan. Including \"Afghani naan.\" He raised his eyebrows when we ordered it. \"Do you know what that is? You don't want that.\" He then told us what it was, which was pretty much exactly what the menu said it was: naan with some fruits and nuts and cheese. He said that we ordered way too much food, and then he walked off.\n\nA few minutes later, he brought out an order or poppadom. \"DON'T WORRY,\" he said to me, as if I had actually acknowledged his presence in any way. \"IT'S FREE. ON THE HOUSE. You don't have to pay for it.\" I said thanks.\n\nThen he asked us if we knew what it was. We said \"Yup.\" Then he said, \"WHAT is it then?\" \n\n\"Uh, poppadom,\" we said.\n\n\"Good. You know, this is not just a rice cracker. Entire families slave all day to make this that is sitting here before you. The children, the parents, the grandmothers. They sit on the floor all day and roll this dough that is as hard as a marble. Twenty hours, maybe, they work.\"\n\nThere was a pause. As I tried not to pee into my underwear from holding in my laughter, he continued:\n\n\"Nowadays, we have machines. They make it.\" Then he walked off.\n\nFor the next ten minutes or so, Mr. Waiter looked for every possible excuse to return to our table. Since we had already ordered and our food wasn't ready yet, these excuses were limited, and included: refilling our water, or refilling our water. I can say this for Lahore Karahi: my water glass was always 85 percent full. This is mostly a good thing, but it had its downsides: 1) it made it harder to talk shit about the waiter without him hearing because he was always hovering around with a water pitcher, and 2) he refilled our glasses in a different way each time. Seriously, this guy had read a book on how to fill water in different and inconvenient ways. The best one was probably the time he filled my glass and set the pitcher down on the table and then held out his hand that was holding the glass. And held it. And held it. Finally, he coughed *ahem*, and motioned for me to take the glass out of his hand myself.\n\nPretty much the same thing happened with the food. He brought every plate over by itself, even though they were ready at the same time. There were two of us at a table meant for four, but by the time he had brought the third dish, he stopped and wouldn't set it down. \"I can't set this down you have too much food MAKE SOME ROOM FOR ME PLEASE!\" \n\nThe food was fine. Maybe not worth all the hype on thaifoodreviewnation.gov, but definitely nothing to complain about. Although the biryani did taste like pilaf, and I personally prefer poppadom that is made by sobbing child laborers instead of soulless modern machines.\n\nOh, and Mr. waiter, you were right: the Afghani naan tasted like stale fruitcake.", "author": "Ben P."}

Minus my glittery stripper shoes and white fishnet thigh highs with the bows.  I think I still had my lavender jacquard corset on though.  Which might be why I didn't eat as much as usual.  Drugs and tightly laced corsets make it hard to dine heartily I've observed.\nAll seriousness aside, me and four friends had a bunch of good food here on the cheap.  Two of my dining companions were (and are still) assholes and were mildly insulting to the disgruntled curmudgeonly owner which DIDN'T result in our food being spit into.  I think.  If there WAS spit in our foods I can only believe it's a delicious secret ingredient that I'll allow.  The tandoori was tender and yummy, the naan crispy and delicious, the cheese and spinach dish (whose name I forget and am too lazy to look up) is creamy and the aloo gobhi made me extremely happy.  It's a tiny place but the portions are large and the prices are cheap.\nBYOB and be prepared for a hot and spicy night.\nAnd stares.  I've learned that people stare at you when you eat Indian food in elbow length white satin gloves and white sunglasses when it's night-time.  What can I say?

But that food (chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, rice with this and that mixed in, garlic naan) was all very good.  The location's classic TL:  scooted right past the O'Farrell theater and the New Century (and who knows what else) (got a nice shout out from some customers leaving the O'Farrell for the Obama '08 sticker on my '86 Honda Elite 80 cc) (yeah, I'm cool) (not so much).  The owner/chef was terribly nice (hospitable and charming) (by contrast to the more detached service at the also-very-good Shalimar on Polk) (though this ambiance is homier), and he definitely cemented my return visit (he says the fish tandoori is great).  I got the food medium, which was perfect, and it was terribly complex in flavor(fruits and pistachios and all sorts of subtle flavors rolling around).  They have mango lassi (probably one of my all-time favorite drinks).  If the fish and other tandooris are all that on my return visit, this could be five stars.\n\nUpdate:  Hmm.  I did like it, but there have been suggestions on the consuming front (those I consume with) (he I consume with) (yeah, that's right:  the BF) that they (he) prefer(s) Shalimar for certain reasons that perhaps one should refer to delicately and not in a review.  Publicly, well, he thinks Shalimar is better on the merits, too, as in, the quality of the tikki masala and so forth.   So I am back to take-out from Shalimar on Polk (and lunch, too).  \n\nUpdate May 2008:  And now we have found Meftil, which not only delivers to Potrero Hill but also is super high quality.

The flavors here are so different than what I have at Pakwan.  It's so fragrant and flavorful.  I order the usual Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Biryani, Saag Paneer, and Naan.  Everything tasted so good I even ordered extra Naan to wipe the bowls clean.  The time I've ever tasted something so good and flavorful was when I was in London.  Of course nothing ever beats Indian food in London, BUT this sure comes close to it.  The service here is a little bit slow BUT it is all worth the wait.  They cook everything right on the spot.  Just expect your food to be ready in about 30-40 minutes.  Trust me it's worth the wait.  The chef/ owner of Lahore uses the freshest ingredients.  The fried cheese in the Saag Paneer was cooked just right and the chicken and lamb were not dry at all.  It was tender and soft, just the way they should be.  The only downside of Lahore is that their Naan always tend to come to my table with a TON of oil. It's so much oil that the Naan can have it's own pool party. LOL.

This place has a truly authentic atmosphere.  I almost felt as if I were back in the motherland: eating out of a thali with one hand, cold bottle of Limca in the other.  Mmm... I can taste the snake surprise and the chilled monkey brains even now...\n\nHA HA HA HA HA!  I'm just kidding, you stupid Americans.  We Indians stopped eating that junk ages ago, like in the early 90s.  I mean, when that movie came out it was super embarrassing, so we gave it all up, along with tandoori dog and masala camel vagina.\n\nSo what, exactly, can you eat at Lahore Karahi?  I recommend the pakoras, which were outstanding.  The paneer was also quite amazing.  Both had a really subtle, flavorful spiciness that made my tongue cry for mercy and beg for more at the same time.  A few of the dishes are pretty Americanized, which may not be best for a lesson in authenticity.  The cholay was really runny and tasted decidedly different.  Maybe I could grow to like it, but I really enjoy chewing on my chickpeas.  The sesame naan was excellent, but I wasn't a fan of the Afghani naan (Afghani naan, of course, is the new, politically correct name for Kashmiri naan, which, of course, refers to the disputed region straddling the Indo-Pak border; and which, of course, is a terribly impolite topic to bring up between Indians and Pakistanis, even within a forum as seemingly innocuous as a menu, though I'll bet you, dear reader, have precisely no idea how many wars have started over menus; at any rate, I would like to take this opportunity to suggest a new name for our favorite flatbread: LINE OF CONTROL NAAN), which was overly sweet and looked like a flattened fruitcake (oh, the geopolitical irony).  Overall, the food, which comprised the bulk of the judging criteria for this review, earned a well-deserved 4.5 stars on my grading sheet.\n\nI will certainly return should I find myself in the 'Loin and craving solid Indian/Pakistani food.

Minutes after taking my first bite of the Chicken Vindaloo I ordered, the words \"Better than Shalimar\" were bouncing around in my head...\n\nHalfway through lunch I decided that comparing this place to Shalimar was comparing apples to oranges.  It's a COMPLETELY different style of cooking, but one that kicks ass nonetheless.  Where Shalimar tends to blend their Tiki-Masala sauce to contiguous form, Lahore Karahi's vindaloo included larger, visually discernible bits of whatever was used to spice it up.  Nan breads are the size of salad plates instead of steering wheels, with a whole-wheat taste and texture that's more chewy instead of flaky.  One won't last though lunch...order two if you tend to go through a lot of it.  The chicken used is awesome, and cooked perfectly.  It's all tender chunks of white meat that shear effortlessly under your fork....and no drumsticks.  The rice was interesting too....instead of the usual scooped-from-the-steamer Basmati, the chef seasons it with an odd brown spice that gives it a truly interesting texture and  flavor.\n\nDon't let the neighborhood scare you off....the surrounding area can be iffy, but this stretch of O'Farrell between Hyde and Jones seems to be something of a DMZ that the 'loin's indigenous army of street-urchins steers clear of.\n\nThe entire place is a one-man-show, and he's a heck of a nice guy.  I got the usual warning of  \"Vindaloo is spicy\" that's de-rigour for white boys...and he winced visibly with a smile on his face when I ordered it \"extra hot\".  Heat-wise, this guy delivers.  It wasn't the cheyenne-type burn you get at most places, but one that comes on slow.  Regardless, halfway through lunch I was sweating bullets....and loving it.\n\nLahore Karahi is a must-visit for anybody who feels they've done-it-all on the South-Asian food circuit.  It's truly unlike anything else I've ever had, and it's deviation from the norm is a rare example of coming out on top after breaking rank with one's peers.", "author": "Mike W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-04-19", "description": "I had not heard of this place before trying it.  I was walking down O'Farrell looking for a place to eat late (after 10:45p) on a weekday night (Lahore is open until 11p).  Mekong Thai -- which I've never tried but have wanted to -- was closed except for takeout.  This was one of the only places open.\n\nMy initial impression was that this place is filmy and grimy.  This doesn't necessarily dissuade, as sometimes these hole in the wall places are quite a pleasant surprise.  Additionally, the reviews in the window from Yelp and the newspaper made it seem like a perennial favorite.  Furthermore, I've eaten at numerous grimy places overseas without issue.  There is a difference between grimy and dirty.  This was the former.  Prices were cheap.\n\nDespite the numerous reviews that report lousy service, my experience was diametrically different.  True -- I was the only table when I arrived, but there was such a graciousness about their willingness to accommodate.  There was no \"it's almost 11p, please don't eat here.\"  I was not rushed.  They were happy to serve and happy I was there.  Another couple entered just after 11p, and they were also greeted with warmth and openness instead of disdain and contempt.  It was a most pleasant experience, with my water glass constantly being refilled every time it was empty and always with a smile.  The waiter even spoke to me about his hometown in Pakistan, its size, and his pride and humility of his origins.  The gentleman who appeared to be the owner spoke to me about other entrees I might enjoy should I return.  If every experience at a restaurant were this positive in terms of service, it would be utopic.  I acknowledge that service may be markedly different during peak times, and this may help to explain the disparity between my experience and those of other reviewers. \n\nMy primary reservation with Lahore Karahi is with the food.  It's really not bad, but I'm confused about all of the five-star reviews this place has received.  The vegetable samosas were served piping hot and not greasy, but the filling was a kind of indistinguishable mush and not evenly cooked.  The tikka masala was thin and had an institutional flavor, as if the sauce itself wasn't prepared in-house but came from a can.  The onion kulcha -- normally one of my favorites -- was not fluffy but rather dense and filled with what appeared to be (by taste) onions that came from a jar (similar to those found in 7/11's hot dog condiment bar).  It is possible that they were chopped in the food processor (which was on the counter and constantly being used -- but I think to blend ingredients together, not necessarily prepare recipes from scratch).\n\nThe restaurant has an open kitchen -- not the kind in the chic modern hip places that is the current trend -- but rather as if one is eating in their kitchen.  You see mostly everything.  What I saw, principally, was that a lot of their food comes from cans.  It appeared as if little was fresh.  I don't know, but it makes sense from the way the food tasted, its texture, and quality.  One can typically tell when respectable Indian food is made fresh and in-house.  I'm sorry: this food seemed like something that could be found at the supermarket in the ethnic foods aisle.  This seemed more akin to frozen pizza:  it could never compare to freshly made and tossed dough, homemade sauce, and crispy fresh toppings.  I would be surprised to learn that this kitchen makes its sauces from scratch.  Of the multitude of Indian food I've eaten, this was among the least fresh preparation I've ever encountered.  It wasn't consciously crafted.  That being said, I've had worse.\n\nQuality aside, this place is inexpensive, and may in fact be the cheapest Indian restaurant I've been to outside of India.  Perhaps that is part of its appeal.\n\nThis is one restaurant where I think the Yelping community has simply gotten it wrong.  A 3-star review I could understand, but 4.5 stars???  It's unsupportable and frankly irrational.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Reminded me of a python sketch (cheese shop:)\nIn chronological order:\nIts a bit of a dump but no matter, I can maybe get in touch with my young, days of enjoying roughing it in funky places - as long as the food impresses.\nNo wine or beer, fine except nor can you bring any in, even if you pay corkage, which frankly for a curry house is an immediate removal of a star in my book.\n Menu, for me a bit limited but they had a bunch of vegetarian dishes that I personally wasn't that interested in.\nPopadoms while we take in the menu? Dont have them any more.\nOK, we ordered: Lamb vindaloo,(not too crazy hot)  tandoori chicken leg, Chicken Tikka masala, lime pickle, garlic and Sesame nan.\nThe Tandoori chicken was best. Sizzling hot, tasty dry marinade though I doubt it ever saw a tandoori oven. The lamb Vindaloo was beef, I had asked for not too hot but it came out completely emasculated -possibly my fault-should have said nothing but I was thinking of an English vindaloo heat level. It was also just kind of granular texture sauce with a mainly stock cube kind of taste. not at all good. Tikka masala was OKish but probably on a par with the worst I've had, again with a granular texture, sauce with no really interesting flavor notes and it was pepper hot. Hotter than the vindaloo, which is not to style. \nThe Nans were disappointing. They look like flat crust pizza in shape and texture. Confirming no tandoori oven but even so, just flat like a chapati. Flavor was OK. Instead of lime pickle, we got mango chutney - whatever at this stage. \nWhen the bill came I was curious if they thought I ordered beef but no, Lamb Vindaloo was stated so I couldn't let that pass entirely and told the kid waiter. He vehemently insisted not and that beef wouldn't be allowed in the restaurant for apparently religious dietary reasons which was odd since it is a Pakistani restaurant and why would you expect it to be strictly Hindu? But mostly it was just funny how this 18 year old kid was insisting to this lamb loving 50 year old that we couldn't tell the difference. I believe he believed it was Lamb but that hardly excuses such a basic error/apparent deception. Good job I wasn't Hindu!  So why all these good reviews? I think it must be a large volume of younger clientele that really don't know or have had, any better. The flavor and prep of the food just wasn't fresh and vibrant with the exciting spicy notes this cuisine can offer.

This is so far my favorite Indian restaurant to go to.  To put it in perspective for some of you, I have been to 6 different places in the city and I know there are way more out here.  But of these 6, the food here was the best especially for its price.\n\nThe food was the right amount of spicy for me (maybe a little more since we asked for mild) and it was flavorful too.  Unlike other Indian restaurants, the portions of meat in their dishes are pretty decent.  And I really like their mango drink.\n\nThe service can be pretty bad.  I think the waiter thinks he can be rude, because he knows there are 5 other parties waiting out the door to take our seats.  The place is also really cramped where the back of my chair was touching the back of the other table's chair (which was kind of annoying since it was some hyperactive kid behind me).  \n\nOverall, I am very happy with this place.

This curry tasted so horrible that I did not even want to finish - I wonder what makes it \"creamy\" but NO, that's NOT curry!!!  That is not Tikka Masala!!!  \n\nThis may sound arrogant but I just do not think it is real Indian/Pakistani food.\n\nLassi was way too sweet although the server mixed with water before bringing it to me.  \n\nThe first time I had Lamb Vindaloo but this was not good either - it just below being OK, it tasted too sour for some reason.  \n\nTheir naans are certainly OK, could be better than other places but for me, not better than Shalimar's one.  It may be better than Pakwan's naan though.  But my garlic naan should be simpler than naan + garlic + lots of spice mixes.

Granted, it's Indian, so you have trouble deciphering what you are eating anyway - but there was one easily recognizable thing in our rice - a dead beetle, antlers and legs and whatever all hanging out and chilling, right where I had grabbed a spoonful. Thank God, I didn't look at it because I would have had a fit and ran out of the place - my friend found it and went to show the owner, who acted like a cooked beetle in rice was nothing new.

Both waiters \ntook off almost immediately after we sat down.  I guess you get what you pay for - the bill was about 20 bucks. \n\nI know one star looks harsh, but after reading a bunch of other reviews, I honestly kept an open mind, and gave this place a chance.  For cheap Indian food, go to Chutney.  It's just around the corner, and has consistently been an awesome spot.  \n\nWish my experience was better at Lahore.  Avoid this mess.", "author": "Steve C."}

It wasn't worth the $10 per ticket we paid for. Anyways, I was pretty hungry when we decided to go to Lahore Karahi for an early dinner about 5:30pm. The place is pretty small maybe seats about 30 and only a few people were eating when we got in. We sat ourselves and ordered right away. I was surprised that it was an open kitchen. I actually got to see the chef/owner prepare our dishes. Big plus. Ordered the veggie samosas, grilled platter, chicken tikki masala, lamb korma and mixed veggies. Our waiter ask if we like it mild, medium or spicy. Of course, we went for spicy. Also, had two regular naans, one onion and one garlic. Highlights were the samosas, chicken tikki masala, mixed veggies, grilled platter and the regular naan. Lamb korma was not to my taste but the girlfriend enjoyed it. The onion and garlic naan were not worth the extra price and the garlic naan didn't seem to have fresh garlic in it. The regular naan were plenty good: crispy outside and airy inside. Grilled platter had tandoori chicken, lamb roti and two lamb kebabs. All were flavored very well. The chicken masala did not have as much tomato flavor as other places but it's good nonetheless. Veggie samosas were pretty big and delicious, spicy too! Goes well with the mint yogurt and tamarind sauces that you get. I like to eat them mixed together. Another surprising thing, other than the open kitchen, was that the food was not overly oily. \n\nI would definitely head here again when I'm in the area. A nice mom and pop feel to it. The chef/owner asked what we thought of the food, a very nice touch. I am a sucker for those type of gestures. But the best part of the dinner? The price. $45.50 with tax and all four of us were full. Good place to go after shopping at Union Square and the price will still leave you with money to shop after, if you don't go into a food coma that is.", "author": "Andy B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-06", "description": "Lahore Karahi was incredible. It is the reviews on Yelp which led me to try this place.\n\nI have been an avid Shalimar-er for the past 4 years. I literally go three nights per week. A few weeks ago, I decided to engage in some Indian/Pakistani food adultery and tried Chutney. Nothing at Chutney even came close to Shalimar. The gravy just was not there. Ahh--but that is for a different review!\n\nHaving ventured away from Shalimar once, I figured cheating on it twice was no biggy. I pass Lahore Karahi on my drive down O'Farrell every time I go to Shalimar. I have been curious about it for some time.\n\nParking was easier than at Shalimar even though the two are separated by just a block or two.\n\nWalked into a restaurant with about 6 tables at about 7pm. There were only two couples in the restaurant. The server and the chef seem to be on equal levels within the Lahore Karahi hierarchy -- both look to be men in their 50s, both are jovial and extremely kind. It was the chef from whom I ordered --\n\nI say:\n\n\"One cholay\"\n\"One Saag Paneer\"\n\"Do you have Nihari?\" (I had read good things about the Nihari here on Yelp but could not find it on the menu). The chef smiles back and says\n\"Yes, for you we have Nihari\"\n\"Great! One Chicken Tikka Masala\"\n\"One Chicken Boti\"\nChef interjects: \"My chicken boti is excellent, but try the fish tandoori -- it is really special\". Methinks let's give it a whirl. The chef adds that the fish (sea bass) is fresh.\n\"Oh, and one plain naan, no butter.\"\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, the tandoori fish has arrived. Oh man, was it good. I don't usually enjoy dishes like this made with seafood, but I am in LOVE with this dish. It comes on a hot skillet, simmering, covered in a zestily-dressed lettuce. At first I was avoiding the lettuce as though it were a garnish. After a few bites I started mixing the lettuce with the fish -- now THAT is the way to have it! This was one of the most incredible dishes I have ever had. I think the chicken boti at Shalimar is divine -- literally made by gods. This is equally good, but completely different -- different spices and, of course, fish instead of chicken.\n\nNext come the other dishes, minus the cholay which never came-- the chef must not have heard me order it -- which is just fine since I ordered way too much food.\n\nThe Nihari was incredible. Much tangier than at Shalimar and Chutney and, instead of being a block of beef in a stew-broth (as the dish is prepared at Shalimar and Chutney), the entire dish is shredded (and not-so-shredded) beef in a wonderful gravy. Very little sauce because the beef IS the sauce. It was incredible, though admittedly heavy.\n\nThe saag paneer (other restaurants call it palak paneer) was equally good. It was cream-based, but not too creamy. The flavor was out-of-this-world, much more complex than what one finds at Shalimar. As one reviewer wrote below, all the dishes at Lahore Karahi are something of an art -- not simple, but very complex and balanced. The paneer (cheese) in this dish was definitely homemade and quite different from any other paneer I have tasted -- it had almost a crisp exterior but was butter soft, almost melted inside. Imagine well-roasted marshmallows. That was the texture.\n\nThe bangan bharta was also incredible. I usually find bangan bharta to be one of the so-so dishes at Indian/Pakistani restaurants -- always good, but never something I am dying to eat. This was different. This was good enough that one might just come to Lahore Karahi for this single dish.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was the disappointment of the bunch. It was great, certainly better than at Chutney and Naan'n'Curry (like it is at these restaurants, the CTM was cream-based at Lahore Karahi), but it was not orgasmic-kiss-the-floor-take-a-bath-in-it-good like at Shalimar. It was much more normal and non-special. Still excellent, though.\n\nThe naan came very heavily buttered -- tasted great, but clearly some of my order instructions were lost in the kitchen!\n\nThe chai was also quite good (and free). It was spiced so as to have a  much more interesting and flower-like flavor than the chai of Shalimar, N'n'C or Chutney.\n\nAfter paying, on my way out, the chef and server INSISTED that I try their rice pudding, which was incredible. They dished it out for me on the house and watched me eat it with glee. It was like white grout (for laying bricks). Incredible. What gracious hosts!\n\nOverall this place is excellent, incredible, and I would return to have any one of the dishes I ordered (except maybe the chicken tikka masala) -- I would also return just to see the gracious smile of the chef and the server. So kind.\n\nLahore Karahi is an excellent place with which to supplement Shalimar, and will surely become part of my weekly restaurant regimen. It's not better than Shalimar but certainly not worse. Just different. Each dish is so good and so different from Shalimar that my mood will determine which place I visit!", "author": "John G."}

Chicken Boti (portions of white chicken breast meat marinated and tandoori oven'd) come out like fajitas on a sizzling platter on a bed of veggies. Very nice. Naan was pretty good, although not the best I've had. Lamb vindaloo was good, but could have been a little creamier. Daal was pretty good, no complaints. \nMinus one star for the service. I mean really. There wasn't that many people in there, I had to ask twice for doggy bags, and if you want something you need to make eye contact with the waiter or you will likely be waiting a long time. I'm well aware this is not a \"nicer\" dining establishment but if waiting tables is such a pain in the ass, they should go to the Shalimar method, where you order at the counter and then they bring it out to you. Strange but it works better than this. I also think the food is better there so I won't say Lahore is not good because it is but my personal preference is for Shalimar. I would definitely reccomend Lahore to any Pakistani / Indian food afficionado though as you may find the flavors superior to other similar joints (and that is what it is, by the way, a joint). \nI went to clear up a nasty cold I got and it did the trick.

It was a pretty tight fit but it wasn't too bad. \n\nI really wanted to try their samosas but they were out!! so he recommended this potato pattie appetizer so we went with it. We also ordered chicken tikka masala (of course), an eggplant dish with tomatos, all with potato naan and sesame naan. While we waited, they came over with this cracker like thing which i guess is equivalent to bread and butter that other restaurants usually come with. Then the potato patty app came and mMMm...it was good!! highly recommend it! unfortunately i don't know the proper name of this but it is described on the menu. Right away everything else came out and of course there wasn't enough room for it on our tiny table. If you ever ate at naan and curry, the naan here is just soooo much better. Small, but tastes so much better!! Both curry dishes had this sweet taste to it. One con about the food is that we requested to make both dishes spicy but i didn't feel like it was spicy at all. At first i thought it was just me since i eat so much spicy food my sensitively to spices are low. But my partner is usually quite sensitive to spiciness and he said he didn't think it was spicy at all. So that was a little disappointing.\n\nBut all in all, very good! Food is better than Naan and curry. Definitely better service than Naan and curry.

To that effect, we hit Lahore, which had gotten good reviews on Yelp and was relatively near our hotel.  When we walked in we knew we were in the right place: filthy, crap all over the floor, the carpet and tile stained and we were glad the lighting was bad so we couldn'ts ee too closely in the corners. The signs of good Indian food and we were not disappointed.  We tried several things (after they were out of both samosa and aloo tikki) we ordered aloo paratha, baigan bhartha, aloo gobi and saag paneer, rice  and naan.  We took it back to the hotel eagerly anticipating the greasy meals. And they were just as greasy as we expected and just as tasty (with a few exceptions). Aloo paratha was kind of like wonder bread with potatoes stuck in it (not so good). The eggplant was smoky and flavorful, no peas and limited tomatoes. The aloo gobi was just swimming in grease but sooooo tasty and cooked just right with a bit of a bite to the caulfiower but the potatoes fully cooked. The saag paneer was excellent too (no tomato), lots of spinach, smooth, creamy and tasty.  The naan was almost inedible. But the real surprise was the incredibly excellent rice.  And all we ordered was \"rice\".  But it was like a pilaf. I usually don't eat rice, but this stuff was so flavorful I could have just eaten that.  And, we had enough leftovers for three or four more servings (and we ate far more than we needed to because it was so yummy!).  Now, I do have a caution. The food gives me an upset stomach--not terrible but noticable (too much grease? too many germs? who knows) . . . but that's something I'm willing to put up with for such tasty food.

What kind of service can you expect?\n\nAnyway, the food here is probably the best indian you can find in the city and the prices are phenomenally low for what they serve. If you go to a restaurant like Al-Hamra in the Mission, you'll pay 6.99 for Chicken Tikka Masala that has the consistency of a bisque that is as bland as it is runny. If you go to Lahore, you can get yourself a true Chicken Tikka for the same price and it is a thick, flavorful curry that is both spicy and sweet. (pick Butter Chicken if you're not into sweet CTM) \n\nStop going to gross Indian places that serve pre-made, watery curries and go here and get the real stuff.", "author": "Hal C."}

I used the site to help me find a well-rated Indian restaurant within a 5-block radius, and then I dove right in, blind faith.  I called ahead and the food wasn't quite ready, which was fine because I was early, and in any event I appreciated having a few minutes to scope the place out.  There were like two trendy city couples eating there, so I took it as a sign that this place pulls from the locals, meaning it can't really suck too bad, because there's a good amount of Indian competition in the Tenderloin.  Although, given that logic, Chutney would be on the outs, and clearly it's not.  Actually, I don't know where the people who eat at Chutneys come from.  Must be from some place where the Indian food sucks.  But I digress.  This guy, the guy in the picture, he is actually there slaving over the grill, just like in the picture.  So there's some truth in advertising there.  Cool.  I appreciated that my bag had been well-packed, and was totally impressed by the total amount of the bill.  It was like $24 and change for Chicken Korma, Aloo Gobi, Chicken Boti (Tandoor boneless chicken), rice and naan.  Value!  For me the Chicken Korma is like a barometer dish I use for sizing-up Indian restaurants.  It's not that any of them make it well.  They don't.  It's that you can tell a lot by how they \"interpret\" Chicken Korma, which is a hard dish to make.  I had the best Chicken Korma of my whole life in Marbella, believe it or not.  For the record, it's supposed to be thick and milky and betray just a suggestion of coconut.  Overdo on the coconut and you wind up with some common, heavy-handed Thai concoction.  Whew, I'm really having a hard time reigning-in this review, lol.  The Chicken Korma at Lahore Karahi tasted like Mexican food.  I swear you could have served me that sauce on my enchilada, and I would have scarcely noticed anything was amiss.  Not bad, mind you, just not Indian food.  Which was odd, given the authenticity of the guy in the picture and all that.  The boneless chicken was dry (sorry, honey, I lied when I said my piece was juicy).  It was really dry.  It was so dry there were bits of chicken that hurt me inside my mouth.  The Aloo Gobi was indistinct, but that may just be because it tasted a lot like the Korma.  There were two highlights, however!  The rice is funny-looking and brown and tons of fun.  Order 2!  And the naan was gummy but totally delish.  Order 3!", "author": "Jack M."}

Yes, the service is slow and one waiter can be a bit flippant.  No, there is no beer or wine list, but I think that's a bit of a positive because it allows you to bring your own.  Gudhu, the chew-owner is very nice and if you come between meal times, he'll often come out to the tables and will sometimes even offer specials.  Now, the food:  this is the only Indian restaurant I've been to that is completely distinguishable from the others.  It's not just that the meat is cooked correctly, but that the spices used are a different blend that seems omnipresent in Indian and Pakastani restaurants around here.  The food is generally quite spicy, but that's right up my alley.  The lamb vindaloo is the best Indian dish I've ever had.  Even dishes I usually feel apathetic about, such as saag paneer is excellent here.  I have been here about a half dozen times at least, and I have not once tasted a single item that was less than fantastic.  Their desserts are all amazing.  The kheer is thick enough a spoon stands upright in it.  On the rare occasion that they make carrot pudding it is dream-like.  Even that breath-freshening mixture they near the door is way better than average.", "author": "Daniel F."}

Whatever we've had has been excellent (including last night's lamb vindaloo!)  I'm  giving 4 instead of 5 stars only because service just wasn't quite there last night.  Granted they were super busy but it took a long while to place our order and almost an hour in total before we got our food.  But again, once it arrived it was excellent and we weren't in a big rush, so all good.  Can bring in beer/wine - go to Econo Market (or something like that) right nearby.", "author": "Jim K."}

(The bf is a Brit so I like to think that he knows his Indian food...)  We walked over there from our hotel- there was no wait when we arrived since they just had us sit at a table where three men were already sat and eating.  I guess good use of table space?  One big turnoff for us was the mound of trash next to the door.  There were at least seven plastic bags filled with trash.  Would it have been too much to ask for them to not leave them in visible sight?  As we've never visited here before, I have no idea if this is standard practice for them.  The food:  excellent.  We ordered the vegetable biryani, chicken vindaloo, chicken korma, and sesame naan.  The biryani was delicious!! Perfectly spiced.  The vindaloo (which we ordered spicy) was HOT!!  I was definitely sweating by the end of the meal.  I would definitely check this place out for the food.  I really would've given this place four stars except I had to take one off for the trash situation.", "author": "sunny k."}

And Guddu is probably the most sincere, warm (and of course accomplished) chef I've known. The stars don't do justice. For the vegetarians out there, the place doesn't disappoint if you order the Lahore Chikkar Chole (my absolute favorite), Shahi Panneer (Guddu makes his own panneer!), Baingan Bartha's and plain Rotis. Sometimes Guddu will offer his 'special' dessert not on the menu, if you go often enough :) Great place, the only place I recommend for Indian food in the city.", "author": "D A."}

They are indeed made from scratch  (a labor intensive process) by owner'/chef \"GUDDU\". Ambika is correct in observing that Samosas in other Pakistani and Indian restaurants are purchased from outside.  The pakoras and samosas at Lahore Karahi Labor intensive and worth waiting for (but NOT 45 minutes). Chef Guddu also makes his own yoghurt and cheese (paneer), from SCRATCH. Please give LK another try, it is a cut above the others if ONLY for the FABULOUS samosas which, again I repeat, are made from scratch.", "author": "Claudia S."}

Just a couple blocks down the hill from my office, which Antigone G. has mentioned in previous reviews is an area definitely barren of lunch dining options (about the only reason I would actually want to office downtown).  I've been going here for a month (two?) since first noticing the Yelp reviews.  Just came back from lunch with Valerie D., 'Karahi didn't disappoint.  I would suggest coming in early (we did) and you will get personal, friendly, unhurried service from the owner/chef himself, but I've noticed as the lunch crowd started to show up service slowed down (and especially noticed this time).  It's not the kind of place to go if you expect to be waited upon hand and foot, and if a hole-in-the wall restaurant _doesn't_ sound attractive to you then again this isn't the place for you.  I do feel he (the owner, cannot recall his name at the moment) could use more staff and not ruin anything, on the other hand the food is so good and the prices perfectly fine that I don't feel I should suggest messing with something that obviously works on the off chance it might be ruined.  Anyhow, I like 'Karahi enough that I did the unthinkable; after being a longtime yelp Lurker, allowing other yelpers to do all the hard work of finding the best places, I broke down, created an account, and chimed in with another 5-star rating.  I like this guy, and I hope the word of mouth continues to spread for him.", "author": "- Joshua -."}

Being a big fan of both Shalimar and Naan N Curry I was extremely disappointed.  The flavors were horribly out of balance - the tandoori dish lacked salt and the chicken karahi was too sweet. And the seekh kebab was a dry dense mass that needed to be washed down with a ton of chutney.  Needless to say, I will not be returning.", "author": "Felice L."}

I've tried many restaurants in San Fran based off yelp reviews and never been steered wrong. I really wanted to like this place, a fantastic Indian restaurant with in walking distance of my home... what a dream! Sadly, it was not to be. We ordered a an Aloo Matter and Butter Chicken as well as various naan and samosas. The samosas were ok, the naan was fine as well. The butter chicken was passable but nothing fantastic to warrent the glowing reviews seen here. The real disappointment for this place came with the Aloo Matter, for some reason it was sweet!!! I dont think I've ever had a sweet curry before and aloo matter is my staple dish that I've ordered at countless Indian restaurants.  It tasted like someone had spilled a full cup of sugar into it. It was the most disgusting curry I've ever eaten, I couldn't bring myself to eat more then four bites. \n\nI was so disappointed, finding good Indian in this city is so difficult. =( All the great reviews on this place lead me to wonder if Indian is too subjective of a  cuisine to trust reviews on yelp.", "author": "Anna M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-16", "description": "I've never experienced such horrible, super slow service as I did at Lahore Karahi.  It was like a Seinfeld episode, a cross between the one where they wait forever at a chinese restaurant and when they try to order from the soup nazi.  Honestly I would have preferred \"no soup for you!\" right off the bat and our night would have been so much less frustrating.  We could have just hopped over to Shalimar or one of the numerous other good indian joints nearby.\n\nIt started with about a 30 minute wait to get a table.  Totally not unreasonable, and besides we used the time wisely to go to a bar around the corner and also pick up some beers for our dinner.  Once we got seated however we were quite hungry.  This is where the trouble started.  It took a solid 30 minutes for someone to come over and take our order.  We tried to flag down the owner who was constantly shuffling around the tables but he would just avert his gaze and ignore us.  By the time we ordered we were all starving.  We were hoping some of our appetizers or at least naan would come out in say, 10-15 minutes, but no luck.  We had a very serious debate about taking some of the leftovers from other tables.  The worst part was the psychological torture.  We didn't know when (if?) the food was going to come - we could see the tiny kitchen, other tables that look like they have been waiting a long time, and other tables that you could swear arrived after you and already have their food.  On the other hand we've already invested a lot of time and patience and the food should be here any minute, right?  Wrong.  It took 40 minutes after ordering to get our first dish.  Also: they didn't bring one of the appetizers we ordered.  Anytime we asked a simple question we got lectured / berated for asking.  There weren't enough glasses of water for our table because they were \"out of clean glasses\".\n\nI'm not going to dwell too much on the food because if you've read any other reviews you already know it is really good.  It was indeed very good.  But its hard to be completely objective when your leather shoelaces would have also tasted pretty good.  \n\nSo.. at least be warned it could be an all-night affair at Lahore Karahi.  Definately don't arrive hungry and don't make solid plans for later.  Don't be fooled by thinking it doesn't look that busy.  I agree good food is worth the wait and this was some of the best indian I've had, and about half the price of other indian places.  And I wasn't expecting top service from a cheap restaurant in the tenderloin.  But for me, the service was so incredibly slow and frustrating that it was totally not worth it.", "author": "Bill S."}

We picked up drinks from the next-door market and the dude supplied us with a bottle opener when he asked. Very courteous service; a Mexican dude is the cook, and they treat him like family. We ordered the vegetable pakora, butter chicken, aloo mattar, a couple orders of rice and a garlic naan. GREAT food. the green chutney here is absolutely amazing. When all was said and done, we still were hungry, so I asked the guy for a chicken vindaloo. He said \"right now?\" and I was like \"yes, please!\" So the food comes 5 minutes later (the service is ridiculously quick, that's a plus), and it's lamb instead of chicken. Best vindaloo ever, and it turned out that the lamb was a good contrast--it was good quality lamb, too. The presentation is real homey -- the food comes in bowls that look like my cereal bowls at home. The kitchen area is right there in front of you, so the whole thing is real honest. You can see what's cooking right there and watch your food being prepared. Also, there's vintage, poor-quality bollywood on the TV. major yay. go here.", "author": "Ethan K."}
