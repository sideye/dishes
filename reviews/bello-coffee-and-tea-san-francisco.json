{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-01", "description": "First time stopping by this coffee shop two weeks ago. I grabbed an iced green tea and worked here for a bit. I would say this is probably the best coffee shop to work out of in the Glen Park downtown neighborhood area; on a Saturday morning there was a steady stream of customers coming in and out, but it never felt overcrowded. They have free Wi-Fi here. It's not super quiet here because the nearby intersection can be quite busy and the door is left open, but grab a pair of headphones and you'll be good. Also, sometimes ambient sound can be soothing, right?\n\nThis place is also walking distance from Glen Park BART, in case you don't live in the neighborhood! (though in that case, why are you really coming to Glen Park, lol - not to say you shouldn't, though - it's cute) I don't actually end up in downtown Glen Park too often unless I'm headed to the BART, but if I'm looking for a good local coffee shop to work out of for a bit because I want to get out of the house, Bello is a solid choice.", "author": "Brian W."}

The lovely owner Jane was offering me a gratis beverage of my choice whenever I bought a card of around $20 value. \n\nThen her husband got really cheap with me and said I could only have a small coffee for these purchases.  So I stopped for a while.  That was big turnoff to me as a very small business owner myself, trying to support a neighborhood business.  \n\nI recently took up the practice of gifting my guests again with gift cards, and the husband again got rude and belligerent with me yesterday.  It took him so long to figure out my gift card balance, and then to add the remaining value to the card that I wished to purchase, that I asked him if I should wait as he told me a line was forming.  Well, I was purchasing a $15 gift card!  He asked me what I wanted and I said a small mocha.  I thought he was gifting that to me for my purchase.  I told him that, and he said \"No.\"  I told him there was no line behind me and he said, \"They cannot wait.  They left already.\"\n\nI'll try to spend as little as possible here in the future and no more gift cards!", "author": "Leslie G."}

My usual go-to is the Vanilla Rose Latte. It gives a you sweet but not too over-powerful drink. Another close second is the Lavender White Mocha.

Me too as sometimes I randomly get off at Glen Park just to find something to eat, shop at Canyon Market, or, you guessed it, have a cup of joe here. It's a good place to hang for a while if the seats are not all taken, which on Saturday afternoons, is often the case.\n\nI've been a couple of times now, and I ordered the $4.20 Vanilla Rose Latte both times, quite a luscious elixir and not too sweet (photo: http://bit.ly/2hiKkct).

They definitely have the standard cafe pastries in case your sweet tooth isn't completely satisfied with your libation of choice. Mine was though. Maybe not as satisfying is the service.

I wanted to explore this area again since I used to come to this area when I was younger and I wanted to see what has changed/stayed the same. Not sure if I remember this coffee shop years ago, but I'm glad I stumbled upon it! I came here on a Sunday at around 8:30am, and the place was bustling. There were 2 workers (one cashier/pastry server and the other was the coffee maker), and even though it was just them to, the service was quick and efficient. I was debating whether to get the vanilla rose latte or the lavender white mocha and I opted for the lavender white mocha which was DELICIOUS. The lavender flavor was really pronounced but not overpowering, just enough flavor to make you really notice it. Overall, this is a great place to grab a coffee or a quick bite to eat (pastries wise), and I will definitely come back to try the vanilla rose latte!", "author": "Lisa C."}

I'm not a stickler, but dude was cordial only to the patrons before and after me (small talk, suggestions, obvious shift in tone). I wanted to make sure this vanilla rose latte didn't have other ingredients containing milk, but the middle-aged Asian man taking the order was obviously bothered that I didn't just choose a different milk option. I even clarified that I wanted to make sure that there was no milk, since their lavender white mocha would have milk in it, but he treated me like an imbecile.

None were particularly remarkable except for the beautiful rainbows that fall across the countertop in the evening sunlight - the result of a well-placed, beautiful coffee contraption in the window. I've lived in San Francisco for a long time, so I'm used to rude service being trendy... but I have never had a cordial interaction with any of their employees. The coffee is okay, but I had a bad enough experience there to officially review this place as just \"meh.\"\n\nWe are vegan, and my daughter likes to sip a steamed soy milk while my husband and I drink our cup'o. As we were ordering, the guy behind the counter was way more interested in telling his coworker a story than acknowledging our existence. I told him \"soy\" two times because I didn't want him to ignore this particular detail - our order wasn't complicated, just two coffees and the kid's steamer. Sure enough my daughter took one sip and looked at me in horror as she blurted out \"what is this?!\" I opened the lid and it was unmistakably as white as you would expect pus-infused calf hormone growth formula to be. I was angry but calm when I told him I'd asked for soy and he'd given my child cow juice. His first reaction was defense, saying he'd given me soy, but when he looked for himself he did rescind. \"Oh yeah, hope she's not allergic!\" was his fake-jovial reply. SMH. This guy is a jerk. My daughter burst out crying and apologizing to the cows.... She was 2 - a 2 year old with more compassion than the guy working there. Ugh, now I get my coffee from Canyon Market.

At many a joint, lavender flavored items always somehow fall short for me - weak or nonexistent in floral aroma and flavor. Bello doesn't disappoint. Overall very smooth and delicious afternoon beverage. \n\nThe space itself is just the right size for a cafe - not too big and not too small. Warm colored walls and a fun cold brew machine as decor. Plenty of seating options - stools at a bar/near the window, tables, comfy looking armchairs. The BART (Glen Park) is also conveniently located a 30 second walk away. \n\nGood prices for specialty drinks (a 20oz lavender white mocha is only $5!) whereas most cafes I go to charge $5 for a regular latte.

The fake-tasting \"cream cheese spread\" continues, and the counter service -- always a bit hit and miss -- has gone from so-so to downright bad. The other day I went in for a weekend brunch and ordered a bagel, a slice of quiche and coffee. I place my order and stand their waiting with money in hand while the guy at the counter gets my quiche, which he needs to warm up, and stands their holding it while proceeding to engage in a long conversation with another patron about some sort of sound equipment they were comparing. All the time I'm standing there, not saying anything, but looking right at him hoping he'll notice he has a customer still waiting. Eventually he breaks off his conversation, rings me up and gets my coffee. Progress. But...\n\nA few minutes later my bagel is ready, but not the quiche. That happens sometimes, so no big deal. As I start eating my bagel I hear the toaster oven in which they warm the quiche give its little bell signal that says it's done. No reaction from the counter staff. I wait a couple more minutes and clearly no one is paying attention to it -- both people on duty were taking other orders, etc. Finally, after a couple more minutes -- bagel almost done, coffee getting cold -- I get up and politely ask the second employee on duty, a young woman, if there was any sign of the quiche I'd ordered. She looks at the toaster oven, realizes it's ready, puts it on a plate and gives it to me without a word -- no \"thank you for waiting,\" \"sorry we got a bit behind,\" or anything of the sort.\n\nI'm visiting this joint less and less often.

I am very particular about my coffee... my philosophy is that an espresso drink should...well...taste like espresso.  Sounds simple, but 99% of coffee shops tend to put a lot of stuff in their drinks that just end up masking the flavor instead of complimenting it.  Upon walking into the quaint little coffee shop I see a large and perfectly maintained roaster to the right of the entrance. This quickly filled me with hope because any coffee shop that takes the time and effort to roast their own bean in store generally take the time to blend and balance their different espresso drinks.  The second ray of hope is when I see on the menu that all drinks are made with double shots of espresso.\n\nI quickly order at small White Mocha and wow, easy 5 out of 5!  The espresso flavor was strong and bold with a nice roasted earthiness right off the bat.  The white mocha flavor is there as an accent at the finish adding more of a rich creamy flavor instead of a sugary one.  Perfectly balanced!  It really doesn't get much better than this. .Also handy dandy are the optional non spill lids.  You know they must cost the coffee shop extra but you can tell they spare no expense for a great experience. http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AeAZNgLKYX3BiRMaeHwCOA/l.jpg\n\nThis ranks up there next to The Conservatory of Coffee in LA as my favorite coffee spots.", "author": "Rob P."}

Every time I go! \n\nDelicious pastries, great tea, great baristas who are really good at their jobs. I love Bello in every way. I was talking to another customer one day, and she said it was the second best espresso she had had IN THE US, which I thought was fantastic.  I guess she drinks a lot of espresso!\n\nI just have to add, the reviewer Ashley K said the lattes were \"too milky\" and tasted  \"watered down\"... I'm wondering why she didn't order hers in a short cup? That would keep the ratio of espresso to milk at roughly one to one? Or order a Cortado? Or a Macchiato? The fabulous baristas at Bello have heard of any espresso drink known to man. They can make it stronger, girl. Trust me. Don't knock the biz cause you don't know how to order!", "author": "D M."}

My latte came out fairly quickly, which was nice..and it smelled good!  But once I tried it, I was unimpressed.  The vanilla rose syrup was very over-powering and much too sweet.  I guess I could have ordered less syrup, but I didn't know.  I wanted to taste more of the coffee flavor and less syrup/milk combination.  I couldn't even finish it.\n\nSo meh, this place is whatever based on the coffee alone.  Other things I did like though in the 10 minutes I was there were: \n\n*location - near the freeway, decent area, next to a nice little market, found parking easily\n*inside - nice decor, not too small, some seating, clean\n*fast service\n*price - not expensive\n*they have food - bagels, muffins, breakfast pastries (empanada-like things?), croissants, and I think I saw quiches \n\n\nI'd give it another try, but based on my first visit and judging heavily on the latte I ordered, this place was okay.", "author": "Vivian L."}

I found this sign that listed Italian coffees and then tea.  The name of the place was Bello Coffee & Tea.  If a coffeehouse dares to list tea with coffee, then I find it a challenge to see if their teas measure up.  I entered the shop and was drenched in a song by The Smiths.  I was home.\n\nThe decor is contemporary with cushy lounge chairs, bar and stools, less cushy chairs and tables.  The service was quick and courteous.  I was served by a SF Giants fan, goatee and all.  He was most friendly and welcoming.\n\nI was delighted to find a good list of white, green, oolong, black and herbal teas. Coffeehouses do not always offer such an array of tea.  Bello even had 2 different oolongs for my choosing.  I decided to try the Iron Goddess of Mercy oolong hot tea.  The food choices were not extensive so I settled for an oatmeal nut cookie.  For my taste the honey was too much and too sweet, but the whole grains were good.\n\nThe indie rock rounded out my brunch time making the morning a wonderous and surprising delight.\n\nIf you are ever at the Glen Park BART Station and need a break or pick me up, I highly recommend visiting the Cafe Bello for tea and a treat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-25", "description": "This review is for the iced teas and hot teas.  I honestly was attracted to this place because of the decent list of tea I saw.  After making my way to the register, I asked about the tea and was told the iced ones are premade and the hot ones are tea bags and water from the boiler, so it's \"not too hot\" and I didn't need extra iced cubes.\n\nThey use a water dispenser much like the one I have at home -- it's an at-home water boiler!  Except, it's being used to fill my $2-3 cup of tea.  If your name has 'tea' in it, I would expect a little better like, hotter water at least?.  The iced teas are OK, but note, they're not sweetened and the cups are generally much too full of ice so your tea gets watered down quite quickly.  \n\nAt least it's a convenient stop after getting off of Bart at Glen Park, but I don't think I'll be back soon since Canyon Market and Rocket Swirl (or the latest named place) is so close by.\n\nRestrooms were clean in the past and the staff is polite.  So on those notes, fine, but since this is a drink place, I do have expectations on drinkability. Meh.", "author": "Jennifer Y."}

Grocery stores could wait. Bars could wait. Heck, even gas stations could wait, but I NEEDED to find good coffee.\n\nAfter much searching (which was made considerably easier thanks to yelp), I found Bello: exactly what I had dreamed of.\n\nIt's nestled in the quaint, picturesque heart of Glen Park, with a handful of other shops nearby, including a market that sells fresh flowers and produce. Sitting conveniently on the corner of Diamond and Bosworth, lined with huge trees and the bustling of passerbys, I couldn't think of a better place to spend my mornings.\n\nThen, of course, there's the COFFEE.\n\nFirst, my credentials: I love coffee. Pour me a cup of freshly brewed, black coffee and--granted it's any good--I can tell you which region it was grown in and the strength of the roast. In fact, the only thing I appreciate more than a cup of drip coffee is... Art. And well, if you're going to put art in a cup, I suppose I'll convert to espresso! Both the drip coffee and the espresso (and all subcategories therein) at Bello are absolutely perfect. Every. Single. Time.\n\nBello does all things well. Their breakfast items are scrumptious, their pastries delectable and their treats exquisite.\n\nAnd, have I mentioned their COFFEE?", "author": "Kristi D."}

This is definitely not a 4.5 star place. Thing is, maybe they just had one off drink, but ... there are plenty of places in SF where they never make a bad drink.\n\nFirst, place was a little dirty. The pastries and food options were pretty unimpressive and unappealing, sitting in a cold case. The barista made my latte and called me, but I guess I didn't hear him ... but I was sitting right in front of him and he walked by me a few times to do other things, so he could have been nice enough to drop it off. NOT that it should be expected, so I won't dock him for that.\n\nBut then he said something like \"your latte's not getting any hotter,\" which was fine too, except that when I took a sip, the foam had dissipated (it had been sitting there no more than a few minutes), and it was still scalding hot!\n\nLatte that is well made should hold its foam for awhile, and shouldn't be scalding hot even when it's first made. It might sound like a picky snobby thing to mention, but a well-made latte is smooth, velvety, and comfortably warm. So a scalding cup of thin liquid with bubbly soapy foam on top doesn't exactly fit the bill ...\n\nAnyway, disappointing. Nothing really against the barista, he was nice enough actually. But just can't compete in this area where other shops go above and beyond, both in terms of service and in terms of quality.", "author": "J C."}

The short version: coffee pretty good, pastry pretty bad, ambience and staff nice. \n\nLong version: The ambience is nice--it's small and got fairly modern furnishings. Music is an appropriate volume and a decent selection. No complaints there. It's quite full this morning with people on their laptops, which makes me think it's more for people working than it is for people meeting for coffee. \n\nThe service was friendly and expedient. I got a 12 oz nonfat latte for 3.00. It was quite good but nothing to write home about. Very pretty heart latte art though if that appeals to you! \n\nI also got a breakfast fiesta pastry, which was pretty bad. It tasted like it had no salt added and the crust was waxy. So that drops a 3.75 star latte down to the 3 stars. I probably shouldn't have expected much from a pastry they stuck in the toaster, but it was barely above edible.", "author": "Meryl S."}

Single-drip coffee available after the morning rush.  The tea selection is fabulous -- green, black, red, herbal.  I've had nearly every kind of tea there and I have not been disappointed.  Right now, I'm on a black-lychee iced tea kick.  Mmm... so refreshing and perky.  \n\nTHE FOOD:  Great pastries that you can count on -- doughnuts, cookies, muffins, coffee cake, red velvet cake, lemon cake, bagels, etc.  Not \"the best in the world,\" but always tasty.  For hot food, they have pasties and quiches that they can warm up.  If you're hungry for a meal, then this isn't the place to go.  If you want a little nibble with your coffee or tea, it's perfect.  \n\nTHE SERVICE:  Friendly baristas.  They do their jobs well; they're quick, personable, and skilled at makin' your coffee and tea just right.  They work hard!  I always tip them well.  \n\nTHE WIFI:  It's free!  But can sometimes be spotty when the cafe is too full.  It usually works fine when there are a handful of computers on the network.  There are some outlets available if your computer needs to recharge too.  \n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  Lots of tables, chairs, counters and stools.  Warm feel.  Not too hipstery, not too shabby, not too preppy.  Clean and comfy.  I always bus my table and put my dishes in the bin (by the trash), but some folks leave their dishes on the tables for the baristas to pick up.  They have bins for trash, liquid, compost, and recycling.  \n\nTHE BAD-ASS FACTOR:  Check out this clip of one of their baristas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4S5CuuolAk  \n\nTHE REGULARS:  There are a bunch of folks who come there every day.

Let me first preface this by stating that I'm not a coffee drinker. My beverage of choice is the chai latte, and I will search high and low for a good chai. \n\nI discovered this place almost by chance. I'm a daily BART commuter, and Glen Park is simply a brief layover on the trip. While waiting for the bus, I struck up a conversation with the lady I was standing next to. I asked her where you could get a good cup of coffee around here and she pointed me in the direction of Bello, literally just across the street. Little did I know that this would be the chai that I would measure all other against.\n\nBello offers two chai's, sweet or spicy. Not being in an adventurous mood, I stuck with the sweet. Wow, now that's not a Starbuck syrup laden knockoff, that my friends was the real thing! I was instantly hooked. What had turned into a passing cup of tea blossomed into a full addiction. Bello became a welcomed stop on the way to work.\n\nAfter a few months and a couple dozen cup of chai, my adventurous spirit emerged from hiding. I  tried the spiced chai and hands down one of the best hot beverages I have ever tried.

I suppose I was caught up in the puzzling draw of yuppie frenzy that is the coffee bar at (newish) Canyon Market a few doors down (aw, but I can purchase my coffee at the same time as my cardboard-boxed-expensive-as-hell-per-pound-salad!) \nUm, anyway, I went back to Bello one random morning, got a latte, and tasted what delicious is. Yes, this is what a simply satisfying, creamy-comforting, delicious coffee tastes like. I get the americano every once in a while too, which to me is rich and smooth - never bitter or burnt. Much better than the sometimes sour or bitter cups I get at the other place. \n\nOh, also the baristas are really together, quick, and observant. One cold morning, due to lack of caffeine, my shaky fingers succeeded in knocking over my entire medium latte while trying to cover with a lid. I swore softly, blushed, and figured I would have to buy another. But before I could even turn around, one of the baristas had already made me a new one and came to mop up my mess even though the place was lousy with other customers! I loved that man at that moment.", "author": "Amy Jo J."}

They have a good variety of coffee, good prices, generally friendly staff, and they do good artwork with the coffee, as many photos on this page show. However, the coffee itself is not meaningfully special. What I mean by that is I don't sit around at work thinking \"dang I want a Bello breve right now.' And sometimes I do that with Caribou breves. So in that regard, it's a three-star. But the service and care given to the coffee warrant a four-star rating. Ultimately, I'm giving Bello the better rating because I want to encourage the care and artistry they put into their coffee, but I can't really say the coffee itself is worth writing home about, though it is the best in Glen Park.", "author": "David H."}

It have fear on my conscience.\r\n\r\nAfter the the drink was completed, he rang up $1.95. I gave him a Ten-dollar-bill and requested changed for a dollar. I took a sip, and I felt a lot better and satisfied with this great-tasting coffee. I felt his pain on that tough Monday, so I gave him a dollar tip. Hopefully, he can use that dollar for a drink of his own.\r\n\r\n$1.95 for depth-charge at this Cafe is the cheapest as oppose to other cafe which cost over $2.00.

I will gladly defend this awesome cafe.\n\n1. There were rubber gloves on the sidewalk in front of the cafe, therefore it's obvious that you shouldn't get coffee from there ever again. What the hell does that have to do with the quality of the coffee or their service? Really, get a life.\n\n2. You had to wait 5 minutes for your drink. Heaven forbid. Clearly you've been affected by the \"instant gratification epidemic\" that has taken over our culture. And did you really time it? It might have been closer to 3 minutes but it just felt like 5. Again, get a life.\n\n3. The hours of operation are inconvenient for you because you like to drink coffee in the evenings.

It was so good that it's painful to think of going back to average to good lattes.  The beans are roasted DAILY and the latte had a heart shape.  Looks aside, the latte reminded me of what really good lattes are supposed to be like - rich, deep flavor, smooth but strong, well-balanced, clean with no sour or bitter aftertaste.  They put two shots of espresso in their espresso drinks and they're reasonably priced ($3 for a medium).  \n\nIt's worth going out of your way for this latte.  Food wise, they had four types of pasties (British inspired meat pies) that looked good, loaf cakes, bagels, and cookies.  And they have gelato but they don't make that gelato. \n\nToo bad there's no free wi-fi but they sell some \"designer\" coffee mugs and coffee accessories and have some indoor seating.

There are yellow walls, nice art, a few plants here and there, and ambient music to make you forget all about the horrors and nightmares awaiting you on either end of your work day. (I'm kidding, btw- I love chaos and crisis).\n\nThe vibe is super mellow and the patrons are of the quiet bookish or laptop variety. The lights are really cool- they kind of hang really low from the ceiling (watch your head!), making it easy to read a newspaper, book, or psychiatric evaluation :)\n\nThe staff are super laid back and will let you hang out long after your iced quadruple shot Americano has been slurped up. There are also pastries that I can not eat but which look delish. For those of the savory persuasion, they have quiche, pasties (not the kind that you see at gold club *sigh*), and pizzas. Vegetarian options abound. \n\nFree WiFi means I can intend to get some work done and Yelp instead (sorry, boss!) and what more could a dedicated professional like me ask for?", "author": "Autumn K."}

We were checking out some open houses in the neighborhood and I was craving a hot cup of chai. We stumbled upon Cafe Bello and decided to give it a shot. We stepped inside to find a clean, tastefully decorated space with plenty of seating, friendly service, and a nice mix of customers. I ordered a spicy chai latte and it was delicious. I believe the brand of chai they use is called \"Ambiance.\" Whatever it was, I found it to be perfectly spicy and not too sweet, which is exactly what I was looking for. \n\nI was tempted by the baked goods, but managed to resist. They had some muffins, breads, and cakes that looked tasty. They also serve a few flavors of gelato. As we left Cafe Bello and decided to check out the local bookstore, I thought to myself, \"Yes, I could most definitely live here.\"", "author": "Abby W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-25", "description": "Let me just say that I have a little insider knowledge, as I used to work here.  My sister used to work here.  And a few friends have worked here as well.  The owner/operator Josh and Jane are decent folks that run a nice shop.  The one thing that strikes me about Cafe Bello compared to other places is that IT IS CLEAN.  The machines are sterilized each night, the floor is mopped once a day, the dishes on which the food in the refrigerator sits are washed every day.  The pastries are brought in fresh each morning from a local bakery at 5:00 AM.\n\nCoffee - The drip (regular) coffee is always good.  Joshua (the owner) has very strict standards, and it pays off.  The coffee can't be served once it hits the 60 minute mark.  It gets dumped and a fresh pot made.  In the mornings, your coffee from grinding to drinking isn't even 20 minutes old.\n\nEspresso drinks - Okay, so this depends on your barrista.  If it's someone new or someone on an off day, your cup might not be as good.  There is training, and the espresso drinks are usually quite good, but there's a chance you'll hit it on an off day.  If Joshua is making your drink, then you'll get a primo cup.  He's entered into latte art competitions, so you'll probably get a cool design in your latte or cappucino.\n\nFood - Virtually all of it is from local sources.  Like the sweet breads are from a Glen Park bakery.  You'll find some packaged variety (like granola bars); those are obviously not made locally.  You can't get a \"fill-me-up\" meal here, but anything short of it can be accomplished.  Because it's right next to BART and MUNI (J, 23 lines et al), it's a convenient place to grab a coffee and a snack on the go.\n\nAtmosphere - The music depends on who's working.  There used to be a staff of music snobs who would deliver obscure but tasty sounds whilst you drank your coffee (Mary, Marlon, Phoenix... ).  We no longer work there, but the music is still good when I visit.  The atmosphere is nice.  It's usually pretty well lit.  The place has a neighborhoody feel to it.\n\nSo bring a book, have a seat, and enjoy your caffeine.\n\nOh yeah, they roast their own morning coffee too.  It's got a high caffeine content.", "author": "Edward H."}

Cafe Bello is like a tinier version of Coupa.\n\nThe seating is a little odd - a few small tables, several hair-salon-waiting-area-esque chairs that are not very conducive to eating or drinking anything that requires a table (I vote for some end tables!), and some counter seating at the front window.   \n\nPricing is very reasonable (although this may be because I only drink tea), and the tea selection is pretty good.  For good tea, you have to seek out these smaller independent coffee shops, because the big chains aren't really in it for the tea-drinking customers - except maybe Coffee Bean/Tea Leaf.  \n\nBack on topic, Bello's savory pastries (breakfast \"pasties,\" quiche, etc.) are delicious and super cheap.  A nice cup of tea and a giant wedge of quiche for under $4.00 fits very nicely into my non-profit worker budget.  This is definitely my neighborhood coffee spot for now.", "author": "Nisha P."}

All items made from their fresh roasted beans (roasted on-site), which according to Boyfriend are the best beans he's ever sampled.

Nice and relatively cozy environment (though the seating arrangement is a little odd and I semiregularly trip over chairs) and the food and drinks are delicious and reasonably priced. \n\nHowever, I do have to deduct a star because of the inconsistent staff. Some of them are friendly while others are indifferent to your presence. My personal favorite is the gentleman with a long ponytail (don't know his name, as no one on the premises wears nametags), but another barista with short curly hair and beard really needs to work on his customer service, as he regularly seems to look as if he'd rather be somewhere else. At least no one has artificial smiles plastered on their faces.\n\nQuibbles aside, Cafe Bello is recommended for the anti-Starbucks crowd who believe in supporting local businesses, not to mention its convenient location (right across the street from BART).

I was compelled to go into Cafe Bello because I was lazy and didn't want to cross the street. I don't drink coffee normally so I can't tell everyday bad coffee from everyday good/ok coffee. I can identify a significantly superior coffee and cafe bello serves it up. I have only had 2 such memorable brews, one here and one at Hal'i'maile General Store on Maui.

I peeped my head into Cafe Bello and was immediately attracted to its quaint interior and (surprisingly) they were slappin bay music! I thought to myself \"I guess I can just leave my ipod off then\". So, I walked in and ordered a soy cappuccino and it was truly one of the best cappuccino's I've ever had! The espresso had a really nice full, deep flavor unlike Starbucks espresso (trust me, I work at Starbucks.) The foam was really creamy- a lot of baristas do not know how to make good foam! I topped my drink off with a good dosage of raw sugar aaaand yeah, I kind of wish I ordered a bigger size. After I got my caffeine fix, I decided I wanted to try more beverages and saw their HUGE selection of teas! I love tea! The barista was kind enough to take some time out to tell me about the different kind of black teas available and also let me smell some. I decided to go with the vanilla orchid black tea and a slice of pound cake, both of which turned out to be delicious! All of their pastries sounded amazing- even their savory ones! They offered vegetarian pizza, calzone type things, and a variety of quiche. How awesome is that? \nSo, overall, awesome place to study, hang out with some friends or just have some chill alone time. Awesome espresso drinks and a wide variety of exotic teas along with sweet and savory pastries= my kind of place to be! Try it out, cheers!", "author": "De Ann W."}
