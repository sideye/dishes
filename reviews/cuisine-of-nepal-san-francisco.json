It's a real gem.\n\nWe started with the vegetable momos ($7 for six) which tasted great, with a savory filling. The rice wrapper could have been tighter and less doughy, but it was still fine overall (the best momos in the Bay Area can be found at Urban Momo in San Jose, fyi).\n\nThe menu has a bunch of vegetarian dishes, most of which are vegan by default (with the exception of the ones with paneer or egg).\n\nThe rayo saag tarkari ($13) consists of delicately cooked mustard greens in a light savory sauce. Get this dish.\n\nThe kwanti daal ($13) comes filled with kidney beans, black lentils and green onion, making this dish seem almost like Nepalese chili, but so much more complex and better. I loved this.\n\nLastly the aloo tama bodi ($13) has lightly cooked black eyed beans with potato and bamboo. It's a great mixture of crunchy and soft, starchy and moist, salty and tangy. What a great dish.\n\nAll of the a la carte dishes come with brown rice and butter naan; unfortunately, Cuisine of Nepal doesn't have a vegan bread option such as roti or chapati (naan is almost always made with yogurt kneaded into the dough).\n\nThe service was okay, but not great. \n\nAll in all, Cuisine of Nepal makes some wonderful food and is worth repeat visits.", "author": "Kedar D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-21", "description": "Probably one of my new favorite places due to its uniqueness (how often do you find a Nepal restaurant?) customer service (one of the best) and affordability. \n\nPARKING:\nJust to start it off, this restaurant is small, so I highly recommended making a reservation for larger parties (which is easy to do so via the Yelp app). Parking can be very difficult during the night time, so be prepared to account for that when traveling to this place.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe service here is for sure one of the best I ever had. The owner consistently came back to update us on our wait and after waiting for only 10 minutes, the owner offered us a free glass of wine (white or red) just while we wait for our table. For those who can get seated immediately, you can always check in through the Yelp app for your free glass :) In addition, to help decrease our wait time, he even took our orders before we got seated, just so the food came out quicker. Service throughout the night was still flawless and it was great to see how hardworking and passionate the owner and everyone else was here! \n\nATMOSPHERE: \nThe decoration was very homey feeling and overall clean. There is also a small bar towards the back of the restaurant, where people just hang around and talk. Although very small place, the whole place had a \"home\" and chill feeling all around.\n\nFOOD:\nThe best part of the night. For food, we got the samosas (lamb), sizzling pawn platter and the curry basil lamb. The owner had no problem suggesting and helping us order food, especially since we never tried Nepal cuisine before. For those who also never, the best way for me to describe it is a mix of Indian and Merterrian food -- since they have a combination of curry plates and plates with yogurt sauce. Samosas were hugeee and stuffed with minced lamb. Paired great with the sauce it came with and recommended for anyone who loves samosas. Sizzling pawn platter came hot, both in terms of temperature and spicy level. Would recommend to anybody who loves spicy food! Lastly, the curry lamb was probably my favorite dish of the night. Flavorful and tasted great with the butter naan that came with the dish!\n\n TLDR: Great food! Best customer service I had in a long time, and I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to try something different  at an affordable rate!", "author": "Jenny N."}

We ordered delivery after a long travel day, excited to get Nepalese food but what we got just simply wasn't very tasty. \n\nWe got the Palak Paneer; basically spinach, curry and cheese and it was not good. The cheese was squeaky -- it literally made a weird squeaky sound as you ate it and the sauce was watery and under spiced.\n\nThe vegetable momos were the highlight for sure and the dipping sauce was good. The naan was chewy and super flat, and a blind taste test of the basically unflavored garlic vs plain would stump anyone. \n\nThe delivery option was for basmati or brown rice and went with basmati.. instead got cheap white rice like you'd find at a Panda Express or food court Chinese spot.\n\nOh and they didn't pack utensils or napkins which is a bummer since we're in a hotel and had to go looking for some.

There's nothing better than to try Nepalese food which is quite similar to Indian food.  I once checked its menu and its narrow dining area before I come inside on my next visit.  Looks cute and enchanting.  Walk-ins are acceptable since I was the first customer to come inside and choose the last seating of the narrow dining area near where I can easily smell the aroma of the spices.  Its background music was relaxing except the first song contains catchy lyrics in a broken record.  I'm glad the first song has ended before I hear the next relaxing music.  On to the food and drink selection!\n\nI choose masala chai as a hot tea without Himalayan milk, but why whole milk as a Himalayan milk?  Anyways, I put in two packets of sugar in the raw to sweetened up the plain masala chai.\n\nFor my appetizer, a bowl of Jhol with my choice of lentils (I never expected a bigger bowl).  I admit, I should've chosen the Himalayan Momo which is a traditional appetizer, but a Bengali soup was a much better choice.  I be ready to bring out plenty of napkins if I need to wipe away my sweat.  After a few spoonfuls, I easily break a sweat and I need to wipe my forehead right away.\n\nFor my main course, a dish of Kwanti Daal, comes with Basmati Rice and four quarter pieces of crispy naan bread.  Kidney beans, black eyed peas, and lentils are truly plant based for consumption.  After a couple spoonful of Himalayan \"chili\", its spices were more intense than Jhol.  I again wiped away my sweat and blow my nose.  I took a spoonful of plain Basmati Rice as a way to ease down the spices.\n\nAfter finishing up the meal (except the naan bread), I finished Raita last.  By choosing medium spice, I managed to make it through til the early afternoon.  And honestly, its spices are real compared to Viva Goa.  I'm glad to try something new which is worth the experience.  Customer service was very promising.  Even though few customers came, it never take long for every food and drink to come to my table.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

The food was OK on taste but tiny quantity for the cost, could barely feed one human per dish and that's with getting the Combo meals!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-09", "description": "Cuisine of Nepal is a cozy restaurant located in Bernal Heights that serves up very homey Nepalese food. I came here with two others on a Friday night, and we were seated right away at one of the many open tables, but by the time we left, the place was completely packed. The service here was so kind and made sure to provide everything we needed, and the food was delicious as well!\n\nBetween the three of us, we decided to order and split the Bhojan (set menu) for 2, which the chef assured us was enough for three people to share (and he was definitely right). The Bhojan came with two glasses of the house wine, which unfortunately were pretty flavorless (not that we came to this restaurant for its alcohol). Our meal started with a plate of appetizers: chicken momos, the cubed flame-roasted chicken, and the potato samosas. These came with three different dipping sauces: a spicy tomato sauce, a sweet and savory brown sauce, and a mint chutney. I found the chicken momos a little bit underwhelming (relatively bland), but the cubed chicken had so much great flavor from the chiles it was cooked with, and the spiced potato mixture in the samosas was so fragrant and delicious. Each of the three of the sauces added great flavor to the food as well!\n\nThen came the main entree. First, we were given two large platters that came with some staples: rice, naan, a vegetable soup, and a lentil soup. The naan was much chewier than other naan breads I've had, and both of the soups were well-spiced and tasty. The two entrees that came with the Bhojan were the sizzling chicken platter, which came with chunks of chicken that had a strange rubbery texture (though not overcooked/dry), which wasn't quite to my liking, and a black-eyed pea/bamboo shoot curry, which had a really unique texture and went very well with the naan bread (though I'd prefer a little bit more spice/flavor in a curry).\n\nOverall, this was a great restaurant with very authentic, home-style Nepalese food. While some of the dishes weren't the best in my opinion, the service was definitely on point, and this meal made for a great cultural experience. My only complaint was that the restaurant was quite warm/stuffy inside, which made me sweat quite a lot while eating the spicy food. However, that definitely didn't deter me from going back for more!", "author": "David K."}

Over an hour Muni ride actually (with some delays). By the time we arrived, my boyfriend and I were borderline hangry. \n\nWe immediately ordered the Himalayan Momos with pork. They're kind of like any steamed pork dumplings you've probably had many times if you're familiar with Asian food, except the filling was heavily spiced with what I think might have been curry powder and cumin. And instead of vinegar or soy sauce, they were served with tomato sauce. Really good, but the real highlight were the entrees!\n\nWe picked the Chicken Cashew Cream Curry combo, and the Palak Paneer Curry combo. You can order your entr\u00e9e a la carte, which comes with butter naan & white or brown rice (no extra charge for brown!), but like I said, we were hungry. So we ordered the combos, which come with lentils, mixed vegetables, tomato chutney, butter naan, & white or brown rice. \n\nBEST curries I've ever had, for real. The chicken cashew cream curry was so amazingly flavorful, I really could have licked the bowl clean. The palak paneer was great too.

I ordered the deep fried vegetables to start. The plate came with two different sauces: one sweet and sour sauce and one green sauce. The green sauce with deep fried vegetables definitely offered a very interesting taste and my friend and I both loved it. \n\nFor the entree, I got the basil lamb curry a la carte. Haven't seen a lot of reviews of the lamb on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try. It is definitely one of the underrated dishes here at Cuisine of Nepal. The lamb tasted really good. I think I got the mild option and it was the default option when you order. I would recommend this option to beginner curry-eaters. \n\nThis place didn't disappoint me at all.

No, it's not a clickety-clack train through the Himalayas. It's an exotic culinary journey that makes two stops in the East Bay (Annapurna in Oakland and Mount Everest in Berkeley) and a final stop here over the course of a month. OK, I just made that up, but that's still a lot of momos in a condensed amount of time, don't you think? Advance praise on this compact place has been overwhelmingly favorable, and in one of those rare instances when the reality matches the hype, the food here is excellent. The ambiance and staff certainly make it feel authentic, but what do I know?\n\nThe cynic in me was wondering if they hired the elder woman in the native costume as a prop (photo: http://bit.ly/2dfKbnY), but no, she was real and so was the food. The true litmus test came with the $6.99 Himalayan Momos, the indigenous steamed dumplings that I have favored since my own trip to Nepal seventeen years earlier. A half-dozen plump ones came my way stuffed with minced pork and shredded cabbage and accompanied by a unique sesame, chili and tomato chutney sauce that I didn't have at the other two spots (photo: http://bit.ly/2czFm4J). They passed my test with flying colors.\n\nPicking a main was no easy task as there were tantalizing variations on curry. From Atlantic salmon fillet to radish ginger chicken, their palette was bursting with flavors. I chose the $15.99 Chicken Cashew Cream Curry (Kukhuraku Ledo) a la carte. The chicken was clay oven flame-roasted and diced into big chunks and bathed in a lightly blended cashew cream sauce that was like ambrosia (photo: http://bit.ly/2cMmZN4). It came with a hefty portion of butter naan and basmati white rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2cDVHYa). It was awfully quiet when I dined here on a Saturday afternoon, so hopefully the five-star reviews will draw in business despite its relatively isolated location on Mission. All aboard for the Nepali Express!\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...luxuriant curries and grade-A momos put this Nepalese spot above the rest\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...native decor is not too overwhelming here though quite authentic\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...quite attentive\nTOTAL - 5 stars...hopefully not the last call for this Nepali Express!", "author": "Ed U."}

I also appreciate that they gave big chunks of the squash, so it wouldn't fall apart too easily.\n\nVegetarian Momo - 5 stars\nImagine a Chinese dumpling. Now imagine a samosa. When they marry, comes the prodigy child Momo (Himalayan dumplings). The filling was like a samosa, spicy and with a bit of potatoes. The outer layer is like a dumpling: hand-knead dough with a perfect thickness. The dip (sesame paste) is also a great combination of East Asian flavors. Delicious!\n\nKheer - 2 stars\nThey served us their kheer (rice pudding) hot, which wasn't too big of a problem for me. I think it reminds me of \u516b\u5bf6\u7ca5 (Chinese version of hot sweet rice soup). But - the kheer was soooo rich with fat (cream and butter probably) that it actually coated my entire palate with unpleasant gritty pieces of fat. We had a few small bites that were good, but just couldn't have any more than that. We even brought it home and added lots of nonfat milk to it and still couldn't save the dessert :( \n\nOverall - a really great neighborhood gem that we will definitely visit again.

Very narrow, with tables along one side the entire length. The back end opens up to more tables for larger parties. \nThe food: We were here for lunch, and had the combo meals.\nBheda La Sya \u00b7 Traditional Lamb Curry (Combo). Boneless Lamb cooked in curry base. \nKukhurako Ledo \u00b7 Chicken Cashew Cream Curry (Combo). Flame-broiled chicken cooked with a light blended cashew cream sauce in curry base.\nThe combo meals come with spicy cooked vegetables, and a wonderful lentil soup, and Naan.\nThe flavors are such a wonderful surprise in both of these dishes. The chicken and the lamb each were cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth. Some may think the flavors just a tad too spicy. . . But as for me... bring it on!   I love it. Just wish they were closer to my home. I would be here often.", "author": "Greg S."}

There was no wait and the staff which is basically a family of three sat us down right away and were super sweet. They were really kind to my friend and tried to teach her more nepali over the course of the meal! We shared samosas, an eggplant curry  and a chick pea currry. We got the meal special which came with lentil soup and rice and bread. It was so filling and rich. It was perfect for a cold night. We went home happy with a lot of left overs for the week. Check this place out! It is a great value for money and has a fantastic veggie selection.", "author": "Anne S."}

The owner and Cuisine of Nepal team is incredible. \n\nEverything here is so incredibly. I especially recommend getting the following:\n- chicken momo dumplings: I've never had dumplings like this before. They tasted homemade and my family makes dumplings all the time. The dipping sauce is also incredible. \n- chicken cashew cream curr: I've never had anything like this before. Every bite dipped in this sauce was incredible.\n- garlic naan: Hands down my favorite naan ever. If you like garlic, you will love this garlic coated naan.\n- chicken kebab - So normally when I go out to eat and I order meat, I never order chicken. Chicken is often overcooked and too dry for my liking but oh my god, this restaurant really knows how to cook their chicken so that it's incredibly tender. This chicken is better than the chicken at Zuni Cafe because the chicken kebabs here are consistent where as the chicken at Zuni Cafe is sometimes good and sometimes too dry.\n\nI will be back soon to recommend for dishes!", "author": "Jackie W."}

It's so small and discreet that I would've never discovered it on my own. We celebrated one of my roommates' birthday here on a week night, and there were just a few families dining in. I mentioned to the owner that we were celebrating, because you never know what freebies you might get, and he definitely hooked us up.\n\nWe started with the pork momos as an appetizer. Our server told me that the sauce on the side is \"not spicy,\" but after just a little taste, my entire mouth was on fire, so I stopped using it. I don't get the hype about momos, because without the sauce, they're just regular dumplings...with a cutesy name. The frozen dumplings I eat at home are just fine, so I wouldn't order these again. \n\nThe 3 of us each got the chicken cashew cream curry. I know, I know. It's blasphemous for everyone at the table to order the same dish instead of hedging our bets and diversifying, but we all just REALLY wanted it. A lot of it. Thankfully, it was super tasty, so our risks paid off. You even get to substitute brown rice for white without a surcharge, and it comes with 2 pieces of the softest naan. Perhaps after seeing that we all got the same thing, the owner brought us a complimentary chicken curry dish that was excellent, but more on the spicy side. He also gave us an extra order of naan. So nice! \n\nWe had such a wonderful time, and felt really taken care of.\n\nP.S. Yelp check in gets you a free glass of white or red!", "author": "Karen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-26", "description": "It was a Saturday morning and it started out like all Saturday mornings: I woke up at 4:30 am and cursed. I looked at my phone to see when my alarm will go off, only to realize it wasn't Monday...it was the weekend! YAS (SFW): http://bit.ly/27TSTvP!\n\nExcept hours later while flip flopping in bed, I realized that I had an appointment in 30 minutes. I hightailed outta the house and made my way to The Mission.\n\nOn my home from my appointment, I was hangry and passed by the newly opened Cuisine of Nepal (formerly Chan's Cuisine across from Zante's). I walked in disheveled in sweats covered with Tater fur, flip flops, a hair nest, and my grandma grey eyebrows (thanks to a botched tattoo job when I was 16) . \n\nThe Owner/Chef Prem welcomed me with open arms and told me to sit at any available table. I intended to do take-out because of the aforementioned but I was the only one there so I figure that I just dine in. Shit, I hope I don't meet Mr. Right today, at least not Mr. Right Now, I thought to myself. \n\nCuisine of Nepal is from the owner/chef of Little Nepal, a beloved Bernal Heights neighborhood favorite: http://bit.ly/1XV86sk. It's my understanding that once Little Nepal's lease is over on Cortland, he will make the full transition to Cuisine of Nepal. The menu is similar serving momos, samosas, curries, sizzling meat platters, naan, etc. Prices are a tad high with an individually portioned entr\u00e9e with rice ranging from $11.99 (vegetarian) to $15.99 (chicken, lamb, shrimp). For an additional $2, you can make your meal a combo with lentils, a veggie stew, and chutney. NO msg is used. Wine and beer only. They also offer free delivery within a 5 mile radius. \n\nI love nuts everything so I ordered the Kukhurako Ledo: Chicken Cashew Cream Curry w/ clay oven flamed-roasted chicken, buttered naan, basmati rice ($15.99). Initially, I thought the pricing seemed a little high for Asian food but it all made sense when my order arrived: http://bit.ly/1TGGRys. Everything is made to order and Chef Prem takes great pride in his food. He explained to me how he made the cashew cream curry (he can leave out the cream for vegans); grinding the cashews by hand, caramelizing the onions, to making the tomato chutney. It's all about building those layer of flavors and it shows (all without the use of msg). \n\nUpon my first bite, I melted into my seat in utter satisfaction. The sauce was velvety smooth, incredibly rich, wonderfully spiced, and mildly spicy. Similar to a Tikka Masala or Butter Chicken sauce without all that grease from butter or ghee since cashew cream is used instead. Dunking the freshly made, piping hot buttered naan into the curry was sublime. Not a fan of white chicken meat unless I'm eating salads but the white chunks of chicken were nicely tender. I could of finished everything in one sitting but I took half home so I can savor for later. I ate the leftovers 2 days later and the sauce was even better as the flavors developed even more. That cashew cream curry is everything...it will make even shoe leather taste good so this dish is highly recommended.\n\nService was very swift, hospitable, and attentive since I was the only one there at the time. I wanted to get my weekend buzz going so I wanted to enjoy a beer with my lunch. They didn't have the small 12 oz bottle of the Taj Mahal in stock but Chef Prem popped open a 22 oz, and told me to drink as much as I can, and he will only charge me for the small bottle. Such a kind gesture that was much appreciated.  \n\nThe building has an odd layout. As you enter, you're basically walking through a narrow hallway of two tops and then they have larger tables in the back to seat two groups of six, with total seating for 30. They did the best they could to utilize the space and turn it into a homey, neighborhood restaurant.\n\nAs I finishing up lunch, a female solicitor walks in with bags of makeup. She gives her sales pitch to the Chef Prem and I, and asks if we wanted to buy the bag of discounted makeup for $20 ($100 value). \n\nChef Prem: \"Sorry, I don't wear makeup but do you want a cup of hot tea.\" (See how nice this guy is!)\n\nSolicitor *Looks at me*\n\nMe: \"No, thank you.\" \n\nSolicitor: \"But, I have a really good mascara...make you look sexy.\"\n\nMe: \"No, thank you.\" \n\n*Telepathing to her that I don't normally look like horse manure*\n\nSolicitor: \"Dun you waaan booooifriiiien?\"\n\nOoooh nooooo, she diiiidin't. \n\n*Z-line snap*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It's far enough away from Valencia St to feel like a real neighborhood locals type of place without any of the crazy lines and tipsy loud patrons of the chic chic places further north. My friends and I enjoyed a lovely meal together including \n\n * Momos ($6.99 pork) - I've been eating homemade potstickers all my life and though I like the momos I don't like them as much as I love potstickers. The momos have a thicker chewier dough which I didn't care for though the chutney for dipping was very good.\n\n* Nagala Sya ($16.99 Traditional Chicken Curry combo) - This was probably my favorite dish of the evening. Super tender chicken. Nice flavored curry.\n\n * Pharsi ($15.99 Pumpkin Curry combo) - Okay but didn't stand out compared to the chicken.\n\n * Aloo Ra Cauli Tarkari ($14.99 Potato Cauliflower Curry combo) - A nice variation on the familiar Indian Aloo Gobi. Potatoes and cauliflower were nicely cooked and the curry had a nice flavor too.\n\n * Poleko Bheda ($18.99 Sizzling Lamb Platter combo) - It was just a lamb kebab off the stick. The lamb was tasty though not as tender as the chicken. I think I'm just not a huge fan of kebabs.\n\nYou can get each platter as a la carte with naan and rice, or as a combo with naan, rice, lentils, mixed vegetables, chutney. We opted to go with the combo for 4 of us. The naan was really good - thin, chewy, buttery, more moist and less bready than most naans. The lentils and mixed veg were also nice but probably not necessary as we were super stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nFor the momos, 4 combo dishes, and 2 large beers it was only $95 before tip. \n\nThis place is super popular on weekends judging from the crowd on Saturday night. The tables were all full when we walked in (except for ours) and full again when we left. Definitely make reservations if you want a spot without a wait though just 24h notice is enough to secure a table.", "author": "Jean K."}

The ambiance is more on casual side which is also reflected in the food that I felt leant more towards homemade as opposed to restaurant meticulousness.The service was on point as our server was always smiling and friendly, and he was quick to fulfill any requests we had. We decided on ordering the Bhojan set menu for two people of which our server notified us would be enough for the three of us. The set meal also came with complimentary house wine, though I'm told it's not the greatest of drinks.\n\nThe first plate to arrive consisted of pieces of chicken, two large samosas, and four chicken momos. Three sauces also came with this plate: spicy tomato, a sweet bbq-like sauce, and mint chutney. Each sauce was easily distinguishable in taste from the others which led to completely unique and different experiences depending on the food/sauce combination. The chicken was splendidly grilled with some char on it. It also had an abundance of flavor and a nice spicy kick to it. I would say that this chicken was one of the highlights of the meal. The samosas were nicely fried and filled with a perfectly mushy and starchy filling that also had a good amount of spiciness to it. The chicken momos reminded me of Chinese potstickers, but with spices added in and a curry flavor.\n\nThe main entrees included a sizzling chicken dish, black-eyed pea + bamboo shoot curry, and two plates of naan with rice, lentil soup, and vegetable soup. The chicken dish was similar in flavor to the chicken in the starter. The main differences were that the pieces were larger and the texture was a tad bit chewier which could've been somewhat better. The curry had a thin consistency almost like a broth and went excellently with the rice albeit not the most memorable dish. The naan was a pleasant surprise however. It somehow felt both lighter and chewier than the naan I would get from any typical Indian restaurant. I enjoyed it quite a bit, especially in tandem with the lentil soup and the vegetable soup.", "author": "Joshua M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-20", "description": "Delicious Nepalese food!  Similar to Pakistani or Northern Indian food, with rich, boldly spiced curries and stir-fries.  We got the chili chicken and traditional chicken curry, and pork momos (dumplings) -- all fantastic.\n\n5 stars for the food!  I plan to get takeout frequently!\n\nThe one thing you should be aware of when coming is the ambience, or lack thereof.  Most of the restaurant is down a narrow hallway connecting the front door to the main dining room and kitchen, which only seats about 12.  The entire restaurant can probably 35 diners at a time, and it sounds like it's quite busy at dinner.  Definitely not a good date or business meeting location - suitable only for casual meals.\n\nThe staff is very friendly - seems like a family-run restaurant.  The chef came out to check on us, and the server was very attentive and talkative.", "author": "Greg B."}

We came on a quiet Tuesday night and the place was almost full. The restaurant itself is pretty small but they just started doing deliveries--I can tell this is going to be become one of my go to delivery options. \n\nWe ordered the chicken curry and mixed meat combo. The portions were huge! The combo comes with 2 pieces of naan, rice, dhal, and vegetable curry. Honestly all that alone would have filled me up. I had more than enough left overs for lunch the next day. The chicken curry was a little thicker, and more tomato based than I'm used to, but delicious nonetheless. The mixed meat came with chicken, lamb and salmon on a sizzling platter. I thought the lamb was a little overcooked but it wasn't horrible. \n\nThe owner, Prem, was there that night as well and was very attentive and friendly. They were having a bit of a crazy night since a few of his staff members called in sick, and offered us dessert on the house since we had to wait a few minutes to be seated.

We chose the platter for 2, so we could try a few different things, and they were all tasty, with some unique spicy and sweetly sour sauces. I only wish the flavor profiles of the main dish items on the sharing platter weren't so similar. The level of spice was high enough that it overshadowed some of the nuances of the other flavors (we did not specify our heat level). Maybe I was just jealous of our table mate, who ordered the cashew chicken cream, which was soooo yummy (but not included in the sharing platter), and would have been a nice sweet, rich complement to our spicy dishes.

I've never written a review but felt so compelled after my experience at Cuisine of Nepal. \nFood: 5 stars! The food was amazing. I got the chicken curry (neighborhood favorite) and my girlfriend got the chicken Kebab. Both dishes were amazing but the chicken curry really was one of a kind. The accompanying lentil soup garlic naan and rice were the perfect compliment and really felt authentic. Even the dishes the food was served in were different and added another layer of authenticity.\n\nService: 5 stars:\nThe owner happened to be our waiter and you really get the sense that he loves what he is doing and pours his heart and soul into the restaurant. An added benefit is he is the head chef so his recommendations are spot on based on your preferences. With him, it was the little things that ultimately won us over. For instance, when my girlfriend made a comment about how delicious the lentil soup was he returned with some more for her and when I asked about spicing up my curry dish he politely suggested against that given the spiciness would have overpowered the curry and creamy flavor (he was right) and instead he brought me out a small side dish of chicken in a spicy sauce to try (which of course was amazing) all free of charge! \n\nI'm just visiting the San Fran area but this will undoubtedly be a go to spot everytime I come back.", "author": "Caleb W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "Ok-- so this is not your typical fancy SF Michelin star kinda place. \n\nNot too long ago, this was a greasy spoon Chinese food spot, mostly only ordered for delivery because the \"ambience\" was basically a small hallway with tables in it, where no one sat to eat. Overall just kind of an awkward vibe, with crayon drawings from on construction paper from their children (I assume?) on the walls. Very mom + pop, and really not the kind of place you take someone out for dinner. \n\nNow-- since this place has opened, there is rarely an empty table. They are literally just a long hallway with tables, so it is TINY, but they always make room for you no matter what. Everyone I have brought has loved it, and they are treated like family. The owner always remembers our face when we come in as he knows we're neighbors, and does something that goes above and beyond to show his appreciation for us coming in and bringing friends and family with us. It's family friendly, and people from all walks of life seem to enjoy it and feel at home. It is still very independent (one guy owns it, his wife is sometimes a server on busy nights, and those are pretty much the only people I usually see serving all of the tables), but is bustling. \n\nWe love the Himalayan momo (they are klnd of like a potsticker, but filled with more Indian/Himalayan style spices and a chutney vs. oil/vinegar dipping sauce) as an appetizer, and always switch it up and share a few items for the main course. We LOVED the spinach and chicken cream curry (not appealing as a title, I know-- but delicious!)-- AKA Kukhura Ra Saag Tarkari. We got that as a combo, which comes with a yummy lentil dish and very flavorful vegetables. I got the minced lamb curry last time (Keema Tarkari), a la carte (which still comes with the rice and naan, but not the 2 extra sides) -- very good, but was definitely wanting more of the spinach chicken. \n\nOverall-- the spices are always INCREDIBLE, and the prices are very reasonable. We have been back many times since we can walk there from our house, and will definitely be back again.", "author": "Caitlyn D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-19", "description": "The food was tasty. The staff needs seasoning.\n\nWe really enjoyed most of the dishes we ordered. In particular, the Chili Chicken appetizer was lovely, with a bit of a Szechuan flavor to it. All of the food tastes like it was made with fresh ingredients, even the traditional appetizer dipping sauces, which at some restaurants taste like they came from a bottle. \n\nHowever... service was not good. Upon arrival we were asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and though there were plenty of open tables, they had to think about where to seat us. They offered us a table by the door; it was a cold night and we declined. Next we were offered a table for two (we were 3 so we had to refuse again). Finally we were seated at a reasonable spot.\n\nWe ordered, and after awhile our first appetizer arrived. The Pakora were nice, with just enough kick for the American palate (probably milder than it would have been in Nepal). Then we sat. And sat. After another 20 minutes, a member of our party called a different waitress over. We basically had to give them our order again, as they'd lost it, and nobody had seemed to notice us sitting there with one empty plate on our table for all of that time.\n\nThe meal showed up fairly soon, and we enjoyed most of it, though the Eggplant Curry didn't taste much of curry, nor was it particularly piquant. Thereafter, we were visited by the waitress (we never saw our original waiter again) and the owner, who proceeded to give us 4 or 5 excuses why our order was lost: the computer lost it, the printer broke, it was late (really? 7:30 pm?), they were tired, etc. They tried very hard to convince us that we wanted to come back again, so much so that they drove us out of the restaurant (we didn't want to insult them, but they were insistent...).\n\nThe room is noisy; there seems to be a large number of staff behind the counter, and they managed to loudly drop piles of dishes a couple of times. They had problems with the lights several times too; while not much of an issue, it again suggests a lack of experience. We wish we loved our visit, but it's not just about the food.\n\nNote to owners: you can't talk customers into loving you, nor your restaurant.

And the owner - Prem - is a huge part of it. \n\nIt's a small intimate place so all the tables were taken up at first. Prem sat us in some nice plush chairs, gave us each a glass of red or white wine and then apologized for the \"wait\". We were seated in less than 10 minutes so I really don't know what \"wait\" he was talking about.\n\nWe split an order of pork momos and each ordered the Chicken Cashew Cream Curry for our entree. The pork momos are solid - it's really hard to hate on any culture's version of dumplings. As for the chicken curry, I always try and order what the restaurant is known for the first time. And boy do I get why people rave about this dish. The texture is buttery smooth and the chicken is sweet and flavorful. Pro-tip: if you're a big fan of na'an, ask them to substitute the rice that comes with the dish with more servings of na'an. \n\nThe best part though was Prem. He kept coming back and checking up on us to see how we were doing and was very diligent about making sure our wine glasses weren't empty. If you get a chance to talk to him, his story is a fascinating one. Before he was a cook here in SF, he worked in Nepal as a sherpa, acting as a hired guide to help foreigners and American tourists hike up Mount Everest. So he REGULARLY scaled one of the toughest mountains to climb in the world. \n\nWe stayed until closing time and Prem never pressured us to leave. At the very end of the meal, when we got the bill, he came up and checked the bill and said to us, \"I just want to make sure that he didn't charge you for the wine.\"\n\nPREM - YOU ARE THE MAN! \n\nIf you're a fan of Nepalese food, definitely come to Cuisine of Nepal.

Their signature dish, the cashew cream curry chicken, is a delicious alternative to our usual boring Indian food order of chicken Tikka Masala. The Himalayan Momo dumplings are similar to pot stickers, but they are steamed and come with a delicious spicy sesame sauce.\n\nChef/owner Prem Tamang is genuine, modest and gracious. He engaged us in a great conversation and made sure everything was perfect.\n\nInexpensive and delicious ethnic cuisine served in a friendly atmosphere is very rare in today's SF foodie restaurant culture. I'm glad we found that rare experience right her at Cusine of Nepal.", "author": "Dan C."}

I love Nepalese dishes because it is savory, balanced, and makes my body feel happy (not happy from a side effect from the MSG, they don't use it here). I wanted to eat here everyday but my friends said I had to roam the foodie highway while in SF. I ordered the Pharsi, and Chana Saag. I cannot eat gluten but I luckily had my gluten aid caps with me to help me stave off some of the side effects and did eat the butter naan. \n\nI will be back again when I land in SF.

We had the popular chicken with cashew cream curry and it was pretty damn good; tender boneless chicken with a perfectly blended curry sauce that just begged to dipped in by some fresh butter naan (and that did in fact occur).  I would put it up there with some of the best chicken tikka masala dishes I've had so it's worth to go here just for this item.  The samosas we started with were pretty amazing too, both the veggie and minced lamb ones had a perfect crust and equally tasting fillings though quite different from one another. The fresh tamarind sauce wasn't needed but definitely added a whole other dimension.  So why not epic? Well the basil lamb curry was just so-so, like not bad but not great.  For 5 stars, you have to be epic all around.  Tough, huh? Well, there are more delicious things to try so maybe it will rise to 5 stars!

We went to Cuisine of Nepal for my partner's birthday and it was one of the best meals we've ever had (for some of the most affordable prices in SF!). The restaurant is really cozy and small, but beautifully decorated. We got the butternut squash curry (~$16) and the salmon sizzler plate (~$19) combos. The perfect amount of food for two people to share with just a small bit leftover. It was nice to each have our own rice, naan, veggies, lentils, and chutney rather than sharing them. The salmon was served as fajitas in Mexican restaurants are -- sizzling on a cast iron dish. Perfectly cooked, though could have used a bit more spice (we requested hot for both our dishes.). The chef came out midway through the meal and made sure our meal was great, otherwise he \"would fix it!\" We left full, satisfied, and glad to give our money to a restaurant that has such incredible service. \n\nPlease go!

They went out of their way to provide us with refills, sides, and menu recommendations. Far from pushy, the owner actually recommended we not order more than we did, which I've never experienced. \n\nFood: The food was very reasonably priced. A dinner set for two was $48, and included two beers, a mountain of appetizers (samosas, a cubed meat dish, and momos), a bamboo shoot based curry, naans, rice, more dipping sauces...needless to say, I was stuffed by the time the entrees even arrived. I took home more than half of the food I ordered, and I'm a big eater who can demolish two Chipotle burritos in one sitting. \n\nAtmosphere: the place is charming, with seating for about 30.

The person who seated us seemed a bit annoyed that we didn't want to sit right by the door (it was early and the place was still empty), but the man and woman who served us our wonderful meal were both very friendly and helpful. The owner also came by to see if everything was to our liking (\"yes!\").\n\nWe had the pork momos - excellent dumplings with a just-right spicy sauce - for an appetizer. These are a must have. Next up was the chicken kebab, which were excellent and not really spicy as some reviewers said, but very moist and tasty. Will definitely order again. We had the sizzling lamb, which was good and definitely sizzling. If you like your lamb rare like we do, move the meat to a different plate right away or it will keep cooking on the sizzling platter. We also liked the squash curry dish and will definitely order that again. \n\nWe normally order dishes a la carte, but here it makes sense to get the \"combo\" option with at least one or two of your dishes. In addition to the usual rice, you get naan, vegetable curry and lentils, plus some of the excellent sauce that comes with the momos. One member of my group commented that, unlike many east Asian places, they don't ask if you want your food mild, medium, or hot. We all agreed that when the chef really knows what he's doing, they don't need to ask. That is certainly the case here; we look forward to coming back!", "author": "Meredith S."}

Momos are Nepali dumplings that are served with a delicious sauce called achar, which is basically crack with spices. Once I  had homemade momos and I've been dreaming of those little morsels ever since.  In my travels around the nation, if I hear there's a Nepali restaurant in town, I've made it a point to stop in and see if I could get my hands on some momos, but from restaurants in D.C. to Wisconsin, and even South Dakota, I could not find momos that came close to those delicious homemade momos. I even got the recipe from a Nepali woman and still could not replicate the amazingness of those homemade momos. However, my search for the ultimate  momos ended at Cuisine of Nepal. OMG. You guys need to get your butt down here and eat some momos. They nailed it. The secret sauce to great momos is literally the sauce (aka achar) that's served on the side and at Cuisine of Nepal the achar is just right - it's the right balance of flavors, spices, acidity, and texture. We tried other dishes here and they were all SO GOOD. The portions are huge. We had plenty of leftovers for dinner the next day  . The owner walks around and serves everyone and he is so kind. It's clear that he takes a lot of pride in his work. Enough gushing - just stop in. It's worth it!", "author": "Alison H."}

I liked the sweetness of the mango shake, which is marked as a neighborhood favourite. I think they use alfonso mango puree in it. You can choose whether you want your curry mild, medium, hot or extra hot. I don't usually eat spicy foods, so I went with mild.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender, and had remarkable flavors throughout the meat. I usually don't like to write reviews unless the place is new, and I want it to do well. (Or the place is remarkable for other reasons that I think other Yelpers have not yet picked up on.) We learned from the owner that the official opening is not until Saturday.
