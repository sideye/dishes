My friend bought a sandwich and we shared that together and then opened our laptops to work. The woman who was working there came to me after a while and asked me if I don't wanna buy anything from them in a very rude and unpleasant way. I told her we are together and my friend bought something and we shared. Then she said your friend did and why you don't buy.  I explained for her again that we are together and we just needed one sandwich to share cause I'm not that much hungry . And I told her that's so weird. Suddenly she started to yell at me \"what's so weird?!!!! Go out if you don't want buy anything\".

I then decided to not order and leave. On my way out with my son, she lashed out with verbal abuse at me and told me to get the FUCK OUT!!!! I was so completely shocked by her verbal attack, especially in front of my 5 year old son and other customers including young children.  Has anybody had a similar experience??? Is this the typical service you get here? I looked around the place before I ordered and you can tell the place is unhygienic and the portions were tiny.

We were visiting San Fran and wanted to explore different parks and coffee shops. The place looked very cute and trendy on the outside so we decided to stop by. Parking is a little difficult but that is expected in a city such as San Fransisco. We ordered two lattes, exactly the same with one non fat milk and he other with almond milk. Both had the same flavor, hazelnut. Each drink was made without flavor and we sent them back. The owner was very rude and told us she hadn't charged us for flavor. Her mistake. So we explained how we both ordered the same drink but with different types of milk and she argued with us. Then she poured another latte with nonfat milk and told us it was almond. My friend is a vegan and milk really makes her sick. So I asked for her to make the next with almond milk and both women were super angry and told us we were wrong and didn't order it like that. \n\nTo top it off, the coffee was average.

That's too bad because I like the space here, a casual hipster/thrift-shop gallery vibe with plenty of tables for long-term laptoppers in need of self-absorption (see photos). Of course that's probably part of the problem since the owners probably need to use a well-greased spatula to get some of them to get out of their chairs, and considering their five o'clock shadows, I don't believe personal hygiene is a priority for them. And I'm just talking about the women.\n\nProximity to Dolores Park, the Castro and the Mission make this an attractive spot for a caffeine pick-me-up, and prices appear to be in the standardized Starbucks range, for example, $1.95 for a large coffee. It was nothing that would keep Phil up at night, but it did keep me upright for the short walk to the park. Perhaps to their chagrin, they also serve food here beyond the predictable selection of pastries - quiches, piroshkis, four sandwiches, a slice of spanikopita and a soup de jour. All appear reasonably priced in case you want to hold a marathon blogging session. I've been reading about a singing barista, but there was nary a peep from the staff when I was there, just the hyped-up keyboard tapping you would expect in a designated house of caffeine.\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...standard cup of joe with standard pricing\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a potentially cool space, but the populace hardly moves\nSERVICE - 2 stars...pretty surly...should I take it personally?\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a convenient coffee stop on the way to Dolores Park and not much more", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-04", "description": "I'm a regular at Maxfields and I really like coming here for the following reasons.\n\nLots of drink options: They have your standard coffee drinks, a wide selection of bag teas, bottled drinks, fresh oj, beer wine and blended drinks for people who are into that sort of thing.\n\nSolid food:  The have good breakfast sandwiches, standard lunch sandwiches, bagels, wraps,  fruit, and pastries. Some people have complained about cookies being stale.  They don't make their cookies, they get them from local bakers so I don't quite understand that complaint. All the cookies and pastries are wrapped in plastic or covered so I think Maxfield's is doing their best to preserve their freshness\n\nLots of natural light: The front of the cafe is almost all windows so natural lighting fills the space until late afternoon/evening when the overhead lights fill in. The natural light is great when I'm reading books and is nice since I'm on my laptop most of the time i'm there. \n\nLots of seating: they have a good variety of seating, small, medium and large tables and a few couches that can meet the needs of individuals and big groups. \n\nLots of power outlets: Like I mentioned I work on my laptop and it is very rare when I can't plug in if I need to.  Power is accessible from almost every seat in the cafe save a couple. \n\nFree-ish wi-fi: The wi-fi is free for customers and reliable. Once in a blue moon the internet will slow down, usually when the cafe is full of computer users, or just hasn't worked but the staff have quickly remedied the problem when it's brought to their attention. The wi-fi seems to be an issue with some reviewers  so i'm going to reiterate what I said before, the wi-fi is free for customers. This means if your buddy shows up and whips out his macbook the staff is going to ask him to buy something.  This is a reasonable request.\n\nSolid service: Morning, afternoon or evening the service is quick and accurate.  The only time my order gets delayed is when a few people before me have ordered espresso drinks or there are a bunch of sandwich orders before mine.  And when they aren't busy they will even bring your food to you if they know where you are sitting.  \n\nThe comments about the baristas being rude or that they hate their life are way off the mark.  Sure some of the ladies that work here can be curt but its a cultural thing.  They are not trying to be rude but they are also not going to coddle you, hold your hand while you order and become your BFF the first time you walk in the door.  If you want that kind of place this isn't it.  If you come here regularly and you want to chat and get to know them your're going to have to initiate things the first few times.  \n\nUltimately, Maxfields is an unpretentious neighborhood cafe that has everything I need during a days work and the more I come the more I've come to enjoy the people who work here and the the regulars who help give it its particular character.", "author": "Eric Z."}

Its a great place to pick up some cold drinks and sandwiches.

After reading the reviews I will agree that the woman that owns the place (at least I believe she owns it) can be kind of abrasive. I've seen her be short with people and she's been short with me on occasions. Especially about the 5 dollar credit card limit. I understand that lots of places in the mission only take cash or have a limit, but when you're a coffee shop it really seems like a poor business decision to not accommodate the people who just want their morning coffee. I've learned to bring cash with me or order something to eat with my beverage. Otherwise I think this place is great.

There are local artists featured on the walls in an ever-changing gallery. There is a waling tour group that comes through every day around 12:30, so there's amazing people-watching fodder on a regular basis. And the barista plays an eclectic mix of sing-alongable music that seems to really drive home the carefree and joyful vibe this city is famous for. \n\nThe fare is standard for San Francisco coffee shops, but I truly love the distinct character of this space.

The plan for the other particular day of the week is working out a little bit better, and I think that's because the other location* is a place nearer and dearer to my heart, although that's not technically true because my heart (and my entire body) reside only about a mile from Maxfield's while the other location is way out by Ocean Beach.  It just goes to show that the best laid--I know, I know; it doesn't help one's creativity to needlessly and carelessly quote quoted quotes.\n\nThe food is all right.  The people who work here could be friendlier, but then so could the clientele.  This seems to be a hotbed for people looking for jobs.  The last time I was here, I eavesdropped on three separate job-interview conversations.  One guy had already been offered a job, and he seemed to be holding out for more money.  After that conversation ended, I listened to him explain to his brother that he had been looking for a job for three months and that he was terrified that the place would balk at his hard bargain.  I have all kinds of opinions about that, both positive and negative, but I was impressed by the guy's confident wheeling and dealing; there wasn't a smidgen of doubt in the guy's voice.\n\nI'm going to try again, but don't count on it working out.\n\n*It's not that I'm paranoid, but consider my slight mysteriousness an impotent rebellion against the constant need to broadcast where one is and what one is doing at all times.

Unfortunately, it's run by a bunch of sociopaths. \n\nYou will read similar stories in other reviews.  We entered with our year old son one early morning.  As we waited for our order, he approached one of the PCs there and played with the mouse.  The barista - who btw didn't sing (see other reviews) - started screaming repeatedly: \"Sir! Get your kid off of the computer!\".  I was standing right behind my son, and it was clear I'm watching him and won't let him damage anything.  Moreover, the mouse in question was a 2 button, non-optical one, so it's worth maybe $3.  I have never been screamed at like that.  Even a polite request would have been weird given the situation, so such screams were completely uncalled for.  We took our stuff to go and left.\n\nThe place is just not hospitable. There are signs everywhere warning customers repeated purchases are expected if one is to use the \"free\" wifi (as if it's such a unique offering).  They don't have a baby high chair and tables were left dirty long after customers left.  And it's cash only, which I find annoying.\n\nSo aside from service, the food: 2 mediocre cappuccinos and airplane like cold, gummy bagels.  Pretty miserable, if pretty cheap.\n\nIf these guys are banking on a Soup Nazi like attitude, the least they could do is offer quality products.

Aside from being a great place to work, there are couches and outdoor seating perfect for a chat or board game with a friend. It's proximity to Dolores Park and Bi-Rite Creamery makes it a great place to spend a day working, then playing.\n\nHowever, I had an experience that will never send me there again.\n\nYesterday, a friend and I went their to work on our laptops. Immediately, he bought an iced coffee while I proceeded to work. Soon after we arrived, a woman who I presume is the owner approached me and asserted that if I were to use her wi-fi, I should purchase a drink.\n\nI agree. Normally, I always buy a drink and some snacks whenever I'm at a cafe and I have plenty of times before at Maxfield's. But I had a big breakfast and a cup of water so I wasn't in the mood at that time to get anything. And I also did not appreciate the fact that she applying a lot of pressure for me to do so.\n\nA few minutes later, she called for my attention again. \"Excuse me, are you going to get a drink? Because if you're not I'm going to have to charge you for every minute you use the wi-fi.\"\n\nLet's discuss this. I think its the ethical thing to purchase something if you were to use their space and Internet. However, I don't think it's a good business practice to regulate your whole store, going from person to person to make sure they purchase something.\n\nDoes that create an inviting space? Will it make the customers want to come back again, even if they do purchase something at that time? Probably not.\n\nThis is what I told her and I left. As people increasing use cafes as a space to study and work away from home as I do, it's important and courteous to support the business who offer their space and wireless. I do and I probably would've in that situation if she approached in a less demanding and brash fashion.\n\nI understand her frustration and her point of view, but if she continues that approach I feel like it won't be an enjoyable space for either the cafe's owner or its patrons.", "author": "Valerie L."}

It was a cute scene for a Sunday afternoon.\n\nI then walked up to the counter and ordered my iced tea. Now I can't say that the woman was all that friendly, but she was by no means rude, just sort of indifferent which was kind of a bummer, since nothing pairs better with a caffeine drink then a little smile. As for the iced tea, it hit the spot and made for a refreshing addition to my Dolores Park Sunday. Not sure that I would rush back here again, but if I ever find myself heading to the park via Dolores, I might give them another go in the hopes that their face muscles are looking up that day :)", "author": "Stephy S."}

Every day that I fill my coffee cup up with decaf Major Dickenson's Roast I think, what a pussy you are Claire, why can't you just suck it up and drink the leaded shit?  Then, I have a dark chocolate cookie and have a panic attack, so really we're all better off.  Anyway, \"out of decaf\" leads me to some shitty ass tea, which you really can't fault them for cause it comes in a bag, etc etc. \n\nSo I secure a spot in the corner and turn my attention to all of the guys in the room.

Fun, upbeat '90s stuff is on the current playlist.  Plus he's super-friendly and willing to jump around to New Order if you force the subject.  It makes working late a lot more pleasant.\n\nSadly, the wireless invariably drops at least once, if not more frequently, every time I'm there.

I told her that I had asked for a 16 ounce coffee and the thermos says 16 ounce capacity on the side and why had she given me a half a cup of coffee.\nShe grumbled something about it looking larger.\nYes this is petty but really are you going to treat customers like this over 8 ounces of mediocre coffee.

Dull atmosphere, super dull and slow barrista's, nothing special coffee or espresso and (god, is she really the owner? because she doesn't seem to have it together enough for this kind of business.) And after reading Phil M's review all I can say is that this is a good spot to go pee when the line is too long at Dolores Pk Cafe. (like during the dyke march.) My hope for this place is that some other person buys it and makes it better. I don't think D. Pk Cafe will suffer much from the competition.  They're doing well.", "author": "Roanna Z."}

I've been in this place four times since I moved back here, 2 for 4, \nI got a better than good Americano.  For the record, a standard americano is 2 shots with some hot water.  The barista should ask the customer how much water he or she wants.  Otherwise why wouldn't we just order a coffee?  Twice my drink was served in a porcelain mug and I was asked how much water I wanted so the drink was tasty, good, heavy body, just enough water, just short of an eight ounce cup, some crema on top, not intentional but appreciated.  Twice I was charged for a double americano and was served some brown water in a huge, maybe 20 ounce clear glass, the kind you would use for iced tea or drinking water.\nYucky.  I had noticed that both times the house mugs, nice size for me were there waiting to be filled.  The ladies there are really nice and fast, the guy was kind of dismissive, lots of tables and you can even sit outside and diddle on the net or watch the parade of hipsters go by, so for service and atmosphere it's definitely a 5.  I heard that a stellar coffee concession will be going into Dolores Park, not down for it but maybe I can get  an americano that's consisitently good.", "author": "Teri K."}

I'm one of those laptop nomads who lives in the area and Maxfields is one of my regular places to eat and work. \n\nThe pluses:\n* Mellow, mellow vibe (I love mellow, kick-back, casual cafes). I'm not there for a \"scene\" or anything in-your-face.\n* The cafe interior is airy with high-ceilings (unlike some of the more cramped cafes in the area). There are large windows fronting Dolores St. and so the cafe gets a good amount of natural light. In fact, on sunny days, you might want to avoid the couches adjacent the windows as you'll get a ton of laptop glare.\n* The staff is nice\n* They have a lot of vegan options (if you're into that). The vegan cookies and breads (banana, pumpkin, etc) are very tasty -- and I'm not even vegan.\n* Outlets are pretty easy to get to if you know where to sit\n* I've never had a problem getting a seat here\n* Nice mix of patrons: You get all sorts here. Startup people, kids, D&D dudes...the whole lot. Nice change from some of the more homogeneous spots where it's row after row of laptop peoples.\n\nMinuses:\n* Coffee is decent, not great (this is Jumpin' Java Cafe level coffee -- don't expect your Blue Bottle experience here)\n* Sometimes you'll get a singing barista. Doesn't bug me so much, but there's one dude in the afternoon that likes to sing along to his ipod playlists.\n\nPublic Service Announement: If you're a nomadic startup guy, like me, who frequents cafes. Please do your part to SUPPORT the cafe. Buy stuff, tip 'em, make room for other patrons if you have room at your table and the place is full. I say this partly out of guilt, since I vowed since Canvas died to be a better cafe citizen in the future (r.i.p. Canvas Cafe -- we used and abused you to death)", "author": "David P."}
