Customer service was friendly enough, but they would only communicate through email, never by phone even when I left voicemails, which was fine with me as long as they replied. I sent over 3-4 photos of the cake design I wanted and was specific in my email when finalizing the design. I wanted a small elephant on top of the cake with a balloon. The final cake design had a huge elephant (I'm talking 4-5 times the size of the photos I sent) on top of it with no balloon. The cake tasted good, not delicious, not bad, but decent. I flew in from LA, picked up the cake attended the baby shower and flew back home so I didn't feel the need to contact Cake Coquette about my disappointment in the design, but I'm writing this review so that others who are ordering make sure to follow up on your cake design to ensure that you get what you want. Especially bc they are not cheap and I paid over $200 for the cake. I've attached two photos to show what I wanted and what I got. The scale was completely off.

What I received was a cake with solar panels that were uneven, jagged lines and icing stains on the ribbon. They didn't even have the decency to cut our logo straight. The final project was rushed and looked like an amateur made it. That was just the exterior. The cake itself was supposed to be caramel creme. I am not a professional baker, but I know enough that the caramel was burnt as it had sugar crystals in the icing.

They were one of the only bakeries willing to do a small cake at the last minute. They were very responsive by email. We chose to have a hazelnut flavored cake with chocolate and hazelnut ganach filling. Because this was so last minute, we did not get to do a cake tasting beforehand but the cake was delicious and it turned out beautifully! I will definitely be going to them for my future cake needs!", "author": "Vanessa M."}

We had the pleasure of meeting her before our wedding this past month when we went in for a cake tasting. Her shop was very cool and she had so many great samples for us to choose from. The design she created for us was amazing. She listened to exactly what we asked for and then went 100 steps beyond to create the perfect wedding cake for us. It tasted amazing and all of our guests loved the design. I highly recommend Gabby. She is professional responsive and an amazing artist. Thank you Gabby so much!i", "author": "M K."}

Tons of flavors to choose from and beautiful artistry in the designs. I had a hard time finding a shop that 1) would make gum paste flowers and 2) made them well. Cake Coquette definitely hit the mark! I ended up getting the vanilla cake with raspberry jam, cream cheese filling and fresh strawberries in a 4-tier cake AND a sheet of the hazelnut flavor to serve approx 300 people. I didn't want any fondant so I went with buttercream. Delicious! Everyone enjoyed it and I didn't have much left over. If I could re-do the wedding cake, the only thing I would have changed is ordering a 5-tier (instead of 4-tier) cake! I can't wait for our wedding anniversary; we decided to re-order the same flavors for our anniversary cake!", "author": "Grace L."}

They deserve all the complimentary. \n\nSince I live in China, and it's an overseas wedding, it was impossible for us to meet face to face before the wedding, and I also couldn't go to their store or workshop for sample taste; besides, we have 15-hour jet lag, all the communications were made in emails. However, our communications were very smooth and efficient, since Gabby's team was very professional. Normally I sent out emails during daytime in our time zone, and I could always get her feedback next morning on time. What I did was sent to them sample pictures I liked and asked them if they were able to do the similar thing and told them how many guests we had. Gabby would suggest the size of our wedding cake, provide different favors they had and estimate the total cost. We didn't encounter any problems during our communication. Gabby took down all my detailed requests in different emails, and didn't miss one single item. And all the payments had been cleared before the wedding, which was really efficient and straightforward.\n\nOn the wedding day, I didn't have chance to meet any staff from Cake Coquette; when they came and did preparation, I was taking my wedding photos outdoor. When I was ready for the reception, my wedding coordinator told me that everything was set, including the wedding cake, cupcakes and cookies.  As I walked into the restaurant, I was definitely impressed by the beautiful wedding cake as well as those very exquisite desserts. All these items were made exactly as same as the picture I provided. I had to say that their workmanship was perfect, which making the cake table a shining point on my wedding. And they looked so pretty in the lens, please check those lovely pictures. The style and color matched the soft ambient uplighting perfectly. Besides, the cake and desserts were also very tasty. We even brought the rest of cake to our after party and we really liked the chocolate favor. \n\nI was so glad that my wedding was such a big success, because overseas wedding is certainly not an easy job. And Cake Coquette definitely contributed lots of efforts on that. I really appreciate their exquisite services. I also feel sorry because I didn't have chance to thank their staff personally, to avoid disturbing us, they just came and left quietly. So it's our obligation to write down our appreciation online and say thanks to all the staff from Cake Coquette. Well done!", "author": "Jessie W."}

The fondant smelled and tasted like play dough, the  vanilla cake tasted like nothing, and the chocolate vegan butter cream tasted like watered-down  peanut butter clay.....2 stars for the nice LOOK of the cake, -3 for the (1) horrific taste, (2) extremely high price (for the size and taste!), (3) not being able to taste test ANY cakes from her beforehand.", "author": "Jazmin B."}

A couple of days later, I couldn't resist, but ask if we can make it 5 tiers and the top one being a different flavor, within a day or so, Gabby replied to my email to confirm that's not a problem. She not only responds timely, which I think other vendors should take note of, but she also says almost \"yes\", to everything.

Two of my closest friends got married this past weekend 5/16. One of them is a full vegan and as a gift we decided to purchase their Wedding Cake. She had found Gabby and her staff at Cake Coquette, to make her petite 3 tiered \"Vegan Chocolate Wedding Cake\", and wow everyone was glad she did. The cake was delicious, moist, not overly sweet, and easily one of the best (maybe the best) chocolate cake, of any kind I have ever tasted and I grew up with a Mother who made Wedding cakes! It was beautiful and the taste was incredible! My husband and our family have had many negative run ins with \"vegan and /or \"gluten free desserts\" but what Gabby created was delicious and so beautiful. The design was simple white fondant with royal blue piping, perfection! I will make sure everyone I know finds out about Cake Coquette! We have no gluten allergies in our family and we eat pretty much anything that is home prepared, ( my Husband and I like knowing what is in our family's food). This cake was not only delicious but it was also the single best experience I have ever had with a bakery. Normally, we have the cake arrive with the set up person, they find out where to set up they coordinate with the Florist and after a quick check in, they are done; this was not the case with Talya, Gabby's assistant!\nI cannot possibly explain how helpful she was. \nWith nothing more than a hastily sketched photo on my cell as a set up template, she completely helped us set up and arrange all the tables and the Wedding cake table correctly, inquired about flowers, and the Florist we went through in Sacramento where we live, had given us a few extra flowers in case something happened to my floral arranging skills, and we were able to incorporate the unused ones into the cake; making it even lovelier than it was and Talya didn't leave until everything was set up, 5 stars for service alone! \nBut it was the taste knocked everyone for a loop, absolutely incredible! I am so happy my friend found and chose Cake Coquette bakery, I plan many, many, Weddings, this one was especially dear to me as they are such great friends of mine. Sometimes you have a neighborhood or little bakery for your go to even for your Wedding cake.

Good thing we did!! We made an appointment to do a tasting and to give our design idea.\n\nWe had a superhero cake theme (more my idea) and while we were tasting and talking comic book movies Gabby sketched out our vision. The day of the event, everyone loved her design. We did not get a chance to thank her personally because she had other deliveries to make. We could not be happier with what she came up with and her prices were amazing for what we got. Her attention to detail and pride in her work shows. The cake was very delicious as well. \n\nIf you are planning an event where you need a custom cake please choose Gabby and Cake Coquette. I have been telling everyone about her who sees the cake. \n\nThank you again Gabby for your amazing work!!\n\nShawn and Shane", "author": "Robert Shawn W."}

I was really hoping to have a good experience with them so I could hire them for my wedding next August. I hired Cake Coquette to design my Fianc\u00e9's 27th Birthday cake and I was completely disappointed. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is Gabby was very fast in responding to my request and emails. The transaction process was easy and went smoothly and the cake even arrived 40 minutes early which was great. I was just disappointed in their execution, which is the most important. From their pictures on Yelp I know they are capable of producing a better looking cake. I believe they were busy and delivered a rush job. The cake was inspired by my fianc\u00e9 basketball skill development start up. The jersey on the cake was not placed like I requested and the numbers on the jersey were put on very sloppy, the basketball on the cake looked cheap and his logo was digitally printed and looked horrible, which is not what I requested. I sent them a screenshot of his logo but I didn't think they would use that. It was just to give them an idea of what it looked like. If they were going to place a digital copy of his logo on the cake they could've asked me for a high resolution image. The cake colors were even wrong and were never verified with me. My fianc\u00e9 thought I was going for a Golden State Warrior theme because instead of using orange, one of his company colors, the used yellow :( . They even placed stars on the cake which was totally kiddish for a 27 year old man. When I mentioned it to them they said they do it for a lot of their cakes, so if you don't want stars on your cake you better tell them specifically. The image I sent and through the design I communicated I never once mentioned stars. To me they just did a total rush job. The cake looked sloppy. They should've taken more time and put more effort into making my fianc\u00e9's birthday cake and they would have gotten several more orders from me including my wedding cake. The cake wasn't good either. It wasn't moist at all. Tasted very thick and was very hard to swallow.", "author": "Courtney C."}

I had met with Cake Coquette around March to talk in detail about what we wanted for our wedding cake and to have a tasting.  Everything tasted wonderful and the customer service was great.  I really enjoyed working with Talya in their cute showroom in Bernal Heights.\n\nSo fast forward to the wedding reception day.  I've been telling my now husband for days how excited I am to see our beautiful cake.  It's supposed to be a 3 tier gold cake with an Art Deco/antique styling.  Just really unique, over the top, and decadent.  So I'm at the Cliff House setting up and crazed because everyone's pulling me to all different directions.  The cake comes in and is being set up.  I see it from afar.  My heart sank a little bit.  It was not what I was expecting or what was shown in my inspiration photo.  I wanted luxe, sophistication, jewels... What I saw was a bedazzled cake.  It was more animated than sophisticated.  Not to mention that one of the middle tier was uneven and leaning a little too much to one side.\n\nI had a lot of hopes for this cake.  All in all, it turned out fine.  We still got compliments on it and it still turned out great in photos (in certain angles).  I really didn't have any issues with the customer service, they were one of the more pleasant vendors to work with.  But still thinking about the cake now makes me a little sad.  I had high hopes =(", "author": "Rica S."}

I could have never imagined a more seamless transaction or spectacular cake, so all you brides-to-be out there, take notice!  Your search begins and ends here.\n\nResiding in Long Beach, I didn't have the opportunity to visit many shops or talk to anyone in person. Armed only with a couple ideas that I wanted to incorporate, I basically needed to hire someone who made me feel like I was in good hands and Gabby more than delivered.  She was quick on the email responses, communicative and friendly....and once I told her my flavor choices and a couple ideas (ie \"bindi-like design\"...vague, right?), she assured me that she could make something delicious as well as beautiful.  The reviews on Yelp already speak for themselves, but I just wanted to add...I never ONCE spoke to Gabby.  All communication was by email. She was attentive when I needed her to be, and took the initiative to exercise the creativity I was hiring her for without bogging me down with details.  I know a lot of gals probably want to micro-manage their wedding details, but in my case, I just wanted to find someone trustworthy, say what I wanted, pay when I needed to, and let the professional handle the rest.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Gabby did.  We ordered a vanilla buttercream with raspberry and strawberry filling with sugar calla lillies on top where a topper would have been (but I liked her idea better), it was delivered on time, it stood flawlessly at our reception for four hours, and the staff at my reception even told me at the evening's end that They loved cutting into her cake...(I guess some cakes create big probs...but not Gabby's!).  Totally delicious, beautiful, and classy.  Gabby is a true professional so my only warning would be to book her early because I imagine she will only get more popular.  Any time I end up in San Francisco here on out, I will celebrate the occasion with one of her creations.  I was quoted over $600 for the same cake at a couple other places...crazy considering I only had a party of 12. Designed and delivered for $220.  Again, unbelievable.  I feel like whatever good karma I've accrued in my life was paid off in spades by finding Gabby.    I never knew I could get so happy about a cake! :)\n\nThank you Gabby, for being the kind of gal I needed and wanted to work with, for making our wedding reception that much more memorable, and for your astute professionalism.

There are professionals for a reason, and with some relief, we committed to handing over this element of our wedding celebration to one.\n\nGabrielle of Cake Coquette made the cake of my dreams -- even now, it hurts me that I didn't have more time to just marvel at the beauty of the frosting work. She took the point of inspiration - a certain artist's abstract paintings - and rendered it in buttercream, adding the ingenious element of sprinkles for more texture. Not only was it unique, vibrant, but of course it was absolutely delicious. The raspberry vanilla flavour was not overly sweet, just right for the subtle-sweetooths of my asian family.

When I mean GREAT SERVICE I mean Gabby literally was in contact with me the same evening. She agreed to making my custom cake that would normally take a week to complete. Unfortunately when I came to pickup my order Gabby had already left so I was unable to thank her. But the cake turned out to be PERFECT.  My friend so enjoyed her birthday especially the beautifully decorated cake. Such an amazing experience to have companies still go out of there way for the customer.  I will totally be using there services again and again and again!  This is the kind of service that needs to be duplicated and spread to other companies and organizations. ... Gabby is awesome! !!", "author": "Lila N."}

We decided we wanted an SF cityscape theme, and set about finding someone to make it for us.  Many bakeries turned us away due to the project being so small.  Others quoted us really high ($175 for a 7 inch cake - really??).  Gabby came back with the best estimate, and we decided to move forward with her due to that plus her stellar Yelp record.  At first we were a little unsure because her emails came across as a bit brusque and she only offers complimentary tastings to bigger-budget projects (we didn't want to commission a cake we hadn't tried).  However, once it became clear that we were legitimate customers who weren't just trolling for free cake samples, she offered us a reasonably priced tasting sample box, which contained one delicious flavor after another.  We chose one of the samples she offered, even though she said she'd work with us to do something custom if we wished, and commissioned the project entirely through email.  We sent a few pictures of examples of what we were thinking, and crossed our fingers hoping she'd be able to match the modern theme of our wedding and provide something that made the expenditure worth it.\n\nGabby absolutely nailed it.  The cake was beyond cool, and was everything we hoped it would be and more.  She listened to us and delivered everything we asked for, and even included a small moon and star embellishment on the top that really finished it off.  The cake was delicious, and it was a total showstopper to look at.  I will absolutely return to Cake Coquette for future cake needs, and would recommend Gabby unequivocally to anyone with cake needs large or small.  It seems that she is quite busy (a testament to her skill and quality of her product) so I would recommend getting in touch early to be able to work with her.  In an industry that often takes advantage of people through unfair markups, Gabby gave us a fair price, and explained in her estimate how the amount of work required related to the cost.  The cake she made was well worth it, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the product as well as the professional business dealings and the absolute artistry of her work.  Highly, highly recommended.", "author": "Sebastian B."}

I settled with Cake Coquette because they had such great reviews but more importantly, they seemed as excited as I was about my wedding cake. Frankly, there was nothing worse than looking over pictures of cakes with a tired, uncreative cake maker who could not think outside the box. My experience with Cake Coquette was great from the start. I brought my ideas of what I wanted, brought a few pictures for inspiration and sat down to talk cake. After a short while, Tayla had drawn a sketch of a cake that had all the elements I wanted. It was like she waved a magic wand and my dream cake was suddenly on paper! The cake itself was delicious and I still think about it. The final product was splendid, just what I envisioned for my wedding. Tayla let me know that since she would soon be on pregnancy leave, Gabby, the owner would be my go to from the initial stage. Communication was very good after that and she was prompt with replying to my emails. The cake was delivered without a hitch and she set it up beautifully on the cake stand I had made. I could not be more pleased with the work and service from Cake Coquette. If you want a cake that is a true piece of art, look no further.", "author": "Gen W."}

Might as well give the bride 3 out of 5 stars, right?\n\nWell, guess what?  I am not even getting married, and I am giving Gabby, aka Cake Coquette, 5 enthusiastic stars.  You see, my friend is planning his wedding, and I, as his best man, try to help whenever I can.  I am sure they could have handled cake tasting on their own, but . . . come on!  Who knows more about cake than I?  In the words of Chris Rock, \"fat people don't fail cooking classes.\"\n\nYou would be hard pressed to find a nicer and more patient person than Gabby.  It took my friend and his bride a long time to make a decision, and it probably would have taken longer if I hadn't been there.  (Sorry, I had to give myself a little plug here).  Every question we asked, every challenge we tried to throw at her, Gabby responded with \"absolutely,\" \"no problem,\" and \"I can do that.\"\n\nIt's not surprising that we couldn't make up our minds, because every cake she showed us was truly a work of art.  If they look half as good in real life as they do in the pictures, I think the guests at my friend's wedding will be in for a real treat.\n\nGabby brought 6 cake samples for us to taste.  After much deliberation, my friend decide on a white cake with strawberry jam filling for one tier and a devil's food cake with hazelnut for their second tier.  If I had to offer some criticism--and wouldn't be a real Yelp review without it--I'd say that all cakes tasted pretty ordinary.  Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but the taste wasn't out of this world.  I guess for a wedding cake you want to have something more agreeable, so . . .  Minor details.\n\nThe price she quoted us was very, very reasonable.  I mean, for the beauty she creates, and she makes every single cake herself, she could easily charge more.\n\nOutstanding service, beautiful cakes and reasonable prices.

I checked out her website for credentials and of course her photo gallery. Based on the work that she had done, I thought she was the right candidate. Though I have never met Gabby, she seem like a great gal with a good personality. My communication with her was only through emails and phone conversations. \n\nI watch a lot of Ace of Cakes on The Food Network, so when it came to one of my dear friend's birthday, my first thought was a sculpture cake. Unlike many of the reviews, my experience with Gabby was not for a wedding cake. It was for a cake with a New York Yankees theme to it. Basically, I did a lot of research of different images related to the Yankees online and try to put them all together in my head first before presenting it to her. I emailed her a few images and gave her notes under each image of how it will come into play as a whole design. I liked how she allowed me to stay control of what I had had envisioned and try to perfect it from there and not trying to persuade me into something else. She was a good listener, which made her very attentive to all my needs for the cake. I did ask to get a picture of the cake once she was done, but that's something she explained she doesn't do. I have to admit it was hard to let go and let her just handle the whole situation without knowing how it'll come out until the party. Anyhow, once the design was done, the rest was literally a piece of cake. I went on her website and choose her Classic Chocolate Cake as the flavor, which the cake would be glazed in coffee Kahlua syrup and filled with layers of mocha buttercream. Yums. The total cost of the cake itself came out to be $220 that fitted on a half sheet, plus an extra $40 for delivery within SF. \n\nThe grand finale of the cake was obviously when it got revealed. Everyone was like ooooh and ahhhh about it, including myself. It was like the best birthday cake we had all seen! Way cool! The taste was absolutely wonderful. Mission accomplished. \n\nI do have to say that although the design and everything was great, it wasn't as great as I thought it could be. Come on, I am an Ace Of Cakes fan, of course I thought it would come out PERFECT. I am not saying it wasn't great, but I just that it could be even better, so this is why I'm not giving it five stars. But if I do have to do it again, I will still go back to Gabby because I know at least her work is great :)", "author": "Winnie L."}

Gabrielle Feuersinger is the easiest person on earth to work with, especially if you have the sense to simply let her own taste take the lead. Our bride reviewed Gabrielle's gallery, commented on elements she liked--the real flowers, the fabric ribbon effect (in frosting), and chose the flavors. When we arrived at the reception, the cake was in place and exceeded everyones expectations--and it was delicious. We gave her comparatively short notice, but Gabrielle was accommodating--and brilliant.", "author": "Peter P."}

I got married back in March of this year and I ordered my wedding cake through Cake Coquette. My husband and I planned a small intimate wedding in a very short time.

We got so many compliments the day of the wedding. Cake Coquette created an amazing cake adorned with orchids in different shades of purple, I absolutely loved it!

She made an anniversary cake for my husband's and my 50th wedding anniversary.  At first Gabby said that the smallest three-tiered cake she made was for 130 people which was way more than we needed.  But when Gabby found out it was for our 50th anniversary and that this cake would be our first \"professional\" wedding cake, she said she could make a three-tiered cake for 30 people, which was just perfect.  I really wanted a three-tiered cake because we were married while in college and didn't have much money.  We were married at my husband's parents' home and his mother made my wedding dress and the cake.  The cake was good, but it was only two-tiered and did not have flower decorations.  I explained to Gabby that I wanted a cake with yellow roses and  purple violets because both of those flowers are associated with a 50th anniversary.  She make the cake exactly as i wanted it.  It was more than I could have expected!  It was gorgeous, complete with gold piping and a gold 50 on the top.  But, it doesn't stop there,  The cake was absolutely delicious.  The bottom layer was devil food chocolate with chocolate fudge filling.  The second tier was butter milk vanilla with carmel and toffee bits filling.

We also thought our cake was BEAUTIFUL.  To stay within budget, we originally wanted something very plain - just offset white squares in 3 tier with a navy blue rim - but Gabrielle suggested adding an orange paisley element from our wedding, in just small accents around the cake - and she sent me a lovely sketch to illustrate it.  I adored it, and she was SO reasonable about adjusting the pricing so that it STILL stayed within our budget that it was a no-brainer!  We had some orange flowers in key places on cake too, but I didn't think it needed more than a little flower topper, it was so nicely iced.  \n\nWe also regret that we didn't get to go to our own tasting, because we planned our Santa Clara wedding from 3,000 miles away in Boston.  But Gabrielle had no problem doing a sampling for our friends, who reported to us that she was so sweet, all her cakes were so delicious and pretty, and they she was hands down the best option of 3 places that we sent them to.

For long story, see below.\n\nWe hired Gabrielle to design the cake for our wedding last month, and I will just say now that I had no problems with how the cake tasted.  We had two different kinds of cake, and our guests kept saying how much they loved both of them.  The price of the cake was also very reasonable.  The design of the cake was another story.  \n\nTo put it bluntly, I thought it turned out pretty ugly.  Which really surprised us because we'd seen Gabrielle's portfolio and all of her cakes were gorgeous.  Based on the pictures of her work, we were happy to tell her the look we wanted for our cake, and let her work her magic for the execution.  We sent her many images of what we wanted and emailed her several times about the design, but she was surprisingly hard to get in touch with.  She wanted to conduct everything by email--which I get--but that made it really difficult to hammer out the design details.  She sent a sketch of her ideas (after I had to ask for one) and it really didn't match what we were looking for.  We sent her an email pointing out things we thought could be different, and she seemed to get the idea.  However, when we saw the cake on the wedding day, it basically looked like her original sketch, which we'd hated.  And putting aside the fact that we didn't like the design in the first place, the work itself didn't seem up to her usual standards.  There was a lot of edging outlining things on the cake and it all looked pretty sloppy.\n\nBased on her other glowing reviews, I have to think something went wrong our weekend--she was overbooked, or hated us, or thoguht our design was tacky, or I don't know what.  My advice would be to really, really have a clear idea of what design you want and to be hands-on from the beginning of the process.", "author": "Sarah G."}

My mouth literally dropped when I saw what a beautiful cake she created.  And it tasted yummy too!!  Thank you!!!!!", "author": "Jessica A."}

Great job, would definitely come again for any special cake needs.", "author": "Rob S."}

My fiance and I picked up a sample box containing a dozen small cakes for tasting for $15.00. We decided on which flavor we liked (it was tough competition cause so many of the samples were super delicious), we gave her a picture of the wedding cake we found online and that was it! When the day arrived, the cake came in looking super beautiful and tasted absolutely delicious. All our guests LOVED it. I would highly recommend Gabby's services and will definitely utilize her services for myself in future.", "author": "Sal S."}

Wait, no could you do a cake with champagne flutes, and stars? Hold on, I think maybe something with a lot of confetti or flowers? Decisions, decisions... I had no clue. Imagine my questions when it came to deciding cake flavors. Gabby was a rockstar! Not only did she suggest and create a gorgeous cake design - bamboo garden with ornate delicate flowers - but also she made the most delicious cake flavor - kahula mocha chip. My party guests were amazed when they saw (and tasted) the cake. The conversation usually went something like this:\nParty guest: \"Wow, where did you buy the cake?\"\nGabby: \"Actually, I made it.\"\nParty guest: \"What, you made this, it's incredible. Really, you made this...it's beautiful. Lauren, did you know she made this?\"\nMe: \"Yes, I know, that's why I called her.\"\n\nSo definitely call her, when you're planning your next event and want that extra special touch! And Gabby - Thank You!", "author": "Lauren B."}

For my sister's birthday, we ordered a cake for 30 guests and Gabby helped us design a fabulous, delicious chocolate cake with butter cream frosting. The cake looked too good to eat; it was  a piece of art! We couldn't stop staring at it throughout the night.  Did i mention that the cake was perfect in every way? It was moist, and the perfect sweetness as well as visually stunning.  Gabby was so easy to work with- I will highly recommend her to anybody who needs a cake and will definitely be calling her again for the next celebration!", "author": "Michael G."}
