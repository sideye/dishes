However, I did just come back from a trip to Israel, and it's really hard to find comparable hummus and schwarma here. My friends and I came around noon on a Sunday, and it was busy with a lot of people coming in and out. It took them about 10 minutes to make our order, and we tried:\n\n-Lamb Schwarma on a Plate w/Hummus (Large /$12): The schwarma was too salty, and I didn't like the spices. The hummus was also disappointing, and wasn't very smooth. I wouldn't get this again.\n-Avocado Falafel (Falafel w/Avocado, Hummus, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickled Cabbage, Served in a Pita Pocket, $7.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_w84QAnwHJdM2nXVGIGEXg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The falafel was really good, and I loved the crispy exterior and fluffy interior. However, the rest of the pita was really uninspiring- the pita was not warm and fluffy, and the rest of the ingredients were just there, and didn't add anything flavor wise. Skip the pita pocket and just order the falafel separately.\n\nThe people working here were really nice and friendly, so I feel bad giving a low rating, but I wouldn't return based on my experience here. However, their falafel is good, so I'd definitely recommend coming here if you like falafel!

Smart choice. \n\nAfter ordering, they make your food pretty quickly so you don't have to wait for a long time. There are plenty of seats if you'd like to sit down while waiting. I stared at the hummus because it was so beautiful while waiting for my order, but it's also nice to watch them make your order. \n\nChicken kabob sandwich: \nThis looks deceivingly small but they put a lot of ingredients into it. Unfortunately, the pita bread was a bit hard. Shouldn't pita bread be soft...? However, I appreciate how they actually put a lot of chicken in it unlike other places that put like three small pieces of chicken and call it a chicken kabob sandwich. Half of it was enough to fill me up. Eat this right when you get it before it cools down. \n\nFalafels: \nYou have an option of buying half a dozen or one dozen. I recommend getting one dozen. It's more worth the money and it's so delicious, I couldn't stop eating it. They make it right after you order it, so they're extremely hot and fresh when they give it to you. \n\nSuper Falafel:\nNot bad, but I wish the lavish bread was softer. I wish I had requested the sandwich with pita bread instead, but oh well. The lavish bread was quite hard and cold. I saved this for later so I could add more hummus to it and microwave it, which made it taste so much better. I ate this with the fresh falafels that I had ordered...\n\nThe service was excellent and I really appreciate the customer service here. \n\nHonestly, I'd give this place maybe a 3/5 stars for the sandwiches but the falafels are easily worth way more than 5/5 stars.

I think I'm just super picky with the sandwiches but in my opinion, they taste a lot better if you add a lot of hummus to them, wrap them with softer and warmer pita bread, and heat them up.", "author": "Lawrence K."}

The falafels are so crispy and flavorful, I could easily eat half a dozen by myself (which, to my shame, I have done before). However, I found the kebab options kind of underwhelming. The chicken was dry, the baba ganoush was nothing to write home about, the cucumber yogurt salad was bland. \n\nThe dessert options were on the side of sickly sweet, but then again, baklava and Turkish delights are literally just sugar on sugar.\n\n1/1 Stars for Value:\nYou can easily stuff yourself for less than $10 at Sunrise Deli. I personally like to drop by for some piping hot falafels -- I think it's $4 for 6 and $6 for 12.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service:\nSuper simple set-up inside, I think most people order to-go. Once, when dining in, we ordered a dozen falafels and the woman behind the counter hooked it up with an extra falafel and free sauces (hummus and tzaziki).

I came here with my bf and we split a chicken shawarma plate and a falafel wrap.\n\nThe shawarma plate was delicious and came with a flavorful and tangy hummus. It also came with pita bread to eat it with. The falafel wrap was the best mediterranean wrap I've ever had. And I've been to several mediterranean places in berkeley. This wrap also had eggplant and other vegetables inside and was amazing. The two items really hit the spot for me and my bf. Portion sizes were decent, and enough for the two of us.\n\nPrices are cheap. Everything on the menu is great value. \n\nService was timely and people were friendly.

I remembered being a recent San Jose transplant going to SF State and unfortunately I didn't have a whole lot of money. I was walking outside one day and just happen to walk by when one of the possible owners called me in, \"Bro, have you ever been here before?\" I've never had any middle eastern food, let alone shawarmas or falafels. I replied back with a \"no\" and he said, \"grab a seat\". He tells me to sit tight and that he would be back. Basket in hand with some fried dough looking thing and said, \"This is gonna change your life bro, enjoy\". I didn't have any money and he said, \"Don't worry about it.\" I had a bite of my first falafel. It was life changing lol It opened me up to a whole new world of food, but also reminded me of how nice and kind people could be. This happened about 15 years ago, but I'll never forget that.

I walk in every few months with the intention of ordering something, but I more often than not I back out before committing. When I do commit, I'm usually disappointed. They make great falafel balls. Sometimes. Actually, that one time two years ago when they made them fresh and I saw them pluck them directly from the fryer. But sometimes they seem to have old falafel balls hanging around that they reheat. They also heat up the chicken and lamb that was I assume was shaved off the (cold, unheated, despondent) shawarma log over by the front window sometime earlier this morning. \n\nThe salads in that refrigerated deli thing look nice, but the menu is complicated and hard to understand. Can I order a small salad? How much is that? How might I get a combination plate that has a bit of all the best stuff? No? You just want to give me a blob of hummus and some meat dropped on top of it with a pita on the side? Okay, then. The menu (apparently painted many years ago by an apprentice sign painter) frustrates me. I've spent a lot of time trying to understand how to order here. \n\nLook. I hate to break it to you, but this family run establishment lacks passion. In a big way. What if you put some music on (your choice) and cleaned up the tables and swept and mopped the corners and painted the walls and had a bit of fun while you make food? I wouldn't mind.

Nope.  It was just what it appeared to be: good enough food served in ample portions amidst drab metal furnishings, the smell of cooking oil, and lackluster looking display cases.  Sometimes a book really can be judged by its cover.  \n\nAt Sunrise, you order at the counter based on a posted menu then take a seat to be served.  My falafel plate ($7.99) was a full platter divided in thirds with one third devoted to a very good tomato/cuke salad, one third devoted to precooked, barely warm, not very wonderful tasting falafel-topped lettuce, and one third filled with a slightly runny hummus that could've used some extra something.  With the exception of the tomato/cuke salad, the flavors were just okay, nothing to crave.  The platter was served with an ample side of pita.  \n\nSo, the food isn't in the same league as my new fave (Zaki Kabob House in Albany) but I can't argue about the portions.

They've got a crunchy crust, and the inside is soft and moist. The herbs and spices make them really flavorful, and they use enough sesame seeds to give it that toasty nuttiness. The taste is a good mix of saltiness, zest, and spice. For less than $6 for a dozen, I think they're priced pretty well too.", "author": "Nei N."}

The service is not in question, but the quality and quantity of the food is. \nOn the previous occasions we've visited, I was very satisfied with the serving size of the large schwarma  plate. I would normally be able to eat my fill and still have enough left over for lunch the next day. Also the portions of meat were heartier and there was a good balance between all items on the plate. It was truly worth $12.00. \nTonight, though, I was very disappointed. The food was ok, but the plate was small and the ratio of hummus to the schwarma was very lopsided. It was as if my schwarma was a little island in a lake of hummus. Then they gave us each one pita, which we eventually had to ask for more. \nWhen we first received the plates of food we honestly thought that they didn't hear we wanted the large plate and gave us the small plate as a mistake. When my husband went to pay, he saw that they charged us for the large. We didn't argue, the men were so sweet. \nSo as I write this, I do so with bittersweet feelings. I recommend that if you do go, stick to the kabobs or the pita wraps.", "author": "Jamye K."}

I was picking out a few honey tangerines next door at the 22nd and Irving Produce Market when I glanced over and noticed the two vertical spits (one with lamb, one with chicken) in full view inside the right window of the Sunrise Deli & Caf\u00e9.  \n\nWhen it comes to eating Middle Eastern food I'm a complete novice.  I can honestly think back and recall only two other occasions when I've had a falafel or a wrap.  After I made my purchase next door I stopped at the window to take a look.  The hot juices flowing down from the two meats invited me inside.  I browsed at the paper menu stuck on the opposite window.  The Chicken Shawarma sounded good or in my case it had ingredients that I am familiar with.\n\nThe prices they have posted inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/e02eHaL0toY64Tzodnx8_Q?select=5yFHIx67oiXMqXVgdo2QsQ) has gone up slightly from the prices on the paper menu.  In these tough times it's to be expected.  I ordered the sandwich and walked to the back of the restaurant to take a soda out of the refrigerated display.  They have a very good assortment of beverages to choose from.  The nice man asked me to take a seat and pay after I eat.\n\nHe brought me my Chicken Shawarma (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/e02eHaL0toY64Tzodnx8_Q?select=FHfY4kH96eBGRlWnjkseZA) just minutes later.  I gotta admit; I didn't expect it to be stuffed so full.  I picked up the pita sandwich and took a big bite.  I got a mouthful of juicy diced tomatoes, chicken breast and the delicious tahini sauce.  There was lots of chicken in there too.  According to the menu the chicken breast is marinated in lemon and garlic.  I tasted the lemon but not even the faintest bit of garlic.  There are thin strings of onion and chopped lettuce in the sandwich too, but I think the tasty sauce and the moist chicken made the difference.  I enjoyed the sandwich enough to pick up all of my crumbs and eat them too.\n\nA lot of the items they have on display I'm not at all familiar with and I would have asked had they not been so busy.  Next time I'm nearby and feeling hungry I won't hesitate to make a return visit.  Very nice people too.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

So naturally, when I got back, I made a point of trying to find a good falafel joint here.  And one day, while walking down Irving, I caught sight of the sign outside Sunrise Deli that read, \"the best falafel in town\".  The best, eh?  With that, I had to go in and check them out.  \n\nI ordered the Avocado Falafel sandwich and got a pretty decent amount of food - falafel, avocado, lettuce, tomato, hummus, and tahini sauce served in pita bread.  The falafel was already pre-cooked when I had ordered, so I'm not sure how long it was sitting there before I got inside.  The sandwich was pretty warm to the touch in the end, so I'm thinking that it may not have been that long.  Either way, the falafel was good, but not mind blowing.  Though, it did have a nice crispy/crunchy texture.\n\nThe sandwich as a whole was kind of the same....not bad, but not amazing.  The avocado portion was essentially a chunk dropped on the top of each half, which was disappointing since it was gone after about two bites.  Too bad they couldn't have diced it or something to spread it out a bit.  Also, I didn't care much for the tahini sauce, though it might just be my taste buds.  Regardless, I thought that the sauce was a little overwhelming and overshadowed the rest of the flavors.\n\nOverall, the place is not bad, but the food but didn't win me over.  I must have missed the boat somewhere though because they have a lot of fours and fives on here.  Their sign proclaims to have the \"best falafel in town\", but I haven't tried enough of the other places in the city to say otherwise.  However, right or wrong, I know I've had better outside of the city/country.", "author": "Mike L."}

Yes, prices have gone up just a bit. Yet it is worth every bite because the food is always fresh and service is friendly and outstanding. \n\nOne thing I recommend to friends when going to Sunrise Deli is to get a lamb or chicken Shawarma before 1 PM. The reason why is because later on in the day, the meat gets thinner. The lunch crowd always gets the best and choice pieces. So its kind of first in line sort of routine. \n\nAlso, Sunrise has some of the best falafal, hummus, etc. This little place has always maintained freshness and quality.

Not enough avocado. Generous portion size. The hummus was kind of thin and watery...not good for dipping pita bread in :P\n\nThe service was kind of eh, but it didn't affect my overall experience. \n\nI'd probably be back to try some other things!

It made me a falafel person, which I wasn't before. I don't know what type of narcotics they use in their seasonings, but it's just unbelievably good. It's fresh, spicy (but not too spicy), and flaky and just UGH, it's perfect. It doesn't taste fried, either! \n\nThe only thing I've ever gotten here (and will probably continue to get forever) is the avocado falafel sandwich. First of all, it's a LOT of food. This doesn't mean you won't finish it, even if you think you can't take another bite. \n\nIngredients: Avocado, lots of falafel, pickled turnips (Lebanese sauerkraut?), lettuce, diced tomatoes, and hummus, all stuffed into a pita pocket.\n\nThis is a messy meal. Make sure you have napkins and/or a bib if you're anything like me. The hummus will be spilling out of the pita and tomatoes will be flying everywhere, but your tongue will be singing from how amazing this sandwich is. The hummus has this delicious lemony tang to it, which complements the turnips and falafel perfectly.\n\nThe guys at the counter can be gruff, but I suppose that's part of their charm. Once you've ordered, they invite you to take a seat, without pressuring you to pay until you're motioning to leave. There's a really home-y, I'm-in-my-long-lost-Middle-Eastern-grandma's-kitchen vibe here, and I like it a lot. I've also visited their location off Kearny Street, which is also great if you're grabbing food to go. \n\nSide note: If you like halvah, you NEED to try theirs. It's crumbly and completely delicious. They usually have a huge block of it in stock, and it's super cheap. And if you haven't tried halvah, I feel sorry for you, but also encourage you to try it here.", "author": "Rachel F."}

It'll look more like a falafel burrito and it's significantly less messy. \n\nThe food truck isn't always in the most convenient places for me to get to, so I usually go to the location on Irving or 2nd. I prefer the Irving location because it looks a lot more like a deli and the lady who runs it is always very nice. It's usually pretty empty when I go there (around 7pm) so I just have my food there. Plus they have free Wifi and I'll take that over fighting for a chair at the Starbucks any day. \n\nI wish their baklava wasn't so pricey, but DAMN. It's definitely in my top 3 places to get baklava.", "author": "Maegan T."}

We ended up parking in front of this place and noticed the sign on the window that says \"follow our truck, best falafel in town etc.\" so I decided to whip out my trusty yelp app and check out their reviews. Reviews were almost 5 stars so we decided to check it out.\n\nWalked in, looked at the menu and immediately noticed the avocado falafel pita sandwich.. I love avocado and was excited to take the first bite but unfortunately that fantasy was short-lived because they said that their avocados were not good enough to be served which is a good sign of customer service even though that was the only thing that looked appealing :(\n\nI was then forced to pick something else and with the help of my bf, picked the falafel plate. I helped my bf pick the lamb schawarma plate which smelled really good...\n\nPros: falafel IS verry good! I love it. Also, in the front there is this case of sweets.. we got the pistachio baklava (which is TO DIE for! love the flaky-ness) and this chocolate almond crunch thingie which was also heaven. \n\nCons: the lamb schawarma plate was not as good as it smelled.. I never tasted shawarma before and had no idea what I was getting myself into but evidently schawarma is a little SWEET and I hate SWEET meat! On top of that, the lamb was so dry I had a really hard time swallowing it... I almost choked at one point. Their hummus taste like any other kind of hummus except they put some purple sour steak fry looking things in it, which killed it for me. \n\nThe thing that disappointed me the most was their tahini sauce.. I was expecting it to be thick and creamy because to me, that's always the best part of Mediterranean food! Sunrise deli's version of tahini sauce is EXTREMELY watery and sour and bitter all at the same time.. the taste echoed through my nostrils like wasabi.\n\nThey also have this chili sauce which is noticeably filled with chili seeds so when I took a spoonful and put it directly into my mouth, I was expecting it to be so hot that my eardrums would burn but it was not even close.\n\nIf I ever do come back it would be ONLY for the falafel, baklava and other sweets..", "author": "Sarah E."}

I walked in and the guy taking orders asks me nicely what I want. I tell him that I have a groupon deal and he immediately starts becoming pissy and annoyed. Excuse me, stop putting your deli on groupon if you don't like it. So I pull up the deal on my phone since I didn't print it and he keeps asking for the barcode. I show him that my phone says to show that page to the business owner and he says that I can't use the deal because I'm not showing him what he needs. I tell him Fine and i just walk out and he decides to be nice to me again as I am walking out.\n\nI would have probably decided to go home, print out my deal, and come back another day if it wasn't for his bad attitude.

Mine is specific to CATERING.\n\nWe were looking for someone to cater a bday party in the park (30-40 ppl).  Wanted something easy, finger friendly, etc, and have always liked the sandwiches here so thought we've give them a try.  My biggest concern was that the falafels either wouldn't be fresh when we picked them up, or that they'd get old/dried out by the time we got set up and guests arrived.  \n\nNow I can't speak for all times of the day or days of the week but we picked everything up at 11am on a Saturday.  When I got there, everything was wrapped up and ready to go and we proceeded to load the car (we got 3 platters).  As we finish, I pay and turn to leave and they say, \"Wait, falafel's almost ready!\".  In other words, they were frying it up fresh on the spot for me!  Not only did the falafel stay fresh and was warm by the time we served everything 30+ minutes later, but EVERYONE at the party was commenting on them and they were the first thing to go.  Definitely the best falafel I can remember having.\n\nMy ONLY \"complaint\" is that when I called the day before to confirm my order and asked if they delivered, they said they did, but it cost $20!!  (in comparison, when I'd called another place, they were only going to charge $3).  Trying to save money I opted for picking it up.  Day of I decided, \"Ehh, my sanity's worth $20 not to have to drive over there, etc\" and called to add the delivery (this was at least 1-2 hours before) and by then delivery wasn't available so I had to pick it up anyway.  Again, not a big deal at all but I did feel the charge, had I paid it, was quite steep (and as a side note, I could've sworn there was some sort of private food delivery company for things just like this...couldn't find anything online that did so.  Would've probably been half as much if I'd just called a cab to come get the food and bring it to me...).\n\nOverall, party was great, food was phenomenal (and as one more aside, they gave me as many forks, spoons, and napkins as we needed, which was very nice) and yes, the owner was extremely nice and responsive.\n\nGo Sunrise!", "author": "David M."}

Not being a falafel lover myself, I opted for the shawarma, so this review is purely for that. NOT a judgment on their falafel in any way, because from what I heard, it's pretty dang tasty. \n\nAfter spending the summer in Europe, I'm kind of a Shawarma freak/nazi. I've been trying place after place in the city, looking for something that will measure up. I want that giant vertical spit of tender, juicy meat, sizzling as it turns, glistening with fat, and I want it fresh cut off the roaster. I want a fluffy pita pocket overflowing with tabouleh and onions and hummus. \n\nThis shawarma was not that. It wasn't terrible, but there was a lot to be missed. I get it, I have high expectations, but this place didn't really come close to meeting them. It was good in its own, unique way. The meat was well marinated and the pickled cabbage added a little something, but that's about it. The pita pocket was your typical, store bought dense, dry pita and the meat, although decently flavorful was a little dry. Not a bad pita pocket, by any means, just not at all what I wanted. \n\nSo, yup, I'm a shawarma snob, but this place was just ehh. It was probably the best shawarma I've had here back in the states, but I'm still on the hunt.

On her most recent trip to visit me, she decided to do some comparison-tasting and decided that this was her favorite falafel.  I'm inclined to agree with her assessment.\n\nYou might be wondering, how does someone who's allergic to garlic and raw chickpeas ever wind up tasting a falafel??!!!  It makes no bloody sense!!!\n\nYou're right, it doesn't.  I will admit, though, to stealing the ocassional naughty, absolutely irresistable bite, savoring the taste of the illicit goodness, knowing all too well that my intestines will chastize me later for this infraction...\n\nDare I say, it's worth it?\n\nThe falafel comes in a pita, which is how it should arrive...while other restaurants might attempt to deliver their falafel in lavash, which might be more stable as far as holding the wrap together but offers an imbalance of too much bread, Sunrise Deli offers the falafel the way it was intended:  the focus is the falafel, not the bread around it.  \n\nNow, if you're looking for a glamourous environment, you won't find it here.  This is a place you go to pick up your meal to go, or to devour hastily at one of their very basic tables and chairs while staring at their shelves of groceries and fridges of cold beverages.

The store front looks small, although the inside is spacious and deep (some tables available to dine inside). The owner has a stern look, but as soon as you show your intent to make a purchase you do get very friendly service. \n\nI placed an order for an avocado falafel for me, a super falafel for my brother, a bag of pita bread (half dozen pita), half pint of hummus, and a type of Baklava filled with sweet cheese. The total was around $25.\n\nThe menu includes many pita \"sandwiches\" (falafel, shawarma, kabob), dips/salads (hummus, babaghanoush, tahini, tabouli, chopped cucumber and tomato, olives, etc.), 4 plates (falafel, vegetarian, shawarma, & kabob), and assorted pastries. Drinks are available in the refrigerators in the back of the store.\n\nWhile completing my order, the owner was correcting a worker to put \"less ingredients\", no more than a third of the avocado half into the falafel. When I finally was eating that falafel in my car, I found that only one half of the falafel had that little portion of avocado, the other half had none. **sad face**\nThe super falafel is wrapped in lavash bread and stuffed with french fries (yes, weird), so it's sturdy. On the other hand the falafel in pita bread should be consumed when you get it, otherwise it'll be a soggy mess soon after. I found a piece of stem in one of the falafel fried balls, but not a big deal. - Deducted a star for all that.\n\nThe hummus is somewhat watered down, so it could be described as creamy but still tasty. I normally expect hummus to have a thicker consistency. - Deducted one star.\nThe baklava was nice, similar to a flaky cheese danish.\n\nOverall, in my opinion, it's no longer a value destination (prices are moderate) and this particular visit was just okay. I don't live around this area so I cannot give them points for convenient location.", "author": "Luis C."}

The chicken shwarma was pretty dry and flavorless so I don't really get that. The chicken KABOB meat, however, is great. The lamb shwarma is pretty good too--- I often get the shwarma wrap or plate. the lamb is GOOD, but not great. It can be a bit tough, gamey, and gristly.

I wish I had read the other review before.Anyway,I was hungry so waited for it.I asked the guy if they put french fries in their shwarmas - I saw a plate with fries already made on the counter - and he said \"no,but do you want any?\". I said \"yes\". When he charged me, he added an extra $1 to my bill.When asked why, he said it was for the fries . WTF ? You take out the more expensive lamb meat of my meal and replace it with a cheaper filling but you still charge me more ? Anyways...the shwarma is small and skinny, the meat was disgusting ( cold,not seasoned,very chewy) and the hot sauce he provided on the side was 95% oil and the rest some pepper seeds.Gross ! I had to stop by a near by Vietnamese restaurant to borrow some real hot sauce to eat that crap.I felt like crap for the next few hours after eating this meal.I know why now....\n\nOhhh....as the place overall goes, I needed to use the bathroom while waiting for my meal to be prepared.I was told to go to the back,thus crossing the entire kitchen area.No sink in the bathroom,so you figure out how those guys who handle your food manage to keep everything clean in there.I mean, they need to go to the bathroom at least a few times/day while working there and with no sink in there, they`ll go back handling your food and who knows what else on their hands right in there.GROSS !\n\nIt didn`t look like a place that I`ll ever want to step foot in again.

If you love Falafel like I do, then while eating the first bite of your first one, you will immediately know , this falafel is by far he best there is, anywhere. Why? Because of the taste of course! Not to mention the \"crunch factor\" (really important in all fried foods but especially in this one.) it's authentic taste has that essential pungency and perfect mixture of ingredients that will make you feel you stumbled on this authentic falafel stand somewhere in the Middle East. (These are the true roots of Sunrise Deli, the family is Palestinian, and they make the original falafel from the place of its origin.) Point being, this is the way Falafel should be done. The rest of their foods are great also, although ma would give them a run for their money on hummus, Baba Ghanouj (eggplant dip) and Tzatziki (yogurt garlic sauce). Try their gyros (shawarma in Arabic) and don't forget to buy their homemade sesame ring bread. Although you can eat in, I prefer to take everything home and feast. Although falafel is better eaten immediately on the spot as it gets soggy from the steam in the bag, wth, just eat it on the way home. The only minus I can think of is that this stuff ain't cheap, and for us raised on it, it makes us want to make it ourselves.(I got them on hummus, I think.)

Maybe it's only fantastic  Mon - Fri, and on Saturdays at noon?  Maybe it was the rain? In any case, the food was good enough to not feel regretful about eating there. I just had much higher expectations based on what Yelp had said. 3 stars from me with a willingness to upgrade if they prove me wrong next time I go. \n\nI ordered the regular falafel sandwich. The BF ordered a chicken shawarma and a falafel sandwich (the shawarma portions are a bit small). We were the only diners there. My falafel came out first and it wasn't bad. Pretty standard, actually. Because I sat facing the door, I was able to see them make my BF's chicken shawarma. Not wanting to ruin his dining experience, I didn't mention that they didn't slice the chicken from the turning meat thing (the pit?). Instead, they got the chicken from a different container and heated it up in the oven. Huge disappointment. This would never happen at Truly Mediterranean (our go-to Shawarma spot in the Mission). \n\nBest falafel in town? I honestly cannot claim that here. Maybe on a different day, at a different time, they actually bring their \"A\" Game. But for now, the only \"A\" they get is \"A-Ok.\"", "author": "Rona J."}

I was waiting for the 71 and was hungry and decided since it wasn't coming, I'd head over to this place and finally get me something good to eat.\n\nI stopped in and settled on getting a chicken shawarma sandwich.  I was trying to figure out what a falafel was while I was waiting for my sandwich and asked the guy what exactly a falafel was.  Next thing I know, he handed me a falafel with some hummus on it.  I took a bite and my little taste buds went crazy!!  It was so freakin' good as was the hummus.  Seriously, how can fried food NOT be good, right?  I love any culture that will fry anything and slather some saucy/dip goodness on top.  I said it was good and I said I'd totally be back again.  I was eating while walking down Irving saying out loud, \"Oh my gawd, that's good.  It's so good!\"  I realized maybe people were thinking i was crazy, but I don't care.  If they had a falafel from there, they'd be talking crazy too.\n\nI got home finally able to eat my sandwich and oh my goodness, it was yummy!!!!!  Salad, hummus, chicken, onions, tomato ... the list goes on.  It was big too!!  I could have eaten half of it, but if I left it, it would have become soggy because of the hummus and pita.\n\nI'm so coming back again.  It's greatly priced and easy hand food if you need to eat on the go.

The falafel itself was really good, nicely fried and crunchy with an excellent center.  Where the meal fell short was in it's accompaniments.  The hummus was disgustingly runny (who wants runny hummus?...yuck) and the accompaniments (lettuce, pita, etc) were just okay.\n\nAll in all, despite that, I thought it was pretty good, especially considering that it's in the sunset.  In my humble opinion, it's not the best falafel sandwich I've ever had and doesn't hold a candle to my favorite in the east bay, but is still a good, solid, and convenient local alternative.  Also, I'm not sure if it's a fair comparison since Sunrise Deli is more of a deli cafe than a real restaurant.\n\nIf you're in the area and have a craving for good falafel, it's definitely my first choice (in the sunset).", "author": "Roy N."}

I thought all the figures were in place for an absolute smear campaign of superiority, but even after the fact that its handmade, prepared fresh in front of your eyes, gorgeous, piping hot and hulking in construction, it all came down to a matter of flavor which i think damaged the periscope. With a well rounded falafel, the cascading oils are normally balanced with that taste silencer, but the second directive was incapable of being reached. (Sabra Grill in China town right off bush., best falafel anywhere) The hummus was wholly unremarkable too.  \n\nI still think this place has the colossal cojones to rectify this initial opinion and profess a gloriously unabated victory over the squawking howls of the citywide greek skirmish. Maybe its the fact i've given it the lowest score yet and i give these other raters the benefit of the doubt, maybe its logistics ( how does a med. place prosper on 22nd and irving and not be considered an intrepid legend?)

Why this is important?? Authenticity :-)\n\nThis place definitely has an authentic feel, whether its their tahini sauce, their shawarmas, and of course their falafels.  Let me tell you, if you like falafel and haven't tried this great little hole in the wall, then you are missing out!  The food here is great and its definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of middle eastern food.\n\nAs mentioned before, this place is very cheap, which is always a welcomed bonus when the food is so tasty.  I have been to several middle eastern food establishments where i paid as much as 10.99 for a lamb shawarma and 8.99 for a falafel sandwich.  This place has all of their shawarma sandwiches at 6.99 and their falafel sandwiches for under 6 bucks, which is cheap by relative standards. \n\nAnother great thing about this place is the people behind the counter.  If you choose to eat there, then they bring the food to you, which is kind  of nice for a smaller hole in the wall \"fast food\" type of place.  Although i think several of the employees did not speak english, they were nonetheless friendly and attentive to our requests.    The owner is a nice guy who you can tell genuinely likes the food that he makes...that may sound silly, but i would argue that you can't say that about alot of places now.  \n\nI am slightly critical of this place, which is why i didnt give it 5 stars.  I will say that with the exception of the falafel, its not the \"best\" middle eastern food i have tasted.  I have tried a place in palo alto that tastes slightly better in terms of their shawarma and a few other things.  \n\nBut the star of this place is no doubt the falafel, so make sure when you stop by, you get a sandwich! Or if you have never tried falafel and are curious if you will like it, this place is for you because you can try individual falafels for only 25 cents :-)", "author": "Mark R."}

Due to San Francisco's lack of middle eastern food, I have not had much falafel here, but I've had it in Manhattan and Paris, not to mention Greece and Israel, so I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe falafel was the best thing I had on my Vegetarian Plate, fried to order, crunchy on the outside yet not greasy, and good flavor.  But the other items on the plate make this only a three-star rating.  The hummus was thin and bland, the tahini was sour tasting, and the mystery item that was dyed pink made the meal mediocre.  The tabouli and baba ganoush (as well as my baklava) tasted like they'd been sitting in the display case for too long, and while the dolmas were good, I'm pretty sure they came out of the giant cans that are for sale in the back.  The pita bread almost certainly came out of a package, and the round bread they're known for was sold out at lunch time so I didn't get to try that.\n\nI'm glad I didn't want to try the Doner Kebab (lamb or chicken), because the contraptions that spin the meat around the heating element weren't spinning.  And the heat wasn't on.  Which makes me skeptical about the quality of that meat.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for the veggie plate because I crave this type of food and don't know of anywhere else in the neighborhood to go, but there are other places I'm going to explore first.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

The items were stuffed with veggies and had barely any meat. The tzatziki was bitter and there was nothing special about the pitas.

One of the bonuses here, is they are very cheap, especially in San Francisco.  Looking over the menu (prices for most meals range between $5 for wraps/sandwiches to about $12 for plates) on the board I decided to go with the Falafel Sandwich.\n\nThe owner told me to make myself comfortable so I grabbed myself a coke and sat down.  Looks like he was making the Falafel fresh, which is a bonus.  Probably took about 10 minutes, but instead of the normal 1/2 a Pita, I got two BIG Falafel Pita.  Everything tasted fresh and was very good.  I ended up paying around $8 including tip for the Falafel Pita and coke.\n\nOverall very solid food experience.

Anyway, so I'm standing in front of the counter, thinking aloud and asking no one in particular what the hell are falafel's, when the owner takes a falafel and gives it to me. \n\nI stood there for a good ten seconds, waiting for him to cut me a small piece, but he doesn't, he just gives me the whole damn thing! Sure, falafel's don't cost a lot, but it was still very generous of him. I'm Asian, Asians love free samples.

Oh, thank heavens, it was delicious! My boyfriend, however, ordered the Chicken Shawarma and I'll be honest, I didn't like it one bit, because it tasted like curry and I'm not a fan of curry. \n\nMy only complaint about the shawarma is that I had a difficult time getting a good bite of the lettuce, hummus, and tomatoes with the lamb, because everything wasn't mixed very well inside the wrap. I had to take one bite from the left, one bite from the right, and combine everything together in my mouth. Other than that, it was good.

Looking on Yelp, this place struck my eye. I love shwarma! It's one of the things I miss the most from my years in Israel! Excitedly I headed over to this place, savoring the possibility of finally finding a decent shwarma in the Bay Area.\n\nParking is, unsurprisingly, scarce. I shunted my car into a TRUCKS ONLY spot by the nearby Walgreen's, deposited my 50 cents into the timer and ran, with an attempt at nonchalance, to the restaurant. \n\nOn walking in, I breathed a sigh of relief since it was pretty much empty. Just one lady in line in front of me, how long could that take, right? Maybe I wouldn't get a ticket after all. As luck would have it, though, the lady appeared to be the worst of all customers to have in front of you--the finicky party planner. \"What kind of salad is that?\" \"Can I have a small container of that? Oh wait, no, I've changed my mind. A big container. No, never mind, I don't want it at all.\" As she was about to pay, she suddenly noticed the baklava behind her and went into a prolonged discussion with the cashier about which, if any, baklava she should get.\n\nThankfully after about 10 minutes of this she noticed me and graciously let me pay for my chicken shwarma. Then the guy who had previously been (very dextrously!) deep frying falafel balls proceeded to put it together.\n\nFirst of all, I was extremely disappointed that he did not cut the meat straight from the spit. There was a spit, and it was turning, so at least I figured the pieces of chicken I got had come from there at some point. Still, that's part of the fun of shwarma. Not this time.\n\nThe ingredients were not very well mixed in the shwarma, and the layers were a bit too distinct for what's pretty much a sandwich which you're forced to eat sequentially.\n\nThe chicken... didn't taste like chicken. As I was eating, I kept glancing at my shwarma to make sure that I did indeed get chicken. It was kind of bland and almost bready. \n\nThe hummus saved it though. Most of the hummus I've had in the US is kind of a pale approximation of the real thing. This was a bit too liquidy, but tasted just right.

The odd times I dined in,  I'd find myself  at some random table with a shaky leg (the table, not me)   sitting across from shelves of groceries...\"hey,  this stuff looks like Palmolive but it's made in Amman (Jordan)!\"  And the owners Mother I think, is there alot, keeping an eye on everyone and especially women who might have carnal desires about her son (hey, maybe being around all those rounds of meat do something to me, I dunno!\")   So...imagine my surprise when I saw they had remodeled a bit! It's not Gary Danko's but it's much tidier/better tables and chairs (they match now, well mostly) even added  a few pics!  Overall, it's still a deli/grocery shop/hole in the wall, but thats part of it's charm! And it has never disappointed food wise, so there you go!\n\nThe reason i gave the 4.5 stars is because of the parking situation...I mean, it's not the restaurants fault I suppose, but the hit or miss (miss mostly) does influence how much you'd want to get over there and dine in or out!

A colleague suggested Sunrise Deli and it turned out to be pretty good!\nBased on their suggestions I ordered 5 veggie platters, 6 pounds of chicken, and 6 pounds of kufta kabob. With delivery this was $630. I was worried there wouldn't be enough food, but I was WRONG!\nPunctual delivery! The chicken was very well done (my fave) - it was moist and very flavorful. The kufta kabob was more popular than I even anticipated. The falafel was getting somewhat cold by the time I got to it, but it was tasty. The pita tasted like your usual store-bought style...simple and functional.\nMy only complaint is about the proportions. My group is rather carnivorous and the meat disappeared whereas we had tons of veggie/falafel leftovers. If your group is like mine, order 20% more meat and 20% fewer veggies than what Sunrise Deli suggests. Despite this, nobody left hungry so we will definitely use them again!", "author": "C S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-27", "description": "So I went to the Gay Bay last weekend to my best friend whom I haven't seen in nearly five years. She lives in Sunset amongst a bunch of Chinese folks and shops along Irving. When I got into Sunset, after a flight on Virgin America that left me starving and wanting to eat my left foot, I walked up and down the street trying to decide if I wanted Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, or what. I first stopped at a grocery store and got some wasabi roasted peas. Then I proceeded to buy frozen yogurt with fruit toppings at some fro-yo shop. But since I like to finish any meal--haphazard or not--with something salty or savory, I popped into Sunrise because I love falafel like I love being a lonely sonofabitch--which is a lot!\n\nIt was down to two choices: the Super Falafel or the Avocado Falafel. The avocado falafel promised avocado, hummus, lettuce, tomato, and tahini in a pita. Sounded pretty standard except for the avocado, which in principle, guaranteed a yummy sandwich. However, my interested was more peaked by the Super Falafel - with hummus, eggplant, potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini served in a \"Lavish Bread.\" Since I didn't know what the fuck a lavish bread was and the promise of potatoes and savory eggplant in my falafel was too tempting to resist, I order a Super Falafel. \n\nAs I caught a glimpse of the obviously new Mexican employee make my sandwich, I noticed that potato element was french fries. I wouldn't call this a native ingredient in the Near East either, but was loving where this was all going. I looked away and moments later, my sandwich was before me with a small side of pickled turnips and olives. What was first noticeable was that it wasn't so much a sandwich than a Middle Eastern burrito. Apparently a lavish bread is a very flat bread that you can roll up ingredients into for an easy-to-go snack or meal. No wonder why they hired a Mexican for this job!\n\nThe premise of this sandwich is excellent, however, the execution doesn't live up to its potential. First, the falafel balls were room were kind of cold and mushy--though it could have been the fault of the tahini. But because the falafel balls were obviously not taken fresh from the fryer, it lacked a crunchy texture that I really enjoy. Next were the french fries--also cold and with no texture. And finally, it took a few bites to finally get  a taste of the eggplant, which didn't contribute enough flavor to the tasting experience. The eggplant could have had some spice, perhaps enhanced in the same delicious way the guys at the falafel cart on 40th and Broadway do it. That would have given the Super Falafel some more dimension. Also, if the falafel balls were hot and the french fries inside more crispy, the sandwich could really live up to its name. But at this point, it is more like \"Decent Falafel.\"\n\nThe joint claims to have the best falafel in town. I hope that isn't true.", "author": "Daniel L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-01", "description": "I've been craving falafel for months now and I'm happy to say that the falafel craving has finally been satisfied.  And to think it was satisfied in the middle of Irving's Asian-town.  You see tapicoa places, Thai restaurants, Chinese BBQ places, and then this?  A deli/convenience store selling Middle Eastern foods and a small selection of Middle Eastern goods?  Needless to say, it was a surprise, but after eating here, its easy to see why its stil around in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter doing some business in the area, I decided to stop here with my brother to try their falafel sandwich ($4.99).  We decided to share the regular sandwich, which is still pretty big - basically, its two sandwiches as the pita is sliced in half and then stuffed on both ends with lettuce, tomato, hummus, and falafel with a few pickled beets and green olives on the side.  (I shudder to think what would have happened to our poor, full stomachs had we ordered the super falafel...)  We found that the falafel was pretty good - crispy on the outside, not too oily, and moist on the inside.  It wasn't as warm as I would have preferred as the falafel didn't come straight out of the fryer.  The hummus was a little lacking in taste - it had the right texture and consistency, but the taste was a little off.  The sandwich itself could have used some heat - I'm used to getting hot sauce in my falafel sandwich.  It would have also helped had the pita bread been heated a little bit.  Normally, I don't think thats a problem, but this pita was a little stiff.\n\nWe took some things to-go as well, such as their baklava (both pistachio and walnut, $1.50 each) and more falafel balls (6 for $1.85, a dozen for $3.50).  The walnut baklava was pretty good, but the pistachio baklava was a disappointment, as the whole pistachios in the filling were soft and slightly stale.  The falafel balls are an excellent deal and great to construct your own sandwiches in the comfort of your home.  The countermen were nice and took care of things quickly.  Overall, this is a great place to pick up some Middle Eastern delicacies.  I'm definitely heading back to pick up more falafel and try more items, such as the chicken shwarma.", "author": "Angela H."}

For starters, it's enormous! $5 for enough food for two lunches (ask for an extra falafel or two). I got it without the babaganouj because I don't like eggplant. They gave me an extra helping of hummus. The tabbouleh is wonderful (it has chunks of cucumber in it, which I love!  I don't know if that's authentic but I don't care - it's great!) and they also give you a generous portion of cucumber/tomato salad. \n\nThey don't have the best help there (like I said, the boy behind the counter gives me attitude frequently), but the owner is nice and the food is exceptional.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-09", "description": "It's all about the falafel here, plain and simple.  It seems the secret is not to subject the delicate mixture to factoryesque pre-rolling routine, but instead to let it be free and easy, only rolled into balls just before frying.  This way, the outer crust of the balls never congeal or harden, leaving a loose texture which allows the oil to distribute more evenly throughout.  The result is like trying falafel again for the first time, the right way!\nKeeping with the simple approach, it follows that the regular falafel is the best.  Avocado would only distract from the falafel flavor I feel, so I won't try that despite my love for the creamy fruit in all kinds of uses.  I did try the deluxe, which is definitely a step down.  It comes in a burrito shape wrapped in lavash, which I found only compresses the falafel and forces dryness on it.

Don't get me wrong, i love the lemon but when it's used as accompaniment to the ingredients as opposed to being the main ingredient, i do prefer it to be more subtle.   There was too much lemon in the hummus and the dolmas.
