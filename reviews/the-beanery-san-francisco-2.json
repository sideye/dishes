This was my first time visiting the Beanery and I really enjoyed the scenery. This location was located in a cozy little spot around a intersection. It was a plus to enjoy a cup of joe while enjoying the San Francisco lifestyle. One odd thing I didn't like was that they have a $4 limit per transaction and in this given day. I don't really carry cash anymore. I had to add another item to meet the limit. Overall, I would definitely stop by again and bring cash.", "author": "AJ P."}

I usually order a latte and a pastry, and have never really been disappointed (I love the coffee, the pastries are just ok). However, I think only one employee here is somewhat friendly. The woman with dark hair who is often making the coffee on Saturday mornings is awful and has never even looked at me. Even after coming here every weekend for a year and spending on average $15 a week (on coffee and a pastry) the negativity from the staff is making me want to find a new place - or walk a little farther to the other Beanery location. I worked in customer service for a long time so I know it can be stressful and hard work. But even on my worst days I still always greeted customers with a friendly smile. This one woman in particular should find a new career if she can't force a smile occasionally.", "author": "Kate A."}

And the size of this location is very cozy, compared to the 9th Ave. location.

I consider myself a coffee tasting hobbyist and wasn't at all satisfied with the Roasters Blend drip coffee.  \n\nYou'll experience a roasted and burnt flavor profile that lines up better with a french roast.  But here, it went one step beyond a french roast with an overpowering taste that's best described as ashy and acrid, slightly skunky.  It had a very heavy body and coating.  The ending left a dirty aftertaste.  And there was a notable amount sludge that I would only expect from French Press style brewing.\n\nSome people prefer this type of taste.  I am not one of them.  The closest I can compare it to is to the packaged and pre-ground French Roast Classic coffee from Peerless Coffee.\n\nI feel terrible writing this review because I absolutely want to support local roasters.

Forewarning, this area is notorious for difficulty in finding parking. We walked by because we desperately needed caffeine and wanted some place to hang out while we waited for our table at San Tung. A fairly small coffee shop with dim lighting inside, there's a beautiful coffee roasting machine proudly displayed called the San Franciscan. With only about 5 tables inside (with very cool tabletops that have beans glued underneath a pane of glass), not the best place for a group of people to hang out over a warm drink.

It was very frothy at the top and had enough sweetness and cocoa flavor where I didn't need to add any type of sweetener. My friend ordered a double cappuccino and his cup's froth looked like fresh snow. It was very amusing. The caffeine didn't seem very strong, but we both still enjoyed our cup.\n\nService was decent.

I arrived at a clearing in the fog set, as if by magic, at the corner of 7th and Irving where my usual haunt was winding down for the morning. The rush of people headed to work had thinned, leaving a single seat by the window ready for my intended task. I was writing a letter, you see. \n\n\"Rachel, I will have a small chai please\" (I was feeling exotic). Rachel was busy leading the newest employees in a whirl of activity and steamed milk. She always manages to be both busy and accommodating--a nice quality in a coffee shop if you ask me. Bustling but comfortable.

We have Starbucks, Peets, Coffee People, Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Philz, Equator, and more every month.\n\nNot too many places stay small and local, though, roasting in small batches and concerned with keeping quality high and prices low. Must be tempting to expand, make more money and get everyone talking about how great you are, even though you are no longer as good as your reputation would warrant.\n\nThat's why I love, love, love the Beanery, and this location best of all.\n\nIf you thought dark roast had to be bitter, try the French Roast here. It's not burned or astringent at all, just really, really rich and smooth and full of about a million subtle flavors. You can enjoy a good cup of hot deliciousness here or take home a pound and drink it all morning, like I do. Thank me now or thank me later. You're welcome.\n\nAnd you know how some places fake that friendly environment? Asking your name only to get your order out faster, and engaging in idiotic small talk like they really, really like you. But when you come back and get a refill, they start all over - same idiotic small talk, same conversation. You weren't special.\n\nHere, it's different. I'll go every week for a while, and then go out of town for months. When I return, Heather remembers not only my name, but my preferred, picky blend, and what grind I get. I'm not talkative, but she's so pleasant and calm that she makes me feel comfortable. Nothing fake about her, the coffee, any of it.\n\nTo me, this location has the best vibe (less tourists, more UCSF interns studying, quiet yet not too full or too empty). This is what a coffee shop should be, and is.\n\nNothing fake about it.", "author": "Charlie B."}

To me, though, there's a lot you can tell about a coffee shop by their americanos.  Whether ordering a single or double, I always request extra room.   And at most other coffee shops, they almost always add way too much water, and when I grimace, they just thoughtlessly pour some off, like it's the same thing.  Let me tell you, it's so NOT the same thing.  At the Beanery, they underestimate the amount of the water, and then consistently check with me to see if the volume is to my liking.

I mean, I don't own it, nor would I want to (because then I'd have to do all the work) but they KNOW coffee, man. They KNOW it. \n\nThe basics: drip coffee- always fresh, always hot, always gooooood. None of that drippy brown water shit. It's REAL coffee- not chewy, mind you, just solid and does you right. I believe they have mostly Central American and Indonesian beans- may serve African from time to time, but regardless, the roast is just right - no burned over-achieving crap like Starbucks (who DID bring coffee to the masses, but their roasting is awful). Beanery roast is even and rich- and no, I don't know if those words generally work for coffee, but they do for me.\n\nLattes- I stay away from milk because, well, it gives me scary tummy aches, but that's the thing- they make a soy latte here that is not overwhelmed by the espresso- they know the right combo of soy milk to espresso. And their other drinks are made well, too- I was a \"barista\" at some Southeastern coffee store mall chain, but we were so bored we took the time to make a good cappuccino, and the Beanery folks are REAL baristas, but don't overdo it. They don't need to prove their coffee-ness- they just do it (unlike some Seattle shops that seem to think that taking longer means it will be better- not so).\n\nYou can also buy beans or ground coffee by the half pound and pound, and the prices are really great- around $8 for a pound of a medium roasted something. Bring your bag back and get a dime off the next pound- not huge, but a nice touch that does keep me coming back (among other reasons).\n\nThe baristas are not overly chatty but friendly enough. Forrest, as someone else mentioned, makes a nice little heart design in the top of lattes and cappuccinos, and someone else makes a little paw print (avec milk, not paws). I prefer the paws, but Forrest has mad skeelz, regardless.\n\nThis place is my favorite coffee place in the city, hands down.

The milk foam usually looks like bubble bath on top of your drink.  I've heard of the term \"wash your mouth out with soap\", but I never expected to think about it every time I get my morning beverage.  Foam is my favorite part.  Get that right and I'm sold!\n\nThe little roaster that could gets it right.  There is a woman at the espresso bar that makes a mean milk foam.  Whatever the secret is, she knows it and makes the bubbles fine and creamy looking--just how you would find it in Europe.
