Overall, we thought it was OKAY. \n\n**The good.\nThey offered a guest list for no cover and they didn't have a strict dress code. Music was pretty lit and people were chill. Place was pretty small but it was nice inside and AC wasn't too bad.\n\n**The bad.\nThe prices for the drinks were WILD. $16 for an AMF for a half cup size?? Bruh. In SD it's like $10-$12 for a full cup and it's waaay stronger. Henny shots were also $14/e like WUT??? I don't know if this is pretty standard but we're used to paying $7-$9 for shots. \n\nSo if you're new to SF night life and are coming here, pregame. I would've honestly gone with 2 stars if we paid for cover too.", "author": "Adrienne N."}

Disorganized, rude, and a ripoff. The only reason there is one star is because the female security guard was nice to us. \n\nService: Came here for a birthday party where someone set a table is for us. My friend put a card down and everything. We get there and everything goes up in flames. The people working there don't know what line we're supposed to be in, they're constantly yelling at each other because they're so disorganized and apparently they don't know the name of our promoter but they have our name for our table? Not only that but we find out the price that was told to us wasn't really the price. So not only did we have to pay an entry fee of 30 dollars but they were going to charge 20 people 80 dollars each for a half section of seating in the back corner where you couldn't see anything with a super small table that was probably going to get us one drink each. \n\nAmbiance: DJ was okay. He kept skipping through songs really fast which didn't give us the time to dance or scream the songs we knew but pretty good song selections. Lots of people there with no security watching what's going on on the floor. The layout is whack and it's stupid hard to walk through there while it's packed. \n\nTips: Don't come here to preplan a birthday or anything like it. Also if they say there's going to be a performance expect it to be past 1:00 (they close at 2:00... you do the math). \n\nI'm not usually the type of person to be this upset but when you run into problems with a large group the LEAST you can do is apologize and try to make it right somehow. You ruined someone's birthday. I hope you feel terrible now.", "author": "Courtney O."}

The security staff that I encountered in general were very short with me when I inquired about bottle service. \n\nWe actually already had bottle service for our party but initially we wanted to spend a little more, but after the attitude we received we decided not to waste our money. \n\nAs the night progressed so did the piles of trash/beer bottles/ and empty cocktail glasses on the dance floor. The women's restroom ran out of toilet paper and seat covers by 12:00am and were never restocked. We arrived at 11:00pm and at that time the bathroom floor was already covered in toilet paper and water.\n\nThe DJ was okay... If you were drunk enough you wouldn't notice the sudden tempo changes between songs and that he only played popular songs for a few seconds before switching to something that killed the mood. Sometimes there was even a couple seconds of silence before the next song would play... But hey, maybe he was new? \n\nThe only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the bottle service ladies, and the bartenders. They were professional, helpful, and cheerful. But still, I will not be returning.", "author": "Sasha C."}

There is a huge electronic screen behind the main bar. There are several tables for bottle service throughout and stairs to dance in front of the electronic screen. \n\nNow with a remodel like this, you would think they would expect more from their customers. But nope, people were in there with a mix of club attire and super casual clothing. If you're going to invest in a remodel to make your bar into a club feel, why not hold the standard throughout? Especially when you offer bottle service? It was odd seeing a nice remodeled place with a crowd that showed up in sneakers and tees. Also, I'm not sure if it's because of the remodel or the night we went, but when Holy Cow was a bar, the usual crowd was youngsters and newly turned 21 yr olds.

Went there about a month ago on a Friday. No cover because we went early and got on the guest list. Bought 3 drinks at the back bar and it was over $30. A little later, bought 3 more for my friends and myself, was over $40. Strange. Didn't know going to a different bar within the club would mean different prices. \n\nClub was dead. 11pm rolls around and we decided to leave to meet up with a friend elsewhere, but intended to return after midnight hoping more people would be in Holy Cow.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-21", "description": "I've been a regular at Holy Cow since the 1990s. I just recently discovered they had remodeled the place, and I had not been there for a while and decided to take my girlfriend out dancing there on a Saturday night. My opinion is that overall, they did a good job creating more dance floor area than had existed, and the feng shui works better. The lighting, color, and basic theme works, although it now has the feel of a strip club, even though it's a dance club. \n\nThat's about where my positive review ends. I was pretty disappointed to find that, despite the fact that they have created more seating areas as well, ALL of the seating is VIP and requiring bottle services. No more stools at the bar, either. If you want to sit down anywhere, you better be ready to pony up $300-2500 minimum for a bottle. There is no guarantee you will get a seat, either. They like to reserve these tables and pretend like they're doing you a favor to give you one. I don't go out clubbing as much as I used to, and I'm not familiar with this bottle service trend that has developed. I guess it's a way for dance clubs to bilk patrons out of lots of money, just to have a good time. Have fun paying $14 for a drink at the bar, too--that's clearly overpriced. I understand that rents and costs of doing business in San Francisco have recently tripled due to the tech boom, and maybe night clubs have no choice now but to find ways to make up the difference with their current prices, but it could be an opportunity to gouge people, too. I'm not going for it. The city really is turning into a playground for the rich, if the Holy Cow is no longer a sacred one!\n\nTraditionally the Holy Cow enjoyed a clientele that was ethnically mixed and multi-generational. On the night I was there, although most of the crowd were 20-somethings, I was glad to see much of the same old demographic showing up. This has always been a club for the people---unpretentious, inexpensive, great weekend dance fun, with everyone having a blast, spending lots at the bar, and making love connections. The Holy Cow may be (inadvertently?) extinguishing those wonderful historical qualities now. Looks like it's pay to play from now on.\n\nThe DJ sucked. We kept waiting for him to play some dance music, which is too much to ask for on a Saturday night, apparently. I'm not even picky. Any current pop-infused hits or techno or throw back 80's stuff, or whatever. Anything! He just kept playing hour after hour of that raunchy, industrial, back alley rap beat that is not good for dancing. I can understand playing some of that as warm up music, but come on. It just became degrading to the crowd after a while. Most people were not dancing to it, and there's an obvious reason for that. \n\nMy girlfriend and I made the most of it and just kept dancing with each other because we were determined to have a good time and have a few drinks. And we did, overall. But am I returning to the Holy Cow any time soon? NO. We're going to find other venues that have better dance music and an atmosphere created by the venue owners as less elitist.", "author": "Michael F."}

There are few places that my friends and I are just completely disappointed in and this has to be one of them. I had heard so much hype from others and I think that played into it but most of the reviews are pretty spot on with this place. \n\nWe went there once in the three years I have been here in SF so that should give you an idea of the experience you will get here. Now I am wary of the term ghetto or hood because it could mean a number of things to people but whatever it means to you then that is exactly what Holy Cow is like. Sketchy people doing sketchy things check. Unsafe walk to the place and unsafe area around it? Check. Overzealous bouncers and staff check. Terrible dancing and even worse people on the dance floor check. So now that all that is covered you have all the ingredients for a terrible night. \n\nGiven the location there are just too many other options to go to even if you lived out here. Given that we don't it is definitely not worth the trek over here and shouldn't really even be experienced once. I don't say that about a lot of places. Everyone is just too young and too shady for this place to be fun. The bar set up was nice making it easy to find a spot at the bar but the drinks are expensive and not strong at all. \n\nThe music was decent and there is always a star for a club that will play some hip hop or the djs that actually try to keep the party going. But its not even fun half the people are dancing up on elevated areas and the other half are half dancing around you it just all feels half done. \n\nThe dance floors are incredibly packed and don't even feel like dance floors they just feel like extra space around the bar that people decided to dance in. I just felt uncomfortable the entire time I was there. Like something could go down and no one would be around to stop it. \n\nThe cover isn't worth the experience and in the end I think that pretty much settles on why this gets such a bad score. If I can't justify spending five or ten dollars and wouldn't even consider spending more than that to get into your location then it is just not for me. It could be your style of place but there are so many better clubs that do what they do in a safer environment and with less chance of running into issues.

Everyone crowds around the bartender trying to order and you have to be aggressive to get the bartenders attention. I would order in bulk so you don't have to waste time in the crazy lines. The bathroom is also located all the way in the back where people dance do you have to push your way through just to take a leak. Finally, people LOVE to steal wallets and cellphones especially from girls. Be careful not to put your stuff on the counter when ordering and always check your pockets. One night, I had 5 friends get their cell phones stolen. Obviously there is someone there on a mission to steal your stuff. Beware. \n\nOverall, great place to get drunk for cheap with friends.

The music could be better though especially with the transitions which are not smooth. \n\nCROWD:\nMixed YOUNG crowd with 60% being Asians. Most are 21-24 max. so, if in your late 20s like I am, don't be surprised to meet people from your HS that graduated 4+ years after you. There's about 3:1 ratio of guys to girls. Sorry boys...\n\nNonetheless, the crowd is pretty chill (w/ the occasional d-bags/creepers) and just out to have a good time. It GETS packed after 11:30 PM and although you get shoved, elbowed, and pushed, most people DO say \"excuse me\" and \"sorry\". \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nHC is located among a sea of other bars and clubs like Paradise Lounge, MIST, Butter, WISH and Bootie, but you can't miss it as the large cow out front easily distinguishes it.\n\nHC is a great change from the upscale venues I like to spend my weekends at; it's very low-key, divey, and dingy. As you enter, there's a main bar to the left and 3-4 booths to the right. \n\nBehind the main bar to the far left, there are additional booths and benches; a great place to hide from the madness and chill and \"attempt\" to have a convo with people.\n\nDANCE FLOOR:\nSmall, packed, and is located before the entryway to the patio, which means good luck trying to squeeze your way back and forth without getting a hand/elbow/arm shoved into you or getting stomped on.\n\nPlatforms are located on the left and right side for GIRLS only (when packed). It's the best place to dance since there's fans located above and you can get away from the creepers. \n\nBACK PATIO/SMOKING AREA:\nLarger than the size of the dance floor, it's another great place to escape from the craziness from the main bar/dance area and to get FRESH AIR. There's wooden tables, stools, and booths all around which is a major plus so you can take a breather and relax. \n\nRESTROOMS:\nFour dingy stalls with one sink. Ummm, at least there's toilet paper available? I don't get why there's a huge naked statue of David to the right of the sink--eye candy when there's a booty crowd?\n\nPARKING:\nStreet parking. Since HC is located around many other bars and clubs, try to arrive before 10 PM to snag street parking because there is no nearby garage or parking lot that close late. \n\nHC isn't a place I would spend my Friday or Saturday nights at, but for half-off drinks on a Thursday night, it's MoOoOo-TASTIC!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Unfortunately I had gone quite a bit before but after the last time I went and the way the doorman and his boss think they can treat people I will never go again. \n\nI went with my friends after the Giants game to celebrate them winning the divisional series and wanted to have a good Thursday night out. Instead when we got there one person in our group was singled out for having \"baggy pants\". His pants were not touching the ground and his belt line was not under his rear end in anyways. But for some reason the doorman claimed it was too low, even though I walked in no problem with the same length pants, and told my friend to talk to his boss. Now either his boss was looking for a bribe or was just being rude, but in either case we left. And that would be the last time I would ever step foot in Holy Cow.

Go Giants!). Someone in the group suggested the Holy Cow after the game so we all piled into cabs and headed over, all of us decked out head to toe in Giants gear. \n\nOne group got there first and was already inside by the time my group arrived. The five of us headed toward the door and the bouncer said, \"Nope, no sports gear.

One of the drunker friends from our group started sassing the bouncers a little bit -- \"come on guys, its the GIIIIAAAAAANTS. WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS. Do it for Timmy\" -- but the bouncers weren't having it and started getting more aggressively rude. There was no discussion about whether we could turn the shirts inside out or anything like that... just a repeated statement that we couldn't come in. It was very clear that they didn't really care to have us in their club.\n\nWe asked about our friends who were already inside, who were also definitely decked out in Giants gear, and the bouncer just said \"No, no they're not. If they're wearing Giants gear they're NOT IN MY CLUB.\" We then proceed to call said friends, who come out of the club.... all wearing Giants gear. \n\nI have no problem with dress codes, if they are clear and consistently enforced.

And the answer is, the locals don't go to these places. And that is exactly what and who you will find in here. A mildly to ragingly bridge and tunnel crowd that is here to party and get hammered. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but the 2 times I have been there, I have had to stop myself from shaking my head and enjoy my overpriced drink.\n\nThe first photo for this biz on yelp says it all. Overweight shiny girl with skirt hiked up to show her panties dancing on a bar. A loud and obnoxious bar with girls you don't want to bring home to mom.\n\nLacking in class, individuality and taste, this place attracts the meat head club jocks and mini skirted group gossiping shiny drama queens.

I started to feel uncomfortable as I looked around the dance floor and it seemed like everyone was high out of their minds.\n\nMy friend tried to get me a drink since he thought I was just being uptight.

Every Thursday is when it gets the most crowded and drinks before 12 are probably the best deal yet. Drinks range $2-3 Beers, $5 shots, and $6 mixed drinks. & Boy, they are strong. I was introduced to one of my favorite drinks here it taste like sweet soda but it's a creeper... called a Panty Dropper (Vodka, Peach Snapps, Cranberry Juice) SO GOOD try it! \n\nThe crowd is mostly Asian. Sometimes/ most of the time it's a sausage fest (all dudes) No COVER! The venue isn't large nor too tiny. They have a big smoking patio outside where you can go and socialize, talk with your friends, get away from the crowd and the loud music! Speaking of music, it's not the best. Too many mainstream songs they play every thursday. Its cool when im drunk because me and my crazy gfs just karaoke the lyrics from beginning to end. But im pretty sick of hearing the same radio music crap. \n\nThe reason i really like Holy Cow and you could never go wrong with it basically is because there is no need for pregaming, drinks are strong and cheap, theres no cover, it was always gets poppin later in the night, and its somewhere you can take a huge group of friends to have a good time AND a few friends and still have a freakin blast.", "author": "Rosenel A."}

I came here a lot in my younger days, but I haven't came here in at least half a year or more, but from what I have heard, it hasn't changed much. Yes, there's definitely a lot of creeper guys, but the vibe is good here! Although it's a \"bar,\" it definitely turns into a clubby scene. Maybe it's the one-too-many drinks that I've had here that makes it fun, and the stage that many girls decide to venture up on, or the free cover and the fact that girls do not ever have to wait in line, but this place is half-way decent compared to many other places. \n\nBut super con: this place gets REALLY stuffy and hot and sweaty and yucky. Good thing they have a back patio/outdoor smoking area that you can cool down. But, it sucks that I just get engulfed in smoke to my left and right. \n\np.s.

And then you have girls who are desperate for attention. Balancing this with regular people is hard for clubs to do.\n\nThis venue, at least when I was there, had a ton of both, but it was constantly like one girl was trying to out-skank the other. It was sad that they thought this was attractive... people wonder why I meet girls anywhere but clubs, hah.\n\nDisregarding the crowd, the music kept on being great, then lame, I don't know if the DJ is actually a DJ or just some random guy. It was not great at all. I was also surprised when I walked in that the door and saw a huge bar. Sadly, the bartenders give terrible service. The girl bartender was too busy getting ones stuffed down her bra. Yeah, it's cool unless it takes me 20 minutes to get a drink.\n\nIn summary, if you are coming here just to dance and have fun, pass and go somewhere else. There are many, much better clubs to have fun at with real DJs, even nearby.

With no cover fee and a speedy entrance, I had a feeling that I was off to a good start (which I was). They do have coat check but I am not sure how much that was... I'm guessing around $3 - $5 bucks. Also, they have a pool table but seriously... who is going to play pool when you can dance the night away? I was pretty surprised to see how much seating they had and how conveniently placed they all were. Seats near the bathroom... bar stools... additional stools on the side of the bar... and yes! booths! And speaking of the bathrooms, I love the statue in the women's restroom! HAH. I was on my way to the sink when I noticed the randomly placed window. Oh how I wish they had that in every women's restroom! Random yet awesome. \n\nNow about the bar, or bars shall I say because there are more than one. The main bar, which is in the middle of the club, is pretty large. It's basically this huge oval which means a bar on your left and another on your right. When my friends and I arrived at Holy Cow, we headed on over to the left side of the bar (which was a bit crowded towards the dance floor) to get drinks. We got there at 11pm so we had to drink up if we wanted to take advantage of their deal. Before 12 all drinks were half off! A Mai Tai was $4, a beer was $3 and an AMF was $6. Pretty cheap if you ask me. Some blonde chick made my Mai Tai (the first drink of the night for me) and gosh, it was HELLA weak. I thought I was drinking fruit punch or some type of juice. So I decided to work my way up the bar and try a different bartender.. that was a good move because he made my AMF pretty strong. \n\nThe dance floor was fairly small but given the amount of space they had to work with, I guess you can call it decent. The DJ played a lot of house, electro, hip hop, techno, top 40's... basically music with a beat you can dance to. Not the best playist I've heard but I was content with it. The crowd here was awesome. Everyone seemed to get along with one another and it was easy to start a conversation with someone. There were a couple of dogs on the dance floor but you should expect that at any club you go to. \n\nOverall, I am really diggin this place and I would recommend giving it a try.

I was pleasantly surprised Marcus(the bartender) made it taste so delicious. My friend had never had it before and said it was quite tasty. All night I ordered them up for friends. Even if he didn't know how to make the drink he was willing to try to make it. So I racked up 3 beers, 9 tic tacs, and a random drink Marcus made me for like 50 bucks. \n\nAs the night progressed, the place started to get crowded. At one point my friends and I were just circling trying to find each other. The crowd was pretty nice and not too rude. So all in all good priced drinks, friends, dancing who could ask for more.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

It should be at LEAST 3 since there is no cover charge. Everytime I come here I always have a good time as well as my wallet. Drinks are half off which means you can get drunk with 1/2 the amount of money!! Cheap drinks and free admission are good perks but they don't mean anything if the crowd and music suck. I've talked to some people here and most of them were pretty nice unlike the ghetto crowd at Chug Pub...but thats a different story. Anyways, most of them came for the same reason as me; to have fun without breaking the piggy bank. Thats probably the reason why the crowd rules here.\n\nAs for the music, how can anyone hate a place that plays \"Don't Stop Believin\" and \"Living on a Prayer\"?? It's awesome when everyone sings those songs together on the dance floor.\n\nThe one complaint I have is that if your a guy you NEED to get there early because it'll be impossible to get in later at night. Other than that awesome music + cheap drinks x great crowd = fun times. It's a good date spot too because you'll probably need a girl to get you in here.

After flirting with our group, this one specific security guard moves on to 2 Caucasian ladies (they seem to know each other) .. who then proceeds to walk into a room in a corner, not the restroom, ladies & gentlemen, a storage room. Yes, I said a Storage room! The Security guard follows them in 3 mins later. Together, they're in the room for 25 mins before the ladies walk out and he follows minutes later, all while he's fixing his pants. We're pretty disgusted at the close distance he's standing from party so we move onto the dancefloor. Later, we see him dry humping another random girl on the dancefloor with her legs wrapped all on his waist. Then he still has the nerves to come back and ask us to take pictures. DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY. I kept thinking, don't touch me.

It was a miniature saloon space with no mechanical bull, but a backyard patio and a small dance floor to get your groove.\n\nDrinks from what I remember were stiff for its worth, and the prices were steady (about $6.00-$8.00 a drink). The crowd was pretty diverse but nothing extraordinary to go crazy over. It was a nice getaway if you didn't want to be bothered with trying to go to Temple, Element Lounge, or any other spots in and around the SF area on a Thursday/Friday night. Majority of the music ranged from Top 40, the occasional club hit, and even a rock anthem for good old times sake. The bartenders were quick and courteous, and the bouncers weren't douche bags which really helped.\n\nI haven't been back since, but all I know is if I ever wanna stroll through memory lane.

So skip dancing in the living room or in front of the bathroom mirror and do your thang at the Cow\n\nQuick question for all the ladies...Doesn't it irk you when the bouncer looks at your ID then looks up at you , then your id again...then you? Are they trying to be funny? I really hope not. Standing in line plus SF weather...BRRRRRR...B*t*ch, please? I'm in no hurry to throw my hands in the air but I much prefer to that indoors than in the freezing weather! Luckily, I didn't experience that with the bouncers at Holy Cow. They are all super nice without the entrance drama that you encounter every now & then\n\nIn addition, no entrance fee and this is every night I hear.\n\nBartenders were eye candy however one of them almost charged us twice and we caught it just in time. The tight t-shirt hugging the pecks didn't distract me one bit and I almost lost myself at the wink but...no sir..I got it under control\n\nCan't get rid of them but once in awhile there are douchebags lurking in the corners at Holy Cow.

I was already pretty hammered and ended up drinking five more drinks inside.  Needless to say, I don't remember much from that visit. \n\nFast forward to three and a half years later.  I was having an absolute horrid time at Blow Up (don't ask) so I headed over to Holy Cow, where some friends were hanging out.  The drinks were kinda tasty.  They have a $25 minimum on credit cards. Way lame and annoying.  \n\nI have to give some props for the guys at the front.  The only thing I remember from my 2005 visit was the bouncers.  They saw that it was my birthday and they were so sweet about it.  They were even sweet to me when it wasn't my birthday.  Gotta love that.\n\nMy biggest issue with Holy Cow is the quality of men that were in attendance.  There were some ugly fuckers there, man.  I usually don't mind ugly, but these dudes were shameless and trashy.

Drinks were good and there was a great vibe inside. Overall it was cool.  Until upon leaving at say 1:45am the 200+ pound 6'2\"  bouncer with a pointy mustache would not let me use the bathroom.  He got in my face and told me to get the f out. So I turned around and started heading for the door. And I was suddenly head butted in the back of the head by the bouncer.  Now I'm not sure if that is in the job description of a bar bouncer, but if it is I'm pretty sure it's called assault.

Seriously, I don't know how to explain this so you really get a good picture... I mean REALLY get it...but I will try: \n\n-to the girl in the \"JLo\" outfit (with the gold brass buckle at the top)- Thank you for trying to pole dance with the table in front of us. I am only sorry that the candle on the table you were grabbing to try and look sexy did not fall on you and light your aqua net hair on fire (if that would have happened we would have a 5 star review people) \n\n-To the girl in the sluttiest red prom dress I have ever seen in my life - You got down with your bad self on top of a speaker on the dance floor. Fabulous! By the way, EVERYONE can see your girl bits because you forgot to put undies on... a Britney want to be folks. \n\n-To the pimp in the white suit, 1 word, I am going to break it down into 2 syllables for you (because you are THAT cool) SA-WEET. \n\n-and my FAVORITE- to the girl in the one piece, booty shorts, jump suit complete with zipper. YOU ARE AWESOME! I mean, the camel toe on your already unflattering outfit really did top it off for me. I couldn't stop talking about you or following you around all night just to get another look at you, because seriously, your outfit was that horrible and I really just needed to see it over and over- I really should have just sucked it up and asked you to pose in a picture with me... I really would have liked to show my friends. \n\nFolks, don't worry, I am only on the first hour of my \"Holy cow\" adventure. \n\nNow, the drinks... I can admit that I was snobbish when I went in, I read all the reviews and I was prepared to \"catch an STD\" from the glasses, but ALL WAS SAVED by my BFF Lyn, she knows a guy that works there, so all of our drinks were half off, which makes them taste that much better. Our bar bill was 38 dollars and let me tell you, we definitely had our fair share of liquor (see above description of people who were there if you want to know why we needed all the drinks) - Yes the glasses were warm sometimes, but really after your 5th rum and diet, does it REALLY matter? \n\nNow, the music- I personally loved it. Classic crappy bar music, some guy actually dedicated a song to \"all of his Ho's\" yes, the DJ really did say that. I never did get to meet all of \"his Ho's\" but I have a sneaking suspicion that one of them MIGHT have been wearing a jean one piece jump suit with camel toe action... but I am only guessing here peeps... I can not say for sure. \n\nAnyway, back to the music- My friend Lyn convinced her hook up at the holy cow (how hot is that?) to coat check our bags for free (we saved the 2 bucks!) and made sure that I always had a drink in my hand for a few hours, and THEN she asked the DJ to play THE song, yes, I got out on the floor and showed all of the \"Ho's\" how to in fact bring sexy BACK- now, I know you're thinking, \"but you didn't have a jean one piece jump suit complete with zipper and camel toe or a red slutty prom dress on, how did you bring sexy back Jessica? HOW did you compete with the classiest of classy and sexy?\" Well, I have pictures of exactly how it was done, and I can assure you that to put the \"Ho's\" to shame. I really did. \n\nOn to the patio situation... I don't even know where to begin........ \n.......... \nThere is a patio. I think the people who hang out there though may have \"issues\" which is why they are not allowed INSIDE the \"Holy Cow\": \n\nDear Weird Irish men on the patio of the Holy Cow, \nI thought you were very weird. It is NEVER okay to try and kiss a girl when you 1) just met her 10 seconds ago and 2) when she is making weird faces and backing away from you. It is just never okay. And please tell your short friend not to run away with my friends expensive camera documenting the whole thing, because I am 5'10 and your friend can not be more then 5'2, and i am not nice AT ALL. \n\nThanks for posing for the pictures though, now we can post them and make sure that women EVERYWHERE know what you look like and to walk on the opposite side of the street when they see you coming. I know that we appear to be fans of yours in the pictures, but really if you look close you will see the sheer horror in our faces when you actually put your arms on us. What you don't know is that we took bleach and wire brushes to ourselves when we got home to start fresh on the skin. \nKisses!\n\nStay off the patio is the moral of that WHOLE story, if you smoke, the Holy Cow is a good place to decide to quit just to stay off the patio. Its not worth it people. \n\nNow, I was so excited about all of the happenings that I actually called my best friend in Chicago to tell her about it, and when she didn't answer I called her live in boyfriend to tell him about it. Mostly I just really wanted the world to know about the girl in the jean jump suit with the camel toe.", "author": "Jessica R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-11-22", "description": "I have been to this place a few times before, so this review is not one of those \"on bad experience so I give it one star\" reviews.  We never really plan on going here, but kinda show up here when A. there is nowhere else to go or B. we got tired of the lace we were at and just want one more drink before we grab some late night grub.\n\nThis past weekend was plan B.  Showed up to this place with some friends and didn't even think twice about the dress code because that's the kind of place this is.  They pretty much let anyone in as long as they have clothes on.  Apparently, that's not the case anymore.  Being in the back of my group, I watched them all get in wearing sneakers, t-shirts, etc.  I'm in the back wearing jeans, a sweater, and some dark brown boots, and I'm the ONE who CANNOT get in because of dress code.  WTF?!?!  \n\nIt was raining all day, so I decided to wear my Timberland boots out like most normal people would do on rainy days.  But according to Holy Cow, it is much more appropriate to wear my nike free gym shoes into this place.  I understand the entire stigma behind Timberland boots as they normally have that thugged out look, which most places want to avoid, along with giant white t-shirts, etc.  But let me tell you what else I was wearing.  A north face sweater and rock and republic jeans.  Rock and republic does not know the meaning of baggy, so I hardly looked like a gangster.  I actually laced up my timberland boots and had my jeans cover the top, so it was not like I was looking like the missing member of the Wu-Tang Clan out there.  And I wasn't even wearing those yellow construction boot looking boots, mine were dark brown suede.  Can I paint an even clearer picture than that?  I looked nothing like a trouble maker, yet my boots were clearly public enemy no. 1 that night.\n\nNow here is what really got my blood boiling upon being denied entry.  When I got to the front of the line, this Tim Tebow looks alike looks at my boots and asks for a closer look.  I oblige because I think there is nothing wrong with them.  He then proceeds to STEP ON MY DAMN SHOE!  What the F kind of service is that?  Who the hell literally steps on a potential customer's shoe in order to tell them that their shoes are not on their dress code?  Obviously, I was pretty heated when I had to call my friends and tell them that they would not let me in that place.  When my friends finally made it out, I pushed the little line divider thing and here comes Kenyon Martin's brother out of the woodworks talking sh*t to me and my friends.  Again, what kind of bouncer instigates trouble outside of his establishment?  To make things worse, I was already irritated at his partner's treatment of me a few minutes earlier. \n\nA shouting match ensued with the Kenyon Martin look alike, and while I was being restrained by my friends, this loser decides to follow us an entire block trying to egg on more trouble.  Daring him to hit me, the response was \"I have nothing better to do tonight.\"  Ummm, you're kinda working aren't you?  Why are you following us still?  Like another recent review claimed, these bouncers do not know what the F they are doing and seem like they are the ones who are provoking trouble outside their own place.  Also calling me \"shrimp fried rice,\" because I am Asian is probably not the most appropriate thing to do.  Just my 2 cents.  \n\nThis place will NEVER get my money ever again.  I do NOT recommend it to anyone, free or not.  I would rather pay an extra dollar or 2 for drinks than support an establishment that has these kinds of people employed.  \n\nAlso, the times I have gone in there, the music is your typical top 40 mix with rock mash ups, and the people are either ghetto-noying or living out their mid-life crisis.

(And no I'm not being sarcastic).\n\nI had to say that because it got so badly dissed on this site I had to laugh out loud. I've never seen so many bad reviews for one listing. Yep, what they say is true. It is a total dive. Hot, sweaty, crowded, the floors are sticky, you have to practically scream to talk to your friends (I don't remember it smelling like anything except liquor but I suppose it has its off-nights). I haven't been to this place in a looong time but from what I remember the bathrooms were just horrible, toilets broken, doors barely closed. Lots of trampy looking and acting women and at least as many manly morons. Get out the riff raff repellent. High forecast for some idiot bumping into you with a drink. Fights break out. I even got my purse stolen here ON MY BIRTHDAY 6 years ago and vowed if i ever found that bi-ch who got away with my $400 digital camera and then used my credit card to charge $100 worth of booze, I would wrap my hands around her neck and keep squeezing till I couldn't feel a pulse.\n\nNo, the holy cow is not for the pamered Parises of the universe. You gotta be slightly nuts to like the holy cow. Which is probably why I loved it.\n\nEven after that trama of getting ripped off, The Holy Cow was still my favorite place to go dancing. Yep, it's a damn piece of work all right. But that was part of what made it special. IT'S A FREE FRICKIN DANCE CLUB FOR CHRISSAKE! What in the world do people expect when most dance clubs charge 20 bucks? (Complaining about the riff raff is like going to McDonald's, ordering a Big Mac with Fries, and then wondering why you're not getting the same experience as when you went to Ruth Chris' Steakhouse). Yep, the Cow has it's share of riff raff, but... it's also like shopping at the Goodwill As-Is Store  http://www.yelp.com/biz/xWWdKbmMTR-VgFwdJeA8JA . You have to dig through lots of crap to find the gems but it's all in the joy of the dig. If you don't like getting your hands dirty, FORGET IT. \n\nOr perhaps what's really going on is I've learned to embrace my own riff-raffiness....\n\nMy roommates owned the joint 10 yrs ago (when the cow hanging off the bldg actually looked like a cow and not some bizzare half-leopard) so I used to go there quite a bit.  I don't know what kind of music they're playing these days but I LOVED how they used to play the Clash, the Cure, Right Said Fred.... The campier the better!!! (And I hated techno so I was so happy with their quirky, upbeat alt. pop / rock selection). Even when my friends and I would pay full price to go to other clubs, we'd wind up back at the cow because we really did like the music they played back then. But I guess it's a new generation now (Christina Aguilera was barely known back then, though I do like her). I suppose me talking about how much fun it was to dance to \"Come on Eileen\" by Dexy's Midnight Runners must sound like my parents talking about what a great time they had boppin' to \"Rock around the clock\" by Bill Haley and the Comets...  \n\nMy girl friends and I haven't been here in about 5 years, partly because they're shacked up, settled, and all of us are now so keenly aware that we're now we're the thirtysomething  \"grandmas\" we used to joke about when we were in our 20's! (yep, karma's a bitch). True, I haven't been there in awhile but man the reviews on this site sure do make it sound like nothing's changed and people are still flocking to it like they did back when I used to go there.

So, if you don't drink but still know how to have fun at bars read on. \n\nAs I said before I don't like to drink; so, cheap drinks don't have any appeal to me. I came here on the suggestion of a friend. I was looking for a chill place where I could dance and my friends could get drinks. The appeal was that there was no cover. \n\nWhen I got there me and my friends were immediately pushed ahead of the line to the front; so, I thought \"Yes awesome! No wait and no cover!\". BUT then we got inside. \n\nCrowded doesn't even begin to describe how packed it was. I have been in plenty of crowded clubs and bars but I think almost falling over 5 times (not exaggerating) because you are sandwiched between people and can barely stand, is a bit too much for me. It seemed like the only places on the dance floor that had room were surrounded by creepy guys. \n\nThey had okay music, definitely some songs you could dance too but as I said its really small; so, being able to dance is really hard. I like to go all out when I dance and only having enough room to shift back and forth is not my idea of a good time. \n\nMaybe it's not always this crowded but I'd rather go somewhere else.", "author": "Jessica F."}

The music is kind of old school rap/hip hop/r&b, as well as new pop. Really good stuff to dance too, no techno garbage. The bartenders are always crazy nice, the place is huge so it's easy to find a spot to take over with your friends, the bathroom line is never more than 4 gals, there is a coat check and their isn't a cover charge, or if there is, it's cheap.

I'm broke, so since it is free I'm usually down to go.\n\nFor the most part you get what comes a long with a free admission.\n- creepy guys\n- so- so music ( it's very iffy)\n\nBut if you don't need a flashy environment to have a good time than the Holy Cow is the place to be.\n\nWhat I find hilarious is the Holy Cow's sad attempt at being a high class club. They have a ridiculous amount of security who are all dressed in suits and where their little secret service ear pieces. They try to enforce a dress code, and kicked out a guy I know who was minding his own business because he wouldn't tuck in his shirt! Give me a break if you want to act like your bar is a top notch club than do some renovating, hire a better DJ and start charging a cover. Otherwise Holy Cow will continue to be a step up from a dive bar, that is a convenient cheap place to get trashed and dance your ass off.", "author": "Danielle S."}

No, it's not a mirror you're looking into, it's the other side of the bar, which took me a bit to realize. As you get way into the back, you see they not only have a dance floor, but a side room as well next to the bathrooms.

Slumming is fun and even necessary sometimes (helps keep things in perspective), so I've always enjoyed the occasional jaunt to the less desirable parts of town.

It makes me actually want the parents to come home early to break things up.\n\nThe dealbreaker for me is the music.  I can tolerate the funky crowd, pricey drinks, and bad decor.  But the music...oh, the inhumanity!!!  The DJ (and I use that term extremely loosely here) is ridiculously bad.  I would do better just switching tracks on a few CDs.  He/she wouldn't be able to mix if their life depended on it and their song selection makes no rhyme or reason.  I think the management should buy an MP3 player, download a bunch of music, plug it into the sound system, and just press the shuffle button.  That would be a VAST improvement.\n\nSo in conclusion, go here by all means, but only if you are hard of hearing and are already drunk.  Otherwise, you might as well go home and throw a house party.

Although I strongly recommend coming here with a posse in case you want to avoid the inevitable man handling.  I've been here three separate times and the only time I couldn't handle it, I was only there with one girlfriend.  So clearly you need more than one wingman can handle.  \n\nBut straight up this place is for dancing and getting picked up.  No bones about it.

Myself and 3 friends went there on a Friday night and each one got in before me wearing pretty casual clothes.  Unfortunately, I was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and somehow that equates into being a thug and I couldn't get in.   Apparently you cannot get in wearing a white shirt or baggy jeans that aren't really that baggy.  I can't forget wearing a hat or beanie won't get you in here.  Did I  mention that this is a shitty dive bar?  \n\nWith all that said, I can't lie, this place is entertaining to me.  Even with it's bullshit dress code, I still enjoy coming into here. The place usually has a decent and lively crowd and I enjoy the mix of music.  Time in and time out though, the crowds seem to go buckwild for \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" or \"You shook Me all night long\".  Maybe its always the same people who go when i go.  \n\nThe crowd is a good mix but it seems like most of the patrons are kids who just turned 21 and can't wait to get drunk.  I guess most of us were like that so I can't be mad at that.  If you are looking for a classy joint, please don't come here.  Try next door at Wish, it's like day and night.\n\nService is not bad and the deals on Thursday are pretty good.  I usually don't have to wait long for a drink and there's a good amount of cuties who come in here.

As long as you bring your friends you should have a good time and not be weirded out by the widened age group (no joke; on one intoxicated night, I could have sworn I saw my professor getting thrown out of the bar).\n\nAtmosphere/venue: I like how there's a ginormous golden cow outside so even an intoxicated individual could find his/her way back inside from three blocks away. I do not like, however, the sticky dance floor and some peoples' lack of personal hygiene when they are dancing, as body odor is quite apparent.

It's just a pain making your way through the crowd without spilling your drink.\n\nTo Lauren S. most places that get crowded like HC will not let people with any kind of boots in.  It's for the safety of other patrons.  If you were wearing open toed heels and some guy in boots stomps on your toe that's the end of the night for you.  Get your guy some nice dress shoes or even some decent kicks.

First thoughts in after the horrendous line adventure I suffered alone all demanded I make straight for the bar. The bartender was nice, the drink was good, I had no problems. But no personal space either. With my Long Island in hand, I proceeded to scan the club for a familiar face. Initially no luck, though I saw some very wasted girls dancing on the bar, and I do believe that had one of them been on Jersey Shore I would've heard her laugh about her \"cooka\" being out. That, and had the music not been so unbelievably loud, even for a nightclub. Though, if you're curious, that doesn't prevent  you from hearing creepy boys named Gabriel yell in your ear that you're hot and offer you a free birthday makeout. \nThank baby Jesus, as soon as his hand slithered around my waist, I saw it: a friend!

Started off at House of Shields, which BTW is a great place to start off, and then decided to hit SOMA, because I'm still figuring out what's around there. \n\nSo we decide to go to Holy Cow, because my friends are in the mood to dance or whatever. \n\nThis next detail is important. I'm wearing this really nice woolen Irish cap to compliment my tweed blazer. Yeah, I kinda look like a poser, but whatever. I can back it up and the clothes are nicer than that cheap stuff hipsters wear. It's all about prosperity, folks.\n\nAnyways getting derailed here- - I arrive at Holy Cow with my hat on and the bouncer tells me I need to check it. Well, I thought since the cap is pretty big that maybe he wanted to check it for weapons or drugs or whatever, so I took it off. That's when his tone changed. \"No, you need to take that hat and get it checked.\" I understood, but I followed up with a question anyways. \"Do you mind if I ask why?\" He abruptly spouts, \"We have a standard of dress that we enforce here, and I'm getting tired of talking to you about it. Now you have two choices, you can leave, or you can come in.\" \n\nI don't care about the hat, I would have checked it if they acted like they wanted me to come inside. But I can't dig any place that purports to be  classy by enforcing dress codes, and then treats people rudely before they even get inside. \n\nSo I made my choice, went next door to Wish (which was really mellow and nice) and decided to flame these clowns on the Internets.

Yet how could I have the audacity to rate you, you ask?  Simply because walking past your entrance is like walking past a coughing, spewing child who you want to rush past at all costs.  Your bouncers look as serious as Buckingham Palace guards on steroids and in far worse attire, but to be frank, it is hard to feel intimidated by their rigidity whilst \"Love Shack\" (barf) is blaring from your depths.  \nI've spent many a night in your neighborhood, perusing Wish, Butter, etc. etc.,  and every time I am forced to walk past your doors I feel a little dead inside.  The painfully-outdated-and-not-in-a-good-way music is only slightly overshadowed by the sloppy clientele you encourage to flop around the street corner like beached, nicotine soaked whales.  If you would just accept yourself for what you are- a tacky, run-down drinkery that would be better suited with a polyester clad wedding singer at the door rather than giant bouncers, you might stand a chance.

My general opinion of it has always been that like many clubs in the bay area, it's the epitome skankhood for both men and women and all the worse things a meat market can be. Having said that, I hadn't been here in a very long time.\nAt the invitation of one of my old coworker friends, I had decided to get on one of those godforsaken Partybuses, or the mini Fresno tourbuses that an earlier reviewer so hilariously described it. If it weren't for the great company, I think I would have been in hell.\nThis was the first club of the evening, although it befuddles me as to why it's on the roster at all, since it's free. What struck me first was how different the mood seemed to me. The lights were dimmed down, house music was playing, and the crowd sparse. But this could be because it was earlier in the evening. What hadn't changed was the three girls and one dude who you always see freaking up on the corner stages, the mish mash music from house to 80's to top 40, and just the general vibe of ho hum-ness. The staff were all quite nice, from the smoking hot bartender to the bouncer at the front chomping down a burrito (gotta have carbs when you're guarding a joint) to the coat check girl texting somebody on her cellphone. Laid back, with my mind on my money and my money on my mind", "author": "Kevin A."}

I'm really, really old. \n\nAs stated in my review of Butter, any night that lands you at the Holy Cow is scary, to say the least. \n\nThere were four of us in our little troop. At 32, I was the youngest. The oldest was 35. No spring chickens, but certainly not geriatric either. But an hour in the Holy Cow was enough to convince me that I should immediately check into the nearest retirement facility for active seniors. How did we end up there? The mammas, temporarily unencumbered by children and husbands wanted to go dancing. The BF and I have no clue where thirty somethings go to dance. Or twenty somethings for that matter. Not that we don't like to shake it and all, but we prefer to do it to some live music at the Fillmore or some such place. Or on the coffee table. Naked. But that's another story. \n\nBasically the Holy Cow was within spittin' distance of Butter and there wasn't a cover (Thank you, baby Jesus!) to pay for the frivolity within. But the music sucked (go figure), the drinks were weak (and wrong. The tarted up 21 year old bartender kept giving me Jack and cokes when I asked for Beam and sodas). The crowd (as previously stated) might as well have been teenagers (I'm sure some of them were). The overriding feeling of the whole experience can be summed up in three words: \n                                         PROM FROM HELL.\n\nBut clearly I was out of my element. Had I been more in people- watching mode, I may have had a better time. Alas, I was just there to drink and to see if I still knew how to dance. I am sure if I was an 18 year old from Sunnyvale with a passable fake ID, a bootlicious little outfit and a nice peach-shnapps buzz, I would have had the time of my life.", "author": "Sage R."}

As soon as you walk through the door, it felt like a sauna filled with a smell you didn't want to inhale too much. It may be bothersome to some people, but I just ignore it. Although I would have liked to dance the night away, I could not, because the dance floor was so packed. It was so packed, I spilled some of my drink on some guy's back, on my way to the patio. Oopsy, I think he was drunk and grinding on some girl, so he didn't care. I wish they made another entrance to the patio, but then again, maybe it's not always that packed. The place is pretty huge. And probably one of the most random clubs ever, with the big leopard printed cow hanging off the walk and really diverse quality of music, that I definitely could see myself jamming to if I was super wasted.

It's a bar, but not like those loner bars where people keep to themselves.  At least on Thursday it's not.  People come here as if its a club.  They dress in their club attire, not too semi-formal but better than if you walked in in your street clothes.  Depending on when you go, it goes from packed to fire hazard.  During the school year, it gets packed.  During the summer, winter break, spring break or any kind of holidays, the line goes out the door.  It sucks waiting.  The club knows this and they try to make some money off of you by asking you to pay $50 for a table.  I didn't mention yet that because this is a bar, they don't charge a cover fee EVER!  It says so on the sign they leave on the street.  So, it is kind of ridiculous when they offer this.  They play a mix of top 40's and at times EDM.  They always have a birthday shout out.  There is a happy hour special, half off until 12 on Thursday nights.  I don't know about the other nights because well, I for the most part come on Thursday nights.  The bartenders make the drinks pretty strong and larger than the one shot size you paid for.   A lot of people congregate in the back patio: smoking and talking as a disco ball slowly spins around reflecting little neon dots on your body.  It's very entrancing................  They let you stay out there until I'd say about 1 and then everyone is forcibly migrated to the main dance floor.  It was already packed inside already and with the addition of the people on the patio, you barely have any space to move.  If you feel a tap on your back, it's most likely someone trying to move around you.  Some people forget to be polite and shove.  I've almost gotten into a fight with one of those people.  Play nice people. Last call is usually around 1:15 and by 1:30, they turn the lights on.  Usually you'll know when it's time to go when Michael Jackson's \"PYT\" or Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" comes on.  I've come here on a Saturday night out of pure boredom and it's dead.

A friend of mine was shoved while dancing and an argument ensued, and while we were telling the girl and her two friends to be quiet and walk away from us, the bouncers in the club began pushing us towards the door. I became extremely upset because there was no reason for us to be asked to step outside, considering the fact that we were not the aggressors in this situation. While outside, the club owner and two other bouncers began to yell at us and also made several racially discriminating comments. As we stood outside and tried to explain that we had done nothing wrong and that there was no reason for us to be escorted outside, one of the bouncers pulled out his iPhone and started recording us. I told him to put his phone away because it was clearly inappropriate and extremely unprofessional. A girl standing next to him (who I assume to be his girlfriend) began to yell at me and when I replied back to her, the bouncer then proceeded to yell in my face, pushing me backwards. As he continued to yell, his coworkers pulled him inside the club and right before the door shut he yelled \"I'll kill you!\" to me. When the club owner came back outside, I told him what his staff had said to me and he responded by denying the statement, although he had not been anywhere near us so he clearly had no idea what was said. I then tried to explain that to him but he seemed incapable of listening so my friend and I left shortly after. All in all, I would not recommend attending The Holy Cow. Fulsom Street has so much more to offer and the fact that there's no cover charge doesn't make up for the fact that the staff is beyond unprofessional and is incapable of running a successful business.", "author": "Brianna W."}

Nice outdoor patio that is way underused... Have you guys heard of heat lamps and people there's nothing wrong with the smoking of a joint or 2 in between dances. I think the patio has potential to be the best spot in a club! Anywho...the bartender was nice, although my drinks were weak. I had 2 Jager shots and a pineapple and vodka...(crickets chirping) Nothing! Hmm, makes me think that wasn't Jager in that bottle. THE CROWD... Oh the crowd. There were tons of \"cows\" and average Janes galore. I give kudos to the chicks bold enough to dance on the platforms, but man at least put as much effort into your attire as you do your dance moves. At times it seemed like I was overdressed compared to what a lot of these chicks were wearing. It's like they were trying not to get hit on by guys. And, don't even get me started on the Google employees (i.e. the Nerdy Indian guys). How are you allowed to come in the club with a striped polo shirt more suitable for a 6yr olds play date! Get the F outta here! I don't think I've ever seen one of those shirts in a club. The smell in this club is like WOW! I was dancing with my boyfriend and turned my back towards him so I could do a little sexy dance and I turned right back around because the guy behind had breath that reeked of shit! Literal shit. It was gross! I had it by then and decided to spend the rest of the night on the patio.... \n\nOh and Mr DJ, maybe you should play a whole song or even 3/4th of a song so people can actually dance for a minute to a good song instead of having to get up to dance and then leave the dance floor a second later because you just ruined their groove with a shitty song...

Well, that was 5 years ago, so this review may be outdated, you tell me.\n\nBased on what I've experienced though, I can't tell you how little I think of this place. Choosing to plan your night around it may be the worse decision you make this year, or life. First of all, it's ghetto, people get shot and stabbed here. If your a girl, you WILL get gropped/molested. Those should be reasons enough to avoid the place, right? OK, you don't mind dodging bullets, avoiding knives, and wandering hands. Well, then you might think that the music is just BAD. Or you might find the odor repulsive. If all that doesn't stop you, I will say \"I told you so\". And of course, the bouncers are big shots who like to push their weight around in their yellow jackets, and unfortunately bad things happen to them from time to time. It's a tough gig, I understand, but I can speak for myself and tell you that I mean no harm. OK, fine, I need to be more careful with the pool table. OK, sure, it's a dance floor and to be on it you need to dance rather than stand. My argument though is, who are you to tell me what \"dancing\" is or isn't.

When we asked where he was from he revealed that he and his buddies (there were about 8 other clones of him lingering behind) were from Sac-Town (his word, not mine).\n\nOnce we ditched the drunken Sac-Towners, we headed to the bar. If I was going to endure anymore of the Holy Cow, I knew I'd be needing a big old drink.\n\nThat seemed to be asking a lot. Erica ordered a beer...it arrived in a lukewarm glass. \n\nI cannot stress enough how incredibly LAME this bar is. The drinks might be on the cheap side, but they are awful.

The bouncers told them they could not enter because they were not meeting the dress code?!?!? I friend had very nice levi jeans on, a polo shirt, and some casual shoes. The bouncer kept exclaiming that his pants were too baggy (even though the guy basically had on nut huggers!) I explained to the bouncer that I had a big party that was about to take place and I needed to speak to the owner. The bouncer replied with, \"He doesn't know you and doesn't want to see you!\" Anyways after a half hour of arguing with this guy and having the guy insult me and my friends, we decided to just take off to broadway street and enjoy the rest of the night. We went to several other CLUBS and my friend had no problem getting in. Funny that a BAR would turn down his dress attire!

I went outside to meet a friend and when I tried to go back in this short white bald guy who is apparently a bouncer there was such a DICK!! He accused me of pushing him which I didn't do and therefore he wouldn't let me go back in and because of his stupid ass my friends who were already inside had to leave too. And while I was waiting for my friends to come out I witness the bouncers telling this couple they couldn't go in and for no reason at all! what the hell is wrong with these bouncers?!?!", "author": "Jezebel B."}

Anyway, we had a pretty large fun group of 10+ who just wanted to dance and have fun...and that we did. The secret is to just go with a bunch of people and you WILL have a good time. Good music that night, did nothing but dance from 11-2am.  Free before 11.  Drinks weren't bad either and the bartender gave me a free bottle of water :)", "author": "M M."}

No cover charge, small dance floor, but not too small. Music is standard. But overall it's just a really good place to hang out. It's a great place to pre-game if you're going out, but i probably wouldn't stay there for an entire night.", "author": "Julian B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-16", "description": "Wow...talk about bad reviews. Wasn't expecting this. When I went here awhile back, I had a lot of fun and enjoyed myself. Lot of people to meet and mingle with and the age group that usually hangs out here is in their mid to low 20's which is good in my book. They have a lot of happy hour deals, mainly on thursdays and fridays. I forget what times they are, but they have it on their billboards. Go on these days if you're going to get your drink on. They play good music too. The only problem I have about this place is when the floor gets packed. You can barely move. Also when you go outside to the patio in the back that you think you'll catch a breather from all the heat being produced inside, think again. Lot of people are outside, and a lot of them take their smoke breaks there which is suffocating (no offense to the smokers). Entry is free. It's a good place to meet with new people and to have a good time. I recommend this place to people in their low 20's to mid 20's since that's mainly the age group I see that hangs around here primarily.", "author": "Sean E."}

The bouncers here think they are hot shit when really they aint nothin but a piece of shit.  Me and brother went out with two bad females and the whole night was going according to plan.  We took them out to eat then we went to fuze to get some drinks then across the street to impala to dance and then finish off the night at holy cows where I heard they free entry and cheap drinks. Plus it was right by the teli we rented and we wanted to end off the night there and do the dam thing until the sun came up BUT we get to holy cows and they tried to say that me and brother we out of dress code. HUH? I was wearing ed hardy jeans, a long sleeve Tommy hilfiger dress shirt and gator dress shoes. My brother was wearin basically the same type of thing. So i look inside and there are people wearing shoes with hooded sweatshirts with hats and raggy ass jeans with holes in them.  HUH? So i say to the bouncer, \"they can get in wearing that but we cant get in wearing this?\" he said \"sorry guys i dont make the rules GOODBYE and have a good night\" I said \"F**k you\" and walked away.  I didnt see the what the problem was, especially since we were better dressed then everyone inside.  Maybe because we were Latin and everyone inside was white? Who knows, all i know is, you better bleach your skin and hair if you wana come into this piece.", "author": "supa m."}
