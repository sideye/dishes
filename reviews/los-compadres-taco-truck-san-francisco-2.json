On a typical day during the work week you will usually find a line at this taco truck. For the last few months I've been perusing by thinking I should probably try out the taco truck. If that many people are in line, it must be good... but wait there's more.\n\nWhile the price point is very reasonable and service is efficient, I was disappointed with the final product. Hungry and with urgency, I took my hefty carne asada burrito to a bench a few blocks away and quickly unwrapped it only to discover that the end I opened was on the soggy side. Greasy, the oil ran down my hands, hmmm. I didn't have enough napkins to absorb it all, but managed to eat half of it. \n\nNow about the burrito itself. The burrito was missing key ingredients that were listed in the menu in front of the truck. No cilantro. No salsa. What? Anyway, the meat seemed over cooked and the flavor was okay. Interestingly, they used a shorter rice grain which reminded me of couscous.\n\nTruth. The taco truck serves a purpose as casual Mexican joints are pretty scarce in the area.

We all went this week to see what all the fuss was about. He ordered a super burrito for $9 which came with pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole, and everyone else ordered regular burritos without the extra filling. Note that the super burrito saves $0.50 over choosing the toppings individually, so since it's not listed on the menu it's a good thing to know if you want to save some money.\n\nRegardless, I got my burrito after a 5-10 minute wait, which came wrapped in foil and placed in a paper bag along with a napkin. It felt heavy, despite its size! Once we got back to the office to eat though, I found it to be much less appetizing than I would have liked. As other Yelp reviewers have mentioned, there is a LOT of rice and not a lot of anything else. I wouldn't go as far as saying there's 5% meat, but it certainly was in the minority on the ingredients list. I got the spicy salsa, and it had a good amount of kick and added extra flavor, which I suppose was necessary to compensate for the lack of meat. It was also smaller in girth than the Pepe's Taqueria burrito, so I wouldn't be surprised if it were less food in general. \n\nTo wrap it up, I think it was a meh burrito. Nothing I'd crave to eat but not like eating poison. It was pretty unremarkable. I don't think I'd recommend it, when Pepe's is right up the street in the Rincon Center, which in my opinion serves better burritos faster.", "author": "John B."}

That being said, I always saw this truck parked by my office on Sacramento. There's never been an excessive line so I always walked by it. Tuesday came around and I wanted some tacos...or Mexican food in general. I grabbed my colleague and down we went...to the food truck. For Mexican food. Luckily having a food truck is the thing to do now, because I can clearly remember when the only people that ate off of those things were the people building the houses in my subdivision. I digress.\n\nJ and I went to the truck and low and behold, there were a couple of people waiting for food and only one other person waiting to order. My spidey senses started tingling. The prices were also so cheap. I couldn't believe I was in the FiDi about to order food for less than $10. Something had to be wrong.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito. Being the snotty brat that I am, I had to add some Tomatillo salsa, cheese, and duh guacamole. The dude took my order, swiped my card, handed me a receipt and a number. Then came the wait.\n\nIt was so fast, I was surprised. Once again, I was curious as to how the eff a food truck just made my food so quickly. J ordered two tacos -- for $5. Weird? I thought so. \n\nWe received our meals. They even gave me a paper plate and napkin. Cute right?\n\nWe walked back around the corner and decided to indulge outside since it's finally Summer in San Francisco. I unwrapped my burrito and took a bite. Holy shit....it was amazing! That burrito was full of juice and flavor. The carne asada made me remember all of my delicious burritos from San Diego. I couldn't stop. I had to keep eating. It was that good. I even considered going back for a second because it was that delicious. BUT I didn't.

It is located down the street on Spear between Howard and Folsom streets.\n\nFREQUENCY: This was my first time ordering at this establishment.\n\nFOOD: Los Compadres tacos are $3. Being a huge Mexican food fan I indulged and got 3. I got two spicy pork and one chicken. I live in the Mission District so I've become accustomed to delicious traditional Mexican food places. Los Compadres is definitely a traditional taco truck. I got served my three tacos on a plate with tin foil covering them. When I sat down to eat my taco-y awesomeness that plate looked like a battle had been fought on it. I don't know about everyone else but I like a messy taco when ordering from a place like this. To me that means its really good. That aside, the tacos were all delicious when it came to meat and toppings. I'm a big fan of spicy so I think I enjoyed the spicy pork more than the chicken but both were great. I'd really like to try their other taco types. Apparently the taco's used to be cheaper which has caused some lower reviews but since I never experienced anything other than the $3 tacos I was very satisfied with what I got for what I paid.\n\nDRINK: I didn't order any drinks while at Los Compadres so I can't speak much to what they offer. I'm assuming they have the standard food truck offerings of fountain drinks and water.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Since this is an outdoor stand I can't say there is much an atmosphere for Los Compadres. It's located on the sidewalk and you just wait in line to order, get your taco's, and most likely eat somewhere else.\n\nSTAFF: The staff was friendly when taking my order. Since taco stands serve in a fast food like style you don't really spend much time talking with the staff.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nThis taco stand had good food and I plan to work this into my regular lunch stops.

That being said, I had myself a carnitas burrito sans the beans (not the biggest fan of beans), and there is definitely a reason why the burritos are packaged so beautifully.\n\nIf you're looking for a place that will give you an overwhelming amount of salsa, rice, meat, etc, this is def not your place. I feel like it's portion controlled and I appreciate that! I don't like biting into a burrito and having all the contents fall onto the table for me to stare at with dismay. Hence, the limited amount of contents in the burrito is what makes it so compact and in my opinion easy to eat and more enjoyable. \n\nThe ratio of meat to tortilla was a little off. I felt there was more tortilla than actual carnitas so I was a little disappointed there. Also, although carnitas is fried pork, I wasn't keen on all the oil left at the bottom of my burrito from the carnitas. - 1 star for the leftover cooking oil in my burrito. The meat wasn't cut into eatable pieces either. I had a huge piece of skin in mine which was a little unique to me for a burrito. -1 star for the meat's presentation.\n\nLove their speed from order to getting your food though! There was a line but they're quite efficient with their order to food service is great! Didn't have to wait longer than 5 -  7 minutes.

All well done, no rare or medium rare sections like found in hoity-toity carne asada.  Good for a humble taco truck.\n\nAl Pastor Taco: My favorite of the tacos.  Extremely crispy and spicy small cubes of pork.  Even dripping a bit of flavoring (i.e. grease) to add extra taste.\n\nCarnitas Taco: Got the texture right: some soft pulled pork and some crispy.  The flavor just wasn't there, seemed a bit bland.  Decent, but so many better carnitas around town.\n\nChicken Taco: Probably the most boring.  Tasted like boiled chicken without any spices.

They are so dense and heavy that the paper bag almost ripped when we were carrying our feast back to the office in the rain. Thanks to my co-worker's cat like reflexes, our lunch was saved!! Besides the size of the burrito, I think it is constructed pretty well. Every ingredient that is in there is of the right amount. Not too much or not too little. I also like how the burrito itself doesn't seem to greasy. Some of the burritos I've eaten around the city have pools of oil in them, and that REALLY bothers me. \n\nMinus one star for charging us for extra salsa. I'm glad that the chips comes with a rather large salsa, but when you ask for more they will charge you. There are 2 kinds and personally, I like the green one better because the red one has this smokey taste which I don't really like too much. But, why do they charge us for more salsa? The other taco trucks don't...", "author": "Ayaka S."}

I have a fear that once I order a burrito and I get my order, all warm and nice, and then open it only to realize that instead of my burrito they just gave me a brick wrapped in tinfoil, but when I turn around to discuss this minor oversight they would have already sped away BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A FUCKING MOTOR VICHICAL! Then I would be left standing their with a brick wrapped in tinfoil when I really have a craving for just that, except instead of the brick it would be a burrito, and instead of tinfoil there would be a puppy that totally wants to be friends, but instead of that I would just have a damn brick wrapped in damn tinfoil. This is one of my biggest fears, right in front of my fear of not getting over my problem with having irrational fears. \n\nThat's why I approach mobile food stands cautiously, which is how I approached the Los Compadres Taco Truck., like a baboon.... A SAFETY BABOON!!! (if yelp reviews allowed to have pictures I would insert a picture of a baboon in a safety helmet and a crossing guard uniform). But there are always a few signs of reassurance that the business will not just take off and fee to peddle more bricks to other unsuspecting consumers. Such as a flat tire, or a push cart operated by someone who didn't look that healthy and probably couldn't push/run that fast, or me siphoning the gas from their gas tanks. Though Los Compadres did not have any of these, it did have a stable location where I've never seen the truck move from since I started working in the city. I still wanted to slash the tires just to be safe, but I decided against it.\n\nI was there early for lunch (around 11:45) but there was already a line there, so I begrudgingly got in line and reopened the option of deflating a tire. I ordered the lengua regular burrito, which was kinda pricey for a taco truck. I handed over the money suspiciously, like an antelope.... A DETECTIVE ANTALOPE!!!  (use your imagination).\n\nAs I got my number I made sure I gave them a look that conveyed the message \"you better be cooking meat on that grill and not a brick, because bricks aren't food at all it's building material (or food for rock monsters I guess) BUT DEFINITELY NOT FOOD FOR HUMANS!!!\" I think the cook got my message exactly because he scribbled something on the order paper, which I assume said something like \"Not a Rock Monster\". \n\nOnce I got my burrito unwrapped and took a few test bites to make sure it wasn't a brick or have traces of brick like material in there, I started to fully enjoy my order. The meat had just the right texture that allowed all the ingredients to mix well in the mouth, and a little bit of spice to provide an extra kick. It wasn't too salty or too bland and each bite was just like a fiesta in my mouth (and no one invited that weird kid no one likes). \n\nOverall it was a very good burrito, without any trace of physical construction material, but there was plenty of metaphorical construction material, building a bridge to my heart. The only downside was the higher than usual price for a taco truck and the smaller than usual size of the burrito relative to other taquerias, then again you can't really humor the idea of slashing the tires on other taquerias.", "author": "Youchen W."}

Their al pastor was tasty, although I can't tell whether it's roasted on a spit or it's just marinated pork bits that are grilled up like everything else.  Their carne asada is also juicy and flavorful.  The corn tortillas for their tacos are not greasy like at the hard core taco trucks.  That could be a plus or minus depending on what your preference is.  It's nice for lunch though because I don't have to deal with greasy fingers or splotches all over my shirt.\n\nCilantro haters beware, they throw some in on their cheese quesadilla.

I also asked for no onions in my tacos but yes on the cilantro and what did I get...heaping spoonfuls of onions and a pinch of cilantro (My bf will not be happy when I get home)  :(  \n\nIt was cheap for 3 tacos at $4.50 and there is no tax or SF health surcharge added so that was a plus.  However, I would rather go to my ultimate favorite place for even better tacos and definitely better quality meat for about the same cost.  At least I finally ate at a taco truck so I can cross that off my list of things to do in my life.", "author": "Ayrn H."}

Let's hurry over to the roach coach before the GAP crowd kills it.\"\n\nAround the office, that's a typical line when speaking about my favorite taco truck. Or tacqueria, period. No other place can rival their burritos, a hefty lump of meat and cheese and rice and beans, even big enough to feed two people.\n\nAnd, oh, the place is damn cheap.\n\nRight across the Gap building, on a corner between spear and folsom, the Roach Coach roosts on a crammed parking lot five days a week, from morning to mid afternoon. But if you're not in line before the lunch rush, then you can kiss your appetite goodbye. Frequently, a crowd floods the truck (ostensibly from the adjacent GAP building), sending you packing in line, waiting for a half-hour just to make your order.\n\nBeat the rush and go early. Arriving late isn's a good plan, either, since the roach coach often runs out of meat or rice or chips. When this happen, they over substitute on something, which could be a good or bad thing: See how well your heart and arteries responds when you gorge yourself on a carne asada-laden burrito. . . without the rice and beans. Three pounds of beef. Yum.\n\nBut if you like your steak, then El Tonayense fits right up your alley. It's one of the few places where the meat tastes fresh, unlike El Farolito and La Tacqueria, Cancun and San Francisco Taq. Saturated with a special mix of herbs and sauce, the carne asada is perfectly cooked, perfectly cut, and perfectly presented.\n\nOnce you take your first bite into the savory burrito, you'll marvel at the level of care placed on its construction. From top to bottom, each section is balanced with the right amount of meat, of guacamole, of beans and cheese. None overpower each other; instead, the ingredients complement each other, giving a subliminal taste with each bite.\n\nThe chips, too, serve as equally awesome complement. Only a few tacquerias make their chips, instead relying on prepackaged tortilla chips. El Tonyanese, on the other hand, fries their chips, batters them with salt, and packages them in limited supply. There's a reason why the chips run out around 1pm: they're that good.", "author": "Richard L."}

Yet, for the near decade I've lived in this city, I've had to suffer through Bay Area denizens praising such-and-such taqueria for their \"great chips\" and \"awesome burritos.\" But you know what? You don't get Mexican food for chips and rolled tortillas. Don't get me wrong, those things are good..but there's a lot more to it than that. The pinto beans (you want black beans, go to Cuba, honey) melding ever-so-perfectly with seasoned meat of your choice and a mixture of sour cream and guacamole that is a concoction in and of itself...cheese that's not froufrou and overpowering, but puts just the right finishing touch on a pico de gallo with a kick low enough to allow you to keep eating without putting your fork down. This is Mexican food. And where did I FINALLY find this in SF? My beloved Los Compadres Taco Truck.\n\nThat's right. Tucked elusively on a corner across the street from the Gap building, with maybe 4 metal tables and chairs on a pigeon-visited sidewalk, my Mexican haven sits and beckons passerbys with smells reminiscent of East LA's El Tepeyac (a.k.a. Manuel's). That's a good thing, btw. And like any good taco wagon, it's dirt cheap. I'm pretty sure you pay dollar for pound at this place, which means my Super Taco (don't let the name fool you - you can't imagine what this really is) is 5 pounds. When I add my Specialty's cookie from up the street to that order, sure, I'm too weighed down to get up from my desk for an hour.

DO speak up; the order window was made for guys 6ft tall and up, 2.) DON'T pay any attention to the section of the menu with the regular tacos, they're teeny and more like potstickers made with tortillas before they get rolled up, 3.)

It is fair to say I was skeptical at first, i mean common, street meat?  However this place is extremely clean and the food is delicious, I am by no means a expert of mexican cuisine however this is the best burrito I have to date in San Fran.  The pork is so tasty I want to eat it until I lose consciousness.  Need I say more?", "author": "Nolan E."}

Also just a note to that person flipping out about an eyelash in their burrito, did it ever occur to you that it was probably your eyelash?", "author": "Ian H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-19", "description": "I heard great things about this taco truck from several of my friends. Shared the taco plate and the burrito. Tacos had the typical cilantro, onion, and hot sauce with a radish coin. Hot sauce was really spicy, but I enjoyed it. The carne asada and fried pork were good but the lengua I didn't like too much. It had a weird taste to it. I know, it's beef tongue but, still weird. I've had them at other places and the beef tongue flavor is usually well masked so you don't taste the \"tongue\". I'd probably just stick with the carne asada and fried pork next time. The burrito was good. Great deal. I'd go back.", "author": "J C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-09-01", "description": "Went there today to order a carne asada regular burrito for $5.50.  sign said meat, beans, rice, hot sauce, and cilantro.  apparently, they forgot the cilantro.  also, meat was on the dry side and a bit salty.  size WAS NOT huge.  just okay.  cheese, pico de gallo, guac cost extra.  so based on this visit, i give it 2 stars only (per yep, that means, \"Meh. I've experienced better\").  honestly, i think i prefer chipotle because i can get lettuce, cheese, and pico de gallo added for no extra costs along with a bigger size burrito for $6.85.  without any special reason, i don't plan to go back.", "author": "Andrew C."}

So I had to venture out to try this one out, esp since Mexican food around my work is sub par.  The truck is very clean and they have some seating-- quite an upgrade I think.  I order a steak burrito and I am thinking that I really like it.  Except I spend the entire time thinking, is this beef or is this pork?  Beef or pork??  The meat was that mysterious.  I still dont know what it was.  It tasted good, was a little greasy (but I would expect that), I just have to know what I am eating, so that's why I gave it 2 stars.", "author": "Erica S."}

I was skeptical, but after seeing the crowd standing on the street corner, I figured there must be something to this and gave it a try. I live in the Mission and this is definitely on par with what I'm used to. However, $5 for a super taco is more than you would pay in the Mission, but a good deal for downtown. BTW, this is way better than the taco joint in Rincon Center.", "author": "V M."}
