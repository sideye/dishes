Really delicious, especially with the dipping sauces.  They're massive, too.  We had three between the two of us.\n- Entrees: polenta cakes and corned beef hash (3/5) - These were fine but not memorable.  The appetizers were much tastier.", "author": "Simon L."}

I have been here and had a decent experience a few times for brunch, and definitely countless times for drinks but the last few dinners I had were very off-putting. The waiter did what he could to rectify the situation, which we appreciated but the food was sub-par at best. I was super disappointed to get my steak, which was cold and seemed as if it has been sitting out forever accompanied with some basic veggies that were not too hot either. My friend ordered the steak as well and also had to send his back, he got it medium which was also cold? I was so confused and for what they charge for a steak dinner I definitely expect to at a minimum enjoy it but in this case it was hardly edible and very bland and extremely hard and chewy. \n\nThe waiter did not offer any discount or compensation for the awful dining experience but he was very awesome, polite and charming so he did the best to make us have a enjoyable dinner for the most part. \n\nWould love to come back but can't justify spending the $ when it is so unreliable.\n\nBrightside:The bartenders are phenomenal people and the deviled eggs are to die for, I will miss that. :(", "author": "Ellie J."}

My husband and I both got the deal that included 4 courses (1st - champagne & deviled egg, 2nd - choice of salad, 3rd - poulet noir (roasted king bird) & 4th - carrot cake). It was all freaking incredible. i don't even like deviled eggs and I could've eaten an entire platter of these. My main dish was served beautifully and SO yummy. I couldn't even finish half of it but I definitely enjoyed what I did it. And the carrot cake was incredible; perfect amount of sweet and savory. \n\nThe service was amazing as well. We were greeted so well, allowed to check out the menu and didn't felt rushed one time during the night. Our server was so nice and gracious in how she treated us, which made the experience even more delightful. I can NOT say enough good things about this place. If you get the chance, come here!

After 7 years in the city it's back to its old ways of impressive eats, inventive cocktails and exquisite service. Welcome back. For the record, I'm not saying it really went anywhere but, something has changed and it's the way I remember it from the early days...just fabulous. \n\nIn a recent visit with a large group of coworkers we had an unbelievable evening. From the attentive service to the killer menu, it was truly a night to remember. My first cocktail was a perfectly poured martini and set the tone for the multiple dishes that graced our table. \n\nThe unmissable dishes are below. \n\nThe Poulet Noir - blackened chicken on a cast iron pan and trumpet mushrooms. No joke, this might be the best piece of chicken I've ever eaten. DO NOT miss this. \n\nDeviled eggs are still KILLIN it. \n\nThe whole roasted trout.

My past two visits have been nothing short of amazing thanks to some stellar food and even better service. It's safe to say that we loved every single minute spent within this cozy SF staple.\n\nI have two pieces of advice for you first timers when ordering:\n\n1. If you see the whole roasted chicken on the menu, order it. Seriously, it's incredible. I know, I know, you always hear \"don't order chicken at restaurants\" but this bird is the exception to the rule. Rules are meant to be broken and this chicken will make you question these \"rules,\" which were certainly were written by diners unfamiliar with Park Tavern and their ability to cook chicken correctly. \n\n2. The pork chop cooked how the chef recommends is just my speed. Juicy and plated beautifully, this pork chop has been revisiting me in my sleep. Yes, this chop is what my dreams are made of and I'm struggling to find something to compete with this perfectly prepared pork in San Diego. Soooo... how long will SF to SD delivery take? 10 hours? Worth the wait! \n\nOne final note is to keep an eye on the restaurant floor for a speedy, little, blonde, Kiwi, bussing tables, running food and chatting it up with diners. This hard-working beauty is the owner, not afraid to roll up her sleeves, get her hands dirty, and aim to please. Other SF restaurant owners take notes... she's got the restaurant/service game nailed. \n\nThanks Park Tavern!", "author": "Brad B."}

Don't let the generic name fool you though, this place is far from an average experience. Between the food, cocktails and service I can't really think of a restaurant in San Francisco I've enjoyed more. \n\nA few of my highlights include the Deviled Eggs, Demons on Horseback, Kobe Beef Tartare, and the Marlowe Burger. Honestly though, I was here with a big group of coworkers who weren't shy about sharing so the meal was really just a blur of amazing bites for our over 2hr long dinner. For that reason, I can't be much help on one thing you must order. \n\nThe whole meal was met with impeccable service from every bit of staff who even came close to our table. The owner? She was on the front lines hustling to greet just about every single person who walked through the doors. It was really impressive and a testament to all the amazing service feedback they've already gotten. \n\nIf you're in San Francisco and need a safe bet for a dinner of any occasion, don't let the simple name scare you away.

Inside it's a lighter shade and straightforward decor that is all professional; a nod to the old school spots in SF that served your parents' generation--the parents that didn't go to Woodstock.\n\nLocated right there on the border of Washington Square park (and around the corner from a truffle spot that has my heart) it's a great piece of real estate with a view appreciated from big front windows.\n\nI arrived with a reservation for 10:15am for brunch. Yes, they take reservations! Yes, they do brunch! It was almost empty, so we were lucky enough to snag a seat by one of those windows. \n\nThe brunch menu is pretty simple. Some savories, some sweets, some starters. I had a really tremendous starter--the grapefruit brulee. It's exactly what it sounds like: thick slices of grapefruit covered in a light coat of sugar, then burned (hence the brulee) until lightly caramelized, and dressed with slivers of mint. The crispy, sweet shell paired with the citric bitter burst of grapefruit and cool minty aftertaste was a workout for my tastebuds, and they were invigorated.\n\nI went with cast iron baked eggs, which was a bed of greens, topped with copious amounts of cheese and two eggs, baked to perfection. Simple ingredients but made in a way that felt new. \n\nI was able to try pancakes, and these massive beasts are good. One slight misstep--one of the pancakes on the bottom of the stack was clearly underdone with raw batter in the middle. Just give yours a quick slice to check, I'm sure they would fix it, if this is more than a one-off problem.\n\nAt the end of the meal, I realized the magic that Park Tavern has. As a fella who likes to explore new city cuisine, I really dug it. I was also there with a 70-year-old who has his routines and doesn't like fancy new stuff. He loved it to. New school. Old school.

I asked a question about the smoked deviled egg on the menu, which he informed me consists of only HALF an egg for $3. When I expressed my shock and amusement at the price for a half egg, the server immediately became argumentative and told me that \"there are other places to eat in the city,\" and essentially told us that we could take our money elsewhere. \n\nTo this day, I am not sure what elicited his response. My friends and I, a group of young, diverse professionals (who had already ordered over $40 in drinks alone), were incredibly offended and chose to leave rather than subject ourselves to further insult. A manager did apologize once we got up to leave, but the experience left a bitter taste in my mouth.

Crispy lemon chips with burrata are a fun take on a classic.\n\nThe Marlowe burger is quite the classic but there are other good choices too. The seared halibut with sticky rice and bernaise sauce is a good choice if you're opting for a lighter meal. My fish was slightly overcooked but well-seasoned and I appreciated the contrast between the rich bernaise against the fresh spring peas and cherry tomatoes. The proud roast chicken that stands tall on the plate is a pretty impressive dish, as it is delicious too.\n\nService is lovely and attentive. Couple that with the relaxed vibe, Park Tavern makes for a lovely spot to dine be it seating outside for a sunny weekend brunch or a cozy weekday dinner.", "author": "Jon L."}

Service was fine, though for some reason it took them a very long time to bring out a tea that I had ordered.  Venue was a bit dark because of all the black wood accents inside so it kinda felt depressed inside.\n\nFood: we shared the first two dishes and then ordered our own dish; all together it ended up being a bit much for me.  Might want to consider just one shared dish and then your own entree if you have a smaller stomach, given most of the dishes tend to be on the rich side...\n\n-- Avocado toast (whole wheat sourdough, chile, lemon, sea salt)($10) - recommended by the staff.  Good amount of avocado vs. rest of the toast (sometimes there is not enough or way too much) and the chile gave it a nice flavor, especially since I think avocado is generally bland.\n  \n-- Smoked Deviled Egg (bacon, pickled jalapeno, chive)($3) - Recommended by the staff.  They give you quite a lot of filling, placing it between a one- or two-bite dish.  Bacon added a nice smokiness and the jalapeno gave a good kick.  \n\n-- Cast Iron Baked Farm Eggs (sauteed kale and shiitake, jamon Serrano and Gruyere cheese)($15) - very filling, especially when you are talking about a nice, runny yolk and LOTS of cheese (maybe a bit too much cheese).  At least there was a decent amount of kale such that you felt slightly better about yourself after.  Kinda wish they incorporated the jamon Serrano into the cheese/kale/mushroom mixture rather than just sprinkle it on top... though I ended up brushing most of it to the side since it was super salty.  I was so full that I pretty much scrapped the cheese to the side and ate the egg and veggies mostly.\n\nOur meal came out to around $25-30 for the food (we didn't order drinks or dessert).  Seems quite reasonable given the portion and richness of the food.\n\nBetween here and Marlowe, I tend to lean toward Marlowe- maybe it's because Marlowe has a brighter interior or maybe it's that I feel like Marlowe offers a few lighter options meal-wise and didn't feel so heavy after eating there.  Nevertheless, I still think Park Tavern is definitely worth a try as a solid brunch option.", "author": "Audrey H."}

These dishes were all exceptional in portion size, presentation and flavor. \n\nFor Entrees: two of us had Steak Frites and one had the Duck. I'm not a huge fan of Duck but my friend said it was excellent. The Steak Frites is where Park Tavern fell down for both my friend and I. The fries were crispy and soggy and we both thought that they were treated like a cheap plate filler. Even the plate design was odd - sort of like a cross between a bowl and a platter, with made the steak impossible to cut efficiently. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out mostly rare and unevenly cooked. My friend's steak was cooked appropriately. This right here is the issue: inconsistency. Not enough to stop me from going back if I'm in the neighborhood - because this is pretty solidly a 4-start restaurant. Yet, for $80 per head (with one person not drinking), you expect the food above all else to be perfect. \n\nMISC: The waiter disappeared once toward the end of the meal. The bar does not carry Southern Comfort. The managers seem uptight. Our waiter was super-pleasant and knowledgable about which wines are paired best with the entrees (he paired a perfect selection with the duck). \n\nFinally, the \"Summer Birthday Cake\" was excellent. It was refrigerated perfectly - not ridiculously cold and not warm either. The cake was perfection - so our dining experience ended on a positive note.", "author": "Bulldog W."}

I dined here recently for a company holiday dinner and had a great experience. Excellent service and cozy interior, especially during the holidays. The restaurant is located right in front of Washington Square Park, great location for a pre or post meal walk. \n\nPark Tavern is an 'upscale' American tavern, featuring a menu that rotates seasonally with a few items that remain year-round. They also have a solid lineup on cocktails.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n- PT Fries with truffle oil: You dip it in a soft boiled egg mix with caviar. Fries were crispy with a strong truffle flavor.  So good!\n\n- Brussels Sprouts Chips: I thought it was okay. Too salty and oily.\n\n- Smoked Deviled Eggs: Topped with pickled jalepenos and bacon. One of my favorite deviled eggs ever. \n\n- Demons on Horseback: Lardo-wrapped smoked prawns. I thought they put a little too much remoulade. Still great nonetheless.\n\n- Crispy Pork Belly with forbidden rice, onion marmalade, and pickled mustard seeds: One of the favorite appetizers of the group. \n\n- Peppered Tombo Tuna with yukon potatoes, pole beans, olives, salmoriglio and radish: The tuna was cooked medium-rare and cut into large pieces. Not a huge hit, but the fresh tuna was a great balance with all the rich, heavy appetizers I had prior.\n\n- Poulet Rouge: Wow, this dish is a like a mini rotisserie chicken served on a plate. It's kind of messy, because you have to dig into the chicken and carve out your own pieces. It takes up to 30 minutes to prepare, which is likely why all our entrees came out a little late. Fitting dish to meet a huge appetite. \n\n- Wood Fired Pork Chops: I didn't get to try this dish, but the portions looked huge. \n\n- December 'Birthday' Cake: Think pumpkin carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. The slice was served with a candle, though we weren't celebrating any birthdays. We all shared this since we were stuffed. The cake was gone in minutes.\n\nOverall solid spot for locals. Highly recommend.", "author": "Helen C."}

Def more sweets than savories. Prices are very reasonable. \n\nI had been wanting to try their brunch for a while bc their lunch and dinner menu didn't seem to have too many options I would like.\n\nThe inside is beautiful and spacious I love the lighting and the cabin like decor! Very cozy! \n\nWhat we got: Avocado Toast: so I'm not one to order avocado toast at brunch just bc I'm kind of against paying $$ for something I can easily make at home and it's usually just as if not better. Well the one here was amazing. It had the perfect combo of toasted garlic, chili and sea salt aka perfection. Plus they use a whole wheat sourdough!! \n\nDeviled eggs: these seem to be a highlight on their both brunch and dinner menu. I thought it was done well but not amazing but I did like the pickled jalape\u00f1o. It's $3 for one piece which I've seen is standard at most places .\n\nChorizo and eggs: I only had a few bites of this from my dining partners plate and thought it was really good and I don't even like Chorizo. It wasn't greasy or too heavy and the potatoes mixed in were yummy. \n\nOatmeal Raisin Pancake: OMG so so good! We got one instead of a whole order bc we were pretty stuffed but like I said omg so good. It's perfect esp if you love cinnamon like I do. The raisins inside the pancake are perfect it's fluffy soft and just the best way to end the meal.

The polenta was perfectly cooked and seasoned! The egg was well cooked and really worked well with the mushrooms, arugula and polenta. A+ dish!!\n\n- Cast iron baked farm eggs (saut\u00e9ed kale and shittake, ham, and gruyere cheese): This dish was good but not great because it felt like a side dish. Tasty but salty!Almost like a cheesy artichoke dip you would have at a friends house. It was tasty but not sure as an entree. My friend asked for more bread in order to keep eating it..\n\n- Smoker trout benedict (poached egg and focaccia): tasty!

Thanks! \n\nNote that I've been a customer and fan of Park Tavern for over two years. However...something has changed in the last few months! Whether it's management, service, or the food, something needs to improve!\n\nWe ordered: \n- The Bar Steak ($34+) was just ok. Simple cut of meat and cooked fine (medium-well). Would order again but it's not a $30 plate. Should be $22-$25 range based on size, taste and overall simplicity/blandness. Would be nice if it had some greens, potatoes or a simple side. Tallow fries (jush blah) were there but nothing special. \n\n- The Marlowe Burger ($16) was nothing special. For a $16 dollar burger the price is fine. The serving size is kind of a joke though...It's like a nibble of food. Comes with bacon and a side of frites. \n\n- Pan Seared Halibut ($33) would never order again! It's too messy of a plate. The farrow and beets just don't go and it's not \"fresh daily\" tasting, sorry! Was overcooked, gritty and dry. Was greatly lacking in flavor. \n\n\nThe Atmosphere: \n \n+ American upscale food that's now proven to be a miss. Hope it improves.\n\n+ Great for a night on the town, not great for a large party looking to actually have a conversation w/ one another. \n\n+ Neat and authentic ambiance. The displays are simple and understated. Not fancy, just simple. \n\n- The table was \"not a perfect table\" and was in the middle of the dinning room x bar. Had a walkway divider but was noisy, uncomfortable and the lighting was horrible. Two other tables had to shine light onto their menu's just to read. \n\n- The servers weren't engaging, kind or at all interested in top tier service. It wasn't that they were overwhelmed with our group size, it was just that they were literally uninterested in entertaining/ serving. \n\n\nThe worst: \n\n- Note that I made a reservation on Thursday of last week with a lovely male host who got us our perfect time slot for 7:15PM. He was the same host who sent over the free appetizers, thank you! \n\nI cancelled the next day as we thought our whole party wouldn't be able to attend. \n\nWhen cancelling the horrible experience began. Can't recall the female hostess's name but I want to say it was Adriana. Any who... it started with an A. \n\nOver the weekend, trying to re-book I got her at every call. She was snippy, rude, pretentious and overall just very unpleasant. I honestly have no idea how she works in customer service and as the face of a business. My father owned two renowned restaurants and I grew up in the industry.\n\nHer tone was sharp and she had the nerve to address me as \"hun\". First off, I was giving her my credit card, for a party of 8. I've dined at Park Tavern numerous times and it had never been unpleasant until now. \n\n\nI really hope that the service improves. Overall Park Tavern is an OK place to eat that I would recommend to someone wanting an average experience.", "author": "Clara D."}

I love the location, and it is a welcome change from the endless Italian food in north beach. \n\nThe service is quite good, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly and they have a good wine list. \n\nI only have pictures from a recent brunch. My boyfriend and I stepped in right when they opened, their reservations were booked but luckily we were able to sit at the bar. We started with avocado toast (outstanding!) which had a garlic chili oil sprinkled on top. I was pleased that the toast was crisp and not soggy from the avocado. My boyfriend had the egg skillet, which was very cheesy and he liked it a lot. I ordered the walnut and raisin oatmeal pancakes but was served buttermilk pancakes (our waiter apologized and I enjoyed the pancakes nonetheless). \n\nWe had dinner here a few months ago for my birthday. I had duck with a cherry glaze and my boyfriend had a pork chop. Both were cooked perfectly and served with tasty and interesting sides. \n\nOverall, highly recommend for a nice date night or occasion in North Beach!

Food is good but pricey and not impressive, made up for by great service and ambiance \n\nMake reservations in advance! I made mine 2 weeks in advance for a Saturday for 3 people and most of the normal dinner times were already taken. The restaurant was busy when we got there at 6:30 and stayed consistently busy until 8:30 when we left. Definitely would recommend snagging a reservation if you can, especially for weekends. \n\nAmbiance here is on the nicer casual end. Great service - very attentive but not overly so that you'd find it to be intrusive, basically what you'd expect from a nice restaurant.\n\nFood here is good but wasn't really wow-worthy. Nothing super unique or creative. If you plan on getting whatever Poulet they have (rouge, noir, vert), make sure you tell your waiter early since it takes 30 min to prepare. Prices are on the higher end (~$30 an entree), and while the food was still good, it didn't impress me enough for a return visit. I'd come back or recommend for the overall atmosphere but not so much for the food. \n\n* POULET ROUGE ($32) - 4/5\n[roasted peppers, toybox eggplant, ceci beans]\nIf you're really hungry, the chicken is probably your best bet here. It's literally a whole chicken sitting upright in a bed of veggies. The chicken was tender and juicy, and the skin was crispy and fatty, but aside from the presentation, I didn't find the dish to be particularly special. Flavor was simple and I would've preferred the veggies sitting in less of a pool of oil. \n\n* BEEF TARTARE ($19) - 4/5\n[smoked bone marrow, quail egg, crostini]\nBeef was fresh. Loved the bone marrow! The fattiness paired really well with the raw meat and gave it a richness and a nice, smoky flavor.", "author": "Jessie L."}

In general, the trout benedict was okay. The horseradish cream was a little strong for my liking, and the choice of using foccacia as the base of a \"benedict\" was interesting though mis executed as the base was pretty soggy.

None of the entrees I had last night, for example, were on the menu in January over a year ago. There are staples, like the poulet rouge, pork chop, steak, marlowe burger, and appetizers that stay fixed, however.\n\nFavorite appetizers are the brussel sprout chips, smoked deviled eggs, and pork belly. The brussel sprout chips are generously salted and oiled, then roasted to crisps. The pork belly, while fatty and flavorful in and of itself, is served with an amazing black \"forbidden rice\" and caramelized onions for an incredibly flavorful and textural bite. We split the black miso cod for our entree, which was tasty, but not quite extraordinary. The cocktails, in addition, are all well-mixed and satisfying.\n\nLast night, we had an unfortunate situation in which an elderly lady sitting at the table next to us suddenly began screaming at us, complaining about the volume of our conversation. We had not been talking above normal table volume and were completely surprised by her reaction. She continued on in an extremely rude fashion, even invoking racial slurs. The hostess moved us immediately and apologized profusely. The assistant general manager and even our server did as well, and noted that she had been incredibly rude to everyone the entire night. After learning a bit more about what transpired, the assistant GM asked them to leave. Everyone was incredibly apologetic and good to us the rest of the night, even bringing us some champagne.

Great location in North Beach across from the park, well done on the furnishings and interior and great wait staff. The only aspect lacking, and only slightly, was the quality of the food. While some of the food items were great, some were off. The deviled eggs and brussel sprouts were well made with clear evidence of them being well thought out and designed. The egg appetizer had a nicely hard boiled half egg with a perfectly cooked thick cut bacon portion and a well seasoned yoke mixture. The brussel sprouts were deep fried leaves and were well seasoned also, but was a rather small group of leaves served in a fairly large dish. The mixed green salad with avocado was also well done though some leaves were a bit awkwardly large. For main entrees, we had the steak, shrimp and poulet rouge. This is where the meal turned in the other direction. The steak appeared a bit overcooked. The poulet rouge was a full game hen and thus a large portion, but the accompanying sauce made the bottom of the dish look soup-like with large portions of sliced zucchini and squash. The disappointing aspect was that the hen was clearly overcooked and thus dry unfortunately. The skin remained tough despite having clear char-marks throughout. \n\nMy remedy would be to sous vide the hen at a lower temp for a longer cook time to soften the skin, and then broil at 400 to crisp the skin and finish with poured hot butter spooned in a pan. More work for sure, but the end result should be pleasing. I would also recommend they experiment with a blanc-cream sauce to stand against the sour (but fine) flavor residing in the squash slices.\n\nFor dessert, the birthday cake looked very colorful, but also looked very heavy. The cr\u00e8me brulee had a nice caramel flavor but was a surprisingly small portion (served in a tea cup sized dish). \n\nThe large bar area that offers a communal dining experience is a nice touch and look inside. I think that if they really upped the main entrees and pushed the creativity level that this place could offer very strong potential in a very tough and competitive dining area.

The dish, which had bacon bits and cheddar, was overall pretty savory, albeit a bit on the salty side. The firm and meaty smoked prawns were a crunchy, tasty delight. No grits, no glory! \n\nIn addition to the grits, I had the opportunity to taste the Smoked Deviled Egg with bacon, pickled jalapeno, and chive. This was YUM-MY. \n\nThe French toast plate, with cherry compote and mascarpone was so-so---I wasn't too eager to devour it. Not to mention it was too sweet for my liking.

Don't have a reservation for brunch - no sweat - put your name on the waitlist for the first-come, first-serve shared communal table; best for groups with an even number. The seating is tight at the shared table so be weary of sharing juicy stories as those around you are likely listening in...\n\nSmoked salmon Benedict - on top of the toasted rustic bread, laid a decent portion of smoked salmon that was light in flavor, not overly smoky in flavor  and a perfectly poached egg with classic hollandaise sauce. Note - if you're sharing, add another egg so each person cleanly gets a portion.\n\nFrench toast with cherry compote - good texture, not overly seasoned with spices and adorned with delicious cherries that have been stewed in a light syrup", "author": "Julia K."}

We were taken to our table and before we sat down the waitress was already asking us what we wanted to drink. We asked for a few minutes to settle in and we watched her roll her eyes and walk away. She returned literally 1 minuet later and again asked what we wanted to drink. Once again we asked for a little more time to decide. Then another waiter took over for her and we ordered drinks from him and watched the first waitress leer at us. We ordered dinner and that's when things got worse. The waiter spilled food on me with with very little apology. The bus boy tried to take our food away with fork and knife in hand. The waiter asked us if we wanted another glass of wine, with wine still in the glasses. We said no thank you and before we could say anything, took the wine glasses away. \n\nBottom line is this, the food was quite mediocre at best the hustle to turn and burn the tables was unbelievable and the service is simply a joke!

Yes, they allow RESERVATIONS for BRUNCH!! Thats awesome! We did have to wait about 10 mins to be seated after our reservation time. We were a party of 6 and we started with 2 orders of their Challah. Its thicker toast on butter, cinnamon & sugar. I love toast and I love cinnamon sugar. It was good and crunchy but I felt like some areas of the toast did not receive any cinnamon sugar love. Since it's $7 dollars, I was hoping for more cinnamon sugar. We also got a side order of fries. YUM! Their fries are delicious.\n\nI got the Pan-Fried Corned Beef Hash. It was pretty tasty, but I think the portion was small. If it wasn't for the Challah and fries, I wouldn't have been content. I'm a size 4 and this size 4 needs a little bigger portion. A few of my friends got the **Cast Iron-Baked Farm Eggs. They think its very yummy but yet again, the dish was very tiny. We end up walking over to Chinatown for some pastries. The services was good and some of my friends were picky but the server, she was great. I would come back for large parties because they have reservations for brunch. That a super plus!

I was able to get reservations at 10:15 a.m. on Saturday about a week before. When we got there, the restaurant was pretty empty but filled up by 11 and had a ton of people waiting. Definitely recommend reservations!\n\nThe decor is very modern and I guess rustic. Reminded me of Girl and the Goat in Chicago, if you've ever been. We got seated in a cozy corner table near the kitchen area. It was a bit chilly/drafty inside (it was also a typical foggy day in SF), and didn't seem to really warm up. The bf kept his jacket on, and I ordered tea to keep warm.\n\nThe menu is short and straightforward. I think it has a bit of everything for everyone's brunch tastes for a short menu. Our server gave us a rundown of the popular dishes, which was helpful. Service throughout was nice and attentive. They course out your meal (or try to), so they come around and clear the dishes and clean the table when you're done with one course. I honestly felt coursing out a brunch was kinda unnecessary =/ \n\nTo the food!\n- Avocado toast: Good, but nothing crazy special\n- Smoked Deviled Egg: Very interesting flavors. I think the pickled jalapenos + bacon was an intriguing combo, not sure if I 100% liked it. The bf did not enjoy it :P\n- Shrimp and Grits: YUM, but the shrimp was quite salty =X The grits definitely helped to balance it out (I don't think the shrimp were intentionally made that salty FYI)\n- Buttermilk pancakes: They give you a really sadddd amount of syrup with the pancakes. Nothing super special about these pancakes either.\n\nI was not disappointed with Park Tavern, but I was also not impressed.

What a combination of failure from hostess to server who wore a contentious mask of snobbery and indifference the entire unpleasant evening. Please! Get another job if you don't like what you are doing, and not make guests suffer. The hostess refused to seat us at a more comfortable table even though it was not reserved and was available in the main dining room. She lied to my face and said it was reserved for a party of five, (we were a party of four, so no big deal right?) Fifteen minutes later she seated a walk in couple (2) at the table for five. We had requested a main dining room table for my birthday. We were sort of surprised as we had asked two different times to move and when it's easy to make a quick change  for a guest based on an easily open table you should do it if it's a chance to make a difference in your customers experience. Fast forward to our server who was an unbelievably callous and disconnected waitress. She snubbed us and her whole area the entire evening. No welcome . No explanation of the menu. No hi , welcome to park tavern , just this smug and unhappy attitude . I tried several times to engage her in polite small talk in hopes of getting things on track , how was your evening going ? Seems a bit busy tonight , hope your hanging in there , it's our first time here etc. she just blankly stares back. When inquiring about the menu and cocktails on both times she said \"I have no idea\" or \" I don't try everything \" or \"that's new how would I know\" Drinks came out at a slow procession and the entire dinner took 2 hours. When she dropped off my slice of cake with a candle for my birthday she just plopped it on the table lit candle and stomped off to attend other unhappy customers. Not impressed . I don't leave reviews like this. So many other places to eat.  Food.. while pretty enjoyable was really truthfully mediocre at best by SF standards. Atmosphere and ambience were on point with dark woods and good lighting and festive bar. Unfortunate that the wait staff let a potentially good experience rattle around as a gutter ball missing all the pins.\nMaybe it was an off night or the stars were not aligned but this was just not an acceptable experience for us, your mileage may vary. Perhaps brunch is where  they excel.

Nailed it!\n\nWe arrived ten minutes before our 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday night. The hostess informed us that they'd seat us at 5:30pm- my first impression was that she seemed a little grumpy for a welcoming hostess. No smile or no \"Good evening!\" It didn't bother us- we wandered to the bar to grab a cocktail and checked out the swanky ambiance. Dimmed lighting and classy, white tablecloth tables- I loved the vibe (perfect for date night and visitors if you're not trying to go to a fancy steakhouse but want that type of style).\n\nWe were promptly seated at a two-person table near the kitchen. I always love watching chefs at work, especially when there are huge flames involved! I'm addicted to pork belly, so we ordered the crispy pork belly from the Appetizers list, as well as the lardo-wrapped smoked shrimp. The pork belly was so divine- fatty and flavorful- order it! The shrimp was plump and good, but nothing too unique- you can skip it.\n\nWe split the $32 whole chicken as our entree, which lived up to its hype. Juicy, tender chicken on a bed of veggies- mmm. You won't regret it. That's pretty much one of their classic dishes and I can see why so many Yelp reviews rave about it.\n\nFor dessert (yeah I know, we eat a lot), we ordered the lemon cheesecake and ice cream sandwiches. Both were meh- the cheesecake too tart and lemony and a little mushy in texture, and I wish I knew the oatmeal cookies in the ice cream sandwich were crunchy and not warm/soft. You're better off enjoying an It's It from a grocery store if you're in an ice cream sandwich mood.\n\nThe overall service was very pleasant. Our main waiter checked in frequently and kept our table clean and our waters full. The food arrived at a perfect pace. The bill fit the quality of the food and service.\n\nOverall, I would've given 4.5 stars if a) the hostess had a friendlier and warmer disposition, and b) if they had rocked the desserts. I'd come back here again to try the Marlowe burger and deviled eggs, though!", "author": "Tanya B."}

Instead of politely asking if there was a problem, he became threatening and glared at her and spoke very loudly about not being tipped, he slammed a glass down on the bar and glared threateningly at her again.  She realized that she should have tipped and was going to but was quite nervous at his reaction and when we all looked back  - he was glaring at all three of us and talking to another customer.  I was shocked.  Park Tavern is my favourite rest and I eat there regularly, this type of behaviour is not acceptable and I honestly don't feel comfortable going to the bar again.  It was an honest mistake and could have been rectified by a simple question instead of aggressive behaviour which made us all feel nervous.", "author": "Anne-Marie C."}

Decided to try it out since they had availability for the time we needed and great reviews on OT. Arrived for our reservation and were seated within a couple minutes. Our server came over promptly and brought waters. At our request, she reviewed the chefs menu for that evening which was a bone in T-bone steak with scalloped sweet potatoes, beet greens and a chimichuri sauce. We decided on that as the entree and started with the persimmons as a starter. The persimmons tasted fresh and were easy to cut. The whole almonds were a bit challenging to serve and even more so to eat using a fork, but it was a nice starter. Our steak was \"misfired\" so we got to try the deviled eggs & Brussel sprout chips. The eggs were great - topped with jalape\u00f1o and bacon. The Brussel sprout chips  were hit & miss for me and my date didn't enjoy them at all. The hard fried pieces were not good to me... the ones which had a bit of green left were the best bites & the lemon was a good edition. The steak & sweet potatoes came out shortly after and they were PHENOMENAL. The waitress picked an excellent Tempranillo wine to pair with the meal. The sweet potatoes were delicious- cheesy, sweet and savory. The steak was cooked a perfect medium and already cut off the bone in slices perfect for serving. We finished with coffee creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was perfectly portioned alongside almond biscotti. Will be back!", "author": "Alexa S."}

This was a bit of a challenge because my friend classifies me as a discriminating gourmand with hipster tastes while he, on the other hand, is into more luxurious environs. I figured we'd give Park Tavern a try and thankfully I made the right choice. He got his chic ambiance and I got my good food. \n\nBeing from LA and having lived on the East Coast where dressing up for Friday night dinner feels more commonplace, I've come to realize San Francisco is interestingly more casual than LA despite SoCal's \"laid back\" reputation. Silly as this sounds, I miss dressing up for nice dinners -- and this is certainly the case for my friend as well. It appears we found one of the handful of restaurants where male diners donned button-ups and female diners wore beautiful dresses and coats. BUT, the nice thing about Park Tavern despite its aesthetic formality: it didn't feel stuffy by any means! It was sophisticated but buzzing.\n\nWe had a late dinner reservation for 9:30. Our friends just flew in from LA but were ready to hit the bar. That said, as soon as we walked in (after being nicely greeted by a lovely hostess and friendly host), we saw our friends enjoying their drinks. My friend had the McLaren (gin, cucumber, lemon & ginger beer) and his boyfriend had Mary Etta's Bubbles (sparkling wine, framboise & lemon twist). Our other friends walked in and the six of us were escorted to our table close to the semi-open kitchen. While we decided on our appetizers and entrees we were given some rustic bread and butter to nibble on. I also decided to order a glass of a Demi-Sec Ros\u00e9 (G\u00e9rard Bertrand, Cr\u00e9mant de Limoux, France 2013). This was a lovely, lovely, lovely ros\u00e9.  \n\nFive of the six of us wanted their smoked deviled eggs which were fantastic to start the meal. The bacon and chives were familiar accompaniments but the pickled jalape\u00f1o was a fun surprise. My boyfriend and I also had the Marlowe Burger which they nicely divided in half for us to share. The horseradish a\u00efoli made that burger for me. Oh, and they have pretty good fries: golden, crisp, and not too greasy or over-seasoned. We also ordered a new item on their menu: the pork belly with mustard seeds and (if I recall) black rice. The salty pork cracklings were out of this world. Also, at the insistence of two ladies we met in a Lyft on the way to Park Tavern, we ordered the brown butter brussels sprouts with parmesan and chili flakes. We both agreed this was good but not the best thing of the night. Finally, in terms of dessert, the six of us were stuffed yet we wanted a sweet bite to round off the meal. We split the September \"birthday\" cake which was lemonade-inspired. It came out with a lit candle on top so that was a cute presentation \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive as well as the other waitstaff. Park Tavern's service, food, and ambiance were spot on. It took my boyfriend and I awhile to check out this spot but we're both glad we did. Park Tavern is classic Americana.", "author": "James Z."}

This place is marked $$$ but honestly the prices for brunch are more $$, every meal option was pretty reasonable given the amount of food you get. \n\nI ordered a John Daly (tea-infused vodka with lemonade) to drink, very refreshing during this heatwave rocking SF right now. We also ordered two plates of their Challah toast that's covered in cinnamon and sugar. So freshly baked and sweet, I probably could have just eaten more of that if they let me. \n\nEveryone loved their meal, I can't wait to go back.

I came by for brunch one day and had their famous Marlowe Burger which was the first time I had ever it.  That brunch ended so quickly that I felt it wasn't right to write a review at the time.  So it wasn't until several months later that I came back with a bunch of friends for dinner.\n\nFirst off for brunch here's their Marlowe Burger:\n\nThe Marlowe Burger --  http://bit.ly/1e2t9Rd\nCaramelized onion, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli & fries\nThe famous burger delivered!  It's a good bun to meat ratio and the toppings work together really well.  It came with fries so that's always a good thing!  It's one of my favorite burgers in SF.\n\nThat was basically it for brunch.  When I came back for dinner with a few friends, this was when I got a true taste of what Park Tavern is all about.\n\nPT Fries --  http://bit.ly/1x1RdLA\nTruffle, Soft-cooked Egg, & Caviar \nThis blew my mind!  There's something special going on when you dip the fries into the egg with caviar mixed in.  This should be a must order every time you come here!\n\nSmoked Deviled Eggs -- http://bit.ly/WE1iDp\nBacon, Pickled Jalepeno, & Chive\nThese are probably my favorite Deviled Eggs ever.  Perfectly piped eggs with some bacon and of course the Jalapenos to give these eggs some heat.  This is another must order!\n\nPoulet Vert --  http://bit.ly/1r8nZsQ\nfines herbes, french fingerlings, thumbelina carrots, baby leeks & mustard jus\nThe Poulet Vert was impressive!  The presentation definitely turns heads.  The chicken was a bit smaller than it looked from the pics on yelp, but it was still good enough sized portion to satisfy me.  The chicken was perfectly roasted and the veggies and potatoes cooked in the chicken fat were pretty good as well.\n\nOverall, that was a pretty impressive dinner set you should try when you first visit Park Tavern.\n\nI visited them again one more time for dinner to celebrate my birthday.  And once again, they did not disappoint.  Although I loved everything I had the last dinner, I used this opportunity to try a bunch of different things, though we also ordered another round of the PT Fries and Smoked Deviled Eggs.\n\nBraised Pork Cheeks --  http://bit.ly/1Hw9qpZ\nfarrotto verde, shaved celery & granny smith apple salad & apple cider vinaigrette\n\nDemons On Horseback -- http://bit.ly/1x0lRsE\nlardo-wrapped smoked prawns, remoulade & cucumber\n\nSpaghetti Squash Carbonara --  http://bit.ly/1whNhoE\nbacon, garlic, parmesan & cream\n\nSeared Scallops --  http://bit.ly/1x0lTki\nbraised baby kale, peperonata, pine nuts, shichimi togarashi, finger lime & serrano ham\n\nThe one dish that surprised me the most was the Spaghetti Squash Carbonara.  It was my first time ever having Spaghetti Squash and it blew my mind how they managed to give it that pasta look and texture.  The Demons On Horseback and Scallops were pretty good too though they were very similar since both were served with some form of smoked pork.  And the Braised Pork Cheeks were very tender, flavorful, and was a great starter to share with the table.  Overall, my birthday dinner was just was delightful as the first dinner I had there.\n\nI like the style of this restaurant.  It's big, spacious, and the decor is very classy but also has a casual vibe.  The open-airness of the restaurant is nice too when the weather is warm out.  The bar is very inviting as well.  I highly recommend Park Tavern if you want to have a big dinner party, yet it's also a very good place to have a date night.

There's valet parking in the front, but it wasn't necessary since it wasn't teaming with people for some strange reason.\n\nWe ordered (Yes, this was only for 2 people..and yes, we ate it all...):\n\n1. Baked Farm Eggs - The pictures on yelp definitely won me over for this dish. I was a big fan, but it wasn't my favorite.\n\n2. Smoked Deviled Eggs - the BEST bite of brunch..maybe it was because we were famished..or maybe it was because it was just that good. I'm going to go with the latter..\n\n3. Crispy Polenta Cakes - Ben ordered this before and he really liked it, though he said this time it wasn't quite as good as he remembered. Iono about him, but I thought they were pretty effing good. Plus, you put truffle on ANYTHING and I'm already a fan. Between the Farm Eggs and Polenta Cakes -- I'd pick the polenta cakes!\n\n4. French Toast - YUM! I was so stuffed by the time the French Toast arrived, yet I managed to eat my ENTIRE half of the order we shared. Was the best I've ever had? I think Olea would give them a run for their money..but it was definitely up there!\n\n5. Avocado Toast - there is 1 piece of toast and GENEROUS slices of avocado on it - they were not shy at all. Probably not the best in value, but there sprinkle some kind of magic on the avocado toast here that I'm not sure I could ever replicate! Great to try at least once!\n\nOverall, a great place for brunch..but not necessary a place you would come for bulk and value. Happy Brunching!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

I am still thinking about those cast iron farm eggs (mmmm). Boyfriend ordered the pancakes, and savored every bite.\n\nAnd the staff, you ask? \nOur hostess was super attentive and incredibly helpful, and a huge shout out to Chef Jennifer Puccio - those deviled eggs were mouth watering (was she the woman who came out to greet our table? I wanted to say a personal thank you to her but did not get a chance).\n\nI think I can speak for all of us in our group when I say that we will continue to make Park Tavern our brunch home for the rest of our SF lives. \n\nThank you!

I wanted to choose a nice / fancy-ish place for my best friend's birthday and we have been eyeballing Park Tavern for a long time. \n\nFirst off, this place has a really nice and warm ambiance about it. The circular light fixtures with yellow bulbs, large sofa seating, large open windows, and exposed wooden structure is only part of the reason why I fell in love with the interior of this restaurant. Secondly, the service is on point. They are filling my water to the brim constantly as I am drinking it and our waiter was super funny and patient with us. (C'mon, we are three kids at a fancy-ish restaurant, you can only imagine).\n\nSo here we being with our \"fancy-ish\" meal:\n1. Jam Jelly Baguette - The baguette was extremely crunchy and chewy. The variety of jams included: cranberry, blueberry, orange and butter. The orange one was my favorite. It was the first time I've had an orange jam where it wasn't too sour nor sweet, it was right in between and it was delicious.\n\n2. Dungeonous Crab Toast - They packed a thick layer of crab on top of a lightly toasted white bread. The white bread was light and thin and crunchy on the outside, I actually didn't like how the crab overpowered the bread.\n\n3. Farm Eggs - Nice presentation. Baked with 10% eggs on top of 90% spinach. Fair taste, not too salty but couldn't taste the eggs.\n\n4. Smoked Salmon Benedict - Packed with a strong tasting salmon. Tasted like capers to me. The egg wasn't as runny as I had hoped. \n\n5. Cod Sandwich - Perfectly cooked. Seasoned marvelously. Smelled amazing.  Amazing potato chunks. Delicious. \n\nI would have to say that the food did not impress me. Everything somehow came out to be too salty or not salty enough. I felt like the food was way overpriced for what it is. But the service was amazing and the ambiance is beyond comfortable. Maybe the dinner option might have a better chance of winning me over.", "author": "Linda K."}

Although the restaurant is quite large, my wife and I were seated in a corner which felt more intimate than the size led on. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and the waiter made sure that her special night was memorable. The waiter started the night by bringing two glasses of some delicious champagne. Being that we always study menus prior to arriving, we knew exactly what we wanted when the waiter returned to take our order.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the the waygu beef jerky, and the PT fries. I don't normally eat beef jerky and probably wouldn't eat any gas station jerky but this beef jerky was delicious. Tender, chewy and salted just right, we couldn't help ourselves but finish every last piece. The PT fries were simply OUTRAGEOUS! OMG! Each bite was better than the last and I honestly wished we ordered 3 more orders of these fries. Park Tavern also supplies a basket of bread which we surprisingly didn't each too much of because we were obsessed over the fries and jerky. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Poulet Noir. All I can say is that that chicken might have been some of the best chicken I have eaten in my entire life. It was life-changing. A whole roasted bird, slow cooked in truffle butter. Does it get much better than that?? I really don't think so. Plus, the chicken comes with this amazing stuffing that is covered in chicken au jus. My wife raved about her Sole, and the meal was just perfect. \n\nWe had our heart set on ordering the cookie sandwich dessert but simply couldn't eat any more food. The waiter then surprised us with a birthday dessert of their lemon cake. Not the biggest lemon cake fan, but the dessert was good in its own right. I can't rave about Park Tavern enough. They went out of their way to make my wife's birthday extra special. 100% coming back here whenever we return to San Fran. The service and the food were impeccable!

I believe that Park Tavern is run by the same people as Marlowe.\n\nThis place is pretty live and the decor is very nice. It's super dark in the restaurant which is only a downside for me since I have to keep flashing every time I take a picture of the delicious food...\n\nFirst things first, GET THE PT FRIES. As I get older, I stop craving unhealthy foods now like chips, sodas, but especially fries. But these fries are so good, I don't even feel ashamed after I eat them. They come with a soft cooked egg topped with caviar and truffle sauce. I can't even put into words how this combination tastes. You just have to order it.\n\nBoth times I came here, my friend and I shared a Poulet Noir, which I believe is the best item on the menu. It's a whole roasted chicken topped off with this delicious thin brown sauce. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and the meat is just so tender. The menu changes here, so the first time we had it, there were beets and other mouth watering vegetables that came with it. The second time, we had this amazing root vegetable stuffing. Honestly, I can't even say which one was better because it's just so hard! This is a must order.\n\nI've also tried the Pan Seared Red Snapper, which was excellent. It came with black and white risotto, which was interesting and it was what really made the dish good. The brussel sprouts are a good side dish to get also. I would skip the Beef Tartare and the Marlowe Burger, which I didn't find that great. We also tried the Pumpkin Bread Pudding, which was I enjoyed except I wish it came out hot fresh out the oven.\n\nThe service is top notch.

They take reservations but we didn't get one in time and was hoping to be seated upon arrival. When the restaurant opened, the host was very efficient in getting the line in the door quickly, whether they had a reservation or not.\n\nWe choose to sit at the bar over the community table and had a great experience. Service was quick and everyone else around us also seemed to be happy with their food.\n\nFood:\n- Smoked Salmon Benedict:This was delicious! The horseradish sauce on it paired well with the smoked salmon and all the flavors worked excellently together. The only thing I'll say is, if you are famished, this might not be enough for you. It's nothing fancy; it's exactly what is on the menu, so I was satisfied.\n- Chorizo & Eggs: I only had a bite of this, but if I was looking for a scramble, this is what I'd get next time. It was a generous serving and had great flavors as well; oftentimes, the egg is overpowered by everything else in the scramble, but this seemed well balanced.\n\nAmbiance: \n- After ordering my food, I found myself looking around the restaurant for a few minutes. The environment (especially during the holiday season!) felt very warm and cozy. It wasn't too loud in the room either, even with many people around us.\n- I would suggest sitting at the communal table or the bar for an intimate experience (the communal table made it easy to talk intimately across from one another), if you don't mind having people on both sides of you. There is also some side-by-side seating by the chefs, looking at the open kitchen. Otherwise, there are more formal tables in the larger room of the restaurant that looked good as well.\n\nSo far, this is my favorite of the Weinberg restaurants (I've been to Marlowe and the Cavalier).

The polenta is incredibly savory, crispy and seasoned perfectly (as opposed to most polenta, which is typically served bland and mushy, at least in America). Each polenta cake is topped with a perfectly poached egg - clearly made in a sauce pan instead of an egg poaching machine, with that perfect runny consistency even though it's completely done cooking by the time it gets to you. The arugula and parmesan salad it comes with (excellent, real, shaved, parmesan mind you) was the perfect complement to the poached eggs and polenta. \n\nThis is literally the perfect breakfast. It cannot be made any better. On my death bed, I would like a bottomless feed bag full of this exact dish surgically attached to my mouth hole, so I can eat this exact meal to death.

Not my fav since it was so light, but it had a refreshing quality to it.\n\nPT old fashioned: Old overholt rye, cherry, bitters ($12)\nMy favorite cocktail of the night!

The bacon, jalapeno and chive just elevated the eggs. If I were coming back for a snack at the bar, I'd come back for this! Sooo good!\n\nPT fries: truffle, soft cooked egg, caviar ($14)\nOmg! These were amazing! Probably one of the best versions of truffle fries that I've had. The fries were crispy but soft in the center. And dipped in the egg and caviar or truffle dip?! I was in heaven!\n\nWagyu beef jerky ($7)\nI didn't care for this. I typically like my beef jerky softer, so this wasn't my fav.\n\nBraised lamb tongue: french fingerling potatoes, mustard greens, soft cooked hen egg & horseradish ($14)\nI picked this dish since I love tongue!

Everything on the plate had a rather mushy texture.\n\nGrass fed ribeye: potato puree, baby carrots, cipollinis, blue lake beans, arugula & chimichurri ($38)\nThe steak was cooked perfectly!\n\nPoulet vert: fines herbs, french fingerlings, thumbelina carrots, baby leeks & mustard jus ($29)\nThis was as beautiful as it was delicious! The hen was super moist and juicy! I was actually expecting the hen to be larger, but it's a good size for one or for sharing. \n\nVenison carpaccio: classic angus beef tartare, capers & crispy bone marrow ($18)\nThe tartare was excellent! We got this a little later so I only took a bite. I didn't realize there was crispy bone marrow until after dinner when I was looking over the menu! So bummed since I didn't try the fried marrow! \n\nThe rest of the dishes I don't recall too well. A few drinks and lots of coursed plates can do that to me from time to time, but we also got:\n-Grilled pork chop: cranberry bean & sweet pepper ragout, preserved tomato, red mustard & peppadew ($27)\n-Wood oven roasted beets: agrodolce goat cheese & breadcrumbs ($8)\n-Brown butter brussels sprouts: parmesan & chili flakes ($8)\n\nSince it was Bobby's birthday and we were celebrating, our server gave us a free dessert!

The July's birthday cake ($9) with James vanilla & strawberry creme cake, mixed berry compote & cream cheese frosting was light and fluffy and not too sweet. The Tcho chocolate creme brulee ($8) with chocolate biscotti, chili, lemon zest & sea salt wasn't really my cup of tea since it mixed sweet and salty, but everyone else loved it!\n\nAfter the meal, we were all talking about how great the Deviled eggs and PT fries were. Everyone loved them! I'd definitely come back just for those dishes! Add the Poulet vert and that may just be the perfect meal!", "author": "Elena N."}

Our waiter had to have been one of the rudest, snobbiest people I have encountered in the customer service industry. One member of our party asked him what types of coffee was served. This apparently was a dumb question as he replied, \"Excuse me? What do you MEAN what kind of coffee??\" We also inquired on what type of chorizo (Spanish or Mexican style) was in the chorizo & egg scramble and, again, we were met with attitude. He did not offer to ask the chef and instead acted as if we had no idea what we were talking about. His tone was so dismissive and borderline condescending.\n\nFortunately the food came pretty quickly. I got the cast iron baked eggs with gruyere cheese and jamon serrano (thinly sliced ham). It was delicious but there was a little too much spinach and not enough egg. The jamon was also measly. Another member got the pancakes which were HUGE - stack of 3, each the size of a large plate... but they were just pancakes. \n\nAll in all, not too impressed. I'm sure there are better places in the area for brunch, or maybe my experience was just overshadowed by our sassy waiter.", "author": "Margaret Z."}

We ordered a couple of cocktails - like Park Tavern's sister restaurants, most of the cocktails sounded and tasted delicious. I also love how the house coffee comes in a Le Creuset mug. \n\nWe ordered the Huckleberry fritters to start and they were so delicious! They were piping hot when they made it to our table and perfectly crispy on the outside while nice and dense on the insides. For entrees we opted for the Corned Beef Hash, Shrimp and Grits, French Toast, and Polenta Cakes. Everything was delicious, I love the crispiness of my polenta cakes with the runny egg, the shrimp and grits was a bit too heavy for my taste, but still impressive. \n\nService was great throughout our meal, the only thing that bothered me was the spacing of the tables, it seemed like they really tried to squeeze as many seats as possible into the seating area, and it made it uncomfortable to slide in and out of the booths and walk in the restaurant to use the restroom, etc.", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

Pricey but so worth it because the flavors are complex and adventurous...sometimes subtle but still rich in flavor. The deviled eggs had an higher yolk to white ratio than usual which is one of the reasons I loved it. It was topped with jalapenos and bacon, so it was not only well seasoned but also had a kick. Never had smoke prawns before and they were delicious. Well balanced with cucumber and avocado. The sea bass was poached with unique mushrooms and delicately seasoned. Only minor issue was the chicken satay which was little bland and under cooked. Look forward to returning and trying the brunch.

Service was top notch and the food was exquisite. \n\nMy boyfriend had never been here before so I thought this would be a great spot for a special evening. I made a table reservation for us via OpenTable and added in the notes that we wanted to be seated near the windows in front if possible. First, I had to call last minute and request that the reservation be increased from 2 to 4 people which they were able to accommodate.  When we were seated, we were not able to be sat near the window so they brought each of us a glass of sparkling wine to make up for it. They also asked about our anniversary which was very kind. \n\nWe started with the brussel sprout chips and deviled eggs. Both were very good starters but the chips were pretty greasy but but were also really tasty.\n\nFor the mains - We ordered 2 salmons, the bar steak and a salad nicoise. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was on top of a sort of creamed corn. Absolutely divine. The steak was also cooked perfectly medium rare, very juicy and tender. Everything was scrumptious!\n\nFor dessert we ordered the pumpkin spice cake which they brought out with a candle, which again was very sweet of them. the cake was moist and delectable.\n\nI will continue to go back to Park Tavern and will recommend it to all my friends.

Finished our drinks.  The entree arrives.  I am surprised and ask the wait staff what happened to the appetizers.  As I am speaking the appetizers arrive.  Try to put all the serving dishes on a very small table.  Decide to start with the entrees so the food doesn't get cold.  My steak knife won't cut the meat. The serrated edge is worn down smooth. My dinner knife won't cut the steak.   Ask the wait staff for another knife.  Wait.  She returns.  First substitute knife is as dull as the first.  I ask for another.  3rd knife is the charm.  Waiter comes and says I am so sorry about this (all the food arriving at once). I'll bring a complimentary drink.  We say ok.  Food is excellent.

Given I had just completed the San Francisco Half Marathon that morning, I was not going to wait long to refuel this temple of mine, and so we had to quickly look for an alternative in the area. There was no visible line at Park Tavern so this is where we ended up! If you're familiar with the North Beach square then it goes without saying that Parking is a nightmare! Park Tavern offers valet parking for $12 ($15 if you're a good citizen and tip the valet) and though paying for parking may result in one less mimosa afforded, it sure saves you a good 30 minutes and a headache of circling to look for a space... and the follow on tight parallel parking you will endure otherwise. \n\nWell the absence of a visible line fooled us! It was still a 25 minute wait to be seated. However, we learned they do take reservations (something to consider if heading in around brunch time). Thank goodness for the other post SF Marathon finishers eating there as well, otherwise I would have felt like a slob entering in running clothes and a baseball cap :/ It is an upscale establishment, large seating area and every table full with good looking and well dressed brunchers... clearly lots of dates going on. \n\nOur server was outstanding... on top of our table, friendly, and humored us with the all the food we ordered. \n\nMind you, this was 2 people eating at a table fit for 2 plates: \n\nDeviled Egg: SO GOOD! I've never had a deviled egg with bacon on it. Genius idea! A small sliver of jalape\u00f1o to add just enough kick. One order is actually half of an egg... keep that in mind if sharing. \n\nChallah Toast: Should be a dessert but we ate it before our meal. Thick Texas toast covered in butter, cinnamon, and sugar. Who doesn't love Challah toast? While it was yummy, it doesn't compare to Trouble Coffee's challah. I thought it could've used a dash more of everything, but I wouldn't hesitate to eat it again should it arrive in front of me. \n\nSmoked Salmon Benedict: A larger than usual benedict, served over focaccia rather than an English Muffin. PT was not stingy with the smoked salmon either! Capers added just enough to the overall taste and the eggs were cooked perfectly! There are no sides to this dish - it is solely the benedict. Keep that in mind as its unusual to eat benedict without potatoes or some other side dish. It was large enough that you don't need a side in my opinion. \n\nCorned Beef Hash: Per my brunch date, the dish was very good. He felt like he was chewing on real meat as opposed to hash out of a can. The kale was a nice add to the dish. \n\nCherry French Toast: What a great way to end a brunch - with the warm, soft, chewy, sweetness of the PT French Toast. Cherries, syrup, mascarpone cheese... a delight for your tastebuds! \n\nClassic mimosa: No brunch is done justly without a mimosa. A perfect ratio of sparkling wine to OJ... it's the simple things in life :)", "author": "Krystal A."}

I was hesitant though since I didn't want to draw more attention to use, since both of us couldn't help but notice that our waitress was stunning.\n\nAnd you know me, around stunning women, I turn into a mime. Silent. Nervous. Stumbling around.

It also tasted like canned crab, though I'm sure it's not (or at least I hope it's not for $16).\n\nThe corned beef hash was hearty and flavorful, but I would have liked less arugula. It's not a salad after all. And the burger was surprisingly good too. James couldn't stop raving about the aioli. He could have cared less about the burger, he just wanted the aioli with fries. He's easy to please that way.\n\nThe waitress (who I won't embarrass by writing her name) was a good waitress and split the burger and fries for us so that we could share the dishes.\n\nMy only complaint was the crab toast, fritters, and 53 minute wait to get our burger and hash. Luckily, she was so gorgeous that I almost forgot the time (notice I said almost), cause it took forever to get our food.

Who wants to wait in line for an hour to eat, right? That said, as I've been on something of a brunch kick lately, and after hearing so many great things about Park Tavern, especially the drinks, my girlfriend and I decided to grab a late brunch here. Luckily, as it was around 1 pm, there was no wait for seating at the communal dining table.\n\nWe did had to wait a bit longer than I would have liked to get our food orders taken, but our server was extremely apologetic and the rest of our dining experience was first rate. When my girlfriend, who doesn't like walnuts, decided to take a chance on the oatmeal walnut raisin pancakes and didn't like them, our server happily offered to take the item off the bill and allowed her to order something else.\n\nNow onto the important stuff: the food here was amazing! The smoked deviled eggs were quite tasty and the avocado toast may just have been the best take on the dish that I've had the pleasure of trying. The highlight of my meal, though, was the shrimp and grits! The seasoning of the shrimp here was quite unique; add to that some well-prepared grits and you get the makings of an absolutely delicious meal!  \n\nI paired all this food with the Double Issac, a tequilla-based cocktail, which was very refreshing. My girlfriend got the boozy smoothie that combines bourbon, banana, espresso and vanilla ice cream.

We ordered the buttermilk pancakes, 4 deviled eggs, the huckleberry fritters, the salmon benedict, the corned hash, the polenta cakes, and the farmed eggs. \n\n1: the deviled eggs are as great as they are hyped up to be.\n2. the huckleberry fritters were crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, with huckleberry and cream dipping sauces.\n3. the buttermilk pancakes were ok.\n4. the salmon benedict was a bit on the salty side, but very filling.\n5. the hash was good and flavorful.\n6. the polenta cakes were surprisingly refreshing with a slightly crisp bottom. they came with a bed of mushrooms which made the whole dish amazing.\n7. the farmed eggs were ok.\n\nSince it was a birthday thing for 2 in the group, our server gave us a chocolate cheesecake and an angel food cake slice on the house! \n\nI was extremely full and satisfied with everything from food to service to presentation and everything in between. I can't wait to try their dinner next time!", "author": "Pamela B."}

I had found this deliciously fruity drink named Washington Square Park. I probably had 3 of those that night and had a great time with my coworkers. \n\n\nI ended up coming back with a friend when we were looking for restaurants between Pier 39 and Union Square. After all we needed to grab food between the end of her class and before our play\n\nI ended up ordering the same drink as I had loved it the last time and we also got some food. The brussel sprouts with some parmesan cheese was delicious! Also (on the list) the deviled eggs were not truly traditional devlied eggs with just some paprika on top, but there was some awesome toppings (bacon, jalapenos, and chives). Delicious! We also ordered the demons on horseback, which made our dinner very hell-ish (with the devils and demons). Anyways, the demons on horseback was lardo wrapped smoked prawns with this amazing sauce. Definitely recommend. \n\nThese dishes were enough for the 2 of us for a light dinner before the play. Honestly, I would definitely go back and try some of the other things. \n\nProtip: call and see if they have any reservations. I probably made the reservations for 2 a few hours ahead of time and we were seated at the bar on the side - it was so cool to watch the chefs plate and it was a lot of fun. Food is amazing!", "author": "Nina Y."}

It was a whole chicken.  The twice baked potatoes were yummy and the eaters of the steak and other dishes were all happy with their selections.  It was very crowded and very busy.  They put a lot of people in a small space and you end up sitting very close to your neighbors.  We were fortunate that the folks at the tables next to us were all friendly and enjoyable.  \n\nI have to say one of the most impressive parts of this meal was that when our drinks were delivered by a different person than the one that took the order, they delivered the correct drinks to the correct people and they did that twice.  This seems to be something that most other restaurants don't really care about and it is something we noticed right away.  \n\nI can see how this restaurant is good for a lot of different situations, dates, business meals, friends, celebrations.

We walked in around 1030 and was told that most of the dining room had already been  reserved but there was some opening seating still available in the bar area. Which was just fine. My girlfriend ordered a mimosa and i stole a sip. Tasted great. She also ordered a grapefruit mimosa which i actually liked even more. We both ordered The Buttermilk Pancakes and they were delicious! Nice and fluffy the way pancakes should be. They were big too so two of them was plenty of food. Im glad we found this place. We will definitely be back! :)", "author": "Joshua H."}

Had an early 5:30 reservation for dinner, but there was a party going on at the bar so we didn't feel too lonely being early birds.\n\nLoved the ambiance and atmosphere.  Friendly attentive staff.  They had a great selection of cocktails so I started the evening with Mary Etta's Bubbles which had framboise and lemon twist in it.  Very flavorful....my kind of drink!  \n\nFor starters, we had their famous Smoked Deviled Eggs which came with bacon, chives, and pickled jalape\u00f1os.  You can order as many as you want as they sell them by the piece.  I loved the smoky taste of the bacon with the egg.  I could have probably eaten another.  Went well with the Acme bread that you get.\n\nWe also tried their famous Demons on Horseback which are lardo-wrapped smoked prawns with some remoulade and cucumbers.  It had a nice kick to it and the prawns were cooked perfectly that it was fresh and juicy.  YUM!  \n\nAfter the cocktail, I wanted a glass of wine with my dinner.  I was happy to see they had grenache so I ordered that.  It's not very often that the wine glass list consists of various regional wines.  \n\nFor dinner, I had the Roasted Sea Bass which came with fennel and baby artichokes.  My husband had the C.A.B. NY Steak which came with braised Kobe beef and marrow-stuffed bone with potatoes and broccolini.  We both enjoyed our dishes that we left nothing behind.  After all the great food we had, we decided to try their dessert as well.  The only thing the stood out for me was the Tcho Chocolate Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.

More personable would have been better.\n\nEntree - 4, all the food was on the salty side, which took a little away from the food. However, high quality ingredients, decent menu selection.  Unfortunately, they were out of duck.  Mussels were cooked perfectly and large portion, but the tomato broth was disappointingly bland.  Pork chops and salmon looked good.\n\nDessert - 4, apple crisp was delicious and generous portion with Fuji apples and ice cream.  Tcho chocolate Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was bad.  Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was never meant to have chocolate.  It was more like a mousse.  Don't call it something it's not.\n\nAppetizers - 2, burnt Brussels sprout leaves as an appetizer, interesting concept.  Sliced lemon chips, interesting.  They get too fancy for their own good.  However, I will give them a 2 because the venison carpaccio was excellent.  Smooth, fresh, and tasty.\n\nLocation - 4, nice location at Washington Park in North Beach.\n\nPrice - 3, entrees were fair priced.  Appetizers were either overpriced or overrated.  Desserts were fair priced.\n\nOverall, I would give it a 3.5.  Would I go again?  Only for the location since it is a block away from a relative.

Unfortunately, the bar steak was very disappointing- very small portion and overcooked. Chocolate cheesecake was bad-not like a cheesecake at all. Very dry and flavorless. Birthday cake this month is carrot cake and it was delicious! \n\nCorkage is only $15 so you may be better off bringing your own wine. Their glasses are small so you end up 3 just to equal a normal two. This drives up the meal price.\n\nOverall, really fun place, good service and uneven food.", "author": "Alyssa C."}

I came in with a small bachelorette party of about 6 ladies (we weren't a rowdy bunch, just out to get breakfast!) and the Maid of Honor had called ahead to make a reservation. We waited about 20 minutes past our reservation time while they seated walk-in groups (not awesome), and with some prodding, they finally seated us.\n\nThey, thankfully, realized that they had kept us waiting and MORE than made it up to us with some amazing deviled eggs and delicious pastries, brought to us as soon as we sat down. I don't even like deviled eggs... but these looked so good, I had to try one and OMG what have I been missing all of my life?! They were AMAZING! We ordered several appetizers and some fantastic bloody marys, and none of it disappointed. The horseradish in the bloody was new for me, but gave it a great spicy kick! The avocado toast was to -die- for, and the cinnamon challah literally melts in your mouth. (So. So. Good!!!!) \n\nI had the chorizo and egg scramble, and it was unbelievable! (Then again, there was nothing on our table that didn't look like it rolled out of a gourmet kitchen - which apparently, it did!)

We did eventually eat there, as well, check out the review if you want (not good).\n\nOur breakfast was excellent. We shared the Pomelo & Avocado w/cottage cheese & cracked black pepper. After a couple of mimosa's, I ordered the Crispy Polenta Cakes (wild mushrooms, poached eggs, arugula, truffle salsa verde & shaved parmesan) and J ordered the Pan-Fried Corned Beef Hash (crispy potato, poached egg, arugula & red wine jus). Excellent brunch.\n\nA few days later, J and I returned with N for dinner. We intended to go to Tony's , but forgot they he's closed on Tuesday. Since we had such a nice brunch at Park Tavern, and it was just a block away, we stepped into the bar. There were not any seats available at the communal bar table so we waited.

If anything the bone marrow was a little to heavy on the garlicky side but that didn't stop me.\nEverything from there was poorly executed. Don't know if the kitchen was understaffed or what but that night their game was way off on the entrees.\nHalibut was very fishy, not sure how old it was but this should not have been used. Halibut should not have a heavy fish flavor. The duck breast ordered medium was medium rare to rare. It was very flavorful. The accompanying polenta described on the menu as creamy was luke warm and was most likely the last of the pan as it was a little lumpy. It like the halibut should not have been used. The \"signature\" Marlowe burger ordered medium was medium rare ar best.  \nWe finished with a ginger cheesecake. A nice light flavor. Texture was not what I expected from a cheesecake. Heavy, thick, and pastey in the mouth.

That's how brunch should be eaten.\n\nThe drinks are totally on point. Let's face it, if you're not drinking at brunch, then you're doing it wrong ... that's just having breakfast late. They have a John Daly, which is a boozy iced tea that I can (and do) drink 3-4 of. Guess how good that makes me feel? Totally sets me up for Sunday funday.\n\nFinally, the food is very good. I've had the Smoked Salmon Benedict; perfectly poached eggs (not easy to do and most places leave the white a little runny, which I hate) on top of a thin layer of smoked salmon, red onions, cream cheese, and toast. Damn good. The Crispy Polenta cakes are a close second. If you love umami, this bad boy has mushrooms, truffle oil and arugula! Finally, don't forget to grab an Avocado Toast as a starter.

The food is pretty solid overall with a few real standout items.  Love the extensive mixology cocktail list and love that mixology has become the norm so no one actually calls it mixology anymore.  \n\nSmoked Deviled Eggs: Way better than the traditional version your aunt would make at a family picnic.  These had what seemed like a triple dose of creamy yolk filling and were topped with a nice hunk of crispy bacon.  There was also a pickled jalape\u00f1o hiding under the bacon for a mild kick.\n\nSmoked Lemon Chips: These sounded more interesting than they actually were.  I was really looking forward to the creamy burrata pile, but the fried lemon chip was so intense that it overpowered the subtlety of the cheese.  Not really my thing.\n\nBrussels Sprout Chips: Individual leaves of Brussels Sprouts that were deep friend.  AMAZING!  Far superior to the slimy boiled Brussels Sprouts that germinate disdain in one's youth.   Of course, serving deep fried vegetables to kids probably wouldn't have been good parenting move either.  As an adult, definitely worth the snacking!\n\nClam Chowder: Having grown up in New England, I'm a bit finicky.  This was definitely better than chowder from a can or served at chains (e.g. Boudin).  However, the broth focused more on cream than complexity.  Also, the clam chunks were a bit too small for my tastes.  And, hello, where were the crackers... I feel like homemade artisanal crackers would have totally fit the vibe here.\n\nPoulet Noir: Judging by all the Yelp photos, this seems to be the signature dish.  A super tasty lacquered glaze made the chicken burst with umami.  The black truffle au jus helped intensify it even more (just wish there was more of the au jus).  The swiss chard was a bit disappointing though; soggy and tasteless.\n\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: Technically it fit the bill with a crispy burnt sugar layer and creamy filling.  The seasonal flavor didn't do much for me though.\n\nBirthday Cake: I love the concept of having birthday cake as a regular dessert!  But actually, this tasted more like wedding cake to me than birthday cake.  Nice layers of citrus and stone fruit jam between fluffy sheets of cake.  The frosting was like a vanilla fondant, hence the reminder of weddings.", "author": "Adam B."}

Park Tavern is the perfect place for special events.  \n\nWe came here during the holidays so the handsome dining room felt extra festive. With fantastic service from our waiter and good timing of dishes from the kitchen, we were able to relax and savor every moment.\n\nThe brussel sprout chips and deviled eggs with bacon & pickled jalapenos are house favorites for a reason: just right blend of texture and seasonings, these will disappear faster than you can say \"feed me!\" My grass fed ribeye was a generous serving, done medium rare as requested, with tender baby carrots and buttery mashed potatoes. Your dining experience would be remiss if you skipped on the signature PT fries, these potato sticks are so posh, you would need a pedigree in eating them. Truffle, soft boiled egg and caviar as your accompaniments, the best thing to do is to dip the crunchy fries into the soft boiled egg and eat away. Oh. My. GOD. (wait, was that really $14?!?) \n\nI was at my favorite speakeasy before heading here so I wasn't impressed with the cocktails even though they were 17 cocktails deep on the menu. The Maclaren with Hendrick's gin, cucumber, lemon and ginger beer was refreshing, but also overpriced at $13.\n\nNevertheless, I left with a the warm and fuzzies here.

When addressed he said that he thought we were leaving.. once this happened the staff jumped at the opportunity to make our stay as comfortable as possible.

I haven't ventured much into North Beach, so that was also a plus. Park Tavern is in a beautiful neighborhood that intersects Chinatown and Little Italy near a park, and the vibe is very family friendly. \n\nPark Tavern is definitely a reservation must place on weekends as it was packed when we visited. It has a slightly bougie atmosphere with a large space decorated by dark wood furnishings. It reminded me of a high end seafood restaurant that I used to go to in Utah. \n\nAfter being seated, the server was friendly and gave us recommendations on brunch cocktails. I ordered a hummingbird, which was amazing, also because I love St. Germaine. My friend and I then shared avocado toast with chile, lemon, and sea salt along with the French toast with cherries and mascarpone and cod cake. After eating the entrees I decided I will come back. The French toast tasted sweet and creamy but not too sugary. It did not have that fake sweetness that always comes with fruit compotes. The avocado toast was perfect; the zesty lemon and little bit of chile made it have a small kick, which made it refreshing. Lastly, the cod cake was unique as I had never had cod cake anywhere. It was soft and the stronger taste balanced the light salad that it came served with. \n\nI don't have anything negative to say about Park Tavern and recommend it for brunch. I will be taking lots of friends here in the future.", "author": "Annie C."}

Well, attempted to at least. \n\nMy boyfriend made reservations a month in advance. We both looked at the menu online and were surprised to find no pre fixe menu, as most restaurants I had been scoping out for other dinners leading up to Valentine's had all posted a pre fixe menu online. It seemed Park Tavern wasn't offering a pre fixe menu, which was great because I was excited to try the regular menu. Someone from the restaurant called the day of our reservation to confirm and again, no mention of a pre fixe menu.\n\nWe get to the restaurant and are seated at a table that is technically in the dining area, but is really about a foot away from the bar and in a weird arched corner with strange lighting. I felt like the hunchback of Notre Dame. We'd made these reservations so early there really was no reason for such a terrible table.\n\nOnce we're seated on the island of castaways we're handed a menu. A pre fixe menu! More specifically, an $85/per person pre fixe menu. They are not offering their regular menu that night at all. After not posting this online or having their host let us know when confirming over the phone we are now stuck with $85/pp menu. We got up, walked over to Original Joe's and had a great night sitting in their bar area with excellent service. I also wrote the restaurant to let them know before posting this review and never heard anything back. I'll take my business to Original Joe's from now on.", "author": "Erica G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-14", "description": "My guy friend told me this place was absolutely amazing and the food was the best he ever had, so I had very high expectations when we arrived. The place itself reminded me of a few restaurants I had been in Chicago, very 50s-60s feel, trendy, young ambiance. We were seated right away and I started with a Cruel Summer cocktail, which was tasty. More so a summer drink then anything else, but still good. \n\nSince I arrived late, as soon as I sat,  smoked deviled eggs were placed on the table. I don't eat them, but as far as deviled eggs go. they did look pretty tasty. We also ordered the PT fries, which were truffle fries and came with 2 dipping sauces, truffle & soft cooked egg with caviar. It was an interesting combination of flavors. The fries were pretty tasty. The demons on horseback app was interesting, the shrimp was good, I just didn't love how they added a ton of meat and fat onto everything we ordered. I honestly felt gross after leaving this place, too many super fatty foods and so much meat! \n\nAnyway, I ordered the scallops for dinner and was told they ran out. That really annoyed me because they have all of 8 entree items, 4 of them non-meat, and I don't eat meat, so I was left with 3 options. and the other options didn't really excite me. I ended up with the wild atlantic cod, which in my opinion, was lackluster at best. The cod itself was okay, nothing special, and it was paired with a ton of vegetables including mushrooms, onions, fennel, and some other greens. The sauce itself was kinda bland, and overall the dish did nothing for me, I barely ate it. As a side dish I got the brown butter brussel sprouts which were tasty. I also tried a bit of my friend's butternut squash made 'au gratin', like everything else on the menu...super heavy and fattening. Not really my style. \n\nFor dessert, we got the birthday cake, which came with a candle, that was a little little touch. The cake was okay, white cake with white icing. Nothing out of the ordinary there. We also ordered the ice cream sandwiches, which I really liked. The gingersnap cookies gave it a unique touch and the caramel ice cream was delicious.\n\nMaybe since I came in with such high expectations, I left feeling disappointed. I thought the  menu was very limited, the food was okay at best, the service was decent and the ambiance was nice, but I've been to a lot better. The meat dishes looked pretty good. Maybe if you're a huge meat eater, you'll enjoy this place more than I did.", "author": "Shannon W."}

I am neither, but have been eating solo since the 1970s, when traveling the South Island of New Zealand on my own.  Thanks to my parents, and etiquette class at Marymount Ecole on Fifth Avenue in NYC, I have no problem eating alone in the finest restaurants, Chez Panisse, for example, where the maitre d' gave me a tour of their impressively immaculate kitchen.  But restaurants are not always welcoming to solo diners and this is one of the worst.  \n\nWhen I visit the city named after my fave saint, and now fave pope, I stay at the inn right next door to this joint.  Once I got in late and just wanted something to eat.  It was past their crush time.  I got seated, but never got a menu or even a greeting from a server.  I eventually left.  The second time I attempted to just have a drink at the bar.  The bartender passed me by many times until I finally left and found a corner liquor store.  I'm not about to wave down a server or bartender like in a Waffle House or something.  The service is probably more attentive there.  \n\nLastly, once while attempting to load my car with my bags, the restaurant's valet got all bent out of shape because I parked in front of the inn while the restaurant was was using street parking for its valet service.

So I made another reservation for a Sunday evening to make up for my indiscretions (with an emphasis on the \"s\" at the end of indiscretions).  And so it goes.  \n\nWe arrived right on time for our reservation at 7:15 p.m. and were promptly seated.  My companion didn't like the table, however, and we were promptly re-seated with no questions asked.  In the interest of brevity, I will only note the highlights, as follows.  \n\nWe settled in and got down to business.  We started with two cocktails - the McLaren and the Aquatic Park.  We also ordered two appetizers: (1) the deviled eggs; and (2) the Demon on Horseback (shrimp).  Both were scrumptious, but boy, those deviled eggs were something to write home about -- do you hear me?  Those flavors were WORKING: Pickled jalapeno, bacon and chive?  YES, YES and YES.  \n\nI also want to note right out of the gates that the bread and butter were yummy.  I love when all of the small details are attended to.  \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Marlowe Burger, medium.  The burger was served with caramelized onion, cheddar, bacon and horseradish aioli (plus fries).  So, let's discuss the bacon. I don't care how trendy it is or is not, I frakking LOVE bacon.  But this bacon was pretty special because it was cooked so perfectly--crisp, but not crumbly.  When you took a bite of the sandwich, the bacon remained in tact on the rest of the sandwich, which I frequently find to be the hallmark of finely cooked fare (I am insane about this with onion rings as well - if I take a bite out of an onion ring and the onion comes out of the ring on that bite, it was not cooked properly, in my humble opinion).  \n\nFor dessert, we had a piece of \"September's Birthday Cake,\" which is champagne chiffon cake, pears and mascarpone cheese.  Oh heavens, I could be very satisfied with a piece of that cake every evening. I didn't get any cake on my birthday - so I feel entitled to go back and have another piece. The whole reason for birthdays is cake, after all.  \n\nOur server was lovely, attentive and pleasant. I think the evening was pretty successful overall.

Very cutting edge culinary creations but with tastes that everyone can enjoy.  \n\nWe had an amazing waiter that gave us some wonderful recommendations.  We told him we wanted a sampling of the best small plates/appetizers they serve and just said \"yes\" to whatever he suggested.  \n\nHere is what we ended up getting:\n\n*Smoked Deviled Eggs - best deviled egg I've tried, and I LOVE deviled eggs.  Comes with bacon and a pickled jalape\u00f1o slice on top.\n\n*PT Fries covered in garlic and served with two dips - a soft cooked egg topped with caviar and truffle aioli - there also must be crack in this because I could not stop myself.  The flavors are so unique and I recommend dipping the fry in aioli, followed by the soft cooked egg before eating.  Warning - your breath will be offensive for a few days.\n\n*Crispy Lemon Chips with burrata cheese - another unique taste that I could not get enough of.  The lemons are thinly sliced, dipped in rice flower and flash fried.  Then you have the soft and salty burrata cheese to spread on top.... oh my goodness.  Please order this.\n\n*Demons on Horseback - prawns wrapped in lardo and covered with a creamy remoulade sauce.  Another OMG dish.\n\n*Brussels Sprout Chips - these were OK but a little too oily. \n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. Everything we tried was delicious and the entire experience was enjoyable.", "author": "Whit C."}

Came here with my family who were visiting from out of town because of all of the great reviews we've heard about this place. The atmosphere was cool (with the exception of a couple on an awkward tinder date who were making out for 45 mins), but the food was pretty bad.\nWe ordered the deviled eggs ($3/egg), have made better tasting ones at home. The Brussels sprouts were soaked in vinegar and salt, and were pretty bad. 3 people ordered the bar steak and all of them were overcooked flavorless cuts of meat. All 3 people returned the steaks, as our waitress even acknowledged that they looked overlooked! We were not charged for the steaks, however they charged us each for our replacement dishes (the burger is actually pretty good, but the fries taste like they are from mcdonalds). I won't be back, and for the money we spent, we could have had a nice dinner at just about any other restaurant in SF.", "author": "Andy Y."}

The atmosphere is trendy and spacious, perfect for a date or a small group. Must eats - deviled eggs, marlowe burger, short ribs. Must drink their cocktails, everything is amazing and reminds me of the mixology at Beretta or Locanda. \n\n* BREAD: Tasted like Acme - always a good thing :)\n\n* DEVILED EGGS ($2 / half egg): Topped with a crispy, thin slice of bacon, and made with pickled jalapeno and chives. Wow, I did not know deviled eggs could be so delicious! \n\n* TRUFFLED FONDUE with torn bread ($14): This was an interesting dish, with a hint of truffle which you could smell more than taste. $14 for a small-ish bowl of cheese and a side of torn up bread seems steep.\n\n* MARLOWE BURGER ($14): Wow, delicious and juicy I can see why people rave about it! It seems so simple - carmelized onion, cheddar and bacon, but it was so delicious. Comes with fries and horseradish sauce on the side.\n\n* POULET NOIR ($28): This is a whole chicken, incredibly flavorful down to the core. I just wish it was a little more tender and that they used a bigger chicken. Still prefer Zuni, for overall flavor and juiciness, but this was really good.\n\n* BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS ($24): Every component of this dish was so perfect, and tasted very soulful. I could eat this every day.\n\n* SIDE BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($8): Too bitter on the inside, yet overcooked with too much butter. Pass.\n\n* HARBISON CHEESE: Soft, white cows milk cheese. I never order the cheese course because it's too extravagant, but this was a winner and I'm glad I got it. The cheese was soft and paired perfectly with cab. Awesome cab.\n\n* PANNA COTTA ($7): I'm picky with my panna cotta and like when it's uber thick and creamy. This was good, but more delicate like the type at Seven Hills, like it's made with more gelatin or low fat milk. Good but would not get again.\n\n* APPLE CRANBERRY CRISP ($7): I was surprised by the large portion size, it was good and tasted exactly like I would have expected but don't plan to get it again.\n\n* BLOOD AND SAND ($12): If you like scotch mixed with something sweet and tart, this is the perfect balance. \n\n* OLD CUBAN ($12): I preferred the old cuban because it was more refreshing and felt less potent than the blood and sand.\n\n* LADERA ($18): Amaaazing cab, but ouch it was expensive.", "author": "Jess C."}

Just a definite mood killer right off the bat.  The gentleman with the beard, although very nice, seated us at probably the worst table in the pretty much empty restaurant!(Soon to be closing time!) And by the way , where did you find those uncomfortable and cold metal chairs?!! Froze my bottom on those awful chairs!!  Don't get why every other table was set up with and without a table cloth.  Ours was without table cloth, for a $100 per person dinner?? Should have had table cloth like the tables next to us.  \nThe waitress was efficient and polite but got my drink wrong and I didn't say anything.  I asked for JWB with a lot of ice plus an extra cup of ice on the side(I just like lots of ice!), she brought me a shot of whiskey straight up, no ice, with a half full cup of ice on the side. My wife's wine glass had a foul odor and she had the swap it out with another 3 times till it got better! \nThe food was mediocre at best.  The Halibut was way overcooked, no longer flaky or tender. The steak was a big mahhh.  \nAfter having been to this location dozens of time when it was Moose's and having enjoyed memorable meals and evenings, we were very disappointed!  In a town with so many wonderful culinary choices, I don't see Park Tavern as a place I'll ever go back to.  \n\n\n\nThe food was just ok.", "author": "ray t."}

The menu boats delectable eats that are equal parts comforting and gourmet. To me the perfect menu can balance a wide array of pallets while still maintaining a universal theme; Park Tavern's menu has mastered this trait. \n\nOn a warm Saturday evening I ventured into Park Tavern with a group of five. Stupidly, I neglected to make a reservation but the host mentioned the bar was open seating. My family and I snagged five seats at the communal bar table and were greeted by a friendly waitress. We started, of course, with the brussels sprout chips (forget what you've heard about brussels sprouts, these are not your momma's brussels sprouts!). They are ever so slightly greasy with a bite of lemon. The taste is salty and citrusy and the perfect start to your meal. \n\nWhile the Marlowe burger is incredible and their fries are definitely something to write home about, I believe their true stand out dish is the  poulet noir. The dish is served in an iron skillet with the truffle butter and the fat from the cornish game hen lending a rich melt in your mouth flavor to the swiss chard. It's rare I dream of a vegetable, and maybe it's because it's covered in truffle butter but, the swiss chard in the base of the skillet is heavenly. Truly, this dish is a foodie's dream. Savory and rich without being overwhelmingly heavy and not to mention a beautiful presentation. \n\nThe remodeled and revamped moose's is refined comfort and it's all the better for it. I recommend this restaurant to all out of town guests or anyone I want to impress. Directly across from Washington Square Park, Park Tavern is the perfect place for elevated comfort food and a delicious cocktail.", "author": "Sarah M."}

So all of these nicely arranged corner tables are great since you can have a nice private conversation very easily, even when the restaurant is crowded. \n\nWe had a wonderful server, Larry, who gave us great recommendations, came around the perfect number of times, and was very friendly and good spirited the entire evening. Major plus is that he asked if it was a special occasion, and when I said it was my husband's birthday, he brought out a piece of cake with a candle at the end of our meal to the surprise of both of us! \n\nWe ordered the lemon crips with burrata cheese (on Larry's recommendation) which was excellent.  It was a unique dish and flavors came together really nicely.  We also ordered the harvest salad, which was really underwhelming - just a handful of baby lettuces with some radish and maybe a tiny bit of carrot? The description said market vegetables and the salad was $14 so was just expecting something more. There was 1/4 of a green bean on there so maybe something was left off? The salad was dressed very nicely. \n\nWe got the Poulet Noir which was fantastic. Beautifully cooked chicken and delicious bread stuffing. I would hands down come back here just for this dish. It was very enjoyable and plenty of food for us both to share.  \n\nWe also got the brown buttered brussels sprouts which I didn't enjoy as they were too lemony. Maybe we just got a bad batch. Next time, and there will be one to revisit the Poulet Noir, we'll try the brussels sprout chips!", "author": "Sarah G."}

Or go to one of the many coffee shops and stores nearby! \n\nGrapefruit Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($7): totally unexpected! I thought it would be grapefruit creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but they were 4 slices of warm grapefruit with a crispy caramel glaze. Yummy! https://instagram.com/p/00lKLazZqF/\n\nBanana Coconut Fritters ($9): these were good, but really heavy and there were a lot. If you plan on getting a big entree, make sure you have more than just 1 person to share these with!\n\nOatmeal Walnut Raisin Pancakes ($12): these usually come in a set of 3, but we only wanted one pancake and they let us! Unfortunately we couldn't just order one French toast. This pancake was super soft, moist, and delicious. \n\nThree Nut Butters ($9): this appetizer is also heavy. It comes with 4 big pieces of thick bread and pecan, walnut, almond butter, and honey. So yeah you can probably imagine how heavy that is. But all the butters were really good!\n\nCrispy Polenta Cakes ($17): these weren't as good as I thought they would be. I am a huge polenta fan and this came with a lot of things I like - poached eggs, arugula, and mushrooms. It was a very light, clean dish, but just not as flavorful as I'd hoped and I was just expecting the savory creaminess of liquid polenta.\n\nSmoked Salmon Benedict ($17): this is my favorite item so far! I am also on this crazy sushi craze phase, but the salmon is really great and the poached eggs, capers, horseradish sauce, etc make it taste fantastic. It's a light dish, and I hate wasabi but I don't taste the horseradish at all. \n\nWarm Open-Faced Deviled Egg Sandwich ($14): this one is pretty heavy. The portions are big and has bacon, a chicken breast, eggs, cheese melted on top, and fries on the side. A bit much for me for brunch, but it's great if you're starving or are skipping appetizers! The fries are fantastic.\n\nPT Bloody Mary ($11): I am a huge Bloody Mary fan and this one is fantastic! Great peppery kick (I love black pepper), topped with some beef jerky and some other pickled veggie I don't remember.", "author": "Cynthia W."}

The menu here is packed with traditional American dishes, but not your boring mac 'n cheese and marsala chicken dishes. Oh no, get ready for an entire chicken on your table or chunks of bacon and creamy gouda in your pasta dishes. \n\nI came here for my birthday around 8 PM, and I loved the fun combination of how intimate and lively this place was! It made for the perfect close-friend dinner ambiance. I highly recommend their margaritas, while the champagnes are good but nothing out of the ordinary. Park Tavern's menu #wins in terms of their appetizers and small plates! I had some of the most unique vegetable chips (brussel sprouts and lemon chips). So I've had and loved fried brussel sprouts in the past, but have never had lemon chips before. For a girl who shamelessly eats lemon skin (sorry dentist!), I HAD to try this and was very happy with my selection! These chips have just the perfect amount of flavor and the seasoning gave a great kick to the citrusy taste. We also got a whole hen, which was definitely delicious and well made but became a little too much salty meat after the first few bites. Finally, we finished this meal with oatmeal cookie ice cream sandwiches. I'm not one of those weird people that opt for oatmeal cookies over chocolate chip, but the graininess of the oatmeal perfectly complemented the sweet ice cream. yummm, happy birthday to me :) \n\nDefinitely will be coming back for brunch!", "author": "Aradhana V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-29", "description": "I came here quite some time ago with a large dinner party to celebrate a birthday. I had some high hopes because it became apparent that this restaurant was in some way connected to Marlowe - same font usage, they listed a \"Marlowe\" burger on the menu, etc. The overall decor and ambiance of the restaurant is slightly confusing. There are some random \"small piece\" decor items along the wall and spread out throughout which I couldn't help but notice the randomness of it all... Like I think I saw a small boat or sled and some miscellaneous vintage looking pots, vases, etc. I understand the whole \"park\" theme but I found it to be a bit busy. I also thought the wallpaper near the entrance looked a little dated. The lighting, and the general wood/floor choices are lovely though. \n\nOur server was incredibly helpful and patient with us, considering we were a party of 15+. She made awesome recommendations for drinks and was constantly checking on us throughout the meal. Everything came out in a timely manner. \n\nMy boyfriend and I excitedly decided to share the $40 rib eye steak and the arugula salad. The arugula salad was absolutely delightful. It was incredibly fresh and the pickled strawberries added just the right amount of sweetness and \"summer\" flavoring to the salad. Then came the rib eye steak... First of all, I've never thought of myself to really consider PLATING to be a major key factor for me. But, like I said this was a $40 steak, and it was Marlowe's affiliate so I didn't think that it would look any different from their plating techniques. The dishes came in a textured large grey speckled shallow bowl. Not only was the actual plating choice awkward for the size of the steak but the presentation of the food itself just seemed incredibly sloppy. It was dark, and we did split our portions so I slyly checked out everyone else's dishes (we ALL ordered the rib eye... 15 orders of ribeye -_-) and everyone's looked pretty much the same. A hunk of meat and a heap of mashed potatoes that were now mixed and muddled in with the veggies. It honestly looked like something that I made at home, and I don't mean that in a good way. It just looked bad! I'll try and find the photo and upload it to this review to try and press my point but anyway.. let's get to the taste of it. \n\nThe taste of the rib eye was BLAND and it was even slightly tough .... the mashed potatoes were overly buttery and tasted like it literally came from the box. I couldn't even hide my emotions, I turned to my boyfriend and asked if he felt the same way and he nodded, wide-eyed and said how it was a disappointing main course. I was not impressed and really wished I would have just ordered the burger. \n\nOverall, I would not return. The service was great, the location is great, but the food is not anywhere close up to par with the actual Marlowe's.

Unfortunately, our experience was pretty horrible and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Let's start with our server. He was fine...didn't crack a smile, rushed everyone along, got visibly annoyed when we had questions. I can deal with that. But when my friend, who cannot eat dairy (not by choice), asked what they could do for her, he was so rude about it. I understand that it's 12:15 on a Saturday and the kitchen is busy, but he basically told her she could get 2 poached eggs and charge her the same $17 as the fried polenta meal. When she asked if she could just get a couple eggs scrambled and maybe add some veggies to it, he shut her down without giving a reason and without trying to work with her to figure out what on the menu she could eat, or what they could do for her. As a server, I understand that modifications can sometimes be difficult, especially when pricing them and dealing with the kitchen being mad at you. BUT there is absolutely no reason a place like Park Tavern should not be able to accommodate her diet restrictions. Especially when she was willing to pay extra for it. She ended up getting avocado toast (for $10 for one piece of bread are you kidding me?!?!?!) and 2 eggs scrambled. So thank you sir for sucking it up and being a decent human. \n\nWe were all enjoying our bloodies and each other's company, but the next time I looked at my phone, it was 1:00. Our food took 45-50 minutes to come out. Other tables in his section got their food before us, and we had a chorizo and eggs come out straight up cold. We sent it back and it came back 2 minutes later hot. Did you put it in the microwave and is that why it came back so quickly? It can't heat up in the salamander that quickly...maybe on the flat top. Either way, the food was fine. I got the 2 eggs served on a mixture of Gruyere cheese and spinach mixed with the egg whites. It was decent but for however much money I paid, I expected a lot more in terms of size and quality. Oh well.\n\nAnother horrible part about this place was the bathroom. The entire floor was soaking wet, and one toilet was clogged. Get your shit together, Park Tavern. You try to pretend you are a classy high end place, but everything about your staff and bathroom say otherwise. One positive is they kept my water full the whole meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-29", "description": "My friends and I came to Park Tavern to celebrate a couple of birthdays (and yes, one of them was mine).  We had a 5:30 pm reservation on a Saturday night and expected to walk into a half empty restaurant but the place was packed and bustling at that early hour.  I would describe this restaurant as a place that serves comfort food with great service in a brasserie setting.\n\nSeated at a table along the wall, we had a great view of the restaurant, kitchen and bar area.  While waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, three of us started off with some of PT's house cocktails.  I tried the Washington Square and really enjoyed the various flavors of the drink - hints of bitterness with citrus and ginger.  One friend ordered the Country Lawyer and although that drink smells like it could put hair on ones chest, it was actually quite pleasant and went down rather smoothly.  No hairy chests to be found on all those that took a sip!\n\nTo whet our appetites we ordered the Demons on Horseback (shrimp wrapped in lardo), burrata with lemon and basil and the charcuterie platter.  Personally the housemade charcuterie platter was my favorite, as the salami and pate were delicious.  The shrimp was okay, but nothing special.  The burrata seemed to be a hit with one friend.  The fried lemon slices are really, really good and I would pop them like chips if I could.\n\nFor the entree I ordered the Poulet Rouge with spinach and peewee potatoes (they were really cute).  The chicken is roasted on a vertical rack, with the spinach and potatoes recipients of the juices that drip down from the chicken.  The dish is so simple, yet so good.  The chicken, aside from being a sight to behold, was moist and tender and full of flavor.  The meat was pretty much falling off the bone, and a knife isn't really needed.  Make sure you ask for extra bread to sop up all those chicken juices.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the birthday cake (with two candles), Arnold Palmer boozy float, the cheese plate and the apple crisp.  They ended up delivering two very generous slices of birthday cake (chocolate with chocolate buttercream frosting), each with a candle (trick candles too!) and both were on the house!  That was so incredibly nice of them.  And who doesn't love a well made birthday cake (sorry, but supermarket cake frosting icks me out)!  The person that created the Arnold Palmer float is a genius.  There is no stopping after that first sip.  The apple crisp was good and full of the flavors of the fruit.  I'm not big on eating desserts but in this case that cake was so good I couldn't stop digging my fork into it.   I wish more places offered birthday cake for dessert.  Sometimes a simple dessert is the perfect ending to a meal of comfort food.\n\nOur wait staff was on point and provided great service, answering all of our questions and making sure our needs were met.  Given how busy it was, we were really happy with the attention we received.  PT is a good place for dinner and/or drinks for large and small groups.   Would I come back?  Absolutely.  How does it compare to Marlowe?  PT is more like the big city cousin, a bit more formal than Marlowe, which is more laid back and casual.", "author": "Melissa L."}

The secret is to mention french fries; there's just something about potatoes fried to a golden crisp. \n\nPark Tavern had me at PT fries, more specifically fries with truffle oil, soft-cooked egg, and caviar. I chose this restaurant for my friend's birthday celebration based solely upon that description for fries. I was pleasantly surprised that everything else we ordered was just as good, albeit nothing can take the place of the french fries. \n\n(1) Lemon chips: Burrata has never done me wrong and did not this evening.\n(2) PT fries: Can you say food-gasm?\n(3) Marlowe burger: The burger is melt in your mouth good. The only thing that can make it better is bacon and low and behold, bacon is part of the burger. My tip is that you ask for the sauce that goes with the PT fries for the fries that come with the burger. You can thank me later.\n(4) Ribeye: Delicious meaty goodness with some veggies to \"balance\" out the gluttony thus far.\n(5) Chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: The only item we ordered that was average. It tasted more like a pot de creme but I can't knock the restaurant for one item.\n(6) June \"birthday\" cake: Sizable portion that we devoured despite being full. This only helps to prove the theory that people have a second stomach for dessert. \n\nReservations recommended and try to book earlier rather than later.

As the sister restaurant to Marlowe, I have to say Park Tavern is definitely the \"big\" sister with its larger, sophisticated space and what I thought to be a more refined American bistro menu (there are some parallel items) complete with cocktails. \n\nOn Sunday, 10.16.11, my friend and I came for an early dinner at 5:30 pm (with reservations) and were promptly seated. \n\nF O O D\n*BRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS ($6) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4-pWX0F9mi_VlN1IAxweSQ?select=UC9h6h6p3P53R7cuCYcTxg\nAside from the Marlowe Burger, the Brussels Sprout Chips is what Marlowe is known for. It's crispy, salty and citrusy; simply ADDICTING!

Even the breast was moist and could easily be mistaken for the thigh meat. Well-seasoned, the hen was rich in flavor with a light kick. The condensed meaty flavor from the accompanying au jus gave it that extra oomph. The bloomsdale spinach was slightly charred which gave a smoky component while the fluffy as clouds peewee potatoes added a subtle sweetness. A perfectly balanced dish!\n\nThough I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, I would not recommend ordering it on a date unless you want to scare your date off with your lack of proper dining etiquette. The poulet rouge arrives whole and you have to carve it yourself, though it's much easier to eat it caveman style. I plead the 5th on what approach I took. So again, don't order this dish unless you're totally comfortable with your date or if your date is Fred Flintstone. \n\nS E R V I C E\nProfessional, friendly, and attentive (different from my experiences at Marlowe). The hostesses were welcoming, our waitress always had a smile on her face and the busboys were on their game making sure our water glasses were always filled and plates were promptly taken away.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that our entrees took a while to come out and the restaurant wasn't busy at the time.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nVintage meets modern chic with grey tile and red brick walls, open kitchen, communal table, wooden drop candle chandelier, black/white photos and large mirrors. \n\nPark Tavern is a much larger space than Marlowe (~3 times larger) and more sophisticated with an older crowd.

If you go with a group of 8 like I did, you could really only hear the people sitting immediately next to you. Not really an atmosphere for group conversation. \n\nNot good for vegetarians.

I am being picky.. brussels sprouts are my thing.\n\n* Chicken fried green tomato, remoulade $7: 3 stars\nNicely done, thin but crisp breading. Not bad, not fantastic either.\n\n* Pork belly bites, horseradish aioli $6: 2 stars\nPork belly should be much more fatty & tender! I found the meat quite hard.\n\n* Deviled eggs, Nueske's baken & chives $1.5 each: 1 star\nI found this to be really plain in flavor. The yolk filling was just too egg-y if that makes any sense - I could barely taste the bacon & chives, which should've balanced out its flavor mroe.\n\n* Fried oysters \"Caesar\" $12: 5 stars\nAmazing! The oysters were absolutely delicious. When you took a bite and the soup-y insides poured into your mouth, it was savory and had an amazing rich flavor. The lettuce leaves with caesar dressing balanced out what would've been an overly intense rich flavor in the fried breading and the oyster. \n\n* Yellow doll watermelon & Mangalitsa prosciutto, truffle & mustard greens $12: 4.5 stars\nSurprisingly wonderful! Loved the interplay of flavors, temperatures, and textures. Who would've thought that juicy/sweet watermelon would go so well with salty/dry prosciutto? Each time I chewed, my taste buds burst with more new flavor combinations.\n\n* Lamb chops & merguez sausage, broccoli rabe with garlic & chili $28: 4 stars\nI didn't get to try this but a couple friends got the dish and it looked wonderful. The lamb was cooked rare to medium-rare and looked incredibly rich & tender.\n\n* Herb marinated whole cornish game hen, Bloomsdale spinach, carrots & baby turnips $22: 4 stars\nReally delicious, juicy, tender, and well seasoned meat. A nice dish to get for the \"ooh's\" and \"aah's\" - the whole hen is served standing up!\n\n* Risotto: 4 stars\nMy friend got this special ordered as she's vegetarian. I had a bite & it was creamy and had amazing texture. It had a tart sauce on top, which gave it a little too much of a sour flavor. Otherwise really good.\n\n* Apple & fig dessert with ice cream: 4 stars\nLoved it. Warm, soft slices of apple & fig under a wonderfully crunchy yet subtle crust. The ice cream was a great contrast - we forgot what the menu said the flavor was, but we all agreed it had hints of lemon. It was light with a very smooth texture.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

We thought service was on point and the open space rustic layout coupled with the warm lighting made for a relaxing meal. We ordered the hush puppies, brussel sprouts side, burger with PT fries and foie gras torchon. The hush puppies were warm, flaky and jam packed of flavor without being too dense. Definitely a must order. The brussel sprouts were sizzling and great with the chili flakes and Parmesan addition but could have benefitted from a lighter hand on the lemon juice. The foie gras was good but a little more petite than expected. The only thing that wasn't a standout dish was the dessert. The chocolate cake was a little dry and light on ganache. We ordered a side of caramel ice cream which made it better! Dessert was on the house though for our special celebration so no complaints there!", "author": "NJ A."}

I've been procrastinating on this review, and they've already changed a couple of the dishes on the menu since my visit a couple of months ago, so I had to take a guess for some of the descriptions. I made reservations for an early dinner for a party of 5, and it was easy to do a couple weeks in advance for a Saturday night. We arrived and were seated quickly. We ordered:\n\n-Complimentary Bread and Butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g): The bread and butter were really good- it's hard to go wrong with epi bread!\n-\"Marlowe Burger\" (Caramelized Onion, Cheddar, Bacon, Horseradish A\u00efoli & Fries, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#aew2-QxxyeL_NJBnMQ8APA): Just as delicious as I remember it being at Marlowe. Highly recommended.\n-Herb-Crusted Halibut (English Peas & Pea Tendrils, Crispy Shallots, Prosciutto, White Wine Velout\u00e9, $28, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#fICBimLI_n5YnDY9Z8pwsA): My friend actually ordered this dish, and it was amazing! I rarely order fish at restaurants since I've had so many bad experiences with it being overcooked, but this halibut was cooked perfectly. The herb crust also added a nice crunchy texture, and all the components in this dish worked really well together. Highly recommended!\n-Heirloom Beet Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#GHVYEfh5Xb5GqHLqZOA6Jw): Just ok. I liked the different varieties of beets, but overall the dish wasn't anything special. Skip.\n-Crispy Lemon Chips (Burrata, Nigella Seed, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#Z5yOUZZaLC-DAsIF-NzA-Q): Very interesting, and something I've never seen before or tried, and probably for good reason. The burrata was creamy and delicious, but I didn't get the lemon chips idea. Skip on the lemon chips but the burrata is recommended.\n-PT Fries (Truffle, Soft-Cooked Egg & Caviar, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=bc5IsPTz39oVAcr5B5J7Ww#bc5IsPTz39oVAcr5B5J7Ww): Yum! The truffle fries were crispy and super aromatic, which added to the delicious flavor. I loved the soft cooked egg that you dipped the fries in, and the caviar on top of the egg. Highly recommended!\n-Smoked Deviled Eggs (Bacon, Pickled Jalape\u00f1o, Chive, $2/ea, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#yMLlFP470A0NQgFQBYkRkw): A-MAZING! A must order.! I'm not a huge fan of deviled eggs, but this version is the best I've had, ever, and this was an excellent addition to the 2013 Big Eat list. Make sure you order yourself more than one!\n-Brown Butter Brussels Sprouts (Parmesan & Chili Flakes, $8, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#xpx_LG76RbSKaNj98QH6wg): Disappointing! I love brussels sprouts, and these were just ok. They were a little underseasoned and not quite crispy enough. Skip.\n-Strawberry Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-tavern-san-francisco?select=t5C10RCRWsnMDtypmfjH5g#9c85ppSiI_OQpBaK3TlGoA): Yum! This cake was delicious, and not too sweet. I loved how fluffy the cake was, and that you could taste the fresh strawberry in the frosting. Recommended.\n\nOverall, I loved my dining experience at Park Tavern although there were some misses. Service was on par, and the kitchen was efficient. I also loved the decor and ambience here, and will definitely be back for another meal (and more deviled eggs) in the future! The biggest negative about dining here is the parking- it can take a while since this area gets so busy!", "author": "Amy D."}

Love it love it love it! \n\nI pulled up to see the thing I love most - Valet! For $12 you can dress to thrill and wear sky scraper heels to dinner because the door is less than 20 steps away. That always makes me very happy! \n\nThe space is nice. The last time I was here was when it was Moose's. We were upstairs in the tiny private area after my friend was married at the church across the way. \n\nOur meal consisted of things that were great and things that were not so great: \nSkip the deviled eggs and demon on horseback appetizers. The Halibut entree was really nice. I loved the balance of the rich hearty broth with fresh peas and pea tendrils. The sear on the fish was a wonderful contrast. \n\nThe vertical poultry reminds me of beer can chicken. Any home chef familiar with Williams Sonoma has vertical roaster in their cabinet *wink*. I am not a fan of brining poultry because often times it winds up being too salty so I employ other methods. This baby was was tender and flavorful despite being salty for me. The rustic bread stuffing that served as a catch all for the poultry drippings was delicious. I especially liked how they didn't over use truffles because those can ruin it for me. I can see why people love this entree. I would easily recommend it. \n\nDessert. Banana Split. YES!! The house made ice cream was good - not as rich as I like, but perfect after that heavy meal. The carmelized bananas turned what we consider an everyday treat into something special. Just taking the time to blowtorch or flash broil the bananas makes this the kind of dessert I love. I really appreciate attention to detail. Rare to see that in desserts, which made me love it more. \n\nWe enjoyed service that was friendly, professional, unrushed. I was really happy. The seating isn't comfy, but when you are in good company - that matters little. \n\nAfter our leisurely dinner we walked to Washington Square across the street. Ok - I held on to Mike for dear life trying not to break my neck navigating the uneven terrain in my heels. \n\nHey, if I fell, I would have looked undeniably faabulous. You can bet money on that! \n\nGo to Park Tavern. Valet Park your car. Enjoy dinner and dessert (skip the over hyped appetizers).

Great starter to order and munch on while you wait for the rest of the delicious food to arrive.\n\nSmoked Deviled Eggs - So addicting! You'll definitely want to order more than one!\n\nPT Fries - The perfect crisp-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside fries! Nicely seasoned and a hint of truffle oil? The dipping sauce they serve with it is just fine...but the best part is definitely the soft-boiled egg with caviar. Whoever thought of egg and fries...genius!\n\nPoulet Noir - We've gotten the Poulet Rouge here before which was amazing, and this dish was no different. Don't think we've ever had a chicken that's been cooked so perfectly or so tasty before (other than the Poulet Rouge, of course)!\n\nC.A.B NY Steak - The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Incredibly juicy and well seasoned. The pole beans were delicious as well, but what tied everything together was the red wine jus! The only part of the dish that I was hoping more from was the braised Kobe and bone marrow. The braised Kobe was a tad overdone and a little on the dry side. But...what could've saved it was if there was more bone marrow! It was really tough to identify the buttery, fatty, taste of heaven that we crave in bone marrow.\n\nDesserts:\nWood-Fired Roasted Strawberry & Rhubarb Shortcake - Oh my goodness, this was so yummy. The strawberry and rhubarb was cooked down and oh so tasty with the wonderful shortcake and vanilla ice cream!\n\nAfternoon Delight - When a restaurant offers Captain Crunch ice cream, you have to just get it! It was as you would expect, Captain Crunch-y and rich ice cream with a dust of cereal. This was served with a delicious shot of cereal milk cr\u00e8me.

The crusty French bread & soft spreadable butter they start you out with is yummy.  For starters, we shared the famous brussels sprout chips ($9) and the foie gras torchon ($18).  Both w ere very good.  The brussels chips were a little on the salty side and I could have done without the lemony flavor, but otherwise they were excellent.  The foie gras was also excellent and the cripsy brioche, pepitas and sour cherry compote were good accompaniments, but I felt like the portion was very stingy, especially for almost $20.  For our entrees, my husband had the Marlowe burger ($16), which he really enjoyed, and I had the arctic char with fennel risotto ($29).  The fish was cooked perfectly, and I really loved the risotto.  Fennel isn't my favorite flavor, but the risotto was perfect.  I'm a bit of a risotto snob and frequently find restaurant versions too watery or with too much added cream, but this was wonderful.  Overall, the food was all very good but I felt like it is a touch overpriced, even for SF (especially the appetizers).  The atmosphere is a bit scene-y (and loud) for my tastes, but fortunately the staff is very kind and there is none of the stuck-up attitude that tends to go with that scene.  \nParking in the area is terrible so we used their $12 valet.", "author": "A M."}

Not the most tender steaks in the world but tasty enough.\n\nI had a carafe of rose that was quite nice, the partner had a couple of fancy shmancy cocktails which she seemed to enjoy....\n\nDesserts were a miss, one a very very dry cake, the other a shortbread with strawberry rhubarb, the fruit was tasty, but again the shortbread was super dry...\n\nA note on the private room, where I attended an event not long ago - it has comfortable furnishings and is pleasant enough, but is more of a loft type space so the noise from the very noisy resto below will creep up into your event....the service was great, which seems a constant, but another very annoying thing about this room is that the stairs leading up to it are used by staff coming and going to the next level up....I don't know what they're doing up there, but the seemingly constant foot traffic was very intrusive and noticeable. \n\nStill, there's a lot to like about Park Tavern - the Washington Square location, complete with outdoor seating, the communal table and bar seating which I assume is for walk ins, the decor (nice and sort of private club-like), the crowd - very San Francisco, as it has become an institution for a certain set in a short time.

Can't go wrong with a runny boiled egg you pour into the fries covered in truffle oil.  The Venison was good, but didn't stand out, and the the inclusion of Beef Tartare and Marrow made it confusing.  \n\nFor the Entrees we split the Scallops, Duck and CAB  NY Steak.  The Scallops were really flavorful and perfectly cooked, however the entree was light, will leave you hungry. The duck and steak were good portions but both suffered from a lack of distinct duck or steak flavors.  In other words, the meat was a little bland.  The sides prepared with the dishes were good.  The steak came with a bone marrow, that was also confusing.  I'm not sure how they prepared it but it was dry and flaky, like they deep fried the marrow, and the placed it back in the bone. The potatoes on the dish were delicious. \n\nDessert also lacked a punch.  Although the Carrot Cake was good it wasn't outstanding.  And the S'mores wasn't too impressive, other than the ice cream portion.  \n\nThe drinks were okay, nothing spectacular but good flavors.  \n\nDon't get me wrong Park Tavern is a good restaurant.  It has some very stand out dishes but also some just okay ones.", "author": "Veasna H."}

I've been here multiple times and, for the most part, it is tasty! \n\nFor brunch:\nI would definitely try the french toast. It has the perfect level of sweets where it isn't overkill but just the right amount to be so dang good. The polenta cakes are really good as well but rather small in size. I would avoid the marlowe burger - it's good but definitely not the best item that Park Tavern offers. \n\nFor dinner:\nThe truffle fries are godly. Though, it's hard to go wrong with anything with truffles and caviar. I really liked the half chicken. The presentation is great and the chicken is really tender. For appetizers, I didn't like the waygu beef jerky at all. I do recommend trying the brussel sprout chips. It's just like kale chips but tastier if you like brussel sprouts.\n\nOverall, Park Tavern is a great spot. The decorations are great and it always seems like a popular place to be. I definitely recommend making reservations in advance to avoid waiting for a table. Though, there is a community table that is first come, first serve if you are in a rush!", "author": "Brandon P."}

Overhyped \"deviled eggs\" were just OK for me. The egg is so deconstructed it was not recognizable as an egg and due to the extreme darkness of the lighting (more about this in a bit) I actually at first thought it was a stuffed mushroom! \nMy spousal unit ordered the poulet noir which was not chicken, but a Cornish Game Hen, served whole with sauce poured over it. While this presentation is impressive, it was difficult for him to carve and eat from the serving platter (again, the lack of light caused some difficulty here). He asked for a plate at some point which made the task of carving/eating a bit easier. \nI had the clams with chorizo and grilled bread. It is a truly wonderful dish. Perfectly cooked clams and sausage in a delicious broth that is a wonderful dip for the grilled bread. \nService: a major plus at Park Tavern. Seamless, non-intrusive, and efficient. Perfect. \nAmbiance: had some problems here. The noise level just about prevents conversation. It is very very loud in Park Tavern. We were a party of 3 who hadn't been together for a while and had a lot to catch up on. We couldn't. We were yelling, which is not pleasant or relaxing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-30", "description": "This review is for the brunch only. \n\nPark Tavern is such a classy brunch spot tucked right into the quaint North Beach Washington Square park neighborhood (not the strip clubs part of NB). With a direct view of the park from both the ample outdoor and indoor seating options, Park Tavern boasts a creative take on traditional brunch entrees, great service and a somewhat upscale ambiance. \n\nHere's what I recommend: \n1. Crispy polenta cakes with truffles: It's basically like an eggs benedict but with poached eggs (not as runny as normal benedicts) on top of fried polenta served with a bed of mushrooms. This is seriously a one of a kind dish that you've got to try! \n2. Marlowe Burger: Deliciously juicy - in the same realm as the NOPA and Maverick burgers.\n3. Orange mimosas: freshly squeezed and absolutely traditional in concept. It's almost a rarity nowadays to have just a classic quality mimosa. Everyone always tries to make theirs unique with weird funky twists but Park Tavern stays authentic. \n\nSeriously though, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Go with what your taste buds desire but if you're trying to decide between two entrees, pick one of the above!\n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

I can't get enough of their \"Poulet\" mini-bird (Cornish game hen, same difference) that's cooked and served on a cast iron skillet with a stick that goes up the Poulet's behind.  I normally don't order chicken because it can be overcooked and dry, but the Poulet at Park Tavern is a divine exception.  It is consistently tender, juicy, can't get into my mouth and tummy fast enough, delicious!  The bottom of the skillet is filled with some delicious herb stuffing.  The Poulet's flavors vary by season.  In the winter, it's called \"Poulet Noir\" flavored with truffles.  In the spring/summer, it's called \"Poulet Rojo\" flavored with chile and other red spices.  \n\nOther outstanding things I've ordered the various times I've dined at Park Tavern are: the deviled eggs, each topped with a decadent, crunch piece of bacon and the pickled jalepeno makes it one of the best deviled eggs, ever; brussel sprout chips (not to be confused with the side order of brown butter brussel sprouts, which aren't as good); and Demons on Horseback (lardo aka Italian bacon fat wrapped shrimp).\n\nJust thinking about all the yummy goodness has got my mouth pooling with drool!", "author": "Christina L."}

We then shared the Park Tavern Salad - a salad with green goddess dressing which was a flashback to the 90s (earlier?). Another yummy dish. I had the lamb entree which was cooked perfectly and served with roasted purple broccoli and potatoes.

Parking is difficult, but we found one on the street near the Washington park.  This is the old Moose's restaurant location, which was written about so much by columnist Herb Caen.  Sat at the bar at first and had beers and the brussel sprout chips, which were very good and innovative.  Good Ninnkasi IPA on draft.\n\nWe had the PT fries and crab salad for starters, which were both very good.  Kudos for creativity on the egg and caviar dipping sauce for the fries.  We went with the seafood for the entrees:  Atlantic cod with fennel and pearled onions was very good and the seared scallops with kale and ham were good.  We skipped dessert, and just had press pot decaf, which was good.\n\nService was very good, nice interior, and the atmosphere was lively and festive.  The menu had good gluten-free options.  I would consider going back and trying some of the meat entrees next time.", "author": "Dan L."}

I cannot get you off my mind!!\n\nWe came here with a huge party and started off with drinks and apps. The waiter was super friendly giving personal suggestions and letting us take our time to chat, sip our wine, and review the menu.\n\nSome of the dishes were a hit or a miss, but the apps were all very superb. We had the brussel sprout chips, deviled eggs, and cheese fondue. But the star app was definitely the truffle fries. The fries were accompanied by a soft-cooked egg with caviar as well as an aioli. Yummy gooey delish!\n\nFor the main courses, we tried almost everything but the star of the table was the \"poulet noir\" which was a poulet in command on a cast iron pan with onion stuffing below to soak in all the goodness. All that goodness was accompanied by a brown truffle sauce which the waiter poured over the chicken upon service. Yum! If you are a Californian eater, I suggest you split this since it was huge!  The braised beef short ribs came in as the 2nd most favorite on the table. \n\nFor dessert, the buttermilk panna cotta with mandarin wedges, oats, and toasted oats was perfect - not too sweet, deliciously creamy, and very clean and light. \n\nThis would be the perfect place for a date or to grab a glass of wine with snacks (highly recommend the truffle fries!) after a long day at work.

Now we're back in \"Moose's\" territory with a better menu, better food, stellar service, and that undefinable X-factor that makes all the women look  beautiful and all the men look rich.    \n\nHaving done some early reconnaissance, I knew that it'd be no meal at all unless I sprung for the Deviled Eggs ($2 each, topped with bacon and jalapenos) and the \"Brussels Sprout Chips\" ($7).  Holy crap, those two things plus a couple glasses of that Rose Prosecco ($12 each) and I was sated on the umami flavors:  salty, spicy, fatty, and rich.  \n\nWent on to sample a \"Tuna Conserva\" ($8) which tasted luscious atop grilled, sliced baguette.  \n\nThe way to dine here and still stash away a little dough is to opt for one of the richest, butteriest, best burgers around.  At $14, in this locale, it's a steal.  My dining companions ordered all sorts of other stuff but I was too consumed with the glorious riches before me so who knows what they were eating.  \n\nI walked outside to find a gaggle of tourists still standing there on the northeast side of Washington Square Park, with cameras aimed at Coit Tower, all lit up in Giants Orange.

Kind of getting-away-with-it and laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nNot that it's bad. It's not bad at all.. but it's a premium priced establishment which 'only' offers good food.\n\nPT seems to have reached that critical mass of popularity at that price point of which restauranteurs must dream - it's always packed, and judging by the crowd it's a Destination eatery in the city at the weekend for bridges and tunnels folks.\n\nWhat you get:\n\n- Location: On Washington Square, so it looks kind of pretty but parking is a disaster unless you valet.\n- Great space (think classic NYC brasserie feel)\n- Without a reservation, probably 45mins-1 hour wait. Although there is bar seating and a first come, first served communal table which is a nice touch.\n- Menu: modern Californian, with a few nice twists. I like the brunch menu the best, and specifically the polenta cakes with mushrooms, avocado toasts and pastries. The famous 'Marlowe Burger' is also well thought of by the burger-eating community. \n- The Bloodies are worth checking out. As a beer person, I'm always disappointed with the draft selection - but then, it's not really their thing. Wine list is fine.\n\nMy issue is one of price and consistency. If the service and food was consistently excellent, I would feel like PT was about 15% overpriced but I'd still come back once in a while especially if I lived nearby, or wanted a boozy brunch in a nice space - possibly for a birthday or something. But the fact is they have consistency issues - the service can get surprisingly sloppy when it gets really busy (which it often does), and for a premium price you do expect the food to be on-the-money every time (which it isn't) - soggy burger buns, overcooked eggs have been served up to my party more than once.\n\nExec Summary: You can do better for the money.", "author": "Matt G."}

We walked over from Nob Hill, chatting and enjoying the SF vibes. She made a reservation for us so when we got there we only waited a few minutes and our table was ready. They sat us, per her request, in the section over by the window. She recommended we start with the cinnamon challah, and woah, that did NOT disappoint. It was DELICIOUS. Soooo buttery and cinnamony, ah, wish I could have had a few more pieces to myself! :D For my entree I got the smoked salmon eggs benedict, which were not your traditional ones, on english muffins, but instead it was on a piece of toast. It was very tasty! After my meal, though, I still wanted a little something more (mostly because all of their starters and sides sounded so good) so I ordered some toast with jams. Those were just ok. The bread was way too tough, kinda painful to eat, too chewey, and the jams were meh. But besides that last part, everything else was great! I'd definitely come back to this spot.

I don't even remember how the entrees tasted nor do I care, because they were completely overshadowed by how good the carpaccio was. The beef tartare was prepared really well. It had a very good balance of citrusy acid with the sweetness of the onions and beef. \n\nAll of that doesn't matter once you eat the crispy bone marrow. Each crunchy cube of deep fried bone marrow exploded with rich, savory, beefy goodness. I could keep eating those scrumptious pieces of heaven until they'd have to wheelbarrow me out. Although they're amazing on their own, they also enhanced the rest of the dish. Not only do they provide a crunchy contrast to the soft tartare and tender carpaccio, they also lend a rich fatty undertone to the otherwise raw and fresh nature of the other ingredients. The ingenious use of flavors and textural contrasts combined with the perfect balance of this dish make it a must have appetizer. Actually, forget what I said; skip it.

I've tried a salad, the brussel sprout chips, the parmesan truffle fries, and their burger so far, but all seemed to be a bit heavy handed on the salt - but not too much so that I would send it back. My fiance loves salt, so he thought everything tasted great, so I think it may be a matter of preference. \n\nAlso, there was one time where we ordered two of their devilled eggs, one regular and one without bacon since my fianc\u00e9 does't eat pork. They brought it out but both had bacon on it, so we politely informed our waiter that we had ordered one without pork and if we could get another made fresh without the bacon. He smiled, took the dish back to the kitchen, and the seemingly same plate came out less than a minute later...it seemed like they just took out the bacon one of the eggs and sent the same plate back out. We didn't want to ask for it again, so my fianc\u00e9 ended up not eating his egg and I ate both. \n\nRealistically, since it's a casual place very close to my house and with good ambience I'll probably go back again, particularly for their drinks.

The food was solid, a bit on the pricier side, and didn't exactly knock my socks off.\n\nWhole wheat toast with avocado, lemon, chili, and salt ($7) - We ordered this to share.

I'd save your $7.\n\nConfit chicken & potato hash, wild arugula & poached egg ($16) - The waitress said this was the best thing on the menu, so I had to try it (my friend and I split this and the polenta cakes). I didn't think it was the best thing on the menu. It's basically rotisserie chicken with potatoes, very little arugula and egg. It was not bad, but I was underwhelmed.\n\nCrispy polenta cakes, wild mushrooms, poached eggs, wild arugula, truffle salsa verde & shaved parmesan ($15) - I thought this was the best - the polenta cakes were delicious, the truffle oil was abundant and all the flavors meshed together well. The yolk from the poached egg was delicious when mixed with the polenta cake.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice brunch with a great decor, and I was happy I didn't have to wait for an absurd time in line.

The toast was delicious, don't get me wrong, but not worth the $10 in my opinion.

The waitress was nice, water refilled promptly,  and two desserts on the house as a congrats! \n\nApps: deviled eggs, demons on horseback, PT fries, tomato tarts, crispy panissa. Great starters, my favorites being the deviled eggs and the tomato tart. \nSides: twice baked potatoes, roasted corn, pickled fried green tomatoes, and roasted brussel sprouts. I loved the brussel spouts, soft with a hint of brown sugar, they were delicious. \nEntrees: poulet noir, grassfed ribeye, and pork chop. All the meats were juicy, tender and paired perfectly with their sides. \nDessert: cherry rhubarb crumble and chocolate silk: the warm cherry and rhubarb crumble had just enough tart and just enough sweetness, the perfect combo to end a meal with. The chocolate silk was a little rich, one bite was enough for me. \n\nThanks for a great meal and a start to a great celebration.", "author": "Kelly C."}

Coming from Biergarten and Tonga Room, it'd be hard to impress me and 2 guests from NYC.  But Park Tavern is just as good if not better than I remembered.  \nI came back for the sprout chips but was wowed by everything else.  We GORGED ourselves like gluttons.  We ordered the burger, the demons on horseback, the brussel sprouts and deviled eggs, and that was JUST the appetizers for 3 people!!!\nAll were excellent and sinful.  \nMain courses were the juiciest pork chop I've ever had (take that NoPa!), a delicate steelhead trout which was almost upstaged by the risotto and wood ear mushrooms on the side, and the red snapper with butter beans (the snapper was the weakest item but it was pretty good).  If that wasn't enough, we threw in the cheese drenched twice baked potato.\n\nAnd you can't skip a Jennifer Puccio dessert, so we went for the lightest thing we could find, the panna cotta which was a refreshing finish to send us on our way to the new bar Benjamin Cooper from the guys behind BIG.  \nAll in all, a success of excess.  \nNow for some salad.", "author": "Christian W."}

Finally had the opportunity to check it out for Sunday brunch with a group of friends. One great plus is that they do accept reservations and you can find them on OpenTable.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautifully done, classic and modern which matches the food being served. They have a great selection of dishes for brunch that covers everything from vegetarian options to great American breakfasts. The wife had the Crispy Polenta Cakes that she describes as \"delish.\" I had the Cast-Iron Baked Farm Eggs which was also an awesome dish. The food is heavy, but the portion is reasonable. The quality is very high which allows them to charge the premium prices that they do.\n\nSo why only 3 stars, you're asking yourself. Well, when we were first sat and our waiter came to take our drink order, he was obviously disappointed that we were not ordering alcoholic drinks. The whole backside of the menu is dedicated to cocktails, beer, wine, etc. But, you know, not everyone is looking to get shwasty pants in the middle of the day on a Sunday. That should not change the way that the waiter treats you. Plus, technically and for etiquette you're not required to tip on alcohol anyways, so y'know. \n\nAnyways, we enjoyed our time and one of the other members of our party had her diet coke refilled a few times throughout the meal. When we received our bill at the end she was charged full price (somewhere around $3) each time they refilled her drink. What place does that? I understand if they're coming out with a small bottle/can each time that they would charge you. But when they're filling it at the fountain? You definitely do not expect it to be charged. If you are going to charge, at least say that when you're offering a refill and not make it seem like it's a complimentary service.\n\nRegardless, we brought this to our waiter's attention and he did take the additional charges off of the bill. Again acting slightly disappointed with us. I will definitely be back to give them another chance, perhaps at dinner when I will be ordering a cocktail, but when you're already paying a premium price it's annoying to leave feeling like they were trying to nickel and dime you.", "author": "Ben B."}

Even who don't like brussels sprout would eat this!\n- Smoked deviled eggs - really yummy and the pepper inside the egg gives it the perfect kick! I didn't eat the bacon that comes on top of the egg but my friends said that it was so good! \nAnd after those 3 dishes we got kind full so we jumped straight to desert, we tried the October's Birthday Cake, it was good but the appetizers wowed me more!!!\nOverall was such an awesome experience!

I'm sure you look at them on the menu and think \"what's a lemon chip?\"  Don't worry about that and just order it.   The deviled eggs are also good, but the lemon chips are where it's at.\n\nMy GF had the scallops and I had the Poulet Vert.  She said the scallops were great and the woman at the table next to us was coveting her scallops.  At one point, after hearing the woman continue to talk about the scallops said \"why don't you pick up your fork and ask her for some...\"  So, if a scallop dish can make your neighbor drool and continue to talk about them, it's probably worth a try.\n\nThe poulet vert is good too.  It's a little awkward to eat since it's impaled on the pan (roasted vertically as if it is was on a beer can) but it's really good.  At first, I was like \"baked chicken (cornish hen)\" that's not really exciting.  But I figured I'd give it try.  (I asked the server what she thought about it, and she said it was as good as Zuni's which I was unimpressed by).  But, I'm glad I tried it.  It was juicy, and definitely a generous serving (I only ate half of it).  \n\nDo yourself a favor, make a reservation and go all out.  I don't think you'll regret it", "author": "Larry L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "Came here for dinner (not brunch, like 50+% of the reviews seem to be).\n\nThe appetizers were great.  I'm usually pretty conservative with my ratings, so that's really saying something.  Brussel sprout chips had some lemon zest that really brightened up the normally greasy (in a good way) dish.  Well seasoned, tasty, and I could easily eat more of it than I should.  Smoked Deviled Eggs, I initially thought they were a tad pricey, but upon consuming, they were really really good.  I'm not a fan of jalapeno, but it worked well here.  The flavors were very well balanced, with the smokey salty crispy bacon, the creamy seasoned egg yolk, a tiny kick/bite from the thin slice of jalapeno, and tiny bit of chives to lighten it up, all coming together magnificently.  PT Fries were fried nice and crispy (but not burnt), and while dipped in the egg with caviar were good, I will never ever say no to truffle aioli.\n\nMains:  The burger is really good, and stands up to its well deserved reputation in local food blogs/rankings.  Again, it was very well balanced with discreet complementing flavors and textures.  A nicely toasted bun that held up well and didn't get soggy; crisp, with a fair bit of melted butter.  The right amount of cheese and grilled onions, so they don't all fall out on your first bite.  The actual patty, wasn't super awesome on it's own, but combined with everything else, worked really well together.     The chicken was really succulent and tender.  The seasoning isn't too heavy, allowing you to really taste the chicken.  \n\nDecor:  Upscale modern casual, but not overly so.  It wouldn't feel overly out of place taking your parents/family here.  Some tourists, but that's expected for the area.  Acoustics get a bit loud when it fills up.\n\nWaitstaff were great.  Attentive, but not annoyingly so.

Really didn't see any innovation in the food but I feel that there's unfortunate expectation that comes with hype.  Decor was fantastic.  Upon asking the waitress/host what she would categorize the atmosphere she responded, \"Urban.\"  I think she saw my disgusted face because Urban Decor is more City-like loft space with grit.  This place has exposed wooden beams, kitchen tiles, arches.  My pretentious response, \"this is not Urban..\" she responded, \"well, call it what you wish, but it's a Tavern so I suppose a Tavern.\"  She hated me.  Honey - it's Rustic Vintage.\n\nEnough of that and on to the food:\n- Deviled Eggs - Great!  But one was enough\n- Crispy Lemon Chips - With burata on top!  Was good, but burata is always good.\n- Fried Sunchokes - Too close to the sun, because they tasted BURNT and chard \n- Framage Blanc Constini - Like an hor dourves from a wedding... or company party\n- Brussels Sprouts Chips - Not that great.. too much chip, not enough Brussels\n\n-Salad - This came with fried chicken skin which didn't work.  Salad with the blue cheese was great, but the innovative part fell through with how unavoidably salty the skin was\n\n-Halibut - This was amazing and really brought up the stars.  Fish was cooked perfectly, the sauce was yummy, I loved it.\n\n--Birthday Cake - Dare I say it?  boxed cake?  No... but I didn't think it was special at all. None of the desserts were exciting and I felt like you could find them at a friend's picnic.\n\nMy Level 5 Vegan friend had them create a special menu for her.  To my delight her dishes were off the menu and off the hook. \n\nI ordered the Twin Peaks drink which tasted similar.. almost... to an Old Fashioned drink with bourbon, but it came out in a strange color and in an awkward martini glass.  We asked for a second round and asked the bartender to put the drink in an Old Fashioned glass.. it just felt better. I'm sure you would agree.

The gnocchi was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle...perfect!  The gnocchi was surrounded by by a truffled cream sauce and porcini mushrooms.  Not too over whelming at all.\n\nFor main dishes we got the Marlowe burger, the wood-fired sole, and the hen.  The hen takes some time to cook so put your order in if you know you want it.  It looks overwhelming when it first comes out, but it is delicious and moist.  The meat is so tender so it's very easy to cut the meat off the bone.  The staff pours au jus over the hen, which helps keep the hen warm and moist.  The stuffing is like the gnocchi, crispy on the outside and yummy goodness on the inside.

To me, casual means jeans and a t-shirt. Casual for the edge of North Beach/Marina though, means all clothes should be bought at Ambience or similar and to wear 4in stiletto heels. So mind that, cover up your tattoos and you might save yourself some looks from snooty rich kids spending daddy's money.\n\nNow, once you've gotten past the clientele, literally everything is amazing though. \n\nFood;\nWe started with the lemon crisps, served with burrata - it was so delicious. Never encountered deep fried, super thin slices of lemon, but it was delightfully tangy, well completed by the sweet and creamy cheese. \nMy fianc\u00e9 had the bar steak for his entr\u00e9e - it was cooked perfectly and the red wine buttered sauce--to die for. (It's wine and butter. Of course it's good.) \n\nI had the roasted red snapper, and it was DIVINE. Served with creamy beans and the most flavourful bacon bits I've ever had. The nest of yam on top of the fish provided a nice texture. \nOpted for the gingersnap ice cream sandwich for dessert and again - very good. Not overly spiced, and the ice cream super rich. Comes with chocolate ganache that's extremely decadent. \n\nService: \nImmaculate. Nice, friendly and accommodating staff. Water-level consistently full.\n\nOverall, highly recommend Park Tavern. It might not be your go-to-every-evening-place (as it's around $80-100/person) but it's definitely worth several visits. \n\nPS. Once you're done with dinner, get away from this area asap.

There is no wait before 12pm on any day, so don't need to make a reservation. This was my first time here and I will not be going back. The food is mediocre and the place is not clean. The large area near the windows has a really noticeable fly and gnat problem inside the restaurant. I was really put off by them not keeping the place clean. When I walked in, there were very few people in the restaurant and they put my party in a really bad location; right next to the dishware storage and water/drinks refill area. I thought it was a little rude to do that when the place was empty. We asked to change tables and it too 10 minutes for us to get a different table. Not that the other area was any better because of all the flies nearby. \n \nAside from the initial bad seating, the service was speedy and great. My water was always filled and the waitress always checked on us. The food prices range from $15-20 for entrees and $7-10 for appetizers/small plates. Drink are around $10. The portions were small and the quality of food did not make up for high prices. I found egg shells in my eggs benedict, but didn't to complain because my meal was almost finished. I didn't want them to just throw away the food on my plate and waste it. Honestly, I did not want to sit there any longer because of the flies even if they offered me new eggs. \n\nOver all, I did not have a good experience and food was average.", "author": "Cecile S."}

Everyone from the maitre'd to the waiter to the busboy to the water guy were 100% awesome.  They made me and my pregnant wife feel welcome and happy.  I honestly could not have asked for a more pleasant service experience at a restaurant.  The waiter even knew what my wife could and could not eat being pregnant.  Wow!  Also the ambiance is beautiful with big wood beams stretching across the main dining area, and big windows overlooking Washington Square Park.  Admittedly it doesn't get much better than that.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, was fair..about the same as sister restaurant Marlowe..overrated, and just on the border of being reasonably priced for the neighborhood... but at least the menu was more diverse.  I would say maybe we ordered the wrong things, but given that one of us at the table was pregnant, we basically ordered everything.  \n\nThe brussel sprout chips a la Marlowe are the same, crispy at the top, oily on the bottom.  The clam fritters were more fritter than clam, though the corn salad, fresh corn hushpuppies and grilled avocados that came with the clams were AWESOME.  The sardine toast was ok...good portion and a good balance of salty, sweet, and umami flavors.  A little sweet for my taste, but my wife thought they were the bee's knees! The squash blossom salad was ok, though the ricotta stuffed squash blossoms were fried to the point that i didn't actually recognize or taste the squash.  \n\nAs for the main course, I had the seafood soup which was really disappointing.  All the seafood in it (literally everything) was overdone and a bit rubbery.  The soup itself was overly vinegary.  My wife loved the corn soup.  \n\nAs for dessert, we got the coconut birthday cake and the almond pear crumble with cinnamon ice cream.  Nothing worth noting aside from the cinnamon ice cream being so cinnamon-y it blew out my taste buds for everything else.  \n\nI would try it again, if only for the great service...and hope that maybe it was an off night....", "author": "Adam E."}

Decadent without being heavy which is how desserts should be.\nThe cocktails were amazing.\nSpecifically the Ed's Negroni (Gin) and the Twin Peaks (Tequila) were both a synchronous balance of the booze and the flavors. The way cocktails should be.\nThey also had my wife's favorite wine the Gruner Veltliner.\nSo all in all it was a great night out to celebrate her birthday.\nWe were there for almost 3 hours taking our time between courses and enjoying each other's company.

We were greeted at the host stand and my SIL was wished a happy birthday right away.  That's a nice touch!\n\nWe grabbed some drinks at the bar and waited for our table and got to visually explore the mix of modern and classic style of the restaurant.

Now I really need to make a strong recommendation before I continue....ORDER THE PT FRIES!!!\nThey were amazing, I couldn't get enough!  The fries were seasoned and hot and accompanied by a soft cooked egg to one side and the egg was topped with caviar, it was the perfect dipper!  ON the other side was a truffle aioli.  We ate every single fry.  The waygu jerky was exactly as described, beef jerky....kind of an interesting app.  The deviled eggs were fine, but not something I\"d explore again unless I had a craving although the jalapeno being pickled did add an interesting flavor that I was not expecting.\n\nI ordered the scallops as did the other gentleman at our table and he loved them.  I found them salty and didn't care at all for the way the mushrooms were prepared.  I talked to the server and told him honestly, this dish was not for me.  It may just be my personal taste, but I'd prefer to have pretty much anything on the menu.  He was completely understanding and offered the pork chop.  What at great suggestion, this was one of the juiciest pork chops I have ever tried.  I almost cleaned my plate.\n\nMy sister in law got a steak that was perfectly cooked and the twice baked potato, she was really pleased.\n\nBetween the drinks, apps and entrees we were pretty stuffed, but I always look at the desert menu.

We felt well taken care of during the entire evening, even though our total bill probably didn't come close to a few bar tabs still running inside. \n\nSitting outside also makes for better conversation and we had some good ones. The center of the conversation was MM's fascinating explanation of his new Marker App and tales of travel that have both experienced and wished that I could. The Yelp and Gogobot comparisons came up, as did OCD-fueled writing, and what how virtual social interaction is evolving. And all this engaging interaction timelessly continued while life on this side of Washington Square went walking or whizzing by on this comfortable evening. I knew I eventually had to get in the car and drive back to Pleasant Hill, but I was in no hurry for the evening to end.\n\nBut that did mean that I limited my alcohol intake to a glass of wine.

So, we waited at the bar which was packed with most patrons choosing to enjoy their meal at the bar... a good option for those ill-prepared. And, a nice opportunity to strike up random conversations with strangers toting expensive goods  - got a great tip on a very nice looking iPad case (Mulholland Brothers... there, now I won't forget).\n\nWe were very pleased with the booth Oldman requested; it was in perfect view of the kitchen action. I LOVE watching beautiful food being prepared. Between the kitchen action, the wonderful menu, and the bright shiny objects adorning the Real Housewives, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order.\n\nOldman was set on the burger, after a friend's high recommendation. I wanted to try a little of everything! \n\nOur wonderful meal that night:\n\nDeviled egg with bacon, jalapeno, and chives - excellent (I sopped up whatever lovely sauce was sitting under the egg with their warm delicious bread).\nBrussels sprout chips - Oh my! Absolutely amazing (the housewives and I ended up discussing how we could possibly re-create that dish at home... we were thinking the chips had to have been flashed fried).\nPork Chop served with baby turnips, carmelized apple, AND even more pork... pork belly. Who does that!? I think every restaurant should!\n\"Marlowe\" burger, sans the caramelized onions, with bacon, cheddar, and really nice horseradish aioli and fries.\n \nStandout of the meal had to be the Brussels sprout chips and pork chop. Unfortunately, the friend that recommended this place was a little too slow to text me back with another rec to order their homemade beef jerky! We'll just have to make another visit to try more of their menu.\n\nAfter we finished our meal we were stuffed and in a hurry to get back on the road but, we struck up a convo with the housewives - Oldman just had to know whose birthday they were celebrating, and I just had to know what dessert they were sharing... and, actually ended up fighting over. Turns out it was a \"Boozy Arnold Palmer Float\" (Black tea ice cream, whole lemon gelato, and St.Germain)... are you kidding me! Arnold Palmer is my absolute favorite beverage, and they have made a dessert out of it!?  If it weren't for the booziness factor, I would have knocked one of them over and ran off with it!\n\nTwo thumbs up for PT, and Oldman!", "author": "Kara B."}

The smoked salmon benedict and Marlowe burger are some of my favorites. Bloody Mary's are good too, and served with jerky on the side. As for dinner, I've only been here once but the grilled asparagus salad and crispy lemon chips were amazingly refreshing.

My brunch was absolutely delightful! Since this place is so great, it typically has a long wait, so prepare to wait for an hour if you go during peak hours.  The cool thing is that you can leave your cell phone number with the hostess and go down the street for a cocktail while you wait for your table, and they'll call you when it's ready.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-26", "description": "-Let me start by saying that this was not our first time at the restaurant, and we were considering another spot, but decided to go here because our 14 year old son (who has a better palate than 95% of adults we dine with) was with us for the first time and we thought he would enjoy the ambience.  My husband is a general manager of a popular fine dining restaurant, we are foodies, and we basically came to San Fran to dine and enjoy a different urban scene (we live in Denver). \n\n-The night started out by waiting until 9:20 for our 8:45 reservation - we were offered a drink for apology, but had a reserve bottle of wine from a Napa winery and didn't want to overdo it, so we decided to hold off...and wait...there was another party of 3 that was there before us (we were there on time) - and they had a 9:00 reservation, but were sat a good 15 minutes before us, which we already found odd... the host was apologetic and was trying to take care of us, but we already had too much time to scrutinize the situation, and were feeling a bit unimportant.\n\n-We finally get to our table, and laid our bottle of unopened wine on top of it - our waiter, who seemed super busy and uninterested in us, managed to get our water order, but we didn't see him again until it was time to order the main course.  Another busy waiter came by with our water, we asked him to open our wine as nobody else that passed by saw that we were still waiting, but he had to go check on his own tables first...so we waited again...he was nice enough to get our appetizer order.  \n\n-as an apology, brussel sprout chips (seems to be a theme) and deviled eggs - both of which are not things we typically eat for multiple reasons and ended up barely trying - were brought to us, but nobody asked what we might like to have in the situation... a nice try, but poor execution -  later our waiter said he waved the corkage fee, which we laughed about because we could have opened it ourselves and nobody would have noticed, the waiter didn't open it, and the only glass poured for us was by the other waiter that gave us more service with one stop than our waiter the entire night.  \n\n-To shorten this poor experience, I will sum it up to say that the food was bland, apps were weirdly prepared, salad was drenched in salty salad dressing... the steak, which our waiter could not describe for us, was tough, the side of marrow didn't make sense and wasn't executed well, and my son's steak (who always orders medium rare) was tough and undercooked (have you ever seen a 14 year old growing boy eat part of a steak?) - he actually sent it back because he couldn't chew it, and it came back medium well...but of course that was on the bill... I ordered the chicken, which was good, but it came with a huge amount of heavy stuffing instead of the greens it had last time.\n\n-We saw our waiter maybe 2-3 times, always briefly and rushed, and a little fake - my son was laughing because he felt like he talked to him like he was 5 years old.  We skipped dessert, and my husband (who has NEVER done this) didn't tip - he felt cheated the whole night, and still payed 160$ for food that was just not good.  The hype is there, but they've lost their touch, don't care about anybody that's not VIP, and maybe they should look into their reservation technique, because it didn't work for us more than once, and I've seen several other reviewers say the same.  \n\nWE'VE HAD SO MUCH BETTER IN SAN FRAN, LESS EXPENSIVE, BETTER SERVICE, BETTER AMBIANCE, AND RESPECT...oh, and did I mention that this is fine dining and they can't even manage a bottle of wine?  Not one manager ever came by, if he did, he sure wasn't being a manager....  needless to say, we won't be back, and I would recommend 20 other places before even considering Park Tavern.  Ingredients were probably above average, but execution failed.  The host tried to help us out, he was more of a manager than anything else we encountered all evening.  Denver as a city may be behind in dining, but I can tell you, we are quickly catching up and our hotel rooms are affordable too.  \n\nI've never before left a review, but this one was deserved.\n\n-", "author": "Brooke B."}

It was borderline gross.\n\nSecond food. The brussel chips were good, but I am not a fan of brussel sprouts, so no much can be say about that. The devil eggs had too much onions in it, Wayfare makes a much better one. The lemon chip with burrata was just also okay, the burrata had something mixed into it, so it is not like its normal fresh creamy self. Tomato tart, well, it was more tart, and squash than tomato! I ordered the pork chop, which was done perfectly, but the turnip that came with it was so salty that it was not edible. My friend who was a vegetarian who got a veggie plate that also came with the turnip had the same issues. He ate everything else, and left out the turnip. The steak and fries, seriously for $33, you get less than 4oz of steak? Plus it was overcooked, and it was served in a bowl that it was hard to cut the steak, all and all, an insult to the steak knife we got. Dessert was nothing to ride home about, the cream burlee had too much sugar crust. Seriously I wasn't trying to picky, but pretty much everything missed the mark by a lot. \n\nThird service. It was not bad, but our waiter must be a robot, because he did came and check in with us, and said everything that he needed to say, but he only gave us about half second to responds, and if we missed that, he promptly walked away. It happened a few times, that we thought he was totally strange and just laughed it off. Literally when he came by and ask how our entree was, before I can tell him the turnip is too salty, he said:\" great, thanks\" and walked way. Face palm!\n\nDecor, really great atmosphere. I do like the classic tavern decor. \n\nThe dinning experience was rather disappointing to me.", "author": "Alice C."}

I've always liked the vibe of Park Tavern's dining room but for some reason last night they had the lights so low it was practically dark inside. We had to use our cell phone flashlights to read the menu and noticed others doing the same. The signature Park Tavern cocktail was excellent. However when our entr\u00e9es arrived the dark room prevented us from immediately seeing how poorly presented the food was.  My partner had the lamb chops one of which had a bite of edible meat about the size of a silver dollar and the other which was nothing but an inedible slab of fat. I had the bar steak which dry and over salted. The accompanying truffle fries were reminiscent of greasy garlic fries at the ballpark. When we pointed out the inedible lamb chop entr\u00e9e to the waiter he shrugged and said sometimes lamb chops come out fatty but no problem he would take it off our bill. There was no indication of regret for having served us an inedible meal to begin with or for my partner still being hungry. I have enjoyed dinner here a few times in the past but unfortunately it seems to have gone seriously downhill both in terms of the food and the service. I can't recommend it.", "author": "Steven Z."}

I am applying the three strikes rule and, Park Tavern, yer out!\n\nThere are a few things that are definitely tasty although a bit greasy - the Brussel Sprout chips, for one, are good but very oily at the bottom, the Sommelier (really knows his stuff but most of the bottles are waaaay marked up), and the desserts are good.  \n\nSo, water and Creme Brulee for one, please.\n\nI digress.  In all honesty, when you pay $29 for a \"Bar Steak\", you expect more than 4 chipped off ends of an overcooked steak at one end of the plate with a scattering of french fries to cover the remaining 83% of the plate...oh ok, 84%.  It looked as though my dish had been viciously intercepted by someone hungry on the way to our table and they left me the bits they didn't want.\n\nIt was so off putting - grisly, meager, overcooked chips of meat.  I even took it home in case it was dark at PT, I didn't really see what was on my plate and I could give the meal a second chance.  No WAY!  It looked way worse the next day.  That meal was given a proper burial down the trash (it would have broken the disposal).\n\nThe wine list is very good but the prices are beyond jacked up.  I get there is always a mark up on wine - no problem, but this was kinda silly.  Thankfully, the bottles our table ordered were delicious and numbed the shock of the bill at the end of the unsatisfactory night.  $100 / head....and I had to stop for a burger on the way home...and I don't recall the last time I did that.\n\nCome on, Park Tavern, you can do better than this in SF town.", "author": "Kristina A."}

It was...small. In fact, all of the dishes at our table were small. The french toast came with 3 measly little pieces. The baked farm eggs seemed to imply that there would be multiple eggs, but it looked like just one. \n\nOn the plus side, plating was beautiful and the food was tasty. The salad was fresh and had a nice citrus/dill dressing that was not too overwhelming. \n\nAs a brunch restaurant, I thought it was pretty pricey for the quantity/quality.

Dinner was at 6 and though we arrived to an empty place, by the time our waitress came to take our order the floor was filled with diners. \n\nAfter many recommendations from our waiter, we decided to share a few starters, a side and to each get a different entree so that we made get a taste of everything.\n\nStarters:\n-Demons on horseback\n-Deviled eggs, bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o & chives \n-Brussels sprout chips\n\nOur favorite starters for the night was the Demons on horseback- the melted bacon fat gave the prawns a pop of flavor.

The seared albacore and the pork chop was good too but nothing compared to the hen. \n\nDesserts:\n-Lemon cheesecake parfait \n-Apple & red wine-caramel crisp \n\nLemon cheesecake parfait was creamy and rich. Can't really taste the \"cheesecake\" in this dessert but it was still good. The apple & red wine caramel crisp was a tad bitter, and it is probably because of the red wine. However, the bitterness balanced perfectly with the sweet and tart lemon ice cream that it was served with. \n\nOverall, the dining experience was really delightful.

Our 4+ hours there were so amazing and I cannot wait til I can come here again with the bf.\n\nAs soon as I sat down, I ordered the Moscow Mule.  It's a bit stronger here than I'm used to but still good.  Their drink menu looks very extensive though so I'll be sure to order something else next time.\n\nWe had the much raved-about Deviled Eggs, half with bacon and half without for the vegetarians on our table.  I don't know if it was the bacon but these were so damn delicious.  I loved that it had a little kick from the smoked jalapenos.\n\nThe Brussels Sprout Chips surprised the entire table - who knew that baked vegetables can be so darn good?  It has inspired me to turn every vegetable in my fridge into a chip with the use of olive oil, salt, pepper, and an oven.\n\nThe Lemon Chips with Burrata were okay.  They fried the lemon peel with it so you get a slight bitter taste but it was a refreshing dish.  I'd rather pick the sprout chips.\n\nThe table forced me to pick another appetizer so I asked our waiter what he recommended.  He responded PT Fries and he promised it would be amazing.  I have to say, I was very hesitant because how amazing can fries be?  Yeah well, they can be pretty amazing if you fry them in flavorful truffle oil.  I'm talking about truffle that you can taste, not like other restaurants that call their regular french fries \"truffle fries.\"  On the side was a cracked soft boiled egg with caviar inside, which not only made the dish visually appealing but enhanced the flavor of the truffle oil.  There's also sauce on the side, which I think was some kind of aioli, most likely garlic.  In any event, you don't need it - the fries are perfect as they are.\n\nThe boss wanted the Butter Lettuce Wedge to take a break from all the fried and heavy foods.  The fennel vingaigrette made it a great refresher.\n\nSome people at our table really liked the Cool Roasted Cauliflower but I did not, mainly because of the bellpepper sauce (romesco) the cauliflower laid on.  I'm not a fan of bellpepper so that's that for this dish.\n\nThe boss ordered the Scallops and she was very satisfied with it.  I had a taste and it was just okay for me. Someone else ordered the Sea Bass, which was really good.  The fish was so soft and juicy it melted in our mouths.\n\nI, being a red meat fan, ordered the CAB NY Steak.  For all of you who are immediately captured by the words \"bone marrow,\" just be aware that it's fried kobe beef stuffed back in the bone.  In other words, you're not going to get the creamy, full-flavored deliciousness that is bone marrow.  Trust me, I found out the hard way.  But that is not to say that it wasn't delicious.  It's creative and it was flavorful (though the flavor and texture reminded me a bit of corned beef) but it's kind of a waste to fry perfectly good bone marrow.  The NY steak was done perfectly to my liking - medium rare.  You get two pieces, though I did not need that much since I was popping out of my buttons by this point.  The broccolini and crispy potatoes were also done well.\n\nThough dessert seemed ill-advised and impossible, we still manned up and ordered an Apple Cheddar Crisp and the Chocolate Creme Brulee.  The apple cheddar crisp is really the way to go.  You get ice cream on top of a warm apples with a hint, but not too noticeable, of cheddar.  The creme brulee was a little burnt on the top so we tasted some bitterness but even if it wasn't, I don't think it would've been anything amazing.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time.  We enjoyed our servers a lot (they were all very accommodating and didn't mind when we sat at the bar longer than we needed to) and the food was terrific.", "author": "Linh V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-12", "description": "Greg and I had been wanting to try out Park Tavern for awhile, especially since the American restaurants have been a huge success in San Francisco (namely Wayfare Tavern, Bix, and Baker & Banker) in our opinions.  I took Greg here for an early birthday celebration last Friday night, and I was surprised with how amazing and vibrant the crowd was there.  Usually when I think of North Beach, I think of late night pizza, King of Thai, and cheesy Italian restaurants.  Park Tavern, however, is a total gem right by Washington Square Park.  We showed up to our reservation just about 20 minutes early, so we were prepared to sit until our 9:15pm reservation was ready.  Just as we were getting comfortable at the bar, we got seated!  The whole restaurant is a little on the noisy side, and while normally sitting in the back corner is a bad thing, I actually think that this made the whole experience that much better.  We were shielded away from the noise, and got our own private nook right by the kitchen.  I had done some research on the place (thanks Yelpers!) leading up to this, so once we sat down, I knew almost exactly what I was ordering.  And the decision went as follows:\n-Twin Peaks and Panhandle cocktails.  Personally, I thought my drink (the Twin Peaks) was better than the Panhandle.  But the bourbon and lavender combination in the cocktail was unique and definitely tasty.  \n-One deviled egg. Yes. Just one.  Isn't it awesome that you can order things that way?  Now, Prospect has exactly the same style of deviled egg, and while this one tiny appetizer was amazing, I have to say that the deviled egg battle goes to Prospect.  Still, it was an impressive take on something that is usually meant for Super Bowl finger food.\n-Brussel sprout chips.  It's true Yelpers, this is exactly as awesome as everyone proclaims them to be.  Greg typically doesn't like brussel sprouts (I'm just coming around to them), but the one word we both used to describe these are \"addicting\".  You couldn't just have one without wanting to dig back in and have more.  I would definitely say that this is one of those things where I attempted to clean the bowl without licking it.\n-Classic Angus steak tartare, quail egg, wild arugula & grilled baguette.  In comparing to our previous experiences with steak tartare, this was definitely good appetizer, and I would definitely encourage people to get this, but this comes in second in comparison to Bix's version.  Like I said, the arugula and baguette that comes with the dish is a nice pairing together.\n-Both of us ordered the Marlowe burger and enjoyed every bite of it.  I was tempted to order the Poulet Rouge, except cutting through a chicken that size seemed a little intimidating.  We ate everything on our plate.  And I mean, everything.  For something under $20, I thought this was a complete steal.\n-Earlier on we had ordered the artisanal cheese sampler and asked for it to come out after our dinner.  By that point, I was reaching maximum capacity in terms of stomach space, so I only got to sample a small tasting of each one.  The soft cheese, which was probably goat cheese was my favorite.\n-Normally I stop here and discuss how great of a meal it was, but being that it was Greg's birthday, we couldn't have dinner without a small slice of this month's Birthday Cake.  Yep, they change the birthday cake each month!  This month's sampling was of Doolin's Gingerbread Cake with quince compote & cream cheese frosting.  And really, when you see cream cheese frosting, all of a sudden your stomach has just created a little bit more space for you to try it.  \n\nOur waitress was great, and always made sure we had our glasses full.  I really enjoyed our whole experience there, and thought that it was a great place to take someone for their birthday.  Overall, it doesn't quite overtake Bix or Wayfare Tavern, but this is definitely a solid four star meal.  A big restaurant, a great crowd, delicious food, a wonderful date, and good service.  You really can't ask for more than that on a Friday night!", "author": "Lisa I."}

I am currently attempting to go to a new restaurant every week during the calendar year of 2012.  Park Tavern is restaurant number 3 for me.\n\nAmbiance:  This place is sleek.  Like really sleek.  It has a very sophisticated, 1920s decor.  I was personally absorbed with the vantage point from the front door; to the right you see a very classic bar that has both standing and tall tables, while to the left you have the main dining area.  You may catch yourself being absorbed with the modernly metallic, yet classically appealing lighting, same as you may come to appreciate the intricacies of the tiled floor.  The bathroom is also quite impressive.\n\nService:  Ack, the sticking point.  We ordered about 5 things - two entrees plus three items from the small plates/appetizer menu.  The food came out in a disjointed series of some together, some later on, and some being forgotten.  We sat for a good 15 minutes before our order was taken, and we spent another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived.  Mind you, this was on a Sunday night, but it was the Sunday before MLK Jr. Day, so it was unusually busy.  The bright spot is that when we asked for our Deviled Eggs (the item that never came and had been forgotten), the waiter was kind enough to comp us for it on our bill.\n\nFood:  We came here specifically because of a review that I saw in the San Francisco Chronicle.  We were prepared to be wow-ed if not amazed.  In the end, it was good, but nothing was amazing great.  One item in particular that we REALLY wanted was the Brussel Sprout chips.  They were out (grin).  So we got the Deep Fried Oysters...  They were okay.  We also got the deviled eggs... which were tasty.  We split a burger, and they were kind enough to double up on the fries that came with it, but... nothing about this burger was remarkable.\n\nMaybe next time we'll try different items.

Thanks be to yelp for allowing me to pen a discursive narrative that subverts the stars.\n\nMM and I ventured here this week after realizing that we'd both placemarked it. Made a quick reservation for 8:30pm but arrived an hour earlier hoping to sit at the bar or snag a table. Were the stars aligned for these aspirations? Yes and no.\n\nWe were seated at the communal table and told that we could either dine there or wait, but that we probably couldn't get an earlier seating. Hakuna matata. The place was packed and  it was a vibrant and kinetic scene. Laughter, cocktails en route, discourse, and all that makes a place worthy of your presence. Just after ordering we were told that we could be seated, as there was a last minute cancellation. Wunderbar. We had already ordered drinks but were told that they'd be able to catch our connecting flight to a real table. They failed to be rerouted, but we ordered them again with our waitress, and were soon delivered a gorgeous bourbon sidecar and a negroni for my classy companion that were perfect representations of the ideal.\n\nMM wanted the Mendocino uni with chili served on butter lettuce because I'm from Mendo County. Actually because we both love uni, but the former reason sounds cooler. We soon ordered entrees, mimicking each other and choosing medium-rare Marlowe burgers. The uni came quickly, and was delicious, though didn't need to be served on lettuce as it detracted from the uni. The burgers took over an hour to arrive, because the order was misplaced! It was nice to have time to catch up, but wow, that was a long time. Once the misdeed was realized, several beautiful people dropped by to express their apologies, and the drinks and entrees were graciously compensated. The burgers were perfect as perfect.

With four people you can do a lot of damage so our order storm looked like:\n\n-NY Steak crudo, horseradish, arugula & parmesan\n-Brussels sprout chips\n-Sea salt & vinegar pork rinds\n-Pork belly bites, horseradish aioli\n-House made beef jerky\n-Fried oysters \"Caesar\" salad\n-Yellow Doll watermelon & Mangalitsa prosciutto, truffle & mustard greens\n-Creamed seasonal greens\n-Roasted farmers market peppers\n-Twice baked potato, cr\u00e8me fraiche, cheddar & scallions\n-Anson Mills polenta, roasted nectarines & balsamic glaze\n-Park Tavern \"Poulet Rouge\", Bloomsdale spinach & Peewee potatoes\n-Lamb chops, Merguez sausage, greens\n-Fernet milkshake\n-Seasonal Fruit crumble\n\nDid I say we were having a feast? As to Marlowe's excellence everything was delicious. We finished just about everything. A fantastic meal. Even their cocktail program is excellent. I had a drink I'd never seen before, the County Lawyer,which is a classic throwback to the days of yore. Our server took great care of us and made quite a few great recommendations. I think one of the highest praises you can give a restaurant is that if you can't tell that they just opened, they're doing something right. It flowed like they'd been open for a while. Definitely worth a trip back if you're on this side of town and not already at Marlowe.", "author": "Kim N."}

Park Tavern.  The bathroom was pretty and I love the mosaic design on the walls.  The heavy use of wood evoked warmth and the lighting added to the overall impact of the place. \n\nSome specialty cocktails were available for the event and I had one in particular that was lovely and packed a punch - the Washington Square, which was anything but!  The bartenders were friendly and watching their mixology was like watching mad scientists in a lab. \n\nThey had bar bites which included smoked almonds, house made jerky, and brussels sprout chips (divine).  We also had pork rinds (4505 still wins, but these were pretty darn good) and deviled eggs that may give another \"Tavern\" a run for its money.  Burrata served on lemon \"chips\" with basil was refreshing and yummy.  Fried oysters served atop a lettuce leaf were also good.  The winner...pork belly bites!  Little bites of heaven and triple bypass rolled into one.\n\nI'd like to come back and have a proper meal.  I admit that the food may have played second fiddle that evening -- being part of the intimate affair with some of the industry's bigwigs had me kind of awestruck.

Love it because I think valet helps raise the expectation a bit and lets you really make your dining choice feel like an occasion. \n\nThe decor was lovely but I'm wondering if just a few more noise canceling pieces might help. However, that's really nit-picking because the food was pretty notable that I honestly did not care if the conversation was interesting or not, I just wanted 'one-more-bite'. \n\nFavorite bites were:\nThe Polenta. Hot diggity was it good. Small portion but a good bite doesn't have to be a trough of food. Perfectly crispy on the outside, delicious soft center with very clear flavors. \nThe Hash. Wow, this is not your average interpretation of hash and 100% better for it. My poached egg was lovely and the corned beef devine.

Waiter's suggestion of the deviled egg single toast with pickled jalape\u00f1os, cheese, chicken, and bacon did not disappoint. Not gonna lie either, the fries on the side kind of made my day. I was less impressed with the Brussels sprouts chips, perhaps because it was overhyped on Yelp. In reality, $6 for a bowl of mini Brussels leaves seemed anticlimactic. \n\nCons:\n-Only major major major disappointment was the price to portion ratio. My friend and I were not ravenous or anything. In fact, we were mildly, or normally hungry. However, we were still noticeably hungry after $15 individual brunch plates and a shared side of Brussels chips. A tall and husky guy seated next to us ordered drinks, appetizers, two brunch entr\u00e9es, and ate part of someone's burger!

A fairly new restaurant in the North Beach neighborhood, Park Tavern is spacious and modern, while maintaining a rustic appeal seen in distressed wood ceiling columns. It is restaurant decor that I could easily see Bobby Flay or Tyler Florence embracing.\n\nWhile having a beautiful interior, I have slightly mixed emotions about the food. I sampled a decent selection...some was good and some was easily skippable:\n\n- banana and coconut fritters with raspberry compote: A huge fan of banana served in sweetened preparations, and of coconut in general, I had high hopes for this starter we ordered to share. However, apart from the banana flavor, I tasted nothing but oil from the deep frying process. Coconut was unfortunately absent. Yea it was cool that it was served on a piece of black slate. But for $9? Don't bother with this dish.\n\n- brioche french toast with blackberries and vanilla-maple syrup: I'm not sure why this dsh doesn't have better reviews on Yelp, but it was actually decent french toast (yes, I've had much better, but I could've easily been pleased with this dish). The portion size was ridiculous with two monstruous pieces of brioche. Consider sharing with a friend, else this dish can, and will, overwhelm you with its sweetness.\n\n- cast iron baked farm eggs with baby spinach, gruyere, and prosciutto: Nice menu description, but unless you're Popeye or an extreme spinach-lover, skip it. The spinach is lightly sauteed and very much in its raw form, so its flavor overwhelms the other components of the dish. While an egg dish to begin with, you forget egg is even involved.\n\n- crispy polenta cake with wild mushrooms, poached egg, arugula, truffle salsa verde, and shaved parmesan: Hands down the best dish on the table. Also a large portion size with two large squares of polenta each topped with a poached egg, I actually could've eaten the entire dish had I not been sharing.

Rather than frou-frou, Park Tavern is solid and simple; it is American food:  reasonably priced meat and potatoes, not tarted up fris\u00e9e salad with poached organic, free range quail eggs sprinkled with some esoteric salt harvested by blind one-armed nuns on a remote island in Java.\n\nWith white tiled floors, dark wood paneling, and nicely dim lighting, the frill-free, the dining room is cozy without detracting from the main event:  the food.  Park Tavern is not a place for vegetarians.  It is a meat-eater's restaurant--the kind of place that makes you want to order steak medium-rare.\n\nThe Brussels sprout chips ($6) are so good they will make you forget you are eating a vegetable.  The \"Marlowe\" burger ($13) served with caramelized onions, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli, and fries was tender, juicy, and delicious.  Moist and tender, the Park Tavern \"poulet rouge\", (AKA Cornish game hen, $22) was served on a upright spit with spinach & Peewee potatoes on the side. \n\nWhile the food is good, the bar is not far behind.  High-end, \"mixologist\" cocktails are available, at least six craft brews are on tap, and at least 25 well priced wine selections can be had by the glass or carafe.  \n\nService was spot-on.  Water glasses never went unfilled, dishes arrive with good pacing, and used plates and utensils were quickly removed.  Servers were knowledgeable about the menu, easily answering questions about ingredients and how dishes were prepared.\n\nWith Park Tavern, Weinberg and Puccio have a hit on their hands.

It's located right by Washington Square Park in North Beach, so it's super convenient and popular. \n\nI will say that the service here is great. Our party had a reservation, but we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the waiters to clean the table. In return, we got free brussels sprout chips. Our waiter was also super effusive and happy to explain everything on the menu and make recommendations. He actually recommended one dessert we didn't end up liking, so he comp-ed that. Um, amazing. \n\nAs for the food, I really liked the pork chop. However, the poulet noir was a little underwhelming. The chicken was dry, and for $28, I'd expect something a little bit more special. They also have an amazing dessert menu, so definitely check that out.", "author": "Alice W."}

It was really nice and  refreshing!\n\nOnce we sat down we ordered the brussel chips and devilled eggs.  My best friend and I have always said there should be brussel chips! They were awesome with a slight lemon zest taste and the perfect crunch.  My very picky boyfriend even loved them.  The devilled eggs were some of the best I've ever had.  They use almost the whole egg ether than just half and top it with a generous piece of crispy bacon...ah mazing!\n\nBoth of our entries were really good as well. We got a steak and the burger.

I'm not sure I've ever said this about another restaurant, but I think brunch here actually exceeds dinner. \n\nI guess toasts are already becoming passe, but the toasts here (particularly the one with dungeness crab) are tasty little morsels. Both the sweet and savory brunch options excel: I particularly like the oatmeal-raisin pancakes and the warm, open-faced deviled egg sandwich. \n\nDinner options are well-executed and tasty. The NY steak and Colorado lamb are very good. I like the pork chop a ton, but think I prefer the one at Foreign Cinema. All in all, a great and predictable food experience that could use a dash more creativity. \n\nA couple last notes: I love the space.

The show featured brunch, we went for dinner -- a $108+tip mistake. I ordered the Bar Steak medium rare and my wife the Pan Seared Halibut. The steak arrived in a bowl with the fries. It was blue/rare. I should have returned it but thinking it was a good cut dug in ... I was wrong. I was barely able to cut it with the steak knife and whoever thought it should be served in a bowl obviously never had it themselves. Not sure why there was nerve running though it, but that stuff is like strapping tape. The fries with the steak were good. My wife's halibut was cut very thin and cooked to a crisp leaving it dry with a crust, not pan seared. The mush of vegetables and rice under it was ok once you figured out what it was. The brown butter Brussels sprouts were greasy with what appeared to be a crust from the pan. The Park Paloma tequila cocktail and deviled eggs were both good and kept the meal from being a total waste of time and money. The service was very good. I guess that on Mondays the owner is absent and no one is watching what comes out of the kitchen ... not what you expect from this kind of restaurant. The other reviews say brunch is good, perhaps.

The open door seating was exceptional, the noise on the inside was the typical lunch rush conversations, moderate noise level. We chose to seat inside facing the street. Nice choice. I had previewed the menu on line and pretty much knew what I wanted when I got there. I had the Marlowe hamburger, Hush puppies and the 24oz beer. Our waitress was the BEST ! Her name was Shayna and she was right there serving us and helping us with the little things that we had requested (I wanted my hamburger cut in half). My friend had the steak, arugula salad and a nice wine. We wanted to have coffee and (oh my God) pumpkin cake on the sidewalk seating. Perfect again ! Shayna found us a table and brought us perfection on a plate. We watched the entertainment pass by and people were shopping and returning to work. \nHere's the bottom line, the valet parking works but is a little pricey ($12.00), the food and service is VERY GOOD and fresh, again a little pricey but worth it. The service is fabulous, thanks Shayna. Open air for desert and coffee (priceless) and you car is delivered to the sidewalk when your finished. But when you read the menu, read the lower right corner, which reads that there will be an 8% extra charge for \"City Mandate\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-21", "description": "Ok, I'll just jump right in with the 3 reasons this place is 3-stars in my book.\n\n1) I understand that saturday nights are busy but if you can't provide excellent service to each person you seat, I strongly suggest you put a cap of the number of people allowed in the restaurant. The only reason I remember our waiter is because he kind of looked like Mark Zuckerberg, but I don't remember his name because he never introduced himself and only came back to take our order and ask us if we wanted more booze, in passing like he couldn't even make a full stop. For real?\n\n2) Can you say pretentious? I did about 12 times while seated on the patio watching the other patrons arrive in their maserati's wearing micro mini skirts and bandeau tops grasping the shoulders of the people they were meeting and pulling them in for air kisses saying \"bisoux bisoux!\" I kid you not. This ain't Beverly Hills, lady, take a pill.\n\n3) The food was honestly nothing to write home about. I don't know if it had to do with the rush the kitchen was in, but my pan-seared sole looked great and the fish itself was cooked well, but the flavor was just not hitting the mark for me. The veggies that came on the plate were good, but the sauce tasted like whipped mustardy hollandaise and mayo and I ended up avoiding it a little. The BFs roasted halibut was much better, but made me realize that maybe we're very gifted chefs, as it wasn't in any way better than what we make at home. I think it would have been more enjoyable served on top of a warm salad, and once again, the sauce was a little mustardy or tart, why? The PT fries were very good, the caviar in a soft boiled egg is an idea that we will be using but the horseradish mayo, while cost effective for the kitchen I'm sure, was unoriginal and not particularly enjoyable. My etta's bubbles cocktail was delicious, and paired pretty well with my meal, good job bartender person.\n\nWhile the flame of my love for this place's brunch menu burns on, I will avoid dinner hour here because it turns into a \"see and be seen\" reality tv sideshow, instead of the upscale but laid back place to get a good meal and take in little Italy, that I described to the BF to get him to give park tavern a try. Overall I think the service and food suffered from a focus on quantity over quality and crowd was too \"chic\" to notice, or maybe didn't care. But we found ourselves disillusioned by the experience :/ Oh well...", "author": "Courtney L."}

But the only hard time they gave us was when they warned that only 6 could fit around their round tables.  Really, even with the angel wings, 7 of us fit just fine.\n\nThe food was compelling enough to distract us from bachelorette mayhem.  My faves: \n- Crispy lemon chips with burrata: Just genius.  I thought a slice of lemon, dredged in rice flour, and fried in rice oil would still be bitter (given the pith) but it was uh-maaaaazing!  Someone get me a bag of those chips now!\n- Poulet noir: Others were not so impressed, but this was a creeper dish for me.  The more I ate, the more I realized how excellent it was.  The skin's truffle perfume matched divinely with the moist, tender meat.\n- Parisienne gnocchi: This dish made me swear and shake my fist.  Even after numerous attempts, my gnocchi cannot compare to those light, silky pillows.  Fucking bastards.  Cotogna's gnocchi has now been shoved into second place.\n- And while not as mind-blowing as the above, the brussel sprout chips, roasted chioggia beets, lamb croquettes, and variations of duck were solid and drool-worthy in their own right.  The beets were plated like a gorgeous, smattering of jewels.\n- Mary Etta's Bubbles and Washington Square were very refreshing. \n- Finally, deviled eggs: everyone else's eyes rolled back in their heads.  But as an oenophobe, I can't comment.\n\nI wasn't as impressed with the leafy salads, halibut, jerky (I don't think this is a worthy expression of Wagyu), the squash soup du jour, strawberry-rhubarb shortcake, nor banana split.\n\nService was impeccable (aside from the initial resistance to seating 7 people).  Valet at $12 was totally worth it.  And our waiter was terrific.   He comped us a scoop of chocolate ice cream with cocoa nibs.

Honestly, I was pretty tired, so don't remember too many details besides how yummy it was.

Atmosphere was excellent especially on the night we came which was a warm, bright summer night where Washington Square was bustling.\n\nWe ordered a variety of appetizers ranging from gnocchi, carrot salad, corn soup, PT fries, fruit de mers, and demons on horseback.  Overall the appetizers were good and probably worthy of coming back for.  For entree, fish, poulet noir, pork chop, burger and duck.  The portion on the duck was small and my brother said it was on the salty side.  My dad's pork chop wasn't good, he left half of it on the plate.  The fish, I forgot what kind of fish, was decent but on the salty side.  The burger which is supposedly the best burger in town is not the best burger in town.  What was most disappointing were the fries that came on the side.  There were probably twelve pieces of fries, as if half the order was missing.  The poulet noir, had a good truffle aroma but that's about it.  It's a small piece of chicken, the greens on the bottom were swimming in oil which isn't exactly enticing.\n\nWe ordered the birthday cake since it was my mom's birthday and let's just say we were glad that wasn't our actual birthday cake.\n\nWhen the bill came, we noticed a bottle of wine for $42 which we didn't order.  The waiter apologized and said he gave us the wrong bill but you know what, everything that was on bill was ours except for the bottle of wine.  I don't know if he was trying to pull a fast one or made a mistake but that was definitely our bill unless another table had exactly the same things we had which seems unlikely.  \n\nI would say it was somewhat of an average experience.  I want our mom's birthday dinner to be great but it was well short of that.  We asked for more bread plates since they took ours away and they never came back with it.

We arrived at 8:15 for our reservation and were told they were running behind. We went to the bar to grab a cocktail, and were seated 20 minutes later. It was the perfect opportunity to try one of the many specialty cocktails they make. \n\nI went with the Twin Peaks drink which was a Four Roses drink and I actually didn't like it at all. It was way too sweet for my taste. I asked the bartender to add something to take some of the sweetness away, and he graciously made me a totally new drink that had more lemon and I really enjoyed. My husband got the classic manhattan, it was made very well. \n\nOnce we were seated we ordered the scallop, shrimp and crab salad since we knew we were going to both get beef for our entrees. I really enjoyed it.  Very light way to start the meal. I then got the Bar Steak, which was served with french fries. It was cooked perfectly rare, just the way I ordered it. The steak was seasoned perfectly. Overall it was very good, I was just wishing the juices form the steak didn't get all over my delicious fries. Maybe the fries in a dish would prevent this. \n\nThe It's It dessert was the best. Mint ice cream with crunchy cookie crumbles and a hard shell on top. I highly recommend it! The service was also attentive, friendly and help with suggestions.", "author": "Natalie N."}

When you go, you'll know the one we were at. It turned out to be a great spot for people watching, drinking and dining. I would not have changed a thing.\n\nUpon arriving, we were greeted with champagne and the restaurant's signature deviled eggs. These are not your Aunt Myrtle's deviled eggs. These flavorful deviled eggs benefit from the picked jalapeno and piece of thick smoky bacon on top. They were terrific and I could easily see us going back just to have a pint of Anchor Steam and those eggs. But, last night we forged on.\n\nThe next course was porcini mushroom soup. As you know, mushroom soups are usually cream flavored with mushroom. Not at Park Tavern, this was a dense, flavorful, all mushroom cup of soup served with a garlicky piece of sourdough with parmesan on top. Very earthy and perfect for a chilly evening.\n\nThen came prawns wrapped in lardo, which is of course thin petals of fat. The fat actually cooks off so all you are left with is the smoky essence of the lardo on the very fresh, perfectly cooked prawns. This was a winner. The lemon chips with burrata were good, though not earth shattering. The signature brussel sprout chips were not available, because it's not like you can just go down the street and buy brussel sprouts at any market at this time of year. Oh, wait, you can.\n\nFor our entrees, we tried a little of everything. The steak is actually a New York served with braised Kobe beef on the side. I was wondering why a chef would braise Kobe and drain all the fat out of it since Kobe beef is all about the fat, but the plate was one of the first to be cleaned completely. The first member of the clean plate club was the pork chop, which is served on ribs that must be picked up to be fully appreciated. \n\nTwo of us had the seared scallops served on greens with these amazing beans served pieces of pork belly. I loved mine while the other diner found her's to be too salty. If you like salty pork belly, then this is probably a great dish for you. If you are looking for a light seafood dish, then this may be too hearty and salty for you.\n\nFor sides, we had twice baked potatoes, which are not for people shy about flavor and fat, and wild mushrooms. I personally thought the wild mushrooms were the winner. They were oven roasted with thyme and rosemary and had a simple, earthy flavor I really enjoyed. They went great with the beans and pork belly that came with the scallops. \n\nFor drinks, a couple of us enjoyed the Southern Lawyer, which is little more serious Knobb Creek take on sweet vermouth and bitters than your standard Manhattan. The fresh orange peel in the drink just makes it. You need two of these.\n\nThe service was professional, responsive, always there when you wanted them to be, yet laid back and unpretentious. We never felt rushed and our server was happy to guide us to his favorites without sounding condescending. \n\nThe atmosphere, as advertised on Yelp, is indeed trendy and casual at the same time. \n\nThe wine list is not for bargain hunters. Plan on spending $70+ for a mid-range bottle of wine. \n\nSo, if you are one of the cool ones, or, like myself, aspire to be surrounded by people cooler than yourself, I'd recommend Park Tavern for a romantic evening or a fun place to bring your group of friends.", "author": "Eric W."}

Worth eating with a shot of tequila.\n\nAny of the meats work, including the steak all the way down to the burger.\n\nOverall the appetizers are worth sharing; I'd do 7-8 sharing plate among a few people.  Because the freakin' everything is awesome: Brussels sprouts chips, fries, shrimp/prawn (whatever, they're good), tartare, foie gras.  By the time my steak arrived it was anti-climatic.

Since our meal was last minute, we weren't able to get a reservation and ate at the communal table. This was a perfect solution and was great. \n\nFavorite food item: For sure, for me it was the venison carpaccio. Slices venison, small bite size deep friend bone marrow, and a nice portion of steak tartare made this wonderful. Lots of hidden little flavors that popped out along the way. \n\nGnocchi was another win. Delicious and light. \n\nWe also had the scallops and the sole. I am not sure in the future I would have ordered both of them. The sole was a little heavy and I was hoping for something lighter. By the end of that meal, I was a bit over salted, and I love salt. I think I would have ordered one or two more appetizers. \n\nThe waiter picked our dessert. (We like surprises!) When it came and I had a bite, I immediately was transported to my Bay Area childhood days- a restaurant version of an Its It. Combined with a pot of french pressed coffee and some good conversation, it was a really good night and very delicious. \n\nI can't wait to go back.", "author": "Danielle V."}

It's basically impossible to get a reservation, but we decided to go and eat at the bar, which turned out to be a lot of fun. The bartenders are so friendly and helpful, and they sat us almost immediately. I ordered the Mclaren (Hendrick's Gin, cucumber, lemon & ginger beer) which was delish. We decided to try a bunch of things on the menu, which ended up being a great idea. For starters, we ordered the venison carpaccio, the deviled eggs, and the brussels sprout chips. The carpaccio wasn't that great, and there was too much onion on it. The deviled eggs were fantastic though, and the chips were also very good. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the poulet noir and my date ordered the mussels, cockles and clams. The chicken was AMAZING (caps are necessary here). I actually finished the entire chicken, and wow, the truffle flavor! And that stuffing! And that juiciness! Almost too much to handle. Seriously though, if you don't like food really salty, or think that truffles can be overpowering, I would not suggest this dish. It was verrrry flavorful. Thankfully I can't get enough of salt, so it worked out in my favor. The mussel dish was also delicious, especially the broth! And the bread, which is soo good, is the perfect way to sop it all up. When the dish first arrived we noticed that a good number of clams/mussels were still closed, and when we brought it to the bartender's attention, he immediately brought them back to the kitchen and we were given a new bowl. We also ordered a bottle of white wine which was reasonably priced and perfectly complimentary to the meal.\n\nI really appreciated how attentive the servers were. They knew when to step in, and when to give us time. They also knew the menu inside and out. While the meal as a whole might be worth 4 stars, the service and overall ambiance makes it a 5.

I rarely ever say this, but everything is amazing. However, the dessert lacked. There were only 2 choices and they were both slices of cake. We chose the Yellow Birthday Cake and it was decent.

Candidly, ordering it in such a nice setting concerned me by perhaps passing up on more adventurous items.\n\nPro move: Consider limiting your prior meals to build the hunger. You'll enjoy the additional time, and of course the food and drink, at Park Tavern.\n\nDemons on Horseback? Yes, of course. Fried sunchokes? Most definitely. Smoked deviled eggs? No, but only because I've eaten them so often at Marlowe. Seared scallops? Oh, they were excellent. Grilled pork chop. Nom nom. \n\nYes, the burger was not my only entree.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-22", "description": "*3.5 stars*\n\nPark Tavern is designed to be perfect for any occasion -- birthdays, business meetings, catchups with friends, anything. It has a great atmosphere, thanks to the excellent design of the place. \n\nThe service was absolutely incredible. From the hostess to the bar server to our wonderful dining server, Emily, everything was on-point. We had to add 2 people last-minute to our table, and Emily graciously and happily helped us move to another table halfway through our meal. It really made our experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe food was a hit or miss for us. I'm a fan of Marlowe, so I was expecting the same level of excellence here, but it was just lacking a bit when compared to Marlowe.\n\n----------------------------\nFOOD:\n\nDeviled Eggs = Delicious. Everything goes together perfectly.\n\nBrussels Sprouts Chips = Addictive as always. Can't go wrong here.\n\nPT Fries = Good, but nothing spectacular. The caviar wasn't salty enough to bring the flavors together between the egg yolk and the aioli. Half of the fries were overfried.\n\nGrilled Pork Chop = Tender for the most part and had a pure flavor to it. It wasn't exciting, but it was definitely a well-cooked pork chop.\n\nMussels and Clams = This was good, but again, nothing exciting.\n\n3 Variations of Duck = I had high hopes for this one, but again, it fell short. The duck breast was a bit dry, the duck confit was a bit overcooked, the duck skin wasn't crispy enough, and the duck liver mousse was too watery. The flavors were all there, it just could've been so much better. Plus, the beans didn't really add anything beneficial to the dish.\n\nVenison Tartare = This dish was a great attempt, but was definitely lacking in execution. The beef tartare was good, but it was missing something with a bit more umami (for instance, it could've used some sesame oil or quail egg). The deep-fried bone marrow is an interesting idea, but was completely lackluster in execution. The bits of bone marrow was easily overpowered by the breading and it just tasted like fried oil.\n\nHamachi Crudo w/ Gin & Tonic = This dish wasn't good at all. There was no depth or excitement whatsoever -- it needed a couple of extra layers of flavor (something salty, something tangy) to really make the hamachi pop. Unfortunately, it ended up being just a bland, strange mixture of flavors between the overpowering cucumber, the bland gin & tonic ice, and the nonexistent flavor of the hamachi.\n\n----------------------------\n\nAll in all, Park Tavern is a good space with a great bar and phenomenal service. I'd definitely come back for some drinks and small bites. The food, however, just doesn't match up to everything else.", "author": "Roy C."}

We sat down at the bar area, and someone cleaned the table right away, someone else got us our menu and water. The waitress, Aura, and all the other people were friendly, helpful, attentive, and fast. We had our waitress but I there were about 5 people filling the water, serving food, getting drinks, taking plates, etc.\n\nEven though service was fast, we weren't rushed at all, and I like how they took care of us.\n\nI ordered the Poulet Rouge, which is game hen standing on top of spinach and peewee potatoes. Sauce was good, meat was juicy, but the spinach was salty. If you eat the chicken with the spinach I guess the salt is balanced out. I was happy with my dish! $28\n\nDad ordered the scallop. We laughed at his plate, because he had 3 little scallops with some veggies decorating the plate. Fancy-Schmancy! My dad likes a hearty meal and more bang for your buck, but he defended his dish. The scallop did taste very good, and the salt was more balanced than mine. Dad approves. $29\n\nMum ordered the bar steak, which came with fries. Steak was good, but she did not like the red wine sauce. Too bitter for her taste. The fries were good, but she was upset the sauce was soaked into the fries. Might have been better for her if the sauce was on the side, or the fries on a different plate. $27\n\nThe coffee was good. Did not need sugar or cream. It went well with the July Birthday Cake, and it was fun blowing out the candle, even though none of our birthdays is in July. The lemon poppy cake wasn't really standout, but the apricot on top made it a treat! $8 and $9\n\nAfterwards, it was funny to think how we got to Park Tavern. We originally came to Little Italy, to eat at Original Joe's, but we passed on it, because we thought it was too expensive and 20 minutes too long a wait, not knowing all the pizza places had even longer waits and all the other restaurants were just as expensive. So we ended at Park Tavern, which is more pricier than Original Joe's. The food and service though was worth it. And it's nice to treat your family to good food once in a while. Especially if Dad is picking up the tab!\n\nOverall, Park Tavern was a good place to eat, and I would definitely suggest it as a place to take visiting family and friends.", "author": "Poiuytrewq A."}

The Crispy Lemon Chips are great too. They throw a little black sea salt on the burrata cheese so each bite has good flavor and just a slight tang. With all this heavy savory appetizers, it's nice to have a little green on the table. I love the snap peas in the Sweet Baby Lettuces salad. You can taste the dijon in the vinaigrette and it's refreshing - especially if you're planning on having the steak! Unfortunately, the steak wasn't as exciting as the rest of the meal. Far too smoky for my taste. Not sure if there was some extra worcestershire sauce in the meat or au jus but i preferred the Red Snapper. Healthier, yet still outdone by the classics AND sides. I often roast brussel sprouts at home and still wanted to eat the entire dish at the restaurant. The twice baked potato surprised me in that it came in a scalloped potato plating. It was great, probably due to all the room that created for creme fraiche, butter and cheddar cheese. For dessert, i enjoyed the August Birthday Cake which could have been made for me! It was the lightest coconut flavored cake with lemon curd and plenty of whipped cream. I only stopped at 1.5 slices because we ran out of dessert at the table..

The mushrooms were also good, although a bit salty.\n\nOur entrees were fine, but didn't live up to the soup.  My wife had the scallops, which came with beans, kale and pork belly.

Although most tables around us were munching on squash blossoms, we opted in for the lemon chips with hummus dip.  So glad we went for that! The thinly sliced chips combined the crispiness of a potato chip with the lovely fragrance of a lemon. Refreshing and tasty!\n\nThe famous deviled eggs did not disappoint. Nice kick from the jalapeno bits inside and the bacon on top gave it a nice texture and additional flavor.\n\nMy entree, the red snapper, itself was okay.  I really was hoping black cod would still be on the menu, but it wasn't.  The bed of cabbage and leeks the fish sat on was incredibly flavorful.  That alone I can eat again and again. \n\nOne of us had the halibut which came on a nice bed of corn risotto.  The corn risotto was so smokey and sweet, again, made the fish itself pale by comparison.\n\nAnother friend got the Marlowe burger. I am not a burger eater so I didn't try but she said it was worth the hype as well, being very moist. \n\nSome unknown birdie must have informed the restaurant that it's one of our birthdays.  Wasn't the intention of our dinner get-together, but one of us does have a birthday coming up next week.  The restaurant generously sent us a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. And when I say generously, I mean, the cake was large! It was delicious, but the four of us didn't finish it!\n\nI would absolutely come back again.

At Park Tavern, you really must. \n\nWhile this place looks like the kind of dimly-lit bar your pa or grandpa might frequent (complete with soft-rock soundtrack, at least on the night we visited), the menu's all inventive and modern. Crispy, salty lemon chips pair up with fava been puree for an appetizer that's cooly creative. A seasonal seafood plate aims to boot charcuterie off your plate and and back to 2009. The corn soup is surprisingly creamy and flavorful, and perfect to go alongside something fresh and fishy. And the only thing stopping me from calling the deviled eggs \"divine\" at this point is my desire to avoid too much cloying alliteration in this paragraph. \n\nIt's the kind of place that makes you feel guilty for ordering a burger, but since I come from an amoral, bohemian-type background, I was able to move past these feelings and do it anyway.

Its very light and perhaps not the best pairing with the deviled egg-flavor bombs.\n\nBrussel sprout chips:  Solid.  \n\nCrab and lobster bisque:  The first 3 bites of this soup were orgasmic.  The remainder was more of a struggle-- its a VERY rich, flavorful soup.  I literally don't think I could finish this bowl on my own.  \n\nRabbit and lardo terrine:  At first too simple, but actually when you mix all the components on the dish (er, slab of slate)-- mustard and spicy arugula-- it elevated it.  I could have used some kind of a cracker type thing to go with.\n\n\"Marlowe\" burger:  This is where you really lost us, PT.  THE BUN WAS NOT GOOD.  Like, really, I'm not even being picky.  Its just a bad bun.  Crumbly and dry with no give, it really ruined the burger.  My husband has had the Marlowe at Marlowe and he says their bun was 100x better.  The burger was good but I couldn't tell because I was so angered by the bun.  The fries on the other hand, made me very happy.\n\nMay birthday cake (cappuccino): Tasted like refrigerator.  Kind of like, supermarket cake with half the sugar and better frosting.  Love the idea though!\n\nNext time, if there is one, I want to eat 4 deviled eggs and those $20 french fries.", "author": "Kristin P."}

Let's just say the crowd lacks diversity.\n\nWith that said, just about everything we ordered was tasty. The starters were great. In fact, we were considering ordering nothing but starters, since their menu descriptions were quite appetizing.\n\nMy entree was the pork chop. A thick, double cut, pork chop. Let me tell you... I was reluctant to order it, not because I dislike pork (quite the contrary, as pork is my favorite protein when done right), but because pork is all too often done poorly at nouveau American joints. I'm not sure what prompted me to actually order it this time, but I'm sooooo glad I did. This was one of the best pork chops I ever had. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, the flavor was full and smokey, it was fatty but not excessively so, and it was quite juicy.\n\nI will end it right there before I drool on my keyboard.", "author": "J K."}

We had the deviled eggs.  Maybe we expected too much after all the rave reviews, but our table found them overly salty.  The egg flavor got lost among the bells and whistles of jalapeno, bacon, and chives.  Good, as any deviled egg will be, but not amazing.  We also shared the smoked burrata and heirloom tomato appetizer.  It was delicious, but the portion was tiny!  Our table of four had to share three tiny tomato slices, draped with prosciutto and burrata, and two pieces of dry toast.  I'm no glutton, but three tiny tomato slices seemed a bit meager.\n\nFor entrees, the seafood special was good - scallops, bay scallops w/ crumb top, calamari, and octopus.  Again, not better than anywhere else, but good.  The whole roasted chicken was good, but pretty much equivalent to any other roasted chicken.  The spinach at the base was disgustingly greasy, just swimming in chicken grease which really is not as good as you'd think.  The halibut was a little sad.  A diminutive portion of fish arrived on a big, long white plate with some legumes scattered about.  It did not inspire excitement and tasted just okay.  The pork chop, on the other hand, was thick, juicy and tender.  The only dish, I felt, that lived up to what we expected of the restaurant.\n\nWe departed not hungry, but a little disappointed in the food.  Also, be warned - this place is a definite scene.  Not everyone is going to enjoy and/or feel comfortable in this type of scene.  Most people will figure out whether they want to stay or go as soon as they get there.  On the plus side, the servers are very attentive and warm.", "author": "Pearl L."}

It has a lively, bustling atmosphere, with a noise level that might be too much for some, but I found energizing.  The crowd also feels very \"established\", as in moneyed, but in that casual San Francisco way. \n\nCocktails are delicious and range from the classic to the inventive.  I enjoyed the Country Lawyer, a bourbon cocktail with a dash of chocolate bitters as a subtle surprise.\n\nWe shared numerous appetizers, with my favorite being the Deviled Eggs, the Lemon Chips with Burrata, and the Uni.  I was disappointed with the Brussels Sprouts Chips, which were not as crisp as I would have liked.  Without even knowing that it's the same restaurant team behind Marlowe, I said \"They have these at Marlowe and they are much better\".\n\nMy dinner was good - seared black cod. Next time I would get the Poulet Rouge, which comes standing upright (like beer can chicken).  Unfortunately, my friend's halibut was not good and we sent it back, but luckily there was plenty for her to eat from our dishes.  They were very professional about it and offered another dish, and didn't charge us for it.\n\nThe desserts were just ok - we had the Chcolate Creme Brulee and another one I can't quite remember.   Next time I am getting the Fernet with a Ginger Back! \n\nThe service was very polished and friendly, so I would feel comfortable taking anyone there, from a rowdy group of guys to my in-laws.   \n\nAll in all, a solid experience, and a place where everyone all around us seemed to be having a good time.", "author": "Liz S."}

But when the waiter announced the special was salmon I decided to try it. I was not disappointed. In fact  it might be the best salmon I have ever had. It was served with some kind of creamed corn and mushrooms which were delicious. Atmosphere was very nice and upscale.

If you are a waitress or waiter in the city, you need to know this. It's the basics. When I received the ahi tuna, I could immediately see that it had been overcooked. Usually ahi is this nice pink and this was almost pink-brown. Not a good look for ahi tuna. Also, whatever they had grilled the veggies with tasted like burned rubber. It was just not good.

The food and drinks were outstanding but what really put it over the top was the opportunity to sit in the best seats of the house- the chef's table. \n\nComing in on a Saturday night without reservations can be risky, but luck was on our side! We could have sat at the communal table at the bar, or at the chef's table- which is on the side toward the restrooms...but you get to see all the chefs working their magic and creating magnificent looking dishes. They work very efficiently and the plates they're carefully assembling look mouthwatering and absolutely beautiful. It made dining at Park Tavern dinner and a show. When I come back I only want to sit here! \n\nThe food didn't disappoint either. Some of the chefs were laughing at us because we were outright enjoying our food so much! We started with the brussel sprout chips which were AMAZING! I could seriously eat these all day, everyday. They were nicely seasoned and fried for just the right amount of time. Next, we got the duck liver mousse which was smooth and flavorful. (Note: different from foie gras, but a perfect alternative now after the state ban). The plate comes with two generous spoonfuls of the mousse, cherries, pistachios and grilled bread. Finally, we got the burger. Mmmm...from the first bite you can immediately tell all the ingredients are high quality and it just melts in your mouth! There are fries with a horseradish dip that accompany the burger which also were perfection.\n\n From there, there wasn't much more room for dessert and we really wanted to try the Birthday Cake- so I'll be back soon for the brussel sprout chips and a slice of cake!", "author": "Christine A."}

We were seated promptly at our designated time. \n\nAmbience: hip, lively crowd on a sunny Sunday afternoon.\n\nService: Attentive in spite of the packed restaurant; wait service saw that we were chatting away and pretty much left us alone after food arrived, but did refill water, take away dirty dishes, etc., just didn't bug us with the bill.\n\nFood:\nFirst came the banana coconut fritters. Had really high hopes for this one but was too doughy inside and not much banana flavor. The accompanying raspberry sauce was delicious, though. The chocolate sauce was just OK, but combined with the raspberry sauce made the fritters a little more palatable.\n\nThe much raved deviled egg was a yummy combo of deviled egg topped with pickled jalape\u00f1o and bacon, if you're into that kind of flavors. But at $2.50 a pop, which is essentially 1/2 an egg, maybe good to try once unless you have deep pockets.\n\nThe dungeness crab toast points (three per order) was a disappointment. Too much lemon juice or something rendered it very tart. I thought I was eating sour toasts. Geez, leave the dungeness crab alone...it tastes good without working too much into it, just mayo salt & pepper is all it takes, really. \n\nThe brioche french toast was excellent. Served with a blueberry compote/syrup, it was nice and crispy around the edges with a custardy center...yum!\n\nThe chorizo scrambled eggs was also very nice, with just a small kick. Scrambled eggs cooked the French way, which was creamy and perfect to my taste.\n\nDidn't try the duck egg sandwich part, but I did steal a few french fries from my friend's plate and they were yummy...so good that I had to polish off what was left on her plate.\n\nA great place to hang out with friends.\n\nParking is hard to find.

I don't think I've ever found myself situated around so many well-to-do older men and their diamond-studded escorts in my 29 years on this planet before a recent stop into PT. Sitting at the bar alone (it's how I roll at times) and overhearing some of the conversations that only wealthy people could ever relate to made me feel so bad for less-fortunate members of our society, I actually seeked out the nearest panhandler and gave him a $5 bill upon exit. It made me feel roughly 99% better than I did before I left the bustling traditional American juggernaut across the street from Washington Square Park.\n\nAside from a pretty stuffy hang and an hour-long wait just for a single seat at the bar (it's not their fault they make delicious food that many, many people want to eat), Park Tavern is worth its weight in gold. Being a fan of Marlowe since they opened in SOMA, I knew right off the bat I'd be a fan of their latest project taking over the old Moose's space in North Beach. \n\nIf I were on a deserted island and you were to ask what five foods I'd want around me at all times, you'd find deviled eggs somewhere towards the very top of that list. And when I heard rave reviews from friends and colleagues alike about their version of the classic comfort food item, I just had to get in there and try them at any cost. Sure enough, while not as good as the deviled eggs at Wayfare Tavern in my opinion, they didn't disappoint. They were spiced up with jalape\u00f1o and bacon, and a sweet element that I couldn't quite put my finger on (but added a nice, unexpected twist). Upon future visits, I'd order these every single time.\n\nIn addition to the deviled eggs, I had to tackle a couple of their other standout bar bites: the brussels chips, and the demons on horseback. The latter features grilled shrimp wrapped in lardo and grilled in olive oil until the fat melts into the outer layer of the crustacean. It comes accompanied with slices of cucumber dotted with a black pepper buttermilk cream sauce that adds a nice visual touch to the smokey snack. It was fantastic (as I'd hope at a price point of $13 for four of them total). Regarding the brussels chips, there's not much I can say except you'd be a lunatic not to order these if you find yourself splurging on Stockton. The delicate leaves of the brussels sprouts are separated from the hearts, grilled, and doused in olive oil. For such a heavily-oiled appetizer, it's a light snack that packs an intensely flavorful punch. Perfect for sharing, or in my case, devouring every last piece until you're left with nothing but glistening fingertips, an empty wooden bowl, and a defeated soul. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that the cocktail program is as good as any in the city as well. They have a scaled down list of craft cocktails that concentrates on the classics, and they have a few Park Tavern originals as well. They also boast a nice-sized wine and beer list for folks looking to avoid the hard stuff.\n\nIt's about as far from my comfort zone as it gets, but Park Tavern rewards with a truly memorable epicurean experience. I've been an Anna Weinberg fan ever since I shared a symposium panel with her before SF Chefs in 2010, and while I'm not even close to the bullseye of their core demographic, Park Tavern will be on a short list of special occasion hangs for ol' Ruggeford H.

Genuine, heart felt and hungry. \n\nOur group began with a special unlike anything I've ever experienced. While fries may not seem extraordinary, the imagination of Puccio delivered. \n\nTruffle fries nested on a plate, accompanied by a 3/4 eggshell which contained a creamy yolk cr\u00e8me topped off with caviar. The rich gravy coated each fry with a decadent cloak, which was only elevated by the delicate black ornaments of caviar.\n\nKetchup just lost the rose ceremony...\n\nThe house made charcurterie plate was a brilliant display of craft, and the duck liver crostini was a marvel. If you didn't feel guilty, you weren't enjoying it.\n\nThe grilled pork chop with dinosaur kale and toasted garlic served as the entree.\n\nFork to protein brittle, and matched with timed seasoning, the pork is a hit. Every note was selected with purpose, and the dish proved itself a phenomenal keeper.\n\nPark Tavern is a mature adoption of another of my Weinberg favorites, Marlowe, and if this type of re-imagining continues, Anna might just have to run for Mayor.\n\nBravo.", "author": "Mike K."}

I have been here twice and each time, i had wished that I just ordered an assortment of appetizers instead of my $30 entree that I didn't love. This past visit I ordered the halibut(one of the two pescatarian items on the menu. No vegetarian item entrees and the other fish entree had bacon in it) the portion was extremely small and my favorite part ended up being the corn that sat underneath the fish. It just didn't have much seasoning or any sauce.(on a side note, my friend ordered the pork and he loved it. and the portion was HUGE). I know their menu is seasonal so i may have better luck next time.\n\nThe hostess staff is excellent. I know they are always busy and you always need to have a reservation but when the 4 of us walked in, they were able to seat us immediately outside under a few heat-lamps and provided blankets. wonderful. :)\n\nI was disappointed in our server. He seemed a little out of it. We ordered drinks and they took close to 20-25 minutes to get them. When we ordered our second round of drinks, again it took close to 20 minutes. Our bill was almost $300 and we couldn't get our drinks. IT was just weird. The whole meal process was very long....\n\nOn the upside, i love the appetizers. The brussel sprout chips, marinated olives and devilied eggs are yummy. I can't wait to try the crab dip and the cornmeal crusted oysters :)", "author": "Whitney S."}

Or just a perfect place for reunion or sex-and-the-city kind of brunch.\n\nService was good and not overwhelming; parking was tough but there's $10 brunch valet. \n\nUnfortunately it was hard to love the food here. Our crab toast was delicious but there was't sufficient crab. Veal Schnitzel sounded much nicer than how it really tasted. Surely bacon fat eggs that accompanied the veal sounded delicious but there was nothing special with the taste. Perhaps the concept was similar to duck fat french fries but was not good once implemented. Even worse, the schnitzel seemed like something you can fry it yourself at home. \n\nThe dessert on the other hand was quite good. \nTCHO chocolate creme brulee was not your regular brulee because there wasn't hard sugar to coat the creme. The taste was decent and the salt was a good touch. Panna Cotta with orange was good but also not great - you could possibly find the same dessert at other joint. \n\nAll and all, Park Tavern has a warm ambience for intimate dinner.

The yummy, cheesy twice-baked potato topped off our American Heart Association recommended meal. \n\nI also give extra star power to the lively, lovely space the new proprietors have created. Also of particular note: these folks seem to be making a point to pay attention to the neighborhood, it's long-standing businesses, those who live here.

Overall, I give it a 4/5.  Great food and lively atmosphere (if you're looking for that).  Service so-so.\n\nMade reservations a month in advance, as it's gotten quite popular of late.  Upon entering, you get this feeling of stepping into a huge space (for SF at least) and very energetic (read loud).  Most of the time I felt like I was yelling to my friends.  There was a lot of \"what did you say?\".  In any case, we were seated promptly.\n\nFood (apps)\n* brussel sprout chips - probably my favorite app there.  I could see myself sitting in front of the tv scarfing these down.  although, after eating a bunch, they def. started to get salty.\n* beef jerky - nothing special, other than the fact that you can order beef jerky at a restaurants\n* watermelon, feta, olives - this dish was ok, i'd pass next time\n* seasonal fig dishes - if you like figs, elegantly put together and very balance in flavor\n* demons on horseback - very well put together bacon wrapped shrimp.  I love bacon and i love shrimp, so how can you go wrong.  \n\nFood (entrees)\n* Grilled pork chop - next to the roasted chicken \"Poulet rouge\", this was a very delicious pork chop.\n* Poulet rouge - striking presentation, a small whole chicken served in cast iron, upright.  look for the images  you'll see what i mean.  Very flavorful and moist, rounded out with spinach and mini potatoes.\n\nService - so so.  Perhaps it was a busier night than normal, perhaps it was a relatively new waitress.

My hubby is always scanning the Sunday paper or reading articles online about the newest places to eat local and in NYC (for our treks to the big apple). So this year since we couldn't be in New York for our Anniversary he'd been wanting to go to the Park Tavern. So he surprised me with making the reservations 3 weeks in advance (Go dude!).\nIt was pouring rain when we arrived for our Friday night 7:30 reservation, but no worries with $11 valet. We were seated in a small corner seat. Our waiter got our drink orders out to us right away, and we ordered some starters while trying to decide what to order. We heard the deep fried bussel sprouts and deviled eggs were really good, the deviled eggs come with a small slab of bacon and a slice of jalapeno. WoW! Spicy, fatty and rich. The  deep fried brussel sprouts were crisp and airy and melted in your mouth (a tad salty) but delicious. \nWe decided for an appetizer we'd share the truffle fries with caviar and a soft boiled egg? (I know, talk about cholesterol overkill...hey it was our anniversary).\nNever waited more than 10 or 15 minutes between each dish. We both decided to throw caution to the wind after all the other starters and go for the Fillet Mignon with twice baked potato. It came with a wine sauce and it was pretty much \"I've died and gone to heaven...\" delicious. Whoa.....but alas....silly me ate too many fries, and other things and couldn't finish my dinner. So I took my dinner home in a box. Which I got to enjoy for lunch at work the next day (and was equally as good). That Steak which we both ordered medium rare, was perfect. and the sauce was rich and the crunchy twice baked potato.....oh and they gave us strawberry cake and after dinner drinks for free since it was our anniversary. What a perfect evening!\n(one small thing on a rainy day, their tile floor is uber slippery)\nI hope we get to go back here sometime soon for dinner, I really enjoyed my evening and food...oh and my fabulous company!

I was a little embarassed bringing my two year old to a restaurant that has been coined SF's new hot spot, but then I looked around, and the preschool set pretty much ruled the restaurant.  Because brunch is for families.  So Park Tavern, can you do us families a favor?  All we need is a single selection just for kids.  I'm not talking junky paper kid's menus with a cup of crayons.

I'm just saying a discreetly placed note on the side of the grown-up menu, maybe a \"Little Combo\" (one pancake, some scrambled eggs, a piece of cinnamon sugar toast....I mean, since you asked).  Because really, your food is rich and delicious and spectacular, but a little too out of this world for the 5 little girls that came for a \"ladies lunch\" with their moms one table over.  Brunch is for families.  Just sayin'", "author": "Kim S."}

Park Tavern has been on the list, so we gave it a go.  \n\nThe space is warm and inviting.  I liked the mixture of old and new decor with a grey and white color palate.  The Moose head and antlers on the wall by the bar pay homage to the original tenant, nice touch.  \n\nOur server Aura was great, she brought us a glass of wine in a quick minute to help erase our night at work.  Things were looking good.  \n\nWe had deviled eggs, just the right amount of spice, the appetizer winner for us.  The fried Oyster Caesar was a little messy, but the flavors were all there.  For dinner we had the Creekstone NY Steak, red wine jus, Mangalitsa butter & french fries.  Steak cooked a perfect medium rare, tender and juicy, just what my friend was craving.  I had the grilled pork chop , Italian butter bean pistou, dinosaur kale, toasted garlic & chili flakes.  The chop was huge, double cut and cooked perfectly.  The veggies were a little on the salty side for me, but I liked the combination of flavors.  What night would be complete without dessert?  We shared the TCHO chocolate creme brulee with chocolate biscotti.  My friend is a creme brulee junkie, he totally loved this version.  The lemon zest shaved on top was really noticeable on the first bite. \n\nThe perfect end to our 2011 working life.  Cheers!", "author": "Kim A."}

The staff seem intent on making the place feel more casual and friendly than its pricing, location, and clientele -- much appreciated. We were given a cushy corner booth, which was perfect. \n\nAs for the food:\nThey were out of deviled eggs. (Our reservation was for 10:30p, so running out of something was not unreasonable.) We ended up with this:\nhomemade jerky (as expected)\nbrussels sprouts chips (they were simply the fried leaves of sprouts)\nwarm chicory salad (salty!)\ntombo tuna (good! sorta salty)\napple crisp (super salty -- how? why?) with black tea ice cream (superb!)\nMcKinley cocktails (no. do not order.)\nglasses of a malbec and a torrontes (both great)\n\nOverwhelmingly, this meal was salty. The salad was delicious at first, but not finish-able. Indeed, I kept retreating to the jerky as a palate cleanser (jerky is salty, too). The tuna was really nicely prepared and, had the preceding dish not been so salted, I probably would not have found the fish so. It was nicely seared, in good portion, and nicely seasoned (salt notwithstanding). We were both excited for the fruitiness of the crisp when it arrived, but the crumble was incredibly salty as well! (I generally like the trend of salting sweets, but this was excessive.) \n\nI remarked that the whole meal had the feel of having been over-tasted by the same person during prep. I have made some horrendously salty soups when I've been the only taster, getting more and more used to the salt and feeling as if the dish could stand just a pinch more. (The black tea ice cream was lovely, though.) Yet, I have hope for reform!, since the food is potentially delicious. If they'd remove like half the salt.\n \nThe cocktail we had, from a \"program\" much lauded in reviews, was also disappointing in that the McKinleys we both had were veeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry sweet. \n\nOn the upside, our waiter was great. We were the last in his section, but we didn't feel rushed, we never waited for something we wanted, and he was helpful.", "author": "Aimee F."}

We talked with the hostess saying that a table would be about 45 minutes, but they gave us the option of dining at the bar or at the communal table. Decided to get a drink and put our name on the bar's dining list. The bartender was really nice and said that there was a party of two before my friend and I, and he got us started on drinks. About 15 minutes later, he came over and said that he had to unseat us because someone had to take the seat I was sitting on to dine. He felt really bad, so he comp'd our drinks (@ $12 each, I didn't mind that one bit). He then sent us back to the hostess and within 10 minutes she got us a seat. Granted, it was at the communal table, but I didn't care at this point. At least they were super nice and accommodating about it. \n\nNow the review:\n\nBread: Eh, could have done without it, but I was starving.\n\nFries: Eh, standard. Not much to say about it. It came with parsley and horseradish aioli which made my face scrunch up. Weird combo, but I guess there's people who like it...\n\nRoasted Halibut: Fish was cooked perfectly, but a little too salty for my taste.\n\nFriend ordered the Pork Chop: Really good from my taste of it.\n\nFor drinks we both got the Greenpoint (Bulleit Rye, Yellow Chartreuse, vermouth & bitters). I love this drink; I've been here once before for drinks and I ordered this one then, with dinner this last time, and probably if I ever make it back out here.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but I'm giving 4 stars mainly because of the service.", "author": "Denise Z."}

Reservations are a must if you aren't okay with squeezing in at the bar or communal table. \n\nWe had a bottle of champagne to celebrate, good rec from the bartender on one of the more reasonably priced bottles (Laurent Perrier). We each had one deviled egg, wow. The little crunch of bacon on top was amazing. We then shared the lemon chips with burrata. Flavor. Explosion. The lemon was sliced extremely thin and then fried to a crisp, and served with a very light burrata. It went so well with the champagne, I could have eaten just those all night. \n\nWe then shared the gnocchi, which was loaded with wild mushrooms and just the right amount of truffle. Finally, just to be extra gluttenous, we shared the pork chop. This was so delicious, but after all the other food the meat combined with the parmesan risotto was a bit rich for me. I brought it home to feed my boyfriend and he more than appreciated it. \n\nThis place is a true gem amid the touristy Italian spots that dominate North Beach.

It has a very rustic feel, and the best seat in the house (in my opinion) is the two counter seats near the open kitchen where you can enjoy the chefs hard at work!\n\nNow onto the food!\n\nSince me and my girlfriend are lightweight foodies, we generally like to sample a variety of things on the menu.\n\nWe started off with the deviled eggs.  We ordered one each because we had a lot of food coming, but it was so good we ordered another round!  I could have easily eaten 20 of these.  It is definitely the best I've had in a while.\n\nWe also ordered the Uni, brussel sprout chips, demons on horseback, and the lobster bisque.\n\nThe uni was very fresh, and up there with some of the best Japanese restaurants.  The bussel sprout chips were alright, and it's something that I'd probably never order again.  However, the demons on horseback was delicious!!!  It's basically 4 huge pieces of prawns wrapped in bacon, and their oh so delicious sauce.  \n\nThe lobster bisque was a something we added in the middle of our appetizers because there was a party of 15 people behind us, and they each ordered it.  So we thought why not order one too to share?  And it turns out that party did us justice.  The bisque was savory, sweet, and rich.  A little too rich when you kept eating it.  If you order this, make sure to share because I think it definitely tampered with the rest of my meal.  Although it was delicious, the flavor kinda coated my palette and made everything thereafter too salty.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Cod, and the grilled pork chop.\n\nThe Cod was very average, and it didn't really possess any flavor to me.  Again, this could be due to the bisque.  My grilled pork chop was definitely too damn salty due to the bisque.  I only managed to eat a quarter of it because I started to get full, and the saltiness was a turn off.  However, I did bring it home and ate it the next day, in which it definitely held up very well.  It also tasted much better the next day, but I'm sure it tasted great the first time they made it!\n\n\nSo ultimately, the bisque is really good.  Just don't eat too much of it because it's heavy, or pair it with a burger.  Deviled eggs, and demons on horsebacks are both winners!\n\n\nDefinitely coming back!", "author": "J V."}

Big ups for being nominated for a James Beard award for best new joint as well. \n\nGot here for our 10PM reservations on a saturday night, and let me tell you...it was popping...at 10PM. We are not talking kinda sorta busy, we are talking reservations only busy still at the late hour. \n\nThis place still has all the super whites that I saw last time i was here..in fact, I think some of them haven't even left since last time. So many striped Brooks Bros shirts and slacks and mink coats....where is the goddamn recession? Not here folks. \n\nFried Brussell sprout chips were as good as ever, the deviled eggs fantastic, and the pork chop as tender as JLO's ass. Wife had the mussels and whatever they put into that broth at the bottom of the bowl is so addicting, I want to swim in a pool of it. \n\nI think I saw the owner Anna Weinberg somewhere shaking hands and thanking patrons left and right.

It took a while to get our orders in and when they were it took FOREVER.  The couple eating next to our group had a full meal and left.\n\nIt took so long that our server came back and asked if we wanted a dessert menu.  We were appalled.  We told her we didn't get our food yet and of course our food was served to us instantly so it was obviously just sitting in the kitchen.  My skillet wasn't hot, the burgers were ok, everything was just horrible. One of our orders were incorrect as well and they cooked up a new burger and it was out in 5 minutes which shows that their cooks don't take THAT long.  The food was ok and nothing spectacular.  If it was then maybe it would've been worth the wait.\n\nWe had two servers \"help\" us and afterward they never came back and I think a supervisor assisted us and she wasn't very apologetic about what happened and she seemed annoyed that each person paid with separate cards/cash even though we asked for separate checks.  \n\n We had already lost our appetites so I don't even know if the food was good or not but I will not be returning to find out.\n\nPS My friend ordered an Americano which took a bit to be served but it was $6.00!

We picked this place (more like I) because it was talked about I think in San Francisco Magazine. The restaurant is REALLY BIG, it looks small from the outside! We made a reservation and were seated right away (it is best to make a reservation for this place!). Our waiter was nice but I think he could have been a little bit more friendly, I had noticed more friendlier staff waiting other tables. \n\nThe food was very good. We ordered the Saikou salmon, baby beets, creme fraiche & dill and the Brussels sprout chips the share, both amazing! Then I had the Grilled pork chop , sauteed baby turnips, carmelized apple, Nueske's bacon & mustard jus and my man had the Hawaiian tombo tuna, crispy sunchokes, white anchovies, baby artichokes & salsa rustica, he liked it, but liked my pork a little bit better ;) For dessert we had the  apple & red wine-caramel crisp, is was SO GOOD!\n\nI don't remember what cocktails we ordered but I do remember what I had was VERY GOOD!\n\nFor sure this is a place to bee seen but what I also liked about it there were all walks of life as well, it was not all posh people, their were families and older couples.

This review, however, is about service, attitude and integrity of those who served us. We intentionally came in about 45 minutes before our reservations and set in the bar area relaxing, waiting for our table, having drinks. We ordered specifically Ketel One Vodka martini. When the martini arrived it was not Kettle One. We did not make a big deal about it but for the next round we insisted on Ketel One. Waitress assured us she will get that drink right and that she placed the order for Kettle One. She went to the bar, talked to the bartender, he took a bottle of Gray Goose made two drinks in a shaker and served us one of the two. WFT? We saw the whole thing and at this point returned the drink back. Did we get a cheerful apology from the bartender? No way! Instead we got a really watered down Ketel One martini with attitude. \nOur table was ready only 30 minutes after the time of reservations. When we got to the table our new waitress told us that to comp for the wait she liked to offer us free Brussels sprouts appetizer ($9). We then went to order two more appetizers and a whole chicken ($15+9+28 + 3 martinis +$20 wine). We never tip less than 20% and you would think we spent enough money so that there would not be a need to scheme us for $9 bucks?  But when the bill arrived the Brussels sprouts app was included. We pointed that out to the waitress and in ONE second she produced a copy of the correct bill. Wow! So this was actually planned? I had many dinners at PT but mainly in the bar area. Never had I experienced this shameless petty scheming and F+++U attitude. Bar scene is fun and sharing a dish in the bar area is OK, but a sit down dinner here again: I'd be worried.", "author": "K Z."}

Plus one!  I was starting to think the idea of being seated on time at a popular restaurant was a thing of the past.\n\nThe restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas with white lights and a nice Christmas tree.  We were seated in the window area, a very pleasant section with views both outside to the park and into the restaurant. The tables were a little close together but with enough aisle space that it didn't feel crowded.  With a full house of large and small tables happy pre-holiday diners, the noise level was a bit high at first, but the overall atmosphere was so nice, we wouldn't let this keep us from returning.\n\nService was warm, efficient and knowledgeable.  The menu is varied and interesting. We enjoyed everything we ordered:\n\nduck liver crostini\narugula salad with mushrooms - unusual and very tasty\npork chop with kale and butter beans\nscallops with cauliflower puree and braised fennel\ntwice-baked potato  - so yummy with a lovely scallion flavor\n\nThere's a very nice selection of wines by the glass and the servings are very generous.\n\nAs a non-meat eater, I'd like to see a few more seafood and vegetable options on the menu.  Without even a vegetarian dinner option, a vegetarian would have a hard time ordering a meal here.\n\nEDIT: I'm bumping my rating from 4 to 5 stars in response to the restaurant's decision to remove the \"healthy SF\" surcharge.

Inside is epic and outside is perfect if you have a dog or kid or noisy monster.\n\nIt's only been open a few weeks and I've had half the menu.  Let me tell you, it's all delicious.  Perhaps the best so far is the pork chop (sorry, Jewish ancestors).  It's a double thick, moist, smoky tender lump of deliciousness.  Seriously, one of the best pork chops in my life.\n\nOther random stuff is inventive, inspired,and tasty, without breaking the basic idea that it's all comfort food.  The heirloom baby carrot salad, the most giiry thing on the menu, was pickled and salted and delicious.  On the other side of the coin, the caviar style fried oysters were like five po' boys without the roll, days later I'm still fantasizing over that.\n\nThe service?  It's what I call \"your hand been shook\" service.  Back when Bill Clinton was President people met him and they all said, when Bill Clinton shakes your hand, your hand has been shook.  That's what I think about Park Tavern.  When you eat there and you get service, youv'e been served.  These people are professional career waiters, with that perfect combination of skills, weird semi-snarky cockiness and teasing, loving concern over you and your food, and just plain interesting personalities that makes for an experience you come home and to to sleep with.   I can't say enough good things, it's like an hour and a half experience with a personal food guy and you leave smiling all the way home.\n\nThe main reason for four stars instead of five is they need a little more work to polish it up, and way too much salt and butter.

I requested a table outside and was told it would be about a 30 - 45 minute wait. Ok, cool. So we strolled around the park and Goorin Brothers as we waited for our table. Upon our return, we were told our table indoors was being set up. I reminded the hostess that I had requested an outdoor table. She shrugged her shoulders and told us they didn't have one. If we wanted an outdoor table, we could be put on the list and it would be about 30-45 minutes. I, then, reminded her that I had been on that list and waited 45 minutes. Our hostess than flatly said that there weren't any notes on our reservation and that there must have been a communication error. I told her that if there had been a communication issue, it would have been between us, since it was she I had spoken to 45 minutes prior. She again shrugged. Ridiculous! In the end, they didn't really seem to care that they'd made a mistake nor did they try in any way to make it right. So, we decided not to, again, wait 45 minutes for the outdoor table... instead we walked down the street and into Original Joe's.\n\nI also happen to work by their new sister restaurant The Cavalier, which I actually like much better.

The End.\n\nThe Full Story (It's a long one):\n\nEarly arrival calls for a trip to the bar, where we sit and peruse the house specialties. I inquire with the bartender: \"Tell me about this Cr\u00e8me de Violette in the [cocktail_name]\" to which I receive a response in the tone of someone speaking to a toddler: \"It's a lavender liquor.\" Really? Wow. Thanks for that enlightening description.\n\nWe review the menu some more but opt for traditional drinks. My fianc\u00e9e opts for her favorite, which she likes to compare across the various venues of the city, and asks: \"Do you do a brandy Sidecar?\"...and the reply: \"Of course, this is San Francisco. Here you can get all sorts of complicated drinks.\"\n\nWhat? Are you kidding me? You fucking *AssHat\n\nAllow me instruct you on a few things:\n\n1) I was inquiring about the flavor of the lavender and maybe how it impacts the overall cocktail...as a **mixologist you might want to look into it. It's on YOUR menu and you are serving it to people.\n\n2) The Sidecar cocktail is served in a variety of forms...often with either Brandy or Cognac. Since yours is the ***second worst example I've had the displeasure to experience, you might want to take the time to visit other venues such as Zero Zero, AQ, Lark Creek Steakhouse, Top of the Mark, et. al. where there are bartenders with talent. You have none. Your lemon juice with a twist might pass on a child's roadside lemonade stand, but that's really about it.\n\n3) For some reason you pegged us as tourists. I am personally offended to think that you go about mis-representing our fair city so rudely. \n\nFor the management: It was the big guy...the one who likes to wear watches about the size of his head.\n\nMoments after receiving our fresh squeezed juiceboxes, we are informed our table is ready. \n\nThis bit is extra fun. So it appears that someone is very anxious to pack in as many people as humanly possible into this space. Because that is what top-dollar restaurant goers are looking for, right? And our table? Shoved into the corner where the frame for the restaurant's front sliding doors intrudes fully into the right side of where I'm sitting on the booth. For extra fun I have to sqeeze ever so carefully between the table next to us and ours, so as to not knock over anything on their table (I'm sure they *loved* my ass sliding by over their entr\u00e9es) and then yoga myself into position...it was...odd. I then re-realized that I was not indeed an amputee, and still have a right arm I typically use to lift my hand so I can eat. Not here. Apparently I'm only permitted to eat left-handed. In order to use my right hand I'd have to sit in the lap of the gentleman at the next table. Awesome.\n\nI brought this to the attention of our server, and indicated that it really wasn't acceptable and that we'd like a different table. She went and spoke to the hostess...and a few minutes later we were moved to a table by the kitchen. Much better. Nice even.\n\nAfter introductions to our new server, we made our selections and started receiving our food...which is pretty much the punchline: SAUCY.\n\nYep. Saucy. That is how I would describe the fare. Shrimp with remoulade? (Demons on Horseback) There is more remoulade than shrimp, and they are buried in it. Blech. Something akin to what one would expect at Outback Steakhouse. My fianc\u00e9e ordered the Herb Crusted Petrale Sole. It should be named \"LAKE OF VELOUTE\" with fish in it. I'd never seen a veloute fish soup before. She didn't eat it. As for my main dish? I've forgotten what I had. Enough said.\n\nTo the credit of the staff and manager, they did inquire about our experience...and I was earnest in my response. The manager offered to give us a gift certificate for a future visit...to which I declined. Yes, our experience was so poor I would not come back and eat here for free. My time and palate deserve better.\n\nTo really hammer the point home, we left here and grabbed a quick Uber to Hillstone for dessert and cocktails to try and wash away the crap experience. \n\nAs a final shocking side note: Upon hearing some of the highlights of our evening, do you know what Hillstone did? They comped us a round of drinks. You heard that right. HILLSTONE comped us to make up for PARK TAVERN ruining our evening. \n\nWow.\n\nIn S.F. we have a huge selection of amazing fare. The differentiators are the overall experience. Sorry Park Tavern, but you are far below par. I think you know where we'll be recommending friends and visitors go.\n\n* I should note that everyone else was quite friendly, in a North Beach sortof way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-14", "description": "Sometimes I wish we could rate on the half star because I would've gone 2.5. I will round up to 3 solely because the management was up to par on customer relation skills and because my friend assured me that she had never had such a mediocre experience there before.\n\nPark Tavern is not as outrageously expensive as some other establishments (for the most part), but I do wish that San Franciscans would not tolerate such high prices with low expectations of quality. It is to our collective detriment to get mediocre food at over-priced levels.\n\nA friend and I came for brunch on a Sunday and loved the bright atmosphere. We started off with the smoked deviled eggs since it was on the 7x7 Magazine top 100 list. 7x7 does themselves a discredit here along with the restaurant. For $2.50 (not $2 as reported in other posts), you get HALF a small egg (smaller than the large size you get at the grocery store). Ours were not smokey nor did it have a stand-out flavor that warrants a place on any best-of list, let alone a price of $2.50. And to be clear, it was $2.50 EACH half. My friend found the bacon to be the standout flavor, but for my piece, I didn't get much flavor at all. Please. Even if the expected flavors came through nicely, it is still hard to imagine a half an egg for $2.50. They would do better to leave the smoking process out if that is what raises the price because 1) we can't taste it anyway and 2) there has to be a balance of result vs. price somewhere. Come on San Francisco and 7x7. We can expect better than this.\n\nNext, we had the avocado toast. I would normally not order this at a restaurant because it's so easy to prepare at high quality at home, but my friend had a hankering for it so we ordered it. It did not arrive on one of San Francisco's many famous breads, but on a slice of whole wheat toast that looked amazingly like the loaf I had in my fridge at home. My friend got the side that had an irregularly large hole in it. To look at, it looked nice with beautifully and thinly sliced avocado. On top of that was an oil flavored with what our server said was an African spice. That spice wasn't habanero hot, but it left me with enough tingly sensation on my lips to last into my main course. However, there was too much oil that was unnecessary. Plus, it all covered up the flavor of the avocado. The bread had no flavor at all. For a whopping $10, it was definitely not worth it. Perhaps if it were on a better bread with more balanced flavor...\n\nI had the shrimp and grits ($16). The grits were cooked very nicely and had a nice flavor and creamy texture. It was great to see that they use one of the country's top purveyors of grits! Half of the shrimp were too salty. Luckily, you're meant to eat them together so the aggregate flavor was only a little too salty.\n\nMy friend had the crispy polenta cakes ($18), which at first, seemed just right, but ended up giving the feeling of overly-fried by the end. Luckily, one poached egg was just right. The other egg, slightly on the soft-boiled side.\n\nOn the whole, perhaps it was the particular line in the kitchen that day that affected the dishes. Either someone wasn't tasting the food or whoever was checking the food had deadened taste buds. The food needed balance of flavors. We got none or too much.\n\nThe wait staff confused us. We were seated by one waiter, another took our order, and the food was brought out (and our questions were answered) by the one who seated us. Perhaps they were confused, too, because it took us about an hour to get our food while another table nearby completely turned over while we waited. Also, no one came to check on us or tell us why there was a delay except for the manager on duty who was their saving grace. He took our feedback about the food in stride and with what seemed like sincere appreciation. He also offered us a small token of a make-good to make up for an experience that fell flat and with wishes that we would return to give them another chance. I think I will. Customer service like that (because he really seemed to care about the feedback) when you don't get what you think you're paying for is worth a lot.", "author": "Maria Y."}

Really unique flavors, and the little crunch of bacon on top is perfection.\nBrussel Sprout Chips - delightfully crunchy (brussel sprouts are so \"in\" these days - ha)\nLemon Chips Burrata - I love the flavor of burrata, so I didn't necessarily enjoy the burrata ON the lemon chips, but thought it was nice to eat on the side. \nPT Waldorf Salad - really fresh, tangy with a hint of sweetness (although my date said it was a little sweet)\nCarmelized Onion Mushroom Soup - this was perhaps my least favorite... just wasn't on the top of my list.\nMarlowe Burger (ordered medium)  - JUICY and delightful medley of flavors.  The horseradish aioli is such a great addition. I almost had to ask for a 2nd serving of aioli so I could dunk everything in it. It's not particularly large, but still one of my fav burgers. \n\nOverall I LOVE park tavern.

It's big and comfortable, and I really appreciate how the staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nThoughts on Park Tavern:\n\n1) The \"Marlowe Burger\" is better here than at Marlowe.  Strange, but convenient for me.\n\n2) The service is much better at Park Tavern than at Marlowe.  Marlowe servers are somewhat unfriendly and sloppy.\n\n3) Must eats:\n\n-Poulet Rouge.  A whole game hen served standing on a cast iron pan.  People will stare.  I actually loved the accompanying spinach the first time, but last night the spinach was too salty!\n\n-Pork Chop:  This is no Nopa pork chop, but the flavor is great and the texture is perfect (if you're ok with pink pork).  The first time we tried to order this, they ran out!  So go on a weeknight.\n\n-Birthday cake: I'm not kidding, their layered cake is perfect.  I got chocolate; next time I want to try coconut.  Not too sweet.  When I ordered this, the bf didn't want dessert....but he ended up eating half of it in 10 seconds!\n\n-NY Steak Crudo: This is the best raw beef I've had.  I like it better than tartare (although I do love Marlowe's spicy tartare!)\n\n-Wild arugula, mushroom conserva, porcini & charred onion vinaigrette.  Yes, this is a salad.  The charred onion vinaigrette is delicious.  It's smoky and pungent and I tried to lick my plate clean.  It's a large portion and shareable.  We split this in 2 and each had a \"dinner salad\" at some other restaurants. **If I came alone, I would actually order the Steak Crudo and the Arugula salad as my dinner.\n\n-Deviled egg: I thought this would taste too bacony (as in the bacon flavor overpowering everything else), but the bacon, pickle, and egg together are pretty awesome.\n\n-Brussels Sprout Chips: I love these at Marlowe--they're fried perfectly and are lemony.  When we ordered these last night, they came out over-fried and burned-tasting.  Also they were greasier at Park Tavern.  Could just be an off batch.  :(\n\n4) Things I'd Skip:\n\n-Fried Pork Belly Bites: not for me.  You have to really like pork fat to eat these.  They're mostly fat, almost no meat.  And they're coated.  I prefer flash fried and braised pork belly.\n\n-Creamed seasonal greens: When we ordered this, the sauce had a truffled goat cheese in it.  I had not expected this.  I don't like things to be truffled (overpowering taste) and I don't like goat cheese.  I couldn't eat it.\n\n-Twice baked potato.  I also didn't like this one.  It was just OK.  Cheese was a little sharp for me for such a rich dish.  I would have liked some acidity and some more salt on this.", "author": "Diana C."}

The porkchop itself was okay but the potatoes that it was served with were a buttery and creamy goodness. The halibut was served with the skin (which was crispy) and I absolutely loved it..because I love crispy fish skin. Teehee. We also ordered the twice baked potatoes as a side dish and the amount of food was perfect for two. \n\nThe cocktail list is filled with unique concoctions so definitely try one out!

Adding a few more sandwiches and breakfast items that don't use sugar would be great. With that being said, the French toast was probably one of the best versions I've ever had.  If you like sweet items - you'll love the menu! \n\nDrinks are also great - my only complaint is that the menu pricing seems to be off.

It's disappointing too because the setting is really nice and the vibe usually quite good.\n\nI hosted a business dinner there last night for six people and for 700 bucks we ended up all sharing two pizzas a few hours later.  The lamb and steak entrees are inexcusably small for their 38 and 40 price tags.  Maybe the lamb portion was four ounces, maybe.  There's really no excuse for this other than the restaurant trying to goose its margin.\n\nI think the only item we all really enjoyed was the deviled eggs which are a treat.  The sardines were mediocre, as was the shrimp appetizer. \n\nThe service was also average -- not bad, but not great either.  The staff generally seems disinterested since they take for granted that they'll be busy every night.

Isn't a tavern the traditional place you go to shelter from the cold? I mean yikes, I never took off my jacket or scarf. I know restaurants make it colder because that makes you want to eat more, but I just felt sort of chilled the whole time I was there. \n\nI really liked the way their menu was organized (smoked, fried, marinated, tomatoes, etc). And there were lots of choices, whatever your craving was. I especially loved the heirloom tomato and burratta dish, presented on a very cool piece of slate. I thought all the dishes were presented so beautifully, and came out at a great pace. Our server was lovely, and it seemed all the people around us were lovely, too (tables are kind of close together, it got hard not to eavesdrop). Everything was delicious, and I encourage anyone to try their chocolate creme brulee with chili and lime. Very unique, with great flavors. \n\nStill, I'm not sure I was down with the atmosphere. In addition to being chilly in the front table section, the place was very loud and around 8pm, they dimmed the lights. This might have created a nicer vibe if we hadn't been ordering, as the print on their menu was seriously as small as they could possibly make it and the space was already kind of dark before the mandated dimming. Also, it seems like they went to a lot of trouble to fit their massive wine list on one page of paper, which made it extremely difficult to read (even for the folks at the table with perfect vision).\n\nThe location is prime, and it was nice to take a walk around the neighborhood after our meal, so I think I would rather come back here during the day. Maybe it wouldn't be so damn cold inside then, and I would be able to read the menu without the squinting.", "author": "Rachel A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-11", "description": "Overhyped. Overpriced. \n\n*Note: This review is for brunch, not dinner.* \n\nI freakin love brunch. It's kind of a problem. I think about it during the week, planning for my next brunch fix. There are few breakfast establishments that miss my scavenging eye. So, when I discovered that Park Tavern had recently begun to serve brunch, I was giddy with excitement. I mean, they serve cocktails in PITCHERS for god's sakes! What could go wrong?\n\nDo not be lured in by their pitchers (although their menu insinuates otherwise, only 2 of their cocktails are offered in this form) or the flawless, if sterile, Restoration Hardware decor. This was a highly average brunch experience. Here's a breakdown:\n\nTo Start:\n\n-Sourdough, Dungeness crab & green goddess toast:  This could have been fabulous! But what was the deal with the toast? Instead of the crunchy, flavorful Tartine-style slices we were hoping for, we received small doughy triangles, already getting soggy from the crab and green goddess on top - kind of like old lady cucumber sandwich bread. Plus the dungeness crab topping was only so-so. You know it's a fail when you think to yourself, \"I could have made this better at home.\"\n\nTo Drink:\n\n-PT Bloody Mary:   I'm really glad they got this right, otherwise I might have cried. However, these bloody maries are made with a beef broth, which was a sad discovery for my vegetarian sister, who loves bloody maries and couldn't get one here. The \"veggie alternative\" (see below) was such a sad excuse for a cocktail - it should really be taken off the drink menu.\n\n-Bloody Maria:   This is usually made with tequila, but my sister asked for hers with vodka to make it more like a classic bloody mary. Unfortunately, nothing could help this drink. \"Grass\" is the first thing that comes to mind when drinking this, and not in a good way. It's essentially like drinking watered-down salsa with alcohol. Not good.\n\n-Boozy Smoothie:  Another radical drink. Coffee, banana and bourbon. Amazing. Only sad thing was the tiny glass it came in.\n\nMain Courses:\n\n-Cornmeal Pancakes: These were dry and uninteresting. The lemon curd was good, but they were not even close to Mission Beach Cafe's pancakes with bourbon syrup and vanilla cream.\n\n-Country ham steak & poached farm egg: This dish was an odd combo of cold potatoes, mustard and cabbage with the eggs and ham done in the style of a benedict without the english muffins. It just felt off.  All of the egg dishes at Zazie blow this out of the water.\n\n-\"Marlowe\" burger: My brother in law is a burger eater. He gets them pretty much everywhere we go. His rating for this one - good, but not on his top 5. (If you're wondering, NOPA's burger is #1 on his list.)\n\n-Crispy polenta cakes: This dish was the best of the batch. The polenta was crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside, the eggs were perfectly poached. However, even this dish was lacking something. A spice? Another ingredient? Not sure, but it didn't make up for the rest.\n\nIf you're going to charge as much as Park Tavern does, your food should be exceptional. Sadly, PT's brunch was really a let down. The hardest thing for these guys will be living up to all of the delicious and reasonably priced competition in this city. So far, I would tell anyone considering this place to keep walking a little further to Mama's at Stockton and Filbert. There may be a line, but it's definitely one of the best brunches you'll get in in San Francisco.", "author": "Brodie J."}

The atmosphere was charming.  The service was impressive and personal. So what makes me take the time to share this experience with you?  Unfortunately, the manager was the most indifferent, cold and rude person I've ever met in the position of restaurant service.  THE RESTAURANT WAS LIKE AN ICEBOX!  Every girl at my surrounding tables was wearing a ski jacket and some with hats and scarves! I asked the waiter if we could possibly have some more heat.  I'm sure he passed on the request, but was unable to accommodate us.  When I had the opportunity to speak to the manager,and told him that his decision to FREEZE his customers when they are paying $19.00 for eggs was extremely short sighted. His response was a totally indifferent, \"the heat's been on since I came in.\" Now that may be true, but the front door was left open the entire time we were there. I'm sure something could have been done, and if not at least a manager deserves an explanation to a patron ( I'm sure I was not the only one) who's eating her meal bundled up in a ski jacket as to why the warmest place in the restaurant is the bathroom!!

It was cooked very well though. We order one of each of the sides (twice cooked potato, brussel sprouts, spinach, broccolini and french fries). I could not stop eating the french fries. They were SO good. Extra crispy but still moist on the inside. Delicious! For dessert we had the smore and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was cute because they brought it out with a candle in it. The smore was good, but not the best I've ever had.

Park tavern did just that. Before the service even started I immediately felt at home in the warm ambiance of this large, yet intimate dining area. I wish I remember our servers name but suffice to say she was impeccable. Extremely friendly and when we had some questions on wine she gladly sent over the sommelier who was great as well. We tried the deviled eggs, duck pate, twice baked potato, burrata and tomatoes, and the steak. All the food was prepared very well. I loved the twice baked potatoes! The combinations were very inventive and I was impressed when each order came out. Another thanks to our waitress who was very conscious to stagger when our orders came out providing a perfectly seamless dining experience.  \n      Never did I think that a dish lacked a certain \"somthin\".  Do yourself a favor and take your next date night to park tavern!", "author": "Mark N."}

I love both of them for very different reasons. \n\nI've been here for both brunch and dinner several times (both amazing), so bear with me while I walk through the menu.\n\nBeer and cocktails- My boyfriend and I love craft beer, and if you have read any of my other reviews, you'd know that I love Sudwerk out of Davis, CA. The Sudwerk Pilsner is on draft and is also featured in the Michelada at Brunch. Holy Moly does the Michelada leave a fiery sensation in your mouth, but the combination of the pickled jalepeno and the beer make it an amazing combination. The other three cocktails i've had are the Kentucky Mule, Dirty Martini, and the Country Lawyer. All I can say, is that the bartenders are fantastic and poor some amazing drinks.\n\nBRUNCH: Boyfriend and I usually like to order several things when we go out to eat, so I'll give a tidbit of our favorites.  I'm not an egg person, so I'll give his opinion second hand.\n\nAvocado Toast: SO good. I've tried to recreate this at home several times. The combo of the avocado, chili, and lemon is nothing short of amazing.\n\nGrapefruit Brulee: Carmelizing the grapefruit definitely cuts the tartness of the fruit, and the sugary goodness just melts in your mouth.\n\nPan Fried Corn Beef Hash: BF loved the poached egg, and I mean, you really cant go wrong with corn beef hash. \n\nBanana Coconut Fritters: delicious, but they are a bit on the heavier side, so be aware of that when ordering a lot of food.\n\nDINNNER: If you only get to make it here once, here is what I'd recommend trying.\n\nBrussel Sprout chips: These are flash friend brussel sprout leaves? that are tossed in lemon and salt. I'm almost positive that every time I've been to Park Tavern, we've had to order more of these chips. They have them at Marlowe (their sister restaurant) as well. SO good.\n\nThe \"Bar\" Steak: It's the perfect amount of steak and salad without feeling like I overate and leaving me with enough room for dessert. (I opt for the salad over fries because I like to pretend that I am healthy.) \n\n\"Poulet Noir\"- This is hands down the best item in my opinion on the menu. For a first timer, order the baby hen intact. It comes sitting up and literally falls off the bone and has an amazing truffle taste. DISCLAIMER:it IS a little annoying dismantling the chicken, but we later learned to order it already chopped up. It just looks so pretty when it is still intact. \n\nI've never had the lamb or porkchop, but i've heard they are both amazing as well. \n\nLong story short, food and drinks are awesome, atmosphere is great, servers were great---Park Tavern= great.", "author": "Mona A."}

And we love salt/spice!!   Positives:  deviled eggs were great, as was my \"Old Cuban\" run drink.  But then..... sole was a paltry cut and indistinguishable in taste from the artichokes,etc. on the plate.  Spinach side dish was garlicky to the extreme; basically inedible.  Fries over-truffled and the egg that accompanied it would have been salty enough with the caviar, so why did they crack sea salt on it too?  Brussel sprouts side dish was drowning in butter.  Left a lot of food on our plates even though we weren't particularly full.\n\nService was fine, and I do love the atmosphere, so I'll try it one more time and try to find a favorite dish so I can enjoy the positives of Park Tavern and ALSO enjoy my meal.", "author": "Anne M."}

The restaurant had a great vibe, great food, and great service, so its my new favorite at the moment. I can still remember the fun times I had when this was the old Moose's back in the day, but that electric energy of the crowd still exists at the present day Park Tavern. \n\nOur group tried pretty much every starter on the menu plus the special Spicy Steak Tartare! The highlights were the fried brussels, steak tartare, hamachi crudo, demons on horseback, deviled eggs, and fried oyster cesar - all outstanding.  \n\nFor our mains the standouts were the pork chop, ahi tuna, and burger. The only item that was really below par was the lobster and crab bisque. It was so salty it verged on bitter and this is coming from a gal who likes her sodium. After a taste I thought my hands were going to swell up to the size of baseball mitts! \nAs for everything else - they had a very comprehensive wine list and a few cool beers, like the red rice Japanese ale.

Ambiance and decor were great- but it was almost too dark for me to read the menu, and that's not usually a problem. Also, having an open kitchen onto the dining room is fun, but we left smelling strongly of fried food- clothes went straight into the laundry basket.\n\nReviewing as a vegetarian in a meat-centric restaurant so our menu choices were limited to begin with. We ordered the County Line salad with avocado crostini- greens (only greens) were lovely, as we expect from one of our favorite farms. The fava bean hummus was not great- I'm a fan of fava beans, but in this puree they were a bit too earthy tasting. \n\nOur 'second course': the twice baked potatoes came out bubbling in a mini cast iron pan and were good and very cheesy (probably too much cheese for my dining companion but I enjoyed it). Also had the smoked  Brussels sprouts hearts and kabocha squash- really  looking forward to this one as I was hoping it would be the most hearty dish we ordered, but it was so overwhelmingly salty and fake-smoky tasting that I actually sent it back. Our very kind and efficient server offered to replace it, but we weren't all that hungry at this point and declined.\n\nSo not the best food, but an enjoyable atmosphere and great service. I would return to try some of the yummy sounding cocktails and maybe get a cheese plate or something. I imagine for carnivores the menu may be more tempting- I would love to see at least one vegetarian entree done well. Our server did recommend brunch for more vegetarian choices so I'd try them then as well.", "author": "jean k."}

We had 8pm reservations on a Friday night.  Our NYF and I were about 15-20 minutes late, but Hue L. (and his special guest) were already there ensuring our table wouldn't be given away (and enjoying drinks while they waited).\n\nSince we were late, and we weren't sure what the parking situation was in the area, we decided to valet the car.  $11, in case you wanted to know.\n\nWe were seated and sat around for a while before our waiter came and got our orders for appetizers (and drinks for me and our NYF).  \n\nDrinks: I got the McLaren (Hendrick's gin, cucumber juice, lemon, ginger beer), which I actually liked - even though I am most definitely not a ginger fan.  It was light, cucumber-y, and tasty.\n\nAppetizers: We all split the brussel sprout chips because almost every review on Yelp has raved about them.  I'm not the biggest fan of brussel sprouts, but these were actually quite tasty.  We all also each got a Deviled Egg (one without bacon for our vegetarian special guest). I think the bacon definitely added to the flavor though.  The bacon and the extra little kick from the jalapeno.  Yum!\n\nEntree:  Hue L. ordered the scallops (caramelized sea scallops, roasted cauliflower, braised baby fennel & grapefruit).  Our NYF had the tuna (Hawaiian tombo tuna, crispy sunchokes, white anchovies, baby artichokes & salsa rustica).  Our vegetarian special guest had the soup (caramelized onion & wild mushroom soup, slow-cooked swiss chard & poached egg) and polenta (Anson Mills polenta, Seville orange & red cabbage relish).  I had the pork chops (Italian butter bean pistou, dinosaur kale, toasted garlic & chili flakes).  The biggest plate went to the smallest person (that's me).  It was huge.  I didn't expect two pieces of pork.  I managed to *almost* finish my dish.  Yay me!\n\nDesserts: Our NYF and I shared January's Birthday cake (Chad's Jamaican rum cake) and Hue L. and his special guest shared the tcho chocolate cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  The birthday cake actually comes with a long, skinny candle.  How festive!  And, hey, my birthday's coming up!  But, the cake was really good.  Moist, slight rum taste.  I'm not a big cake fan, but it was really, really good.\n\nTotal for four people w/ drinks ~$180 pre-tip.\n\nFinal Note:  The food was good, but not great for the price.  Also, it's WAY too loud in there.  The tiling is not conducive in muting the noise.  And yes, the smell of pot wafts in every now and then when people open/close the door.

I had the pork chop and she had the steak. Both of entrees were just okay. My chop was a little too undercooked and didn't have much of seasoning or sauce. It was a little too charred too. We also had the brussels sprout chips, which was a tad too oily for me.  It was an unique appetizer, but I wouldn't order it again. We had another appetizer too, but I can't remember what it was.

It was only weird b/c I didn't find out until the night before.  Do not fret though!  The menu was great and delicious.  It was a 3 course meal and they had some additions on the side (i.e. their famous deviled eggs from the 7x7 Big Eat List.\n\n2)  I have always shyed away from going out on Valentine's Day b/c I figured it would be overcrowded and hard to get taxis, etc.  I used to work at a restaurant, and on Vday it was a zoo.  This was not the case at Park Tavern.  They all worked effortlessly.  The food was quick and great (more below) and our service was awesome.

It is the perfect trifecta of good food, great ambiance & excellent service.  I've never tried a dish I didn't like...the chicken (poulet noir), the Marlowe burger, the fish, pork or beef option...all good.  However, I always enjoy the side dishes and appetizers the most whether the deviled eggs, roasted vegetables, salad, or brussells sprout chips.  Oh, and the cocktails are pretty amazing too; I always get the Washington Square.\n\nI've been here with my husband, with a group of girlfriends, and even with my children (all for dinner) and it's great each time.  A note about bringing kids here. It is not really a kid restaurant but we wanted a nice restaurant to celebrate our 7 yo daughter's birthday.  The staff was so nice to our children and the food was accessible enough that even our picky eating son found plenty of food to enjoy.\n\nBut what makes this restaurant stand apart is their service. We've always had friendly, attentive, knowledgable, professional staff who must have good management.  When things go wrong here, they take care of you right away.  Even if you do not complain or expect or even realize that something has gone wrong.  I write this review now, even though I haven't been to Park Tavern in months, because it still stands out to me.  Sometimes it takes getting bad service at another restaurant to realize how much you appreciate a restaurant with good service!  As an example, one time we ordered dessert and the homemade ice cream had not set.  Instead of just letting us know and asking us to order another dessert, they provided a complimentary dessert...this really wasn't necessary but of course, appreciated.  Another time we made a reservation and they had to cancel it.  Recently this happened at another restaurant and we just got an automatic email from OpenTable. At Park Tavern, they called and followed up with an offer to pay for dinner at another of their restaurants or provide us with a gift card for dinner at PT for another night.   I have NEVER even heard of such great service and then to be able to actually experience it, is really very amazing.", "author": "Courtney T."}

Jennifer Puccio, executive chef, does both places, and I'll be damned if I forget how incredible that burger at Marlowe is.\n\nI came here on a Sunday brunch around 1pm. Shockingly, there were reservations open and some of the tables were free as well. \n\nFOOD: Banana coconut fritters with a tart raspberry jam were incredible. Not greasy whatsoever, this confection (clearly not calorie-free) was the perfect beginning to a brunch. I ordered the Marlowe burger after much debate between going savory or sweet (there's a smattering of carb-winking items stuffed with sweetness on the menu). The burger is large and comes with fries. I suggest you order it medium, as the medium-well was almost too done. My dining partner ordered the eggs with spinach. Portions were large. \n\nATMOSPHERE: The cavernous square shape allows booths to be placed within a square to the left of the bar and then free tables within that central square. It's very NYC restaurant. Decor is pulled straight out of the Restoration Hardware catalog-- many pieces I've seen in the showroom were in the dining room at Park Tavern. Y'all can't fool me! It's got a cosmopolitan yet French  countryside vibe- full of creams and dark chocolates. There IS outdoor seating, not much, but it's available. And because you're in North Beach, expect to see the shellacked faces and overpriced brows of Marina females, with heels and gloss, sitting not three feet from you.

It's beautiful in there - I loved being in Moose's, and they have lightened up the decor and made it even better. My friend ordered the mussels which were a very generous serving, and had a great flavor.\n\nThe bad - the watermelon/prosciutto appetizer that everyone is cooing about did not work for me - the flavors with the truffle and the lemon zest were too disjointed. I also was not crazy about the scallops (which, by the way, set us back 27 bucks). \n\nI will definitely go back to enjoy the decor with drinks, but (big) if I ate it would be some of the \"safer\" options (the Marlowe signatures like the burger and the brussels).", "author": "Sophie S."}

When they opened up their super-sized Park Tavern in Washington Square, I knew it was going to be awesome.  You can fit probably 10 Marlowes in the old Moose's space. My party scored a table on a Friday night at 9pm.  I really liked the dark wood decor and open kitchen.\n\nThe bar was packed and lively. They had a handful of interesting cocktails, so I started off with a Washington Square with hangar vodka. Later on I also had a Golden Gate, made with shochu. I forget what else they were mixed with, but both drinks were inventive and tasty. They're definitely going to bring in a lot of thirsty bar hoppers with their cocktail program.\n\nWe went all out with the appetizers and shared pork rinds, fried oysters, fried pork belly, beef jerky, and brussell sprout chips. All the fried stuff was amazing, especially the oysters. I'm not a fan of brussell sprouts, but I enjoyed the crispiness. We also shared a bunch of side dishes, including the polenta, potatoes, and peppers.\n\nFor my entree I had the lamb chops and merguez sausage. The lamb was medium rare and perfectly cooked for my taste. The sausage was a flavorful bonus, but I thought the greens with the dish were way too salty. I finished off the meal with an awesome Fernet ice cream shake. It sounds funky, but I recommend it if you like Fernet.\n\nThe service was excellent and cheerful. You can tell they were all excited with the opening. I look forward to visiting them again soon.", "author": "Jermaine R."}

I'm overdue on submitting other reviews, though this one couldn't wait. \n\nI'm sure you're wondering why 5 stars? Was the meal perfect, you ask? No...and stop looking for perfect, by the way. A wise person once said that perfect is the enemy of good, and last night's meal at Park Tavern was GOOD, heck, it was GREAT. \n\nAs much as I wanted to dine here, I've been relatively passive about coming to this place, and it has everything to do with making time to get out my 'hood and do the North Beach thing. My passivity came in the form of lazy attempts at getting seated after having a few cocktails at Tony Niks, only to wander down to Park Tavern and ask for a table...on a Friday night. I know, I know, a man can dream right? I was often too hungry for the 45 minute wait and often settled for a slice of Golden Boy Pizza instead. The half-assed attempts continued, off-and-on, for a good TWO YEARS - whenever I was in the neighborhood, and through it all, the Park Tavern hosts ALWAYS had a good and funny nature about the absurdity of some dude waltzing into their joint on a Friday or Saturday night expecting a table for 3 or 4 without reservations, with a wait under 60 minutes. (OK, I never expected a wait under and hour, but the answer is always \"no\" unless you ask.) In a town with restaurants and foodies who sometimes take themselves too seriously, hats off to the Park Tavern hosts for always being professional, happy, and funny. \n\nSoooooo...I broke down and actually made a reservation. Me and my companion got a nice table, and man, I really loved the energy in this place! It was the right kind of \"loud\" where it was a good background buzz, yet we were able to carry on our conversation with straining our voices. Jeff, our waiter, was very attentive and knew the right times to check-in on us. Anyways, I highly recommend the Demons on Horseback (only a poet can describe this app) and Devil Eggs!! Patrick (one of the managers), hooked us up with the Twice Baked Potato, which is something else I encourage everyone to try. I confessed to Jeff and Patrick my 2 year journey and they used the Twice Baked Potato as their way of saying \"welcome...and please come back\". I shall come back, dear sirs!  My entree was the pork chop - cooked medium - served on a bed of \"brussel hash\" mixed with some sort of savory sausage. Very hard to disagree with all this pork goodness!! With a meal so good, I am going to sleep like a king tonight. Oh yeah, my lesson has been learned and I will actually PLAN to come back to Park Tavern and make reservations in advance. It was worth the 2 year wait. Thank you!!", "author": "A.D. A."}

My concierge had arranged a reservation at a different restaurant, but my friend's husband was intrigued by the gnocchi here and asked if I could switched the reservation. The restaurant said they were booked for reservations (we were a party of four) until 9 p.m., but that we were welcome to come in and try to snag seats at the communal tables. \n   We were quoted a 45 minute wait time, which is standard for any decent restaurant at prime dinner time. They have a fantastic cocktail selection and very friendly bartenders. The wine list had a nice list of options as well. \n   After waiting for an hour, my friend asked the host how much longer it would be. She was told the reservations were running a little behind and it would be another 20 minutes. I understand it's hard to predict when tables will get up but it was getting ridiculous. After two hours, we were sat with no apology. While we certainly could have chosen to leave and go to another restaurant, it was ridiculous. \n   On to the food. The deviled eggs and gnocchi were well received at the table. Two people got the burger, one got the steak and I had the sole. The sole was very good, the steak got rave reviews, and the burger had lukewarm reactions. Desserts looked delicious. \n   All in all, the food was very enjoyable, but absolutely not worth a two hour wait.

Wine selections are great and I like that they offer carafes for certain wines.\n\n2. The way the menu is laid out. It makes it super easy to find something for exactly what you're craving.\n\n3. The ambiance is great and it's excellent people watching. The overall crowd is skewed older (40+), but you get a nice smattering of young professionals as well. \n\n4. The food is so good and perfect for sharing. \n\nI've been twice with just one other person, and deviled eggs, brussel sprout chips, burratta and one entree were more than enough. With three people, we did the same, but added a side and we each had more than enough to eat. \n\nMy picks: deviled eggs (cut it in half though, since the flavor is so powerful that you'll need two bites to savor the full flavor. Stuffing the whole thing in your mouth is just tragic.), burratta with fried lemon and basil - yum!, polenta side, the steak and the burger! \n\nI'd skip: the brussell sprout chips don't do it for me. Not because they're not yummy, but because they have a funky aftertaste to me. The scallops entree - they were fishy.  \n\nPro tip - make a reservation on OpenTable.

And it was an actual portion size, not something that your paying money for and looking at your plate and thinking where the heck is the rest of my meat!\nThe birthday boy had the Demons on Horseback and said that it was so good and the hint of bacon was perfect!\nIf you have a birthday and let them know you get a piece of complimentary birthday which was chocolate and red velvet cakes layered. You can also order a piece of the cake even if its not your birthday!\nI cannot wait to come back here in the future!!", "author": "Stephanie M."}

My waitress was prompt, attentive, and engaging.  If only the food wasn't disappointing I could have regaled you all with tales of the latest great North Beach restaurant.  Sadly, the arugula salad that tasted like a lemon bomb, the oily beef tartar, and the uninspired and bland tuna prevent me from doing so.   \n\nPark Tavern is definitely a scene, a place to see and be seen.

We've been trying to get to park tavern for a while now but unsurprisingly it took forever to get a saturday reservation. Annoying. Worth the wait though as park tavern lived up to the hype. One of the coolest atmospheres I've seen in a while, a great bar area and scene to have a cocktail before dinner. The vibe of the whole restaurant is lively but cozy and classy, hard to explain but pretty much exactly what I'm looking for. The hostess was very friendly and even offered us a few choices as to which table we wanted.\n\nAs for the food, top notch! Everything we tried was absolutely amazing, the only exception being the burrata which was a bit strange and not very good. Deviled eggs, amazing but I actually like wayfare's better but these are awesome as well. Demons on horseback were also a pleasant surprise that I would order again. For entrees we ordered the mussels and pork. Mussels were good and the cream sauce was something different that you usually don't see mussels in. The pork was some of the best I've tasted in a while. So tender and flavorful!! Amazing. We also shared the twice baked potato and brussel sprout chips. Both I'd consider must haves. I would say the dessert was a little bit of a letdown but by this point we were so full I didn't care that much. \n\nBartender, hostess, waitress were all very nice and accommodating. Prices aren't cheap but fairly standard for sf dining. Parking is tough but they  have valet if needed for 10$ or cab it. Will definitely be back ASAP had a fabulous time!!", "author": "Kate N."}

I had some friends in town, so wanted to have a nice dinner in a place that could accommodate a 16 month old.  From start to finish, this place delivered.  When I called to confirm that they had a highchair for my friend's kid, and inquired whether it was ok that someone in our party (the bf) would be running late, they didn't bat an eye, and basically said \"we're here to serve you.\"  The excellent service continued throughout the night; our waitress was very accommodating of our little group.\n\nThe food was to die for.  My friend and I started with the crab and lobster bisque---yummy!!!  Not too creamy, had some bits of crab and lobster, and I loved the puff pastry that came with it.  For the main course, both she and I got the filet mignon.  OMG, so tender and juicy.  And the potatoes that came with it were heavenly.  My boyfriend scarfed down his mussels, and my friend's husband seemed to really enjoy his scallops.\n\nThe atmosphere was perfect.

We waited around for some bar seats to open up but someone always got there before us! Oh well, we got drinks anyways. The bartenders took a really long time to make our drinks. I got the Washington Square and this drink made my face pucker so hard that the creases on my face overlapped, I looked like a Chinese shar pei. I love me some sour patch kids but this drink was too sour for me. My next drink was the Mclaren. That was a nice change. I really enjoyed this drink, it was refreshing. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the local halibut and brussels sprouts chip. The halibut had a party in my mouth, there were so many different flavors but it all tasted really good together. For $12, you only get 4 pieces. This dish is overpriced but it's a must try item. The brussels sprouts chip was very addicting. Once you start eating it, you can't stop. One small complaint, the salt and oil were unevenly distributed, I had a few chips that were either really oily or extremely salty. I had the steamed mussels for dinner and it was incredible!

So, upon reading an article on San Francisco's best new restaurants, I decided to give Park Tavern a try and was glad I did.\n\nFirst off, I didn't make my 8:30pm reservation until 6:00pm that same evening and had no trouble at all, whereas all of the other SF go-to hot spots were completely booked days in advance (my own fault, I know). I'm assuming this is because Park Tavern is huge, and also it's still pretty new.\n\nUpon arriving, the hostess was extremely friendly and helpful. Our table wasn't quite ready yet, but she made sure we were seated within a few minutes and even offered to take our drink orders while we waited. The place was insanely packed and loud, and I could definitely tell she was a pro at her job.\n\nWe started off with the deviled eggs which were INCREDIBLE. The lobster bisque was also amazing. Some of the other dishes we tried, however, weren't as great, like the arugula salad which was drowned in truffle oil and the filet mignon which was insanely salty (and I like my food over-seasoned, so you can probably imagine how much I felt like I was eating a block of salt). Overall the food was great, though, including dessert. I had the birthday cake which comes complete with a lit candle. Drinks were also amazing. In fact, their margarita is the best I've ever had-- seriously. And, the coffee comes in an adorable mini French press and is served with a cute bowl of sugar cubes.\n\nService and ambiance were great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-11", "description": "We had read good things about the place so we booked it for a 50th birthday dinner for a friend.  We were seated promptly. The atmosphere was fine.\n\nI made sure early in our interaction with the waiter that we were not in a hurry that evening.  We took out time looking over the menu and would mentally back into what we would be drinking that evening based on what we wanted to eat.\n\nThis was the first clue that something was amiss.  The waiter kept pushing us to order drinks before we were ready.  We ordered some cocktails, in lieu of considering champagne just to get him away.\n\nWe decided on four appetizers, the brussel sprout chips (very nice, but too salty), the seafood gnocchi (good), and the venison-steak tartar (very good). The deviled eggs were to die for.  \n\nAt this point he really pushed us to order our main course.  We were not allowed to linger over our cocktails to consider our choices between our conversations.\n\nOur cocktails came and very soon after the appetizers.  We assumed that in 2 minutes the bread would arrive as how does one eat steak tartar with something to put it on?  The waiter disappeared and it took a good while to get some bread.  \n\nI had ordered a French onion soup.  It came not 30 seconds after the bread hit the table to eat the Tartar.  We did tell him we were not in a hurry; he ignored it and did not cadence the courses at all.\n\nThe French onion soup was a small cup with a near solid mass of onion and reduced mushroom with a slice of bread and cheese on it.  There was almost no liquid in the \"soup\" at all.  The flavor was nice, but soup it was not.\n\nWe ended up ordering some win after we finished the appetizers and the soup.  Almost as soon as the wine got ordered the main course hit the table.  The wine lagged behind the meal and again felt rushed just as everything had since we sat down.\n\nThe main courses were short ribs (excellent), sea scalps (very good), and I had mussels and clams (not good).  The broth-sauce that the sea food came in was so rich and heavy you could not taste the mussels and clams at all. I had to ask for more bread even though most people who have a giant bowl of this sort want to dunk as the waiter did not pick up on that fact. The mushroom side dish was fine.\n\nWe had the chocolate birthday cake, panna cotta, and the seasonal crisp for desert. The crisp was excellent. The panna cotta was very good.  The chocolate birthday cake was a solid hunk of chocolate more akin to a dense brownie than a birthday cake.  \n\nThe food consistency, meaning very good to excellent across the board should have been attained for a restaurant of this caliber.  It was hit and miss at best.\n\nThe service was amateur hour. It had all the trappings of formal service but none of the substance.  The waiter failed to perceive that we were interested in a slow well cadenced evening.  The course delivery overlapped. Basics such as bread had to be asked for.  The waiter did not check in regular intervals after the deliver of each course to see how things were going.\n\nAll in all, I do not think we would go back.", "author": "sondra g."}

It was cooked well but was sort of bland. The spinach and potatoes at the bottom was also oily and meh. Cool concept though. Honestly, I'm super excited to go back again and will go soon!", "author": "Jennifer W."}

The space is grand and very well-done, and still warm and cozy.  It's fun people-watching with an eclectic crowd both young and older.\n\nThe food is hearty, interesting and delicious.  I think the menu doesn't do the dishes justice actually.  The flavors and combinations are more drool-worthy than they read on paper.  Also, great cocktails...\n\nOnly complaint is the cheese plate.  Three cheeses that you have to order together... None of them that interesting to me, and two of the three are definitely not loved by all (a washed rind and a blue).  C'mon.....

It was hard to choose from their menu because everything looked amazing. The decor was subtle and sophisticated. Very up and coming.

As someone who used to be a North Beach local, I'm really happy to see that they've completely turned this space around. The rustic woods and blue-grey walls made this place masculine and warm. \n\nWe started off our meal with the warm baguette with goat milk butter and a variety of jams. It was delicious. Everyone in our party agreed we could eat this as our entire meal. \n\nThen we also tried the following items:\nRaspberry & Blueberry Dutch Baby - This was delicious and we saved this for our 'desert' item. The berries were a good combination of sweet and tart. \n\nButter Lettuce & Maine Lobster salad - This left little to be desired. It had a nice flavor but we couldn't find much lobster on it. Not worth the $17. \n\nCrispy Polenta Cakes with Wild Mushrooms - The flavor of this plate was amazing, especially if you are a mushroom/truffle lover. I'm usually not a fan of grit-like texture and runny eggs, but the combination of ingredients on this plate were great. \n\nI enjoyed the entire experience - the decor, the meal, the company. \n\nThe next time I'm in town I'll be back for lunch and/or dinner.", "author": "Amy T."}

It's cozy (if a teeny bit dark), with lots of black tiling and dark wood.  There are cozy booths around the perimeter and a great bar to sit at.\n\nWent there last night for 'date night' with hubby.   As with another reviewer, I was unimpressed with the 2 Hawaiian rolls we were given (with dishes whisked away practically as soon as our hands had left them - no refills as with other places).  The butter has pork fat in it, and so we were given an additional one for me without the fat.\n\nIf you want to be complete vegetarian the menu is severely lacking - the veggie on the table next to me ended up with the tiny appetizer of heirloom baby carrots as her main course.  I opted for the steamed mussels & fennel sausage, leeks, cr\u00e8me fraiche, white wine with two WAFER THIN slices of grilled bread - and picked out the sausage on to hubby's plate.  Tasty but disappointing as there were several mussels that were closed up, and therefore not fit to eat, but still served to me.\n\nOn the upside if you are a meatatarian the mini chicken \"Poulet Rouge, Bloomsdale spinach & Peewee potatoes\" looked impressive and husband said it was delicious!\n\nWe shared a tasty fig and apple crisp for dessert - the apple peel was a little tough but it was yummy.\n\nWait service was friendly - very prompt, even if they were a bit rushed on a Thursday.

In fact I can sit and eat a bowl of rice sprinkled with just salt and be a happy camper. But the intense amount of sodium I experienced at Park Tavern last night was unbearable. We started with the duck liver mousse, which was very good, however we noticed it was quite salty. We moved on to the persimmon, buratta and coppa salad which was excellently balanced and quite refreshing. At this point the food seemed quite promising. Then came the lobster bisque and the steak tartare and both dishes were insanely over seasoned. By the time we were done eating I felt as though I'd been licking a salt block like a farm animal might. I'm not over exaggerating when I say that I could actually feel my blood pressure rising by the end of our meal! It was pretty unbearable. I was even fearful that dessert might be salty and we agreed that we wouldn't order any dessert described having \"sea salt\" or \"fleur de sel.\" We ended up just skipping dessert due to our fear and left the restaurant with disappointment.

Simple sashimi either needs to be the highest quality fish such that adornment is unnecessary, or throw so much flavor at it that it's an explosion. This is somewhere inbetween, and reminded me of the pathetic \"look at me I'm fancy food but really I have no taste because nobody actually put effort into this dish\" hors d'oeuvres they often serve at upscale catered parties.\n\nI downed that with a glass of the Laurent-Perrier Brut, lovely and toasty.\n\nI next had the Manila Clam Chowder, which imnsho completely missed the target. There's not much need or way to re-invent creamy clam chowder; there are hundreds of recipes and variations, and the whole thing is a known quantity. Stick with traditional preparations and just use high quality ingredients.\n\nPark Tavern seems to be trying to re-invent clam chowder, so the soup is not as creamy as traditional, and the clams are whole, not chopped. The problem is that the clams are very salty and well, clammy, so chopping them distributes both the flavor and the salt throughout the chowder. What you get at Park Tavern is instead a relatively weak base with occasional whole clams that commandeer all your taste buds in a salty, under the boardwalk kind of way. I give them a B for effort, but the end result should be scrapped.\n\nBut then we get to the pork chop, which was not only the best pork chop I've had in 15+ years, but was cooked perfectly, exactly the way I asked for it. Too many restaurants overcook pork because of old school fears of trichinosis, and even a brined chop can be very tough. I specifically asked the waiter how tender the chop was, and told him how much I hate dry pork. Well, there was no need for concern because it was buttery smooth, perfectly pink, and so good I was gnawing at the bones afterwards. I'd go back just for that chop.\n\nI didn't try the desserts, but the very limited selection seemed perfunctory, as if they don't have a dessert chef.\n\nI'll have to try the Marlowe burger to see how it compares.\n\n\n\nEdit September 2013: I've now eaten at Park Tavern probably 5 times since my first review, and they keep getting better. I've raised my rating one star in appreciation, it's my go-to restaurant in NB. I've had so many good meals there now, I guess they keep vetting the menu to remove things that are not so good and keeping the things that are. The last time I was there 3 of my party had Marlowe Burgers, but I didn't, they all thought it delicious, and one of them had been to Marlowe and tried it there.", "author": "Rob C."}

So glad there is finally a little variety in eateries lining Washington Square Park!\n\nI love the ambiance; dim lighting, view of the park, seating arrangements with a long family style tall table by the bar. The staff were all attentive, friendly and offered great suggestions. I remember hearing complaints about the service when Joey and Eddie's occupied the space so it was great to find that was not the case.\n\nSat at the long table with two dinner guests; we were right in the thick of conversations, cocktails, and delicious food...it was perfect for a Saturday evening girls dinner.\n\nStarters:\n1.Deviled eggs \n- Delicious! Served as singles so we ordered 1/each. Love the bacon on top and will go back for more :)\n2. Burrata \n- Pretty good...I am a big burrata fan and may just be being snotty but It was tasty and I would recommend it; just not the best I have had.\n3. Prawns\n - Very tasty...the sauce was a little spicy (how I like it!) and made for a good sauce to sop up with the table bread.\n\nEntrees:\n1. Pork Chop\n- Really liked the dish as a whole, well prepared and enjoyed it. We all 3 shared each of the starters and entree's. \n2. Arugula Salad\n- The server mentioned this salad was popular and I can see why. It was flavorful and since none of the other dishes we got had much green it was refreshing to include a salad.\n3. Mussels\n- Yum! I love mussels and thought these were really good. Loved using the broth to dip table bread in and the sausage was a nice touch.\n\nGreat first experience and can't wait to come back for more!", "author": "Amanda S."}

I went here for my grandma's 80th birthday brunch and was truly impressed. The ambiance and service at the place are spectacular. The food is original and quite delicious. My only hope is that they might add a few more items to the menu. I was also unimpressed by the brunch drinks. Their Bloody Mary was way too spicy and I am still not sure what they were trying to accomplish with their Tequila Based Bloody Mary as it came out in an odd green color and had a rather odd flavor to it.\n\nOrdering Advice:\nI see that people have been writing about the toast below. I actually found the toast to be quite delicious. It is a little bit expensive and rather basic, but there is something quite original and truly delicious in the toast creations that they have made.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "Park Tavern is in a prime location overlooking Washington Square Park, itself a crown jewel in the charming neighborhood of North Beach.\n\nThe difficulty in getting to the restaurant is eased by their valet parking, which is all but a necessity in North Beach. Easily worth the eleven dollar fee plus tip to not put yourself through trying to find parking anywhere in that vicinity.\n\nWe began the evening by sipping on a PT Old Fashioned and an Ed's Negroni while perusing the menu. These drinks were strong and gave us the impression that Park Tavern is going for an old school, no-nonsense approach to their cocktails. While the bartenders could certainly whip up one, don't count on seeing anything featuring egg whites on the drink menu. It also made me realize how firmly ensconced I am in new school cocktail culture. Guess I'm a wuss.\n\nFor food, we started with the NY Steak crudo, horseradish, arugula & parmesan, and the PT fries, shaved black truffle & parmesan, truffle aioli, soft boiled egg & Osetra caviar. The presentation of each was great, the fries arriving in a small urn and the crudo plate sparsely yet artfully decorated with steak, arugula and parmesan. We would have preferred that the dish arrive with a third more steak than it did, but the quality was high. Those fries were *really* good. Every bit worth the twenty dollar price. With the shaved truffles on top, dipping the fries in that egg and caviar was pretty darn divine.\n\nWe followed those nice starters with the Petit \"Poulet Rouge\", Bloomsdale spinach & Peewee potatoes, and the Angus Filet Mignon, twice-cooked potatoes, creamed greens & black turnip mushrooms. The standup chicken ended up requiring a lot of work to consume, but it was moist and flavorful. The filet mignon was marvelous. A generous portion that was soft and juicy, with a wonderful flavor. The juice alone elicited several 'MMmmmms' from yours truly. Both chicken and steak lay in a bed of spinach and potatoes that was tasty and complimentary.\n\nWe washed down the entrees with glasses of the Fisticuffs Cabernet Sauvignon and the Segromigno Sangiovese. I hemmed and hawed between the Cab and the Tierra Secreta Malbec. Should have gotten the latter, as I felt the Cab was a bit sweet for the steak. The tannic Malbec would have made a better pairing.\n\nWe finished up with Lemon Cheesecake Parfait and one of those boozy floats. The French 125 featured Prosecco, lemon sorbet and maybe a splash of bourbon. The parfait tasted every bit as good as it looked. Marvy.\n\nThe waiter was fairly friendly and certainly knowledgeable. The wait staff overall was attentive without being ever-present.\n\nThe noise level here is lively, encouraging you lean in a bit to hear each other. It's not however so loud that you can't hear yourself think.\n\nThe bill plus tip had us shelling out just over two bills. Not surprising given the environs and quality of the food, but also not something that we could do very often. I'd give Park Tavern five stars if the bill was 15% less.\n\nWe did like the decor and the ambiance of the place, and the wall of windows were great to take in the beauty and charm of Washington Square Park.\n\nI'm sure that we'll be back, provided that they don't lose that valet parking...", "author": "Steve R."}

The food was incredible, the service was even better. There was always someone there to take care of our requests happily and without hesitation. Montana, the private events director, was very helpful and took care of everything on the day of the event just as we had discussed. \n\nMy mom is vegan, so we requested a special entree for her (we were eating family style). Not only did they give her a special entree, but every other dish that they could modify for her, they did. They really went above and beyond to take care of us.\n\nThe nice thing about the Park Tavern menu is that it is accessible to a lot of people with different tastes. It balances familiar comfort food with interesting and innovative combinations so that there's something for everyone and people can explore without feeling out of place. We heard positive feedback on the food from everyone in our group!", "author": "Danae M."}

Staff were a half hour late seating us and then to a round that would comfortably seat five set up for six (which was tight) until we reminded them we were seven. They reset the table for seven--it was ridiculous. I got nowhere with the host staff \"if you want to wait another hour we'll have something\". Are you kidding me? Finally the floor manager came and offered that we could start our night at the round and once the two fours behind us finished dessert, we could move. We agreed. She sent over a couple of appetizers, which was a much appreciated gesture, and had the rest of the evening gone well, that and switching tables would have been enough to save the evening. As it was, the service at the round was poor and /beyond/ slow, but at least we got to move before the main course came (over an hour after we ordered it). I will admit some of the food was delicious (Brussels sprout chips! Pumpkin soup!) but my salad was meh and awfully small for twelve bucks, my NY steak was tough as shoe leather, but at that point I had to just eat it and go because the birthday girl was late getting to her party because we spent three hours at the fricken restaurant! I couldn't wait to leave anyway. The place was /so/ loud and crammed.\n\nI felt bad for our second server. I give her top marks. She was no-nonsense, efficient, and did her best to recover the evening for us. I wish I had gotten her name. Management if you read these? Hang on  for dear life to the 40ish bleach blond with the glasses and ponytail who worked the dinner shift on Friday the 25th. \n\nNote: after we were moved they crammed /another/ party of seven into that small round. It was a bunch of very young women who were clearly cramped but either too timid or otherwise unable to manage to get their party moved. We watched them elbow each other and constantly shift in their chairs as staff tried to move around them and thought, \"well, at least we got to eat our dinner without getting hit in the teeth\".\n\nWill not go back.", "author": "Miz J."}

My partner and I grabbed a couple Hummingbird cocktails, and they were delicious (St. Germain, grapefruit, and bubbly). We ordered the cinnamon sugar challah, pork confit hash, and the burger. All items were very good, but the absolute star of the meal were the potatoes. The fries with the burger and the homefries with the hash were super SUPER CRISPY. Which is exactly how I like them.

We started with the brussel sprout chips, which were highly recommended - lightly fried, crispy and tasty, loved it!  We shared a dungeness crab salad which was just right, refreshing and light with good-sized pieces of dungeness crab - yum!  Also, recommended on Check Please was the poulet noir (allow 30 minutes) - tasty, juicy and tender and very dramatically displayed propped up on a stand so you can easily carve the meat from the bone.  I got full so I took half of it home, but there's always room of dessert!  We got the TCHO chocolate creme brullee - creamy chocolate-y, nice.

We started off with the trout dip appetizer that came with their own chips which was only so so.  I'd rather have some unhealthy onion dip with kettle chips.  We also got the deviled eggs which are supposedly a \"have to get\"  item.  It was pretty good, but I don't understand what all the hype is about.  It comes with a piece of bacon on top that is just WAY too salty and it overpowers the egg completely.  I didn't really mind that these were only average dishes because I was so hungry.  Then, I ordered their black cod.  When the fish came, it looked shriveled like an old grandma's toe.  It tasted even worse.  It wasn't fresh at all; it was almost as if they let it sit in the corner of the kitchen floor for days!  And plus, they charged us up the hoo-hah for it! We sent it back immediately and instead of receiving a new menu to decide what I wanted, the waiter just said, \"What do you want to order now?\" pressuring me to make a last minute decision.  My dad piped in and said I'll take a burger.  Luckily I didn't have to wait long for it-- keep in mind that I was famished.  It was a just an average burger: nothing special and somewhat under seasoned.  After we all finished our entrees, I figured that maybe they could redeem themselves with dessert.  Nope.  However, I've complained enough, and you can probably figure out what I'm going to say.  I'll spare you, Park Tavern, from my rage.\n\nNever again.", "author": "Stefanie T."}

This place is the exact opposite of anything dark or dank. It is very much bright and trendy and not tavern like in any way shape or form.

The food is truly that good. I was going into the evening hoping to spare my waistline a calorie overload, but once I looked at the menu, I knew I'd be throwing those goals out the window. \n\nThis restaurant has a charming, cozy and trendy vibe wrapped into one. Each table is within pretty close proximity of each other but it's so vibrant inside, you don't really pay attention to the table next to you. We began the feast with brussell sprout chips, burrata cheese with lemon basil chips and deviled eggs. I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the burssel sprout chips and my taste buds were pleased with the choice after just one bite. These are the leaves of the sprous basked in olive oil and baked to perfection. They are cirspy, salty and just plain delicious. The deviled eggs are just a perfect little taste and you can order them individually. I'm not typically a deviled egg fan but these were delicious. \n\nFor the entree, I was told they are known for their poulet rouge (rotisserie chicken) so I had to order it. Yes, this chicken actually came out completely whole on the rotisserie skewer and sitting on a bed of potatoes and spinach. It was the most phenomenal presentation I've seen in awhile and the table next to us even made a comment! This is not your ordinary chicken either. No, they do something to this chicken to make it moist with flavor that's spicy and sweet all together. It almost tasted like a gourmet buffalo wing sauce. The spinach complimented the chicken. I didn't really eat the potatoes but mostly because my tummy was already begging me to stop consuming food! However, you can't end the night with chicken, so we shared a piece of birthday cake. Yes, they have birthday cake on the menu and each month has a different flavor. This month (March), they are featuring strawberry birthday cake. It's a heavenly combination of fluffy cake, creamy frosting and fresh strawberry mixed inside. It was a perfectly sweet way to end the meal and I can't wait until I get to visit this foodie's paradise again.", "author": "Lindsey D."}

The service delivered the entry split even though we didn't ask for it. That was nice.  I was very happy with my lunch overall.  The restaurant was decorated very respectably for the holiday.  It wasn't too much or too little. Classy.\n\nAs for dinner, I had the game hen, which takes 30 minutes to cook.  It was worth the wait because we occupied ourselves with the wedge salad and the brussel sprouts.  What I liked about the wedge salad was that it was not made with ice berg lettuce but butter lettuce.  It was very nice.    The hen comes with stuffing and even though my friend and I split, I had enough for a light lunch the next day.

My friend got a couple sides for her dinner, thinking to be healthier - and she had the same experience - just drowned in oil.  She had the twice baked potato dish and the brussel sprouts.  She felt sick for two days after as well.  So that's the food.  The wait staff was nice, but a little pushy.  I felt like our waiter twisted our arm to get the deviled eggs.

It is a long weekend and the area wa very busy. Had not checked out this location since the venerable Moose's closed and so wasnt sure what to expect. The place was packed and so we sat at the communal table - fantastic experience and fantastic meal! The menu isn't extensive but very well-rounded and everything sounded great. The recommendations from the people sitting around us made the decisions even more difficult as everyone was raving about what they were eating. I finally decided on the Halibut with fennal and potatoes but was still debating on the sides - either Dungenss Crab Salad or Smoked Pumpkin Soup. The waiter recommended the soup, which I ordered and it was truly spectacular; it had a very smoky flavor, toasted pumpkin seeds and fried sage - outstanding! The Halibut was perfectly seared and roasted and was served with fennel with an excellent creamy-type sauce on it - very nice combination and something I'm going to try to recreate at home. My friend had the short ribs, which were extremely tender and flavorful. I had no expectations of having dessert, but I succumbed to  the \"White Russian\" Affogato - fabulous! Homemade white russian ice cream with an espresso and rum sauce and homemade marshmallow and cocoa nibs. Really spectacular and not overly large, which for me is actually a good thing in a dessert. My friend had the Almond Joy and raved about it as well. \n\nThe service was very good, although perhaps a tad slow, but really nothing to complain about. The other diners at the communal table were all very social and we had a great time talking with everyone so any slowness really wasn't an issue. The atmosphere is excellent - upscale and a bit trendy, but restrained and tasteful at the same time. Overall a very diverse crowd with a very healthy sampling of the young and beautiful. \n\nPark Tavern is a great addition to the North Beach dining scene and I will definitely return.

Cool presentation, moist & delicious. Beware: it comes whole and you carve it yourself. Gasp! I dig that, but imagine a lot of foofy people would balk it.

This restaurant rates one of the best of SF in my opinion. We had the deviled eggs, smoked crab dip, truffle fries, lobster bisque and the pork chop between my husband and I. Every bite was quite orgasmic in its own sense. The eggs were the perfect balance between creamy with a pickled pepper and a cilantro sauce. (better than Wayfarer Tavern). The smoked crab dip was plentiful and had a great smokiness top with Ikura. The truffles fried were seriously amazing. Shaved truffle, white truffle aioli, then a soft boiled egg with osetra caviar... Can it be any better? Then the lobster bisque was explosive with flavor not with too much cream. It came with a perfect bread pastry stick that made it almost too rich, but really it was perfect.then we had the pork chop which was brined then grilled. This was 3 stars in my book bc it leaned on the salty side and the polenta was overly creamy. I needed something to cut the richness.\n\nThe birthday cake was probably the least exciting.

I like you a lot more for your bites and appetizers than your entrees, but that's still saying a lot. \n\nBrussel sprout chips: Flaky, crispy, salted goodness with just the right amount of charring.\nLemon chips: Thin and crispy, with a bit of citrus and tang, and good with the burrata cheese, but just as good without. \nFoie gras terrine: I have to taste this one more time before foie gras gets  banned! Here's the thing, my allergies were acting up pretty bad and my nose was clogged, but i could STILL taste the  goodness. I can only imagine what it would taste like if my taste buds were at full capacity. Smoked kumquats were also yummy as well.\nTwice baked potato: Dripping with yummy butter and creamy, with big bites of potato skin.\nFish dish: Can't remember what fish, but tender and moist, with a very nice crispy skin. Could have used more salt. Would pass for the next time though.\nMarlowe burger: This was a bit of a disappointment and I can't understand the hype. True, the patty was juicy, but I didn't taste anything unique.  Also, I had one small clump of what looked like iceberg lettuce (maybe about an 1.25 inches in diameter placed exactly in the middle of my bun, along with the caramelized onions dead center and the aoili, so there was a pretty uneven distribution. Bites all around the edges only got me meat, bun, and bits of bacon (okay, the bacon was perfectly cooked, so I'll give you that. bacon chips!).  Anyhow, pearl's burgers are much better to me.  Oh, but the french fries were really good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of salt. \nPork chop: Omg. Looks like a freaking steak. Moist and flavorful, even with a clogged nose.  Great char on the outside too.  My friend (who actually ordered the dish) thought the pork belly was wonderful.

So why the low rating? \n\nBecause every single time I've gone here, the prices have gone up. They've been open for less than a year.\n\nTwo examples off the top of my head: deviled eggs - from $1.50 each to $2 after they were featured in 7x7's 100 list. That might not sound like a lot, but it comes out to about a 33% increase. Next: the PT fries. I can't remember exactly what they used to be, but it was under $15 (probably more like $12). They're now $20!!! They're just potatoes with some truffle oil and caviar that you can't even taste.\n\nI understand that you have to pay for quality food in San Francisco, but could the owners be any more money grubbing? I guess this is what happens when restaurant owners care more about money than loyal customers. I'm not sure if they think that the locals won't notice the large increases or if they're banking on a tourist crowd that will never know they're getting screwed, but they've definitely turned this local away for good.

Right away, all four of us just loved the ambiance and decor. The bar area was very lively and busy. We had a reservation and they seated us right away, although we were about 15 minutes early. We started with some cocktails, I enjoyed a Moscow Mule, my current favorite. Here though, they were a tad heavy with the lime juice and bitters - it was too tart compared to the ones I usually enjoy at other establishments.  My Dad and StepMom enjoyed some sauvignon blanc which they both said was very good.  Dad is serious about wine, and he remarked that their selections were impressive.  We next had the brussels sprout chips - soooo good. I'd had them at Marlowe and they were just as yummy here. I also had the pea soup, it was a summer style soup served at room temperature. It was a tad runny, but had excellent fresh pea flavor. Hubby had the prawns in lardo (sounds gross, I know, but it isn't what you might think) - they were heaven. Best prawns either of us had ever experienced. Dad enjoyed the anchovies and we all loved the fresh bread. I had the halibut on a potato and corn \"risotto\" and it was one of the best preparations of any fish dish I've had. Portions were perfect.  Hubby and StepMom had the black cod, they loved it. Dad had the Ahi, and also enjoyed it. We finished by sharing the peach cobbler and the dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e...they were very good, cobbler was a tad bland, but it did allow for the flavor of the peaches to dominate, rather than the toppings, I guess.  Husband had a nice espresso and Dad and StepMom had dessert wines - all three were happy with their selections. The people watching was fabulous - a see and be seen sort of vibe.  Lots of very young women wearing clothing that left nothing to the imagination and/or shoes that were two sizes too tall and trying to gracefully navigate their way to their table or the restroom, and plenty of men admiring their efforts.  I think our only constructive criticism would be that every time our plates came out from the kitchen, they were delivered to the wrong person at the table and that the wait between appetizers and main course was every bit of a half hour, maybe more. That's a little too long, but we made the best of it with all that people watching. I would go back, for sure, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.", "author": "Rachel H."}

If chicken is that good to deem a return, there's nothing more to say. But why? Now I would say it's the best damn chicken I've ever eaten, but I'm going to save you the hyperbole (that often exists when people talk about food) and note it's not actually chicken... it's game hen. Yeah same deal, but there is an advantage of using a young chicken that lends itself to being tender and juicy. That being said (and I'll go ahead use the word \"best\"), it is the best piece of roasted poultry I've had in the city. The fire roasted and perfectly seasoned skin would raise suspicion that the meat could be dry. Not so! As I attacked the wings and legs the meat was, excuse the KFC reference, finger lickin' good! Then as you slice into the breast meat and see the juice seep out you already know it's a winner. It was. Go get it. Stop reading all this hype. I should also mention that its standing at your attention when served to your table! You'll see. Go get it. Damn, I guess I did not save you the hyperbole...\n\nAs for everything else, it was above average if not very good. Park Tavern could be just another cookie cutter, urban socialite, new American cuisine with a signature bar program resto that has flooded the restaurant scene. So many of these types of places are just another face in the crowd. The element that hits is the food. And obviously that's the element that brings an establishment up to the high echelon of restaurants that will ensure its longevity. Soon enough it will be mentioned in the same breath as NOPA, Marlowe (its sister restaurant), Zuni Cafe, etc.\n\nAnd one last piece, Park Tavern's poultry blows the following out of the water: Zuni Cafe's Roasted Chicken on Warm Bread Salad that has a one hour prep time from ordering and NOPA's Rotisserie Herbed Chicken. \n\nDamn, I really suck at controlling my excitement for food.

The lovely hostess, Adrianne, told us our table was ready anytime and that we could either sit immediately or have a drink.  We opted to have a drink first.  The friendly bartender poured a couple of delicious drinks including an Old Fashioned and a Makers Manhattan.  $12 a pop, but that's pretty standard pricing for this type of restaurant.\nSoon after we were seated at our table our server came over and poured the champagne that we had brought with us.  I called beforehand to ask about the corkage fee and they said they would waive it if we purchased of their bottles.  Our server recommended a fantastic Spanish white (Albari\u00f1o Legado del Conde).  He also suggested a few apps that would go well with it including the Demons on Horseback and one of their raw apps.  Both were amazing.  We also ordered the Brussels sprout chips which were equally as good.  for mains we had the steamed mussels, pork cop, and the burger.  My mom said it was the best burger she's ever had and my pork chop was pretty amazing as well.  For dessert we had the apple crisp and the chocolate creme brulee.

Alicja helped me set everything up, and Brian and crew ruled as servers, keeping the wine/cocktails flowing and being super attentive w/out bugging.  The food!!! Standouts were burrata on lemon chips w/pea tendrils, (duh) Brussels sprout chips, (duh again) deviled eggs, poulet rouge and sliced filet in red wine jus.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-27", "description": "Ed and Mary Etta Moose made Washington Square Park the cradle of civilization in North Beach starting in the early 1970's when they brought us The Washington Square Bar & Grill on Powell at Union and later at Moose's across the Park.  Each was a landmark destination that became the hub or portal that unified San Franciscans in dialogue and spirited collaboration that enriched and never eroded the quality of life and spirit in 'The City That Knows How\".  I loved Park Tavern before I nibbled a single bite for the tribute table honoring Mary Etta Moose, the artist, gourmand, philanthropist and spirited voice of beautiful North Beach, the community.\n\nI haven't tried the much of the menu yet, but I can attest to the quality and scrumptiousness of their burger, my heart's true calling.  I first tried Marlowe's after it first opened and loved it, especially the burger and fries.  Kinship to Marlowe's becomes harder to see the deeper you explore the eclectic, electric and exciting menu, and the more you take in the design that marry's so many warm and comfortable elements, remembered and wanted, that simply aren't in evidence elsewhere in the city.  The place is crowded like Moose's was, and the crowd is a melting pot like Moose's so it's got the feel of a place you want to be a regular at and be known by name and your unique peculiarities by the staff and your fellow regulars.  Former Mayor Brown has dubbed the place a success and a must stop on his weekly rounds, so maybe it arrived before the delivery.\n\nThe exposed kitchen that Ed and Mary Etta created is spiffed up and is the anchoring element of the well executed restaurant.  It's amazing how good the 'bones' of Moose's remain, because I still feel Ed's warmth and big personality greeting one and all in the space he so lovingly created.  I said the menu is exciting and that may be an understatement because although the focus appears to be on small plates and the unusual, the food is stylish and uber sophisticated.  It's also a little on the pricy side, but that isn't hindering anyone from making their way here and back so I'd say they're doing a lot of things right and their customers think so too.  The bar is wonderful and drinks are inspired and delicious, the staff are well trained and well chosen.  Beer and Wine lists are well thought out, and the whole place is clean and inviting, masculine and powerful, a real testament to North Beach and Ed Moose, this place is a compelling winner.", "author": "Stu S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-30", "description": "Came here with a friend after SFGate alerted me to absolutely nothing going on in the City. It was a Monday after all. I heard Park Tavern was popular, and thought if anything was going on at Washington Square, it would center around the tavern. I had 9pm reservations, but we showed up early and found a spot at the bar. Jake, our bartender, greeted us like we were regulars... his charm and skillful mixology was enough that I abandoned my reservation of an outdoor table in favor on eating on the old Moose's bartop. I thought Gary Danko made a great blood and sand, but this one - served neat with an aromatic orange peel kiss to the sides of the glass - was tops. We had the obligatory deviled eggs and brussels sprout chips (YUM!), and while I ordered the only beef entree on the menu (NY Kobe Steak) my friend ordered the Poulette Noir. One note: it's best to sit at the bar when you order the Poulette Noir, it really does take 30 minutes, and you'll need at least one drink refill before it arrives.\n\nThe food was outstanding, but what made the night was Jake. He was soft spoken and cheerful, joining in on jokes and telling us stories about the bar and his travels. We were having so much fun, we actually closed the bar after an impromptu grappa tasting and a particularly tasty bit of cheddar. \n\nFor my experience, Park tavern is a place to go alone or with a good friend. Belly up to the bar and find Jake or one of the other skilled bartenders to guide your night.", "author": "Sean-Franc S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-29", "description": "Came here on the suggestion of a friend of a friend. With the name, I wasn't really expecting much. I thought it wouldn't be much more than an upscale pub! Ok, not quite... way, way better than that (and I'm not dissing upscale pub food... there is a time and a place for yuppie sauce and garlic/sweet potato fries... there were Fried Sunchokes instead! A yummy alternative...so maybe some of it does classify as upscale pub food) As a vegetarian, such places can present me with the problem of: what the eff do I eat that isn't a carb bomb?! Not so, here. Thank goodness. Though I would have been happy with a glass of wine and three courses of dessert at this place, I'm not ashamed to say it. \n\nI was so excited to see that they had Brooks Pinot from Oregon! The sight of it on the menu made me gushy. I believe their wine director is an Oregonian. I nearly passed out from pleasure. My favorite non-California purveyor: organic vineyards, reasonably priced, amazing light, true pinot noir. I should have gotten a whole bottle. (To share, of course.) My sommelier friend who was having dinner with our party was very impressed by their wine list, too, s it had a great range of reasonably priced-and-also-delightful wines and the impress-your-business-associates-or-your-date fancy pants French bottles, too. She knows a lot more about California wines than I do by about 30 years of experience, having lived and worked in the industry in Napa for the better part of two decades, so that's a good sign, too. \n\nWe arrived party of five, pre-dinner rush on a Saturday night without a reservation, so we weren't expecting prime seating, or anything. We were seated outside, which was fine, (fun people watching is always the appeal of San Francisco for me, there's a beautiful park across the street, and it's not an exceptionally loud or busy street, so just fine with me. Interesting to see all the fancily dressed folks arriving and popping out for the valet) since we didn't call ahead and it was a beautiful San Francisco spring evening, perfectly warm with the sun still shining and the heat lamps on us.Sometimes being seated outside can mean you get ignored by the wait staff/the somm, but not so here. We had a wonderful waiter. I unfortunately can't remember her name... attentive, and always seemed to be there when we needed her, without being overbearing. I never once felt rushed. \n\nThe food. Oh my gawd. Let me preface with... I was here with fellow chef friends, so we were not just some pile of neophyte tourists with travel/wine goggles on, oh mah! Ok, so I was starving, but I also didn't have any expectations. My favorite way to approach any old thing, so I'm even more delighted when the food is really damn good. Which it was. \n\nThe Parissienne Gnocchi... melt in your mouth. The English Peas with a creamy pea... sauce. Ugh... I'm sure it had some prettier name I'm not remembering, but it was so delightful, I could have licked the plate (I didn't. I have a few manners, at least). I wanted seconds, but my stomach would not have been happy with me. I definitely ate more than I should have, but I wanted to try it all. Fortunately for my waistline, I didn't. Wheel me away in a cart...\n\nThe place doesn't stand out to me aesthetically, at least from the outside, so I was just thinking it would be another California bistro. Blah blah blah. I didn't spend the time checking out the interior much, because I was more focused on eating and drinking and hanging out with my group of friends, because that is why we are here, no? So that's not a part of my review. Thank goodness the app plates are on the smaller side (but still, very generous, enough to share, but share several) and so I got to try a little bit of everything, so long as it didn't have meat on it. (My friend got The Demons on Horseback, which looked so delicious that I briefly considered breaking my 20 year streak of no meat...). The presentation was pleasing, beautiful, but not overly fussy. The flavors spoke for themselves. No need to gussy things up to an OTT level, to take away from the fact that your food is just so so like some not-to-be-named-here other supposed hot spots on the SF restaurant scene. \n\nI do wish there had been some sort of vegetarian main, in case you're not in the mood for sampling all the sides (I was. I usually am. That way I get to try a variety) though the meat dishes actually made me drool (seriously I haven't eaten red meat since before middle school, so that's something) and want to take a closer bite... I mean, look. It seems like they change up their menu though, so I'll be excited to go back in a few months when I'm in the city again for work, and maybe they will have a whole new slew of amazing to investigate. \n\nOne thing: thank goodness I got to put this on a business account, because the tab was in the $400 plus range, and one of our party was a small child who only had a lemonade. \n\nSpendy, but worth it, especially if someone else is paying.", "author": "WildCowsofBoont A."}

I arrived on time for my reservation and was told to wait in the bar. Fifteen minutes later my party was seated. Our waitress greeted us and was a little off from the start. She gave two of the three people at the table water and walked away. She then returned to announce that bread and pork fat butter would arrive soon with great enthusiasm. The bread and butter shortly arrived and I was less than impressed with the fancy hawaiian bread and butter that tasted simply like butter. We ordered a bottle of wine and our food. The pork bites arrived first. What the hell is this restaurant doing serving fancy pork rinds?!? I was so confused when they were placed on the table. These are the pork bites I have been reading about?!?! On a better note the deviled eggs came next, the highlight of my meal. I wish we ordered more than one per person for the table, because these are keepers. For my entree I ordered the famous Marlowe burger. A burger I have enjoyed many times at Marlowe, a burger I only ate half of at Park Tavern. The burger was simply OK, nothing like the Marlowe burger and nothing to write home about. We also ordered the twice baked potato side to share for the table, my first bite was amazing, my second was just OK and the third just sucked.\n\nI know Park Tavern just opened, so I will give you a second chance.

The \"Demons on Horseback\" are heavily sold, but honestly, shrimp with a little fat and veges, didn't impress me. Deviled eggs are hard NOT to like, these were actually good. Two of us had the pork chop, a disaster of odd misses. Oversalted, HIGHLY oversalted,  long leaf spinach, mixed in with turnips that were rubbery, (honestly, couldn't cut them with the knife), and chunks of bacon, square cut, but TOUGH, along with a butterflied pork chop, (really, the only reason to do that is to hurry up the cooking). But the meat WAS tasty, mostly due to the high level of fat on the chop,  in a delicious reduction.\nRubbery scallops, (same word 2x), but in a nice sauce on as skewer.

We got there at 7:30pm Friday night without a reservation, but, with a little team work, were able to snag a table at the bar in no time and it was the best seat in the house! We had an awesome waiter who anticipated our every need and when we hesitated on the wine decision we got some much appreciated guidance from their wine guy and ended up with an amazing cava we were all raving about, until he brought us the next bottle which was even better. The pork belly bites were sinfully, melt-in-your-mouth delicious and I highly recommend the brussel sprout chips, just to keep it healthy.

We were kindly contacted by the Maitre'd (Adrianne you're awesome) inviting us back. They expressed their utmost concern to rectify the situation with us since we left defeated last time. (I greatly appreciate them taking the time to read the reviews and having an open line of communication to their customers.) So, please know that they do see all the comments. With that said, I was still a skeptic and was hesitant about returning.\n\nWhen we went back at to Park Tavern I decided seeing the place in the light of day may change my outlook. So, we went for brunch. My fiance and i both were blown away by the level of excellent customer service and professionalism. Adrianne was extremely professional and greeted us at the door. Ileah was sincere in her concern to make our experience wonderful and changed my whole outlook on the establishment entirely. (She is amazing!) Our waiter Bo was funny, amazingly knowledgeable and extremely kind. I'd come back just for his recommendations. Love him! It was honestly the most pleasant meal I've ever had, point blank and the period.\n\n The food was fresh, flavorful, and filling. Everything we had that morning was good! Forgive me if I do not recall the names of the dishes. We started off with the caramelized grapefruit brulee with creme fresh. Tart, sweet, and fresh! The butter cake is a must order! Described by our waiter as 6 butter croissants mashed into a hockey puck. Lol crazy good! The cinnamon sugar challah was soft, warm and heaven. My fiance ordered the special - an open faced chicken sandwich with apple smoked bacon, chili pepper, and special sauce concoction that left him completely silent for a couple of minutes. I ordered the french toast with fresh blackberries. It was enjoyable and I am not partial to french toast. \n\nThe chocolate mousse brulee was delicious and neither of us had ever had a chocolate that was spiked with a kick of chili pepper. It was off putting at first but some how it brought out the flavor of the chocolate. If you are a chocolate lover I totally recommend! \n\nAfter this experience we agreed that we had forgotten what good service was and we needed to come back to park tavern to be reminded. We really did feel VIP for a day. The staff is kind and they really do care about great food and customer service and integrity. It's nice to see in a sea full of below par restaurants. I am going to chalk up our previous experience to an off day. I now have full confidence in Park Tavern and as long as the staff and food doesn't change I am looking forward to booking my wedding reception here :)\n\nTHANKS GUYS!\nTiffany", "author": "Kipani K."}

The tuna was seared on the outside and raw on the inside. There was a thin slices of eggplant. I believe it was Japanese eggplant because they were very small. The only problem was the the eggplant was burnt black. Not exaggeration, most of the slices were cooked past the point of tasting any eggplant. The squash however was cooked nicely and seemed fresh. The plate was filled with greens and a bell pepper dressing.\n\nTwo of the girls ordered the CRAB, MUSSEL & SOLE BOUILLABAISSE. Neither girl was a big fan of the dish. The felt like the broth was not as good as they would have expected. It was \"just okay\" according to them both.\n\nHowever, the MARLOWE BURGER was a big hit with another friend.

Truffle fries that is.  Oh, but they have a poached egg and caviar that comes with it so it must be worth it!  My review is based on a pretty great client dinner we had there, but I am also going to disclose some pitfalls.  The truffle fries are amazing, even for $20, but the egg/caviar part is completely unnecessary.  For my entree I ordered the lobster bisque which came out luke warm at best so that completely ruined it.  I didn't send it back because I didn't want to upset the tempo of the business meal, but from a food perspective it was almost inedible.  People at the table who ordered the pork chop or steak were blown away by how good they were.  The seafood orderers seemedd just satisfied.  The table also ordered one of the giant slices of birthday cake, which was surprisingly delicious -- and I don't even like cake.  Great ambiance, pretty good service.\nIf I'd paid for my dinner, considering the bisque situation, I'd have been pissed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-29", "description": "I have such mixed opinion about my visit tonight that I wasn't sure that I should a review as it may be incoherent.\n\nI think the experience started out on the wrong foot. We arrived 15 min before our reservation and the hostess had just left her station to seat another party.  Someone else asked us if we had been helped to which we said no and that we had reservations. He asked if we'd like to sit at the bar and wait for a few minutes or if we'd like to be seated right away.  We said we'd like to be seated.  He left and the hostess came back. I don't think there was time for the guy and the hostess to talk so she naturally asked us about our reservation. She then asked us to the bar area until our table was ready. Strange. Well, we did.  We barely ordered and got our drinks (5 min maybe?) when she came up to us to tell us our table was ready. Really? Why did you bother to tell us to go to bar? We asked if our bar tab could be transferred to the table and she said it was preferable that we take care of the bar tab first.  So, I had my husband go get seated white I paid the bar tab.  When I got to our table, I saw that most all the tables around us (about 6?) were all empty.  So, why did they make us go to the bar first only to come get us 5 min later?  Mind you, everyone (including the bartenders) was super friendly and nice.  They just created a slight inconvenience right up front.\n\nOur server at the table started off a bit odd too. Just as she started to explain the special to us, she abruptly excused herself to help serve the food to the next table.  She then came back to finish explaining the special.  Really odd.  After that experience, service was almost flawless (almost because we asked for more bread but had to ask again before we got some).  If it weren't for the experience right up front, we would have rated the service at Park Tavern 5 stars (I'll explain later).\n\nDeviled eggs, PT fries, and steak tartar (special of the night) were had for appetizers.  We really had come prepared to eat!  All were all great as we had expected and hoped.  We finished off the drinks from the bar and had the 2000 Caymus Cabernet that we brought with us decanted during appetizers.  (Corkage is $20, by the way.)\n\nDinner was seafood plate and filet mignon.  Both were completely forgettable and were a bit on the salty side (and I tend to eat a bit salty usually!). Filet wasn't what I expected (to melt in my mouth).  The twice cooked potatoes with the filet were too salty and creamed greens a  bit too mushy.\n\nThe real disappointment was the dessert.  Hubby had birthday cake because it was his birthday.  I ordered raspberry blueberry crisp and I couldn't take more than 2 bites (hubby took 2 bites too).  It was so salty and that flavor mixed with meyer lemon curd just made it inedible. The server offered to take it back and see if they could bring me another one without the sea salt (I asked no lemon curd either).  A different person (maitre d maybe?) came  by to tell me that the breading on top (the crisp par of the crisp) had salt in it already so he didn't think I would like it without any topping either.. He asked if I wanted another so I got the panna cotta.  (He was so nice and gracious!)  It was plain and a bit... yes, salty.  When the guy came by to ask how my dessert was, I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't like it (hubby ate it b/c he hates to leave leftovers).  He was so genuinely nice!\n\nWhen the check was brought, the server let us know that they didn't charge for either desserts.  Again superb service. \n\nHow to rate?", "author": "Amy Y."}

Arrived on time for a Friday 9PM reservation, but the table wasn't ready yet. Instead of giving us a spiel about how it would only be 10-15 minutes, they gave us some free drinks. The drinks arrived fast, but our table was already prepared so they comped us the drinks. Nice!\n\nOut of the deviled eggs from the appetizer list which bummed out the GF since she wanted to try them. Wait, out of deviled eggs? How can you run out of eggs? Anyway, by the time the table next to us ordered, they were out of 2 other appetizers. So yeah, teething pains. The raw halibut was great. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but had way too much lemon. Tell Juan to chill out with the lemon bottle. Appetizers came out quickly and promptly.\n\nIt took a while (20-30 minutes after apps cleared) for the main course. After arrival, the food was cold and my pork was undercooked. The GF's scallops were coldish, too. Dunno if this was a kitchen screwup or waitstaff, but I'm guessing kitchen. (The table next to us had similar delays). My pork was undercooked. I'm ok with the new pink-in-the-middle trend, but my pork was cold and red. Not medium, but more on the medium-rare to rare side. That aint cool. Luckily, the waiter came to check on us, I told him, he took it away and fixed it up. Upon returning he said he should have told me that's how they serve it and that it's \"brined.\" I don't care if it's been irradiated. You can't serve pork that rare in a dark restaurant. Everyone will think it's way undercooked (mine was and it was cold). Plus, pork that rare doesn't have the same texture as beef. PT staff if you're reading this, make sure they cook the pork to medium! Food was good, once it was recooked and the GF's scallops were tasty.\n\nOverall the ambiance is weird. It feels like a NYC boisterous alphabet soup lunch spot....yet they're mainly going after the dinner crowd. I can't quite put my finger on it. There are some great restaurants which are loud and dynamic like Galatoire's in NOLA. I just can't say what's off about this place, but something is.

I ordered the brussel sprout chips, corn soup, and the rosted cornish hen with black truffles. I was worried that I had ordered poultry, but it ended up being really good. I thought it was funny that they gave me option of having it cut for me or if I wanted to carve it. I'm going to carve it myself. Duh. Cornish hen was moist and falvorful and yo could taste the truffle. This was rather large for me though. All I probably ate was one breast. I was not that hungry to begin with. My friend's pork I thought could be better. It would have been better if it was marinated in a citrus or vinergette, rather than just the chili rub that it came it. The fattier parts were better though. The corn soup was good, I would recommend it. I liked the oil that was drizzled on top of it. Also, order the gnocchi. It's the best gnocchi I've had.", "author": "Hazel F."}

I can't wait to come back to the North Bay and try more food.  The place was super busy, but we managed to get bar seating within 5 minutes.  You can be put on the bar list if you don't have a reservation or there's a communal table in the bar area which is first come first serve.  It's modern decor with dark wood, but not a stuffy place at all.  More relaxed, but vibrant vibe.  People were super friendly and bartender makes fabulous cocktails.  \nMet a guy who goes there frequently and had me order the bartender's special cocktail since I love bourbon.  It's not on the menu so you would have to ask for it.   It was real good, not sweet which is right up my alley.  Also tried the McKinley (a whiskey cocktail) and that was good as well, but I like the bartender's special better.  \nFor food, we had small bites.\ndeviled eggs with bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o, and chives.  So good.  Full of flavor and just right.  \nkampachi (raw fish) with kaffir, grapefruit and finger lime.  This is good, but not the greatest crudo dish I've had.  Very light.\nfried oyster \"caesar\".  Who doesn't love fried oysters!  Came with a side a caeser salad and dipping sauce.

The d\u00e9cor is really nice with available bar seating, chef's table seating as well as the regular dining room. Service is top notch, knowledgeable and attentive. And the food is so fantastic. One item we haven't seen elsewhere on any menu are the deviled eggs. YUMMY! How can eggs taste so heavenly and light with such complex flavors? But they're here. We also shared the cheese plate and a burger, and yes it sounds so ordinary, but the flavors are so unique and complex. The chef has a very developed palate. We also had their wedge butter lettuce salad which was dressed with a light, fruity sparkling dressing. I don't know how they made it so light and so different from the typical thick, heavy iceberg wedge salad, but they did. The only issue I had was when we were waiting at the bar for our table, I asked the bartender if they had a Moscato d'Asti, and he said they didn't. But his bartending partner corrected him. They did have my favorite Moscato, but it had already been opened and was flat. I could have sent it back, but why? I'll be going back for more good food.", "author": "Richard S."}

We did not have a reservation (it was a weekday night) but were seated at a nice table right away.  We started with the deviled eggs which were to die for!  Then we both had the burger and agreed that it was one of the best we had ever had.\nI went back this weekend with my mother who was visiting from out of town.  We did have a reservation but when I called to add a 3rd person that day I was told they would have to push back the reservation a half hour or seat us at a communal table.  I was not thrilled about this since neither option was appealing. If it was a Friday or Saturday night I would not have minded waiting a half hour but it was Sunday at 8pm.  I ended up calling back and they said to just come in and they would seat us as soon as they could.  Upon arrival we were seated within 10 minutes which I appreciated.  We had a fantastic server (I wish I could remember his name) and all 3 of us loved our dinners.  We started with the brussel sprout chips which I personally think are overrated but they certainly didn't taste bad.  Just greasy and overpriced.  I had the Poulet Noir which was very flavorful. My mother had the sole and my cousin had the scallops.  They were good but she only got 4 and was still hungry.  We shared the October birthday cake (coconut) to complete the night and I thought it was dry and boring.\nOverall, I love the decor and vibe of this place and think the service is fantastic.  But giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 because of some of the food items (just not worth 5 stars) and for what you get for your money.\nI think I may go back and just sit at the bar and get the burger.  If I did that every time I'm pretty sure it would be a solid 5 stars!", "author": "Dana D."}

The brussels sprout chips are very tasty and one of my fave items from sister restaurant Marlowe.  I really enjoyed my scallops with cauliflower, and my friend raved about the burger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-28", "description": "Had hear a lot of good things about Park Tavern.  I usually dig the New American style food.  I feel like it's the best type of menu to read my mind and present me with something that I want before I know what I want.  Also, this new place looked a bit out of the ordinary from the usual restaurants in North Beach.  So yes, I was sold, had to check it out, and finally ventured in with some friends this past weekend.   \n\nNow one item in particular that I had heard about:\n*Deviled eggs, bacon, pickled jalepe\u00f1o & chives  $2 ea\n\nThis is supposedly a must order item.  Upon deciding to go here I immediately started thinking about them.  How good could they be?  Would they literally be the best deviled eggs I had ever had of all time?  Would I potentially eat 100?  They are only $2/each.  Would we all have a deviled egg eating contest with the winner getting 1 million dollars in Monopoly money?  Literally anything could happen...\n\nThat includes the plot twist of sitting down and upon opening my mouth to order them, the server said, \"sorry to interrupt, but wanted to let you know we are out of deviled eggs.\"  He explained that they give these complimentary to tables that have a longer than normal wait.  I asked what they were going to send us complimentary for being out of the one item we were all desperately been wanting to try.  He stared at me blankly...Holy #$%&, the night was ruined...\n\nBut then life went on and the following was ordered among the various folks at the table...\n\n*Kettle One/Soda with two orange slices $10 - It looked like they had a lot of good cocktails, and normally I would have gone for something like the PT Old Fashioned, but I was in a vodka/soda mood, so continued on with that simple order and made it just high maintenance enough by throwing in the two orange slices thing.  Cocktail next time.\n*Demons on horseback  $13 - Deliciously tasty prawns.\n*Housemade beef jerky  $7 - Really? Beef Jerky? Ok, whatever, it was damn good.\n*Lemon chips, dill pollen, burrata, & Shelley's pea tendrils  $13 - Not enough lemon chips to go with the burrata, but I guess that is ok, I managed to finish it off.\n*\"Marlowe\" burger, caramelized onion, cheddar, bacon, horseradish aioli & fries  $14 - I didn't order this, but of course I tried a bite.  This burger alone is worth a trip back.  It was delicious!\n*\"Poulet Rouge\" Bloomsdale spinach & Peewee potatoes  $25 - This was my epic order and this game hen rules.  I honestly enjoyed this more than the uninspired chicken at Zuni Cafe.  Throw in the delicious spinach and pewee potatoes and this was simply a homerun. Not to mention they serve it upright in this giant iron skillet type thing.  We were sitting in the middle of the dining room, so I'm assuming that anyone on the fence of what to order saw what I had and followed my lead.   This obviously most likely lead to soaring profits that night, which I'll take credit for.  \n\nSo I wish I had room for dessert, but that game hen won.  I was stuffed.  Good times, and I plan to be back.  Hopefully they will deliver complimentary deviled eggs based on this incredibly sad story about being out the first time I visited.", "author": "John R."}

The menu and ingredients are promising, and it's in a gorgeous space -- and it serves beautiful food to beautiful people.  Service can be disjointed, though always friendly. But the food is uneven.  Some dishes in the same section of the menu are very small, some are pretty big, most are rather oily, and quality varies between visits.  And it's all a tad pricy for being often less than stellar.\n\nI've had one perfect Marlowe Burger here. Other times, the bun has been stale (even after sending it back -- though, I got it, I was there on Stale Bun Day), the patty mis-prepared, or it was too salty.\n\nLoved the spiciness and juiciness of the Poulet Rouge, but I only had it once and its vegetables were so salty and oily that I can't quite bring myself to order it again.\n\nThe deviled eggs, with pickled jalapeno and bacon, have always been perfect, and the build-your-own Fried Caesar Salad is fun and tasty.\n\nThe Grilled Sea Scallops dish has a cool combination of flavors, but the scallops were overcooked.\n\nThe brunch dish with kiwi and strawberry w/ whipped coconut milk is refreshing, and the avocado toast is, as well, as long as too much oil isn't poured onto it. Many of their main brunch dishes seem to involve lots of eggs on top.\n\nDrinks are consistent and the wine always at the perfect temp, though the brunch Boozie Smoothie really should be served in something larger than a coupe martini glass.\n\nI love the idea of the Birthday Cake dessert, and it's always superbly airy, but sometimes bland.\n\nI'll probably still come here -- it's really the only modern SF restaurant of its kind in North Beach -- but I still hope that it lives up to what it wants to be.  If I didn't live close by, I would never go out of my way to go here.", "author": "Nina W."}

Their food is creative, flavorful, and difficult to make at home--my kind of restaurant! I've been here 20+ times (I live 2 blocks away), and I have never been disappointed with a single dish or cocktail. Things you must try at dinner: deviled eggs (GET THEM!), poulet noir (and I don't usually order chicken at restaurants), PT fries, brussel sprout chips,  bar steak, and cheddar apple crisp. Things you must try at brunch: avocado toast, cod cakes, and polenta cakes with mushrooms. The only downsides to PT are the prices and crowds. It's easy to rack up a hefty bill when you're ordering multiple dishes to share and $13 cocktails. Plan to make a reservation well in advance, or go early to grab space at the communal bar and table. IMO, the best way to experience PT is to make a reservation for brunch, sit outside on a nice sunny day, and watch all the tourists wait in line at Mama's while you dine on far superior food. :)", "author": "Alison S."}

I went on a Sunday night with 3 other friends for an early 5:30 dinner reservation and were able to to enjoy the esthetics of the very chic, upscale bistro.  My party of 4 all started with Martini's and I was served my drink in a very chipped Martini Glass. When I showed it to my waiter, he took my drink away and I had to remind him 10 minutes later that I was waiting for the return of my cocktail. The Brussel Sprout Chips were ok...but I certainly don't understand all the chatter they're getting on these YELP pages!  The Poulet Noir which I saw on a YELP photo as a HUGE Rotisserie Chicken bursting with herbed stuffing was neither HUGE or BURSTING with stuffing...In fact, it was a sad little cornish game hen with no stuffing, served on a bed of burnt sauteed spinach.  A very sad looking dish...Brad had the Mussels which were served in a tomato garlic broth and was very tasty.  My other friend and I each ordered a C.A.B. NY Steak--which was 3 or 4 pieces of Steak served with fingerling potatoes and it was just ok...when I order a steak at a bistro, please serve it hot, sizzling and WHOLE...what's this piece meal crap?  Didn't want to chance a mediocre dessert as it certainly wouldn't be worth the calories if it was anything like the dishes we received up til then.   Prices seem very high for the quality of food--I'd rather spend the same amount of dough at House of Prime Rib when I'm in a carnivorous mood.

We tried a walk-in the first night, but found out the reservations fill up a couple of nights in advance\n\nThis is the first place I would label as \"Hipster Trendy\" on Yelp. Super packed, loud ambiance,  The tables are very close together, and things are even closer at the communal bar table.  We heard some very interesting conversations our neighbors were having that night.\n\nWe started with the PT fries, which were served with a spicy remoulade sauce, and a soft boiled egg with a little caviar. The fries were double dropped, so they were very crispy.  They were a little expensive at $20, so I probably would try something different next time.\n\nI had the Poulet Rouge. It was a very juicy small chicken, server upright on a cast iron dish, with spinach and baby potatoes server in the bottom.  My wife had the scallops, which were cooked perfectly.\n\nFor dessert I had the \"Birthday Cake\" which was a chocolate pecan cake.  It was actually very good.  My wife had the TCHO creme brulee, which was also very good.  It was my wife's birthday, but all they did was put a candle in her dessert (actually mine by mistake).\n\nThe food was very good.  The service, not by fault of the servers, was a little thin.  Our empty wine glasses sat on the table after we finished the wine at dinner, and  I had to ask for water refills.  If the food hadn't been good, and the waiter's attitude good, I may have given a rating of a three because of this.  At least for me, service is very important, especially at a nicer restaurant such as this.\n\nWe'll go back next time we are in San Francisco.", "author": "Stephen S."}

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided some good insight for a firs timer. We started with of course the deviled eggs....I thought they were good- not sure if they are top 100 good- but oh well something different. We also had the venison carpaccio since it was so different. I thought this dish was very tasty and we enjoyed it quite a bit.  Also had the brussel sprout chips which were difficult to stop eating. I had the Poulet Noir which was amazing! they let you know up-front this will take 30 minutes to cook but totally worth it. Love the stuffing and the sauce, everything about it is delicious. It is very filling though so I recommend splitting it or taking it home. We also had the cheesecake which was deconstructed and not sweet at all, so more like a cheese plate desert.

This time when we made our reservation we asked for a table by the window since we heard it was less noisy.  The very nice hostess said our table was still occupied and offered us two choices.  We took a booth for two in the center of the restaurant.  Big Mistake! \n We were seated by two couples that either had way too much wine or were very giddy being in a restaurant.  They shrieked and laughed so loud and with that added to the already loud noise level in the restaurant it almost made sitting there unbearable.  We ordered our drinks and then the waiter took our order.  Within five minutes our entrees arrived.  McDonalds could not have been that fast.  My scallops were arranged like a small snake on the plate ranging in size from the size of a nickel to a fifty cent piece.  Fortunately I was not all that hungry.  My friend had the steak and fries.  I love salt but the french fires were so salty even I could not eat them.  Three different bus boys asked to clear our plates.  My friend literally had his fork in mid air and was chewing  and had food on his plate.  I know they want to turn the tables but that was ridiculous. There wasn't  anybody waiting for a table and there were even some open tables.\nWhy we ordered dessert is a mystery but we did.  That took fifteen minutes to come.  They only had to slice the cake not make it from scratch. The carrot cake was not as good as the one Neiman Marcus used to have.  That one had shavings of carrots, walnuts and raisins in the moist cake and the frosting had wonderful cream cheese.  This was not even close.  \nThe manager knew we were unhappy and took it upon himself to take care of the food charge and we paid for the drinks.  Between the very loud noise level, the feeling that we were being rushed with the entree and then delayed by the long wait for the dessert I can assure you we will not return.   There are far too many restaurants in San Francisco where you do not  have to put up with a loud noise level, inconsistent service and so so food.

Hostess told us to wait since there are no tables available even though when we looked around there were a couple of tables free. Went to the bar and grabbed couple of cocktails which sounded interesting. It came almost devoid of alcohol. 15 mins go by and no one has sat in any of the tables, so we went up to her and told her it's past 10pm. She then said \"oh, I was actually looking for you\". Surprising considering she was standing there the whole time clearly not looking for anyone and we were a foot away from her the entire time. Fine whatever.\n\nSat down. We were actually excited since we live in the neighborhood and finally someone has opened a decent looking place with what seems like a good bar scene.  \n\nWe usually are price insensitive when going to restaurant's food and cocktails. But this restaurant takes the cake. The bread given to us albeit tasty was stale.  I ordered the uni for an appetizer which was a big mistake, it was more like lettuce with a taste of uni. A quarter of an uni was divided by six, so it looked more like dots on top of lettuce. Having worked with the restaurant industry in New York, this was really insulting.  My husband ordered the burger and his fries were fried to a crisp that it just tasted like oil. My scallops were good, but again for the price you'd think you're eating at french laundry except you will actually be full at french laundry. We skipped on dessert after that meal. When we looked around us, the table of 3 to our left is sharing one side dish. And to our right, a group of 6 girls, didn't order alcohol and had 2 burgers between them. That means the place is too pricey for the hood. \n\n\nThe only thing they really have going for them is the ambiance and the fact that they look over the park.

The restaurant is beautiful, the cocktails were good, and some of the food we ordered was good.  But much of it was overpriced and poorly executed.  \n\nOur server was okay but bad about taking drink orders.  When we ordered our first round they took a long time to arrive, and this was true for every round we ordered.  The bar area is busy and the drinks are creative so I understand that it takes time to put them together, but it's important to get drinks on the table and keep them there when a party is seated for dinner.  Our server was not prompt about taking our drink orders when our drinks were empty or near-empty, and at one point took the drink orders of the rest of the table but not mine.  The drinks were so slow in arriving that there was a time between courses when the entire table of six had finished their cocktails, the empty glasses had been cleared, and we were without drinks (or food) for a good fifteen minutes.  It's very unusual to sit at an upscale restaurant mid-meal with nothing but water glasses on the table for so long.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers, some of which were okay, but when we asked the waiter for a recommendation for a vegetable appetizer he recommended the raw vegetable plate.  I expected something more creative than the unseasoned carrots, cucumber, radishes, and dip that arrived.  My first thought when it arrived was that it must be unbelievably cheap for the restaurant to prepare but very profitable.  I couldn't help but wonder if the waiter was instructed to recommend the dish because of the margin.  I'm still shocked it's actually on the menu (not to mention that it was recommended), because it was essentially the equivalent of veggies and spinach dip.  \n\nOne other thing about the appetizers--they came out very quickly.  Too quickly.  As though they were all sitting somewhere pre-prepared and had just been loaded onto plates when the order came in, rather than made to order.\n\nI should have learned my lesson about taking recommendations from our waiter, but I couldn't decide between entrees.  I asked the server whether I should order the tuna or the sturgeon and he recommended the sturgeon, so I went with it.  It was a huge mistake.  It arrived cold and bland, with an unpleasant chalky taste.  The accompaniment didn't add much, as it came with sad looking vegetables in the exact same sauce that had been on one of our appetizers. \n\nSomeone at my table ordered the scallops and offered me one when she noticed I wasn't eating my fish (although she noticed this, the waiter did not).  The scallop had sand in it.  Someone else ordered the burger, which was good but not spectacular.  The truffle fries were very good, the Brussels sprouts were good but not particularly unique, and a prawn appetizer we ordered was very good but mostly because it was cooked in bacon fat.  The deviled eggs were okay, but I've had better at Wayfare Tavern.\n\nAll in all I had the impression that the restaurant's mission is not to make excellent food and provide a high quality dining experience, but to do its best imitation of doing so to earn as much money as possible to pay for that enormous, beautiful space on Washington Square Park.  When I first walked in I was struck by it and commented on how they could have possibly afforded it.  I guess it's by recommending the veggies and dip.", "author": "Meredith H."}

The women running the show behind Park Tavern got it right in so many ways, combining comfort food with gourmet in the most unexpected ways. I had no idea egg could be used as a side dip to truffle french fries, or done up to taste like a bomb of delicious crunch and silky smooth in a deviled concoction from the gods. Wagyu beef jerky is just the perfect muchy snack to have with your green tea infused bourbon cocktail in an old fashioned brandy snifter.  I have loved cornish game hens since my grandmother made them for me as a kid and given her passing this past February it was heart warming to see the bird perched on cast iron pan served full with roasted potatoes and spinach. When I say I love everything about this place, I'm also including the high energy bar crowd who reminded me exactly why I miss living in San Francisco so much!

We arrived about 45 minutes early and asked if we could be seated. The hostess bumped us up but while looking for a spot at the bar I spotted 2 seats near the kitchen line that I thought were the bar. Turns out they were dining seats, and one of the staff kindly offered them up if we were interested. Excellent service. I got the bar steak and she got a burger. Both were quite delicious. The truffle fries that came with the burger were excellent. The bar steak was a fillet, but came out pre cut into slices which I was not a huge fan of. The meat was a bit tough for what I would expect of a fillet, but still delicious. I saw many people order the cast iron skillet chicken, and wish I would have tried it since its their specialty. Definitely would go back and recommend it to anyone. The service was top notch, the atmosphere was great and the food was quite delicious.", "author": "Justin B."}

They took us even though we didn't have a reservation and it was only a 5 minute wait before we were seated. The service was great and the food was excellent! We shared the deviled eggs (delicious), my boyfriend had the ahi tuna, and I got the burger (one of the best burgers I've ever had). We also shared the apple and cranberry crisp - so yummy!

So we got our drinks and were sipping them and he comes over and asks us what time our reservation was for 8p he says, and I say no it was for 7:45p (it was a bit after 8p) and proceeds to give us a check and asked us to get up as there were several people hovering around for our seats...OMG, are you joking??? especially since the drinks were close to $40. I was very turned off by that and did something I never do at a restaurant, I went to the manager and asked if it was OK if we sat there till out table was ready (especially since we were on time and it was going on 30 min at this point)...she said absolutely and asked who said it wasn't...I had to tattle on this guy as it was some of the worst customer service I have encountered in a restaurant in a LONG time.

My first visit was about a month ago and both dinners were excellent!\n\nFor our first dinner, we shared the brussel sprout chips, the pork belly bites, the deviled eggs, the steak crudo, and the burger.  Even split, that was WAY too much food for 2 people!  Everything was very good.  Although, if you're going to order the pork belly bites, be sure you're a party of more than 2.  They are so rich and you can only have one or two.  The brussel sprout chips were thin and crispy, with just the right amount of salt.  The deviled eggs were to die for...the pickled jalapeno and crispy bacon marry very well with the egg.  The steak crudo was nice, but nothing to rave about.  And the burger was fantastic!  They ask if you want it medium rare, and they mean it.  It's very pink inside, so if you don't like it that way, be sure to have them cook it longer.  I am a fan of medium rare and it was just perfect for me.  You can't beat a burger with crispy bacon and melty cheese.  The fries were perfectly crispy and salted as well.\n\nLast night we enjoyed the beef jerky, the deviled eggs (seriously so good!), the halibut crudo, the porcini salad, the clam chowder, and the burger again.  If you are a fan of beef jerky, you must order this.  It's got fantastic flavor and texture.  The halibut crudo was just lovely...small bites of raw halibut, jalapeno, avocado, sweet corn and chive.  Yum!  And the porcini salad was fabulous...the mushrooms were to die for.  We ordered the clam chowder based on the rave reviews it's gotten and it was delicious!  Be forewarned, it is very rich and I think it would be difficult for one person to finish by him/herself.  And just as it was last time, the burger was fantastic.\n\nMy one gripe is that I felt rushed...both times.  The bus boys came around 3-4 times asking if we were done, when I clearly wasn't.

We also had the mushroom soup which was delicious.  We ordered the game hen, and the presentation was fantastic, but the bird was heavily over salted which translated into extremely salty spinach at the base of the bird.  The thing is I am a salt lover, so if it was too salty for me, it must have been totally unbearable for the average diner.  We also had the pork chop and the Marlowe burger.  The chop was a healthy size, but it was cooked unevenly.  Some parts of the chop were cooked through and others boarder too rare (and not along the bone which was the strange part).

This last weekend, I went here with a friend. The valet parking is perfect since as most of you know this neighborhood is almost impossible to park in after 7 PM. The space is really nice and we scored a corner table where we were able to see the entire dining room and also the open kitchen. Our server seemed very green - he had a difficult time telling us what the specials were for the evening. He wasn't able to remember what they were exactly. Seemed a bit odd, but not a big deal. He took our drink order and then came back a few minutes later saying they would be right up and took our order. We of course ordered the much talked about deviled eggs which deserve all of the praise that they get! But strangely these came to our table first, then a few minutes later, our drinks arrived. After we polished off the eggs, then the bread arrived. Just a very strange order of things. For starters, I ordered a salad with white asparagus, hearts of palm and avocado - it was delicious and had a nice refreshing taste. Exactly what I was looking for. My friend had the warm chicories which was also very tasty. Then our mains arrived - this is sadly where our meal took a turn. I ordered the petite poulet rouge. The presentation was impressive but I noticed that the bird looked a bit burned and the vegetables also were overcooked as well. The dish was a bit bland and needless to say, I was disappointed. My friend ordered the \"Marlowe\" burger and it was also unimpressive. Not bad or anything but nothing really special either. We ordered the lemon cheesecake parfait to share for dessert. There was barely any lemon flavor to the dessert. I have to say that I probably won't  be rushing back here anytime soon. But if I do go, I might just stick to their starters!", "author": "M S."}

We ordered two desserst,the fig/toffee/cheese plate and the \"almond joy.\" Nowhere had I ever seen such tiny desserts, really just miniscule to the point that we just had to laugh. For the price, the food was mediocre (although well conceived) and the dessert presentation just has to be a joke. With so many restaurant choices in SF, this one will not be on our list again.", "author": "Willow R."}

With a gorgeous classic with a twist brasserie design, overlooking Washington Square, it's an easy walk from my office downtown.  I arrived a bit early for my reservation, but the host kindly seated me in a prime spot, where I had a lovely, if slightly sweet drink, while waiting for my husband.  Just as he arrived, our waitress brought the drink that I had requested for him--perfect timing!  Do have the deviled eggs--two halves for each of us made a great appetizer, full of creamy-crunchy-spicy (with the jalapeno) flavors and textures.  We also had the lemon chips (yum!) with green hummus (pretty darn good), steak tartare (really good and generous portion) and NY strip steak with fries.  The sommelier was very engaging and helpful, and we ended up ordering a wine that I had thought about earlier in the evening, by coincidence.  All in all, a wonderful experience.", "author": "Meredith B."}

Our waiter flat out stunk...ignored our table for the first 20 plus minutes and then for the rest of the evening seemed to be rushing us out of there. I was so excited for the deviled eggs but what a disappointment, I've had better store- bought deviled eggs. The lemon chips and burrata were decent, but not the most tasty burrata I've had. My pork chop was pretty yummy, but again not something I'd rave or crave to go back for.  My friends who had the Poulet chicken were disappointed as well.  One of them claimed the rotisserie chicken you can buy from Costco is moister and tastier (ouch).  The warm bread was delicious (redeeming quality??) but overall a very disappointing experience.  Perhaps it was just an off night, but definitely won't be clamoring to return anytime soon.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the fact a man had his little dog crawling all over the booth the next table over....really?", "author": "Kristen S."}
