Got some shrimp har gow, pork siu mai, and joong to go.\n\nI wanted to give it 3 and a half stars but Yelp doesn't have half stars.  So I upped it to 4 stars.  One thing I'll say it the dumplings, siu mai, and joong are huge.  Yep, not the typical tiny dim sum you find at other restaurants.\nAlso, it's refreshing to find joong outside of the Chinese dragon festival dates in the spring.  They're bamboo wrapped glutinous rice with fillings of pork, 1,000 year old egg (they're not really 1,000 years old..lol), dried shrimp, and other things.   \n\nThe shrimp har gow had dough that was way too thick in my opinion. Sui mai was fine.  Joong was ok. Prices were \"ok\" but with all the competition in SF, there are less expensive options like Good Luck Dim Sum on Clement Street.", "author": "Dana H."}

They bark at you to order, plus they will bark at you to ask how many items. Don't you dare say 1 order of whatever even though the menu has a whole section indicating dim sum items that come 3 to 1 order. Plus don't you dare ask questions on what things are...they will bypass you and you will be the fonder for the staff and all the Cantonese seniors citizens enjoying their dim sum and the cinema of life. The food most likely contains MSG. I do not suggest this place for dim sum newbies. If this was your first experience, it would definitely put you off of dim sum forever.\n\nHowever I could overlook the rudeness if the food was great. But alas the majority of dim sum was blah and some items were plain disgusting. \n\nThe bad...the egg custard and fried pork dumpling were yucky. The egg custard filling had a strange odor and sour taste. Took a teeny tiny nibble and tossed it. Yuck. The fried pork was hard and burnt with tasteless filling. I took one bite and tossed it. Yuck. Considering these were the first two items I attempted to eat...it didn't look promising. \n\nThe good...not much to report out. Here it goes...Sui mai was hefty sized and decent tasting.

Found most Chinese restaurants and/or bakery's are closed on Monday and/or Tuesday's.\n\nAfter a car backing out almost hit us. (Driver apparently backing out didn't see the stopped car on street (waiting for traffic to move forward), made one more round and found a space and fed the meter.

Bun was dry and smaller than our regular go to SF Bakery.  The filling was minimal, dry, less fat pieces (yes I like bits of fat in it), sweet sauce surrounding the pork mini bits was average, but good.  It was more bread than filling. It took a few bites to get to meat.   After a day, the top bun crust became rock hard too.

There are several workers behind the counter taking orders.  The line was about 4 or 5 deep when I got there, but it moved within a reasonable pace.  There are a few tables (large and small) inside the shop if you decide to eat there rather than taking it to go.  I was a little surprised to find a bathroom (half the time, these hole in the wall Chinese places have no public restroom) present.  \n\nAs I inched closer to the front of the line, I started noticing that the worker was taking the dim sum from the counter and heating it up in the microwave.  Egggghhhhhhhhhh.  I don't think I've ever been at a food joint (excluding fast food) where the food was microwaved in front of me.  This was strange - I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  It looked like the party in front of me was ordering various items, and with each item they picked, the worker tossed the dim sum onto the microwave plate and nuked it.  It would then be piled onto a pizza tray with the rest of the dim sum and served that way (presentation wasn't that great).  I guess this is how a large order of food is served if you're not taking it to go.  This scene just felt very unappetizing :(  \n\nAnyway, I ordered my sticky rice balls - came out to about 80 cents each.  I was a little confused that they tossed it into a small plastic bag rather than a box of some sort.  I really think this place is trying to cut down on costs (i.e. serving food piled on a reusable pizza tray).  I think it's fine/great to be eco-friendly, but sometimes these things make me wonder what's happening in the back kitchen.  The rice ball tasted OK.  While it's the first time I've had (or even seen) sticky rice in a ball format, I felt like other sticky rice I've had was much better - those were more flavorful and usually comes out much hotter.  This version just wasn't memorable.  \n\nOverall, I may be back to try other things.  Unfortunately, the microwaving just left a funny taste in my mind.  We'll see.", "author": "Laura C."}

I think we need to get some coffee before we go or do anything else. \n\nMe: Dude......you're not feeling the effects of a food coma, you overdosed on MSG!\n\nThis isn't the first time he's eaten dim sum at Wing Lee. In fact, he's been here a few times for their super cheap food. Most of the dim sum items cost around $1.60 for 3 pieces.

I thought he meant \"shark fin dumplings\", a shu mai with ground pork, shrimp and bits of shark fin. There was no shark fin at all, but A LOT of shark meat.\n\nI still didn't believe him so I asked the lady behind the counter. Yep, it was indeed shark meat mixed with veggies. \n\nIt tasted funky. I don't care what everyone else says, this $hit definitely doesn't taste like chicken at all.\n\n Shark meat is sometimes referred to as the \"poor man's swordfish\" because of it's similar taste and texture to swordfish. But this particular shark meat gau was gross. Everything about it tasted off: the smell, the texture and the sweet funky taste that results from using too much MSG. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=TLGidONVqC_y8SqPkPhHKw\n\nI forced myself to finish one dumpling, and left the 2nd one half eaten.

I've tried a few other highly rated dim sum bakeries in San Francisco and Oakland chinatowns and they have been okay but I do like to try some of the different items they have on offer and usually there will be something that just tastes funky (and not just in a way that's different), I liked everything we ordered here, everything tasted very fresh (didn't get anything deep fried this time though).\n\nSteamed BBQ Pork Bun - Nice, not too much dough (as compared to many others, it is supposed to be somewhat bready), dough was flavorful, light yeasty taste (some have no flavor at all).  Filling had nice meat with a little fat (not grisly), sauce had a light smokiness to it that went well with the yeastiness in the dough.  Most of all there was not a hint of funk in the meat.  I feel that often the strong BBQ flavor (even at some of the highly rated bakeries) is masking some funky meat and I'm really grossed out when I get a hit of that older meat flavor, not a bit of it here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-30", "description": "Wing Lee continues to be my favorite dim sum spot along Clement Street.  Granted, I haven't tried every single dim sum shop along Clement Street, but among the ones I have tried in that area (Good Luck Dim Sum, Gourmet Dim Sum & Clement Restaurant) Wing Lee stands out as the one restaurant that uses the least MSG.  That's good news for someone like me who is sensitive to MSG or high sodium levels.\n\nLike most dim sum places I have my likes and dislikes.  You will never, ever see me eating turnip cakes, leek dumplings, beef siu mais or beef rice rolls at any dim sum shop regardless of how good they are.  I don't like the taste of them, and I definitely don't like the look of them.\n\nAs my friend Sara A and I embarked on a six day great outdoors trip this would be the only restaurant food purchase of our entire trip.  Everything except for the shrimp gows were exceptional, and through the magic of words and pictures here is where my review begins.  One other thing, what I refer to the pastries as may not be what the restaurant refers to them as.\n\nChicken Siu Mai (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=3iTDI7x3FT6o4yuJ7WCuSw) - It's everything you love about your pork siu mais, but ground chicken thigh meat is used instead of the pork.  The filling seems pretty simple with ground chicken, finely chopped mushrooms and carrots that are wrapped in a thin flour wrapper and steamed.  These were very well seasoned and I could not detect any MSG.\n\nShrimp Gow \"aka\" Har Gow (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=wOHusAFk0IJyootF2tx1EA) - You get at least two baby shrimp in each along with some finely chopped bamboo shoot, and some gritty tapioca starch encased in a rather thick steamed rice flour skin that is super rubbery.  Sara and I actually played catch with one, and it was so rubbery it didn't break open.  These were okay, but I definitely detected some MSG inside the filling.\n\nFun Gor or Steamed Pork Dumpling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=VkDFwAVV3MgUDwC7k-rh4w) - The filling is very well compacted and had good flavor.  The rice flour skin was also on the thick side, but aside from the ones my mom used to make I've come to expect thick skins on fun gors.  The filling consisted of minced pork, shrimp bits, mushrooms, carrots, bamboo shoots, green onion and cilantro.  All were chopped finely.  No MSG taste.\n\nSweet Rice Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=96VVquk3h_uoAi1i-qV1qg) - These are a personal favorite of mine.  Pretty simple too.  It's a ball of sweet glutinous rice (sticky rice) flavored with minced green onion and bits of BBQ pork and wrapped inside a super thin rice flour membrane.  These pastries appear small but just a few will fill you up because the rice is packed so firmly.  Here is how it looks on the inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=80EgwX6Zdg9u79wABfmtHw).\n\nBean Curd Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=xho1Q8i5AVXQsn1fJmkLxw) - We had to try these because we had never seen them offered here before.  These are a good vegetarian option to the meat filled rice rolls and very tasty.  The filling consisted of thin glass noodles, chopped shiitake mushrooms, strips of carrot and strips of wood ear wrapped in hydrated dried bean curd and steamed.  They're served with soy sauce and chopped green onion.  We both agreed that these were delicious for a dish containing no meat.  Here's the shot of the filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=aCOYiEaIWv7T3HWTqRR8Pg).\n\nChicken Combination Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHBLiy_53nQZrsrR-NH_Hg?select=8FD0AwItk92djvd1YaikXA) - My dad and I love Wing Lee's chicken combination buns.  As you can see from the photo there is tender, juicy chicken thigh meat with green onions, a part of a hard boiled egg, a whole shiitake mushroom and a piece of Chinese sausage inside the steamed sweet bun.  Best of all ... no MSG taste.\n\nThe ladies here are cool and all are very much trilingual (Cantonese, Mandarin, English).

Come here before 1700 hours before most of their stuff sells out. It helps to speak Cantonese here although you will still be adequately served if you dont. Im a normal face here and already made friends with the ladies behind the counter. They are a nice group to deal with.\n\nI Always come here to buy bulk loads of to go dim sum and egg custart tarts (daan taat) for dinner and for breakfast at home if im ever in the Richmond district. I always buy 2 FULL plastic boxes and it costs me $13 to $15 which feeds 3 people at home breakfast, lunch and dinner for 4 days. \n\nEgg custard tart (daan taat): pie like crust (not the 'so pey' flaky type) with sweetened egg in the centre. $.65 per piece and tastes awesome.\n\nSesame ball: $1.40 each. Crispy outside with chewy inner layer filled with dark lotus seed pastes. Again awesome. Even retains its crispiness days after being bought and microwaved at home.\n\nCha Sew So: dont know what its called in english but it is a squar flat pastry wrapped around little amounts of Cha Sew (BBQ pork). LOVE the crispy and soft delicate pastry. BBQ pork inside gives it a nice touch. Like a Cha Sew Bau pork bun but with a pastry instead of a bun. A little more BBQ pork inside would be nice but I Highly recommend it.\n\nPork or beef Sew Mai: even though its not in par with Koi Palace or Asian Pearl standards, we all still love it. The beef sew mai tastes more like the beef balls (ngau yook) served in dim sum restaurants. Both damn good. $1.40 for 3 pieces.\n\nHa Gau (shrimp gau): love it and the shrimp inside was flavourfull considering this place is a cheap to go dim sum shop.\n\nSpring roll: lots of vegetables inside. The type i personally enjoy. Even when i leave it in my fridge for days and the outer layer is totally soggy, i still love it. It is crispy when you eat it fresh though.\n\nIf you are nit picky about dim sum, then go to Asian Pearl or Koi Palace. What you get here is what you pay. Dirt cheap dim sum and fairly good food and fast efficient service. Me coming from Hong Kong and being accustomed to real deal dim sum and Chinese food, I still have no complaints about eating from here.", "author": "Chung L M."}

Should I go for the pork shumai? Potstickers? Veggies rolled up in the flat noodles? Especially with the huge line of people that has inevitably queued up behind me, I've never had the courage to ask if it's possible to mix and match.\n\nThere's certainly not a lack of takeout dim sum places along this street, and I don't necessarily have a concrete reason as to why Wing Lee is my favorite of the bunch, but I can assure you that it's good.

It would have been nice if there was  more meat (chicken or pork) along with the rice porridge, but it filled me up and was a great thing to eat on a cold day like today.

I believe I've had steamed chicken buns from every dim sum takeout place that offers them on Clement, Irving, Noreiga and Taraval (though I haven't written a review for all of those places).  Wing Lee offers a good version of the steamed combination chicken bun but Clement Restaurant's steamed chicken buns reign supreme in the Richmond and the Sunset.\n\nCombination chicken bun analysis ($1.30):\n* Appearance/construction:  Round and big, not that heavy though.  The filling is not tightly packed inside but appeared to be almost in four separate areas.  The bun was too loose.  \n* Bun dough: good flavor, smooth, slightly sweet, not too dense but a little denser than Clement Restaurant's, not soggy at all\n* Filling:  The chicken chunks are bigger here which is a nice touch.  Comes with one whole shitake mushroom, a piece of Chinese sausage, a wedge of hard-boiled egg.  Nicely seasoned, not too salty, tender chicken.  Needs more filling.\n* Temperature: Served warm (big plus)\n\nThe combination chicken buns are the most expensive steamed buns they have.  They had other steamed buns like chicken, pork & vegetable, egg custard, etc., and baked buns too.  The dim sum dumplings looked larger than average (3 for $1.50) and they had chewy red bean pancakes.  I didn't step foot into the deli side which has a separate entrance.

I also love the BBQ chicken skewers - charred to perfection with lots of juicy, flavorful fatty bits laced through each bite. \n\nThe items offered to the left, near the window, are less fresh and not always piping hot. They do offer a few vegetarian options: a vegetarian bun, a tofu skin roll, and the almost-vegetarian fried marinated tofu with mystery fish paste filling (which you can just detach with a fork), but none of these are usually served hot.\n\nI promise they don't serve anything super creepy like mashed brains or chicken feet disguised in buns, so pretty please - don't be the guy who holds up the line pointing at everything asking \"what's that? what's that? what's that?\" If it looks tasty, just try it!

The reason I'm giving the place a 2-star is also because it's cheap...dirt cheap, because the food isn't even worth that.\n\nBut if you know anything about dim sum -- don't believe the reviews. All the dim sum are oversized and cheap, but, well, they hardly compare to the offerings of any good dim sum restaurants in the area. Worst is, when I ordered the radish cakes (which actually tastes pretty good) and rice noodles (with beef in it), they have to microwave the food, right in front of my eyes.\n\nSpeaking of which, rice noodles (cheung fun) are supposed to be very, very thin, with meat rolled up into it.

There's not as many as at a sit-down restaurant, but for some reason, all the ones that I usually order anyway are here, shrimp and chive gow, shark fin gow, shrimp har gow, or tun cake.  3 of a kind for $1.50, but if you're nice, they might let you mix and match!\n\nJook (congee), especially the chicken one, is hearty and yummy and a bowl is $2.\n\nLobby is cozy and (relatively) clean.\n\nI generally don't give a shit about service, because you can't eat service.  However, service here doesn't really leave anything to complain about.  They're incredibly efficient and neither friendly nor unfriendly (which puts them probably among the friendliest 20% of Chinese restaurants.)\n\nThe only thing I wasn't impressed with was the steamed BBQ pork bun.  It was edible, of course, but too much corn starch for my liking.  If you want a good laugh...order the steamed sausage bun.\n\nNothing beats sitting here with a comforting bowl of jook and a steamed bun and assorted dimsum before you while staring out into the rain.", "author": "David A."}

BBQ pork, steamed pork and veggie, chicken, or custard, etc.  Good quality and just yummy.\n\nGood dim sum and jook.  Like everyone else is saying...$1.50 for an order of dim sum--the har gow, siu mai, potstickers, etc.  They also have the shrimp rice noodles, turnip cake, etc.  My favorite jook here is the ginger chicken.  The egg-and-pork isn't bad either, but I prefer the ginger chicken--a bit spicy, shiitake mushrooms, and just delicious and warm.\n\nNote: Depends on when you go here.  Sometimes the food will sit there and become stale.  Other times, it's really fresh and ready to eat off the pans.  Also, they only take cash.  But a $20 will go a long way here for 4 people.  ;-)  They have a few tables for sit-down, but I'd suggest doing take-home...it'll be cleaner and more comfortable.

Unfortunately it seems hard to find a low-priced dine-in dim sum restaurant around SF, but this one had tables in the back that allowed you to order up front and eat at the restaurant. Hungry and reluctant to search further, we decided to eat here. I still miss the family style dim sum with the turning tables though.\n\nThe food was alright. I definitely have had better. The pork bun wasn't as tasty and sweet as I would've hoped. The rice noodle roll was thick, and the sauce wasn't that tasty. The egg custard wasn't as sweet and creamy as I hoped, and the crust wasn't flaky as other egg custards I've had. The other food was generally your normal dim sum.\n\nSo overall, the place wasn't that bad, but definitely not on par with the good dim sum restaurants I've tried. It was definitely cheap, but not worthy of 4 stars. Everything seemed a bit bland, but not bad I suppose.", "author": "Stephen P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-26", "description": "Becca's Christmascapade 2010 - A Triptych.\nPart the First\n\nI wanted to make it a diptych because it's a funnier word but alas, I patronized three businesses on Christmas day.  Wing Lee was the first.  I have previously found it hard to choose to go to a dim sum restaurant other than Good Luck, and so I planned in advance on going to Wing Lee.  My resolve was strong - I had passed by the goodies in their window many times, and the time was nigh for some of those goodies to land squarely in my stomach.\n\nWhen we got there at 11am, it was really crowded!  Prime brunch time on a weekend, so that certainly made sense.  But the line moved quickly, and there was plenty of space at their long, communal tables to fit my boyfriend and me.  The line gave me plenty of time to covetously ogle their bountiful spread (Look, Ma!  No thesaurus!), and I was really impressed.  Their selection seemed to include a few more options than I was used to - combination buns, sweet steamed buns, baked buns, siu mai, potstickers, rice rolls, sticky rice, rice cakes, cakey cakes, and all with a variety of fillings.  We settled on the coriander gow, beef siu mai, taro dumplings, chicken sticky rice, and a chicken combination bun.\n\nThe shining stars, for me, were the beef siu mai.  The meat simply melted in my mouth, and the first bite revealed the glorious innards, in which the beef shone a lovely shade of pink.  The coriander gow were a close second, featuring more shrimp than I thought could fit in something so small, the tangy kick of the Chinese celery, and a rice wrapper thicker than you would think it had a right to be.  The taro dumpings were also impressive, containing more taro than I would have thought could possibly be squished into a dumpling of that size.\n\nThe combination bun and sticky rice were also really good, but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  The combination bun is a really interesting concept, combining multiple parts of a chicken with egg, sausage, and mushroom, but for everything that was in there, it was a little bland.  The bun itself, however, was really substantial but still fluffy.  My other gripe is that Wing Lee dim sum seems to all fall apart rather easily.  I realize this probably happens because the ingredients are fresher, or better for me, but it's a little less fun to eat a dumpling when you're desperately trying to make sure that you don't have to settle for eating all its components separately.\n\nThe atmosphere was delightful, and contained just the right amount of shouting in Chinese from the front counter back into the kitchen.  The tables were all clean, and were wiped down as I was watching, and there was only one bottle of hot sauce in the whole place, but I always find it really fun to share.  I'm very glad I went, and look forward to going again and sampling even more of that impressively ginormous menu.", "author": "Becca S."}

The shrimp in the shrimp dumplings were huge and not bite sized at all. They lacked flavor and the shrimp fell out as soon as I took my first bite. The pork siu mai were dry and the bottom was inedible. The pork sticky rice was bland and it didn't have the flavor that usually accompanies such a good thing. The chicken on a stick tasted alright but it too was a little dry. I also bought the chive dumpling and that was so-so.  I will say that their food is fresh, which is why I included the second star. \n\nMichael was surprised at how horrible it was.....He usually can eat anything and say that it was good.

My dim sum was cold but that can be fixed if you ask them to reheat it.  \n\nBut the worse thing was the taste and preparation.  I think one of their selling points is to make the dim sum entree big and cheap to attract customers while forgoing the taste.  With my hai gao, they did have a big piece of shrimp, but the flour covering was even bigger - thus this was not tasty.  Their taro cake was even worse.  It was undercooked!\n\nDim sum, which is really a collection of light chinese dishes, on steroids is great!  But make sure it tastes great too.

Two items over white rice, portions so generous it could serve two people for 2 meals, variety in dishes, freshness that is unparalleled.  They keep bringing out freshly cooked dishes and it looks like they only make it once because their rotating menu is hundreds long.  They always have the staples, pork hanging from a steel hook, ducks, broccoli and something, fried rice, noodles, etc.  But the curry chicken is so good even the British BF loves it.  The spareribs in black bean sauce has just the right seasonings and is not swimming in a puddle of grease like some places in the other chinatown.  \n\nWhen I read someone else's review of the jook/rice porridge/rice soup, my heart skipped a beat.  Jook/rice porridge is comfort food to the nth degree for Asian people.  If Elvis had an Asian equivalent of his fried peanut butter and banana sandwich, it would be jook/rice porridge.  If there was an Asian equivalent to Mac and Cheese (simple, filling, hearty, child-friendly), it would be rice porridge/jook.  \n\nThe last time I was here with my parents, I got my prize.  The mushroom and chicken \"rice soup\"/jook/rice porridge.  How do they keep it so hot?  It's like an inferno in the core of the take-away container.  Hope is the only thing keeping the sodding plastic from melting.  The little spoon to go along practically begs you to wait before you attempt to put molten love in your mouth.  But of course I couldn't.  Wait, that is.  And I burnt my tongue.  In 3 different places.  And both sides of my mouth.\n\nIt was so good, I put it down when I was full, twice, before finishing the container.

I blink and somehow, less than 2 minutes have passed and I'm clutching the plastic tub again, spoon somewhere between my mouth and that rice nirvana.  \n\nThe other stuff here is good too.  \n\nBut as far as I'm concerned, the jook/rice porridge has stolen my heart and tummy.

This is as close as you can get to a typical hole-in-the-wall bakery / coffee shop that you often find in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong.  \n\nNot much thought (or dollar, even) is invested on fancy interior (~what interior? think four formica tables with chairs), tableware (~what tableware? choice of clingwrap-lined metal plates or paper plates... the servers' first preference is paper plates.. however if you insist, they'll let you use the metal plates lined with clingwrap to minimize the washing afterwards), or dim sum carts (you line up in front of the counter, tell them what you want, and there they come in the box and plastic bag for you).  Bathroom has a funny unexplained smell and also doubles as storage for the bakery's cleaning supplies).  \n\nAll these savings, though, are reflected on the prices of the dim sum.  $1.50 for steamed pork bun that looks like it's on steroid (read: big and plump) filled with generous amount of sweet red chunky pork meat.  That same $1.50 can also be used toward 3 har gow (shrimp dumplings), or 3 siu mai (pork dumplings), 3 postickers, or a giant-sized lo mai kai (sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf).  $8 for authentic Cantonese dim sum for 2 people, no tip (act as if you're in Hong Kong), and no waiting.

I think that they could use a little more filling.  They also were not as creamy as I like...this could be because it was late in the day of course.  My husband is chinese and we love dim sum so this really is hard to say.  But, I mean it.  We had eaten lunch before spotting this place so, we didn't get anything else this time.
