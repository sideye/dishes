They also offer non-coffee beverages if that's your jam, but my guess that if you are choosing to visit a place with \"coffee\" in the title, you are looking for a cup of Joe. \n\nI've tried their regular coffee and their Americano, and I thought both were well done. The Americano was smooth and not overly acidic, and the coffee was good even without cream and sugar. They offer Cuban pastries as well, and while I haven't tried them, I thought it was great that they offered something different than your usual cafe snacks. The service has been consistently friendly when I've visited, and there's a casual and welcoming vibe to the place that makes it very appealing. It's a small space, so I don't think it'd be great if you are looking for a place to work for long periods of time. However, you should definitely check it out if you're in the area!", "author": "Keith H."}

The daily Philz addiction can definitely add up without you noticing. \n\nToday I returned to Grand Coffee for a regular cup of coffee but couldn't resist ordering a Cappuccino instead having seen another customer's luscious concoction. The espresso (Cappucino is $3.50, espresso is $2.50) was as smooth tasting as I remember and perfectly complemented with expertly foamed Califia Original Almond Milk (+0.50). I am so glad I ordered this because this was slightly sweet from the almond milk, rich and strong - I'm sending a new addiction. Suggested: Home-made pistachio milk in iced coffee for a pseudo affogato (+0.75). \n\nFor order-in, enjoy your beverage at the small bar (4 stools) and a complementary seltzer palate cleanser. \n\nThey also sell premium chocolate bars, my favorite brand of pastries (Knead pomme d'amores, pecan and plain croissants, lemon ricotta pop tarts, and chocolate chip cookies). On Mondays they only have pastries from Sandbox (chocolate croissant $3.50 - MEH).\n\nNote: their prices have increased since last time I came. They have square - CC accepted.

I waited to review until I felt I had a decent sample size.  In short:\n\nRitual Roasters is just a couple blocks away, go there.\n\nGrand Coffee has very nice people working there.  But that's not worth $2.50 for *pre-brewed* drip cofee that tastes watery.  That's not worth the cost of an Americano that tastes weak.\n\nI'm not sure what it is about the beans they use or the grinder or what, but the overall flavor is desperately lacking.  When you charge absurd hipster prices for what tastes equivalent to most corner store cups of coffee,  you are ripping off your customers.\n\nThe lattes, americano, and drip coffee are all uniformly bad.  I've had 4 different people serve me in the store; it's either a universal issue with how they're instructed to prepare the drinks, or some kind of issue with poor quality beans.  \n\nAnd, seriously, I am still shocked that they have the gall to charge $2.50 for a cup of PRE-BREWED, SITTING IN A CARAFFE, WEAK COFFEE.  Ritual Roasters charges for an \"as you order\" individual drip cup of coffee from quality beans.  I can name several other coffee places in the Mission and around the city that do the same.  Dear Grand Coffee, those other stores can charge that much because they give you a quality cup of coffee.  Grand's coffee just tastes weak and watery.  That goes for espresso based drinks AND the what they pass off as drip coffee, which has been sitting in a caraffe heating the oils.\n\nIf Grand decreased all it's prices by a buck, I'd consider going back, because that's closer to what you're paying for.  But even then, I'm not sure I'd want what they make.\n\nAlso...for everyone raving about the pastries...you guys know they just buy them from in the neighborhood, right?  They don't make them.  Pastries bought from another local, neighborhood place doesn't mean they make good coffee.", "author": "Lauren C."}

It's bitter.  Just try drinking it without all the syrups, chocolate and whip cream in it and you'll find out quick.  They've done terrible in several nationwide taste tests, even being rated lower than some decafs.  Grand Coffee saves us from bad coffee.\n\nI'm not a morning person so I dont want a lot of chit chat especially if I didn't have my coffee yet.  It's good strong coffee, and the espresso is fantastic.  \n\nThe music and vibe is great.  You will get the snobs along with the regular people and that's cool with me.  \n\nThe pastries are fresh and very good.  They have unique things like creme brulee cake, and pop tarts made out of ricotta with basic pastries that are fresh and good.  No offense but the pop tarts are brutal but some seem to like it.  \n\nThey have egg creme.  My best friend is from the bronx and he said it sucked and said they didn't prepare it right.  We laid back Californians know how uptight some New Yorkers can be so I decided to try it.  I didn't like it at all.  It's not for everyone. \n\nService was fast and polite.  \n\nI still in my right mind don't know why people go to overpriced starbucks when there are great locally owned coffee shops all over serving up some great coffees at lesser prices.  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL COFFEE SHOPS!  \n\nPros:\n-great coffee \n-coffee is still a rip off but compared to starbucks and other chains it's at a good price. \n-great pastries\n-fast friendly service\n\nCon's:\n-not a fan of the egg cream or the ricotta pop tart\n-it's pretty busy\n\n\n**What has more caffeine?  Espresso or Regular coffee? \n-Depending on the coffee, espresso has 30-50 mg caffeine per fluid oz.\n-Regular coffee has 8.1 to 15 mg caffeine per fluid oz.  \n\nEspresso has much more caffeine per oz, but what is interesting is that most people drink a much larger amount of coffee per serving than espresso. \n\nIf you have a 2 oz. espresso for 100 mg of caffeine, but have a 8 oz coffee, you will be getting 120 mg of caffeine.  Obviously for a 12 oz cup you will be getting 180 mg of caffeine. \n\nCaffeine also allows for aspirin and other pain killers to work faster and that's why some even have caffeine in it.  \n\nCaffeine is also a METHYLXANTHINE and has bronchodilation properties, like asthma drugs.

It was like sitting at your favorite neighborhood bar, except it had pleasant smells and only two other people in the room. It gets a little loud when the espresso machine fires up, so it's not a place to reflect or be emo, which I concur is fun to do in a coffee shop at times. Instead, it's a good place to park yourself for a few minutes and be friendly. \n\nOf course, if you choose to get your coffee to go, how can you not love the charm and convenience of the actual order window that is accessed from the sidewalk? It gives you a similar thrill to the concession stand window at the public pool when you were a kid. \n\nWe tried the lattes, which were complex and strong, thanks for Four Barrel's beans, yet perfectly balanced.

They are busy at times with a line 3 or 4 customers deep, so if in a rush you may have to keep moving or plan on going there with time to spare.", "author": "Wilbur K."}

Apparently it's been around for 13 months, and I'm bummed I only just found it. Cozy and awesome, the hot chocolate was delicious, the egg cream was pretty sweet and the cookie to top it off...!  The guy there was chill, approachable... recipe for the perfect coffee/bring a book spot!", "author": "Kat C."}

Can't stand it. \nSo this is a review of just the non-coffee options.\n\nMostly these awesome little custard & caramel filled pastries they have.  Which are amazing and you should try as soon as you can. The croissants are pretty good too.  \n\nAlso the hot chocolate, which is the spicy Dagoba stuff (Xocolatl).  Perfectly reasonably if you are looking for a spicy hot chocolate but also perfectly easy to make at home for yourself. *shrug*", "author": "saru k."}

The coffee was expertly made and prices were very reasonable. (2-3 bucks for most drinks) Only con is little to no seating (more of a grab and go). Highly recommended.", "author": "Asha R."}

I'm grateful for the option to slink into Grand, in my pajamas, have a quality cup of cafe, and listen to some solid Arab-American hip hop all before 10 am. It makes me feel normal.", "author": "Sunny Joy B."}

My heart still belongs to Philz for my lazy Sunday coffee, but Grand Coffee is the most delicious (yes, better then Ritual) and quickest place to go for coffee in the Mission. No lines and Nabeel is very, very friendly. He asks his customer questions and serves coffee without the attitude. Yay Nabeel!", "author": "Lisa K."}

We tried the limade, latte, brooklyn egg creme for the kids as well as owner recommended affogato for my husband.  All made very well.  The coffee is Four Barrel.  The owner is very friendly and is also knows his drinks.    The cafe is very clean and the design and detail are beautiful.  I look forward to visiting again and encourage everyone to check it out as well.", "author": "fadwa s."}
