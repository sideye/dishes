I was craving sushi (and still need to try a sushiritto) but this place was magically right in front of us as I said, I want some sushi in San Francisco.\n\nLocated on Pier 39 - overlooking bustling shops and seal calls, right by the water - the vibes are AHMAZING. Truly open space with a view of Alcatraz - such a gem in this city! For sure, and I haven't even gotten to the food yet. The server was awesome. An Irish guy with an accent and green eyes and attentive to our sushi needs after day drinking on the pier! \n\nThe sushi!! I love tuna rolls and because they are so basic, the fish really needs to be fresh for it to taste good - and this fish was fresh, tasty and the rice was great. My friend is a vegetarian so we ordered all the other veggie stuff we could. The veggie roll was delicious, the tempura veggies were delicious too. The edamame was a little cold but it was fine because Fireball was $5. \n\nI will be back in San Fran and I will be back here for sushi too.", "author": "Josi H."}

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE!\n\nOrdered hamachi mama and it wasn't cooked all the way. Had to send it back to the kitchen to have it cooked more. \n\nThen ordered crispy rice spicy tuna and it was the worst one I've ever had. The crispy rice wasn't even crispy. The spicy tuna looked old. \n\nOrdered the dragon roll and it was SOAKED in unagi sauce that you couldn't even taste anything but the sauce. Then the shrimp, cucumber and unagi was cut so small that you wouldn't even know it was on the roll.\n\nLastly, I got the spider roll and I don't know how to describe it, but it just looked old and bad. \n\nI WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! \n\nThey should re-evaluate their chefs because the food quality is LOW!", "author": "Jessica M."}

We also had 3 middle school age kids with us who were very hungry. Originally we wanted to go to Bubba Gump but since the kids were so hungry and lines were long, we found this place and thought it was perfect.\n\nThey told us it would take 5 minutes to get a table but took ~20 minutes, only after we asked again, did we get seated. It got worse. After we ordered our food, it hadn't come in almost 50 minutes!! The waitress didn't even come back to make sure everything was okay. We complained twice, still no customer service. We were brushed off over and over. The kids with us were almost crying from hunger! \n\nAfter we finally got the food and ate. We wanted to speak to the manager. He apologized and said there was a shortage of chefs that day. Then why seat more and more people and take their orders?? We were on a time crunch and it took way too long to get our food. If they were short-staffed, I understand that happens. \n\nIt would have been best to tell customers they were running late, and even if they can't control that, some customer service would have been appreciated! Never going back here.", "author": "Runa M."}

We ordered our entire meal at around 2:50. 2 appetizers and an entree. Come 3:30 (a whole 40 minutes later) our entrees arrive but no appetizer, and still no silverware either. The bartender told us that he had dropped our appetizers at another table. We witnessed this and the table mentioned to him they this couldn't be theirs but he left them anyway. About 10min later our appetizers come out. \n\nThe only time our table was visited was to take our order and drop off food. The service was poor and you often saw the staff standing around talking to each other. We were never even brought water until we asked for it when the check came. \n\nWould not recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Tyler G."}

That's about the end of the good news though.  Thank God they had happy hour when we were there because the prices were ridiculous.  Yes,  it is in a major tourist zone, but $7 for a small hot sake?!?  There were a few happy hour food items. We tried the garlic fries and they were okay. The serving was small and there wasn't a lot of garlic.  My main problem with this place is the music that they play.  It's for really OLD people.  Think smooth jazz + Karen carpenter.   Oih.

My friend wanted to try their HH menu and at first the hostess didn't even know they had a HH. But once she figured it out we were sat at the upper level of the restaurant because the lower level next to the windows do not serve HH. \n\nService was ok. Our first waitress took 5-8 minutes to come because she was in a rush to leave. I'm my opinion, it was unprofessional. It looked like the owner or manager was there right behind us and didn't even offer us waters. Poor customer service on their part. When you've been walking all day you tend to get parched.\n\nOnce our real waiter came, he was kind and attentive. Poor guy had to wait on the entire restaurant and tend the bar. Not sure if this place was trying to save money or what but 1 server at this time doesn't seem feasible.\n\nMy friend ordered the crunchy California roll and there was no crunch so she was disappointed. I ordered the Lion King (3.5/5) the seared salmon on top made this roll tasteful. I ordered the Lychi Martini and it came with cranberry? It was different but not my fav mix.\n\nI would recommend this place if you're looking for cheap and basic sushi.", "author": "Trinh V."}

My family and I were roaming through Pier 39 for a nice restaurant to dine at when we happen to see Hana Zen. We saw the the wonderful view of the bay and decided to dine here!\n\nThere was a fifteen minute wait for our table as the restaurant was busy and full at the time. I have to say the problem started with our waiter. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or not but she didn't start our mood in a right way. She seemed to have an attitude and looked annoyed when taking and serving our order. I have to note she rolled her eyes a few times before which I noticed. \n\nThe food came in great to say the least! We had two of their chicken bento box's and a few sushi rolls and fried chicken. What probably destroyed our mood was that a random lady came to our table to take random pictures of us and I felt a little uncomfortable after that. Later that lunch she came back and solicited some of those pictures to us and I felt \" pressured \" to buy the $22 postcard. I don't think this is appropriate for guests dining at a restaurant. If I wanted my picture taken I would have gone to a photo booth or something. \n\nI really don't like giving bad reviews but this one had to be yelped for the record.

Really my grandmother can make better rolls and she has no arms no legs and she's had a lobotomy\n\nPlease if you're telling me this is the best place in San Francisco then somebody is lacking a pallet\n\nBe very worried and very concerned if you go to this place it's a guaranteed food poisoning\nThe tuna had a color that I have never seen before and I have caught an eaten a lot of tuna in my time\n\nThe garlic noodles. Hmmm   Lacking originality basically they suck I Mean if you will just grab a noodle out of the bag with a piece of garlic and eat it that would be basically what you would be having it was horrible and when I mean horrible I mean absolutely horrible\n\nThe Ahi tuna salad was a joke you could grab a bag of lettuce have a drop on the floor out of your fridge raider and accidentally have the tuna land on top and that's basically what you would be getting \n\nSpicy tuna where was the spice very plain Jane horrible you could get better flavor is out of Jennie Craigs dinner plates\n  \n\nThe service !!!! Hmm !!! It f----ing  sucked bid donkey you know what  \n\n \nThe drinks to blue Hawaiians I don't know what they did to make it blue maybe they got some water from the Porta potty but all I can say is they either are used like something you put in your holding tank in your boat with a little splash of alcohol where was the pineapple juice I have no idea had to ask the waiter to bring us a glass of pineapple juice because the lady forgot to put it in and by the way we didn't get our drinks until after we were halfway through our dinner. \n\n\n\nIf there is justice in the world they would credit our card back so if you're reading this you stupid restaurant please write the review hear back to me and then we have will contact you and you can definitely credit our card back we would highly appreciate it because I'm sure we just took a bunch of laxatives that we did not know that's pretty much what we feel about your food that's probably what it will do to our stomachs it's just hasn't hit yet but I'm sure we will be up all night filling up my holding tank \n\nIf there is any good management out there hopefully they read this review feel sorry and stupid for even serving food like they do this place out to be shut down and get better food at Jack-in-the-Box and that's not saying much\n\nActually if I went to prison I can probably get better food\n\nAnyways enough of my crap talking I just wanted you guys know how bad this place really is and hopefully somebody reads this review I am not that picky the person I am truly letting you know that this place is pure crap do not eat there there's so many better places in San Francisco to eat get an Uber and go don't eat here", "author": "Mike V."}

I don't know if there is folks that live chicken with skin but that's what they serve And teriyaki chicken Bento box.

The tempura sauce and sake also tasted like bowls of water. The tofu steak was too gooey, but the mushrooms and onions on top were everything.

It was literally 100+ degrees outside. \n\nAfter walking around San Francisco and finally deciding to go to the Pier for dinner, we struck out at HardRock and Bubba Gump because of the crazy long wait (1.5-3 hour wait!!!). We found this restaurant and luckily they had no wait. The restaurant  was nice inside, and there was surprisingly not many people inside. Although it was really hot that day, they too like the other restaurants we went to had no air conditioning. Being Bay Area locals, we figured they never needed it because its SF and its ALWAYS cold. \n\nThe restaurant looks fairly new. The staff at the front was helpful and was able to seat us almost immediately with a nice dinner view of Alcatraz and the Bay. Before sitting down at our table we sat the bar, near the entrance for a little bit and ordered some drinks. The bartender, didn't seem at all happy to be working. Even though there was only 2 other people at the bar. It wasn't as if he was super busy. To our surprise, he didn't know how to make a midori sour.. He even asked us if it was on the menu and asked us for the recipe. Ummm.. you're the bartender, 1. shouldn't' you know the menu and 2. shouldn't you know how to make a midori sour? come on, if you can make an AMF I'm sue you  can make a midori sour. That was a big let down for us. \n\nWhen we got to our table we forgot our ordeal with the bartender and got distracted by the gorgeous evening view of the Bay and Alcatraz. We had ordered our food, but the service was slow. It took awhile to get  hold of the waitstaff and one of my friends orders came out really late, probably they forgot the order? The server kept saying that the kitchen was backed up. \n\nThe food overall was good and the price decent. If only they had better trained their bartenders and waitstaff. \n\nWould I come back? Maybe if the other restaurants at Pier 39 aren't packed. But, I wouldn't come to the Pier and immediately want to eat here.", "author": "Rochelle M."}

The hostess asked us how many people and we said 14. The hostess told us that we're gonna have to wait Bc they didn't have a table for us. The wait was 45mins-1 hr long. We decided to wait anyways. \n\nSecond, while waiting, some of us got a few drinks front the bar. IT SUCKED. All the drinks tasted funny. The bluemoon was VERY watered down. The blue Hawaiian tastes like water and orange juice. \n\nThird, while sitting at the bar, we noticed a group of 10 that came and got seated right away. Which surprised us because they said they didn't have seating a for a big party but that group had no reservations either and still got to sit.. then came a group of three.. then a couple groups of twos and they ALL got to sit before us. Curious, we asked the hostess if we could split up into small groups of 2's or 4's since we all came with our significant other anyways. She told us no. the wait would still be 45 mins to 1 hr. (Yes, we're literally confused at this point Bc there were so many empty tables at the front next to the bar and so many other empty seatings in the back.) \n\nFourth, we finally got to our table. We were literally left there for almost 10-15 mins without any service provided to us. Someone finally came to take our orders. FINALLY. Funny, first restaurant ever that I've been served guest water without ANY trace of an ice cube. It was actually a little warm, not even room temperature. Which is odd. No straws were given to us by our waitress bc she seemed to be in a rush, so we asked another waitress walking by for some straws. (The girl with the blonde hair and black roots) literally gave us the FUCKING DIRTIEST LOOK I've ever been given by from a waitress my entire life and she didn't even respond to us. The whole night, she kept giving us dirty ass looks whenever we tried to get any fucking attention from anyone who fucking works there. We did eventually get the straws tho. \n\nFifth, the waitress ASKED us how many miso soups we want. The way she said it was basically a fucking offer (sushi places tend to give free miso soup) which we ended up paying for. But fuck it.. they should be more clear next time. \n\nSixth, the guy who brought out our food was ridiculous!! He held the food and called it out.. we couldn't even understand WHAT THE FUCK he was saying!! He literally mumbled everything. \n\nSeventh, the quality of the food.. yeah. For the long wait? Definitely not worth it. Go spend your money somewhere else. The quality sucked. And for the price of the food? Not worth it.\n\nEighth, the check came. Nearly $500 for shitty service and shitty food. 18% gratuity tips?? for what?? Ice without water?? A waitress that stares you down?? Everything was just fucking ridiculous. Also, we couldn't even split the check?! Bc apparently \"a party can't split checks\". \n\nIn conclusion, worst fucking restaurant I've ever been to.

Service was a little slow, but maybe okay so one can enjoy the view of the bay.", "author": "Clifford W."}

So we tried Hana Zen. \n\nIt was about 1 pm on a Saturday, and we were one of only a couple tables. We were seated immediately, with a wonderful view of the bay and the bridge (as my boyfriend had never been to San Francisco before and our trip was short) - it was perfect. We ordered some sushi, and split the hot lava rock appetizer/entree - we chose steak. It thirty dollar, but the steak that came out was a decent size, and neither of us had eaten anything of a lava rock before, so we were excite for the experience. When the steak came out, it was nicely seared on one side, raw on the top, and it allowed my boyfriend to eat steak rare as rare can be, and me to eat my half dead and cooked (medium well). The lava rock steak was delicious. Our sushi was good, and on par with other sushi we've had here at home - delicious and tasty, and we had no problems with the quality or the ingredients. \n\nOur waitstaff was prompt and incredibly nice, and we loved the experience here so much that we found and purchased lava cooking rocks to use at home. We tried them, and I'm not sure how our process was different than Hana Zen's, but my half of the steak was much more difficult to get to the desired done-ness (it could be that their rock was hotter than my home over gets - as most home ovens max out at 550, and the directions were to heat the stones to 540 - 650 degrees). \n\nEating here helped make our short 12 hours in San Francisco much more memorable and enjoyable. I'd definitely return the next time I'm in town.", "author": "Karyn S."}

Waited 15 minutes after we sat in the \"bar area\" until we had to wave down a server/bartender.  The restaurant was borderline empty.  We didn't even have a happy hour menu yet.  But we are a patient group, so we stuck around and had he host get us a menu.  Had to re-wave down the bartender to order our food.  She was in the midst of some other responsibility, and began to \"explain the situation to us...?\" until the owner of the restaurant came up to us and offered to take our order. And this was after another 10 or 15 minutes.  Food came out promptly.  Food was great.  However, once we were about to close out, my card was charged to another table...so I was charged about double what I owed + gratuity.  I noticed the bill was off, so I pointed out to the bartender that I was charged wrong.  I waited another 10 minutes for the charged check to be voided and then re charged the appropriate amount.  I was patient.  I understand these things happen.  Because of the inconvenience, the bartender told me that she took off the \"required gratuity\" we were originally being charged for parties of 6+.  I thanked her, signed the new check, and I walked outside while waiting for the rest of my party to meet me outside.  It should have ended there.  She had the nerve to approach my group, have them call me back inside, and re-apply the \"required gratuity\" (which was like $2 more dollars to make it a complete 18%) with the justification that \"it covers the real estate of groups of 6 or more.\"  And that's why I am giving 1 star.  This was unprofessional.  It was a horrible experience from the beginning, and we had tried to be understanding of the situation, but pursuing a customer and going back on your word to get about $2 out of them?

Hana Zen Sushi was on our minds. Our last visit with them was amazing, the food was great and the service was spot on. \n\nMonday late afternoon we decided that sushi was going to be our dinner. Upon arriving to this establishment there was a line of a few people. Good sign to see people wanting to eat here. Waited our turn and was seated at a tiny little table. In my mind I'm thinking where were we gonna put all of our dishes as we like to order everything on the menu to try. Ok well not everything but more than any normal human should. What can I say we are foodies and we love to try stuff. \n\nWe sat at a table made for a party of one for a few minutes and I decided to ask the waiter to see if we can move to the table behind us since it was much bigger. We ended moving to the bigger table. Waiter came and asked for our order. Everything still copastetic until we get our \"food.\"\nI ordered a 15 piece sashimi meal and my GF order beef teriyaki with a side of sashimi. \n\nFood comes out and I look at it, this is a $35 plate of sashimi? Where's my rice, miso and salad? Well guess what? My \"meal\" doesn't come with any of those side that normally come with it at any other Japanese establishment. Ok it's SF and you pay top dollar for mediocre food, but at least give me what should be defined as a meal. Asked the waiter for some miso and rice, I also asked him if a salad comes with the meal. He said no salad comes with any meal. Ok fine I guess I should have expected, what was I thinking? Soup annnnnnnd salad? \n\nThe quality of the sashimi was ehhhhhh. Some pieces were fresh some were not. The salmon tasted like it was frozen, thawed, frozen, then thawed again. I know what fresh salmon should taste like because I have eaten so much salmon I could literally poop it out and reconstruct a whole school of them. Tuna seemed much better as was the scallops. \n\nSeeing that my meal was incomplete I decided to order a beef teriyaki meal to give it a go. \nTake 1:  Disappointing, beef was like something out of a movie prop. Looked tasty but inedible, I've had beef jerky more tender than this. When did they starting make beef teriyaki flavored gum? Waiter asked if it was ok and I expressed my disappointment. He takes it back and a few minutes later another server brings out another order.  \n\nTake 2: See Take 1 - Yup it's that bad\n\nWell to make this long story short we finished what we could and ask for the bill, hmmm a SF healthy charge? Nice, we eat, we give you money, then we give you more money so you can pay for YOUR employees' health benefits. How about giving them more pay so they can actually live in the city they work. Food for thought mini ramble. What has this city become...\n\nWell me being me I pull up the health inspection of this place. I was pretty shocked at what I saw. Here a little bonus for the curious minds....", "author": "Truth H."}

We ended up getting a strawberry margarita ($6), beer ($4), calamari ($5), & spicy tuna roll ($5). \n\nWhile our order was being placed, we just sat back and stared out the window!

Waiter did not bring out soy sauce, so I gave him a few minutes, let him pass our table a couple times, then finally gave up and walked over to a recently vacated table to grab a bottle of soy sauce on my own. We also noticed the table next to us complaining about the service - sounded like they ordered something and were charged for it despite the fact that the waiter never brought out the food. Manager/owner came to \"mediate\" but just stood there as the waiter argued with the customer over whether the dish was really served. The customer got tired of arguing and finally just said, forget it, just run the card so we can get out of here. Very uncomfortable. \n\nFinally, the food was bad.

The pomegranate margarita was just watered down pomegranate juice with cheap tequila and some lime juice, not worth the $7 we paid for it. The lychee rendezvous just tasted like water with a hint of infused lychee...the only redeeming quality was that the bartender muddled one real lychee into the drink - but still not worth $7. \n\nAnd as if the flies weren't bad enough, we saw a food runner deliver a plate of fried sushi to a table and the rolls were rolling all over the plate, even into his hand.

Manager was talking to the tables around us, didn't even stopped by ours, maybe bec we where just wearing sweats and nikes, she only talked to the people wearing formal to semi formal clothes!

I tried a spicy tuna sushi roll, potstickers & chicken karaage for my daughter, and I wouldn't recommend any of them.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting great things, but the karaage was the poorest of quality- much of it was fried bits of batter with no chicken inside, my daughter rejected after several bites it and she'll eat almost anything fried.  The sushi was large and saucy but disproportionately little fish and quite mediocre.  Nothing I had compelled me to dine here again when I'm in the area with my daughter.", "author": "Andy S."}

Buser would start at one table, but then leave to go to another before finishing and then would only partly clear the next.  It was like he didn't even have the sense to know if you don't complete one you can't seat new guests at it.  Was like watching a sad comedy team.  \n\nTrying to flag them down for a check was also time consuming.  Watched multiple groups of people come and go because staff was too unorganized to wait on them.  And this was at three o'clock in the afternoon when they were not even busy yet.

Wait till you read this. \n\nI entered on a Sunday around mid day. I was seated with 6 students who I was with as a teacher/chaperone. We had a coupon for California rolls and miso soup and so that was what we all ordered. A heavily tattooed man took our drink order and all the kids ordered Coke while I asked for tea, to which he responded,  \"we don't have tea\". What? A Japanese restaurant with no hot or cold tea? OK so I ordered a diet Coke. When the Cokes arrived, I reconfirmed that mine was a diet. The waiter responded \"yes, it is\". well... no it wasn't. Again, OK I'll just drink it. \nNext came four miso soups. Other people from our tour group had come in later and seated near us ordered the same meal were promptly served. When I inquired about the missing miso, I was told \"we are busy, you will get them\". Well we got them 10 minutes later and interestingly, they were neither hot nor cold, sort of room temperature. \nNext the sushi arrived to the party behind us who had come in 20 minutes after us and then five of our California rolls arrived but not the other two. No small dishes for soy sauce, no soy sauce, it never came. We had \"dry\" sushi. Finally the other two came and the waiter said that the chefs were \"backed up\" Still no logic as to why the people behind us got their full meal and we, who had arrived earlier with the same order got only half of ours. \nI later asked to speak to the manager and was told she was \"too busy\". The waiter saw me speaking to the hostess about our problems and he then came up to me and said \"Hey dude, you need to chill, you are all eating off of coupons free and can't complain\". (Our vouchers were full-pay).\nI would suggest that this \"waiter\" get into another profession. From his appearance alone, he would be better off in a biker shop but he certainly does not know how to deal with customers and should not be in a place where he works with the general public. Yelling at customers is not a way to keep customers returning. \nAs it is in a very touristy area (Pier 39) perhaps they don't care about customer service as they will have a steady supply of new customers however word does spread and I notice that the yelp ratings are rather poor already. \nTo top this all off, I now have a stomach ache and have read, here on Yelp,  about numerous food poisoning complaints with this place.

We ordered the seafood salad, 15 piece sashimi, beef teriyaki dinner with 4 piece sashimi, oysters, and another beef teriyaki dinner. Seafood salad was so tiny...good by very small. The salmon sashimi was bad, thin uneven slices that literally fell apart when we took a bite. It didn't taste fresh at all. They were out of oysters! But, what really topped off our experience was the over cooked chewy beef. I managed to get my little piece down since I was hungry and we had limited time to find food elsewhere. But my mans meat was much larger and just as tough! It was like beef chewing gum, no joke. We sent it back twice and eventually gave up. I had to ask for my miso soup and the waiter actually asked if I still wanted it. Uhhhhh yea... It comes with my $36 dinner! No side salads in this place... Nope! You get a side of undercooked crunchy vegetables instead. 100 bucks later and still hungry we left upset. \n\nNegative stars would be appropriate.

By the time it arrived (the kitchen obviously had to make it after we've told her) we have had enough of being there, we asked her to have it to go. Our four year old wanted to leave so we asked him to ask one of the waitresses nicely for our bill and he came back saying that he was told that she doesn't know what language he was speaking and walked off (he speaks with a New Zealand accent but IT'S STILL ENGLISH! If the restaurant wasn't playing such loud pumping music perhaps she would have heard him properly!) not just that but she could have come to our table to check on us if we needed anything! We gave up waiting and went to the counter to ask for our bill, and there was more standing around and waiting for anyone who knew anything about customer service! \n\nThis place has to be the worst Japanese restaurant we've been to in our travels! It is disorganised and lacks flow and communication between staff.

It was alright, but Lion King is usually supposed to be heavily filling with its baked salmon and loads of mango sauce. Instead, they went for more of the \"classy dining\" route and unfortunately skimped on the flavours instead of making it the hearty sushi roll it was supposed to be. I also had the Philadelphia Roll and its usually one of my favourite rolls as well, but unfortunately was only \"meh\". They overloaded it with cream cheese and had it completely overpower the flavour of the salmon when there normally should be a fine balance.\n\n---\n\nWith how pricey Hana Zen is, you would think that they would provide quality as well.

It is fun to watch all of the boats go by.\nThe downside is that we had plenty of time to watch the scenery because the food service was unusually slow.  It took two hours altogether to have a one course lunch without dessert or coffee.  Our waitress was polite, and refilled our water glasses regularly.  Fish and chips looked good.  The chicken teriyaki bento was also a good choice.\nOne of the other servers was sitting on the stool in the bathroom texting on her phone.  When someone else questioned her about it, since it was a tiny two stall bathroom with a long line, she claimed that she was there to check on the cleanliness of the bathroom.

Unfortunately it was night time so I didn't get a chance to experience the view, although I'm sure it is lovely.\n\nWe are both SF natives & yes we knew it was going to be packed full of tourists but who cares. Sometimes it's fun to play tourist in your own city. Anyway, for all the comments that say meh it's mediocre... It's because Yall don't know how to order. When you go to a restaurant you HAVE TO HAVE what the restaurant is known for. DUH that's why there is Yelp.\n\nWe ordered the dynamite mussels, sashimi plate & the filet mignon lava rock. You guys MUST try the lava rock plate, preferably the filet mignon. Basically it is a super hot lava rock where you place the meat on top and it cooks it fast & to how perfect you want it. You have to watch it because the rock is so hot you CAN over cook your meat. Anyway, the seasoning was perfect. It came with fried rice & vegetables. The 3 dishes were perfect for the 2 of us. We practically murdered it & washed it down with 2 bottles of cold sake.\n\nAt the end of our meal the waiter, which by the way gave us the perfect service presented me with a rose for vday.... Secretly requested by my dude!\n\nHad a great experience full of laughter, great company & good food!! Will definitely come back during the day.", "author": "Jazzmin A."}

We ordered the Omakase sashimi special, which in every other Japanese restaurant means the chef's BEST choice of fish. It's a high dollar way to ensure you're getting the best of the house...the cuts that the sushi chef would be proud to being home to his mamma. However, at this place, it meant tuna, salmon, yellow tail, \"white\" tuna, yellow tail belly, mackerel, and salmon roe. Really?  That's a typical run of the mill sashimi combination in any half rated joint.  But to charge $75 for that?  I feel we have a very different opinion of Omakase, unfortunately. \n\nPS. The mackerel was so bad I had to spit it out into a napkin. Very fishy (even for an oily fish like mackerel) and mushy instead of firm as it is supposed to be. \n\nThe waitress was friendly enough and the unfiltered sake was yummy.", "author": "J M."}

I wanted to grab dinner here since I was at the Pier and wanted some sushi. There were plenty of seats both at the bar and in the main dining area. Happy hour was from opening til closing and thought it would be a good idea. After waiting almost 10 minutes to get noticed the bartender took our order for some Garlic Noodles (full plate is still really small), some fried calamari w/ spicy mayo sauce (super greasy and salty), spicy tuna roll and some water.... First off the bartender couldn't tell me the portion sizes of the noodles. After taking our order he brings back some water & mind you... there are no utensils on my table. Noodles and Calamari come and still no utensils... I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for utensils and he comes back to our table with chopsticks.. no napkins, NOTHING... just the chopsticks.. We are still waiting for our tuna roll and have already finished our food.. then it finally arrives. Nobody even asked if we wanted any refills on our water.  \n\nHonestly, I thought the service could have been better especially since you are in one of the most visited areas of San Francisco. I thought wrong. The bartender was too busy cutting limes and taking multiple shots of tequila.. (overheard him say he's actually a rum guy...

We went there on a recommendation from a family member for a quick after party early dinner.  After we sat down a member of the party read the yelp warning about a poor health and safety review by the city.  That made our decision to not order raw easier.   \n\nWe were seated in the back corner of the restaurant near the serving station, kitchen and raw bar.  The view was amazing...Alcatraz loomed in the distance and the entire bay was laid out before us.  Boats whizzed by to the delight of my two year old son.  Not five minutes after that, I kid you not, a large mouse or a small rat ran across a ten foot section of floor from the serving station to a nearby cabinet.  A server saw the vermin, looked surprised, but appeared to shrug it off and do nothing about it.  I should have gotten up and left but we were with a large family party and didn't want to make a scene so we collected our belongings up off the floor and ordered food.  \n\nI ordered the ahi steak dinner but decided to have it cooked to medium to ward off any potential food born illness.  What arrived was a cold, clammy pale piece of fish with no flavor served with under cooked (read raw carrots) vegetables. The broccoli and zuccini were cooked ok.  We ordered my son the breaded pork kids bento box.  The pork was too tough and chewy for him to eat and he choked a few times and spit the food out.  We resorted to feeding him regular potato fries (sweet potato fries were advertised), rice and vegetables, avoiding the once again raw carrots.  The carrots were just too raw and hard for him to eat. My wife had the salmon teriyaki dinner and she said it was good enough to eat, but just meh.  (We were starving and hadn't eaten food all day!)  We wound up with a nice pile of raw carrots to feed to the sea lions!  LOL.\n\nOn the plus side our server was nice and responsive and catered to our son.  He dropped several forks during dinner and the staff was quick to replace them with what I assume to be clean utensils numerous times, so props to them for having the patience to deal with a two year old.  We ordered a large sake to split between two tables and she provided it in three small bottles across two tables, which was a nice touch that prevented us from having to go between tables to pour drinks.\n\nDinner for the three of us with a large beer and bottle of large sake amounted to $100+, ridiculous in my opinion for the food that we got and the risk of eating vermin infected food. \n\nI waited for the next few hours to get sick but nothing happened.  In the end we all ate and nobody got sick.  This place must cater to unsuspecting tourists with its great views of the bay and Alcatraz.  As said before several boats flew by close to the end of the pier during dinner, whipping up waves and providing great entertainment for my son who unsuspectingly loved every minute.  However, being a native I should have known better than to go there anticipating great sushi.  Go there for drinks and atmosphere...not for food.  If you want to eat, avoid at all costs.

They tried to hand me someone elses bill, and they had to ask around to find my bill. Wouldve been the easiest dine n dash of my life. Darn my conscience.\n\nSince they took so long to get my bill, i was unable to grab a half decent spot to watch the fireworks. So, i decided to watch from inside the restaurant's lobby. They told me, \"you finished, so you need to get out. Right now.\" What a joke, seriously.", "author": "Daniel W."}

We were seated right by the window, which had a great view of Alcatraz and the bridge. \n\nWhen it came down to our food, my friend got the chicken teriyaki bento (lunch menu, $15.50) and i got the tamago donburi (lunch menu, $10.00). My order consisted of mushrooms, eggs, and fishcake over rice, while my friend had the usual box; chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, california roll, and tempura\n\nOverall, food was pretty good. My donburi was great! Super hot though, so you'd probably wanna mix that baby up if you ordered it. The mushrooms were sliced and had a nice consistency to them, and with the fishcake and rice, it tasted good. My friend really liked his box. The chicken was pretty unique, since it was crunchy, as compared to other chicken teriyaki from other places. \n\nWe then ordered a green tea ice cream for dessert ($3.25) It was so smooth in texture, and it tasted like it was made straight from the leaves! \n\nThey do accept card, pretty awesome! What's not awesome is that the prices were wayyy up there for just a bento. But if the quality of food is exceptional, i suppose the price is alright too.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

We waited at the hostess desk for 15 minutes while the hostess cleared tables to be able to seat us (we where a party of three). When she took us to the table there was no app plates, napkins anything. When I went to sit on the booth seat it was covered in rice. We waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge us, never asked if we would like water or something to drink. When he finally did come over and take the drink order, we went ahead and ordered our food. I asked a simple question of what the seafood that was listed in a salad was and all he could say was shrimp, well when you think of seafood it is more then just shrimp. So decided to pass. We ordered 3 rolls and some garlic noodles. Thirty minutes later empty drinks and still no food. Ten minutes later food arrive, the 3 separate rolls we ordered arrived on the same plate and he had trouble telling us what was what. Never bothered to asked if we would like anything else to drink. We couldn't even ask because as soon as he said the plates down he rushed away. The place was not that busy there was 10-15 empty tables. The rolls where poorly rolled (very loose) and bland, not very fresh for what you expect in San Francisco. We gave up trying to order anything else to drink as we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. 15 minutes after we had finished eating I finally asked for the check. 5 minutes later received it $62 dollars for 3 small rolls, a small portion of garlic noodles, a soda, and two beers. Not worth the cost. Sat another 15 minutes waiting for the waiter to take the check, asked the hostess that was yet again clearing a table if she could run it for us so we could leave, she said sure no problem, looked at the check and then went and handed it to the waiter, whom took another 10 minutes to bring it back to us... Slowest, poor service ever. Almost 2 hours for 3 rolls and some noodles. \n\nThis will not be on our to go to list again... I would suggest anyone wanting sushi to go over to Chinatown.

When we got there, we were seated promptly, but given one menu to share among the six of us. When we started asking our waitress about the drinks, she mentioned that being a very busy weekend, they were out of one or two of the sake that was in the flight we wanted to try. She went back to the bar to inquire what sake was available, and she came back with a bar menu that had only four types of sake on there and said this was all they had. But it had no prices. So we asked for more information, but she came back with two bottles, and told us this was all what they were going to give us. We understood that it was a busy weekend, but regardless, the waitress didn't feel it important to give us the list of options we wanted to purchase, and pretty much forced mediocre choices on us. It seemed that as our inquiries progressed about getting sake, the options they allowed us to purchase became fewer, until finally we pretty much had no choice at all. Never got a straight answer as to what was actually available until they told us \"this is all we're going to serve you.\"\n\nThese place leverages their good location and don't really care about hospitality or the service experience. We decided to avoid the food, as their health score was poor and for a sushi place, that seemed a little unbelievable that it's not been closed down.

This is NOT a good restaurant. My friends and I went on Sunday and were extremely disappointed. An empty restaurant that couldn't accommodate 6 people by the window which is fine but we couldn't enjoy happy hour cause they wouldn't seat us in that designated area. The sad part of this is the service and food. They were out of certain drinks (all IPA and corona and some mango drink) the ones we did order had more ice than drink. They were out of ribs and sea bass. We waited 45 minutes for some food to arrive. They served 2 people first and the rest of us waited quite some time. That is poor etiquette specially for the prices they charge ($271). I've visited many Japanese restaurants and for this place to try and fit under that umbrella is a farce. No class or hospitality. I don't mind paying at all but not for this. Then of course they include the tip in the bill ($38) which if I could have it would have been $0. They take advantage of tourists apparently. To close they try and sell us a post card of a pic they took of us. No way!

We sat at a window table with an awesome view of the bay. The restaurant was surprisingly empty considering the view location on pier 39. We ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box with tempura, California rolls, rice, and a salad with no dressing. The teriyaki chicken was terrible. So bad we couldn't eat it. We should have sent it back. The tempura was sub par, the California rolls were sub par, and the salad had no dressing. We had to ask the waitress to bring a side of dressing. The service was sub par. Our water glasses were never refilled. Not worth the $17.95 charged for each bento box. This is actually the worst Japanese restaurant we have ever been to, and we love Japanese food. To top it all off we were charged a Healthy SF fee of $1.88. I asked the waitress what this was and she said it was for health insurance and that all the restaurants charge this. I told her that we had been to many San Francisco restaurants during our stay and this was the first one that charged us this fee. What a crock. Why is it our responsibility to pay for someone else's health insurance. We did not appreciate them charging this to us without our permission. It should be our choice whether we want to contribute or not. It's not a lot of money, but it's the principal. I also wonder if the money is actually used toward health insurance, or pocketed by the restaurant. All that set aside, we had terrible food and terrible service.

You figure you come to a tourist trapped area like Pier 39 and you don't expect the food to be good. I was wrong. I have been to the Hana Zen in downtown and they have always been very consistent.

Says something about a restaurant when on a Saturday night at peak dining hours the place is only about 30% full. \n\nI ordered a glass of cab and the bf got a Sapporo. So far so good.\n\nWe ordered edamame for an appetizer, and a Sunset Strip, and a Spicy Shrimp Tempura roll. Since both rolls were specialty rolls, which are generally larger, we thought this would be enough.\n\nFirst major failure - the first item we got was the Sunset Strip. This was 5 pieces of small cubes of fish wrapped in cucumber. I thought this would come with some other filler, but no, it was glorified (expensive) nigiri. And only 5 small pieces.\n\nAfter seeing this tragic roll and scarfing it down, we realized we would be starving without something else, so we quickly ordered a Spicy Tuna roll to supplement. \n\nOrdered after, the Spicy Tuna was the next thing to come out. It was ok, quite spicy, but overall just ok. 2.5 stars.\n\nFINALLY, 2 out of 3 rolls down, our edamame comes out. Great, we finally get to snack on our appetizer.\n\nLastly, the Spicy Shrimp Tempura roll comes out. This is the only saving grace of this restaurant. It was good. 4 stars for this roll alone.\n\nThank god I had gotten an internet deal for $20 off our meal, cause had we paid full price for the worst service and food delivery I've ever experienced, I couldn't have given the saving grace extra star. \n\nI give this place 6 months, tops, before it's out of business.

With a lot of great options in San Francisco, including many sushi restaurants, our expectations were high going into the meal and we were not disappointed.   \n\nHanna has two locations in the city and we visited the one on the end of Pier 39. The restaurant fit in the upscale casual market niche.  Our server, Sheryl, was doubling as hostess that evening, and immediately let us know that it was happy hour.  The bar was almost full, and she offered to let us have happy hour food and beverages at our table so we would not have to move.\n\nWe decided to go with a tapas style meal and choose different items to eat.  Our first three choices came off the happy hour menu and included traditional edammame ($4), a crunchy California roll ($6 for eight pieces) and a spicy tuna roll ($6 for six pieces). While all three were basic choices, the presentation of the two rolls showed the sushi chefs had some real skills.\n\nThey further showcased their abilities with our second course of sushi nigiri ($5.50-$8.50 for two pieces). All the fish was very fresh and perfectly sized.  We had yellowtail, white tuna belly and red snapper sashimi; with flying fish roe halibut and sea urchin sushi.  \n\nOur final course included three items from the main menu appetizers section, Goma-ae ($4.95 Boiled Spinach Salad), Gyuhireniku Tataki ($7.95 Beef Carpaccio Japanese style) and Deep Fried Scallops($12).  Wow! The Carpaccio was presented in a mix of finely cut vegetable in a ponzu sauce that really popped in your mouth.  We wished there were more pieces to share.  The Goma-ae was served with a light sesame dressing with toasted sesame seeds on top.   The scallops  were a big surprise with the breading being a light Panko covering with a mild-spicy mayo on the side.  \n\nSheryl moved the meal along through each course which included wine and micro-brews from the bar.  She was great at balancing too much and too little attention to our experience.  There are no white table clothes on the table and you can dress evening casual to meals here.  The d\u00e9cor was more casual bar-like, but featured a quiet ambiance that allowed conversation at the table without raising your voice.  Oh yeah and the view, overlooks the San Francisco Bay.

I've been there about five times, though, because my co-workers seem to enjoy overpriced, ill-prepared, old fish.  But I digress. . . \n\nWe were a party of four on our lunch break today.  Thursdays is supposed to be a 30% discount to other workers in the area at Hana Zen.  When we got there, I confirmed with the host that the 30% discount still applied.  Yes, it did.  First problem was the menu.  I had looked online beforehand and made this AWESOME spreadsheet.  When I say I looked online, I mean I looked on THEIR website.\n\n\nHere is the contents of my spreadsheet:\n\n\nIka Maruyaka 12.00\nSaba Nigiri  5.00\nTuna roll 5.75\nOshinko Moriawase 5.95\n$28.70\nFUN FACTOR: 10\nBANG4BUK FACTOR: 4\n$28.70 -  14 = 14.7\nConversion: 20 - 14.7 / 2 = 2.65  3/10\n\nVs\n\nChirashi Sushi 24.95\nOshinko Moriawase 5.95\n$30.90\nFUN FACTOR: 5\nBANG4BUK FACTOR: 4\n$30.90 - 9 = 21.9\nConversion: 20 - 21.9 / 2 =  -.95  0/10\n\n\n\nVs\n\nLunch menu: Zen's sushi combination (no avocado!) 16.95  \nOshinko Moriawase 5.95\n$22.90\nFUN FACTOR: 5\nBANG4BUK FACTOR: 10\n$22.90 - 15 = 7.9\nConversion: 20 - 7.9 / 2 =  6.05  6/10\n\n\nVs\n\nWakame Udon 9.50\nTuna roll 5.75\nOshinko Moriawase 5.95\n$21.20\nFUN FACTOR: 8\nBANG4BUK FACTOR: 10\n$21.20 - 18 = 3.2\nConversion: 20 - 3.2 / 2 =  8.4 = 8/10\n\nWhen we got there, the waiter informed us that the menu had changed, so they didn't have the Oshinko Moriawase (mixed pickles) or the Ika Maruyaka (Squid skewers).  Actually, I don't think they menu has changed.  Now that I'm thinking about it, I think the waiter just wasn't familiar with the menu.  Also, there seemed to be a language barrier, but I'm not 100% sure.  Anyway, I ordered the Lunch menu: Zen's sushi combination and a seaweed salad.  \n\nMy co-workers ordered a few vegetarian sushi items from the menu.  One thing they ordered was two avocado rolls.  These are just like rice, seaweed, and avocado, and they're cheap.   \n\nWhen our food came, their avocado rolls had magically morphed into salmon and avocado rolls.  They told the waiter they ordered just avocado, but the waiter didn't seem to understand at first, and then he didn't seem to know what to do, so as the situation got more and more of a hassle, they just said they would take the salmon/avocado rolls so to avoid wasting food.  I should add, one co-worker doesn't want to eat salmon for ethical reasons, but he'd rather eat it than have it thrown out.  The other co-worker doesn't like raw salmon.  \n\nSO, they took the rolls.  The waiter seemed relieved.\n\nThe food was predictably dreadful.  (And the company was predictably delightful, THANK GOD FOR THAT).\n\nWhen the bill came, we were noticed we weren't comped the 30% discount (a main factor in our deciding to go there, by the way), and my co-workers were surprised to see that they were charged for two salmon avocado rolls @ almost $7 dollars each rather than two of the cheaper $5 avocado rolls. (I think that's still too much, but whatever).  Taking the salmon was kind of a hardship for them.  They just ate it to make things easier.  No one thought they'd be charged a higher price on top of that.\n\nI took the bill back to the waiter and explained to him that we should get a 30% discount on Thursdays due to a local merchant agreement. And I pointed on the bill where he'd billed us for the more expensive sushi we didn't order.  My co-workers didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I just told him that they didn't really want the salmon, and they just took it as a favor, so it didn't seem fair to charge them for something more expensive than what they actually ordered, particularly since they only took it so it wouldn't go in the trash.  \n\nHe returned with the re-worded bill.  Still being charged for the choked-down salmon, and the discount? now upped from 0% to 15%.\n\nWe left because it was a pleasant lunch and we didn't want to ruin it by bickering over ten or twelve bucks.\n\nI will probably avoid going back to this place.  There are three other sushi places in walking distance, and two of them are very good and good value for money with attentive service.", "author": "C S."}

Inside and out. \n\nThe ambiance inside the restaurant is very open, refined, zen like and sophisticated. One glance at this venue  and I imagined it to be an awesome location if it were to be converted to an upscale lounge after hours. The exterior displays a direct view of Alcatraz from afar and the Golden Gate bridge in the mist of  SF fog.\n\nCompared to the Hana Zen in downtown, this venue is quite extravagant.  I favor the downtown Hana Zen because I frequent it after my shopping excursions and the staff is just amazing there. Arthur rocks!\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Kobe beef, sunrise roll, dragon roll, and a sashimi platter.  I noticed that the menu incorporated a few new rolls here. I highly recommend the dragon roll which is my all time favorite. If you like spicy, ask for a side of hot sauce. It makes a wonderful combination instead of wasabi. The price is also a tad bit higher but what do you expect for any restaurant at Pier 39. In terms of the quality of the food, it is comparable to the other Hana Zen which I very much enjoy. The sashimi was also very fresh. Bonus points! \n\nThe service was superb and overall my first experience here was awesome. If anyone if seeking a top quality Japanese restaurant  with a beautiful view in the town of tourist, look no further!

Hana Zen is a good place to take your visiting cousin from Kansas, or, if you're feeling mean, your landlocked in-laws from Modesto, so you can show them what they're missing in the city.\n\nThe sushi and sashimi are fresh, as you would expect in San Francisco, but the rolls are uninspired and most of the rest of the food is mediocre or worse.  Tempura, fried oysters, etc. are unusually greasy here, dessert options are pretty limited, and...well, I guess coffee isn't really a Japanese thing, but then, neither is Hana Zen, so it'd be nice to be able to get a cup, you know?  My impression is that the dessert and coffee shortcomings are intentional, to help Hana Zen turn tables during the summer and on weekends.\n\nThe waitstaff is pleasant enough, but they're one of those groups that tries and fails to keep up on busy nights, and makes themselves scarce so they can BS in the back on slow nights.  Either way, you get lousy service.  They'd sell a lot more sake if they actually checked back with you once in a while.", "author": "Brian E."}

So many cheap  Japanese restaurant with average food. \n\nThey got 1 star b/c their service was terrible. This brought their 2.5 star down to a 1. I'd give them a negative if I could. Our server said he'd bring us tea, after 30 mins we had to ask for it. We had 8 ppl in our party and they only gave us one pot which he even mention earlier that he would give us two pots. So we had to ask for another pot which took another 10-15 to get a server's attention. The restaurant was not even half full. One person ordered a beer, after 20 mins we asked bout it and it finally came. After a while another person ordered a beer. This time we had ask about the beer 3x, then when it finally came...two server came to our table w a beer. So the second server said 'Oh it's ok. You can just have this one too.' But instead of leaving both cups there, he switch the beer in his hand for the beer that was on the table??? Didn't even touch the first cup. \n\nDessert time! We decided to ordered 4 different dessert to share. They said that they were out of one, so we ordered something else. The dessert came in 10-15 mins which is fine. 5 mins into our dessert, I saw a server bringing out the dessert that they told us they were out of and served it to a couple that came in way after us! WTH??\n\nOk... Whatever! Let's just pay and get outta here! We pay with 2 credit cards. I looked at the server and said $75 on this card and the rest on this card. He barely even looked at me or the card I was talking about. Said 'YEA, YEA, YEA.' impatiently and rudely and took off. took 30 mins for them to charge the credit card and four guys surrounding the credit card machine. Turns out there was some malfunction with the machine. Looked @ the receipt and sure enough.. they charged the wrong card.  $75 was charged on CC#2 and the rest of the bill on CC#1. We left it the was it was, we did not want to stay there another 30 mins.\n\nFinally left. We're outside and my friend realized she had given the busser her parking ticket for validation. She went back in and asked the busser for her parking ticket. He started to arguing with her telling her that he doesn't have it. That he had given it back to her.

We got our drink order in almost right when we sat down, but after about 20 minutes (and an almost empty restaurant) we still hadn't gotten our drinks.  We asked for waters early on, and those eventually came AFTER we got our cocktails.  Most of us got various rolls, my best friend and I shared the Lion King roll and the Crispy Spicy Tuna roll.  We also ordered two sides of Edamame for the table.  The rolls were pretty good, and we were all served at once despite there being only one guy manning the sushi bar.  We brought our own birthday desserts and provided our own candles.  Most of us had to order drinks two at a time since it was taking SO long to bring them out.  By the time we were done, it was almost 10pm (reservations were at 8:30) and the place was completely empty.  Overall, Hana Zen is really just OK.

He said yes, we have a small side salad.  \n\nHe brought the salad in a timely manner.  It was a field greens salad with carrots and italian dressing.  I have never had italian dressing on a salad at a Japanese restaurant.  It was cheap bottled italian dressing to boot.  Yuck.  I envisioned a nice ginger dressing of some sort.\n\nThe edamame followed.  It came in a piping hot bowl with not one grain of salt.  \n\nThe rainbow roll was simply mediocre.  The fish was slightly dry but tasty none the less.  \n\nI was not thanked when the bill was brought.  I was not thanked nor acknowledged by the bartender nor hostess when I left.  \n\nIn my opinion, this is a beautiful spot to have a drink because of the view.  I would eat elsewhere next time I am in the area.", "author": "Gina V."}

We went on a Thursday night in February. It is a short walk to the end of Pier 39 but worth it because there were no tourists and we had the place almost to ourselves. The restaurant has a great decor and beautiful views of the Bay (if you go during the day). The wait staff was friendly and very helpful, the service very good.\n\nThe sake flight consisted of three short glasses of crystal clear rice wine. Very interesting flavors, though personally, I've discovered that I prefer my sake hot.\n\nThe food was great! We started with Miso soup, which was served hot (not luke-warm as in some places) It had good proportions of kelp and tofu. The second course was Tempura prawns and veggies. They were done well, not greasy. My only critique of the Tempura was that the dipping sauce was bland, didn't add anything to the tempura. Then came the sashimi plate: What a delight! There were five kinds of fish in a classy presentation , the best being the Hamachi and Salmon, I've not had better cuts, they just melted in your mouth! We each had a small bowl of sushi sticky rice on the side and it was amazing in itself! Warm, perfect consistency, and with a mild vinegar fragrance that added a wonderful element to the flavor. I could have had a bowl of just the rice!\n\nAfter all that food we didn't have much room for desert but couldn't resist the warm chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and fresh sliced strawberry. Another beautiful presentation, and flavors that are to die for. We left happy, though noting that it was the first time in memory we left a sushi place feeling stuffed. It was all so good we just couldn't stop ourselves!\n\nI highly recommend Hana Zen at Pier 39.", "author": "Steve R."}

I also ordered two pieces of hamachi nigiri which was $5.25 and the fish slabs were small.\n\nTo top it off I understand this is a tourist place but we were on a work lunch and our waitress took her sweet ass time.

So finally with my friends from out of town and I went to try it out one Saturday night. \n\nWe got there at 6:30pm, there was only 3 or 4 other parties inside eating, which was kind of odd being a very nice beautiful packed sunny day at the Pier. We got seated right away and ordered our drinks and miso soups to start up, about 10 minutes after that  we were ready to order. We sat there and waited for about an additional 15 for our server to come back with our drinks (Too long). When we ordered we did not help but notice that there were only 2 servers for the whole place (not enough)! \n10 minutes later they bring out just ONE roll and the miso soups for everyone, kinda late since we ordered them right when we sat down! \n\nWe were a party of six so it was so odd that they would only bring one of our orders before everyones, since in the majority of restaurants all the orders are brought together. No kidding 20 minutes later our server begins to bring out the rest of the orders ONE BY ONE as they are being made. One of us goes by the chef area and notices that there is ONLY ONE sushi chef!?!? To us that was just ridiculous, being that they are located right on Pier 39, its a weekend and to have only one chef 2 servers for the whole place. Our server was a very nice guy and understanding, he kept apologizing about the one chef situtation, so no wonder the place was practically empty but still we were there for a very long time (over an hour) and the majority of the time we were just waitng for our food. \nWe did not get full of our food and we did not want to order more since we did not want to wait any longer than we already had. I ONLY recommend their desserts now those were really good!\n\nThe food was ok ive definately had better! Plus their rolls were TOO small and TOO expensive, our bill came out to $300 (wayyy too much) sooo NOT worth it!! \nI dont know if this was just a one day incident or if its always like that but i would not go back, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT save your money cuz there are OTHER BETTER and affortable sushi places in the City!! \nLooks can be deceiving it looks SUPER nice the location and inside the restaurant but the service and food not quite so well.", "author": "Jess J."}

Its on pier 39 and usually my rule is no going to places that are tourist trap types, but I gave Hana Zen a shot. \n\n\nWhen we got there it seemed a bit empty and but overall the atmosphere was nice. The view is probably amazing during the day but it was a stormy night for us so all we say was blackness accented by little dots of light in the bay, with the occasional pedestrian scurrying by to avoid the rain. Not bad overall tho. \n\nThe service seemed sluggish. If they had just opened or were reopening, its understandable that it could be a little slow but that wasn't the end of it. Our food came out in a very odd order. We ordered edamame  and 3 rolls. The rolls came out haphazardly with the edamame  coming out after a roll had already arrived. This was just odd. They must have forgotten about the edamame  and then brought it once they remembered. Kinda strange. So Slow and maybe forgetful, with very few checks ins. Not great traits. \n\nOn to the food. Ok so first we ordered the Sunset Strip roll, a spicy tempura shrimp roll, and a spicy tuna. The spicy tuna roll was just what you would expect and was fine. Not great, but fine. The Sunset Strip roll was a special roll, so it was kinda pricey but not really that good. It had a lot of fish wrapped in cucumber, so it was unique, but lacked that special flavor combination that you expect when you order sushi. It was just various fish that melded to make generic fish flavor and lacked any sort of real depth. So it just seemed like a rip off. The spicy tempura roll however, was great. It had a nice crunch and good spice to it, with a good back of tuna flavor bringing up the rear, a good Crunch Spice Tuna combo that hit you satisfyingly. Quite good. In fact it was the restaurants saving grace. I mean without that roll, I would have been upset at the fact we ate here. But the combo of having the coupon and this roll saved my mood. Actually, come to think of it, the only reason I wasn't mad was that we had the discount coupon for it. This is important because I was going to go 2 stars for my experience, but for everyone else who didn't have the coupon, I am going to have to go 1 because the food and experience simply was not worth it.

The menu is diverse, the service outstanding and the bottom line...food was excellent. We ordered sashimi, tempura, adegashi tofu, yak tori etc. I am a big sashimi and tempura fan. Having been to Japan a couple dozen times, sashimi before it tastes great has to look fresh. Also, the tempura should not look like \"chicken fried steak \" but must have a thin crisp coating that needs to be almost transparent. I must admit, this place is 5 stars on both of theses items.

When we arrived at Pier 39, our first thought was \"Ugh, really?!  Sushi in a tourist joint?\"  This restaurant is hidden all the way in the very back of Fisherman's Wharf and you have to walk through the throngs of tourists and school field trips to get there.  Probably part of the reason it was half empty even on a Friday night.  But once you step in, you're in a different world, definitely unexpected nice decor and ambiance.  The sushi itself was just average, not bad, but definitely at a higher price point.  The service was friendly, maybe a little slow for being fairly empty.  \n\nThe view, though - wow!  I would come just to eat dinner at sunset, watching the colors hit the Bay, lighting up Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz in the distance.

And it was missing the cucumber! I'm only now realizing that there was no crunch to the roll...just mushy with the crab & avocado. \n\nCrunch California roll was another mushy thing.

My sister came to town to visit and wanted to go to the pier for dinner and walk around and stumbled upon this place so we decided to walk in and try it. First off, we walked in and no one greeted us because the host was on her cellphone. Eventually we got her attention and was seated. Secondly, our server never came to greet our table or introduce herself so we never knew who our server was. After a while, someone came to our table and greeted us and she said she wasn't our server and was helping her coworker take cause of us, so we assumed her coworker was our server .. But she still hasn't come around to our table yet. So we ordered food and alcoholic drink. So this one server rudely dropped off our drinks without saying anything and turned around and walked away, we literally had no idea who dropped off the drinks for us because she disappeared that fast. Not only did we not know who our server was, the service was just a horrible experience. They were supposed to be 'really' busy but what kind of restaurant would only schedule 3 servers on a weekend night? Makes no sense .. And when the girl brought our food out, she literally dropped it off without saying anything and just left and didn't even tell us which dish was which. Literally, the whole night, we didn't know how our server was, up until this day, I still don't know who our server was. She never came out and introduce herself or anything like that at all. We got cold shoulder treatments throughout the whole dining experience, and that made our dining experience not enjoyable at all. Enough with the horrible service, now on to the food. It was ridiculously overpriced and super small portions. We got the garlic noodles and it tasted nothing like garlic noodles. It tasted like plain noodles with oil mixed in, we had to keep adding soy sauce in order for it to have to taste. Their udon came in a tiny little bowl with nothing in it except the udon noodles and soup, and trust me, it was over $10 for that bowl. I could easily get a bowl of flavorful pho that will actually fill me up for the same price or even less. Their sushi didn't taste fresh at all. I would not go back or recommend this place to anyone at all. We paid over $135 for a meal that didn't fill any of us up, not only that, service was horrible. This place is just poorly managed and servers are just rude overall. We even asked the host who our server was and she said she'd talk to our server and she still never came out to our table.

At the end of Pier 39, and on the top level, you have a view of the golden gate bridge, and Alcatraz. The restaurant is clean and provides a nice dining atmosphere. Service was a bit slow, and the only time we saw our sever was at the start of the meal, and at the end when I called for a check. \n\nFor the food, my wife had the teriyaki salmon bento plate. The salmon was a small piece, and the rice was overcooked (mushy). We were also surprised at getting charged $5 for a bowl of green tea that was not even loose leave (a cheap brand tea bag just dropped into it). I suppose they had to make up the cost of the rent some how. The rest was just OK, nothing to write home about. \n\nI ordered sushi. First off, the soft shell crab was chilled, meaning it had been fried earlier, and sat around until they made it to order. Not very appealing at all. Second, many of the lighter sushi should be served with a vinegar based sauce as the heaver soy sauce will overwhelm the taste of the fish. They did not provide the sauce on the side nor did they make the sushi with this. However, there was very little flavor to the sushi in any case. It didn't taste old, just not much flavor at all to the fish. The saba did have a very strong vinegar taste and at $5 was quite expensive for a cut of fish that's easily the cheapest on any sushi menu (I wonder now why I even ordered it at that price). \n\nI only give it 2 stars (and not 1) because they didn't do anything really so bad. I think you have to expect this kind of quality from a tourist location such as Pier 39. Won't go back, but we were curious about this location as it's a well known name for sushi, I'm disappointed they would associate their name with this establishment.", "author": "Tadas P."}

I arrived at Pier 39 and was so desperately hungry for healthy food and decided to try out Hana Zen. My crave lead to this amazing sushi restaurant. As my friends and I were looking at what kind of sushi they had in store and the pricing provided outside of the restaurant. It was perfect. It was a good pricing for a great restaurant. You are greeted with wonderful hostess and they took you into this beautiful restaurant. The restaurant had a really nice view because you're at the edge of the pier and you can see The Golden Gate bridge and the beautiful seals. It's a really nice view and you can see the beautiful sunset over the bridge. The restaurant designs and placing of the tables and chairs also made the view better. It was a contemporary restaurant. \n\nNow onto the food. It was really good my friends agree that this place was good and worth your taste buds. I ordered a Hana Zen roll and a Kamikaze roll. Both of them were delicious and it didn't take long for both of them to arrive. We were a group of about 8 people and the food didn't take long to come out. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. The owner was really nice too. He would come by and check on us if we needed something. \n\nOverall a wonderful experience! A great view, spectacular service, and good sushi!", "author": "Maivy N."}

We made it just before sunset and admired Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz from our seats. I don't actually think there is a really bad seat in the whole place, as each table faces the windows for a panoramic view of the bay. \n\nLike other reviewers, I have to agree that the service was a little sluggish. However, the service we did receive was exceptional. Each person was nice and polite, visiting each time with a smile and ready to provide what you need. \n\nThe hot food seemed way overpriced, so we opted for a few basic and special rolls and vegetable tempura. At first glance, every thing on the sushi menu seemed to be fried, crunchy, or covered in something fried. We ordered the kamikaze roll with yellowtail, rock n' roll, Lion King roll (with raw salmon, instead of baked salmon on top), and the Hana Zen roll. Each were well-rolled, a good ratio of each ingredient (i.e. not a mouthful of rice), and fresh. The tempura was alright. The batter wasn't crispy enough, but there was a good variety of veggies. \n\nThe owners were actually Japanese, which is a good sign. I was disappointed that we were charged $3.50 for green tea from a tea bag. For a legitimate Japanese restaurant, I would expect that they could provide real green tea brewed from real green tea leaves. They wouldn't be breaking the bank if they brewed tea right. Even worse, we were charged for \"Numi Organic\" tea, when we were actually served something cheap. \n\nThis place could have five stars if they didn't skimp on the brewing proper tea that they charge for and if they could pick up the service.", "author": "NickJess S."}

When we walked in we asked to be seated at the sushi bar (I like to watch them make it) but the hostess told us that there were only 3 seats and they were taken so we took a table instead. The table they sat us at was ok it was by the empty sushi bar that the hostess just told me was full. The view are beautiful from this restaurant but the service is just way to slow. It took about 15 mins to get my cocktail and for our rolls it took about 30 mins to receive. Mind you this place was not busy at all. As for the food, the presentation was nice but I've tasted better sushi else where. When the waitress finally came to our table to ask if we would like anything else we told her we would like to order more rolls. almost 45 mins goes by before she brought us one of the 2 rolls we ordered, we waited and waited for the 2nd roll until I finally was just ready to leave. As we flag her down for our bill she brings us the 2nd roll expecting us to eat it and pay for it. I asked her to just take it off and return the roll were ready to leave. To get the final bill took 20 mins. The restaurant itself is really nice and the views are so beautiful but the service is just not up to par.

The appearance of the restaurant was really nice and the view was amazing. As far as the food and service goes, not so good. We sat at one of the tables in the bar area just a few feet from the front door. To start off, the hostess did not even walk us to the table she just pointed. And we had to ask for a menu from our waiter. My husband ordered garlic fries which came out fast because when we received them they were just regular fries with nothing on them. I ordered one philly roll which was about the circumference of a quarter. The avocado in the role was already brown! My husband being the champ that he is, ate the roll and ordered me another one because he didn't want to make a fuss about it. And the same thing with the second order small and browned avocado. During this time the waiter never came and asked us how we were doing or if the food was ok. He also didn't fill our waters once the whole time we were there.

The hostess greeted us immediately and we were seated at a table for two next to a window looking out at the ocean and Alcatraz. Everything seemed to go very well until moments later. Our table wasn't leveled; making it rock a little back and forth between us, but we didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nThen our server came and she seemed very nice. I ordered the lunch special of chicken teriyaki w/ tempura and he had the beef teriyaki and we both had a sprite. Some minutes went by and we were given our miso soup and it was quite nice. It was warm; which I found odd because I'm used to my miso soup being piping hot =T Then the entree seemed to take so much longer and were finally given our plates. Sadly, the proportions on my plate were so off. I've ordered this dish countless times at other places and received way more chicken pieces for so much cheaper! I was only given 5-6 small pieces and way more tempura. The rice in the bowl was white and fluffy; just enough stickiness for my liking and the dipping on the side for the tempura was unmemorable. I think it was overpriced for what you should get. My bf had way more meat on his plate and he thought it was just ok.\nEven my sprite had an odd aftertaste after some time went by -_-\"\n\nFinally we were done and wanted to leave asap to explore the pier and waited until our server came by to check up on us. I realized that our server never came by to check how we were doing unless we called her or to drop off something. The restaurant wasn't busy at all. There were maybe 5 other tables eating and 3-4 people on staff. I think that's pretty reasonable balance to cater to each table equally, don't you? The servers were clearly bored by just standing around the bar chatting it up when finally one of them saw me raise my hand and told our server to come over -_-\"\n\nI asked for the check and minutes later delivered it. I brought out my card and put it in the folder and waited AGAIN for her to pick it up. 5 minutes roll by and I told my bf to call her over so that I can wash my hands in the bathroom and freshen up. I spent a few minutes in there and came back seeing our bill STILL on the table. We had enough and he eventually GOT UP AND GAVE HER THE BILL. She dropped out a few minutes later and I laughed when I saw the \"recommended tip\" of 15%! In my opinion, she didn't deserve anywhere close to what was recommended, but just gave $3.\n\nLousy service, raise your game up Hana Zen!

Yes, it is a pretty conventional Japanese American restaurant.  Yes, you should only order dishes that are \"safe\" (don't get the chawanmushu, for example, it was prepared entirely wrong).  But if you understand where you are, in the heart of tourist central, with a view that mesmerizes, the price of their dishes are really quite reasonable, considering how much they probably have to pay to rent there.  Factor in absolutely friendly servers and perfectly decent and fresh food (their lamb \"popsicles\" and negihama were the standouts from our meal tonight) and they got just the right combination for us.  Yes, we're fans!!", "author": "Yvette F."}

Our server Miguel was very knowledgable and quick to serve, always with a smile. And the food was absolutely delicious, my favorites being the Dragon & Lion King rolls. \nThis restaurant has amazing food, friendly staff and unbeatable views.

Yesterday I had a party of 11 come in for my birthday. My birthday dinner was ruined, first of all it took an hour  and a half for most of our food to come. Once we finally got our food those of us who did get our food it was cold. Second of all my husband and two of my friends never even got their food. Third: our waitress did not even check in with us at all we had to track her down to ask about the 3 orders missing. She apologized and said that the cooks forgot... Really? And let me tell you that when we got seated and ordered it wasn't busy in there at all! So we ended up canceling those orders that never came. We will never ever go back and I do not recommend this place to anyone. And apparently we weren't the only ones waiting long.... A couple sitting next to our group I over heard them saying it was taking so long for something so simple that they had ordered.  they gave us a \"discount\" which was basically no tax.", "author": "Adela R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-18", "description": "I wrote a review of this place a couple of years ago when it was fairly new. I gave it four stars then. I don't know if this \"update\" will replace my original review. I'd taken exception then to the deployment of numerous flatscreen TV's mounted around the room, suggesting that maybe Hana Zen wanted to be a Sports Bar. But the food was excellent then and I've dined there several times in the meantime. But I really need to write about this most recent visit. I arranged a friend's birthday luncheon ( party of ten) with manager Fusai who really did a bang-up job. A couple of ladies have ambulation problems (walker, cane) and Fusai was able to arrange for us to have our cab drive us through security and drop us off at the restaurant. The restaurant, you may know, is located all the way at the back of Pier 39. It's got to be a quarter mile from the front curb. And Fusai arranged for a lovely birthday dessert for the birthday girl. Additionally, Fusai personally greeted our group very graciously. We were all impressed. Good job, Fusai!", "author": "Paula H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-29", "description": "Pier 39 is one of those monumental tourist traps where bad restaurants can stay in business for a long time because they don't have to worry about that pesky problem of getting repeat business. There are always new unsuspecting tourists ready to take the bait. Well, with that in mind, Hana Zen is above average. The view is fantastic. This restaurant has the best perch on the end of Pier 39, with the best views of Alcatraz and Angel Island. I happen to work in the area, and I've gone a few times with coworkers. Fortunately they have a 30% discount for locals on Thursdays, which brings their prices down to reasonable. The food is below average for Japanese food in SF - uninspired, inauthentic, but still completely edible. It's the kind of place where  tourists from Flyover Country would go, and proudly report that they've had \"real Japanese food\". We locals know we can do better. I'll probably be back sometime with my coworkers, but only on discount day.", "author": "Aaron F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-17", "description": "Good Sushi, great service.  \n\nSO, the first time I wanted to come here, it was for my date's birthday.  I called and made reservations about a week in advance for a Saturday night.  They called me back during the week to let me know that they were having a 100 person party that night, and to see if i still wanted to keep my reservations.  I said Yes, oblivious to the obvious hinting that she wanted my ass out of there.  But, we wanted sushi that night, and it was the only sushi spot at the pier, it was perfect, so i was adamant about that reservation, and kept it .  She called me back a couple days later to tell me that the 100 person party was a private party and that we wouldn't be able to eat there that night.  I was kind of annoyed because the previous call I had asked her questions like \"yea, we'll keep it.. do u think it will affect our service?\"  and , \"Is it OK with you guys?\"  , which in hindsight i realize she was totally passive aggressive about.  Anyways, i was like \"thanks\"... for nothing, but didn't say that, and I had to make new reservations a couple of days before her birthday at a different spot--- ZUSHI PUZZLE, which btw was amazing.  Even though i was super stoked to try out Hana Zen, i had made the decision to never go there after they kinda P***ed out on telling me that I couldn't hold my reservations.  \n\nHowever, they took the initiative to call me back, and tell me they were very sorry, and that if i ever went back there they would \"definitely treat us to something special\" and give 20% off.  20% off!!!! That was awesome because it totally made me want to go there now.  \n\nSO, my date and I went there on New Year's Eve (we had reservations again, in which I explained to them about my 20% deal), and we were seated next to the window.  Great view!! \n\nNow onto the food... we ordered a dragon roll (pretty good), the 49er roll (topped with salmon and lemon slices)  -- i thought this one was excellent, and the cherry blossom roll which was also very good.\nThe best roll by far was the Sunset Strip (albacore tuna, tuna, and salmon wrapped in cucumber!!)  It was super fresh, and light, and just damn tasty.  I like that kind of stuff.  Our waitress was very courteous... great service over all.  The lady i talked to when i called in and explained the whole part of this story to said she would leave a note next to our reservation, so i was kinda banking on that fact, so i wouldnt have to ask for the 20% discount again.  \n\nHowever, when we got our bill, they didn't take the 20% discount off.  ahh... so i walked up to the front and asked them again, she was super sorry blah blah blah, and they got me a new bill.  20% off!! cool!! ... except i pretty much had to beg them for that ish.    I probably would give one more star if they would have remembered, and really given me that \"special treatment\", we were expecting some dessert or something bc they offered that when i first made reservations for the birthday.  Still good deal though for both sides.  Because they got a sale from someone who wouldn't have gone there, and I got a cool 20% off.  Safe to say, I won't be going back there, but i had a good experience.  I won't be going back there because the sushi was just pretty good.. nothing great or worth going back imo.  Great service, nice waitresses.", "author": "Steve K."}

(cash bills are the changes for the table next to ours.) \n\nThe food is slightly above-average, comparing to Japantown, definitely not the best Japanese food in town.  Not sure if it is worth 5-star like most previous reviews.  Would recommend deep-fried oyster, $12 for half a dozen, a good buy.  The hot tea is not cheap, $4 something for a pot.\n\nThe price is about 10~20% higher than Japantown but not completely out of whack.  \n\nThe bottom-line is nothing special except for the view.", "author": "Ying L."}

You have to walk through the mayhem all the way to the end of the pier to get there, but it's worth it.  Once inside, there weren't any kids crying or parents yelling, just simple ambiance and killer views of the bay, Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz.  Folks at the bar were watching the game and others were enjoying lunch.  We had a lunch of the Zen's Sushi Combo and the Ten Zaru Soba.  Both were good.  Nothing remarkable.  Until dessert.  We had the flourless chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and the green tea ice cream.  Both were incredible!  Killer chocolate cake and the coconut ice cream was rich and creamy.  Green tea ice cream is a passion for me and this one was unique.  Very floral and creamy.  Prices seemed a little high, but the view made it worth it.\nA great place to some have drinks and watch the game with a (protected)view of the bay.", "author": "Monica S."}

The location is on pier 39 & the view from where we sat was wonderful. The decoration was modern & nice. The service was a little below average. The server came to our table twice, to take our orders & to serve our food. He never came by to ask for drink refills and the restaurant was not that busy at all. The food was average, salmon teriyaki was a little fishy & their tempura batter was not crispy at all. It was a little soft & cold when served.  I hate to be critical, but their rice was a little too soggy. I mean, how can a Japanese restaurant mess up the simplest item. Their price is definitely above the average & BTW, they charge for a green tea by the pot. Their description of the tea sounds wonderful, making you think that you are getting loose tea leaves, but instead, they serve you tea packet where you can purchase at store for $2.00 a box versus $4.75 for 1 tea packet in a pot. On the up note, their california roll was good. My husband had their sashimi & he said that their raw fish was not as fresh as he hoped & compared to other sushi restaurants.", "author": "Jackie D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-15", "description": "For a place with easy access to fresh sea food the meal I had here was very disappointing. They had quite a few more tempura rolls than anything else, which in my experience means the sushi is sub-par and they are trying to cover it up by frying it.  I was with a friend who is a sushi newbie so I tried to order some easy rolls.  We ordered potstickers, a crunchy California roll,  a kamikaze roll, a spicy tuna roll and a lion king roll. Although the menu states crab as an ingredient in many of the rolls, our server informed us that they actually had imitation crab in them and that it was a 3 dollar upcharge for real crab. We upgraded the lion king and crunchy California rolls. This meant that we ended up paying $13 for the crunchy California which was basically a deep fried California roll, the lion king roll ended up being almost $17.  I will say that these were the best of the rolls but the fact that both had some part of them deep fried and lots of special sauces made the actual sushi indistinguishable. We got the kamikaze roll roll with yellow tail, it and the spicy tuna were both not great to put it nicely. The potstickers were decent but it is kinda difficult to mess those up. The best thing about the place was its view of the bay. All in all I regretted wasting a vacation lunch on this restaurant when there was such great seafood and sushi at other restaurants nearby. We didn't finish everything we ordered because it was just not good, so when we left we were still hungry and ended up getting some clam chowder at fisherman's wharf.", "author": "Ashley L."}
