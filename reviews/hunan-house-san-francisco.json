Experience included a loud drunk Chinese dude talking at his table like he was at a football match. Chinatown experience also included a large family who only spoke French.\n\nThe food was Chinatown also. Huge hot and spicy shrimp. Yummmmm.  But I started with a hot and sour soup which is very good it also a very generous serving. you know you're at a real deal Chinese restaurant where they have chopsticks on the table and no Fork. But my feelings were hurt when they brought me a fork. But for those who care, I left the table with the fork unused.  But I used like six napkins cleaning my hands after peeling the shrimp.  Did I mention the spicy garlic shrimp was really good.", "author": "Todd C."}

Our finals just finished and we poked our heads into some bars... we had some drinks from Vesuvio, Comstock Saloon, Li Po Cocktail lounge, the Hancock room, and whatever else we went to... but then we got hungry after and so we went here at Hunan House. Needless to say, we came here hungry and slightly drunk.\n\nIt was our first time to try out this place. The setting seemed rather intimate: dimly lit interiors, functional tables that can warm up your soups, not too crowded--just a few bunch of friends or families gathered on their own roundtables. \n\nThey have pretty much their entire menu plastered on their glass wall, which you can see from the outside so that you can decide whether this place is something that interests you, even before you decide on going inside. In my case, I knew from the start that they have some dishes I really like because the pictures outside caught my attention. (LOL)\n\nWe ordered few dishes and all of them were pretty good. What really stood out to me were the OYSTERS. (Omg. Must have.) Get their baked oysters, it was pretty good. We also had their Hunan chicken, which was served with a ginger oil. It tasted nice and decent. I asked for \"mild\" spicy, but it was really spicy for me so apparently their mild is my medium hot. We ordered other dishes but they didn't stand out as much as these two.\n\nMy sis and I were having our girl-talks and those conversations usually go pretty long. I realized that the waitstaff didn't rush us at all. They were nice enough to ask if we wanted them to take pictures of us because my sis and I were taking a bunch of selfies of ourselves. \n\nRequest for fortune cookies after your meal if they didn't automatically give you some. It was an a-OK dining experience!", "author": "Trish P."}

The prices are also aggressively reasonable too.\n\nThings I've had before:\n\nMapo Tofu (5/5) - my favorite standby for lunch here. $8 for a big tray of savory, garlicky, numbing spice tofu? Yes please.\n\nGuilin Rice Noodles (4/5) - generously portioned and super solid as well, though a little blander tasting (which is what Guilin noodles are supposed to be like). I'd say on par with what's offered in the perpetually popular Chong Qing Xiao Mian down the street.\n\nSpicy Numbing Oil on wanton/chicken/beef trip/beef/fish/etc (4/5) - I'd say they all taste similar, and they are all worth your order.\n\nKung Pao Chicken (4/5) - even a boring classic like this is generously portioned and extra flavorful here.\n\nAs I said, the setting is a little limpid and humid and dim, and the waitstaff is a little lazy.

I came here during lunch today and ordered their lunch special which is a variety of plates you can choose from like orange chicken, kungpao chicken, mapo tofu with rice and soup included for an advertised $7.75 per plate. It's a pretty good deal considering how much food you get but the food is practically inedible. I ordered the chongqing chili chicken lunch special which came with the most bitter soup I have ever tried. The chicken came with all of these small bones intact so I had to sieve through each piece to get anything edible out of it, let alone that the chicken was so oversalted it was pretty much unsalvageable. When it came time for the check, I'd been charged $8.75 for my chicken instead of the advertised $7.75. It's not a huge deal for an extra dollar but if you're going to advertise $7.75, then you should stick to it? \n\nSorry to say that I won't be coming back here.

My son was excited to get the Oyster Pancake (as we had just returned from China a few months ago and he LOVED the street pancakes) only to be incredibly disappointed in what tasted like an over cooked omelette with over-sized, overly chewy bits of oyster here and there. I was able to stomach the pepper short-rib, but what we were served was mostly veggies and bone. The pot-stickers were fine, but I would have liked a fresh over frozen taste. The garlic chicken skin was alright but then again, there was barely any meat. I filled up on steamed rice and got a snack about 20 minutes later. The only reason for the second star?

We checked it out for that very reason, a large number of reviews and 4+ stars. What a major disappointment that was. First off, service sucked to be frank. They took forever to even acknowledge us after being seated. The time between ordering our appetizer and meal was at least 30 Minutes. We asked for water twice and it never came. Now for the dishes, we had three. Spicy beef with black bean, Kung pow shrimp and the crispy dungeness crab. The beef was tough and lacked flavor, the kung pow chicken had a tasty sauce but the chicken itself was questionable, and the crab was just extra greasy. The hot tea and pot stickers were actually pretty good. I wouldn't return to this establishment for the previously stated reasons. Do better.", "author": "Nathaniel L."}

Just try to not have them too often!\n\nSometimes I realized that it's pretty hard to find a good place to eat in Chinatown, that's my honest opinion; the restaurants are overrated or have terrible services. This place is not bad. \n\nThe size of the restaurant is not that big, about 20 tables. I went on a weekday night and it was packed with people, no wait though. The atmosphere is a little bit dark with a few spot lights on tables. \n\nThey have the option of hotpot and/or just regular dining. I am not going to talk about how spicy it is because everyone handles spiciness differently, but I was fine with most dishes. \n\nJalapenos with Preserved Eggs (5/5) $5.95- In case you didn't know, preserved eggs are preserved in a mixture of different ingredients for at least a month and they usually have a very strong taste with slight acidic aftertaste. This is a cold appetizer with house-made spicy garlic sauce. It's so good! Everything is good with garlic though. \n\nChong Qing Chicken with Explosive Peppers (3/5) $7.95-Not bad overall. They used chicken wings for this dish, I don't quite like how they cut the chicken wings in small chunks, because that gives small pieces of bones from the cut. So, watch out. I think it was too salty with just a little too much MSG.\n\nNonetheless, most dishes are spicy, so they do put a lot of chili as well as chili oil. I suggest  not drinking cold water while eating oily food. It is always good to pair spicy foods with white rice. \n\nBottom line, I would visit again.", "author": "Tammy C."}

Maybe too many thick ass stems but not a big deal.\n3) Szechuan spicy cold noodle - amazing numbing peppery sesame paste goodness.  noodles weren't quite al dente but still yummy and better than most places.  \n4) egg white tofu with mixed mushrooms - loved it, egg tofu is my fav.  Crushing it.\n5) explosive chili chicken - chicken had the perfect amount of light breading, more numbing pepper and super juicy.  Had the option to choose with bones or without - an unexpected nice option.\n\nDef check this place out.  Doesn't seem like it gets super packed but its only 2 months old.

It was definitely not as good. The bitter melon was not as fresh as the first time, had little flavor, was rubbery on texture, and lukewarm when served. \n\nTwo of us also ordered ong choy with fermented bean paste. This was served hot. But is always better with chili fermented bean paste, which would have given it more flavor. \n\nWon ton soup was thin skinned and fresh filling but the filling was distractingly salty, compared to everything else which could have used salt to counter bland. Texture was good. \n\nHunan eggplant was served hot and cooked to proper cloud texture, but salvor was too sweet. Almost like candy. Was expecting a savory dish. \n\nSalt and pepper prawns were the worst of the bunch. Could tell by the off-putting smell. Old. As if frozen for way too long in an old freezer and absorbed the bad smells. Taste proved no hint of salt or pepper in the batter this has was a light texture but probably fried in grease that should have been changed out. To top it off, it was way overcooked and not hot in temperature. Haven't had shrimp that bad in a very long time. It was not edible. \n\nMedicinal jello was fine. \n\nSeparate orders of white rice were dry and lukewarm. Even the tea was bitter. \n\nBleh. \n\nMaybe this place is better or more consistent with Schezuan cuisine. Maybe we had a bad cook who wasn't good with timing and didn't taste the food.\n\nWas really looking forward to a repeat of last year's bitter melon dish and ended up disappointed in multiple ways. Not a pleasant meal. And each dish runs about $10 at a minimum. \n\nWe did notice people eating a fresh Schezuan whole catfish dish that is $30-40. Maybe we should have ordered that instead, for a better meal and cheaper. \n\nService was slow but they were nice if you could get their attention. No one ever made an effort to check in and ask how things were. Close your menu so they know you're ready to order. \n\nPhotos of nearly everything on a menu helps. And the have a vast menu. But offering such a diversity defeats the purpose if you can't keep quality control over freshness of product. \n\nWith so many other great options in Chinatown, we may not give this place another chance for a while. For $50-$70 I expect a hot, fresh, tasty meal. A fast food chain would have been more satiating--and we hate fast food.", "author": "Spire S."}

It morphed to Meng Kee, a popular SF chain known for their \" 3 dishes for $20.00\" special;  they were obviously a bang for bucks place; they tried doing an AYCE hot pot menu which wasn't bad, but the protein quality often reflected the price.\nAfter a long hiatus, this restaurant opened mid-September and, fearing it would be more of the same (cheap food, cheap quality).  Walking in to grab a takeout menu, I was surprised with the remodel job they did.  The y added booths to the right and moved the cashier area to the front.  They added track lighting and the redo gives it a classier feel.\nI finally tried them on a recent weekday, phoning in my order.

The flavor they packed was out of this world! It renewed my lost faith in a good spring roll. The green onion was just right in its crispy texture, but soft on the inside.

I told him I would not be having that conversation with him if I had actually gotten a whole lobster, but I didn't get the tail part to my lobster. The manager practically called me a liar about me not getting my whole lobster. The food lacked flavor too. I will definitely NOT BE  REFERRING NO ONE HERE! And to top it all off I witness a waitress wearing gloves go in to the restroom, use it and walked out instantly after flushing still wearing the same gloves she went in with.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-13", "description": "My family and I were desperately searching for some good Chinese food after a less than favorable experience eating Chinese food outside of Chinatown the day before.  We were a bit concerned about the balance between landing in a tourist haven and perhaps finding a Chinese restaurant that was a bit too \"authentic\" for our tastes (and our non-adventurous kids in tow!).  Hunan House fit the bill perfectly.  \n\nWe started with the not-so-authentic deep fried spring rolls, which my 15 year old son eats as one of his primary food groups.  There's not much you can say about spring rolls, but these were crispy on the outside, with a steamy vegetable filling, and a light sweet-sour dipping sauce that wasn't too thick.  About as good as you can get for spring rolls.  Next course was the Shanghai dumplings.  Wow!  These plump pillows of pork-filled bliss were some of the best I've had.  They were accompanied by a slightly vinegary deep purple dipping sauce which I've never had before, but it was a perfect pairing with the dumplings.  Both of our picky kids gobbled these up in short order.\n\nOur main courses were typical Americanized Chinese food - orange chicken and ginger-scallion beef.  But they were both perfectly prepared with fresh ingredients.  The orange chicken was a light, crispy fried breast meat with not too much and not too little orange sauce - no sign of gloppy, greasy orange chicken chunks in sight!  The ginger scallion beef ingredients were fresh and well prepared - perhaps a bit bland but nothing that a bit of hot chili oil couldn't fix.\n\nEven the side of white rice was good.  The right mix of stickiness so you could eat it with chopsticks if you wanted.\n\nThe only (minor) complaint was that the service was a bit slow - we waited 15 minutes after being seated for the waitress to come take our order, and then when we were done eating we finally gave up waiting for the waitress to come by and clear our table and give us the check.  We just went to the front cash register and paid and it wasn't a big deal, all things considered.", "author": "Jeff F."}

I'm not sure if they dumbed it down because we're white, but it wasn't that spicy, just super flavorful with a little back burn. Great balance of broth, noodles, veg & just a little meat. Way better than I expected! \n\n* Shanghai Dumplings - Soupy, flavorful yummy dumplings.  A classic, and they did them justice\n\n* Lamb Ribs - Fatty, unctuous, and just a bit spicy.  Lots of garlic.  I love lamb, so I expected to be happy, but my friend is a bit more meh about lamb and she was super impressed.  I want to make these at home! \n\nThe only draw back to the place was that it took them a really long time to take our order and get us our check.

Once we were out at a table the server never asked us if we wanted a drink. We had to ask 3 times for some water. Once the food came it just got worse. The sweet and sour chicken was hands down the worst I have ever had. The chicken was cooked but was hard. The vegetables were not cooked at all. My wife requested brown rice with her meal and was given white rice. The meals do not come with rice and you are forced to purchase some. The rice was so so. The chicken in the rice was also not that good.  The \"egg roll\" appetizer is actually spring rolls. They are not bad but also they are 100% not egg rolls.

A hostess gestured toward the tables, telling us to sit anywhere. The tables were pre-set with plates, chop sticks, tea cups, and menus. Immediately, after we sitting, a fresh pot of tea was brought, though we hadn't ordered it. The menu is large, though not exhaustive, and it includes a photo for almost every offering. Some entrees included foods that might give even a fairly adventurous diner, such as myself, pause. But there was a great variety to choose from. We ordered the Dry Fried Green Beans (I've never tried a green bean dish at a Chinese restaurant that I did not love, though they all differ from one another), Mongolian Beef, and Spicy Chicken with jalape\u00f1o. My one and only complaint is that the time we waited to give our order was very long, though the restaurant was not busy. We closed our menus and kept our phones out of sight to signal the wait staff that we were ready, but it took an unusually long time to get the attention of a server. They were very courteous, and I would not hesitate to return. The meals were wonderful, and the green beans were possibly my favorite of any I've ever had. Leftovers were just as delicious cold the next day. The sauces retained their consistency, did not become gluey, and the vegetables were still tender-crisp.", "author": "Diane P."}

It took a while for our food to come out because they were busy (it was a Saturday) but it was well worth the wait. The portion sizes were good and the food was well prepared.

I had:\n\nHot and Sour soup: perfect blend of hot and sour, not too salty and the \"small\" was enough for two people. \n\nChicken Pot Stickers: Classically done with a tasty pepper sauce and great flavor.\n\nKung pao chicken with rice: Spicy but with a lot of other great flavors too and, happily had plenty of chicken as well as vegetables--a good balance. They also gave a lot of it--again, you could share it with another person and it would be enough. \n\nOverall, a great place to grab lunch or dinner. I highly recommend it. The prices here are reasonable too. For two appetizers, a side of rice, a main dish and two drinks, the totally was just over $20 which is a pretty affordable meal for 2 people.", "author": "Sara S."}

To be honest it looked clean, and we liked how pictures were posted outside of the  window displaying different dishes from  their menu. When we walked in we were seated immediately and given menus, the lady who sat us walked away and took her apron off and sat in a booth to eat .The menu has a lot of variety to choose from! We were waiting and waiting to be acknowledged by someone who works there and nothing. The restaurant wasn't busy, we looked around for someone or at least to make eye contact with someone. Nothing. We waited a good 15 minutes, only reason why we waited that long was because we were thirsty, from all the walking and hungry! Staff actually walked by us and didn't once make eye contact with us . I finally started putting my purse around my shoulder getting ready to leave when someone finally came to us! We ordered our waters. The waitress got us waters and walked away . A few minutes later she came back and took our orders. She was extremely rude, when I asked her specifically what the hot pot meal comes with she stared at me blankly, then pointed at the menu without saying anything and sighing . I told her that each section has a \" meat , vegetable , broth etc \" all I wanted to know is if we could choose from each section or if we could only choose a certain amount . She rolled her eyes and told me we could choose 5. I told her I didn't know and the menu didn't say which is why I asked . She didn't say anything or smile . She took our orders while in between taking a huge sigh.\n\nThe food came , it was good. The waitress never came to check on us, only to give us the check that my boyfriend requested. While we were eating , a gentleman who was a customer went to the front asking for water. The waitress we had told him she was getting them water. The customer  told the waitress   \" You told us that a long time ago and have not once come back to check on us or bring us water.\" \n\nWhen my boyfriend and I heard that, it validated our feelings of frustration too with the service. After eating at the restaurant I looked up reviews and found out others too had similar experiences with bad service.\n\nWe will never come back here again!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

The place is roomy (although when I was there it was empty so this may not be accurate), and the atmosphere is decent. One major problem we experienced was the strong scent of cigarette smoke that was present the entire time. The food was very good with the garlic noodles and broccoli especially standing out. The prices were very appropriate for the portions of the food. The portions were pretty large, with three or four shared dishes easily filling a family of four heavy eaters. This is good as the food is pretty greasy. The location of this restaurant is very nice as it gives access to authentic oriental shops and stores. Speaking of authentic, most of the food reflects this perfectly, with frogs and intestines being available, but if you like classics like Mongolian beef and orange chicken you won't be lost.", "author": "Saif Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-08", "description": "I've only eaten here once so far, but it was a very good meal.  The restaurant is smallish, with a fairly simple, classy look.  The service was good, if a bit stiff, but they are only months old and still settling in I think - as soon as I made some small talk the smiles came out - overall service was fast and relatively attentive.  We were craving spicy on a dreary, Fall day and had Ma Po Tofu, Hot and Sour Soup and Explosive Fish.  All three were indeed spicy (the fish had a bed of at least fifty peppers!), and were among the best I've had, including Asia - all were intensely flavored with layers of spicy, numbing goodness from the peppers and peppercorns.  I can't wait to go back as the menu is large and has some pretty exotic items (frog, sea cucumbers, etc.) - well, maybe not, but kidding aside, some really appealing sounding dishes.  Beer is served in tall, iced glasses, which never hurts either.  The clientele when we were there, on a Sunday afternoon, were local Chinatown, local SF, and some tourists, so a nice mix, with quite a few Asian locals coming in for take out while we were there as well.  I have no doubt most folks would have a great meal here, particularly if they're looking for truly spicy.", "author": "Caelum S."}
