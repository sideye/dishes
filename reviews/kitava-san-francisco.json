Since waiting outside in the cold didn't seem particularly enticing, we instead walked to Kitava after doing a quick search on Yelp for gf/df options nearby. So glad we did! We were able to get a seat immediately, though there were enough people in the place to give off a good dinner time vibe. The first thing I noticed was how friendly the staff was. Like honestly they seemed like genuinely good people. We ordered the grass-fed beef meatballs in pesto sauce, the cubano bowl, a turmeric almond milk drink, green tea, and, for dessert, a brownie and an almond cookie.\n\nThe meatball dish felt like a home cooked meal that I didn't know I needed. It was so warming and tasty. Rich but not over the top. Simple flavors but blended nicely together. The cubano bowl (which wasn't mine but I had a little) had really nice pulled pork. Not at all greasy which can be hard to find. Both dishes were super filling and generously portioned. I think the brownie was probably tastier earlier in the day, but to be fair we ordered it at 8:30 pm, half an hour before closing. The almond cookie was really good and I'd definitely get it again. The turmeric drink was delicious and the green tea was as expected, green tea.\n\nSo yeah, all in all a great experience. I'll definitely return!", "author": "Tiffany S."}

Despite the fancy sustainable hipster motif, it's not that pricey (for San Francisco) with most mains between $13-$15.  It's not vegan raw healthy, but it feels like cleaner eating than a carby burrito or slice of pizza nearby.\n\nPesto Meatballs: Labeled as a \"small plate\", it's definitely smaller than a meal but much more substantive than an appetizer.  Really liked the tasty and warm pesto.  The ground meat was surprisingly yummy for ground meat, like they used a lot of nice spices and herbs.\n\nGeneral Tso's Chicken: Ok, it's nothing like the sticky sweet and spicy General Tso's Chicken one would find at a Chinese-American joint.  It's more like nice chunks of chicken covered in a light and very crispy batter.  There happens to be a not-sticky-at-all sauce on the side that mainly tastes like soy and vinegar.  The rice was fluffy and had some of that light sauce mixed in it.  The large chunks of steamed broccoli were the only boring part.", "author": "Adam B."}

The proces are steep but the ingredients are high quality.\n\nThe restaurant is more like a cafe setting since there are communal tables. It's a good place to get delivery/take out from as well. It's located near the 16th Street BART station in the Mission so a fairly easy location to find. \n\nThe menu consists of lots of bowl options like the Baja Bowl, Cuban Bowl, and you can also mix and match 1 protein and 2 sides. The Zoodles & Meatballs and General Tso's Chicken are delicious and popular.\n\nI got the Mix & Match with salmon, turmeric cauliflower rice and brussels sprouts and it came out to $19 which was pretty expensive.

I would have liked to have more options (and am willing to pay more for it) available in their dishes. The zucchini noodle dish for instance is just zucchini, sauce and basil (with the option to add mushroom or meat). The Cuban bowl seemed to have more variety in it but the day I was there they were out of beans. \n\nThe space is clean and decor is nice for a fast sit down meal.

What I loved more, though, was the chicken. The breading was thick and crispy, and the chicken meat was juicy and tender. However, the cauliflower rice tasted way too overwhelming. Imo, there was way too much turmeric and ginger for me to enjoy the cauli-rice on its own. But when paired with the chicken, it tasted a little better.\n\nOverall, I love this place, because it's a healthy, fast-casual joint conveniently located across the 16th and Mission Bart station.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-09", "description": "Overview: Kitava is a clean, modern, health-conscious, gluten-free, medium sized, spacious, sit down (but serve yourself) restaurant that opened in 2017 located in the heart of the Mission District on 16th and Mission on the east side of the BART station that replaced the McDonalds there.\n\nThe Food: About half of the menu items here are a variant of a grain-bowl or a salad bowl, consisting of a protein such as pork shoulder, chicken, or salmon atop a mix of white rice, legumes, vegetables, and avocado. There isn't a specific ethnicity that Kitava adheres to and you can get options from the \"Cuban Bowl\" that adds plantains, to meatballs/zucchini, to General Tso's chicken, to the house salad which consists of spinach, arugula, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, and avocado. Prices for an average meal range from about $14-16 and portions are on the heartier side.\n\nIn general you will feel good about eating at Kitava as most of the foods served here are traditionally thought of as being healthy and many of their ingredients are organic and locally sourced. On the flip side, Kitava still serves white rice, plantains, fried chicken, and a variety of desserts so to me their vision seems kind of diluted. For example, their Cuban bowl is 871 calories (300 more than a Big Mac), and 47% of your daily sodium content. The Zoodles+Meatballs (for 3 meatballs) is 520 calories, 77% of your daily sodium content. I do get the impression that Kitava is catering more to people on fad diets. \n\nAs for how the food tastes, it's a little low on the flavor, and most dishes are fairly simple. The meats specifically are a bit dry and I found myself needing to incorporate a little chunk of plantain into every bite of my Cuban bowl because the rest of the bowl was on the bland side.\n\nConclusions: Kitava is a wonderful addition to the Mission neighborhood and I hope that it thrives. If you like the idea of local ingredients, simple bowls, clean, spacious interiors, and hate the idea of gluten, Kitava is a perfect place for lunch with a date or a small group.", "author": "Andrew H."}

It's lightly spicy with a nice sweet and sour kick and it really elevates the dish and makes it taste that much better.\n\nI'll have to come back and try their other concoctions, you can get things with cauliflower rice!

I saw at the top of their online menu that everything was Soy/Dairy/Wheat/Yadda Yadda free and said \"Yep this is the one\".\n\nIt's right across from 16th & Mission BART so very centrally-located and was easy to get to. The atmosphere is very chill, casual, and relaxing with the order at the counter/seat yourself/bus your own table flow which is gaining so much popularity here in SF (a whole other conversation). Also sharing tables with strangers is definitely somewhat expected just because it's a small place with lots of chairs at each space to eat. This must be a newer business cause the bathroom looks like it was still being set up and you have to super hulk strength one of the stall doors in the women's bathroom to get it to close.\n\nEverything was well-priced and super delicious! I came with two people and we all ordered different things and tried each other's stuff.\n\nBrussel sprouts + aioli were a nice thing to munch on, I loved how crispy they were. It's hard to mess up brussel sprouts, imo.\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken was not to be missed, what a great take on a classic. I love that they use coconut aminos for the sauce instead of soy. We ordered this w cauliflower \"rice\" instead of the jasmine rice and were pleased that this was even an option (it's like they really know their audience or something~).\n\nThe meatloaf and mashed sweet potatoes were also very good, I've never had sweet potato that tastes so similar to your expected mashed white potatoes. They were savory and delicious.\n\nThe spaghetti squash bolognese w/ beef was soooo satisfying. My boyfriend didn't want to get this at first (which I understand, cause like yeah, spaghetti squash subbing in for actual pasta is almost like carob pretending to be chocolate) but it was very rich and flavor-complex and I kept bugging him by saying \"and you didn't want to get this one!

I love good food but sometimes I want a clean meal for balance.\n\nThe last time I tried a very restrictive, health-oriented eatery, I never wanted to look at a vegan, gluten free, lo-carb, no sugar meal again. Don't get me wrong, vegan can be good but this particular place made steamed broccoli for life seem more appealing. \n\nAnd, then I read Eater SF's article: \"Mission McD's Reborn as Gluten-Free, Paleo Restaurant\": http://bit.ly/2iReSAn. GF, paleo friendly chicken nuggets, french fries, and sweet & sour sauce?! I'm so there! \n\nOk, I can't be the only one who misread the misleading title. I mean, if McD was going to reborn into anything \"health-conscious\", it's first location would definitely be in the hipster Mission. \n\nSorry, to disappoint McD fans but taking over the vacant McD space is Kitava is paleo friendly, fast-casual restaurant that's free from dairy, corn, soy, peanuts, refined sugar and oils. Meats are grass fed and pastured.\n\nOn the menu are small plates (butternut squash hummus, pesto meatballs), salads, bowls (Cuban bowl, zoodles & meatballs, General tso's chicken) and sweets (brownie, cookies, ice cream sandwich). \n\nLike most new eateries in the city, it's not cheap but not insanely expensive either. A bowl and a brownie was about $25 including tip. Not an everyday type of place I can afford to go to for lunch but Kitava is THE place to go to when you're seeking a tasty meal that's makes you feel good about yourself. \n\nThey also offer delivery through UberEATS, DoorDash, and GrubHub.\n\nI ordered at the counter with the very friendly cashier and my meal was ready within minutes. \n\nFor lunch, I choose the Cuban Bowl ($14) w/ heritage pork shoulder, plantains, avocado, kale slaw, cilantro-garlic mojo sauce, cauliflower rice & sunflower risotto (+$2): http://bit.ly/2mnkLu4.\n\nThis was a very filling bowl with a good ratio of proteins and fiber. \n\nThe pork shoulder was fantastic - slow cooked and very tender. Much better than nearby Media Noche's rendition. Mojo sauce added a great acidity and the plantains had a nice caramelized sweetness. I love heat and each table had a bottle of housemade tangy habanero sauce. It wasn't too hot so don't worry. \n\nI wasn't too keen on the cauliflower rice (very cabbagey with a bitter aftertaste) and sunflower risotto (like oatmeal). They do have pink Himalayan sea salt on each table that will probably help neutralize the cauliflower rice but I didn't use it. Personally, I like a more neutral flavor you get with regular rice but that's just my AZN side. Next time, I would just do all kale slaw or the white rice & beans option. \n\nI've had my fair share of terrible, GF desserts so I was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty the Dark Chocolate Brownie ($4): http://bit.ly/2zDpi0g was.

Located in the heart of Mission District, Kitava is a modern cafe that offers appetizers, small plates, entrees, and desserts that have been expertly prepared using only the highest quality of ingredients (i.e. pasture-raised meats and safe cooking oils). Is it healthy? Yes. Is it delicious? Yes.\n\nMy husband and I easily walked to this restaurant with an infant and stroller in tow from Mission Delores Park, but one can also directly access it via the BART station across the street. Upon entering Kitava, we discovered a spacious atmosphere decorated in a simple, yet tasteful manner. Guests order at a main counter and then dishes are delivered to your table of choice. After examining the menu, my husband ordered the Cuban bowl with pastured heritage pork shoulder, and I chose the General Tso's chicken. There was a tempting $7 special of the day, but we chose to try some of the restaurant's acclaimed staples. \n\nOur food was delivered within 20 minutes, an impressive feat considering the restaurant was full of patrons at 2:30 p.m. on a weekday afternoon. My General Tso's Chicken was beautifully displayed atop a bed of fresh broccoli and jasmine rice (can substitute with cauliflower rice). I wish I had taken a picture, but the aroma was too tantalizing. Within minutes, my plate was empty! The chicken was perfect - crispy and flavorful, but made without using any gluten, soy, MSG, etc. My husband reported his dish was equally delicious. And the best part? We felt GOOD about our choices. This is definitely a restaurant we would like to eat at again!", "author": "Arielle C."}

I think it's a good place to go with extremely health conscious people.\n\nTo me Kitava is expensive for my budget but it's not overpriced.  For the quality of food you are getting it's reasonable yet if you are on a tight budget it might be too much.  They do have daily specials that are around $7.  Some other options if you don't want to spend a lot are the plantaines ($5) which are really filling and the avocado mash ($6) which is like chips and guacamole but way less heavy.  \n\nMy favorite thing about Kitava is that the food isn't heavy and you don't feel weighed down and lethargic like food at other restaurants. Everything especially the meats are very flavorful, everything is fresh, and their portion sizes are more realistic as to what people this day in age should be eating.  \n\nI'd recommend their zoodles with meatballs, general Tso's chicken, and chocolate covered dates.  \n\nIt's right across from the 16th and Bart so can be doable during lunch if working in the financial district downtown time because it's easy to get to.", "author": "Joan W."}

Kitava is now one of my favorite spots in SF and a staple in my rotation. Here's why:\n\nThe food is fresh, additive free, and best of all DELICIOUS. The entire place is gluten and dairy free, which is amazing. Most items can be made completely grain free and paleo and/or vegan, another huge win. Despite being a huge foodie and lover of all things delicious and bad for me, I spend the vast majority of my time eating paleo. I'm so thankful to have a place that is incredibly tasty, has a varied menu, and is healthy for a wide range of diets. \n\nHere's what I've had-\nButternut squash \"hummus\" - it's a bean free revelation. It has an amazing combination of comforting warming spices that I've tried to replicate at home but I can't. Safe to say I'm completely obsessed and addicted. \n\nMeatball appetizer - I remember enjoying this when I tasted it at the event but can't remember specifics. \n\nSpaghetti squash bolognese - very tasty! Spaghetti squash /= pasta but I really enjoyed this dish and was satisfied by the portion. Great hearty dish for the cooler winter weather we've been having lately. \n\nCuban Bowl - love that I can sub more slaw for the beans and the offer cauliflower rice. This bowl is SO GOOD. Plus the pineapple habanero hot sauce is a great match for the fresh tangy flavors in the bowl. Also the avocado that came in the bowl was perfection - a HUGE pet peeve of mine is getting under/over ripe avocados.

Then I also happened to see a gilt deal for a dinner for two here, so me and my boyfriend sprang on it. We came on a Saturday night; the place is across the street from the BART station and doesn't have a lot of tables. Most tables were full, but we were able to find a spot after we ordered our deal of an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert to share.\n\nWe ordered the fried brussel sprouts as our appetizer, Meatloaf and sweet mashed potatoes as our first entree, General Tso's chicken as our second entree, and brownie as our dessert.\n\nEven though the sprouts were our appetizer, they came out after the entrees so it was treated more like our side. As far as fried Brussel sprouts go, they were fine; if they didn't come with the aioli then they'd essentially have no taste, hardly even salt, so I would not consider ordering it again unless they added some spices.\n\nThe meatloaf plate was good. Good flavor and a good healthy version of a hearty meal. Especially since half the dish was steamed broccoli and carrots so I'd suggest asking for more sauce or gravy.\n\nThe chicken was weird. We thought they they might have messed up the sauce on our order because it was supposed to be a soy sauce-like coconut aminos sauce, but it tasted like balsamic vinegar. It even came with an extra serving of the sauce, but we didn't use it with the chicken - honestly, it went better with the Brussel sprouts like a balsamic glaze. If it weren't for the sauce, the dish seemed like it could be pretty bomb...\n\nThe dessert was so so; the consistency was very crumbly which I'd expect for something gluten free, but I've made so many gluten free, paleo friendly brownies in my day that I was expecting better.\n\nOverall I was pleased with the concept and experience and would come back to try different things and stay away from others.

The service was friendly and it was clean inside. The sauce that came with my dish was delicious. The breaded chicken was hot, crispy, and tasted great. My friend really enjoyed her dish overall in terms of flavor.\n\nThe rice for both of our dishes were uncooked so they had a slight crunch to them. My breaded chicken was hot but the rest of my food came out warm and quickly turned cold. I guess someone in the kitchen finished cooking and placing the rice and broccoli in bowl way earlier than when the chicken was done. The ratio on my dish was a bit off. There was a lot of rice but I would have liked more broccoli and chicken pieces. The amount of chicken pieces I got was much smaller than the amount of broccoli I got.

It's a deceptively casual operation where you order at the counter and wait for the food with your number on a stick. I say 'deceptive' only because the prices are higher than you would expect, but the quality of the dishes more than justifies the cost. It was a bit like Chipotle if it went into a health nut phase and then went for a makeover. I really like the concept a lot because this is the type of fast food we all need to move toward if we plan to lead healthier lives. I came here quite early after work. so there wasn't a customer in the place, just what looked to be an employee eating at the one large round communal table.\n\nI had already taken a sneak preview of the menu online, so I knew what I wanted to try. It was the $15 Baja Bowl which mixed an avocado mash, kale slaw, poblano peppers, pico de gallo, salsa verde, and upon my discretion, cauliflower rice since I'm trying to minimize my carb intake. It automatically came with pastured chicken which pulled apart with ease (photo: http://bit.ly/2A0aLwe) - but you can alternatively order wild-caught salmon or cumin-spiced beans if you're a veg-head. I thought it was quite delicious and very fresh-tasting, and the portion was reasonable without getting excessive. The Chipotle parallels are unavoidable, but I doubt I'll look at another burrito bowl with as much fondness. Because I was like a kid in a candy store (an ironic analogy indeed), I also tried the $11 Pesto Meatballs just because they sounded good.\n\nNothing veggie about them, as they were made with 100% grass-fed beef and ladled with sunflower basil pesto (photo: http://bit.ly/2A0baz2). That was tasty and it had been so long since I had actual red meat, it was almost intoxicating to my system. There were no soft drinks served here (so much for refills), so I went for the $4.99 REBBL Maca Mocha Coconut Elixir, which was a \"super herb-powered coconut-milk elixir with dark cocoa, chicory & maca\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2ApiIM9). It was libation enough for me, and you just can't go wrong with coconut in my book. I need to bring Jamie W. back with me next time because he loves General Tso's Chicken and he will be thrilled to know that it comes with cauliflower rice as well. I really hope this place is a raging success because we need more healthy chains like this one. Keep rockin' it, Kitava!\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...bright, fresh, and tasty bowls of goodness...and the meatballs are very good, too\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...very clean and streamlined to match the menu, no elaborate d\u00e9cor here\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very friendly and very skinny...I hate 'em\nTOTAL - 5 stars...considering the convenient location, this will become a go-to spot for me", "author": "Ed U."}

For delivery, they use either GrubHub ($2.99+Delivery fee) or UberEats ($4.99, tip optional), or DoorDash (cost depends on what you order, but I think they're the costliest delivery option). You also have the option to pick up your meal from their Mission location using GrubHub. \n\nI've ordered from them 20 times since November 2016. They really impressed me with their honestly great-tasting food and they have not forgotten a single item or messed up any orders. In short, they are on the frigging ball. The only tiny, very tiny, quibble I have is that it would be nice to request they bump up their spice level on some of their dishes -- but I understand that in order to please more palates, they keep their seasonings on the gentle side. \n\nThey even cook Thanksgiving lunch and dinner -- I got it last year and it ROCKED. The turkey was moist. The mashed cauliflower was creamy and delicious. The sausage and apple stuffing was pure comfort food (gawd, I love stuffing). Even the Brussels sprouts were tasty, and they are not at all my favorite vegetable. Oh, and the cranberry relish was tangy and zingy. Lastly, the pumpkin pie was rich and decadent. \n\nSeriously the best delivery service I have had so far in San Francisco.

There were only two copies of the menu at the counter, so if you were waiting in line, you couldn't spend your time waiting deciding on what you were going to order.

The chicken was over cooked, dry and rubbery as well as bland. They put liquid aminos in a pool at the bottom of the container. We couldn't eat this food. If it's good for you it has to taste awful, right? We ordered from DoorDash and contacted their customer support. They offered us a $1.99 credit for next delivery-that's it.

It was never my intention to get your staff fired from my comment. I feel horrible about that and am sorry that you couldn't find a better resolution to the issue.   \n2. I make a lot of chicken bone broth at home. That's not what I tasted on the meatloaf. It was an off flavor from within the meatloaf.  \n3. I would prefer just salt and oil over your amino blend. Or just use soy sauce. Why would I want my vegetables sweet anyhow?\n4. There is nothing wrong with msg - it's a massive socially propagated belief that it's bad. Do some research and look at some studies. Not a single double blinded study has found any problems with it. It's just an amino acid stabilized by a sodium ion (as found in salt). It's found naturally at high concentrations in so much stuff, like Parmesan.  If you want something salty, we add salt. If you want something with more umami, you add msg. \n\nAlso, I spoke to one other guy who got the chicken. According to him it tasted like it was just boiled in water. Can you not use oil and sear meat with the paleo diet?  \n\n****************************************\n\nI had high expectations for this place.  Im doing a lot of low carb and was happy to find a place that had so many low carb options.  4 of us came here for lunch and had the meatloaf, general chows, chicken, and pulled pork bowls.  Meatloaf and accompanying sweet potatoes had such a strange off taste.  Bitterness and citrus and funk.  Meatloaf should taste like meat.  I have idea what it tasted like. The general chows was meh and only tolerable due to my friend not having had breaded chicken for a long time - but he says the cauliflower rice ruined it.  I tried some spit it out into a napkin. The pulled pork was so bland - but managed to be the best option because it lacked funky strange off flavors. \n\nTo top it off, the person at the register pre-pressed the 20% tip button before showing is the payment screen. This is a no service establishment.  20% to take my order is just ridiculous.  \n\nOne of us (with the pork) said he might come back. Rest of us will not. I didn't eat more than two bites of the meatloaf and I'm off to the Taco Bell on duboce to get this nasty taste out of my mouth.", "author": "reza n."}

I wonder if that's  something you might consider?

If they were boiled or steamed, just close your restaurant please. If they were roasted, do it about twice as long, in a single layer, and consider a little salt, pepper, oil, and if you're feeling fancy a small splash of balsamic vinegar.\n\nChicken: It was a bare pale chicken breast with that odd slightly rubbery wetness that boiled (perhaps you'd call it poached?) chicken has. Not much else to say because what else is there to say about a boiled chicken breast, the next-blandest protein to tofu? Consider roasting or searing these in a pan, sprinkle on some herbs, and possibly switch to chicken thighs for more (any) flavor and texture. There was a dipping bowl with about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and herbs that helped a small amount. If you serve chicken and it's less flavorful than what you can get every day at Chipotle, there is work to do.\n\nSweet potato mash: I love sweet potatoes. Over the hundreds of times I've eaten sweet potatoes and yams in my life (in every way, mashed, pan-roasted, fries, etc), this was the first time I didn't eat the whole serving. The best way to describe Kitava's sweet potatoes would be sour potatoes. They're already tangy if you're not adding sugar, so I see very little reason to put in so much lemon juice. Disappointing, sour, and gloppy. Try dicing them and boiling or pan-roasting with SMALL amount of lemon juice in the water to keep them intact, then lightly tossing with an herbed aioli and chives for a lower-carb spin on potato salad. Or slice up some wedges and roast those in oil, and serve with chipotle mayo. Or, just mash them and do as little to them as you can...sweet potatoes are great without any additions or seasoning. Let the taste come through without piling on stuff that sounds cool on the menu.\n\nAll ingredients together: There was no problem with the quality of the ingredients, just the preparation. But if you're a grocery store you can get by on just the quality of ingredients; as a restaurant the preparation is the majority of what you bring to the table. The bowl was served a couple degrees above room temperature. Not sure if that was intentional but it didn't help the textures and flavors at all.

Often times, I'd rather eat at home vs eating out to avoid the way my body feels after food has been cooked in cheap oils or cross contaminated. Kitava in next level when it comes both to taste and integrity. \n\nYou can feel the love they put into their menu and food as your body is filled and feels amazing afterward. \n\nNot only is this food amazing, it's also at a price that doesn't break the bank. Not to mention the fact it was in an old Mc Donalds is fantastic! \n\nWhoever dreamed up this place had health in mind. Thank you for making your vision become a reality that many can enjoy!", "author": "Amanda B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-25", "description": "I'm so happy this place exists! I keep wanting to pinch myself because it seems too good to be true: a beautiful, serene oasis, conveniently located across from the 16th and Mission BART station, with friendly & fast service, wifi -- and most importantly, food that somehow manages to be indulgently delicious while still being healthy.\n\nSo far I've loved every dish I've tried:\n1. Zoodles & meatballs: Perfectly done zoodles, still slightly crunchy but tender enough to twirl around your fork like pasta, covered in a fresh tomato sauce, and four huge meatballs. I was especially impressed with the meatballs, they were so moist and full of flavor.\n2. Fried plantains: Fried in just enough oil to make them soft and caramelized, but not at all greasy (which is my typical complaint about plantains). They come with a slightly spicy mayo dipping sauce that's the perfect complement to the plantains' sweetness.\n3. Cauliflower rice: Excellent, rice-sized \"grains\" that somehow don't taste like cauliflower at all. A fluffy and healthy side dish that pairs well with a bunch of different things (I tried it with meatballs + tomato sauce, and also with the plantains + mayo).\n\nThe portions are all really generous, btw. I can tell I'll be a regular here for a long time, especially since it's a spot I can bring my vegan friends, paleo friends, and foodie friends alike.", "author": "Anne P."}

Food tastes pretty good for being paleo-friendly. However, most recent lunch order messed up three of the entrees by not adding additional items (i.e. extra chicken, meat sauce instead of veggie sauce, etc) that were paid for. \n\nDuring busy hours, be sure to check your orders to make sure you actually got what you ordered.", "author": "Daffy D."}

Having a place that is gluten, dairy, soy, peanut and refined sugar/oil free means I will be safe and not feel sick after-food taste aside. That's already awesome. \n\nThe general tso's chicken was delicious. Loved the sauce and the chicken was fried perfectly. The spaghetti squash bolognese was warm and comforting. \n\nI was impressed by the range of options they have- being able to accommodate vegans and paleo folks alike is not an easy thing.

I pass by this place a lot - and it's so out of place - I have not since one seen a latino family dine here.  I ate here and paid 5 bucks for clear organic broth.

But in all honesty, as healthy-ish as the food is here, it's bland.
