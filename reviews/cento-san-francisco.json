Previously I hadn't come here because I knew it was a tiny little shop, more of grab and go coffee. Fortunately that fit the occasion of waiting for a few friends and keeping myself occupied until then.\n\nCento serves Blue Bottle Coffee, which is always great. The baristas are curt but friendly. There are some pastries on display. And it's all cash only. This place is super simple. Get your coffee, and go to work or catch your Caltrain. Nothing too special about it.\n\nThere's also no seating inside, just space to wait around for your beverage, but there's a public parklet right outside, which is a recent addition in the past few years. Even there, it's more standing space than seats, I'm guessing to prevent homeless people (or even non-homeless people) from overstaying their welcome. Perfect for answering a few emails on my laptop and buying time.

Or I could point out that a barista works in the service industry, despite ludicrous misgivings that a barista is an artist, or the authority on matters of subjective taste, or a generally terrible business person who turns away customers daily due to insecurity and self-importance. \n\nInstead, I'll just give an accurate and annotated transcript of the interaction I had here, and let the reader be the judge of whether this place is worthy of anyone's time. Since we're in the land of technology, I'll use // to signify commentary.\n\n\"Hi there. Could I have a cappuccino on ice, please?\"\n\"No. We don't do that.\" \n\n\"Okay. Then how about a cortado, to-go?\"\n\"No.\" // silence for at least 5-10 seconds\n\n// Surely this is one of those cheeky yet annoying jokes where a barista or waitress says \"No...\" laughs, and continues \"Of course! Just kidding.\" Alas, \"no.\" This was not one of those moments.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"No. We don't do those to-go.\"\n// At this point I'd like to point out that this place is basically a kiosk, with no seating room... not even a chair. \n\n\"Okay.

I also came here happy and left annoyed.\n\nSomeday, maybe the poor baristas here will make sense of their identity crisis. Maybe they'll learn that the goal of coffee sensibility is to make people good coffee. Or they'll learn that being in the service industry means providing a service to customers in a way that makes them happy, not angry and annoyed. Or perhaps they'll simply remember they're running a business, and get a hang of the whole \"provide a product... receive money\" thing. \n\nIn the meantime, go somewhere else.

They serve Blue Bottle coffee, fly the logo prominently,  and generally stick to the same brew methods Blue Bottle employs.  One major difference, though, is that Cento typically only has BB's blends available for drip and espresso such as Three Africans or Bella Donovan.  That sorta bums me out because I'm more of a single origin guy, but I don't know if that's Cento's decision or whether BB doesn't offer those coffees wholesale.  Every now and then they have some Sidamo dripping and I try to take advantage of it when they do.\n\nI work nearby, so I often head to Cento either on my way to work or for an afternoon pick-me-up.  The espresso ranges considerably from very good to pretty poor.  I feel like sometimes the baristas there let the quality slide from time to time, perhaps by not dialing the espresso regularly or maybe even by not tasting what they're serving.  Similarly there was a stretch of several days where their water heater was either broken or misadjusted far too cold.  They served some seriously underextracted coffee as a result and I wondered if they noticed. I don't think they aren't capable of excellent coffee, it's just a very casual atmosphere that, apart from the attention to detail I otherwise quite enjoy.\n\nThe baristas are friendly and down-to-earth.  Atmospherically it's a kiosk caffe in a particularly cozy alley.  There's an area across from the kiosk quite well suited for sitting in the sun.  \n\nI like Cento.

No longer would I have the safe haven of Awaken Caf\u00e9, my daily to often twice-daily Americano hookup.\n\nThings were looking dire (read: all shitty delis and Starbucks) until I found this small beacon of caffeinated hope on Ritch Street. $2 for Blue Bottle?  Done deal.  Their espresso isn't the best, but with a high-quality and cheap cup of fresh drip coffee, I don't really care.  To boot, looks like a window is opening next door with chicken and waffles?  Are they reading my mind???", "author": "Tyler M."}

I find it slightly pretentious given that  that get away with charging full cafe prices without having to deal with the overhead that comes with running a full cafe setup.\n\nCoffee is a drink that should be enjoyed in a relaxed (seated) environment, plus the lack of 'proper' cafe prevents them from incorporating up the vespa/lambretta/scooter/mod concept more deeply into their business.", "author": "Ben M."}

My 2nd visit to a Blue Bottle place and the staff were just as snooty and the space was just as uninviting.  I ordered a cappuccino and asked for it \"on the dry side\" because I'm sick of baristas ruining caps by making them lattes with a little extra foam.  Its 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk, 1/3 foam, pretty much has been since they were invented in the 1900s.  Anyway, the uppity hipster who served me looked at me through her thick black hipster glasses and said in a tone you might use when talking with the mentally challenged \"oh no, I don't think I can do that\" and then proceeded to give me a lecture on how to make caps.  I haven't been a barista, but have made probably 3-400 caps at my last place of work, so I kinda know what is and isn't possible.  She convinced me to try it her way, which was 1/3 espresso and the rest foamed milk.  It was good, as a latte, which was on the menu and which wasn't what I wanted.  Long story short, Blue Bottle get over yourself (and learn to give the customer what they want).  Philz gives better service, better coffee and a nice space to enjoy it in instead of huddled on some stupid alley.", "author": "Mike B."}

Simple menu, excellent roaster, up to date baristas that know the science of pulling shots and preparing \"specialty coffee\".  It's amazing how Starbucks or Philz is still mentioned in the same sentence as these mini bars.  Starbucks is fully automatic, meaning there is no barista talent needed.  Their machines are pre-programmed to pull a shot (espresso) in a specific time.  But the time factor is only one of many variables that go into making a great espresso.  They are in business for sheer volume = money, sorta like McDonald's.   Philz is... well, it's Philz.  It's one man's creativity on coffee.  Not bad for sure.  But then again you eat California Rolls and there is no such thing in Japan.  Bars like Cento and the other 2 in the City are following a growing trend to revert back to true Italian style coffee.  Not the California Roll coffee 95% of all coffee houses and restaurants serve.  More than likely the reason you don't prefer it is because your brainwashed into thinking California Roll coffee is the ONLY coffee, over sweet, over foamed, over sized.  I read about a 1/3 1/3 1/3 ratio of espresso, steamed milk and foam making a cappuccino???  That ratio has been slowly dying and deserves to die.  Soon you'll be outta luck finding that ratio because the double shot with a light airy foam is what \"specialty\" coffee bars are serving now, and a latte has no foam! tsk tsk! but then again almost all reviews by this rater were negative so head to Cento and upgrade your palate to real espresso drinks using some of the best beans in town.
