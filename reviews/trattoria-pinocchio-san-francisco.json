I had some friends coming in from Pennsylvania, first time to California and thought I would take them to a good Italian restaurant in North Beach. What a disappointment! I was rather embarrassed because there are so many good places I could have taken them and this wasn't one of them. The food\u200b and service were\u200b less than stellar. \nFirst off when we came in there was only two other tables seated. We came in were greeted and sat quickly. While we looked through the menu our waiter came up to ask for drinks. I got wine and asked about their salads and the portion size. He told me they came on a big plate. Ok, so I asked are they big portions because I was looking for a small salad. He told me they were. So I didn't order a salad. He went and grabbed my wine and came back.  The pour looked very small but I figured it was a big wine glass and it was more an optical illusion. Come to find out it wasn't. As more people came in and got wine they got about 2 times as much as me. \nThen after we order I see a salad come by our table that was a small dinner salad. I asked the waiter what salad that was and he said that it was off the happy hour menu which we never got. So I asked him if we could have it and he said that happy hour ended at 5:30 well it was only 5:20, so I asked for the menu. He looked at me strangely and brought the menu. I asked him what salad that was because on the happy hour menu there were three salads. He told me it was part of the special. I explain to him that the salad on the special was the same salad on the main menu that looks like it could be small. He said I could only get it if I ordered the special.\nNow I'm getting a little irritated. I went ahead and ordered the small salad. The table\u200b bread was stale and dry. Then we got our food. My friends chicken Parmesan came with vegetables, he wanted pasta which was never offered but was an option. We called the waiter back. He took the plate and brought back the pasta. I finally finished my salad and started into my gnocchi. It was undercooked and tasted like flour. After 15 mins of waiting for our waiter to check on us, which he never did and my friends went and found someone to talk to, The refired my Gnocchi, but it was still\u200b\u200b awful. Won't be going back.", "author": "Michella F."}

The setting is enough in itself; the staff made it even more so. \n\nThere's a line of al fresco cafes along Columbus, arguably all doing the same thing at each location. This one is different, a wedge of a building a la NYC Flatiron with options to go sunny or shady on the street in the mid afternoon, depending on which side you choose to sit on. \n\nThe first waitperson recommended the shady side because there would be more to see there - she was absolutely right. Without hitting the menu I asked for a Negroni and some olives. Before they arrived I had two other waitstaff check up on me. I was already rightfully impressed. \n\nOlives were delicious, lip smacking and finger licking good in fresh herbs and chunks of garlic. My Negroni is best described as fat: big glass, lots of ice, literally overflowing, bitter bitter bitter. If only it was hotter here so the effect could be maximised!\n\nThe staff kept checking on me even though I was not committing to a bigger slice of the menu. Other places would have treated me like a red-headed stepchild: not here. \n\nBig thumbs up from me. I'd seek this place out again just for the service.", "author": "Richard L."}

The calamari had a nice crunch perfectly cooked but not much flavor unless you dipped it in the sauces.\n\nMy friend and I shared the entire dinner because we wanted to have variety. The chicken parm and spaghetti were disappointing because i honestly thought their simple dishes should be the easiest to make good impressions with right?

We made a reservation on yelp but they were not too busy while we were there on a weekend night. I liked that they offer a variety of homemade pastas. I got the gnocchi pesto. I don't usually get pesto because I prefer tomato based sauces. Nut they sold me on homemade pesto. The first few gnocchi melted in my mouth like fluffy pillows. It was delicious. The pesto was great. I sopped up a lot of it with the complementary bread. My main complaint is that it's not very texturally diverse so it became harder to eat as I got deeper into the dish. All the gnocchi are the same texture. Though as it got colder, it didn't melt in my mouth as easily. The pesto sauce, while tasty was just saucy. They tried to add texture with pine nuts sprinkled in there but it wasn't enough. That's why I tried to have the bread with the pesto sauce too. Maybe if you were to get this, I would split this and another entr\u00e9e with someone else. So you could try it but not have to eat a whole plate of it. I tried a bite of the veal lasagna and the chicken parmigiana. Both were good. My bf thought the lasagna was just ok but huge portion so he was stuffed.  And our friend gets his standby spaghetti bolognese. I thought the prices were pricy but average for SF, I suppose.  Service was so-so.

Ok. I'm okay with it. It's a $20 meal + tax and tip, I'm guessing. The top of what I wanted to pay for a spontaneous meal on my own.\n\nUm... the bill came, and it was over $40 with tip. $22 for the pasta, nearly $9 for sparkling water. BAIT & SWITCH.

I'm not from the City but appreciate that I live less than an hour from a world renowned tourist attraction, having been world traveled myself.  While walking up the street I noticed many restaurants were crowded and this place had open tables, score!  Well if you'd noticed I gave one star I'm getting to that.  The service was prompt, food was great, I'm including a photo of my dinner, of which half went home because the portions were generous, so this begs why ONE STAR?  The waiter has a mouth on him.  While the table behind me was from Australia he was trying to make conversation with them which was making reference to portable/mobile credit card readers and how Europe is so advanced having created them he can't understand why we don't have them.  I guess he doesn't know San Jose (otherwise known as Silicon Valley) is less than 50 miles south of San Francisco, I digress, I know you're following along.  Now let's move onto the unprofessional portion of the evening which turned this 5 Star review into 1 Star.  Ignoring all the nonsense banter is what I intended as I didn't come for conversation I came for dinner.  We've eaten, food was yummy, I'm pleased ready to leave and even patronize again and then our waiter starts in with political conversation with the hostess.  People this is a SMALL establishment they are loud.  Their conversation starts out with already not so bright waiter saying \"all the people in the middle of the country between the coasts are IGNORANT\" you know because they're voting for Trump.  And thank God California is so progressive because we can't have \"those\" people running things.  I can get into further detail but I'll try not to keep you much longer.  Needless to say that ruined my experience.  Lumping together basically the 40 states as ignorant from this true idiot is NO different than being racist or a bigot except well that might be fashion all since it jives with media coverage.  I made a point to let both of them know their loud conversation was inappropriate and unappreciated.  While at work serving the public keep your political comments to yourself and your locker room talk to yourself. \n\nNow to the management and owners of this establishment, I would have an immediate sit down with all your employees on how they need  to behave and converse about anything that could be deemed inappropriate in a work place that serves the public.\n\nFor the record I am not voting for either candidate but I am offended that a whole group of MILLIONS of \"ignorant\" citizens are being demeaned.  As I am equally offended that we have open season on law enforcement officers, our choice of candidates are a rhino republican with womanizing tendencies and an otherwise belongs in prison Hillary for her \"na\u00efvet\u00e9\" for not knowing what classified means.\n\nPlease!

No, but I will because I understand that there are things that the restaurant cannot completely control. Though, I think most people would give this place 1-2 stars just for that harrowing experience.\n\nWe were exploring Little Italy on Saturday and came across this place only because it was centrally located and all the good spots like Molinari Deli had long lines. Trattoria Pinocchio had a few tables outside that overlooked the hustle and bustle of Columbus Street. Since it was a pretty day, we decided to sit outside. They have heaters outside which is great because I get cold very easily.\n\nAnyways, I ordered the Pinot Grigio ($8) which was pretty good, and my friend ordered the Sangiovese ($8) which tasted like it had been opened for too long. When my friend brought it to the waiter's attention, he said that it was a new bottle. The waiter did not offer to pour her another glass or to get him another wine that was more to her liking. \n\nI ordered the corn soup ($8) and loved it! The only downside was that a spider fell into it. When I told the waiter, he seemed very indifferent. He didn't offer to bring me a new soup. I had to ask him if he could bring me another soup that did not have a spider in it. \n\nThere are so many other great places in Little Italy; I will bite the bullet next time and wait in the long lines to get a table. Otherwise, I might end up at a mediocore restaurant with a spider in my soup. Lesson learned!", "author": "Tien L."}

We were walking back to the Caltrain Station (yes, a LONG detour) and decided to stop somewhere for a glass of wine. After passing a few restaurants that just didn't look inviting, we stumbled on Trattoria Pinocchico. There were no cute tables available outside so we found 2 stools at the bar and ordered 2 glasses of Pino. Unfortunately the wine I wanted was not available so we were offered a very nice  Sangiovese. The pour was hearty and the entertainment behind the bar kept us there for dinner. \n\nI'm guessing the character behind the bar was the owner and honestly ... he made our experience one we won't forget and can't wait to come back to enjoy again. Sarcasm, silly, old school, honest, engaging and passionate. These are only a few reasons we fell in love with this Sicilian man who is way bigger than life. His energy and spirit were addicting and so much fun to watch him interact with other guests. So you get that I enjoyed his \"Entertaining\" personality, but the food was even better!!\n\nWe ordered: \n\nGnocchi Enzo: light, fluffy potato dumplings covered in a delicious gorgonzola cream sauce. Sinful and decadent and I want more!\n\nTortellini Bolognese: homemade pasta made with love smothered in a rich, mouthwatering meat sauce that you know was someone's grandmother's recipe. \n\nNeedless to say my brother and I licked our plates completely clean. This is a place I would be addicted to and proud to be called a regular at if I lived in the City. I'll be back again and again for sure. \n\n5 star justification:\n1. Engaging owner\n2.

Although the sauce was flavorful, the two pieces of checks were so thin that they lacked any real flavor. No marinade nor caramelization to add depth. My guess is this is so the chicken can be used in whatever is ordered and cuts down waste. Opted for the vegable side rather than pasta - one piece of broccoli, a few baby carrots (some cut, others not), and a few random pieces of potato and zucchini.

The entrees were very good and my wife couldn't stop talking about the prefect cook on all her seafood.  \nI would have probably gone with 5 stars but... they automatically included a 15% gratuity on the check.  I left $4 on top to bump it up to 20% but I think this is a super underhanded move, I'm really leaning towards 3 stars for that.", "author": "Randy M."}

I even had my sister try the coppa and she said it was \"..baaaaaad.....\" I told the waiter and he tried to tell me \"That's how it's supposed to taste..\"  I kinda laughed and said, \"nooooo, I KNOW what coppa should taste like and this is not it..\"  Mind you, I'm 100% Italian and the one thing I do know is coppa... Anyway, he was nice enough to bring out a prosciutto sandwich which was 100Xs better and super fresh.  I also had an antipasto plate which was wonderful.. Next time, I'm just going to get that- prosciutto, roasted peppers, tomato and fresh mozzarella, breaded eggplant, artichoke hearts, olives, pepperonicini...\n\nThe sis had a 4 topping pizza, said it was great..\nOthers had: pea soup (delish), paparadelle pasta w/meat sauce (delish)..other pasta/ravioli dishes were enjoyed by all..\n\nI was really happy with the service..

The waiter that served my group must be getting paid a lot or he's the owners son because he treated us like we din't belong and in such a hurry. Along with this as we were eating the waiters and the bartender were arguing and calling each other bad words (fuck you!) out loud. What were they fighting about you may ask, well the waiters were accusing the bartender of steeling, they went through the waiters bag 4 feet away from us, ( mind you we were the last customers in and the restaurant is huge in an L shape).

So when we had an event to go to in San Francisco at the beginning of July we jumped at the chance to visit one of our favorite Italian restaurants.\n \nWhen we entered it was 8:50pm and there was a total of 4 tables occupied and one person sitting at the bar picking up a to-go order.  The hostess passed empty tables to end up offering us one directly across from the entrance into the kitchen. When asked if we can move to another table she told us they were for bigger parties, but reluctantly moved us to a table across from the bar.\n\nMariano greeted us, served water and took our order.  Basically we didn't see him again until the bill came. The antipasto salad, veal parmesan and gnocchi were good.  However the bruschetta starter was an icy mixture on top of tasteless toast. \n\nShortly after we ordered,  a bridal shower party of 10 arrived. Their waiter is the one who brought us our entree while juggling his bridal party as well as his other 2 tables.  I wish I would have gotten his name but we were sitting there in shock and disbelief at the service.\nWhere was Mariano? He was hanging out at the front door with the unenthusiastic hostess and a mystery staff? manager (wearing a track suit)?\n\nThis mystery staff/manager/ was not only friends with our waiter Mariano, but he must be pretty high up in the Trattoria Pinocchio world.  He waltzed through the restaurant from the kitchen area, to behind the bar tasting various draft beers then back to the front door to hang out with Mariano all the while twirling his white earbuds. Walking past tables and waitstaff with about a foot of his earbud cord twirling and swinging it around.\n\nI could go on and but typing this review and reliving the awful experience is exhausting.\nBottom line is that the next time in San Francisco I will find another Italian restaurant to spend my time and money at.

While living in the SF Bay Area my wife and I would go here every Sunday for lunch and many times for dinner as well. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is wonderful as well. My favorite waiter is Antonio who has worked there for a while. Certain pastas are made fresh daily such as the gnocchi, tagliatelle and ravioli. \n\nGnocchi Enzo - One of my all time favorite dishes. Fresh homemade gnocchi in a gorgonzola cheese sauce. The sauces in this place have amazing flavor and the gnocchi literally melts in your mouth since it's made fresh. \n\nPenne Amatriciana - Their Amatriciana sauce is very different then other Amatriciana sauces I have had at Bay Area restaurants. The flavor is spectacular ! The pasta was cooked al dente which is the way it should be done. So may Italian restaurants in America and Americans in general seem to like their pasta overcooked. Try this dish and you will be addicted.\n\nButternut Squash Ravioli in cream sauce - The butternut ravioli is sometimes on the special menu and it is delicious. the ravioli is homemade and very fresh. The difference between boxed and homemade pasta is huge. There is no substitute for fresh pasta made daily. \n\nPasta Festa - Also on the special menu from time to time. My wife hade this meal and the pasta was tagliatelle with a cream sauce and seafood. It was delicious and the portions were huge as well.\n\nProsciuotto and Melone - I have started my meals frequently with this appetizer. The melon is always fresh and the prosciutto always top quality. The perfect balance between salt and potassium. Great flavor. Salt raises the blood pressure and potassium from the melon keep the blood pressure in check. This is a nice, fresh, cold appetizer.\n\nI miss San Francisco and this restaurant especially along with Trattoria La Siciliana. two of my favorite haunts. When I die I plan on haunting this place and stealing pasta from patrons' dishes lol. You can't go wrong with any of the food here. Prices are higher for some dishes but the pastas are made fresh and I would imagine the rents in North Beach are quite high.\n\nCarpaccio - Another winning appetizer. beef sliced super thin with arugula, capers and bread and shaved cheese. The flavor is great when you put them all together.\n\nPanini Sandwiches - If you choose any of the Panini sandwiches you can't go wrong. My wife and I have tried the veggie, chicken, prosciutto & Mozzarella and the Italian sausage and they were all delicious. They know food in this place.", "author": "Anthony L."}

I had hoped I would write a review that would be worthy. Sometimes there are places you hope would exceed your expectations to write positive reviews but you end up disappointed with your experience. This is why we write reviews on Yelp because not all of our reviews will be so positive. The review for this restaurant is an example.\n\nThere are several of Italian restaurants on North Beach that focuses on regional cuisine. I've tried different types of Italian cuisine, but there is one I haven't tried: Sicilian. Trying to find one on North Beach was very difficult. I did my research to find a Sicilian restaurant. The closest I came at that time was this place. According to this restaurant's website the chef is from Sicily. So I was hoping to find Sicilian food here.\n\nI ate here last Friday for lunch. Before I went here I searched through Wikipedia to find out what Sicilian cuisine is. What makes Sicilian cuisine unique from other Italian cuisine is the history of Sicily. Since this island had been inhabited by the Arabs, Spanish, Normans, and Greeks there are several types of ingredients are part of Sicilian cuisine: apricots, citrus, saffron, peppers, couscous, broad beans, cocoa, maize, etc. From my research Sicilian cuisine symbolizes the term melting pot. I was excited to try Sicilian cuisine.\n\nWhen I read the menu I tried to find items from my research. For the pasta I could not find anything with sea urchin or anchovies. The most famous Sicilian pasta dish Pasta alla Norma, which consists of penne pasta with tomatoes, eggplants, and ricotta cheese, was not listed on the menu. With respects to the seafood I couldn't find any tuna, sea bass, cuttlefish, or swordfish. As I read the menu, out of desperation the closest item I could find that may resemble Sicilian cuisine is Salmone Siciliana. In the small print of this item you can substitute vegetables for pasta. For this dish I get two courses into one dish - pasta and fish. The dish was pretty good. The spaghetti was al dente and the salmon was moist pink, unlike most salmons in restaurants are overcooked. The tomato sauce was flavorful because of the oregano and capers. However overall I wasn't satisfied with this meal because of the lack of authentic Sicilian dishes this was the only dish I ordered; the other three Italian restaurants on North Beach I reviewed I ordered at least two dishes. \n\nDon't get me wrong the food here is good. If you want good quality Italian food you can find it here. However I never got a sense what type of cuisine this restaurant specializes. In a sense I felt empty. The only good thing besides the taste of the food is that I didn't overspend. Other than that I was not satisfied with my meal. I'll still continue my quest to find Sicilian food on North Beach.", "author": "Gerald R."}

When we ordered food we decided to ordered fried calamari as appetisers, what tasted only the breading, barely could find calamari; then for the main course I asked the waiter if Tuna salad was with tuna steak; and the guy said: yes it's really good piece of tuna we make here! My surprise was when it arrived and was tuna from the can! We asked the waiter and he said he never said was tuna steak, of course after all he never came back to the table to check if we need something else, I walked to the front, wait person and asked for the check and once again when we got the check one more surprise: the waiter sneaky added 15% gratuity to our bill!

Not only that, but with there Italians and had the accent, we felt like we were almost in Italy! (well not really, duh!) \n\nDrinks: nothing I can say - I ordered a standard drink: Sprite. But my friend orderd a type of vodka that he told me he rated 4/5 on. Don't take my word for this! \n\nFood: 3.5/5 I ordered there standard pizza (alot of mozzerella, tomatos and green leafs on it). It felt soggy maybe due to the fact there was a lot of stuff on it but anyways the dough was soggy. The cheese will ALWAYS fall off the pizza like if it was liquified. Usally the pizza and cheese should melt into your mouth but it basically melted infront of me. So anyways it tasted O.K. \n\nDesert: nothing I can say - once again, my friend did take a tiramisu and rated it like 4/5. It did have alot of coffee in it. Don't take my word for this. \n\nSo to conclude I have to rate it 4/5. I should recommend this restaurant but with some precautions.. I have not tasted there other foods like there pastas etc.) so if your reading this at there restaurant, go and continue ordering your food!

After we left, and started asking what each other thought of the meal and every single one of us decided that it was such an awful experience we needed erase the entire experience.... so we walked down to Rose Pistola and had a decent meal.\n\n\nThis was actually several years ago, but it was so bad that it comes up regularly in conversation - as it did today.\n\nWhat truly made it memorable was that we gave them a second chance about a year later.  This time, it was late and we decided, ok, the dinner was awful, but maybe the deserts are better.   I got a poached pear in chocolate sauce:  frozen in the middle, not ripe and chocolate sauce was a puddle of oil.  My wife got the creme brule - burned on one side, not touched on the other....  inside was kind of like clotted cream and also cold.  \n\nThat was now a year ago.  I feel awful for tourists that come here and spend an evening surrounded by good restaurants and end up there.\n\nThe only place that really has come close to this bad is Mona Lisa, also on Columbus, but a few doors down.  They gave me a \"plate\" of pasta that seemed to have a giant glass of tepid water dumped on top of the red sauce.\n\nI'd recommend Osteria, Ideale or Franchino if you're in the area and have to have italian food. \n\nIf you're just looking for a great restaurant in North Beach, I'd say Cafe Jacqueline is the top of the list - but they're exclusively a souffle restaurant.

The setting, the food (of course), and heck, I may even be a teeny-tiny bit in love with the guy who was my waiter. He was just so friendly and attentive. Gotta love THAT in a guy!\n\nAnyway..... I started with my all time favorite summer salad: a caprese. And, this one was just perfect. Wonderful heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella topped with both a basil reduction AND torn basil leaves, and then drizzled with the most flavorful olive oil. No balsamic (as it should be.... THAT my friends is just too overpowering for this delicate salad). It was a happy summer day in my mouth!\n\nThen onto the main course: pasta arribiata. Perfect al dente (why do so many restaurants have difficulty with that?) pasta with fresh, flavorful spicy sauce with chunks of tomato, garlic, and herbs. Wow!!!! Simple and FANTASTIC! Perhaps the best I've ever had!\n\nI was too full for dessert, but luckily not too full for an after dinner glass of house made lemoncello. Again, the best ever with a perfect sweet to tart balance.

We were told they had San Francisco sour dough, but after we ordered they brought cold sliced Italian bread. The chicken Parmesan was microwaved and tough, the Caesar salad WAY overdressed, the butternut squash ravioli was flavorless and part undercooked. The only decent meal was the tortellini with peas and mushrooms. The service was abysmal, and because we were a party of six, the gratuity was added at 20% but the waiter did not advise us of this fact. The other servers, though aware of our impatience, never told our waiter we were in need of him. I will never go back, and you should avoid this place.

We were hoping it was as good as it was then, 8 years  ago. First of all, it was.  After a few nights of disappointments at \"famous\" restaurants in SF, we  had our best meal. Our expectations for Italian food are high, since it's how we were both raised. \n\nEverything was right, the olives,the tricolor salad, and the bread. We wanted to dine slowly so we ordered a bottle of wine and waited to order dinner.  We could watch the kitchen, which I enjoy as an ex- restauranteur, and could see and smell the wide variety of dishes prepared. We wanted pasta. The Gnocchi Enzo brought a tear to the eye. The light pillows in the Gorgonzola sauce was rich but delicate. The Veal ravioli was fresh made and though I enjoyed the simplicity of the sage and butter sauce, I know the mushroom cream would have been delicious too. \n\nThe chops served at the table next to us made me turn my head. They looked perfectly cooked and smelled incredible. We lamented that we hadn't come earlier in the week because we could have enjoyed it more than once. We will next time. \n\nTraditional Spumoni was cool and delicious.\n\nOur intention is to enjoy our meals together. As two women, we get sat in less than perfect tables but we can usually settle in and focus on our time and food.  Service was just enough; around when we needed it.

Let me first give some background.  I am Italian/Sicilian-American (I can understand the language etc. and was raised with this background).  Every time I have EVER gone to ANY authentic Italian restaurant I have ALWAYS been treated wonderfully and like family.  I did not anticipate our evening at Trattoria Pinocchio to be any different.  Were we ever in for a surprise.\n\nI don't want to say that we were treated differently because I am Italian (and look VERY (Southern) Italian) and my boyfriend isn't (he has blond hair, nordic features), but I swear, that was the vibe I got from our waiter.  We both noted that the other patrons around us were a.) seated first, b.) served first, and the most insulting, c.) spoken to warmly and generally paid attention to.  I thought at first perhaps our waiter was just having a bad day, it happens-but to treat one customer differently than the next for no apparent reason...\n\n-We had to ask for water while we watched everyone around us get served water first with refills\n-Our waiter rolled his eyes when my boyfriend mispronounced the name of an Italian dish\n-Our waiter literally tossed us our bill and said, *here.* and then approached the patrons seated next to us with a kind smile, gave them their bill and asked, \"would you gentlemen like anything else?\"\n-We got our food last though we were seated first.\n\nThe food was mediocre. I ordered the Spaghetti Puttanesca and my boyfriend had ravioli.  I suppose the pasta was cooked to a nice al dente, but we were in Little Italy, so one can only hope that whoever is in the kitchen can at least cook the pasta right.  Perhaps it would have been better had the waiter not left such a bitter taste in our mouths?  Hard to enjoy the food and atmosphere when being treated like second rate customers.\n\nI usually am a great tipper (especially for good service...I know how difficult it can be to work with the public)...however, this was an instant where I left a \"tip\" of 17 cents-a number considered *unlucky* in Italy-and cut my losses...we will NEVER go there again.", "author": "Dominique C."}

Come on... this place brings up nostalgic feelings because of Disney...\n\nAnyways. \n\nWe were seated by a charming hostess and served by what seems to be the head waiter. Almost all the wait staff in here had some sort of European accent (French or Italian), so the ones without stuck out in a very interesting manner. Actually, I'm lying, because there were waiters who seemed to have a Southern twang... \n\nOrdered a pino griogio, the special (Sicilian pesto), and he ordered the veal ravioli and a Blue Moon. The wine came out, and I don't know if I got a small glass or something... not a huge deal for me, since I don't drink much anyways. The food came out pretty fast! Both were really delicious, although honestly, the ravioli and the pesto actually tastes better mixed together than separate. I don't know if I should be surprised or not, because our food choices tend to be very harmonious, or maybe most high quality restaurants have menus that will always taste good with each other. \n\nBoyfriend says that the pesto tastes \"really healthy\". I thought it was extremely delicious. I was too busy picking out the tomatoes to really answer the owner if it was good. \n\nThe veal ravioli tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee ravioli, but better. I wish I didn't have to make that comparison... but it has that soft, tomatoey, meaty flavor that's so similar! Obviously, the ravioli shell was incomparable, but really. When you taste it, you'll get a very nostalgic feeling. Although if you are anything like me, it will probably remind you of early college, when you were too poor/lazy to get anything better and ate it straight out of the can.\n\nPerfect portions.

He probably could have given us a little more time with our menus and in between trips, but I believe we were probably one of his last two tables for the night.  Even with all the attention, didn't feel rushed, just that he wanted to make sure we got what we wanted when we wanted.\n\nHe suggested a nice white for us (pinot grigio, i believe), which was quite pleasant and light, perfect for the mood of the table given the long car trip.  I always appreciate when a wait staff can read their customers and have a good command over their wine list.\n\nThere were three of us at the table, I had the gnocchi, my girlfriend had Linguine con Vongole e Cozze, minus the mussles (this took a little bit of a struggle to get figured out, I think the guys first language was actually Italian, and we were' sure what the word for Mussels was), and our other companion had Chicken Parm (i tried to steer him to something more authentic but he was happy with his dish; who am I fault him, I love a good chicken parm).\n\nEveryone was very pleased, though I can only personally speak to my own dish.  The Gnocchi. It was, hands down, one of the best gnocchi dishes I've ever had.  The sauce was good, mixed in with some fresh melted mozzarella (really good stuff), but that wasn't what stood out.  It was the pasta itself; in a word, sublime.  They were these little pillowy dumplings, soft with the right hint of chew to them, but they almost seemed to melt over your tongue.  I just ate, and just thinking about it is making my mouth water and I'm getting hungry all over again.\n\nI could keep going on about this place, but the best way for you to understand is to just go there. Tonight, if possible. Thoroughly enjoyed myself, and will definitely be going back there.", "author": "Christopher G."}

We ordered Ravioli di Salsiccia and a pepperoni pizza, but they were just.... average. For the ravioli, the sauce was really good, but the ravioli itself wasn't cooked very well.

The food (when it's right) is delicious, but it's inconsistent and the servers are horrible (the bussers are wonderful, though). \n\nA few nights ago, my husband and I stopped by for a nice dinner. I ordered my usual...eggplant parm. I have this every time we go...I can't even count how many times I've enjoyed it. The other night, the eggplant was nearly raw...it's was still crunchy. When the server came by, I told him the problem. He didn't even take the dish away, but went and checked with the kitchen. He came back and told me they said it had been cooked the right way and the same as any other, fried then baked. I told him I had had it several times at their restaurant and he said he couldn't do anything about it. I asked for a menu to order something else. He had the hostess bring the menu and he NEVER CAME BACK. I shared my husband's meal and the server never even brought the check. We left some cash (for the one shared dish) and left. It was ridiculous.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be going back to our favorite Italian restaurant; we'll try another on Columbus.

Did some browsing for Italian places while bf was driving and we all decided on a place that was actually around the corner (see review for Franchino) We were treated extremely poorly there before even being seated so we left and wandered in to this place, which is close by.\n\nThe service was exceptional. Our waiter was very attentive and warm. When we asked for a wine recommendation, he offered wines that varied in price, instead of the cheapest on the menu. This is important to me because even though the place looked very nice, we did not. After a weekend in Tahoe, we definitely were not in our Sunday best, but the waiter did not make assumptions. We settled on a mid-priced bottle of Pinot Grigio (I don't recall the brand) that was very tasty. My only complaints would be that the waiter was almost too attentive at times, but it was a slow Sunday night, and Italian appeared to be his first language, so at times it was a touch difficult to communicate. Both very small details that did not effect the night.\n\nFood was very good. I had the Linguine with clams and mussels, although I asked for it without mussels. Not a fan. This took a minute to convey to the waiter, as I did not know the Italian word for mussels. Simple dish but made very well. Pasta and clams were cooked perfectly. It was tossed in a white wine sauce with to,tomatoes. Bf had the gnocchi which were super light and fluffy. Probably the best I have had. Jesse S. had Chicken Parmesan which looked tasty but I did not try.\n\nAtmosphere was classy but inviting. Everything was very clean and kept. Well decorated.

After today's experience they get a solid 1.  Went here for a late lunch on my birthday.  Sat outside, and ordered fairly quickly.  (2 apps, 2 entrees, plus drinks) so at this point were spending about 100 dollars.  Our appetizers and food came out at exactly the same time.  When the server saw what happened he sent the entrees back to the kitchen and was like sorry guys they shouldn't have made everything together like that.  Annoyed, but not thinking it's the end of the world we continue eating.  Now the food runners are hovering around our table waiting for us to eat our apps to try and drop our food ASAP before it died in the window.  Additionally, twice, in a less than 5 minute period we were asked \"are u ready for your food now?\" Now I'm getting annoyed.  We're spending 100 bucks on my bday to sit and enjoy a nice meal outside on a beautiful day and now we are being rushed and racing against the clock for our food to not dry up in the kitchen heat Windows.  After the second attempt to drop our food, I decided to say something.  At this point it had been about 10 minutes.  I told the server that we were taking our time eating the apps and I would like it if the meals were made fresh.  (We both ordered pasta dishes.) he guaranteed they would be.  After then a third attempt to drop our food, I decided to say something to the manager. I went to the host and asked if their was a manager available, and she said no.  No manager was there and that any issues could be handled by the server.  Odd, so there's no manger on a Saturday night? Strange but ok.  She asked what was happening and I briefly told her.  Her response was well let me see what I can do.  I see her go to the kitchen, the server and food runners are now very obviously discussing what happened while pointing and gawking in our direction.  She's comes back out and is like their going to remake them.  Ok fine, we keep munching on the apps again trying to enjoy the afternoon outside.  When we finally finished our apps, our food came out immediately.  Apps plates taken food dropped right away, seemed a bit suspicious to me.  I don't think anything was remade.  The food was a HUGE disappointment.  Considering we are semi regulars we know what the normal quality of the food is and this was terrible.  Very, very obviously the food was not remade but rather \"freshened up\" with some new sauce, and maybe a quick saut\u00e9 in a pan.  I've worked in restaurants for many years of my life and know all the tricks of the trade.  The meals must have been sitting in the heat window for an absolute minimum of 15 mins.  No one came and asked how our meals were until we were about half way done.  At this point I didn't want to continue to complain so we just lied and said it was fine.  Our bill was 93 dollars and what a shitty experience it was.  Not a 100 dollar meal or service worthy.  Not a good birthday experience.   The staff seemed like they couldn't care any less.  Plenty and I mean plenty of other places is north beach to visit.  This one you can skip.", "author": "Jared P."}

The host was so hilarious and charming in his thick Italian accent; it seriously made our meal exponentially more enjoyable! The ambiance was great--could either be romantic or fun for a groups of friends! I came with 3 other girls and we were seated immediately when we walked in (around 7:30 on a Friday night). \n\nORDERED:\n\n[Veal Lasagna]: I normally stray away from ordering lasagna when I go out just because I think it's so ordinary and I want to try other things. But thanks to a quick tip on Yelp, I decided to just go with it. It was delicious! No regrets. The meat sauce was so flavorful and the layers of cheese between the flat noodles really brought everything together. It didn't look like a lot at first, but that dish really filled me up! Yum!\n\n[Gnocchi sorrentino]: Someone else ordered this, and a word about gnocchi...do not be fooled by what looks like a small amount of these fluffy potato dumplings. They're pretty dense and delicious!\n\n[Linguine with clams]: I forget what the official name of this is...and it actually looked more like spaghetti than linguine, but I had a bite of my friend's pasta. Now, I don't like clams much, but I think if you're a big clam lover (like my friend who ordered this is) you'll love this one. There were so many clams in her dish, she said she had a harder time finding pasta than clams! And the noodles themselves were very well-flavored--like they were infused with ocean. Personally, it's not my go to dish, but I know there are many clam lovers out there =)\n\n[Minestrone soup]: Not going to lie, I literally only had the carrots of this soup (because my girl friend didn't like carrots) and just from eating those, the soup tasted delicious. If carrots could taste that good, the soup must have been amazing. \n\nWe had a great time here, and the Italian host really made our night more memorable and enjoyable. After taking a picture for us, he tried selling my camera to the next table for $4. hahah...what a charmer. I'd come back for more =) \n\nThe only minus I think would be the bread...I love me some good bread, (yes, pre-carbohydrate overload) and their bread was just okay. Price-wise, it's what you'd expect for dinner at any ordinary Italian place, and maybe a little more since it's SF and there's those health taxes and whatever...but the experience and food made up for it for sure!

I will go off of what my bf said when we came here on the 22nd.  The service from Fausto was awful. We were ignored a lot of the time.  As we sat down I noticed a dirty fork.  My bf didn't get his coke until he reminded our waiter.  We were never asked how our food was, which wasn't anything to write home about.  My potatoes were slightly undercooked and the salmon was ok.  He forgot about our appetizer and then blamed the chef for losing our ticket.  If our waiter had been more attentive he would have noticed our missing appetizer.  Never were we asked for refills either.  The extra staff who brought our food out, and the bus boys were more helpful than Fausto.  Overall it was a big let down and don't think we'll be returning.", "author": "Renee P."}

Next, order their appetizer platter that comes with cheeses, and Italian meats, with a bottle of amorne cesari.  After that if you love sea food order their linguine pescatore.

Ever. \n\nFirst off, the dark haired hostess that stands outside like a street walker on the corner needs to wipe the bitc*h off her face and get some personality. She walks around like her ish don't stink. She doesn't smile, talk or anything. She didn't greet us at all. Just took a look at me and my friend, looked us up and down and grabbed two menus and pointed at a table to walk to. Really? She didn't even smile or say Your waiter will be right with you or anything. And after she sat us, she walked right back outside to the street corner. Seriously, is the owner her daddy or something where she can actually get away with that kind of behavior???\n\nAnd now for the waiter.....oh where to start. He was some older guy, never seen him before, very broken English...but he criticized every single thing we ordered. First it was our drinks. He didn't like the fact that I only ordered an iced tea and he really didn't like the fact that my friend was a guy and ordering a Long Island Iced Tea. He insinuated it wasn't a manly drink and shook his head in disbelief. WTF? Then when I ordered the steak he said Can I prepare that for you medium rare? And I said No, I would like it well done. And he gasps in horror, says Oh no you can't eat it that way, and then says to my friend Tell her she can't eat it that way! She won't get the flavor! I said I want my steak cooked well done, no less. I've been eating steak for 30 years; I think I know how I like it cooked. But he couldn't stop there. He just kept pestering me over and over about how wrong I was for getting it well done. Whatever dude. Keep your comments to yourself. So anyways, on top of that the service wasn't that great. Kept having to ask for drink refills, bread refills, etc. \n\nOur salad starters were not very good at all. We got house salads with the house dressing....my advice? Pass on that. Overpriced for that cruddy salad and there is plenty of free bread to snack on before your meal. The steak was OK. I liked the sauce they cooked it in but it was very fatty and only came with a tiny few veggies, like two carrots and two of something else. Not really worth the $30 spent. Dessert was so so. I had the chocolate mouse and it was probably the highlight of my meal. Needless to say, this place has gone downhill. I'm so disappointed because it used to be so great but it seems none of the same waiters are there anymore and the new hostess has a real bug up her butt.", "author": "Dusty N."}

We didn't find anything, but I did find Adam E., who pointed us in the direction of this great little place! Thanks dude!\n\nMy date and I waited 15 minutes for our table but it wasn't a big deal because there was plenty of room at the bar. The bartender was a cool guy, and also very honest (he steered me away from some trendy pomegranate drink to a classic - and delicious - gin fizz). He also didn't *really* make fun of me for downing 3 glasses of water the second I sat down. \n\nWe were seated outdoors, and while it did take a while for everything to arrive, it was all on point:\n\nInsalata Caprese - can't go wrong with a classic, mozzarella, basil and tomato salad, and this particular version was drizzled with pesto, which I thought was a nice way to tie all the flavors together. I would have liked more grilled bread on the side, but it was great nonetheless. \n\nCapasante al Prosciutto - I make it a point to order any incarnation of scallops wrapped in salty meat whenever it's available, and this version did not disappoint. I had about 6 or 7 prosciutto-wrapped scallops on my plate, sauteed in wine and butter, and even though that doesn't sound like much, it filled me up. I ordered sauteed veggies to offset the rich saltiness of the seafood and meat. \n\nFiletto al Pepe Verde - this is what my date ordered, filet mignon served with sauteed veggies and garlic-rosemary roasted potatoes. This was just about the most perfect steak we both had in a very long time.\n\nI would come back again!

This Owner, Giovanni, is loud & coarse, like a guy with a grapple dragging you into the place!. Atmosphere is good. Service was good. The minute we received our horrible entrees, and complained, the \"owner\" Giovanni was no where to be found. He had convinced my sister that the spinach salad with fresh orange slices, homemade lemon vinegarette dressing was the freshest and fabulous. The spinach was cut, had black edges on some of the leaves!, canned oranges, Italian dressing! 2 of us ordered angel hair pasta, tossed in Olive oil, fresh diced tomatoes, fresh basil, twice!, couldn't get it!, got some stuff with a red sauce and tiny tomato pieces, definitely not fresh. My Caesar salad was supposed to have shaved parmesan cheese, homemade dressing, etc., not the case, knew I might be in trouble when it arrived with cherry tomatoes around the edges. I ordered Veal Masala, never in my entire life have I ever had a worse presentation or food quality. It was a pre-packaged, breaded veal cutlet, drowned in something resembling Frenches canned gravy with canned mushrooms and a touch of Masala stirred in!  It was just awful! Denny's could do a better job!. The Veal Parm. was awful too, tough. Even if it was pre-packaged by the Sysco food purveyors, it would have been better!\nMy sister left the table, sat outside in a chair by the front door and told everyone who walked up to the restaurant, they were making a huge mistake. That same dark haired girl with the attitude tried to get her to leave, didn't work...ha ha! We were originally going to Tony's, it was already 8PM, Tony's had a 2-1/2 hour wait, so we decided to try some other place, huge mistake, a complete waste of money.

The night started off well.  Our waiter cracked some pretty funny jokes at the beginning and took our order for appetizers and drinks.  He delivered the first round quickly and appetizers soon followed.  But then he forgot about us.  He never took our dinner order and never came back to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks.  So we sat there...and sat there...and sat there with just our water being refilled.  We finally asked for our check and about 20 minutes later we got it.  Ten minutes later, the bus boy ran our bill.  Then the waiter came back and tried to humor us, but it was too late, we never ordered a main course.  He wasn't funny anymore and I wondered how a restaurant on prime real-estate could have such crappy service.\n\nThe food itself was mixed.  The calamari was served luke warm and more gummy than it should've been.  The balsamic portabello was excellent.  And the mussels and clam appetizer was meh.\n\nBottom line?

I have been to quite a few over the years and found them all to be, well, kind of - fine.  But I loved Trattoria Pinocchio!\n\nIt was a slow day in North Beach with gorgeous, un-San Francisco-like weather in the upper 70s.  I had some out of town guests here and I was showing them the San Francisco staples.  I had been at places across the street both ways and thought they were fine, but wasn't dying to do back, figured we'd give this place a whirl.\n\nSO glad we did!  We had been all over the Bay for a few days ordering way too much food so we decided to order a sandwich and Gnocci and split them both 3 ways.  Plus some bellinis.  The bellinis were a hit...just what we needed at noon on a Thursday!\n\nThe waiter was a kind italian gentleman who was just attentive enough and seemed happy to be at work for the day.\n\nThen came the gnocchi....My true test of great italian is Gnocci and red sauce.  Oh my goodness...the gnocchi melts in your mouth.  They are big and fluffily and freaking-amazing.  We had them with gorgonzola.  We didn't have the red sauce so I can't tell you about that.  We also had the proscuitto and mozzarella a sandwich which was also delish!\n\nI am so glad I don't have to keep looking for a great italian place in North Beach...this will be my staple for a while (but I do need to go back to Mona Lisa, which I tried a long time ago - which lead to my torrid love-affair with pumpkin ravioli - yum).", "author": "Stacey C."}

Our waiter did everything correct at first, by taking my order first and so on....\n\nWe had ordered the Calamari Fritti (light deep fried calamari with a side of spicy marinara sauce) it was ok, just like fried calamari, nothing special about it.Linguine al Pesto Giovanni(Chef's housemade basil, pine nuts, parmigiano & garlic sauce)I liked it because I just got braces and the noodles were soft enough for me to eat.Linguine del Pescatore(mussels, clams, calamari, prawns & fresh fish in garlic tomato sauce)I was told that the center of the mussels were cold and the clams were gritty and still had sand in them.Vanilla Creme Brule(Our classic vanilla custard w/caramelized sugar crust)I can't comment on that because I didn't order that.\n\nFor me,I ate less than half of my meal because the noodles kept getting stuck in my braces. So I decided to take the remaining of my food to go. When the waiter came, I had told him that I wanted my food to go and he said ok and started to clean the table. When the waiter attempted to gather all of the dishes, he dropped a fork and it almost landed on my friend!! When I noticed that he had put two used  plates on my food,I reminded him that I wanted my food to go. The waiter  looked at me and said \"oh shit\" and continued to clean. When he came back, he said \"you don't want that food still? Right?\" I said no because you put dirty dishes in my food. Then he said that he could give me a dessert and I declined because I wanted the rest of my dinner. At that point I was shocked that he had the nerve to ask me if I wanted dessert instead asking me if he could remake my dinner. I could honestly say, he never asked me if I would like them to remake my dinner. Now I know it didn't cost that much to make my dinner, not because the ingredients are cheap but because they have cheap labors. \n\nWhen we received the bill, we noticed that he  didn't comp my meal or anything on the bill. As soon as we slipped a credit card with the bill, the waiter came right away to charge us. After he charged the credit card, he said that he overcharged us and had to void the first transaction.

We had to wait a bit for the bread to arrive, and the food came out pretty quickly after ordering. \n\nI can see why.  I ordered the Steak and Portabella, which was cooked perfectly and tasted great, but about half of it was wasted because it was so fatty I could not eat it.  The potatoes were home-style and the only thing italian about them was the overkill on the italian seasoning dumped on.  The vegetables were so overcooked, the brocolli was grey (not kidding).  The bok choy was grainy, which means it wasnt washed enough.  \n\nWhen the waiter came to take my plate, I mentioned this to him, in which his response was \"if you had told me earlier, I could have sent it back\". Uh, helllloo, if you had not been so busy flirting with the girls at the table next to mine and checked in on our table,  I may have had a chance!  \n\nFortunatley, the birthday boy had a fabulous dinner, he had the risotto w/lobster.

I still have no idea how we ended up here, but it's always been one of my favorites.\n\nAlthough who my company has been has changed each time I've come here, there is one item I always get- the polenta with bolognese sauce.  If you don't know what polenta is, it's basically grits.  If you don't know what grits are, well, I don't know what to tell you.  Growing up in Nevada, I shouldn't really know what grits are, but somehow I do.  I found out about polenta from my italian stepfather (or mom's husband #2), and Pinocchio makes it better than most other places, I've found.\n\nThe rest of the menu is pretty extensive for italian food (being Irish, I'm not really the expert), and I always find a wine I like.  The entrees are always delicious, and the portions are good.  The creme brulee and tiramisu were divine.

Among the endless options among the authentic Italian feel of the neighborhood, we stumbled upon Trattoria Pinocchio.\n\nThe outdoor seating which allows you to sit next to your girlfriend without the social stigma of being \"same side sitters\" was a nice touch.  The pasta was homemade and the bread was outstanding.  I got the gorganzola gnocchi and my girlfriend ordered the linguini fruitte de mare.  The flavor was explosive and the portion size was solid.  I dropped a star because the prices were high (about $18-$25 per entree) for what you are getting.  I dropped the second star because the service lacked some warmth.  There was a really good server also overseeing some tables which I had hoped we had, because ours was disengaged and seemed like he was having a rough day.  Normally this wouldn't be such a big deal, but at a romantic outdoor Italian bistro I've come to expect the service and ambiance to count just as much as the quality of the food.\n\nOverall a pretty memorable part of our day, but Trattoria Pinocchio won't likely be on our short list of ongoing dinner spots.", "author": "Joseph Z."}

We were offered outdoor seating which provided us with great people watching. There were heat lamps to keep us warm on a chilly night. \n\nThe server was borderline rude when we asked for wine suggestions. He said \"it depends what you like. a wine is a wine and you might like it or not.\" Seriously? No recommendations for your extensive wine list? Dude: you didn't even take the time to ask for our preference to give a proper recommendation. \n\nWhen we ordered our selection and asked for it to be decanted, instead of saying yes, he spouted that there is a fee for it and questioned our request. We had ordered a $50 wine.  Dude: You could have played that a little better. I think the cost was around $2. You could have said, \"just so you're aware, we charge a minimal fee\". It was a little embarassing to question us over it. \n\nWhen he brought the decanted wine over to our table, it splashed onto my guest's shirt!  Dude: you could have at LEAST comp'd the $2 fee for that stain. \n\nFortunately, the owner (or so the hostess told us) came by our table to say hello. I think he may have recognized my guest. He was very personable and made a good impression on us. I don't know if this had anything to do with the poor service we had received prior to meeting him. However, he wasn't there to apologize or anything so I'm not sure. \n\nOnto the food: \nThe complimentary bread wasn't anything special. I guess I'm spoiled by the amazing bakeries in San Francisco because I found the bread basket to be dull and a little stale. \n\nThe Antipasti platter was fantastic with a variety of delicious cured meats, cheeses, olives, and carby treats. \n\nWhen I decided to go out for Italian food in North Beach, I was on a mission to have Linguine with clams. The Linguine con Vongole e Cozze hit the spot! I ordered mine with all clams and they  happily accommodated my request. \n\nFor dessert, we split the tiramisu and it was one of the best I've ever had. \n\nOverall assessment: The service we received really spoiled what could have been a great meal. I feel that it's generous to give three stars but the food was really good.", "author": "Colleen W."}

Always wanted to try Mama's but it was over 1 1/2 hour wait so we just strolled through the North Beach area and wanted to try the brunch at Pinocchio. We had been there for dinner once, about 2-3 years ago but don't remember what we had but I must have liked it otherwise I would have make a note to myself to never come back :)  We originally planned to order brunch for us and the kids but after reading the reviews, I changed my order to pasta. I went for Linguine with calamari in a tomato based sauce. It was very good. The pasta was super fresh and cooked perfectly and the calamari as well. The kids had a taste of my dish too so we gobbled it all up within a few minutes. The hubby kept his brunch order and ordered an omelette with smoked salmon and blue cheese. That wasn't really great, just average. The kids had eggs with sausage patty and potatoes - typical breakfast item so nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nIf you are gonna go to an italian restaurant, go for the pasta, don't settle for their brunch special, it might be less pricey than their pasta dishes (which is more pricey) but it will make you leave with wanting more. They have an extensive pasta menu so you are sure to find something of your liking in there. I did! I gave it 4 * because a little on the pricey side...and I am not taking into account their brunch \"specials\". \n\nWill attempt to recreate this dish at home so wish me luck!!", "author": "Xuan P."}

Until Saturday. \n\nMy friend and I stumbled on to this place while walking down Columbus, and when the hostess told us there was a 10 minute wait for a table for 2,  we decided to give this place a try, and wait for a table.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait. \n\n35 minutes later, when I finally went up to the hostess to remind her that we do exist, she was apologetic but unable to do anything - 5 more minutes, she said. \n\nFine. \n\nSo we wait. \n\nAnother 13 minutes. \n\nFinally, we see her signalling the waitress for our table. The waitress then goes up to another couple who came 20 minutes after we did! Thankfully the hostess quickly went up to her and re-directed her to us. \n\nOnce seated (another mis-hap there! We were about to be seated at one of the tables, when the owner, yells! \"not that table!\", and then makes us change our tables), the waiter was abrupt and sort of surly. We get our drinks quickly enough, but when we ask for water - we're given water in plastic cups!  A bit stunned, I stopped the hostess who was walking by and asked her if this is normal - and she had the grace to apologize but did not take any steps to rectify the situation. Apparently, when they have too many customers, they sometimes run out of glasses...okayie then...\n\nOur food comes, and admittedly, my pasta carbonara was one of the best I've had (which is why they get the second star). My friend's meat ravioli in walnut cream sauce tasted bland, but a dash of salt and pepper and she decided to just let it be, so we could eat and get out of there. Big mistake. That night, she had a mild case of food poisoning. \n\nWhen it was time to leave, the waiter came by to give us our cheque, and was really gracious then (guess it's time for the tip? :)) \n\n\nTwo stars: one for the bartender who was really friendly, was helpful and polite, and one for my entree. Both really fantastic. \n\nCons:  the overall service really spoilt the evening for us.

We were not kids \"bar hopping\" or partying, just a group of low-key adults wanting to sit and enjoy a few glasses of decent wine in the freakishly nice weather. I should also mention this was about 3pm, which is a \"dead' time for most restaurants and Pinnochios looked to be no exception.  \n\nI worked for years in the restaurant industry and there is no excuse for this kind of rude behavior. Not to mention the total lack of business sense--we would have ordered two or three bottles of wine at least--our bill would have easily been in the triple digits and at a huge margin.They turned away very easy income (are you reading this, owner of Pinnochios?) from a nearly- empty restaurant. \n\nWe went next door to cafe grecco instead. Not the same wine selection but they were happy to serve us, which was far more important at that point. \n\nThe \"poetic justice\" footnote: after we left cafe grecco, we walked past \"our\" table at Pinnochios again. Empty, and there have not been enough time for someone to eat and leave since we left. I hope the empty table left a nice tip. We would have.", "author": "Christy B."}

At first, the place seemed promising, because there was standard Italian fare and also brunch options on the menu.\n\nThe restaurant received its first strike (an unforgivable one at that) when we received a spoiled milk latte.  Yuck.  You can imagine how disgusting that dairy concoction tasted.\n\nStrike two came with the receipt of the bread basket, complete with slices of stale French bread and pats of margarine.  Margarine at an Italian restaurant???  Are you kidding me?  We all passed at the trans-fat goodness placed in front of us.\n\nYet another strike (and yes, that would be strike three) came when our food arrived (after quite the wait), and one of the entrees had incorrectly prepared food.  It's not as though we asked for some substitution--rather, we simply ordered one of their brunch options, and they couldn't even make it in accordance with the descriptions provided on the menu.  When we pointed that fact out to the server, rather than leave the entree and return with that portion of the dish, properly prepared, he took the entire plate and left without barely saying a word, leaving one of my brunch companions salivating with hunger as he stared at the rest of us eat.\n\nThree strikes, you're out.", "author": "Alexis N."}

The staff at Pinocchio's is kind and welcoming and their food is delicious! \n\nUsually for lunch, I am more of a sandwich/salad person, so I tried their Mediterraneo panini and house salad and it was fresh and filling. The panini had tomatoes, mozzarella, olive oil, and basil on it. Very simple yet tasty and the salad was fresh and light. Another time I have come here for lunch, I had pasta - I had their cheese ravioli with marinara sauce and it was so good! I definitely recommend both. I also like that they serve brunch and also have a separate lunch menu from their huge list of entrees.\n\nThey also have a full bar if you are in the mood for a drink!

This place is amazing.\nFirst of all, it's part inside and outside dining.  What I mean is that the outside walls of the restaurant are made of glass and they actually open up to the sidewalk.  Everything from the drinks, appetizers, salad and main dish were very very good.  For dinner I had the best seafood linguini ever.  Nothing even comes close.\nI have never been to Italy.

Unlike many of the other Italian places around, the wait is almost non-existent. I was not feeling very patient and waiting 45 minutes elsewhere so we decided to give the food a try.\n\nWhile walking in, a man outside started serenading people to come for a meal.  That should have wowed me but glancing around inside, it feels cliche. It was a little on the late side and we weren't too hungry so we ordered a bottle of wine and created a pizza.\n\nWe put together a gorgonzola, artichoke heart and prosciutto pizza which surprisingly turned out nicely. We could only eat a piece each but managed to gurgle down the wine easily. Of course.\n\nThe service was decent and when it came time to pay for the bill our server was quick to the punch.

We were on a Cable Car and asked where do the locals go for really good Italian? We were told the The Stinking Rose. My sister piped in \"oh yeah my friend at work said we should go there, it was SO good\". Without hesitation we asked for directions. We took the bus down Columbus from our hotel as far as we could go. We started walking and most of the restaurants on Columbus have outside seating. So as we are walking we can see what everyone is serving, and the smells Divine. \n\nWe walk past Trattoria Pinocchio and the food looked amazing, we stopped and glanced at the menu and thought it might be pricey for lunch. We continued on to the Stinking Rose. Mind you all of the restaurants were pretty busy. We arrived at the Rose and it was dead, the menu looked blah and the prices were the same as Trattoria Pinocchio. The icing was when another guest came out while we were looking at the menu and said \"don't eat here it's not very good\". Game over we went back up Columbus to Trattoria Pinocchio. \n\nSOOOO glad we did. \n\nWe started with Carpaccio prime beef tenderloin, arugula, shaved parmigiano, capers, truffle oil & grilled bread & Margherita pizza fresh tomatoes, basil & extra virgin olive. Delizioso! \n\nMy sister ordered a bloody mary that she demanded I try, I don't like bloody mary's now I do damn that was good! I had to get a couple of my own yes I'm on vacation people! \n\nI had the Ossobuco braised veal shank served with saffron risotto & saut\u00e9ed vegetables, my taste buds love me soo. This was the best Ossobuco I have had since it was home made for me. \n\nMy sis had Tortellini alla Boscaiola meat tortellini with peas, mushrooms & prosciutto in a cream sauce. Outstanding choice. \n\nMy mother had Ravioli di Salsiccia Our house made sausage ravioli served with a porcini cream sauce. Amazing! \n\nWe all shared with each other and had a fantastic meal, we sat outside it was a beautiful day. Our fob (translation fresh off boat) Italian waiter was a shit but we didn't care the food came quickly and it was incredible. He just had a funky attitude like we were beneath him or something. That's fine we tipped accordingly. He will soon learn how you make a buck in the US. \n\nI would give it more than 5 stars but that is all they let us do on yelp!

I was full and delighted as I made my way back to the hotel for the evening.  \n\nThe second time I came I had been living here for a couple months and was so excited to finally get to take some else here.  I brought my mom here for an afternoon lunch on Friday in November.  We sat outside on the sidewalk, enjoyed a glass of wine and order an appetizer of Bruschetta.

It would be a picture of Pinocchio with his nose extending all the way down the block, and a speech bubble beside his head, saying, \"The food is delicious here!\"  It would be appropriate, as only a real liar would say such a thing.\n \nThree of us went to dinner here the other night. We wanted to go to Pulcinella, which may have the best Italian   food in the area, but they were closed.  I have tried, since our visit, to try and think of ways to bump my review up to 2 stars, but it isn't possible. \nShame on these people for ripping off tourists with their horrible food.(I refuse to believe that any locals frequent this place).\n\nWe were really hungry.  They did seat us and take our orders right away. Each entree was hovering at around 17-25 dollars. The waiter may have been Italian, I don't know or care, but he certainly was playing the part of an Italian..dancing around and singing O Sole Mio..(didn't impress us, but whatever.)\n\nTwo of us ordered chicken parm entrees. The menu said that  we could get it with either mixed veggies or pasta but the waiter said it would be much easier for them to make pasta as it was late...so fine. They brought us some cold, hard, tough bread with cold butter. We didn't eat much of it.  When the entrees  arrived,  and I am using tactful language here, they were over-salted and had sauce from cans..no love or care in its presentation. Had it been 4 dollars I would have just thought \"ok--it's bad, but it's cheap\", but this was bad and expensive..The pasta was overcooked and the sauce on it tasted canned.  I'm Italian. I cook a lot. I know canned sauce when I am unfortunate enough to taste it.  \n\nMy Girlfriend got the Pizza Margherita. It was smothered in globs and globs of cheese that looked and tasted like the cheapest possible product they could get their hands on . It was flavored heavily with sage and lots and lots, and LOTS of salt. There were flavorless, unripe diced tomatoes and green herb flakes sprinkled all over the top.. yuck.(I tried it and all night long I felt as if I had drunk a glass of salt)  She couldn't eat more than one piece. When the busser came to remove our \"finished\" plates and saw the not-eaten pizza they didn't ask her if she wanted it to go; they must have known how terrible it was.  They simply don't serve good quality Italian food and they know it. This place is EXPENSIVE and what you get is  embarrassing!!  If I were to open a place and serve this kind of fare  to people I would be ashamed. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and  avoid this place, unless you really don't care what you are eating or how much you are spending---or unless you want to hear the shameless waiter singing and dancing IN YOUR FACE for his tips as the swill they serve up is being brought to your table.\n\nRemember folks,  in literature, Pinocchio is a well known fib teller. Don't believe him when he says that the food is good here! Go to Pulcinella's. Or Gepetto's...or Mcdonald's.. Or skip dinner and go to sleep early. You won't be missing anything.

The service was good, wine selection was good but the food was disappointing. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, it looked good when the plate arrived but the chicken was tough and rubbery, I hardly ate any of it. It is probably the worst chicken parmigiana I've ever had. The prices were ok, not too expensive so I guess you get what you pay for. Thankfully we had a bottle of wine and a salad so I wasn't starving. But considering how many awesome Italian restaurants there are in SF, you should def skip this. My husband had the ravioli's and said they weren't that great. Oh well.", "author": "Kimberly R."}

Don't just order a single plate.  Order a primi then a secondi (share plates if you want, no problem), and whatever you do, do not skip the dessert.  It's all good.

I'm always fighting with myself on whether to do caffeine or alcohol. Their kitchen is pretty open and it always surprises me how little Italian kitchens are and how efficient they are despite there only being 1 or 2 cooks to execute a bulky menu of items. The only bad thing that I can say about Pinocchio's is that out of all of my visits there was only 1 time when I received absent minded service. \n\nOn one of my visits I  went with my friend Rebecca and while the food was great. We waited a really long time between courses and our drinks were left unfilled. We then left without anyone noticing. It was so bad that I told my friend not to leave a tip. Atrocious I know but it was THAT bad. Embarrassingly enough my gal pal left her wallet in the restaurant and had to go back. She said that the whole staff apologized for their oversight.

I know, this is quite a task, but we weren't yet starving, and felt up to it. We walked around and around and around looking at menus looking in windows to get a feel for the atmosphere, and alas the long search brought our weary feet (and now empty tummies) to Trattoria Pinoccio. It fit the bill in 3 main areas: 1. they had a great, varied menu 2. the light was dim (perhaps not quite dim enough for our taste) 3. they could seat us shortly (approx. 15 min.)\n\nWe ordered the beef carpaccio to start. This is one of my favorite dishes, if done right, and let me say, it quite frequently isn't done right. T.P. made the BEST carpaccio I have ever had. Perfectly chilled (not fresh from the ice box, as it often is) It had a healthy amount of lemon juice, capers and parmesan sprinkled on it, and to boot, truffle oil. Oh happy day! My sweetie got the puttanesca, which was just exactly what he was craving and I got the spaghetti carbonara: divine. The preparation of the carbonara is exactly how it is meant to be done. The pasta perfectly al dente, the sauce, cheese and bacon perfectly coating every noodle. My mouth is watering as I type. We ate too much pasta, so we were unable to order desert.

She kept demanding that we stand by the door, even though that meant we were in people's way. It was embarrassing and awkward, not to mention disrespectful on her part. Anyway, we sat down, ordered, got our food, which was good but not mind blowing for $80, and the same woman kept eyeing our table to see if we were going to order the bill. We did, and paid the bill + the tip, and for the next 5-10 minutes while we finished up, I kept noticing her looking at our table as if to say, it's time for you to go.

I eat out a lot and I used to be a server so I understand that sometimes being a server is difficult but in this instance there was no excuse. \n\nWe had made a reservation for 8:30 and arrived at 8:37 and they did not have our table ready. So the hostess asked us if we could wait outside at one of the tables until they did get our table ready. We all sat outside for about 5 minutes until the hostess came outside and asked us if we could move out of the table so she could sit another party at the table even though A. she asked us to sit there and B. there was another table empty right next to us. I was very shocked.\n\nFinally 10 minutes after we arrived we were seated(even though we had a reservation). Once we sat down it took another 8 minutes just for us to be greeted by and our server who had already  walked by us twice without a word. When he finally came to the table he still didn't really greet us no name or anything just asked us what we wanted to drink. \n\nFrom the time we placed our drinks to the time our drinks arrived took 9 minutes (yes i timed it i don't usually but with such a bad start i felt that i needed to). The drinks were all ordered with expensive liquor and all poured with cheap liquor. Two of my friends out of five of us actually enjoyed there drinks but the rest of us were not impressed at all. Twenty minutes after we were seated at the table bread was delivered to the table. Yeah the stuff that should be dropped off 2 minutes after you are seated with the waters which we had to ask for. \n\nWhen he delivered our drinks he took our food order we ordered the bruschetta and the mushrooms for appetizers. They took 17 minutes to come out they are pretty brainless dishes it should maybe take 10 minutes. The bruschetta was ok but the mushrooms were disgusting COVERED like I've never tasted with balsamic vinegar. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our entrees to come out I made the mistake of going to the restroom, the ladies room was semi clean but their was no toilet paper and I was told the mens room was really awful.  Also while i was standing in line to wait for the one-person bathroom i watched one of the cooks pick up a chip dip it in salsa eat it then resume right back to work. Did not wash his hands didn't even wipe them off on his pants.\n\nWhen our entrees finally arrived 22 minutes after our appetizers they were definitely not worth the wait. For one thing my friends risotto was seen sitting under the lamp for at least 10 minutes. YUCK. I tried her risotto and even if it had been warm it would have tasted gross I can't even describe the taste but it wasn't a good one. I split the manicotti with my b/f it was ok but for an italian restaurant i expected better. The gnocci was actually pretty good I mean i guess they finally got something right. \n\nOverall the service food and drinks were awful.

The waiter was very friendly and helpful.  We had the following:\n\nbowl of minestrone (6.50) - it was good and hot, that's important\n\ncappellini al pomodoro ($12.95) - it was al dente and that's hard for cappellini.  simple but very flavorful.\n\nseafood ink taglitele ($19.95) - that was the pasta special of the day, this was very flavorful with a nice smokey flavor.  It is one of the better ink pasta we've tried. \n\nPoached pear al chocolate ($7) - this was delicious!  The pear was not soggy but still has a nice texture but the chocolate was fantastic.

Eventually he came over and said he didn't notice me, but that's not really true since I was in the corner of both their eyes. Additionally he has other customers so if you're spending all your time chatting with staff you're not going to notice them trying to flag you down. I think he tried to play catch up after I was a bit grumpy about that and because he waited until the kitchen was closing to start putting orders in, which I think rushed the chefs.  \n\nI opted for their special which was a fish dish which was done reasonably well and a salad which had good presentation. I would say the food is slightly overpriced although there was nothing wrong with it.

I should have known that our experience would not be a good one as soon as I was seated.  Shortly after a family was seated next to us and I was surprised that they were offered water and asked for their order before us. \n\n We eventually were asked for our order and I looked over to my husband and suggested sharing an entree.  To my surprise the waiter gave me a disapproving look.  We decided to order drinks and the Carpaccio as appetizer and told the waiter we needed more time to decide on the entree.\n\n Feeling a bit intimidated in the prospect of ordering a shared entree and thinking maybe it's not appropriate to order an entree to share,  we decided we would order two dishes once the appetizer is served.  So while we were enjoying our drinks and  getting  pretty hungry we realized the appetizer was taking longer than we thought and we had  no bread on our table.  I looked over at the family beside us and they had bread so I thought that the bus boy just forgot.  No one was around for me to ask so since I had to go to the ladies room any way  I decided to ask on my way there.   I tried to gain the attention of the waiter who ignored me twice.  I decided to ask to the bus boy who replied that the reason he didn't bring the bread was because we had not ordered our meal.  I was shocked and told him we ordered drinks and appetizer and awaiting to order the entree. He turned away to get some when I noticed he was complaining to the waiter about it. \n\nThe bus boy brought the bread and I said \"as you can see we ordered drinks and appetizer so is there a problem\" and he answered \"yes\".  At this point my husband wanted to leave but we had already ordered the appetizer.  As it turns out the bread was stale and finally our Carpaccio was served.  I then asked the waiter why the bread had not been served earlier and he said \"it's served when the bus boy is ready\" I was dumbfounded, and had  enough so I asked for the check.  \n\nWe decided we might as well eat the  Carpaccio  since we were charged for it, but it was awful, tasting more like Mortadella.  We spent $35 and left no tip.  We walked across the street while hearing the family next to us complain about their meal and had a  wonderful lunch at Colosseo.

I ordered the Tortellini alla Boscaiola (which is meat tortellini with peas, mushrooms & prosciutto in a cream sauce).  It was excellent; the sauce was delicious.  The only downside was that the portion was a little small.  Maybe it's because I eat a lot, or maybe I was just too hungry when I went there, but I wasn't hardly full at all.  So, to make up for this I ordered some dessert (plus it was my Christmas dinner, so I felt I should splurge).  I ordered the Baba (a sponge cake with a rum sauce and vanilla cream inside).  The dessert was mediocre; the cake tasted sort of tough (maybe it needs to be like this to stay together after soaked in a rum sauce?), but I didn't really enjoy the flavor either.  But, that's okay.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful when ordering.  Be careful if you stop by the front, you're likely to be drawn in by the nice female hostess that I always see out front greeting people.  \n\nThe restaurant is very nicely decorated, seems like a pretty upscale place.

I used to enjoy this place immensely. Although, the food has declined in richness/quality and flavor over the past couple of years.\n\nI'm not sure what the deal is.

Also the smoked salmon and grilled salmon choices for brunch are my personal style of cooking.  It's treat when cooked by others.\n\nAs far as the venue goes, the restaurant is larger than average when compared to many of the tight seating places found in North Beach. \n\nThe wood finishes are pleasant and add to the richness of the  experience.

That would be okay if you want that experience on a Friday or Saturday with a cool mix of international travellers passing by as you enjoy light snacks and heavy drink. I suggest indoor above all, open window or on the side street as nice secondary options. I always sit inside. \n\nThe ownership is Italian which effects the outcome of the experience; The waiters are Italian; The food is Italian; The ingredients have been  Italian. \n\nInitially, I did not understand some of the negative reviews I have read for this place.

The hostess was cute and chatty in an authentic Italian accent (I think).  I took her recommendation and ordered her favorite dish, I forget the name but it had peas and proscuitto-VERY bland and the proscuitto had an odd flavor to it.  My one friend ordered a chicken and fettucini dish and that was HORRIBLE!  The chicken had a fishy flavor!!  The other friend had a decent calzone that we all shared.  The portions are quite small for an Italian restaurant.   $105 for the three of us, including a drink a piece.  Nice atmosphere but food ordered was very disappointing.", "author": "Ray S."}

We received them then another waiter came over and asked us for our order. We said we were just having a beer then leaving. He left and returned a few minutes later saying there was a mixup and we were not allowed to sit outside without eating any food. He offered us a seat inside or to leave the restaurant. We were halfway through our beer, no line at the restaurant and PLENTY of seating available. What it boiled down to is we were not spending enough money in a restaurant that was less than 1/4 full.

She dodged my calls and never called me back. To my surprise I received something in the mail this morning from Pinocchio.

It has  a nice atmosphere. In the begining I was leaning for a 5 star rating.   THEN the bread comes and it was so -  so and kinda hard.  I had to ask the server for a soda refil and was informed NO REFILLS!!  If you are a soda drinker or addict then you understand.  I have no problem with the. $30 steak,  the $6 soup and $6 bottle water but a fountain soda with no refil?   Is this 1975??  Anyways I ask for a manager (principal-not cause I'm cheap) and find out my server \"Renzo\" is the manager. I informed him it's my first time here and I eat out every meal and he is really upsetting me.  Don't ruin my expierence over a 5 cent refil especially if you are the manager.  He says in a school teacher voice \"RULES ARE RULES\".   I was so upset I wanted to leave.  Then the meals arrive.   Rib eye was over cooked and the pasta was flavorless.  Renzo could tell he was getting NO TIP and when he brings the bills says Im sorry i took the soda's and refills off the bill.  Of course then I had to tip him but didnt want too.  Bottom line there are tons of restuarants on Colombus Street.  If you must eat here demand a free refill first.  Us soda drinkers need to stick together", "author": "Tony K."}

My wife and I chose this on a whim (without consulting Yelp! ... oops) after we found that Sotto Mare is closed Sundays.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine and the bruschetta. The wine was ok, the bruschetta never came. We already had our main course when we told the server (and also told him no worries), he shrugged it off and didn't even apologize. Not that we needed or wanted one, but at least some acknowledgment would have been nice.\n\nMy wife got the Pescatore, and for the the first time in her life, she sent a dish back to the kitchen. I tried it, and not only did it taste bad, but the sauce was watery and the seafood was all cooked poorly. When we politely asked the server to take it back, he just grabbed it off the table and didn't even ask if she would like anything else to eat, nor did he seem to care that she was not satisfied with her dish.\n\nI was feeling simple and ordered the fettucini alfredo with chicken. It was ok. Not great. Not terrible. Hard to mess up that dish. \n\nAfter the meal, the server did not even acknowledge any of the missteps of the meal. He brought us our check and ran off. Luckily, we were eager to get out of there.\n\nAgain, we are not picky diners. We are not demanding. We even laughed this experience off and were not really mad.

Not to mention we had just gotten into a little sibling spat. Anyway, we were in search of some place that had 1) fresh pasta and 2) vegetarian options. After the horrifying experience at the first restaurant, I just wanted to sit down outside, order, and get some food in my belly. \n\nThey advertise their fettuccine, gnocchi, lasagna, risotto, and ravioli as made fresh daily. I had the Fettuccine Pollo Alfredo, with fettuccine made fresh daily, sauteed chicken, and vegetables in an alfredo cream sauce. Blah, blah, blah. The fettuccine did not seem fresh to me and was far too chewy to be al dente. Chicken was tough. Sauce was a little thin and bland (think: more Parmesan than parmiggiano reggiano). The brother had the gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce. The gnocchi were actually quite good, light and pillowy in texture, melting in your mouth against the intense backdrop of pungent gorgonzola. However, gnocchi is one of those dishes that I find very hard to finish, as did my brother. It's always so heavy, especially with the very large gnocchi that Pinocchio makes. The creaminess and sharpness of the gorgonzola was overbearing by the end, and I wished that we had ordered some vegetables to balance it out. \n\nAs far as the service, we came in for a very early dinner and the place was far from busy. While the perky hostess and the cute Italian-accented server were very friendly, everything was sooooooo slow. Maybe it's a cultural thing? I don't know, I very rarely eat in North Beach and am not a major Italian restaurant fan to begin with. It wasn't as bad as Evil Italian Restuarant #1, but I think that it could've been a little more attentive. Obviously, this is a relatively cheap (each of our entrees was $14.95) Italian place so expectations should be adjusted accordingly (though you really should be able to get tastiness at any price range!).

Eight of us in total and we were the biggest party in the restaurant.  It was pretty darn busy for a Sunday night, so i suggest you make a reservation so you don't get boxed out.  The restaurant sits on a flatiron shaped corner, so the seating is somewhat compromised.  Plenty of outside seats if you don't mind eating under the french fry heaters.  The lasagna was well made and tasty with nice al dente noodles.  Could have used a little more internal cheese, but the suace wis nicely done.  The grilled salmon was very nicely prepared and served with roasted potatoes and garlic cloves that were nice together.  The gnocchi was ordered by two people in our party - one as listed on the menu in sort of an alfredo-style sauce.  The other (my daughter)  \"off-the-menu\" in a pesto sauce.  The gnocchi themselves were well-made.  Very fluffy and light.  And both sauces were good. The tortellini with mushroom sauce was also good and my spaghetti bolognese was good enough to come back for.  My one regret:  I talked my wife into ordering the insalada mista instead of the Caesar and three others in our party ordered the Caesar.  Bottom line?  Shoulda listened to my wife and ordered her the Caesar.  Many restaurants make weak Caesars.  This place makes a VERY GOOD Caesar.

We were waiting a while for our entrees, so I thought we might be able to choke it down in the meantime if we had some good olive oil.

The waiter then showed up to impatiently point at the vinegar-and-oil combo on the table.  Wha?  Seriously?\n \nHaving read Emily R.'s review (see below), I sense a pattern.  My party had basically the same demographics.  I wonder if she, her friend, and their mothers ordered wine.  We did not, and that was my only hypothesis as to why our server was so apathetic and disrespectful.  Honestly, as some one who was hosting my parents, I left this awful restaurant embarrassed and furious.\n\nThe food was (as has already been said) bland and not at all unique; you'd do better at Trader Joe's.\n\nYou know the not-quite-40 year old single business guys who don't have any taste and spend their weekends putting on too much cologne and blowing large wads of cash at pathetic clubs downtown? The ones who can't help but fail in their bids to impress and who you have to imagine go home drunk, alone, and violently frustrated?  My hypothesis is that this place gets by on their ilk.  A couple of men's men who roughly fit that bill were entertaining what seemed to be business associates from out of town at the table behind mine.  Their server was DOTING on them shamelessly.  Lots of embellished stories about the food they were being served, the wine, etc. - laying it on good and thick like you would for a group of starry-eyed, gullible, ignorant tourists.  And I'm pretty sure they had some real olive oil on their table.", "author": "Josh C."}

We ended up waiting about 25 minutes, but I've been a hostess, I know how it goes. No harm no foul. \n\nAs soon as we sat down we were given water bread and our drink order taken. My Mom ordered a wine she hadn't heard of but the waiter (hot Italian straight off the boat) had suggested a full bodied Cab. Well Mom didn't like it, she said it was fine when asked, but after the waiter noticed she hadn't drunk any he brought a new glass of wine on his own. Glass of wine #2 a hit! A very good sign of a very good waiter. \n\nOur bruschetta came shortly after we ordered it and it was amazing I'm a self proclaimed bruschetta connoisseur, and it was almost perfection. Then out of nowhere our waiter brought a complimentary insalata caprese without any real explanation, just that it was on the house. In my head I thought this was because said hot Italian waiter was preparing to ask for my hand in marriage and was preparing my parents for the question...Anyhow the gesture was much appreciated. Our main courses came. Pops had the lasagna Francesco, second only to Grandma's. Mom had the zuppa del minestrone, best I've had in my young life. I had the Penne Vodka, which had bacon in it...I've experienced this before in some Vodka sauces but normally it says that on the menu.

I have never met someone that is so rude; I usually let people slide on rudeness for the most part because I am passive, but she was just terrible.\nFirst, she put us at a small table when there was five of us. She said there was no other tables in the restaurant (except the four open ones I saw in the back five minute later on my way to the bathroom). We said we would wait. My mother-in-law was freezing and wanted to move. We said we were willing to wait. She responded by saying it wasn't cold in the restaurant and we were lucky to even be getting a table. Not good business manners in my opinion. Then my mother-in-law that the restaurant felt cold to her and she wanted to move regardless. The host then rolled her eyes, turn and walked away. To add to the kicker as she was walking away she said very loudly \"oh Jesus Christ.\" I think she didn't think we would hear, but we did. So rude. Then she went up to the host stand and complained to a server about us. Small restaurant and this was very obvious. When my mother-in-law got up to talk to her to tell her she was being rude to us, she responded that we were being rude. Does she not understand that we are the customers and she needs to be accommodating. I'm not saying that moving us wasn't going to be a little bit of a hassel, but I mean come on.\nThe server on the other hand was a doll. I can't remember his name. I think he said he has worked there three years. He apologized for her. His service was fantastic. Very sweet and attentive. The food was good as well. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. And the dessert is some of the best i've tasted. We got the cannoli and the mousse. The server really saved our experience and made it more enjoyable.

The penne had a light red sauce and was cooked, as it should be, al dente.  Dessert was a rum soaked cake that was just OK as the cake tasted a bit stale.\n\nAlthough the meal rated 3.5 stars, the service, at least from the waiter was about a 1.  If it was not for the busboys, I do not know if I would have ever received my food.  The couple at the table next to me sat for about 10 minutes with no service and finally got up and left.  The couple that was next seated at the table did not receive their salad until after their main course arrived.  \n\nThe waiter overdid the Italian shtick and thought that he was far funnier than he was.

It is surrounded by a bunch of other Italian restaurants that look exactly like it and probably have food that taste quite similar. Oh, and all of the prices for restaurants of Pinnochio's caliber are the same. Don't try looking for cheaper prices. We tried and you won't find them. Pay up, you're in the City!\n\nFood: I had Pinnochio's signature Lasagna with a glass of Barolo red wine. I have been drinking red wine for a few years (just turned 21) with fine dishes including pastas and meats of all kinds but had my first real - and truly great - wine/food experience. The meatsauce of the lasagna perfectly matched the fine taste of the Italian Borolo red wine. So much so, I had a sip with every bite and was absolutely stunned by the flavor combination of these two food/drink items. Thus, I highly recommend this combination. The Lasagna by itself was good, but nothing totally special. It was tasty but did not have anything unique about it. You look at it and you say \"Yup, that is lasagna, yay.\" It's honest, but these days I like to see a little design and special signature touch to a dish when paying such high prices (must be all the Top Chef watching). \n\nService: The waiter could have been a BIT more attentive, but seeing that I was with a group of six and we were in our early 20s, the service was good. \n\nAmbiance/Atmosphere: Busy, crowded, kind of loud, but makes you feel like your in an Italian restaurant. I would not go here for a romantic date - it is too loud, crowded and slightly cramped for that. For some friends, it's good. \n\nOverall: I would good back if I was in the area and needed a sure-thing, but I am not going to go out of my way to make another visit. It was kind of a \"been there once, it was good and now I'm ready to move on\" experience.", "author": "Matt S."}

I took a chance on it and was content for the most part.  The actual \"attention\" part of the service was o.k., with routine water refills and bread basket replacements.  Onto the food:  the Calamari I ordered was quite obviously frozen and somewhat undercooked.  The Margarita Pizza was good, entirely what I was expecting.  It had fresh ingredients with a good tasting sauce and a light crust. I was happy with this experience post-calamari.  The cocktails my girlfriend and I had were good, mixed well and tasty.  The rationale for the 3 Star Rating is that the wait for a 12\" pizza was double what you would expect, and there was a congregation of 15-20 flies in the middle of the restaurant.

Even the location is great, right in the heart of North Beach, a view of Cafe Trieste across Columbus. I'm worried about straggling into a bad Italian place in North Beach, mostly because all the restaurants stay in the same mid-high price range, so, fearing spending too much on an underpar meal, I researched before going out and I was not disappointed.

The food was nothing special and somewhat pricey but it's obvious that when you walk in there you are paying for a nice atmosphere and to be \"seen\" eating in little Italy, it is a total tourist trap.  It's a physically clean looking restaurant and fits in well on that corner.  Lots of windows and nice lighting.  I was a little surprised that the hostess was dressed so casually, I was hesitant to ask her for a table because I didn't know if she was just some random girl standing there, but she was very nice and polite and got us a good table.  More about the food:  my date was not impressed with the shrimp pasta dish he had at all and he felt like we were rushed (but that's because I was starving and scarfing down my ceasar salad and spinach ravioli), which I quite liked by the way.  He needed tobasco sauce in order to eat the shrimp because they were apparently flavorless, but the pasta part was good.  I just didn't feel like a lot of \"love\" went into the food.  Our waiter was nice.  The shrimp pasta, ceasar, and spinach ravioli with 2 peroni's came out to $68 + 12 tip so 80$ total.  Great for tourists!", "author": "Jonathan M."}

But this young woman's countenance was open and inviting, and she wasn't really barking in the least.  I didn't think she would tell a lie.  She recommended the vegetarian lasagna.  I love pasta--and, hello, who wouldn't love pasta layered with yummy stuff? My super friend and I took a chance and went in.  We could have been seated outside, which would have be fun if the night had been warmer, but we opted for an indoor table.  Inside, another hostess seated us immediately, and we had cocktails and bread almost instantaneously.  Nice.  Our waiter spoke Italian, which added to this establishment's authenticity and charm factor.  And yes, I ordered the lasagna.  And yes, yes, yes.  Yes.  It was as fabulous as the hostess promised.  The sauce could have been slightly less pedestrian, which is why I am giving the four-star rating for now. My friend's pasta and pancetta equally pleased and satisfied the hunger inside.

The bread served with dinner is pretty good.  The prices haev risen in the last couple of years and the online menu as of this writing does not reflect the actual prices, so you need to add a couple of dollars to most dishes.  I hope they do not raise their prices too much more as there are many other North Beach pasta spots that are about equally as good for less money.

Being in the mood for basic Italian food we ordered chicken parm, angel hair pasta with red sauce and a caesar salad. No complaints about the food. It was all very good, but I felt like I needed to eat it asap because of the hovering server. Why would the hostess let us in late only to have the server make us feel like it was time for him to go home? What further confused me is that they let in 3 more parties after us, but they had a different server. Why didn't they give us the server who was going to stay late? Probably won't be back because when I think of Pinocchio's I think of rushed service, not the food.", "author": "Elizabeth R."}

Every place was very crowded but we had both heard good comments about the food. It was about 6:45 pm.  We requested a table inside and the hostess said that it would be about 10 minutes.  So we waited, and waited and after about 30 or 40 minutes I noticed that there were a lot of empty 2 tops.  When I pointed it out to the hostess she told me that the manager had told both hostesses not to seat any more tables because the kitchen was backed up.  If I hadn't asked we would never had known.  Finally, without any apology or complimentary anything for making us wait, we were seated.  The food and service was very good and fast. Our server was apologetic but seemed embarassed.  After our meal he sent the manager over to talk to us because he had told her that we were annoyed by the unexplained wait outside in the cold.  She was rather snotty and said that most restaurants do the same thing when there is a backup in the kitchen.  They simply don't let anyone in.  Well I have eaten in many restaurants, have had to wait, but have never not been seated because of kitchen backup.  Most places would seat you, explain what was going on and bring you a glass of wine and bread, or at least water.  Not this place.  Maybe they can fool the tourists with their attitude.  However, as good as the food was I wouldn't even think of recommending the restaurant or eating there again.  Oh, and a man, who we  were informed was the owner, in an Hawaiian shirt, just kept wandering around blasting little bits of song in everyone's ear.  Weird and EXTREMELY rude restaurant!!!!

I have eaten at this restaurant in the past (3 years ago), split a pizza at the bar with my husband and a couple drinks.  We loved it, so we took our parents there while they were visiting.  The biggest problem that I have with the place is that it wasn't very clean.  Two of the four side plates needed to be replaced once we sat down, mine had a one inch piece of cheese baked into it from the dishwasher and my husband's looked as though someone had eaten off of it already.  The next bad thing that happened was a string from a rag wound up in my husband's water glass... ick!  And to top it off, I had an upset stomach and diarrhea the following morning.  Hmmm...  I wouldn't have suspected the restaurant were at fault for this had we not experienced such filth while dining there.  I was pretty bummed by the experience since it really wasn't really a cheap meal.  I would stay away from this restaurant unfortunately... or stick with a pizza and a few cocktails.", "author": "L G."}
