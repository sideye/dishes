The churro was undercooked, however... didn't think much of the churro being undercooked since it was late at night and a minor part of the meal. \n\nOrdered again later that week and was missing the large chips and tortillas which is vital when ordering a large-sized guacamole and fajitas. The restaurant couldn't bother themselves to try and correct the order. They offered no solutions and claimed the bag of 10 chips is the pint-sized bag that we ordered. They also said it was not a big deal that there were no tortillas for the fajitas.\n\nTL; DR: DON'T order delivery from this place. Ever.", "author": "AK P."}

The portions should you choose to eat in (and you should) are bananas. Look at this order of huevos rancheros. It's GIGANTIC. The food and soda together were the same price as a bowl, chips, and drink at chipotle (about $12) but the chips here are free. Its SO good and its soooo much food. Probably the most generous portions I've had for so low cost since I moved into the city. I don't know if the woman working could tell I was hungover but the amount of cheese in these eggs is the best thing I've experienced all day. Beans are great, rice is good, they do NOT skimp out on the guac. Eggs are perfectly cooked, salsa on top is awesome. I will probably come here as often as I possibly can.

So today I ordered a chicken burrito (super) with no cilantro, salsa, rice, or onions and when I got home it had rice. Rice grains dry my throat so I can't eat rice. Out of haste I threw it away, granted I shouldn't have but I had my two month old in my arms, and called to let them know about the situation. This had been the second time this week this had happened, but it didn't bother me. What bother's me is when I called and explained, I needed the burrito which was thrown down the trash shoot. I didn't realize at the moment I would need it, but the woman hung the phone up on me when I tried to explain. I understand it was my fault I threw it away, but I don't have access to the trash shoot yet alone the basement. So I was bummed because the phone was hung up on me, I showed up in person to explain and was given attitude and ignored. I just find that the behavior I got was unnecessary. I just spent 10$ on a burrito plus the tip I gave so all I simply asked was for my burrito to be made correctly. I've been coming for months and it I've always been kind and polite as well as the staff so again I'm not understanding why I got so much attitude. I think it was very unprofessional, and unnecessary. Angry at that point I demanded my money back and got it. As a customer i felt like I was treated like trash.", "author": "Tj J."}

You can see the cooks preparing the meals and they always seem to use the freshest ingredients. \n\nI also must mention their horchata! *purr!*\nI love the fresh horchata they make here! sometimes I stop by for that alone as I walk towards the embarcadero, always a perfect treat for me! \n\nservice here has always been very friendly and kind for me, and I always feel comfortable and at home here. Never had any sort of bad experience with any of the people behind the counter! \n\nif you are in the area, definitely stop by El Tesoro! wonderful food, quick and easy, and two paws up! \n\n*chirp!*", "author": "Jei C."}

Well, I believe it means \"the dog took a shit.\"  I wanted to study French in high school, but my parents would not have it.  \"Where will you use French?  There are far more Spanish people in America than French.\"  So, Spanish it was.  Little did they know that a year of my life would later be spent living in Montreal...a lot of good my forced Spanish classes did me there.\n\nParfois je deteste mes parents.  (Sometimes I hate my parents) ((FR))\n\nPero yo digress (But I digress...)  ((I think, in ESP))\n\nEl Tesoro means TREASURE in Spanish.  This is an understatement.  I love this place.  Their Horchatas are bad-ass.  For those who have never tried one: I believe the Latin American version is referred to as Morro (or rice-based with Cinnamon) and it goes well with any meat you can stuff down your gourd, yes, even Cabeza and Lengua  (beef head and tongue).  I love ordering Horchatas - because I expect most gringos order a Pepsi.  Their pretty countergirls always do a doubletake.  \"Yeah sweet thang, that's right...a horchata, and please don't spill anything down the side of that styrofoam cup.\" Oh, isn't styrofoam an absolute no-no?  In fact, isn't it illegal now?  Illegal or not, minus one star for not doing their part to save the world.  I suppose I could bring my own thermos or cup...but I'm a lazy bastard.  Bitching about it is how I do my part.\n\nTheir Caldo De Res (beef soup) soothes the soul on those arctic San Francisco nights (you know...when the mercury dips below 60).  Their standard tacos just make me wanna do a hat dance...but my sombrero is a baseball cap.  That would just look foolish.  Last, but not least, is their special \"Mojado\" (wet) Burrito - they'll put whatever you want in the damn thing and then smother it with enough guac, sour cream, cheese and salsa for a small child to doggy-paddle in.  It's holy mayhem...\n\nIn retrospect, learning Spanish was not the end of my world.  El perro tomo una mierda WILL NEVER SOUNDS AS SEXY AS:  le chien a pris une merde.

They're huge, salty, cheap, and perfectly symmetrical. Their hot (not habanero) salsa has a depth of smoky flavor you can neither get out of a bottle nor replicate in your home test kitchen. I'm not sure how they do it, but El Tesoro has mastered the extremely difficult art of making the simplest dish, very nearly perfectly, and giving it to you with a freaking smile. And that's how I judge \"ethnic\" food places - by the simplest dishes (or the most available, such as Pad Thai). As an added bonus, because the restaurant is in the Tenderloin, the people-watching is an exercise in sadism.", "author": "Angela O."}

The burritos are great, but the real standout for me is the quesadillas.  These aren't the appetizer chain restaurant style that are flat and dry, so get that out of your head immediately.  They're almost like a burrito that's been filled with cheese.  I've never had a quesadilla that was so thick and filling.  Also, the first few times I went here, I didn't know about the salsa bar, which is back behind the kitchen area, where there are also bathrooms and additional seating.  The service is very friendly, but if you're trying to give special instructions for your food, it sometimes helps to speak a little Spanish, because some of the clerks might have a bit of trouble understanding your English.  They also have a juicer machine with tasty fresh juice.", "author": "Joshua B."}

It wasn't the perfect experience, had they offered a choice of tortillas, that would have sealed it. But for what they didn't have in tortillas, they more than made up for with the BBQ chicken. Not many places offer this, and as I watched them toss my chicken on the grill and pour BBQ sauce on top, I knew I was in for something good. Add in the no charge lettuce, a healthy portion of black beans and rice, and a grilled tortilla that holds it all together, it is pretty close to burrito heaven.

And maybe it was just a bad day, but the woman at the counter was pretty indifferent/borderline-grumpy to me. Then there's that whole thing about dictating your ingredients ahead of time. No pointing at what you want... you need to be able to think ahead about what makes a good burrito, and speak those words to her. So I started naming a few things that I wanted, and she told me that no, I could only put three items on or it would be a Super Burrito. But the items I was saying were cillantro, onions and hot sauce... I didn't want cheese or sour cream or anything else super-esque. So I stuck with whatever three items I had said, and ended up with a completely mediocre burrito made with clearly sub-par meat to boot. I would have given them bonus points if I could have sat in one of the front window-view tables, but there were toddlers (the counter woman's?) playing with crayons on them. Yeah -- I understand issues about childcare and I'm not going to knock anybody for having to bring their kids to work occasionally -- but this is the review of a restaurant customer, and as such, I was disappointed that I'd have to sit in the back room if I wanted to eat at the restaurant. I will say that the decor was above par for a tenderloin restaurant, and the place did seem quite clean. My burrito was made fast, and the guy doing the cooking was the one employee there who was willing to smile at me. So because of those points, I'm giving it two stars -- and I might even go back one more time to make sure I haven't misjudged them. But it won't be in the immediate future.", "author": "Zoe H."}

She nodded, she wrote the order down,  I paid for my order, and I waited.  She gave me my order, I thanked her, again in Spanish and went on my way.  I got home, and unwrapped my tacos only to find that the tacos were full of cilantro, and that the carne asada tasted like pork.  Pork, uh no!    I know I betray my race by not liking most pork, but that's just me.  Also, whatever meat that was seemed drenched...uh, marinated in a highly seasoned sauce, possibly to mask it's flavor.  Diced flank steak (a.k.a. carne asada), corn tortillas, a bit of guacamole are simple pleasures for me.  It's kinda hard to make an error on such a simple order.
