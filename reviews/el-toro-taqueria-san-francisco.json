I'm so sick of going to places that have \"spicy salsa\" and it taste like a ton of bland tomatoes. \n\nIt was super busy, but luckily we had a group of kids with us to snag tables while the adults ordered! The only down side was that it was actually pretty hot today (which rarely ever happens on SF), and the sun was beaming on us so bad that it cut our meal short and we had to pack our food up to go. The windows are huge with no blinds to shade you, but I feel weird \"complaining\" about something that probably is SOOOO rare in SF. :)\n\nI wanted to note that I have a lot of respect for one of the staff. A costumer was being a complete jerk to her and she kept her composure very well. It actually resulted in one of the Moms I was with approaching him to tell him to knock it off!

You wait in line sort of like cafeteria style where the food is all placed behind the glass, so it's nice to actually see the meat and ingredients in front of you. We ordered the 3 tacos for $7 and two al pastor enchiladas. Advice: some ladies don't really understand English, so you have to make sure you're telling them exactly what you want. When we ordered our tacos, the lady put some rice in them which cost extra. Another lady helped and told us that the rice was extra, so we had them take it off since we weren't aware of that. \n\nChips and salsa were added complimentary if you dined in so that was a nice bonus! Their hot sauce is really good, especially the spicy pico de gallo. The jalapenos were not hiding, so yummy!

What makes this one special (or not)?\n-It's a little more expensive than most\n-It's a little cleaner and nicer than most\n-TACO HAPPY HOUR (I gotta come back for this)\n-Meat selection is kinda limited\n-The salsa isn't very good\n\nUltimately, I hate to say it, but I'm really disappointed. So far, this has been my least favorite mexican place in the mission.\n\nI got the super burrito because of the Yelp special, which gets you a couple dollars off. I wanted to get al pastor, but they were out of that, so I settled for spicy chicken. The spicy chicken wasn't very spicy, and the whole thing was kind of mushy and not very tasty. Usually you could fix that with some salsa, but truthfully even out of the 6 (helpfully labeled) choices, I wasn't a big fan of any of them.\n\nThe other issue is that they were pretty slow and inattentive. There were probably 10 people in front of me and it took nearly 20 minutes for me to get served.\n\nThere's some upsides, like their aguas frescas are cheap, although I didn't get to try them as they said they were out.\n\nOther than coming back to try the cheap tacos at happy hour, I can't see myself returning here. It's also pretty close to Taqueria Los Coyotes, which is one of my favorites! There's a few other taquerias within just a block that I haven't tried, too.

It's definitely less populated than Pancho Villa, but offers a very similar menu. One major difference for me though is that they do not offer lengua as a meat choice (which is a shame!). \n\nThey do offer the three taco deal for $7 which is awesome and quite filling. I feel like you can't really go wrong with the meat choices like carne asada and carnitas which is what I went for. They give you a side of chips and you can help yourself to the variety of salsa they offer just like their counterpart has. It's just a nice low key place to grab an inexpensive meal if you're in the area and you don't really have to scour for seating in the early evening (I went on a Thursday like ~7pm) like some of the other mexican places in the area.\n\nI would prefer Taqueria Cancun or Pancho over El Toro if you're in the area (and La Taqueria, El Farolito too), but again this is not too shabby and doesn't seem overly crowded which is a perk!

The inside is clean and minimal which I love, not too much color or decoration, I am definitely down for pi\u00f1atas and fiestas but not for brunch or breakfast and I visited for brunch. I ordered some basics to really give you the 411 from a fellow Mexican; a side of guac, chips and taco. BAM!, the basics. Keep in mind: Every order comes with chips! A huge plus. They have many options in this high ceiling establishment, huge menu on the wall. The taco I ordered was a basic tofu taco that comes with beans (your choice of black, refried, or brown), pico de gallo, and salsa (your choice or spicy or mild). \n\nOk now, here is my review: The black beans were delicious, basic. The tofu comes diced in cubes with a tomato based sauce. I was hoping tofu that was not cubed but more like a ground tofu texture, like soyfritas at Chipotle, it is better for a taco; I added salt but for $2.50 it was decent. The chips were thin and toasted right, they are unsalted. The guacamole was authentic, too mashed for my liking but good nonetheless, it could have used more lime, I also added salt. My meal in total was $5 and that was amazing, it was a very good low price for chips, guac, taco, and soda can.\n I did not mind adding salt to my food, I was expecting the usual from Mexican food, enhanced flavors and spice, but I got non. This is not necessary a bad thing either, they have salt and pepper on te tables and they allow the natural flavors of the ingredients (vegetables, grains, etc) to stand out in their own right. El Toro Taqueria provided you a canvas for you to add salt and pepper as you wish (flavor enhancers). \n\nI recommend this place 100% and I will definitely be back, now that I know what kind of vibe they put into their service of Mexican fast-food classics! \n\nYes, Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Quesadillas; that is Mexican Fast Food.

I think it cost around $8 and included chips! My main criticism is that the level of seasoning and fun herb additions isn't as good as Chipotle (my gold standard for burritos in today's market)  but the inclusion of guacamole does add a great creaminess that is always an add-on at Chipotle. The sugar-fruit drink that I ordered tasted fairly awful with saccharine notes.\n\nThe Staff: Friendly, fast, and can speak English!

My friend who is a longtime vegan & fan of El Toro Taqueria read my review. He suggested I give them another chance. He said to avoid the specials that contain dairy products as there can be confusion over omitting them so instead order the Tofu Ranchero burrito w/ guacamole. He said that this is the best burrito in the city. \n\nI took his advice & have since been to El Toro Taqueria a few times since. I am now a big fan of the tofu ranchero burrito. I get it in a whole wheat tortilla w/ vegetable rice, spicy salsa, pinto beans, lettuce, & guacamole. There is a .35 cent charge for the lettuce & guacamole is .75 cents extra yet everything ends up being $7.67 including tax. This is a great deal as is a hearty burrito plus it includes chips & a large salsa bar. \n\nI love how the salsa bar is labeled to determine what is very hot or medium hot or mild etc. I feel that Pancho Villa Taqueria should follow what El Toro Taqueria does by labeling their salsa bar. While El Toro Taqueria gets busy around lunch time it is less busy & chaotic than Pancho Villa. \n\nPapalote is my favorite vegan burrito in the Mission for their variety of vegan burritos w/ brown rice yet El Toro Taqueria is a close second for my favorite vegan burrito as I have become a big fan of the flavorful hearty tofu ranchero burrito.

The location is right nearby and with a Yelp deal, it was a no-brainer to try it out.\n\nWalking in, it is bright and airy, with a huge menu that spans the entire wall. Plenty of vegetarian options were offered, including a Tofu Ranchero!\n\nI came up to the line and ordered 3 tacos, 2 Tofu Ranchero & 1 Rice and beans.\n\nUnfortunately, I believe I got a fairly new worker who didn't speak much English. Like...zero. I couldn't even get \"2 tacos\" out before she went \"huh?\" Another worker had to help translate.\nThen, she kept asking me what I wanted on top of it. Um...isn't that your job to know? Just give me what it says on the board. Tofu, beans, salsa, etc. But she kept pointing at random ingredients asking if I wanted it or not. Confused, I said yes to a few additional toppings, not knowing if I was going to get charged for it or if it was included in the price. (Spoiler alert: I got charged for it).\nAlso, when she was scooping ingredients, she was realllyyy stingy on the scoop. I'm talking like 3 cilantro leaves per taco. Kyle H. was getting helped by another worker and she was giving him full scoops. Booo...\n\nBut fortunately, with the low price and the yelp deal I purchased, it was still but a small dent in my wallet. I just got unlucky with the person helping me out.\n\nAs for the tacos? Some of the best I've had. Simple, but executed really well. You can see how fresh their ingredients are. I also loved the variety of salsas you can choose from, which was great with the free chips they give with every order.\n\nThe small hiccup with customer service aside, this was a great experience.

Then a man and his daughter used the bathroom and he held the door open for me. I was in shock at how rude this woman was over a simple question and all she had to do was press a button. \nAfter I sat down and got the food, she went around and placed a hand written sign on each door and the bathroom door stating \"bathrooms are for customers only\" even though the bathroom door already had 2 other signs stating the SAME thing. As if she was just messing with me, or calling me stupid for \"not reading\"..\nThe food was probably the driest Mexican food I have ever tried, the salsa was good. That's about it. I feel like she must have been a manager or had some authority in the restaurant because the ither workers seemed to fear her, but seriously? I'm Mexican and I never go into places to be rude, I was so happy and she made me feel so uncomfortable, she ruined my appetite and if it wasn't for me being respectful, I would have torn down her extra signs and thrown them at her..instead I just left that horid woman. \nThis was around 1-2pm on Saturday February 3rd 2018. \nWILL NEVER RETURN. \nThank you all so much if you read the whole thing.", "author": "Ruby O."}

I noticed that something seemed wrong when the women helping me was filling soft corn tortillas with beans and chicken. I asked her about three separate times if she was planning on rolling and frying them after, and she assured me she was. I didn't see her package the final product but immediately opened up the bag to see what she had made. Sure enough there were three separate tiny soft corn tacos (seriously tiny), stuffed with chicken beans and cold cheese. I was charged $8 for this along with a side of sour cream and guacamole each the size of a tiny to go salsa container. \n\nI walked right back in to ask for what I ordered-TAQUITOS. She told me that is what was in the bag. I am from San Diego and grew up on Mexican food but, about the cuisine, or even google a taquito, you would know that is just simply not true. She then asked if what I was looking for was a flauta..mind you, if you look up a the menu, the description for their flautas was \"three chicken taquitos\". I said no, because flautas are traditionally made with flour tortillas and I wanted three rolled tacos made out of corn tortillas. She replied that their flautas were indeed made with corn tortillas. So, after helping every other person in the entire room before me, she made me some flautas/taquitos/rolled tacos/whatever you want to call them and proceeded to charge me again, despite me already having paid for the bs mini tacos that I didn't ever want. \n\nI would not be sitting here writing this review if, after all this, my food was actually good. I was home ten minutes later and ready to finally eat when I found my food was soggy and drenched in some version of an enchilada sauce. I couldn't even pick up one of the rolled tacos without it practically disintegrating. Not to mention, the flavor was just absolutely not there. I ended up throwing half of my meal away because it was entirely unappetizing and difficult to eat.\n\nWith the countless options for Mexican food in the Mission, you are very wise to choose pretty much any other taqueria in the area.", "author": "Brittany C."}

It might take me a little while to catch up on everyone's reviews...as well as my own!\n\nAs one of the only SF taquerias I've ever seen advertise on TV, El Toro, to me, has always been a little different from their competitors in the Mission.  Which, sadly to say, hasn't always been a good thing.  While I appreciate how they're generally cleaner, both in terms of the food as well as the restaurant itself, they're not quite as good as several of their more well known and popular brethren.\n\n-- FIESTA PLATE - Nachos, Garlic Prawns, Chicken Flauta, Corn Quesadilla, Grilled Onions, Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Salsa...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-toro-taqueria-san-francisco#p5hBTUEXwKbPRsb89oBHIg)\nWe ordered this \"appetizer\" to share, but it was practically an entree (we had leftovers).  I didn't try the prawns since they were the same as my entree's, but I thought the nachos were pretty good.  The flauta was a little disappointing though - decent flavor, but not the least bit crispy (more on that later).\n\n-- DINNER COMBO #5 - Carne Asada, Chicken Asada, and Prawns...$11.00\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-toro-taqueria-san-francisco#qJwneJXKtQYnsCwlxIN1ZA)\nOkay overall, with a plus (Chicken Asada), meh (Prawns), and miss (Carne Asada).  The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful, while the prawns were fine, albeit heavy on the butter.  Sadly, despite the nice char on it, the Carne Asada was tough and chewy.\n\nWhile I appreciate how El Toro tries to keep their food (relatively) healthier, I can't say I'm a fan of their set-up.  While some items (like their prawns) are cooked to order, others (like the flautas) are just reheated in a microwave.  I assume there's a reason why, but even if their food turns over decently quick (the line is steady), it's certainly not the \"freshest\" way of doing it.\n\nSince I didn't really get to try one of their burritos, it's entirely possible I'm rating El Toro for the wrong things.  At the very least, they seem to be the most popular menu item.  Still, despite having the best intentions, the food just can't compare with what you can find elsewhere in the neighborhood.", "author": "Mike L."}

Had driven by and there wasn't any parking. Came back around, happened on a space so, I went in. In times past they would be crowded, or at least more than two people in line, that should have forewarned me. I stand in line, there are at least 8 people behind the counter...four young ladies...four guys, one at the register, one on the grill and two others.  Two of the ladies were helping the two patrons in front of me. Once they finished, one turned her back and started playing with a tortilla on the back counter and the other went and talked to the cashier.  The three ladies at the back counter turned around and looked at me and turned back around and began talking. One of the guys was preparing a meal and the other was free, he looked at me and started talking to the guy with the plate in his hand, but not once did any of them greet me, acknowledge me or anything. So, I stood there for a bit more to see if any of them would ask for my order...well, needless to say, I ended up walking out.  Didn't make a fuss. All I know is I'm not going to beg anyone to take my money. I wasted gas riding around trying to find a space to waste my time being looked over as if I was invisible.  And believe me...my presence can't easily be overlooked.  El Toro will never get a penny of my money.  Very disappointed.", "author": "Chaney C."}

After looking over the large order board, we ordered:\nSteak and Prawn burrito supersized - with rice, beans and salsa, getting it supersized includes cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream, which I withheld.  Burrito was tightly wrapped and the steak and freshly grilled shrimp were tasty.\n\nFish Taco - with shredded lettuce and salsa. Fish was freshly grilled and was tasty. The lettuce that was put on the taco still had moisture on it. The lettuce should be dry.  \n\nThere is a salsa bar, though two of the salsa containers were empty, for the chips that come with your food.

Gee, I would've come here a lot sooner. As it turned out, Jamie W. and I came here after a particularly disappointing meal at Morac where we actually didn't finish our dinner. The prospect of a dinner chaser should have been embarrassing, but if a meal is unsatisfactory, it leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that only a veggie burrito can resolve. Oh wait, that's after you get stoned, right? No, wait a sec...bean burritos when you're stoned, veggie burritos when you had a salty kufta platter. That's it.\n\nSure enough, we did split the $6.25 Super Vegetarian Burrito, quite an aluminum-foiled monstrosity that more than served us. However, before that, I spent an inordinate amount of time at their large salsa bar (see photo) where I innocently picked up one of the grilled jalape\u00f1o peppers....or was it a haba\u00f1ero? I took one bite and was on fire for about fifteen minutes looking like Albert Brooks in \"Broadcast News\". While I was perspiring profusely, an offensively aromatic vagrant kept walking by our table and yelling at us. Homophobic rant? No, just unhinged and urine-marinaded. I pointed him to the peppers and told him he'd love them if he took a few and chewed on them hard.\n\nWas that mean? Urban living has made me a cynical bastard, I guess. Once I recovered, I was able to enjoy the half-burrito. Packed with flavor, it has all the traditional ingredients but good, solid quality - rice, black beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomato and tomato salsa (see photo). We'll probably come back here before going to Pancho Villa simply because it's not nearly as crowded and of relatively equal caliber when it comes to senseless burrito gorging. Besides, the seafood options and the Ceasar (sic) salad selections all sound pretty good to me. But I sure hope I don't run into that vagrant. He may have a grilled jalapeno with my name on it.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...pretty solid veggie burrito with solid ingredients\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...relatively clean and low-key compared to a lot of other taquerias in the neighborhood\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast but not terribly engaged\nTOTAL - 4 stars...avoid the big grilled peppers in the salsa bar, and you'll be just fine", "author": "Ed U."}

It's easily one of the best establishments on the block.\n\nTheir food is tasty, fresh, and fast. It's the standard taqueria setup but you can tell they take the quality of their ingredients and cleanliness very seriously. What's more, they're the only place on the block that hasn't changed their prices in the past 6 years. With SF's costs rising everywhere, this is hugely convenient.\n\nI usually get a regular burrito or super nachos. The burritos tend to be a little high sodium for my taste and can occasionally come luke warm. The nachos are consistently great. I'm a big guy and I generally use one $9 order of nachos for two meals. They always come out hot and are loaded with meat, cheese, beans, salsa, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream.", "author": "Rajiv P."}

I always expect places in the Mission to be kind of grimy--though don't get me wrong, it's my favorite district when it comes to eating in SF--and was pleasantly surprised when I observed the cleanliness of El Toro Taqueria. Even the counter on which they assemble food, where there is usually a lot of spilled food, was spotless. I rattled off a long list of orders and the servers were extremely detail-oriented, asking me multiple times what level spiciness I wanted for the salsas on various dishes. \n\nI got a prawn taco, which had a generous serving of shrimp. I happily doused it with lime, but did not really use the ranch sauce that came with it. Two of my friends got quesadillas, which looked very good and also came with chips. We made sure to taste each offering from the salsa bar. Midway through our meal a Mexican man with a guitar popped in and started strumming away, and then came around to all the diners to ask for tips. I'm not sure if he was even affiliated with the restaurant...anyways, I would definitely come to eat again! El Toro impresses with their food and especially with their tidiness.", "author": "Amy G."}

They have nice service, give very generous portions, and  their beans and rice are very good (really important building blocks of a good burrito).\n\nWhere I think they fall a little bit short is in the meat department. The grilled chicken has good flavor and is cooked well, but I would have like to see it chopped up a bit more like they do with their carne asada. The spicy chicken also suffered from the huge chunks problem, but it's really not spicy at all. It's more like a chicken in a flavorful orange sauce. The carne asada is cooked well, but it's way too smoky for my tastes. I love me some smoke, but not when it is the most dominant flavor.\n\nTheir salsa bar though, is a big plus, as you can serve yourself and they have a very good selection of salsas. They have a tomatillo verde, pico de gallo, red salsa, and at least 5 other kinds that I can only remember by vague description (e.g. an orange one, and a roasted red one). I've tried them all, and they are all very good. You're likely to find one that suits your taste (I personally love mixing them!)\n\nFor a good burrito joint with great prices, El Toro is a good option, but perhaps not the best in the Mission.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

I know this isn't true, but you would think so.  \n\nAnyways going into a food coma around 4:00pm, I pick up some Peet's coffee downtown at the Westfield mall to wake me up.  While heading back to my car and passing the gym up because I am so damn full, I step off the curb and that made me throw up in my mouth a little.   This just reinforced the feeling of the super burrito and how much I enjoyed the hell out of it.   Oh yeh, I got a $10 coupon at www.restaurant.com for $2.  You just have to buy $20 worth of food for them to accept it.", "author": "James H."}

I believe they are owned by the same people. Same happy hour, $1 tacos, $2 beers, great special!\n\nUnfortunately, the food is just okay. I've been here a couple of times now and have sampled pretty much all of the meats. The spicy chicken is like a boiled chicken in an orange-colored sauce that is actually really delicious. I normally am not a fan of this type of thing, but it turns out pretty well. The pollo asado was pretty good too, but was under-seasoned on my second visit. Otherwise though, not too dry, pretty good flavor. \n\nThe carne asada was really bad in my opinion. both of my brothers said it was their faves, but they are somewhat less experienced in these sorts of things than myself. That being said, for people that are not looking for serious authentic carne asada flavor and just want a decent steak taco, it is probably pretty good. I thought the flavor was a little off putting, but I could be wrong, it has happened before. The al pastor on the other hand was unarguably flavorless. It looked so good! I felt sheepish (that's right, sheepish) because I always tout this as my standby, can't-go-wrong taco shop meat, but they managed to make it look amazing, but without any flavor. That takes serious skizillz! We were all unanimous in our displeasure with that one. \n\nThe carnitas, on the other hand, were fantastic! I was speechless. With the possible exception of carne asada, this is the most difficult meat for a taco shop to do correctly. They nailed it. It was tender, flavorful, and mildly smokey, but they also roasted it just crispy enough. It was not that inedible deep fried crap that some places serve and not that flavorless mushy mess that other places try to pass off. Very, very good. \n\nMy sister liked the tofu taco. I tried the fish taco, which was good for what it is, but it is definitely not baja style (read: not fried, no white sauce, no cabbage, etc.). Tasty though. My mom also liked the veggie burrito, but did admit that it was pretty bland by itself and needed lots of salsa. Which creates a fortunate segue into talking about their phenomenal salsa bar. Lots of varieties and recipes from frescas to spicy, habanero? style, etc. \n\nThe beer is cheep at happy hour, the tacos are almost free and there are some decent meats. Definitely worth a try, especially if you are in the area and need a taco fix.", "author": "Miguel V."}

I'm a totally civilized patron (who tips generously) and I'm not super picky, so it was completely unprovoked.\n\nSweetheart, if life is that bad for you, maybe you should take a break.

When we arrived, it was 10 minutes to 3PM and we saw on this site that they have a happy hour from 3-5pm with $1.50 tacos, so to buy time we were asking the difference between the $1.50 tacos and the regular prices ones. The lady said that the happy hour tacos come with less meat and smaller tortillas. So I ordered 3 regular tacos and my husband ordered 3 happy hour tacos. There was absolutely NO difference and she still charged me $7 for three tacos that should have been $4.50. The food is ok...not anything fabulous, and I've had WAY better agua fresca.

A gawky, lanky, adolescent girl frequented El Toro at least once a week with her mom who lived just up the street on 17th and Dearborn. This was back in the days before the Mission was filled with hipsters, bars and restaurants. In fact, it was a bit scary back in '86. My memories include my mom and I getting harassed on the way to and from the BART station and the big neon 500 and martini glass sign at the corner of 17th and Guerrero represented a scary business to keep away from because of all the scary drunks that hung out in front of it. Oh how the Mission has changed. \n\nI would come down from Oregon during the summer and stay in the big city of SF with my mom and during the summer of 1986 I developed a crush on a particular burrito 'slinger' at El Toro. I managed to convince my mom to go there for dinner so I could eat a chicken burrito lovingly made by my wannabe novio. My mom knew about my crush and indulged me as much as she could afford, which was a lot, because back in 1986 the burrito prices topped out at $3.50. Definitely something a single mom could afford. \n\nFast forward to June 13, 2008. I had an itching for Mission-style burritos and my first thought was El Toro. I knew it was still around from the Yelp reviews so my husband and I went to the city to check it out - 22 years later. \n\nHere are the things that have changed: \nPrices - 1986 =$3.50 - 2008 = $8.50\nIngredients - you would never see tofu as a burrito filling in 1986\nAtmosphere - the inside has clearly been upgraded - complete with new tiles and facade. \nClientele - 1986 - my mom and I were one of the few Caucasians in the joint; mostly Spanish spoken. 2008 = lots of Mission hipsters; lots of yoga mats and bicycles. \nFood - honestly, it was like taking a bite back in time. My chicken burrito tasted amazingly good. I can't tell if it was because I was feeling nostalgic or because it was that good. \n\nThe one thing I remember that's exactly the same are the seats. They're the same thatched leather, backless stools that I remember sitting on as a pre-teen with my mom, trying to catch my crush's eye from across the restaurant. \n\nAhh, to be young again.", "author": "Lee H."}

I remember discovering El Toro one of the first times I had ventured into the Mission and falling in love with it.  I thought the super veggie burrito was really good but moreover just got swept away by the sauce.  Ooooh, the sauce is so special!  There are so many variations of the medium hot sauce, and the cups they allow you to use are unlimited so you can fill as many at your heart's desire.\n\nThis place hooked me in from the get go that I literally made it a religious thing.  Some people went to Church on Sundays, I took the 14 or 49 and visited El Toro.  Every Sunday.  For a year.  And I loved it.\n\nThese days, there is another taqueria that has me going back for more so I don't visit El Toro that much, even though I do live in the Mission.  I did however get dinner there last night and was reminded why I used to make such an effort to go there regularly.  I just can't get enough of that sauce!  \n\nAs for the environment, the place is a bit too noisy to stay in and dine.  They are constantly chopping meat behind the counter which makes the place too loud to have a conversation w/o having to raise your voice or shouting.  The service is also just mediocre.  It's a hit or miss that the cashier will actually smile at you.\n\nI would give this place 3 stars if it weren't for that sauce.  Oh the sauce!  So fresh and soooo good!\n\nMy rec would be to skip ordering in and instead get it to go and have lunch or dinner at Dolores park (pending on weather).

Although burritos preference is a highly subjective (and often sensitive) topic to Missionites, El Toro has arguably been one of the better burrito joints in S.F., with its wide variety of grilled and stewed meats, as well as several vegetarian options. Until recently, El Toro use to offer only two salsa varieties - a red or green.  Both were exceptional. The green was a snappy verde salsa great with crispy carnitas, and the other a red sauce with a perfect chipotle kick to it - just remarkable!  \n\nSince reopening its doors after a recent remodel, something here has changed.  On a recent visit, I ordered my usual Super Burrito, only this time the al pastor (marinated pork) lacked its zing and the pork was rather dry and chewy. Shredded cheese was added more sparingly then before, and the burritos were over-laden with Mexican rice (albeit tasty rice, but way too much filler).  With the addition of the new salsa bar now comes more salsa options, however both salsas that I once so dearly loved are now gone, and the new replacements are not as exceptional as they were prior to the closure.  \n\nI'm sure I'll give it another try in hopes that this was only an \"off\" night and that perhaps they'll  bring back their old red salsa recipe ...please????", "author": "Lady D S."}

They all came with enough \"filling\" to make four or five small tacos or three medium sized ones.  In fact, I always get extra tortillas (I think it's like 50 cents extra or something) and do just that.  The quality of the ingredients is almost always really good.  The meats are juicy and gristle-free, and the veggies are nice and fresh.  \r\n\r\nI've noticed a couple of people talking about the burritos here, some with a tone of disappointment.  I have to say, I can't vouch for the burritos here.  My impression is that the non-taco food here is pretty standard generic-mission-district-fare.  What stands out about El Toro is the tacos.

A regular burrito for my wife and a super burrito for me. I saw them make them and all the ingredients they used looked fresh. My wife started to eat hers first. She complained that it didn't taste good. The meat was too greasy and the burrito overall just didn't taste right. She didn't finish eating it. I started to eat mine and it too didn't taste good at all. It was really bad. I didn't finish mine either. Right away, both of us started to feel nauseous. I was able to hold back the effects of nausea, but she wasn't. Ugh. So my experience with this place sucked. However, I doubt their food is bad all the time, but with so many other taquerias in the area, I don't think I'll be visiting this place again any time soon.\n\nThe agua fresca I ordered tasted good though.", "author": "Juan d."}

I'll even give a shout-out to Pete Yorn's lyrics for \"Burrito\":\n\nIf you want a burrito\nYou can have another bite of mine\nIt could last you forever....\n\nIsn't that the truth! There is no burrito joint in this City that can compete with the freshness of ingredients offered at El Toro. Well, maybe Pancho Villa. Then again, it's owned by the same person. One of the cool drinks that I enjoy, cantaloupe juice, is sold only at Pancho Villa (which is a bummer because 16th Street isn't really a nice place to chill and have a relaxing meal due to the \"street\" action).\n\nEl Toro totally rounded up my Mexican food experience by offering the best tasting ingredients. We were absolutely distraught when we lived in Manhattan for 2.5 years knowing that the only place we can get a decent burrito would be to fly back home to San Francisco. I've heard people from the East Coast declare \"Chipotle's burritos are the best!\" Ugggghhh. How sad is that? Rookies.\n\nIt's great to be back home. If you plan to be in the Mission District, stop by at El Toro and order their combination dinners (grilled steak, chicken, shrimp and mushrooms) or anything on their menu.

Very extensive menu with black beans, pinto beans, or refried. For tortillas, choice of spinach, flour, wheat, or red chile.

I went here yesterday with a friend, who had ordered tacos and paid right before me. As I was paying for mine something happened and his plate of tacos (which cost $10) fell on the ground and everything splattered everywhere. He cleaned it all up, wiped all the guacamole up and picked up all the tortilla chips, only to be met by dirty looks by the staff. Not only did the staff stand around glaring but when he told them what happened, they said \"your fault.\" and didn't offer to do anything for him. The poor guy just dropped all of his food on the ground two seconds after paying for it and all you can say is \"your fault\"?  I understand that maybe some people might do that to get something free but this clearly was not the case. I worked at Starbucks for years and whenever something similar would happen I would always give the person a new drink, isn't that what most decent humans do? I will never go here again because of this incident, and if I could I would like to take my tip right back out of the tip jar.", "author": "Lindsey G."}

Having been practically raised on El Toro, my review may teeter on the line of nostalgic but, their tacos are AMAZING.  As a Bay Area native, I know bad Mexican food and I know good Mexican food.  El Toro being the master of the latter.\nMexican food is something so simple to create and even simpler to mess up.  The ingredients are few and inexpensive but, doing it right is an art.  El Toro's meat has so much flavor and they don't crown one meat the King.  All meats, from Al Pastor, to carne asada, to chicken are all full of flavor making the simple taco a true treat.\nThe line may be long but, its totally worth it especially if there are Mariachi inside waiting to serenade you while you drink an ice-cold Coke and eat more tacos than you can count on your fingers... Don't worry, it won't break the bank either.\nThank you El Toro for being closer than Tijuana.", "author": "Stephanie V."}

There's usually some minor thing wrong with the food as everyone has stated, but i dealt with it. But i think im over giving el toro a free pass.\n\nThe last burrito i had there was the most anemic burrito i've ever been served. I ordered a super burrito, and my server literally put half of a single spoonful of meat in my burrito,then feigned putting a second helping as i watched in awe. I mean im here and have relatively decent eyesight, its obvious how ridiculous this is. Eating it tasted like eating a lettuce, guac and sour cream salad wrapped in lukewarm tortilla.

Ordered the red snapper (cheapest fish, they have a salmon for more money) regular burrito. Probably shoulda opted for the \"super\" cuz I missed the cheese. It was incredibly hot, I had to wrap some napkins around the aluminum foil, I enjoyed the chips and having the sauces right there on the table (red chili and guacamole) is a stroke of genius. One dude was getting all the pickled carrots from the salsa bar so that was annoying\n\nThe burrito itself, pretty good consistency (I ate there). It was however really lacking in flavor. I saw the fish chunks but couldn't taste em. I guess I can tell people I've had a veggie burrito now. Boring. The end of the burrito, it started doin what annoys me most about these things, the wet tortilla gets really sticky, teeth and gum\n\nCheap, not quite $8\n\nIt's affiliated with Pancho Villa which I'm not too sure bodes well for them (never tried em but they're popular)", "author": "xo x."}

They never disappoint, the staff is friendly & helpful, great location, clean & cute, FAB salsa, little water spout so you don't have to constantly go back in line, and occasionally you might get a guitar or accordion player in to set the mood.  Even though they are affiliated with Pancho Villa, who are stamping out cookie cutter taquerias all over the peninsula, they keep this place a little more intimate and original.  The super burritos are pretty eff'n super, the veggie is just as huge, fresh & filling, but my adored dish is the Garlic Prawn dinner: about 8 large prawns fired on the grill with marinated mushrooms, served with rice & beans, and topped with avocado, tomato, onions and cilantro.  Doused with some of their hot salsa (similar to a pico de gallo), it's absolutely scrumptious and stuffs you.  The #9 is also good, with salmon, garlic prawns, and carne served with a creamy white sauce.  Great spot to hit up before, during, or after a night of drinking in the Mission.", "author": "Tara G."}

The woman who runs the cash register went to look at my order and said no churro.  I said, \"I know, I'm asking where it is 'cause I ordered one.\"  Not according to her.  And she didn't want to get it for me 'cause I was charging it.  Folks, just so you know, businesses can't force a credit card minimum; it's against their contracts with Mastercard & Visa.

If you want the best carne asada (grilled steak) burrito in San Francisco look no further than El Toro.  For the first 15 years of my San Francisco experience La Cumbre located down the block towards 16th was my burrito place of choice.  About 16 years ago my future wife took me to El Toro, and, the rest, as they say, is history.  The burritos are fat, full of tasty beef,  and will fill you up.  The chips are fantastic and they have a green chili sause on each table which is to die for.  Their salsa bar serves up a spicy fresh salsa fresca and other tasty side touches.  I always wash it down with a tall Mexican made Coca Cola.  Many times, a strolling mariatchi trio will come in entertain you for a few songs. A couple of weeks ago we were in the Mission after 11PM and El Toro was closed...My wife and I, as hungry as we were, decided to check out La Cumbre.  While the burrito was good (heck, anything at that hour would have been) it gave us a chance to taste and make a comparison.\n\nThere is none.  El Toro is the best!\n\nWord of warning.  Don't ever park in the funeral home parking lot next door on 17th.

Research revealed the top favorites in the Mission seem  to be La Cumbre and El Farolito.  I drove by both of those and they just seemed a bit funky.   Surprisingly La Cumbre was practically deserted.  I had noticed El Toro before so I decided to give it a try.  It was appealing because the decor is bright and clean (newly remodeled) and the staff is dressed in spiffy uniforms and they are crisp and efficient.  Plus everyone is always cleaning everything.  Its a good sign to me as it reveals a certain amount of pride in what they are doing.  The carne asada burrito especial didn't disappoint either.  As others have noted, plenty of freshly grilled carne asada inside plus rice, beans and guacamole, perfectly complemented with the spicy Oaxacan salsa from the spotless salsa bar.   I also tried some of the horchata but it didn't compare with what I had from the many wonderful horchata bars in Madrid recently.  But I would definitely go back, budget or not.", "author": "David T."}
