There is lots of space and the tables are nicely spread out, not crowded together as you often find in other places. It's lively enough to prove that plenty of others find the place enjoyable, but rarely too noisy or crowded. My teacher and I never have a problem conducting our lessons here - it's calm enough to focus on listening and conversation.\n\nThe best part about coming to The Crepe House is the service provided by CARLA and BRUNA! They are amazing. Always friendly and helpful, they welcome me by name, happily caffeinate me early in the morning when I can barely mumble the words \"coffee please\" and take a minute to ask how I'm doing while taking my order with a smile.  I've spent time at other cafes and even other crepe-themed spots, but I always come back to The Crepe House now, specifically because Bruna and Carla always make me feel welcome. =)\n\nFood is good, nice selection, reasonably priced and always fast to show up after ordering.  $5 beer on tap too, a temptation I've so far managed to resist, but a good deal and not something I've seen often at other similar places.\n\nIf you're looking for a chill place to grab a bite and hang with friends, stop by The Crepe House and say hi to Carla and Bruna - they'll be the lovely ladies who greet you with a smile. =)", "author": "Eric H."}

Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Tuesday, March 20th around 9:15am.\n\n*Chorizo Scrambled: Onions, cilantro, eggs, and spicy sausage, Three-egg omelets served with rosemary potatoes and English muffin ($11.95)\n*Dessert Crepes - Strawberry: Brown sugar and cinnamon and whipped cream ($7.95)\n\nI asked for my scramble to be served with a side salad instead of potatoes which did happen. The scramble was okay. It was kind of lukewarm, but I was starving, so I ate the whole thing. I think it would have melded together better if there were cheese though. I did enjoy the greens. Probably my fav part of the dish. Unfortunately, they gave me toast instead of an english muffin. Kind of disappointing as I was looking forward to that english muffin. The crepes were not good. Too thick. And not sweet enough. I normally don't even like desserts that are too sweet, so I think this definitely needed more sugar.\n\nOverall, a very lackluster breakfast. They actually ended up messing up a few of my coworkers' items as well. I have a feeling we'll probably not be ordering from them again.", "author": "Elena N."}

The day before yesterday I went to the St. Francis Fountain for brunch & they had over a dozen vegan options for brunch there which was pretty stellar.\n\nYesterday at Crepe House they had two sandwiches that could be made vegan yet felt the tofu scramble was my best bet. The menu said the tofu scramble came w/ tofu, spinach, mushrooms, & onions saut\u00e9ed w/ spicy peanut sauce served w/ potatoes & choice of toast.\n\nI didn't find the spicy peanut sauce to be spicy or flavorful as any vegan or vegetarian knows tofu is bland to begin with unless you do something w/ it as it absorbs flavor. I felt like there could have been more veggies as well.\n\nTraditionally feel tofu scrambles come crumbled not cubed & are seasoned w/ turmeric to give it a look like scrambled eggs. Of course nutritional yeast & spices are usually added.\n\nI feel this tofu \"scramble\" was similar to Crepevine on Castro yet preferred the tofu scramble better there. All in all if you are a vegan or vegetarian that ends up here go for the tofu scramble as it is A-OK yet for a more innovative & fun experience check out St. Francis Fountain that does a killer vegan brunch.", "author": "Shane S."}

I ordered the strawberry nutella crepe and my friend ordered the mixed crepe. Both were about $7 each so together it was $14, which we thought wasn't bad, but when our food came out the portions were pretty tiny to share. It did come with a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream. The crepe being small made me a little upset because other crepe places are huge. On top of that the strawberries in the nutella were super tiny and sour. We literally ate and left. On the plus side, the service is good. They deliver the food to your table. They have a huge t.v against the wall and they were playing the warriors game which is what we wanted to see.

My boyfriend got the corn flake French toast that was very pasty and soggy tasting and was not crunchy at all which is the point of corn flake French toast. I asked the wait staff to give me something else since my order was very dissatisfying and tasted bad and was really small portioned. They refused to give me a different order and weren't very nice about it either. Although they did offer me a side of fruit which was also just as unappealing as every other thing we got served.

The menus were just similar because they hired the same artist to draw them.\n\nMy bf ordered a salmon fettuccine pasta and I ordered eggs benedict w/ side of house potatoes. We also got a cappuccino, which was delicious! We both agreed that the pasta was definitely the much better dish between the two. It came with a creamy sauce and a generous amount of salmon chunks. The eggs benedict was just ok. I think the hollandaise sauce was a bit heavy and the potatoes were slightly mushy too.

The only complaint I have is that on the outdoor menu the plain crepes are shown to be served with Ice Cream or whipped cream, however I was offered neither. I had to complain about the ice creams absence before it was happily provided by the polite staff. The fact that it was not initially offered is an indicator to me that they sometimes cut corners, and was not appreciated.", "author": "Gabriel C."}

It comes with you choice of ice cream or whipped cream. \n\nOne suggestion I have for the Crepe House, invest in some better coffee (minus one star)! The coffee was so un-flavorful and bland. Not a good combination with the delicacies of French cuisine..step it up a notch. Oh, and the tables (outside) are extremely unstable. When you cut your food, the coffee will splash everywhere.

Order at counter, then delivered to your table kinda joint, which often means smaller tip for lower service/care expectations. Staff was nice,  friendly and asked how things were at the end!

Nothing that warrants $11 - I'd understand that price if it came w/ avocado or bacon (which would actually make the sandwich much better).  The only saving grace is the fact that their beers on tap are $3.75, which is a decent price for the surprisingly good selection of tap beers (nothing extraordinary, but surprising for a crepe place).  \n\nAll in all, I think what bugs me the most about this place is the fact that the menu type font/coloring is the EXACT same as Crepevine's and Crepevine is 10x better.

I explained on the phone that I was allergic. As i get to the restaurant to pick up my to-go salads, Im assuming the delivery driver greets me. I told him hi and i had a to-go order. He told me it would just be a minute, as they put bleu cheese on my salad and had to scrape it off. He laughed as he said this. I then told him I was allergic and asked if they had switched out the lettuce at least, and he said no. I then told him I could just pay for the one salad that was made properly but i couldent wait for them to make a whole new salad. Another man behind the counter assured me it would only be \"one minute\" until the new salad was made. I told him i really dident have time but he insisted. So i paid for both salads and finally received them. There was no feta cheese on the second salad, no cutlery or napkins. \n       I was unable to attempt to eat my salad until today. I opened it up and guess what i found? Bleu cheese. So the guy behind the counter completely lied to me, telling me they were making me a new salad.

This place, in this neck of the City.\n\nThe Mission has always been one of the funkier places to be in, and a delightful mix of different elements and people that populate the Crepe House. Having a crepe place here that serves a pretty decent variation on veggie and sweet crepes is one of the reasons why I keep coming back.\n\nAnd the service is pretty decent. Even when it's been packed, I haven't had to wait too long to get some food in my maw. And the staff seems to genuinely like working here. (always a plus).\n\nThe mixed greens have always been fresh on many of the tasty crepes I have enjoyed here, in particular the Eggplant crepe, with a very good Mozzarella and sun dried tomato combination that I had during my brunch this weekend. I first fell in love with this mix of flavors here before I had that at museums, fancy parties and in dipping sauces from upper-end supermarkets. Always imitated, never duplicated.\n\n*le sigh*\n\nAnd the Banana Fosters... oh, how my mouth loves you and my thighs hate you, with my tummy torn between the two passions.\n\nNow, for the Salsa crepe... that had more spicy kick than actual flavor to go down with it,  as the black olive and sour creme combination on a crepe seemed excessive. I know, taste is in the mouth of the beholder, but this is my review and my two cents. The combo goes better on a tortilla....\n\nIs it worth the effort to come from one of the City to the other just to try these? \nHonestly, No, but if you are in the neighborhood and have that unusual craving, then by all means sit on in and take in the vibe. \n\n*Come in early, because as the sunlight gets darker the patrons become... *stranger*.", "author": "Sonya R."}

I have been wanting to come here and finally I have since I was in the neighborhood. It was definitely worth the trip and time. The service was great the cashier was very patient with us and did not rush our order especially the hot chocolates he made. I must say the chicken and waffle plate was worth the price because you are given half a chicken on top of the waffle. The gravy that was put on the side was the cherry on top for the chicken. The waffle was good as well it was not dry nor hard. The Canadian Bacon was pretty good and as well the bacon. My girlfriend enjoyed her food as well but I forgot what she had so I can not comment for her however, she did enjoy the omelette she had since she was craving it. All and all it's a perfect place to have a date or have a nice brunch. My next thing on the list is to try the crepes.", "author": "David U."}

I was extremely suprised at the size of my meal because they were extremely big. And it's not because I'm petite, but they do give out reasonable portions for the price you pay.  The Chicken Pesto was quite delicious and came with potatoe and a side salad.  Love that it came with a side salad. It made me feel less guilty for wanting to down everything else on my plate...but I didn't as it was very filling.  As for the salad...it was good, but there was too much cilantro in the dressing which kind of disturbed my taste buds a bit. But either than that, the lettuce was not overwhelming the rest of the necessary ingredients some chefs tend to do when making salads.  \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty welcoming and relaxing. On some tables they have TRIVIA PURSUIT cards which me and my friend took advantage of even though we knew 2 answers out of the whole box.  You can also people watch if you sit next to the windows.

Then when I walked it was nice and clean.  Organized menu but it was one of those menus you have to look up and have a hurting neck.  I ordered the Frutty Nutella Crepe with an iced soy Chai plus a Chicken-Lemon Sausage for a side order.  I waited about 5 minutes for my order and I was surprised with the size of my crepe and iced soy chai.  As for my sausage it was just one sausage split in half for $3.95! As for the Frutty Nutella it was so good but I think too much on the Nutella but it was still fulfilling.  I had a choice if I wanted whip cream or ice cream on the side but I chose ice cream instead.  =) \n\nAnyway, what I liked about the place was the ambiance, the food, service of the workers, cleanliness and it can also be a study area.  Music was moderate so it wasn't too loud nor distracting where you can have a lunch date or study during your break.  \n\nThe cons of this area is the parking because of course it is Valencia! \n\nFor those who are interested in checking out this place, its between 23rd and 24th Street on Valencia and RIGHT ACROSS from CCSF Mission Campus.", "author": "Sharjah M."}

Imagine an underdone pancake wrapped around a heap of chewy cheddar cheese with about a cup of cottage cheese in the center. *Sarcastic mmmmmmmm*. \n\nI decided to let it go and just forget about the fact that I had wasted twelve bucks on that mess. I thought maybe some water might help wash things down. It's a self serve situation, which is totally fine, but the plastic cups like we used to get juice during snack time at preschool in were all wet and stuck together. I remembered some sanitation class I took when I worked at a bakery a long time ago where we learned that dishes need to be dry in order to be sanitized. I let the water idea go and went home sad.

Although I am not a huge fan of ordering at the front and getting a number (something about not having a server to ask questions bugs me). This place gets a thumbs up for food, presentation, quality and quantity.\n\nThey offer much more than just crepes. You can choose from sandwiches to salads, soups and much much more. \n\nThe reason they got only 4 stars is because the crepes (although good) were not real crepes. They were too thick...closer to a Dutch Pannekucken or a German Eierkuchen. The whole thing about crepes is that they are thin. I would suggest they add some sparkling water and more eggs. Other than that, the flavors were great. \n\nOur Mimosa was a bit small (more orange juice than chamgane) and a bit costly, but it tasted fresh squeezed. If you are not a fan of a lot of pulp, don't order these here.\n\nWe also had some French Toast...not regular French Toast though..This was corn flake crusted French Toast...CAn someone say OMG...Holy Cow...AMAZING.

When we walked in, the tempting aroma of savory crepes was thick in the air but we were in the mood for some dessert.  The restaurant looked clean and they were playing some cool Latin music that reminded me of the Buena Vista Social Club.  It was kind of trippy to eat crepes which is French and have Latin music playing in the background. But who am I to complain if the music was good? I spent $7+tip on a small crepe that had nutella, bananas, chocolate syrup and berries in it.  It was good but it was so tiny that Loverboy and I inhaled it in less than three minutes.  I think it took longer for us to receive the crepe than us consuming it. We were debating on ordering a second one since we were feeling kinda piggy. We decided not to since it was a bit pricey.  For that price, I expected more fruit and a bigger crepe.  They do have specials on beer that I would like to check out next time.  They carry Blue Moon which I think is awesome. Hopefully their savory crepes are bigger than the dessert crepes.  I am a much happier piggy when my belly is full!", "author": "Shirleyanne A."}

This classic combination of ingredients filled a void in my soul. \n\nAt first, I was somewhat concerned with the fact that most of the crepes on the menu run close to $10, but when my dish arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size of the crepe, as well as the deliciously filling rosemary potatoes and beautifully dressed salad that come with it. I'd also like to mention that they have a handful of quality beers on tap! \n\nNow that I know they're the real deal, I've gotta go back to try a few other interesting crepe dishes.

Portions are just right, everybody is super friendly, unbelievably low priced Fat Tire, and totally comfy atmosphere with wifi. What more could any one want?", "author": "stephen d."}

We get it so rarely in SF that it seems to color everything when we do.\n\nLike the outdoor seating, but be sure to nab a table when you arrive.\n\nAccessibility:\nIf you know where to park (on side streets right off Valencia or parallel to it in the two hour zones).\n\nProduct:\nHuge portions. That might be the best thing I can say about the place. \n\nThe food itself was... a little forgettable. Or maybe the sheer quantity is a turn-off after you plow through half of it. \n\nThe first time I got a Mexican salad with chicken. It was your average romaine based salad. The rest: peppers, beans, tortilla strips, avocado, corn... made the salad. My friend got crepes and appeared to enjoy them heartily.\n\nThe second time I got the Asian salad with grilled chicken. Chicken was very tender and tasty, and the noodles were great. They were soft, not crispy, which was unexpected, but still good. This time another friend got an omelette--looked good.\n\nThis is definitely a place to go and share a dish. \n\nPrice:\nNot cheap, not expensive. Just right for SF, especially considering the portions.", "author": "Simone E."}

The atmosphere and decor are undeniably more homey and comfortable. My fresh orange juice was a little too tangy, which maybe isn't their fault since oranges aren't really in season during Jan. The Savory eggplant and roasted pepper crepe sounded amazing on paper, but it was much too cheesy. The potatoes that accompanied it were best eaten with a massive hang over. But 3 stars for service, peaceful atmosphere, and nice view of Valencia on a sunny day", "author": "Esperanza A."}

I've tried the Crepe House's other locations in Russian Hill and Inner Sunset and have been at 2x a week to their new Mission location.  The staff is awesome, friendly and always say hi and bye (which is not a guarantee in hipsterfrisco).  I always get the same thing: Chicken Pesto Crepe.  The potato's are made with love and the crepes can vary but is usually fresh, plump and filling.  The space is phat ya'll and it beats waiting 30 mins at bugaloo's across the street.

Seriously, my friends used to tease me all the time but when you find that mix of budget friendly breakfast and coffee it has to be a staple. Too bad the last 3 times I've gone there I've been thoroughly disappointed. Once I ordered a mimosa only to discover that the orange juice had gone bad, really bad, which seriously killed my taste buds and appetite and the food portions were significantly smaller and more bland in flavor. The last time I went the coffee was old and the house potatoes were no longer thick cubes of garlic yumminess but instead thin slices of slightly burned crisps. Also my boyfriends over easy eggs came out fully cooked. Sad to say I'll be taking this off my list of go to places in SF.", "author": "Gina D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-25", "description": "My husband and I stopped by this morning for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  This restaurant's owner has taken the time to design and decorate the place quite nicely, and has a professional looking menu posted on the wall above the ordering station.  Though a clearly inexperienced worker took our order, management smartly paired her with an experienced coffee drink maker - so the process went smoothly.  I received my special order Salmon crepe promptly.  My husband received his Eggs Benedict with the requested extra dark English muffin too.  The salad was dressed with a good amount of dressing - very tasty - and the potatoes were crispy.  Coffee was not the greatest though.  There is outdoor seating too, should you want to dine with your pup.  I hope word gets around quickly for these guys.  You should check it out.  It's actually kind of upscale and unexpected for the Valencia corridor.", "author": "Bobbi C."}

She never smiles, is never friendly, never reciprocates discussion... if you don't like dealing with customers, then leave.  You are representing the company and the product.  It's your responsibility to put on a happy face and greet the customers warmly with graciousness and appreciation.  You should be thankful that we go to your business and keep you employed.  Also, don't re-serve yesterdays potatoes.  You may be fooled by it, but we're not.  Dry stale overcooked potatoes just don't do it.

Sunday morning, crowded, long line, when we're close to ordering one of the staff asks how many in our party sets us up with table.  Went up to get refill of my decaf and it was out. Woman behind counter tells me it'll be a few, she'll bring it over when ready and indeed shows up with it a few minutes later.  Guy bringing out our food is very pleasant.

Mediocre to good food, but the service is definitely 2 stars. I felt like the person behind the cashier could care less about my business-no smile, no thank you, just a blank stare. This happened for each of the 3 times. Also, the music in there is HORRIBLE. Myself & dining companions noticed this each time. I wish they would just make everyone happy and put on some light jazz. I like the space there, it's kid-friendly but not crawling with kids, and the outside seats are nice.
