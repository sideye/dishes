My wife and I stop the first time as it was the only Mexican food restirant near the location we were at. We really didnt caare where we ate at that moment, cause we were starving. But OMG, were we thankful for the find. The food we've now had 3  times because its beyond delicio. The owner, assistances, and help are very friendly and thank each party before they each leave. If you are looking for really great Mexican food (chef style) you have to check this place out. Also they hust recently open a 2nd restaurant named Papis near Geary downtown City. Stop and enjoy, you wont be dissatisfied.\n\nOk my wife & I today (a bit since our last visit), but this time we ate at the Geary Papi's the second location (due to a power outage in the first location's area on Hayes). \n\nI'll tell ya \"There is no difference\" in the taste of food, quality of food or friendliness of the employee's. I'm telling all, you have to check these mexican food restaurants' out. Both are OMG delicious and well worth your time. Hat's off the the owners for making our drive from Monterey Bay to the City so very much worth our visits !!!!\n\nAbsolutely great food !!!!!!!

I'd love to give more stars for the friendliness of the staff; they let me store the guacamole I made for a party that day in their fridge while we dined and even gave me chips to go! So sweet of them  \n\nBecause of that I feel like an ass for my three stars, but the food was pretty mediocre and my Bloody Maria was actually horrible. It was mostly ice water, tequila, with a splash of what they considered to me house bloody mix  but it really just tasted like watered down/blended salsa which is essentially what it was. I know this because I asked for more tomato juice after returning my first and they brought me a little condiment cup of it. \n\nWe ordered the eggs bennie, a quesadilla, and tacos; I'd give them a 6.5 on the flavor scale. Good but not great! With a little love to their recipes (including the guac),  I think it'd really make a difference!", "author": "Tash B."}

The chips last for a hot second... you have to request more, and then wait around quite some time to get them. Let's talk about the margarita - it was so sour and artificial - definitely one of the worst ones I've had! \n\nNow, onto the main entree...The carnitas enchiladas were good. They are served in a super cute skillet pan and were a nice sized portion. They definitely weren't your traditional enchiladas. There were three enchiladas on a tiny bed of rice and beans, with melted cheese and some pineapple salsa on top. I generally prefer that my enchiladas be drenched in sauce. \n\nI loved the ambiance of the place - it's small, modern, and lively! Came on a Friday night and was super thrilled that we didn't have to wait too long either. The menu is huge and the service is friendly.

When we arrived there was currently a wait list but what we appreciated about them was that they let us leave a phone number so we could pursue the shops and come back when the table was ready so we did. When they called they said they had a table and we came straight back. Turns out the table was outdoors and they cannot serve alcohol on the patio.  We went with it because we were starving but I would have liked to know that a, before we left or b, when they called to give us that table.\n\nOnce seated the service was extremely slow. Our water was constantly empty with no one around to refill, the food took forever, and no one came to ask how we liked our food and/or if we needed anything.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, while not as disappointing as the service, it was still a let down. We had the chips and salsa to start ($3) which were nice because the food took forever, but not worth it in flavor.  I do not feel the need to order these again. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla which was large in portion.  It was tasty but too heavy for lunch (my fault not theirs). My wife ordered two tacos (shrimp and fried chicken). The shrimp was exactly the same as the quesadilla just in a taco without the cheese.  The fried chicken however was terrible. I love fried chicken and was excited to steal a bite of her taco but I immediately regretted it. I am not sure what part of the flavor it was coming from but something about it was extremely off-putting for me. My wife disliked it as well and was not able to eat it. \n\nWhile we do not feel the need to go back, the shrimp quesadilla was the best part of the experience.  However, if we did end up there again, I did see many people ordering the burrito (it was huge and looked delicious) I would try that.", "author": "Danielle B."}

We had eaten something a few hours earlier, so we weren't too hungry. We liked the nachos so much, we decided that we will have to return and try other menu items next time we're in the area.\n\nWe returned a few weeks later, and had dinner here. We sat in their cramped dining area, not the bar. The tables are really close to each other, so you will be rubbing elbows with other diners if you choose to dine-in. \n\nWe ordered a couple of their Blood Margaritas. I like their margarita 'cause it's not sweet! As for food, we ordered the Queso Fundido with Chorizo to share, the Super Burrito with Fried Chicken for me and Fish Tacos (3) for the hubby. \n\nYou'd think they'd send the Queso Fundido first and let us eat that while it's hot before our main entrees arrived. Noooo. We got both at the same time. So by the time I got to my burrito, it was cold. The Queso barely had any cheese. It was mostly beans. I was really disappointed with the dish. Don't order it. My burrito was good. It had enough fried chicken chunks, so that  with each bite, you got fried chicken. However, it was a tad dry. Needs more sour cream and guacamole. The hubby thought that the fish taco was just okay. He said it didn't have too much flavor. \n\nI don't think we'll be back for a full dinner or lunch. Maybe nachos and a glass of margarita at the bar. You're better off getting a burrito at El Farolito or fish tacos at Cholita Linda!", "author": "Hazel C."}

Really vibrant spot with high ceilings, hanging lights, lots of chatter and reggae music on in the background. We were greeted immediately and given a nice two top table in the back. I have to say, the tables are definitely squeezed in there and it can feel quite crowded, but that also adds to the ambience. \n\nIt took about 10 minutes for someone to greet us and take our order. We started with margaritas - I had the regular and my friend got the blood orange. Initially she was given the charred jalape\u00f1o by accident - which she figured out after taking a sip (extra spicy!!) but they got one out to her fast once she told them about the mixup. For a starter we shared the queso fundido chorizo and it was good. Served with warm tortilla chips that tasted freshly baked. The entree we decided on were the carnitas enchiladas - they split them for us, which was great! They were delicious! Rice & beans on the bottom, moist carnitas & flavorful toppings.

When I finally gave it a try, I was really surprised by the prices - they were extremely reasonable, especially for the serving sizes. It was a bit tightly packed, with you basically feeling like you're sharing your table with strangers, but I can't blame them, since brunch is such a busy time. But I don't know if I'd feel like it would work to take a group of friends there for brunch one weekend. I was excited to try the breakfast burrito, but I wasn't too impressed with the food - I can't say on another morning out that I would want to choose this spot as my go-to brunch place. I'll probably give it another try, but I'm not particularly drawn to go back at this time.", "author": "Marites S."}

It's tinyyyy but I've always managed to snag a spot at the bartop for two without reservations in under 10 minutes. Their charred jalape\u00f1o margarita is muy pica and very delicious! Definitely has a kick beyond just the flavor, so if you're not into that, you should opt for their original margarita or the sweet and zesty blood orange. \n\nPrices are a bit steep but we're in the city people, so what do you expect? The tacos were very tasty (I had carnitas and my lady had veggie) and the quesadilla al pastor was good but the meat could've been trimmed of the fat a bit better. I found the cheese to meat to tortilla ratio to be a bit off, personally, but flavor was most definitely there. The meat was tender and juicy. \n\nIt's definitely a hustling and bustling type of place, so you shouldn't expect to hang out for too long after finishing up, but service is very friendly and won't rush you, while the bartenders are nice as well. It's a warm and welcoming environment, simply not a big one.", "author": "Alex K."}

We got seated right away (it was a late lunch, around 2 p.m.). The waiter immediately came to us with menus and checked on us twice. The first time he came around we asked for more time, but for some reason he thought my friend said she wanted lemonade. We caught him before he walked away and clarified that we wanted more time, not lemonade (I believe there was a language barrier, so we let it go). Once we were ready I asked for sangria with red wine, but right after he asked \"white?\" ... no. Anyhow, we ordered the rest of our meal without any other issues.\n\nFOOD: I ordered quesadillas with carne asada ($14) - it was pretty thick and cheesy (just the way I like it)! My friend got two shrimp tacos that were filled and topped with an avocado slice ($10). It was filling! \n\nDRINKS: I got red sangria and my friend got a classic margarita (they also have a jalape\u00f1o margarita! maybe I'll try it another day). Definitely quenched our thirst (it was a very hot day).\n\nI also liked the ambience of the place - it's an open air spot and had a modern, casual look. There's also a cool mural at the back of the restaurant of a woman decorated in roses, reminded me of one of those characters from \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" or \"Corpse Bride.\" I would give the service a 3/5 - (it was good - not stellar, but not bad).", "author": "Jamey P."}

However, the food is consistent and fresh across all locations. \n\nAll of the food I've tried (chicken torta, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, corn, chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, ceviche) has been good - 4/5. But I continue to order the fried chicken quesadilla. \n\nIt will say, it's not \"true\" fried chicken - more of a chicken cutlet - but it's 1. SO BIG 2. Soooooooo much avocado guys, and 3. Delish AF. \n\nI usually take it home and get like 2 more meals out of it. And when I say they're generous with the avo, I mean it. Like no other place in the city puts this much avocado in a meal that's not labeled guacamole.

It was a great serving size for 3 people and they replaced the chips without even asking. I would go back purely just got the guac. \n\nFor my main I had 4 tacos, at $18 it's definitely on the more expensive side but worth it. I had the two pork tacos, one duck and one steak. Surprisingly the steak was my favorite, definitely recommend! Giving he restaurant 4 stars though because me and my friend were not keen on the duck at all, to the point where neither of us could finish it.

Hayes Street neighborhood has some amazing restaurants and we decided to give Papito a try.  We were greeted with a smile by a very nice waiter and he led us to the back booth.  I was excited that we got the booth, but then realized we were right next to the noisy kitchen where they were washing dishes.  Oh well.  I was not going to let this ruin my dinner!  We ordered chips and salsa and 2 out of 3 of the salsa's were fantastic.  The 3rd was some sort of oil and something sweet, maybe agave?  Not sure.  Just not my thing.  But the other 2 salsa's were really great.  My two dinner mates ordered mole chicken enchiladas and the roast chicken dinner.  I ordered the grilled salmon.  The salmon was cooked the way I like it, crispy on the outside and nice and creamy in the middle.  Hubby said his grilled chicken was a little overcooked.  They have a few wines by the glass, many of them are cheaper wines we can buy at Safeway, nothing special.  But at least they were only $10 per glass, not $12 or $14.00.  We had the flan for dessert, but it was rubbery and dry.  Not jiggly or creamy.  That kind of surprised me, just not the way I like it anyway.

There's nothing wrong with your neighborhood taqueria but when you want a bit of class and grace Papito Hayes fills the void.  \n\nThe place is nothing like your neighborhood taqueria.  It's hip and artsy with a bit of sparkle.  Service is on point, friendly and confident without being intrusive.  And the menu stops far short of leaving you wondering what the hell you're doing paying this kind of money for this type of cuisine.  4 of us dined here with a couple of beers (beer & wine only; corkage $20 per bottle) and a single dessert and the pre-tip tab ran a reasonable $20 - $25 per person.  \n\nHomemade Guacamole ($9) looked and tasted lovely and was served along with a basket of fresh tortilla chips.  Salsa was offered only when asked and it was dark red and very liquid and could've been improved upon.  \n\nWhenever I see Queso Fundido on a menu it must be ordered, a habit that'll likely send me to my grave earlier than hoped for.  Papito Hayes' version ($10) was ordered with Chorizo and it was one of the less cheesy versions I've sampled.  Still good, but the presence of black beans cut into the full-on melty cheese experience.\n\nI'm also a fool for Elote (Mexican corn served on the cob).  Here they had none but instead,  had an appetizer called Esquites ($9; grilled corn/sour cream/homemade queso fresco/pico de gallo).  It's served in a ramekin, off the cob, and was warm, satisfying, and a bit sweet.  I still prefer the tart flavors of Elote but if you enjoy fresh corn this will do.  \n\nThe meal was rounded off with tacos (2 for $10, 4 for $18) which were, as tradition calls for, small and wrapped in double corn tortillas.  6 were ordered and I sampled none, but my 3 dining partners cleaned their plates.   They did the same with a spicy Chocolate Mousse.  \n\nI wasn't blown away by anything I tried here but I enjoyed all of it, ambiance included.  Prices seemed similar to another business trading in this space, Tacolicious, but Papito Hayes is quieter with less swagger (aka no full bar).  If you're looking for a casually upscale spot to dine in Hayes Valley Papito Hayes should be on your short list.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Staff was very friendly from the start which is partly why I am giving as high of a rating as I am. We all ordered different meals -- and all of them were just so so. Nothing spectacular. I had the breakfast burrito and I added carne asada. Meat was so chewy and burrito was served with Mexican rice, black beans, and eggs only. The Mexican rice didn't cook all the way so it was gritty in my teeth, and the meat did nothing for me. You can find better food like this at local taquerias. For a breakfast burrito, it's hard to screw up, but I ate less than a quarter of it and then gave it to a bum. My friend ordered the shrimp omelette which staff raved about. I tried a bite of hers and it too was so so on the flavor scale. We kept getting whiffs of dirty dish rag smell when we would drink from our water cups. It just wasn't what I was expecting and I probably won't return. Flip side -- great drinks! Blood orange mimosa was light and flavorful with natural juries. Overall-- Sub par food, fine service and good for a drink. Don't waste your time for quality Mexican food. Head to the mission or a taqueria.", "author": "Emily A."}

I can never convince Jamie W. to come here because one whiff of the Twitterati makes him convulse and go directly to the nearest Chipotle. At least that's what happened when I suggested we try it as I noticed a rare vacant table on a Thursday evening (photo: http://bit.ly/29vxFjq).

I decided the $11 Jicama Salad would suit my appetite for a quick dinner.

Although a bit paltry, the $3.50 extra I paid for a quartet of grilled shrimp lent a nice beachy vibe to my salad (photo: http://bit.ly/29h7OuM).

Open kitchen, cozy seating, and several items on the menu that read as mouth-watering. We ordered the seasonal passion fruit margarita which was definitely tasty but didn't really have the kick of tequila you get in other similar restaurants. We also started with the esquites: grilled corn, sour cream, homemade queso fresco with a heirloom tomato pico de gallo. This was very tasty but quite small for a $9 appetizer. I ordered the quesadilla made with skirt steak, grilled onions, and avocado. Sounds delicious right? Unfortunately the flavor just wasn't there. With something like steak you really want to taste that char, the seasonings, and the juiciness. This one was just kind of bland. It didn't have that special something you get with really well made steak and carne asada. We finished with the churros sundae and both the house-made Mexican chocolate ice cream and strawberry 'sorbet' were fantastic.\n\nOverall the experience was fine but I was literally sitting 8 feet from the grill, feeling the flames flare up every so often. That sound creates an anticipation for really great meats and sadly the steak was just very weak overall.\n\nOur server was just fine, attentive, not overbearing but the busser needed to really chill out. Our appetizer plates were taken right out from under our noses without even being asked and we still had a bit of esquites left. His arms would be reaching in and whizzing by my head so quickly and unexpectedly, it was annoying and definitely brought down the quality of my experience with my friends.\n\nAlthough overall my experience was fine, I did say last night that I don't think I'd go back again.", "author": "Thomas K."}

Had a great feel about the place...loved the vibe and the twinkling lights as well as the beautiful painting on the wall. Service was good and everyone was helpful and jovial. As my sister lived in Mexico City for 7 years and as we were born and raised in a border town in Arizona, we are not strangers to outrageously delicious Mexican food.  Sadly, we did not find it here. \n\nWe liked the Esquites appetizer...very bright flavors...the tomatoes were incredible. The special soup was Caldo de Cameron and it was tasty...the soup had a great flavor and there were tons of veggies and shrimp. It had an aftertaste, however, that I couldn't put my finger on but reminded me of something musty. \n\nMy sister had the carnitas quesadilla.  The carnitas was yummy she reported, however, instead of tidy packages of crunchy, manageable meat, cheese and tortilla, her quesadilla was mushy, messy and overstuffed. \n\nI had the fish tacos which were reported to be made of Rockfish (which I not only was raised on from my family's fishing forays to the Sea of Cortez, but also eat frequently since I live in near Bodega Bay and it is so prevalent here) but the fish in the tacos tasted like tilapia...a flavor and texture I do not like as I think tilapia tastes like Catfish....muddy and mushy).  The fish was fried crispy and the seasoning was good. The cabbage slaw was tasty as was the sauce.  My sister and I had a side of beans, which were black beans, and they were simple and tasty. \n\nOur friend ordered the grilled chicken and it not only looked delicious but she reported it was delicious...tender and tasty and she ate every bite. The plantains that came along side, which she shared, were Caramelized perfectly and were super yummy. \n\nTwo stars because how do you mess up a quesadilla?? And be true to your ingredients....maybe I'm wrong about the fish but I think I'm right.", "author": "Tanya K."}

We walked in right after the lunch rush and luckily they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly with no wait at all. \n\nWe hunkered down in our booth with the menus and our eyes glazed over with all the choices. We decided on the corn 'Esquites' appetizer to start and a pitcher of regular margaritas ($30, ~5). The margaritas were deceptively strong and between two people we got roughly 2.5 each. \n\nI was kind of craving a handful of their items, but ultimately decided to split an appetizer and a wet burrito with my boyfriend (it was the right choice as the burrito was massive). We shared the Albondigas which were good but only came with two meatballs and the rest was all brussel sprouts (not a bad thing, but when you order meatballs you kind of expect more of those than the veg they're served with). We ordered the 'Burrito Mojada' with both sauces (a good choice, I recommend doing this) no meat because we knew it was going to be large. While it wasn't the most amazing burrito I have ever eaten, I was all about those sauces which were both memorable and full of flavor.", "author": "Siobhan F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-19", "description": "There's definitely a \"win some, lose some\" situation with this spot.\n\nYou definitely win in terms of location. It's located at the heart of Hayes Valley which provides a very fun nightlife scene. There is a great selection of bars you can go to after dinner, and that's a nice perk. It's a perfect place for date night.\n\nUnless you took a bus, you definitely lose when it comes to finding parking. I'm sure you aren't a fan of taking circles around the same block over and over, right? I'm not either. You also lose out on moolah. It is by no means meant to be a cheap spot to dine at. Be prepared to spend about $25 a person just for the entree alone.\n\nNow, if what you've read so far is totally fine with you, then I welcome you to the world of Papito! It's a cozy spot that has awesome wall decorations (see picture) and is generally very compact (it can be very busy on weekends since there isn't a bunch of room). Though I've only been here two times, both were very enjoyable. They serve unique enchiladas here, and they are by far my favorite dish. What is it that makes them unique? They are served in a bowl in tortillas that are usually meant for fajitas. Underneath them is the beans and rice (see picture). I don't think that's anything revolutionary, but it's different.\n\nFinal verdict: Papito is a small little place that offers an intimate setting. The cooks here know what they are doing and in turn you get great food. Service, as per usual with any place, can be slow if you happen to be there on a busy night. Regardless, it is most definitely worth a try.", "author": "Alex B."}

More medium than medium rare but I think the cook was struggling with getting temps right, the table next to us sent back both of their steaks for being rare. It was still seasoned nicely and tasted so good. We subbed out the fried and sweet potato mash for vegetables. The brussel sprouts and veggies. Both were good. Be aware though that the sprouts came with cheese but it wasn't on the menu. I can't have cheese but I was able to eat around it. The portion for the chicken was huge! A breast and a thigh, I think.

This isn't the kind of Mexican food you find in Mission joints like El Farolito (although there is always an occasion for El Farolito fare, like drunk at 2am). Papito Hayes serves an elevated take on Mexican classics and I was surely not disappointed. \n\nMy two roommates and I went on a Friday night around 7pm and was seated within a couple minutes without a reservation (they don't take reservations). We were prepared to wait 30 min just because the restaurant is pretty small, so we were off to great start! \n\nAPPETIZERS: \n+Guacamole & Chips $9: Guacamole was chunky and tasty! Great starter dish, but it wasn't anything out of this world. I prefer the guacamole at Mamacita more. The waitress was attentive and refilled our chips whenever we ran low, so +1 for the awesome service!\n\n+Esquites $9: We ordered this not really knowing what it was, but basically it's a grilled corn salsa. It was a light side dish that paired well with our chips. But for $9, I would've rather just had another order of guacamole. Don't order, you can make it at home. \n\nENTREES:\n+Duck Confit taco: the duck was shredded, full of flavor, generously portioned, and juicy. The pickled topping & mint tamarind sauce brought a breath of freshness that cut the saltiness & fattiness of the duck. So fantastic. Would definitely order this one again. \n\n+Fish taco: fried rock cod with a cabbage slaw on top. It was good, but not anything that isn't served elsewhere for cheaper. Wouldn't order this one unless you've never had a fish taco in your life, haha.\n\n+Carne Asada Quesadilla: the shining star of the night. The quesadilla was conveniently served as 3 thick triangular slices, one for each of us. The caramelized peppers and onions are perfect with the skirt steak, which was not dry at all and packed with flavor. I really enjoyed the fresh radish they put in the quesadilla because it made the otherwise really heavy dish feel lighter. ORDER THIS ONE! \n\nDRINKS: \n+Blood Orange Margarita: Very drinkable! Not too strong, not too weak. But it was VERY tangy. I didn't mind it too much, but my roommate was adding water to hers to dilute it because it was too sour for her. Maybe next time I'll ask for some sugar to offset the sourness? But I would still order it again because its pink, pretty, and got me tipsy :P", "author": "Erica L."}

We were seated outside, and even though it was a little chilly, the heat lamps they have are pretty good. We started with the chips and salsa trio. The tomato-based one was kind of smokey which I liked, the tomatillo one had a good bite to it, and the mango one was different. I liked the first 2, but the mango seemed more like a mango pur\u00e9e than a salsa to me. The chips were warm fresh and crispy, and they are unlimited, making them a really great deal for only $3! For entrees, I got the mole chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend got the carne asada enchiladas. They were more like tacos that were warmed up with some extra toppings, but they were pretty tasty! And while the portions looked small at first, we were actually satisfied with those portions. Only reasons we wouldn't give this place 5 stars was the enchiladas were probable a few dollars more expensive than they're worth, and we felt like they were trying to get us out of the restaurant more quickly near he end of our meal.

High quality ingredients presented in a unique way. Only complaint was the chips were somewhat stale. I asked about this and they said they were made fresh that day, but my guess is that they dry up since they keep them exposed to the open air. Otherwise, very good.", "author": "Chris D."}

Be sure to be *out* by 10pm\n\nHere's the full review:\n\n\"Decent food; rude staff.\"\n\nThey close at 10pm and they mean it - if you are after 10:05 they will make it clear they want you to leave by opening up the front door, turning on all the lights, standing in front of your table and talking after changing out of work uniforms, etc.  These people really want to leave work and they let you know.  They stop serving at 10pm, turn on the lights at 10:05, change out of work clothes by 10:07pm, and then make it clear that it's time for you to leave.  Just happened to me.  \n\nI called the waiter over at 10:09 to protest; no other restaurant I've been to does anything remotely close to this.  \n\nListen up Papito staff, if you know you want people to walk out the door right after 10:05, tell them in advance.  Say something like, \"we are closing now and want to give you a heads up that it's not just the kitchen that closes at 10pm, the entire restaurant closes at 10pm and we close down everything. Do you still want to come in and order?\"  \n\nBe professional if you want people to come back.  It sucks that you people are so inhospitable, because your food is actually decent.

I finally wound up ordering the Chilaquiles (a gewy stew of tortilla chips with guajillo red sauce, English peas, white onions, bell peppers & queso fresco). I guess my diet will have to wait til next week. But it was totally worth it. The portion was huge, so I hate half of it and enjoyed the rest for lunch the next day.\nMy co-workers indulged in the veggie/seafood taco platter (you can get two for $9, or four for $16). They offer a variety of taco options for all kinds of taco lovers, including tempura shrimp, carnitas, skirt steak, and even fried chicken! I think I'll need to give the tacos a try my next time around (and oh yes - there will most definitely be a next time).\n\nService was quick and friendly.

Came here after biergarten on a Sunday afternoon because of their advertised oysters.\n\n1. Asked if we wanted chips... sure! Don't you at all Mexican places? Bill came and had $3 for chips and salsa trio. That's fine, but I have this strong urge to stick to Mexican that has free chips and salsa. It just seems like a staple and safe assumption. Saw them bringing it out to many groups without calling out that it was actually a menu item. The three salsas were very small, and not that good.\n2. Oysters were not clean. In probably about 1/2 of the oysters we ordered, we were spitting out pieces of shell. Don't serve oysters if you're not going to spend the time to clean them right! Ruins the experience. Accompaniments were good, however.\n3. Sangria - this was the highlight. Would probably be 1 star without.

My boyfriend and I aren't big on Mexican food, but we finally decided to give the spot a try. After one trip, we couldn't stop coming back for more, and Papito has become our favorite Mexican spot in the city!\n\nWe've only been in for brunch during which they have more breakfast items like scrambles and breakfast burritos. The breakfast burrito is truly the largest one I've seen, stuffed full with beans, rice, scrambled eggs, and meat. Although it sounds daunting, it was actually one of the lighter breakfast burritos I've tried. I also love the veggie scramble, which they somehow infuse the eggs with veggies because it comes out green and packed with delicious smoky grilled veggies and housemade cotija cheese. The highlight though, are the quesadillas. Before Papito, I had never ordered quesadillas at a restaurant. They have such a great variety of quesadillas, each with different fillings that complement each other perfectly. My favorites are the chicken (which you can ask for grilled instead of fried) and the shrimp. Meat portions are very generous and the cheese is just enough for some decadence without being too heavy. I love their mango and apple salsa that brings an extra tang, and the avocado in the shrimp quesadillas add a great creaminess. Best of all, the organic tortillas have the perfect crunch to wrap it all up. I know the Mission is the place to go for Mexican, but Papito is probably my one and only in SF!", "author": "Ashley T."}

I enjoy sour, so I really liked this drink! We always get the corn esquites for the table. It's basically a dish of fresh grilled corn taken directly off the cob. It's very easy to eat because it's not on the cob anymore and it has a great flavor - definitely recommend this! \n\nFor main, I've tried the veggie burrito and the veggie enchiladas. I really like the veggie burrito because it also has fresh veggies which make the burrito more unique than just beans, cheese, rice and salsa. Their take on veggie enchiladas is more like veggie tacos folded over a bed of rice and beans and drizzled with some sauce. I prefer my enchiladas more drenched in sauce so I don't like these as much as their burritos. \n\nRecently I also tried their flan and it was amazing! You could taste the freshness and you knew it was not made from a ready made powder. It comes served with fresh strawberries and the combination of the two is so delicious!

Here's why:\n\nFriends arrived first, put name down, were quoted 20 min, not bad for a Friday night.  A waiter/host/bartender kindly offered to get us started with drinks while we waited.  I ordered a michelada, it was super watery and not all that pleasant, I am a great lover of micheladas, so perhaps I'm picky.  It took quite a bit longer than 20 minutes for us to be seated, but c'est la vie, the booth we were waiting for had campers in it.\n\nWe started out with guac and a dozen oysters (hey, it's an \"oysteria\" after all).  We got the kumamotos (my fave).  The guacamole was truly delicious, no complaints there whatsoever.  The kumamotos arrived and I went to eat my first one.  I squeezed some lime on there and knocked him back as you do, when my mouth was filled with an abhorrent flavor that I could only describe as \"barnyard.\"  Despite chugging some water and eating a chip or two, the off-taste lingered in my mouth for a looong time.  I immediately realized that I'd just eaten a spoiled oyster.  Needless to say, my appetite was a bit... reduced after that.  My dining companions said their oysters didn't taste spoiled, but they definitely didn't taste fresh.  We all noted that the oysters had no brine left in them and in fact were dry, and we surmised that they had perhaps been shucked and left to sit, which is not how you're supposed to treat oysters.  They go bad FAST after shucking, so this is probably why mine was so nasty.  I alerted our waiter that I'd had a spoiled oyster.  She asked me if I wanted another one.  Hmmm... not the response I was expecting.  I simply said, no I didn't want another.  I was alerting her not to get one free oyster, but to bring to her attention a potential food safety concern, as spoiled shellfish can cause food-poisoning.  She didn't seem to comprehend that, as she expressed no concern.\n\nI had a bite or two of the enchiladas I'd already ordered, but as I said, I didn't have much of an appetite.  I was contemplating the likelihood that I'd be stricken with food-borne illness and how soon it might hit, and this is not particularly conducive to enjoying one's meal.  My friends said that their enchiladas were a bit dry and under-seasoned.\n\nThankfully, I made it through the night without any nausea-induced interruptions, but I was worried.\n\nOur check was credited $3.60, presumably for one oyster, plus tax.  This is a weird thing to do.\n\nI truly have concerns about how they are handling oysters here.  If I were to come back, which I likely will not, I would not feel comfortable eating oysters here again.\n\nLong story short, they bill themselves as an \"oysteria\" and yet at least one person here does not seem to know much about oysters.", "author": "Rachel S."}

It was a busy Saturday evening and wait was fairly long, so we decided to settle for the patio seating outside despite the cold. The heat lamps kept us warm so it was still a great experience. The food was absolutely delicious! The carnitas enchilada is one of their most popular entrees and it was devour-able. The pork was soft and it fell apart in my mouth with every bite. The portions were large and I couldn't even finish it despite how much i wanted to. The chicken quesadillas were also good with a nice healthy portion of guacamole but they were quite standard. I would definitely recommend the enchilada over everything else. We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday so they brought out a candle and sang Happy Birthday while we got our chocolate mousse dessert. I'm definitely looking forward to returning soon!", "author": "Lisa H."}

I would have been happier with 2 less enchiladas and a side of rice instead. Large serving though for $15. Still a bit pricey though.\n\nSalsa and chips are great. A red salsa, green salsa and a mango pure salsa that was delicious.

The tacos are good; too, but not as remarkable as the other items (you can get a good taco at a lot of restaurants, but they don't all do enchilada carnitas like this!!).  \n\nThe service staff is very friendly and the atmosphere makes you feel like you are on vacation somewhere far away from a city like SF.

Flowers, green onions, and Cojito cheese were sprinkled on top of it. The dish itself was very homey and tasty; the corn was fresh/sweet and the beans perfectly soft (but not overcooked).

I'd really like to give this place 4 stars because the food is pretty good but I just didn't have a great dining experience.  This particular weekend the weather was extremely hot in San Francisco, and the water they served was lukewarm and not refreshing at all.  Is it so much to ask for a restaurant to serve cold water, especially on a hot day?  The other bad part was that it was really hot inside the restaurant, I think because the kitchen is right near the seating area so the heat spreads very easily. They also had these lamps along the wall that were radiating heat like little heat lamps.  Due to the combination of all of these things, I was literally sweating throughout the entire meal which made it very difficult to enjoy the food and dining atmosphere.\n\nBut at least the food was pretty good and our waitress was nice!  I was a little bit peeved to see that you had to pay for chips and salsa -- welcome to SF I guess.  The chips came with three tasty salsas which were all very unique.  We also ordered shrimp ceviche and the \"mixto\" seviche, which were both superb (probably the best part of our meal!).  The mixto seviche in particular was really good, with its mix of octopus, shrimp, and fish.  I ordered a burrito mojado with skirt steak and frankly wasn't very impressed. My friend ordered the 4 taco combo which looked a whole lot better, and I'd definitely order that if I were to come back.  \n\nI feel that had the weather been a bit cooler I would have had a much better dining experience, but three stars is all I can give.", "author": "David B."}

To begin with, I ordered enchiladas with carnitas, and the dish arrived barely lukewarm, despite the server's admonition not to touch the (stone cold) earthenware bowl. Clearly, everything had come directly from a warming pan and not even been reheated. The general impression was \"sub-Chipotle.\" Secondly, the margaritas are incredibly watery. If you read the fine print of the menu, it does note that the margaritas are made with a \"double-shot\" or 20% agave, though, if you do the math, a double-shot at 20% equals only one miserly shot of normal tequila, utterly lost in ice and mixer.

The place was packed, which I took to be a good sign - people in San Francisco should know good Mexican food from mediocre, right? I got the 4 tacos for $15 \"deal.\" At that price, they should be really good tacos, no?\n\nI got carnitas, duck confit carnitas, al pastor, and potato with chorizo. All the meats were dry and bland. It was apparent that both the pork and duck versions of carnitas had been cooked in some sort of water based liquid. Even with the promising word confit in the description of one of them! Major carnitas amateur move. Even the house made chorizo was bland - sorry, the fact that you made it does not automatically make it good. The condiments on the tacos were fairly tasty, but that's all I tasted. The dry bland meats underneath were completely overpowered by the bountiful piles of roasted pineapple, pickles, salsas, herbs, chipotle tamarind sauce, etc. (you get the idea).\n\nIn summary, if your main criteria for a taqueria are cool music and an innovative pickle program, this might be your place. If they're delicious tacos and reasonable prices, there are several hundred places in the Bay Area where you will have better luck.", "author": "Jon A."}

Not being dramatic, but I really felt like every bite had a lemon wedge squeezed on it.  I have this horrible meal sitting in front of me + slow service = never again.  By the time they came around to check on us, the rest of the party was done eating, and I had no appetite (which is rare).  I did give them 3/5 stars though, because their blood orange margarita and cheese dip was decent.  Will prob never go back, once is enough.  Enjoy!!", "author": "Mijung H."}

The California Chili was ok but the Green sauce was my favorite. The soup came with sides of Oregano, chili powder, land lime. The server warned us on how the chili powder is a creeper. We added the chili powder slowly, after 3 spoonfuls of the chili powder, we understood what the server was talking about. It was def. a creeper with a kick at the end. \n\nFor our entree, we shared the carne asada enchiladas and a side order of brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were amazing. each order of enchiladas comes with 4 enchiladas. if you're thinking only 4, these enchiladas are STUFFED and delicious. \n\nminus one star since they handed us the bill without asking us if we wanted dessert.

Minor, but sometimes I like to do a \"instead of appetizer, get dessert\" tradeoff. \n\nOverall, definitely a fun place with top quality flavor--whatever the cooking and organic ingredients, it's working! Right now they don't serve alcohol and let you bring your own. So I can't wait to see what cocktails they have. I'd definitely come back with a group.", "author": "Ari R."}

Found the food to be OK, not the best nor the most authentic Mexican, so just prepare yourself.  It is what you would find in a higher end Mexican fusion type of joint, just an american's take on Mexican food.  Overall we had a good experience, and the price was not that expensive, about $30 per person which included 2 apps, 2 dessert, pitcher of marg and dinner.  We will more that likely not return as this area has a lot better places to try. Also keep in mind that the wait was over an hour.", "author": "Frank C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-07", "description": "Inebriated, I was walking along the road to Damascus when a vision came to me -- a restaurant that I've never seen before! And I live here! I stood dumbfounded in front of the menu hanging in the doorway when a server peeked his head out at me.\n\nEither out of his Catholic fervor to cure my culinary heresy, personal financial interest, or just to keep the traffic moving (I was standing in the doorway but to be fair, they could have had their menu facing the sidewalk), he ushered me in and sat me right down on the sleek modern counters. I must give the man credit for this interesting sell, and for this they get all the stars.\n\nI remember the tortilla was hot and crispy, the meat and beans juicy, and then little else. I ate this at home.\n\nBut before I got home, I made one more stop -- a nearby bookstore (real books made of tree) where I purchased two works after much mental pacing: a collection of David Foster Wallace essays (Both Flesh and Not), which I could probably get online but as a child who grew up with books I bought anyway and have been enjoying thoroughly; and a book on Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner called... well, I think it's called Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner.\n\n*** MAJOR DETOUR, also totally unqualified book review ***\n\nAnyway, since I don't know who else to tell this to, that JP & LK book came across as a Lee Krasner Apologism. The Author (a certain Janet Engelmann) in the short space allowed for a book that is largely made up of reproductions of the artists' works, (seems to belabor) implies that Pollock was able to produce his greatest work (implied: \"only\") with the harmony and stability provided by LK. Funny, since it's LK who decides to (paraphrasing the author) join in the company of (and eventually extend marriage as an ultimatum to) JK once she realizes her time would be better spent pushing the young JK into the limelight than advance her own work (once again, paraphrasing the author). Also there's a lot of conflict including Kranser and Pollock; for a guy who was supposedly under the auspices of someone providing some emotional stability, he *did* die in a drunk driving incident that severely injured his mistress and killed her friend.\n\nThere's even a chapter titled \"Pollock waning, Krasner waxing\", which doesn't really make artistic sense since the only interesting part of this is the \"Pollock waning\" part, as he fades into steep alcoholism and depression.\n\nAnd then there's some miserable outcome with the division of the deceased artist's works that involves not much of his family at all. I do think that the two really loved each other but...\n\nBut the book really just depresses me as someone who enjoys working creatively. I mean, he sorta did it to himself (as in, you can trace his arc) so I wouldn't say Poor Guy if *only* he could at least claim his artistic genius as part of that same affliction. That would be a much more interesting (and to me, plausible) tale.\n\nSo, note to artists out there -- staying alive is half the battle.\n\nNOTE: I think 12 dollars is too much for a burrito in the land of burritos, but since it led to this book review I am giving it 5 stars. The book I give 2 stars.", "author": "Christophe C."}

Pineapple in dishes seems like a gimmick, not something that works out too well.  Beer battered cod taco was the best item.  Jicama salad was a wet mess.  I would much rather eat at Tacolicious for this type of mexican food.", "author": "Neo M."}

Not sure why there are 100,000 people here and the wait is 40 mins. There are good things, and I know - Mexican food in the Bay is pretty lame - but a 40 min wait?  I'm baffled. Chalk it up to another \"I don't get SF yelpers because I guess I've lived here too long to relate.\"", "author": "Carmen A."}

I had the poblano pepper omelette that was super flavorful and perfect! My bf had the chilaquiles that were equally as awesome. This is a new must try! Get the horchata with a shot of espresso!", "author": "Elle J."}

This neighborhood really needed a restaurant that offered great Mexican food. It is small but very comfortable and homey. Anyway, it has excellent organic food from the duck confit and shrimp tacos to the quesadilla and the burrito. Each meal was a big portion, fresh and very tasty. This is my favorite Mexican with a French touch that doesn't exist anywhere else. All the staff are very friendly and took care of us. We enjoyed our meals and visit. I do recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Keith D."}

Will not be going back.", "author": "Kristina P."}

I had two tacos, Al Pastor and Carnitas with rice and beans. I was very disappointed in all of it. The carnitas were juicy, but had an odd flavor which I couldn't quite identify, sort of like cherry or pomegranate. Whatever it was, it was a bit overpowering and did not enhance the dish. The Al Pastor was also disappointing. It wasn't cooked on a rotisserie, it was just a few cubes of pork which were tough, and the spices didn't permeate the meat. I found the green sauce to be bitter, which is not flavor I associate with good Al Pastor. There were charred chiles in it, maybe Poblanos? and those get really bitter if the skin is charred. The rice and beans were extremely ordinary and were quite dried up. Even with organic ingredients, $4.50 for a TINY street taco seems a bit steep. Once again, it's great to have GF options, I just wish they were better prepared. The service was good, and I am willing to give them another try, but so far, I am not impressed.", "author": "michelle c."}
