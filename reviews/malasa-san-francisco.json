They do a very contemporary take on some traditional filipino dishes, but they also have the very comforting silogs. Love that they throw in a twist or two here and there by adding cotton candy, 63 eggs, or caviar. It's a bit over the top, but in a good way. Gotta dress it up for the hipsters and foodies in SF! \n\nThe only ding (minus a star) was that the shaved ice in the halo halo was a bit too course and hard rather than fluffy. Other than that, the flavors were amaazing and plating was beautiful!!", "author": "Audrey L."}

I wanted to give them another chance as I was craving for some Filipino food. My friend and I came for Sunday brunch on a Sunday around 11am. We were able to get a seat with no problems. The service has definitely improved.  The restaurant also started filling up shortly after.\n \nFoods:\nLumpia - we thought that this was good. The sauce that it came with was really bomb. The green sauce they have on the counters was also really tasty! We were wondering what was in it\n\nLechon Kawali - crispy pork belly with mango-tomato salad, shaved jalape\u00f1os  and steamed rice - This dish was nicely presented but we thought that the pork could have been hotter as it was a little warm\n\nCombo Silog - this dish came with Ticino, Longganisa, tapa, and garlic fried rice with an egg on top- we thought this dish was average\n\nMy friend is Filipino and thought that this place was okay. Nothing really stood out but it was still good. This is the only Filipino place in the sunset so if you're really craving flip food, def check this brunch place out. The presentation is on point and def IGable.", "author": "Daniel S."}

It's a relatively small place and their hours are very limited so I'd be prepared to wait about 10-15min. \n\nBetween the three of us, we ordered lumpia, combo silog, and the lechon as well as a halo halo for dessert. The lumpia was nice and crisp but I've had better elsewhere. The combo silog was tasty but so felt that the beef was a little too dry for my taste and was probably my least favorite of what we ordered - the garlic rice was really good though! My favorite though was the lechon, so nice and crispy without being overly fatty; I also really liked the sweet slaw under. This dish was also beautifully presented! As for the halo halo, it was a crowd pleaser- but when is it not? \n\nOverall it was a good meal and while I wasn't blown away by anything this time, I'd love to come back and try some of the other dishes!", "author": "Janice L."}

It's in the inner sunset and we had to wait around 45 minutes before being seated, since it is a pretty small restaurant. Luckily, there was a farmer's market north of the restaurant that we got to kill some time at.\n\nI went with a friend and we split three dishes.\n\nFirst, we had the Lumpia Shanghai for an appetizer which is an egg roll with ground pork and shrimp and comes with a sweet and sour mango sauce. This was pretty good, but I think it tasted better with the savory, green sauce that they have on the table. This was a good sized appetizer and satisfied us until we got our meal. At this point it was around 1:30 and we were pretty hungry at this point.\n\nNext we had the Tinapang Bangus which is a smoked boneless baby milk fish with caviar, garlic fried rice and an egg. The milk fish is a fish you can eat in it's entirety which is pretty good. The fish was prepared lightly so you can still taste the fish! I think it was smoked just enough to bring out the flavor, but the balance of the dish could've improved because I thought the salad was too acidic.\n\nFinally, we had the combination sisilog. This is a traditional filipino breakfast and came with sweet pork, pork sausage and dried beef. I really enjoyed all the meats, but the sweet pork was probably my favorite. I've had sisilog that was better at other restaurants, I'd say this place's sisilog was decent and enjoyable.\n\nI also enjoyed the vibe because it was pretty relaxing, wasn't that loud or a lot of people there. A ton of families came and it seemed like a filipino spot that people enjoyed! We need more of these in SF!", "author": "Christopher L."}

We came early, right as they opened, and even though every other table was open,  the hostess wanted to seat our 2 person party with another 2 person party at a 4 person, combined table. Her explanation was that she was 'expecting a lot of people'. They attempted this with another couple half an hour later, even though there were plenty of open tables available, and they asked to be reseated at the bar... Lol. The restaurant was just barely starting to fill up by the time we finished our meals and left, so I'm not sure why they have this policy for placing strangers together at the same table, and I wonder where all the people they were expecting went.\n\nAnyway, I haven't had a lot of Filipino food, but I enjoyed both the Arroz a la Cubana which I ordered and the Carne Norte that my friend had. I think mine was a bit more unique given the combination of savory and sweet flavors and the pepper cotton candy, but both were quite tasty and we pretty much licked our plates clean! If you are a fan of savory brunches, this would be a good brunch place to try. I'm not sure about their selection of sweet brunch items though. \n\nOf note, my friend was quite disappointed with the presentation of our food as previous Yelp photos indicated that dishes were decorated with edible flowers, but these were missing from our orders.", "author": "Sherry L."}

After much contemplation, we ended up ordering lumpia (DUH), the carne norte, and the combination silog which includes tocino, longganisa, and tapa. Literally, everything was so delicious. Only thing was our lumpia came a bit after our food, so we thought they might have forgotten it, but the server even apologized that it took a bit longer, so it was no biggie at all.\n\nMy bf and I thought the servings would be kind of small, but we were wrong, we left full, and satisfied with leftovers for the following morning.

It was nice a crispy and well packed with filling inside. These lumpias were not dripping in oil which made it easy to go through.\n\nMy girlfriend got the Longanisa silog while I got the combo silog.

This was all topped with a fried egg and some sliced onion.

We came in as a party of three and the server instructed us that it would be a 15 min wait. So my party and I strolled around the farmers market and came back to empty tables. The server told us she would be seating us shortly.. 15 mins later with those empty tables still available, we were still waiting outside. It felt like the server just ignored us. I started looking around and noticed a couple of tables were just waiting to take their order. The whole wait time was almost 40 minutes. My party and I could not wait any longer so we crossed our names out and left. I'm just really appalled that we could not be seated despite having tables available with a promise of that we were all going to be seated (my party and another party were told so at the same time) but that party was immediately seated and filled up one of the available tables while we waited an additional 15 mins.

The dishes here are beautifully plated and are of good quality and have balanced yet bold flavors, though the portion sizes are somewhat small for the prices.\n\nWe started our brunch with the combination silog, a plate of garlic fried rice, a fried egg, sides of green papaya and tomato, and three different meats: the slightly sweet tocino (caramelized pork), a sweet pork sausage called longganisa, and thinly-sliced, dried beef called tapa. The tapa was my favorite of the three, as it was lean, salty, and had a great texture!\n\nWe continued with the arroz caldo, a rice porridge served with a Chinese donut, chicken, and a hard-boiled egg. The porridge was so tasty, and the crunchy elements in the warm mixture added a great textural contrast! We also had the smoked trout, served with lumpfish caviar, scallions, and more garlic fried rice, and again, everything about this dish was so nicely balanced and delicious!\n\nFinally, though we had ordered the lumpia shanghai appetizer, the server must have forgotten it, but it was brought out to us after we asked again--these fried, crispy egg rolls were decent, though they only had a small amount of the pork and shrimp filling. They were served with a sweet and sour \"apple-sour cherry gastrique\" on the side, which balanced out the savoriness nicely!\n\nOverall, Malasa was a decent place to have a unique Filipino take on brunch, though I wouldn't say that it's worth going out of the way to try.

The closest thing I saw was the vegetarian Tortang Talong which had egg in it.\n\nI asked the waitress if she could do the Tortang Talong omelette without the egg; making it vegan friendly.  The chef came to my table and asked if I would like it spicy, confirmed that I could have no animal product in it and assured me he would whip something up. He gave me a maniacal smile and ran back to the kitchen.  I trusted it would be good by the genial whim in his attitude.  He looked excited for the challenge. \n\nJust like that the Tortang Talong omelette was reinvented into a vegan friendly stuffed eggplant with a piquant spicy sauce.  If you are vegan, first of all, order this and also ask for a side of rice.  \n\nOverall, the ability of the staff to curtail this dish to my dietary restrictions was most auspicious and aggrandized the places' merit in my mind.  \n\nMy order here was off menu, which can be inconvenient at times, but the cooking staff was very accommodating to my eating restrictions and did not make me feel forced into ordering a typical entree.

The size of the portions don't make up for it either.  It seems like other reviews are extra-excited b/c there aren't many other Filipino options around.  But let's be honest:  how does it really taste?  Does it do well in representing Filipino cuisine?  I don't know, but the combination sisig....\n\nThe tocino was slightly too sweet, but it wasn't bad.  It actually is quite good for the flavor of syrupy-sauced bbq pork, but the flavor becomes too repetitive after half the tocino portion is gone and you need something salty to change things up.  Salty, you ask?  DIVE INTO THE BEEF TAPA!  You get what's like beef jerky marinated in salt!!!  Do not fear, it's supposed to be this way!  You were warned!  Ah, now you are thirsty, it's okay, the water is FREEEE!  Alternating with portions of tocino to offset what is the cube of salt that goes into each forkful of tapa beef, we move onto the longganisa... but wait, what does it taste like?  I had this dish a couple of weeks ago.  This item was not memorable, sorry!  I wasn't overwhelmed by salt - no, not at all.  Back to the beef tapa!!!  Just buy a bag of tough beef jerky, dip it in some salt, then try to tear away at it.  Swallow quickly to avoid the cube of salt from dissolving in your mouth.  If this is what you're into, the tapa will be the most memorable part of your meal!  \n\nSeparately, the order of lumpia is a child-sized appetizer for two; or adult-sized for one!  Perfect, I love to eat alone!  A great deal at an outrageous price of $8?  HMM, increase the portion ($8 for 5 or 6 tiny pieces of lumpia?), or drop the price!  At this price, it should at least be wrapped in bacon sprinkled with flecks of gold and blessed by a monk.  What?  Outrageous, yeah?  Anyway, quality of food... I normally love lumpia, but let's call this one \"limpia\" for the level of flaccidity.  Do yourself a favor and get some frozen ones from the store and pan-fry (not deep-fry you say?) it yourself; it will be about the same or better than what I'd experienced at Malasa.\n\nOkay let's be serious, just don't order the combination silog and try something else.

I've never had an owner call me and then talk to the chef at the same time while he's at the farmers market just to plan our meal!  A couple of my friends are Vegan & the owner, Ro, made sure that the chef can accommodate them & made tofu sisig! You just have to call a few days in advance so they can get the ingredients ahead of time. The service was amazing, accommodating & the food didn't disappoint! My husband liked the lechon kawali & I got the pork belly sisig with side of atchara. My friends were impressed with the food presentation, taste & service. We'll definitely come back again.

My go-to drink is the mango-melon cooler (with free re-fills!). \n\nThere's ample space and it hasn't been too busy the couple of times I've went.

I wish they had a heater lol. Even though it's bit cold, the food was worth it. My favorite was their sour pepper sauce that always goes with all Filipino dishes and the fried chicken skin. Their corn beef brisket hash over rice and fried egg is good and I'll request extra fried egg next time too. I'm more of a poached egg fan over the dish which maybe in the future they will have it. Beside it's per preference. Everyone's tastebud is different. The roast pork belly over garlic rice is good and maybe it will be better in small bit size. Overall I love it .. everything is great.

I was confused at first when I arrived and saw the sign said Crawstation, and double-checked the address. Yup, I was at the right place. It's Malasa@Crawstation on the weekends. The place was filled when we got there around 1PM, but luckily a table had just cleared up, so there was no need to wait in line.\n\nTwo of us decided to order the combination platter and my other friend ordered the carne norte. My only complaint is that the food took over twenty minutes to arrive. I was so hungry I gobbled it up in seconds. Overall the platter was good. The egg was fried perfectly, and I liked the garlic fried rice. The longanisa was my favorite of the meats. My friend also ordered the Calamansi drink, which was sort of like Filipino lemonade and it was very refreshing. The carne norte also tasted good. It was a little on the pricier side, as our dishes were all over $10. \n\nDefinitely would come back here, and wish they weren't only open on weekends!", "author": "Christina G."}

The chef at Malasa is so meticulous, I saw him carefully review each plate before it goes out. Skip the silogs unless you're really craving for one. I grew up and love tocilogs and tapsilogs, I got the combo silog and asked them to hold the longganisa and they gave more tapa and tocino. Yes, it was good but didn't blow me away as it's kind of like the basic Filipino breakfast food. Go for one of the brunch specials, they are what propelled Masala to my 5 star review. The Arroz a la Cubana is the most instagramable dish there, it has a cloud of sweet and savory cotton candy that deflates with the warmth of the dish. The ground beef with sofrito brings me back to childhood memories. The banana turon was also excellent, sometimes people caramelize too much sugar on the turon and you just get one note of sweet, Masala does a light caramelization on the turon and also serves it with a cloud of cotton candy and vanilla ice cream.", "author": "Rey L."}

A good option if you're looking to try variety of Filipino favorites. \n\nLongganisa // Generous portion of Filipino-style sausages. Longganisa is known for its distinctly sweet taste. Comes with a fried egg on top of garlic rice. \n\nBottomless Mango-Pineapple Cooler // Definitely way too sweet. Had to dilute with ice-water to stomach it. A bit disappointing and not worth the $5.

I grew up eating Filipino food and it's refreshing to see that more and more restaurants are opening across SF in recent days. \n\nMalasa does a great job in integrating Filipino traditional dishes with familiar ingredients. You won't find caviar, purple flowers, dancing bonita flakes, or spicy nori crips in my grandma's home made dishes. These ingredients just pose a great addition to the traditional dishes and elevates it to culminate into a unique meal. \n\nI highly recommend ordering Arroz Caldo and Silog Combination plate. Arroz Caldo is essentially a rice porridge similar to congee.The flavors of chicken, garlic, egg, and a hint of lemon juice come together in a bowl of awesomeness. It's a tasty warm soup that fills the heart with every spoonful. Moving on to the next recommended dish, the Silog combination plate. Here you get three meats with rice, egg, and a pickled slaw. This combo plate includes Tapa (beef), Tocino (sweet pork), and Longanisa (sweet sausage). The meat is marinated with amazing flavor and you could tell there were no short cuts in making this dish. Here's a little tip that may tickle your fancy. Dig your fork in a piece of meat, dip the meat in vinegar and pair it with a spoonful of rice and egg. Here you got yourself a party in your mouth. You're very welcome. \n\nThe Chef at Malasa is super awesome and is hard at work in getting the Filipino Cuisine out there. He truly values his customers and I've had the pleasure in talking to him a couple of times. One thing that he shared with me is that he's thrilled to see plates clean and empty because it means that you really enjoyed the meal. I sure do each and every time! Come on in on a Saturday or Sunday morning for brunch and clean out your plate! Enjoy! :)", "author": "Briana H."}

The place is always busy so you might have to wait for your food a little longer than you want to depending on the time of service. We had the crispy chicken fries, smoked trout with caviar and garlic rice, and the carne Norte. The beef was outstanding. Their mango-guava juice was refreshing and great way to wash the food down and they offer free refills as well. The food has a unique fusion kind of blend of spices, hotness, and sweetness. The best thing about them are the presentations and the fusion ideas. Their jackfruit banana egg rolls (hot of the pan) deepfried with ice cream over it melted right into the mouth.", "author": "Himadri Shekhar K."}

I would pass on the basic (yes i said it) silogs and try the specials instead. Also note, sometimes the food can take a minute so order the lumpia while you wait.

All the apps were prefecly cooked, were paired with delicious dipping sauces, and we would order them again! For our meals we had the combination silog, the carne Norte, and the lechon kawali. The portions were very generous and the meats were all very flavorful. I especially loved the langanisa . We washed our meals down with delicious house mango pineapple juice.

Actually, I don't think I've ever really eaten at a Filipino restaurant in the city itself.. always outside in Daly City/San Bruno area. I've been here 2x w/ my boyfriend and we've loved the food both times we've gone -- the food is delicious w/ all the Filipino taste done right, it's beautifully presented, and staff is super friendly! What more can you ask for?\n\nSo far here's what we've ordered:\n(1st) - Combo Silog - tapa, longanisa, tocino + this perfectly fried egg. YUM!\n        - Arroz Caldo - deliciousness comfort food. The fried garlic bits are just amazing. \n        - Halo-Halo (w/ lychee jelly. that's a first for me, I think)\n        - Fried Chicken Skin - ommmmmgggggg it's perfect and the sauce that comes with is has the right amount of heat, sour, salty all combined. Watch your cholesterol levels though if you eat this cuz you won't be able to eat just 1 piece\n        - Calamansi Juice - absolute perfection\n        - Mango/Pineapple Juice - too sweet but I still drank it\n\n(2nd) - Tapsilog (just the tapa this time)\n         - Arroz Caldo (again)\n         - Calamansi Mimosa - honestly, it wasn't very good. I'd stick to just the calamansi juice on it's own\n         - Fried Chicken Skin - seriously you should get it. you won't regret it. \n         - Red Horse Beer - this is boozy for breakfast but it's my go-to when I am in the Philippines so it's nice to see it being sold in restaurants\n\n\nI'm really happy that this place opened up so close to my boyfriend's apartment.

I was craving for Filipino breakfast and wanted to try someplace new. The place is nice and clean. They only serve brunch, so the menu is limited. It's more just breakfast. None of those main Filipino dishes. \n\n*I tried the fried chicken skin - crispy and so addicting! It wasn't greasy at all. And the sauce went perfectly well with it. Definitely get this one! You won't regret it.\n\n*Then I ordered the combination plate, which included the tocino, tapa, and longganisa. Whenever I eat these dishes anywhere else, they're pretty much just the frozen ones you can buy at the store (for the tocino and longganisa). But in this place, it actually tastes like it's made from scratch. Very good! And the salted egg & tomato complimented the meal well.\n\n*And you gotta get the halo-halo, best one I've ever had! \n\nI'm Filipino and a picky Filipino food eater. I tend to usually cook Filipino dishes on my own because the ones in the restaurants tend to be too oily or salty. That's why I'm so excited to have found this place! I will definitely be back.

This was my second time at Malasa and the food is still super yummy and filling, with one huge improvement: the service. Last time I came everything was crazy late but they were kind enough to comp our drinks. This time the service matched the quality of the food. I had the tocino silog and my husband had the longanisa silog, both came w a perfectly cooked egg on top. We both came home with leftovers. We also had the cheese sticks w bacon aioli (sooooo good, they use American cheese and when you dip the sticks in what is essentially bacon fat it's so addictive) and the chicken chicharrones w their house made hot sauce, which I wish they would bottle and sell. It's the perfect heat level without losing good flavor. If I had one criticism, it's their mimosas. The price is right ($6) but both juice mixers are off. Wish they'd do a basic oj option.

The ingredients are of quality. The flavors are original and thoughtfully balanced. The presentation is great as well. Whoever creates the menu clearly cares about food, and it definitely shows in their final product. It is authentic filipino food but much healthier and cleaner than usually presented and also with a modern twist.\n\nI've been here 3 times in the past 2 months since discovering it to try different items on their menu. These are my favorite menu items so far: \n\n-crispy chicken chicharon \nomggg BEST Chicharon i've ever had. I love that its chicken instead of the typical pork. It was much thinner (which means crispier!) and less greasy than I'm used to. It came out warm w/ housemade hot sauce. The hot sauce is to die for. I would buy bottles of it if it were available. \n\n-tortang talong \nGenerous portions. If you're a fan of Torta, this is just so tasty. This is probably my current go-to \n\n-carne norte \nI only had a few bites of this but  from what I had it was really good. Savory and comforting. Great for the meat lovers. \n\n-smoked trout\nPortion is smaller but really beautiful presentation really fancy ingredients in there. \n\nThis has easily become my favorite brunch spot in Inner Sunset, and I've been living on Irving for 3 years.

Finding a parking spot was a bit of a challenge specially on a Sunday. This pop up shares the space with Crawstation.  Entire staff were very friendly and attentive. We ordered two of the Carne Norte and one Tortang Talong. The Carne Norte, house made corned beef brisket with potatoes and onions served on garlic rice is a Filipino classic breakfast dish. Of course what Filipino dish without a fried egg on top?  This type of Filipino food is generally called Silog (sinangag which is basically fried rice - typically garlic rice - and itlog which is a fried egg). You can't go wrong with corned beef. It was very tasty (malasa as translated in Tagalog).  I can't remember the last time I had Tortang Talong so I just had to have it. My mom used to make this dish by grilling the eggplant first, and then adding fried ground pork to make a tasty omelette. Malasa's Tortang Talong was vegetarian option. It was served with nori and bonito flakes on top, banana ketchup sauce on the side. The banana ketchup may throw you off if you haven't had it before. It's a slightly sweeter version of a ketchup and goes well with this dish. Overall we were very satisfied with our food.

Hands down the best brunch in the inner sunset-- I'm here every weekend and step by step getting all of my friends and family addicted to the goodness here. My dining companions leave rave reviews as well.\n\nIt's hard enough to find Filipino food in SF proper, and the popup here is one of the best renditions of Filipino breakfast I've had. Not too greasy, tons of flavor with the really carefully selected ingredients, and comforting as can be. Their presentation is also beautiful-- bonus points for that. Not sure what else you would want in a brunch. \n\nI almost always order the arroz caldo, which is the perfect breakfast for any mood. Super flavorful with the brown butter chicken and perfect amount of ginger and green onion, perfectly soothing in it's porridgey texture, definitely my go-to here. The silogs are also the ideal breakfast. You get garlic rice for your carbs, lovingly made meats (recommend the tocino) for your protein, a crispy egg for happiness, and dipping vinegar and pickled green papaya to really take it over the edge of tasty.\n\nThey are constantly adding new items to the menu-- recent faves include the chicken chicharron and the astonishing new trout silog (got to try it during testing, an amazing mouthful of sous vide egg, roe, rice and smoked trout). And the folks here are actually the nicest, you'll leave smiling because your belly is full of joy and you had the loveliest chat while you were stuffing your face.\n\nI want you guys to go so that the popup becomes permanent and they start making Filipino foods during dinner too.
