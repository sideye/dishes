We perused the menu outside on the board as we waited. Sensing we were in a hurry, the kind woman at the register took our order so that once we were seated our food would come quickly. Very thoughtful. \nSo many great options to suit all needs, but we were able to narrow it down. Food came a few minutes after we were seated and settled. \nBacon breakfast- basic and good\nsausage Benedict- whiskey sausage- unique and delicious, nothing overpowering\nkorean street tacos- spicy and packed with flavor chicken fried steak- solid (offered with eggs or mashers n veggies) who doesn't love options!\nService was truly 5 stars. Server checked on us several times before bringing the bill. \nWe finished quickly and when we paid we noticed a discount on the check - VIP. Having never been here before I was not sure how we got this discount, but I believe it was because in chatting she asked if we were in a hurry to get to a show (theater district). We had just come from an outreach event for the homeless and she seemed touched by it. Very sweet of her to extend the discount to our group. \nLove the compassion. We will be back to try the many other items we wanted. Thank you Sam's Diner!", "author": "Elaine S."}

The place is cute and has big TVs without hitting you over the head with diner kitsch.  The servers were great... not too pushy and helpful.  We were sitting near the front and could see how rude the hostess was to people coming in... I don't think she smiled at one person.  So it was a Saturday and they are near the Orpheum, so it is not crazy to think they are busy most Saturdays when there is a show at the Orpheum.  There is no way that the hostess should have been that frazzled.  It really bothered me because I had to watch it for my whole meal. \nThe food was ok. The onion rings were very greasy.  The burgers were good as well, but my hub's burger was a bit under. \nWe are frequent Theatre goers, so we may go back.", "author": "Dawn R."}

Just yelped some restaurants when we got off BART and Sams came up.  I am sooo glad we chose to eat here.  It is super close to the theater, like across the street, the prices were very fair for SF, the portions were large and the food we had was awesome.  My wife had the veggie Korean tacos, which looked great.  My daughter and I split The Rock burger and onion rings.  Our burger was so good, juicy, flavorful....the onion rings were great too.  We will definitely be eating here again.\n\nSams is small, so if you don't have reservations expect a wait.  We snuck in without reservations right before the dinner rush.", "author": "Derrick L."}

We're always looking for good eats near one or the other of the venues in San Francisco and frustration has often been the bi-word between us.\n\nNo longer.\n\nWe've discovered Sam's Diner and boy are we happy!\n\nIt's no more than half a block from the Orpheum...that should be worth five stars in and of itself. Knowing this, the owners have musical memorabilia decorating the place which makes eating her all the more fun.\nLet future diners beware: This place is popular! And, I encountered a line out the door when I arrived. Thankfully, once can make reservations on Yelp to secure a table.\n\nThe food isn't bad either: Typical American bill of fare with hints of Korean Bulgogi almost everywhere! On my first venture out I had the fish and chips, my spouse had the French Dip Sandwhich, and my son had the Bulgogi Burrito. That burrito was monstrous in size! Where he found room to put all that is anyone's guess.\n\nPortions here are generous and even as busy as the place is, the timing of food arrival isn't bad either. \n\nBetter still, the price point works!\n\nSo why not five stars?

They have quick service too. We were a group of 7 and got seated right away. Although the place was packed and it was during lunch, we got our food within 10-15 minutes. \n\nIt's a 3 for now but I most likely will be back to try other items\n\nPS they automatically charge you gratuity for bigger groups and can split up to 5 checks per table.", "author": "Sherluna V."}

I think their burgers are absolutely delicious; I would recommend trying some of their specialty burgers, but another nice alternative is to 'Make your own burger', which already comes with most of the ingredients that you'd want, and you'd simply need to add guac or cheese or something like that. Brings the total cost of the burger to still less than one of their specialty burgers, and it might end up being exactly what you're looking for. I haven't had their salmon salad but my girlfriend always gets it and she loves it, so that's also a good option. A side of sweet potato fries also hits the spot.", "author": "Patrick L."}

We stumble across Sam's Diner, looked at their menu outside and immediately thought this was the place to eat.\n\nThe restaurant is very popular, all tables were full and there is also \"bar\" seating that I didn't noticed until we were leaving.  It is small but the food is good and it comes out fast. Some might say it's a hole in the wall because as you walk past it doesn't catch your attention right away like some big fancy restaurant but people do line up inside and outside to get in.  And when we were there everyone who looked at the menu posted outside went inside and ate.  \n\nThe food is a mixture of American and Korean. They also have a specialty menu such as The Aladdin Menu which has recipes with names based on the show & characters such as Princess Jasmine's Honey Roasted Brussel Sprouts, A Whole New World of Warm Falafel Appetizers, etc.  And they gluten free, vegan and vegetarian choices. Something for everyone.\n\nWe started out with the Bulgogi Loaded Tots. This was tater tots, bulgogi, kimchi, spicy Korean sauce, Chipotle Ailoi and cilantro.  Talk about comfort food whats better then tater tots, kimchi & bulgogi?!!!  I had the Golden Beet Salad which was arugula, spinach, golden beets, feta cheese, jicama, pumpkin seeds and was drizzled with a citrus vinaigrette. Very tasty & refreshing! And my friend order The Giants which had cheddar & jack cheese, avocado, bacon mushroom, lettuce, tomato, pickles,chipotle aioli and she substituted the burger for a chicken breast.  This thing was oozing and dripping everywhere - it was fully loaded! And she said they did not skimp on the bacon, avocado or the 2 cheeses!!   The service was excellent!\n\nIt was fun to eat here as the decor fits the area as far as all the theaters, shows, etc. The walls are lined with various show posters, some are even signed. If you're going to catch some sort of show at the Orpheum, the Warfield, etc., I highly recommend arriving early and walking here to enjoy a good & flavorful relaxing meal.

The area is hurting for more places to eat that doesn't require a nighttime romp through the Tenderloin, so plan ahead if you're hitting the area well before your show. Outside of a gyro place, a meth-infested Burger King, and a Starbucks across the street, Sam's was our only option. Fortunately, they delivered, but in the future I'd get a reservation and spare us the half-hour of loitering on Market Street. \n\nThe theme is old-school American diner meets secret Korean menu, and we were able to order an enormous bacon-avocado-mushroom burger beast (Giants Burger, $16) alongside Bulgogi Tacos ($15). Both were great, but I'd come back for the burgers. They've got a short-but-sweet draft list, and a good variety of wines at super-reasonable prices (about $6/pint). This would be a great spot to linger for an hour or so, but we made good of cramming food in our faces in the 20 minutes before curtain call. Service is quick and friendly, and obviously deals with this all the time. \n\nIt's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall, but the playbill posters and special \"Book of Mormon\" themed menu were nice touches. I'd imagine the bulk of their customers are theatergoers like us, and the whole scene evoked a happy nostalgia of grabbing corned beef hash in Times Square after a show. \n\nIt's close to BART, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here outside of going to the Orpheum.

It was fine though, because the posters from all the previous shows at the Orpheum were signed so it gave us time to talk about which shows we had or hadn't seen.\n\nWhen it came time to order, at least three of us had a tough time choosing between one food option or the other- with the menu boasting things from breakfast classics like eggs benedicts, to brunch specials like stuffed french toast, to lunch fare like korean beef bulgogi tacos, to various sliders and sandwiches, and even honey fried chicken- how does one make up their mind?!\n\nAll jokes aside, I went for the lunch entree version of the country fried steak. The breakfast version comes with sausage gravy, your choice of potatoes, eggs your way, and choice of bread, while the lunch version comes with brown gravy, mashed potatoes, and sauteed veggies. Being a breakfast girl who loves her mashed potatoes, I went for the lunch version, but asked for sausage gravy on the steak. They were able to accommodate me (bless SAM's), and I can vouch for my co-workers when I say we left the place pretty happy.\n\nI'm totally returning if I'm ever in the area again!", "author": "Mary F."}

This probably mattered to us more because one of us was a \"brittle\" diabetic, and the timing of these things for him was crucial.

Being a fan of musical arts my family decided to spontaneously visit the Orpheum theatre. We ended up scoring tickets to Wicked for $40. Which was great but we had so much time to kill.\n\nWe diverted from the appalling Burger King on Market St and walked further more. We stumbled onto Sam's and it was bustling with patrons. The menu is clearly posted in the front window. It is a tiny diner with so much to offer.\n\n\nWe decided to stick to diner type food like the patty melt and a few burgers. It was delicious and really hit the spot! After dealing with SF traffic you get so hungry! This is a great place and service is so-so but hey it's pretty delicious.", "author": "Charlie L."}

My friend found this place on Yelp and the reviews were good.  We made reservations for 6PM & got there on time, we waited for a couple of mins before they sat us. The place was small, but it was not full when they sat us, but within 15mins there was a lot of people waiting for tables.  They have booths, tables & seats at the counter.  Looks like the place was remodeled compared to the pictures we saw on yelp.\n\nThe menu had a nice selection and they had a special menu for the Aladdin play.  I was surprise to see Korean Bulgogi on the regular menu. We ordered the Bulgogi Loaded Tater Tot appetizer, we all ordered different versions of the street tacos (spicy pork, blacken fish & Bulgogi).  For dessert we had a Adffogato, Chocolate Decadence cake & the dessert special a Honey Pistachio Cheesecake.  I cannot say the food was amazing, but it was good & I would go there again.  I heard their hamburgers are really good.  \n\nSo if you were looking for a place to eat before seeing a play at the Orpheum try this place it is a 30 sec walk from the theatre.

I went here with my boyfriend during \"brunch time\" on a Sunday with the mindset of getting a salad.  I tried so hard to get a salad, but there were too many things on the menu I wanted to try.  I pretty much wanted to try all the brunch items.  So at one point, I figure, why am I going to be out and about during brunch just to get a salad?  I got a loco moco instead, which if you don't know is basically the complete opposite of a salad, there's not a single green on it.  But I don't regret it because it was so good!  My boyfriend got the Giants Burger, he seemed to really enjoy it because I couldn't sneak in a bite.  \n\nOn top of the food, we really enjoyed the decor, which features posters from the shows that have played nearby at the Orpheum, it was a fun kind of diner vibe.  It took a little long to get the check though.  Further, for me, Sam's is more on the pricey side, and I can't tell if the portions are big to match the price or if the plate is big to trick you into matching the price.  \n\nOverall, it was a fun dining experience though.

I also got a house salad with my meal. The house salad wasn't really memorable but it also wasn't the worst restaurant salad that I've had. I really enjoyed the bacon macaroni and cheese because there was also added cheese on top (not good for my lactose intolerance but amazing for my taste buds). I also ended up adding the hot sauce they had on the table to cut down a little on the richness of the macaroni and cheese (a personal preference to try and trick my body into thinking it's getting less cheese than I'm actually shoveling in). My brother's sandwich was also really good and would be something that I would try on my next visit (that or the bulgogi burrito). We also got the decadent chocolate cake (mainly because I saw a table across from us get it and I immediately knew I also needed it). The cake was amazing and slightly fudge-y with whip cream, vanilla ice cream, and raspberry sauce on the plate as well\n\nThe seating is also not huge, which can become more noticeable if there is a show going on in the nearby theater because you can make dinner reservations. However, they do also have bar seating if you're not super inclined to be sitting directly across from whomever you're with. Also, when they're slammed it does take a little bit longer to catch a waiter's attention.

On our first visit I had their fish & chips. They were some of the best I have had. My wife had the beet salad and was pleased with her choice. Today I had the spicy pork burrito. The flavor was good. My only issue was that there was too much rice in the burrito. I think it would taste a bit better and be more healthy if there was less rice and maybe some coleslaw inside for some crunch and flavor. Or maybe have it come with a small green salad. My wife had The Cobb salad. This was a bit disappointing. The salads was more of a glorified green salad. It did come with hard boiled egg, avocado and bits of bacon. It was missing the traditional ham & turkey for the extra protein. This is still a great place to go and I recommend that you give it a try.

This place is smaller, holding maybe 30 guest but it was very cute inside. The prices were great and the food quality was very good. Can't go wrong with the breakfast tacos or Benedict.

The neighboring Burger King still attracts quite a campsite of homeless people, some agitated enough to make it something of a minefield to get to the front entrance of SAM's (all CAPS please). Nearly nine years ago, when I first tried this spot, it was a more Korean-oriented cafe with sullen servers and mediocre diner fare that obviously didn't leave a great impression on me. However, for some reason, I started coming back a couple of years ago to find the place under management. The brown naugahyde booths are still there as well as the unused counter, but the menu got bigger.\n\nThe Korean tacos are accounted for, but the rest is much like Denny's redux. The other major improvement has been the attentive service. It appears to be making a big difference in business since the booths are often fully occupied with a microcosm of Market Street life from cops to hipsters with nose rings to armies of tourists representing most of Western Europe nation by nation. I don't look at the menu much since I've ordered the same thing over and over again, the $12 Classic Joe's Special with an additional dollar spent on sauteed mushrooms. It comes with sourdough toast and country potatoes, although I always ask for the hash browns as a substitute. They always oblige (photo: http://bit.ly/1A4u9ms).\n\nTruth be told, it doesn't compare with the Joe's Special served at the Soma Inn Cafe much less at Original Joe's, but it hits the spot anyway with the mix of ground chuck, spinach, onion and scrambled eggs. I squirt a lot of hot sauce on it and even use those little plastic containers of jelly on my toast. But last time, I did order the $12 SAM's Cobb Salad, which was pretty decent with avocado, bacon bits, cucumber, tomato, a hard-boiled egg, blue cheese crumbles and ham with ranch dressing on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1znHe3D). It was hamstrung by a poor $4 cup of their soup du jour, French Onion that was missing the cheese and used salad croutons instead of a baguette slice (photo: http://bit.ly/1DVIvD1).

Can't wait to come back again.\n\nCan't comment too much on food because it was a quick stop before the show.  Mozzerella sticks for appetizer, then we shared a tuna melt with french fries.

By the time we got there we were in a hurry and the staff was very helpful.  We told them what time our show was and they let us place our orders while we were still standing waiting for a table to be cleared.  They were packed and we waited in line at least 20 minutes.  This was kind of a hassle because the place is small and having people lined up at the door pretty much blocks the walkway.  You could tell though that the staff is used to it and they were definitely getting food out quickly and cleaning tables fast so the next customer could get in.\n\nI had the turkey club with fries - the portion size was so big I didn't have time to finish, but they had handy takeout boxes and the theatre sometimes let's you bring in food.  (I say sometimes because the restaurant staff said it would be fine to take our boxes.  We got there and the usher tells us NO.  Shortly thereafter a customer of another hue comes in with a box and he attempted to wave him through until he caught our side eye and told him no too.  We snuck it in anyway:))  The food was good and prices were good, and I thought it was cute that they have show themed items that vary as the shows change.  I would eat here again and make sure I had enough time to really sit down and enjoy it all.", "author": "Ketta R."}

I come in the early morning when they open and Doug is by far the best sever I've seen in the industry. He always checks on you, gives you the specials of the day, offers coffee as soon as you walk in. Honestly, I can't comment on afternoon staff but if you ever meet him, you'll understand.\n\nSummary: hands down this joint is a hidden gem here in the market/civic center district.

I've never seen anything but kind and attentive service.  If you're looking for diner-style comfort food, know that you're also getting a staff that will make you feel comfortable and at home.  For some reason (hmm...), this is a place where I like to come when I'm having a rough day or feel a little under the weather.  I always feel better after my visit.\n\nSo, I like the place.  I've been in about a half-dozen times and I have yet to have anything other than a good experience.  The menu is pretty extensive - Breakfast in the morning (and through out the day), lunch options ranging from sandwiches to salads to burgers to smaller entrees - and some more upscale dinner entrees.  I've always done lunch here - tried the French Dip, Patty Melt, Korean Pork Sandwich, Korean Tacos, Chicken Salad Melt with Avocado.  Is the food such that it will knock your socks off?  No.  It's not supposed to be - it IS supposed to be tasty and reliably satisfying.  After this many visits, I haven't scratched the surface of all the things I'd like to try.  My only knock is that I REALLY wish they had Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup.  \n\nThe set-up is dining room on one-side, counter on the other.  During a work-day, it's nice to escape to the counter and watch a little TV.  They do have a few beers on tap, and a happy hour from 3-6pm.  I'm not sure too many people come here just to drink as it's really a restaurant.  I would say that the prices are not cheap, and may be just a little on the high-side.  But, not egregiously so.  Oh - and, considering the neighborhood, it's a nice escape from some of the rough-and-tumble of the Mid-Market locale.", "author": "Adam S."}

Having eaten many times at the restaurant in the hotel across the street we wanted to find another place as the restaurant had changed its prices and menu. \n\nSomeone recommended Sam's Diner and I'm glad I checked it out on Yelp. The great reviews and ratings, along with being able to make a reservation from the Yelp site, made our decision easy.\n\nFirst, if you are going to see a play at the Orpheum MAKE a reservation if you want to eat here. The restaurant is small/compact with about 20 booths and a long counter with seating. People were waiting outside the door and I saw many turn away rather than wait.\n\nYou can order from the breakfast or lunch menu (there are specials for dinner). There are varied choices, our food was very good, and the service was excellent. Prices are good, too, especially for downtown SF.\n\nI overheard the hostess telling someone they had been open about one month after remodeling. The restaurant has a modern spartan-like look and is very clean. \n\nWe will definitely be back here for lunch every time we head to the Orpheum.", "author": "Rebecca E."}

In my desperation, I suggested SAM's since it was a few feet in front of us. \n\nI ordered an egg scramble of sorts, and was very saddened by the fact that it was bland, wet, and the avocado mushy.

My coffee was very burnt, but I wasn't expecting much at this point. \n\nI do appreciate the fact that SAM's was there in my time of need, but I probably will never be back.

I have come from out of the city just to go to this one restaurant and usually they treat me very well, but today is why I will never eat at SAM's again. \n\nSo a few of my friends and I went to pride today and I told them that we all had to go eat at SAM's because it was my favorite restaurant and everyone had to try it. Went up to the gate, the hostess asked for a name so I gave her my name and then she said it would be about 25 minutes for a party of about 6 to be seated. So we went to go find a bathroom and we were gone for about 5 minutes, we come back and I just wanted to see how long the wait would be then. The same hostess said that they called our name awhile back, but we never showed so they cut our name. I then asked them how long the wait would be again and once again she said 20 minutes. So I waited outside and once again 5 minutes later she calls us in to be seated. \n\nSo we were seated at 2 different tables and our other party couldn't find their money so they couldn't eat and one of our other party members (one that was sitting at the exact same table) was using the restroom. The waitress came by their table quite quickly and asked what they wanted. The 2 that said they weren't going to eat told them that, and without even asking the others she automatically assumed everyone at the table was not going to order also, so she asked all 4 of them to leave. When my friend said that he was going to order and that he was just waiting for his friend to come out of the bathroom the waitress threatened to call the cops on him. So the waitress went and grabbed the owner and even after hearing that they were in fact going to order the owner told him that he had to leave and also threatened to call the cops. So my friend left and we followed behind. \n\nI will never be eating at SAM's Diner again. Gotta find a new favourite restaurant when I come to the city.", "author": "Kiernan S."}

No wait, though I know some people after us had to wait a bit longer. The service was prompt and polite, and they seemed to be working efficiently in a team. The main dining area is built in a long corridor with booths on either side. My only complaint is that access to the bathroom requires having two tables scoot their chairs in to clear the aisle. Not quite a fire hazard, but not a positive. \n\nThe food was good, for the price. I had the stuffed burger special with cole slaw. The burger had a lot of good, meaty flavor. Stuffed with cheese and grilled onions really helped other flavors kind of pop. My girlfriend said she liked her party melt, which was cooked to the right temperature for her. The fries had a good potato flavor and weren't overly seasoned.\n\nOverall, good experience. We'll come back for sure.", "author": "Shane T."}

The problem was, I was on a really important business trip and still had a week of the trip left (plus, I had to go to different cities after).\n\nSo, I read online that throwing together some ingredients like honey, vinegar, lemon, hot water, etc would be an instant relief. I've never tried it but I was desperate. My hotel did not have the ingredients so I started walking along the block trying to find a place and I stumble upon Sam's diner. \n\nKatie was the one who welcomed me into the diner and although she was confused at my request at first (I mean, I would too if there was a girl who came in early in the morning trying to ask for random ingredients instead of a breakfast...heh), she ultimately came to my rescue as she let me make my sore throat relief there.\n\nThanks to her and the diner for graciously letting me borrow some ingredients, I didn't get a cold and my sore throat was gone. I'd sincerely like to thank Katie and this diner, and next time I go to SF, I will definitely visit and get some food here!! I'll also have my SF friends go there on my behalf to support them as well :)\n\nUntil then, I would recommend this place based on the customer service, as I'm super picky about customer service and which establishments to support because of the service level.", "author": "Jenni Y."}

Sadly, despite the great relationship our executives have with the restaurant (and the great treatment my colleagues get when wait staff know who they are and where they work), my experience as a customer has been seriously negative. The service is just bad. Wrong orders, neglect, long wait times--it's always something.\n\nLast night, for example, my friend and I needed to grab a bite in the area. I warned her the place has not-the-best service, and to cross her fingers that tonight would somehow finally be different. Unfortunately not. We waited to be seated, per the sign, but were ignored by passing staff. I finally hailed down a guy and got permission to take bar seats. When it was time to order, I wanted a milkshake, but was told by the waitress that they were understaffed and that due to the length of time required/difficulty of milkshake-making, it might not be possible. She said she'd check and bring my second choice (a soda) if the answer was no. Literally five seconds later, a soda was dropped off. I highly doubt any \"checking\" happened--but even if it did, is that right? I mean, you're not out of vanilla milkshake. You just didn't want to make it.\n\nThe food itself is fine. Nothing to write home about, but reliable. I prefer their breakfast to their lunch/dinner. The place has tater tots, so yay for that! I'll continue to eat lunch here since there's not a lot of affordable food in the direct vicinity. But I always drag my feet a little when coworkers choose Sam's as our lunch spot for the day. You can't beat it in terms of convenience, but I just wish every customer got the attention and consideration the diner gives to my office's executives.", "author": "Maura D."}

Because I was on work travel alone, I chose the bar.\n\nMy server tipped me off that it was still happy hour and pointed me to the beers on tap. I wasn't expecting beers at all, let alone on tap.

I could have also had a couple IPAs, a Full Moon, an Angry Orchard, or a stout. Coors Light was on the list for people's dads, and I appreciate that.\n\nFeeling encouraged by the friendly reception and beer options, I skipped the usual diner food and ordered a chicken burrito.\n\nIt came out fast, and well presented, but it let me down a bit. The rice wasn't noticeably seasoned and had a wet, sad texture like it was waiting to become a casserole. The chicken was really high quality meat, but also unseasoned. The cheese was fine. The beans were bland. The chips were a bit stale and boring, and they were served with a salsa that had lots of heat but no flavor otherwise.\n\nI was hungry and scarfed it down anyway. I score this place high because of the great, professional waiters, and the totally good beer selection.

I am always a sucker for special menus with special prices, and if you tell them you are going to the show, you actually get 10% off of your meal you get there too. Pretty good deal. \n\nPlus they have a beer and wine license now (so yes that means the bloody mary on their cocktail list is not made with vodka, so beware!). $4.50 for most beers on tap is pretty good, but $4 for a PBR in a bottle? That is kind of nuts, even for SF prices. \n\nFood wise, we were all pretty happy with our dishes--I got their crab melt which was toasted pretty much perfectly and had an ample amount of avocado in it too which was the really reason I ordered it (I may have a clinical obsession for things with avocado ha). Adam G. got their honey fried chicken which was pretty darn tasty and very moist inside, but I have to say the coleslaw and the potatoes were just so so. My dad got the steak and minus a few pieces of fat on it he had to eat around, he was pretty content indeed. And my mom got the lion named burger and it was pretty big, almost like a lion. We ended with the chocolate molten cake which also was good, but we all sort of felt like have we had better diner food elsewhere? Sure. But can you get much better than this being a block from the theater? Probably not. Although there is a burger king next door if that is your thing :-)", "author": "Sarah G."}

But, they only serve them until 3pm. Boo. So, I look at my menu and saw that they had a crab melt. I told my friends that I wanted to get that and they said that they didn't see it on their menu. I look at their menu to find that the crab melt was blacked out of their menus. UGH. \n\nTake 3. I saw that their french toast special was being served all day. So when the waiter comes I told him that I wanted their french toast special. He says \"Normally we would serve breakfast all day, but we cannot make it today with the large increase of customers\". Sooo, basically he told me that they didn't want to make it.\n\nSo, I went with a tuna melt. \n\nIt took about 40 minutes before our food came out. WE WERE STARVING. My tuna melt was dry and the cheese wasn't even melty. The fries that came with them are shoestring fries and were cooked perfectly.\n\nMy friends ordered truffle fries as an appetizer. It never showed up, so we asked the waiter. He was honest and told us that he forgot to write it down and asked if we still wanted it. We said yes. \n\nIt came in about 10 minutes. \n\nI might come back to try it again...maybe get a benny. I like to give places 2nd chances if there is potential.

Typically I wait until I've actually given a place a few tries before writing a review as I like to have full experience etc.\n\nWell unfortunately over the weekend, I was staying up in SF & decided to try here again for breakfast Sunday morning & well, I'll never eat at Sam's again. First off the service was terrible. I had to track actually flag the hostess for Coffee refills as my waitress   spent more time in back of the restaurant than paying attention to her customers. I ordered by breakfast Biscuits & Gravy with eggs & bacon & wanted Pancakes so the waitress told me I could substitute my Hash Browns with the Pancakes. I thought cool perfect do that then.\n\nAs I sat waiting for my meal I noticed that the music choice was quite a bit of gangster rap? odd music choice for a  restaurant, but eh, it is SF right?\n\nMY order comes out & it looked amazing, tasted great at the time,  but I was still a bit frustrated that my waitress not one time checked on mew or refilled my coffee. The next time I saw her, she went scooting by and dropped my receipt off mid meal saying I think you'll need this and was gone before I could ask for more coffee. This was the last time I saw her, and upon finally finishing my meal saw that I had been charged for my regular meal & a short stack of pancakes, not been given a substitution (this was like an extra 8 bucks)  so I basically bought 2 breakfasts & didn't even get the hashed brows. I asked the hostess about it & of course my waitress was on break, and they couldn't adjust the charge so I paid figuring I was not going to be bringing my business back here until I spoke to a manager about this experience. (There was not one available & Since I work around the corner in 11th street I planned to stop by this week)  Needless to say, rather than let my blood boil or have an argument to start my day I paid my bill and left a small tip.\n\nSO here it is Tuesday, & I'm home sick with what the Doctor believes in a Norovirus infection, I.E. Food poisoning. How do I know it was from Sam's? Basically I didn't stop and eat anywhere else that day, I was at a concert & did not feel like paying for over priced anything there.\n\nBad service + bad food + food poisoning = I'll never touch this place again which sucks after having such a great first experience.

And Sam's is the hardest-working little diner in town. \n\nI have to admit I've never remembered to see if they have an accessible bathroom. I should do that. The restaurant itself is tight and narrow, but they've always found room for my wheelchair (and sometimes another one besides mine). \n\nThe service is speedy, hard-working as heck, and they're all just darned nice folks. If sometimes the kitchen gets a little backed up during rush hours, you certainly won't see anybody idle around the shop. \n\nThe diner staples are tasty good stuff, and the Korean smells really, really good. I seem to mostly come here for breakfast-ish, and I can't face spicy food for breakfast, so I haven't really tried the Asian stuff as often. But I can reliably get a tasty omelet that isn't a puddle of grease at a good price. The pastrami was surprisingly tasty stuff. Good sandwiches, good burgers, good basic diner food.\n\nIf you're looking for after-event food, especially something that's affordable or kid-safe, I totally recommend this place. If you're just in the neighborhood, be aware that they get swamped when the Orpheum lets out and maybe eat some other hour. If you work around here, come on by for lunch some time. (No, don't ask for a Twitter discount. I know what you Twitterpates get paid.) Free wi-fi and big tables if you gotta work. IN a hotel nearby? Sam's breakfast is probably cheaper AND better than theirs, if they offer one.\n\nThe real hidden gem: their beer taps. They've stocking all US microbrews, with a few concessions for the tourists, and of course they have Anchor Steam like they oughta. Want a relatively quiet place to watch the game? Order some beer and appetizers and watch the TV.\n\nAnd you've got to give them credit for trying so hard. They may be the cleanest restaurant on Mid-Market, and some of the best service. Every time I come here it seems they've made another small improvement to the building, the menu, the kitchen. They're a scrappy little local business working their butts off to be successful, and I just want to hug the whole restaurant.", "author": "Anne K."}

I enjoyed my breakfast.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/4228xqg\n\n5.  Fruit Cup - The person I was eating with ordered the fruit cup.  It looked very appetizing.  The fruit was obviously fresh. There were strawberries, melon, grapes, and a blackberry.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/44u66pf\n\n6.  Sam's Diner is a good spot for breakfast.  I would not necessarily go out of the way to go there.  After all, that stretch of Market Street isn't really the nicest part of San Francisco.  But, if you are in the area or need to meet someone in the area, Sam's is a nice alternative for a decent breakfast or lunch.", "author": "Mark D."}

Came for a pre-Orpheum dinner, and luckily had called in the morning for a reservation because the pre-dinner crowd is big. Unluckily, the woman who took my reservation managed to list my name as \"Courrtnney\" and the listed time as 6:15 am, so they had problems finding my reservation. A waiter came over and assured us they'd manage to seat us somehow -- and then a second waiter was the one who realized that my reservation had gotten listed under a badly written name and incorrect time. Points to both of them for handling it well AND figuring out what happened.\n\nThe outside looks a bit rundown, but the renovations inside are indeed quite nice. I like the signed show posters framed on the wall -- gets you in the mood for your post-dinner show! We ordered off the special pre-show menu: dungeoness crab melt and seared sole. Crab melt: plenty of crab and the avocado was a good addition. The scallion aioli indeed tasted scalliony and complemented the flavor well. Fries were standard. The sole was a surprisingly large piece of fish. The roasted tomato salsa on it was so-so (tasted a bit canned) but had more of a kick than I expected (a good thing!) and the mascarpone polenta was fantastic. The veggie side was also perfectly cooked and not mushy at all. \n\nService was quick and super friendly, and we liked the new booths. Definitely make reservations if it's a show night. We'll be back for future pre-show meals!", "author": "Corinne C."}

I've been going to the theater for years, always rushing to find a place to eat before the show - always anxious about getting our meal in time for the show.  We've been to several places and just discovered Sam's Diner, just half a block from the Orpheum on Market.  It's a little place and the food is like any diner fare but with a bit of fancier fare for theater nights.  \n\nWe ordered the clams, the crab melt and salmon teriyaki for dinner.  They were done nicely and I was surprised at the portion size of the salmon. I'm used to a tiny piece of fish but this piece was huge - I could barely finish it.  The taste is standard teriyaki grilled.  \n\nWhat really stood out was the service - they really work hard to get you out the door on time for the show. They're very personable and really want to make sure your food is to your liking.  \n\nI was going to give them a 4 star rating but being so close to the Orpheum, with decent food and decent prices, I'll give it 5 stars.  It's not a romantic place, or a gastro-phenomenon, but it's a great place for a good meal right before the theater, and just down the street.", "author": "Bon J."}

They accepted a reservation a mere three days beforehand and that was a super good idea because the places was packed. There were already two other big groups there so without a reservation, we probably wouldn't have gotten a place.\n\nFOOD: It's typical diner food and I had a hard time choosing because nothing really seemed THAT good. However, from the various dishes I tasted, nothing tasted bad. Everything tasted pretty good. I got the chicken-fried steak which came with mashed potatoes and gravy and some garlic roasted veggies. The steak was super tender and the gravy was awesome.\n\nSERVICE: The minute we got seated, I knew we shouldn't expect excellent service because the place was so busy. I could see that all the waiters/waitresses were running around trying to get everyone served and all the cooks were cooking away. Seriously. I saw knives flying and the stove was so hot, you could swear they were doing some flambe back there. So, yes, the food came out slowly, it was hard to get the staff's attention, and we had to wait a long time to get things that we asked for...BUT like I said, I was expecting it: it was show night at the Orpheum (literally a block away) and we were a party of 13. \n\nSome pros of the service which I highly respect them for:\n-they split our checks whichever way we wanted: individually, groups, partners, etc. Whatever we asked for \n-upon request, they also prepped our checks while we were eating so that we could just sign and leave when we wanted\n-the waitress was just really genuine in that she really wanted to help us get everything in order and was apologetic when it wasn't\n-the owner of the restaurant came to check up on us at the end and reassure us that we had plenty of time until the show started to finish eating and get out of there\n-we had a birthday in the group and the owner brought over a mini molten chocolate cake with ice cream. SO YUM.\n\nAll in all, I think I would definitely come back here if I had to eat at a restaurant around the Orpheum. It's a diamond in the rough of the Tenderloin. I just might come 2.5 hours earlier than the show instead of 2. And maybe come with a smaller crowd!", "author": "Katherine K."}

Time for a late but quick lunch.\n\nThe fast food joints didn't appeal to me. I stumbled upon this place as I walked toward the museum.\n\nSat at the bar. Ordered the corned beef hash benedict. That's corned beef hash with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce with hash browns. I ordered the eggs over medium. That means it'll run, but not all over the place.\n\nI'm a patient person, but my patience has limits. After 25 minutes of waiting, I had to ask the waitress what's going on. Her eyes begged for more patience and so did her words. As I was about to walk out hungry, disappointed and angry after 30 min of waiting, my food showed up.\n\nGrades:\n\nFood: A\nI have nothing against the food; it was actually very good. The hash browns were nice and crispy. The hollandaise tasted fresh. The hash was moist and delicious. Obviously, the 2 stars above this review is not about the food alone.\n\n\nAppearance: It was 3 PM. The place looks and feels like a normal diner. Not too clean, which means business is slow, but not too messy, which means they need to clean the place up.\n\nService: C\nThis is where the problem lies. During the 25 minute wait, I tried to make eye contact with my waitress, but I didn't want to bother her, as she is hella busy. Amidst the apology she made about the unreasonable wait, there was a mention of a grill that started from cold and how it had to be heat up. What?!? The grill was cold? How about the other grills the cooks were using and slinging food from. Were they cold?\n\nHer apology was heartfelt, as it was clearly not her fault, but I really wish she'd check in on me every once in a while and offered me something to eat. If there was a delay in serving me or anyone, I'd like to be told why, and I wasn't.\n\nUltimately, she gave me a discount for the wait. That quelled my anger somewhat. Still, a) I resent being ignored and b) that didn't make up for it.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI would eat here again, if I head down this way on foot. I really liked what I had and would like to try the country fried steak. If the service improves, they get more stars. Is that a deal, Sam's Diner?", "author": "Alex L."}

Spent 20 minutes yelping, searching for the primest most perfect nook. Took off on my bike and got to my decided on place and sadly realized it just wouldn't do. Cold, annoyingly hungry, meandered and yelped more and went to \"lunch sack\" where I got a miserable, oily, egg croissant sandwich. Downed that and only whetted my appetite. Walked the WRONG way to \"SAMs diner\" which on yelp looked like the exact thing my heart desired, and a poop emergency beseeched me to locate it immediately. Finally arrived. Watched the news with old men and sipped my Bloody Mary. Ordered a veg omm with hash browns. Awaited the satiety that surely awaited me with a ring of the kitchen bell. \nWhat was placed in front of me was the soggiest, spongiest, lowest quality excuse for an omelette that my face contorted with disgust as I put a forkful of cheese-lava'd yuck into my mouth. The Sysco vegetables tasted like they were carved from a stack of holiday print napkins and I wanted to cry \"help!\" and make the waitress get it out of my sight.\nMoved on with a heavy heart to the hash browns. Or should I say \"hash blechs\". Had to CUT each bite with a fork and knife they were so overcooked. No amount of squeeze-bottle ketchup could mask the nothing flavor of disappointment.

The food service was SLOW. They apologized and said it was due to a computer/printer malfunction. They gave us complimentary beef barley soup and deep-fried cheese sticks to attempt to make up for it.\n\nThe soup was \"OK\"; the cheese sticks weren't \"gooey\" enough on the inside -- they were still too firm. Finally the food arrived and we were told our bill would be adjusted to offset the long wait.\n\nDespite being apologetic and making a sincere effort to make up for the long wait with free food, our entrees were nothing special. So, even if the service were flawless, I can't see myself going back for the food.", "author": "Paul L."}

This place definitely fit the bill. I was very surprised at the draft selection they had available and the menu did have some interesting fusion items that you wouldn't expect at a diner. \n\nI got the Biscuits and Gravy special which was above average. The only disappointing part was how little gravy was actually available on the biscuit. I also asked for a bowl of clam chowder which the waiter offered to give to me for free which was a definite plus in my book. The clam chowder was good as well although I do prefer it to a bit thicker.\n\nMy friend got the Chicken Fried steak which also looked good. The only complaint he had was that the used a brown gravy on it instead of country gravy. \n\nAnother friend of mind opted for the special Korean tacos which he said was very good. \n\nService was very prompt and friendly. The decor was quite nice too with signed cast posters of different shows.", "author": "Richard T."}

But what really made me cringe was that one of the servers was chastising my server right at the counter, repeatedly. It made me feel bad for my server. She seemed nice enough, and got my order right, and while it took me a while to get a fork, that's probably because she was being sent off to restock a bunch of supplies in urgent, annoyed tones.\n\nI would try this place again, but perhaps at a different time of day.", "author": "James M."}

The salads come with fresh, healthy looking greens...not the sad defeated greens you often find at diners.  The staff have been unwaveringly nice and there's a nice, friendly vibe at the bar.  For only complaint I have is that sometimes it takes awhile to get your check, which is irritating during lunch break.

The waiter was very friendly and gave good recommendations when i asked him about the menu.  I ordered the daily special, baked chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies and soup on the side.  The soup de jour was vegetable -- kinda like minestrone but without the pasta.  Very nice.  The main dish was surprisingly good as well -- chicken was very tender and juicy and nicely herbed, mashed potatoes and veggies were uncomplicated and the gravy was rich and pretty salty--but I like it that way.\n\nI had apple pie a la mode for desert which was a huge portion I couldn't finish...also good.\n\nAlthough I didn't order one, they have a nice variety of beers, domestic and imports, on tap.\n\nOther than the daily special, the waiter had highly recommended the Korean tacos, their burgers (which are ground and formed on premises), and the teriyaki dishes, which looked generous.\n\nService was wonderful, food was delicious and exceeded my expectations.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying something else.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-13", "description": "We were looking for some place good to eat, near the Orpheum Theater that served food that could be kid friendly.\n\nLet me start by saying that there is NOT a lot of upscale choices within safe walking distance.  That section of town is super sketchy and a lot of places are more geared toward breakfast and lunch for on the go Art institute students or the odd businessperson.  You DO NOT want to walk around that hood.  SAM's is right on Market and minutes from the theater.\n\nIt's a diner but the interior has been recently updated and looks really nice.  The counter/bar area has a nice warm sports bar feel.  The seating side is banquet tables and four tops.  Decorated with signed posters from the various shows that have been through the Orpheum.\n\nNow to the food.  While they don't have a \"kid's menu\", they did have chicken strips (made with actual chicken breast - go figure!) and fries.  Kid was very happy with that.\n\nAdults were happy with the menu too.  We ordered the open faced Hot Roast Beef, SAM's Spicy Pork Sandwich and the House Special Chuck Three Burger.  Barely had a chance to see the Burger, it was huge and delicious and there was a hungry 17 year old boy waiting to inhale it.  He gave it rave reviews.  The Hot Roast Beef was thinly sliced and mouth watering.  Very good!  Served with steamed mixed veg that actually looked pretty darn fresh!  The Spicy Pork Sandwich was amazing.  Think about a spicy Korean pork, grilled and yummy on a really good french roll, also grilled on the flat top and then throw on some crunchy Asian slaw!  \n\nAs for the service, place was packed with other people going to the theater.  We had about 45 minutes from the time we sat down until the curtain time and we were able to make it.  The staff is very friendly and kept assuring us that we would be fine.  \n\nOne note on the pictures posted here by others.  The food looks WAY better in person.\n\nI WILL go back, the hard question will be what to order.  That pork was really good.......", "author": "Kimberly G."}

It had been a nerve racking few days so far and I was pretty stressed out.  Finally one morning I woke up and decided to go find a place to eat some breakfast before continuing my grand search for a new abode.  I walk out the door into the bright sunlight, a little hungover from my discovering the Toronado the night prior, and right across the street from me I see a blue sign that reads \"Sam's Diner\".\n\nNow let me explain something here.  I have a real weak spot for a proper diner.  Not some kind of cliched  nostalgia franchise like Mel's, but a real honest to god diner.  Needless to say, I was pleased when I walked in.  There you had a real lunch counter, a cook manning the grill like he was born with a spatula in his hand, cute waitresses that seemed to know all their regular customers by name (and from what I saw, that's a lot of people), and old guys reading their papers while drinking their coffee.  It's the kind of joint that you walk into and immediately feel at home.  \n\nSo I sat down at the counter, looked over the menu and ordered a T-Rex omelette with hash browns and sourdough toast.  The coffee was good and strong, and in no time flat my meal had arrived.  It was exactly what it was supposed to be.  Simple diner/greasy spoon food.  Nothing fancy, exotic, or all that amazingly great, but just exactly what you'd expect from this kind of place.  This isn't the kind of place to visit with lofty epicurean requirements but it's one of those places that if you really get it, you'll love it.  Later that day I went on to sign a lease for a place on the way to the airport to leave town, and had a nightmare of a time getting back to Texas, but at least I had that hour of calm at Sam's.", "author": "Joshua W."}

I wanted a sit-down restaurant that was walking distance, not pricey and open for dinner. Most of the places in that area are closed after lunch so it was slim pickin'. \n\nSam's worked out perfectly. It's open for dinner and It wasn't crowded so we got a table immediately. I don't know if it's never crowded because of the neighborhood (you have to admit, Civic Center in SF is not the safest of places to walk around at night) or because we were early (5ish). Distance wise, we were about 2 blocks away from the auditorium. Price wasn't bad, I would say average for what we got.\n\nI had the pork chops which were grilled and they gave you 2 cuts. It came with soup or salad, mash potatoes and gravy and mixed vegetables (not the frozen kind either). My daughter had the fish and chips and cole slaw.

That's pretty much the standard commentary about my most beloved breakfast spot in San Francisco. Might go as far as saying best breakfast in SF, but I know and have tried a number of quirky and fun joints with their own claim to break-fast fame. \n\nThe wait can seem interminably long on occasion, but worth it every time. \n\nThe location may not seem like much, the doorway almost a literal hole in the brick wall. \n\nNot much else going on around it, kind of the dead zone on Market stuck between the bustle of Lower Market / Downtown and Upper Market / Castro, but dang is the food worth it. \n\nTry any of their omelets, you'll be hard pressed to finish, although the helpings are ample without being ridiculous. Baja - sour cream, pico, cheese (ask for cheddar as American is the standard and not real cheese FYI,) hashbrowns and toast of your choice. Or the Texas - chilli, sour cream and cheese, hasbrowns, and toast. \n\nMaybe feeling sweet toothy? Try the French Toast, and cinnamon that ess. It's fantab. \n\nThe eggs are always quality, although I've yet to lunch or dine there. Can't make the wait past breakfast. But the lunch plates and steak plates and salads all look delish on the way to their consumers. \n\nThe service is pretty great, depending on who you get, but as I frequent the establishment, they know my order by heart, embellishments, add-ons and all, And for me that means a lot. They smile when they see you and get your order good. \n\nAnd per its location and the salty crowd of the civic-loin nabe, there's almost always bound to be a funny attempted check-skipping, which rarely goes off as planned - these chicas will chase you down the street to get that payment filled. Don't think you're getting away clean here. I like to cheer them on. \n\nThe coffee's wonderful esp for dinar brew. They're always on top of the refills. Mr. Pink would tip here.", "author": "Kelly S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-06-09", "description": "I don't like to write bad reviews. I especially don't like to write bad reviews of independent authentic diner type restaurants in San Francisco, because they're few and far between in this city of caramelized drizzled arugula that gets plated for the mere pittance of $34.95 plus the health care surcharge at fine establishments all over town. \n\nI LOVE places like Sam's Diner. I've been to Sam's quite a few times now because the food is excellent. But, more than once, the service has been horrible. And today was the worst of all.\n\nKnowing that the service can be slow to slovenly (even though the waiters/waitresses usually look like they're about to break the sound barrier) I asked my friend who arrived first to order for me; I get an hour for lunch, no wiggle room. She sat down. After a few minutes of feeling invisible, she flagged down a waitress, who said, \"I'm not your server-- can you wait five minutes?\" Five minutes later, another waitress did come by. My friend said she wanted to order for two people (I was still racing to get there). The waitress said, \"Why don't you wait until the other person gets here!!!!????!\"\n\nUm, maybe because we know from bitter experience that service at Sam's can be slower than fossilized molasses. And anyway, why do you care? Just take the order!\n\nThen I arrive and, oh holy miracle, the food arrives a few minutes after I do.\n\nThe water, though, got there before me. Small glasses, half full. Note to Sam's: if your servers have trouble getting to all their tables at reasonable intervals, they should probably FILL the water glasses to brimming the first time. Because it might be the last time.\n\nThe food, as usual, was good. We managed to spend some time talking about something besides the horrific service we were getting.  At one point I even sighted our waiter and somehow conveyed to him the fact that I needed more water. He brought it right away ('right away' at Sam's means 'in less than ten minutes'). But just as he started to rush off again I bit on something hard and plasticky in my sandwich. I pulled it out. It was plastic. I immediately got another jolt of plastic from the same mouthful and removed that too. After two or three tries I got the waiter to stop and listen to my story. He earnestly took the plastic and huddled with another server, then disappeared again for ten minutes.\n\nThat was the last we heard of the plastic. No free meal. No discount. No apology. It was as if, like the service at Sam's, the plastic simply didn't exist. \n\nMy friend wanted me to complain, and almost took matters into her own hands. But I told her that if the plastic was not acknowledged I would just make sure to write a review of Sam's. \n\nSam's is one of those places where sometimes they bring you the check and sometimes they just expect you to pay at the register in front. As my lunch hour was by now rapidly dwindling, I asked our waiter how I should pay the bill this time. He said \"I'll bring you the check!\"\n\nFive minutes. Ten. Twelve. We walked to the front register. He was there, cheerfully ringing up our bill. Such service!\n\nHe said, \"Thanks, folks! Have a great day!\" We said nothing. Until we got out on the sidewalk. Even then our angry words were cut short by the fact that I had to rush back to work.\n\nWe did decide that the best service at Sam's seems to coincide with the presence of the owner/manager (I'm not sure of her actual title). Of course, she was not there on this fated day.\n\nOh Sam's, I love your food. But not your service.", "author": "Robert C."}

I was hoping for a salad stuffed in a tortilla, but ended up with a bland carb-fest. Also, VEGGIE BURRITO + COFFEE + TIP = $14. Think about that...

They have 1000000% times better french fries than Sam's. Seriously, Sam's fries are terrible and bland. The burger is still amazing, but honestly I want to take the three chuck burger to-go and buy the french fries at Munch Haven. \n\nSo after living on Market and 8th for a while, I can safely say there are WAY better and cheaper places to go to than Sam's. \n\nSam's Diner = Bland.", "author": "kevin l."}

Today I was happy to bring a friend here for the first time, before a \"Wicked\" matinee,  and the food was tasty for both of us, but the Cobb Salad I ordered was incomplete.  Halfway through eating it, I realized that it didn't have avocado on it.  I flagged the waitress down and asked her if the Cobb salad should have avocado on it, and she said, \"No.\" Thinking I must have been mistaken, I kept eating, but something told me to check the menu.  When I did, I realized it was missing both the avocado AND the bacon.  When I flagged her down again, and showed her the menu, she apologized, took the half-eaten salad back to the kitchen and came back with it now with avocado and bacon on top.  Of course, the salad wasn't as good as it otherwise would have been, since it was now somewhat overbalanced with those ingredients.  I thought it was very strange that a waitress should be so unfamiliar with what she was serving.  But I'll go back.", "author": "Tricia T."}

My sister and I were staying downtown and needed a solid breakfast to get our day started. From the moment we walked in the service was prompt! After having our mouths water over basically the whole menu I decided to order eggs benedict with a side of bacon and my sis ordered a crab sandwhich melt. The food was FABULOUS! It was so flavorful and came out piping hot! Our waitress never left our beverages half empty and constantly checked on us to see if we needed anything, as a mater of fact all of the waitress checked in on us. This is some of the best service I have had in years, I was talking to the waitress and she said she would for go her tip as long as we promissed to revue this place on yelp, well we left a 20% tip and there was no way I could not let people who plan on eating at this place know how great it is. They are owned by a korean women who is also one of the head chefs, so they have lots of yummy korean fusion items on the menu.

In this sense, I am more impressed by well executed service, eggs, bacon, toast, burger etc...than I am by a menu that is extensive or exquisite.  In this regard, I think SAM's offers a well made breakfast.  There are some nice surprises like a really well made hollandaise sauce for their eggs benedict, and burgers that have a really nice lean-to-fat ratio.\n\n--The sports games you want to watch are always on at the black granite bar.\n\n--Happy hour selection of food/drinks for after work.\n\n--Well made soups by the owner's mother that are made in small batches and often overlooked.\n\nCons:\n--It is hard to branch out away from the basics here, spaghetti dishes and quesadillas taste like homemade (not in the way you'd really like) and salads are not markedly fresh.  The one exception is a hamburger called The Chuck Three, a  cheeseburger with mushroom, avocado and bacon that is a heart-clogging-i-don't-care-if-i-die-because-im-already-in-heaven kinda thing.\n\n--The staff here can, at times, be incredibly rude.  During my last visit I was tired from work and wanted to get-in-get-out with some food.  An Asian waitress came over to me and said \"Oh, you finally learned how to order one meal at a time?\" snidely which left me completely shocked, and sadly, not wanting to spend any more money at this place.\n\nOverall, a solid diner that will meet your needs for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Prices are decent and essential dishes made well.", "author": "Martin C."}

The breast was slightly dry, but my other friend said his was not. The leg, thigh, and wing was prefect! My friends said the Philly was pretty good as well.

SO GLAD WE DID! \nThere were 3 - 4 wait staff - each and everyone was friendly, and as each of them cruised by our table, each was attentive to our needs when they passed by. It appeared that every one of them was intent on making sure we had what we needed. \nThe quality of the food was exceptionally good - exceeded our expectations because of it being called a \"diner.\" \nThe onion rings were excellent as our appetizer; their \"house\" wine (their only wine offerings) were very good!\nHe ordered crab/avocado sandwich with french fries. Excellent sandwich; lots of crab and avocado. The french fries were crisp, tasty, not greasy (as good as, or even better than McDonalds - if you think MickeyD's hold the standard for ff's).\nShe ordered Korean Tacos - OMG - loved them! Ordered the spicy pork. He was warned by the waiter that these were very spicy - found them to be just perfect! \nCame with rice with cilantro - wow - what a great combination! Will have to do that at home!\nThe food and service were excellent. When we were leaving, a couple who was waiting for a table, asked us on the sly what we thought of the food. We never hesitated to tell them it was excellent, and she recommended the Korean Tacos.\nIf we go the Orpheum again, we will certainly return.\n(FYI - check for specials associated with this restaurant if you attend a performance at the Orpheum.

We were seated immediately but had to wait a good 5 minutes to even get water in a nearly empty restaurant. The server never returned to the table except to take our order and deliver our food. When one person asked for water he rolled his eyes and walked away. After finally getting our check (another very long wait) we placed two cards down to split the bill. The server came back (insert another long wait) and informed us that he was \"far too busy to split our bill.\" Mind you, we simply asked to equally divide our $90 bill for four people between two credit cards. Slightly confused I asked one more time thinking I had misheard the server and was told that \"I could obviously see he had a very busy section and he didn't want to mess with splitting a check.\" I was floored!! I could not believe that I was being told he was too busy to do his JOB. I've waited tables for years, splitting a check is one of the easiest things you can possibly do. It actually took longer for him to argue with us over not splitting the check than it would have taken to just split the check. I might be able to understand if there had been a lot of people, complicated orders, and multiple split tabs, but seriously? You can't split a bill for four people two ways?

It was an hour before the play and  my friend and I were a little stressed.  Our server was very reassuring that he'll have us out of there well in time for the play.  I even had the audacity to get the filet of sole (which I enjoyed) and not a quick sandwich.  My friend even insisted I get a dessert to celebrate my birthday.  Our server was flirty but not annoying.  The food and service were fantastic!\n\nThe second time (just last Saturday) was a different experience.  My husband and I got there around 7:00, and there were 2 parties ahead of us.  By 7:10 and we were the next up, we asked the friendly Asian hostess if we can still make it in time for our 8 pm show.  She said definitely, they'll make sure of it, as long as we already have our tickets.  By 7:15, it was clear that most of the diners have finished their meals but just killing time to leave just in time for the play (shame on you diners!) and I can tell the hostess was also getting stressed out and giving instructions to servers (to possibly encourage diners to leave?).  By 7:20, nobody has left and I told my husband there's no way we'll make it so we split (sorry!).  I realize we're at fault for not arriving earlier, that's why I'm still giving them the highest rating.\n\nAfter the play, around 10:30, we decided on a whim to go back there to have some dessert (maybe for closure?).  We were seated by a very nice and charming gentleman who seemed to take care of the whole place that late in the evening.  Once we got our lava cake and coffees, my husband (again on a whim) asked if it was possible to still order food.  I nervously asked what time they close and he said in about 10 minutes but it's no problem at all.  My husband ordered the crab melt which he had been eyeing since earlier in the evening.  The gentleman (sorry I didn't catch your name!) never rushed us or made us feel uncomfortable, even refilling our coffees when needed.  I did notice that there were about 3 more parties dining so we never felt pressured.  It was such a nice ending after a distressing start.

We waited and waited and waited and while waiting I overheard our waitress telling a couple at another table nearby that the joint ran out of eggs. I was hoping that they hadn't run out for our order. This hope was further fueled by the fact that she walked passed our table a couple of times and didn't alert us they had ran out of eggs.

Seriously, though, the food is fine. It's a place where we end up by default, and I enjoy the breakfast dishes, which are served all day. The only problem is that it's a little pricey, and the food is just okay, so it doesn't really justify that extra $2 more than my favorite places. I mean, some of my favorite diners are actually those in the Sunset (Irving Street Cafe, Howard's, etc.) so Sam's kind of pales in comparison. Still, if you're looking for a quick meal before classes, or before/after a musical or opera, hit up Sam's.", "author": "Kristina L."}

I jumped up and the waitress came over and squished it with a napkin but didn't come back to wipe or disinfect the table.  I couldn't eat another bite since I could only wonder whether the roaches roam freely in the kitchen.  Then a deranged woman came in from the street and leaned over our table with her breasts hanging inches from my face as she reached for the ketchup.  I leaned back aghast and finally someone came over and pulled the woman away.  Is this a typical lunchtime experience?  I don't know but we got the full bill of $28 for our lunch and then the owner came and took it away and brought back a revised bill with $2 taken off! This shows no care or respect for the customer experience so I just wanted to share this for others considering Sam's Diner..  We paid the bill and left never to return.", "author": "christine b."}

Twenty five minutes later, the waitress brings us one plate of chicken, mashed potatoes and corn...It's like they thought we would share a plate that none of us ordered.  We explained to the manager what we ordered and how long we have been waiting, and it turns out our waitress messed up and didn't put in our orders. Which would be forgivable,as we all make mistakes and they gave us a slight discount, but for the small matter of the food not being good.

Maybe because it has two doors. Or because looks really small from the outside.\n\nI considered getting a burger from Market Street Grill, but one look at the price made me realize that I should definitely eat elsewhere. I trooped over and decided to feed my burger kick that I've been on lately. It comes with fries, although it has no onions. It's cheaper and the milkshake was less expensive, but less chocolately. \n\nHowever the burger wasn't dry and the veggies were fresh. I had forgotten to ask for onions. The burger was filling though. I didn't care for the cheese, and the fries were okay. The ketchup packets squirted a sort of ketchup juice, which makes me think they were old packets.\n\nFrom what I saw though, the interior was clean and there were definitely people who came in. They didn't have a takeout menu from what I saw, but they're pretty quick when ordering, so I don't think I'll mind walking here to order and wait.\n\nHINT: If you're going to order the special, do it early, ie around 12. I came in at almost 1 a few weeks ago and they told me they were out of the special. I tried again today at 12 and the waitress said that their specials run out by 12:30.\n\nEDIT: Well, I had a bad experience today. I've gone here a few times since I wrote this review--always friendly service with a smile. Today when I ordered takeout, I decided to order a milkshake on a whim. \"Uuuuuh, I don't have ice cream to make a milkshake today.\" Well, uuuuuh, okay. I went to pickup my order and the waitress (my gut tells me she took my order), handed me the order sheet she took it on and continued to do her thing. She also placed my order on the table I decided to sit in without any sort of acknowledgment. I haven't seen her before and noticed it didn't seem like the regular wait staff there. Hopefully it's just a fluke but it put a damper on my excitement for my food.", "author": "AccioSoyMilk .."}

Ordered hash browns & bacon to be well-done crispy, and as I saw - hash browns cook on a limited space & it's probably hard to 'scatter' & cook them all.  But then I saw my bacon pulled from a tray of pre-cooked & onto my plate.  Chef saw my reaction & offered to re-grill but I declined.

I ordered the Korean taco, yes... this American place serves Korean food. After all I believe the owner was Korean. Any who Button ordered the spicy pork sandwich... that was a fail attempt. The meat was tough, and hard to chew... the flavor was lacking. Now, mine in the other hand was yummy. My meat was pretty tender and you get all of the Asian flavor in one taco. My plate came with three good sized tacos. You can taste the ginger from the taco. I can almost compare my dish to a sesame salad. Yup that's what it taste like.

She said that grills had already been shut down and cleaned, so I would not be able to order breakfast.  No problem, I'll order the Chicken Avocado Sandwich with french fries.  One other member of my group ordered Fish and Chips.\n5 minutes later, the waitress comes back and very apologetically informs us that something is wrong with the fryer and the fish came out ok, but the french fries did not and we had some choices for substitutions.  No problem.\nThe food was very greasy, nothing special.  My Chicken Avocado sandwich was pretty good, but too greasy.  I would compare this place to a poor-man's Denny's.

I ordered a bagel and fruit for breakfast... my fiance ordered pancakes, sausage and scrambled eggs.  It took about 10 minutes to get my bagel and fruit - that's fine, it was really busy.  I started nibbling on my fruit, trying to wait for fiance's food... didn't want to be rude and eat without him.  5 minutes passed by, and my bagel started getting cold - so I put a dab of cream cheese on it and started nibbling on that too... 10 minutes went by, and still no sight of the pancakes - good luck trying to get someone's attention to ask them where the H your food is.  Finally what looked like the owner came over to our table and asked us if we were finished.  FINISHED?  UH... yeah, he never got his food (I said pointing to fiance).  So the guy went to check on it - 5 more minutes go by and they bring out some food for him, but instead of sausage they bring him bacon and the waitress has the nerve to tell us - It's been done, we just forgot to bring it to you.  Yeah that was obvious with the freezing cold eggs and bacon.  She dropped the plate and ran off before we had a chance to tell her the order was wrong, so I had to get up from the table to track her down and tell her the order was wrong.  5 minutes later we get the sausage and hot eggs.
