I ordered the Vegetable Tempura Entree ($9.75) that came with miso soup, rice, and salad and Edamame ($1.50). \n\nThe vegetable tempura pieces were somewhat crispy and did not taste too fresh. The pieces made my mouth feel dry. I tried dipping them into the tempura dipping sauce but that didn't seem to help. \n\nThe miso soup did not seem like a miso soup to me. There were hardly any seaweed and tofu. The liquid leaned more toward the plain side.\n\nThe edamame was not seasoned, but it tasted fine. I was glad most of the edamame had a clean shell. When I say clean, I mean it had no suspicious dark patches due to having an expiration date of 3/25/2018. \n\nMy friend had a chicken teriyaki dish that came with cabbage pieces. He thought the cabbage pieces were so bitter that the extra teriyaki sauce could not save them... or him.\n\nI don't plan to come back.

It was a lot of food for around twenty bucks, but while service was really fast - especially given the crowd - they really need a better organizational system here. The poor guy bringing around soup and salad had no idea what anyone ordered and had to ask every table what their orders were so he could know whether or not to give them soup and salad.\n\nThe sushi was actually pretty good, not too fishy, just the right amount of heat, but the gyoza were a bit different. This is the first place I've ever been to that tempuras their gyoza - while not my favorite way of making them, they were at least good and I'd probably order them again. My boyfriend likes the donburi here and though I didn't try it, I can at least say it was a big bowl with a lot of meat.\n\nAgain, it's not the best Japanese restaurant but it's good and you get a lot for your money.

And as a friend mentioned it's awesomeness, I became more frustrated and determined to find this mysterious entrance. After some treasure mapping with Google, I have finally located Tokyo Express. \n\nSo, the food. The food is better than good. Umm... maybe it's from a sense of accomplishment of finding this place. But no, the food is good. So good that Tokyo Express has become my favorite lunch spot in the FiDi. And I even went there for my birthday lunch.  \n\nTheir sushi is okay; afterall, this is a FAST lunch joint. But their winners are the donburi and daily special of soba tempura. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their soba tempura, and it's about the only thing I get their now. Every time I walk in craving sushi, I get swayed over with their soba tempuras. It is that amazing. Their tempura is soft, yet crunchy. Slightly oily and battered with a sweet salt. It has the perfect texture upon dipping it in the sauce. I get this delicious goodness even though it leaves me in a carb comma afterwards. Yum.", "author": "Mabel Y."}

There were 3 of us and our food was brought out very randomly.  \n\nI ordered a samurai & spider roll and miso soup. Friends ordered a chicken entr\u00e9e and a #4 special, which included spicy tuna roll.\n\n\nOrdering was fine, then we waited...  1st, my friend's spicy tuna roll that came in a #4 special.  The guy who brought it out didn't seem to speak much English and asked my friend at least 4 times what she ordered, despite answering each time. Several minutes later, came a side salad, but it was given to the wrong person, no biggie.  Several minutes later, the chicken entr\u00e9e.  Looked a bit dry, but the gal that ordered it drowned it siracha sauce, so no complaints from her.  Several minutes later, I get roll #1, not one that I ordered.   Instead of the $9 spider roll, I got a $5 Crunch California roll and the tempura in it, was burnt to a crisp.  I can believe they would serve it like that. Several minutes later, the samurai roll and finally several minutes after that, my miso soup.  About 2/3 the way through lunch a gal came by with 2 miso soups and 2 salads, neither of which were part of our order, but the lack of English skills on the servers part, we thought it best not to add to any confusion, since they seemed completely lost.  \n\nAll in all, very mediocre food.  The dressing on the salad was awful, the miso was not very good and was not that hot. Definitely won't be going back there again.", "author": "Joanna D."}

Most of them are either a far trek away from my office or just a little too darn pricey for my lunch pocket. Nestled, well actually \"hidden\", between two buildings to be exact... and you enter Tokyo Express. Despite it's camouflaged location, this Japanese joint gets lots of business from the area. Come 12pm and this spot has a line forming out the door. SO, w/ my hungry stomach & noticing their long lines (from passing through on other days) I decide to take my gal pal there a little early one Monday to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nYou walk inside and notice that the restaurant is actually pretty cute. OK so maybe looks aren't everything (besides it's only lunch on your work hour), but it IS cute none-the-less, clean, and presentable.  They have lots of pretty pink flowers inside and is cutely decorated w/ those Japanese silhouette coverings of some Oriental sort.\n\nThe food is really good. The Udon noodle soups are big and plentiful; comes with an assortment of crunchy Tempura shrimp and veggies.  They have the standard Bento box specials w/ your choice of beef, chicken, or salmon teriyaki and Tempura. Again, they serve generous portions.  Often times they change up their daily specials to have Miso soup and Salad go w/ their sushi rolls.  I usually opt for their Rainbow Roll, Dragon Roll, or today I had the Heavenly Roll which is Salmon w/ scallions and topped w/ Spicy Tuna.  It's fresh and yummy to my tummy; served w/ an additional 6 pieces of California Roll.  Delish! \n\nTIP: Really bad, but right next door is Specialty's.

I was reading reviews about this place while eating, probably wasn't a great idea.\n\nI remember seeing this place two weeks ago while walking to the Rincon Center from my office and was like WOW this place must be amazing, it's packed! Then today when I didn't bring lunch again, I decided to stop here, (without checking yelp first, shame on me).\n\nI was going to order Chicken Katsu Bento box at first but changed to Salmon Teriyaki (7.59 cu zit was a special, 7.99 normall) just cuz my throat isn't feeling very well so didn't want to make it worse.  The Salmon Teriyaki was the special of the day, it was 1 dollar more to add tempura, 2 dollars more for california rolls, and 3 dollars more for spicy tuna.'\n\nI got here right at 12 and there was only one person in front of waiting with two cashiers.  From the moment i ordered my food til i got my food was about 2-3 minutes, SUPER fast service, but I guess it's cuz they were preparing for the rush.\n\nI ordered to go, went back to my office and unpacked.  For the bento box, I had 3 pieces of salmon over cabbage, a scoop of rice, some salad, a cup of miso soup, and 6 pieces of sushi in a separate box.  The rice was okay, typical rice, not great not bad, the salmon was a BIT dry but not looking for 5 star quality from a to-go restaurant.  The soup was... interesting, i didn't really like it.  The teriyaki sauce on top of the salmon was good tho.  The sushi was mehh, they were really small, didn't have much of the \"meat\" in them and the avocado didn't look fresh at all.\n\nThe food was 'ite.  I wouldn't go again cuz I think Sorabol is a bit better in the quality and quaniity for roughly the same price for the same kind of food.\n\nOverall the place deserves a 2.5 stars, I gave it 2 cuz I'm a tougher cookie to break.  But I do have to say that most reviewers are comparing this place to an authentic Japanese restaurant they have been to somewhere else somewhere else, which is stupid cuz this place caters to a completely different audience.  This place is located in Financial District, the food here, is about the same price as all the other \"food court\" food around the area.  How can you expect authenticity from a to-go place the word express in the name of the restaurant?  It's like going to Panda Express (note also has express in it) and complaining the food doesn't taste like the food they ate in Hong Kong.\n\nThis place serves it's purpose, fake Japanese food for people that have short lunches and can't go very far for better food.  All the restaurants around the location are made for the people in the office buildings surrounding it, they have to get the food out as quickly as possible cuz people just don't have time to wait.  So don't come here expecting some Benihana-like cooking performances and service, cuz that's not the purpose of this place.  If you're not from the area, I'm not sure why you would come here for the food, so don't.", "author": "Willis C."}

For example, all the teriyaki  bento boxes I've ever ordered were dripped with oil. The sushi is ... again, fine, though it takes a bit longer to. \n\nThe whole place works like a fast-food place, as evidenced by the variety of apps tools they use for customers to place orders and pay.

It's run by bunch of punks who are not even Japanese!\n\nI came here with a friend for lunch today. I placed my order, and so did my friend. My friend thought I place a tempura soba, and informed the cashier that she would like to have the same order as mine. When the cashier repeated the order, I realized it was wrong and requested her to correct one order. Same price, just different order. She \"indirectly\" insisted that we kept our order but I requested to help change it. She rolled her eyes, stomped into the kitchen, and orders were placed. \n\nI wasn't too happy with her whole attitude and mentioned to my friend that we should talk to the manager. Okay, we found our seat and waited for our food to come. When the waiter gave us our salad, I asked who the manager is, NOT \"I want to speak with the manager\". He told us who the manager is and left. I didn't complain or say anything else. Our food arrived and we were enjoying our food. Next thing we knew, a manager came out and asked why we wanted to speak with him. I told him that I didn't ask to speak with him, i just asked the waiter who the manager is. Since he was there, I told him about the little incident.\n\nHe then literally yelled at me and my friend that it was our fault for placing the wrong orders and he saw the whole thing. He added that they had to throw away the order that the cook just made because of our mistake. I then said you could have told me that instead of yelling and giving attitude, and we would have kept the order. No yelling or attitude necessary. He looked like he was about to eat us. A Young punk with doo doo hair color is a manager??? \n\nThen, the cashier came to ask me if I complained about her, and I told her about the whole story - basically, I only asked who the manager is but her co-worker went in to tell the manager that I wanted to speak with him. She explained about how the kitchen staff was upset when order was wrong. I kindly explained to her that she could have told us upfront instead of huffing and puffing, we would have totally understood. I advised her to not do the same thing to other customers. A simple explanation will take care of issues. \n\nI admitted that it was our fault for placing the order wrong. However, the way the manager handled the issue was completely wrong. You don't yell at customers, you could have just explained it. We, the customers, don't know how your system and kitchen work, idiot!!!\n\nThe cashier handed me the phone number of the owner (David). If the attitude of the manager is like that, I am almost sure there is no point of calling the owner. \n\nI will never go back to this place!

You can do A LOT worse in the FiDi for lunch unfortunately...\n\nSalad: I hate salads that use large chunks of iceberg lettuce (the Tito of the lettuce family) and pale tomatoes.  The creamy dressing with orange colored shavings of something was nice, but disappeared after I ate the one cucumber slice on top.\n\nGyoza: Potsticker style, no.  Deep fried with a light tempura, yes.  Never had a dumpling in tempura before so appreciated the new experience.  Learned that I prefer traditional potsticker-style though.\n\nNabe-Yaki Udon: Basically an everything udon.  The broth is savory and salty with a hint of seaweed.  The noodles are decent, though a tad too soft.  Fish cake, plain tofu, shrimp and spinach taste like you'd expect.  The deep fried tofu skin is a nice touch since it absorbs a ton of broth.  The teriyaki chicken had a good texture and light flavoring, could use some more teriyaki marinade.  There was imitation crab (a la California roll) that got stringy and slimy for a very unpleasant texture experience.

Lunch here runs roughly 9-12 bucks which isn't too bad at all for all the food you get. I rolls aren't impressive but they aren't shabby.

I think its justified after a month of eating here that I finally complete my review of this lunch place.  I am glad I didn't check Yelp before going otherwise it might have turned me away from this hidden gem.  I have ordered the chicken donburi, salmon teriyaki bento with tempura and beef teriyaki.  While all are solid, I have to say the beef teriyaki was slightly on the dry side.  Please note I have not tried any of the rolls or sashimi.\n\nSalmon teriyaki bento is my favorite so far.  I must say, this place does not make it dry but the teriyaki glaze may be slightly excessive.  However, the taste is solid as is the rice.  Comes with the salad and miso soup, both which are really typical.  For an extra $1.50 you get shrimp and veggie tempura.  Sometimes the tempura comes out slightly cool and not piping hot, but needless to say, still tastes fresh.\n\nI have no complaints about the lines or lunch crowds, maybe because I come here before the noon peaktime and long lines out the door.  I like that this place has self serve tea, means you don't end up waiting around for a busboy to come assist.  \n\nClean cute establishment.  I will be back again and again to get my bento, I am sure. Maybe someday I will venture over to their rolls.

I think it helps that this place gets so busy that they go through a lot of fish each day.  As a result, the fish is generally fresh.  Second, the portions are also a decent size, but then again, I eat a lot so the portion size might be a lot to some.  Third, the prices are decent given that this is sushi in the financial district.  I don't know if there is really any other place you can go to.  \n\nAs for the negatives, my only complaints are that it gets really busy during lunch time and it's weird eating sushi fast food service style.  If you go, make sure you get there early so that you don't spend most of your lunch break in line.  It's also odd that you wait in a line to order, like McDonald's, and then go wait at a table for your food to be brought out to you.

It's busy busy busy, meaning you have to wait on line to recieve your punishment.  I use that line as a retort when people mention \"common sense\" or \"human dignity\" - \"oh really?  Explain the Tokyo Express lunch line then!?\" is my response, always followed by silence heralding my decisive victory.\n\n2. The \"sushi\" is grade-Z.  The fish smells, it's clearly been frozen and defrosted (multiple times!?) and has the color of the ancient wax sushi's you find in musty cases outside sushi restaurants.  NOTHING is good!  Not the tuna (how do you mess THAT up?), not the salmon, not the ebi, and don't even bother with anything more fancy like hamachi.  Not unless you're there to commit suicide.\n\n3. The bento boxes / teriyaki / donburi are criminal.  I'm not kidding.  The vegetables are under or overcooked (depending on the position of the stars), the meat is high-school cafeteria grade, and none of it will be the right temperature.  Even the boxes they come in are sticky - do they wash them or just rinse them out?\n\n4. The \"service\" is non-existant.  It's your standard wage-slave feeding trough - grab a number, wait for the shambler to plop your \"food\" on the table and good luck to you, brave (foolish) diner!\n\nThere is a ray of hope, however!  If you don't go here, but to the sister restaurant north of market (waaay north, near the Transamerica building) you'll find a significantly different experience.  It's like the good twin to this evil twin.  I'd give THAT Tokyo Express three stars because it's actually quite good for what you pay (and can get in this area) - hell, I eat the sushi there without grimacing, and their bento boxes are what you'd expect from a decent place.", "author": "Matt H."}

The fish here is super fresh.. and I LOVE SUSHI and need fresh fish so I think I'm pretty good at picking out the good places.. I try to visit this place once a week.. Getting there before noon is key or you'll wait in a long line.. again if this place wasn't good there wouldn't be a long line everyday.. the line goes pretty quick so don't fret.", "author": "Monica S."}

The lines are out-the-door because there aren't any other cheap/quick Japanese places in the area that are any better.  The salmon teriyaki is good but you don't get much of it.  You get 3 razor thin slices of salmon with a ton of rice, half a cup of miso soup, and some iceberg lettuce with an extremely distasteful ginger-soy dressing.  I end up getting a california roll because an order of salmon teriyaki alone won't fill me up.  I have tried a couple of their rolls and I don't like them.  Their eel seemed kinda...over-cooked and rubbery?  I think the Stonestown location is a half-step up though.  They give you slightly more salmon teriyaki plus you get one or two orange slices, and their salad dressing is much better.  I know, not that big of a deal, but like I said it's a half-step up.", "author": "Kandi K."}

Tried the chicken - gristly. Won't eat anything raw in here (I inspected the sushi prep area). Am always suspicious when friends tell me their sushi is warm...", "author": "Mi M."}

Not a place I would venture to actually get sushi, but their simple teriyaki dishes are great.  Most food per dollar you can get in the financial district (except maybe hot dogs).", "author": "M P."}

The sushi specials are a deal as well.  it is not the best sushi in town. But for a quick and fast bite. This place can do it.   The udon soups are pretty decent as well.", "author": "Chris C."}

I went there around 2PM today which I thought it was after the mad lunch hour rush but I had to wait about 30 minutes for my Spider Roll Lunch special of the day to be made...don't they anticipate that customers might tend to order the lunch specials and be ready to make it???   Meanwhile half the dining room was closed off and empty!  It looks like the lady waiting behind me for her order got her money back and had a free lunch on the manager.  But I wasn't so lucky...eventhough I considered (past-tense) myself a regular customer...it will be awhile till I come back to order lunch again.  Maybe they will improve the process by then or maybe not.  Alakazam!", "author": "Ed Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-06-27", "description": "I agree with all the other reviewers. At this point, it's hard to add anything new. This place sucks. No reason to go there. I ordered the Deluxe Bento. The service was ridiculous. A scowling mean woman behind the cash register turned away from me as soon as I approached and I had to wait for her to turn back around and acknowledge me, then she screamed at me when I asked her what the difference was between a deluxe bento and a regular bento. I barely understood her hysterical response but ordered it anyway, what a mistake. The tempura was hard and cold and just plan disgusting. The white rice was hard and dry and crusty. The fish was so bad it does not qualify as seafood. If it was really fish, it must have been a quality level several notches below the lowest possible quality level. The samlon teriyaki was hard and the slices were almost as thin as paper. In fact, there was more of the sugary fake teriyaki sauce than there was actual salmon and the cabbage was inedible because of all the sauce. The tea was cold and tasteless. The miso soup tasted like some kind of military ration out of a can and had only smallest bits of tofu and a scap of old seaweed. Each table has a sign thanking in advance for our generous tips. Why would anyone in their right mind leave a generous tip for this?", "author": "Eater S."}
