I brought a friend here to celebrate her engagement and we absolutely loved it. \n\nMy friend really wanted to try some paella and also wanted ceviche so I thought we'd give this place a try. We ordered the arroz con mariscos which is basically Peruvian take on paella and it was VERY good!! I have had great paella in Spain which set the bar pretty high and this place was definitely up there in terms of quality and flavor.\n\nWe also ordered the ceviche (honestly I can't remember which one!) and it came with taro chips (!!!) instead of corn tortilla chips. The chips were so good we ended up ordering extra. \n\nExcellent service! Our server, Jorge, was very attentive and accomodating. When the paella came out, it had a cheese garnish on top and when I told him I couldn't eat dairy he took the plate back and brought us a new one without the garnish. Very much appreciated! \n\nThey were very busy so I definitely recommend making a reservation. We were able to make a reservation the day before for Saturday evening so seems they have availability if you plan ahead.", "author": "Eva R."}

It took nearly 30 minutes for someone to come take our drink order, which I found absurd. Then we ordered a bottle of wine thinking that'd be the faster way to get some drinks. After 15 minutes, we ended up fetching another server to see if he'd help.\n\nAfter that, the service was fine. We sat downstairs, which was so loud that we felt like we were screaming over each other. The second time I came, the noise level was still the same, but the service was great.\n\nFood is always pretty solid. I love the chicken, yuca fries, the paella. Empanadas are okay and I would get them again but they're not a must in my opinion. I personally didn't love the ceviche, but the rest of my party did.\n\nParking is tough here.

With both parties, we ate off of a prefix menu, which was fine since it was a selection of some of their popular dishes which included their empanadas, ceviche, lomo saltado, and their famous pollo a la brasa.  It was a lot of food to pass around and both times there was an overabundance of main dishes leftover.\n\nI'll admit this, the first time I tried their chicken, I thought it was a little too salty.  However the second time around, it was much better with the salt and spices being more evenly distributed.  And all their other dishes were pretty good.  I'm always a sucker for lomo saltado because who doesn't like fries and steak mixed together and their ceviche was delicious.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Limon.  Both times have been great hosting the large parties I dined with and I will more than likely return in the future to try more things off their menu.", "author": "Rodney H."}

But this is made even better by the fact that it's not super expensive - 8 of us had a meal and 1-3 drinks each for $50 each somehow (tip included). My favorite part about it is that if you're trying to eat low carb it is perfect. \n\nAll we get there is the chicken and Ceviche (Mixto) both of which are amazing. The chicken is so simple yet tasty but I would get at least a whole chicken for 2 people. It's not as much as it looks on paper so you will want it. The green beans are really really good so maybe order more than one as is the salad. I don't mess with the starchy stuff but my dinner partners said they were all good. If you're like me, stick to the veggies and meats and you'll have a great time and leave feeling stuffed. What more can you ask for.\n\nThe drinks are also good and they have a full bar. On the wine menu I loved the Albari\u00f1o, which was not at all sweet - quite dry, light, and refreshing.

The meat was juicy and flavorful (though it was not consistent/depends on which piece/cut)\nCeviche Trio: Each one had the same base of juices but varied in meat (fish vs. shrimp) and spicy levels. I wish it was served with bread/chips or some type of carb because it can get sour really quickly without something to absorb the acidicness.\nSeco de Costillas (braised boneless beef short ribs): This seemed like it was more of an individual dish as opposed to family style but regardless, the beef was so juicy, flavorful and at a good state of \"falling apart\". The beef come in a few cubes soaked in its own juice from the braising along with a bed of rice. Go ahead and scoop a bite of beef and rice dipped in juice/sauce. \nSweet Potato Fries: nothing crazy, good standard sweet potato fries\nYuca Fries: I love the texture, which I can only describe as a mix between Taro and Potato. \n\n~Price/Quality/Quantity~  \nPrice per dish was on the slightly higher side, which is fair for family style. The only thing is that some dishes, such as the braised beef, was clearly not meant to be family style while the paella definitely is. I wish there was some consistency or indicator. We had to just rely on fellow yelp pictures. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nI made a reservation the day before for 7 people on a Friday night and it surprisingly worked out without any snags. We got seated in the basement right by the stairs and it was pretty cramped space and could be an issue if it's really busy. If I reserve again, I'd def take that into account. Our waiter was trying his best dealing with peak hour but they seem to have forgotten about one of our dishes (braised beef) to the point that the busser tried to clear our table while we were still waiting for the dish.

As for the food, we decided to share the Seco De Costillos / Braised Boneless Beef Short Ribs ($20.95) and Half Chicken ($18.95) with Chifa Green Beans and Papas Fritas. Our short ribs arrived first and smelled absolutely amazing! It came in three chunks of meat, which just fell off the bone into the marinated juices. The broth poured over the jasmine rice gave such good flavor and was an overall solid dish.\n\nIf you come to Limon Rotisserie, you just can't go without ordering their famous open flame marinated rotisserie chicken! The half portion was perfect for us two, but I probably would've loved to take the whole chicken home with me. The marinade on the chicken was such a good mixture of spices with the thick pieces of chicken. The aji amorillo huacatay sauce was perfect for dipping the chicken and even the green beans and fries that I had as my sides.

Service was friendly, and food came out fast.\n\nThere were so many great options on the menu, from poultry to seafood. I'll definitely have to come back to try the chicken, since it's the ceviche that really caught my eye. I couldn't decide between all the choices, so I went with the ceviche trio. It's like they invented this dish for indecisive people like me!\n\nI was impressed with the amount of food this was. Huge bowls of fresh ceviche, a mix of shrimp, octopus, and snapper. What I didn't expect was how spicy some of them would be. Holy crap! I had horrible allergies that day, so I was just a mess. So good, though. I'd recommend the ceviche trio, but beware if you're sensitive to heat.\n\nLooking back, I'd recommend sharing food (especially ceviche) family style so you can try a bit of everything. For me, it was too much seafood in one sitting, so I took the rest home for dinner. Oh and I forgot we started with the yuca frites.

Their aji sauce is amazing but of course their chicken steals the show! Juicy, tender, flavorful, \"falls off the bone\"... and the skin, omg, the skin is the best part! My bf thought the chicken was rather salty but I beg to differ. The chicken was definitely my favorite dish of the night. We ordered half chicken (comes with 4 pieces) and picked two sides: yucca fries and tacu tacu. Yucca fries were delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the tacu tacu--took three bites and was done with that. Flavors were nice but I think it was too salty and heavy for me. \n\nWe also ordered the ceviche trio which came with three yummy ceviches. One was just shrimp, one had shrimp and octopus, and the last one had fish. All really zesty and jam packed with flavor and citrus/spice notes. The shrimp and octopus one had more sourness to it than the others. That was probably my favorite. We also ordered taro chips ($3) to go with the ceviche, recommended by our server. \n\nI made a reservation a couple of days ago through OpenTable for Saturday date night. Thanks to the other Yelpers' recommendations, making a reservation was a smart move. No lie there will be a crowd outside on a weekend night and if you don't have reservations I have no idea how long your wait will be. It didn't seem too bad but the place is small, so if you can, PLAN AHEAD! Parking can be a pain too, but after circling twice, we got lucky and found a spot 5 blocks away (good for digestion, right?)\n\nAnyway I was quite impressed with the food and also loved the atmosphere. Trendy, loud, fun vibes all around. Can be hard to hear your date talk, but it definitely feels intimate, vibrant, and cozy! Downside is that the main floor can be crowded and small. Literally bumped elbows with the other group next to me. Lol. \n\nService is good. Servers were attentive and refilled water every now and then. They did forget our order of truffle mac and cheese but we were so full anyway that we decided to cancel our order. They were flexible and took that off, which was reflected on our bill.

It was kind of an annoyance to maneuver around the people coming in and out.  Thankfully, they have a separate dining area downstairs.  My friends highly recommended the rotisserie chicken here.  And I repeat in their own words, the chicken is \"life changing.\"  So I had pretty high expectations. \n\nI ordered the half chicken with two sides of the string beans.  The chicken wasn't dry but nice and juicy. However, the yellow dipping sauce is what you really crave about ! I'm not sure what it is but it was to die for.  We also ordered a pitcher of margaritas to share and it packed a nice punch.  \n\nThe service was mediocre. Our server pretty much just came by to take our order, bring our food/drinks, and give us our check.  The service and ambience was lacking but the food made up for it.", "author": "Derek L."}

I went here for dinner and maybe we ended up ordering the wrong thing, but the portions were so, so tiny!!! I left the restaurant feeling so hungry afterwards because you have to order a bunch of expensive dishes to feel satisfied. Only go here if you're down for good Peruvian food, but want to drop a lot of money or not feeling super hungry. I honestly would only come here again and get the empanadas, because I felt those were fairly priced and good. \n\nFood: I ordered the chicken empanadas which were super tasty! It sucks that you can only choose one kind of empanada when you get two of them though. My boyfriend also ordered the octopus dish which was super tasty, but again it was $17 and such a small portion!!!! \n\nAmbiance and Service: The service was great! The guy we had serving us was super nice and always made sure our glasses were filled with water. The ambiance is super cozy and I really liked the layout of the restaurant.", "author": "Rithika V."}

We were all dumbfounded that this man, with a man bun was trying to act tough with us so we weren't sure if he was joking. He kind of looked like Russ the rapper that's mad he works at a restaurant. Anyways I hope he gets a hair net for that thing I would hate to find a hair in my food. He tried to tell us his uncle was Randy savage and with his intimidating eye brow piercing I had to take his word for it. I think he was an extra in willie wonka and that's why we thought we recognized him. He was just not very nice and looked like he had just took a swim in the grease trap in their kitchen.

The drinks were refreshing, i was able to get a table right away and my waitress was very genuine. I ordered the ceviche mixed and it was was better than any mexican ceviche I'd ever had, from anywhere. I was unsure of what to expect because I've only had peruvian food made at my friends house ive never gone out and had it. I was in for a real treat. Their flavoring game was spot on i made sure to send the plates back cleaned, with nothing going to waste. I was also sharing the steak with fries i forgot what that was called but it was muy delicioso. I decided to order a drink called la bomba, it was so good.... prickly pear with notes of passion fruit served in this cute little glass. I wanted to order another kind of drink since this one was so bomb haha get it La Bomba...but was pressed for time. Great music, great atmosphere, nice setting ..the brick wall gives it a warm homey kind of feeling. I heard there's a downstairs as well. Diverse group of people ranging from stroller age to old coots were all there. Keep putting out that authentic cuisine!!

The lady and I were looking for something a little different and I saw this place on Yelp. Given the high reviews and the fact that we had been talking about finding Peruvian place, I suggested we try it. Suucess.\n\nAll the comments about this place being packed was true; there wasn't an open table until well after 10:00 pm (we got there at 7:30). Reservations were highly recommended and the good news was that I could do it directly from the Yelp app. Nice. No problems with that, BTW.\n\nStarting with the drinks we both tried the Pisco Sours. I had the lychee and my date had the regular. Very nice. Good pour on the alcohol. We both didn't know what a Pisco was, but I'd definitley order it again--even at $12 each.\n\nMoving on to the food, it was fantastic. I had the rotisserie chicken with sauteed green beans, sauteed rice & refried beans. Holy smokes was it good! The chicken was so flavorful and tender, I realized I should have gotten the whole chicken instead of the half (I'm a big eater). The lady had boneless beef shortribs and this was also excellent. We shared everything. Again, the food was sublime.\n\nThe dining room was quite lively and I noticed there more than a few folks who looked like they were out on dates. Our server was attentive as he could be on what was a very busy night. We had no issues with that. \n\nI'm echoing the comments of many of the other Yelpers this this is definitely 4 stars, solidly.

It's enjoyable and I can be here all afternoon.\n\nWe ordered most, if not all, their signature dishes, such as the ceviche, rotisserie chicken, beef empanadas, and lomo saltado. From the zest of the ceviche, spice of the tender chicken, sauce from the lomo saltado and pastry delight of the empanadas, everything filled each of the tasty taste buds!  I asked for picante salsa and I guess it's not typical.  They charged us for it, but it was worth it.

I ordered the Pisco sour, there were three varieties and I ordered the original while two of my friends ordered the other two options. They were strong yet very flavorful, a delicious cocktail in my opinion!\n\nAll of the food was very good and I recommend everything that I just listed. My one small complaint is that we ate in the downstairs basement area which they have converted into a restaurant. While I love the ambience and the decor, finding it very romantic, there is not much insulation so it is very noisy because every little sound bounces off the walls.

The \"Pollo a la Brasa\" is so moist and flavorful. Wish I would have grabbed more. Without shame, I went back for seconds of the Truffle Mac & Cheese. I LOVE mac & cheese, and Limon did not dissapoint. I *think* the salad was the Ensalada Mixta. Whatever it was, the aji amarillo dressing was delish. It actually reminded me a lot of the dressing at my favorite sushi spot in Concord. The chifa Green Beans had an interesting taste, with just a kick at the end. The white rice and black beans were pretty standard. I grabbed a veggie empanada, but honestly was too full from my chicken and mac & cheese to give it a try.

The tartara de tuna was pretty good for a small dish. The chips were interesting - it tasted like thin cut potatoes. The truffle mac and cheese wasn't really creamy at all that my brother couldn't finish it. :/ if they put more cheese into the dish, I think it would have tasted better.\n\nI ordered the polli papas -- it had grilled chicken pieces with french fries, mustard aioli, and parmesan cheese on top! It literally smelled like the garlic parmesan wings from wingstop! My grilled chicken was really dry that I wish I asked for more of the mustard aioli to mix it in. \n\nMy sister got the carne a la parilla dish! It's a very hearty meal so I'd recommend this if you're hungry. The sauce was pretty salty that we had to scrape most of the sauce off. My sister couldn't finish it because of that. But the mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables were good! \n\nMy sister's boyfriend got half a chicken with potatoes and a salad on the side. The chicken was very tender yet pretty salty.

(And I have no idea what truffle mac n cheese is doing on a Latin American menu.)\n\n(+) Lomo saltado ($18.95, traditional Peruvian beef tenderloin stir fry with onions, tomatoes, fries, soy sauce, rice): Quite good, with strips of tender strips of beef accompanied by soy sauce and pepper, which almost reminds me of Chinese stir-fry dishes. I always have a problem with the fries getting soggy in lomo saltado, and I have yet to find a place that resolves this. Overall, Limon's lomo saltado is above average, though also with above average prices and a below average portion size.\n\n(++) El pollo a la brasa ($17.95 for half, marinated free-range rotisserie chicken slowly roasted over open flame with aji sauces and 2 sides; chose yuca fries and tacu tacu): Mmm, as a place named rotisserie, they have surely refined their rotisserie chicken. The chicken is delicious and juicy, permeated with light lime and soy, with a roasty and well-seasoned exterior. It brought back fond memories of how excited I was as a kid to have Boston Market rotisserie chicken (except tastier, of course). The trio of sauces allowed you to mix and match your own flavors so that each piece stays interesting. The yuca fries were satisfying with a crispy coating but soft interior, and the tacu tacu (rice and beans) is a simple dish that fills you up. I think this is one of the dishes with better value, since it comes with sides. \n\nI enjoyed my dinner at Limon, but expect at least $20 per person and don't be too hungry. Oh and you can get excited about the food porn; the tapas size plates and careful preparation make for good Instagrams.\n\n(Fun fact: My favorite Peruvian restaurant of all time is Lima Limon at Santa Clarita--would recommend for anyone making the drive to Socal!)", "author": "Edna C."}

A plus for presentation and minus for functionality, I enjoyed their plates as they were pretty unique in style. However, their utensils were unbalance and annoying to use. ( I know its weird to comment on this but you might care about this). \n\nTheir ceviche had too much lemon for my taste. Though I imagine if you enjoy lemon it's probably okay. The yuca fries were pretty legit. I also enjoyed the ice tea they had. Once again their strongest dish in the menu is the rotisserie chicken. \n\nOne last thing, unfortunately their service was not very good. Don't get me wrong when they were around they were polite and helpful. But sadly, they weren't around often. Either they were understaffed or didn't care. Either way it's not cool.

It turns out that since your expectations are so very low, you've picked exactly the right spot to hang out.\n\n******************************\n\nLim\u00f3n Rotisserie serves comfort food, the sorts of dishes you'd find at your Peruvian aunt's house, but on a weekday evening, not at holiday time, y'know? Here are some notes:\n\nTACU TACU\n\nLim\u00f3n's take on Peruvian refried beans and rice costs nearly $5 and would be expensive at half that price. I'm glad I tried this dish; I'm thus enabled to use the word \"unctuous\" properly, to wit: \"Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie's Tacu Tacu is an unctuous and dense grease/carbo-combo, more appropriately referred to as 'Peruvian spackle'.\"\n\nLOMO SALTADO\n\nLomo Saltado is one of those \"national\" dishes you hear about, like feijoada, pad thai and hamburgers. This Peruvian favorite is a \"Chifa\" or Chinese-Peruvian stir-fry of beef, French-fried potatoes, tomatoes, onion, soy sauce, cilantro and chili, served with rice. It's good. It's not complex or special. It's cab driver food.\n\nThe dish being simple to make, Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie relies on quality ingredients to differentiate their Lomo Saltado in the Bay Area, where a thousand restaurants call \"stir-fry\" a starting point. Lim\u00f3n's version is often overwhelmed by soy sauce but is otherwise clean-tasting, and one might enjoy a larger portion, provided enough rice were offered to mitigate the saltiness. Oh, and provided those \"seconds\" were included in the $19 price tag.\n\nTRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE \n\nFrom the menu: \"Limon's signature creamy truffle infused macaroni & cheese.\"\n\nI have so many questions...\n\nHow is it that the Castillo brothers (Lim\u00f3n's owners) charge $9.95 for macaroni and cheese? and how does one not hear them laughing from the kitchen, all night long?\n\nand:\n\nGiven that Truffle Mac & Cheese is in no way Peruvian food, but is, instead, a very silly, trendy combination of cheap and sham ingredients intended to rake in the dough, why don't the bros add Brussels sprouts, beets and kale to the menu and call the place, \"LuluLim\u00f3n\"?\n\nEL POLLO A LA BRASA\n\nWant to see a magic trick? Watch as Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie turns a $5 rotisserie chicken into an $18 one, right before your eyes. \n\nOK, fine. It's not magic. But there's an \"invisible hand\" at work that keeps people from buying better-tasting, substantially less-expensive chicken from Costco, just a mile away, so it's still spooky.\n\nI grant that warehouse takeout is less fun than caf\u00e9 dining, but these things also matter: one can hit up Costco three and a half times per Lim\u00f3n chicken; and, more importantly: if you skip Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie, no one there will notice that you're gone.", "author": "Omar S."}

Parking sucks around this area...it took us forever to find a spot and they only seat you when your entire party is there.\n\nWe got seated downstairs and it's SUPER noisy, like you have to be screaming to talk, totally different from the upstairs and a lot darker too.\n\n-Arroz con Mariscos (aka Paella): worst paella I ever had...the taste was totally off from any I've had before. I've had ones where it comes out soupy but this one had cheese in it, which totally throws off the taste. There's a good amount of seafood, but furthest thing from an actual paella dish. \n\n-Seco de Costillas: this was pretty good except it would've been better if they used lamb, and they skimped out on the sauce. My mom makes this at home, so it could definitely be more flavorful, but this is a pretty rare find. \n\n-Half Chicken w/ Yuca Fries and Camote Frito (sweet potato fries): the chicken was very flavorful! The skin by itself is super salty so be careful. They messed up and gave us the green beans instead of the yuca fries, but both were pretty good. Yuca fries were fried very well, a lot better than the ones I had at Mochica. Sweet potato fries weren't anything special. I think they also gave us two of the same sauce when we wanted the chimichurri sauce and the rocoto molido (hot) sauce instead...and they ended up charging us for that...\n\nI would come back to try the ceviche and the grilled octopus and the beef tongue, but none of the dishes stood out to me otherwise.

The pisco sour is not for the faint of heart or lightweight - it's quite sour (which I love) and it can pack a punch. My mom had a few sips and was already feeling it hahaha. When you first look at the menu, it can seem overwhelming initially because the items and descriptions have a lot of foreign words. But have no fear!

I just can't stop raving and thinking about what I ate last weekend.\n\nOverall, I recommend ordering everything on the menu except for the pitcher of Sangria.

We came around 12:30PM on a Saturday with a group of 4 and were immediately seated. \n\n| FOOD | \n\n- Sangria ($35 for a pitcher) - GET THIS. The sangria is delicious and like all good sangria tastes like juice so it's also something you need to be careful about. haha\n\n- Half Chicken  - Nice crispy skin & juicy meat inside. They cut the half chicken into 4 large pieces so you don't have to worry about how to split it if you're sharing with a group. The chicken had nice spices and flavoring and paired well with the sides.\n\n- Tacu Tacu (sauteed rice & beans) - I really enjoyed this. For this side I thought that they would have the rice & beans separate but they actually mix it together. The contrast in textures makes for a great pairing with the chicken. \n\n- Green Beans - If you want to add veggies to your meal I would get these. The green beans are coated in a nice sauce and have a great crunch. \n\n- Ceviche Mixto - OK. It's not the usual ceviche I'm used to. The pieces are cut super big so it was hard to split with our group and it's already a small dish so there were less bites. They also DON'T pair it with yuca chips which was weird since all ceviches I have ordered at other places come with some sort of chip to scoop it up with. \n\n- Lengua a la parilla (beef tongue w/ mashed potatoes) - The tongue wasn't as tender as I was expecting. Since it's grilled it actually has a tougher and chewy consistency. When cutting it it felt like I was cutting a steak. It was OK. The mashed potatoes they pair it with are tasty though! The potatoes are creamy and not dry. The tongue and and potatoes go well together. \n\n- Championes (mushrooms) - Can never go wrong with mushrooms. They had a nice sauce and went well with our meal but they weren't the most flavorful.\n\n| SERVICE |\n\nOur waiter was accommodating when we asked one of the dishes to be split in two due to an allergy and they were more than willing too. They constantly came around to make sure our waters were full and plates cleaned up. I would have liked if they didn't come around as often to pick up the plates though since we took a break for a while and felt rushed to eat what was left on the place so they could clean it up.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

Man, what am I even gonna do with all these expectations I can't hold them all! So beyond hyped, but it's all for good reason as they put out such a damn good product.\n\nYou can order whole chickens here, which is actually what I'd recommend to share. So juicy and flavorful. My group also ended up ordering the lengua and even though it felt like I had a second tongue in my mouth, it was delicious as well. \n\nDrinks were solid even though we only had the sangria. It went down super easily, but be careful as it's one of those drinks that's so smooth it'll catch up to you if you don't moderate. \n\nReally the only thing I didn't like about the place is how it smelled. It felt like I walked into an armpit upon first entry, but that went away after I got used to it. Other than that it was a pretty darn good place to have a bite to eat. Definitely a nice option to have if you're in the Mission and don't care for one of the hole in the wall places.", "author": "Sean H."}

If you're looking for succulent, mouth-watering rotisserie chicken then you most certainly in the right place. \n\nBeing not too far from my home, Lim\u00f3n has been on my bookmark list for a while (check!). The Frenchman made a same-day reservation via Open Table, for a 9pm reservation. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with smiles then immediately seated. The restaurant isn't very large in front, but it must be massive in the back. At least 2 parties of 10 walked from behind those walls to exit the front door throughout the evening. From what I could tell, it appears to be a good spot for a large dinner party. Make your reservation in advance. \n\n* Sangria \nOn the sweeter end, but full bodied with plenty of cut fruit. \n\n* Ceviche de Camarones\nFresh, fresh, fresh with a splash of lime! These shrimp had a snappy textured when you bite into them. \n\n* Half Chicken + Vegetales Salteados+ Tacu Tacu\nEnough to feed two people, with possible left-overs to take home. While there were plenty of the vegetable side, I wish there were more of the rice and beans (Tacu Tacu.) The skin on the chicken has a nice golden brown color, with a light crispness to match. If this is your first time dining at Lim\u00f3n, I encourage you to order their chicken! \n\nService is pleasant, nothing extraordinary. The floors could have used a bit of cleaning. I'm assuming with the constant flow of customers and limited space between tables this may have been overlooked. \n\nAstonishingly, the amount we paid for our meal was very reasonable. Considering the Sangria was the most expensive item on the bill at $35.00 a pitcher, our dinner was very inexpensive compared to most places in the area.

I love Peruvian food and I was looking forward to enjoying this place; however, I left disappointed, dissatisfied, and insulted. We were a party of eleven, and when the waiter took our order, he forgot three of us. When he was partially finished with taking the orders from one side of the table, he promptly moved on to the other. We were expecting him to come back, but he did not. Perplexed, we called him over, and gave him our orders. When we were trying to order drinks, my sister asked for a bloody mary, since they have an open bar. The waiter asks for her ID, which she hands over, and then he reveals that they do not make bloody mary's. A trained waiter should have divulged this, and asked for the ID at the same time- instead, he played around with the fact. Furthermore, he did not offer an alternative to the bloody mary. The most terrible happening of this experience was the manager's doing. When my mother received her Ceviche Mixto (sorry, no pic) she asked the manager if they offered \"tostadas.\" The manager answered in spanish \"this is not a Mexican restaurant, it is Peruvian.\" In another case, I would have dropped everything and asked for the check immediately, but there was another side of the family present. I have never been insulted or treated like that ever, in any food place. Note to the manager, what you should have done is: say no, offer a substitute, turn around, get it, come back with it, and leave. But no, you had to behave in the most ridiculous and disgusting manner. We did not ask you for a fact about the place, we asked you for something you could potentially serve, therefore, you either serve it, or serve us an alternative.  After behaving like a child, the manager brought us some sort of yucca chips, which was very displeasing. By the way, what was brought to us are still \"tostadas,\" but they are made with yucca instead of maize; this fact only emphasized the unnecessarily immature behavior of the manager. In any case, the Lomo was second-rate, chewy and gummy, but the octopus was great, as well as the Ceviche Mixto. Untrained staff, disrespectful manager, and hit-or-miss food.

Like most restaurants in the city, they don't have a parking lot. It was pouring rain that day so we were lucky to find street parking two blocks away. I made a quick reservation about 30 minutes before we arrived for dinner around 6pm and the place looked really busy when we walked in. Lots of windows which is nice. They have another dining room downstairs and that's where we were seated. No windows and kind of dark, and the acoustics down there was strange. We were seated near a big party that was a little loud (which doesn't normally bother me at all) but the sound just seemed to be amplified x10. The sound dramatically decreased walking just ten steps away. \n\nWe enjoyed the food though. We got a chicken and rice for my 4 year old, my husband got the lomo saltado, and I got a pallela dish. We also got empanadas. Everything was really tasty.", "author": "Susan K."}

The hosts and waiters are all really friendly and helpful in making suggestions while ordering your meal.  \n\nWe ordered : \n- A glass of Sangria\n- Cl\u00e1sico Ceviche de Pescado (Fish)\n- Leche de Tigre Cocktail\n- Quarter white rotisserie chicken, with sweet potato fries and rice.  \n\nThe menu has a variety of items to choose from --chicken, ceviches, empanadas, or larger entrees.  Your bound to find something for every palate ; however, the non-meat eaters will have limited options.  \n\nThe plates are served family-style allowing my mom and I to try a bit of everything.  The Classic Ceviche is a very good portion (enough for one person to eat alone or to share among two --depending on the appetites) --lots of fresh fish with a great citrusy sauce.  The Leche de Tigre Cocktail is on the smaller side and although very tasty with its mix of seafood (fish, shrimp, calamari) --it wouldn't be enough as a stand alone dish for one person.  Since we had ordered ceviches, the one quarter white piece of rotisserie chicken was a great extra to share. the chicken was flavorful and moist --GREAT for being white meat chicken which is easy to dry out.  The sides were a great accompaniment and a great portion --we ordered the sweet potato fries and received a large quantity, but note that if you order the yucca fries, the portion is very different (smaller).  \n\nI'd definitely recommend this restaurant to people --great peruvian treats in the heart of the city.

This review is for the management. \nI have been a longtime fan of Limon, I live in the 'hood, so it's my go to for good, consistent reliable great comfort food. Limon is the place I bring my out of town friends or place I pick for b-days and group gatherings. The chicken is delicious, it melts in your mouth. I always have the chicken and a couple sides. If with a bigger party we get more sides, they are all good. I've occasionally tried other entrees but their chicken is so good, I've even ordered a chicken for the table, so I can at least have a few bites. \nSo why one star? First, I'd never been to this location, I always go to Valencia, but we decided to try it for a change of pace. It was packed so I can't imagine that it is always this bad, but wow. The food was inedible. My chicken was so dry, I was hungry so I tried to eat it, but I took one last bite and spit it out in my napkin, no way I could eat it. I actually ordered the half because I thought I'd take some home for lunch, what a waste. It was dry, shriveled, gross. I had the yucca fries and beans and rice for sides. The fries were delicious. they were the only thing that were edible. The beans and rice were a gelatinous flavorless blob, reminiscent of dog food. If I didn't know it was beans and rice, I would not have known. I took one bite. I was done. \nTypically when you return full plates the waiter will ask if everything is ok, but we ate at the bar so no one asked, I really wanted to say something, but I didn't want to be a buzzkill on an otherwise fun night catching up with a good friend. She didn't say anything, but I noticed that she only ate her steak and left the sides almost untouched. \nWho knows? Perhaps a bad night? Either way, you are lucky I am a regular and have had many, many wonderful meals at Limon, because if it were my first I would never be back. SF has too many good restaurants. You cannot slide like this. Please, do some quality control, make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. No one likes to waste their hard-earned cash on a bad meal, and I don't want you to go out of business. I want to be able to rely on you being there!\nMeanwhile, I will never go to this location again, unless it's for a drink at the bar. As always the service was incredible. Everyone was so nice.

Note: the music is loud. Felt almost more like a club atmosphere than restaurant. \n\nWe had to wait at least 15 min before anyone even acknowledged us. For drinks I decided to try the maracuya sour and bf got the sneaky limon. Both of our drinks have egg whites in them and that usually gives a frothy top. I have no clue what happened to mine (obviously wasn't shaken well) because it looked like scrambled eggs. NO frothiness. Taste was decent. Bf's drink had the tiniest bit of froth but still not what I would consider passable. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the ceviche mixto, half rotisserie chicken with yucca fries and tacu tacu for the sides, and the truffle mac and cheese. The ceviche was good! Nice and bright with big chunks of fish. After we ordered, our server came back and asked if we wanted chips with the ceviche. We said sure. The taro chips are very similar (if not the same) as the Terra ones that you can get in the stores. When we got the bill I didn't realize it was $4 -___- a tad overpriced and wish the server would have told us since it wasn't on the menu.\n\nThe chicken was tender and well seasoned, even the white meat (though the dark meat was much juicier). The sides were good and the sauces that came with the chicken were on point. The truffle mac and cheese was truffly without being overpowered, and the noodles were al dente. \n\nWe got 1 more round of drinks to see if they would be better than the first, and luckily they were. The original pisco sour had the frothiness and was well balanced, and bf enjoyed the chicararra. \n\nFor dessert we got the bread pudding which was tasty and definitely a great choice. \n\nService was soooo slow. There seemed to be only 2 servers but tons of bus boys just standing around. It took forever to get someone's attention and I think when they made our first round of drinks, they just had someone put the ingredients quickly together since the bar was backed up.

Prior to my reservation, I chose to go with Limon because of all the positive and great things I have experienced dining at the restaurant, also heard from friends who have dined with here before and mostly, with great accommodation for huge parties. Everything was going well and I especially appreciated the host (whose name started with an E) and their politeness and attentiveness. As you see, not all of our parties arrived at the same time, but the host was really nice and directed us to the bar while we waited to be seat. That was no problem at all, we even caught glimpses of the Warriors' game playing on the monitors. \n\nA few things did not go as planned and while I felt it may have been an honest mistake, we were not offered an apology, not once. Right before our appetizers and entrees were served, our waiter brought out our drinks - spilled one of the drinks on one of my dinner guest's Louis Vuitton purse and did not apologize or excuse himself. He did not remake the drink and proceed to hand it to her (half full). Also my empanadas were like warm and burnt, most of the steak in the Lomo's were over cooked, and just overall the food was below standard. Secondly, I'm unsure if this may be a restaurant policy but we were not made aware of this, the waiter informed us we would be served the cake, so we waited for about 20 minutes before we reached out to the manager Javier who was extremely rude. Javier refused to serve the birthday cake until every person was finished with their entr\u00e9e, which we were not aware of since the waiter informed us he would get the cake even though there was one guest who was still eating due to her food coming out extremely late. Javier decided to get very smart with me and even slightly raised the tone in his voice when I grew frustrated because we were not informed of the cake policy. When the cake was brought out, the slices were incredibly thin, comparable to a slice of bread. Needless to say, not only myself, but my guests all seem quite disappointed. Especially since it was an ice cream cake, it was partly melted by the time it was served. Lastly, there was a huge confusion and mix up on the bill - we were charged incorrectly for quite a few items we never received. We had a difficult time communicating with the manager Javier on duty that night. Not only was he unhelpful, he was also very rude and unprofessional.Unfortunately, it was a very disappointing and poor dining experience for all of us.

I have a soft spot for Peruvian food after I was introduced to it after visiting the country a few years ago. \nI came back craving a few of the signature dishes. After that, whenever someone suggests Peruvian, I jump at the suggestion. \n\nWhile I couldn't find Aji de Gallina or Chaufa on the menu, we did have some good dishes to choose from. \n\nFood & Drink\n\nPollo a la Brasa - this is a staple of a Peruvian restaurant, and (I hear) amongst Peruvian restaurants this is how they judge their merit.  If their rotisserie chicken  is good, then they are worth \"their salt\" as the saying goes. \nLim\u00f3n's chicken was good. The dark meat was moist. The white meat was a little dry, but luckily it was served with a duo of Ajis. (Another way that Peruvian restaurants judge themselves.) the sauces definitely added to the dish and were welcome. \n\nLomo Saltado - if you have never had this dish before, it is basically beef stir fry with French fries. All good things.  This was good as well.  The marinade in the steak was flavorful, it was a little small of a portion and I feel like the meat could have been more tender, but overall it was good.  The sauce when mixed with the rice was a special treat.  \n\n\nCeviche Mixto - I really liked the ceviche!  We chose the mixed version with fish, calamari, and tiger shrimp marinated (\"cooked\") in the citrus juice \"Leche de Tigre.\" It even had choclo and canchita.\n\n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese - what is truffle Mac & cheese doing at a Peruvian restaurant?!?!  I don't care. It was delicious. Served in an iron skillet, it was cheesy and \"truffely\" but not overwhelming. I'm going to be thinking about this dish in the future. \n\nThe sangria was good too!\n\nWe had three people and shared the 4 dishes. This was probably the right amount of food for us.  \n\nService\nIt was ok. Not bad, but not terribly attentive. Our server seemed nice enough. \n\nAtmosphere \n\nThe upstairs was cute.

Luckily we made reservations and were seated promptly. Unfortunately, we came the day they were closing early for a company party. As such, some of the items weren't available at the time of order. However, the service was excellent, and even though they closed early, we never felt rushed to finish. \n\nI ordered the half chicken with tacu tacu and camote frito. When the food came out, some of our orders got a little mixed up, with different/missing sides. They were quick to amend the issue and brought us extra sides to share so everyone got to try more than they ordered, which was a huge plus. My chicken was delicious, but I only had dark/thigh meat because they ran out of white/breast. All of the sides I tried, tacu tacu, sweet potato fries and yuca fries, were delicious as well, especially with the provided aji sauces. The whole backside of the menu was dedicated to drinks: beers, wines, and cocktails. I had a beer and tried the pisco sour, but there was nothing special about it. It was good, but it wasn't memorable.\n\nAt the end of the day, Limon's chicken is very good. But is half a chicken here equivalent to 4 whole Costco rotisserie chickens? That's for you to decide. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes and hopefully they'll have chicken breast next time, but it may be awhile before I crave such expensive chicken again.", "author": "Philip W."}

I felt really rush with the waiter as he didn't give us much time to figure out what we wanted to eat. We ordered the paella, quarter chicken (dark) with yuca fries & veggies, ceviche, & 2 glasses of sangria.\n\nPaella was a disappointment, it was kinda watery tasting. I hate to compare it this way, but to Trader Joe's frozen paella.\n\nQuarter chicken was good, but for the price you pay for it, just okay. I feel like Costco isn't too far off.\n\nYuca fries - it's just like a potato. eh. The aioli sauce was good though.\n\nGrilled veggies - yum. Worth it.\n\nCeviche - Delicious. It was with the passionfruit sauce and yummy yummy. Would order again.\n\nSangria - Hard tie with the ceviche. It was super good. \n\nI give this place 3 stars because of the service. I didn't like being rushed and also he kept continuously pushing the specials on me. Like, I didn't know the prices of the special so stop, also I said I don't eat dairy and you're still pushing the gnocchi that had cheese that could not be removed. Please, stop. \n\nI think if we came on a normal night it would have been fine. I do really like that they took reservations. Definite plus for that. Would I come back? Yes, but probably would, but not my first choice.", "author": "Julie L."}

I can't remember what it's called, but pretty popular and common at Peruvian places.

Our friend Ann S invited us at 5 pm on a Monday afternoon to meet here at Limon Rotisserie and have dinner with visiting Yelpers Yuri and Nadine, and I'm like, why not? We've never been to Limon and though I was in the middle of making a Coconut Cream Pie in observance of Pi Day, I'm always up for having dinner in the city with fun company! \n\nI'm so glad we joined our friends that evening 'cause I loved Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie! I can see why  this place was packed even on a Monday night. Their food is fantastic! We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared them all family-style. Here's a rundown of what we ordered:\n\nTartara de Tuna -- so light and perfect. Dressing is just right.\n\nCeviche Mixto -- very refreshing, not too acidic and the seafood was nice and tender.\n\nYuca fries -- this was just okay. I'm not a big fan of yuca fries as they are too stringy for me, so I won't get this next time as a side to the chicken.\n\nCamote fries -- we got this as a side to our chicken order, and they were fine if you love sweet potato fries.  \n\nWhole Pollo a la Brasa -- very good. This rotisserie chicken is definitely a lot tastier than the  grocery store variety.  Loved the marinade and in general it was very moist.  The dark meat sections were juicy, the breast a little dry and the wings a bit overcooked.  It comes with two sauces and they were very good with the chicken.  \n\nLomo Saltado -- marinated beef tenderloin with onions and fries. This was my favorite out of all the dishes.  The beef was tender and the sauce was really tasty.  Came with rice on the side.  I would definitely order this again next time. \n\nWe also ordered a pitcher of sangria ($30) and that was enough for 6 of us.  We didn't try dessert as we were simply too full after all that food.  Service was a little slow.  We had to ask for the Sangria as it was taking a long time to get to our table.  The food also took longer than usual.

Seafood ceviche was really OK, but things went downhill rapidly. Hot sauce requested when we ordered the cerviche did not arrive until we were almost done with the chicken, (Repeated requests to each of our waiters.) Chicken was luke warm, as if it had been brought over from another restaurant and then microwaved briefly. Empanadas ordered, never arrived until we caught the eye of some head waiter and told him our problems. They arrived barely warmed up, and not filled with anything recognizable as chicken..\n\nWe then overheard that the table next to us was told they were just about out of chicken. This is 7 pm!

My advice if you like good ceviche, is to skip it and focus on their stronger dishes.\n\nSecond dish was the lomo saltado. Good serving size with a good steak to fries to veggies ratio.

I was still holding out that Pio Pio in NYC had the best rotisserie chicken. This location is popular! At first, I thought they only had one dining area, but surprise! Downstairs had plenty of tables and a bar. Winnn. And thank you, Yelp reservations. Love it.\n\nOrdered:\n- Half Chicken $16.95: slow-roasted with aji sauces, sweet potato fries and tacu tacu. Honestly, I chose the tacu tacu because of the funny name, but you know, sometimes food with funny names are actually freakin' delicious. Yes to sauteed rice and beans. Chicken was (mostly) moist and juicy, but the skin was so good. All the flavors were on the skin and it had that perfectly roasted crunch when you bite into it.\n- Lomo Saltado $16.95: beef tenderloin sauteed with onions, tomatoes, fries, soy sauce, and rice. Almost Asian-sounding (and Asian-tasting) but also freakin' delicious. Omggg so good. The beef was so tender and the flavors meshed together so well. Tip: eat the rice separately at first, BUT THEN, mix it all together and leave the rice to soak up the juices/oil a bit. Mmmmm so good.\n\nFriendly service as well, didn't have to be kept waiting.

We don't have the opportunity to sample Peruvian cuisine too frequently so this was a pleasant experience for us. We met friends here on Sunday evening during Halloween weekend - great seats by the window for four adults and a baby (didn't get to use the high chair as much but it's the small black high chairs by Koala that we prefer). Restaurant was pretty busy and our server was relatively attentive. \n\nThe smells as we waited for our food to come were incredible and noteworthy - this particular location has the tables quite cosy and close, and the ambience is lively but quite loud.  My husband ordered a quarter dark chicken with the green beans and yuca fries (the meal came with the aji sauce). I had the Lomo Saltado and our friends ordered half a chicken and Seco de Costillas so we could try a little of everything.  Everything was wonderfully flavored and there was a ton of food.  The fries and the meat in my lomo saltado were the standout elements of the dish.  I kept stealing my husband's green beans (to be fair he also helped himself to my lomo so I feel it was even) and even my little one kept asking for more rice, green beans, lomo meat, and chicken.  Had we not been there to celebrate a wondrous occasion that roused a boisterous conversation, everyone would have been happy to fully concentrate on eating the wonderful meal and savoring the flavors.  \n\nAs it was an extremely happy occasion for our party, the one negative I had from this experience was the change in attentiveness and tone as our waiter (and it felt like other patrons) started checking in on us a little too frequently.  I felt like we were not being allowed to enjoy our food and indulge in conversation with great company.  I did not see a huge line (though there were definitely a lot of people in and out) so I could not see the reasoning as to why we needed to be pushed out.  My little one was getting fussy towards the end (which we knew and were trying to finish up to leave) but the amount of side glances and \"check ins\" by the waiter towards the end really made me uncomfortable.  I suppose I come from a place where slower meals are taken in stride when you have good food and good company.  Perhaps we were not in like company at that time because it felt like we were being encouraged to leave.  In either case, everything else was wonderful up until the very end of the meal.  I would go again without question but I would feel like I needed to watch our time lest we \"over stay\" our welcome.  Doesn't seem right to me as a paying customer but maybe it's because I am from out of town and just excited to hang out with great friends for a little longer before we part.", "author": "Julie W."}

The restaurant is really cute with a whole basement for additional seating and a bar.\n\nFOOD\n- Pollo a la brasa- Limon's most famous dish of rotisserie chicken. Juicy, marinated chicken that is perfect with the paired sauces and sides. Half chicken ($16.95) can be shared with 2 people, whole chicken ($24.95) for 4. The tacu tacu (sauteed rice and beans), yuca fries, and vegetales salteados (sauteed veggeis) are all delicious.\n- Ceviche de Pescado y Camaron (fish and shrimp $14.95)- delicious, really nice citrus marinade with the seafood.\n- Truffle mac and cheese ($8.95)- can't go wrong with creamy mac and cheese\n- Empanadas ($8.95)- large empanadas with a lot of filling. The crust is a nice balance of crispy outside and chewy inside. I prefer the carne with beef, eggs, olives, and raisins over the queso.\n\nDRINKS\nIf you love sours and refreshing mule-type/Pimm's Cup drinks, then you'll love the drinks here. My favorite is the lychee chilcano ($12) with pisco, ginger ale, bitters, and syrup. The flavors are infused into the pisco so you can actually see it sitting at the top of the counters if you're eating in the basement.\n\nThe restaurant isn't that big, so make sure to book a reservation.

I've been here twice, both with big groups, and they do have a lot seating to accomodate big groups. If you have 15 or more people, you have to do 1 of the 3 pre-fixed menus, and everyone has to agree on the same one.\n\nLast time I was here, we did #2 pre-fixed menu. Overall, the food was pretty good. The tuna tartar appetizer and the ceviche mixto were both really good and fresh (4/5). I didn't try the beet salad because I don't like beets, and the regular salad was pretty standard. The second round of food came with empanadas, french fries, beef with peppers/onions and soaked french fries, and crispy chicken. All the food was good and the empanadas came with this delicious amarillo sauce. \n\nFor the main course, we just got a bunch of chicken and white rice with the amarillo sauce, which is such an amazing sauce. It was a lot of chicken and I'm definitely chicken-ed out for a while.\n\nMy main complaint is that I don't think the amount of food we got was proportional to what we paid. We each had to pay $34 (pre tax, tip and surchage) for the #2 premixed menu, but they only brought us 3 plates of each food. I'm very certain that if we were 12 people instead of 15 people, we would have each paid the same price and they would have brought us the same amount of food (but we would have gotten more food). We got 1/2 an empanada a person and I got one square of beef from the second round. If we had 3 less people, I would have paid $34 but probably gotten a full empanada and 2 or 3 squares of beef.\n\nOverall, if you love chicken then come here.

So this place definitely hit the spot! \n\nWe ordered the lomo saltado, chicharron de pollo and half rotisserie chicken with sides of yucca and rice/beans mix. The chicken also comes with a side of three dipping sauces, which are great to dip with just about anything-- the chicharron, the lomo saltado beef, and the rotisserie chicken, and best of all -- great for dipping fries and yucca fries in!  My favorite dish was the rotisserie chicken-- the meat was perfectly tender and seasoned inside, which was a whole lot more flavorful than Costco chicken! \n\nParking here can be kind of tough, so I recommend taking Bart if you can.  Service is pretty good here as well.\n\nIf you love Peruvian food, definitely come by here and check out Lim\u00f3n! (try the chicken!)", "author": "Matthew L."}

I didn't even need to try any of the dipping sauces...it was that good on it's own.\n\nThe veggies were super varied and perfectly cooked. Sometimes eating something so simple and having it be so perfect is just....really nice.

At Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie, I left with a massive food baby having eaten the best rotisserie chicken of my life. Dinner here almost felt like a dream.  I really don't remember much, but I remember Limon being one of my favorite dining experiences in San Francisco. We came in with a reservation and were led down a mysterious staircase into a loud cellar-like basement, the smell of delicious roasted goodness in the air. People were yelling, laughing and having fun. It completely felt like a perfect night out. I only wish I was hungier that night so I could enjoy the food even more. \n\nI've never had Peruvian food before coming in, and I can confidently say that Limon was the perfect introduction. Limon had the perfect mix of savory, peppery and umami and I loved every bite.  \n\n----\n*Pollo a la Brasa (Rotisserie Chicken) - These guys are known for their chicken, so this is an absolute must have. The chicken was nothing like anything I have tasted before. Very well seasoned in all sort of savory Peruvian spices, and cooked to perfection. The meat was incredibly moist with all the juices trapped inside. It comes with aji sauces, which added another layer of flavor to the chicken.\n\n*Ceviche Mixto (Fish, Calamari, Shrimp Ceviche) - I was a little hesitant to try this one because I'm not really into raw dishes  but this came as a pleasant surprise. The lime marination really disguises the dish from tasting too raw, but maintains freshness. Had a slight crunch too.\n\n*Pulpo a la Parilla (Octopus, Mashed Potatoes) - Probably my least favorite of the lot, but still downright delicious. I wish this one had more flavor, but then again, maybe I'm just not into octopus....\n\nLomo Saltado (Beef Stir Fry, Fries) - I loved this one so much. The beef and vegetables together were burst of so much flavor, it almost felt like my tastebuds were about to explode. Pair that up with french fries, and you got one of my favorite dishes of all time! I really enjoyed coating the french fries in that delicious sauce. Good lord...\n----\n\nWith food that delicious and unique, Lim\u00f3n definitely holds a seat at my list of top food recommendations.", "author": "Mari U."}

Very time consuming.\n\nWithin one-two hours they had apparently lost my reservation and vehemently told me it didn't exist.

(And this was before opening time so it wasn't busy). \n\nAfter being shuffled around and given attitude, I asked if I could speak to the person who took it since they themselves suggested that, but I got put on hold with 3 different ppl picking up the phone giving me useless, confused answers and them saying she was busy but would get back to me, put me on hold, she will call you back, and more of the same continues...never getting that person on the phone.

However, Limon cooks theirs nicely, at least for the skin's seasoning. The crispy skin was delicious, salty with a hint of smokey flavor. For the meat itself, dark was very most and white a tad bit dry. But that's when Limon's sauces come in; with the choice of four different sauces, you're bound to find one you like -- aji amarillo huacatay (yellow chili pepper and herb), aji amarillo mustard (yellow chili pepper and mustard), spicy rocoto molido (red hot chili pepper), or chimichurri (chopped parsley and oil).\n\nWith the chicken entrees, you also get two sides. We opted for the tacu-tacu, which is saut\u00e9ed rice and beans, and the sweet potato fries. The rice was very moist and mild, but a bit mushy. And the sweet potato fries were just okay. Portion-wise, Limon's chicken is the best value on their menu, and perfect for sharing too.\n\nAnother Peruvian staple is Lomo Saltado: saut\u00e9ed beef, onions, tomatoes, and fries in a soy sauce-vinegar-spices blend. But Limon calls their version \"Lomito\" instead, as it's a smaller portion and without the side of rice. The beef cubes here were a little too chewy, and the fries were obviously too mushy from soaking in the sauce. But the sauce itself was delicious, salty and a hint of tart.\n\nService was quick, as food arrived within five minutes of ordering. The restaurant isn't that large, but there are two other Limon's in the city: another one in the Mission and one in Bayview. Limon gets busy quickly, so prepare for a long wait during peak lunch/dinner hours; otherwise, make reservations ahead of time.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Food comes out fast, and yet I don't feel like they're trying to rush us out of there. \n\nCons:\n- Margaritas are a little sweet for my taste\n- Downstairs can be quite noisy when it's a packed house\n\nDuring our most recent visit, we ordered and whole and a half chicken plus the ceviche trio for 4 (hungry) adults. Right amount of chicken and sides, we probably didn't need (but also didn't regret!) the ceviche. With drinks and tip came to about $150. If you're looking to do this dinner on a budget, skip on cocktails not on food :) So excited for the Bayview location to open closer to my house!", "author": "Ashley M."}

The chicken wasn't anything special in terms of flavor and the ceviche portion was small. The fried yucca was probably the best thing that we ordered. It had a nice texture and wasn't too thick or dry. This place is very Americanized and modern so I understand its appeal in that sense.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-29", "description": "TLDR - good Peruvian food, a little pricey; definitely recommend the ceviche and rotisserie chicken\n\nI've both dined in here and had food from catering. The food dining in was obviously better, but their catering isn't a bad option. Food is generally served family style, so I'd recommend coming with a few people to share several dishes. Portion sizes are on the small side though, especially for the price, so either don't expect to get very full or expect to be paying quite a bit.\n\nFrom dining in:\n\n-CEVICHE MIXTO ($14.95) - 5/5 \n[fish, calamari, tiger shrimp]\nReally good and fresh! The ceviche has an ever-so-slight kick to it from the chilis. Not a fan of the texture of the corn though, but I feel that way about all ceviches with that corn. Portion size is really small, unfortunately. I've had this for catering as well and even then it was really fresh!\n\n-POLLO A LA BRASA ($16.95, half chicken) - 4.5/5\n[choice of 2 sides]\nTheir well-known rotisserie chicken. A little greasy, but the chicken is really tender! The half chicken portion comes with 4 pieces of chicken so it's good for sharing between 2 people. For our sides, we got the CAMOTE FRITO (sweet potato fries), which were perfect, and the VEGETALES SALTEADOS, which were too greasy for my liking. The chicken isn't quite as tender with catering and it's a little greasier, but still pretty good\n\n-CARNE EMPANADAS ($8.95) - 4/5\n[hand-cut top sirloin, sauteed onions, hard boiled eggs, olives & raisins]\nI wasn't a fan of the catered empanadas because the pastry was soft and way too oily, but the ones dining in had a perfect crisp to them. The beef filling is flavorful and a tad bit sweet from the raisins. There's a pretty good bread to filling ratio too.\n\nFrom catering:\n\n-ENSALADA RUSA ($8.95) - 4/5\n[beets, potatoes, carrots, choclo/corn, peas]\nNothing fancy. It's a pretty simple salad really, but I love beets and it was light and refreshing (without the aioli) in comparison to the meat and stir-fried veggie dishes. Some of the roots tasted too earthy though. Probably wouldn't be a go-to item for me dining in but good overall.\n\n-TRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE ($8.95) - 4/5\nMMM truffle oil! So heavenly. Rather rich and creamy so I couldn't really manage to eat more than a few bites, but it still didn't feel super heavy and didn't taste as cheesy as most mac and cheese (it was more creamy than cheesy)\n\n-LOMO SALTADO ($16.95) - 4/5\n[beef tenderloin stir fry, onions, tomatoes, fries, soy sauce, rice]\nA little on the salty side but the beef was cooked pretty well. Not the most tender, but definitely not dry or tough/chewy.\n\n-SECO DE COSTILLAS ($13.95) - 3/5\n[braised beef short ribs, huacatay-cilantro broth, potatoes, carrots, peas]\nNot bad, but also a little salty. Beef was a little dry\n\n-CHICHARRON DE POLLO ($11.95) - 3/5\n[crispy chicken marinated in soy sauce, garlic, aji amarillo, salsa criolla]\nMost of the chicken was super dry, tough and overcooked, but some were slightly more tender. I think the chicken was supposed to be crispy but the chicken we got every time we catered was never crispy. Okay flavor but mostly just salty and greasy\n\n-CHAMPINONES ANTICUCHEROS ($10.95) - 3/5\n[stir-fried mushrooms, garlic, onions]\nNormal stir fry. Salty and greasy like everything else\n\n-VEGGIE EMPANADAS ($8.95) - 2.5/5\n[mushroom, spinach, choclo, mascarpone cheese]\nThe filling was on the salty side and too creamy from the cheese. Not a huge fan.", "author": "Jessie L."}

I like the food but I'm not a fan, so 3 stars it is.\n\nAlright, here's the story: we came here on Saturday night with reservation at 8:30pm of 20-ish people. The restaurant looked amazing from the outside and there were couple people waiting in line. The parade in downtown slowed everything down so we got here late -- luckily the space wasn't ready for us so we still got to make it to the reservation. It was almost 9pm when everyone got to sit in. By the way, the parking was a nightmare but that's just how it works in San Francisco (don't be surprised). \n\nWe were led to the basement -- nice and loud. The atmosphere was good but it was chilly. We got pints of Sangrias: white was light and red was sweet. Apparently we got a set menu since we have a large group and the set price was $32 per person. Here's what we had: Ensalada Mixta, Ceviche Mixto, Tartara De Tuna, Pollo, Pollo A Las Brasa, Tacu-tacu and fries. There should be one more dish but I had no memories on that.\n\nHonestly I was starving so everything was yummy. Pollo A Las Brasa was dry but it went well with sauces. Tartara De Tuna was amazing, it was the highlight of the night, I don't have too much Tuna Tartar in my life but this was one of the best yet. I strongly recommend it. The texture was right and it wasn't too sour, ate it with potato chips (not the bagged potato chips) and it was perfect. \n\nThe service was great, servers were very friendly and kept out water glasses filled. It turned out there were multiple birthday groups here on the same night, they were very busy but still got us with everything. The bill came out and it was $53 per person yet I don't feel the food portion match up the price. We had the server to cut the birthday cake and it took about 20 mins to do so, then here's another highlight of the night: $48 for cake cutting. Woah, the cake was like $20 or something from Safeway and it was the first time ever I heard the cake cutting fee was double the cake price. SURPRISE. I'm sure it required skills to cut a round cake into 20 pieces. \n\nThat being said, I love Tartara De Tuna but I couldn't stand for $48 cake cutting fee.

Limon comes highly recommended in the San Francisco area (they're opening more stores across the Bay!), so we had to see what the hype was about of this staple Peruvian restaurant here. \n\nFOOD: Pollo a La Brasa, Whole Chicken ($24.95) was pretty good. I have to say though, the price does seem steep, but the chicken was pretty tasty. Not dry at all! THe sides we got were the yuca fries and the vegetales salteados. The yuca fries were great, but the vegetales salteados was a bit bland to me. Great to have vegetables, but I wish something more was done to them. We also got the Ceviche Mixto ($14.95), which comes with fish, calamari, and shrimp. I will have to say for the portion size was small for the price of the food. I thought it was pretty good ceviche, but a wee bit more acidity for me would have been nice. In addition, we got the champinones anticucheros ($10.95), which to me were delicious. The adresso anticucheros sauce was the right amount of saltiness and tang that gave the mushrooms great flavor. The Polli-Papas ($11.95) was also ordered, which to me, was pretty good, but mixed feelings at the table. With crispy parts of the chicken, and the aji amarillo/mustard aioli, I am a fan of those bits of chicken. We also got the Truffle Mac & Cheese ($8.95), which plays on everything in California high dining needs truffle oil. I thought it tasted OK, but not really worth ordering again. Finally, we got Lomo Saltado ($16.95), with beef tenderloin, onion, tomatoes, fries, and rice. I have to say, the Lomo Saltado was pretty tasty, but unfortunately, the beef was a bit tougher than I would have liked. \n\nDRINKS: Sangria. YES. Pitcher for a table of 5 is sufficient (depends on how many drinks you want), but we ended up getting two pitchers. \n\nOVerall, I found Limon Rotisserie to be pretty pricey for what the portion size. My favorites were the pollo a la brasa, polli papas, aji sauces, and yuca fries. I see that they're coming to East Bay, so maybe I will give it another shot once they hop over the water!", "author": "Albert H."}

My coworkers always raved about the tacu tacu, I was skeptical because.. how good can rice and beans be? It is SO good, it's a must and you will not be disappointed. They combine two simple main ingredients into such a flavorful side dish! The ceviche here is also very refreshing and lemon-y, my fav. It's hard to pick, so go for the trio! The tuna tartar is so fresh and delicious. I haven't had anything here that I didn't like.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving my overall experience two stars... our waiter, Hector, was awful. It was to the point where I felt discriminated. We were seated few minutes upon arrival without a reservation, awesome. Sat down at our table for quite a while looking over the menu, we were done deciding what we wanted to order for this evening... still no one came over to check on us or to even offer us water on such a hot summer day. FINALLY, Hector came over with a smirk on his face and asked if we were ready to order. There was no  small talk, didn't even ask how we were doing, nothing. Just went and took our order and left, never really came back to check on us, see how we were enjoying to food. NOTHING. But the funny thing was... he went over to other tables and checked how they were doing, asking about the food, smiling, etc. I don't know if Hector has a problem against asian nationalities or what because the service he provided to us was bullshit and no one deserves to be treated like that. I have money, an appetite, just like every other person in that restaurant. I am a very generous tipper, but for the first time in a long time.. I did not want to tip AT ALL because of how horrible Hector made our experience. I will come back for the food, but will make sure Hector is not my waiter.

It may not be the best restaurant SF has to offer, but I've been wanting to try them ever since I saw them on Check Please! Bay Area.  In fact, they were actually the first restaurant I ever saw on the show!\n\nAlthough I actually tried the Lim\u00f3n on Valencia about a year ago, I never wrote a review because our meal wasn't off the regular menu (we had a prix fixed menu for my friend's birthday).  However, what I had was good enough to make me want to come back to write a proper review, even if I actually came to this location instead.\n\nCompared to the one on Valencia, this location has a darker and cozier sort of feel.  Great for a date, but perhaps it was a little too \"cozy\" during our meal (more on that later).  Still, the menu is exactly the same and the food was just as good.\n\n-- LYCHEE SOUR - Lychee Infused Pisco Porton, Fresh Citrus, Homemade Syrup, Egg Whites and Drops of Peychauds Bitters...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lim%C3%B3n-rotisserie-san-francisco-3?select=UY9BRtPunchWoWLu3E_XUw#yDA_FXIfBCxO1B96pr3RbA)\nI may not have had a lot of lychee sours in my life, but I know a tasty cocktail when I try one.  And this one, I liked.  The drink had a decent pour of alcohol while still maintaining a nice balance of sweetness and \"sour\".\n\n-- CEVICHE MIXTO - Fish, Calamari & Tiger Shrimp...$12.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lim%C3%B3n-rotisserie-san-francisco-3?select=UY9BRtPunchWoWLu3E_XUw#TwYLpU4oW3s-LPkjDR6M2w)\nA fine rendition of a pretty classic ceviche that, pleasantly, wasn't too acidic.  The chunks of fish were the best part, but as much as I liked them, I can't say the dish was particularly amazing either.  Not bad, just not amazing.\n\n-- CARNE EMPANADA - Hand-Cut Top Sirloin, Sauteed Onions, Hard Boiled Eggs, Olives & Raisins...$7.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lim%C3%B3n-rotisserie-san-francisco-3?select=UY9BRtPunchWoWLu3E_XUw#28nEWMlloaTV0a-Za8yrgQ)\nNow THESE are some legit and tasty empanadas (unlike El Porte\u00f1o's...).  The crust was perfectly golden and there was a good amount of meat/filling, which was quite savory (albeit a little salty).  A great starter, though the chicken one seems more popular.\n\n-- \"LOMITO\" SALTADO - Stir-Fried Sirloin Strips, Onions, Tomato, Soy Sauce, & French Fries...$12.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lim%C3%B3n-rotisserie-san-francisco-3?select=UY9BRtPunchWoWLu3E_XUw#ZVwihIBp-7TfzE7581DOoA)\nI guess it's \"lomito\" because it didn't come with rice, but it still tasted the part.  The strips of beef were really tender and I liked the overall flavors and french fries.  It was a bit salty at the bottom, but it was still a pretty solid dish.\n\n-- POLLO A LA BRASA - Marinated Free-Range Rotisserie Chicken with \"Aji\" sauces and Choice of Two Sides - Yuca Fries and Tacu-Tacu (Sauteed Rice & Beans)...$13.95 (half)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lim%C3%B3n-rotisserie-san-francisco-3?select=UY9BRtPunchWoWLu3E_XUw#Y4Q5kC4tIQuYzW0tB1tycw)\nSurprise, surprise...their signature dish was our favorite.  The breast portion was a touch dry, but the rest of the chicken was really moist.  Plus, the marinade was delicious!  As for the sides, both were great; the Yuca Fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside while the Tacu Tacu was delicious yet simple.\n\nAs for the restaurant's \"cozy\" confines, it would have been fine if we were seated elsewhere.  However, being that we were seated by the window next to the hostess stand, it was extremely annoying having people constantly standing and hovering around our table as they waited for theirs.  I get that space is limited, but a waiting area would be nice, or at least for someone to move the crowd towards the bar.\n\nStill, despite that slight damper we had during our dining experience, it's safe to say that my friends and I still enjoyed our meal.  Except for perhaps the ceviche mixto, all of our dishes were worth getting again.  If/when I come back to Lim\u00f3n though, I might head to the Valencia location instead.  Or just not sit anywhere near the front.", "author": "Mike L."}

When I arrived, several individuals came after me without a reservation and they were told the wait was an hour and a half and that's pretty much how long my group waited, with a reservation. That totally defeats the purpose of having to make a reservation. Our server told us that this is normal for Limon -  but I really have to say that in no restaurant is this ok. There should be a system in place that ensures that those with a reservation are seated before those that do not. Needless to say, we complained about this. \n\nThat being said - our server did apologize for the long wait, said that he would get his manager to speak with us, and would rush our order (it was almost 9pm when we were seated when our reservation was at 7:45pm and we had plans after - this really was wasteful of our time and it was upsetting). True to his word, the moment we ordered - it was like the food appeared in front of us instantly. The service was incredibly fast (less than 10 minutes) and I almost want to say that we waited longer than we actually ate there. \n\nThe food was in fact, really great - we had a whole rotisserie chicken (very tender with great usage of herbs), sweet potato fries (crispy, salted appropriately to bring out the flavor), tacu tacu (rice and beans in almost a mash form, a little salty, but I really enjoyed it), empanadas, and lengua (beautiful presentation, maybe 3 -4 pieces so a little expensive for what you get, but worth a try imo). It doesn't seem like a lot, but it actually put everyone (table of 5) in a comfortable spot. The sangria is also complements the food wonderfully and has little chopped fruit in it. Once we started eating, it was easy to forget why we had been upset in the first place (I'm sure this was a previously concocted plan by the manager - very smart haha). We actually never spoke to him/her, BUT the manager did treat us to some desserts to make up for the time that we waited (mango panna cotta and what seemed like chocolate ice cream in a sundae type cup). I would have loved to give Limon a higher rating - but I already think that 3 is pushing it - the wait was a really terrible start, but I do like that staff tried to make the experience better for unhappy customers. I think that effort does go a long way - but it doesn't justify that kind of wait with a reservation. I would love to try Limon again - as they definitely have a lot to offer - but I just hope I won't run into the same issue!", "author": "Deanna S."}

We ordered the half chicken with sweet potato fries and tuca tuca (sp?) which is essentially mashed rice and beans. The chicken was juicy and seasoned flawlessly. The trio sauces were a perfect compliment. My fave was the habanero mango sauce which I assumed was going to unbelievably spicy, but surprisingly it was not. I wish there could have been more tuca tuca to match the amount of fries. The fries were cooked differently than I had them before - crunchy on the outside but still soft in the middle. It was nothing less than perfect. The sauteed mushrooms we ordered were so soft that one slice with your fork would cut it in half. The sauce was to die for as well. \nThe dessert menu was limited and we went to to try the favorite: chocolate molten cake.

Came here last week for the first time since it seemed like one of the healthier choices in the Mission. For lunch, there was no line on a Sunday at around 1pm. \n\nFor two people, we ordered a half rotisserie chicken and the ceviche mixto. Both were excellent. The rotisserie chicken was incredibly juicy, tender, and not overly greasy. It came with three dipping sauces - one chimichurri sauce and two other creamy sauces with a mint flavor and mustard flavor if I heard/remember correctly. I liked all three but I preferred the chimichurri. The ceviche was also delicious with fresh shrimp, fish and calimari. There were bits of roasted corn that provided additional texture to the fish. \n\nNot cheap (around 3x the cost of the chicken at Safeway or Whole Foods) but not expensive compared to other places you could go on a date.

I have no idea what the accompanying sauces were called (save for the chimichurri) but they were fantastic. Especially the one that also came on the empanadas plates. The mushroom and veggies empanada was delicious, but faded in comparison to it's chicken counterpart which blew it away. And the sauce made what was a lovely dish, wonderful!\n\nAfter a little while, our main course arrived and I could tell that my dish didn't look quite as delectable as it could. The rice was ... wet. It's different from being glistening with the sauce. It's the kind where it is cooked but still could have used a little more time in the pan so as to thicken and enhance every grain of rice. The dish seemed overly dependent on the essence of saffron to protect it's integrity and reputation, with the sofrito seemingly having taken a back seat.\n\nBut I must admit that when friends told me that their rotisserie chicken (Pollo a la Brassa) was the best; they weren't kidding. It's one of my top two rotisserie chicken in the Bay Area --- the other being that at the inimitable Zaki Kabab House in Albany. \n\nBut with the uninspired entree I had, I couldn't possibly give it more than 3 stars.\n\n(Oh Shoot!

No offense to any of my fellow yelpers, I can be overly yuppie sometimes as well. \n\nThe chicken is great (thank you for always eating the drier white meat, boyfriend) but I think the other dishes are massively underrated! That being said, the portion sizes (aside from the rotisserie chicken) are a bit small for sharing. The ceviche, while bright and delicious, is enough for 4 bites total. The same can be said for the specials (5 pieces of shrimp for $15?!) and other on-menu items. \n\nOverall, tasty food! Unfortunately, no guinea pig... What's peruvian food without some cuy?!", "author": "Xinxin W."}

I go looking for some delicious chicken but I always end up getting the steak, The seasoning as always and I repeat always on point. It blows my mind how such a small serving of food gets my taste buds bouncing all over the place and I always end up full. Maybe it's the amazing sangria that I get that I find no other restaurant so far in the city can compete with. Yeah it is always packed and sometimes the weight can be a little bit on the long side but it definitely is great for a date whether it's with friends or family and even that special someone. Which is why I'm smart enough to always make a reservation! Now let's not get started on the chicharron as an appetizer and the sweet potato fries OOOOOWWWWEEE!!

Lolo's nearby was out, so we hopped on over to Limon to see what they have to offer! This place has great tapas to choose to from!\n\nWE ORDERED:\n---------------\n\n- Lychee Sour - (mixed with Peruvian alcohol) Not really a big fan of this one, and no it wasn't the egg whites that turned me off. I think it was because the drink was somewhat warm. My friend had the Passion Fruit drink and hers was refreshing and cool. Get the passion fruit one instead, the flavor was so much better also!\n\n- Ceviche Mixto - We love variety and this came with fish, calamari, and shrimp. It was delicious except the cuts of the fish was pretty big for some reason.... lol. Nonetheless we got our ceviche fix on a hot Sunday!!! *Still dreaming of the delicious Peruvian ceviche we had in Puerto Rico though*\n\n- Pulo a la Parilla - I'd recommend getting this grilled octopus with mash dish! Every bite was so good and the sauce is a bonus!\n\n- Lengua a la Parilla - The marinade of their beef tongue is sooo good! I'd come back here just for this dish! The beef tongue is not chewy and dry so the flavor really stood out at every bite!\n\nOverall, Limon did not disappoint with their tapas/small plates offerings! I wish we had tried more dishes, but seriously eating and drinking at three other places *and all the walking*  before coming here really took a toll on us and our appetite. \n\n* FOUR STARS, WILL RETURN*", "author": "Glenn L."}

For sides, we just got vegetales salteados and rice. The vegetables were a perfect side for the chicken.

My bf and I came in around 6:30 and upon entrance the tables looked pretty filled, but the host took us downstairs to be seated where there were plenty additional tables. We were the only ones down there at the time which was a little weird at first cuz it felt kinda like a basement, but our server approached us quickly with water and took our order right away once we were ready. By then it slowly started to fill up.\n\nThe fish and shrimp ceviche was the first to come out, which was very flavorful. It's a little different than what I'm used to since it wasn't all chopped up, but rather thinly cut slices of the fish and half slices of the shrimp. It was in a tangy/citrusy sauce that I really liked. A while after the rest of our order all came at once.\n\nQuarter dark meat chicken: the meat was moist and flavorful, comes with 3 dipping sauces but the chicken is tasty enough to eat alone too. Any portion size comes with 2 sides so we chose the tacu tacu and saut\u00e9ed veggies. The tacu tacu was the saut\u00e9ed rice with beans mixed in, it didn't really have any outstanding flavor, but it was a good side to eat with the chicken. \n\nLomito Saltado: the stir-fried sirlon strips was probably one of our fave dishes. It was well marinated and too salty for me as other people mentioned it to be. I'd only want the meat to be a little more tender next time, but other than that it was very flavorful. I also asked to have the fries separated so that they didn't get soggy\n\nTruffle mac and cheese: this was very rich, creamy and decadent. The noodles were perfectly cooked so that the texture was just right. The serving size was pretty big for just the two of us...or maybe we were getting full but we had some left over.\n\nAnd lastly, we  had a sangria each to wash it down. It's more on the cinnamon/nutmeg side, I wish it was a little stronger heh. The service was so-so. Our waiter was very friendly, but as it got filled up downstairs he checked on us less but there was always someone else making sure our waters were filled. It's also pretty loud downstairs as there are no windows so it's like the noise just bounces off the walls. I would recommend making reservations here esp around dinner time.

Arrived at 12:10 pm, food was not ready, matter fact, they did not even put my order in and was lost somewhere in the bottom of the ocean. It took about 5 minutes for 2 different workers to confirm that indeed I did call the correct Limon, and no I was not an insane lunatic that walked in to claim that I ordered food to go. I even had to show the worker my phone log to prove that indeed I did call the correct number. Finally got my food around 12:25, and I get to indulge in the food. To think that a restaurant sometimes would compensate your lost time and their mistakes by giving a discount and/or some kind of courteous gesture, this was not the case, nor do I care much about that. What I am infuriated about is that they did not even put any utensils or napkins... Sureeeeee, not a problem, I'll just be a caveman and eat with god damn hands.

I would probably never calling in advance for pick up here again, or maybe even pick up to go here again. \n\nMy advice, don't bother in order for pick up here.

We were seated downstairs, crammed around a table, and waited about an hour for our food. To me that is ridiculous especially since we had a reservation. Although we were sat almost immediately, we were not acknowledged whatsoever. Our waitress was almost nonexistent. 15 minutes after being seated, we asked that our food be brought out because we had a prix fixed menu. We continuously asked for water while we waited but it was not brought to us. When the waitress came around and asked for our drink orders, it seemed as if things were going to pick up. Our drinks took about 30+ minutes to be brought out and came out all at different times. By the time the last drink was brought out, everyone else had already placed their drink orders for the second round. We had to ask the waitress 3 times for the mango lemonade before she finally remembered. The time it took for food to come out was so inconsistent. We would get one dish, then a long pause. Then another dish was brought out. It was such a tease.  I understand that we are a large party but it was ridiculous because we had a reservation and was told the food would be brought out within 15 minutes of us asking. The food itself was hit or miss. Some dishes were more burnt than others while other plates seemed to have more. I understand it's a popular restaurant and we had a large party but it was just by far one of the worst dining experiences that I've had in a while. I don't blame the restaurant for being busy but had the service been a bit better then it would have been a different story. It felt as if we were forgotten.

I have more of a bold tastebud, so I rarely do fruity cocktails. BUT! I freakin love lychee martinis. They had a lychee cocktail here and the server recommended it. Sadly, it wasn't for me. There was tequila in it, which was overpowering and lacked my lychee flavor. I ended up giving it away!

Good thing I listened to him because this place was bomb!\n\nWe were planning on having an epic food day, so we didn't order that much. Between the three of us, we split the ceviche mixto, truffle mac and cheese, and chicarron de pollo.\n\nI had gone to La Fusion the night before eating here and ordered the truffle mac and cheese there, so I actually had something to compare the mac and cheese to and...Limon's mac and cheese is superior! It comes in a cast iron skillet and has the perfect amount of truffle. It's also a bigger serving than the one served at La Fusion. Not sure if I would get it again, but if you're into truffle, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe Chicarron de Pollo was delicious! Some pieces were super moist, though my older cousin commented that one of his pieces were dry.\n\nBest thing we ordered by far was the ceviche mixto though! The fish in it is of substantial size so it's not mushy at all and overall, the flavors are amazing. Words cannot describe how much I loved this dish. Must have if you come by!\n\nMy cousin also ordered a lychee drink (can't remember what exactly), but he thought it was really good.

My parents were born in Peru and lived there until their 20's, and really love the food here and think it's one of the better Peruvian restaurants in the Bay Area so you can use that as a baseline for comparison. I also grew up eating homemade Peruvian food and also dined at some of the other Peruvian places in the city (Fresca, Cholo Soy) and this one is my go-to, especially for the rotisserie chicken.\n\nCome with a group of 3-4 people and share a bunch of plates so that you can try a little bit of everything. \n\nPollo a la Brasa - You can get a whole, half, or quarter of a rotisserie chicken - they come with 2 sides and 3 different kind of sauces that are all delicious. They are known for their chicken and it's well-marinated, seasoned, and juicy, so don't leave without trying this.\n\nFor the sides, the yuca fries are delicious but the portion is a bit small (4 pieces) and will probably have you wanting more. Yuca is similar to a potato but starchier - the yuca fries here are done really well and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The sweet potato fries are also delicious and highly recommended but not anything different than sweet potato fries you can get elsewhere or at a burger joint. The vegetales salteados is a good, healthy option for a side with a mixture of vegetables (onions, zucchini, peppers)\n\nCeviche Mixto - With fish, calamari, and shrimp, this is a typical Peruvian dish. The fish is raw and cured / marinated in lime. \n\nChampignones (Mushrooms) - I really liked these mushrooms - they were in a sauce that is a bit on the stronger side, and it overpowers the mushroom taste. But the sauce is actually pretty tasty, not salty, and goes well with the mushrooms, so I actually liked this dish. Otherwise I could just go to the store and sautee mushrooms myself.\n\nEmpanadas - These are deep fried and just okay; the proportion of bread to meat / filling is off, and it's a bit heavy on the bread. Save your money and get El Porteno or El Sur empanadas instead of these.\n\nThe food comes pretty quickly, it's tasty, and reasonably priced. A lunch for 3 people was around $20 per person including tip and tax (no alcohol). I've come here multiple times and will keep coming back. Not too fancy of a restaurant, and a lot of food options.

It reminds me a bit of the rotisserie chicken I can get from the farmer's market at Upper Haight. But sooo much better! Less salty, more tender, and thoughtfully seasoned. I prefer dark over white and would probably just get a quarter of the dark next time instead of half a chicken. The half was way too much for me and my friend (also a small female Asian) to finish.\n\nOne of the specials of the day was mahi mahi grilled with a tasty soy sauce based sauce over a bed of veggies including green beans, mushrooms, and garlic. This was good except that the green beans were sour and expired. You know that taste when you try to eat leftovers that have been in your fridge for 2 weeks...or when you have that veggie you left in there for too long but you decide to cook with it anyway because you don't want to waste $. That's exactly how the green beans tasted and it's the reason why I can't in good conscience give this restaurant more than 3 stars, as much as I enjoyed the chicken and fish.\n\nAnother plus is that all chicken orders come with your choice of two sides. The waiter recommended veggies (which included even more inedible green beans, unfortunately) and sweet potato fries. I think next time I'd stick with the tacu tacu since I like to eat rice with my chicken, but the sweet potato fries were a delight. Very delicious.\n\nAnyway, if I happen to be in the Mission, I wouldn't mind coming here (although I think I prefer Cha-Cha-Cha).

There is a top floor and bottom floor which I think carries most of the larger sized parties. We had a party of 15 so therefore we sat downstairs.\n\nNow we all had the pre-fix of $32 each which included small apps. Nothing stood out but the tar tar. I was actually annoyed of the small sizes of the apps. I mean it's expensive!! Not worth it. Then the rotisserie chicken comes out with 3 different sauces. The chicken is actually good BUT I'd still take Costco chicken anyway. I think the hen rub on the meat was subtle and the white meat was a bit dry. \n\nBottom line, after paying over $600 for all this, I don't think it's worth it. The Peruvian food isn't even all that good. I've personally had a better experience at this other location in San Jose, CA. The apps are a joke to me, I'm sorry.

At this point I see my order sit on the counter for ten minutes before I have someone ring me up.\n\nThey give me the order and when I confirm what was in the order they say \"yes yes it's all there.\"\n\nI get home and half of my order is missing and my food is cold from the wait. I call to see if they will deliver me the food they forgot and they put me on hold for ten minutes before they hang up on me. I call again and wait on hold for another 5 minutes. \n\nOnce I finally get to a manager he said I can come in to pick up the food and he refuses to deliver it. He says he can call me back because there are other customers he has in the restaurant. I ask him if they're more important than me and he says \"yes I can't help you mam but I'll call you back in about ten minutes. GIVE me your phone number.\" \n\nIt was the rudest encounter I have ever had. I have never been told that another customer is more important than me even after they have messed up an order. \n\nI am THOROUGHLY disappointed. I loved this place, but I will NEVER EVER go here again because this customer treatment is unacceptable.\n\nWhen I asked for a refund he laughed at me and I don't even know what there is to call about anymore. I do not recommend this place.\n\nIf you're so damn busy, hire more people. It's that simple. This customer experience is unacceptable. \n\nWhen he finally called me back he argued with me that he couldn't do anything. I asked him to repeat back to me to make sure he understood what happened. He couldn't repeat back to me what I had JUST told him three times indicating he did not listen at all.", "author": "Alina D."}

The major difference is the ambiance. The original location is still the best. The one at Bay-View Hunters Point is like a Chipotle and in a scary neighborhood. We got a reservation at 7 and found some parking near by. The place was packed from the time we got there to the time we left. This memorial weekend both of my daughters came home and they really enjoy the food at Limon. Since the menu has shrunk and only the items that are popular are left, we just about ordered 1 of everything. They were out of the carne empanadas (had the chicken instead). The mixed ceviche and the hanger steak were good. But consensus best was the truffle Mac & Cheese. \n\nService was OK considering the crowds. Th prices are always very reasonable.

We got there and waited literally 2 mins for the table to be cleaned.  \n\nFood- DELISCIOUS!!!! Everything we got was absolutely delicious. \n\nCeviche Mixto- flavor was on point and a good amount for the price. I just wish that they had move variety of seafood. They only had one shrimp, calamari and lots of snapper. In other places that I have gotten ceviche mixto  they had octopus and more variety. But its fine, it was still delicious. \n\nHalf chicken with salad and fries as the sides- also really juicy and good. Yes its just chicken but it was spiced perfectly and roasted to perfection. Even the white meat was still pretty juicy and flavorful. The salad and fries were just average, nothing special.\n\nTruffle Mac and Cheese- it was good, definitely killed the craving for truffle mac and cheese but was not the best I've ever had. It was still really good though. Wish the truffle flavor was stronger.  \n\nDevina Pasion- this drink is so good. Not too sweet and you can't taste the alcohol. We ended up ordering 3 each ;)\n\nService was great and everything came out super quick. Even though they had a wait, we did not feel rushed at all. \n\nOnly issue was the bathroom.

I had to search for 20+ minutes and thankfully I found something. This place is really close to Urban Putt and I want to check that place out. This place is actually pretty big because it there is another floor you have to walk to. It sucks cuz this place is so damn loud so you sorta have to yell across the table. I like the vibe though with the bars and dinner situation..totes SF. So the three of us split four items along with some dranks. When its GNO, I feel obligated to get a drank. If you have a bigger group of like 6-8, they can probably accommodate you only if you make reservations. \n\n1) Lychee sour- I do not like alcohol to begin with but since it had lychee I was praying to the baby jesus that this would be good. I did not taste any lychee and even my alcoholic buddy thought it was too strong. After one sip, I pushed that ish aside. I heard from my friend that the sangria was good doe. \n2) Cheese empanada- I usually like meat but surprising this one was really good. Nothing beats an overly cheesy thing with crispy sides. An order comes with two.\n3) Ceiviche mixto- This was good and fresh but the portion was so small for the price. Bloop. \n4) Lomito Saltado- this is stir fried sirloin with onions and fries. This one of their popular items but I thought it tasted pretty basic bloop...skip\n5) Chicharron de pollo- these are crispy pieces of chicken that are super tender. this was actually reallly good and I could tell this was no chicken breast. It was all the fatty thigh. Nommmm.\n6) Chocolate Bandido- chocolate cake with white cream- I wish that cream was ice cream but oh well. Surprisingly the cake was sooo moist and decadent. I thought it was gonna be dry and basic but it was good. I was gonna get the classic alfajores but those are super sweet and you regret it in the end", "author": "Amy H."}

Onto the food, our first dish was the ceviche mixto. Solid. Nothing too special, but not bad either. Next we got a quarter chicken (you can choose white or dark meat) with tacu tacu and veggies on the side. It also comes with your choice of aji sauce but I forgot to pick one, but the one they gave us was phenomenal. The chicken and tacu tacu was delicious! The veggie side was such a great recommendation! 5 stars! The next dish was the braised beef which was really tasty and flavorful.

I really liked the other dinner courses, but this was the only dish of the four that I wouldn't want again.\n\n4) Quarter chicken (white meat) with rice/beans mash and green beans - very delicious chicken, perfectly cooked. just yum!

I'd suggest allotting 1/4 chicken per person to start and order other small plates because they have a tasty selection. \n\nEmpanadas! Beef, chicken, just make sure you get 'me. Each order comes with two and are about $8 an order, but they're sooooo good! Their Seco de Costillas, super tender braised short ribs, are mouth-watering!

I can eat that everyday and not get sick of it. \"I don't know about that!\"\n\nIndeed I ordered the quarter of a rotisserie chicken meal with a choice of two sides for $9.50.

This restaurant blazes a tasty bird and it shows by the juicy and moisture of the meat. The dipping sauces with my meal were good too and highly recommended with the chicken. By far, this is the best tasting bird to this date. The two sides I also got with my meal were rice and sweet potato fries. I have to have my starch with my meal.

The amount of alcohol was perfect - a little bite without being too strong.

It is a place I had always thought about going to but just never made it out. Never have I ever had Peruvian food, but boy am I happy that I did.\n\nI'll save you some reading time and sum up my overall experience like this: every time I picked up something new on the table and put it in my mouth it was basically like crack. If you've ever seen that one episode in Master of None (the one where they go to Nashville and get BBQ), and Aziz Ansari's character is like \"Mmm, this is really good\" *takes bite of another thing* \"MMM! This is really good too!!\" - that was basically me.\n\nTake away from the night: sangria is on point - very sweet, but not overbearing. Crispy chicken  (not the one they are famous for, but the other one) is BOMB AF. Get it. Yes, get it. Yuca fries are good too but what makes the dish extra worth is the flight of dipping sauces you can get with it. I was just dipping everything on the table into each one of those sauces. \n\nOn to the service. I really appreciate what the staff did this night considering the difficult circumstances. Our group had a reservation at 8:30 PM. We were hoping to be seated and start eating shortly after that. Unfortunately, the table that was assigned to be ours was occupied by another large group who had (according to the waitress) been there since 6PM. By the time 9PM swung around, the group was still there and refused to move. The staff at Limon tried their best to prompt the table to leave (bringing the check, cleaning the table, etc) but said that the group refused to. By 9:30, my group was getting a bit antsy as we had another event to attend by 10:30 and we still were crowded around the bar, waiting for our table we had reserved. Finally, when the other group did leave, the staff immediately turned our table around and brought the food out within minutes. They also offered us complimentary glasses of sangria and remained attentive throughout the night.

Although we held no reservation, we were seated immediately but were quick to learn why they asked us that at the door. This place was packed by the time we were placing our order. My fiance decided to go with the half chicken and 2 sides - tacu tacu and sweet potato fries. I decided to go with crispy ceviche from their special menu. \n\nOur waitress served us the 3 chicken dipping sauces and a bowl for the chicken bone immediately after she took our order. The half chicken and the side dishes came out first. The chicken was steaming hot - juicy and fall off the bone food. My fiance claimed the sweet potato fries were the best he had EVER had. I couldn't help but kept dipping them into the habanero sauce that came with the chicken - so crispy and good with an extra kick! The tacu tacu was a nice serving of mixed rice and beans.  It was well seasoned and the beans were cooked to mashed level - blended right in with the rice! \n\nMy crispy ceviche came out soon after. For the most part it was a dish made up of fish - there were prob 10 pieces of lightly battered, well seasoned , fell apart in beautiful layers white fish - very meaty, yet juicy, and light (not greasy at all despite being deep fried). The dipping sauce was citrusy and was the perfect balance to the crispy fish. The fish sat on top of a bed of yuca fries/onion strings/corn/fried red pepper - all were delicious. \n\nI managed to finish my own plate and polished my fiance's tacu tacu and sweet potato fries - so much to \"light\" dinner. Yet not a bit of guilt since the food was sooooo amazing and my crispy ceviche was not heavy at all. \n\nGreat service, great value for how much/how great the food was - if only we have something similar back in the city!

I wasn't a fan of the vegetable side because tasted like Chinese stir fry.  Funny that soy sauce is a common component.\n\nWe got the empanadas which I noticed went up in price by $1 to $8.95.  Pretty pricey for two small pieces.  I tried the beef empanada but didn't notice the raisins in it even though the menu stated that there were some inside.\n\nWe sat downstairs and the acoustics are LOUD.

The Peruvian\"paella\" definitely could have gone without, nothing special, We should've got lomo saltado in my opinion but the ladies at my table wanted the paella.  The empanada was good and the crust was flaky\nAnyways portions were small and aside from The leche \nDe tigre and the chicken i didn't see a lot of value, slightly sad that they had dishes that aren't really Peruvian dishes and they missed dishes such as papas a la huancaina.

We made reservations for a group of 12, and were seated when half of our party arrived. Initially I was very impressed due to the intimate ambiance. However, we weren't even given water as we waited 20-30 minutes for the rest of our group. We even asked the hostess but she just neglected our request. Service was mediocre. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Ceviche Mixto, Quarter Dark Meat Chicken, and Lomito Saltado. The ceviche was alright but I didn't think the seafood was fresh enough. The lomito saltado (basically steak and fries) were decent but unfortunately they drenched it in so much soy sauce that it was really salty. If this dish was seasoned better, I would have enjoyed it a lot more since the steak was actually juicy and tender. My favorite would have to be the quarter chicken because the skin was crispy and the meat wasn't dry at all. It really reminded me of rotisserie chicken that I had in Peru! A must order if you come here! \n\nI was really disappointed they didn't have Chicha Morada (my favorite purple corn drink from Peru), but I ordered a Mango Lemonade and that was surprisingly refreshing! Overall the food is pretty good but due to the service and some mess ups here and there I must give this place 3-3.5 stars.\n\n\nTIP #1: The chicken comes with two sides!! \n- We ordered yuca fries and tuca tuca. BOTH which we do not recommend. Try the papas fritas instead, you'll probably enjoy them a lot more!\n\nTIP #2: This restaurant is family-style serving, meaning they intend for everyone to share the food so dishes are laid out in the center.

Make sure that you do make a reservation. They also have a bar area if you want to wait there. Alright, let's get straight to the food:\n\nSours: marked as a Peruvia signature, so had to get that. If you prefer something much more sour, choose the Maracuya over the Pisco. Both incorporate egg whites for the frothiness. The sours actually didn't detract from the other flavors.\n\nChicken: we got half, since we wanted to try many of the other dishes. The chicken is moist w/ a nice braised skin. Get sides to eat w/ it. We did the camote frito (sweet potato fries) and the arroz (rice). The sweet potato fries were pretty standard. I wasn't expecting this, but the rice is stuck together. You don't really get much of that granular texture, which oddly worked with the chicken.\n\n\"Lomito\" saltado: haha, so when we ate this, we almost thought it was of Asian origins. There is soy sauce in there and it's really apparent. Fun fact, there is a substantial Chinese population in Peru to the point that a culinary style evolved from that fusion, known as Chifa. I really enjoyed this dish as the sirloin strips were really tender. Eat the fries fast before it starts soaking up much of the soy sauce, which may lead to a salty bite. Nevertheless, it's still not too salty. At a point, I found myself just eating the onions, since I really liked the sauce.\n\nChicharron de pollo: you would think I would be tired of chicken. This is marinated in soy sauce, which I didn't taste as much, but that may be because the flavors from the \"lomito\" just overwhelmed this dish relatively. The crispy chicken still maintained a soft interior. This dish added a nice change in texture, but I doubt I would get it again. It was alright compared to the other ones.\n\nSeco de costillas: this dish reminded me of the innards of a sandwich from Sanguch\u00f3n (a Peruvian food truck in SF), but this definitely was really good. That braised beef you could pick away with a fork. It just melts and falls apart nicely in your mouth.", "author": "James N."}

We ordered the pollipapas to start. Fantastic!  Next was the meal of half chicken with saut\u00e9ed veggies and tacu-tacu. That stuff was incredible. I'm not the least bit Hispanic so all this Peruvian cuisine was completely new for me, but there is no doubt in my mind we will be back.", "author": "Kim K."}

I had the camaron and fish ceviche, which was pretty good. I also had the rotisserie chicken, which I also enjoyed.

Can't remember when I had every dish so tasty and yumi. The meat was juicy and tender, and the fries with the sauce gives it a good touch. We also got tacu tacu in the side which I recommend. It's basically rice and beans. The ceviche was very tasty with a mix of all kinds of different flavors. The only downfall is there is parking. I'm glad we want early because we had to go around looking for parking for about 15 min.\nThe service was really good despite how busy they were. Our waiter constantly checked up on us and asked us how out dishes were. He was very attentive by refilling our drinks and water with out being asked.

It was super busy on a Friday night, and we waited a bit despite making reservations for our party of 7 at 8 o'clock.  Eventually, we were herded down to the basement area of the restaurant with another full bar where it was extremely loud.  The atmosphere was full of vibrance, party and laughter- definitely several decibels higher than the upstairs seating area.\n\nThey were so busy and seemed to need some help with the service.  So it was slow at times.  Several times, they came back to the table and forgot our drinks.  We were left with no water and nothing but heaps of empty dishes.  Until several of us turned our attention away from the table, they started hustling with the water, filling our drink orders finally and bussing dishes.  If it weren't for the friendly servers and the excellent food, I would have definitely dinged this place down another star.  The service could use improvement. \n\nWe ordered some soft, flavorful, juicy rotisserie chicken initially and ended up ordering more totalling a chicken and a half.  The ceviche was fresh with a bit of that sweet potato and big kernels of corn- very tart with the lime.  The yucca fries were just that- good and had some great dipping sauces to go with it including a nice cilantro chimichurri.  The Lomito Saltado was stir-fried juicy sirloin strips cooked to perfection with onions, tomato, soy sauce and a side of fries.  We got a version of this with just veggies too- also very good and full of rich flavors.  We also got empanadas.  I can't remember which one.  They were okay- better for dipping.  The truffle mac & cheese was to die for.  We ended up ordering 4 plates of that.  I think each person would have liked to have their own though!\n\nOverall, it was a fun, festive place to dine with a large party.  Don't expect impeccable service though.  Also, expect a loud party ambiance- probably not the best choice for a first date.  Yes, I'd definitely come back for the food.  Loud doesn't bother me!", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

I love the sauces, just smother everything in the sauces. I like the green one and the spicy one. \n\nWe got a side of yucca fries and the side of vegetables. I like the yucca fries, so crispy. Again, very good with the side of sauces (these are the sauces for the chicken but I used it for other things). I like the vegetables, it's tasty. However, it reminds me of how I make my stir-fry, so it's nothing special.\n\nI really like the cerviche, it's very lemon-y. It's good with the green sauce (that comes with the chicken) as well.

My friend and I had to shout across the table, leaning in to hear each other in the noise. \n\nThe food itself was fine, nothing special. We had the signature roast chicken, veggies, and yuca fries. The chicken was honestly a bit soggy, like it had been cooked a little too long. The seasoning was better than a Whole Foods chicken, but the execution wasn't... and that should tell you something. Our drinks were good (pisco sour and the \"Sneaky Limon\"), but they took a long time to come.

There's a small area inside the door next to the host's station, so I often feel in the way while I wait for the host's attention. The good side effect of that is the host is usually pretty quick to move people through that crowded area and get them to their seats. \n\nDespite the entryway's diminutive size, the restaurant is larger than it appears-- they have both a street-level bar/kitchen/dining area, and a larger basement bar/dining room. The basement isn't as awful as you'd think a room without windows might be-- dark, yes, but decorated nicely-- but it can feel lonely (or private, depending how you look at it) if you're arriving on the early or super-late end of dinner service. It seems they try to put larger-party (5+) reservations and walk-ins downstairs, and smaller-party reservations only on the main floor.\n\nAs for the menu, they recently updated some items which make their \"Limon specials\" pretty reasonable: the tuna is served in two shareable steaks, and the ribeye beef used to be a few strips of meat in a tapas-sized plate, but is now a full steak entree that I find decently portioned to share (along with another small plate to share if you're really hungry, as I was).\n\nI'm partial to any of the ceviches, but I do wish they came with the taro chips that accompany the tuna tartare.

My wife is Peruvian so when we have a chance we like to try out new places when we travel. \n\nLimon is located on a corner in the Mission district but parking is a challenge.  We managed to find a parking spot a couple blocks away however we encountered several homeless people pan handling along the way and the stench of urine was not a good way to set off the experience, We noticed San Francisco seems to have an abundant supply of homeless people at least compared to Seattle. \n\n We came in and were seated very quickly even during what I would consider a peak lunch time. The place tries to be uptown swanky but has a bit of a sports bar vibe to it with the TVs which had soccer on. Given their name I suspect their specialty is the chicken,but my wife was set on Ceviche Mixto and Jalea which were priced about $14 each.  The idea was that we'd share both and that should be enough to suffice.......boy we ere wrong.\n\nMy wife went to the restroom during which time the waiter brought the Ceviche.  When my wife came back and saw the little plate, she commented on how small the serving was compared to other places we've eaten. Indeed it was more of an appetizer than a full course.  The taste was good, but we were very disappointed with size for the price.\n\nWe should have known the same would be true of the Jalea for it arrived on a small plate as well and is usually about 1/3 the size you'd find at other places.  About half way through my wife asked for Aji sauce which is pretty much a staple at all Peruvian places. Although each place seems to have it's own recipe its usually jalepeno peppers with Mayo or Aji oil and cilantro, regardless its usually delicious. \n\nThe waiter said they didn't even have the green sauce.  I though what self respecting Peruvian restaurant doesn't carry this sauce? Evidently Limon.  After a long period of time chatting with the chef  and when we had all but finished  the \"overwhelming\" portion of Jalea, the waiter does bring out an orange Aji sauce. Something finish are last 2 pieces of the Jalea I guess.  \n\nAfter noticing we had finished the jalea the waiter quickly came over cleared the dishes and asked if we wanted dessert. To which I said no, and no sooner said he dropped the bill on the table.  I went to reach for the bill and a busboy came over and began to wipe down the table.  I felt like we were being rushed out the door although I don't know why because it wasn't busy at all.  \n\nI looked at the bill and noticed we had been charged an extra $1.50 for the sauce (unheard of at  most places) that we didn't even get to use.   So for a total of $34 we had 2 appetizers and an unused sauce.    \n\nSo based on portion size, price and lack of service this is not a Peruvian restaurant I'd recommend at all.  To those who give it such high ratings.....you need to get out more and try better Peruvian food.  I've had better in a food truck and gotten better service as well.", "author": "Charles M."}

Fresh tasting and not soggy/oily!\n\nThe individual dishes we got were good too. I can't say too much about the dish my brother's friend had, but I felt like the presentation and overall dish was not what was expected.

It was the perfect meal & start to my vacation. According to Salah, Limon is known for their popular Polla ala Brasa (a juicy rotisserie chicken that's served with their 3 Aji dipping sauces). Seems as though every single table had ordered this dish! \n\nPolla ala Brasa is served with a choice of 2 sides:\nWhole chicken: $18.95\nHalf chicken: $9.95\n1/4 chicken: $8.25\n*they cut the chicken into smaller pieces for you*\n\nLimon accompanies most of their dishes w/the same 3 Aji sauces. I used all 3 for my yuca/yucca fries and fried chicken.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=VTUKptxa4SLtmntOI5SjdQ\n\n1) Aji Amarillo (garlic, yellow amarillo chili & queso fresco cheese): My favorite of the 3! The thicker consistency was perfect for dipping. There was a hint of turmeric in the mix, reminded me of a sweet curry sauce w/a kick. YUM!\n\n2) Rocoto sauce (a citrusy-vinegary sauce made of red chilies, garlic & lemon). When i think Rocoto, I think spicy. But this sauce was rather sweet and garlicky without the kick.\n\n3) Chimichurri (parsley, shallots, olive oil, garlic, salt & vinegar). Didn't have a lot of vinegar, so it wasn't as acidic as I'd hoped for. But I did appreciate the nice amount of saltiness that you get when the sauce was stirred well (which a lot of past chimichurri sauces lacked).\n\nI wanted to try different things and so we decided to skip on the rotisserie chicken (I got the fried chicken instead.....you all know how much I LOVE my fried foods! lol!). \n\nCHICHARRON DE POLLO ($8.50):\nServed with salsa criolla (tomato-onion salsa) and a lemony oil, but i used the Aji Amarillo sauce with this chicken dish.\n\nReminds me a lot of mochiko chicken: crunchy, juicy and delicious! The chicken is marinated in a soy-chili sauce and fried to perfection (i liked that some pieces were extra crispy!). Such a simple dish, but so tasty! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=tTYqe25hAg_VuIsbpfYHog\n\nCEVICHE MIXTA ($9.75): \nProbably the freshest-tasting ceviche I've had in a long time. Limon uses leche de tigre (\"Tiger's Milk\") as a base for all of their ceviche dishes. It's a  peruvian citrus-based liquid (lemon juice, salt, herbs and chili) that's been marinating/mixed with the juices extracted from the raw seafood.\n\nEverything tasted fresh and delicious. Fresh red snapper, tiger prawns and tender calamari in an acidic-tangy sauce - amazing! I loved the white hominy/corn that accompanied the dish, it was a nice balance of texture and adds a nice sweetness to the overall dish.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=gbhM9Xws1qU-beyWcaOjRA\n\nLOMITO SALTADO ($9.75):\nI'm in LOVE!!! \nTender, perfectly cooked strips of sirloin, tomatoes, onions and FRENCH FRIES cooked in a tasty shoyu-based sauce. I wanted more of this dish, more beef would've been nice. Too much onions!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=45QQpUPXMbkPzGi0ZmKj5A\n\nYUCA/YUCCA FRIES ($3):\nLeast favorite dish of the night. I've always liked cassava fries and chips (starchy veggie similar to potatoes and yams). But these were cut too thick. It was like biting into paste. Perhaps if it was fried longer, it would've been more crunchy and easier to swallow. The gooey texture wouldn't have been so off-putting either.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=bDQhwRVhSKTel0iDP8mteg\n\nSANGRIA ($6 glass, $25 pitcher):\nNot big on sangrias but Limon makes a helluva mean sangria. You could just tell how delicious it was going to taste before it even touches your lips. It's not musty-smelling or overpowering like most sangrias I've had, it had the right balance of tang & sweetness. The fresh, colorful diced fruits were also very pleasing to the eye. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=aZGPtzk_5azwL2Y23yrtfg\n\nOverall service was awesome (despite the packed upstairs & downstairs dining areas).

The atmosphere at this restaurant is lively and upbeat. \n\nDue to the high volume of customers, it took a while for our waiter to make his way to our table. We were wondering if they had forgotten about us, but it wasn't a deal-breaker since the food comes out rather quickly. \n\nFor a table of four, we ordered:\n1. One pitcher of red sangria - This served about 8 - 10 glasses. The sangria was tasty (not too sweet and doesn't taste like straight-up wine)!\n2. Two whole chickens - The chicken met my expectations. I usually frequent smaller and more casual Peruvian chicken locations where I get more of an authentic feel. This chicken was on the same level of taste, if \"classed up\" a bit. \n3. Four sides (which come with the chicken- 2 sides per chicken) - We selected 2 orders of tacu-tacu (favorite side - addicting), yuca fries (on point), and sweet potato fries (typical sweet potato fries). \n4. Ceviche Mixto - This was very satisfying because I love ceviche! I wasn't a big fan of the corn, nuts, and random sweet potato paste. However, the dish had enough acidity without being too overbearing. Overall, would recommend!\n\nThis amount of food was just what we needed (maybe even bordering 'too much')!\n\nI really enjoyed the experience!

We left full, but not stuffed.\nWe called ahead because we were running about 20 minutes late for our reservation, but they held the table for us, which was awesome.\n\nCons: Service is just okay, bordering on a little slow. Street parking can be tough on the weekends, but that's to be expected in the city- just give yourself a little extra time.\n\nI love Peruvian food, and this place was as good (or better) as most of the others I've been to- I would definitely go back to Limon.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

I can already forsee myself coming back!\n\nThe chicken is incredibly succulent, to the point that I am sure they use an artificial tenderizer. But who cares, when the chicken tastes THAT good?? The sauces were good, ESP the extra spicy one (boy, was that HOT!), but I've definitely had better aji sauces. \n\nOther highlights included the rice & beans and sweet potato fries. I'd get both of those next time for sure. The crispy chicken was just okay, and the regular fries were disappointing.", "author": "Asmita J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-19", "description": "For a rotisserie slash bar and tapas place, their chicken was by far the least enjoyable thing I've had out of everything, and I've also had the worst plate I've ever eaten at a higher end joint, explaining the score.\n\nFirst, the sangria. This was the MOST alcoholic tasting sangria, which is actually awesome because \"you get your money's worth\" - but literally, I didn't taste sangria and just tasted alcohol. I do wish it was any sweet at all, or maybe I had a bad glass; at least it helped me swallow some of the food here, honestly. It was hard to eat the fruits included, which I usually like doing, because there was not much apple, just mostly lemon and orange skins, and the cuts were small.\n\nThe free-range rotisserie chicken, or pollo a la brasa, comes with two sauces as of current, which are the aji amarillo mustard and the aji amarillo huacatay (they both honestly tasted the same, except the mustard one was stronger than the other); I saw pictures that they used to include chimichurri too, which is one of my favorite sauces in the world, so I am severely disappointed that they reduced the sauces given, even if you order the whole chicken. The least they could do was add the extra sauce for the whole chicken, since you get the same amount of sauce no matter if you ordered a quarter of one vs a whole. The price points are $12 ($11 for dark meat), $17, and then $25 for the quarter, half, and whole chicken, making it seem extremely worth it to get it whole, but TRUST me, you will not want the whole. I think it'd suffice to just get the quarter chicken to try it, realize that it just tastes like pretty good chicken (and hope you don't get a dry part), eat the yummy sides and sauces, and then move on. It definitely felt like I just paid an extra $13 to take home a few dry pieces of chicken, hooray. I would have rather spent that on trying another one of their small plates. The sides I ordered were yuca fries and tacu tacu, which basically are humongous starchy fries, and spanish rice mashed with beans (garnished with the slices of raw onions indicative of Peruvian cuisine) - surprisingly very good and flavorful on their own. Anyways, I digressed; the chicken was tasty, yes, and the skin was crispy and nice, yes, but there were also large dry parts - namely, the breast, which reeeeally cannot be in the same universe, in its $25 whole chicken form, to a $5 moist Costco whole rotisserie chicken, yo.\n\nThe ceviche mixto was extremely good, beautiful, and very fresh and delicate. It is garnished with a good amount of thin raw onion slices, a generous amount of big Peruvian corn, and had a spoonful of sweet potato paste which was interesting. From looking at pictures and from knowing how ceviches are normally served, I was missing roasted corn nuts, or cancho. Where were my cancho?! I feel extremely robbed because that's a lovely part of ceviche, and they either forgot it with mine or stopped including it.\n\nThe lengua a la parilla was fantastic (garnished again with the raw onions)! If you've been afraid to try beef tongue, I think this would be a good gateway as it almost tasted like steak to me, except it did have that sort of ground, grassy beef tongue texture and taste, but very subtle. The aji panca sauce was amazing, and the baby yukon mashed potatoes were delicious and buttery.\n\nNow, for the dish that made me withdraw a complete star, maybe even star and a half... the chicharron de pollo! It is supposed to be crispy marinated chicken, but it tasted nothing of the sort. What I got was extremely overcooked or overfried, dry, tasteless, very hard to swallow pieces of chicken garbage, and I do not say that lightly. This is by far the WORST thing I have ever eaten at a high end food place. Never get it, take it off the menu, oh God why. I'm used to eating quite crispy and juicy chicharron, which is why I thought this would be good. The salsa criolla doesn't even save it, which is the wet sauce they include that basically tastes like some savory balsamic vinegar water.\n\nInconsistent food, I'd say. It was so surprising that there can be such amazing dishes here, but also some bad chicken. I'm also very disappointed about my missing cancho. From the pictures, it looks like they've made a lot of sad adjustments to the food in the form of cutbacks; I saw that tomato slices used to be included with the raw onions, but no longer... and other things. The neighborhood is ghetto, and the inside is pretty small and cozy - great place to watch a game and eat. I would mainly go here for the ceviche, small plates, and perhaps try a special. If you eat anything but the chicken, you will probably be satisfied.", "author": "Amy Y."}

It was an easy decision based on the raving reviews by fellow Yelp friends.  We were lucky and were able to reserve a table on a Friday; I would recommend making reservations for weekend dinning.  The exceptional service started on the phone when I was placing my reservation.  They were able to accommodate us on short notice, and were very appreciative of our business before we even stepped foot into the restaurant.  Our waiter, Freddy, was equally competent and provided us with his preferences, which turned out to be perfect. \n\nThe food was exquisite and memorably authentic, from the drink (Cactus Fruit Sour) to the main course and dessert.  We started with the Ceviche Mixto, which was a mix of shrimp, calamari and fish.  This dish was very fresh and perfectly seasoned with lime and pepper.  We shared the Pollo A Las Brasa (fire roasted chicken) with Vegetables Salteados (grilled greens) and Papas Fritas (french fries).  The chicken was super moist with the skin delightedly seasoned and crisp.  The grilled vegetables had a smoky flavor and the red peppers provided a rich flavor.   We tried the braised beef tongue in a tomato/red pepper based sauce, which was one of my favorites.  The meat was very tender.  My least favorite was the Chicharron De Pollo (crispy chicken), which didn't have the crispness as we expected.  We fished off with Panna Cotta De Mango (mango jelly on top of sweetened cooked cream) for dessert, by far the best I have ever head.  It was super smooth, creamy and had a sumptuous mango flavor.\n\nI would definitely dine here again, for the service, the food and the ambiance of a cozy small restaurant.", "author": "Adam D."}

I knew nothing about the city so I turned to Yelp for help, and it certainly came to my rescue. Limon Rotisserie is the first Peruvian place I've tried and one of the first places I ate out at in San Francisco, and it set the bar pretty high.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is quite small, not a ton of seating area, but I like the quaint feel to it. Makes for a cute casual date night!\n\nDrinks:\nWe both ordered pisco's to start off our meal - she got the regular pisco sour and I got the lychee sour (staying true to my Asian roots). I personally really liked my drink! It was just the right mix of sweet and sour and it complemented my meal quite well. I don't think my intern coach was as thrilled about hers though.\n\nFood:\nYUMSSS to everything. The great thing about coming to a tapas place is that you can try a little bit of everything - a great feature for really indecisive people like myself. \n\nFor cold plates, we got the ceviche de pescado and ensalada rusa. Both were sooo good! I'm usually not a fan of ceviche, but man oh man, I'm salivating at the thought of the ceviche de pescado. The red snapper fish was so fresh and the whole dish just comes together. The ensalada rusa, while not the leafy salad we were expecting, was a pleasant root-based salad that balanced out the citrusiness of the ceviche. I've grown quite fond of beets lately so I really liked this dish.\n\nFor hot plates, we got the half chicken (a must since it has it's own section on the menu) and lomito saltado. The chicken was delicious - juicy and tender, though not insanely mind blowing. The sirloin strips though, drooool. They were cooked so well and kept me coming back for more.

I definitely recommend just ordering a whole chicken to go. great for two people\n\ndo not order the pisco sour. it was gross. other than that, i suggest whole chicken because the portions are a bit on the smaller side.\n\nEDIT: Yes the Pisco Sour was not that good. Some background on that: too many egg whites were used, and always ask for the Pisco Porton version. I was unfortunate enough to get the hami-something one. Last, there was way too much simple syrup used in the Pisco sour. What separates a good Pisco Sour from a bad Pisco Sour is....yes, the latter part of the iconic drink's name. Most likely, Limon cheaped out and just added basic-ass sweet and sour mix instead of full lemon/lime juice. It shouldn't have been that sweet! Truly, you guys do your fantastic rotisserie chicken and lomito salteado injustice with offering a Pisco Sour national cocktail of this quality. Boo. \n\nBut seriously, the food is good.

While I don't eat meat very much, when I do, I head here or Sol Food in Marin for some really great chicken!! It had been about 7-8 month since my last visit. I have to say I was in shock. I am not sure if management has changed or they are going in a new direction with their brand as a whole. The portions are smaller and pricier. The service was terrible. I typically would order a whole chicken, two sides and be good. That was ample food for 2 ppl with some leftovers to take home. This visit the chicken came out not on a plate but on steel trays which are usually reserved for back of the house kitchen prep. The side portions, which used to come in their own  serving bowls as actual side portions came on each side of the tray the chicken was in. It literally was just over a tablespoon of each side. Then to top it off, those yummy sauces, which lets be honest is the reason we all come here to dunk the chicken in was now $2-$3 extra per sauce. \nIt was ridiculous. I get that SF prices are already absurd and costs may be going up, but to nickel and dime your patrons is just bad business practice. Throw some higher priced entrees on the menu then but leave the staples of your menu alone. I will never come back here again. So many options for great chicken here in SF.

I asked for her to stay away from my table yet she dared to come back and disrespected my mother by snatching an inka kola can from her hand. She was asked again to stay away from our table. Jason very politely apologized on their behalf and even offered dessert on the house. If I ever come back it will be because of Jason. I like to give second chances.

The only reason I ate all the food was because I was in dire need of sustenance. The chicken was their specialty, but it wasn't worth the wait. The seasoning was great, but it was only apparent in the skin. The steak and fries were good, but the beef was a little chewy. The yucca fries were a little mushier than I expected, but I've never had yucca fries so perhaps that's how they're supposed to be. The sweet potato fries weren't anything special and neither were the rice & beans.\n\nThe 2 stars go toward the food and the service - the servers were friendly and efficient. Minus 3 stars for the wait, the atmosphere of the place, and for the type of dining patrons it attracts (hipsters...cough cough). You would think that at a place where the line is out the door, diners would be a bit more considerate about taking their sweet time eating (again, selfish hipsters). I death-stared a couple of tables because they had finished their meals, but continued chatting while the rest of us practically dry-humped each other while waiting to be seated. I literally straddled a guy's leg while he was eating because I need to make room for people to exit the restaurant (yes, there was only one way in...). \n\nThe only reason I stayed? Because I had already wasted 2 hours of my life. I wasn't about to leave w/out trying out the food - it's the only reason I was there in the first place. Even if you have a reservation, you will need to wait. The food isn't bad, but it's not worth more than a 10-15 min. wait in my opinion. Take your precious minutes (or in my case, hours) some place else where the hosts/hostesses are friendlier and rubbing up against strangers isn't inevitable (unless you're into that stuff...). Also, do not go in groups larger than 2 - apparently, they lack the competency necessary to arrange tables to accommodate bigger parties...trust me, I was in a group of 3.", "author": "Jenny W."}

Good balance of seasoning, so it wasn't bland or overly salty. \n\nThe fish and shrimp ceviche was recommended by our server, and it was a good recommendation. All their ceviches are tossed in the same sauce, which was lime-y/lemony and really good. \n\nFor the three dishes (which we weren't able to completely finish) plus corkage fee, our bill came out to be below $50, not including tip.

We waited 35 mins for a table for 3. We split a whole chicken + 2 sides and a ceviche amongst ourselves and it was the perfect amount. The ceviche was great (and very citrus-y), and included bits of 2 types of corn (possibly hominy?) that added an additional latin flare (sin maiz, no hay pais, after all). For our sides, we got the yuca fries and salted vegetables, which were simple dishes executed well. The chicken was great, but I was a bit disappointed it didn't have any particularly new or interesting flavors (full disclosure: I was expecting a strong citrus flavor, given the restaurant's name). Finally, the chicha morada's sweetness served as a perfect flavor offset to the ceviche. I'd like to return to try their empanadas, specials, and sangria.

It ain't necessarily easily accessible via public transit from the touristy areas, but sometimes we need to make a journey for good things in life. Limon Rotisserie certainly offers some tasty bites, good service, and reasonable prices.\n\nWhile the thought of Peruvian food didn't exactly excite me at first thought, I certainly am open to the idea after dining at Limon. The rotisserie chicken is certainly very flavorful and is taken up a notch with the separate sauces that are served up. Whether it was the chimichurri, rocotto, or the aji amaraillo, the flavors certainly complement the herbs and seasonings that bathe the chicken. The steak was certainly flavorful, but a tad overcooked for my liking which ended up making it rather chewy. \n\nDon't skimp on the sides, the mac and cheese was quite good, the sweet potato fries still moist yet crispy, the chicharrons bites of heaven, and the vegetables cooked well, but not memorable. However, you have to say you had some veggies right? Or else your mom might not let you eat here again...\n\nService was good with the staff being incredibly helpful with the menu and quick to clear dirty plates and fill empty glasses.

We ordered 1 small cold plate, 1 small hot plate, and a quarter chicken (which comes with two sides). We then went to Mitchell's for dessert so this may not be enough food to make a party of two completely full. \n\nThis isn't the best Peruvian I've ever had, but it satisfied a long-standing craving that I've had for it. :) I definitely want to come back to try their lomo saltado.\n\nAlso, they don't list their prices online so I can't list prices below, but I'll post what prices I vaguely remember. \n\nCeviche Mixto ($8?) - This is definitely recommended. Succulent pieces of raw fish, calamari, and tiger shrimp marinated in a refreshing citrus sauce. It's also served with corn and sweet potato. Very tasty and fresh!\n\nAji de Gallina ($9?) - Chicken in a creamy aji amarillo, peanut, and cheese sauce. Aji amarillo is a yellow chili pepper that Peruvians use in their freaking amazing dipping sauces. This dish was oookay. I thought it was a little bit too mild, but if you haven't had it before, it's worth trying! This is normally one of my favorite dishes at Peruvian restaurants. \n\n1/4 Chicken - Pollo a la Brasa ($10?) - The rotisserie chicken is very good. It's definitely the reason why this place is so popular. It also comes with your choice of two sides (hooray!). We had the yucca fries (4 fat cut yucca fries) which were INSANELY tasty. Haha. I was not expecting such perfectly crispy and yummy fries. The tacu tacu side is also highly recommended. It's mashed beans and rice and it's quite flavorful. The sides almost stole the show :). The dipping sauces that came with the chicken were kind of forgettable. Two of them were aji and chimichurri. I couldn't figure out what the third sauce was.

There was a table of 7 of us, and even though they had made a reservation we had to wait a little bit for our table downstairs.\n\nThe food arrived extremely quickly (shocking considering the restaurant was packed)- first up, the empanadas (veggie and pollo. Both delicious) and the ceviche mixto- fish, calamri, and tiger shrimp. My girl friend pointed out the \"special sauces\" on the table and advised me to use them at all times. So, I did. Each of the three were delicious and accompanied the ceviche quite well.\n\nNext came the tuna tartare, the rotisserie chicken, and the sweet potato fries. Amazing! These dishes were by far the highlights of our dining experience. I now see why Lim\u00f3n is known for their rotisserie chicken. The tun tartare was also amazing.\n\nWe had another chicken and beef dish floating around the table... the chicharron de pollo and the carne a la parrilla.

One thing that was little odd was that they didn't have ketchup to go along with the fries. When we asked for it, the waiter gave us a puzzled look like we were asking for something crazy! The empanada was filled with ground chicken and had a subtle flavor with a little kick.

The spices were so flavorful and the chicken was so moist, yet the skin was crispy. It's definitely a no-brainer that the chicken is a must-have when dining here. \n\nThe side dishes were superb as well! The tacu-tacu, which is a combo of beans and rice was cooked really nicely. It wasn't overly mushy, but just right. The yucca fries were nice and crisp...so perfectly fried that I could've ate them all! The veggies were deliciously seasoned. The complimentary sauces went well with all the sides and the chicken. Duh!\n\nOverall, I had a great first-time experience here and would definitely come back without a doubt. The food exceeded my expectations. The service was good. Our waiter always made sure to ask if we were doing ok and another waiter would fill our water without us having to ask. \n\nFor a grand total of $25 before tip for two, you just can't beat that! I highly suggest making a reservation because there were quite a few people waiting outside and they get busy so quickly. Parking can be difficult as we circled the block 3 times before we found a space 6 cars from the doorway. So, definitely make enough time for the parking situation.", "author": "Fallon P."}

They get busy and the wait can be long. The wait here at the S. Van Ness location is not as crazy as Valencia, but I still highly recommend a reservation. You're warned now.\n\nWe came here for a quick dinner because we crave the rotisserie chicken. For half a chicken, you get both dark and white meat. All portions come with two sides, and we had the fries and mixed vegetables. They were rather mediocre. Fries were not crunchy and the vegetables not memorable. The well-seasoned and tasty chicken is the highlight.\n\nI always eat my chicken with the flavored arroz.\n\nLomito Saltado is a Peruvian dish that has Asian influences onsisting of strips of sirloin marinated in vinegar, soy sauce and spices, then stir fried with red onions and tomatoes.  It's served on fries here so the fries are soggy. It's always a favorite but last night's was a bit salty.\n\nService was friendly but a bit rushed. They plopped down your food almost immediately after you ordered, and check is delivered before you even finish your drink. Overall it's good meal, the rotisserie chicken alone is worth four stars.", "author": "Matt Y."}

The restaurant is tiny so we had no choice but to wait outside for an hour.  Thankfully, we were having odd warm November weather.  The hostess was also very apologetic for the inconvenience and offered to speak with the manager about comping us for some drinks.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, we all ordered the $32 prix fixe menu, which provided us with more food than we needed.  Luckily we had some human garbage disposals that came in handy.  The food was very good and everyone was very satisfied.  There was ceviche, fried chicken skin, beet salad, rotisserie chicken, and fries.  I might be missing a dish or two.\n\nAfter the birthday candles were blown out, the bill came, and we found out that none of our pitchers of sangria were actually comped so we had to talk to the manager about it, who ended up coming 2 of 6 of the pitchers.  Not bad I guess but an hour wait for 17 people deserve more than that, IMO.

Downstairs seemed more spacious when compared to upstairs.\n\nWe shared the following food:\nCeviche Mixto - This had came with fish, calamari, and tiger shrimp. I think the portions could've been a bit bigger because after one bite from each, the dish was already gone into our stomachs.\n\nPollo A La Brasa (Half Chicken) - The chicken came with two different sides. I can't remember what two sides we ordered, but I think we should've ordered the whole chicken instead because I think the guys were still hungry. However, the chicken was really juicy and they give you different kinds of sauce to dip it in! \n\nLomito Saltado - Stir-fried sirloin strips. SO DELICIOUS. Very tender and juicy. \n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese - I thought this was pretty good; however, I don't think it was TOO amazing.

We even ordered an additional helping of the empanadas.\n\nHowever, I really can't hide my disappointment with the Rotisserie Chicken.  It wasn't bland, it was just a little dry and had an alarming amount of dry rub that had an overpowering salty flavor.  This is one of the few times I'm not agreeing with Big Eat SF (7 x 7, #37).

We ended up sharing:\n\n* Lomito Saltado ($10.95) - An alright dish with good flavors and a bit of tang, my main qualms were with the fries: I felt like this dish would have been significantly better if it had been made with the more traditional, crispy thick-cut wedge fries.\n\n* Chicharron de Pollo ($8.95) - Great flavors and just the right bit of crispiness, but a bit on the dry side. Served up with a dipping sauce though, which helped offset the dryness.\n\n* Papas Fritas ($3.95) - Quite tasty, with great flavors - I think it would have been even better with thick-cut fries, but these were enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n* Tacu Tacu ($3.95) - We never quite figured out what this was, and just decided to order it based off Yelp suggestions. My guess is that they're (foot)balls of Spanish rice that have been pan-fried a bit (a la yaki onigiri). Not bad, but not amazing either.\n\n* Profiteroles ($7.25) - Four cream puffs served up with some sauces and nuts, and, while I've had better, these were quite tasty.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A large, spacious restaurant, accessibility shouldn't be an issue.

Had a reservation for 6:00 pm on a Tuesday night set up for a dinner date for two. We arrived around 5 minutes before that and were seated promptly. At that time, it had yet to get busy but as we were being served we noticed plenty of more people showing up afterwards, all with reservations. So first rule for this restaurant, make a reservation! \n\nOur waitress was very nice and she spoke Spanish! We ordered some Sangria for drinks which were awesome and good and to start had Leche de Tigres (For non-spanish folks, yes, that is Tigers milk). It was delicious as it was a blend of limes, shrimp, onion, squid/calamari (another seafood), and two chips to top it off. Did I mention it has a spicy side to it? Be prepared and order yourself some water in case you are a hot sauce lightweight! \n\nWe went on to try several foods on the menu. We got half a chicken with an order of Tacu Tacu and Yuca Fries. The chicken had a good taste to it with the seasoning it had and we were provided with 3 different dipping sauces to experiment with our taste buds. Next the tacu tacu was spectacular, which is a blend of refried beans mixed with rice. Lastly the yuca fries aren't exactly fries, but resemble spring roles, yet not as deep fried. They are essentially a sweet potato type of dish and come with 4 pieces for each order. \n\nNow onto my two favorite plates. Chicharron de pollo was the bomb. It's crispy chicken marinated in soy sauce garlic and another spice and served with a sauce for you to dip. It was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. Next was the Carne a la Parrilla, which was piece of steak served over Tacu Tacu and had a sweetish beef sauce drizzled on top of it. All worth ordering and trying. By this point, we were full and our stomachs full to the max. But how could we not get dessert?\n\nYour choice for desert is easily the Chocolate Bandido (Chocolate Bandit!). A cookie on top, chocolate cake on the bottom, chocolate and vanilla cream! Hits the spot! \n\nOverall it was a great experience. Everyone was friendly, our server was excellent and the drinks and food were amazing. Also everything is well priced, so is expect when you come try it out to order a variety of plates because that way you will be satisfied and have tasted a bit of everything!

THUMBS UP!\n\nI actually ended up coming here consecutively for two days due to the fact that we had a company holiday outing here and then a friend's birthday dinner the next day. I typically don't like eating the same things in such short gap, but I was actually okay with going to Limon 2 days in a row. \n\nThe place itself had 2 floors, making it a great place for bigger outings or birthday dinners, and reservations are recommended. The service here was great both days, as the servers were extremely friendly and went out of their way to make things happen for us. \n\nWhat we ordered (ranked from most to least favorite)\n\n1) Truffle Mac & Cheese: Lim\u00f3n's signature creamy truffle infused macaroni & cheese\n2) Lomito Saltado: A traditional Peruvian dish of stir-fried sirloin strips, onions, tomato, soy sauce, & french fries\n3) Pollo a la Brasa: Lim\u00f3n's famous marinated free-range rotisserie chicken is slowly roasted over open flame. All portions come with 2 sides of your choice and \"Aji\" sauces\n4) Ceviche Mixto: Fish, calamari & tiger shrimp\n5) Yuca Fries (select this as a side with the Pollo a la Brasa)\n6) Seco de Costillas: Braised boneless beef short ribs with huacatay-cilantro broth, potatoes, carrots, English peas\n7) Carne Empanada: Hand-cut top sirloin, sauteed onions, hard boiled eggs, olives & raisins\n8) Arroz con Mariscos: Peruvian style paella made with saffron rice, mixture of seafood, aji amarillo pimento sauce\n9) Lengua a la Parilla: Marinated & grilled beef tongue, baby yukon mashed potatoes, Aji Panca sauce\n\nThe Truffle Mac & Cheese here is one of the best truffle infused dishes that I've ever tasted, and the Lomito Saltado and Pollo a la Brasa were delicious, but the meat tenderness was inconsistent in the two days I was here. The beef in Lomito Saltado tends to be a little tough, while the chicken was a little more dry on the second day of my visit. Everything ranked #6 and below on my list was a little too salty for my taste, and a little disappointing. However, you can definitely order more sides to level out the saltiness such as rice & beans, or vegetables. \n\nAs for beverages, for non-alcoholic drinkers, I highly recommend the mango lemonade. Its different and delicious, and the best part is, it has 100% of Vitamin C!\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that hasn't been here before! Great vibe, service, menu, and price tag! Although this is not yet on par with Mario Peruvian's in LA, it is a great substitute for now!\n\nNote: Street parking was extremely hard to find around here, so be prepared!", "author": "Luby H."}

It comes with lime juice and I absolutely loved it. I really love raw fish in general! But the lime juice made it really refreshing to start off my meal.\n\nTARTARA DE TUNA: This is basically tuna tartare. It comes with a few slices of cucumber, some chips, and the tuna of course! It was really salty so I didn't enjoy it as much.\n\nPOLLO EMPANADA: Yummmm. Crispy on the outside, chicken on the inside! But the flavoring of the beef one was better.\n\nCARNE EMPANADA: Get it! \n\nPOLLO A LA BRAZA: Such juicy chicken with tasty skin. They also give you 3 kinds of sauces so you can dip your chicken in whatever you want! We ordered two halves so that you get extra sides. I like the yuca fries and vegetables a lot. \n\nLOMITO SALTADO: It has sirloin strips and fries together. Although the taste is salty, the sirloin strips were slightly too chewy and the fries were definitely too oily. We didn't even finish it. \n\nMANGO PANNA COTTA: I was in dessert heaven! We probably would have licked the plate if we could! The panna cotta was so creamy and just the perfect amount of sweetness. You also get some pineapple with it. Yum! \n\nSANGRIA: I love sangria from most places and this place has some good sangria too. Cheers! \n\nMARUCAYA SOUR:  This one has pisco, passion fruit, lime, and a little bit of egg white. Its presentation isn't very special but it is definitely yummy because it's fruity and sweet. \n\nPA BRAVO YO: Pisco, orange, passion fruit, fresh diced strawberries, and some soda water. It looked really pretty, especially with the fresh strawberries in there but it was slightly too strong.\n\n\nAs for the service, it varies. When I sat on the bottom floor, they were checking on us so many times that I wish they would leave us alone so we can just talk uninterrupted.

The alarm bells start sounding at around the 10 minute mark.\n\nDesert in general is a hard sell. I guess it depends on how often you eat out; we eat out enough for desert typically to never be an option. Two reasons. One, it makes the meal a little bit more expensive; tacks on anywhere between 6-16 extra bucks. Two, time. Who's got the time for desert? That's at least another half hour; I hope I did something fun last weekend cause I'm runnin out of things to talk about; this desert better be good, is all I'm thinking.\n\nIt's too hard. All that momentum from a great dinner, rolling right into a what you know is going to be a great dulche l de leche, but bam! Ground to a halt; this is taking too long. I can't have a long gap between a great meal and a desert otherwise I start regretting my decisions. The longer the wait, the more likely Imma flag down the waiter and say hey buddy cancel it. \n\nAt about minute 15 the waiter came by to tell us there was a mixup with the desert order. Fuckin a. Seriously dang. I can't say anything because ultimately dining to me is performance art; I don't want to interrupt the show but dang, this third act is killing me. \n\nWe ended up waiting about 20 minutes for desert. I wanna say it was worth it but the cost/benefit time-is-money calculator in my head just won't let me. I mean if I told you a desert was gonna take 3 hours to make you'd prolly be thinking well shit either this is the best desert of all time or I'm about to waste three hours; it's hard to imagine when the latter wouldn't be the case. \n\nThe Mango desert was very good as was the dulce de leche things.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-12", "description": "Some times the best experiences in life come from the unexpected. Sandy and I were frolicking in the city this past weekend when we suddenly became hungry during dead hour (In case you don't know what that means, it's those few hours between lunch and dinner rush). We checked nearby restaurants and Sandy suggested Limon Rotisserie after reading the reviews. I have to admit, she's been on a roll picking places to eat so I thought I'd ride her streak a little longer. \n\nA Peruvian restaurant for the masses offering mouthwatering rotisserie chicken, small plates, tapas and specialty drinks. The most frustrating part about your dining experience will be deciding on what to order - everything sounds and looks amazing. You won't find guinea pig on their menu (a Peruvian staple), however, their chicken is on-point in the flavor department. \n\nSERVICE: Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Enough said. \n\nQUARTER CHICKEN - DARK MEAT ~ 5 stars: Moist. Fall-off-the-bone. Aromatic. Tender. Excellent flavor. Those are just a few ways to describe how good Limon's chicken is. You can tell how much work they put into each one. The chicken is cooked perfectly. They do an excellent job of seasoning the skin, the flavor vessel, and the meat is tender and juicy. I regretted not getting a whole chicken! If you order any of their chicken options, you're given three sauces. I know one was chimichurri but I'm not sure what the other two were. However, I think one was a mustard based sauce and that was by far my favorite - went perfectly with our chicken. \n\nYUCA FRIES ~ 4 stars: Crunchy on the outside with a flaky interior. Excellent when dipped into the sauces you get with your chicken. I wouldn't get these if you plan on eating them on its own. Without sauce, these things won't wow you.\n\nTACU TACU ~ 5 stars: Mashed beans mixed with rice and then sauteed. It's hard to imagine unless you experience it firsthand. It's dense so your hardest not to eat too much. However, this sh*t was amazing. Slightly salty, great texture, a mellow sear to provide a slight crunch and absolutely awesome. \n\nTRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE ~ 4.5 stars: I know, I know. This is not a traditional Peruvian dish, however, Sandy wanted to try it. It didn't disappoint. The mac was cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce was mellow, not too sharp, not too salty. The actual truffle flavor kind of gets lost in the richness but it does subtly come through once in awhile. You won't find any shaved truffles in this dish because they use truffle oil, which, if you didn't know, doesn't come close to the real deal. However, this gourmet mac & cheese is a must. \n\nENSALADA MIXTA SALAD ~ 2 stars: The lone disappointment of our meal. The salad wasn't tossed so the dressing was sitting on top. All the greens on the bottom didn't get any love. The bowl was small and not ideal for mixing. Other than that, the flavor was bland. I'd pass on this. \n\nEven though we had a late lunch/early dinner here this past Saturday at around 3:15pm, it was still pretty crowded. I can't imagine how packed it gets during dinner, especially on the weekends. They have a limited number of tables so they can't take that many guests at one time. Reservations are highly recommended if you plan on going during their dinner rush.", "author": "Bruce C."}

This food had so much flavor and it was a great place to eat and socialize.

(Corollary: Check out Inka Grill in Costa Mesa [socal] if you are ever there... their Peruvian green sauce is equivalent to the Mexican \"orange sauce\" they serve at La Vics). \n\nFood: \n\nTrio sauces: Chimichurri (middle) had a herby tang to it. Combined with the other two pepper sauces they make an excellent dip for the chicken and other meats. I realized the 'green sauce' that Inka Grill served was a combination of all three. Really hits the palette! \n\nChicarron: they claim it's the \"Limon Favorite\", but I thought it was just okay. It was good, but I don't feel it deserved the 'favorite' tag. \n\nSaltado: Ever had a craving for a particular food and satisfying that craving? That is what it was like for the Saltado!! This is a MUST HAVE as a Peruvian dish. \n\nRotisserie Chicken: Chicken cooked to juiciness and softness perfection.

Usually Im more particular with drinks but I have to say, the flavour was balanced it wasn't over done and was quite refreshing. \n\nNext up was the Pulpo a la Parilla. It was by far the best I've had since I've arrived in the US 8 years ago. It was tender. Cooked to perfection. Not chewy. It was beautifully presented with a side of potatoes. The sauce was outstanding and it felt like it all just melted in my mouth. On the side I had some yucca fries which were battered well and not oily. A plus in my book. \n\nWe also had a Shrimp and scallop ceviche. It was fresh and well balanced with a very delicious sauce made of lemon juice and some type of chili (I couldn't narrow it down). It wasn't overpowering, but gave the fish a nice kick. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend Limon for anyone wanting to get a taste of Peruvian food or just quality food in general.

Maybe I've been spoiled by real Peruvian at hole in the wall places in SoCal, but man...this was probably the most disappointing meal since I've moved.\n\nI should have looked through Yelp a little more and realized that this is a hipster joint and not an authentic experience. Maybe I should have gotten the rotisserie chicken. Sigh.\n\nLet's just touch on the Lomo Saltado since it's just...a classic. I mean nevermind that a truly tiny plate sets you back $11. Simply put, this dish is incredibly salty and the meat is dry. I hadn't realized that it didn't come with aji, so I asked for it.\n\"Sure! Which one would you like?,\" he asks.\n\"Oh I didn't know there were different kinds...um...the normal one they usually serve at Peruvian places?\"\n\"Well we have 3 different types of sauces - chimichurri, blah blah blah\"\n\"No, not chimichurri. Can I just have the spicy, light green aji with cilantro they usually always have at Peruvian places?\"\n\"Okay!\" \n...and then brings out chimichurri.\n\nI waived him back down and explained to him again. He takes back the chimichurri and brings out their trio of some type of mustard sauce, aji, and chimichurri. Really? All I wanted was aji. Just that deliciously spicy, cilantro-y crack sauce to dip everything in.\n\nThen he charges us for both the full size chimichurri and the sampler (we only touched the aji). \n\nHonestly, if you've ever had real Peruvian, stay away from this place.

I've been known to return a dish because I didn't like the smirk of condescension on the waiter's face. But not here. \n\nA whole roasted chicken here only costs $15.95, and along with two sides, that's more than enough to feed two people. The chicken is not your standard Costco variety (which frankly isn't bad in a pinch either) but very much a succulent Peruvian specialty called Pollo a la Brasa with all sorts of herbs in the marinade. It was broken apart in four pieces on a platter (see photo), ideal since that meant I could have the dark meat and Jamie W. could have the white. We are compatible that way. They have quite a list of small plates, all very Peruvian, but I just couldn't get past the chicken. \n\nOur sides were the Vegetables Salteados, which looked to be three different varieties of beans marinated with other vegetables, and the Papas Fritas, which were nicely crisped French fries (see photos). It was all good, solid comfort food, and if you sit at the bar like we did, the server may refill your Diet Coke for free. The total bill came to $22 before tip. Amazing in this city, don't you think? There is nothing bargain basement about the vibe in here - casual, cool enough for the hipsters, relaxing enough for the rest of us, busy but not chaotic.

Finally made reservations with a friend a couple of days before our designated day, so luckily we didn't have to wait as there was a large crowd of people waiting outside.\n\nOur order:\nArroz con Mariscos: ($16.95) Peruvian style paella made with saffron rice, mixture of seafood, aji amarillo pimento sauce \nPollo a la Brasa: Half order ($14.95) of Lim\u00f3n's famous marinated free-range rotisserie chicken slowly roasted over open flame. Comes with 2 sides of your choice (we chose Yuca Fries and Vegetales Salteados) and \"Aji\" sauces (Aji Amarillo Huacatay, Aji Amarillo Mustard, Chimichurri)\nLimon Old Fashion ($11)\n\nThe sauces that accompanied the dishes were light and not over-powering. The Aji Amarillo Huacata traditionally has a combination of olive oil, garlic, Huacata (Peruvian black mint), and Aji Amarillo (South American hot yellow chile pepper). The sauce tastes almost dill-like. The Aji Amarillo Mustard has a very light honey mustard taste to it. Almost like a pesto sauce, the Chimichurri is typically made with finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, and white or red wine vinegar.\n\nThe Vegetales Salteados had green beans, red onions, squash and zucchini. Everything was cooked so that they were very tender (just the way I like them!). Not overly salted, I really enjoyed the medley.\n\nThe Yuca Fries had a slight crispy skin and nicely cooked inside. Loved dipping them in the Aji Amarillo Mustard and Aji Amarillo Huacatay sauces.\n\nThe Arroz con Mariscos had some good flavors with bits of seafood. Not as bold as other paella I've had and way less seafood. =/ Decent.\n\nOk so on to the main reason why I was here.. the Pollo a la Brasa. The dish was cut into four pieces: I had the half a breast and a part of the thigh. The thigh was more moist than the breast (the breast was actually on the dry side). Seasoned well, you're still able to taste the slight charring from the roasting over an open-flame. Meat nearly came right off the bones.\n\nDecent service.

The chicken was pretty tasty, though.\n\nService was very slow for our group of four - my wife would have had another glass of wine, but the next thing I know, the bill was on our table.\n\nThen, minutes after paying the bill (having only been at the table for about 90 minutes) we were rudely and abruptly informed that another group had been waiting for a table for about 30 minutes, and unless we wanted to order something else, that we should please get up and leave.\n\nI'm sorry, but I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant in this way. It's fine if you want to set expectations up front about the timeframe for a reservation to be 2 or 2.5 hours (which they did not), but you certainly should never shame diners to get them to give up the table for others.\n\nDefinitely won't be coming back.", "author": "Josh T."}

When we finally got seated, we were quickly greeted by an awesomely flamboyant server, who gave us a good laugh each time he swung by our table! He was definitely an added treat to our meal. Once again, I've failed to remember our great server's name though...\n\nAnyway, we decided to go with the fish and shrimp ceviche, 1/4 pollo a la brasa with tacu-tacu and french fries, the lomito saltado, and the veggie empanadas. \n\nFirst dish to arrive was the ceviche. Sweet baby Jesus, thank you! Nice big chunks of fish and sliced shrimp, along with some choclo, all marinated in their \"leche de tigre\" marinade. To say the least, if there was a tiger that existed that would actually produce such \"milk,\" you best believe you'd find me at its teet. So yes, I did enjoy the ceviche. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=sdMP5Za3l_AhJjeu8LnP9A\n\nThe 1/4 roasted chicken was beautifully juicy and moist, with a seasoned crispy skin that made each bite better than the next. The fries were good, but nothing special, although the tacu-tacu was great! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=2eoXPqwCC56ETIGIkukviA\n\nThe lomito saltado was the least impressive dish, which I wanted more flavor from, although wasn't bad. Although it is tapas-portioned, I would have much rather enjoyed meat with fries, rather fries with meat. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=Psg-CinAv0K4grbgYq4eyg\n\nAnd finally, the veggie empanadas were deliciously delicious. Yes, that's right. Stuffed with mushroom, spinach, choclo, and cheese, I didn't even think to take a picture of them because all I cared about was finishing them. \n\nIn addition to the great food, the girlfriend ordered a Don Carlitos, which was great and mixed nicely. The first one they sent over was in a cracked glass, although the server noticed right away and sent us another one promptly. \n\nGreat food, atmosphere, and service!\n\nP.S: Tigre de leche is rumored to be an aphrodisiac.", "author": "Gino E."}

It was a good thing his parents were willing to drive to the city because I've been wanting to try this place for quite awhile.\n\nOn the Big Eat SF list is:\n\n#37 Rotisserie Chicken from Limon Rotisserie\n\nThe menu consists mostly of hot and cold tapas plates. You can choose among the many varieties of ceviche and traditional Peruvian dishes such as lomo saltado.  Listed on the menu as their only entree is their specialty: the Pollo ala Brasa.  Chicken marinated in the \"traditional way\" (which I'm sure is a guarded secret!) and cooked in their rotisserie. A whole chicken costs $16, half $9.75 and quarter $7.75, but it comes with two sides.  \n\nService was fast and efficient considering this place was packed on a Saturday night. The roasted chicken is PERFECT.  I love the crispy golden brown skin and the moist and flavorful meat.  I opted for dark meat, but my friend reports that her chicken breast was also moist. I paired my chicken with a simple mixed green salad dressed in a lime vinaigrette and crunchy, lightly salted sweet potato fries.  This is a very satisfying meal and if you don't get the whole chicken or order drinks, it'll cost you less than $10.\n\nBut of course, I did order a drink! Their sangria is sweet and has generous bits of apples and oranges in it.  It definitely hit the spot at $5 a glass.\n\nIf you've been wanting to try Limon for quite awhile too, don't wait any longer. They do chicken right.", "author": "Janice C."}

My three stars come from the service we ended up receiving at the end of our meal. Our server SERGIO was quite rude at the end of the night. I am not sure if he was in a bad mood because it was busy or not, but I was quite taken aback when he told me to calm down when I asked him about an error on a credit card charge. I assume he thought my raised voice was because I was mad, NO, it was because it was so darn loud downstairs that if I said it softer, he wouldn't understand me.

This location is spacious with an entire downstairs section to accommodate large groups. They even had a DJ booth behind our table. The roasted chicken is a must try and came juicy and tender. A half chicken is more than enough to share between two people. The two sides we had were the yuca fries and the tacu-tacu. Yuca fries are large starchy versions of potato fries. They were delicious with the aji dipping sauces and you will wish there were more than four pieces. The tacu-tacu, Peruvian-style beans and rice, wasn't anything special. The truffle mac & cheese came as advertised. It was creamy and full of truffle flavor. The one misstep here was that they forgot our order of empanadas.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

The name of the restaurant already implies that they are known for rotisserie but they truly do represent their name.\n\nI came here on Sunday with my friends in a group of 6. We had a reservation ready but it didn't look like it was needed. The restaurant wasn't too busy but I guess it's good to get in the habit of making reservations just in case, especially for this restaurant because it's highly recommended that you do. The restaurant has a nice modern feel to it, they have abstract art on the walls, and there is a pretty big bar in the middle of the restaurant. There is also second floor seating and that overlooks the first floor. We were seated right by the window so that was nice because we had a lot of light. The service here was okay, the servers came by occasionally to check up on us and make sure our waters were refilled. \n\nI decided to share two dishes with my boyfriend since there a couple of things we both wanted to try. We decided to get the half chicken with tacu tacu and yuca fries and the ceviche mixto with a glass of sangria. \n\nHalf chicken with a side of tacu tacu and yuca fries: The reason why I wanted to go here in the first place was because the chicken in the pictures looked good and they taste even BETTER. it was DELICIOUS. The chicken had so much flavor and unlike most rotisserie chicken that i've had, it wasn't dry! The chicken was moist and tender, even the breast was moist! The chicken also comes with three sauces and they went really well with the chicken :) The half chicken portion was okay, it wasn't big but it wasn't small either. It does come with two sides but the sides are small. I LOVED the yuca fries! They were so good because the inside was full of starchy potato-ey (it's actually cassava which taste similar to a potato) like goodness but the skin was crispy and thick. I only wished the dish came with more but you get three big thick pieces similar to potato wedges. The tacu tacu was also pretty good. The rice had good flavor and it complimented the chicken really well if you like chicken and rice together.\n\nCeviche mixto: out of all the ceviche this one had calamari, fish, and shrimp! The three seafood items I love to have in my ceviche. The dish portion is okay and it comes with mostly fish, a couple of shrimps, and small pieces of calamari. The dish was too acidic for me. I love lime and citrusy things generally but this one was pretty strong. The dish was overall very fresh and light. \n\nThe sangria was good! I love to get sangrias, it's my drink. I thought the drink wasn't too heavy and it was light and refreshing so it went really nice with the meal :) \n\nBest place ever for rotisserie chicken and I would definitely come back just for it and I highly recommend it for anyone that loves chicken!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

First glance showed a small and contemporary but comfortable spot, but there is an entire downstairs so they can really pack the people in. It is family style, so we ordered a bunch of dishes and shared the plates around.\n\nAmong our choices were: a whole chicken (you can't not get the roasted chicken at a rotisserie) which came with 2 sides (we got the yuca and sweet potato fries), the tartara de tuna, the lomito saltado, the carne a la parrilla, and the veggie empanadas. Though the plates were \"small\" they were filling, and we all left satisfied. One member of our party got an alcoholic beverage and another got a coffee. Despite all this, splitting the bill made my total only $13.60. That is ridiculous. I spent that on an omelet the next day. Great food cheap = winning!\n\nOur server was funny and attentive, and our water glasses were kept full. The only thing I didn't appreciate was that the manager essentially kicked us out. Let me re-phrase. He tried to kick us out before the coffee even arrived. Then he personally delivered the bill immediately after the coffee hit the table. Granted, we were chatting and catching up and yes were probably taking longer than normal. But it definitely wasn't an obnoxious amount of time and we were paying customers.

Don't get me wrong, the food was decent, but it's nothing worth of 4+ stars (nothing I would crave for frequently). My friend and I came on a Friday afternoon and I must say that the restaurant was pretty full, so I thought that this place looked promising! Parking wasn't too bad, found a spot one block away within 5 minutes. The waitress was very nice, but almost seated us at a table that someone was already at (honest mistake, I wouldn't have thought someone sat there either!) Restaurant was nice and clean, and nice open kitchen so you can see all the rotisserie chicken spinning in the oven! \n\nWe ordered:\n1. Half rotisserie chicken\nThe chicken was okay, but nothing to rave about. My friend said it tasted like the Costco chicken.. lol. The three sauces that came with it made the chicken slightly better though. However, parts of the chicken was dry and overall was on the salty part - no bueno. I may be more sensitive to saltiness than the average person, but it was pretty salty indeed..\n\n2. Side of sweet potato fries\nYum, enjoyed this a lot! Wish the portion was larger! :)\n\n3. Side of yuca fries\nThe waitress recommended this, so we decided to try something new! I would pass on this though.. Wannabe french fries, but not quite. Less water content and more starchy than a potato. \n\n4. Lomito Saltado\nFlavors were executed well, but again, TOO MUCH SALT! This dish was overly salty, especially the fries, which soaked up all the juices that made it super soggy as well. I asked for medium, and I think they gave us medium well since some of the sirloin pieces were tough. \n\nOverall, decent place to try, but wouldn't be coming back anytime soon...

Accompanied by addictive sweet potato fries and salted vegetables, per the recommendation of the server. I ordered the trio of sauces and would recommend you do the same, despite the less-than-noteworthy chimichurri. The aioli alone is worth it. The table all ordered the Inca Blu, which is unusual and quite good. We tried the ceviche and found it unusual but excellent. Good empanadas, but not the best we've had. Skirt steak did not disappoint, and everyone was full and happy. \n\nThe Bad: This place has an excellent reputation and it's always packed. We made reservations but still had to wait a bit. It's almost too loud to have a conversation, even with the person directly in front of you. One person at our table ordered hot tea that didn't materialize until we had nearly forgotten about it, and we sent it back. Service is a little harried; it may have been a bad night, or they might need to hire some more help. \n\nOverall: Worth it for the roast chicken alone. Everything was delicious at reasonable prices.

We had reservations for 8:30, showed up early at 8:15 and didn't get seated until 9:30.  They were entirely unapologetic and frankly quite indifferent to our hunger.  After putting up quite a fuss they relented and gave us each a small glass of sangria, which helped, but certainly didn't save us from starvation.  Service was pretty poor, but thanks to the mandatory 20% tip (we had a party of 7), we couldn't even express our distaste.  \n\nOn the other hand, the food is really remarkable.  I particularly loved the truffle mac & cheese, the lomito saltado, and the chicharrones de pollo.  The ceviche was good, but not as remarkable as the hot plates.  Of course, the chicken (pollo a la brasa) was excellent, though I remain more impressed by the sheer decadence of the mac 'n cheese.  And OMG, the panna cotta amazonica was to die for - absolutely amazing - delicious creamy goodness topped with strawberry, raspberry, AND mango coulis.  Almost worth the ridiculous wait.  And we all ate to our hearts content and had plenty of sangria, all for $25 per person.  \n\nI'd give it five stars if it wasn't for the wait, cramped space, and lackluster service.\n\nIn general, I just can't stand eating out in the mission.  All of the restaurants here think they are the shit and either (a) don't take reservations at all and require people to wait in the cold, or (b) take reservations, but still make people wait an hour and then eat in a cramped tiny little dining room. The mission needs to get over itself and start respecting its customers.  \n\nAnd don't get me started on driving here.   Bikers think they own the road, and they might as well because cars can't survive the steel-sheet-studded roads, where the left lane doesn't move because someone is trying to make a left turn adn the right lane doesn't move because someone is waiting for a parking spot.  And parking, nearly impossible, and even if you do find a spot, the cars around you won't hesitate to bumper park their way in and out of spots near you.", "author": "Greg B."}

Their rotisserie chicken is very good,  has great flavor and is never dry.  The accompying sauces pair well with it too.  Their rotisserie chicken meals with sides are great and reasonably priced for what you get.  I generally get the ensalada and the tacu-tacu.  The tacu-tacu is a tasty mash of rice and beans.  I have also tried several other items which are all good.  The truffle Mac and cheese is creamy and rich.  If you love truffles you will definitely love it.\n\nThey can get crowded towards the end of the week and weekend.  They are on open table which is nice for snagging a table without the wait.

Well, I have come to the conclusion that I need to try more Latin American fare, and Limon was near the top of my list. I had an excellent meal at Parada 22 in the Haight yesterday, and I just finished a great Peruvian lunch. \n\nI came a little past noon, and there was ample seating available. I'd say it was about 2/3 full for lunch before 1. The one thing that drew me to this place was the chicken. I read good things about it, and decided to give it a try. I realized that the quarter dark meat portion is actually a darn good deal for $10 since it came with 2 sides and the sauces. I opted for the yucca fries and the tacu tacu (rice mixed with beans). I didn't need to, but I also ordered the truffle mac and cheese. \n\nThe waiters were friendly, and I actually had 2 different waiters check up on me. Weird, but good to know they are looking out for you. Its also nice that they hand you a whole jar of water to refill your glass whenever you see fit, though at one point a waitress refilled my glass with her own pitcher. Nothing wrong with that. More water for me!\n\nSo it took a little less than 10 minutes for my food to come out, and man did I savor it. The truffle mac and cheese was great! The amount of cheese and truffle oil in every bite was great, and the noodles were cooked just right. It is good enough to share between 2-3 people, or even one person if that is all they plan on eating. Someone enlighten me on how mac and cheese is Peruvian. Just curious, but I'm glad it was on the menu. \n\nI'm a dark meat kind of guy, and I expected it to be cooked with enough flavor. The chicken was cooked perfectly, even the skin! However, I felt the skin was a little too salty for my taste. The tacu tacu was a great compliment, and I'm glad I ordered it instead of regular fries or plain rice. All the sauces tasted delicious without it being too heavy. I made sure to incorporate their sauces as much as possible, and I'm generally a fan of chimichurri sauce too. \n\nThey yucca fries were just ok. I had it a lot when I visited Costa Rica a couple years back. I mean, I like french fries in general, but it was nice to eat something a little different than what I would normally get. Of course, the sauce was a good dip for the fries. \n\nDelicious overall, and a simple yet pleasant lunch experience in the Mission. Seriously that chicken platter for $10 is a steal. I'd definitely come back here.", "author": "Loren John B."}

The place is nice with modern decor can hold a decent amount of people.  The downstairs is a bit dark.  We had to wait a while outside before we got seated (even though we had reservations).  The service seemed to start out good, but once the food was ordered, it was all downhill.  We had a group over 10 people, so we had to go with the pre-fixe.  \n\nHonestly, i'm not exaclty sure what everything was because they just brought it out and dropped it on our table.  High notes were the dipping sauces wich were really flavourful and complemented the chicken (and fries) very well.  The ceviche, tartare, and salads were okay, nothing to write home about.  The chicken was just okay as well.  I guess my expectations were a bit higher, but I felt that it was a bit dry and the not as flavorful as other places I've had.  Also, if its being served family style, they need to do a better job of chopping it up to make sure all the pieces are seperated.  \nThe amount of food was decent for the price, but you also never know if you are getting your moneys worth with a pre fixe family style dinner (like would it have been the same amount of food if we had 10 instead of 11).  I've had better peruvian food at Le Mar and Fresca on Fillmore. \n\nBack to the service.  Not anything special, in fact, it almost felt as if they were just there to take your food and then drop it off (waiters, the waterboys were actually attentive).  And when it comes time to pay, the waiter saw our credit cards, and tried to avoid us.  When we flagged him down he automatically said \"Whoa whoa, I can't do all those cards, 4 maybe 5 max.\"  I never understood this...the machine does all the calculations for you.  We were all splitting evenly and tip was already included, all he had to do was run the cards.  Yet he made it more difficult for us to try and set up payments between 4 cards.  I was actually shocked when he got the right amounts on those 4 cards. No extra tip!", "author": "Veasna H."}

The second time was a-ok - chicken was dry and salty and the waiter forgot how much we paid... In the end, I am still a fan but not sure when I'll be back again.\n\nPOLLO A LA BRASA (whole chicken)\nThe rotisserie chicken was delicious! Very tender and juicy with an herby crisp layer of skin, mmm. Three sauces were included - two of which had an aioli consistency and the other (and my favorite) has herbs & oil. However, when I came back a second time, the chicken was dry and really salty... to the point that I needed to drink water after every few bites.\nEach order of chicken comes with two sides and I've tried:\nYUCA FRIES\nThe yuca fries were well-fried and had a slightly heavy and creamy texture to it. I wasn't IN LOVE with it but it was still good.\nVEGETABLES\nThe veggies side was nicely sauteed and is a great break from all the meats.\nSWEET POTATO FRIES\nI don't normally like sweet potato fries but these were quite good. \n\nCHEVICHE MIXTO\nCalamari, tiger shrimp and fish with citrus-based juice and corn bits. Cheviche is a relatively new phenomenon for me but I quite love it because of the sour \"kick\" and the raw fish. There were plenty pieces of each to go around too. The corn bits were different from traditional corn; it was larger in size, paler in color and there were cooked and roasted pieces too.\n\nLOMITO SALTADO\nFries, onions and sirloin strips stir-fried together. The fries were very crispy but the beef was a bit overcooked to my tastes.\n\nTRUFFLE MAC'N'CHEESE\nA very nice carb item for our meal. It tastes just as it sounds. It's a well done mac'n'cheese you'd expect from a restaurant. The truffle flavor was present and did not overwhelm.\n\nCARNE A LA PARRILLA\nSkirt steak dish served with yukon potatoes with a red wine and demi glaze. This was quite delicious and was beautifully presented. The beef here was cooked to pink perfection. \n\nLYCHEE SOUR\nLychee infused Pisco Porton, citrus, egg whites and bitters. I normally don't like bitters but you can barely taste it in this drink - the lychee flavor ruled all. It was very enjoyable that may be a \"girly drink\" since you barely taste the alcohol. It ends with a very subtle hint of it then it just disappears. If you like lychee, this is the drink for you.\n\nThe first time I was here, service was great. Waiters were attentive to our empty plates and cleared the table one dish at a time. We had a quarter chicken leftover and friends pawned it off to me using my birthday as the reason haha. It was the last dish left and for the heck of it, I placed my favorite herb sauce on the plate of chicken, hoping the waiter gets the hint. When the container came back, I opened it and felt like I won the lottery! He poured the herb sauce on the leftover chicken. Thank you, awesome waiter for understanding my subtle hinthint.\n\nThe second time I was here, we were seated downstairs and it seemed like the waiter wanted us to order drinks. When we decided not to, he walked away before taking our food order. And when we paid for the bill, we had one card and a bunch of cash. Our waiter actually CAME BACK to ask us how much we paid in cash because he \"just put the cash away without thinking to count it.\" Wait, what?

I know the chefs know what they're doing when the breast meat is moist and the skin is crispy and well-seasoned.  However, I wish they gave us more of the Aji sauces.\n\n~The fish ceviche is very good, better than the shrimp.\n\n~The sangria is pretty diluted, which is probably why everyone says it tastes so good.  I personally prefer more alcohol at $6/glass that is mostly filled with ice.\n\n~Overall, the food is good.  The roast chicken is a steal given the quality and price.

I know this is san Francisco but come on.. $17+ for half a chicken plus sides that cost average of $7-9. The side of vegi was looking so sad and not appetiting at all, ceviche was small and expensive and tasted blend with lots of lemon on it (did you hear about garlic or other spices).

Because it was early, most of the tables were still empty. The hostess surveyed the scene and promptly led us to the worst table in the room. We asked if we could sit at a better table; she said \"sure, sit wherever you want\" and walked off leaving us to find a table and carry our menus over ourselves. Not exactly the warmest of welcomes! Fortunately, the table service was much better: prompt, attentive and courteous. \n\nWe ordered a beef empanada to share as a first course, followed by the rotisserie chicken with sides of saut\u00e9ed vegetables for both of us, fries for me, and sweet potato fries for my husband. Everything arrived very quickly and all at once -- despite our request, the concept of a first course didn't seem to apply. The beef empanada was good but not exceptional. The rotisserie chicken had crispy skin, was cooked exactly right, and tasted delicious! The saut\u00e9ed vegetables were overcooked and not very flavorful. Both of the fries were unexciting -- floppy, a little greasy, and not at all crispy -- with the sweet potato fries probably the better of the two. But really, floppy fries? Why bother? \n\nBecause the food arrived so quickly and all at once, the meal was over very quickly. Not a place to linger over dinner and conversation! I guess Lim\u00f3n bills itself as a Peruvian place, but it doesn't seem like one at all. Too many of the classic Peruvian dishes are missing from the menu, and the dishes we had, at least, lacked typical Peruvian flavor. If you're looking for delicious rotisserie chicken, though, you might consider this place, but definitely don't order the sides we ordered! \n\nOn our way out, we said thank you to the hostess, but she was far too busy chatting with her friends/coworkers to take any notice.", "author": "David K."}

We were very excited because of the high rating and reviews. I made reservation and we did not have to wait. \n\nThe ambiance is very good; lights were dim and it had a very hip flow to the place. We sat next to the kitchen and can hear the hustling and bustling. The waiter was very nice--great service. He even told us that we may want to hold off on ordering more food because what we ordered was a lot. \n\nWe ordered: half chicken (with 3 fantastic sauces) with the vegetable sides and beans/rice, tartar tuna, truffle mac & cheese, and a steak/vegetable dish. Of course, we also had drinks. I forgot the name of my drink but it was sour (which helped me open my appetite to eat the foods) and my fiance ordered a pisco sour. \n\nWe ate the tartar tuna as starter and it was amazing. I think it has sesame oil in it because I can taste and smell it when I put it in my mouth. The root chips (taro?) complemented the tuna very well. I know tuna may have high mercury content, but I think it's worth it to be poisoned for a day.\n\nNext, the chicken came out--boy was I amazed when I put the first bite of the chicken in my mouth! I don't usually like chicken because I think it's bland and it's nothing special. However, the chicken here is incredible. The spices and marination of the chicken are what made the chicken so special. In addition, the three sauces added a flare to the taste. My fiance and I couldn't stop saying \" this is soo good. this is soo good.\" The half chicken was cut into four pieces and he had two while I had one. I swear I could have finished the last piece if it wasn't for the mac & cheese. \n\nTalking about the mac & cheese, it literally melted in my mouth because it was so good. I kept telling my fiance \"more, more, and more\" of the mac & cheese on my plate. It was very creamy and fluffy. Very comforting and easy to eat. It went very well with the DELICIOUS chicken. \n\nOverall, I loved everything except the steak/vegetable dish. Fiance ordered it because he's a fan of beef dishes. We hardly touched it because we were both so full. \n\nWe will return and I have no doubt we will continue to chant \"this is soo good. this is soo good\" when we eat again.", "author": "Anh W."}

I understand it was a Friday evening and people are celebrating the work week was over, but it felt more like a sports bar to me.  Loads of people standing, talking loud and using profanity.  I can handle that but what made it worse was them making the same mistake twice in our order of ceviche.  We made sure to tell the waiter we wanted the fish ceviche but twice he came back with the shrimp.  We explained my wife is highly allergic to shellfish and her life could be in danger if she consumed it.  The first time was excusable but when he came back the second time with assurance the order was correct, we found shrimp again!  What made it worse was my wife ate a part of it trusting the waiter was correct.  Luckily she had her meds and began feeling ill.  I am grateful to the couple who sat next to us for speaking up for us knowing we were visitors!  Thank you to \"L\"(I won't say her name) and your date for your concern!  You saved me from blowing my top!  In fact if you get to read this, I'd like to communicate with you(in case you come to Hawaii).  Anyway we needed to leave earlier than expected and then the waiter asks for my signature on a bill with a black credit card.  Lucky for him I'm an honest guy and told him I never gave him my card!  How scary is that?????  The bill was someone else's!  Manager refused to comp our meal at the urging of our neighborly Angel, \"L\".  I've been in management for a long time so I know better....not with the expectation of a free meal, but know what is proper.  Also as a manager, I also know you don't raise your voice back at your customers as she did to our new found friend, \"L\".  I am hoping the owner will train their managers better with customer service skills!  If not and you are reading this, let me know!  I can train them!  On the positive, the food was good and the Sangria refreshing, but the bad experience overshadowed all of that!  Will not go back there again on the next visit!  Aloha!!!!!", "author": "Lee K."}

We ordered a quarter chicken (dark) with sweet potato fries and salad, (2) carne empanadas, and some of their truffle mac-and-cheese. Where do I start...\n\n-- Quarter Chicken (dark): Pretty tasty. Not burnt, nicely moist, and holistically enjoyable.\n\n-- Sweet potato fries: Not Peruvian...and nothing special. Unless a restaurant serves a variation...sweet potato fries always taste the same!\n\n-- Salad: Enjoyable - great to see beets in the salad. Yup...a mundane side, but a great compliment to the chicken.\n\n-- Carne Empanadas: For an entire section on the menu emphasizing these packets on joy (har har...), we opted for the carne version. SO underwhelming, and SO mundane! The breading was way too thick for the filling inside. Also was completely bland. For the meat filling, there wasn't enough of it. It was also super bland. I could get multiple of these for only of a fraction of the cost at Limon, and they'd also taste a whole lot better!\n\n-- Truffle Mac-and-Cheese: We fell for a horrible ruse. The menu describes this dish as their signature dish. Hmm...doesn't say much for Limon Roisserie then! The mac-and-cheese was really light, so much so that it was a bit annoying to eat, as you don't taste anything, but feel it in your gut afterwards. The truffles weren't really evident, although I might be wrong. I just felt I was eating bland mac-and-cheese. SUCH an underwhelming dish.\n\nI'm really disappointed after dining here.

Made reservation for 5 people hours prior to arriving. When we arrived the place was nearly empty; couple of people sitting at the bar, two men at a large corner table. The hostess, at the lectern at the door, placed us immediately in the worst possible spot. She pulled two small tables together length wise, placing three adults along side the table on one side, clearly squished uncomfortably together, 5 feet directly in front of the door, on a cold, rainy night. It was freezing cold. People came in and out, and the cold wind was blowing directly on us. \nWe must have looked comical, five people sitting like that, in front of the door, in an empty restaurant surrounded by nice, warm, roomy, empty tables. We weren't 'dressed up', but our decidedly mixed group had come straight from work and while casual, we were decently dressed. \nWe tried to get the attention of the hostess to ask for another table, but could not. When the waiter came over I asked for another table if at all possible. The waiter, Jason A., was polite, professional, and said he would try. We watched him talk to the hostess - she was standing right next to us - she reported all other tables were taken - and she was clearly pissed off. Sighing, eye rolling, arm flapping, the whole thing. After some back and forth the waiter turned around and offered us a table, intended for a group our size, in the corner. \nThe food was o.k., not exciting. Kind of overpriced for what it was. We had a good time though, and enjoyed the drinks, especially the sangrias. The most amazing thing was that after having been told all the tables were reserved, we ate and drank for two hours, they had open tables the whole time, people walked in without reservation and were seated. The hostess had simply chosen to put us in the worst spot in the place, at a cobbled together table ridiculously too small for our party.\nThe wait person Jason was great the entire evening, made good suggestions re; the menu, etc. We left him a good tip. The hostess was awful, left a really bad impression, never attempted to help, and was rude. Left a very bad impression of the place.", "author": "Inez I."}

The one star is for the manager or owner (the guy with the long hair) who greeted us very quickly and was super friendly. Now let's start with the food, we ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken, instead we got what it looked like a baby quail. It was soo small like for $17 bucks really? are you kidding me? And it was salty and almost pure bones. It came with 2 sides, we got the tacu tacu which is basically refried beans and rice mixed together (its was tasty) but the size?? Omg it was like literally a size of an egg. The sweet potato fries, meh! We also ordered the empanadas. Ok I'm pure breed Peruvian so those empanadas made with queso Oaxaca? Where in the world have you seen Peruvian empanadas made with Mexican cheese. Ok fine! They were tasty but again 9 bucks for 2 mini empanadas they were the size of a pill compared to the authentic Peruvian empanadas. For a drink my cousin got the chicha morada! How can you mess that one up I thought but guess what..?! It was from a bottle and it tasted horrible like spoiled lemonade from the 99 cents store. The cousin kindly asked if he could have something else since it was almost imposible to drink it and he didn't want to get the runs by drinking something that was spoiled. The buss boy tried to tell us we were wrong by saying \"oh it is from a bottle\" like it wasn't their fault. Then I said \"well, maybe you had that bottle opened for a while. He said \"well.... let me tell your server\". Our server was busier tasting alcoholic drinks at the bar and did not check our table once to see if we were ok. I feel like we got stereotyped because \nWe got the LA homies look alike because he was attentive and checked on the tables next to us at least twice and he will go around us without even looking at us. At that point I wasn't even hungry anymore. So I asked for the check to the busser because the server wouldn't even look at us. When the server brought the check all he said was \"when you are ready\". Just FYI Ive been in the restaurant industry for over 14 years and I don't spect to be treated like president Obama but please! At least give me a decent service and decent food if you are going to have those ridiculous prices.

Already, the restaurant was about half full and the air was filled with the delicious aromas.  We were quickly seated at a table for two and given menus.  \n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but there are still quite a few options. We decided on:\n\n-Aguadito de Pollo ($5.95): This soup was a little bit salty for us, but still pretty good overall. It has a lot of chicken in it and is very flavorful. It came out nice and hot, which should be a given, but often isn't at many restaurants. It was very satisfying on a cold, rainy day. \n\n-Half Chicken ($9.95): We were unsure if this would be enough to share, but the waiter confirmed that it would be. Four large pieces of chicken were served: two white meat and two dark meat pieces. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. The meat was soft and it was fun to try the three different sauces with it. \n\nThe chicken also comes with two sides (which you can pick from a list).  We chose:\n-Yuca Fries: 4/dish. Light crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  These are a must try and go great with the various dipping sauces. They taste very much like mashed potatoes on the inside. \n-Vegetales Salteados: A mixture of saut\u00e9ed green beans, onions, and bell peppers. Sort of tastes like there's some soy sauce in the blend. Nothing really out of the ordinary, but I still enjoyed this side dish. \n\nOverall, this was plenty of food for the two of us. Both my mom and I really enjoyed the meal. Everything came out hot and tasted fresh. On top of that, the prices are very fair and the service is good!\n\nNotes:\n-The staff is very friendly.  They refill water promptly and respond to \"thank-you's.\"\n-Street parking in the area is not great, but manageable because it is somewhat away from the busy-ness.\n-Family style dining!\n-The restaurant is casual enough for an everyday meal, but has the ambiance of a nicer restaurant for a casual date.", "author": "Samantha L."}

We didn't have a reservation, but we happily stood in the bar area with a cocktail and waited about a half hour for a table. As soon as the hostess showed us to our table downstairs, I asked if we could be moved upstairs. The basement was so loud, we couldn't talk across the table (no insulation and concrete walls/floor/ceiling was LOUD). There were two birthday parties going on, and they seemed to be trying to one-up each other's loudness. People were actually standing on chairs, singing and screaming. \n\nThere were three tables upstairs that had been open for the past 15 minutes, and I asked if we could move to one of those. She said we'd have to wait another half hour for a two-seat table upstairs, and that she couldn't seat us at one of the three four-top tables that was open because a large group might come in. \n\nWe were at the table for 15 minutes, and our server never came by. We didn't even have water. The host or manager (not sure which) came by to ask if we wanted another cocktail, and we asked if he could send our server because we were ready to order. He kindly took our order and brought us some water. I don't think we ever actually saw our server until he brought the bill. \n\nThe food was delicious, although the portions were a little small. We shared four plates and two cocktails, which was a light dinner and came out to about $65 before tax and tip. I'd probably order three plates each for next time. \n\nWe might go back and give it another chance - this time with a reservation for a table upstairs. I'll update if we go back and have a better experience.", "author": "Taylor B."}

At first, we all stood next to our table (about 15 of us) chatting when we were told by management that we were not allowed to sit down until at least 18 had arrived. I mean, really? Our waiter actually told us to ignore that and just sit down once the manager was gone (realizing how stupid that just was I assume).\nFast forward 2 hours to the bill. $1400 total and we were told that they cannot do more than 4 credit cards. I asked to speak to the manager and she just insisted on the maximum, offering to increase the limit to 6 eventually. I'm sorry, but you just charged $280 tip / service charge.

Sure, but with so much build up and hype, the food just didn't live up to the experience.\n\nNow everyone knows I have a soft spot for Central and Southern American cuisine. So when my friends told me about Limon being a Peruvian join, I just had to check it out. \n\nThat line right there, sounded like it came straight out of a Triple D's script. \n\nBesides being white, covered in tattoo, spiky bleached hair, and rich. I too love to eat food and share about it. But if people ask me about a good Peruvian joint to go to, I would not say Limon Rotisserie at all. Reasons one, the food is mediocre. Their famous rotisserie chicken is well...taste like roasted chicken. To be honest, the seasoning at Costco is better. Their other dishes like Lomito Saltado lacked soul. You know what I'm talking about. This dish is supposed to be comforting and satisfying. The ones at Limon delivered on neither nor did it on my wallet. Everything else is just alright. Their side dishes are good but unless I'm an 80lb model, I will never get full. \n\nWhich leads me to my next criticism. Their price to serving size ratio is horrendous. This place must makes a huge ROI. \n\nI mean the service was decent, decor was nice.

You can order a quarter, half, or whole chicken and you get 3 sides with it along with a variety of delicious dipping sauces. \n\nI have been here twice now and everything I have tried is cooked perfectly, to an intoxicating texture. The chicken is crisp and well seasoned on the outside, moist on the inside. The fried seafood platter is battered to perfection-- light and crisp breading-- and you get shrimp, calamari, and white fish. It falls apart in your mouth. Not to mention this plate is beautifully arranged and comes with fresh corn nuts that put your childhood corn-nut snack to shame (and doesn't hurt your teeth). \n\nTheir yucca fries are delicious and their truffle mac n cheese is so good you'll be wishing you had two stomachs so you could ingest more.  \n\nAnd did I mention they know how to make a good cocktail? \n\nThis place is always overflowing with people, so a reservation is helpful, but we have also come in on a whim and either didn't have to wait long or sat at the bar table (where we were served and attended to like any other table). \n\nLimon is a restaurant that follows through on their excellence in all areas.", "author": "Katie D."}

The line was reasonable: about a 20 minute wait for a table, but we just decided to grab a seat at the bar.\n\nAtmosphere was decent, with a dimly lit dining area and an array of local hipsters surrounding you, it really contributes to the hip and diverse feel of the mission (which was by the way named the second best neighborhood in the nation for hipsters, according to Huff Post). \n\nWe got the Ceviche De Pescado (red snapper), the beef tongue plate and yuca fries. When the Ceviche first came out I was a little disappointed at how small the portion looked, but when I dug in I realized that small portion was actually a larger portion compressed in some way to make it look like a small cute little appetizer. I do have to say though, it was the BEST CEVICHE I'VE EVER HAD!! Holy mother of yeezus, the red snapper was so fresh and tasty with the perfect amount of zest thrown on it. The beef tongue was decent as well, but a little on the salty side. Yuca fries: ehh, a little too bland and flavorless when you eat it without the sauces they provide.\n\nOverall the ceviche was amazing, the atmosphere did us good and we had a super chill evening.

We are huge mac and cheese fans and their's was definitely up there with our favorites. We also had the tuna tartar, there red snapper civiche and braised short ribs. It came out probably within 10 minutes of us ordering which was incredibly fast. I kind of wish I had some time for a cocktail and then a glass of wine, but I guess you can't really complain about fast service. We also had the warm chocolate cake for dessert which was also pretty yummy and a warm liquid center. \n\nThe only issue I have and what kept this from being 5 stars was the ambiance. There was a family of 6 with 3 small children next to us when we were seated. The parents let their children run around screaming, crawling over the chairs, under the tables and actually running down the booth seating that spanned one of the walls.

I had a blue moon(which is what i always get no matter what if they offer it), We also got the Pisco Sour, which was definitely a interesting cocktail that they are known for. It was really good and really strong. Moving on to the food now. \n\nWe shared a whole chicken, which since it is a rotisserie, they are definitely known for. This was the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had.Whatever they marinate it in, just makes it really amazing. It was really tender, and not dry at all. We ordered the truffle mac and cheese, which was really rich and creamy. This was the first time I have ever tried yuca fries and they were absolutely delightful. The \"lomito\" saltado was awesome too! It was basically a dish with sirloin strips and it was topped with a soy sauce infused sauce. It wasn't overly salty which would be normal with anything that has soy sauce. It also included fries, tomatoes, and onions which made it really good as well. We had the ceviche mixto which was really good as well and not overly spicy at all. All this food was enough for six people. After the chicken most of us were really stuffed.\n\nThe desserts here were really good as well! We had the chocolate bandito, which was a rich, warm chocolate cake. I don't think you can go wrong with that. It was really amazing and rich dark chocolate. We also had the panna cotta de mango, which was great. I am not a huge fan of any mango desserts, but I broke out of my shell for this and it was well worth it. There was also a bread pudding thing that we got which was really good!

Crispy texture gave a think layer of crunch with tender flavorful meat in the inside. \n\nSeco de Costillas - The beef was tender and the sauce can practically be eaten like a soup. \n\nCarne empanadas - A great crispy outside layer with flavorful beef in the inside. The balance of onions, tomatoes, eggs, and raisins definitely gave will give an orgasm to your taste buds for sure. \n\nIf that wasn't enough,  we threw in some sides along the way as we ordered main entrees throughout the dinner. \n\nThe  Tacu-Tacu was one side dish which is one I've never had before.

Actually the neighborhood around Limon is a bit sketchy and I'm always hesitant to leave my car parked there, especially at night.  The other main business is drinking as they have two bars, one on the street level and one in the basement.  I often find them overflowing with trendy hipsters as well.  Noise level is frenetic when they get busy.  The deserts are tasty and I have not tried any of their drinks.  Oh the bathrooms are for both sexes...at the same time.  That's a little odd.\n\nFor the price, I'd expect better but for those times when you simply must have authentic Peruvian Rotisserie, Limon is the place.", "author": "Bobby K."}

The food is underwhelming and the desserts aren't house-made. I wouldn't wait in line for a table when there are so many good restaurants in the city.\n\nI cam on 27 May 2011 with a friend for dinner. We had made reservations a couple hours earlier online, so when we arrived, we bypassed the queue of people waiting for tables. We ordered the following:\n\nCeviche Mixto ($9.75, fish, calamari and tiger shrimp) - The civiche mixto was okay. In retrospect, it was one of the better dishes we ordered.  However, I'm not sure I would order it again... it was slightly too salty.\n\nEmpanada Pollo ($7.25, shredded roasted chicken, hard-boiled eggs, olives and capers) - I wasn't feeling this dish. The chicken was a bit dry and not flavourful enough.  I wouldn't order this again.\n\nEmpanada de Vegetables ($7.25, mushroom, spinach, choclo and mascarpone) - This was much tastier than the chicken empanada. I would totally order this again; however, I wish the inside were a bit warmer.\n\nSeco de Costillas ($8.95, braised boneless beef short ribs with huacatay and cilantro. Served with potatoes, carrots and english peas) - This dish was the one of the better ones; however, the short ribs could have been more tender. \n\nLomito Salteado ($9.75, Stir-fried top sirloin strips, onions, tomato and soy sauce. Served with fries) - This dish was okay. I thought the beef was a bit tough; however, my meal-mate seemed to like it. He'd order it again, and I would now.\n\nProfiteroles ($6.75) - This was awful. I swear these are the cream puffs that you get from Costco's freezer section. They were soggy on the outside, and not very creamy on the inside. We felt ripped-off. I seriously wanted to confront them about getting these from Costco...\n\nPanna Cotta ($6.75) - This was as awful as the profiteroles. This was actually NOT panna cotta. It was a lot closer to Jell-O No Bake. I felt embarrassed for the restaurant.\n\nDessert seriously ruined my entire view of this restaurant. Because of it, I would not come back, and seriously would refuse to wait in queue. At least the meal wasn't too expensive.\n\nAlong with a pisco sour ($9.00) and a bottle of Pelligrino ($6.00), our bill came to $71.45 + 6.79 tax + 16.00 tip = $94.24 for the two of us.", "author": "Rick S."}

The pisco sour was also one of the best I've had. \n\nThe salt levels were pretty inconsistent, though, with the mac and cheese being severely underseasoned and bland (tasted like creamy macaroni with a faint hint of truffle oil) whereas the paella verged on being cloyingly oversalted.\n\nThe service was ok.

It was packed when we got there and luckily they seated us immediately. We were upstairs but I guess they have a downstairs area that I didn't get a very good look at. \n\nOrdered the following:\nQuarter Chicken (Dark Meat) - I didn't eat it, don't eat meat. BF did and enjoyed it. \n\nYuca Fries - lighter alternative to potato fries. Came with 2 big ones. Good!\n\nTacu-Tacu - I just tried a spoon full of this but it was really good. They used pinto beans, which I prefer, instead of black. Although I am used to black beans in this dish at other South American/Caribbean places. \n\nCeviche de Pescado - Fresh and perfectly marinated in lime juice. Huge chunks though...never had such big chunks of fish in ceviche before. Came with some weird toppings too like pine nuts and corn nuts and stuff...weird, but fun and nice presentation. Did not take away from the flavor at all. \n\nEnsalada Rusa - Had to get, I'm Russian and this was their take on Vinigrette (Russian beet salad). Sooooo good! Huge chunks, yet again, which this salad generally does not have. The aioli they drizzled on it was soooo good and perfect for the flavors. Loved it!\n\nVeggie Empanada - Came with 2. Very good. Delicious mushrooms and cheese inside. \n\nMaracuya Sour & Lychee Sour - Lychee was way better. Both ok. The egg whites in these drinks are ok to taste but kinda gross when your nose is in close proximity to the drink and you get a whiff of egg. \n\nThe chicken came with 3 sauces. We asked our server to please make sure one of the sauces was hot sauce. We need hot sauce with every meal and especially ceviche. She brought it out and all was good but when the check came we saw a $1.50 charge for hot sauce...WTF!!! You can not serve Ceviche without hot sauce and then charge for it when we request it. In fact you REALLY should not charge for hot sauce at all and if you do you should have your servers tell patrons up front that it will be an additional charge.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-12", "description": "Came here for a friend's birthday. Upon arriving was where things weren't off to a great start. Half of the party (total 6) had arrived and we were waiting to be seated while the others were in search of parking. Generally most places would've sat you to gradually get some drinks started. NOPE! The hostess had first said that the whole party had to be there. Fine, I understand. Then the 4 of us were waiting and asked again if we could get seated since it's pretty cramped to stand anywhere. The hostess then tells us that \"80%\" of the party had to be there. I've never heard anyone tell me that ever. It was weird. Finally there was now 5 of us and just because that additional person arrived to meet the \"80%\" we got seated. So stupid...\n\nWe finally get seated and are given menus. As we chat and look through the menu for a good 10 minutes, a waiter has yet come to our table. The same hostess that had seated us came back to our table. My only assumption for her approaching us we to possibly move to a different table. NEGATIVE! Her approach was awful. She told us that we had to give up the table at approximately 8PM due to other reservations that they had OVERBOOKED. At this point it was 7:20PM. So you're telling me I have 40 minutes to eat and leave? Who does that?? It was the weirdest thing I've ever heard. We had made it clear to the hostess that we just sat down and have been waiting for a waiter to come by, and now you're telling me I have to leave soon. Absolutely ridiculous! We get into this whole talk with the hostess as to why we need to hurry up with our meal that we have yet ordered to accommodate others due to their irresponsible way of booking reservations. She kept telling us that the food comes out quickly and whatnot. I told her if I wanted a quick meal I would've gone to McDonald's. I don't care how quickly the food comes out or not. You don't tell a party of people that made reservations for a birthday that they have to quickly eat and go. UNACCEPTABLE!!!\n\nThe waiter finally came to our table after that ridiculousness with the hostess. He informed us not to worry and to relax and enjoy our meal. He told us that this happens often, which is a shame because then the customer will take it out on the waiter. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. He had offered us some sangria on the house due to what had happened with the hostess. I appreciated that.\n\nAs for the food, it was good. We ordered a whole chicken to share with the group. The two sides we ordered was the yuca fries and the tacu-tacu. Yuca fries were good. Tacu-tacu could've been better. It basically tasted like stuffing but really dry. Lychee sour was a good drink. We ordered a few of the small plates. I had chosen the lengua (beef tongue), which was good. The food here was good, but I've had better.\n\nOverall, I would not come back to this location nor would I be interested in trying their other locations due to the lack of professionalism with management. Regardless of how good or bad the food and service is, I am not sold on ever returning to this establishment. A word of advice to management: learn how to not overbook reservations just to get some extra change in your pockets.", "author": "Connie C."}

But the service we received dining at this location of Limon was absolutely horrendous.\n\nLook, before I go on a rare tirade, I will say that the food is great. I enjoyed every bite of the extended pre-fixe menu (that we were actually served), I loved my pisco sour, and coupled with good service would easily be worth the $55 I paid. Highlights were the Rotisserie Chicken and the Tartare. But the customer service was appallingly bad on multiple occasions, and my review will focus on that.\n\nSo a word to the wise: your \"reservation\" at Limon means jack. They will overbook because it's a popular restaurant in the Mission.\n\nI don't mind waiting a long time for food if it's that good, but why take reservations if you won't honor them!\n\nOur reservation for 7 was for 9 PM - we made it late in the afternoon. Hostess says our table will be ready soon. OK fine.\n\n9:20. no table, and we're getting hungry, since we put off dinner until 9 PM. We ask the hostess if our table is almost ready, and she flat out lies to us in saying that \"it's being cleared as we speak.\" I was so offended by how BAD she was at her job in the half hour window I chose to observe (not much else to do while waiting in a restaurant that was too loud to talk in, and having experience in fine dining myself like to observe how others do their jobs), that I almost just walked out, or at least talked to a manager, but it was pretty clear that they were so overrun with people that no one would listen anyway.\n\n9:40. We've now been asked to relocate where we are standing on TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS because we are \"in the way\". Oh, we're in your way now, even though YOU TOLD US TO MOVE HERE. Oh, and we might not be in the way if you'd seated us somewhere around the time our reservation was set for.\n\n10:00 PM. I finally give up and go sit outside with one of my dinner-mates.\n\nWe were finally seated around 10:15.\n\nDrinks were served quickly, and the first courses for the $30/person pre fixe came out quickly. I'll reiterate that the food is fantastic. Unfortunately the online menu is quite out of date, as you no longer get Papa a la Huanacaina. In fact, it seems like they just give you one less dish for the same price, now. \n\nMy end of the table also only got the Snapper ceviche, even though the pre fixe menu says it comes with ceviche mixto, which is kinda strange considering the other half of the table confirmed getting ceviche mixto. Just reverified (via food porn from that night) that it was in fact all snapper on our plate. Unless, of course, ceviched shrimp and squid all of a sudden look and taste exactly like snapper. And since my friend sitting across from me makes killer shrimp ceviche all the time, I'm going to say no.\n\nI'd strongly recommend updating the online menu, especially when you're going to cut back on the number of dishes you'll serve guests in a family-style setting. And if you're going to offer a pre-fixe menu, maybe you'd consider letting patrons see what is actually on the menu. For what it's worth, we were so hungry after waiting for 80 minutes that we just asked the waiter what was on the menu, couldn't really hear him because it was so loud, and it was, you know, after 10 PM already, and just sort of nodded blankly, assuming the waitstaff could serve us our food correctly. Our bad I guess? Sigh...anyway I digress...\n\nI was so excited to have the Lomito Saltado, which is one of my favorite dishes around. Oh but whoops, they only served us one plate of it for seven people (we got two plates of everything else). This time I was well aware that there was a mistake, and quickly flagged down the first person I saw, who happened to be a busboy (can always count on the bussing staff, I feel), and told him that we were missing a plate of food.\n\nIn the lone positive customer service moment of the overly lengthened night, the busboy immediately came back out with another plate of Lomito Saltado...and then was STOPPED BY OUR WAITER and after they talked for a moment, the food was brought back into the kitchen. A new plate was served five minutes later.\n\nOur bill was $400. $400 for a downright awful customer service experience. The saving grace of the night was that the food was delicious, but I have to draw the line somewhere!\n\nAgain, fantastic food, but I don't see a reason in the world to come back here with how awful the service was. I was seriously, SERIOUSLY, disappointed, no, I can't even tell you how disappointed I was. I feel wrong giving this place one star, but I'm shocked we even got food by the time the night was over, with how little the staff that \"took care of us\" seemed to care.\n\nI am still shocked.

Here's why I have to disagree.\n\nWe used Open Table and saw my name on the hostess's screen when we walked in. She sat my date and I in the basement. Tip about the basement: one end is dark and awkwardly lit and drafty with smaller tables; think middle school dance party in a friend's basement. The other end is warmer and echoey and where they sit all the huge groups; think middle school dance party in a friend's basement, but with a better eye for decorating and funky lighting. For the first time in my life, I asked the server if we could move to another table.\n\nWe were taken back upstairs to a much better spot, but things did not improve enough. We ordered 4 small plates to share, and cocktails. All 4 of our small plates arrived, 1 of them completely eaten before we even got our cocktails. Both tables next to us had their drinks (cocktails and wine) ordered after ours and served before ours. The meat empanadas were great. I kind of wish I had just binged on those, because everything else was meh (truffle mac n cheese, gallina, and ceviche).\n\nTo add insult to injury, the hostess then reported me to Open Table as a no-show.\n\nThe drink menu looks great, and it seems this establishment would be great for groups. But they don't seem to need my business and I won't be giving it to them again.", "author": "Jenn W."}

I tried to make reservations on OpenTable through their website, but there weren't any available for the time we wanted.  I called to double-check, and voila!  We had reservations for 8pm.\n\nIt was very busy when we walked in, but we were seated immediately.  I could see why people might say the service was slow, but it was actually perfect for us because we had time to figure out exactly what we wanted (and change our minds a couple times) before the waiter came.  I always hate it when I haven't even had a chance to look at the menu when the waiter comes by, so this was perfect.\n\nWe started with drinks.  I had the caipirinha (which I still can't pronounce.. is it ky-pah-REEN-a? anyway.) and my bf asked for the waiter's suggestion on white wines.  He ended up with a Peruvian white that he enjoyed.  I also love it when waiter's don't automatically suggest the most expensive wine on the list, and he did not. :)\n\nBf had actually been here before, and he has been talking about the rotisserie chicken pretty much since we started dating, so I knew we were getting that.  We ordered a half chicken, and basically all the sides.  It ended up being 3 different kinds of fries, rice, veggies in a soy-kinda stir fry, and a beans and rice dish.  So it was a little bit of carb-overload, but I looooove carbs so I didn't mind.  The yuca fries are delish, although very carby.  We liked the sweet potato fries too.  Next time, we'd skip the regular fries and the rice...we just didn't need all of that food.\n\nThe dipping sauces were great (same as the ones at Limon in the Mission (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eM3mXwH7JOqqZDlVBGeWgw)).\n\nThe best part came when we got the bill.

We were extremely excited that we were able to squeeze in a reservation at 7 pm.  When we had arrived, just as we had expected, the place was packed and extremely busy.  But being that the restaurant was incredibly high rated on Yelp, we assumed that the staff would be able to handle the chaos.  We were seated right next to the main entrance.  There was a crowd of people standing right next to us, waiting to be seated.  Although it was a bit uncomfortable having them stare at us while we ate, we brushed it off and agreed not to let it ruin our dining experience.  As time passed, more and more people started to squeeze their way into the front of the restaurant.  It got to the point where every five seconds, someone, including the waitstaff, would bump into my fiance's chair or his elbow.  At this point, we were surprised that the staff didn't request to have some of the customers wait outside.  There was absolutely no room to even walk. \n   \nOnce we received our entrees, the bumping and crowding was getting a little out of hand, so we decided to notify the waiter of the situation.  The waiter shouted, \"please move back\" just once, and then ran off to take care of his other orders.  It did nothing.  A few minute later, a lady customer walking over to the bar had bumped into my fiance's elbow pretty hard.  Instead of apologizing, she had decided to pick a fight with him and started complaining how his elbow was in her way.  He was just trying to eat his food. (sigh...) We really didn't want to make a big scene at the restaurant so we just let the lady finish complaining, and decided to inform the manager of what was turning out to be a very disappointing experience.  \nWhen the manager came to speak with us, I kindly let him know of the situation, and all he could say was \"I'm sorry.  It's just really busy today.  There's nothing we could do.\"  As the crowd got bigger, people were actually pushing into my fiance's elbow while he attempted to finish eating.  We called the manager over and showed him exactly what we were talking about and again he apologized, asked the customer to move back just once, (which again did nothing) and then ran off to take care of other things.  They were doing nothing to fix the situation.  \n\nWhen we received our check, the manager told the waiter \"give them a free dessert,\" as if it would make amends for our horrible experience.  Unfortunately, we didn't want to even stay there a second longer.  We left and agreed to never return.\n \nThis situation could have been easily fixed if they had just kindly asked their customers to wait outside.  If that wasn't doable, they should not have squeezed our table right by the entrance in the first place.

A lot of their food was over-salted and the drinks were nothing to write home about. The service was shaky at best and the hostess (although very cute!) was a complete & total idiot who kept saying \"2 more minutes!\" regarding when we'd be seated. Truth be told, we had a reservation and still had to wait about a half hour. I usually don't care about that type of stuff, but don't bullshit me. Tell me you're running behind, invite me to go have a drink at the bar, and have my server send out some cheapo appetizer of the house. \"2 minutes\" said about 15 times, equals 30...dumb shit.\n\n For the price point, the place looks like you're dining in a taqueria. \n\nI certainly don't understand what the hype is all about and although it wasn't terrible, I'd never come back.", "author": "Brooke I."}

I write this in the hope that the restaurant manager will identify the hostess working that night.\n\nMy girlfriend organized an amazing surprise birthday party for me and ten friends. This had been planned for over two weeks. \n\nUpon arrival, we were informed that we were \"inexcusably late\" by the hostess (note we arrived at 6:35pm for a 6:30 reservation). She told us that she had stated on the phone earlier we needed to be at the restaurant at 6:30 on the dot. However, upon followup we found that \"policy\" was never stated - we were five minutes late and didn't think it would cause an issue.\n\nHere is what ensued:\n- I had to get involved (it was my birthday) and tell her we needed to be seated.\n- Only upon threat of a bad Yelp review did she listen to us.\n- Upon being seated, service was poor, taking our drink order over twenty minutes after initially being seated.\n- We were also informed that, because we were \"late,\" we would need to be out of the seats by 8:30. \n\nNote the last point was not a big issue, we can eat in two hours. But for them to give us such an attitude was unforgivable. The food was alright; it reminded me of a cheap quality (but overpriced) version of Fogo de Chau. \n\nIt made no sense why you rushed us, Limon. You weren't even full on a Saturday. You ruined my birthday and I will be outspoken in my belief that you are a poor eating establishment. There are such better options in this area - avoid Limon at all costs.\n\nPlease speak with the server who was working at 6:30pm on Saturday, October 13th. Shame on you.", "author": "Andrew M."}

They had been before and enjoyed it so we were excited to give it a try. At first, I was questioning whether I was really about to pay upwards of $20 for a rotisserie chicken but decided to go with it and I am glad I did. Absolutely one of the best rotisserie chickens I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Cooked perfectly and excellent flavor.\n\nEmpanadas\nPollo - ehhh... not impressed... pass\nCarne - better but still not worth it for me, I believe it was $7 for two little empanadas\n\nTacu Tacu - everyone else seemed to really enjoy this and I was just wishing for my own rice and beans. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I didn't see what the fuss was about.\n\nSweet potato fries - they were sweet potato fries, 'nuff said. Hard to go wrong here.\n\nAnicucho de Lengua - wow, wow, wow... this was the second star of the night for me after the chicken. I had never had beef tongue before but I am sure glad I decided to try it here. I wouldn't be able to tell you if that is how it is supposed to be cooked, but I sure hope so because it was freaking good. The mashed potatoes with this dish were pretty phenomenal as well.\n\nAll in all, definitely worth a visit. Busy place so make reservations! Get the beef tongue!", "author": "John F."}

Limon is a charming restaurant in Mission district, serving Peruvian food so good that it makes me want to lick my plate clean and drink every drop of their delicious sangria!\n\nDon't forget to start your meal with a pitcher of sangria -- a glass will disappear quickly.  :)  \n\nI have been to Limon three times so far and my \"go to's\" are definitely the rotisserie chicken and sangria.  You really can't go wrong with those two.  Order the half chicken (to share for two) and you'll receive fantastic melt-in-your-mouth, juicy chicken.  The skin is perfection!  The chicken comes with a trio of sauces (aji amarillo, rocoto, and chimichurri), which send this dish above and beyond expectation.  I wind up asking for an extra order every time because I wind up dipping everything in it!  You are also offered two side dishes.  We ordered the tacu tacu and yucca fries, good pairings, but don't let them distract you from this chicken.  Yum!\n \nOther dishes that I've tried include the chicharron de pollo, a fried chicken dish that hints at Asian cuisine undertones (I definitely detect soy sauce).  The dish is served as a mound of chicken with red onions stacked at the top.  Good for snackin'\n\nSeco de Costillas is a very hearty, homey, braised beef short ribs dish, that just warms my soul! \n\nOverall, most of the dishes have a similar flavor profile.  If you like one dish here, you will probably find some additional favorites!  To top it off, the service here is quick, the food is well priced, and the ambiance...like I said, charming.  :)  I would come to Limon on a date, to catch up with friends over lunch or dinner -- basically, anytime!", "author": "Kathleen W."}

Timing also seemed to be within our favor as I was picturing the place to be jam-packed before we arrived, but we found parking directly in front and were immediately seated.\n\nCeviche Mixto: was tangy, fresh, cool, and perfectly complimented the sunny weather outside. Lots of pieces of Calamari which was fantastic, some places skimp out on this which is so quintessential of Ceviche Mixto for me.\n\nLomo Saltado: tender and savory, maybe a few less pieces of meat (not that I am complaining) and more tomatoes slices for acidity would have made this more balanced.  Although, I already knew that this dish is traditionally meat heavy, so that's just my whitewhine.\n\nChicharron de Pollo: succulent, moist, and was perfect with my beer on the side.\n\nThis place is inexpensive, definitely great value for the amount of food.

First I get there (with my group of friends) We had a reservation at 7pm on a Friday. I get Friday is a busy day for restaurants, but thats why we made a reservation!! So we're talking to the host who couldn't look happier to be at work ( Im being sarcastic). She told us the table was almost ready Ok Im fine with waiting no problem. As we were waiting I couldn't help but notice this same host get on the phone and she obviously was not talking to a guest. She ignored some of the guest coming in as she was still on the phone, to what seemed like she was arguing with someone. We finally get seated  ( after waiting 20min)  she walks us over to our table and put's the menu down and walks away. Ok I remember being a host as a teenager and I was always friendly! You are the face of the restaurant you have to make your guest feel welcomed, and we did not feel welcomed at all. Our waiter came around maybe 3 times to our table. We waited for ever for our drinks. I had not seen my friends for a long time so I wasn't going to let that ruin our day.\n\nOur food get's there, and as always it's AMAZING!

A couple of the friends I was dining with had been there and thought the food was very good, so I went ahead and made OpenTable reservations for the 4 of us for a Saturday night.\n\nI was the first to arrive (5 min early), and though it was early enough in the evening for there to be several available tables, the hostess told me I'd have to wait to be seated until my entire party arrived. This is always irritating to me - that's why I made a darn reservation. I don't mind waiting if the table isn't ready, but there were definitely some tables available within sight. In the meantime, people coming in without reservations were told to seat themselves at the bar if they so wished - again, not seated at the empty tables. If they weren't going to seat customers with reservations at those empty tables, nor walk-ins, then who in the world were the tables waiting for?\n\nAnyway, my party was assembled less than 5 minutes after my reservation time; yet it took another 5 minutes before I could even get the attention of the hostess - she had her hands full with another customer annoyed by the loss of her reservation. Tip to Lim\u00f3n: if you're going to bother taking reservations (and I can understand why you might not choose to, as obviously the restaurant is very very busy!), you really need to have a better handle on the whole reservations process.\n\nAnyway, we were eventually seated downstairs, in a back corner right next to a long party table with fourteen people, including some kids. The acoustics were astounding - you'd think being in a corner would be a good thing, but all we could hear was the loud conversations of the party next to us, and were reduced to shouting to each other across the small table. We're young enough to not be too annoyed by noise, and if it had been 11:00 p.m. at a nightclub, it would've been just fine. But it was not at all conducive to pleasant dining and conversation.\n\nWe would've happily stayed for a while and run up a larger tab - the cocktails were really good and the food was pretty decent, though not extremely rave-worthy, and our server was harried but he tried to do a good job - drinks and food arrived erratically but he was very nice about it. But the noise and hurry-up plate clearing were not welcoming and really overwhelmed the whole experience. To the point where normally I can tell you exactly what we ate and who enjoyed what - now, all I can really remember is the lackluster service with our seating, and the noise of the basement.\n\nIf you're a party of 14 and want to go out, I can see why Lim\u00f3n would be a good alternative to some place like Cha Cha Cha or Bucca di Beppo. Honestly, that's what it ended up feeling like to me. And that's not really a compliment in my book. If I went again because I'd want to try the food again, I'd go as a party of 1 or 2 on a Monday night and insist on being seated on the main floor, and see how it goes.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Our waiter forgot to bring out 2 of our dishes \n+ There's a fee per person if you bring a cake for someone's birthday!

The Ensalada was also refreshing and light. We also enjoyed the seafood Jaleo which was crispy without feeling greasy.

This was the first place I dined at that exposed me to Peruvian food... since then I've become a ceviche fiend! Place can get pretty packed but they have additional seating downstairs as well. Service... can be a hit or miss. I remember getting pretty good service when I first came here, but recently for fathers day, the service was kind of lacking. I love the ceviche here, the mixto and the leche tigre are my favorites here. Flavorful and the right amount of acid that brings it to the next level! The chicken here is amazing! Yeah... it's a bit pricey for chicken... but it's flavorful, moist, and the pieces are pretty big compared to other places where the chicken looks like it's been starved. The waiter got us to order some special with fries under and fried chicken pieces and some sauce drizzled over as an appetizer... and I actually really liked it. I just wish he wasn't talking so fast so I knew what exactly I said yes to ordering! Yucca fries here are good, nice plump pieces. Yeah, it's only 4 pieces... but it's large enough where you can cut it up and everyone gets a piece! The sauces to dip the chicken and fries are really good too... savor it though, cause it costs money to refill that sauce! The lomito saltado I would probably skip, just because it was kind of dry and compared to the other dishes, it just didn't stand out in flavor. The beef tongue here is really good and I would definitely recommend to anyone! You can't even tell that it's tongue and they made it pretty tender, so it's not chewy like other times when you may be eating tongue. Besides, it's pretty flavorful, so you would think you're eating beef if you didn't know it was tongue! Now the paella... I would skip. I've had some really good paella but limon disappointed me in that department. The rice was soggy, flavor of the rice kind of reminded me of when I was a kid and eating rice-a-roni (ah, those were the days) and they're pretty skimpy on the seafood. Nothing too special, unless you're really craving rice-a-roni. Finally, we got the grilled skirt steak which wasn't anything special, but I would order that over the saltado. The skirt steak was sitting in a puddle of sauce, which wasn't bad but I felt that it overpowered the steak. \n\nOverall, the meal was good and.

I called on a Saturday to inquire about the wait for a 9 pm arrival and the hostess promptly put me \"on hold\" for 10+ minutes, meaning she put the phone down while she continued to chat with guests, seat people, etc. Not once but TWICE. It was extremely rude! My fiance was pissed and vowed to never come here.\n\nThe following week, our friend asks us to go to Limon for a post-work dinner. I told my sweetie we're going to dinner at a Peruvian restaurant. \"Sounds good!\" \n\nWe arrive and it hits him, \"wait a minute....\" \n\nHaha, too late!\n\nWe were greeted by the hostess. It was a weekday and it was 6 pm. Only three tables were occupied. We were the only two of our party to arrive. She refused to seat us until our whole party arrives. In the meantime, I wanted to get a drink. The bar was full. Trying to convince her to seat the two of us first was like pulling teeth out. She had the power and did not want to relinquish it. Finish, she let us sit.\n\nLuckily our waiter was WAY cooler. When he put our tables together, I could tell she was unhappy but oh well. We weren't going to let her ruin our evening. Our waiter was phenomenal and provided excellent service. We promptly ordered a pitcher of sangria. The sangria was really strong with little alcohol taste. Within minutes, my Asian glow appeared and without any food in my stomach, I was giggling out of control by the time our friends arrived.\n\nAnyhow, we ordered the Ceviche Mixto with slices of halibut, calamari, and a tiger shrimp http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?userid=pYXjk01AkHFaUWrCGvkz1w, which was very good!

The Lomito Satado http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=RlZ3AnTSIYeik_EJwnMVnA wasn't very impressive. It's pretty much stir-fried slices of steak, Asian style.

Rice, please!\n\nOverall, very trendy Peruvian restaurant with bad parking. They need a friendlier hostess who doesn't put people on hold when she could have responded in 2 seconds because she's lazy and wants to keep her phone from ringing and who doesn't seat partial parties when the place is practically empty.

Sweet po fries were standard and I enjoyed the tacu tacu. The lomito and mac were good as well. I guess that would be the thing about me for this place. Everything we ordered was fine, but it wasn't too memorable. \n\nI think the noise may have contributed to the experience as well. Being in the backroom in particular, the sounds are just bouncing off the concrete walls. It'd be fine if I were in a dedicated bar or club, but ...I'm trying to eat. Also, dimness is kinda weird. It's like trying to hide what the food looks like. But like I said, the food wasn't bad and I do appreciate the accommodations.", "author": "Arnold H."}

The experience, overall, was mediocre. The food was good but not good enough to make up for the terrible service we received. It took an average of 30 minutes to receive something you had asked for from your server and then we were slammed with the inclusion of a 20% tip (for a party of 6?!?), which I was unaware of from the beginning, upon receiving the bill. So, thanks for that!\n\nOne thing that really rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that they wouldn't seat us until our full party of 6 was there. So, the 5 of us had to huddle around the inside of the front door because our friend missed her bus. To me, it seems they would want to seat 5 young, fun girls immediately so they start ordering drinks and rack up the tab. But, whatevs!\n\nProbably won't be back.", "author": "Landra S."}

We showed up @ 7:00PM to put our names down to eat, lady told us 35-45 minutes. We left and came back after 20 and hung around the bar for our seats. We had 5 in our party and figured it wouldn't take too long. \n\nLet's begin.\n\ndrinks ordered, round of pisco sours, yum, drink of choice at this place, get it. 30minutes later, waitlist hasn't budged one name. round 2 of pisco sours, with 2 appetizers, yucca fries, double yum. 30 minutes later, really hungry now. Asked the host what the deal was and she said that reservations take up the whole place and IF there are tables, then they refer to the waitlist, otherwise the reservations get tables first. This is when we start to get really angry, this policy is fine, and it's great that they can work off reservations only all night, but it's absolutely awful and not very great service orientation if you don't let the patrons know what the reality of the situation is. To tell us 30 and have us wait for 2 hours, didn't give us much an option of decide for ourselves how to organize our night, instead stood for and hour and a half. So we spent the last hour ordering at the bar instead and eating standing, which wasn't an issue but, had we known the wait was long, we wouldn't have been so frustrated. Anyways, after the food came we all were happy again (easily pleased crowd). We made the order simple, lots of orders of qtr chicken dark with tacu tacu and more yucca fries, veggie empanadas, truffle mac & cheese and ceviche. Mac and cheese was definitely amazing, its always nice to eat a super creamy mac n cheese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-10", "description": "More like 3.5 stars. \n\n\nThis was the first time my finance and I ate Peruvian food. A friend recommended Limon to us as being \"nice laid back ambience, delicious food, having many small plates to try.\" The ambience at Limon is laid back with cute modern decor, good background music and had a cozy feeling to it. The food is good but it was not anything special, the desserts were much better as they seem to make everything fresh. The plates were definitely small, but I can't fault the place as they serve tapes style entrees, which by definition is small plates. \n\nWe came here for lunch and was able to get a table easily. There is only street parking around this location and I considered parking hard to find as every street looked full. Their might be more spaces during the evening or on weekdays but the restaurant is in a residential area. \n\nSome of the reviews mention coming in groups. I would think your groups are small, as this restaurant seems to better cater to couples or groups of four or less, unless there is another room somewhere in the back. \n\nFor your value, order the chicken meal. The half-chicken meal and full chicken meals seems to be the largest sized portion at Limon. If you are looking to leave with a full, heavy appetite then you will probably feel disappointed. This place is perfect for a light lunch or dinner, possibly even an expensive snack for the heavy eaters. \n\nWe ordered the Carne Empanada, Chicharron de pollo, Carne a la Parilla, and an order of sweet potato fries. The entrees all looked appealing as they were nicely decorated on the plates. Presentation really seemed to matter, except for the chicken special. I guess you can't really fancy up roasted chicken. \n\nFirst, to arrive was the order of sweet potato fries and a pair of Carne Empanadas. Sweet potato fries was good, lightly salted, crispy on the outside and was enough to share with another person. The empanadas were good and had plenty of steak but the size is about two and a half mouth sized bites big. I could have finished both off with no trouble as an appetizer. \n\nI was taken aback by the plate size of the Chicharron de pollo as it was small. The plate seemed enough for me alone and I was kind of expecting the chicken to be the size of their special pollo plate. The size was equivalent to a large breast piece served at KFC. The chicken seemed to be fried two times, where the skin was crispy on the outside and the meat was tender on the inside but not juicy. \n\nThe Carne a la Parilla was skirt steak with some type of tasty wine sauce served next to a Taku Taku, which happens to be rice and beans mashed together, lightly floured on the outside and deep-fried. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium.\n\nFinally, we ordered dessert, which happened to be the best part of the meal. It took a while for the dessert to arrive and I think they make it fresh. We ordered what seem to bite size cream puffs with fresh cream in the middle, drizzled with caramel and cream sauce. Super yummy and can see myself ordering this again. \n\nOverall, the meal was light and kind of on the pricey side for lunch prices per couple. It's about $20 per person after tax and tip. Since I'm not from the area I probably wouldn't be back but it was a good experience. The service was good as water glasses were refilled when empty and plates were removed when done. There was no long wait time or having to waive down anyone. \n\nSummary:\n\nPluses: Good freshly made desserts, good service, fresh and tasty food, great presentation on food, light lunch. \n\nMinuses: Street parking, price (price vs. portion size ratio), tapes style (individual snack sizes to share).", "author": "David Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-11", "description": "I came here for a friend's going away get-together on Wednesday, June 11, 2014. My review is mostly about the service versus the food. We were a party of 8 originally and we had an unexpected guest join us. Here are my reviews about the night:\n\nOur reservation was at 7:00, but a few of us were late, and were seated around 7:30 in the downstairs dining room, not a problem at all. To be fair, the server, Sergio, was initially prompt in coming to get our drink order and bring water to the table. However, when the 9th guest arrived, not one single person assisted us in bringing a chair, a menu, or water for him the entire evening. We just grabbed the chair and place setting from the table next to us. \n\n When we finally did decide to put our order in, we had asked for all the ceviches and nightly special, the grilled octopus, to come first, with the family style chicken, sides, and Mac n cheese to come after. After a few minutes, ALL the food came out together. A few members of our party commented on the fact that we had asked for an appetizer course, but all came together. I would like to note that all the food was amazing! The chicken, the grilled octopus and the truffle Mac n cheese were my personal favorites (my two stars goes to the food and cocktails). Once the food arrived, our server asked if we would like any more cocktails, in which we ordered more pisco sours. After the drinks were dropped off (by I presume a drink runner), we did not see our server again until the table had been cleared.\n\nAs a person who works in the restaurant industry in different types of environments (ranging from casual to fine dining), not ONCE did our server refill water. My husband got up to ask the bartender TWICE to refill water. No matter what type of restaurant you work in, failure to refill water is the first sign of poor service in this city. After Sergio asked if we wanted anything else, one person asked for the dessert menu, and was completely ignored. After a few moments, the check was dropped with a 20% automatic gratuity. I didn't have a chance to ask Sergio for the dessert menu because he disappeared, in which one of the members of my party decided that it was ok to not have dessert. A few moments later, we wrote on the back of the check the amounts per card via last name on the card. The check was picked by someone other than Sergio (whom I found out later was the \"closing manager on duty\") told us that only 4 cards could be run at a time. As a server I understand this policy, but this should be understood when the check is dropped, if at all, rather than once payment has been given to a server with writing on the back for easiest convenience. On a side note, it is my understanding that the IRS changed its auto gratuity for the country as of January 1st, 2014. I'm not sure if Limon is one of the few restaurants left in the city who sill charges auto gratuity, but they did. After a few minutes of debate, they ran the 6 cards for us.\n\nI assume the restaurant closed at 10, and we as a group hung out to talk for a bit. About 20-30 min after 10, the person who was originally the drink runner, came and cleared all the water glasses off the table. As a server, that is a HUGE no-no! You refill water until 2 am if you have to! Once we paid, we felt as if we were being pushed out, despite my husband getting up to ask for water AGAIN. \n\nI didn't want to say anything while my friend's guests were talking and enjoying their drinks and food, so after the water glasses were removed, I went upstairs to ask for a a manager. I found out the manager already went home for the night and the gentleman who removed our water glasses was the closing manager for the evening. I can't recall his name, however, I proceeded to explain our service throughout the evening. He told me that this wasn't fine dining service and that their style of service was casual. I angrily explained to him that I did not want compensation, but merely to point out how neglected we felt in certain instances and pushed out towards the end (which was 10:45 mind you). He apologized and offered the manager's card, but I'm not sure what good that would have done, so I politely refused.\n\nI hope they can fix the service because there is potential there. Sergio was nice, but forgot a few basic steps of service which ultimately impacted our experience. But the food and cocktails were great. I hope they figure it out so we can feel comfortable coming back.", "author": "Danielle P."}

Next, we shared a half rotisserie chicken (good for 2-4 people) - yum!  The flavoring of the spices and slow cooking makes this chicken soooo good, you must get this!  With the chicken, you get two sides so we ordered the yucca fries (crispy fried, hot, comes with 3 yummy sauces) and rice.  We also ordered a plate of the lomito saltado - this was gone in seconds!  Tender steak strips with tomatoes and fries in a tasty sauce - this was awesome over the rice.  And then we couldn't resist the Profiteroles - cream puffs with chocolate sauce drizzled over it (get this).  \n\nWe had a great time catching up and eating tasty Peruvian food.

Finally decided on 4 stars because the signature dish is the best roasted chicken I've had. \n\nLooking around the restaurant, it appeared that everyone ordered either the 1/2 chicken or the whole chicken. Both choices comes with 2 sides. \n\nMy husband & I came with another couple. We decided on the 1/2 chicken since we wanted to try some other small plates. Well, later we regretted it. Shoulda had the whole chicken. It was that good. For our sides, we chose the veggies and the yucca fries. The veggies were very good. \n\nAlso had 2 types of ceviches (ahi tuna and the mixed seafood); the anticuchos; the braised short ribs; the sweet potato fries; and lastly, we shared the warmed chocolate cake. \n\nThe guys each had a glass of wine; I had a mojito, and my girlfriend has the strawberry lemonade. All drinks priced reasonably. \n\nMemorable dishes - the chicken, the sweet potato fries; and the warm chocolate cake.  Chicken was flavorful and fork tender, even the breast meat.  Sweet potato fries had a little nice kick to it.  The cake was a nice dark chocolate and just enough to please the palate.\n\nAverage dishes - the ceviche. Don't get the ahi tuna. You can barely find it on the plate. The mixed seafood one was better.  And the braised short ribs tasted just o.k.\n\nImprovement needed - the pace of the food. Everything came all at once. Gave us the feeling we were at a fast food joint. Our friend called it \"McLimon\". They should serve the cold plates first if the table orders it; let us savor the food with our drinks; then bring the hot foods. We felt we were eating at a buffet. \n\nTo their credit, we were able to enjoy our warmed chocolate cake with our coffees at a leisurely pace.  Maybe because we had to wait for the dessert which typically takes 15-20 minutes to cook in the oven.  Coffee was refilled as needed.\n\nFinal word about the pace - tables turned over quickly and there wasn't much of a wait when we arrived at 6 p.m.  So don't quite understand the urgency to bring the food quickly and clear the used plates while we're attempting to enjoy our dining experience.\n\nEach couple paid $56.00 inc. tax & tip.\n\nAnd final word - better to sit in the main dining room on street level than to go down to the basement dining area.", "author": "Shirley N."}

But no, this was my first time having Peruvian food and boy was that menu foreign to me.\n\nArmed with my seasoned friends, they took the liberty of ordering a total of 8 dishes.  Given that these were all tapas, we were able to try more of the menu out.  Surprisingly the food came out really fast and all together.  Though this was around 6:30 p.m. and we had a reservation so the restaurant was just starting to fill up for dinner time.\n\nThe simplest things, relatively speaking turned out to be my favorites, such as the Truffle Mac and Cheese, Yuca fries, and their special for the night- the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  Everything else was exceptional, but this being my first time I'm hesitant to give 5 stars right off the bat.  \n\nI've already made it known that I will come back again, maybe to one of their other locations and try other Peruvian food around the city.

We could have waited for an upstairs spot, but we didn't want to spend the extra time. \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive--until a large group of 30 or so people arrived and took his time. Fortunately this was near the end of our meal and the main effect was waiting a long time to receive our check. This huge group did make the loud basement room pretty loud, though, so conversation with my companion became more challenging.\n\nThe food came within a few minutes of ordering and was average overall. The best things were the roasted chicken, the sauces, and the profiterole dessert; the tacu tacu and salad side dishes were nice accompaniments. The beef in the lomito was not tender, and the ceviche fish did not have the firmness I prefer and was pretty acid tasting. (It's possible to have a nuanced citrus flavor in ceviche, but this was straight lemon.)\n\nOverall, I'd say this is pretty average Peruvian food. It had more of a feel of a small chain restaurant (which it is) than a quality eatery.

I definitely wouldn't suggest this for a first date on a Saturday night because it could not have possibly been any louder.  Pretty fun atmosphere for large groups.  I came in with a party of 14...anything over 12 deems it mandatory to get the prefixed menu (choose between a $25 or $30 multi course meal).  We got a nice corner table that fit our group very well.  The booths are a little low so choose a chair if you have issues with leaning back into oblivion (essentially).  \n\nWe started off with the ceviche and marinated tuna.  Spices were on point and it was a good portion to tie down the forces but left us with an appetite for more.   Fish dish was followed by grilled beef bites marinated in steak sauces along with the garnishing fries.  Roasted chicken as OK...I preferred the leg over the dry breast but the sauces definitely added a kick!\n\nI think there may have been a spinach salad in there somewhere too.  \n\nPrefixed menu was serviced family style which made it pretty fun in my opinion.

The only way you could have gotten a smile on this guy was if you stapled the sides of his mouth to his cheek bones.

The lower level then filled up pretty quickly, and we still hadn't put in our orders. Finally, we ordered 3 drinks at the same time that we placed our food order. We eventually had to ask about the status of our drinks (a bottled beer, a pre-made sangria, and a WATER), because they hadn't come out after about 30 minutes. The food took even longer. Some of the servers were nicer than others, giving us false hope that our food and drinks were going to come out any second. I think the \"family-style menu,\" as they name it, means that they take the orders of all the parties in the room, cook the food all at once, and bring out everything as it's completed. So, we had our meal in parts. The whole ordeal took about 2.5 hours.\n\nIf you do go, the rotisserie chicken is a must. So moist and flavorful. Two of us split a half, and it was a sufficient amount. Comes with two baby-sized sides, so we ordered 2 more sides. The yucca fries were tasty and not overly fried. The tacu-tacu was also great. The plain arroz was garlicky, in a good way. The chicharron de pollo was pretty tough, and we didn't care for it as much. The sangria was alright, served in a smaller cup.\n\nAll-in-all, the food was delicious, but the wait was excruciating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-07", "description": "This restaurant is on the short list of places I take out-of-towners that I want to impress. Their food is delicious, and encourages a more communal dining experience than is the norm in restaurants. The inclusion of three dipping sauces with a portion of roast chicken encourages experimentation, and also allows a degree of customization to the meal without having to bother the waitstaff. \n\nIn particular, I'd recommend getting a 1/4 roast chicken, with their Leche Tigre Cocktail, Ensalada, and Yucca Fries. Even with a drink each, you're not looking at much for an enjoyable night out for two. For a party of four scale up the size of the chicken to whole, and add a hot plate or two: the lomito saltado and aji de gallina are both fine choices. \n\nOne place I would say this place is a bit weak on is desserts: its menu feels staid and out-of-date, which isn't enough to compete with the multitude of nearby places that only sell desserts. Also, I would not bring a vegetarian here, or by the end of the night you will have a very unhappy tofu-muncher who's eaten nothing but a salad with rice and beans. \n\nWith these small quibbles in mind, I still can think of few places in San Francisco that match Limon in terms of atmosphere, price, and quality. Now if you'll excuse me I need to plan my next trip there, because nothing says TGIF like a pisco sour and a chicken thigh roasted to perfection.", "author": "Aaron Y."}

I asked for a better place but they said they were cleaning the walls(?) and sat in tiny table for two\nIt took awhile before waiter came by to take order and Hostess was no where to be found, instead she was in the kitchen yakking away in Spanish. It is embarrassing because I understood their personal business.\nMy husband is Peruvian and we thought we give it one more try boy we were wrong!\nB. Could I hear what the waitron said? The waiter was not so polite but was just rushing us to order. \n   \nC. What was the physical condition of the menu: The menu was simple and easy to read.\n  \nD. Can I form a good idea of what I order from the descriptions and language in the menu? Yes it was pretty easy to order.\n\nE. Was the waitron able to answer all my inquiries? Not really was just running around like a chicken with it's-head cut off. No organization at the place and as I mentioned everyone was speaking in Spanish and I could hear all the personal business of the staff.\n    \nF. When the waitron served my food, did it make me feel:\n   Not good hardly exchanged words.\n    G. Did the food live up to the promises made in the restaurant's promotional material, advertising and menu?\n    Absolutely Not!!  They call this Peruvian Food my husband was greatly disappointed . His family always cooks Peruvian Food and we have tried\nall restaurants in San Francisco, Food was Greasy and Salty... and had no flavor as the typical Peruvian Food It was a total disappointment \n    \nH. What was the standard of the waitron's service?\n    Decent but had no personality whatsoever \n   \nI.  What was my experience of the billing process from asking for it to paying it?\n   They brought bill right away we felt a bit hurried.\n   \n\nJ. What was my overall experience of the visit to the restaurant?\n     \nThe is probably the worst restaurant we've ever had the displeasure in which to dine. The food was almost inedible (Food was not typical Peruvian ; it was very Salty and Greasy  and appetizers un appeasing  and flavorless), the lighting is poor to nonexistent  and  service was extremely lacking; the place was loud and crowded  to have a  conversation was impossible.

When my party of 5 (we were actually 6) got there, they told me that I was not on the reservation list, that they did not see my name, and then turned and continued looking at the screen. I told them that I had made a reservation for 5 people at 7:30 pm and that I needed to be seated to which one of the staff responded, \"We are all booked for tonight. We have been booked for a few days.\" They wondered if I had called and made the reservation at the other location on Valencia Street. I looked at my phone call record and told them that I had called their location and that a woman had contacted me to confirm the appointment. I asked to speak with the Manager. They made me wait for a few minutes. The manager showed up with no apology and told me that she could place me on the wait list but that she did not know how long it would take for us to get seated. After checking in with my party, we decided to leave. We ended up going to another Peruvian restaurant that welcomed us with respect; we were able to have a nice meal, and conversation. So glad we moved on, Limon was just too overcrowded and noisy. Why we went there? Because my mom, who is Peruvian, wanted to try the roasted chicken.\n\nWhy we are no coming back? Because of the poor, unapologetic, disrespectful customer service from very unprofessional staff. Nope.\n\nTo the Staff who treated me and my party so rudely: Acknowledge you made a mistake, be truthful to yourself and your customers, validate your customers' inquiries, apologize, be kind. You can only succeed in this type of business if you are nice.

Friendly and welcoming.  She convinced us to sit.  And after dinner she recommended reservations on the weekend, gave us a card and also a discount for another location. thumbs up!\n\nWe took all her recs, pretty much.

The host recommended all of those and we ordered the truffle mac and cheese (again, peruvian? who cares, it was heaven)\n\nMore than enough food to fully satisfy two people.  The sauteed veggies were surprisingly delicious, and the chicken was pretty much the best rotisserie I've had with a bright and flavored pack bite.  They give you three dipping sauces-- one spicy, one mild, and one that is oil based and all full of flavor.  I dipped my chicken and my yucca into every one, alternating so as not to favor one over the other, didn't want to hurt any feelings.\n\nThis place is lively, so if you're looking to have a quiet convo, go elsewhere.

We both thought that the food must be amazing if the wait time on a Monday night was so long. Once seated the first thing I noticed that you can order a whole rotisserie chicken and two sides for only $15.95. \nThat's two legs, two wings, two thighs, and two breasts plus two sides for only $15.95. That deal was way too good to pass up so I decided to order it. \n\nI was a little worried that the some parts of the rotisserie chicken may be dry but to my surprise every piece (even the white meat) was super juicy, in fact it may have been the juiciest rotisserie chicken I have ever eaten. The Peruvian spices that have been rubbed on the chicken are spectacular. They chicken also comes with two dipping sauces. The first sauce tasted like a cilantro sour cream sauce and the second was kind of like a honey Dijon. Both of these sauces were super tasty. \n\nFor my sides I went with their Yuca Frita, and their tacu-tacu. \nThe Yuca's were like big French fries, except way better. They were super crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. These things actually melted in my mouth, they were awesome. The tacu-tacu are little oval shaped rolls that are fried, and filled with rice and beans. These things are also really good. \n\nLike I said before the prices at Limon are great. My entire bill for all that food and a diet coke came to less than $20 dollars. The service here was also really good. It only took about ten minutes for our meals to be brought to us after we had ordered them. \n\nLimon is a fantastic restaurant, I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the bay area. Just make sure you go with a huge appetite because if you don't you may leave with half a chicken in a dogie bag. \n\nP'S- I was so full that I did not even get to order a dessert.

Salad was standard, though the veggies that consisted of string beans and bell peppers sauteed in soy sauce was really good. \n\nLastly, the truffle mac and cheese($6.25). Not kraft out of the box mac and cheese.  Small elbow macaroni in a light cream/cheese sauce topped with grated parmesan with a strong hint of truffle oil.

The food is delicious and hearty, everything served family-style.  \n\nFirst off, the ceviche is effing FANTASTIC. My boyfriend and I have been to Peru and this was one of the closest ceviches to those we tasted in Lima. We ordered the ceviche de pescado y camaron.  The snapper and shrimp were large portions and Limon's \"Leche de Tigre\" marinade was delicious! The ceviche was even served with a side of boiled sweet yam and large Peruvian white corn kernels, just like they do in LIma. \n\nThe half rotisserie chicken was more than enough for 2 people, especially when paired with the 2 sides and 3 dipping sauces.  I can see why some people's tastes might find the chicken to be on the salty side, but I have a salty palate and thought it was very tasty and well-seasoned.  They have rotisserie chicken down to a science here and it shows. The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful.  The 2 sides we ordered, sweet potato fries and tacu-tacu (beans mixed with white rice), paired well with the chicken.  \n\nI wasn't wowed by the Seco de Castillas (braised boneles beef short ribs with huacatay and cilantro, served with potatoes carrots and English peas) and the Sangria. The chicken is the star here!", "author": "Monelle A."}

BUT NOOO one of the servers took us to this magical place downstairs and I found that they have an underground bar and extra seating there. COOL!\n\nSo my group ordered half a chicken with yuca (kinda like large potato fries but yummier) and tacu tacu (which is sort of mashed rice in my opinion), lomito saltado... and two other things that I cannot remember for some reason. I think we ordered this one steak dish that was served over tacu tacu and a chicken dish with a yummy sauce but man SORRY READERS but I really can't remember the names of it.\n\nBUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING WE ORDERED WAS DELICIOUS!!!!! Seriously, I've never had Peruvian food before and if this is what Peruvian food tastes like, I wouldn't mind having it everyday!\n\nBUT BE WARNED the portions are TINY!!!! I honestly felt like I came here for snacking and not dinner.. and I was accompanied with 4 men. FORTUNATELY the biggest men of the group weren't hungry and I think all 4 dudes were aware that I was the hungriest there so they all let me eat as much as I wanted... But alas I was not full nor satisfied and wanted more.. But it was already pricey and we ordered alot so we decided to just stop there...\n\nBUT MAN if I was a rich person (or a person with a job) I would have TOTALLY ordered more food! IT TASTES SO GOOD!! SERIOUSLY! LOVE the flavors here! Can't wait to come back here again when I have more money!\n\nOh yeah before I dinner I had a mango lemonade which was good too, but I rather save my money and get food with it next time.. wait but then again my friend paid for my drink.. ah I feel bad for wasting his money!", "author": "Rebecca K."}

So I finally had the chance because my partner took me here for my birthday. \n\nWe went to the South Van Ness location. Nice atmosphere. We had reservations so our table was waiting for us. We almost ordered the rotisserie chicken they are known for, but I really wanted to try a lot more items so we opted for the small plates. First up came the ceviche mixto. Yum perfectly yummy and citrucy, delicious. Then we moved on to the hot plates. We wanted items that would go well with the bottle of Malbec we ordered. We got the chicharron de pollo, seco de costillas (short ribs), aguadito de pollo (basically chicken soup), and truffle mac n cheese. We were most excited about the chicharron because table next to us was raving about it, and it looked good. Well, it was ok. It's just fried pieces of chicken, like chicken fingers. It wasn't crunchy like the name suggests. The chicken soup was unfortunately very bland. The short ribs were ok. I liked the mac n cheese, my partner really disliked it..I think because it had rosemary in it. I'm assuming the chicken they used for the dishes were from the rotisserie chicken? If so, maybe it was good we skipped it. It was so bland. \n\nOverall, I liked the atmosphere of the place. Service was great. I really appreciated our experience yet I was not wowed by it.

We ended up waiting over 20min for a table, and then an additional 10min for them to find chairs for us. The wait time really wouldn't have been a big deal if they had been more organized and if they didn't have ridiculously RUDE waiters. One in particular kept on shoving/elbowing me and my friend as he walked by. He said sorry once or twice, but then repeatedly shoved us HARD. Come on, we're a bunch of little Asian girls, I'm pretty sure you could walk around us fairly easily. And if you can't, then you could just ask nicely for us to move instead of being so rude.\n\nAnyway, on to the food. We ordered a mish mash of dishes. Obviously the chicken (nice flavor, a little too salty for me. Kind of dry... not as succulent as everyone says it is), as well as ceviche mixto (meh), lomito saltado (some pieces of beef were a little tough), chicharrones de  pollo (good, but its fried chicken, how can it not be good?), and some other stuff. The sweet potato fries were a crowd favorite-- it was the only dish to be devoured within a minute or two of being set on the table. Since we were celebrating a bday, we presented the bday girl with a molten chocolate cake. The cake itself was cold... it would have been more delicious is the chocolate that oozed out was warm. \n\nOverall: food was 3.5 stars, but service was terrible, so 2.5 stars.", "author": "Susanna W."}

A ton of my friends recommended Limon and so I went!\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCeviche Mixto - pretty good! The portion is very small for what you pay for. Well, I guess I'm comparing it to Peruvian standards.  In Peru, you can get a heaping plate of Ceviche Mixto for $5. In Limon, you get 10 bites of deliciously marinated seafood for $9.75.  Ah, tis a sad sad life we live in SF.\n\nAnticuchos de Res (yes yes, that's a grilled beef heart. What can I say, I like to eat their hearts out....be it cows, chickens, men...) - This was grilled nicely, the heart was tender and had that nice charred look, but very salty.  \n\nTruffle Mac and Cheese - Funny how the most un-Peruvian dish on the menu was the most delicious.  Highly recommend!\n\nCarne a la Parilla - The hanger steak was good, seasoned and grilled perfectly.  However, the tacu tacu was not.  Tacu tacu is supposed to be cooked with the outside rice being crispy and the inside being soft - like an M&M.  This tacu tacu was just mushy all around and was the biggest disappointment in the whole meal. \n\nMaracuya sour was very good and tasted just like ones I would get from Peru, although a bit too frothy with the egg white.  There was too much head in my Maracuya sour!

I've had Peruvian at some unsavory places in the Mission, but Limon is tops.  For some odd reason hole-in-the-wall Peruvian food in this town is not dirt cheap, so it doesn't even feel like you're overpaying here.\n\nLomito Saltado: The best lomo saltado I've had in San Francisco!  A very generous portion of the soy based sauce so the fries absorb a lot.  The meat is a lot more tender and tastier than what you get elsewhere... probably explains the price-to-portion ratio.  The tomatoes were super fresh and bright red, nothing translucent about them.  The red onion was cooked to be soft, but still a tad firm and retaining maximum flavor.\n\nPollo a la Brasa: As the cornerstone, this better be good!  The chicken is moist and tender, which isn't as common as you think with rotisserie chicken.  The skin is the big selling point, so many spices and flavors I won't even attempt to name them.  Even better than that Roli Roti cart!\n\nTacu-Tacu: This was disappointing.  It seemed deep fried like a tempura croquette rather than lightly pan fried without batter.  The insides were orange instead of the distinctive yellow that comes from aji amarillo and canary beans.  It's hard for me to analyze the bean mush, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was pinto.  Probably the biggest inauthenticity fail on the menu.\n\nYuca Frita: Decent by itself with a such soft center and lightly fried exterior.  Amazing with the creamy green and orange sauces!  Sad that most of this country is stuck on the less interesting potato fries with ketchup.\n\nSalsa Criolla: Served as a side with the chicken.  Normally not worth mentioning salsa separately, but this was awesome.  Thinly sliced red onions that remained tangy with a hint of chili.  The best part was that they had the pickled texture without being vinegary.  Great distinctive lime tones, almost like an onion ceviche.", "author": "Adam B."}

Having lived in NYC where there are a ton of Peruvian places, I've been looking for a good go-to in the South Bay / SF.  I think I have definitely found it at Limon!!  LOVED everything about this place.  The environment is chic, trendy and comfortable. What I also appreciated is that restaurants like this often are small and very limited table seating...but there is actually quite a bit of space here!!  The restaurant has space on 2 floors....there is a ton of space downstairs (in what I had originally just presumed to be a basement).  Also, the service was great!  We sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was super polite, attentive, answered our questions about the menu, and checked back with us constantly (in the right amount) to see how we were doing.\n\nThe food was DELICIOUS, and the drink menu was extensive.  A lot of the cocktails sounded yummy.   We ended up trying the Lomito Saltado (the FAVORITE of the night), Carne a la Parilla, Chicharon de Pollo, and Yucca Fries.  The yucca fries came with 3 different types of dipping sauces -- all very yummy, and were great to dip the meats in too.  We didn't love the chicken as much.  It was good, but nothing overly special or mind blowing.  Even though these were considered \"small plates,\" it was actually a lot of food, and we didn't end up having a pricey bill.  \n\n This will definitely be a go-to for the city in the future, and next time I want to try their drinks and other foods!!", "author": "Tiff K."}

It's cute, nice decor and ambiance, good service and a good menu.\n\nI have not explored their menu that extensively but here are some of the things that i really like at this place:\n - Pollo a la brasa.  It's very good.  Small though, but tasteful.  And it comes with 2 sides of your choice.\n- The Anticuchos are also very good.  It's not an easy task to find good anticuchos.\n- The Cebiche is pretty good.  Not the best i've ever had, but it's pretty good.\n- The empanadas, although fried, are tasty.  I definitely prefer baked empanadas.\n\nThe aj\u00edes that they serve are not that great really.  Which is surprising, given that Per\u00fa has a lot of diversity when it comes to aj\u00edes.  2 of them look the same and taste similar, and the third one is not even a peruvian aj\u00ed. I t's a chimichurri sauce, which is argentinian.\n\nThe maracuy\u00e1 sour was good.\n\nAnother bummer is that they didn't have any peruvian desserts.  They had mango panacotta, profiteroles and some chocolate cake.  This was disappointing.\n\nI would give Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie 3.5 stars.

There's a reason the chicken is on the 7x7 list but Limon rotisserie is not just about the food. My family and I hopped cabs to the Mission District for what we though would be a nice night out with good food. The 6 of us were blown away!  \n\nThe menu is simple with chicken served whole, half or in quarters and about a dozen nosh sized plates. Before we dove into the food, pitchers of sangria flowed into our glasses. Cold and refreshing we tried to absorb the Peruvian tapas. Too much to take in, Ricky, our waiter, offered his help and hand picked our menu with a 1/2 chicken. Perfect! I love this service but will I love the food?\n\nA mixed seafood ceviche, tuna tartar, Lomito which is a delicious beef stir-fry, garlic Tiger shrimp,  grilled hanger steak and veggies rolled out to the table in waves and at the end, there was a 1/2 of chicken to finish. No plate when back empty and the pitchers of sangria, well that goes without saying. \n\nWhile the food is 5 stars, the very reasonable prices and the service we receive with our \"personal\" tour of the menu puts Limon Rotisserie at the top of the top.

I reached root veggie fatigue about halfway through, so this might be a good option to share. \n\nVeggie Empanadas ($7.25) \nTwo empanadas stuffed with mushrooms, spinach, choclo and mascarpone cheese. There might have been peas inside too; it was quite green. And freakishly delicious. I would go back to Limon just to eat the empanadas.\n\nYuca Fries ($3)\nPretty standard yuca fries.

I didn't like the other cocktails (Pisco Sour and the Pa Bravo Yo) because they were way too sweet and syrupy. Next time, I will be ordering a pitcher of their yummy sangria.\n\nThe service was cool.  They served our food really fast and they made sure we had everything we needed.  They gave us three dipping sauces but they didn't tell us what they were so Loverboy and I played Russian Roulette dipping our chicken in the sauces. The roasted chicken was very juicy and delicious.  It had the perfect amount of seasoning and the half chicken was big enough for me and Loverboy to share.  For the two sides that came with our chicken, we ordered a side salad and Tacu-Tacu. The salad was nothing fancy so I suggest you skip that. I really wish I ordered the Yucca fries instead. The Tacu-tacu is basically flavored rice and it reminds me of the red Mexican rice that I love to buy at taquerias. The only difference between the Tacu-tacu and your regular Mexican rice is that the Tacu-tacu is a bit soggier and it has a gritty texture to it. The Tacu-tacu went really well with the roasted chicken and I wish the size was a bit bigger.\n\nWe also enjoyed the mac and cheese which was very savory and delightful.  I just wish the cheese sauce was a bit thicker.  The macaroni was cooked al dente and the size of the dish was perfect for a couple to share.\n\nThe lomito saltado was very beefy and flavorful but I found that the meat was kind of tough and chewy.  I don't mind that at all because the flavor makes up for the chewiness. I wasn't a fan of the fries that came with the lomito because they were a bit soggy.  The onions were slightly sweet and I think it paired well with the salty meat chunks.\n\nWe will definitely come back and try their other items.

Wow the chicken was to die for. So juicey and flavorful. I don't normally eat the chicken skin, but I had to with this one because it was so good.\n\nWe had the empanadas de carne which were quite tasty and then split a whole chicken.  We got the arroz and tacu tacu as sides and the rice was just fine but DON'T ORDER THE TACU TACU. It was terrible unless you like dry salty rice/bean mush balls.  I was tempted to take a star off for this because it was so bad but we just set that dish to the side and enjoyed the rest of the delicious dinner.\n\nThe restaurant is small and I'm not sure if they take call-aheads but we went on a Monday night so we had no wait. Fast friendly service. It's a cute modern restaurant with great food. Hands down the best rotisserie chicken I've had in I don't know how long.", "author": "Traci H."}

There were 4 of us in total, so we chose a few different things to try. Of course we had to get a whole rotisserie chicken with the veggies (Vegetales salteados I think?) and rice, the chicharron de pollo, and the seco de costillas. My bf got really excited when he saw chicha morada on the menu, so he ordered that to drink and really enjoyed it. I got the housemade lemonade, and it was light and refreshing.\n\nMy bro's favorite thing was the braised beef short ribs (seco de costillas), and my cousin and I both really liked the chicharron de pollo. The short ribs were super tender and moist. I've never really been a fan of short ribs because they usually turn out tough and dry, but this place did it right. It kind of reminded me of this one Filipino dish my mom makes. I don't remember what it's called, but it also has potatoes and carrots in it. \n\nI like fried things (who doesn't?) and the chicharron did not disappoint! My idea of chicharron is fried pork or chicken skin. Limon's chicharron was fried chicken skin, but it also had meat, which made it more satisfying than eating chicharron that are like chips. It came with some red onion salsa type thing which went perfectly with the crispy fried goodness of the chicharron.\n\nOverall it was really delicious. A bit pricey considering the amount of food we got (about $50 pre-tip for the whole meal), but it was yummy and my brother liked it, so it was all good with me.", "author": "Kristina O."}

It was perfectly cooked and the sauces combined with it gave it a unique flavor. However, my friends and I did not kill it like other dishes that we ordered that night. The ceviche was great to order and we could taste the freshness of it. Overall, everything was great and will be coming back here again when I'm in the area.

We made reservations at 5:30 for a table at 6:00 pm. They were able to accommodate us and we found parking right in front! Score!\n\nWe ordered the:\n\n1) \"Lomito Saltado\" which consisted of stir-fried sirloin strips, onions, tomatoes, soy sauce with french fries. The sauces was very flavorful and soaked the french fries and I normally don't like to eat saucy fries but these were good! The sirloin strips were a little bit salty (like what other Yelpers expressed) but it was still good. \n\n2) Rotisserie chicken (7x7 item) with 2 sides (yuca fries and vegetables salteados)  It was by far the best deal ever! It was $9.95 for half a chicken and two sides. First off, the chicken was soo tender and juicy and cutting into it was very easy. You can literally see the juices while cutting it. The skin was also marinated extremely well and added so much flavor to the chicken itself. The chicken also came with three dipping sauces. The Yuca fries came with four pieces of thick fried potato strips. The outside was crispy and fried to perfection while maintaing the mushy-ness of the inside. The vegetables were marinated in a delicious sauce and I almost ate all of it even though I am not a huge veggie eater.\n\nThe service is impeccable. I have never been to a restaurant with such decent prices with fantastic service. The waiters were very honest about the portions, he wasn't pushing us to order more. The owner or manager also kept checking up on us. The bus boys were very polite and kept our glasses full and politely asked us if we were finished. My boyfriend dropped his fork and the waiter brought him another one on a napkin cloth on a silver platter! LOL! \n\nOverall we had such a wonderful experience and cannot wait to return.

A few hours before our reservation, I found out another friend would be joining us, so I called the restaurant to change our reservation from a party of 2 to a party of 3. The host I spoke to had a bit of an attitude and was very huffy about changing the reservation, but acquiesced. \n\nOur reservation was for 8 PM and we were taking the BART in from Berkeley. My friend had miscalculated how long it would take to walk from the station to the restaurant, so we were a little late (but under the 15 minutes pretty much any restaurant would hold a reservation for if someone is running late). \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant, hungry and a little out of breath, to find out that our table had been given away. No call from the restaurant or anything (though, I guess we could've called them to let them know we were running slightly late, but we were in such a rush getting to the restaurant no one thought of it at the time).\n\nThe host (I assume the same one I talked to), told us that because we weren't there right at 8, they had given our table up (so, could have been even 5 minutes after 8, which seemed.... a bit too sticklerish for time). He seemed annoyed with the sight of us and wasn't accommodating at all. He said MAYBE he could get us a table, but it'd be at least a 30 minute wait. We said forget it, and looked up nearby restaurants on Yelp. We ended up at Frjtz, just a few blocks away and had a fantastic meal there.\n\nI don't think I plan on returning to Limon.", "author": "Danny H."}

Though I cannot vouch for her dish, I don't doubt there are hidden gems in their culinary repertoire. \n\nI blame the vague menu and bad marketing - sometimes the customer doesn't mind being told what to order, especially if that dish would result in repeat business. If I ever find myself hungry, on South Van Ness ave, and with little wait time i'd be willing to give Limon Rotisserie another go.", "author": "Jason O."}

They kept speaking to me in Spanish, because I look as though I would speak it (I don't). I should begin by saying that we were drunk upon entering. \n\nAfter a full day at the park, we decided tapas would be a great idea. There were 5 of us, and we had been drinking in the sun all day. My eyes bugged out of my head when I saw \"Peruvian\" on their awning. I am a HUGE fan of ceviche and know who makes it best. We were lucky to arrive when we did, because shortly after we were seated a line began to form outside. It was sweltering upstairs, so we asked to be seated in their downstairs section. \n\nWe decided to order the ceviche de Pescado y Camaron, which was (for me) the only dish worth writing home about. The portion was frighteningly small, even for a tapas restaurant, but it was delicious! We also ordered the Ahi tuna tartar, which was OK. The Chicharron de Pollo (which is another favorite dish of mine) was not crispy, very dry, and lacked the garlic flavor I am used to in this dish. The Lomito was too salty and overcooked for my liking. They redeemed themselves with a delicious sangria, and yuca fries that melted in my mouth. The table seemed to like the rotisserie chicken, however I don't find this to be a tough recipe to master, so I was not impressed by the restaurant as a whole.\n\nI might be a tough critic, but I know Peruvian food, and this was not up to my standards. I was hungry again in less than an hour.", "author": "Alyvia M."}

We were not seated until 9p despite repeated insistence that we had a 8pm reservation. The hostess had quite an attitude problem. She was completely unapologetic about our wait. She had the nerve to throw attitude (along with unnecessary eye rolling, etc) when we insisted that its unacceptable to be kept waiting for that long. Limon should be embarrassed.

Each time I left, my dining companions were thoroughly impressed. \n\nFood: If getting two dishes, start with the chicken and a ceviche. Rotisserie chicken is already tasty and moist, and the preparation they use at Limon is pretty excellent. Chicken comes with two sides. I've had both fish and seafood ceviches; good marinade that somehow tastes a bit milky. Both dishes are highly recommended. Passing marks to the chicarron de pollo (interesting concept), but I was not impressed by the lomito saltado. One dish per person is sufficient in terms of portions. \n\nDrink: Full bar with two Peruvian beer options and a sangria. Also carry a gourmet chicha morado and several homemade lemonades.  \n\nService: Friendly and fast, but there was a minor problem on my second visit. I asked for some help in gauging portions for a group of four, and the server talked me into buying an entirely unnecessary fifth dish. When that dish came, it was the wrong thing. The server copped to the mistake, and offered to fix it. It didn't bother us, so we just kept the wrong dish (don't know what it was called, can't review), but it was a bit irritating to be talked into a dish you didn't need then to receive the wrong one. Server, though, was totally friendly and polite about the whole thing. I suspect this was a one-off issue. \n\nAmbiance: Entrance is into the main seating area. Large windows make for a lot of natural light. The decor is inviting enough. Good for parties of 2-4. Tables somewhat small. Fine for a date (more on the fun side than the stuffy/elegant side). There is also a nicely decorated seating area in the basement that I haven't sat in.\n\nPrice: Averaging one dish per person, you're at $9-12 for food pre-tax/tip. Drinks were in the $5-7 range for alcohol. No HSF surcharge.\n\nBottom Line; Will recommend, will return.", "author": "Travis S."}

I haven't had skin on the outside of chicken that tasted that finger lickin' good in quite some time! Our party of seven got a whole chicken to share along with tons of other dishes, and we picked up every bone and made sure every ounce of meat and skin was gone before the waiter took it away! Yes, it simply is that good.\n\nNo matter what size chicken you order (whole, half, quarter...) it comes with two sides too! Granted, I thought the sides were going to be a little bigger than they were, especially their yuca fries which is probably one of the best examples of those fries I have ever had, so maybe that's why we all thought that particularly side was smaller than it should have been. Their sweet potato fries are just like every other place's so I would pass on that one next time around. \n\nBUT the one thing you shouldn't pass up on when you come here is their sangria!!! MMMMMMMMM We went through three pitchers of this magical concoction like it was water, because it tasted that yummy and was that addictive to drink! And no, this isn't like some sangria that is really watered down and doesn't have any alcohol in it, this sangria definitely packs a punch, but for $25 a pitcher, I would hope there would be some \"punch\" in that punch heh. \n\nBe sure not to pass up their hanger steak dish and their lomito saltado too!! Those pieces of meat were oh so tender, and oh so perfect!! The boys in our group were lickin' their fingers and scraping their plates!\n\nMy winning dish besides the sangria you ask?

Same size go with Ensalada Mixta (veggies)\n\nWe also ordered Carne a la Parilla.  At least everyone got a piece of the meat.  The sauce was good, but the steak meat didn't taste good.\n\n\n3. One of us asked for ketchup with fries, and they don't have ketchup.  \n(Not a big issue for me, but it was an issue for 2 in the party.)\n\nSince we noticed it would be a big black hole to keep staying there, we cut our loss and just left and going somewhere else.", "author": "I S."}

I truly believe the service staff needs improvement. \n\n1st time i came here for lunch. The server seemed to never pay attention to our table. Being an experienced server from another restaurant, it shouldn't be that hard to speak to our server. Its understandable when its busy, but it was on an extremely slow Monday. I asked for a drink & the server asked for my id. The server never checked on our table even once. When i was asking for a box for my food, the server was too busy speaking to other employees. \n\nThe 2nd time i decided to come for my birthday. Made a reservation & didn't get a table until 30 minutes after our reservation. I understand its a small restaurant, but tables could've been modified to seat parties. Knowing i have work in a couple hours, it isn't really a pleasant feeling. When we finally got sat, the server seemed very rushed and asked \"are we ready to order, or no?\". I've never been to a restaurant and was asked if i was ready to order even before i was settled. I ordered a drink & was never asked for my id, which i believe its because he was in a rush. This place just gives me the feeling of being rushed when its busy that they didn't even bother checking your ids. But if i come here on a slow day, they definitely would've checked my id. Throughout the meal the server seemed very rushed & spoke too fast for me to even understand. Both times i was here was very disappointing. Hoping that the second time would've been better, i was still disappointed. I truly believe the service staff still needs much improvement.", "author": "Jeffery S."}

I live in the Mission and have always been a frequent visitor of Limon on Van Ness since it's practically located in my backyard.  In fact, it's my go-to restaurant for all visitors to SF and almost every time, it was a hit.  However, my most recent visit on 10/16 was below expectations and unfortunately, was never properly addressed by any of the workers or the manager.  Reading some of the other reviews about their negative experience, I wanted to share mine as well.\n\nI had reservations for 3 at 9PM and arrived 5 minutes early at 8:55PM.  I was told by the hostess that they were getting our table ready and to wait a couple of minutes.  No problem, completely understandable.  And so my guests and I waited, and waited, and waited.  I noticed that groups of folks who showed up AFTER us were being seated BEFORE us and so I had to ask 3 different times.  All 3 times I was given a different answer (i.e. they were here before you, people are hanging out longer than expected, etc).  And finally, at approx 9:45PM (almost an hour after we checked-in and 45 minutes after our reservation time), I asked again why it was taking so long for our table and was told that there were \"a lot of 9:00 reservations and people are just sitting around for a long time\".  Right at that moment, they were about to sit a table of 6 but the group had left (probably waited too long as well) so they had us take the table, again, almost an HOUR after our reservation.  \n\nDinner was great as usual but it completely killed the mood after waiting an hour even though we had reservation.  I mean, what's the point of making reservations if the restaurant can't accommodate it?  What made it more disappointing was the fact that the manager did not acknowledge or even apologize for the long wait.  I would expect that their customer service be on par as their food but unfortunately, they did not seem to care enough to even say a 5 second apology.  \n\nLimon used to be my go-to restaurant for out of town visitors but moving forward, I will need to question whether it's worth it anymore.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I made a reservation for NYE dinner (the day of) for four people.  I was thrilled when the 5:30 pm time slot was still open.  As it so happened, two of our party of four were ~15 minutes late to the restaurant - the hostess was SO GRACIOUS to not give away our table.  I think we got lucky.  The restaurant was busy while we were there, but the ambiance was nice - low lighting, and not too noisy.\n\nOnce we were seated, we had a plethora of fabulous foods.  We shared a pitcher of red wine sangria (which gave us two rounds of drinks each for four people) - it was wonderful.  Probably some of the best sangria around.  Didn't taste boozy, but it certainly felt boozy.  We also had the red snapper ceviche (fresh with the perfect amount of citrus), half of a rotisserie chicken (juicy and flavorful), the lomito saltado (steak served on a bed of fries, how can you go wrong?!), chicharron de pollo with sides of seasonal veggies (happened to be green beans on our visit) and sweet potato fries, and additional side dishes of tacu tacu (beans and rice Peruvian style) and yucca fries (thick cut and simply amazing).  \n\nEvery single dish we had was fresh and flavorful - I would recommend every one of them.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  Service was quick and friendly.  Our server made fabulous recommendations on what to try and what to skip.  The most excellent part - for $75, the four of us were full of delicious food and enjoyed two rounds of drinks...so inexpensive, especially given the great experience we had!

However, once my friends and I arrived, we found that the hostess and management were horrible, rude, and inconsiderate. I had made reservations for 8 at 6pm but due to city traffic we were about 10 mins late. The hostess was very stuck up and did not hesitate to tell us that we can have our reserved table under the condition that we leave by 7:30pm. I was very angry by this because even if we had arrived on the DOT at 6pm, we would have stayed longer than 1.5 hours! Allocating a 1.5 hour time slot for table reservations is unfeasible for an environment that is casual, loud, with a bar and the Giants game on TV! There were so many rude gestures from the hostess and management that made us all feel very uncomfortable and unwelcomed once it got closer to 7:30pm. The rudest part was when the waiters began clearing off our table and began re-setting the table for next party while we were still sitting there drinking our sangria!

We got several pitchers for a table of 7 and we had no problems savoring every sip with our meal.\n\nWe had the ceviche to start. WOW. I've had some tasty ceviches in my life, including real authentic homemade ceviche in Colombia and this blew it out of the water. They had shrimp, fish and calamari ceviche. All were incredible.

I've just recently begun to venture back into the world of poultry and honestly if I had ever had this earlier in my youth, I don't know if I would have ever cut poultry out of my life. UNBELIEVABLE. I literally don't think there is an adjective in my Engrish that can capture the ridiculous level of tasty in this chicken. It was soft, moist, exploding with flavor, savory, great portions, and the list goes on and on. You HAVE to get the rotisserie chicken at this place, I can't imagine anyone goes through without trying it.\n\nThe sides were also very good. We got sweet potato fries, yuca fries, and the rice side. Yuca fries were memorable.\n\nAnd of course, the service.

Originally, the reservation, which the dinner host confirmed earlier that day, was at the Valencia location. When we got there, they said that they did not have our reservation, but the Van Ness location did. Annoying mix up, but the Van Ness location is close by, so it could be worse. We actually all ended up at the Van Ness location by about 7:50pm for our 8:00pm and they apologized for the mix up.\n\nWaiting Forever\n\nWhile they apologized for messing up the reservation, we still didn't even get seated until 8:30-8:40, 30-40 minutes later than our reservation. Once we finally got seated, they gave us a handful of menus for a group of 14 people. They also proceeded to tell us that due to our group being 15 people, we were forced to select from the prix fixe menu (which we were not informed of until we sat down). We then pointed out to the server that we were only 14 people and he said that we could choose from the normal menu then. We asked to get more menus and it took them over 10 minutes to get them to us. In addition, they hadn't checked on us once or brought us water or drinks. Once we finally had someone check on us, we ordered for the table, asked them to refrigerate a cake that we brought for us, and waited for the food.\n\nThe Food \n\nThe only plus to this place (and why I'm giving two stars instead of one) is that the food is good. We got ceviche, leche de tigre, roasted chicken, mac'n'cheese, yucca fries, lengua, fried chicken, and other things that I can't remember. They tasted good and they were quick to get everything to us (finally some quick service). \n\nThe Cake Incident\n\nOnce we finished the dinner, we asked to get our cake, which we knew had a \"cutting\" fee of $2/person (only because it was on the menu, since they did not inform us when we gave them the cake). We told them that we didn't need anything cut, but would like some utensils and plates. They proceeded to tell us that they would still be charging the $2/person for the dishes and utensils. This is where I get annoyed. If just one of all these things happened, we would be fine--it happens. However, the service and management failed at every turn during our experience there. From the reservation mix up, to seating us late without menus, trying to force the prix fixe menu on us, and now charging us almost $30 for a cake that probably cost us $25 to buy (how does it cost less to make the cake than to wash the dishes). By this point, I've had enough and asked them to take off this charge. The server said that he would if he could, but his manager would not let him, so I asked to see the manager. When he came over, I proceeded to tell him about our experience so far with everything that I listed and he said that there was nothing that he could do. He then told me that all restaurants do this and it blew my mind. Does he think that we've never been to a restaurant before? He must realize that many places actually give a free dessert when celebrating a birthday instead of charging us for a dessert that we brought. After explaining that, he said that the best he could do was take the charge off for half of the group. I replied that if he could do that then he could take it off for everyone. He didn't relent, so we asked to just get our cake back without dishes and that we would eat it elsewhere. Keep in mind, it's not that we can't afford the $2/person, but the fact that they would charge us more to do the dishes than the cake was worth is just ridiculous. Then to have the gall to say that's how all restaurants are just set it over the edge. By the end of the night, we spent over $400 and they wouldn't bend on this request.\n\nLast Word\n\nIn the end, I would not return to Limon. The food is solid but they lost 14 return customers due to poor service and management. I hope that they reevaluate some of their policies.", "author": "Julian P."}

The ceviche was good (although I've had better ceviche in the past). The side of yucca was fried nicely. But their chicken, the stand out dish of the restaurant, was dry and oversalted. I can make better chicken at home. The panna cotta for dessert was good, but I wasn't blown away either. The texture was fine, but the passion fruit coulis was too sweet.\n\nAll in all though, the total bill for two people was less than $60 (and more than half of that was sangria).

Oh, and rotisserie chicken!!\n\nA group of five girls venture out to Limon Rotisserie on a warm Saturday afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner birthday celebration.  Staff appears friendly, venue is sparsely decorated, but seemingly clean and bright.  First things first we order a pitcher of sangria--delicious, almost tastes like juice.\n\nHere's what we ordered to share:\n - Ceviche misto which was a mix of fish, calamari and tiger shrimp was fresh and just contained just the right amount of citrus and milk.  The accompanying red onions and large corn pieces (who's name I've already forgotten) were nice additions.\n\n - Pollo a la brasa (half chicken) was tasty!  Juicy and well seasoned, even the white meat was desirable.  We could have ordered a full chicken it was so good.  Nice that an order comes with two sides.  \n\n- Sweet potato fries are simple, but done right.  \n- Tacu- tacu we learned was fried beans and rice.  Not what we expected when it came out, but who doesn't like a fried ball of beans and rice?  Something different, and glad we ordered it.\n\n- Lomito saltado is my favorite Peruvian dish, and this is very much the same great caliber as it's Limon parent resto.  Tender pieces of steak, so full and rich in flavor with good quality, bit sized potatoes and tomatoes.\n\n- Carne and veggie empanadas were both amazing, though I think I enjoyed the veggie a bit more.  Mushroom, spinach and cheese--simple ingredients that compliment each other well.  While the carne one was good, their were too many ingredients involved that it almost just seemed like a beef mush inside, tasty beef mush, but mush nonetheless.\n\nAll the sauces were complementary to the chicken and anything that could and should be dipped for that matter.  I prefer a lil heat, so I wish more of them were spicy.\n\nEnjoyed my dining experience at Limon Rotisserie!  Surprisingly inexpensive but quite enjoyable meal.

Like.. the fries were damp but the meat was dry. Tasty but the meat was a bit hard compared to the other meat dishes. Assorted goodies in the dish were good though.\n\nJalea: aka Fried seafood with tartar sauce. Comes with 2 yuca fries.

Seated right when we got in, ordered a pitcher of sangria and 2 half chickens which I believe came with 3 sides each. In NO time, all of our food on the table!  The fastest service ever!  Boy was that chubby guy right.... the chicken was so tender, falling off the bone! The yucca fries were incredible (dipped them in the sauce they give you.. MmmMMm)! Killed the salad and sauteed bean veggie mix... 25 minutes later all we were left with was our sangrias (which was pretty tasty also, btw).\n\nCan't wait to go back and try everything else off the menu!!", "author": "Olga F."}

The salad was okay, seemed to have a little too much dressing. Lomito saltado is a winner. It always is. They bring out a variety of sauces for your meal too. The garlic one is the best.  The chicken was on the salty side and the skin wasn't as crispy as I had hoped. However, it was pretty moist and juicy.  Eat it with some of the rice and it should turn down the salt meter a bit and be pretty good. The other chicken dish they brought out was boneless fried chicken pieces. They taste fine with the sauces but it seems like the chicken was on the saltier side of things.  The desserts are BOMB. \n\nThe wait wasn't terribly long but we called ahead. The wait staff here are friendly and accommodating.  The area downstairs is a little funny with the seating.  I felt like a kid with the seats being so deep, I have sit on the edge and lean a bit to eat. If you want to sit back against the booth, you're much too far from anything. Just an awkward seating choice. I'd be better with regular booth depths or some chairs. \n\nWould come again if in the area to drink and eat desserts and a couple of the items.", "author": "John N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-25", "description": "Limon Rotisserie's chicken is sort of like a food equivalent of addiction. Once you've eaten it, you will need to order it again and again and again. Their other dishes are pretty good, especially the ceviche which has these large meaty pieces of fish in a delicious and acid sauce.\nOver the many times I've been here, I have had positive and negative experiences. Once I went here and ordered a salad which was full of limp and slimy greens. However, normally the salad is fresh and good. Another time I went there and the rice was too salty to my taste, but most of the time it is quite good. The restaurant offers a very stripped down menu so that they can crank out these little tapas plates very quickly. Therefore, although it is a sit down place, be prepared for your order to come out pretty quick with little lingering. They seem to have gotten it down to a science right now of cranking out the food quickly so that they can turn tables quickly. It might be  a little nicer if they served it more tapas style (one dish following another) rather than all at once, but I suppose that this is a decision that Limon has made in order to accommodate the many diners they get on weekends and evenings.\n\nMost of the food is pricey in my opinion, but I will admit that the quality and the taste is delicious. For example, the ceviches cost $14.00 per plate--it's a shareable plate, but I do find that pricey for a single small plate. The salad is about $9.00, if my recollection is correct, and most of the sides are $3-5.00 each. The yucca frita is delicious if you like that kind of thing, but it typically comes with just 4 sticks so be prepared for the sides to be pretty small. The chicken is worth it...salty, hot, and juicy and the sauces you get just put it that much more over the top!\n\nThe place tends to get noisy and crowded at evening time, particularly at or after 7:00pm you will be elbow to elbow with other diners in the top floor. Be prepared to kind of yell to have yourself heard over the din. If you don't like noise, this is not the place for you.", "author": "Stephanie J."}

Eugene and I shared a half chicken meal, a plate of Chicharron de Pollo (pieces of chicken marinated in soy sauce and the like), a glass of their purple corn juice, and their panna cotta.\n\nThe chicken was absolutely delicious. Similar in juiciness to RoliRoti, the meal comes with these dipping sauces that made the meat taste that much better. The chicken skin was heavenly and the sides, fries and tacu-tacu (beans and rice fried together to form a cake thing) did not taste the greatest but got the job done.

Everything hit on the mark for me.  I've traveled through Ecuador and have familiarity with the types of food themes they offer, and I can say they present an authentic and uniquely premium version of this type of culinary experience.  Furthermore, they do so in a way that is not pretentious, overly-priced, or degrading to the origins of the cuisine.  The atmosphere and service were great!  The waiter was quick to get our order and really directed us on the top choices for our tastes.  The waiters were even friendly enough at the end of the night to look up the name of a popular cumbia song that was playing so we could check it out later.  These two guys deserve a raise.  They were polite, efficient, and friendly -- something you rarely see in most restaurants in SF let alone the Mission.  The price was so reasonable I almost thought there was a mistake at the end of the meal.  I've probably paid twice or three times more at other restaurants for much less altogether on points of food quality/flavor, service, atmosphere, quantity, presentation, etc.  This place hits on all marks.  If you're looking for a great date spot or a place to take friends while in town, you cannot go wrong with Limon Rotisserie.  I will definitely be back!  Thank you!

Just a quick walk from the 24th street bart station and right to a table, no waiting.\n\nA friendly host and friendly, fast service. Appetizer (ceviche) was fabulous. Rotisserie Chicken and accompanying sauces were a delight. Short ribs were amazing, and that side where it's like beans and rice put together in a ball was awesome! Add to that two glasses of sangria and walking out for $30 and you have yourself two regular customers.\n\nPS...for us north beach relocators it's FABULOUS to find a good chicken place to rival Il Pollaio this side of market street.", "author": "Nikki M."}

It has the best Pollo a la brasa i have ever had period. If you don't know what that is, its simply brazed rotisserie chicken that has immense flavor if done rite, Limon has exceeded doing it rite and my every taste buds will be forever thankful for this place. \n\nInexpensive and amazing period. You have to try the Pollo a la brasa with white rice and the dipping salsa.

That's why I was SO disappointed when they only brought TWO plates (with two empanadas each) and they only had cheese in them!! Four empanadas...fourteen people!?

The food is very good, but I think it might be just the slightest bit under 5 stars. But then I remember the price, and the scale tips back to 5. \n\nI loved the original Limon, but the prices kept me from making it a regular destination. Limon's newest incarnation, Limon Rotisserie, has the same great food as the original Limon but is half the price. Instead of ordering individual entrees, it's best to go family style and order a rotisserie and a bunch of small plates. We had a half rotisserie, yuca fries, mixed vegetables, braised beef short ribs, mixed fish ceviche, and mixed fried seafood. It was all very good. I love ceviche, and this ceviche is just as good as it was at the original Limon. I don't think I love yuca fries as much as everyone else. They're a little starchy for me, but I seem to be the exception here, so go with everyone else on this one. Finally, it's hard to go wrong with sangria, but Limon Rotisserie goes very, very right with it. \n\nThe space is small but chic. My only complaint is that the bathroom is unisex and has a urinal, which kind of grosses me out since I'm not used to them, seeing as how I don't have one installed in my apartment. I know, I comment on bathrooms so much you'd think I'm some sort of drug addict. I'm not. I'm just prissy and drink a lot of water. \n\nUrinal aside, Limon still serves up the best Peruvian food in San Francisco. And perhaps the best part of all: a final bill of $26 per person (there were three of us) for a pitcher of sangria, four entrees, and two sides.", "author": "Susan S."}

He's come to like beef a lot, so before he arrived we made sure place another order of the anticuchos because they were very delicious and come on if he knew it was beef heart there was no way he would try it. He comes in we tell him it's beef and he says it is on of the best beef dishes he's had. This is coming from a guy who spent a couple of weeks in Brazil and Argentina last year eating Brazilian BBQ and Argentinian beef. Let's just say he was a bit shocked to find out it was heart, but that did not stop him from finishing what was on his plate.\n \nOK enough story telling-  must haves are the rotisserie chicken, and anticuchos\n\nVery reasonably priced too.

While I don't remember the names, the sauces were good (especially the green one). \n\nThe empanadas were good. I inhaled my bit of it. I liked the Ceviche Mixto. I hardly eat ceviche, so I might not be the best judge but it was thoroughly satisfying. The \"Lomito Saltado\" and sweet potato fries were pretty good, but I've had better for both elsewhere. \n\nThe drinks were also pretty good. I really liked my Caipirinha. I also tried a bit of my friends mojito and liked it a lot more than I thought I would.

I may be a little biased, since I'm a regular and we know most of the staff by now.  However, I will add that the staff are awesome and there to serve the customer, management on the other hand not so much....\n\nStarting with drinks! The Sangria is delicious and the Pisco Sour is a great competitor. Not looking for an alcoholic beverage, the fresh lemonades are just as good. \n\nI always start with the Ceviche Mixto, which is has nice citrus punch! I was turned onto ceviche because of this place and I never cared for fish, but thanks to this dish, I'm a ceviche lover! If you're looking for something green, the Ensalada Mixta is just as tasty. \n\nThe Lomito Saltaldo is full of flavor and who doesn't love fries? The Lomito Saltaldo and Chicharon de Pollo are by far the best that I've had in the city so far. Each dish is bursting with flavor and leave you craving for more. \n\nBut this place is also known for its Rotisserie Chicken and it does not disappoint. The chicken is seasoned with so much herb and cooked to perfection and always moist! The trio dipping sauce also provides more flavor, I wish I knew what was in the dipping sauce, its so good! \n\nLet's not forget the sides-Tacu Tacu, Sweet Potato Fries, Vegetales Salteados, and let's really not forget the Yuca Frito!!! This is one of the few places that I've had Yuca cooked properly, most places undercook the Yuca which is inedible or overcook Yuca and dry it out, but here its delicious! \n\nFinally, any of the desserts you decide on are sure to leave satisfied. \n\nAgain, I may be slightly biased, but every one I've introduced to Limon has loved the food!", "author": "ERICA G."}

The waiters were looking at my friends and I funny because we were ordering so many sides of rice with our numerous meat dishes. \n\nFor my drink I had their house soft drink called Chica Morada. It is supposedly made out of  Blue corn, pineapple and something or another with antioxidants... blah blah blah. It was ok, but somehow I was vaguely reminded of what a apple cinnamon candle may taste like.... anyhooo, it wasn't bad, just not my flavor of the week- a flavor that came with some Christmastime memories and memories of power outages. \n\nWe also had the rotisserie chicken. It was tender and flavorful, a little on the salty side for me, but good. We also had the Jalea, chicharron de pollo, and the seco de costillas and some sweet potato fries. I didn't get to taste the seco de costillas, it looked really tender and tasty though. Nonetheless, everything that we had was pretty good and well prepared. My fave was definitely the Lomito.

The yuca fries were simple but tasty - crisp on the outside, soft and warm in the inside.

This was my 3rd time going, and the chicken was really good this time. Honestly, the last two times the chicken was really dry. I do not at all agree that the chicken is the best thing here. \n\nBest items by far: Pescado ceviche, truffle macaroni and cheese and the chocolate cake dessert. Get those 3 among other dishes and you wont be disappointed. \n\nThe -2 stars is because I don't think the chicken is all that it's cracked up to be. Not a juicy 5 star chicken. Also, the place is paaaacked all the time. Waited 30 minutes after our reservation time, and got seated under the air conditioner downstairs. Worst part was that it was dripping over my side of the table the entire time. They also brought out the wrong type of empenadas 3 times. You would think that they would leave the beef empenadas after giving it to us 3 times, but each time they just took it back. We cut into them to see the inside, and after asking if they just throw the food out, he said of course not... so... are they cooking us the wrong order so they can eat it themselves? Seems fishy after the first time...\n\nFood is pretty damn good, atmosphere of sharing delicious dishes with your friends is great, service is usually stellar, but very off that night. \n\nWish I could give it 5 stars, but no apologies for the dripping air conditioner and wrong food killed it.

When I was up in the city on Memorial Day, I was debating what to get when a light bulb went off in my head--why not Peruvian? There's no Peruvian down in Monterey, and my palate had been itching for something different. I made a beeline to Lim\u00f3n. \n\nI figured I'd pop into Lim\u00f3n's rotisserie on Van Ness instead of the more formal restaurant on Valencia. The setting might be more casual, but the food was no less tasty. I got a seat at the bar without any wait, but it was later in the afternoon, around 2:30, after the lunchtime rush.\n\nI started with the chicharrones de pollo, of course, along with veggie empanadas, then decided to try the quarter rotisserie chicken for the main event. (Don't worry, I wasn't feasting on all that food by myself--I had help from a friend.)\n\nThe chicharrones were just as tasty as I remembered. The chicken meat was fried and crispy, yet tender inside. I could have easily gotten another couple orders of these, but reason--and fears of heart failure--prevailed.\n\nThe empanadas were so light and fluffy outside, the fried dough cradling lots of flavorful veggies inside. The filling had a nice kick of spice to it.\n\nI'd had both the chicharrones and the empanadas before, but the chicken was new territory for me. Sweet Jesus--that might have been the best roasted chicken I've eaten in years! The chicken skin was crispy and flavorful; the meat juicy and tender, just falling off the bone. The quarter portion was easily enough to split between two people, especially since it comes with two sides. (We tried the fries and the rice--the fries were cut thin, just how I like them; the rice was very flavorful and cooked to perfection.)\n\nAnd of course I paired lunch with a bottle of Lim\u00f3n's chicha morada soda, Inca Blu, made from Peruvian purple corn with hints of citrus and cinnamon. It's a sweet, but savory, soda that was the perfect complement for Peruvian food.\n\nAnd service was great. The bartender was friendly and helpful, even letting me buy a six-pack of the bottled Inca Blu chicha morada to take back home to Monterey. (I was going to share with my friends, but wound up hoarding most of it for myself. Oops.)\n\nI'll definitely keep Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie at the top of my list when I want a nice casual lunch next time I'm in the city.", "author": "Raul N."}

I'm relieved and happy to give my first 5-star review to Lim\u00f3n Rotisserie (and to Lim\u00f3n in general).\n\nHad not seen my South American friend for at least a year or so, we finally managed to set a time to get together.  The restaurant choice was easy - the old and dependable Lim\u00f3n, right up her alley (though she's not Peruvian).\n\nLim\u00f3n brings back old memories. Back when they were just a hole in the wall mom-and-sons operations.  This was all pre-Yelp time, when ceviche was not a common thing to find in restaurant's menu. Their ceviche was (and still is) one of the best in SF.\n\nEduardo, the third son was constantly present in their first restaurant location in 2002.  This family-run restaurant managed to keep their service and food quality at a high level to this day.  I still remember complementing Eduardo on their family business' success when they opened their big Valencia location (the one that had a fire).\n\nFast forward ten years, and they now have 3 locations in SF (Valencia, Van Ness, and Bayview-Hunters Point). Their Bayview-Hunters Point location is mostly doing the catering business. Their new location in Fresno is now a Mom & Daughter operation.  Their youngest son, Fernando, now oversees the Van Ness location. We had a small chat with him to reminisce on their humble beginning and their success. Bravo!\n\nDRINKS\nToo early for cocktails on lunch. But, what the hey.\nWas going to order standard Pisco Sour, but our waitress recommended the Maracuya Sour which was her favorite. The Maracuya sour Pisco Porton, passion fruit (maracuya), lime juice, combier, simple syrup, dash of egg white, and a drop of peychaud bitters.  Loved it. Great recommendation.\n\nA different waiter, Eric, recommended another cocktail which is not in the menu.  I call it \"Eric Special\" (since I cannot remember the name!).  It was a whitish drink (the white was from coconut, I believe).  Didn't try it, but it proved to be a bit too adventurous for my friend's friend.  \n\nF O O D\nWe ordered a fair amount of food for our party of 4.\n- Yuca (aka cassava) fries. The yuca fries was cut in large long slices and fried to perfection with the right amount of spices and salt.  Perfect sides to munch on while waiting for your friends or your other hot plates.\n\n- Sweet potato fries. This goes really well with the Yuca fries. Sweet + Salty combo. $3.95\n\n- Half Rotisserie chicken.  Lim\u00f3n's rotisserie chicken is up there with the rotisserie from Zuni, and Delfina; with Delfina's one possibly being slightly better.  That's a pretty good list of resto to be compared with.\n\n- Empanadas Carne. Hand-cut top sirloin, sweated in onions, & finished with hard-boiled eggs and raisins. Another winner.\n\n- Lengua (beef tongue) [not in the menu].  Out-of-this-world lengua!  This is probably one of the best, if not the best lengua.  The marinade was awesome \n\nand the lengua was very moist and tender, with just the right amount of chewy texture. \n\n- Anticuchos de Res: Grilled Beef heart anticuchos, served with choclo (Peruvian Giant Corn) & yucca.\n\nWe had Profiteroles and Panna Cotta de Mango arrived to our table to our surprise. Wink, wink.  Thank you, Fernando! Would've given your place a 5-star even without them!\n\nS E R V I C E\nOne word, \"WOW!\". After all these years, Lim\u00f3n's service is still casual, welcoming, friendly, and top-notch. Of course, having my South American friend yapping in Spanish with both of our waiters like they've known each others for years help getting us even better service! \n\n\nGreat job with quality control, consistency and service, Lim\u00f3n!!\n\nHope to see my old friends more than once a year and not just in January.", "author": "J R."}

Yes, delicious, but on certain instances, a bit too oversalted.

We couldn't get a table any later than that, and when we had finished eating we noticed a lot of people waiting outside the door, so I do recommend you make reservations ahead of time.\n\nOn to the food: we ordered the Ceviche Mixto, Pollo a la Brasa with Tacu Tacu and Papas Fritas, and the Aguadito de Pollo.

The Tacu Tacu was yummy and the fries were... well, they were fries, but they were good fries nonetheless.\n\nWhy am I giving this place only 4 stars?  The Aguadito de Pollo and the service.\n\nThe Aguadito de Pollo was supposed to be spicy, but wasn't really at all (the ceviche was spicier, and that's not saying much).

This was my first time experiencing Peruvian food so I expected more from spicy soup on a cold night, and quite frankly I was disappointed.\n\nThough the service was very attentive, no one was particularly friendly (the hostess at the door wouldn't even smile at us when we walked in) and we definitely felt like we were being rushed when we were finishing up our sangria and [attempting] to finish up the soup.

We had dinner reservations at 7pm and they held our table even though we were ten mins. late. It was packed! I scored parking right across the street, even though it can be tricky in the Mission.\n\nWe started out with a sangria. Then, the waitress came by with 3 types of dipping sauces. One was a spicy sauce, the other one was a chimichurrie sauce, and the last one was a mayo based sauce. \n\nThis is a tapas place, so it was nice to try all these small plates. All the ingredients and flavors rubbed me the right way. We ordered the 4 piece rotisserie chicken. You have to try their rotisserie chicken which is a signature dish here! Also, we got the fish and shrimp ceviche, side of rice, tuna tartare, and side of fries. \n\nThe ambiance is great here and a fun date place! We skipped desserts here and walked down the st. for gelato. I will definitely come back here with friends.", "author": "Melanie B."}

Had this place been labeled an \"American\" or \"fusion\" restaurant, you would see more stars from me. Ay dios mio, San Francisco! Comida Tipica Peruana? No! \n\nMoving on. If you are a Frisco hipster who likes the crowded bar vibe, cares about how cutting edge your food is displayed, if you are pairing your Armani Exchange hoodie with your Banana Republic cardigan that is smartly draped and knotted across your shoulders, this is for you. \n\nIf you enjoy meeting friends for dinner while smashing your Louis Vuitton satchel against the man-bag owned by a metro sexual man whooping it up on his I-phone, have a seat at the bar and enjoy baby. If you are longing for traditional Peruvian food delivered by a loving family, do not enter. \n\nIf you like Peruvian influenced food? This is a good place, albeit it crowded, with tasty food of the great value variety. Fans of this establishment, cool your jets! You would probably give less than five stars to my favorite Peruvian restaurant in the bay area too! Damn you guys! \n\nI've had the roast chicken, all of the various sides, the braised short ribs and so on. Braised short ribs? In Peru? Anyway. The chicken is a mammoth, Schwarzenegger-sized bird who has obviously been hitting the juice. It is tasty, much like most good roast chicken. It comes with several dipping sauces which are at least influenced by Peruvian cuisine and large enough to share if you are so inclined. \n\n*Watch out gluten free friends! Chifas and saltados are traditionally made with soy sauce and are off limits for us :-( \n\nThe braised short ribs are tasty and shreddy to the fork, set amidst crunchy baby carrots and veg. Crunchy Baby carrots! In Peruvian dishes? I digress. \n\nThe mango lemonade is delicious and a good example of the hybrid style of this restaurant. I have never seen this drink's existence in South America ;-) but it is good nonetheless. \n\nThis ambiance is really not to my liking though I imagine it a welcome landing place for Ed Hardy lovers while exiting your fresh vespa on the way to the next power meeting. Now, now! *insert coy giggle here* \n\nChef, fans and fellow South American food lovers, I know a little basement spot on Grand Ave. *whispers* (golden Inka) that does what this place does not and that is serve traditional Peruvian food if you are ever in the mood. \n\nTraditional Peruvian cuisine is influenced by Spain in stews and soups (caldos and secos), Italy with pasta and by Chinese immigrants in methods and ingredients. Chifas, is the popular Peruvian fried rice dish. But, the indigenous influenced my favorite elements of traditional Peruvian cooking with an unmistakable rustic element and produce indigenous to the Amazon region like yucca, purple corn and yellow cherries. . \n\nMy paisley pink dress stands out here, my indigenous handmade purse is not appreciated and I can't hear my friends. it is hip, very tasty and a good value. That should get them five stars right? Would you buy a hamburger at a Chinese restaurant? A burrito at a Kosher deli? Crunchy baby carrots! \n\nHere is a traditional Peruvian recipe of mine taught to me by a family friend, made gluten free by me, mary b! \n\nAji de Gallina (garlic chicken) \n\nbrown together I lb. cubed boneless chicken thighs, 1 chopped white onion, 4 chopped garlic cloves, add salt and pepper to taste ( a little MSG) if you want authenticity ;-) \n\nFood processor: One cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup walnuts, 1/4 cup queso fresco (fresh cheese) 1 table spoon chicken bouillon (Maggi is a good Latin brand) 1/2 teaspoon fresh black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and blend. *Add a little milk if it is too thick. \n\nPour this mixture over chicken when it is almost cooked, cover and simmer for five minutes more or until chicken is thoroughly cooked and sauce is just bubbling..

After hearing so much about it from friends (and having really good roast chicken from Roli Roti) I was actually even looking forward to it.\n\nI came here for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The latin music they played helped me forget about the crappy weather outside. We were hungry from walking all the way from Nob Hill (crazy, right?) so it was a good thing all our food came out super fast. And, as usual, we ordered way too much food for 2 people.\n\nWe started with the CEVICHE MIXTO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=jW896eEqja7yWxuLXIHu7A) which came with red snapper, squid, and shrimp. The leche de tigre they use in the ceviche was nicely balanced and not overly acidic but the seafood itself was bland and not marinated very well. Next was the AGUADITO DE POLLO (chicken rice soup, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=leLI4divaOp0M3NPb8EB6w). The flavours were good and there was a lot of chicken, but unfortunately, there was even more salt--so much so that my tongue hurt :(\n\nNot exactly the greatest start to our meal but then things took a turn for the better. The ROTISSERIE CHICKEN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=f09fo7W8QNu0k0xsx7yjug) lived up to expectations. (Well, at least the dark meat did!) It was juicy, tender, and seasoned perfectly. I barely touched the aji sauces it was served with since it was already so flavourful. The white meat wasn't nearly as moist, but that's to be expected. Being a big fan of all organ meats I ordered the GRILLED BEEF HEART SKEWERS too (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=8RLMRuOpn8l0cgnsIsYHfA). I absolutely loved the tender, smoky, slightly iron-y and delicious heart pieces!\n\nWe also got 4 sides: SWEET POTATO FRIES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=wBEY1SJMVM_dB9KPSiXv3g), TACU TACU (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=zpGTJnn4uzvxny_7RJP63g), VEGETABLES SALTADO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=H-or4Y5ToS_IEL0W6EYW2Q), and YUCCA FRITES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=3f_UTUuQmDhevw6y2AasuQ). These were all incredible! The sweet potato fries were salted nicely and so crispy. I liked the tacu tacu (seasoned beans and rice balls that are deep fried) even though I'm normally not a fan of rice and beans. The vegetables had this amazing smoky aroma and the flavours reminded me of a Chinese stirfry. The yucca fries were like deep-fried sticks of mashed yucca--crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Although they were a little bland they were absolutely incredible with the smoky sauce from the vegetables.\n\nBecause a meal isn't complete without dessert we got the CHOCOLATE BANDIDO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=Tk9vDng9xflGo3huZdR9jQ) and panna cotta. I was happy with both of these. The molten center of the warm chocolate cake oozed out beautifully as I cut into it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=ic7X9rVyu3AAz-4toSLVlA). It was intensely chocolately--and would satisfy any chocaholic--but got a little too sweet for me halfway through. The PANNA COTTA (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r7RwvYMwxDuK3u26fHbYDA?select=9NFm8tsiBuYZoLiZba_30w) was a little lighter. It had a really nice creamy texture and was amazing with the deliciously refreshing strawberries and mango sauce.\n\nAfter this lunch I was in a huge food coma.

That's 35 minutes of waiting by the small awkward space near the door!  Horrible. There were actually open tables upstairs and an abundance of open tables downstairs (where I wanted to sit), but the 2 female hostesses refused to seat me because their kitchen was \"too busy and backed up\" and their supervisor didn't give them permission to seat anybody yet. That was really stupid.  Wouldn't you want to seat your customers rather than have them stand? \n\nWe ordered the half-chicken, a steak dish (not lomo saltado), fries,and vegetables. The chicken was flavorful, the 3 dipping sauces complemented the chicken very well. But the steak dish was flavorless. \n\nOverall, affordable dinner for good food, but the wait is too damn long.", "author": "Kristina N."}

Of course, you can hardly go wrong when you serve me Peruvian food but this place definitely delivered!  \n\nCame here to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my wife and happened to bring our baby along.  I was a little skeptical at first but I did see on Yelp that it said Kids are welcome...  As we were seated in the downstairs lounge, I was a little worried cause the downstairs area was like a nightclub lounge with square ottomans and low tables and even had a DJ spinning some cool tunes but I was quickly relieved when I saw some other kids at the next table which was a large group.  And it was funny cause, later in our meal, another table got seated on our other side, and there were 3 kids in that party as well.  \n\nOnto the food.  So I guess they are famous for their Rotiserrie Chicken here.  So of course, we had to try that as our main course.  As some have stated, it is a bit salty.  But since my taste buds tend to favor saltier food, it was right up my alley.  We also ordered their Yucca fries and some veggies as our side dishes to the Chicken and both were very good.   \n\nCeviche and lomo soltado rounded out our meal.  The Ceviche was excellent while the lomo saltado I think I would prefer at other places.  Their lomo saltado was tender though which I actually thinks means the meat is supposedly more quality but I actually prefer my beef not as tender.  \n\nDefinitely will come here again at some point and probably will be bringing a group with me the next time around as they have some very reasonable prix fixe deals.", "author": "Mark W."}

There was practically a line out the door when we arrive.. super busy! \n\nThe food was amazing, we ordered the Ceviche Mixto, Carne Emapandas and the Half Chicken with vegetables and Tacu Tacu. The pacing of the meal was not great , everything came out all at once which made it a tight squeeze at our small 2 person table. They actually forgot about the Ceviche Mixto.. at first I thought it would come out later but it never came. At the time it was fine we had enough as it was.. so I didnt mention it. \n\nThen we had to wait 20 minutes to get a desert menu and the only reason we got it at that time was because I flagged down another server. We ordered the Profiteroles which were delish. The waitress took our plates and said \"wow that was fast\".. which I found rude.. something more appropriate would have been \"O I can see you hated the desert\" if you want to joke around. \n\nWe waited and waited some more.. then I flagged down another server for the check.  When I got the check to my surprise it had the Ceviche Mixto.. so I got up and went to the bar where our server was who did look at me and saw me there but continued to do something else. So I had to tell the bartender .. \" We ordered this but never got it so can you please remove it from the bill\". I went back to our table while he took care of it. \n\nThen the waitress looks pissed and just drops it back off at our table without saying ANYTHING. At that point I was frustrated, its no big deal I didn't really care but do not give me attitude for your mistake.. an apology would have been nice. \n\nOverall the food was wonderful but the service was not.

I also had some soup, Aguadito de Pollo.\n\nThe rundown:  DAMN good chicken!  Seasoned very nicely, very moist, very delicious. The aji sauce trio went well with the chix.  I especially dig the chimichurri sauce.  Also had the chix with french fries & sweet potato fries. The former was standard but good, and the latter, well, come on! Sweet potato fries!  Oh, yeah, the soup was good as well.  The tab was equally impressive at just above $30 with three soda orders and tax included.

The food is awesome!  We didn't go for the rotisserie chicken but instead opted to try some of the small plates family style:\n\nCeviche Mixto - excellent.  No chips on the side like when we went to the original La Mar cevicheria in Lima, but a nice mix of shrimp, calamari, and fish.  The large kernels of maize that accompanied it brought back some good memories.\n\nPollo Empanadas - pretty good - I'd rate it at a 7 on a scale of 1-10.  The sauce served on the side was unexpected and a bit spicy for my taste, but the Empanada itself was light and tasty.  For the sake of comparison a 10 would be having it from a brick oven like when I visited the Pisac market near Cusco.  El Porteno in the Ferry Building would get an 8.5.\n\nLomito Saltado - pretty good.  The sirloin was tender and flavorful.  The mixed in french fries worked quite well too.\n\nMango Pana Cotta (dessert) - amazing.  I've never had this before, but all I can say is wow.  I would go back just for this.\n\nProfiteroles (dessert) - really good as well.  Opted for the chocolate sauce on the side and even without the chocolate they were delicious.\n\nOther comments:  Great service, and great presentation on all dishes.

It's definitely a people pleaser for every kind of person. It's classy, yet relaxed. High quality, yet good prices. \n\nThere are two reasons for taking a star away: \n1. LONG waits. Even when I've made reservations, they've either made us wait another 30 minutes or somehow lost the reservation. Not cool. \n2. The upstairs has a great ambience, but the lighting downstairs is terrible. If you go on a busy night as more than a couple, you'll probably end up down there under glaring fluorescent lights. \n\nBut the melt-in-your-mouth chicken somehow makes it all worth it.

The waiter was fantastic: attentive, friendly, patient, helped us choose plates, etc.  \n\nHOWEVER, the owner needs to relax or invest in a larger establishment.  Because the place was packed, he was like a vulture, blatantly eyeing our waiter to hurry us up when ordering and when eating.  Okay, we did sit next to him but no one should be made to feel like they're being rushed through a meal.  \n\n*Once we placed our order, the food came out quickly, hot, and it was delicious! * All of it, okay minus the ceviche.

Some of the side tables are pretty close to eachother but everyone was so involved in their own conversations that it didn't matter too much.  I saw a large party with children so it's definately okay for the kiddies.\n\nFor drinks I had the house-made strawberry lemonade and the bf had a glass of the sangria.  The strawberry lemonade was super refreshing and yummy.  The sangria had a good amount of fruityness to it.\n\nThere was no way we could come to Limon Rotisserie without getting the signature rotisserie chicken - that was a given.  We decided to get a half chicken and chose papas fritas and tacu-tacu as our sides.  They bring out a small dish of all of their dipping sauces which is awesome.  The chicken was really flavorful and the skin was slightly crispy.  The only downside was that the white meat was on the dry side which was kind of a bummer.  The papas fritas were skinny shoestrings ala McDonalds and they were pretty darn delicious.  The tacu-tacu was something we'd never had before and it was pretty yummy.  \n\nWe also had the seco de costillas - braised short ribs and the jalea - basically a fried seafood plate.  I must say that everything fried here is DELISH.  The yuca frita is probably one of the best I've ever had.  The shrimp were fried PERFECTLY - slighty crispy on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside.  Man oh man I'd definately order the jalea again.  The shortribs were yummy but not anything to rave about.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed by the time we had finished everything but we decided to look at the dessert menu anyway.  I saw that they had panna cotta so of course I had to try it!  It was a little too sweet for me and I was looking for something tart in the sauce to cut it down but the mango sauce was pretty sweet as well.  It also was served with a dark chocolate sauce which was yummy but I didn't really understand the combination of it all.\n\nAll in all, pretty good meal.  I still want to check out Limon!", "author": "Kim-van T."}

AND THEN EVERYTHING WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE!\n\nwe were waiting on our chicken for a good 30 minutes or so...it was a little strange because other tables that just sat down and ordered got their chicken within 5 minutes.  we looked around..couldn't find our server...eventually he walked by, stared at our table, and walked away.  no updates, no apologies, nada.  he even went to the manager and said something to him after he stared at our table...and the manager didn't even come by to apologize for the waiting time.  the manager was obviously a social butterfly because he kept talking to the table next to us asking if they were ok.  maybe he had a thing for them?  who knows...oh, and i totally felt sorry for the table on the other side of us...our server did not check on them for at least a good 45 minutes. \n\nanyhoo, so i'm not the type to wave down a server because i know what it's like to be one...but i have never received service this horrible before.  time just kept on ticking...and no freakin chicken!  finally, the server had enough balls to come to our table to tell us that they made a mistake.  the kitchen didn't make it cause they didn't have a ticket.  well, duh stupid...that means you forgot to add the chicken to our check!  own up to your mistake...don't blame the kitchen!  anyhoo, the chicken finally came out with our side of yuca frita(fried cassava).  the chicken was a little on the salty side...but i won't complain cause there is nothing worse than unseasoned chicken.  a little overseasoning is ok...the chicken was super juicy and i loved the 3 sauces that came with it.  the yuca frita was amazing!  \n\noh, so the manager was once again talking/flirting again with the table next to us...and i think he saw me staring him down.  he finally had the balls to come over...but of course, didn't apologize.  he just said, \"thank you for waiting for the chicken.\"  WHAT???  how bout an i'm sorry???  this place has no clue what customer service is...for that, a one star deduction is not enough.  i had to deduct 2 stars...cause well, poor service really hurts a restaurant and your experience no matter how great their food is.  \n\nanyhoo, it gets worse.  we already decided to order a dessert at the beginning of our meal.  we went with profiteroles...puff pastry stuffed with pastry cream sitting on top of more pastry cream topped with chocolate and pecans.  since i can't eat chocolate or pecans, i asked the server if he could put those on the side.  2 minutes later, our dessert came out...but where the heck were the pecans and the chocolate?  they forgot it...AGAIN.  our server was no where to be found...halfway through our dessert, another guy brought us our chocolate and pecans.  at least he apologized!  \n\nwhat a HORRIBLE experience...it's a shame that the food is so damn freakin good.  i usually give servers the benefit of the doubt and still tip at least 20%...not tonight...he didn't deserve it.  and the manager sure didn't deserve our money either.  \n\nmaybe the best thing is to order food to-go?  the chicken was pretty good...but the lomito saltado should be the dish on the 7x7 list...that stuff was bomb.  i'm willing to give this place another try because of the great food...but i think they need new management...and new servers!", "author": "Jen W."}

Hospitality: I had reservations for two and we were 20 minutes late. The cab dropped us off and the house was packed! In my head. Oh no! I hope they didn't give our table away. We came in and we were welcomed an was expected. \"we've been waiting for you\". How cool is that?\n\n2. Service: From the minute we were seated at our table, service was like a dream come true. It was like a NASCAR pit crew. Our water glasses were kept filled and food came out quick during dinner rush time!\n\n3. The Food: the food! Seriously, the food! It melted in my mouth. Is that possible? \n\nWe started with the Ceviche Mixto, a combination of fish, shrimp, and squid marinated in a sour lemon base and corn kernels. At first, it had a kick to it. It was over powering. But I thought to myself. Wait! It's like cleansing my palate. I think this would be good to have in between plates. It's like the purpose of ginger when eating sushi. Anyways, moving on.\n\nThe Chicharon de Pollo landed on our table next. Basically, deep fried skinless chicken topped with shredded onion with a lemon and cilantro dipping sauce. my girlfriend didn't care much about it, but to me, i enjoyed every bite of it. Okay okay, Maybe the flavor was not there at all. Maybe we Americans just like salty foods too much? So I'm gonna believe that the chicken had the right amount of saltiness to it. Who am I to say it should be saltier, this, or that? I'm no expert. But it was seriously good to my mouth.\n\nNext was the Carne Empanadas. The empanadas were the highlight of our dining evening at Limon. The filling was just sensational along with the mustard dipping sauce. I think it's mustard. Haha. But it was just a delight biting in to the flaky crust and the flavorful filling. It was so good we had to try the Pollo Empanadas and ordered a second one. \n\nUp next, the Lomito Saltado. We had to try the feature plate. Beef steak chunks cooked medium rare with strips of onions, tomatoes, and FRIES! The steak seriously was like chocolate. It was a heavenly experience. I didn't order it with rice, but the guy expediting the plates gave us a bowl of rice for FREE! to complete the dish. aaaaand it was fantastic! It complemented the plate very well.\n\nWe didn't order the rotisserie chicken. We should've. But by the time we realized that. We were already getting full.\n\nMy overall experience of this place was hands-down awesome! Can't wait to go back to this place on my next visit to San Francisco. One advice is, if you're gonna have dinner at Limon, be sure to make reservations. This place gets packed, and I know why.\n\nThe best part? i expected the bill to come out to about 60-70 bucks.

I'm one of those obnoxious people that no matter how tasty the meal may be, I always have to add more. Yes, this is causing my belly to bloat to distended status, but I don't care. Salt is a necessary addition to my food. \n\nSo when I expressed an interest in Limon Rotisserie, and heard the criticisms that the oft-touted roasted chicken was too salty, I wasn't disheartened. Instead, my interest was piqued. What, you say? A dish that I won't have to add extra salt to? Bring. It. On.\n\nAnd yes, the chicken is well flavored and salty to the point that I did not need to add extra, but it also wasn't so overwhelming to cause my sodium-avoiding roommate to choke. It was just right. And even better, there was so much meat on the bone that it felt less like scavenging (which is why I generally detest roasted chicken) and more like eating a boneless chicken breast. \n\nWe split the half chicken, which when served with three delicious dipping sauces, as well as complimentary sides of yucca fries and roasted vegetables, was more than enough of an entree for two people. We also split the halibut, calamari, and shrimp ceviche, and while there was a bit of an issue of the lime juice being a bit too acidic, it was equally yummy. (God, that's a terrible adjective, isn't it? I'm too lazy to look up a thesaurus though, so it will have to do.)\n\nAll in all, from the shared pitcher of sangria to the roast chicken to the ceviche, we both walked out spending less than $30 each for our entire meal. We also agreed that the tapas style menu would be rockin' for a date, first or otherwise. No extra salt required.", "author": "Devon S."}

It was such an open space. We were seated at the lounge area (?) which made eating a bit difficult but it was still enjoyable. I actually preferred seating on the couch because it makes the atmosphere more relaxed. \n\nI really enjoyed the ceviche, especially, the dipping sauce that came with it! The chicharon de pollo (as unhealthy as it is) was delightful, mmm the oiliness and the fat that came with it, so addictive... Unfortunately, the rotisserie was a miss. It could have tasted better if it wasn't too salty. I'm willing to come back so I can try again what people have been raving about.", "author": "Anette N."}

Limon is located at the south end of Van Ness which my wife thinks is \"sketchy\". Compared to the surrounding buildings, Limon is simple and stylish with nice big windows, an airy dining area, and a surprisingly nice downstairs area which also serves as a club, but doesn't feel like a dungeon.\n\nWe started off with a pair of ceviches: red snapper and tuna. I preferred the tuna which was diced into small cubes and accompanied by some crisp, homemade chips and slices of cucumber. The fish was lightly marinated in a citrus marinade and had a very fresh flavor. I didn't try the snapper, but our friends said it wasn't quite as good. We also ordered the beef and chicken empanadas which had delicious, flaky crusts, and moist fillings. The beef empanada was probably my favorite of the two since it was prepared in a very traditional style with raisins and olives.\n\nThe chicken is the real star of the menu. The meat is very tender with a slight citrus flavor. The skin is super crispy and tasty. A half chicken fed three of us, but I'd recommend getting a whole chicken and splitting it. To give you some idea of how good the chicken is, I normally don't care for dark meat, but I'm happy to eat all of it at Limon!\n\nEvery order of chicken includes two sides. We went with the grilled vegetables (seasoned beans, mushrooms, and onions) and pappas fritas (French fries). The veggies were great, but the fries were just so-so.In the past, I've gone with the sweet potato fries which are way better!\n\nLimon gets really busy, so be prepared to wait or show up a little earlier in the day like between 5 and 6.", "author": "Jason W."}

But there is so much food to be shared here that its so much better to eat with people who have an appetite! \n\nLimon is a tapas joint and tapas have a reputation of racking up the bill. So I highly suggest ordering the whole chicken - cut up in 6-8 pcs - which comes with any 2 sides. And then ordering another side or 2..and TRUST me you will be good!\n\nHere we ordered the whole chicken and alongside of it came crispy yucca fries and tacu-tacu. We also got Lomito saltado and vegetarian empanadas. And the 3-dipping sauces are ALL mouth-watering: rocoto aji, amarillo aji, and chimchurri!\n\nThe restaurant has a downstairs dining area that has a bar, dj booth, and more lounge-like seating. Good for private events, birthday parties, or a wedding reception!", "author": "Angela A."}

Although crowded, the restaurant gives off a delightfully romantic ambiance.\n\nWhat we ordered: \n\n- A half Chicken that comes with two sides and Aji sauces.\n(for the two sides we chose yuca fries and vegetables salteados)\n\n- Ceviche Mixto: fish, calamari & tiger shrimp\n\n- Seco de Costillas: braised boneless beef short ribs with huacatay & cilantro, served with potatoes, carrots & english peas\n\n- A pitcher of Sangria\n\nAll of the dishes were served on a small plate and arranged nicely for presentation. The cups they served our sangria in reminded me of stemless wine glasses. This place has class.\n\nThe first served us our pitcher of sangria. It was really, really good. Not too strong, sweet and dark. A great way to start the meal. After this, I was really excited for the rest of our course.\n\nThe half chicken is slowly roasted over an open flame and served in cut pieces for easier consumption. It is moist and rather savory. I cut it into smaller pieces so I could dip the chicken into each of the Aji sauces. They serve three different sauces with it. The rocoto sauce is a creamy orange sauce that has a little spice to it. The aji amarillo sauce is a creamy yellow sauce that tastes a little sweet. The chimichurri sauce is a pesto-like sauce with oil, garlic and parsley. All were fantastic and give a little kick to each chicken bite.\n\nI enjoyed our sides. The yuca fries went well with the rocoto and aji amarillo sauces. The vegetables salteados came grilled which I am fan of. The steak-like sauce with our grilled vegetables makes me want to eat vegetables everyday.\n\nThe ceviche mixed is great. The fish is served more raw, which I like. The sauce surrounding the ceviche is very zesty, making the fish, shrimp and calamari taste even better. Although I wish the calamari wasn't served in those small pea-like pieces.\n\nThe seco de costillas boneles beef short ribs hit the spot. A small amount of soft, juicy beef but just enough to go with the potatoes & carrots.\n\nGreat customer service and a lovely place to take a date.

After a bit of negotiating, they agreed to seat us and let us order for everyone.  The staff did everything they could to accommodate us, and kept checking on us to make sure we were ok.  The food came out quick, and everything was delicious!  We practically ordered everything on the menu, and I enjoyed every dish that I tasted.

And I gotta say, after eating what I thought was the best meal of my life, I didn't know or didn't care what to expect from Limon Rotisserie.  I was already in food heeavveeen! Limon Rotisserie though definitely put me into some sort of second level of food heaven if that's even possible.\n\nWe got to the restaurant at 8 and the reservation wasn't until 8:15.  There were about 30 of us in the party and so it took awhile for them to set-up our table.  We didn't get seated until almost 9:00!  I was a little unsure where exactly they'd seat us because just looking into the restaurant from the street - it was tiny in there.  You can't even wait inside without feeling like you're suddenly a part of someone else's dinner party.  Little did I know that they had a very large downstairs seating area.  The set-up of the downstairs area looks very much like a club.  There's even a DJ booth and around the corner a loungey type area with couches, coffee tables, and ottomans where they seat large/very-large parties like ours.  \n\nAfter playing musical chairs trying to find a seat at the different tables that made up our party, we finally settled in and our table of 5 ordered some drinks.  We started with a pretty good Peruvian beer (Cuzquena) and then eventually ordered a pitcher of sangria.  The food here is tapas, served family style so the portions are a bit on the smaller side.  We ordered two red snapper cerviches, the chicharron de pollo, two lomito saltados, the carne empanadas, a whole chicken with yuca fries and sweet potato fries, and the carne a la parrilla.  This was way more than enough food for 5 people.  \n\nThere were some okays, and there were some goods, and then there were some greats.  The stand-out dish here is quite appropriately their rotisserie chicken.  They really marinate the crap out of this thing - from skin to the actual meat - it was all so juicy and flavorful!  The good stuff were the chicharron, the yuca fries, and the carne a la parilla.  The okays were the cerviches, the empanadas, the sweet potato fries, and the lomito saltados (but that's probably because I'm biased toward Mi Lindo Peru's lomo saltado).  Overall, the food was good and there wasn't a bad dish and being seated in the lounge area was pretty nice.  Because right after our meal ended, we all slumped down onto the couches ready to pass out from food coma!", "author": "Jean A."}

The limonato saltado was heavy on the salt, but sort of expected when you order beef stir fried with fries. The chimmichuri sauce was disappointing but I was okay with that when I saw my check.

We were also never asked if our food came out okay or if we wanted any more drinks. \nAll in all, the food was good, service not that great, if I find another Peruvian restaurant with better service I probably wouldn't come here again.", "author": "Fanny S."}

Overall, Limon is a 3.\n\nYou MUST order the rotisserie chicken if you come here.  It is perfectly tender and flavored to perfection and served with a trio of delicious and interesting sauces.  It is also VERY decently priced.  For $17.95, you get a whole rotisserie chicken and 2 delicious sides.  That fed a good portion of our group of 8!\n\nThe sides are also excellent.  My favorites were the yucca fries and the sweet, delicious, possibly genetically-engineered corn kernels.  They are at least 10x the size of normal corn kernels... which means 10x the sweet, juicy goodness!  The sweet potato fries are decent, but would be much better if served with an aoili or some other delicious dipping sauce.\n\nThis place is not exactly the best place for the pescetarians and vegetarians out there.  We ordered the tuna tartare, the empanadas, the calamari, and a root salad for our seafood-eating friends.  The tartare was meh.  The empanadas and calamari were excellent.  The root salad was interesting, but nothing special.\n\nThough the waiters and bartenders are fine, the hostess has been really rude to my friends and me both times I have been here.

We showed up two minutes early only to be told that our reservation was on the \"waiting list\" and not an actual reservation at all. The restaturant was very crowded, and there were large groups spilling out onto the sidewalk outside. Anyways, we waited, and waited for a table, meanwhile thinking of the injustice of waiting 30 minutes for a table when you clearly made a reservation. Injustice, I say!\n\nAnyways, after some persuasion on my boyfriend's part, we were finally shown to a table. If we hadn't said anything, I could easily have seen us standing there all night. \n\nWe got some sangria, the rotisserie chicken (more out of obligation than pure desire), the ceviche mixto and some other sides. The chicken was a step above the safeway one I usually get (which I actually think is pretty good--make what you will of that). The ceviche was good too. And everything was very reasonably priced when you consider how trendy this restaurant apparently is. \n\nBut. \n\nSomething did not agree with my stomach that night. No, no it did not.

So, we hiked along 8 blocks to get some delights. And was I ever delighted! We ordered Tartara de Tuna, Yuca fries, Jalea, and Truffled Mac n' Cheese. The Tartara was fresh, and tasty with a nice hint of sesame seed oil. It was served with potato chips as a vehicle to get those yummy morsels in your mouth. The Yuca fries were tender on the outside, and crisp on the outside. It was served with 3 sauces:  Aji Amarillo, Rocolo, and Chimichuri. All the sauces were delicious and not so spicy hot that it burned your taste buds. The Jalea was good, but nothing unique or out of this world. It was fresh, and crisped just right and was served with a dill-mayo sauce. As for the Truffled Mac n' Cheese, well, although this is supposed to be their famous dish, I was taken aback by the overwhelming taste of truffle.  However, the sauce is supremely creamy and it is seasoned just perfectly.

Limon Rotisserie is a place where I can enjoy both of my likes for chicken, with a very delicious glass of Sangria to wash it all down.  It's a great place to eat, and a fun place to be!  \n\nWe had the rotisserie chicken there - it is a must-have item here!  The chicken was very flavorful, moist, and yummy!  It came with special Peruvian dipping sauces and one side.  For our side, we got the grilled veggies.  We added the rice, sweet potato fries on top of that.  And of course, the Sangria as well.  \n\nOne note about seating - they have a downstairs/basement area that is a lot more chill than upstairs.  The upstairs dining area seems more formal and serious... while downstairs was more of a party.  We were downstairs.  \n\nThis place is definitely a great place for chicken, and is better value than the $50 chicken for 2 at Zuni.  Of course, if you're looking for the higher-end date atmosphere, maybe the $50 chicken for 2 is fine.  I'd just rather spend the rest of that difference ($32 - Limon's chicken is $18) on more Sangria!", "author": "Leo C."}

Oh no!! I was so upset, but quickly took at look at the other items which I had only heard wonderful things about from the other 3 dining mates.\n\nOur waiter was nice, but obviously rushed, busy, and irritated when we started asking questions.  We told him we were hungry and asked how many small plates he recommended and he said 7 or 8.\n\nWe ordered the Ceviche Mixto, Ceviche de Pescado y Camaron, Lomito Saltado, Empanadas, Jalea, Chicharron de Pollo, and the bean cake side (I can't remember the exact name).  \n\nFavorites were definitely the ceviche - so flavorful, yummy, and the seafood (calamari, halibut, and jumbo shrimp) was beyond fresh, if that's even possible.  I basically could've drank the sauce afterwards, it was exploding with awesome lime flavors.  I found myself using the extra leftover sauce on the majority of the other dishes!  I can't forget to mention the jumbo CORN on the cob that comes w/ the ceviche dishes.  Definitely a plus! \n\nAnother favorite was the Lomito Saltado (thanks Phil H for the recommendation), which is a classic Peruvian dish of stir-fried top steak strips, onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce and served with fries MIXED in. Yum, the fries were the perfect consistency after marinating in the delicious sauce. \n\nWe had both sangria and strawberry mojitos, which were good, but stick with the sangria.  It compliments the meal perfectly.  Dessert was also great - I was extremely full, but after seeing the Bandido option, we had to get it! It's a classic dish at LR; flourless chocolate cake with brandy chocolate sauce and creme anglaise.  You cut into it and it's hot, creamy, chocolate-y center is a party in your mouth. Yum. \n\nSo, had the service been up to par and had they not been out of the Rotisserie chicken at 8pm on a Sunday night, Limon Rotisserie definitely would've been a five star review in my book.

What a fool I was. This place seamlessly merges great food, great service, and more-than-reasonable prices into a ball of rotisserie perfection. The food here has been written up in detail in ways much more clever than I could ever hope to write, so I'll keep it brief. \n\nCeviche Mixto - Very flavorful (with a slight, spicy aftertaste) take on the classic ceviche dish. Was composed of red snapper, calamari, shrimp, onions, and choclo. My only critique of this appetizer was I wish there was more (it was split among 3 people). \n\nThe Full Rotisserie Chicken Meal with Two Sides. I think this is one of the better, if not best, deals in town. For $17.95 you get a full chicken and two sides. Enough to feed 3 very hungry people, and I would guess that it's probably enough for 4. The chicken itself was juicy and succulent, maybe not the very best ever (I think that title still belongs to Zaki's), but awfully close. The spiced flavor of the skin was mouth watering and in my opinion complimented the chicken perfectly. This was accompanied by a side of sweet potato fries and choclo (Peruvian corn). The sides were both good, but next to the chicken they seemed like nothing special. \n\nDessert was a Panna Cotta with a mango coulis. I'm not usually a big dessert guy, but this was awesome. The panna cotta was solid and the taste kind of reminded us of vanilla ice cream. The mango coulis (I think that was what the dollop of goodness was) was the real standout here, it was amazingly rich and flavorful. \n\nSangria - The sangria was a little more tart than I'm used to, but once I had a few drinks it really grew on me. \n\nAnd the service. Even though the place was ridiculously packed, every single person here from the host all the way up to manager went out of their way to make us feel accommodated. And not in that overbearing, uncomfortable, and trying too hard sort of way, but in an honest, friendly, and efficient sort of way that said they really appreciated everyone's business. \n\nSimply put, what Limon is able to do should be the standard for all restaurants.", "author": "David L."}

I'm not the biggest fans of beans so this wasn't my my favorite and the breading was a little thick, but I still found it really tasty. The vegetables were a mixture of green beans, yellow beans and onions. They had a nice roasted flavor and weren't too salty. \n\nWe also started our meal with a ceviche mixto, which came with fish, calamari and shrimp. I liked the citrus marinade and the seafood was fresh. I would say that the ceviche is on par with La Mar (although La Mar has different marinades, Limon only has 1 marinade).\n\nThe bill came and it was $24 for the two of us. Seriously!?

She's been wanting to go to a tapas bar but only if she had a big group so we could try different things; yesterday was her opportunity! We were a group of 8 and made reservations (even though the website says they don't, my friend called to inquire a couple days in advance...and they accommodated our group).\n\nWalking in, it looks small, probably about 40 people can fit. I think there's more space downstairs, but I didn't get a chance to check it out.\n\nThe food: Two of our friends are allergic to seafood, so we opted not to get any of the ceviche since it wouldn't be fair. We ordered the following:\n\n(2) pitchers of sangria: this sangria is pretty delicious, but i just wasn't in the mood to drink it... i merely sipped every 20 minutes or so. hhaha it's pretty sweet, so be prepared if you don't like sugary drinks.\n\n(2) Whole chickens: each came with 2 sides of our choice and 3 sauces. We chose tacu-tacu, papas fritas, choclo, and sweet potato fries.  When I come back, I'd skip out on the choclo (giant sweet corn.) b/c the texture isn't what I'm used to.  Chicken was juicy and had LOTS of flavor! The sauces that accompanied it was also delicious. I didn't know which was which, but I ended up mixing all three together to make one SUPER sauce!\n\n(2) Empanadas Carne and (2) Vegetales: The meat empanadas were ok.  Not horrible, but I surprisingly preferred the vegetable ones (they have mushrooms -eek!).\n\n(1) Lomito saltado: next time, I'd skip this, but I'm not big on beef. Everyone seemed to enjoy this dish though, but not as much as the next item....\n\n(1) Carne a la parilla: I know I just said I'm not big on beef, but THIS WAS DELICIOUS. the meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection (not too try/well done). I'd definitely get this again. It also came w/ a tacu-tacu!\n\n(1) Chicharron de pollo: This was ok, I think the frying of the chicken made it a little too tough/dry, but it still tasted good with the salsa they serve it with!\n\nAtmosphere: 4/5 - a lil too crowded when full but nice interior and it isn't too loud\n\nFood: 5/5 - although some dishes were better than others, all of them were delicious! it's all a matter of preference I think.  Size wise, all the dishes combined fed 8 people (4 girls, 4 guys, however, the girls didn't eat as much as the guys since we got fuller quicker!)\n\nService: 5/5 - our server was amazing! I wish I got his name, but he was very patient with us as we asked so many questions about the food and his recommendations. =) Water was always being refilled. Our friend dropped a knife on the floor and literally 2 seconds later, a busboy came and said \"don't worry! i got it!\" and replaced it with a clean one!

After searching high and low through Yelp, I found Limon! I was surprised when the receptionist continuously allowed me to increase my party size. She just kept saying \"no problem.\" So in the end, I was able to book a ten person reservation on a Friday night... almost unheard of in the city! (I later discovered that the popular Limon is located on Valencia, so that may be why they were able to accommodate all of us.)\n\nSince none of us had tried Limon and everything on the menu was to our liking, we decided to give complete control to our waiter. It was a very good decision! Every plate was so flavorful and every slice of meat was succulent. We definitely got a great taste of Peruvian cuisine. \n\nAnd after all the dishes were cleared out and we had finished each pitcher of sangria, we got the dreaded bill.

I've had my fair share of trying different places, especially back in SoCal. \n\nLimon was my first Peruvian cuisine experience in the city... and it didn't disappoint! It was exciting to see that they incorporated the huacatay (traditional peruvian cooking herb) sauce in the meal as an optional dipping sauce for yucca frita and pollo a la brasa, because I have rarely seen huacatay in the U.S. Also, I tried out the ceviche de pescado which was pretty good. The taste is excellent, but I wish they had included more of the sides that come along with it. If they would have added a handful of cancha (popped corn) and just a little bit more of the sweet potato, I think I would have given this place 5 stars.\n\nThey're chicha morada (sweetened purple corn drink) is alright.... but I feel like they we're missing certain ingredients that would have made the drink more authentic and tastier. From what I recall, you can really taste hints of cinnamon and lime in Chicha Morada. But at Limon, their bottled chicha just wasn't cutting it for me. \n\nConsidering this place is a Peruvian \"fusion\" restaurant, they do a pretty good job at maintaing the authenticity of Peruvian food, while adding some modern, fresh elements to it.", "author": "Daisy V."}

I don't think I could function without it, and eat it grilled, baked, julienned, you name it, at least every other day. For the price point, Limon is a wonderful option on those nights you don't have the energy to cook a meal yourself- a half roast chicken, 2 sides, a small plate, and peruvian beer (Mmm Mmm) will cost you less than $30 and its more than enough for two people. \n\nEverything was outstanding- the salad of vegetales, the sweet potato fries, and the braised boneless beef short ribs (YOU MUST ORDER THIS!)....but the one thing I wasn't as crazed over, was the very thing everyone comes here for: THE CHICKEN! It was flavorful, indeed, but a little dry. If fact, dry to the point that I considered saying something but opted against it as no one else at other tables seemed disappointed with their poultry. Do I really make that mean of a chicken? That no one else's can compare?? This is highly probable. Its also probably we got a half of a chicken that was on the rotisserie just a minute or two too long- which can make for all sorts of bad when roasting at such high levels of heat.\nDid I devour it all? Si, por supuesto! It wasn't terrible, but the hype may have parched my mouth a bit.\n\nI would and will definitely go back to try some other small plates, sides, and give that chicken one more try.

I'm still new to the Peruvian food world, but this was oh so very good! whether you're familiar with Peruvian food or not. \n\nI had heard about Limon through a lot of different friends - friends from SF and from LA... so I had had this place bookmarked for some time... and then someone at work introduced me to awesome Peruvian food for the first time, and thus my interest in Limon further peaked and I knew I had to come give this place a try. I made a reservation through OpenTable knowing this place would be busy... unfortunately, we we're about 10 minutes late and our table was given away. It would of been nice to have received a call to confirm, but I guess that's not how they roll (just fyi)... We ended up waiting about another 10 minutes, and got seated downstairs - where it was much emptier, quieter, and more intimate than the busy main-floor, yay! The downstairs was much more open and roomy in comparison to the main-floor, and came stocked with its own bar... so I can see the downstairs also being very busy and lively when parties start coming in...\n\nOur (tr)eats:\n-- Pa Bravo Yo Cocktail ($9) | 5 stars\nPassion fruit, diced strawberries, and elderflower pisco... strong but well concealed with fruity goodness, what more can a girl ask for? (;\n\n--1/2 Pollo a la Brasa w/ choice of two sides ($9.95) | 4.5 stars \nThe star of the show... the roasted chicken was succulent and well seasoned -you could eat it with or without the Aji sauces, and you would still be happy. The three sauces (a roasted chile sauce, a garlic cilantro sauce, and a Chimichurri sauce) were all very good ... favorite execution of the Aji sauces of all the Peruvian establishments I've tried - yum! For sides, we picked the tacu-tacu (bean and rice mixture) and yacu (root potato) fries. I wasn't a fan of the tacu-tacu, it was like eating grainy refried bean... meh. I did however really like the yuca fries and would definitely recommend getting them; they're OH SO DELICIOUS! starchy and sweet, and a perfect accompaniment with the chicken and with the sauces.\n\n--\"Lomito\" Saltado ($9.75) | 3.5 stars\nThe Peruvian carne asada fries, and a staple in Peruvian cuisine. Good and well prepared sirloin, nice overall flavors, but nothing extraordinary that I would order again... not to say its not worth a try.\n\nPrices are a little high for the portions being a bit small; but the quality and execution is just perfect - don't come starving and you'll be fine... Service was nothing extraordinary, but our water cups were never empty - so no too many complaints there.

We asked the matire d' what was up, and he informed us that the party of 20 had paid but was lingering. Come on! You bump us back 2 hours and then let this group sit around for a good 20 minutes after paying while we stand out in the cold?! They don't boot the party till 9:15 at which point I was beyond fed up. I tell the maitre d' that bumping reservations is a deplorable business practice, that they won't receive my business, and that they'll receive a yelp review warning others.

I thought it tasted good.\n\nSmall cold plate: Ceviche de Pescado y Camaron halibut fillet and tiger shrimp---- nice thick slices of halibut, not sure if i noticed the tiger shrimp. Tasted fresh and lime sauce was good.  \n\nSmall hot plate: Carne a la Parrilla grilled hanger steak over tacu-tacu---- Great dish. The tacu tacu was a rice and bean pancake that went really well with the hanger steak. The steak was drenched in a smoky tasting sauce that i really liked as well. I would order this again. \n\nSides: Yucca fries and Arroz----- The yucca fries were good though, let's face it, a lot of fried things automatically taste good. Tasted like fried yam/potato hybrid and looked like fat cuts of steak fries. B pointed out that the arroz (like oversized corn kernels) tasted better steamed than they did in the ceviche sauce. We also ordered all 4 of their sauces. The sauces made the meal more interesting because I pretty much dipped everything we ordered into each sauce at least once. \n\nHalf rotisserie chicken----- was enough for two people to share. this surprised me because maybe it was too hyped. Not that great,  Christina was right. The dark meat was way salty and this made the white meat just right. i give them credit for making white meat taste tender and juicy... but sadly at the expense of the dark meat. Yeah, I ate the skin..and it was damn salty as well (spoken by someone who loves salt). \n\nRaspberry and mango panna cotta---- This had excellent presentation and had a light creamyness to it, not too sweet and went well with the mango (which was like a mousse) and raspberry sauce. \n\nOverall, this place was good but didn't live up to the hype. The truth is, I would not come here for chicken at all.... Also, the servers were nice yet had a little trouble keeping our order straight.", "author": "Justine C."}

We got the prix fixe, family style menu for our party and they served it promptly. It's actually a good deal for all of the food they serve you, at $25/person. It came with the famous pollo a la brasa. It IS good, but I've had better pollo a la brasa at other establishments and in Peru...the skin wasn't that crispy.

Being a solo diner but wanting to try as much as possible, I got a piece of dark meat with the peruvian rice and salad (comes with 2 sides) and the small ceviche. The chicken was the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had, made even more superb by the trio of sauces it was served with. The salad and rice were also quite spectacular.\n\nUnfortunately, the ceviche didn't do it for me. It was INCREDIBLY spicy! It had been marinated in and was served with a spicy red pepper, either a jalapeno or serrano, I couldn't tell which. Either way, it was too spicy for me to eat. It's only served with 2 taro chips, and when I asked for more to cut the spice, they charged me $3.50 for the chips :( It was also the most tart ceviche I've ever had - way more lime than was necessary.

Limon is a fun and unpretentious restaurant that serves well for a family, friends, or date spot but more importantly it delivers memorable food.\n\nFor a large group you can order many tapas styled plates but do not hesitate to order multiple dishes of pollo, jalea, tacu-tacu, and probably the best yucca I've ever tasted.

Until, that is, freshman year at the dorms. There's just something about being thrown into a forced living situation with several dozen of your peers that makes for an instant bonding experience. It's like prison, minus the part where your roommate makes you his bitch. Well, for most people. \n\nAnyway, one of the reasons I relish my occasional San Francisco work trips is for the chance to catch up with these old college friends, some of whom I've now known for over a decade. It was on such a trip recently that we decided to check out Limon Rotisserie for a small group dinner. We love using my visits to the city as an impetus to try out new food; we seem to gravitate towards shareable food, so tapas-style places are a recurring option. It was no surprise then, that we chose to go to Limon Rotisserie as we could share the rotisserie chicken and order 1-3 small plates each and a) have plenty of food to go around, and b) be able to try a great variety of tasty dishes.\n\nThe chicken, as it should be, was a great centerpiece to the meal, with the crispy skin particularly standing out. The ceviche mixto was lightly tart, with the seafood cooked in the acidic juices just enough. The fried yucca was so good we had to order it twice. In fact, when we finished the first round of dishes, we all looked at each other, took a beat... and one of us said \"I think I could eat more.\" We were all relieved, because we'd all been thinking the same thing. In fact one of the guys had already started silently wondering what he had to snack on at home since we clearly hadn't filled up. \n\nAll in all we ended up ordering probably 3/4 of the small plates menu, plus 2 pitchers of sangria. Speaking of the devil, that sangria is the devil's juice... if the devil was a handsome swarthy Peruvian gentleman with a deft touch with rioja, brandy and fruits.\n\nOur small group is like a favorite sweater at this point - you don't always break it out, but it's always comfortable when you do, and it always brings back good memories. As we ate and drank and generally made merry, we didn't realize that eventually we were the last party in the place. And yet our servers never forcibly ushered us out, or even intruded in the smallest way; not a clearing of the throat or a noticeable banging of silverware, none of that. When we did finally notice that we were holding up the restaurant's closing, we kept right on ignoring them and went back to our conversation. Actually, no, we decided that it was finally time to call it a night and bade each other our fare-thee-wells. Until next time...", "author": "Mike Q."}

The policy of only seating once half the party arrived was not an issue, what was an issue was the hypocrisy of telling me you'd seat us when half of us were there\nAnd then refusing to do so. And then refusing to sit 2 members of the group, which I didn't mention that the group size was still under the size given when we made reservations. The rudeness and lack of consideration from the manager began upon arrival, so it was definitely not a matter of us staying too long. Our experience was obviously not as pleasant as yours have been.\n\nBelow is my original review\n\nThe food here at Limon Rotisserie is great. This review is mainly about the awful service my party and I were given this weekend. I can't explain in full detail as it would take a novel but I'll just say we were treated as if they were doing us a favor by allowing us to eat there. We had reservations for our group gathering. Upon arrival we were told seating would commence when half the group arrived. Within 5 minutes over half the group was there and then the manager was asking for a recount of the final group size and still didn't want to seat us. Once we were seated it seemed like the setup was just thrown together in some U-shaped mess where people in certain areas of the tables had their backs to other members of the group. 2 additional friends ended up arriving and the manager literally refused to seat them saying this exceeded the number I gave him as if this was fire code or something, I'm a paying customer who chose his restaurant for a special\nOccasion and he's gonna refuse to seat friends of mine? Not good business practice or just etiquette in general if you ask me. Finally he acts like he is doing me a favor and brings 2 more chairs. Anyway we had a good dinner but the check was brought before the birthday cake was even served, I felt we were being rushed out. Funny theyd be trying to get rid of a group that tallied up to this point almost $600 dollars worth of food and drinks and had done\nNothing wrong other than miscalculate our group size. So ok we do the cake I settle up the bill and then a member of the group buys some rounds of drinks for everyone. Well at this point the waiters and busboys all\nCome\nIn and basically start removing chairs and whatever they can and the manager keeps coming over looking as if he wants us to go. We're not just loitering we're still at this point paying customers. We finish up and leave I briefly spoke with the manager on the way out and told him it was regrettable about the confusion, just trying to be the bigger man. I don't know if this is par for the course there with larger groups or if they were overwhelmed or what but it seemed like they made it way more difficult than it needed to be. I was very disappointed as I have been to Limon multiple times and didn't expect this. Like I said the food is great so I will probably still call in my order for pickup but don't know if I'd want to eat in after this.", "author": "Nick R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-30", "description": "We absolutely LOVE the Lim\u00f3n family restaurants.  They have made us extremely fond of Peruvian food. Our first taste of their gastronomical expertise was at their Fresno location.  Ever since then we've been craving more. Timing finally allowed us to drive up north to the city as this was the spot where my wife wanted to have her birthday dinner. Reservations were set and we were excited because we knew we were in for a treat. The neighborhood is questionable and parking is nonexistent but then again this is San Francisco. Luckily after driving in circles I found a parking spot right next to the restaurant. The line was out the door and people were standing in every spot possible. It was insanely windy outside so nobody wanted to be out there. I felt bad for the servers and patrons near the door as this is a small restaurant and to top it off you have people just standing and waiting to be seated. We did not let any of that deter us as the wonderful aroma in the air enhanced the anticipation. There was a small crowded bar at one corner and we squeezed in as soon as a couple that left was seated. Of course we had to order their Sangria which till this day is the best tasting Sangria EVER. The wait to be seated was longer than we would've hoped for but we understood because this place was so freaking packed. Even then the waiters moved along happy and made everyone feel comfortable. At one point a chick came in with her baby in a car seat and we just remember thinking...\"oh oh\". But the waiters gladly helped her out. It seemed like nothing stressed these guys out.    \n\nOur names were finally called and our server Eduardo moved us and our Sangrias over to our table. The entire time he was upbeat, informative and fairly quick considering the dinner rush. The menu was much simpler than the one in Fresno and it seemed mostly everything minus the Rotisserie chicken was served tapas style. But we easily found many things we wanted to try. The restaurant itself is simple and small with tables in every spot possible. Not my first choice for her birthday dinner but since wifey wanted her ceviche it was a go.\n\nCeviche Mixto - This stuff just melted in your mouth. Tops in the ceviche world. My wife was in heaven. $9.25\n\nChicharron de Pollo - Wow...easily the best tasting piece of chicken I've ever had...I'm salivating right now just thinking of it. $8.00\n\nCamaron a la Parilla - The shrimp was good. Nothing spectacular if anything on the cold side but still good. $8.50\n\nCarne a la Parilla - Amazing slices of meat. Juicy and tender coated with a finger licking $8.95\n\nSangria pitcher - Light & refreshingly DELICIOUS - Get one or two.  \n\nG-Catalpa Malbec - I didn't care much for this Spanish wine. I've yet to find a Spanish wine I care for.  I find them to be too strong. $8.50\n\nOur meal was perfect. The service was tops. Oh and those dipping sauces were so good I could drink them straight up. We did miss some of their items in the Fresno location but that was not a big deal. We made sure to tell Eduardo how great the food and service was and that's when he told us how much he appreciated the comments.  It turned out to be that he was one of the owners. He was so happy we enjoyed ourselves and he told us we had to try their other SF location. We haven't tried it yet but we will. On my way to the restroom I discovered a stairway downstairs. It was a smaller room with more tables and what appeared to be a small dance floor and dj booth. Eduardo told me at night it turns into a club and we could return for free if we liked. Too bad we already had plans for the night otherwise we would've checked it out. As we wrapped up they brought my wife complimentary birthday treat with candles.  I believe it was their bandido dessert which is a Flourless chocolate cake, with brandy chocolate sauce bananas and lucuma cr\u00e8me anglaise. We were stuffed and we are not chocolate fans but it was good...especially those bananas. These guys know what they are doing and it shows all across the board. We are huge fans. Needless to say we tipped him generously. \n\nWe heart Lim\u00f3n and we can't wait to return. Give it a try...I think you too will be addicted.", "author": "Rav V."}

I didn't like it much cuz i couldn't taste the vinagrette...\n\nPollo a la Brasa: ***** now this is why you come here... the chicken NEVER disappoints... and the green sauce with the cilantro and garlic... mmm to die for!\n\nLomito Saltaldo: **** this was delicious too but I was already in love with the chicken.\n\nChicharron de Pollo: *** this was flavorful... but I just don't like having to deal with small bones and such...\n\nPapas Fritas: *** how can you go wrong with french fries??? :)\n\nSangria: ***** always delicious.... mmm next time tho... i promise myself i'll try some of their cocktails...\n\nMolten Chocolate cake: *** meh... i've had better... \n\nthe food was delicious... was it worth the wait and me being angry at the service??? no... but would I come here again??? heck yes! but i would recommend only coming here in small groups... maybe at most a group of 4 so that service would be better and you would sit upstairs were you would be less likely to be forgotten. this place gets two stars for their horrible service... seriously my party got seated at 9:30 (closer to 9:45 i think).... we didn't order til 10:15... service was just so slow... and we were trying to get complimentary desserts cuz their service was sub  par for such a big group of people... you would think they would be more attentive and apologetic for seating us so late... -_-;;; but no... n we had to wait FOREVER for our food and our check... we didn't leave the restaurant until 12:15.... n that's horrible... considering we had reservations for 9. -_-;;; and gosh the price... $45+ per person???? i don't remember paying that much when I was there the last time...\n\nConclusion: come here in small parties (i.e. 6 or less) in order to be seated upstairs and get better and quicker service. I'm basing this on experience cuz I have been here before with a party of 6 and we went in for lunch around 1 and were out the door by 2:30. the wait wasn't that long and service was prompt and courteous.", "author": "Anne H."}

Some of our favorite dishes were: Chicharron de Pollo, \"Lomito\" Saltado and of course the rotisserie Chicken!!\n\nI had brought in a cake and Antonio (GM) did let me know that there would be a $2/person cake cutting fee, which I thought was fair (they sliced, served and brought glasses of water for everyone). At the end of the night, our party of 14, was filled with great food, slightly buzzed with amazing sangria and each walked out the door throwing down $30/person (including tax & tip). \n\nI can't say enough of how great Limon Rotisserie is!

Ordered the tuna tar tar, half chicken, mac & cheese, chicharon, lomito soltado, jallela and some other stuff, but the tuna tartar and chicken were the best dishes in my opinion. The tuna tartar was tasty and the combination of the soft texture of the tuna and the crunchiness of the chip together was AWESOME. The chicken was nice and moist.

We were even charged for extra plate that we didn't order.  The only time we saw our waitress was to place our order and to give us the bill.\nThe manager and the staff had a big discussion to provide us with plates and silverware for the custom made cake that was brought to celebrate our friends 50th bday. No policies were informed to us prior to bringing the cake, and the cake got there way before our party did.  For being in the customer service industry, this was by far the worse I have ever been treated and at a restaurant. \nThe food was great...compliments to the chef, but the front of house needs a lot of work. Sent out an Email to the manager in regards to our horrible experience, and I've yet to hear from him, shows how much they don't care about the diner's experience. \nHopefully they'll fix the problems at hand and we can return and have a better experience at some point.

After waiting for 40 mins for our food it still had not arrived.. I asked the server if it was coming soon? and he applogized and stated it was due to it being so busy, which I understood... after he left me and my husband were chit chatting and on my wall that we were sitting against was a roach!

I Stood there quietly and told the second server that there was a roach crawling on the wall.. he looked and say \"OH MY GOD,I'LL BE BACK\".. I got off my seat since it was coming closer to me... he then came back and killed it and said he was sorry, honestly after that I couldn't eat there anymore, I felt disgusted! And I didn't want to cause a scene since there were so many people there...I am not that kind of person.... so we left and as we walked upstairs the Lady manager came to us and asked what happened.. and she said \"I am so sorry about that..would you like to seat upstairs here in the main floor?\" I said No sorry but we can't eat here anymore... and we left.... it was a bad experience, people were friendly but just felt sick to my stomach after seeing that!.

Limon!\n\nMy friend and I came here for dinner yesterday evening.  Since Limon doesn't take reservations, we showed up early (before 6 pm).  The place was still relatively empty, but in 30 minutes almost every table was occupied.\n\nLimon's decor is minimalistic, i.e., just the bare necessities.  Wooden tables with no tablecloths were very close to one another.  Three square inches of space separated the hostess podium and the adjacent tables from the entryway.  A big open kitchen took up a large part of the restaurant, leaving little room for the actual dining area.\n\nOur waiter came by right away and offered us drinks.  I ordered iced tea, as I usually do.  He returned a couple of minutes later and informed me that they didn't have iced tea.  Strange, but OK.  \"Just water then, thanks.\"\n\nWe were really looking forward to trying their chicken.  Big Eats SF suggests that it's a \"must try.\"  We ordered a half a chicken, and I have to say I wasn't too impressed.  I mean, it was very moist and fresh, but I didn't care for the spices they had used.  Also, if you are trying to impress your date or a business partner, I would skip the chicken altogether.  If there were an elegant way to eat a half chicken, I haven't found it.  If you come here thinking that chicken is the star of the show, may I suggest trying another theater?\n\nAlthough it doesn't explicitly say so on the menu, chicken comes with two sides.  We ordered sweet potato fries and yucca fries, both of which were delicious.  They came with two dipping sauces, each of which tasted a little bit like the chutneys you get at Indian restaurants.  I could totally see myself eating a pound of sweet potato fries dipped in the tangy, spicy sauces.  YUM.\n\nThe rest of the dishes are served on small plates; some hot, some cold.  We ordered the halibut ceviche, which was delicious.  It was served with onions, lime juice, a couple of varieties of corn and a slice of sweet potato.  The halibut was very fresh, and the ceviche was really good.  We also tried the Lomito Saltado, a dish of braised beef tenderloin, onions, fries and soy sauce.  I was very surprised when they asked us how we wanted the beef prepared, but I was not surprised when they overcooked it.  The beef was very stringy to begin with, and overcooking it made it more chewy than I would have liked.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that every dish tasted really salty.  When I came home, I drank 1 1/2 large bottles of San Pellegrino just to quench my thirst.  So  ... salty!  Maybe if I had gotten my iced tea . . .\n\nIt seems like a pretty good deal though (I didn't pay), but if you order a few small plates, it might add up quickly!", "author": "Yan G."}

Of course, we were told we could wait at the bar, which was so crowded there was no room because of the 20-odd other people waiting for tables. A place this popular might want to consider expanding the bar to save people like us from hanging out awkwardly by the door. \n\nI'm allergic to gluten, and am always looking for menus that help me navigate to safe and tasty options. Limon did some good by pointing out which dishes were made with soy sauce (which contains wheat) (Peruvian food? Made with SOY SAUCE?). On the other hand, apparently \"crispy\" is their shorthand for \"breaded in flour and fried,\" which was not explained. It meant not only could I not eat any of the \"crispy\" items, but none of the frites either, because they're fried in the same grease as the battered items. This limited the menu for me to the chicken, some of the ceviches, and some of the sides. \n\nThe chicken was tasty, but very dry -- saved mainly by the dipping sauces that came with it. The ceviche was fresh, tangy and spicy. The giant corn-on-the-cob was fun and tasty. The salad (the only green stuff on the menu) was nondescript. The sangria was decent, but watered down with too much ice. The wine list was short, but I had a nice malbec that went with my chicken. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the flourless chocolate cake, which was lovely -- except the only reason I knew it was flourless was because someone had told me. It didn't say so on the menu, it just said \"Limon's favorite.\" I would have otherwise missed out on this rich and yummy dessert, simply because I wouldn't have known it was safe to eat. \n\nService was warm and helpful, but nothing overly special. Unfortunately, my date and I could barely hear each other because the restaurant is so freaking noisy.

The seafood ceviche also makes a great appetizer. I've also tried the mac and cheese, and my friends liked it. But it was a little to heavy for my taste (it wasn't really Homeroom in Oakland status or anything IMO). For two people, a whole chicken, 2 sides, 2 appetizers, and a drink leaves you full and even with leftovers. For three people with this same amount, you'll leave feeling comfortably full :) \n\nDrinks- Tried the piso sour before.. lol the egg whtie drop in the description intrigued me. To be honest, this drink was eh... A little strong/bitter like for my taste. Probably not going for that again. Also tried Sangria too here, and getting a pitcher of that is great for groups!\n\nAccommodation/Atmosphere- It's very chill and relaxing spot. Their family style menu definitely makes it easy to share food for larger parties. I also like their open table reservation online. I've never had to wait long to get seated when I came here. Only exception is that for larger parties, they do require that your whole party is present before being seated. \n\nPrice- You can easily have a cheap and full dinner here for two/three over the whole chicken combo and an appetizer at $20-$30 total. Split family style for larger groups, not bad at all!\n\nParking- Let me tell you, when I think of any restaurants in the city- it's full of cringe and ughhhhz at the thought of finding parking. However, the location of Limon is out of downtown so parking is not bad at all! You might have to circle a little bit, but I've always found a spot on S. Vaness or 21st/20th and walk a little.\n\nService- Service isn't superb or over the top I'd say. It's just alright... For some reason their servers aren't very cheery or upbeat- they're kind of rushy too.  Was here for lunch one time, and the server just kind of  threw the dessert menu in front of me..  Not nice.  But all good- I'm here for the food anyway so it doesn't bother me too much. If they change up their service style and are a little more attentive, this place would definitely get a full 5 stars. \n\nOther than that- a great eat in the City!", "author": "Cindy L."}

We loved everything, although the rotisserie chicken and yuca frites are must-haves if you ever eat here. In addition to a ton of food, we each had a couple glasses of sangria. The final bill? A mere $20 per person.

A whole chicken with two sides (easily enough for two people) is only $16 -- and it's absolutely delicious. The sangria, ceviche and vegetales salteados were also excellent. I'm coming to terms with the fact that I just don't like ceviche all that much but the ceviche at Lim\u00f3n was the best I've had.\n\nI have a feeling I'll quickly become a regular here. Upscale dining for taqueria prices -- that's pretty tough to beat.", "author": "Aaron V."}

The best deal here is obviously the chicken, and the side dishes that come with the chicken are solid as well (e.g., the stir fried veggie, fried yucca, simple steamed rice - I always order rice with the chicken here as the chicken is on the salty side). \n\nNow, if you order the other \"small plates\" and drinks, $ can add up quickly unless you are sharing with a group of people. The decor here is rather simple, and the service can be sporadic. That's why I wouldn't want to wait in line for too long or spend too much money here.

From the name you're probably going to be tempted to focus on their rotisserie chicken, which is fantastic and worth it, but make sure to sample something from all over their menu.

It's the same food and menu as the main part of the restaurant. So far, it's much mellower and less crowded than upstairs. So on a crowded dinner night, I recommend asking to be seated in the lounge. The lounge is lit with cool pink lighting. Yes, the electronic music in the background is a tad annoying, but it's not too loud to overpower dinner conversation.

I usually don't like eating the skin on chicken, but at Limon, you HAVE to eat the skin.  It's spiced so well and is the best part of the whole dish.

The yucca fries were good, but being a ketchup fanatic, I felt like I couldn't enjoy it as much because we didn't get any ketchup.  =(\n\nThe ceviche was served cold, and the fish was so fresh and firm that it was almost crunchy, not mushy.  The restaurant is rather warm so this dish was a nice contrast for the palette.  The lemon/lime marinade provided the perfect amount of acid and was really refreshing.\n\nWe got the steak medium rare, and it was perfectly done.  The sauce for the hangar steak dish was way too salty, but the tacu tacu was so good!  I'm not sure what it is, but it tasted like a big ball of rice and potatoes, fried on the outside.

Peeps trying to do the same thing:  the stop is Mission and 24th.  You're within a few blocks (Limon is between 21st and 22nd) and the walk is quite entertaining.

It's a good deal, too, so I will have to come back and try it.

Beautiful succulent pieces of halibut filet perfectly marinated with a sublime potion of fresh lime juice and minced garlic.  My friend is allergic to shrimp and, lately, I cannot stomach shrimp (most likely, due to another friend allergic to crustacean), thus our chef/host prepared it with only halibut.  Sigh, love such service!\n\n\"Lomito\" Saltado - This is a traditional Peruvian dish of stir-fried top sirloin strips, onions, tomato, soy sauce and served with fries.  The fries were okay, but the meat was way too salty and not too tender.\n\nThe chicha morada was off-the-hook refreshing with its dizzying spin of sweet, spicy, and fruity.

I recently came by around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon...I honestly thought it was 12:30pm and I was mystified by how empty the restaurant was...just a side story to illustrate the occasional airheaded-ness of your intrepid reviewer. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the half rotisserie chicken with tacu-tacu (some sort of bean/rice fritter) and roasted corn kernels (totally forget the name of this but it started with a \"c\"). We also ordered the \"lomito\" saltado. All of it was interesting and yummy. I loved that the rotisserie chicken came with two sauces, one orange and one green, both tasty. I really liked the seasoning, although I think the chicken could have had a lot more meat to it. Thank goodness this wasn't a first date because I ended up using my fingers to pull the meat away from the bones and licking them! The \"lomito\" saltado, a dish of stir-fried strips of beef with tomatoes, onions, and soy sauce, was nicely cooked. I loved the French fries that were soaked in the sauce. Yum. (Btw don't get the \"papas fritas\" as one of your rotisserie chicken side dishes because they really are just your average shoestring fries, not some sort of cool Peruvian fried potato dish). I was impressed by the tenderness of the beef. The dish, however, was quite salty. In fact, everything ate was sodium crazy; I felt thirsty all afternoon! \n\nOne thing that helped push Limon Rotisserie to a full five stars was the price. The total came to $12.50 each, including tip and tax. Granted, this was for lunch...but if it had been dinner, I think we would have still been satisfied with the amount of food we got. The $16.95 whole rotisserie chicken with two very generous sides would be a great meal for a family. I love reasonably priced, yummy, sit-down, waiter-service restaurants and Limon Rotisserie is definitely one of them.", "author": "Ada T."}

I usually shy away from eating chicken in most cases (unless it's fried!) after being scarred by the dry, flavorless baked chicken I grew up eating as a kid. (Sorry, mom.)\n\nBut when I heard the buzz about the rotisserie chicken here, I of course had to try it. Hallelujah, I have come to the promised land when it comes to chicken! The bird was very well-seasoned, and the meat so tender and juicy. The chicken also came with a selection of 3 sauces to dip it in - all of them were dee-lish! \n\nAnd the ceviche was to die for...probably the best that I've had to date. All of the items were so fresh - an ideal dish for the recent warm weather that we've been having!\n\nThis is a great place to try if you're looking for incredible food and not trying to break the bank. The chicken alone is a great option, as you can order a whole chicken (serves 4) with two side dishes for $17.

I had an 8:30 reservation, but didn't get seated until around 9:15. Then the server took his time to get to us. I had sort of wished there would be some traditional Peruvian music playing in the background (which I have experienced at other Peruvian restaurants and rather enjoy -- it makes the experience a little more authentic), but alas, there was no music at all. Just the sound of people shouting over other voices. The food, while it tasted okay, wasn't quite par for traditional Peruvian. The potatoes in the lomito saltado are like something you'd get from McDonalds, and they're not crispy at all. I will give them credit for the fried yuca -- that was really good. The pollo a la brasa, the dish they are supposedly most well-known for, was okay, but again, not quite like the pollo a la brasa I've had in Peru, and according the the professional Peruvian I'm married to, none of the food was like he has had in Peru (having lived there for 33 years of his life, he would know). He also said the Pisco Sour wasn't good, not like the kind he has had in his mother country. He was disappointed, and so was I. I make better lomo saltado not even knowing the exact recipe. Aside from the disappointing food and long wait to be seated, the server was slow getting us the check, which was annoying. We were completely done with everything and we were just sitting there, waiting. We had wanted to catch a movie, but missed it because of the untimely service. The desserts were good -- we shared profiteroles and chocolate bandito, but they are super expensive for the amount you get, and not really worth it in my opinion. The only good highlight of the night came from a pair of other customers (not the restaurant) who said they bought too much sangria and offered to share with us. Oh, and they didn't even have a couple of things on the menu that we would have expected at a Peruvian restaurant, like papa a la huancaina. Actually, they didn't have any appetizers at all.\n\nIf you want good Peruvian food at reasonable prices and portions, I recommend Furia Chalaca in Oakland or Isabella's in San Jose.\n\nOh, P.S., there's only street parking and good luck with that in San Francisco. There is a parking garage up 21st between Mission and Valencia, but tonight (Saturday night) at 8:30 it was full. So there's that.", "author": "Rachelle R."}

I really couldn't be more impressed with this place.  We went on a Friday night, so it was packed to the brim, but we went up to the bar and bought a pitcher of sangria to help pass the time.  There weren't any places left to sit at the bar, but one of the waiters actually went in the back and brought us out 3 chairs so we could sit with our pitcher while we waited.  Once we got seated at a table, we were already kind of drunk from the super strong sangria and started ordering one of everything.  However, a few things stuck out in my mind:\n\n--Ahi tuni was particularly melt-in-your-mouth amazing.\n--Ceviche de camaron was the most unusual and refreshing blend of flavors I've had in a dish in a long time.\n--The steak was cooked perfectly to the right amount of \"doneness.\"\n--Even the yucca fries held their own and came with 3 great dipping sauces (and if I remember correctly, they're only $2 or $3).  They were so good that we got a second order.\n\nWhen we mentioned to our waiter that we had to trek all the way back up to Nob Hill and were dreading finding an empty taxi late on a Friday night, he called the taxi service for us to have one waiting by the time we were ready to leave.

They were really really nice about it. \n\nWe had a group of six people so we ordered a bunch of things to share. Except for the mac and cheese,  everything was awesome. You can't go to Limon Rotisserie without ordering their signature dish the pollo la braza which is rotisserie chicken roasted over an open flame served with their house sauces. I'm not sure honestly what were in the house sauces but I liked all three of them. The ceviche mixto was refreshing and very light. The lomito saltado  and the chicharron de pollo were very tasty. I really like the flavor and texture of the carne de parilla and enjoyed eating the fries that came with it. The yucca fries were different than I expected, perhaps a little sweeter, but they were good. I wanted a fruity drink and our waiter recommended the pa brava yo made with Pisco Peruvian brandy, fresh oranges, passionfruit, diced strawberries, elderflower, and soda water.

Our waiters and servers were attentive and fast.  We ordered two excellent pitchers of sangria for the 5 of us but really struggled with what food to order!  Thankfully our waiter had many suggestions - his list of favorite dishes was like 8 items long - and we managed to pick a few awesome plates.  \n\nWe ordered the Ceviche Mixto to start.  The flavorful marinade was amazingly acidic and spicy.  I loved the halibut, but I think my favorite part was the hominy-like \"choclo-on-the-cob\" and the cancha (read: CORN NUTS!).  Next out was the whole Pollo a la Brasa with sides of the veggies (gotta get the greens) and the yuca frita (gotta balance out the greens with some fried goodness).  The yuca was awesome.  Just awesome.  The pollo was exceptionally cooked and dripped with salt-and-peppery flavor.  It was excellent, especially with both of the table sauces - one minty and one spicy.  They made the chicken soooo moist and juicy.  Incredible.  But I will save the best for last!\n\nThe \"Lomito\" Saltado was tasty but not my favorite.  Surprising, since there were FRENCH FRIES mixed in the dish!!?  Normally that would be a ticket straight to my heart (literally?) but there were other flavors that beat even the indomitable french fry this time.  The Chicharron de Pollo reminded me of some phenomenal KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).... especially with the Vietnamese-style dipping sauce.  Yummaroooo.  We also ordered the short ribs which fell apart upon any contact and reminded me of Mom's pot roast since they were served with taters and carrots.\n\nThe belle of the ball, cream of the crop and other idioms that use alliteration was the Carne a la Parrilla hangar steak.  I adored the charcoal-y flavor of the tender meat and the tangy sauce.  It seriously melted in my mouth.  I saved my last bite of the night so it would be a piece of steak and the quick busboy snatched up my plate so I had to yell out, \"Wait!\" and get him to bring it back to me since I was certainly not done.  It was very worth it.  Please just order this dish.\n\nOh, I am NOT done.  Since we had a birthday girl (woot!) we were served the flourless chocolate cake without knowing what it was..... ummmmm OMG. O.M.GEEEEEE!  In-effing-credible.

I checked the menu and it looked promising because I saw many 5 star reviews.  The Peruvian chicken is good, but the fries are not how we eat them in Peru. The cut is too short and the huancaina sauce it's missing. The chimichurri is out of place, it's an Argentinian sauce. The tacu tacu is spicy and dry.  The thing that was unforgivable it's that chicha morada was not offered at this location anymore. I asked the server and  he confirmed that. Also the desserts are not Peruvian . No leche asada, mazamorra, or even arroz con leche. We don't have anything called Panna cotta in Peru. The prices for the portions that they serve should be half. \nIn Miami's El Chalan restaurant, the Jalea is 5 times the size that it's served here and it costs 16 dollars. The only thing this place has going it's the chicken and even then it misses the mark on what makes a good Peruvian chicken.

Lucky us: five minutes after we were seated there was a line of 20+ people -- a testament to the good food we were about to experience.\n\nWe ordered a whole rotisserie chicken, which comes with two sides and two sauces. We choose the yuca and the vegetables for our sides, and we also split an order of the empanadas.\n\nAll the food arrived at once, and surprisingly quickly. The food has an amazing amount of umami, which left us both thinking, \"This must be Peruvian comfort food.\"\n\nThough a bit salty for our taste, the rotisserie chicken was outstanding with its soy sauce, garlic, and herb rub. True, they could cut the salt by cutting the soy, but then one would lose the umami -- overall we agreed that the salty taste was worth the added flavor. The chicken was better than the other three places we typically purchase rotisserie: Whole Foods, Delessio, and Andronico's.\n\nThe yuca (casava) was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside, but soft and warm on the inside without being gooey, which is too often the case at other restaurants. We used the two dipping sauces liberally, a garlic-aoli-style sauce and a cilantro-based sauce. Delicious.\n\nThe vegetable side dish, comprising yellow wax beans and long green beans with red onions, also had umami thanks to both tomatoes and soy sauce. Truly outstanding as well.\n\nWhile I didn't care much for the empanada crust -- it was a bit greasy -- the beef filling was so satisfying that we wished we had ordered more.  Fantastic!\n\nLastly, the sangria was not overly sweet to my palette as others have commented. I thought it full-bodied, with a crisp fruit overlay from the diced apple and a hint of orange zest. It was a refreshing accompaniment to the meal.\n\nWhile the service was a bit rushed and abrupt, overall we had a good experience. With a 20% tip we spend $23 each, an awesome value considering the quality of the ingredients and the flavorful, satisfying food. And, the leftover chicken will make a wonderful lunch tomorrow. Over the years I've been disappointed with the main restaurant, Limon, but I'm glad to report that the rotisserie offshoot is bound to get my business.

We didn't have a reservation (called to try to make one, but they weren't taking any more for the evening), and we were seated within 10 minutes. Once we sat down, the waiter was SUPER attentive.  He was right there whenever we needed anything and even when we didn't.  Great hospitality if you ask me.\n\nThe food was delicious.  I especially liked the ceviche and yucca fries.  We didn't try the chicken, but I'll come back for that and update the review (this is right around the corner from my house after all).\n\nMy suggestion: Go with a group so you can order a number of dishes and try more yummy things!  BTW, the sangria and the specialty cocktails were GREAT.\n\nThe only unfortunate things about Limon are a) no waiting room if your table isn't ready, and b) what is with the basement?  It just seems weird and creepy down there if there's not a private party taking up the space.", "author": "Gretchen S."}

We arrived around 6:30p on a Wed night and while I was parking, my cousin asked if we could be seated - I found a spot a block away on S. Van Ness. The hostess was like \"Sorry! All parties have to be present!\" Whatever, it's San Francisco and as customers, we've just become accustomed to all these stupid rules (no more than 6 credit cards, parties of 15 or more need to book with a credit card, etc, etc). We were seated close to the short hallway that leads to the bathroom and once seated, we noticed that our booth chair had a big dip in it. The hostess and waitress were buzzing about, paying no attention to our table, so we decided to slide down the booth and move over one table. Literally, 1 seat over - the room was about half full. At that point, a blonde, pudgy waitress decided that she now had time to serve our table. So marched over to first tell us that we just disrupted the seating arrangement of the dining room. Ummm really?!  I won't go on about our exchange but her tone and approach were beyond anything I have EVER experienced. Brash, condescending and unnecessary. Clearly, her tip jar was a little low that week so she probably was feeling a little peeved and decided to take out her frustration on us. Rather than involve myself in a meaningless conversation with this minion, I promptly asked her to dismiss herself from our table and requested to speak with the manager (who, not surprisingly was unapologetic). I will just add that for the rest of the evening, NO ONE was seated at the broken booth chair next to us. So why were we seated there to begin with?? For the rest of the evening, the male waiters kept coming over to our table and checking in on us - they clearly felt bad and I appreciated the effort. Limon's food is \"good\" although in recent years, I think the standard has dropped. They certainly don't need my business, but part of the reason I dine out is for the experience. Good food and wine, AND good service. I've had a few other run ins with them (charged a group bill to my card, did not honor a previously booked reservation) but have always overlooked this because of the food. After last night, I can officially say, I'm good! I'll get my pollo a la brassa fix from Fresca or Pasion, where the ambiance and service are a million times better!", "author": "Ijay J."}

Parental discretion is advised.\n\nIn almost every conceivable way, Limon Rotisserie Chicken represents everything a sensible yet superficial man like myself would want in a woman. Dark and succulent thighs lovingly rubbed with oil, smooth and proportional breasts that satisfy the appetite without achieving gluttony. She is elegant without being pretentious. Her friends are from the neighborhood with exquisite taste but only at the right price in this uncertain economy. And the ceviche, oh baby the ceviche, it's sweet and tender to the touch as it reaches your lips. All of these carnal delights are gently offered in a dark beautiful setting. The ambient music is unobtrusive while subconsciously suggesting a rhythmic sway of the hips. This restaurant is a Marvin Gaye song sung with Angelina Jolie's lips.\n\nIt's almost as good as the real thing. In reality, I'd settle for an Amish girl who sews her own clothes and knows how to churn butter. Hmmm, I wonder where girls like that hang out. If you find out where, send her over to the intimate bar area at Limon Rotisserie. I'll be there. Just tell her to leave the homemade butter at home. The delightful chimichurri sauce here will suffice.\n\n5 stars.", "author": "John T."}

One person from our group was there at the actual time, most of them were there 10minutes later so we all waited first outside, then they took us to the basement and told us the table is just being finished up, then we all had to go back upstairs and wait some more to actually get a table after an hour. Then I don't need a reservation if I am going to wait an hour anyway?! \nIt just seemed super unorganized. Plus, the place was packed so of course everywhere we were standing and waiting people squeezed by etc.\nThe waiter took his time as well to take our order, I am assuming that was because the kitchen was super busy already. \nI saw and spoke to other groups as well who had to wait long for their table so hopefully it was only that night some staff member absolutely messed up the reservations...\nHowever, the food was as expected very delicious. We had the chicken, ceviche mixto, salad, sweet potato fries, steak strips, fried mixed seafood and couple other dishes and everything tasted great. The truffle Mac and Cheese are the bomb by the way and the sangria was great too and not watered down like other places have it.", "author": "Marie F."}

But think of it this way - if you took anyone from the Bay Area out of our community for 2 years, they'd probably start to miss a good burrito after a while.  So as a former Arlington Girl, I was missing some good Peruvian Chicken.\n\nSo how did this rank with my favorite chicken back home (El Pollo Loco on Kenmore).  It was right up there.  It tasted the way it was supposed to taste.  The skin wasn't quite as crisp, but had great flavor.  The sauces were good, and like the best of chicken, fairly unnecessary.\n\nPlus as BONUS they had yucca fries (as does the very good Super Pollo in Ballston) AND all these yummy small plates.  We also had the Ensalada Rusa, Ceviche Mixto, Vegatales Salteados, Tacu-tacu and lomito salteado.  The ceviche and ensalada were very good - but portions were quite small - just enough for each of the 4 of us to get a taste (of course the chicken was quite big, so these were good appetizers and everyhting was more than enough).  The lomito was really really good - its steak and fries...so how could it not be.  The vegetables are so good too - I could eat the whole bowl myself.  The tacu-tacu was interesting.  I liked it, but I'd get yucca fries and vegetables as my 2 sides from now on.  We also shared a pitcher of sangria - super yummy.  And the chocolate cake that even a certain someone who doesn't like chocolate enjoyed. \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient.  Our server (Wendell?) was really nice, and funny, and perfectly attentive with refilling sangria and clearing small plates that had been used.\n\nI will be back - this was a meal that is well worth driving over the bridge for and satiates my obsession with Peruvian chicken", "author": "Gracie B."}

She claimed that it was the best Peruvian food you could ever try in California - she was telling the truth! My family and I are Eastern European; Russian to be exact. From our culture, it's typical to eat a lot of meat and a lot of potatoes, and we love tongue as well. At this quaint and packed restaurant, they served us up the absolute best, hands-down-melt in-your-mouth, juicy, tender tongue that my family and I have ever eaten. In Russian cuisine, the only way tongue ever seems to be eaten is boiled and served alongside sauteed onions. Yet that night, they grilled it, retaining it's meaty texture and bringing everything to a whole different level. Everything from the chicken to the sides were exquisite, and I would definitely recommend sitting down for a dinner here if you ever visit San Fran or live near by.", "author": "Rachel M."}

The hostess and the bartender were extremely  up themselves. I don't think a bartender should be haughty when there is no bar (Beer does not a bar make). Also, the hostess was just straight-up rude. I'd like to tell her that she isn't the bouncer for the next-hottest club, but instead a welcoming host to an eating establishment. \n     We were seated underground. This underground looked like a nightclub...from my nightmares. Really sticky, badly done paint job on the walls, cracked leather seating, and wobbly low tables. And the wait-staff were nowhere to be found. After two people in my party went up to ask for service, the wait staff finally realized that they had to serve us. This would be a great place to bring your friends who like to go to really shady bars and clubs.\n\n*The Food*: \nUnless you are a die-hard chicken rotisserie fanatic, the food was not worth the rude and incompetent staff and gross ambiance. The chicken was tasty and I'm a sucker for ceviche, but the other dishes were a hit or miss. The yucca potatoes were too dry and thick for proper deep-frying, the carne a la parilla (hanger steak) was salty and overdone, the aguadito de pollo was not a chowder-like soup but more of a thick dipping sauce (which we quickly figured out that the \"soup\" was better as a sauce for the rotisserie chicken), and the rest of the dishes I really couldn't remember.\n\n*Would I Eat Here Again?*:\nHell to the No. Even if my friends wanted to come here, I'd peace out on dinner and join them for drinks afterward. Or I would lie to my friends and say that I can't come to their dinner to avoid going to Limon Rotisserie.", "author": "Patricia S."}

I mean, really, really fast service...these guys work like a well-oiled machine.\n\nWe ordered a few tapas plates and were unable to finish it all.  Standouts were:\n1.  The sangria.  Quality ingredients make for a delicious beverage.  I had to have two, just to make sure it was as good as the first.  Yep!  Delish.\n2.  Yuca Fries.  I'd never dreamed that yucca could be sooo delicious, and the sauces provided to embellish them were super duper fantabulistic: one green sauce, and one mustard-y sauce.  The green was sooo good.\n3.  Mixed vegetables served up asados.  To quote James Brown, GOOD GAWD.  Rockin'!\n4.  Tuna Tartar---made me weak in the knees.  A little spicey, served with these fluffy chips...oh, yeah, baby.\n5.  Ceviche.  So very, very delicious.  A medley of seafood slightly sour...sublime.\n\nAs we gnoshed, I glanced up into the mirror hanging above the bar.  I had a good view of just about the whole restaurant in that mirror.  I tell you, there was not one unhappy person within view.  The waiters are fast, efficient, and appear to be weightlifters, because they all filled out their matching brown Limon soccer shirts quite nicely.\n\nTo quote him again, GOOD GAWD!

Occasionally meet a friend here for early dinner after work. My fav is the rotisserie chicken, which comes w/ 2 sides - 6 or so options. I usually have the yuca frita (deep fried yuca - like a big french fry) & tacu tacu (Peruvian version of red beans n' rice). Usually get the quarter [chicken] white [meat] (sooooo tender & super juicy, flavor all the way through). Will cost u about $10 or so. U can also order a half or whole chicken w/ the sides if u bring a good appetite or order w/ friends. Lots of other tasty items on the menu. Everything is prepared well & pretty quickly. Nice staff, clean bathrooms, additional banquet room for large parties or overflow, street parking - usual find a space on the same block as the restaurant. Can get really busy on Friday & Saturday nights, so avoid it all together or put on your patient cap. Also, neighborhood not the most desirable at night.", "author": "Raz M."}

We all joked around that we wanted straws to slurp up the ceviche juice (actually, I wasn't kidding) I usually just want a few bites of ceviche and am ready to move on but I could have had two orders all to myself.\n\nEnsalada Mixta - again, perfectly dressed; a nice, healthy way to start the meal (if you're into that type of thing)\n\nCold Shrimp in dressing - I'm usually not a huge cold shrimp fan but these were great, as was the potato thingy they were served on.\n\n\"Lomito\" Saltado - what's better than steak and fries? Steak and fries stir fried together with incredibly sweet onions!\n\nWhole Rotisserie Chicken w/sides: Yuca Frita and Tacu-Tacu (rice and bean balls) The chicken was as great as before...and we enjoyed the sides so much that we got an extra order of each.\n\nFruit tort - kind of like a cheesecake, we all fought over the last bite.\n\nAll this food plus 6 beers...grand total? $90 pre-tip. That's one hell of a bargain for four people!\n\nA couple of useful tidbits: we arrived around 6:45pm on a Sat night and were quoted an hour/hour and fifteen minute wait but the hostess took our phone number and pointed us in the direction of a neighborhood bar, saying she'd call us when our table was ready. She did and we came back only to be told that we weren't next up but actually third up which led to an awkward 20 minute wait in the hallway outside the bathrooms.  \n\nAlso, we were seated at the table immediately in front of the door and were hit with a 40mph breeze whenever people came into the restaurant. Limon might want to invest in a heavy curtain to block the wind from the diners.\n\nNo matter - the food, prices and outstanding service more than outweigh these small issues.

Not to say they were pretentious, but just a spot judgement, they looked like a white callared group of people ready for a good meal. \n\nThe food? Amazing...simply amazing. We ordered 2 whole chickens. Each whole chicken comes w/ two large sides (Whole chicken: $15.95, 1/2 chicken: $9:50, 1/4 chicken: $7.25). The best deal is a whole checken shared amung 2-4 people. If you get the 1/2 chicken or 1/4 chicken, you only get two small sides. The very helpful staff recomended this and it saved us money...much props for that. Chicken was amzingly seasoned w/ flavor running thoughout. Absolutely moist and tender (Why can't I make chicken like this?) Ceviche was fresh and delicious. Sides were a good accompanyment to the chicken. Plateing was excellent and everything looked amaging. The sangria was the best I have ever had. Not too tart (I don't like red wine) and not too sweet. It had a cool refreshing finish. A pitcher for $25 is a good deal and it can serve 6 people. \n\nMy cullinary visit to Peru was a huge success. So much that I chose Limon as the spot of my dept.

I'd had the day off and was driving from Oakland to the City, through the financial district. I was surprised at how many buildings had their lobbies decorated. Trees with lights, enormous presents, reindeer with red noses, and all sorts of holiday cheer. Even with the economy the way it is, the Christmas spirit is slowly creeping. And, it's a joy that's completely welcome. We all need it.\n\nBeyond the decorations, the other great thing about the holidays is reconnecting with friends that you haven't seen in awhile. Tonight we did that at Limon Rotisserie. We've been talking about making excuse to go over in that direction. And, tonight we had a perfect one. We were in the neighborhood.\n\nNow all we knew was that it was a place for great chicken and the prices were extremely reasonable. And, it's by the same people that had the Limon on Mission -- can anyone say if it's open again? I want to try it!\n\nWe were expecting a Peruvian version of Truly Mediterranean. We were very pleasantly surprised. This food might be inexpensive, and the area might be sketch-- but this is going to become destination. If we had a first date again, I would consider this place. I wouldn't hesitate a minute of going there with friends. The food is extremely reasonable, but it's also an extremely pleasant atmosphere. Date-worthy, friend-worthy. I wouldn't recommend it for a crowd of people, but there are very few places I feel should ever be burdened with a horde of people.\n\nThe four of us sat near the door. Unfortunately, I was facing the window because the restaurant really is pleasant. Later, when the lights dimmed, you could see the fire in the kitchen light up the dinning room. The big mirror hung on the wall spread the orange glow. The accents of green were very pleasant. \n\nEven the bathroom was nice, though the bottom lock didn't work. Having a solo bathroom with both a urinal and a toilet really is a smart idea. Keeps it much cleaner. Basket of paper towels needs to go. Can get messy. All restaurants should get rid of this.\n\nFor a little more than $100, we split the following:\n- Pitcher of sangria (looked delicious)\n- A mango lemonade for me\n- Ceviche mixto with halibut, calamari, and tiger shrimp bathed in lime juice\n- Seco de Costilla: beef short ribs that looked like they would fall off the bone (can't wait until I have beef again)\n- Lomito salteado: perfectly done beef with onions, tomatoes, and french fries (again, I'll have beef again soon!)\n- Chicharron de Pollo: a fried chicken... so good\n- A whole rotisserie chicken (Pollo a la Brasa) that was so tasty with a hot spicy mustard that made it incredible\n- 2 sides: yucca fries and something called tacu-tacu (balls of beans and rice)\n- 2 desserts: Bandido (bread pudding) and Tarta de Frambuesas (a raspberry torte)\n- 2 coffees\n\nThere were so many other items on the menu that we want to go back and try. That's the best. \n\nSo if you're looking some great food at an incredibly reasonable price in a beautiful space, run to Limon Rotisserie. There are certain the be crowds soon.", "author": "Dave B."}

However, when I got there, there was only one vegetarian option besides salad, veggie empanadas.  Not having vegetarian options is one thing but it should be represented correctly on their website. When I asked the waiter about this he scoffed and said that the website is just very out of date, without any sort of apology for the inconvenience. Then when I ordered fish (which I eat very rarely and only when there is no veggie option), he smirked and said that obviously I didn't need veggie food because i'm eating fish.

We were seated at a small table near the window.\n\nWe had a half rotisserie chicken with Tacu-Tacu and some kind of corn.  The chicken was the best part of the meal - very juicy, perfectly-seasoned skin, and a great sauce on the side.  We also had the ceviche, which the fiance liked a lot, but I felt the pieces were a little too large and the fish was kind of tough.

Maybe as a nice reduction and drizzled on a cobbler or something, but certainly not as a drink with dinner.  \n\nAnyway, other than the food and drink (which have the potential to be incredible!) the atmosphere was similar to a fancy school cafeteria...really loud and kind of obnoxious.

It was my moms birthday and I wanted to treat her out. I brought my mom, sister and brother. My siblings got lomo soltado and my mom got the special of the day. We all got something to drink. I did the math and I figured I'd be spending a good $80 which was fine. Even $100 would've been fine, but it was $119.27. I was kinda shocked, but still paid the bill, didn't make a fuzz especially in front of my mom and tipped $20. I feel like a fool now looking over the receipt and seeing that they already charged me a tip in the bill as a service and some other unclear service which was an extra $12. Maybe when I make more money than I know what to do with I'll come back, but I was disappointed with my experience there. Like I said most of the food was good even if the presentation wasn't quite there and a lot of it was a little too salty. But there were also this group of 6 girls who were obnoxiously loud and we had to ask the waiter if they could tell them to keep it down a bit. They didn't do anything.

In that dish, the pescado was better than the camaron. But the light lemon marinade plus the cancha and other \"super\" corn complimented each other well and really made the dish come together for me.\n\nThe carne was quite flavorful, along with the tacu tacu, which is a rice and bean mixture that has been deep-fried. I imagine it would be delicious with beer. I had sangria, so...it was a bit over the top.\n\nThe soup was very tasty. Just the right amount of flavor...again, if you're drinking beer. Otherwise, it might be on the salty side. I dipped my yuca fritas in it and my taste buds went CRAZY!\n\nThe pollo was beautifully marinated/seasoned. Unfortunately, it was outcompeted by both the seafood and its four legged friend.

The bar is tiny fitting 6-8 patrons but the sangria was AMAZING! \n\nOur waiter was impossible to get a hold of most of the time and when we asked simple questions about the menu he seemed annoyed, which was really ANNOYING! \n\nAs for the food I would only order the chicken every thing else is too pricey for what you get...but the chicken is quite the deal.", "author": "Ka C."}

It was flavorful, and cooked to perfection and served with some sauces that complimented it really well.  We also ordered the fried chicken and the \"Lomito Saltado\".  We really didn't like the Lomito Saltado.  I've had lomo saltado at a number of different Peruvian restaurants and I have to say I liked the one at Limon Rotisserie the least.  Other than the lomito saltado this place was great.  I'll definitely be coming back soon!", "author": "Reem A."}

They don't take reservations. The restaurant is small about a dozen little tables and a medium sized bar. They should really just take out the bar since they only carry beer and wine. Then they can expand with more tables. When seated we ordered a pitcher of sangria. Three words \"Ive had better.\" The fruit in the sangria are cut up in a fine dice and its hard to drink with cubes of orange rind coming at you. Also if you chew on one of them it will just ruin your taste buds making everything bitter. \n\nWe all ordered a plethora of dishes. I will say that the most enjoyable / memorable ones was the ceviche mixto, fried yucca, and beet salad. Not your traditional ceviche, this one had huge chunks of seafood and marinaded perfectly with yummy citrus. The fried yucca where not oily at all and very airy. The beet salad was sweet and creamy with lots of veggies, I did not enjoy that it had hommony which was aldente. Not a good texture at all. It should of been cooked all the way through.\n\nMight try it again, but who knows.", "author": "David P."}

All around great place for any occasion!\n\nParking was a bit tough and made use late for the reservation, but staff was understanding and accommodated us the best they could.  We sat in the basement floor though upstairs definitely seemed more fun (and smells of delicious chicken).  Though downstairs, they checked on us often and were very good about making recommendations.\n\nThe flavors are more more fusion than Peruvian in my opinion, but that's just the way I like it! We ordered:\n\n--Pitcher of Sangria ($25) -- Huge, enough for 6-7 glasses. \n--Lomito Saltado ($9.75) -- Cubes of tender steak served with fries which are mixed right in so they soak up the tangy fusion sauce.  If I could cook, this would definitely be a great way to use leftover McD fries!!\n--Tartara de Tuna ($7.95) -- Tuna tartar. Ok quality.  Extremely peppery -- not my favorite and probably not the best dish on the menu.\n--Ceviche Mixto ($9.75) - Shrimp, fish, and calmari ceviche that is very tangy.  Portion is big and the seafood is not diced but kept in whole pieces, so give it a great texture to chew on. Served with looks like extra-large corn kernels.  Super fresh.\n--Chicharron de Pollo ($8.50) hot plate of boneless chicken that is well marinated and perfectly charred.  Better (and less messy) than the rotisserie chicken, if you ask me!\n--Pollo a la Brassa (Rotisserie Chicken) ($17.95 for whole) - Great rotisserrie chicken and the house special.  However, to me, roasted chicken is roasted chicken.  My tummy room is better spent on the other 20+ amazing dishes!  The chicken is served with 3 unique sauces though -- so that may set it apart from the your grocery store rotisserie.\n--Vegetales Salteados ($3.25) -- Side of red peers and whole green and yellow string beans.  Stirred fried in soy sauce.  Very Asian tasting -- but great compliment to the chicken.\n--Yuca Frita ($3) - About 10 large yucca fries fried to perfection.  Center stays moist and light sweeten, outside is crispy but not too greasy. \n\nWhole bill for 4 of us was $85 (wow, right?!)  including that sangria pitcher!  Will definitely be back again.  \n\nI see that they are applying for a liquor license -- so next time maybe they'll have even more tantalizing drinks to go w/ the great food :)", "author": "Kendra W."}

It is so good that its delectability surpasses the category of \"Peruvian\" or even \"Latin American\". We ordered a whole chicken (serves roughly four), lomitos saltados, ceviche con pescado y camaron, yucca fries, and vegetales, all of which was truly mouth-watering, and made it difficult to comply with classic fork-and-knife propriety (some of us thankfully accepted defeat, and ravenously digressed to cromagnum status).\n\nI believe both the restaurant and the customers its serves benefit from a menu on the small-ish side. This might allow for a sort of specialization, and the food is consistently delicious. It also boxes you into trying some dishes that you might have initially been reluctant to try. \n\nThe sangria is pure ambrosia, but VERY dangerous. I made the easy mistake of forgetting that the sangria IS alcoholic, and subsequently  suffered (enjoyed?) the consequences of overindulgence. A pitcher of this ambrosia will will provide a comfortable buzz for four. \n\nNow for the drawbacks, all of which I caution are purely circumstantial. \n\nThis restaurant is quite popular, and on a Saturday night we found ourselves waiting around 20 minutes outside in the cold for a table. However, our food was served with amazing rapidity once we ordered ( less than 4 minutes). \n\nThe new location is small and a little cramped, and by the end I sensed that the wait staff was gently rushing us a bit so our table could be used by other customers who were still pouring in at 10 o'clock and beyond. \n\nThe yucca fries are a must. \n\nThe number of times \"delicious\" or an adjective of \"delicious\" was used in this review: 10. \n\nThat is all.", "author": "Amanda B."}

We are jammed pack until 9 pm. It was obvious that he didn't want to seat us because there was plenty seating available. \nWe had to eat in a joint close to this location and after we finished lo and behold same seating was available. \nWe thought maybe this guy is a major jerk we'll try a different location. To avoid any further issues with the baby we reserved a table for four adults and one baby. With this in place you would think they would plan the seating accordingly so. Got there the lady seating was annoyed we had the baby.  Moved us from the initial table stating we would be in he way of other customers with the baby. She could not accommodate our request that the baby not be seated in front of the kitchen where waiters had hot plates coming in and out.

The fact that we were seated right next to an open flame in the kitchen on a 90 degree day without air conditioning didn't help either.  \n\nLet's go through each dish:  Fried yuca - OK.  Glorified french fries without the distinct crispness.  Mixed ceviche - definitely skipable.  Considering this was our only cold dish on a blazing hot afternoon, I would have expected it to be the best.  It wasn't.  The giant corn thing had such a grainy, revolting texture that it was just the thing to make me push the plate away for good.  The lomito saltado I would skip as well.  It somewhat resembled an Asian stir fry with soy sauce and everything.  Way over-salted.  The raisins in the empanadas were also a little strange to me.  The stuffing in general was a little too sweet for my taste.  The one saving grace was the chicharron de pollo, that was actually quite delicious.  \n\nI guess I had bought into the hype and had expected something phenomenal.  Don't get me wrong - I stilled enjoyed my light lunch at Limon.  I'll probably be back for the roast chicken and the yummy mojitos.

The meat is filled with the flavors of all sorts of spices, which is very unique. It was a little too salty though.

We went all out and order several dishes, two desserts and a bottle of Argentinean Malbec.\n\nWhole Rotisserie Chicken, served with two sides and two delicious sauces. You really have to taste this chicken to appreciate how perfectly tender and seasoned it is. Our sides were the yuca fritas and grilled vegetables. The yuca fritas were awesome. You can go very wrong with too much batter or grease when it comes to fried food, but the balance was just right here. \n\nWe also ordered the El Pescado Ceviche (large pieces of fresh halibut), and the Lomo saltado, which is a beef dish with papa fritas and vegetables. Again the meat was prepared perfectly and the seasoning was dead on. Everything was incredibly flavorful and the wine was excellent. For dessert we had a berry tart and a sort of creme brulee meets flan with macaroon dessert. The only thing I would not recommend is the macaroon dessert, because the macaroons were delicious but the rest was a bit flat and the texture of the creamy part of the dessert was too dense and did not mix well with the thick layer of raw sugar it was topped with.

I went with four other people and ordered two pitchers of sangria, mixed seafood ceviche, a whole chicken, lomito saltado, side of yucca fries, sweet potato fries, and vegetables.  Oooh weee, were we happy.  I had a HUGE lunch at Kokkari earlier in the day so I wasn't hungry at all but once I had a couple of bites of their food, I couldn't stop.  Their dipping sauce was sooo tasty as well.  \n\nOne of my friends and I arrived later than everyone else because we went to the original spot without knowing they moved.  It took us a while to find parking, surprisingly as the restaurant is sorta out there.  The neighborhood isn't the best but I liked the venue.  We were seated downstairs in the loungy area.  I thought it was a cool, hip set up; it would be a great place to have a group dinner.  \n\nBy the time we arrived, my friends ordered the sweet potato fries and some sangria.  I love sweet potato fries but you can't go wrong though I have to say the dipping sauce was what made it.  I thought the sangria was really good as well, not too sweet.\n\nThe ceviche and lomito saltado came out first.  I thought the ceviche was delicious and flavorful...very refreshing and not too fishy.  I love fishy sushi but fishy ceviche? not so much.  With that said, they did a good job!  As for the lomito saltado, I wasn't too impressed.  I hate soggy bread so I should know I won't like soggy fries.  I should have known what I was getting myself into, but I've tried it at other places and I don't remember the fries being soggy.\n\nThen the famous chicken came out with the side of yucca fries and veggies.  The chicken was SOOO yummy!  It was moist but not too oily and each bite was so flavorful.  I don't know how they got the meat so flavorful to the bone.  The skin was pretty salty but you aren't supposed to eat that much skin anyway, and when you do, I like to eat it with the white meat.  I really enjoyed the yucca fries as well...more so than the sweet potato fries.  It was crispy but soft in the inside and just slightly sweet.  Again, with the dipping sauce, yummo!  The veggies were ok.  They tasted like veggies you could get at an Asian restaurant though!\n\nWe were really surprised at how reasonable in price the restaurant is...the bill came out to be $66!!!

Here's my summation of Limon Rotisserie:  it's a restaurant with a cool, almost clubbish atmosphere (at least the downstairs is) and with good food BUT RUDE SERVICE.\n\nObviously, given my beef with their service, let's start there.  My party was seated downstairs at a really long but comfortable table.  I move from one end of the table to the other end to chat with people.  In the process, I go over to an empty table to get an extra place setting for myself.  I immediately get CHASTISED by the waiter who warns me not to take place settings from the other tables.  It is a very uncomfortable conversation in front of my friends that he tells me that the place settings are reserved for the other table and that I should ASK them to get me place settings if I need.  If this isn't bad enough, the waiter comes back again to reiterate WHY it's important for me to not take other place settings and that his staff gets in trouble if place settings aren't completed at empty tables. In addition, the rest of the meal service was no better as food was just tossed on the table and there was no attention paid to refilling water or checking on our needs.  \n\nLuckily for them, their food was much better than the service.  We ordered rotisserie chicken, empanadas, ceviche, skirt steak, and a few other tapas.  The star was the chicken as the skin was perfectly roasted, crisp skinned, hot on the inside, and seasoned just right.  There were also some wonderful sauces on the side that accentuated the herbs used to marinate the chicken.  The chicken empanadas were solid, with nicely flavored fillings and a nice crispy fried exterior.  The ceviche was also solid (they had tuna and calamari).  Refreshing with a nice balance of oil and pickled flavor.  The rest of the food was decent but not memorable.  The sangrias were also along the same lines:  solid but not spectucular.  (For really good sangrias, try Cafe Mystique in the Castro...they use cinnamon sticks to give their sangrias additional body that I haven't experienced elsewhere.)  \n\nFinally, the ambiance.  My party sat downstairs where it felt like a mix between a club and a diner.  It was quite comfortable and PERFECT for a large party.  It's easy to move around and chat with different people.  The seats/booths are quite comfy and loungy.  Great vibe that was marred by poor service.\n\nOverall, Limon Rotisserie is a decent place to try although it won't blow you away.

We pretty much only ate half of it. Also comes with 2 very yummy dipping sauces. the Yuca Frita was good also, but the portion was small. The tacu-tacu is this rice dish. It was 3 rice balls which I thought were decent but could have used more flavor. The sangria was tastey as well.

Caveat to this review is we were a group of 10 for a birthday party, might be a different experience in a smaller party. \n\nService: I honestly almost never notice service, and I usually find it odd when others comment on it. But at Limon I unfortunately noticed it. Our waitress was just never there. We were sitting for a long time before they came to take our drink orders. In addition to drinks, we asked for waters. They brought out about 3 waters, then seemed to have forgotten about the rest. We had to re-ask for the other 7, and then they never refilled the empty water glasses. The whole dinner felt really slow-- slow to show up at all, slow to ask for our dinner order, slow to check on if we wanted dessert or the check. Never asked about drink refills or how the food was. Just generally not around. Maybe they figured with a large group gratuity is included in the bill, so no need to bother doing anything? \n\nAtmosphere: this is most important to me in a restaurant. The upstairs section is really warm and has a nice vibe, but they seated us downstairs which is this big room that feels like a cheap nightclub. It felt like we were in a cellar somewhere, no atmosphere at all. This was probably because we were in a big group, atmosphere is much better upstairs. \n\nFood: the food was good.

The roasted chicken is by far the most value for your buck. I love dipping the chicken in the yellow sauce which comes with it. \n-Lomito Saltado: this is hands down my favorite dish at this place. traditional peruvian dish with strips of sirloin, tomatoes, onions, and fries to soak up all the juices. \n-Tuna tartar: The portion is small but I always come back to this dish. Great spices. \n-Ceviche: Very fresh and yummy. Must try at least once. \n-Braised short ribs: I found this dish to be portioned small as well, but it is served tapas style, so that's forgivable. One of my friends really liked this one over the Lomito. \nI have yet to try the hanger steak or the soup, but those are definitely on my list for next time!\n\nI love that you can get a balanced meal with drinks for $20-30 depending on your appetite.

I moved into SF city just a couple months ago, and that chance finally arrived after the craze of moving and setting in, paired with a week off work for the holidays!\n\nNow, the actual review :)\n\nWe tried to call in to make a reservation on Tuesday night for two, but the phone was busy during our 4 tries from 5:30-7pm. We decided to stop by and try our luck with standard drop-in, and luckily there was plenty of street parking and a seat open for two right next to the window! Good timing or perhaps because of the rain?... I'll find out next time when I take my sister.\n\nThe environment is quite warm with the restaurant decoration and the rotiserrie and kitchen visible in the back of the restaurant. Cozy atmosphere and friendly greeters. Lookin' good at first glance!\n\nThe food menu (http://www.limonrotisserie.com/1/food.html) fits on one side, but there is still plenty of variety to satisfy most all foodies and occasional frequenters alike. It was both our first times, and although we're both considered petite gals, we wanted to taste as many things as possible before the end of the night. Leftovers would be a-okay!\n\nHaving skimmed a couple dozen reviews for this place on Yelp!, we made sure to try:\n\nDrinks:\nCuzquena - my beer, light but flavorful, i'll put this up with my preference for Belgium beers... will be back for you\nCristal - friend got this - she liked it, and it tasted good, just a bit hop-pier than the Cuzquena\nChicha Morada - waiter was nice enough to let us sample this - will definitely get this next time I'm in and want a tasty non-alcoholic :)\n\nFood:\nLomito Saltado - hands down both our favorite dish; juicy tender sirloin steak, complemented by onions and fry bedding with their tomato soy sauce dressing... yum! Definitely will order this every time I'm back!\nRotisserie Chicken (half) - this was good; cooked right and with plenty of flavoring. may be a bit salty for those who normally eat light foods, but worth trying nonetheless!\nCarne a la Parilla - the hangar steak dish was quite good.. if I remember it correctly, it almost seemed like it was braised?? nice to see how the steaks are prepared differently here.\n+ tacu-tacu and yucca fries as our side choices, plus an extra side of Yucca fries :) - thanks fellow yelpers, the yucca fries were definitely tasty, and we ate ALL of them while we were there!\n++ We had already ordered past our limit for 2 girls, but I asked our server if we could try a few of the sweet potato fries. He was nice enough to oblige, and we actually received an entire order on the house! These were shoe-string cut style - they were tasty, similar to the belgium style of sweet-potato fries. Just wanted to highlight a big thanks to our mystery server... will figure out his name next time I go! :)\n\nWe ended the night after sitting there chatting and eating the food over the course of 2+ hours, with an order of the profiteroles for dessert. These were good, a few notches up from your typical cream puffs. They boxed up our leftovers for us, and I let my friend bring it back to share with her mom later. Still wishing I had kept a little for myself to eat!!\n\nIf only I had the appetite of a 6'2\" athete... but alas! Next time I'll be back to try their: Ceviches, Empanadas, and the chocolate dessert. And of course, there will be Lomito Saltado and yucca fries to boot!\n\nExtra tips for top-notch service, without anyone rushing us through, and the lady at the door even helped us to locate our umbrella amongst the dozens of navy blue/black umbrellas stored at the entrance. I'll be smarter next time, and bring a bright umbrella like my friend dead for a quick grab n' go.\n\nTHANK YOU Limon Rotiserrie for making my Tuesday night over holiday break an amazing one!! I hope I justly showed some of my appreciation for you with this review.

You need to have a minimum of 10 people though.  It's shared family style and it included tuna tartare, ceviche, mixed salad, lomito, chicharron de pollo (my favorite!) and roasted chicken.  There were also 3 different types of dipping sauces.  The price didn't include drinks, taxes, or gratuity.  So in the end it was more like $40 a person.

We entered and even though the hostess wasn't the friendliest, we were seated immediately and our server made up for it.  She was sweet and prompt, but she could have made some recommendations, this having been our first time eating strictly Peruvian food.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of sangria ($5 for a glass, $25 for a pitcher) which was delicious even though I'm not a fan of sweet beverages.  It was also a tad too tart for my tastes, but it went well with the rest of the meal, which included the \"Ceviche Mixto\" ($9.25).  This ceviche consisted of halibut, calamari, two tiger shrimp, and it was all marinated in lime juice, rocoto (a type of spicy pepper), garlic, and served with choclo-on-the cob - Peruvian corn which looks like yellow corn but really oversized and with a mushier texture.  It also had camote (sweet potato), and cancha (little crunchy kernals similar to popcorn, but bigger and with lots of flavor as they were toasted).  Sooo delicious was this ceviche!  Packed with lots of unique ingredients and intense flavor, I enjoyed the ceviche immensely.\n\nWe decided to order a hot small plate for some variety, and ended up on choosing the \"Lomito Saltado\" ($9.25), or top sirloin strips, onions and tomato stir fried in soy sauce, with fries mixed in there.  The fries do not come on the side as I had thought, and are more like regular potatoes in texture as they were doused in the sauce. The dish was good, but not my favorite.  \n\nWe also had a tasty little side salad in an attempt to be healthy.  The total tab plus tax and tip came out to just under $40 for all the above mentioned food, which is a pretty good deal.  Just keep in mind that this is a tapas place, so don't come looking for hearty fare.\n\nI would definitely recommend Limon, but my tip would be to come on a less busy night if you don't want to wait as previous reviews have advised.  I cannot wait to try the rotisserie chicken!!", "author": "Kira K."}

The ceviche is definitely a bit raw, but as I have learned to like sushi, it really is amazing this way. Anticuchos (heart steak) is a must even if it sounds gross. The meat has a somewhat tougher/chewy texture, but the flavor is very rich. They do it well here. My favorite part I'd have to say are the two sauces, specifically the huancaina sauce (The yellow one) the Cilantro one is really good too. Whats even better is both mixed! Yucca Frita is really well done here. I definitely recommend this place to anyone, and for bigger parties it will definitely impress.

The prices are more than reasonable and for that, I would go here again.\n\nThe service on the other hand, was kinda sketchy.  Our reservations were at 845 and we didn't get seated until 945.  I could let that go, it was a Friday night and we had a pretty big group.  Next we were told that we could ONLY order off the pre-fixe menu.  Their reason-our group was big and it would be confusing to hand out all the food to everyone.  He didn't want all the orders getting mixed up.  WTH?  They also said that if we ordered individually it would take much longer.  After talking to the Manager, we were able to order off the regular menu because everyone wanted different things and some items on the pre-fixe didn't appeal to us.  Less than 10 minutes later our food arrived.  We get the feeling they were trying to talk us into the pre-fixe in order to jack up our bill.  I also ordered a dish and changed my mind about it.  I told the server 2 seconds after I ordered it I didn't want it and it still showed up.  Its not like he left the table, placed the order and came back to me.  He stood right there while taking my order and me canceling it.  Then several more dishes we DID NOT order started appearing.  4 extra dishes to be exact.  We told our waiter we didn't order these.  He said, 'well, since its already been cooked, you can just have it...on the house.\"  Of course these items ended up on our bill. I get the feeling they thought because we were a big group, we wouldn't notice if extra items ended up on our bill. Not Cool!

For the food that I got it was a huge bargain. Seriously.\n\nWhat's to love:\n* The chicken is amazing. I don't get excited about chicken very often. But this chicken is succulent, well seasoned and really tasty. They let me pick white or dark meat for the quarter chicken I ordered and the dark meat was fantastic (given how well they did dark meat, I'm betting their white meat would also be fantastic -- even if it is white meat).\n* The sides were great. The rice was excellent. I mean, it was just basic rice (jasmine according to the waiter) but damn, it tasted soooo good with the various sauces they bring out and the chicken fat. Mmmm\n* The grilled vegetables were tasty. I think this is a better option to the salad.\n* The little dish of dipping sauces were great. Spicy.\n* Decor was nice.

However, my party of 9 really lucked out and got some seating in the downstairs lounge. However, the table was small for our heffer status and we had to squeeze more lounge ottomans around the table. The vibe is really chill downstairs with neon pink lighting and a dim atmosphere.\n\nOnly 2 waiters/busers were manning the lounge floor, so throughout the night it was difficult getting service and we had to make several reminders about our food or cancelling orders after waiting awhile for it. However, it's the lounge so it was completely expected and we didn't let it ruin our evening. \n\nSangria was good. So good we got 2 pitchers worth. The boys go some Peruvian Brews and then we also ordered some non alcoholic drink that we were sold on because it had corn infusion in it. \n\nWe got tons of tapas and a whole rotisserie chicken that came. Everything we order was really good. But the dishes that definitely stood out was the Lomo Saltado. Really tender beef and with french fries. A definite win. The chicken was really good, well seasoned and tender... we got Fried Yucca which was a hit, and some beans and rice that were balled up. \n\nThe desserts were pretty good, but it's nothing spectacular...

Flavorful and fresh, leaning to the Asian side on seasoning, this great starter was only $7.95!\n\nThe Ceviche Mixto was simply good Ceviche, nothing to write home about.\n\nNext we had the saut\u00e9ed shrimp (tasted like something from a really good Chinese restaurant), a quarter chicken, and a few sides. \n\nThe chicken was certainly good, and with the smell of it wafting through the restaurant you'd be hard pressed not to order it.

First off, we were early for our reservation so they asked if we wouldn't mind sitting in the basement (!), but after seeing how crowded the street level dining room was and the fact that it only looks onto the no-so-scenic Mission at night we tentatively said yes.  This was definitely the better choice.  Street level dining is VERY cramped and unless you just want to be seen because you've just trimmed your beard and donned your newest winter chunky cowl neck scarf in nautical navy blue and don't mind people walking by, around and bumping into you while you try and navigate a food-laden fork near your face then this is your spot.  There is much more room in the basement than street level and it looks like there is Karaoke and dancing as it is nicely lit, not as overwhelmingly noisy (because Karaoke wasn't going on!) and has dedicated waitstaff working it.\n\nOnto the food - What a find!  We started with the pollo empanadas, Chicharron de Pollo and Aguadito de Pollo (I'm sensing a chicken theme here...).  While the Chicharron was good it paled in taste to the flavors that were in the empanads and the soup.\n\nWe were just about satisfied, but decided to push our waistlines and order a half chicken with Tacu-Tacu and the sweet potato fries sides.  Wow.  The chicken was cooked to perfection with good seasoning that was made even better by the three sauces that come with it, but the real surprise here were the side dishes - these had to be the absolute best S.P. fries I've ever had and the Tacu-Tacu will blindside you by over-delivering on what its bland description (fried beans and rice) will make you think it tastes like.\n\nThe service was excellent and we were well taken care of even as the evening progressed and it got steadily more busy.  All this and a couple drinks for a very reasonable cost which allowed me to be generous in tipping for a very attentive waitstaff.\n\nWe finished with the profiteroles for dessert and while these were very well done pastries I'm still left wondering about the chocolate bandido the table next to us ordered.  But, I'm sure to find out as I know we'll be back!", "author": "Sean T."}

I could pass on the crispy chicken, but you probably can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  To fill up, add a rotisserie chicken (half a chicken was good enough for us 5 girls).\n\nThe atmospheres upstairs and downstairs were quite different-- upstairs is more warmly-lit and quaint (good for a date), downstairs looks sort of like a shabby lounge/club (better for groups).  Service was on the slow side.\n\nWe weren't full from our first round of food, so we added 3 more hot plates/sides, 1 dessert, and a second pitcher of sangria.

The lomo saltado was tasty and so was the shrimp dish in particular. The ceviche was good, but having eaten a great deal of it in Peru I am admittedly biased and felt it could have been better. It lacked roccoto, but it did have the accompaniment of sweet potato, maize, and the little roasted maize kernels which totally made me nostalgic.\n\nThe yucca frita was really good, and I loved the sauces that came with it.

The upstairs was a 20-min wait, so we opted for the downstairs lounge, which was nice for being a basement.  The vibe was good but the lighting needs to be less harsh.  Turn down the spots and use a color other than green - people don't look good in a greenish hue.  \n\nThe food is centered on small plates - whatever happened to the term \"tapas\"? - and all were quite tasty.  We were stuffed when we left, without having dessert, so small plates does not equal small appetite.  The sangria was spicy and full of fruit - perfect!  I liked it better than my own homemade version.  The only dish that was just \"OK\" were the french fries - could have had similar version at Whiz down the street.  The yucca fries, on the other hand, were delicious.  They should offer some dipping sauces for them, however.\n\nThe service, on the other hand, needs help - at least in the lounge.  We waited a long time for our server to come over and then I think they had to go make the sangria from scratch - well, it seemed that long, at least.  And then the food we received was for the table to our right, and then our food was delivered to the table to our left - I guess she can't count very well.\n\nGet the service up to snuff, then this is a great spot for casual and tasty dining out.

We ordered all the desserts, and the banana one (I can't remember exactly what it was called), was pure heaven in my mouth.

However, the yellow and green sauce for the chicken really make the big difference.  A roast chicken is a roast chicken, but these sauces make it something unique.  Rice was really boring, not sure what I was expecting but it was a decision I later regretted and wished I had chosen something more exciting.\n\nI was actually VERY impressed with those bomb ass yucca fries! One thing about yucca is that its best consumed very hot and wow - even though I was alone I felt myself making audible yummy noises.  I'd consider swinging by to order a side to go for a quick snack - saying a lot.\n\nI also had shrimp and halibut ceviche... This was pretty good and satisfied my craving for ceviche, but not as good as the ceviches I remember from the original location.  \n\nGood eats at a very fair price.

My husband and I have been to both Limon restaurants many times, and we have brought many friends there over the years to introduce them to Peruvian food.  My husband is Peruvian; we go to Peru every year,  we really know Peruvian food, and we and have been to most of the Peruvian restaurants in the Bay Area.  Limon on Van Ness has been one of our favorites for a long time, but I will never go back there after last night's experience.  We made a reservation for 8:30, and showed up just before 8:30.  You make a reservation for a specific time, and you expect to be seated pretty close to that time.  I have had to wait maybe up to ten minutes for a restaurant reservation, but never more than that.  At 8:30 they were still waiting to seat all of the people who had made reservations for 7:45, and there was a large crowd outside.  It was clear that even making a reservation, people were still waiting to eat for 45 minutes to an hour after their reservation.  Either they are incredibly clueless about how to manage reservations, or maybe they do this intentionally so there is always a crowd outside and it makes the restaurant look really hot.  We were very hungry and really pissed that we would have to wait so long, and that reservations really didn't mean a damn thing.  And the assistant manager to whom we spoke just shrugged her shoulders.  If you want people to keep coming back to your restaurant, then make dining there a good experience.  The food is pretty good there, but after the experience last night we will never return.  We'll bring our friends to other Peruvian restaurants in the Bay Area who honor their reservations to try this great cuisine.", "author": "Alice P."}

A few friends came up from back home in socal so it was a given that we hit up SF for some fine dining.  My friend mentioned that she wanted to try this place and, as I was looking up places to eat on Yelp, found the reviews for this place quite appealing.  Thus, my expectations of this place was pretty high.  \n\nI made dinner reservations for 9:00 pm and arrived promptly at around 8:50, checked in with the friendly hostess and she said to give them a few minutes in order to get us situated.  \"Sure thing. No problem. I'll just be waiting outside.\"  As i was smoking a cigarette outside with my party of 6, there were quite some entertaining series of events that led to dinner which do not need to be further discussed.  These \"events\" would never have happened if we didn't have to wait outside for such a long period of time.  We weren't seated until around 9:45.  What the hell is the point of making a reservation if they are going to make us wait an hour anyway?! At that point, I was super cranky because I was fucking STARVING and my fuse was burning every second they made me wait to get a table.  Can you imagine being tortured by the delicious aroma of the roasting chicken when you haven't had a bite to eat since lunch?  I will admit that I'm not the most patient person in the world but, in all honesty, I believe I'm entitled to bitch about the wait especially since I made prior reservations and haven't eaten anything since noon, no? \n\nAnyway, we finally get seated and I'm browsing through their menu and everything in their menu sounded amazing.  I opted for the house specialty which is their rotisserie chicken and in my hunger infused stupor, ordered a whole chicken to myself which comes with two full sides which provoked some unnecessary comments from our waiter.. fucking asshole.. I was in no mood to take any jokes from nobody! I just wanted my goddamn whole chicken with a side of rice and salad.  ANDALE!  \n\nMy other friends ordered the mixed ceviche and the tuna tartare for starters.  Both were amazingly delicious but the ceviche with its ultra lemony tangy-ness hit the right spot for me.  I am a huge fan of tangy, citrus-ey foods and man, it does not get much better than raw fish and calamari doused in sour, tangy, flavorful goodness.  We also ordered a pitcher of their sangria and I must admit, that shiz was gooood...... It had a very light, sweet taste that went down like juice.  yummm.. Word of advice: order the pitcher if you have a decent sized party.  It's $25 and you get about 8 glasses worth which is a lot more economically sensible than paying $5 per glass.. you do the math.\n\nENTREE: WHOLE ROASTED CHICKEN served with sides of rice and salad.\nI must say, despite the long wait and the waiter's unnecessary comments, once I took a bite out of that well seasoned rotisserie chicken.  All was forgiven.  Well, more like forgotten.  x) The chicken was great and they give you a selection of sauces to dip your chicken with.  All 3 sauces were fantastic.  I am having a rather hard time describing the flavor of the sauces and trust, that's a good thing.  You have to go check it out for yourself.  NOM NOM NOM... The sauces were perfect for flavorfully lubricating the dry parts of chicken (i.e. breast meat).  The dressing on the salad was also very delicious. It was kind of like a sweet Asian version of Italian dressing. ??? something like that.  The rice, well what can i say about rice, being Korean i effing love it so I'll just leave it at that.  Despite having a plethora of food in front of me, I had to try some of the other foods they had so I took my friends' offers and took a bite out of each of their meals.  Their braised short ribs were amazingly flavorful and tender.  Their Loma Saltado was also very flavorful but the portion seemed rather lacking.  Lastly, my health conscious friend ordered this chicken tortilla soup.  I must say, it didn't look very appetizing but it was fantastic!  \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Their food tastes great, prices are relatively reasonable depending on what you order, and they have awesome sangrias.  Oh, and in case all you readers are curious,  I dusted my entire order of food: a whole chicken (8 pieces), sides of rice and salad, some tastings of other friends' meals, and 2 glasses of sangria... LIKE A BOSS.  Couldn't breaf afterwards though.. worth ittttt", "author": "Ray H."}

We were seated downstairs and we had a party of 3.  After we were seated not to long later a bus boy or waiter took a chair with our bags and jackets on it away from us for another table.  Of course, he asked before taking it.  The manager came over to check on us about 1/2 hour later to see if we're doing okay so I joked that one of our chairs was taken for another table.  The manager apologized to us and joked along with us.  By the time we ordered desserts there were 3 choices to chose from so we picked 2 of out of 3.  The manager came to take our order and said why not order all 3 and we said we can't eat them all.  He then said yes you guys can.  I then said if it's on the house.  You wouldn't guess indeed the 3rd one was on the house.  Wow... That totally made up for taken the chair away.  Big plus to the manager for keeping us happy.\n\nOn top of that, while we were leaving we had to wait for our ride then this crazy man came and said all these BS to us and said something discriminated so I said something back.  Boy I shouldn't because I triggered him with a response.  The crazy man once stopped a car in the middle of the street before.

The hostess told us that it looked like an hour wait.  After 10 minutes or so browsing on menu and checking what people were eating, she came to us saying if we didn't mind to sit at the lounge, she could seat us right away.  She took us downstair to show us the place and we loved it.  It has couches and coffee tables.  Very comfy.  It's true that it would be little hard to bend/cut the food on a big plate but it's all tapas style so it made it easier.  Waiters were very attentive and came back to check see everyone seated downstair.  They had to carry plates of food from upstair to downstair all night long.  Tough job but they maintained their manner through the night.\n\nFood - 4.5 stars\nMixed halibut&shrimp ceviche - Just the way I want it.  The chubby corn thing took us a while to figure out what it is.  The halibut is fresh.  The shrimp is even better.  \n\nLomito Saltado - This is kinda fusion style thing.  They use soy sauce in it. The beef is medium and it reminded me the HK western style steak on sizzling plate.  (Steak on sizzling plate, with frieds on the side, and soy sauce like mixture on top.)\n\nDeep fried chicken - Chicken is well marinated.  It's crispy but little dried (that's why 1/2 star off) but the lemon juice comes with it make it better.\n\nDeep fried rice&bean cake - Never imagine rice & bean can be prepared this way.  It comes with two sauces; one is yellowish and one is greenish.  Love both sauces and it almost goes well with everything on table.\n\n\nParking - 3 stars\nIt's little challege to find parking but after a round on the block, we found a nice spot a block away.  It's in a ok neighborhood in Mission so walking a block is not really a concern.  \n\nPrice - 4 stars\n3 tapas, 1 side, 2 non-alcoholic drinks - $40 something for 2 hungry people.

Since she was visiting me, I wanted to treat her to a nice dinner. I selected this one, which turned out to be a big mistake.\n \nWhen we got there, it was about 7 pm and the place was very busy. I put my name on the waiting list. After a long wait (about 40 min), finally they called my name. \n\nThe hostess asked me whether it would be okay to be seated in the downstairs. I had no idea what it would be seated in the downstairs but accepted her suggestion. \n\nShe took us to downstairs, which was pretty empty. There was only one family party (2-3 kids and a few grown ups). I wondered why the downstairs was so empty. \n\nA couple of minutes later, I had a headache. The air was damp and stank with chemical odors seemingly coming from the newly painted walls. We went back to the ground level to complain the issue. While we were going up, I saw another \"family\" group (2-3 kids and a few grown ups) was led to the downstairs. So, I assumed that the downstairs might be a place for big group parties. Then, again, why the hell had the hostess put us there? If she took us there before other waiting guests, I would've  understood. However, we had spent a long time waiting, and then when it came to our turn, she took us to the downstairs, differently from all other prior customers. \n \nFine. Whatever the reason was, I couldn't stand the stinky air. I told the hostess that we would like change our table to the one on the ground level. I told her that I wasn't aware of the air condition and wondered why she took us the downstairs differently from other prior customers. She said she was busy now. And she suddenly approached an ASIAN couple nearby us and asked whether they would be seated. She took them downstairs as if she was trying to prove that she hadn't treated us differently. I felt sorry for the couple. I wondered whether being \"ASIAN\" with an old lady (my mom) had contributed to this semi discrimination. \n\nAfter she came back from the downstairs, she continued seating other customers at the ground level tables.  \n\nWe waited a while again. When I saw a group of girls who had come in after we came back from the downstairs were called to be seated, I told the hostess that we had come earlier than them. However, she told us that since she had already seated us but we rejected the seats, now we needed to wait as the last one on the waiting list. Wtf?!\n\nI explained her that the air in the downstairs stank with chemical smells. As soon as I mentioned it, she flinched and almost shut me off by speaking over me. At that moment, I didn't know why she did so, but later, I figured that she might not want other customers to know about stinky air in the downstairs. \n\nShe scribbled down my name on the waiting list and said that our turn would be coming soon. However, when I checked the waiting list, there were several groups before us. As soon as she spotted me looking at the list, she shut the waiting list while her eyes locked at me. How rude! What would be a point of us waiting and eating in this hostile environment? We left the place. \n\nI was so disappointed about this place and felt sorry for my mom about having wasted our time at this ridiculously rude and hostile place.

My hubs and I like spicy food, so we usually order another sauce made with rocoto to accompany the yuccas as well.\n- Cebiche: it's very fresh.  Comparable with La Mar's cebiche.\n- Lomito saltado: meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We usually order a side of rice which is cooked with corn (peruvian corn is bigger and tastier).

Meat it's full of flavor! \n\nRead some reviews where people complain about the food being salty.

I had visiting family, and after trying to set up a reservation, I ended up on the waitlist as we did have a party of 5. We waited, and watched, hungrily as the flames and chickens turned on their spits, and delicious scents wafted out to the impatient crowd, lined up outside. We waited, and waited, and waited, nearly 2 hours on that list. Unfortunately, there was no seating in the upstairs dining room, which looked AMAZING! Rustic tables lined up family style, with people bent over the most delicious food, as our hunger increased exponentially. Once we finally got called up, we were led downstairs. DUN DUN DUUUUUUN! To the dungeon-esque lounge. It looked like the cheesiest night club I'd ever walked into, and not only that, they led us through the bathroom line to get there. We were sat down in a corner, in the dark, where we got little service. We finally ordered, family style, 3 chickens and some sweet potato fries and other sides. The food was amazingly good, as we were also ravenous at this point, so probably would have enjoyed eating the menus just the same. But that ambiance downstairs. TERRIBLE! I hope they renovate sometime soon, because if you find yourself down there, prepare for a bad DJ to be nearby.

Everything we had was quite good, including the sangria.  The menu pretty much reminded me of the original menu of Limon quite a few years back, just smaller servings.  The tuna tartare was great, as were the lomito beef, veggies and yuca.  I thought the sangria was good but pretty significantly overpriced ($25).  Since when should juice, fruit and wine cost more than a bottle of decent wine.  With no sangria, the dinner would've worked out to under $20 per person (including tip & tax).  With sangria, it was about $35 per person.", "author": "Kevin M."}

It's got incredible chicken (as the title implies) and everything else was well done, as well.  \n\nWe ordered the whole chicken and split that - it comes with two sides so we got the Tuca-Tuca (the peruvian equivalent of arancini) with rice and beans inside and pickled onions garnishing the top AND the vegetales (these are amazing and a perfect balance to the pollo).  \n\nWe also overordered and got the chicken soup because of another review that I had read.  The full chicken was more than enough for two people but the soup should not be missed.  Excellent and subtle.  Parsley, peas, chunks of chicken, great.   \n\nMy only slight reservation was that our waiter did not know where the chicken came from and when I asked him to ask the cooks he never got back to me.

I ain't no snobbyass foodie like some of the folks up on here but I do like to eat good food.\n\nI asked my homie Suaro if he had a good recommendation for a restaurant that he frequents and he came up with Limon. So I made reservations for 9p. We got there around 8:40p and waited 5 minutes before we were seated. The place was packed on a Wednesday night. \n\nSo since they got down with small plates, we decided to order 4 dishes to get a good variety of what they had to offer. We had the Half Chicken which was very tasty. And between the both of us, we kilt it. We also ordered Lomito Saltado, a popular dish in Peruvian cuisine which consists of top sirloin strips stir fried in onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce. My Peruvian student suggested I try the Jalea so I did. I was not dissapointed one bit. Who doesn't love seafood deep-fried to a crisp along with yucca and served with a creamy huacatay tartar sauce? The last small plate dish we devoured was the Chicharron de Pollo, a Limon favorite. Scrumptious pieces of crispy chicken marinated in soy sauce, garlic & aji amarillo, and served with salsa criolla. Hot damn! Every single dish was seasoned and flavored with enough goodness to satisfy my palate. You can bet I was a happy camper and I washed it all down with a caipirinha made to near perfection.\n\nMost excellent dining experience and I will be back!", "author": "Ivan F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-11", "description": "Invariably, when I'm asked by out-of-towners where to eat in SF, Limon Rotisserie tops my list.  I have yet to try Limon (Limon Rotisserie's more upscale sister restaurant) which has a slew of great reviews itself; frankly though, I find it would be hard to top Limon Rotisserie.  I wandered into here for the first time without really knowing what to expect, needless to say, I was blown away and have been back many times since.   \n\nIf you fail to make a reservation (I'd recommend doing so, although I've walked in twice without one with and only had a 20-30 minute wait - both occasions have been for a later dinner; I suspect during peak dining hours or with a larger group the wait might be longer) sidle up to the bar and start things off with a glass of their sangria (pretty standard, but good) or a mojito (their pineapple mojito is my favorite).  A lot of mojitos run a bit too sweet, but the acidity of the pineapple juice helps to balance it out nicely.      \n\nAs stated in many previous reviews, the standout dish here is their rotisserie chicken (its also been on the 7x7 list for 3 years running http://www.7x7.com/big-eat-2011-100-things-try-san-francisco-you-die) .  Succulent to the point of excess, with burnished crackly skin, my mouth begins to salivate just thinking of it.  The herb paste under the skin may be a tad bit too salty for the taste of some, but personally I think its just right.  Order a whole chicken even just for two people, its reasonably priced, and trust me, you'll want the leftovers.   The chicken comes with two sides, and three dipping sauces .  I find the yuca fries to be the standout side; I've been somewhat underwhelmed by the others I've tried so far: ensalada, tacu tacu (fried rice and beans, kind of bland), vegetales salteados (very green bean and onion heavy, neither of which are my favorite vegetables, so I may be a bit biased).  The ceviche here is alright, but not my favorite and remained relatively untouched when served with the chicken that unabashedly hogs the spotlight.  [Side note: check out La Mar Cebicheria Peruana for top-notch ceviche/cebiche (and cocktails too, but that's another review).]\n\nThe service here is good, friendly, and quick.  I prefer the tables upstairs, as the lower level seems a bit cobbled together, it looks like there's a dance floor/lounge area on weekends perhaps, really either is fine, just a little bizarre looking downstairs. \n\nBottom line: come here for the (whole) rotisserie chicken, a few drinks, and leave with a sated appetite and a ridiculous grin on your  face.

Well my other friends made the reservations so it was decided-San Francisco version of Peruvian cuisine it is!  I decided to just go with it...and we ordered the ceviche de pescado y camaron, \"Lomito\" Saltado,  Chicharron de Pollo, Carne y Pollo Empanadas, and their popular rotisserie chicken.  Everything came out quickly, and each dish had it's own distinct flavor.  The ceviche was fresh, refreshing and had the perfect acidity.  The sauces sent with the seasoned rotisserie chicken complimented it perfectly.  The chicken wasn't salty as mentioned in some of the reviews here. The empanadas which have always been my favorite as a child were :sigh: delicious and warm and filling and :sigh:...oh so good.  Despite food coming out quick we lingered in the relaxing atmosphere and enjoyed ourselves for a few hours chit chatting and catching up.  \n\nThe next day I went home and told my mom how great this place was so we could try it out.

This comes with a trio of dipping sauces which are simply delicious and complement the chicken perfectly. We also ordered the mixed ceviche with calamari, shrimp and fish which was seasoned perfectly to melt in your mouth. The chicken comes with two sides so we picked mixed veggies yum!! And yucca fries double yum!!!! it was the most perfect chicken I ever tasted, it had a crispy outer skin that left me licking my lips!

I was here with a couple of friends for my birthday dinner on Saturday (a whim decision because there was a 45 minute wait at Cha Cha Cha). While walking there from Cha Cha Cha wasn't the most pleasant experience (why do guys howl at girls? WHY?) we got there safely, and only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. \n\nLimon is small, but there is an upper and lower portion of the restaurant. I liked the bright colored walls (and how they matched the menu). We didn't think our waiter was a fan of our indecisiveness, and it made me feel a little guilty, so I took a star off. \n\nStarted out with a pitcher of sangria, half a rotisserie chicken (with papas fritas / rice),  ceviche de mixto, ensalada rusa, and seco de costillas (although we had asked for the Chicharron de Pollo). It was the perfect amount of food, but we did end up leaving completely stuffed. \n\nThe sangria was good, but I haven't had enough to really compare it to anywhere else. It went great with the meal, and had just enough of a fruity flavor to not completely deter me from the red wine. I loved the selection of dipping sauces they brought out with the chicken, they were all delicious and i wanted to layer it on everything (especially the white one, but i'm not sure what it was exactly). The chicken was moist, and good, although we all had trouble trying to gracefully hack it apart amongst ourselves. The french fries looked like the kind you'd get from mcdonald's, but they were really crispy, slightly salty. . but good nonetheless. Was kind of taken aback over the fact we got short rib over a crispy chicken, but it was definitely a hit. The ensalada rusa was different -- lots of beets, not much else to be found (this is probably the one thing I wouldn't order again). I tried ceviche for the first time, but only had the bits of calamari. I really liked the flavor, but my friends said they have had better. \n\nOverall, it was a great, satisfying birthday meal...and I definitely will be back.", "author": "Kary M."}

The lomo saltado is dreamy and it is the only time I will ever be okay with eating soggy french fries - somehow that makes it better!\nMy only complaint would be that they've run out of their red wine twice in the 3 times I've been there and also that they only have 1 selection of red wine available - tempranillo is great but a little one note.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

Someone the staff knew showed up and was seated at the bar, service got a little delayed because the social talk interfered with the speedy service. \nThe chicken, yuca and sweet potatoe fries were good, as always but when we asked for a lomo saltado to go we got a tiny box with enough lomo to feed a child and it came without any rice......next time I'm going to lindo peru or el toro loco for my lomo, You can expect tiny portions from La Mar but come on this is LImon!.", "author": "Mila R."}

It's right across the street from a liquor store and is the only eye pleasing thing in that neighborhood. There were cops arresting people just a few yards away when I went on a Tuesday night. The empty 32 oz beer can on the doorstep of Limon Rotisserie probably belonged to them.\n\nSERVICE: Service was good.

It's been over two years since I had been to the old Limon for my birthday, and the memories of the phenomenal ceviche were going to be hard to beat.  Every time I've been on a walk by, the lines are ridiculous- so I recommend getting here early, like 6-7 or so. There were maybe 6 other tables occupied- and it beats having to yell across the table. \n\nI love the light ambiance in here- especially the loungy wall seating. The service was really good- they were always trading out our old plates and silverware, an added detail that makes the whole experience that much better. \n\nWe started off with the pitcher of sangria (#2 to Cha Cha Cha's I think), the halibut ceviche and the tuna tartare. Both were outstanding, flavorful and fresh- soo good. Usually I don't ever order chicken- anywhere. It's like salmon- two entrees that I can do myself with relative ease. BUT this is a \"rotisserie\" so you have to, period. It delivered on all levels...aromatic, tender and crispy all at the same time. The carne was also an stand-out- melt in your mouth tender served with this fried ball of mixed rice and black beans which was interesting. It was a little on the cold side, but good enough to forgive it.  The vegetables are just well, seasoned mixed vegetables- nothing noteable. Now the Yucca fries- amazing. They are delicate, non-greasy and utter perfection. The best part is that they are super affordable on a budget- and I'm so lucky it's within walking distance- I'll be back for sure.", "author": "NaNa M."}

I ate at the other Limon quite often and always enjoyed it. Also, I only live two blocks away, so I was so excited to have such a quality restaurant in my neighborhood. \n\nOur experience began when I entered during a clearly busy time on a Sunday night. After we put our name on the wait list, we went up to the bar to order a glass of wine. That was when we were told that they were OUT OF RED WINE. Shortly after, we were seated. We asked our server, who was great, if we could go grab a bottle at the nearby liquor store since they were out, and she told us of course, of course. So I actually left during dinner to go out and get wine for us...\n\nWe had a lovely dinner. The food was amazing! Then the bill came and we were charged $10 for a corkage fee. While we didn't really care about the money, and even find $10 a reasonable charge for corkage, we still couldn't help but feel slighted. I asked our server who went and got a manager. Things got worse. He came over and aggressively and defensively asked what our problem was with the bill. We said we were uncomfortable with the fact that we were charged given the circumstances. He proved to be very unreasonable and actually rude in discussing it. I left offended, more so from his attitude and the way he attacked us. He was so unaccommodating and clearly cares much more about profits then he does about his guests having a positive experience. Maybe he got our ten dollars, but he won't get our patronage.", "author": "t c."}

We started with the Ceviche Mixto which was a great start--perfectly marinated halibut. shrimp and calamari. Better than any of the ceviches in the sampler at La Mar, or possibly any other civeche I've had.\n\nNext up was a sort-of stir-fry mix with steak, veggies and fries in a soy sauce. Yes, fries in a stir-fry--how great is that! Very tasty, I can assure you, and tender falvorful beef to boot!\n\nWe finished with the rotisserie chicken and a side of tacu tacu, which our server explained was beans and rice. Okay, I have to say that I wasn't too excited about the beans and rice but, okay, need some starch. Oh..my...garsh! The spices in the tacu tacu were incredibly tasty, possibly our favorite item of the night. And that's saying something given how incredibly the chicken was--which was wow! Tasty, tender, juicy, awesome.\n\nAnd the kicker is that each dish was less than $10. Incredible value. Tasty food. Friendly service. Succulent sangria. And easier parking than elsewhere in the Mission (at least when I went).", "author": "Brent E."}

My friend and i arrived for an early dinner for two, and there were plenty of open unreserved tables upstairs for 2 people, but instead the hostess without an explanation or warning starts walking us in the direction of the bathroom and then leads us to our confusion to the 2nd floor basement where there are more tables, but no people, and it smells like disinfectant and no ambience. After sitting there a few minutes feeling as if we had been dissed by the hostess, we decided that we would go back up and ask to be seated in the warm and pleasant main dining area. She made a face at us, and a very charming waiter swooped in to save the evening and lead us to a table, and promptly served us drinks and a menu. We watched to see if she took anyone else down there, but she did not, until a very large party of girls showed up...which was understandable sine there would not have been room for them upstairs.

The menu online had some veggie sides, so I wouldn't completely starve.\n\nIt was last minute idea, so we showed up at 9:45 p.m. Saturday with no reservation.  Luckily, there were 2 tables open so we had no problem getting seated.  The first thing my boyfriend noticed was that the place was filled with people of all different types, from all different neighborhoods.  Suburban families, couples on dates, hipsters, a group of well-dressed corporate types, all kinds.\n\nMy bf left it up to me to order whatever, as long as he could get the Lomo Saltado (made with beef, fried potatoes, and veggies). \n\nSo here's what I ordered for us:\n\n* 2 glasses of Sangria ... a little too sweet?  Maybe, but just the thing to set a festive mood!\n\n* Ensalada Rusa a classic Limean salad. Red beets, potatoes, carrots, green beans tossed in a mustard aioli dressing ... YUM!  ... comes out looking like a sushi roll.\n\n* Ensalada Mixta organic mixed greens, cucumbers, and radishes tossed in fresh lime vinaigrette. ... \"quite standard really\" (my Dr. Evil voice) ... but in this case, \"quite standard\" means \"quite tasty\" and the perfect foil to the other fried and salty foods on our table.\n\n* Yuca Frita (delicately fried to perfection, with 2 lovely, complex dipping sauces)\n\n* Vegetales Salteados (string beans and other vegetables in a salty broth ... my boyfriend loved this!  So did I.)\n\n* \"Lomito\" Saltado a traditional Peruvian dish of stir-fried top sirloin strips, onions, tomato,soy sauce and served with fries. (for my boyfriend ... everything else we shared)\n\n* Tacu Tacu (dense dumplings made with rice and beans ... must be some kind of \"comfort food\" that I'm not familiar with ... when I say comfort food, I mean \"really filling and BLAND\" ... however, the tacu tacu was good when spiced up with the dipping sauces that came with the yucca fries; I ate most of these because my boyfriend was too stuffed to eat them)\n\nAll in all ... the selection of tastes and flavors and variety of textures was a total hit!  We were FULL after consuming all of the above.  No room for dessert!   AND .... I was pleasantly surprised when I got the check ... only $42 (before tip) ... for 2 people, including drinks and fantastic food, in such a lovely ambiance!  I was so amazed by the value, I just had to rush to my computer this morning and write a review on yelp.\n\nI also wanted to give the 99% vegans/vegetarians out there the good news that you can indeed piece together an exquisite and satisfying meal in this very meat-centric place .... you won't be relegated to just eating french fries and ketchup in the corner.  You will totally have plenty to eat if you order everything veg on the menu and share with your date.\n\nBy the way, the service was wonderful.  Everything felt very orderly and efficient without being rushed ... we had time to enjoy and savor each dish, and shortly after another one would come out and delight our taste buds in a totally new way.\n\nAnd did I mention the VALUE!!!  Oh, I think I did.  Bravo, Limon Rotisserie!\n\n* When I say 99% vegan/vegetarian, that means I avoid all animal products; I shop and cook 100% vegan, and I normally eat at vegan-friendly restaurants.  But if I'm in a place like Limon Rotisserie (or at someone else's house, someone who doesn't understand about vegans), I do the best I can to make the meal as vegan as possible.  In these situations, I don't stress if there might be mayonnaise in the aioli or butter in the rice.  I bring this up because I believe the veg selections at Limon Rotisserie are okay for 99% vegans like me but not okay for a 100% vegan purist (someone who will not tolerate any animal products in their food, no matter what).   It will be great when all the restaurants catch on and start using vegenaise instead of mayonnaise in their aioli sauce and olive oil or non-hydrogenated veg margarine instead of butter.  ***Hey, Limon Rotisserie, if you would do that, your veg selections would become vegan.  That would rock! ***    I do see that things are changing .... Weird Fish, just a few blocks away from Limon Rotisserie, has vegan dipping sauces, vegan sour cream, etc.  Sun Rise Restaurant on 24th St has gotten the message with great vegan selections, too.", "author": "Rachel D."}

I noticed a new Limon on South Van Ness and had been meaning to try it.

No more scallop/foi gras appetizer, my favorite seafood stew no where in site - I was a little bummed.  \n\nOn the bright side, we ordered three plates, ceviche, flank steak, and some tempura seafood (fancy way of saying \"breaded and fried seafood\" haha) and it was all really tasty.\n\nOne disconcerting aspect: no bread to be found in the entire restaurant - which is odd.  I really like to dip my piece of bread in a tasty sauce.  I am really drawing a WTF on this one.  Why no bread?\n\nThe bill was a measly $50 for two with 4 beers - this was nice on the wallet - had it been the \"real\" Limon it would have been more like $100. \n\nService was so so...

For some reason, she mentioned peruvian food and I freaked out a little bit because I have been looking for a good peruvian restaurant here in SF. I've been to this place in LA called Mario's where I've had their dish Lomo Saltado.\n\nShe told me that she has been to Limon and i remember trying to yelp a Peruvian restaurant and seeing this pop up. I was pretty excited to go. We took the M line to Balboa and took Bart to 16 & Mission. Her boyfriend's place is on S. Van Ness, so its really close walking distance to Limon.\n\nWhen we got there, it was pretty busy. But we got a seat right away. It's a small restaurant that probably holds around 70 people. My friend bought a pitcher of Sangria, which was very delicious. We ordered \"lomito\" saltado, ceviche, half rotisserie chicken, and chife de camarones. The servings were really small but around $6-8. The lomito Saltado is a dish with beef, tomatoes, onions, and french fries. Really good (but not as good as the peruvian restaurant in LA)! The ceviche was sour and had shrimp, squid, and halibut. It was really fresh. The chife de camarones was very flavorful. Had a great salty taste. The half rotisserie chicken was probably the best part. It came with two sides. There were 6 sides you can choose from (i forgot all of them). We got papas fritas (french fries) and yuca fries. They also have a green bean side that you can order with it too. The chicken tasted like it had been marinated for days because the flavor was so embedded in the chicken! It was so delicious! I definitely recommend getting the chicken if you go there. You have the chose of getting a whole, half, or quarter.\n\nThey also have a dessert menu but we were too full to eat anymore. \n\nThe staff was very nice! They pulled out chairs and refilled the sangria everytime your glass was getting close to being empty. I kind of wish the servings were a little bigger for what you payed for but I would still go there.", "author": "Ricialg P."}

The food was excellent but the serve was lacking. \n\nWe had the following - \n-Ceviche Mixto halibut, calamari and tiger shrimp marinated with lime juice, rocoto, garlic and served with choclo-on-the-cob, camote and cancha. It was fresh and not \"over-cooked\" in the citrus. \n\n-Seco de Costillas braised beef short ribs with huacatay and cilantro, served with potatoes,carrots and English peas. The short ribs were cooked to perfection and partically fell apart when you cut into it. \n\n-And their name sake the Pollo a la Brasa. Chicken marinated the \"traditional way\" and slowly cooked in our rotisserie. It was moist and seasoned well. \n\nI would have given the restuarant a higher score if our server was more attentive to us. \n-I had asked him to close the door to the restaurant since we were sitting right infront of the door. This was a normal request since is was cold, windy, and rainy outside. His answer? We would need to wait for the waiting patrons to get seated. Umm, seriously? The restaurant was packed.\n-We only saw our server twice (on his own volition) maybe during the whole meal - when he took our order and dropped off our sangrias. Rest of the time we had to flag down the bus staff. \n-Then the kicker, we asked our server for water refills. He nodded. But after 10 minutes, we were wondering where he was. We flagged him down again and his reponse was \"We are out of water.\"  I responded that is strange since San Francisco has probably the best filtered water. His response? \"Stranger things have happened.\" What kind of answer is that? \n\nAs I mentioned before that I would have given this restaurant a higher rating if the service was better.

I liked it so much that I planned a birthday dinner there so that everyone could see how great it was.  We got the family style prix fixe menu and drinks.  Everything was going well until the bill came.  There were 19 people in our group and they charged us for 25 people.  That's $180 extra with tax & gratuity!!! They also charged $40 to cut a birthday cake that I brought in.  That's not a big deal, but it would have been great to know that before it showed up on the bill.  Lots of places don't charge anything to serve birthday cakes.  When I talked to the server about the extra 6 people we were being charged for he quickly said that \"someone\" in our group said that there were 25 of us.  He could't point out who it was, but either way since I was the one who made the reservation and was in charge, he should have asked me before making a $180 change to our order.  Instead of immediately knocking it off the bill, he said, \"ok, I talked with the manager and we can bring it down to 21!! Uh, that still didn't change the fact that there were only 19 of us!! They thought that only overcharging us by 2 was very generous. He was making us pay for a miscommunication on their part. It would only take a minimally trained server (or one with common sense) to count how many people were at the table. That's it!  It would have been so simple. After going back and forth for almost an hour and with our guests waiting, we were finally able to negotiate down to pay for the number of people that we had in our party.  In other words, I had to argue just to pay for what we ordered!!  I had to argue to not get charged for food that they sent out without confirming the number!   They didn't even offer to comp the cake cutting charge that they never told me would apply. It's a shame because as good as the food is, it can't make up for the horrible, horrible, experience we had just paying the bill.   Poor poor management. Poor poor problem resolution.

Our waitress was incredibly attentive, and made great recommendations for dishes and wine (and she didn't even recommend the most expensive wine on the list). \n\nthis place was the full package -- great food, great service, great value -- highly recommended. the mission is full of great restaurants; limon rotisserie is one of the best, and hands down the best value i've come across.", "author": "Lou M."}

We ordered just about every single one of the small plates on the menu and everything was full of flavor. The best part was the price! Tons of food, dessert and a pitcher of Sangria for 3 people was only $84. The restaurant is pretty small, so I wouldn't recommend for a large group.

The lovely thing about Limon Rotisserie is that it's easy to try a sampling of different items - they have a tapas style menu.  If you're not fond of small plates, the rotisserie chicken option is available in either whole, half, or quarter chickens, each coming with 2 sides.  It's a perfect meal by itself.\n\nWe, loving both tapas and rotisserie chicken, ordered a bit of both.  We started with the ceviche mixtos, then the carne a la parilla.  The ceviche is just as good as ceviche at the original Limon, and the carne a la parilla was insanely delicious.  For a moment, I considered ordering 2 more orders, it was that tasty.  But, recovering my wits, I held back and waited for the second meat item - a half rotisserie chicken (which comes with 3 different sauces on the side, including everyone's fave chimichurri sauce).  For the two sides, the chimichurri fries (yeah, we love it that much), and the vegetables.  The vegetables were seasoned and roasted green beans, yellow beans, and red onions.  The vegetables were good, flavored well and not overdone.  The chicken was tender and tasty, the breast piece was juicy and tender.  Did I mention it was tender?  \n\nThe pitcher of sangria we ordered was also as good as we remembered from the original Limon, and two of us had absolutely no problem polishing off a whole pitcher.  We were...uh...thirsty.  \n\nService was friendly, attentive, and definitely not overbearing.  In fact, we had declined dessert - we were stuffed with meat and sangria - but even so, they brought us an amazing dessert on the house - a housemade baked meringue with dulce de leche, toasted marshmallow, and amarena cherries.  It would've been shameful to let it go to waste - we killed that dessert in record time.  It was almost embarrassing...almost.  \n\nAll in all, a great addition to the Limon empire, and a cheaper alternative to the more pricey original recipe.  I mean, a half chicken with two sides for $8.75?  Cheaper...but no less tasty.\n\nWe'll be coming back - this just might be a restaurant that can break through and enter our regular rotation.  A super human feat considering how many great restaurants there are out here...\n\nNow, if only they offered sangria to go...", "author": "Catherine P."}

It was actually warmer outside. When I asked if we could be seated away from the windows, I was rudely told no, and that they were expecting a larger party there. Ok, fine, I was a server and I know having a 2 top on a 4 bugs - but whatever.  They had several tables open. \nMoving on to once we were seated, I noticed the couple sitting next to us were huddled together with both of their hoodies up  and scarfs on - they were obviously cold also. We sat for about 10 minutes before anyone came over with menus. No water was served or offered.\nI guess I was expecting a similar menu to Limon on Valencia street. Nothing really piqued my interest at first, so I started with the Yucca Frita. When finally offered a beverage, I was told the 3 alcoholic choices. It was very hard to understand our server, so I asked to see the printed list. I was informed that they didn't have a list, as they change their wines daily. \nOk fine. I asked to repeat the white wine choices and my server pointed to the bottle at the table next to ours - she said, \"It's like that one, medium bodied.\"  OK, so it is sweet, dry, fruity, earthy - what? She had no clue. \nWe ordered a glass of THAT ONE and one house sangria. Both were so freaking sweet - we couldn't stomach it. The Yucca arrived and we each tasted one. We both had inedible strings in ours that we had to spit out. By this point, I just had to leave. It was so cold, I couldn't enjoy anything else. So I asked for the check and the server said OK - not even asking if everything was OK. She stood around for a while, chatted with the 10 other staff members who weren't doing ANYTHING and finally I had to motion to her - the universal sign of CHECK PLEASE. Another 5 minutes goes by as she finishes up her story to her colleague, then the check comes. I more than likely won't ever go back there. I prefer the other location as it was much more inviting and warm. The owner of the place on Valencia always makes us feel welcome - but this place was so standoffish. yuck!", "author": "Erica C."}

Just seemed like the quality of ingredients was lacking.\n\nWe loved the unpretentiousness and honesty of the place but were not impressed by the fact that dishes and wine glasses were whisked away from our table before we were done eating them or drinking from them (a half finished bottle of wine was left on our table without refills but our glasses did manage to disappear). While this wasn't a deal breaker, it really wasn't great.\n\nThere is no wine list - just two reds and whites. \n\nThe place is totally affordable and coupled with the awesome chicken will account for the three stars it does get from me.", "author": "Kristin N."}

As delectable as it was we definitely did not need that much food, the chicken would have been enough.

Everything on the menu is bursting with incredible, exotic flavor!  AND you don't have to pay an arm and a leg.  This is easily the best deal in town.\n\nMy co-workers and I came here on a \"business meeting\", which is code for birthday celebration.  Who doesn't love a delicious but most importantly, free lunch?  I thought I made reservations for 17 people at Limon, the original.  Once we arrived to Valencia Street, we found Limon covered in news papers, floor to ceiling.  Oh shit.  What happened?  Did I speak to a phantom when I made the reservations?  I frantically scrolled through my phone, hoping that I would find Limon's phone number.  The same phone number for Limon became the phone number for Limon Rotisserie.  Blah.  I really wish the staff told me that Limon burned down and Limon Rotisserie temporarily took its place when I made the reservation in the first place.   \n\nWe finally made it to Limon Rotisserie where our long table was waiting for us.  We took up the entire wall under the gigantic LIMON sign.  It was so nice to have plentiful people to share plates as I was able to sample the entire delectable menu.  The stars of the show were:\n\n-Seco de Costillas- braised beef short ribs with huacatay and cilantro, served with potatoes, carrots and English peas.  OMG. I LOVE braised meats!  The tender short ribs envelop your mouth in a rich, velvety stew while hints of limon dance on your tongue.\n- Carne a la Parrilla- grilled hanger steak served over crispy tacu-tacu, salsa criolla and red wine-beef sauce.  This is the best sliced steak I have ever had in my life.  I usually turn my head to sliced steak but at Limon, it's always cooked at a perfect medium rare.  Don't have it any other way- it's perfect, trust me.\n- Ceviche Mixto halibut, calamari and tiger shrimp marinated with lime juice, rocoto, garlic and served with choclo-on-the-cob, camote and cancha.  I was adverse to untraditionally cooked seafood but Limon has made me a convert.  Limon Rotisserie's ceviche is very light and fresh!\n- Pollo a la Brasa- chicken marinated the \"traditional way\" and slowly cooked in a rotisserie.  Believe me, I love almost all rotisserie chickens.  But I don't believe that you've had great rotisserie chicken until you've come to Limon Rotisserie- it is seasoned deliciously in the most unexpectedly pleasant way.  \n-Vegetales Sateados- Yellow and grean beans saut\u00e9ed in soy sauce and limon.  Although this is a side, I would equate it with an awesome entr\u00e9e.  It can totally hold it's own against any small plate with a protein- it's that scrumptious!\n-Chicha Morada- fermented beverage derived from maize.  It looks as beautiful as pomegranate juice  but resembles the flavor of the best pink lemonade. \n\nLimon Rotisserie is so delicious that I brought my boyfriend soon after our business meeting, so he could experience their mind-blowing dishes.  Limon Rotisserie has become my #1 go-to restaurant.  Not only have I taken my boyfriend here but I've taken my boyfriend's parents and my own on separate occasions.\n\nFor me, Limon Rotisserie not only has the best food in the city but also the best value for your money.  My boyfriend and I usually order the half chicken which comes with two sides ($10) and two small plates ($10 each).  This is more than enough food for two people and probably enough for three.  Even with drinks, tax and tip, you probably won't spend more than $50.  With 5 people, two bottles of wine, a whole chicken and tons of small plates, the bill came out to $160.\n\nAlthough I intended to try Limon, the original, I have enjoyed many meals with great company at this fine establishment, Limon Rotisserie.\n\nP.S. This place is damn good, so either be prepared to wait or come a little early, before 7.  Also, it's not hard to find parking.  Either way, it's totally worth the wait!  Hope this helps!", "author": "Teena O."}

We tried the tuna tartar, the beet and potato salad, rotisserie chicken with rice and yucca fries...yum, yum, yum! The sangria is a bit too sweet for my taste but all and all, a great experience.

Also, too much ice!\n\nThe ceviche pescado is delightful and served with jumbo maize kernels.  The fish is fresh, tangy -- to die for.\n\nThe Lomito Saltado, small grilled beef cubes and papas fritas was smokey, delicious, and near sublime.  But it was really the chicken hot tapas plate (forget the name of it) was meaty heaven on a plate.  \n\nI'd highly recommend this place.  They have delicious tapas at a very affordable price.

My husband and I came prepared with empty stomachs.  Having lived in DC for a number of years I was already accustomed to the rotisserie style peruvian chicken - there are so many taste worthyy places in the DC area.  When my husband suggested Limon for dinner I immediately jumped at it. He made reservations at the other one - found out there were two - decided to opt for the Rotisserie simply because we werent sure if at the other one we would be done in time for a pressing engagement.  Nonetheless we ordered:\n\nhalf rotisserie chicken with yucca and tuca tuca - came with three dipping sauces - yummy!!!  Not a fan of the Chimichurri sauce as much as the other ones.  Tuca Tuca was interesting and flavorful.  Chicken and the two other aji sauces were spectacular.\n\nTuna tartare - the only negative of the night - there was absolutely no salt or citrus in this - just a dash would have made a world of difference - ok otherwise.\n\nSeco de Costillas - excellent!  the sauce had such a depth of flavor it was great\n\nJalea - forgettable - nothing special- everything tasted great but something you can find at any joint so probably wouldnt order it again and would instead stick to the true peruvian dishes\n\npitcher of sangria - it was good and plentiful\n\nwe had the bandido for dessert - this was just great and the perfect ending.  \n\nWe loved every bite we had.  The chicken is a must if you come here - its so hard to find peruvian rotisserie chicken places in the SF area so this was such a treasure and a place I will be sure to revisit.  \n\nThe wait staff were excellent and friendly as well - they really added to the 5 star experience.  \n\nPlease do visit this place!", "author": "radha a."}

We like the food and we like where it is located because we work at San Francisco General Hospital.  We have had staff celebrations in the lower room and also live around the corner and bring friends for a Pisco Sour and great chicken.  However, last night close to finishing our meal we were hounded by the waitress to pay  our check she came back for it at least four times and it was not busy like it usually is.  We gave a credit card and half cash.  The waitress charged us for the full amount using the credit card and pocketed the money.  After we told her that the cash was not the tip she asked the manager for help and hopefully cancelled the transaction however she said that we had not given her the amount that we said we did.  The manager did not believe us.  It is sad to realize that Limon has dishonest and poorly trained staff and that for us the amount that the wait staff pocketed is not going to break us.  But in these financially desperate times one needs to prevent these things from happening as much as possible.  I will not return to that Limon again and will not ever suggest it as a place for staff celebrations. Now I will be more careful and make sure wait staff know the amount of cash I have given them.  Limon's wait staff need to be trained that when customers give you cash to pay the check you do not pocket-it and any change that is left needs to be returned to the table. Be careful if you choose to go this is not the only posting addressing this problem at Limon.", "author": "Liz L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-14", "description": "Let me preface this review by saying: the food is actually really good.  My one star is because their service during my last trip was horrible.  I live half a block away so I've been here a few times.  Once with a large group of friends (that experience was fine), once with my partner for dinner (not so great because the downstairs is ridiculously loud), and a few times for take-out (this is by far the worst experience).  The other night I was craving some late night mac and cheese and placed a take out order.  They told me it would take 20 minutes.  I showed up after 20 minutes and went to the bar.  The bar wasn't actually that crowded, I was able to grab a seat.  After the bartender was done flirting with a female patron I told him I was picking up an order and he handed me the check.  $6.80.  I gave him $7.  Now, I get that 20 cents is only 20 cents.  I actually had every intention of tipping him a couple of bucks once he gave me my change.  But instead he took my money and didn't bother giving me my change.  I thought maybe I short changed the check so I asked him how much it was to confirm.  Apparently, the bartender thought I was tipping him the 20 cents so he didn't bother giving me my change.  This is what actually bothered me.  It wasn't the 20 minute wait for mac and cheese.  It wasn't even the additional 10 minutes I waited at the restaurant.  It was the fact that he felt entitled to my change, even though he wasn't.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I've always felt that proper etiquette was to give the customer their change, no matter how small.  I guess in the end that saved me a couple extra bucks because, needless to say, I didn't tip him after that.  And to be perfectly honest, I've always felt a little bit of a negative vibe whenever I go there.  It's very obvious that I'm gay, and my partner and I have always disliked the underlying attitude given to us when we go there.  Not sure if it's because we're gay, or if it's because I look like I don't have a lot of money (I wear t-shirts, jeans, and sneakers).  Either way, it's extremely off-putting.", "author": "Christina C."}

The drinks are also creative and they have an excellent pisco sour.  I have brought many friends visiting from out of town and they are always satisified after dining here.  I was surprised that there is a downstairs so they can fit in a lot of people.  Wise to make a reservation ahead of time and also it is difficult to park in that area so be prepared for that.  The sangria also is delicious here so in a large group it's worth it to order a pitcher.

One in our party dropped out at the last minute, but we showed up on time and were shown to the smallest table in the world.\n\nThey had taken a 4-top, which was squeezed into one of the window alcoves next to the hostess podium, shoved two chairs on the ends, and called it a 6-top.  \n\nIt was literally impossible to have 6 adults, one holding an infant, to sit at the table, and that was before the food came out.\n\nWe politely asked if we could relocate, but the hostess rebuffed us when we pointed out it was actually a 4-top by saying she would bring out two extra chairs.\n\nThe manager then came over and kept saying, \"I don't want to argue with you sir . . .\" while insisting that the could not shove 3 2-tops together.\n\nFinally, a gentlemen who we thought was the owner came over, shoved the three tables together, and served us for the evening.  He was very professional, which helped make up for a very bad first impression\n\nNow, on to the food.  The chicken was phenomenal.  The breast meat was moist while the thighs and wings were falling off the bone.  This, of course, begs one to wonder how the hell the cook it so well! \n\nThat and I kept wondering how the cut the sweet potato fries so thin while keeping them crunchy on the outside, but soft in the middle.\n\nWhile the chocolate gooey thing was nice, the other desserts left a bit to be desired.

Halloween night and a very special friends birthday brought me to Limon Rotisserie. I will have to say it is located in a stretch of So. Van Ness that you wouldn't expect to find such a gem of a restaurant. The space is great, very open and not to loud allowing for the aroma of yummy chickens to flow through the room. Our wait staff was amazing. I am not sure who our primary waiter was but they all just helped as one big team. Yucca fries, papa frittes, whole roast chickens, calamari, ceviche, beets, and so many other yummy things. It was all just delicious and perfect for a group of 7 people to share. If you want something to warm you up on a dismal day then check out Limon Rotisserie.", "author": "Scott P."}

When they arrived my first thought was - we ordered too much for a starter - wrong - they were crazy good and all devoured.  From there we moved on to Vegetable Salteados - Grilled Green Beens and peppers - perfect texture in a nice marinade, Ceviche Halibut fillet & Tiger Shrimp, Ahi Tuna Tartar with a Ponzu dressing - very fresh and tasty. 2 of each. And lastly - Skewered tiger shrimp in a garlic, ginger type sauce.  Yep - All good. And whatever that Red Portuguese Wine was they recommended - complemented everything perfectly.

I came here a couple weeks ago with a group of about twelve people.  Bonus points that I was driving here and there was no problem finding street parking.  Many, many thanks to Carlos A. for organizing our group (and getting there about an hour early to secure us a table).  The place is small, they don't take reservations, but the food is DELISH!  The chicken was fantastic - juicy tender meat and crispy delicious skin.  I love eating with people who don't like the wings, those are my favorite!  We tried a bunch of the steak dishes, they were tender, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The ahi tartare was fresh and tasty, and the side dishes rounded out the meal perfectly.  I did not drink that night, but was told the sangria was perfect and not too sweet.  I have to say, I was slightly disappointed by the cheesecake-like dessert I tried.  It was certainly good, but after such a spectacular meal I was expecting dessert to be orgasmic, and alas it was not.  Oh well, next time I'll just order more at the main course and skip dessert.  I like salty stuff better anyway.  :-)  \n\nOh, how could I forget the best part of the meal - each of us only paid $20.  For a TON of food and the sangria.

We ended up leaving, much to my disappointment. I went back a few days later with my coworkers. We asked our waiter, who was extremely helpful, for any ideas on what to get. He said that the rotisserie chicken was the best. It is also on the 7x7 top 100 items as well. He explained that it was marinated for 48 hours in some special spices and it is would be the best we would ever have. We were sold on the spot. \n\nI split a half chicken with one of my coworkers and my side was the tacu tacu (refried beans and rice, lightly battered and then fried) and the fries. The tacu tacu is really really good!! My coworkers said that the roasted vegetables were really good too. Also the drinks are really good. The mango or strawberry lemonade are both really good choices. If you go on a weekend night, just be prepared to get there early or wait. But the wait is definitely worth it.", "author": "aron l."}

I've heard this place gets crowded but we got there early enough and probably also got lucky.  There was 7 of us and a table opened up just as we got there.  I read some of the recent negative posts, mostly about a rude and obnoxious host.  We did not experience that guy.  Our host was a very nice lady.  Not only did she offer to take our coats, but worked to help put the extra tables together for our large party and helped us find a place for our baby stroller.\n\nThis place is noisy and busy in a good way.  Great vibe!  The food was EXCELLENT.  Going here in a large group is the way to go.  You can order more things.  We had:\nOne whole chicken - some of the tastiest chicken I've ever had.  Tender, moist and very tasty.  My two year old son kept asking for more.  We couldn't feed it to him fast enough\nBoth Ceviches were very good.  It came with these little nutty things that were like roasted pine nuts and largest kernels of corn on the cob I've ever seen.  Things I've never eaten before, and glad I tried.\nEnsalada Rusa a classic Limean salad - I love beet salads.  This did not disappoint\nTartara de Tuna Ahi - I don't know what they put in it, but it tasted so good.  Very unique spicing.  You've got to try it.\nBraised Beef Short Ribs - VERY VERY tender.  I could bathe in the sauce they came in.\nWe had something else that was like a Chinese vegetable stir fry.  It tasted surprisingly like authentic Chinese food.  I come to find out that Peru has a large Chinese population and Chinese food has worked it's way into Peruvian cooking.\n\nThis place is great.

I saw people of all ages eating there, enjoying their food - people on dates, people with their families, people celebrating birthdays.  Service is friendly and polite.  Their rotisserie chicken is meant to be eaten with the sauces - otherwise it's quite plain.  Their grilled hanger steak - carne a la Parrilla - was perfectly cooked.

Instead, we got seats right away by an open window - very nice on a hot evening. And by the way, the hostess told us that they do take reservations, despite what Yelp says.\n\nThe waiters were helpful, fast and very professional. We started out with beers - an Imperial and a Cristal. Small gripe here: There are five beers on the menu and they're all $4. There should be a $3 beer, but I suppose you have to charge a bit more if you're importing.\n\nWe split a half chicken - which comes with two sides - and then got two other plates: a ceviche mixto for her, an aguadito de pollo (basically a chicken stew) for me. For sides I got yucca fries and she got sauteed vegetables.\n\nThe food came out fast, perhaps suspiciously so. I understand the chicken is ready-to-go, it being on a rotisserie, but the speed of the service caused a couple mishaps in my dinner. First, I found a piece of metal confetti in my chicken stew. It was about an inch long, and twisted. Malleable, but not soft like a piece of real confetti. More on that later.\n\nThe other mishap were my yucca fries. The plate came with around six fries, and each one was cool or even cold in the middle, like they had been unsuccessfully defrosted in a microwave. They would have bordered on inedible had Limon not provided two small bowls of different delicious sauces, which I heaped liberally on the fries.\n\nMy girlfriend's ceviche, on the other hand, was perfectly balanced with citrus, spice and salt. Delicious. Her sauteed vegetables were well-cooked, but nothing we couldn't do at home. \n\nThe chicken - Limon's flagship dish - was surprisingly just OK. Not to say it was actually bad, just not what you would expect from a declared \"rotisserie.\" It seemed that the effort that went into making a salty and delicious skin had left the chicken itself rather dry. Still, not bad.\n\nFinally, aside from the metal confetti, my chicken stew was actually quite good - the second-best dish after the ceviche in my opinion. Regarding the metal: I don't like causing scenes, or complaining to people in the service industry, but I felt compelled to tell a waiter about the metal in my stew. I got up and walked to the back to give one a quiet word, but then another man, probably a manager, swooped in and asked what the problem was. I handed him the metal shard, and he said he would take care of it.\n\nLimon took the offending soup off of our bill, which was appreciated, though my friend, who was a waiter and bartender himself for a couple years, said the restaurant should've offered a free dinner. \n\nLimon was very satisfactory, and even if the chicken stew hadn't been comped, we would've each paid only in the mid-$20 range for a lot of tasty food. But I was left a little uneasy at the thought that I could've swallowed a tiny, twisted piece of metal, and that will probably scare me away from coming back again any time soon. Still, Limon's atmosphere, service, a few great dishes make it a 3/5 in my book.", "author": "Evan H."}

We had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table so we chatted outside and it was mild October night so the time flew by.  When we got in the place was small with warm lighting and nice art on the walls.  The place was a little loud but we were able to still converse without raising our voices too much.  Since the pricing was good we decided to order a lot of things.  We ordered the halibut and tiger shrimp ceviche, a whole rotisserie chicken with fries and rice for sides, chicken chicharron, fried calamari, fish, and yucca, and the chiramoya creme brulee and tiramisu for dessert.  The ceviche seemed to be lacking in flavor and sweetness from the seafood but it was decent, the chicken chicharron were good but an instant heart attack on a plate, the fried calamari, fish, and yucca were very plain and forgettable, but the rotisserie chicken was very succulent and flavorful with a good rub/marinade on it.  The only thing I noticed though was that it was on the fine line between well seasoned and too salty.  As for desserts the chiramoya creme brulee was rich and creamy but the tiramisu was fantastic.  It wasn't the conventional tiramisu but individually constructed in a goblet with a layering of the ladyfingers and creme.\n\nThe service of this place was solid with their excellent staff; I didn't even notice them changing silverware and switching out plates during the meal.  We paid about $35 each with tax and tip and for all the food we got and how full our bellies were, it was a great value.  Although Peruvian food is not my favorite, I'll definitely come back her for the chicken and the tiramisu.\n\nScoring Breakdown: Ambiance - 10%, Food - 50%, Service - 20%, Value - 20%\n\nMy score is as follows:\nAmbiance: 3.75 stars\nFood: 3.75 stars\nService. 4.0 stars\nValue: 4.25 stars\nOverall: 3.9 stars = 4 stars", "author": "Gordon T."}

Not knowing any better we ordered a mere half chicklet ($9.50!) and a couple of smaller dishes, cerviche, and some deep fried seafood (Jaela?).  The cerviche was very yummy, the jaela merely very good.  And then there was the chicken.  Now looky: I love my budness and I know she loves her chicken and she works hard and lord knows she needs those calories.  But as I sat there licking my fingers the thought occurred to me that I could, hypothetically mind you, reach across the table, grab her piece of chicken and run out the door!  And she would not be able to catch me!!  However, that thought immediately gave way to this: hey I'm licking my fingers, this stuff is no doubt actually \"finger licking good.\"  The proof is right here betwixt tongue and said fingers.  Then it was on to a brief bout of guilt about licking fingers in rather nice restaurant but that thought was tempered by the fact that the place was jam packed with patrons intent on their own chicken units and no one in the place was paying a hoots ass to me with exception of aforementioned budness.\n\nCan also recommend vegetable saltado as a side dish.", "author": "David B."}

I have frequented this place over and over again, each time bringing a new set of friends.  None of them have been disappointed.\n\nThe food: \n-The rotisserie chicken is what this place is known for.  I think it is on the salty side.  While others agree, they insist that it is the best chicken they've ever eaten despite the saltiness.  \n-Tacu Tacu: it is fried, rice and beans!  This side dish comes in three and is molded into a twinkie shape.  Surprisingly yummy!\n-Pescado Ceviche: I've tried ceviche at many places and Limon's is top notch.  The sauce that the marinade the ceviche in has the perfect balance of flavors.  They use grouper for the ceviche if anyone is curious.\n-Sweet potato fries: decent.  Nothing notable.\n-Vegetable empanadas: Usually a meat eater, but these empanadas are the best empanadas I've ever tried!  The mascarpone cheese really does zazz up this little treat and the mushrooms (usually I say yuck to mushrooms) are even delightful.  I always have to order these little bites of heaven. :)\n-Sangria: delicious!  Quality sangria.  However, I wish they would just remove the lemon/orange rinds.  Those are unappetizing when I accidentally bite into them.\n-Blue corn drink: I forgot the name of it, but for those who want something non-alcoholic, this is super special, and definitely Peruvian!\n\nThe restaurant:\nDon't get this restaurant confused with the one on Valencia.  This one is more affordable and have a different menu from Valencia store.  There are two levels to this restaurant.  A tip-make reservations and request to sit on the bottom level.  The upstairs is too crowded while the downstairs has more ample seating and is conveniently located to a unisex bathroom.  They play music downstairs too and has a hip/trendy feel to the place.  This place can accomodate large parties and is totally fun for birthday celebrations or graduations.  \n\nPros: Affordable and you will get full after nibbling on all the little side dishes on top of the chicken.  \n\n*One time I came with a party of 10, and they actually accepted 8 different credit cards.  Wait service is SPECTACULAR THERE!!!\n\nCons: Parking is a pain.

I gotta speak the truth though - the sangria was the best thing I had there. Every dish was way too salty, from the chicken to the side of vegetables. We had to order rice to offset the salt load. To top it off, the chicken was dry. No joke. I would have been better off just ordering a pitcher of sangria and 3 orders of yucca fritas. Let's leave the food aside and talk about the service. I have to give props to our waiter - he was friendly, helpful, and attentive. The negative, though, was our table was right in front of the kitchen and as the restaurant filled up, they allowed waiting patrons to stand along side the kitchen, literally 6 inches from our table. It got extremely uncomfortable trying to enjoy our meal with a party of 6 yacking away and staring at our food.

This past weekend, made a trip up to the city and decide to have lunch at Limon Rotisserie. Walking in, the place is very intimate yet you do not feel like you are crowded at your table. Greeted by the friendly staff, immediately makes you feel welcomed to be there. We did had ceviche pescado y camaron for starters, and by surprise there was calamari included. Very nice addition. Our entree was the half chicken with rice and french fries. The chicken melted in your mouth it was so tender and juicy. The chicken was so good, and even ate the skin, in which I never do. Of course topping it off with a Peruvian beer. My recommendation is to go to Limon Rotisserie several times and just work your way down the menu.", "author": "Launie D."}

The decor is awful, the service minimal or pretentious and the noise level is immediately headache inducing.  To start, my guests were running slightly late for our reservation and were told we had a \"15 minute warning\" before they gave way our table by the snooty girl who is what passes for a maitre d' in the place.  We should have been so lucky!  Upstairs is not bad but downstairs is horrible. My heart sank as we were led downstairst to a poured concrete floor basement which smells of the cheap soap in the toilets.  It was full of very large tables with birthday parties who kept repeatedly singing happy birthday. It was so loud down there my guests and I could hardly speak to each other.  They need to not be so greedy and only place large parties down there and have the basement be a party room.  If they don't have any more tables upstairs, then they shouldn't seat any more parties.  The downstairs is not a place which merits cloth napkins - it should just have wet towelettes to go with the wipe down seating and the concrete floor.  The floor was so dirty that I could feel it crunching under my feet as I walked across it and my banquette seat was also filthy - with crumbs everywhere.  The real pity is that the food is really quite good with decent portion sizes. We even managed to ignore the fact that they hadn't had a delivery (always a sign that a restaurant is about to go under) and were missing several drinks options on the menu. All in all, not a place I would repeat despite the good food and definitely wouldn't recommend it unless people want to go in sweats and eat with their fingers while shouting at each other across the table.", "author": "Sonia L."}

So it was only a matter of time I paid a visit to Limon. Nestled on a busy corner on 21st and South Van Ness in the heart of the MIssion, this resturant did not disappoint, well, not all the way. Sporting a chique kitchen and ambiance, this place is definitely not for those who are looking for Lomo Saltado the way Mom used to make it. Called Lomito Saltado, it is nonetheless prepared in an exquisitely spiced froth and just the right mix of red onions, tomatoes and french fries. Rice is separate. This is more a tapas-style place, remember. I also decided to try the Anticuchos de Res. Delicious, albeit on the over-spiced side. I would have liked to seen more potato on the dish instead of a 1/8th of a corn and a sliver of yucca. In any event, the meal was very tasty. As mentioned, however, if you want a Peruvian meal served like home, stick with Mi Lindo Peru or even Machu Piccu in San Mateo. This place is certainly for a nice crowd that wants to dabble in a Peruvian meal not be filled up by one. The service was just average and the initial round of soda was flat with no ice. All in all, not a bad place to eat, but, I do miss home.", "author": "Sal T."}

Servers made fun of my girlfriend last Saturday when she ordered some food to go. One of the servers (a male server) specifically forgot to order her food and made up a story that somebody else picked up the food for her. She could not believe it but she still waited another half hour for her second order. Afterwards, she was told by another server that everything was a joke but they did not apologize to her. On the contrary, they were laughing at her and even the server denied what he told her in the beginning. My friend felt humiliated and had to leave the place in tears. It is very disappointing that restaurants like this have no respect for elderly women and have no clue for what customer service is, especially a restaurant that charges a premium price for their food. I contacted the owner and he said he was going to find out what happened but it is over a week and he has not contacted us. Just for the record, he did not apologize either. Both owner and employees need to go to an intensive training on customer service, and why not care and compassion for their guests too.", "author": "Gabriela S."}

Well when more than half our party had arrived, they still made us wait around for 30 minutes.  So they basically couldn't seat us, because some issue with the parties downstairs which had thrown off their seating.  That is what I was told.  We all had brought our appetites, and having a 9pm reservation and waiting for that long was not really good, especially for the hungry among us.  Oh well, we get seated finally.  Then waiting for some water and food took another 30 minutes again.  After 1 hour, you can imagine how snappy some of us were.  Finally I request the manager.  Our non-waiter actually snaps to it, and starts bringing us water and telling us our cold plates are on the way.  So now its probably been 1 hour 15 minutes and we finally get something to eat.  Again with the seating, we asked for a chair and we get some crazy explanation about a fire exit??  I mean seriously our experience is pretty much similar to the one below.  I do finally talk to the manager/owner/chef, and he is on the side of his staff, saying well I think you're overreacting, embellishing the times.  After talking to him, our food does seem to come quicker.  That of course, is after they bring the adjacent table's food  to us first and then realize it is the wrong table and take it back.  Our tables are adjacent each other but separated by a couch in between.  It was just an odd night with odd behavior, and odd accusations.  I would definitely eat the food again, but I would not go in a large group for a special occasion  in the future.", "author": "Justified K."}

However, I could only give the restaurant 3 stars as I found the service to be not-so-great and the location questionable (single woman walking there at night...not so good)!  The waiter was very attentive prior to taking our order, but once taken, it took a long time for the first course to come out.  Then the 2nd-5th courses all came within minutes of each other...not the best delivery technique.  Once dinner was served, we were pretty much ignored except for the assistant wait-staff who regularly refilled our glasses of water (thank you to those guys).  It took me a long time to flag our waiter (or any of his helpers) to request a dessert menu.  When we got the menu, he took a good 15 to 20 minutes to come back and take our order.  In the meantime, a cake was delivered (we were there for a birthday) with a candle that was not lit, and no utensils.  Thank goodness I carry matches with me.  By the time the waiter came back, we were done with the idea of dessert and asked to please have the check.

It was a warm Friday afternoon and we were the second group of people entering the restaurant. For starters, we ordered the Shrimp and Fish ceviche; it was very tasty and refreshing; the seafood was extremely fresh and the dressing was not too sour like in other similar restaurants.  Next came the whole chicken, steamed vegetables, and french fries. The chicken was fingerlicking deliciouse.  I initially had a fear the the chicken would taste like El Pollo Loco (which I have nothing against; still good but why go anywhere else then?), but the chicken packs a whallop of flavor and was juicy and tender. Also you would think the vegetables would be dull and flavorless, however, they add spices to the extremely fresh veggies, I had multiple servings.The french fries are just your plain ol fries; nothing really to complain...I just wished it packed more of a punch.  I also decided to try their sangria which was also very good...a little too sweet for me but nonetheless, resfreshing and delicious. The service was nothing special; attentive and got the job done however nothing where they add a personal touch. The bill was a shocker too!

It's spacious with a minimalist decor, and the food is just as tasty as it was in it's sister restaurant.  My friend and I had the tuna salad that was immersed in ponzu dressing, which was delicious.  We shared the chicharron de pollo,  the smaller version of lomo saltado, and the hanger steak dish that was accompanied with tacu tacu.  All dishes were full of flavor, and the chicken was cooked to a light crisp, while both steak dishes were satisfyingly tender.  I fell in love with the tacu tacu, which I learned is just beans and rice (Yes, beans and rice... I'm a simple gal) mashed together in a patty that is lightly covered with what looks like bread crumbs of some sort.  For dessert, we had the flan with a thin gelatin layer of mango and it was quite refreshing.  Next time, I will try the rotisserie chicken and hopefully by then the restaurant will have a license to serve alcohol.  I did notice many people picking up orders to go, which I did not understand.

Beware - on the wknds they can have a long wait. Overall a great experience - tasty chicken (c'mon it's called Limon Rotisserie, so indulge  yourself in that rotisserie style chicken - plus it's your best bet in having a value meal) & great sides. So, something unknown to me as we're deciding on what to order is that when you order the whole chicken you get two sides. I didn't realize it at the time, and so we overordered. Even with the great fun loving four women we were, we so overstuffed our turkey bodies that we didn't even have room for the dessert! As a woman, I personally am not sure how we got to that point. I know I know, you ask why didn't cut out some of the dishes you ordered - well it was sort of \"too late\" as I had ended up ordering the cold dishes first then the warm ones. So I did end up cutting out one of the hot dishes. Sorry I am digressing....\n\nWe ordered the:\n- ceviches de pescados: excellent quality with great flavors\n- beet salad (I forgot the name): beware this salad tastes essentially like a mustard based potato salad - and although the beets do add an earthy texture, it just wasnt' my favorite thing and I would elect for something else (unless you are vegetarian)\n- CHICKEN- Did like the flavors - tasted like a cumin rub of some sort with some great accompanying sauces made out of peruvian chiles. yum! \n- Short Ribs - WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too salty. DO NOT ORDER! I've had many short ribs about 1000x better, save yourself money.\n- Vegetables Salteados (sp?) - Good, but nothing like WOW, but definitely a value priced vegetable - I always love fiber!\n- My favorite - TACU-TACU - if you dont' like rice & beans do NOT order this. Else, DO IT! It's essentially a slightly spice rice & bean mixture that has been deep fried - think KFC deep fried delicious exterior (but without animal lard) on top of some yummy rice & beans.\n\nI could definitely go back just for tacu-tacu.

I just went to this place last night with my in-laws and husband and everything was great.  Every dish we ordered was very well done.  The ceviche was excellent and the chicken was very tender and tasty.  Another stand out thing was the service which was friendly and VERY attentive without being irritating.  I liked how they wiped the table between courses.  Great place and well run.", "author": "L G."}

There is a tonne of average food in the city that will cost you a whole lot more. We usually order a whole chicken (plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day), and a couple of sides. Greens are tasty, Yucca Frita are crispy and tasty. Good sangria, and the coffee is strong (the mark of a restaurant that gives a damn, in my opinion).  And the other small plates are good too. Never disappointed there. The wait on weekends can be annoying. We avoid that whole craziness by going on weekdays.", "author": "Erin C."}

I had my 23rd birthday party at Limon and the staff was more than accommodating for my large and rambunctious group. The roasted chicken, appetizers, and Sangria were fabulous. All of which including tax and tip $18 a person!! Come here again and again!", "author": "Rowena P."}

My only complaint is that the chicken is a bit too salty in areas.  The white meat is fine, but the dark meat is too well seasoned.   Additionally, due to its popularity, the wait on weekends is long for this little restaurant.", "author": "Sharon W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-09", "description": "So let me just preface this review by saying that Limon used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city... so when I had heard the new Limon had just opened up at their new location, I was excited to go. First of all - major problem with their website: we called the number on the website assuming that this was the number to call for reservations for Limon (logically). Wrong! Not only did they not confirm what location the reservation was for (the website does not differentiate between the Rotisserie and the regular Limon) but no confirm call was given, nothing. So we show up for a table for 4 at 8pm last Friday night - turns out the reso was for the other location. The hostess called to the other location to tell us we were coming and to hold our table. We get there - and our names were already crossed off. We were only a few minutes late going to the wrong restaurant but the hostess says she'll get us a table. Fast forward an HOUR AND A HALF - we're STILL waiting for our table - despite my seeing open tables. A whole group of us were waiting to be seated for over an hour, despite having made a reservation a week in advance. The worst part was - the hostess didn't seem to know what she was doing and was rather rude to us. It's 9:30 when we finally get seated, no apologies, no one addressing how visibly pissed we were. The food was OK (which is why I give the one star) - but definitely not worth the terrible experience we had leading up to it. I can safely say - until they fire their hostess and get open table - and at least get their act together - I will never come back to this restaurant. Save your money and go somewhere else instead.", "author": "Christie W."}

Rotisserie chicken was ultra flavorful and moist sans sauces, but ultra tasty with the dipping sauces.  Prices are low, but the ambience makes it perfect for a nice night out.  The ceviche de pescado was phenomenal, with just the right amount of heat from the chile.  Despite the only drawback that they don't have Cusque\u00f1a beer, we will certainly make this a regular stop.", "author": "Kristin L."}

The ceviche is fantastic, so is the chicken, the hanger steak, short ribs, yuca, fries, tacu tacu and fruit cake.  Both times we went at 6:30 and were seated with no wait (3 people).  Service is very good.  Today we took my toddler and they were friendly and quick, last time I was with friends and not at all rushed.", "author": "diana c."}

I've been waiting to find a great Peruvian chicken place, and finally we've got one in SF!  Delicious!  My mouth is still watering.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner.  And to top it off, the prices are very reasonable.  Especially when you get the whole chicken with two sides, which is almost enough food for two hungry eaters.  They could double their prices and I still think they'd be a great place to get dinner.", "author": "Erik B."}

Having heard good things, we went there on a Sunday night around 7:00 p.m.  The staff seemed totally overwhelmed.  When we asked how long it would take for a table the maitre de told us it would be at least a half hour so we opted to sit at the bar where he told us we could eat dinner.  We waited for over 20 minutes and no one came to take an order or even check in.  Finally we asked one of the waiters if he could take our order and he refused, telling us we could not eat at the bar.  However, a couple seats down another waitress was taking a food order at the bar.  When we pointed this out, he huffed \"well SHE can take your order then\".  When we finally caught her eye she said she would be back to take our order but never did.  At that point we left.  I have never written a restaurant review before; I can tolerate mediocre food, slow service, etc., but not outright rudeness.  The staff is absolutely incompetent and incredibly rude.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-21", "description": "A little peeved that we were told it would take 1.5 hrs to get seated but there was a lounge downstairs that just opened. Luckily, a couple left so there were empty footstools to sit on but we had to share a coffee table with another couple until we got seated at a real table in the lounge.   Service downstairs was somewhat scatterbrained until we got our table, altogether 20-30 min wait.  I think for the main dining room, it was about a 1 hr wait.  But oh boy was the food good!  Recommend the ceviche mixto with shrimp, halibut and calamari.  The hangar steak, the ceviche halibut and shrimp, and tuna tartare. For dessert, the mascarpone rasberry layered cake.  So happy with everything. They had sangria carafes however I had the mango and strawberry drinks (non alcoholic since I'm driving).  Between 2 people, it was just enough and came out to about $25+ tip.  Not bad.  Very young crowd.  Looks like they'll be having a DJ booth in the lounge as well. Our server Eduardo was especially beautiful to look at.", "author": "Eesayah O."}

I'd been to Limon on Valencia many times but the last few times was disappointed.  I wanted to like this place but approached it with apprehension.  How good could it be, afterall, being something of a stepchild to Limon grande?  All this notwithstanding, my first bite of the Pollo a la Brasa dispelled all doubts and I was wisked away to the hallowed state of culinary bliss.  And it was just chicken!  I have chicken all the time, but somehow this chicken was extra tasty and succulent, nicely enhanced by the two dipping sauces.   Along with that we had the Lomito Saltado, which I think was better than the same dish I had at big Limon, and the rice we ordered was absolutely heavenly.  When you can actually rave about plain rice then you know something is right.   To cap it all off, I was totally enraptured by the bandido chocolate cake, a definite must order.   Vas-y toute suite!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-25", "description": "We arrived on time for our reservation. The hostess told us it would be 5-10 min for the table to be ready. This was fine so we waited near the door. A couple came in without a res. and was seated before us, but soon after that we were called. The decor was nice. It was a little dark when we were seated and as we glanced the menu. They soon turned the lights on a little brighter. It was a little claustrphobic and stuffy. Good thing we sat right by the door. This place harbors trendy yuppie clientele which I wasn't really fond of but that's just me. The waiter was nice but I felt pressure through out the meal. We ordered the saltado chicken dish which was very good. Only thing is that the waiter was taking the plate away as I was still finishing. So I had to inform him I was still working on it and he thought I was crazy or something. We also ordered the sirloin strips with onions, red peppers, etc..it was just ok, not great. We finished and he wanted us to look at the menu again since we ordered those \"small plates\" and again he was stunned that \"this was your dinner?\" So, this waiter kinda bothered me. He pressured us to order yet rushed us to finish.  Limon is ok but not great, I wouldn't go back.", "author": "Jay W."}

There wasn't really alot to choose from but hey who am i to be picky?  So i ordered steak with fries and DAMN! that was the best thing i've ever had!!!! lol.. then i tried their chicken it was PHENOMENAL!!! It was sooo good!!! it reminded me of my hometown in Jeddah, K.S.A. then the chocolate cake, OMG!  Best thing ever!!!! EVER!!! I had such a blast there that two days after I ate there with my friends I brought my boyfriend there for our anniversary and he loved theplace too!!!! lol... portions are decent (well at least for me) and the wine with fruits is HELLA GOOD!!! i really and strongly recommend this place to anyone out there... Don't let the location and size of the place fool you because this place is always packed.. I'm not surprised why... You all should check this place out... I give this restaurant a 10 star if I could, but 5 starts should be enough to let everyone know how GREAT this place is... Bon Apetit!", "author": "Christina Z."}
