Get the budae jjigae if it's your first time here.\n\nFor a city as diverse as San Francisco, there aren't any especially good Korean restaurants worth noting. Although Fillmore Social Club is not the best Korean food you've had, the entrees are solid and the ambiance is pleasant. This restaurant has plenty of seating for parties large and small, and almost no wait time even on weekends.\n\nThe interior design of Fillmore Social Club is clean and well lit. It delivers what you expect of a brunch spot in SF - indoor plants and wooden floors and tables. Another plus are the large TV screens playing flashy K-pop music videos without sound. Sit facing the screen if you anticipate being bored by the conversation from the person in front of you.\n\nI've had several dishes here, including the budae jjigae and the stone pot. The budae jjigae is spicy and the portions are quite large. They do fusion dishes well - the tofu salad was recommended to me as a good choice (actually didn't look so bad.) 4/5.", "author": "Chris W."}

The pork belly was soft and the thin cuts went so well with the fatty portions. The seaweed seasoning on top made each bite extra savory. The pot comes out quite hot, so some of the rice on the bottom cook for longer, making it very crispy and a wonderful pairing with the meat.

The fries were a disappointment since it tasted like we were eating a small bowl of cheetos for $5? The chicken was ok but the star was the bacon. It was amazing and very flavorful.\nFor mains - we got the Spicy Pork Bap, K-Nacho, Sniggle and the Galbi. The spicy pork bap was nice, not too spicy and the ingredients was well-balanced. The K-nacho was pretty good, lots of toppings for all the chips underneath. The Sniggle (whole fried squid) was ok. The batter was too thick so you're eating a lot of oil and fried batter which made my stomach a little queasy afterwards. The Galbi had a funny taste to it, almost like they added too much bean paste or something.

The menu touted Korean dishes with a twist.\n\nKorean fried chicken: This was heavier on the breading, which provided a good, thicker crunch. In contrast to the crisp, the chicken was dressed in moist sauces. There were 2 sauces, one resembling a sweet and sour, the other that was spicy. I don't recall if the pieces were white or dark meat, perhaps a mix.\n\nPork belly pot: Pieces of pork belly seasoned with a savory sauce, topped with sesame seeds and green onion atop white rice. It was definitely comfort food (not a fusion dish).\n\nShak shuka: This was an interesting concoction -  beef ribs in tomato sauce with melted cheese on top. Probably the most \"fusion\" of the dishes ordered that night. I think the novelty of the dish was initially a little hard to adjust to. The tomato sauce wasn't the traditional one used in pasta (I couldn't tell what additional flavors were there) and the different cuts of beef with cheese was a new experience. It was fine to eat that night but I don't think I'd order this dish again.\n\nIt's meat-centric here so probably not a great place for vegetarians/vegans.

Hopefully this place doesn't get too popular like the others, as FSC has definitely become one of my top choices for brunch in the city now. (Best kept secret, for sure!)\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Softshell Crab Benedict ($18), which I was so intrigued by not just from the presentation but the fusion of that American and Korean flair in brunch cuisine. The crispy softshell crab was a good size and gave such a yummy and crunchy texture along the creamy poached egg. To add, the side of colorful potatoes it came with are always spot on!\n\nMy friends ordered the Hangover Shakshuka ($15) and Chi Bap ($14), which I tried a bite of. I'm not really a big fan of shakshuka in general, but the tomato-based cause was nice and spicy --a real good kick of fire! As for the chi bap, it came on a beautifully crafted skillet of rice, shredded egg, and a nicely arranged tower of Korean fried chicken. I definitely loved how Korean fried chicken is extra crispy and saucy, so A+ in my book!\n\nOf course you can't go to any of these sister restaurants without getting the Millionaire's Bacon ($8) added on as a side.

Place was fairly empty which is nice since from my experience at Kitchen Story, waiting is usually part of the experience. Parking wasn't too bad on a weekday and we snagged a metered spot nearby. Service was friendly and I loved the look of the restaurant.\n\nFor our meal we ordered the following:\n1) Moe Galbi: Friend's entree. Tried a bit. Flavorful galbi w/ a good char and marinade. Green onion salad was the perfect side dish. A decent portion but mostly it's the extra items vs meat. A bit pricey for $25 when you can get similar items/quality at any decent Korean place (3.5/5)\n\n2) Pork Belly Pot: Once again a decent portion. Pork's flavor was there but nothing special. Most of our cuts were on the leaner side. Not dry but not juicy either. Eggs on top looked great but the dish really needed something to lighten it. (3.25/5)\n\n3) Crab's Benedict: I don't know what happened w/ this dish. First the positives. The portion is very generous and the soft shell crab itself is delicious. Well fried, great batter, solid seasoning. Eggs were poached well. However, every other component of the dish was just strange. The consistency of the hollandaise was great but there was a flavor I just couldn't put my finger on. Not sure how to describe it besides \"off\". It wasn't flatout bad but I prefer a traditional hollandaise. Next issue was the english muffin. It was so so dense and hard. I shouldn't have to saw through my bread (and fail). However the biggest offender of the meal was the iceberg lettuce between my crab and muffin. Iceberg lettuce is the failure of the vegetable world and has no right being anywhere except a cafeteria side salad. (2/5)\n\nOverall, my experience here was very average. I appreciate the creativity in the dishes but for the most part the items are close enough to a traditional dish that you can get an equally large portion of and at a better price with equal/better quality. I know the owner does take his businesses very seriously and my experience at Kitchen Story was mostly positive so I'm hoping this place will find it's stride with time.

The spam and eggs were delicious and the rice crackers brought some interesting texture (pro tip: soak the rice crackers in the sauce for a few minutes). I do wish they had added more bacon though - there were just a few pieces sprinkled on top.\n\nMy friends got the Kimchi Fried Rice, Jazzy Army Stew, and Musubi Benedict - all of which tasted great. The Musubi Benedict was a unique take on eggs benedict as it was served over rice with a side of salad and green mashed potatoes. They lit a small tea candle under the large bowl of army stew which hardly seemed functional but the flavor of the stew was delicious!\n\nThe service was a bit slow - the food took a long time to come out and we found ourselves with empty cups looking around for water. I'm not sure what kind of fusion the restaurant is going for - it seems eclectic as certain dishes fuse Korean cuisine with Japanese, American, and even Middle Eastern influences.

The dish also had a softball-sized mound of shaved green onion --really too much for one human to eat.\nSince I like to be able to taste my food, I ignored the red, hot sauce in the little tin as well as the fiery-looking kimchi in another same tiny tin (never like to lose my sense of taste by masking my food with hot sauce; would prefer to save the tastebuds).\nWhat did I think of my meal you ask? It was sort of meh. The food came out lukewarm (the meat could have been sitting under a heat lamp and just scooped up & put on the plate). Similarly the rice was tepid and a little hard so I wonder if it had been sitting out in the open air overlong.\nThe decor was nice and there are multiple rooms to accommodate various size parties. What I found most irritating was the difficulty in getting the attention of a server. It seemed like each server had blinders on and would dash into the room, drop off a dish and without looking up run out.\nIt took time for us to order and I noticed that a quartet of people who ordered after us got their food first!\nThis neighborhood lacks food eateries that are wholesome and Fillmore Street Social club does fill that void.

The interior is very well decorated, with a modern appeal. \n\nI had been eyeing the soft shell crab benedict, and decided to order it; my friend went for the bulgogi hash. The food came out fairly quickly, and the plates were the perfect amount for a very filling meal. The soft shell crab Benedict came with two brioche-like buns, topped with two soft shell crabs drizzled with a teriyaki-type sauce, two poached eggs, and hollandaise (which I opted to have on the side). The soft shell crabs were very crispy, but a little too fried for my taste. The brioche buns were perfectly crunchy and buttery, and the teriyaki sauce on the soft shell crabs complemented the flavors well. My biggest concern were the poached eggs. Both mine and my friends' poached eggs were not poached very well, and they did not have the runny-yolk that is essential to a perfectly poached egg. My friend didn't look too amazed by his bulgogi hash either, but he said it was decent. The bulgogi hash portion was definitely more on the smaller side compared to the benedict. \n\nFor a new brunch spot with interesting takes on breakfast food favorites, I would give this place a shot.

You can't even fart in public without getting the stank eye. We're all human, it happens!\n\nWhile some would have been offended to hear their server say something like this, I found it amusing. Well, awkwardly amusing but amusing nonetheless (it was a cultural thing and she was in no way malicious about it). Sometimes you just have to laugh it off.   \n\nMy friend, Mr. Diva is all about Asian Fusion cuisine so he wanted to try Fillmore Social Club, a Korean Fusion Restaurant that took over the old Gussie's location. Currently, in soft opening mode with a grand opening slated next month. Dinner only with weekend brunch in the next week or so (call to inquire). \n\nOn the menu are an array of appetizers like ssam, poki salad, tataki, and entrees like Korean bbq, soups, and stews (budae jjgae). Korean food is never cheap and the most expensive item is their Galbi for $25 so prices are fair and it's in line with most Korean restaurants in SF. No complimentary banchan. Beer, wine, and soju only. \n\nWhile perusing the menu, I ordered the create-your-own Soju Cocktail Flight: Miss Jo (multigrain powder, whipped cream), Yakurtzu (yogurt, lemon, sea grass), Cool Cucumber (cucumber, lemon): http://bit.ly/2BmXuum. They were all delicious, though a bit too sweet. The Miss Jo, the one with the roasted barley and brown rice powder was my favorite, followed by the tangy Yakurtzu which is like a boozy Yakult, and then the refreshing Cool Cucumber. \n\nWe had a hard time deciding on what to order because everything sounded great. Most of the Yelp pics were not captioned (*shakes fists*) so it was hard to tell what some dishes were. \n\nAfter some debate, we ordered the following: \n\n*Aji Fries: Deep fried spanish mackerel ($8): http://bit.ly/2G9i9Wk\nI thought this would be fish \"fries\" but it was just fried mackerel filets. I enjoyed the golden brown crispy exterior but Mr. Diva said, it was too fishy. I would skip this. \n\n*Kimchi ($3): http://bit.ly/2DyoNYH\nThe kimchi had a good balance of heat and acidity so I didn't mind paying for something that's usually complimentary. It's was better quality than most free kimchi I've had. \n\n*Yaki Udon: Stir-fried udon w/ beef ($14): http://bit.ly/2DwctUL\nIt was a generous portion of yaki udon but I was hoping for more caramelization like a chow mein and for the noodles to have more of a chewy, bouncy texture. This dish was just ok and more soupy than I would have preferred.\n\n*Half & Half KFC w/ gochujang, soy sauce, pickled radish ($18): http://bit.ly/2Dtj3LE\nGood frying technique producing a nice crunchy KFC exterior that held up well to the gochujang. I prefer my KFC on the plain side (I like being able to enjoy the crunchy batter and moist chicken on its own) so I liked the lightly savory sweet soy sauce flavored one better. \n\nI think they use chicken tenders for their KFC. It wasn't dry but I prefer dark meat with bones for maximum flavor and moistness. \n\n*Moe Galbi: LA cut short ribs, green onions, mashed potatoes, pineapple ($25): http://bit.ly/2BnDhop\nMy favorite dish of the night, the galbi was rich, meaty, and flavorful (not msg-y). It was nicely charred for that smoky piquancy. The shaved green onions made for a nice slaw and the pineapples for a refreshing sweetness. The mashed potatoes were a bit cold. \n\nThe staff is incredibly kind and very customer oriented. While I appreciate their attentiveness, it was awkward when some of the servers stood and stared at our table while eating (it was empty when we were there). Food service was timely and the Manager, who's super nice thanked us several times for visiting. \n\nFillmore Social Club has done a great job remodeling the old Gussie's place. It's hip and inviting with playful wall art. It's a HUGE space...we counted nearly 90-100 seats so it's great for large groups. I hope they consider adding some music to set the mood. We were one of two tables there so it was eerily quiet. \n\nOverall, pretty good soft opening and their food has potential. IMO, it's better than Foxsister (The Mission) and more wallet-friendly than Namu Gaji (The Mission) which have the same Korean Fusion concept. \n\nWith Fillmore 1300 and Yoshi's now closed, this street doesn't seem to get much foot traffic these days so I hope Fillmore Social Club gets more media attention and customers.\n\nHey, when you can't get a table at Bob's because you walked in a Saturday night with no reservations (!!!): http://bit.ly/2Dslazf, you can always come to Fillmore Social Club!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Yikes.\n\nThey also refilled pretty slow and took about 15 minutes for us to even get our first mimosa btw. \n\nThe food. I got the korean fried chicken and waffles. Yuck. The waffles were HARD. Don't think you're getting a fluffy warm waffle. The waffle was dry and had the texture of hard stale crackers. The chicken was also incredibly dry.

You'll see lots of familiar Korean staples on the menu--bibimbap, galbi, bulgogi, hot stone pots--but with a wrinkle that makes it unique. Items like chicken and waffles featuring Korean fried chicken instead of the usual Southern style, shakshuka which usually shows up on Middle Eastern menus, and wasabi musubi that's generally found in Hawaii dots the menu. So you can order traditional Korean fare, or spread your wings and try something not so typical--the choice is yours.

So much flavor in this dish! The fruit was well worth the extra $3 because it was a cup full of high quality fruit (blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, grapes, and oranges). My husband got the waffle and kfc and was pleased with his meal as well. Service was good. The price was right. Overall a great place for brunch!", "author": "Aubrey S."}

I very much favor Surisan that's located in North Beach for the same Asian fusion cuisine offered here. \n\nWe stopped by for dinner and ordered the Triple Layered Pork ($9) which was delicious, but came with only about 3 thin pieces of pork on a bed of green onions. We also had the Half & Half Korean Fried Chicken ($18) and the Moe Galbi ($25). The Korean Fried chicken was really tasty and had a lot of flavor, and came in large portions on top of some mixed lettuce. The Moe Galbi came out on a sizzling plate with grilled pineapples and green mashed potatoes. This was also average, but I've had comparable Galbi at places like Cocobang for a cheaper price. \n\nFor the price we paid, I don't think it lived up to expectations in comparison to Berkeley Social Club or Surisan, but the decor, vibe and feel is really great inside the location. I'd recommend stopping by if you have a big group of friends and are able to try more of their appealing appetizers.", "author": "My N."}

The dish comes with rice as a base instead of English muffins, and with the hollandaise it was amazing!  Something I definitely would want to recreate at home.  We also got the ssam tacos and a side of KFC.  The ssam tacos were way more ssam than taco, but pretty good.  KFC was more like chicken karaage, not really what I was expecting.  All in all though, the food was solid, and the coconut latte my friend had was delicious.\n\nOur server was so sweet, she kept reminding us to take our time because the place was very obviously not crowded.  They let us sit and enjoy our drinks and chat as long as we wanted.

Fillmore excels not just in the Korean area but also the fusion.  We had the kimchi fried rice off the Korean menu as well as the soft shell crab benedict.  Of course we also had to try a tender and the Millionaire bacon.  To begin, the bacon was great.  I was expecting a small piece based on reviews but was actually pleased when it came with two large pieces of thick, pepper-packed bacon.  Really great tasting and perfect in any brunch dish.  The tender was a little dry but better than most chicken pieces.  The kimchi fried rice very good and egg stayed cooking on the hot stone pot which is perfect.  Finally, the soft shell crab benedict was terrific.  Humongous soft shell crab that was actually tough to finish due to its size.  4 types of potatoes on side finished the dish off.  The soft shell crab was quickly recommended by the server and I 100% agree.  This dish is fantastic and one of the best brunch dishes I've had.  Truly fusion and truly a must stop.  Easy to get a seat even on a weekend and service was fast (even too fast) with food on the table within 15 minutes.  Bottomless mimosas on weekends on top of everything, for only $20, make Fillmore one of the best spots this part fo town.  Really a high quality brunch and well worth coming back.", "author": "Zachary A."}

I also found a lot of them to be on the salty side. The most underwhelming dish would have to be the Triple Layered pork, which were around 5-6 small slices of pork belly with ssamjang on top.

I could leave my review at that and you would probably be able to guess what this restaurant is like. \n\nFSC is a Korean influenced restaurant tucked on Eddy St. I rushed my boyfriend out the door to the restaurant at 11:30am on Sunday expecting a line, but it was actually fairly empty. We were seated quickly close to the hand painted mural and I got to observe the whole restaurant. It was well lit with a natural colorful wood vibe, reminding me of Hawaii. \n\nI ordered Chi Bang, which is Korean fried chicken served over rice in a cast iron skillet ($14) and my boyfriend got the soft shell crab Benedict ($18). My chicken was super flavorful, saucy, and crunchy and I got like 9 pieces of chicken! The skillet was coated with a sweet soy sauce before the rice was added so there was a wonderful sweet and crispy taste as I mixed up my rice. The crab Benedict was literally 2 whole crabs deep fried and placed on sourdough toast with eggs on top with a side of herbed mashed potatoes and salad (bf asked for hollandaise sauce on the side). \n\nLike all their restaurants, presentation was over the top beautiful and the food was delicious.

We each got the spicy ramen which wasn't too bad, but the the fries, rice cake, and sausage was a miss for me.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fries.  I wish the rice cakes were in my soup rather than fried.  I ended up putting the sausage in my ramen which went pretty well together, but if I had just had the trio, it would have been difficult to finish.  The spicy KFC was nothing special.  I personally liked that it was boneless because.  We got the millionaire's bacon as well which didn't blow my mind.  I've had several versions of millionaire's bacon dishes across SF and this one wasn't the best in the city.  Overall, it wasn't a home run of a dinner, but I am definitely willing to go back for brunch or lunch.", "author": "Lynne T."}

The atmosphere is the main thing that makes this place stand out. There really is a lot of work put in, even down to the small details. That same attention to detail is reflected in the food as well. The presentation is great, especially on the cocktails. Although the price was higher than other Korean restaurants, the ingredients were high quality and the portions were on the bigger side for the mains. They also offer lettuce wraps which go well with the Jae-yook! The dish called 'good choice' was also delicious but I wish it had more rice cakes in it, they seemed more like an after thought. The bulgogi ssam was a yummy appetizer but it is a big difficult to share the 3 pieces among four  people without it getting a bit messy. The sticks is a great appetizer to share with friends over some drinks. Their beer selection selection is curated and has a lot of rare beers not commonly seen elsewhere.\nOverall this place is great for hanging out with friends and getting a bite to eat. And its also good if you mainly want to drink with only a few appetizers to share. I love having this great new addition to the neighborhood!", "author": "Summer B."}

The cups and plates are made of glossy stainless steel. That felt cheap to me, and my date told me it made her think of prison.\n\nThe menu was very confusing to me, being mostly unfamiliar with Korean food. I would have appreciated advice from the waitress or the menu itself, since I don't think I made the most satisfying choice.\n\nWe settled the udon and the bulgogi, and sides of rice and kimchi. The udon was tasty and had an interesting texture, and I'd recommend trying it. The bulgogi came out as a literal pile of meat, which I assumed was meant to be shared, but it wasn't clear me when I ordered. It was good, but I felt pretty stupid eating a plate of beef with nothing else by myself. The rice ($2.5) and kimchi ($3) were very small portions for the price. The kimchi was not especially flavorful, and I wouldn't recommend ordering it. (It is also is served on an \"I-beam\" kind of plate, which made it very hard to eat from since it'd topple over if you tried to stab it with a fork. I don't understand that decision.)\n\nWe considered cocktails, but they were pretty expensive ($16 and up). They serve them in small glasses with a carafe, which I had never seen before. Maybe good for sharing.\n\nAlright service, clean space, trendy decor.\n\nOverall, I don't regret trying this place, but wouldn't recommend it. Maybe I lack an appreciation for Korean food, but if you're also the adventurous type, I think you can do better at this price point elsewhere in the city.", "author": "Ceasar B."}

I was super excited to try some of their drinks I saw pics of on yelp, especially the cotton candy soju drink. Unfortunately they were no longer serving it, or the soju flight I was also looking forward to. I settled on the matcha mojito. The drink was enjoyable, but cost $17 ! In my opinion, that's outrageous for one soju cocktail. All the drinks were pretty pricy, the Japanese lager was also $9 which is pretty steep for one beer. \nWe ordered a few different plates and shared them all. My favorite was the ssam, which are ribeye lettuce wraps. The jaeyook, Korean spicy pork was also good. We ordered a side of kimchi which was $3 for a small side was a little high also as most Korean restaurants will load you up on kimchi complementary. \nIt's a nice addition to the neighborhood but with these prices, I'm not sure I'll be returning.", "author": "brittany g."}

Keep it up!\n\nWent to FSC twice in the last week since I live in the neighborhood, once for dinner and once for brunch. Two different experiences.\n\nWe visited for dinner toward the end of their soft opening. Overall I'd say the food was pretty good but the service was chaotic. Servers were very nice but came off untrained. It took a while to get anyone's attention and they handled our request for a paced meal very awkwardly, bringing out a main dish before anything else then taking it back (to put under a heat lamp...) after we complained. We also noticed that they don't have a host up front, so some groups stood up front for 5-10 mins without being greeted. \n\nFor dinner we got the kimchi pancake, half & half KFC, galbi and bulgogi with soju cocktails. The galbi was overcooked and lacking in meat - at $25 it was the least \"worth it\" item we ordered. Kimchi pancake was very different than the traditional style - an umami junkie's dream overloaded with a layer of bonito flakes and Kewpie mayo on top. The KFC was definitely the standout dish of the meal though, and the half & half sauce is perfect.\n\nDuring our second experience we very much enjoyed some improved service and the interesting brunch menu. We had more of the KFC and I tried the Mr. Katsu plate which is a Korean take on the Japanese classic. The place was less crowded and our server was great.\n\nI hope this place gets some of the kinks out with its dinner service and puts some effort into getting the classic Korean BBQ dishes right. Overall though a really cool looking, funky restaurant with an upbeat vibe which can certainly become a go-to if it keeps trending up.", "author": "Narek A."}

Prices are average for SF brunch, with healthy portion sizes- most dishes could be split between two or more. \n\nWe ordered a mix of Korean and American dishes and liked it all. Waffles were crispy on the outside and chewy inside, Korean fried chicken was crisp and moist, and the soy glazed version (Chi bap) was a nice variation. The soft shell Benedict was beautifully plated, and a side of millionaire's bacon hit the spot. The chicken jook was the one dish that needed a little something. The broth was tasty, but somehow the rice and barely cooked veggies made it feel a little bland. This didn't stop me from eating the whole bowl. \n\nThe star might have been the corn flake crusted brioche French toast. This is a double French toast with an apple filling, maple syrup drizzle, and a mountain of mashed potato textured mascarpone garnished with fresh berries and a dehydrated orange slice on the side. Delicious and decadent. \n\nService was very friendly and efficient--the restaurant was quiet when we got there but filled up by the time we left--glad they seem to be doing well!

My wife had the soju cucumber cocktail. Way too sweet.  I splurged and had the Soju from the oldest Korean distillery. I can't remember the name but it was very good.", "author": "Robert L."}

I also order Waffle & KFC it came with spicy maples syrup i know sound weird but god! U got best of both world sweet & spicy at the same time. We also order Hangover Shakshuka its a tomato stew crispy bacon, spam, and crispy rice cake with a lil kick to it that will cure your hangover hence the name and lastly we order Hot Stone Pot it is to die for and if u want the server can mix it up for you it great! Fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice, they got great drink for brunch bottomless mimosas and bottomless cocktails wow! I know i know im an alcoholic 555. A day later i came back for dinner again great selection on appetizers and food knowing me we order lots of food the Grilled Scallops, Tako Wasabi, Mango Poki. The Moe Galbi here is the bomb the short ribs seem to just melt in your mouth, the Half & Half its good if u like fried chicken, The Shakshuka Backribs it a mountain of ribs and cheese no need to say nothing  else! Their list of drink its pretty good too if u just wanna come and chill and hang out they soju cocktails, beer on taps, nice selection of sake and soju all and all its my new favorite place to hang out the staff are very nice they treat u like family.  I give this place a 5 start its a lil place u can come back time and time again.", "author": "Paul P."}

The steamed eggs (got it with bacon and avocado) were wonderful, and the Breakfast Taco Ssam was delicious. Bacon was thick and perfectly cooked. Each plate came with a fresh salad and creamy spinach mashed potatoes. \nGood coffee, friendly staff, quick service, spacious dining room, nice interior. We'll be back for brunch (and to try dinner).", "author": "Nicole C."}

Such as its name - 'Social Club', you can share dishes with your friends and both of you will very full when you leaving. The decoration in restaurant full of artistic sense, so it is really good place to go with your friends. Service also friendly, and they very care about customers.", "author": "Noelle H."}

It's in an unexpected spot but the brunch is really good with a Korean twist. I had the chicken and waffles which was the perfect combo of sweet and savory.  I also tried the eggs Benedict which was a nice twist on a classic breakfast staple. The absolute best thing about eating here was that the food is delicious and there was no line to get in... a hidden secret in SF!", "author": "Julie B."}
