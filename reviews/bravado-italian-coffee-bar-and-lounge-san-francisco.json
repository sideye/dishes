Not \"cookie cutter\" at all, like the other famous \"S\" and \"P\" Coffee shops. I like it because the furniture is very \"European\" and classy, like the inside of a fancy Hotel, where they charge $5 for a hot chocolate, but not here!  Prices are excellent, and nothing like an overpriced hotel.  \n\nIt's like the \"quality\" of keeping an image of a fancy place, without the fancy place being attached to the business.  I think that differentiates if from most other coffee shops.\n\nI love how it's near AT and T Park, and never crowded!!!  Always a seat during Giants games.  \n\nGreat desserts and fancy coffee drinks and full service on creams and sugars too!!!!\n\nRECOMMENDED!!!!", "author": "William C."}

I also got a breakfast burrito which was pretty good sized and filled me up, but the filling was mostly egg, not a huge amount of sausage, and very little cheese and sauce (plus some decently grilled veggies). It was also smashed in a panini press which I'm never a fan of for burritos. If the prices were maybe 80% or 70% of what they actually are, this place would likely get another star from me.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I'm going to write them their well-deserved 5 star review. \n\n$11 \"Sunny Side Avocado\" (*substitute with scrambled eggs*, sliced avocado, black sesame seeds, chili flakes, and lemon zest on rustic sour dough): \nI am extremely shocked that not many people know about this place. I'm not kidding, they have the most *incredible* avo-toast, and this is coming from a somewhat avo-connoisseur who has tried nearly every shop that sells avo-toast in SF. It's not just the avocado itself that's good; it's the perfectly toasted bread, *extremely* fragrant eggs, and perfect combination of spices that make this item a piece of art. The scrambled eggs themselves are so perfectly fluffy that I can't help but wonder if there's a secret ingredient that's 10x better than butter.\n\nBeyond the amazing avo-toast, the friendly service and atmosphere/decor here is top notch. Most of the customers come alone to get some work done/enjoy a meal alone, but this would also be a great place to hang out with friends. Afterall, they do have a good selection of beer and wine (:\n\nAlso a huge plus - their breakfast menu (which of course includes the avo-toast) is now served on the weekends as a part of their brunch menu, and is offered from 11:00am-4:00pm!", "author": "Cindy L."}

Based on the Yelp pictures, it seemed like this place was gonna be similar to a more upscale cafe that reminded me a bit of Nespresso. Unfortunately, this place was very very different from Nespresso and much more similar to a regular cafe, just with fancy white chairs. The lighting here was a lot dimmer than I expected as well but at least they had a lot of variety of seating. \n\nWe went to the counter to order drinks and they have a long list of specialty drinks that they didn't have descriptions for so I had to ask them about what each of the drinks were. I think it'd be a lot more beneficial if they at least had a menu with all the descriptions, so it'd be easier to order. I ended up deciding to get the mokaccino which was like a mocha capuccino so it was more foamy than a mocha. My friend got the affogato. I have to say both were pretty yummy but definitely on the smaller side. The seating was comfy but the internet wasn't the most reliable. It was pretty empty on a Friday afternoon so space and quietness isn't a problem. They appear to serve alcohol too and that alcohol was a more popular option at this place.", "author": "Catherine S."}

I loved the neighborhood.\n\nThe staff was great at explaining what an undertow was, and the breakfast burrito was fucking incredible. The woman taking orders was nice, and the woman delivering them was as well - I was caught off guard that despite not giving me a number or explaining how to get my order, the other woman found me and delivered both the coffee and the food separately.\n\nNot too crowded, everyone (staff, patrons) looked well put together (which is noteworthy for anywhere in San Francisco). The whole experience felt rather upscale, which I can't decide is a good thing or odd. Either way this was one of the better cafe experiences I've had in this city, and I would absolutely come here again for just coffee, food, a place to catch up on work, or all of the above. The bathroom didn't require a key to get in, and was clean (also noteworthy for SF). Finally, the interior was a nice mix of bougie, and art. Does not feel like a corner neighborhood coffee shop, so if that's what you're looking for this is not it.\n\nI am a table queen when it comes to cafes to work at.

It's always nice to be greeted.  :)\n\nWe found some super comfy seats (leathery sofa-type seats) with a table and sat there for the next hour or so.  It was nice to sit and rest our feet somewhere quiet, after walking all day along the Embarcadero, AT&T Park, Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.  \n\nIt was also nice to have a power outlet near us, so we could charge our phones too.  During this time, we ordered a few items like the Italian soda, brownie, lemon bar, etc.  Everything was good.  We also were able to observe the employees waiting on customers.  We could tell these employees were great at making their customers feel welcomed.  They also asked my husband what brought us in, and encouraged us to stay as long as we needed.  \n\nThe only thing I'd improve on is having another restroom (right now they have one that is shared by all).

They were so accommodating, texted me 45 mins before and said our table was ready, asked if we we wanted to preorder and even emailed the menu over. Unfortunately, we were so busy with family pictures we didn't get to look at their menu before we got there.\n\nNonetheless, our server, Andy, was so genuine in being of service to our table. I was in awe. You don't get this kind of personable experience at restaurants and/or cafes anymore. But he was top notch. We bought two bottles of wine and a bottle of champagne and he poured all the glasses. Was so efficient in getting our food order and made it known that if we needed anything, to just ask and he meant it.\n\nThe lunch menu was nice and sweet. You have 1 page to choose from and it was simple. But man, the food was even better then the pictures. All the sandwiches had a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette and a side fruit. And each plate was $12?! I couldn't believe that! The food was beyond delicious. Try the turkey club and pastrami. They're big enough to share (sandwich cut in half) and you can go halfers w/someone and get a taste of different sandwiches. Back to my $12?! Yeah, the freshness, quality and taste was definitely worth more then $12. \n\nAnd just before leaving, I believe the owner (that he was the owner) told my sister in law to hold on and he handed her a bottle of wine and said it was on the house as a congratulatory gift.

Then, a tubberware with granola that is very clearly store bought and also has raisins. For the \"seasonal fruit\" he added a few slices of banana, a little bit of apple, and CRAISINS!

Well, sometimes, it's the person who makes it.  I was just here a couple of days ago and apparently, there's a new in house chef and maaaan he can make awesome sandwiches.  Whatever they gave me that day is still not on the menu since he just started and it was mouthwatering.  It's a sandwich using focaccia bread with cheese and I think salami and side salad with apples.... OMG really yummy.  it may sounds ordinary but I swear it was DELICIOUS.\nThe owner told me that they are changing their menus very very soon and I cannot wait  to try them all.\nFor drinks, here are my favorites:\n1. Cioabella Pistachio\n2. Gianduio\n3. Ciaobella\n\nAlso, the new teas they offer are great, organic and fresh and here are my favorites:\n1. Citron Ginger - I ordered this because I had a cough one day and this made me feel sooo much better.\n2. Genmaicha - I love love the smell of roasted rice.\n3. White Peony\n4. Wuyi Oolong\n\nI have yet to try everything else.\n\n\nOWNER & STAFF:  Guys, there's a new owner of this place and he's great.  I say that because one day ( one of the many days i go here) when I was hangin' out and doing some work, I noticed that he quietly had a quick meeting with his staff reminding them that the number one priority is 5 star customer service and making sure customers are always happy.  I also overheard him saying that to make sure observe what customers are like and what they normally look for and later on they can talk about it and hear everybody's suggestions on how to make this cafe an awesome place to go to.  I swear I didn't mean to eavesdrop but that was awesome to know.\n The staff our young and still learning so we cannot really expect waaaay too much.  Plus, the owner is new and revamping the cafe to a much better & warm place to go to.\n\n\nDECORS:  Obviously, I have been to this place more than once and i've seen the differences.  I met the new owner and he's great.  I say that because, he make sure he speaks to everybody who is hangin out in his cafe and asking for whatever they need to make them feel even more comfortable (refills?, lunch?, cookies?...) Anyhoo, if you see the place now, it is much better than the last decors.  You can  now see the balance of colors and not just all plain white that starting to hurt your eyes.  Have you seen the lightings?  please spare 5 seconds and look up to see how beautiful it is.  The owner said he handmade all of them.  OMG!!!!! very impressive.  The new paintings, mirrors, side tables and branches are beautiful extra touch that makes this place even more comfortable to hang out in.\n\n\nYES, I am a frequent customer of this place because I like the fact that the new owner remembers my name & tries to train young staff that they are not there to make the owner happy but the customers.\n\nI truly believe on letting the owner or store manager know when not happy about their certain products and believe me, most of them happily do everything they can to make up for it.  With us voicing our vices directly to the owner can help them know what they need to work on & it really works.\n\nI HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE so please come and visit.\n\nHappy eating.", "author": "Em L."}

That's my style, in a crowded place I look for the worst bar in sight, I found it. Unlike the truly nasty secret hideouts, like Sinbad's, which achieves its unpopular status through carpet mold and fear of food poisoning, Bravado scares you off with painful awkwardness, a cheerful sadness.\n\nThe place is sincere, kind, the staff (who appear to be the owners, or friends of them) are in a good mood. But nearly everything here was misguided and disjoint, from the beer selection to the interior decoration to the music selection. When I arrived they were playing \"Highway to the Danger Zone\", when I left it was \"We built this City on Rock and Roll\", scientifically proven to be the worst rock song of all time. Meanwhile, hapless out of town visitors were flopped out on the furniture lamenting their failure to score a baseball ticket.\n\nDespite a sandwich board promise of chicken wings and other savory snacks, there was none in sight, just a few leftover pastries from the morning. I can tell from the design that they're trying hard, just clueless about it (and I'm no design hero). there are uplights, flowers, all kinds of things. They have a really cool Italian light fixture hanging from the ceiling that won a bunch of design awards and you can buy on Design Within Reach for many hundreds of dollars I think. That would be nice, but they have a clutch of eight or ten of them arrayed inartfully next to each other, whic kills the mood. Interior decorating-wise, it's kind of like, one unicorn and one rainbow -- good. Ten unicorns in an overcrowded pen hiding in fear of the wrath of rainbow -- not so good.\n\nI think they need an Italian coffee intervention, at least based on the baseball game day offerings.

Usually it's NYC or LA who get dibs on this type of upscale cafe since those markets would appear to offer the ready-made Euro-centric customer base this place desperately needs to kick-start their business. I'm not sure the sparsely pedestrianized location offers any dependable customer base since business in these parts depends on whether the Giants are in town.\n\nJamie W. and I have tried it twice now, and both times, it was as still as a tomb in there. A few nearby residents appear to drop by but mostly to use the restroom since the plush white seats remain empty most of the time. Too bad since they have quite a menu of espresso-based drinks and desserts, but my guess is that people are not used to these types of Euro-based treats and take a pass in favor of more familiar selections at Starbucks or even Philz. I tried the $4.25 Yogurt Espresso Caramel, which was definitely a jolt of caffeine wrapped in a sweet caramel sauce (see photo).\n\nJamie went for the much lighter $4.50 Fraspuccio Caramel, which was like a icy-milky frappucino mixed with caramel sauce (see photo). Both were perfectly decent but not the sweet-tooth satisfyers either of us were looking for. I think I would have preferred having an ice cream float with a cup of espresso afterward, not a concoction that combined both. But others could be more open-minded than my taste buds would allow. Besides, the staff is friendly enough, and the seating comfortable enough for a good chat if you choose to stick around for an hour or two. That's what they do in Italy, so I hear.\n\nBEVERAGES - 3 stars...something sweet to keep you up all night\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...very Euro with white chairs and chunky block tables\nSERVICE - 3 stars...pretty nice all things considered\nTOTAL - 3 stars...hopefully it will find its footing as a neighborhood hangout for caffeine addicts", "author": "Ed U."}

The prices are through the roof, the service is mediocre at best, and I have NEVER gotten a decent cup of coffee.\n\nLast time that I stopped in here, all I wanted was a plain, iced coffee. It took 9 minutes and I missed my damned train. First, the \"barista\" had to figure out if there was any actual cold coffee in the fridge, then he had to decide if making an iced americano would suffice (it would, but get on with it already!)\n\nToday, I ran in for an iced mocha when I had 13 minutes to make the train. For my $5.50 (including tip) he handed me what looked like iced coffee with a thick layer of granulated, dry cocoa on top. I said, \"Really?\" He looked at me as if I had three heads. His co-worker shook the chocolate sauce container at him and called him a fool. Then, he tossed a bunch of that into a plastic cup, threw in a tiny bit of ice (which melted immediately into nothing when he added the espresso,) and topped it with a ton of milk. Ugh. I'm going to McDonald's for my neighborhood coffee needs on my way to the train from now on. It's actually BETTER and that isn't saying much.", "author": "Brandi V."}

Other than that I have absolutely no reason to come here.\n\nI've had lunch at Bravado 3 times.  Each time was a total disappointment, especially when I think of how much I paid.\n\nTheir pizzas have no finesse - for example, the pesto pizza I once ordered was absolutely drenched with pesto sauce (LOTS of oil dripped from each slice), and the fresh tomatoes on top looked like a 4 year old cut them with craft scissors.  I lost my appetite just looking at my plate.\n\nAnother time I tried ordering their panini formaggio at about 11:45am and they declared they had already run out of their panini bread.  Lame.  I went with their pizza again, which I hoped and prayed wouldn't be oily and kindergarten-like.  It was all of the above, and the side salad also looked cut up with craft scissors.  Don't these people have a real kitchen knife?\n\nThe drinks are ok - pretty expensive but much, much better than the food that's served.  \n\nThe service irks me the most.  The hipster guy who's usually there at lunch time always has a sour look on his face and just gives off a weird vibe.  The feeling I get when he takes my order and serves me my meal is off-putting and inexplicably strange, like I'm not cool enough for him.\n\nIn short, there are other places in the area to grab a quick lunch that's at least semi-appetizing and where I don't feel like I'm inconveniencing anyone.", "author": "Nina V."}

Am I wrong? I suppose only time will tell. But I do know this -- I'm a pretty big fan of what Caffe Pascucci is doing right across the street from the ballpark.\n\nIf you're bored of the same ol' coffee routine, I promise just a single trip to Pascucci will break you from the funk before your caffeinated selection even touches your lips. With literally hundreds of different and unique menu items to choose from, it's a wonder anyone comes to a conclusion on what to order at all! They have espresso drinks with real fruit, some with yogurt at the bottom of the glass, some with mountains of whipped cream and other fun dairy products, and much more. They're certainly marching to the beat of their own drum, and everything I've tried thus far has been a real treat.\n\nThey also serve a full menu of sandwiches, salads, paninis, desserts, soups, and the like... all from the minds of the crew at Fish + Farm and a few other local restaurant operations. While I've had a few misses, most of their fare is pretty on point. For something light, try the white bean and tuna salad. It's an Italian staple, apparently, and it's such a light and refreshing way to burn a meal at lunchtime.\n\nThey've now got their beer/wine license as well, so it makes for a fantastic, unsuspecting spot to pre-game before the Giants take the field right across King street. While it's nuts to butts at Momo's and Pedro's, it's usually pretty mellow here at Caffe Pascucci.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

They are both large retail chains with loads of branded products and icy drinks. Blended coffee drinks are in fashion nowadays in Italy, bringing a dessert element to business casual affairs. That's great, but it's not my thing really. I had samples of some of those icy mocha frasp thingy things and it only reminded me that I was not in junior high anymore. I gave it another shot when I recently ordered a fraspuccio meringato. It just didn't do it for me. It's too much ice and too much chocolate syrup.\n\nI am glad to have met the owner on one occasion, who personally got me a cappuccino, paspuccio, and a straight up espresso. And those were great. Maybe it was because the Italian superstar barista pulled them. I brought home a bag of their espresso beans and they were so dry.\n\nAside from their coffee creations, they now also serve wines and beers. The beer selection is not bad. Interestingly enough, they also do pitchers. For a trendy, stylish looking place like this that serves fancy pant coffee drinks, it gets pretty packed on a game day.

She told me it had started in Rimini (or perhaps she said someplace very near to there), and it was thus a point of pride for them. We went to get coffee, and I was introduced to a huge menu of specialty espresso dessert drinks.\n\nThe cafe was Caffe' Pascucci.\n\nA few months after I returned to America, I Googled the cafe on a whim and discovered that it had one location in the United States, opened in 2011, and that it was located near AT&T Park in San Francisco. I freaked out and probably dropped my iPhone on my face.\n\n(I was in bed at the time.)\n\nSF's Caffe' Pascucci has since rebranded itself as Bravado, though they still serve the same namesake brand of coffee.

It wasn't too sweet, just sweet enough. This is surprising to me because the drink itself looks as though one sip would cause all of your teeth to instantaneously rot and fall out of your mouth.

Unfortunately many of the cafes/restaurants in South Beach have very limited operating hours and are geared towards very high-end customers or GIANTS fans from the suburbs. \n\nI have struggled for a long time to find a place where I can do work that's comfortable, not too noisy, but not dead either. Most cafes in San Francisco are extremely crammed and blast loud music. This place, while a little different from the traditional cozy American cafe atmosphere, is extremely comfortable to be in and there's a lot of space. The outdoor patio is wonderful.\n\nFree WiFi, not to mention the coffee! OMG...what the hell are we drinking here in the US?

First they were out of whipped cream for the cocoa, then they were out of bacon for the BLT. I swapped my order for a panini and paid. We waited 15 minutes, and then they claimed they were out of cheese for the panini. We asked for a refund, and they handed back out coupon, but not the $3 change.

They were out of cinnamon syrup for the hot cocoa, no big deal. The pizza was one of those sad little pizzas you might get from a bowling alley or roller skating rink; tiny, tasteless, and obviously pre-frozen. The BLT had a ton of letture, a ton of heirloom tomatoes, and the two smallest, most shriveled pieces of bacon I have ever seen. This is on top of the fact that even though they had two entrances, they kept one locked with a \"closed\" sign, and signaled us to go through the far entrance, for no apparent reason. An hour later they unlocked the entrance, but still had the \"closed\" sign up. The chocolate was good, if you like the thick melted chocolate kind, which I do, but this was hardly a redeeming quality at this point. \n\nThe saddest part is that we *really* wanted to like this place.

My friend got the gianduio which is a cappuccino with nutella and I got a ciaobella which is a cappuccino with pistachio sauce. For a 4 dollar coffee drink I expect it to be really good. For a coffee lover like me I think the drink is too milky/ watery. Not enough coffee. I wouldn't come back to get the drinks. \n\nA plus is that thru have free wifi, cute interior with plushy chairs, and it's close to the cal train.", "author": "connie h."}

We had ordered from another sandwich place nearby, but they were closed for lunch that week and the receptionist took it upon herself to find another location.  I don't blame her because she wasn't aware and I couldn't believe it when she told me that the other place was not serving lunch.\n\nAnyway, just as before, I was presented with one of the most sub-par sandwiches the world has known.  The bread used was dry and tasted as though its best days were far behind it.  This can be made up for if there some sort of condiment or spread.  There actually was something, but it was in such miniscule amounts I could not make out exactly what the spread was.  At first I thought it may have been moisture from the lettuce, but it did have some type of flavor that could have been good if they had taken the time to use more than an extremely light dusting of said substance.  But as before, the worst offense when it comes to the sandwich is the meat to lettuce ratio.  In this case it was roast beef.  I don't understand how they can make the sandwich, cut it in half, and see that the amount of meat displayed in the sandwich is dwarfed by the lettuce.  I'm not talking about all the greens, JUST THE LETTUCE.  The worst part is I believe the number of roast beef slices was equal to the number of lettuce leaves.\n\nAs soon as I opened up the sandwich, I knew it was from this place based on the (ahem...) craftsmenship of the food.\n\nIn addition, the salad that came with it I believe was supposed to be topped with a tangy vinaigrette.  However, the couple of dozen leafy greens were topped with a dressing akin to sour patch kids without the accompanying sweet flavor at the end.\n\nI knew that I would never want to come back to this place, but sometimes a place can get better after a time, especially when it is new.  However, this place seems content serving their interpretations of meat sandwiches and I suppose there are people who enjoy it.  But I will not be one of those people and if you enjoy a hearty sandwich I would recommend you stay away and go to the sandwich shop in the nearby alley instead.\n\nThis place does claim one honor, though, as the only place in our office we have listed as a restaurant not to order lunch.", "author": "Hitomi N."}

They specialize in drinks that are creamy and sugary which taste fantastic, but on the other hand, mask the fragrant coffee flavor.  \n\nThe red and white decor is very modern and chic.  Reminds me of fancy-pants cafes in metropolitan cities like Shanghai that charges an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee, so that dressed up young women can meet their dates or girl friends for a chat in a trendy environment.  However, here in SF, I see a multitude of patrons sipping on their various drinks and nibbling on salads/sandwiches.  Many look like they work in that neighborhood and were here to chat about work or grab a late lunch. \n\nThe service is friendly and efficient; staff to customer ratio admirable.\n\nWe liked the Gianduio, one of their most popular drinks, and Fraspucio Confuso, which is like a fancier frappucino.   Salciendo was a bit too bitter.  Not the good kind of coffee bitter, but the \"can we pour some sugar and cream on it to mask the bitter\" bitter. \n\nAll in all, a good place for people with a sweet tooth in need of a strong dosage of caffeine.", "author": "Candice B."}

I've been here several more times and at the moment:\n** bad espresso. burnt 50% of the time.\n** still i'm impressed with the quality of the service. \n** no more candy... and really that was an allure... \nall in all, i'm not impressed. not in the least. \n\n\n2nd day open and obviously off to a great start...\n\nSo I came in. Had my usual problem of not knowing what I want. Everything looked so good - especially the Tiramisu (it's a good thing that the actual food isn't showcased or I would have had to fight off the urge to have a 3rd lunch). Then I saw the yogurt on the menu which brought on the consequence of ordering an Americano and a Yogurt Cappuccino. \n\nTurns out I mistook the latter for yogurt instead of a coffee drink. When I found that out the person in charge offered to refund me... (I am slightly less impressed by that now, as I am posting this: I just found out that as a first-week visitor I could have had the pleasure of a free drink had I known the secret password. Oh well...)\n\nSo the bottom line:\n** excellent espresso\n** excellent understanding of how to handle customers (repeat the comment in the parenthesis on top)\n** fantastic chocolate (and coffee) candy on the counter\n** handsome looking Yogurt Cappuccino drink\n\nJust one thing would make the experience perfect: WIFI and outlets. The former is expected, but still missing, whereas the latter are no where to be found. (To prove how I like this place: I am using what little battery I have on writing this review instead of working frantically).\n\nAlso, I can't say I admire the d\u00e9cor, but I guess it is just a matter of taste. Definitely it isn't disturbing enough so I will keep myself from their beautiful espressos. And another info bit is that their pastries are from cafe madeleine and not their own creation.

One advice to management: put up the menu where it's easily seen. Thanks to yelp, I already knew I wanted to try the gianduio. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to get since there's no menu to be seen. Worse, the employees themselves didn't even know what I ordered! The barista serving me thought the \"gianduio\" I asked for was one of the teas they offer. Later, the other server informed the barista that my drink was the nutella latte. Really though? What's the point of naming your drinks when you don't even know what they are?\n\nOn the plus side, my \"nutella latte\" was pretty good. I actually tasted coffee, rather than the supposed espresso-based drinks from Starbucks that just taste like milk to me. \n\nI will probably still come back to this cafe just to try each of the specialty drinks that they have.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-29", "description": "Pascucci is an interesting place.  I came in here with my coworkers based on our boss' recommendation.  Most of our group ordered one of the very dessert-oriented Con Panna variations (yogurt, bananas, etc, etc) but I opted to stick with my most typical coffee drink, a macchiato, so I could make a clear evaluation of the coffee quality in comparison to other coffee staples in the area: Cento, Epicenter, Mavelous, Sightglass, etc.\n\nSince the place had a very Italian vibe I asked whether the shots were more ristretto or lungo.  I was told they were ristretto.  Cool.  Drink was served up but wasn't a macchiato - it was just espresso.  I was a little confused and didn't want to take someone else's drink, so I paused for a bit and then asked whether it was mine.  It was, but I mentioned I ordered a macchiato.  The barista scooped some extra milk out on top of the now dieing espresso.  Hrm.  \n\nTried it.  Milk texture was not so great and the flavor wasn't very sweet.  The espresso itself was balanced and inoffensive.  None of the acrid, burnt flavor you'll find in Peets or Starbucks but it didn't have any high or low notes to speak of, nor was it complex.  \n\nWe ended up with an extra \"Confuso\" dessert drink, so I tried that too.  It was actually pretty good with a really well matched sweetened yogurt that met the espresso nicely.  Seems to me they chose their espresso mostly to work in more elaborate drinks.\n\nTalked a bit with the owner.  Tried to get a sense for the origin of the beans.  Was told they were from Italy but he wouldn't say from where they originated.  Was a pleasant fella, though, and seemed genuinely into it.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty swanky with white leather walls, mirrors, and snazzy bucket chairs.  It'd be a great place to meet a business contact you want to impress.\n\nI'd give it a C+.  Better than average with some creative coffee desert drinks.  It's a chain and it shows - I think it's sorta Starbucks Plus, a definite improvement on so-called 'second wave' coffee trends.  If you like your caramel mochas this would be a great destination but purist coffee geeks will want to stick with the numerous highend 'third wave' shops that are available in San Francisco.", "author": "Dan C."}

It helps that they have pictures of the drinks because everything has stylish italian names to them. The best if the cold fraspuccio banana drink- it comes in a nice wine glass but such a great dessert drink with bananas, whipped cream, and espresso- a great anytime drink that it'll make you feel happy. I also like their fraspuccio pistachio second to this.\n\nFor the hot beverages, I love how they look from the top with the foam and drizzlings....it looks like a work of art. Of the cappucino beverages, I loved the rich paspuccio and the cappucino argentino which is cappucino with dulce de leche sauce, and both look great too. For the espresso drinks, I like the mokaccino with caramel and the chocolate one that I don't remember the name.\n\nThe tea is ok, just not anything out of the ordinary or maybe just the one I tried. I have seen some people get cool ones in a tea press.\n\nThe best dessert is the fruit tart with dulce de leche, its almost healthy ;) I usually get one of their muffins for breakfast and they warm it for you which makes a little extra touch.\n\nThe decor is very clean and trendy. Everything is white, red, and blue. They have wi-fi and the music isn't super loud like Starbucks so its great to bring your laptop and get some work done or also trendy spot to meet a friend for happy hour.\n\nI wish they were opened later to be able to come after dinner for dessert and coffee with friends but I guess that is SOMA for you. Still my favorite!", "author": "Sheena S."}

And when I say the \"best thing\" I don't mean the best thing about Caffe Pascucci, I mean the best thing, ever, about anything.  Yeah, sure, I know some people will say that sex or love or God or something is the best thing; those people apparently have not yet had Caffe Pascucci's hot chocolate.\n\nFor one thing, it's hot CHOCOLATE.  It's not cocoa powder and hot water, or even cocoa powder and hot milk.  I think they just take Godiva bars and just nuke them in the microwave until they melt.  It's indescribably wonderful.  I wish I had one now.\n\nThe food is also really good.  The menu, which changes frequently, is surprisingly sophisticated, some kind of French/fusion-y idea.  A lot of the entrees sound like the stuff you'd order if you were trying to impress your date with what a suave guy you are, but like I said, it also tastes really good, so go ahead and have the duck.  There's also one or two assorted hors d'oevre plates, which are great if you are going to settle in for the evening and hang out and nosh.\n\nI go on Friday nights, when they usually have jazz-ish live music.  I'm only a middling jazz fan myself, but Pascucci is set up well: it's a long narrow room with the band at one end.  The huge jazz fans can sit way up front in the musicians' laps; people like me can sit a ways back where we can hear the music but also talk to our dining companions, and if you're just there for the food, you can see way at the back and it's just background muzak.\n\nIt's open during the day, and it's right across from the ballpark, for better or worse.  I wonder what it's like right after a game, but haven't checked it out yet.\n\nNB: Caffe Pascucci is changing its name to \"Bravado\".  Apparently, there's some other cafe named Pascucci somewhere else in California.  You'd think they would have checked that before they bought the sign, but Bravado is a better name anyway.", "author": "Michael L."}

I was hoping for a good strong espresso drink (got a Latte Macchiato) but what I got was far from it.  It tasted like flavored milk. The espresso coloring was all wrong. Light and not a dark brown. I usually go to coffee shops for espresso drinks and not dessert coffee drinks like frappaucinos.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't notice if they use an automatic espresso machine, in which case, I would have fled out the door asap. If this is truly an Italian coffee shop, shouldn't they use traditional espresso machines. (like a La Marzocco, hint hint) I didn't recall hearing any coffee grinding or tamping. Only the sound of steaming milk. \n\nAlso, the drinks are not cheap. Prices generally range around $4. Even tea is almost $3.  \n\nThe one plus side is the service, the Baristas were nice and helpful. This is only the first week and I noticed the amount of people squatting  and camping out at the tables with their laptops. Annoying.  Although there's a fair amount of seating there but still...\n\nIt's nice to have the commercial area develop around the ballpark after so many years of vacant retail space.

Having heard that Caffe Pascucci was a very successful coffee joint in Europe, I wanted to go to their first US outpost and try it for myself. We got the Hot dark chocolate con Panna and hot chocolate confuso with a shot of espresso. It was obvious the employees were still being trained because the cashier showed us the size of the cup that our drinks were suppose to be in and we got our drinks in a smaller cup. The thing I love about Italian hot chocolate is that its thick, rich, and very chocolatey. Caffe Pascucci's was no different. So rich that the DP couldn't finish it. They don't have mochas at Pascucci's, so I had to improvise with the hot chocolate confuso and added a shot of expresso. It wouldn't have been bad if the cup size was the size that the cashier showed us, but the expresso basically overpowered the drink. After the DP couldn't finish hers, she just poured hers into mine making it much better. Overall, not a bad place. The decor is very Euro-Modern and would be a nice place to just sit and hang out since it's across from AT&T Park.

We really wanted an Affogato as it was a new drink to introduce to my Swedish visitor.   We asked Lee if we could go buy some ice cream because they had run out for the night and bring it back, and he accommodated our request.

Nice for a first date or to meet a VC at for your pitch. It does not get too loud because it is spacious.  I heard they have a wine bar and will do night life events so I can't wait to see what they will put on.  I think taking my almost teen nephews and nieces here for their bdays would be a treat simply because of all the FESTIVE looking deserts...", "author": "Humbee P."}

I have waited for my mixed fruit yogurt cappuccino for 30 min. before I went to counter and asked what happened. Their answer was: \"The order did not pop up in the screen!\" and of course no apologies! I have waited for another 15 min. before they delivered my order. As another reviewer said they really don't know what they are doing which results in very disappointing customer service!", "author": "E E."}

They have a lovely setup inside, and the cappuccino was delicious. The employees were friendly and eager to help me, and they also explained some of the foreign menu items to me. I will definitely go back. I hope this place becomes a haven for good coffee and good conversation, and is not taken over by laptop culture.", "author": "Evan W."}

I went for the live music concert last Friday and was very satsified in all aspects of the night. From the friendly and attentive staff, to the great music, to the delicious Italian coffee, I was very impressed. They had a wonderful selection of beer and wine and their food looked delicious as well. My apple pastry was to die for and I'm excited to go back, probably before the next game I go to since it's located right across the street from the ballpark!", "author": "Jacqueline E."}

The coffee is a lot better than in Starbucks and the overall atmosphere is very inviting and enjoyable. I tried their hot chocolate last time and caramel freddo this time, both were so good. Oh, and the panini... is just amazing. I ordered the one with cheese and dried figs second time today and it was super good. Definitely coming back!!!", "author": "Diana M."}

Coffee is good strong Italian coffee like I'm used to. Got a cappuccino which was PERFECT in taste and texture. Atmosphere is modern and cute.  Went back for lunch and my panini was really tasty. Also, its open SUNDAYS. Woo Hoo! I can see myself going here during my regular Sunday afternoon strolls.", "author": "J C."}
