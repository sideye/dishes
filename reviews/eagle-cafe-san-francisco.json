While our waiter was very nice, he wasn't great. But fine. Just feed us. \n\nMy salmon dish came a full 5 minutes before anyone else's did. When I mentioned it to the waiter he was like, oh sorry, but when we looked around we realized it was happening at every table. \n\nOn top of my salmon already being cold when it came out, and even colder when I finally was able to eat it with my family, it was hard and tough and flat. I needed a knife to cut it. I mean, who cuts salmon with a knife? It was paper thin and tough. It literally tasted like jerky. \n\nAdding insult to injury, i paid the extra $2.75 to replace the mashed potatoes with veggies. Not double veggies, just replace it with, because apparently you don't get a carb and a veggie with your meal. It's one or the other. So I pay the extra $2.75 and it's the sorriest side of veggies I have ever seen with only 1 piece of broccoli! It's was horrible. \n\nWhen my family's food finally arrived, it was warmer than mine but all over seasoned and very mediocre. \n\nFor 4 of us, without alcohol, the meal was $150 (before tip). I don't mind spending $150 on a decent meal, but this horrible. Borderline fast food and definitely not worth the price tag. \n\nMy advice is to wait for a table at Fog Harbor.", "author": "Alexis M."}

The remodel is nice but unfortunately the entrees weren't. All the other surrounding restaurants had like so we decided to go to this restaurant which was pretty empty which now I understand why. Outside the clams that were delicious the rest of the entrees were bland. The lobster cocktail was less than I expected and it looked like the scoop some lobster meat on a ice filled glass, the fried calamari was tasteless and too much breading, and the main entree, the stuff shrimp was soaked in a bed butter along with the rice was mushy. Hopefully the owners will adjust and realize the reason why they are not getting lines waiting outside like their neighboring restaurants.", "author": "Ken L."}

They do not honor their \"validation services\" if your bill is less than $20, sometimes. I came in on a Saturday at 5 for a quick snack with 3 before actual dinner with other friends, but I wanted to get one of my friends ticket validated first so she could leave. \n\nFrom the instant the bartender greeted us, I felt as if he was condescending. He asked us what we were having tonight & we said just water, we wanted something quick. He did not crack a smile and just put away the coasters and looked at us silently as if saying \"ok, so if you're not ordering drinks what are you having\". We just sat at the bar cause there was a full house & did not want to sit outside. I ordered my chowder & then asked if I could get the ticket validated but got turned down for \"ordering too little\". I'm sorry, does it say somewhere that I needed a minimum order amount? Nah, he was just being rude. \n\nLet me just say, I've had this same exact order on the floor before with a server & i still got my ticket validated-- no sorry excuses. Their clam chowder isn't anything to run home about, either. It's comparable or even lackluster to the clam chowder stands outside of the wharf. \n\n...soo, ultimately I felt that we were treated that way because our poor little bill would affect his tips.", "author": "Ada W."}

We had a crappy experience sitting at the bar- bartender was more into talking to his buddies (and seemed really into himself) than helping customers.. wore one glove on his left hand while he was cutting fruit, then using it to touch his cellphone, then cutting fruit again. We were going to order a full meal but service sucked so we decided against it. Never got anything without asking.. he dropped the menus off and never asked us what we wanted to drink, then we sat there with the menus for literally 20mins until we finally called him back over to ask if we could order. It was a warm day and I finished my water but he never paid enough attention to us again to get a refill, as well as place settings. We shared the crab cocktail (it was meh) both of us taking turns eating off the tiny picking fork and no napkins. Sucked. His back was to us most of the time as he talked to other people or watched football. We were only 1 of 2 parties at the bar, so I can't even give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was busy. We are easy going customers (my husband being a bartender himself) and we always tip well regardless, but we couldn't wait to leave and go somewhere else. They could have made 3x the money off us than they did due to poor service and inattention. It was early November on a Saturday around 2pm.", "author": "Kiran L."}

I hate touristy areas with a passion. Fortunately, we went on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't crowded at all. In fact, I was the only person in the whole restaurant, so it was a little eerie. I guess I should be careful what I ask for.\n\nThe wait staff was super attentive and courteous while I was waiting at our table, even though they were probably bored out of their minds. In the meantime, I got a Bloody Mary which was quite delicious. Not as spicy or flavorful as I like, but still decent. \n\nWhen my boss arrived, I asked what's good on the menu because he's been here before. And oh my goodness, the Lobster Bisque Bread Bowl recommendation was phenomenal. I'm not usually a fan of bisque, and I was close to erring on the side of a seafood pasta, but I'm glad he steered me in the right direction. \n\nAs much as I dislike the tourist scene, I would actually come here again, partly because of the Lobster Bisque and partly because it's such a great place for large groups.

The original place we wanted to go was crowded and we were starving so we headed up to the second floor of pier 39 to find something to eat. This place didn't have a line and we got in as soon as we told them the size of our party. We looked at the menu it's pretty small, but not bad looking. The price was also reasonable. I ordered a hamburger, mixed grilled seafood, and a bowl of clam chowder in a bread bowl. The eagle bacon American burger was amazing especially medium rare. Their side of French fries was awesome as well. My mom really enjoyed their mixed grilled seafood which consisted of grilled salmon, tilapia, mahi mahi, and shrimp. The clam chowder was pretty good, but the bread bowl was cold  if it was heated up a little bit I think it would have tasted amazing because the coldness of the bread made the clam chowder cooler than it should have been, but otherwise everything was great. The waiter was busy checking up on his other tables and it was understandable that he's busy, but we only talked to him three times. Other then when we first met him and him bringing out our orders he never checked up on us. I actually had to ask him for our check and box to go  I made eye contact with him, but maybe he was looking somewhere else.

We ate here just for the ability to sit outside in the beautiful weather and look out over the water while we ate. It was a magnificent atmosphere! Inside is also nicely decorated and has a decent amount of seating for small groups. Outside seating is very limited bar style so it's mainly good for one or two person parties. There is only one gender neutral restroom so you may have to travel outside the restaurant to use the restroom, or wait for awhile. \nThe service was friendly and we were able to order quickly, but afterwards service was slower. Their menu isn't very large but it has good variety, although it would be tough to navigate as a vegetarian. The brunch menu consists of omelets, sweets, and fish specials. We each got an omelet and were happy with both the taste and portion size! For lunch I had a burger and my husband enjoyed a half crab at a good market value. Again, the taste was good. The burger and omelets seemed a little over priced, but that's to be expected based on the location.", "author": "Katie D."}

First off, although the food was pretty great, they were way overpriced. However, the service left much to be desired. The servers were not willing to split bills in more than 2 ways and when we paid, the waiter refused to split the check personally, only equally, because it would \"be easier for me\". Then, the waiters did not even have the intellectual knowledge to swipe 2 cards through the machine. 15 minutes later, they decided to just have us sign the check before charging it since we had to leave which seemed really sketch. I'm worried that they're going to overcharge me after I'm gone and wouldn't even know. Overall just a very sketchy place. I would not recommend at all.", "author": "Brandon C."}

It was a pretty chilly day in SF so the chowder really hit the spot and warmed us up real quick.    \nAlso, it actually my first time having soup in a bread bowl and I must say, I am definitely a fan. I was surprised to see how well the bread bowl holds up as I expected it to get a bit messy with soup spilling out but not at all!\n\nOne dozen oysters will cost you ~$25 which isnt too bad at all compared to the other spots around this area.  The oysters were from Virigina and W O W--I was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly fresh they were!  No fishy aftertaste or sand/rocks left in your mouth afterwards.  One dozen was definitely not enough because I was left wanting more after the last oyster.\n\nThe pasta came out last and it was the finishing touch to our meal.  The pasta was very light but very flavorful as it was sauteed in garlic, basil and light tomato sauce.  I was pleased with the amount of salmon in my pasta as well as the diced up sauteed tomatoes as well.\n\nI really would not mind coming back to dine here again the future.

But think twice before walking in. Wait was only 5 minutes, we got a table right across the serving station. Ordering time was also good as well as the service time but to sell the tables faster and make more money at the end of the day, they lack the hygiene of the food and that is why I ended up finding a piece of paper in sauce of my shrimp dish.\n\nDish itself was okay, too much garlic for me though. My husband's burger seemed so so. Considering these are touristy places, one should lower the expectations but next door seemed better even we have not tried. \n\nInterior is cute, you may enjoy drinks by the window with appetizers.

Their Bloody Mary mix is one of the best, but they tend to add a lot of vodka so it's pretty strong. Recommend that you share this deliciousness with someone. I also ordered a mango mimosa, because why not? \n\nFor a Holiday, it wasn't packed as compared to the day we went on a random day. Menu is simple and offers the basic. We were feeling like hungry sharks so we ordered their special seafood platter ($120). \n\nSeafood platter consisted of:\n- 2 dozen oysters\n- 1 dozen clams\n- 1 dozen big juicy cocktail shrimp\n- 1 whole dungeness crab \n\nAs we've had their oysters here before and they were pretty legit, we weren't worried about them being crappy. \n\nPresentation was nice and huge! They put everything except for the crab on a big ice plate. We've never had their clams or shrimp before so we were in for a treat. Clams were tasty and with a touch of chewy tenderness that gave it a great texture. I think the clams won the battle over the oysters. However, the shrimp was the champion. Like the menu described, it was really juicy. We finally finished the plate and called our server to know to bring out the crab.\n\nBy the time the crab came, we both had a huge cholesterol rush. Heads feeling woozy, but not sure if it was really all that seafood or because of the tequila shot we had after. So one big disappointment of the crab was how they completely \"dish-washed\" clean the inside of the crab. All that yellow-gold goodiness was gone. For us, that's one of the best parts we look forward to in a crab. Otherwise, meat was on point. Easy to crack open. \n\nOur staff and service was great and paired well with a nice view.

I did spend some time enjoying my drink and the view after I was done eating. I never felt pressure to leave by the server once he took my plate away, which I liked. \n\nService here was fast and efficient the day I came in, which I really liked! My server also automatically gave me 10% off since he saw me check-in on Yelp (how awesome!). I like how attentive he was!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here at Eagle Cafe.

Mgmt and staff failed to address a rowdy customer who interrupted the entire restaurant and upset my table, sitting not 6 feet away. My son and his wife, who I'm in town visiting with my mother, became upset enough to leave the restaurant, even as our food was just arriving at the table. I had to address the man and his party because mgmt and staff didn't. That is horrendous service and needless to say, my family and I will not return. Unacceptable for an establishment in such a high traffic tourist area to not have an adequate plan of action to address that kind of situation. And quite sad that management did not bother to address my mother or I, despite witnessing the behavior from the other table and the discomfort caused to my party until after I paid and addressed the manager directly. \"I was going to come over to talk to you\" is ineffective and disrespectful after you've walked by and around my table after witnessing all of this and said nothing prior. And by the way, the least that could have been done was an offer of a discounted meal for bad experience. Perform better for future customers because it won't be any of us.", "author": "RN R."}

We stopped by Hard Rock however, the wait was about 20 minutes so I did what every impatient person does: improvise! \n\nThere were spots by the window, all stool seatings. We asked to be seated at an actual table. They warned us that it will be extremely cold since the door to their outdoor patio is right next to the table but we were stubborn, unfortunately and demanded to be seated there. \n\nMy dad and sister got the burger, my daughter the pasta dish from the kid's menu and a vanilla milkshake, and I got a BLT. Hell, I had a BLT the previous night, I recall. \n\nThe orders took quite some time to get to the table. My only gripe was that the dishes that came out were all staggered; the burgers came first then about 10 minutes later, the pasta, then the BLT after what appeared to be a decade. \n\nMy BLT was delicious. The bread was toasted just right, the lettuce were fresh and cool, the bacon was semi crunchy, and the tomatoes made the sandwich the right texture: soft and crunchy. The side salad I opted for instead of the fries were great as well. \n\nNo complaints about the burgers and the kid's pasta was subpar. The vanilla shake was creamy and rich... I would never have allowed the shake to be ordered since the entrees were all pretty hefty... \n\nPrices are average for a tourists' spot.

We were highly indecisive as to where we wanted to eat, but, out of desparation, we finally settled on the Eagle Cafe at Pier 39.\n\nWe arrived late morning and found that it wasn't that busy. We were promptly seated, provided coffee, and given menus to peruse. The first thing that struck me about the menu was that the prices were shockingly  high. This was the first opportunity I had to have breakfast in San Francisco, so I'm not sure if that's the standard in the city, or if it's just because we were likely in a tourist zone. Needless to say, I was surprised, to say the least.\n\nI opted for scrambled eggs, hash and potatoes. My travel companion selected pancakes that came with eggs, sausage and potatoes. Both of our breakfasts came with unconventional, large hamburger buns that functioned as toast. That was certainly a new one for me. Maybe they ran out of regular bread slices and, instead, decided to get rid of the extra hamburger buns they had on hand? I have no idea, and it didn't really matter to me. There was nothing wrong with my breakfast. It tasted good. It fulfilled its purpose. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it, though. \n\nThe coffee was good, nice and strong. Loved it. \n\nWhile everything was decent, I couldn't help but feel we could have done better. Not being a local, I suspect we fell victim to our ignorance as tourists.

We knew going in that the area was a tourist trap, but the views of the bay are great, and it's a convenient jumping-off point for the other attractions in town. Still after travelling all night to get there, we didn't feel like venturing too far for dinner, so we looked for some seafood on the wharf. One place with good Yelp ratings we found had a 45 minute wait and no room at the bar. Next door was this place, less highly rated and only a few minutes wait, so we opted for this. That must happen a lot.\n\nWe had a couple of things we liked, and a couple of WTF moments that added up to a two-star experience. The space is quite nice and the views are wonderful. We were seated next to the door leading to the balcony outside, so we were subjected to lots of foot traffic around us. That wasn't a problem though. \n\nOur food was hit and miss. DLW had a nice side salad and clam chowder in a bread bowl. Sourdough bread is one of her favorite things in life, and the bread bowl was her favorite part of the dish. The chowder was decent, but the potatoes were unevenly cooked, with some soft and some still crunchy. My grilled shrimp and mashed potatoes were cooked well and well seasoned. Some might think the pepper was too strong, but I love pepper so I was fine. They served fried spaghetti strands with our entrees, a strange idea but one we actually liked.\n\nThen DLW needed to use the lav. Not only is there a single unisex bathroom for the whole 100 seat restaurant, the toilet had apparently malfunctioned and wouldn't flush, not surprising seeing how heavily it must be used. No one on the staff seemed very concerned about it either, like it happens all the time. If a health inspector ever showed up at an inopportune moment, it could be a disaster.  \n\nWe knew we were in for a touristy experience when we walked in the door.

The dungeness crab egg benedict was so good! The crab mixed so well with the tomatoes and the spinach they included in the dish and it didn't taste fishy like other places I've tried. I'm not sure if they seasoned the crab at all but it was very flavorful. You might think that it's a bit salty if you eat the crab alone but when you combine it with the tomatoes, spinach, and muffin, it's perfect. The plate comes with potatoes and those were good, I've had better but  they were well seasoned. Maybe if the outsides were crispy?! \n\nSteak and Eggs (4/4.5 stars)\nWhen I think of steak and eggs I think of Vegas. When you go to Vegas the steak is usually this super thin piece of meat that's cooked well-done but for the price of $3.99 you can't complain. Here, they give you a real piece of steak and they cooked it perfectly medium-rare. I was impressed. It was almost like eating dinner for breakfast. Not complaining. \n\nWe went Saturday morning and it was surprisingly... not super busy. They sat us down right when we arrived. I thought the service was great but maybe it's because it wasn't busy. The price ranges but it's not too bad. I was debating whether to get the dungeness crab egg benedict or the regular because of the difference in price but the crab was so worth it.", "author": "Shirley Q."}

Since we were on a time crunch and didn't want to wait for Bubba Gump's, my friend suggested Eagle Cafe and since there was no wait, we thought it was a good choice. The yelper inside of me slightly rolled my eyes at the sight of a 3 star rating and the somewhat stuck up customers, but the service was outstanding and our waitress was such a sweetheart! The menu did not have much variety, which was rather disappointing, but I somehow ended up ordering a Hot Crab Melt on the Appetizer portion of the menu and a cup of clam chowder.\n\nHot Crab Melt - According to the waitress, the Hot Crab Melt is basically their crab cocktail salad over bread with melted cheese on top. You NEED to get this whether it be an appetizer or an acting entree because it is seriously the BEST crab melt I've ever had! The crab was fresh, succulent, and juicy and the melted cheese was divine! It is definitely enough to share between 2 people and for the price, it cannot be beat!\n\nClam Chowder - Honestly Eagle Cafe's clam chowder is just so disappointing and didn't even taste like clam chowder! First off, it was all veggies and barely any clam and second, the broth was so thin! I like my clam chowder thick and creamy and Eagle Cafe's clam chowder was pretty embarrassing.\n\nMy total pre-tax and tip was under $25 which isn't too bad! My friend hated one of their pasta dishes, though, so I could see why Eagle Cafe is rated 3 stars. Other than that, I would definitely come back!

It has a wonderful view of the bay and even offers outdoor seating if you prefer. The d\u00e9cor is appropriate with many ship, bridge, and bay themed items to give you the feel and history of where you are. With a well sized lunch menu there were many considerations.  We ultimately went with a double stacked BLT and an acclaimed Clam Chowder in a bread bowl. The BLT, while simple, was well arranged and portioned, and the double stack style really gives you the hefty bite you're looking for at lunch. The Clam Chowder was worth the talk, creamy and well balanced without being too fishy, while still having plenty of tasty fresh clams. I also enjoyed the bread bowl with the flavor soaked in towards the end of the meal.

I find an overwhelming sense of calm at the water's edge, which adds a complexity when joined by the masses of tourists doing the tourist thing absolutely mobbing the waterfront. \nWe spent a good 20 minutes deciding on where to dine, given that most of the locations along the pier are of similar or equal quality, but fining the words \"Crab Cakes Benedict\" in large font outside the Eagle Cafe, that is where we ended up.\nThe interior is deceptively spacious, and deceptively crowded, for a place facing the interior of the pier and the street, however do not let this fool you, they are a fierce competitor for breakfast's best! My dad ordered the crab omelet, and I of course ordered the crab cake Benedict. The omelet was fluffy, HUGE, and absolutely filled with crab and sauce. The Bene was just as proportionately ginormous, and slightly daunting. The taste, however, of these two menu stars were absolutely delicious. Alongside both there was the shock of spindly delicious crunchy twigs, which I later discovered were uncooked and fried pasta (crazy but actually good), and some potatoes, which I disliked for the addition of bell peppers.\nThe overall feel of the restaurant was cozy and elegant, waiters were attentive and friendly, and the service was incredibly fast, given that there were no open tables at the time we dined, which I was impressed by.\nMy only dislike was parking, because in Sonoma county there is always parking somewhere, and usually free at that, but when in rome/sf, you must do as the romans/frans do and pay for parking and then walk a great distance. This being said, the walk was refreshing with the ocean breeze, and worked up our appetite for the already stated huge portion sizes.

Parked in the Pier 39 validated parking garage.  Eagle Cafe was the closest place with a bar.  Quick and friendly service for both alcohol and food.  Food was not primo, but pretty good for what we were after.  A little disappointed with the crab chowder. chicken tenders and house salad met expectations.  Great pour for the Woodford Reserve, so overall not bad.  Awesome view of Alcatraz though.  Watched the sun go down and fog roll in.", "author": "David V."}

The Eagle Cafe offers horrible tasting coffee, way overpriced food, and they expect you to pay for their workers' comp. We stopped in on our way to Alcatraz.

I ordered a coffee, which tasted like it was made 4 days prior and then microwaved when I ordered it. If the owner of the Eagle Cafe were legit, they would pay the Employee Mandates, seeing that their prices are already extremely marked up. The owner must be only concerned with ripping of tourists and lining his/her pockets with money. There was no dipping sauce for my tenders, and the cod sandwich was mainly bread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-20", "description": "This is a nice little cafe located right at the front of Pier 39 in Fisherman's Wharf. My friend & I were starving so we stopped at the first place we saw - plus, there was a check-in offer for 20% off so make sure to check in! The location is really nice and you usually are seated by the window, so you get a nice view of the wharf in the afternoon. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was just okay. Pretty average offerings for lunch - the menu had a variety of salads, hamburgers, and sandwiches with an emphasis, obviously, on seafood. I tried the Alaskan Cod Fish Sandwich, which was $16 - pretty pricey for a fish sandwich and french fries, but it was a pretty huge sandwich so I was able to save half for dinner. I wasn't overwhelmingly excited about the sandwich. The fish was slightly dry and plain tasting, and the flavors didn't mesh that well together, but if you just want a typical fish sandwich, it should suit you well enough. I also tried a cup of the clam chowder, which again, was just average - and for $5.50, I expected more. \n\nThe rest of their menu is filled with oysters, clams, crab and fish dishes, ranging from about $12-18 per dish. I might recommend coming for breakfast, but dinner prices look even steeper and the food just isn't great enough to warrant such high prices. The atmosphere and environment is nice, but it has more of a rickety, old-time feel than anything fancy or scenic. The servers were nice and attentive, and the food came out relatively quickly, which was a plus.\n\nThere are so many other restaurants and food options in Fisherman's Wharf that I wouldn't necessarily recommend stopping here, but if you do, make sure to get that check-in offer.", "author": "Jenny Y."}

You might as well take your wallet out of your pants and throw it to the sea lions...hello, where are you, you smelly pinnipeds? \n\nThe Eagle Cafe looks like a decent enough place from the outside, and it has history since they moved the entire building from the nearby waterfront to the upper level of Pier 39. They shouldn't have bothered, and the menu should have given me a clue. $18 for a Crab Salad Sandwich billed as the \"#1 Crab Salad Sandwich in San Francisco\". Well, hell's bells, sign me up. What a meh - and at such an inflated price. Spread on a split French roll was the most generic tasting, mayo-infested crab sandwich this side of a lunch truck, accompanied by slices of unripened tomato and pre-packaged fries. \n\nJamie W. had comparatively better luck with, get this, \"San Francisco's #1 Fish and Chips\". Gee, someone thinks mighty highly of themselves. Another $18 dish, but at least you get three good-sized strips of cod fillets battered up - though in dire need of the malt vinegar to give it any flavor. That tartar sauce was also desperately needed here. We were also surrounded by shrieking toddlers and parents indifferent to their complete accountability over muzzling their brats. Even the sea lions had to leave because they have their standards, too. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...expensive cafeteria food \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...Pier 39 feels like Disneyland without the seven dwarves...unless you count the Bushman \nSERVICE - 3 stars...nice enough even if some staff can't seem to see when customers need refills on their Diet Cokes \nTOTAL - 2 stars... why it's \"San Francisco's #1 Self-Proclaimed Eatery\"...well, hell's bells, sign...oh man, I almost did it again!", "author": "Ed U."}

On another there's the view of the SF business district skyline. And on another, you can people watch the comings and goings at Pier 39. Any way you look at it... a pretty good venue for a leisurely breakfast.\n\n Wife ordered the eggs Benedict, while I chose the \"Original Breakfast\" that comes with two eggs, bacon, sausage, corned beef hash.\n\n The Beni was really done right with a delish Hollandaise, and runny egg yolks, along with the crispy smoked bacon... a nice way to start another SF adventure.\n\n My \"Original,\" was also very good, but what took it up a notch, was the homemade corned beef hash. Nice and crispy on the outside, and nice delicious, tender corned beef on the inside. After sharing some with the wife, we both agreed ... probably the best CBH we've had to date, which says a lot as we've had a hella hash!\n\n With a clear sunny SF morning, along with a side order of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge, with our sour dough toast ....

SF PRIDE weekend was fun, but I needed to get away from the close to naked partiers and relax with a cold beer. The Eagle popped into mind, took an Uber and here I am. The bartender was friendly and attentive making sure to check if I needed more beer before it was empty. So glad I sat at the bar, because their raw bar is awesome and fresh with a great variety of oysters, fresh shucked. I had to order some oysters. How could I not? The Eagle serves it with fresh grated horseradish!!! If you have not tried fresh horseradish, do! First sweet, then that in your nose kick.

The patio is pretty cool with great views, but we chose to sit at the bar as we only intended to drink.\n\nThe bartender was friendly and when we asked if they have any specialties, he immediately offered up the 'famous' bloody mary.  We accepted his challenge and ordered one each.  They arrived in a big glass with lots of extras:  olives, peppers, celery, carrots...perfect mix of garnishment.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu we decided to get a snack and try some oysters.

It's not to sour, not to sweet just the right amount of vinegar and olive oil to make any salad taste good.\n\nI believe their pineapple juice is freshly made too.

Out of our family of four, only my husband liked his mixed seafood salad. His only complaint was not enough shrimp or crab is in the dish, and the salmon piece was only decent size. Our two sons ordered the pasta with meat sauce and the portion size was disappointing for $20! I had the angel hair pasta with salmon and I was very disappointed. The light tomato sauce turned out to be nothing but olive oil and tons of sliced garlic. The marinated tomatoes were over marinated and tasted sour. They also overpowered the dish and there were only three small chunks of salmon. It was not worth $26. My husband spoke to the manager and she was understanding. She took off one of the pasta with meat sauce from the bill and gave us 10% off. So for the service I would rate them higher, but their food is disappointing and overpriced. We should have listened to our city bus tour guide and stayed away from Pier 39. The entire place is over priced. Stay away from the fruit stand!", "author": "Maria G."}

Every restaurant at Pier 39 seemed to have had about a 2 hour wait and we were starving. Even though Eagle Cafe was full we were able to be seated right away. If the place had been empty with no one eating there we would have walked away. The host/hostess was very friendly and we were waited on immediately after seating. Our waitress was friendly and took our order and then she disappeared! The manager brought our food to the table and I immediately noticed that my order was wrong. I told her what I ordered and she apologized and said she would take care of everything. It took about 10 minutes but she came back with my food, fresh and hot. I had the fried jumbo shrimp platter with fries and coleslaw and hubby had a platter with fish and shrimp. The shrimp and fish was very good and the coleslaw was probably the best I have tasted. It was different from most coleslaw, crisp in taste and texture. \n\nYes, the food is overpriced but it would have been even worse if the food sucked but it was pretty good but let's face it everything on Pier 39 is overpriced and that's just the way it is!\n\nI do agree with others that they could use another restroom but since they don't have one, they should keep the one they have cleaner for the people eating there. You shouldn't eat your food and walk into the facility and see how nasty, dirty and disgusting the restroom is!\n\nWe don't have any complaints other than the fact that the restroom was filthy and our waitress disappeared and never came back. Not sure what happened to her, we kept seeing her but she totally ignored our table after taking our order and the manager was the one person that kept coming back to check on us. 4 stars go to the manager (but a word of advise, clean the restrooms!) 0 stars for the waitress! \n\nWorth a return visit.", "author": "Vikki J."}

All I can say is that we were amazed.  We know Pier 39 is a great place for seafood but we didn't know that Eagle Cafe was the best seafood place on Pier 39.   And it's the first one you see as you're coming out of the parking lot.  \n\nWe were served an assortment of appetizers:\n\nCrab Cakes - the crab cakes were amazing.  They were lightly breaded in round balls but cooked to perfection.  The crab was moist, sweet and spicy, dipped in tartar sauce, it was the best crab cakes I've ever had.  It was the perfect size as well for an appetizer because it was filling but not overly.\n\nFried Calamari - I absolutely love calamari but I'm very picky about it.  i hate it when the breadedness doesn't connect with the squid or when the squid is too chewy.  The calamari here was perfect.  Also lightly breaded and fried, the calamari tasted great with the marinara and tartar dipping sauces.\n\nChicken Tenders - I don't eat this type of meat but from the words of my party, this was the best ever.  They tasted better here than places that specialized in chicken.\n\nSteamed Garlic Clams - I don't normally eat clams or oysters because a lot of places don't clean them properly.  The clams here were clean and made to perfection.  With cut pieces of garlic, these clams just flavored up your mouth.  I'm craving one right now...\n\nGrilled Jumbo Shell of Prawns in a garlic spicy sauce - I'm saving the best for last.  Why say it's the best?  Because I normally don't eat prawns or shrimp (too chewy for me) but I absolutely loved these.  The shrimp were flavorful and not too chewy.  The sauce it came in was just spectacular.  We all began dipping our bread in that garlic sauce because it was so good.  \n\nThey also have a full bar that the guys in our group were frequenting with a large range of cocktails.\n\nWhen I go back to Pier 39, I'm headed straight for Eagle Cafe.", "author": "Sheena D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-07", "description": "Stopped in here with my young son during our outing to Pier 39 - we were both famished, and this place was nearby and got decent reviews. I've been craving a bread bowl of clam chowder for a while now, so Eagle Cafe seemed like a good bet! Sadly, it wasn't.\n\nPros: \n- The staff was uniformly polite and reasonably friendly, if a bit brusk\n- Location was handy, with a good view of the marina area\n\nCons: \n- The clam chowder was tasty (chunky with potatoes and lots of clam), but the bread bowl was very hard and very, very cold - it must've been pulled straight from a fridge and had some hot soup slopped into it. It was so hard and so cold, I was hacking away at it with my dull butter knife, and really didn't enjoy it much at all. Nothing at all like the classic warm-n-fluffy sourdough bread bowls this dish is known for. \n- My son ordered the \"pasta with butter and cheese sauce\" from the kids menu, and what arrived was a plate of greasy plain spaghetti noodles and a little plastic Dixie-type cup of cold powdered Parmesan cheese. That's it. He ate it, but it was pretty lackluster. No \"cheese sauce\" to be found.\n- We ordered a $7(!) chocolate malt to share, and while it was presented nicely (tall glass of malt + metal mixing cup with \"extra\" on the side), it hadn't been blended well at all, and there were large chunks of ice cream plus (even weirder) chunks of actual ice, all smashed into the bottom of the metal cup. It tasted okay, but wasn't even remotely worth the $7 - it felt like it'd been thrown together by someone who'd never worked a milkshake maker before. This milkshake will bring no boys to anyone's yard, ever.\n\nMy son was climbing the walls by the time our food was delivered, so I opted to not send anything back just in the interest of time, but in any other circumstance I would've (at the very least) sent the clam chowder back - the damn bread bowl was almost inedibly cold and hard, and basically ruined this classic San Francisco / Fisherman's Wharf dish. What a bummer.", "author": "Huxley D."}

It was inexcusably terribly horribly awful. I know what you're thinking, \"Aaron, it couldn't have been THAT bad, could it?\". Well let me tell you, it was. \n\n[begin rant]\n\nWe arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. We were seated right by the windows in front, which would have been nice if it weren't directly in the path of the bathroom line. They have two bathrooms, but one is marked \"employees only, do not enter\", which means that there is a constant line for the one available unisex restroom. I know because the people in line kept tripping over my chair leg. We asked if we could be seated elsewhere, but there weren't any other available tables.\n\nThe waitress that took our orders was extremely friendly and helpful, recommending which oysters were best today and helping our vegetarian friend find something on the menu he could eat. The Eagle doesn't apparently have many vegetarian visitors. His options were Cobb salad without the meat, or a BLT without the B (yes, that's an LT sandwich). They were kind enough to add some cheese to it.\n\nOnce we ordered, the drinks came quickly, and as soon as they were drained, they were refilled. This happened frequently, because by 1:45 (that's 75 minutes later) we still hadn't received our orders. There was no explanation, no apologies, just a reclusive waitress and a lot of grumbling stomachs.\n\nAfter waiting over an hour, we had to return to the office and asked that our food be placed in to-go containers. 10 minutes later we finally got our orders.\n\nGetting back to the office, we dug in. My $26 dungeness crab salad was inedible. A generous serving of fresh crab was suffocated by sweet mayonnaise dressing. This lay on a bed of sadly wilted greens, doused in a sugary vinaigrette. The entire salad had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes, the wilted lettuce and mayo doused crab were both nice and warm.\n\nTo add insult to injury, there was no local discount offered, no apologies made for the severely botched lunch, and we were charged in full for our meal. The bill for the 7 of us? Over $200. And that's with no cocktails or wine (one guy ordered a beer, the rest of us sodas and iced tea), no dessert & coffee, just the lunch.\n\nMy coworkers swear they've got a killer Eggs Benedict. I'll never know. I will never EVER return to this place.\n\n[/end rant]", "author": "Aaron M."}

(There really isn't much reason to visit Pier 39 other than a couple good restaurants and the view of the Sea Lions--the shops are a boring mix of typically touristy crap.)  \n\nMy wife and I enjoy the Eagle Cafe.  It has a nice location on the second floor of Pier 39 and is easy to get to at the base of the pier.  On a good day, sit outside and enjoy a great view up Fisherman's Wharf and of Alcatraz. The people watching from their deck is excellent!\n\nThe interior is spacious and clean.  Service has always been great.  We've mostly had breakfast here, and it never disappoints.  The portions are (too) huge and the food is consistently very good.  The omelets are great, and my wife absolutely loves their Crab Cake Benedict.  \n\nIf you don't mind paying a lot for parking, there is a structure with a pedestrian bridge that takes you right to the Eagle Cafe's front door.  But you can also frequently find on-street two-hour parking on Bay Street just two or three blocks away.\n\n--------------------------\n\nUpdated: 10/2010\n\nI had a very disappointing experience at the Eagle Cafe and felt I needed to reduce my rating.  (Note: I wanted to provide this feedback to them privately but their Web site fails to furnish any means for feedback or an email address.  So, because they do not allow private feedback, I guess I have to slam them here. Showing no interest in customer feedback in the era of social media is silly and harmful!)\n\nMy wife and I visited for lunch on Sunday, checked in with the hostess, and were told we'd be the next party of two seated.  As we waited patiently, another couple walked in and was seated at the bar (an option that was not offered to us and we would've taken.)\n\nThen five minutes later another couple walked in, and again they were immediately seated.  At this point, I'm frustrated and ask the hostess what's going on, and she managed to compound the problem by arguing with me!  She said the second couple was being seated outside on the deck (yet another option that was not offered to us and we would have found preferable.)  \n\nWe walked out with the hostess still arguing to the back of my head.  Had this been my first visit, I'd have given The Eagle Cafe a one star, but since I've been there before and been happy with the food, I reduced my rating to three stars.

I had the dungeness Benedict (pricey,but the portions are huge!) and my husband had the corn beef hash. The hash was fresh and not over salty like most hash is. Everything came out a little on the lukewarm side, but I'm OCD about that anyways. The view is incredible and my mimosa hit the spot. I guess everyone can experience a negative no matter where you go......so take the bad reviews with a grain of salt.

So my boyfriend sits down while I wait in line for over 15 mins to use the ONE bathroom they have. When I finally sit down my boyfriend tells me he wasnt acknowledged by anyone for 10 minutes. He then goes to the bathroom and after 5 minutes the waitress finally comes with our waters. Really? 15 mins for water! I ordered our food which came out 20 minutes later and was awful!!!! \n\nMy chicken tenders tasted like fish and my boyfriends grilled chicken chipotle sandwich was DRYER then a hot summer day!!! Nothing but chicken with a little chipotle sauce on a hard loaf of french bread. No condiments on it at all. So my boyfriend asked for bbq sauce and the dude is sweating, all red like he just got the damn death penalty! He returns with the water down gross bbq sauce, when my boyfriend took a lil nibble he instantly started gagging!! The ranch was even gross! We didnt even eat half of our food!!\n\nThis place is such a dump that there was cut out white drawing paper covering the tables!

I suggested this place since it serves one of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll give them that and on that note we weren't disappointed. Other than that our other dishes were not outstanding. We ordered a fried fish sampler and the selection choice of fried seafood was odd and not very appealing. I also ordered a Bloody Mary. The flavor was dull and not spicy enough.\n\nWhen we sat down we first felt rushed when trying to select our orders. When we did decide, I asked if the \"fried\" fish sandwich could be grilled instead of fried. But our server snappily replied \"It's a fried fish sandwich.\" I then opted for soup and salad forgetting the idea completely. After we finished our calamari appetizer, our server failed to clear the table for our main courses proceeding to crowd the table with our dishes. Luckily the three of us were seated at a four person table for I piled up our used dishes on this place setting. Even after this effort was made by me, our server did not take the initiative to clear the table. We felt crammed. Our server was not every attentive either and it took numerous attempts to grab her attention. \n\nThis restaurant offers a 10% discount when checking in on yelp, which is a great! However, when I asked to use it our server seemed annoyed and I even overheard her say \"we have some yelpers here\" to her co-workers. I was offended. \n\nI hope this is just deviant from this restaurants norm considering other good reviews. I did really like the calamari and would try it again if only I have a better server.", "author": "Erin D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-24", "description": "So, as I can tell from the lack of reviews for this spot from any actual San Franciscans, I'm sure this place is skipped over by most the locals with their \"I'm better than you\" mentality that this place is only a tourist spot and nothing more.  Yes, I was a tourist when I tried this place, but it was damn good by any standards (get over yourselves Yelpers from San Francisco who all think they are professional food critics).\n\nWe went here on a Saturday morning and had one of the best breakfasts ever: peanut butter and banana french toast!  To whoever invented this incredible combination of some of the greatest foods of all time, I thank you sir (or madam), because you made my trip to San Francisco better.  I would come back to this city just to eat this meal again.\n\nNot only is the french toast here awesome, but their corned beef hash is the best ever too.  It made canned corned beef hash taste like dog food in comparison (and I've always liked canned corned beef hash).  Additionally, the mango mimosas they have at Eagle Cafe are the best alcoholic breakfast beverage ever (not counting beer, which is great any time of the day).\n\nThe service here was also great, with our waitress topping off my coffee before it ever got less than half full, even after I was so full that I couldn't stand to look at it anymore.\n\nThe only reason I can't give Eagle Cafe five stars, is that the day before we ate breakfast there, we went there for lunch at 11:45 AM.  When we sat down we were given breakfast menus.  I asked for a lunch menu and was told they don't start serving lunch yet.  Really? what kind of restaurant doesn't have lunch at lunchtime?  Maybe they cater to slackers that sleep in all day and eat breakfast until 2 in the afternoon.\n\nAnyways San Francisco, get over yourself and your fear of tourism and come out and try this awesome breakfast spot.  There won't be any other locals in there anyways so you won't have to worry about being seen by other elitists and losing your indie cred.", "author": "Jake K."}

It came with bread to sop up the sauce, which was definitely the right idea. We also ordered the lobster bisque in a bread bowl- maybe a little overpriced, but super tasty.\n\nFor entrees, I got a house salad and my boyfriend got the crab salad sandwich with fries.

Well this restaurant happens to be the most visible and I just liked everything I tried in this place. The beer, oysters, clan chowder soup and even the burger. So go to this place with the intention to win and don't worry about prickly Yelpers who usually get it wrong. I am with you in sprit.

I ordered the 2 eggs, which came with potatoes, bacon and toast. \nOK, so the eggs were ok, the bacon was actually pretty good (thick and crisp) but the potatoes were bad, mushy and flavorless and the toast?? a hamburger bun with a sprig of rosemary jammed in the top. Really? \nThe fruit that came on the plate (a slice of melon and some orange) looked unappealing. \nAlso there were some strange garnishes, like what looked like several strands of dried spaghetti... really? \nThe view is great, the coffee was good, but I would skip this place for the breakfast food!

An employee greeted us at the door and led us directly to a table which was nice. I was a bit underwhelmed by the interior of the restaurant, not sure what I was expecting but it seemed to be a bit plain. Our waiter was a nice young man who was very attentive to us. The food, like most things at pier 39 was a bit on the pricey side. My BF enjoyed his Po boy sandwich and the fries were tasty although upon first glance, they appeared bland. My burger however, was undercooked for my liking. When ordering, I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked and didn't think to mention it. The result was that I got a burger which was much too pink for me. I was a bit disappointed, especially since the burger cost $12 but didn't notice until I had actually taken a bite. Overall, we were satisfied with our visit here but I don't think I'll be in any rush to return. During our next Pier 39 visit, we will likely try out a different eatery.", "author": "Vanessa S."}

We chose the eagle car because two of the four of us don't eat crab and they have a very wide variety on the menu. They also have outdoor seating and would allow our dog on the patio. They even brought her water without us having to ask! Anyway, my dad started out with raw oysters and loved them. For our entrees I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a side of greens instead of fries my husband ordered a fried cod sandwich with fries. The sandwiches were HUGE and there was so much chicken breast on it. The side of greens was soooooo delicious. My husband loved the sandwich and the fish wasn't too fried. My mother ordered fried oysters and said they were the best fried oysters she had ever had. And she's had them a lot of places including different countries! My father ordered a huge dungeness 3 pound crab and absolutely loved it. He ate every single bite. Aside from the great food, the view was very beautiful.", "author": "Kelsey K."}

The food was great! He and mom had fried shrimp and oysters that they both loved. We all shared raw oysters that were so fresh and yummy. I had the lobster bisque in the bread bowl and I had to fight everyone off of it it was so good. My partner had the salmon salad with blue cheese and walnuts and it was fantastic.

I watched him do this for several minutes and I observed two disturbing incidents where he found an oyster that had split itself already and had been sitting exposed since we had been there.

When we got there, we got seated outside on the windward side of the building to freeze our asses off at a little railing that was built out of little more than a couple 2x6's. This should have been foreshadowing of what was to come. The iced tea we ordered tasted like it had been sitting for a day or 2.  The French fries we got with the eagle burger were cooked in the same oil as their calamari so they tasted like squid. Don't get me wrong, I love calamari. But not when it's got the consistency of a French fry and is dripping with ranch, not so much. The burger made my pregnant wife so violently ill, I contemplated taking her to urgent care.Thankfully the staff comp'd our meal, but I won't go back.

As a result, I wasn't really expecting much from the food.  We noticed this place was open for breakfast the previous night and decided to give it a go.  It's on the Embarcadero end of Pier 39.\n\nContrary to the stats above, this place was open at 7:30am, which is good, because I'm here working, not sight seeing.  We were sat immediately - the place was empty, and offered coffee - a perfectly wonderful flavorful coffee (no starbucks burnt taste here) - that I wanted to refill several times.\n\nI ordered the corn beef hash.  This was an overstuffed plate.  The garnish included orange slices, watermelon wedge and fried angel hair pasta (which is new).  The \"edible\" components included breakfast potatoes - large amounts of paprika in this, the eggs, and the \"home-made\" corn-beef hash.  The hash was crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and seasoned well.  The eggs were made just the way I like them, and the potatoes actually had some flavor.  In addition, there was a local bread roll that was huge.  No butter on the table, but thats a small problem.\n\nMy wife went for the salmon benedict.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, the spinach raw (I would have preferred it steamed and wilted), One of the eggs was perfectly cooked, but the other was over-cooked.\n\nService was excellent - friendly and fast - just what you want out of a breakfast place.\n\nThis place is worth the trip down to Pier 39.", "author": "Adrian H."}

Why, you might say, would people walk when there is a lovely antique streetcar right there to bring the hordes to Fisherman's Wharf?  Because SF has pickpockets on their mass transit, but brave women who alert the car that this is going on and get belted in the face for their troubles!  This happened on the streetcar in front of ours, and as our driver wisely surmised, \"One streetcar can't go around another.\"  Thus, our forced march down the foggy Embarcadero.\n\nWhen Pier 39 came in sight, we limped the remaining few feet and up the stairs and fell at the door of this tempting seafood bar.  I had to have oysters and I had to have them now, and without hesitation, ordered an Anchor Steam to go with them.  A bowl of steamed shrimp followed.  There was no dehydrated traveler in the desert who appreciated the rejuvenating affects of this repast more than we did!  The bar was bright and airy and very friendly.

We had gone to every other restaurant on the wharf that was participating in the 2-hour parking validation, and each had an 1+ hour wait time. Eagle Cafe, on the other hand, was only a 15-20 minutes. We were starving, and we settled. Boy, was it a bad idea. For the amount of money I paid for my dinner ($92 for two people, without tax), I expected better food. Yes, I looked at the menu before I went in, and yes, I looked at the pricing as well before walking in. I ordered the fried seafood platter, with a mix of shrimp, salmon, and mahi-mahi. But everything was doused in sodium, and I swear that on the first bite into that fried shrimp, I was going to shrivel and dry up and die. Needless to say, I left my fried foods untouched. The side salad was also doused in dressing and was very soury/salty as well. As an appetizer, we ordered the clams (marinated in garlic and butter). Not a special dish, but something I usually enjoyed. I actually expected it to be at least better than local restaurants in Sac. Sadly, it wasn't. The clams in garlic and butter at Frasinetti Winery in Sacramento tasted a whole lot better! \n\nAll in all, it's a nice, cozy little restaurant in the front corner of the wharf. VERY friendly and nice service!! The staff were attentive and the receptionist upfront was approachable. A+ for service. That's where the extra star comes in. Otherwise, if I'd just based this review on food, I'd give it a one (just because there isn't anything less).

While on a business trip, my colleagues and I stopped here and asked right when we sat down if the check could be split between the 7 of us. I used to be a server myself and I understand this is quite a request, but the server told us it would be no problem and we appreciated the meal all the more for it. The food was mediocre but we didn't expect much more. It was pretty awful to have to sit right next to the only restroom for both men and women - there was a line next to our table for the whole duration of our meal. We paid our bills and left after an overall decent experience. It was the next day that I realized, while looking at my bank statement, that I had been charged not only for my portion of the check, but also for the entire meal of ~$235. I figured it was a mistake and called the restaurant. I spoke with Marcy Lim who treated me like trash. She was kind and managerial at first, but quickly became hostile and sarcastic. First she told me it was a mistake, but quickly changed her story to something along the lines of it being a policy they had to put a hold on the first card's account for the total. This was mind-boggling to me and completely illogical. I calmly informed her that the $235 was a solid amount of money and I needed it back as soon as possible. It was at that point that she broke down to total immaturity. She told me I was \"coming at\" her, when in reality I was calmly letting her know that this was not an acceptable \"policy\" (or mistake). She even had the audacity to sarcastically offer to charge my account AGAIN for the $235, and when I asked how that would help she responded with \"I don't know sir, you're the one that's upset here\". I was completely shocked. It took over a week for that hold on my account to be dropped. Not once did Marcy Lim offer ANYTHING to help me. Only sarcastic apologies and immature resentment.

Since we were smack dab in the middle of Touristville (Pier 39), I was expecting a mediocre meal that was overpriced. After wandering around a bit, I decided on Eagle Cafe due to the pretty good reviews on yelp. My nephew and I had just watched the magic show performance and we were both hungry. I am SO glad we chose this place, because it had all 3 of the most important components of any restaurant....    great ambiance (casual-style \"traditional Americana\" character)... great food... and great service!! \nI was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this place. Even my 9yr old nephew gave it 2 thumbs up. He ordered the fish and chips, which were delicious and tasted fresh. I usually don't even like fish, but it was so good that I stole a few bites from my nephew's platter. I ordered the crab salad sandwich and substituted my fries with a side salad (their dressing was great by the way). It was perfect and was exactly what I wanted!.. I decided to have a glass of wine and our server ( I think his name was Ronald?) helped me decide on a great pinot grigio... I loved it so much I asked to see the menu again to get the name so I could purchase it at BevMo.  \nOur server (Ronald?) was very nice, super friendly and very attentive (without being overly). Towards the end of our meal, a friendly, older gentleman (the owner?) came around and greeted each table and asked how everything was. I thought that was a nice touch. \nI will definitely come back to this place again, if I'm ever in the area. \nOh yeah, I forgot to mention they scored a few more points for having a  big screen tv to the side of the bar area, where I could catch a glimpse of the basketball game that was on...

I, however, will still base my review solely on the food and service. \n\nKeep in mind that this place is a tourist spot.  It's not going to be your every day \"go to\" restuarant.

It can be seasoned a little better. Portions are huge. \n\nThe oysters were sweet and satisfying. It came with horseradish, cocktail sauce, and lemon under a bed of shaved ice. When ordering anything from the oyster bar, the oyster shuckler brings it out themselves which I like.

Once I slowed down and studied the menu, I realized there were some smaller options, so I settled on the lobster bisque in a bread bowl.  I haven't ordered anything in a bread bowl in about ten years, but it seemed like the right thing to do here. My dining companion had the grilled seafood salad, which was decent, fresh seafood with nice greens.  The best part was my rose gimlet.  This thing was a bucket of martini.  All gin.  You will not be disappointed.  I enjoyed my bisque because it was of the thinner variety, not overly gloppy and heavy.  Our server was truly, genuinely surprised when I said that I liked the bisque.  All I can think of is that it came from a can, and she was like, YES, they BOUGHT it again. Didn't give me the best feeling, ya know?  We were 1 of two tables there on a Friday night @ 7:00pm.", "author": "Felicia M."}

Probably a good thing that I hadn't because my opinion of this place COMPLETELY changed! \n\nThe first time I went here was with a group of friends the morning after my bachelorette party (Maybe this is why I thought it was good) b/c our hotel was close to the Wharf and we couldn't find any other place open within walking distance for Breakfast that seemed ok to eat at. \n\nAnyways... I went there recently with my husband b/c our favorite breakfast place in the city was closed for the weekend... SUPER ANNOYED at this but whatever... \n\nWe ordered the Mango Mimosa's b/c the last time I had them they were fantastic...this time it was watered down OJ and cheap champagne with NO MANGO. So I told our tatted up waitress, Yeah very professional, that there was no mango in either of our drinks and she actually argues with me! Saying that there is it probably settled on the bottom and to mix it....UM, NO! So she brought it over  to the bartender who looked to be about 12 and I watched him dump an orange mixer in a plastic bottle into the top of the drinks and she brought it back trying to say that there was Mango Puree in there. Effin liar, called her out on that as well! \n\nSo, we ordered some of the banana nut bread to start b/c we were STARVING and she comes over, about 15 minutes later with one slice of bread that had been microwaved with two thick pieces of cold butter lying on the top and told us it was fresh....Can you say COMPULSIVE LIAR? The last time I had gone here we got a bread basket! \n\nThen our meals came out, which last time I remember being very good... Crab Cake Benedict. \n\nUm....not quite! The crab cakes were so salty they were inedible. We ended up leaving still hungry and REALLY ticked off that we had even gone there, PLUS I was embarrassed b/c I had vouched for this place as being good and my husband loves to give me \"playful\" grief when a restaurant I claim to be good isn't up to his standards!

Since it's located smack dab in the middle of the most touristy part of the city, it doesn't really need to work about keeping regulars or maintaining repeat business. That's why it's so hit-and-miss. I work near this place so I've been a few times for lunch. I like the atmosphere, very light and airy. I like the menu. The prices are pretty steep, but you are paying for a huge pile of food no matter what you order. I'd rather have half the portion and pay a few bucks less... but America likes big food, and that's what they get at the Eagle. Actually the best value on the menu is the Cobb salad which is about $13 and is a trough of meats, cheese, egg and incidental veggie things. Pretty good really.\n\nThe last time I was there wasn't a great experience however. My GF and I went in for a light lunch, so we shared a salad and garlic bread. It took 25 minutes for the cold floppy garlic bread to arrive, and when we asked about our salad, the waitresses' response immediately was \"Well, I put the order in right after I took it, I don't know why it's taking so long.\" It sounded very guilty, and the obvious subtext was that she had actually forgotten our order. Then, after another 10 minutres (how long does it take to cook a cold salad?) We asked a gain about the salad, saying it would be good to have the garlic bread and salad together. We received a cold response, and then a few minutes later our waitress dropped the salad on our table and remarked \"There, now you have them together, happy?\"\n\nWow, yes we are happy now, because you just saved us having to leave a tip.", "author": "Jesse C."}

I ordered the stuffed prawns AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY HOT! However the shrimps were not peeled. Try peeling the skin off of a super hot shrimp. The waiter was extremely inattentive and more concerned with hanging by the front door and talking to girls. He forgot to discount our check 10% with our yelp coupon so I had to remind him to do that. Food is WAY OVER price and lacks original flavor.

Good food, good location but the service was subpar.  My wife and I each ordered a Vegi omelette. I ordered mine without mushrooms but the waiter seemed a little confused and thought I asked for mushrooms at first.  My wife asked for her omelette with cheese or mushrooms.  My food came to order but my wife got her order with cheese.\nWhen she mentioned this to the waiter, his reaction was very defensive and he said he thought my wife said \"with cheese\".  First,  why would she request cheese for an order that originally includes cheese??  Second, I've never seen a server argue with a customer.  He seemed very overwhelmed but I would think its wrong to question a customer. He did return and tried to offer to take my wife's order back but by then she had scraped off the cheese and didn't want to deal with him anymore.\nOn the flip side of service, the manager was kind enough to bring our toddler some toast before the rest of us got our meal as he was being a little feisty.\nStill, I've never had a waiter argue with us and was very turned off.

We waited for the waiter to make some concessions for other things he could do to make up for it but there was nothing. We had already ordered drinks and were so tired and hungry that we just couldn't be bothered to move, but had we been told at the start that they were out of key ingredient of what I expect is one of their popular items (like they do in most restaurants) we would have appreciated it and had a much better outlook on this place even if we decided to stay.\n\nSo with no bread bowls we settled on regular bowls of clam chowder, some fried calamari and some oysters. The hubs said the oysters were really good, me not being a huge fan cannot vouch for them but they seemed to be reasonably priced. The calamari was good but as long as it's not rubber fried calamari usually is.\n\nThe clam chowder was okay. I think there were green peppers in it which was kind of unusual but overall the taste was fine. To be fair I had been really looking forward to my bread bowl so unless it was knock your socks of good, which is wasn't, I was bound to be disappointed.\n\nThe service was decent, the guy tried to be funny, but he his humor just couldn't make up for everything not to mention his disappearance for about 20 minutes while we were waiting for the bill.

I had the bowl because the cup option was rather small for my big lady appetite. In hindsight, I should've gotten the clam chowder by itself and not order and plate of chicken tenders.

But I'm getting off topic. Following the 1 hour it took to process, we decided to walk a few blocks down to the Ferry Building. Jenster was hungry and it was still a bit early so we couldn't find any breakfast place. We walked up to Pier 39 and ran into several San Francisco Police Officers and asked them to point us in the direction of a good breakfast place.... Eagle Cafe was recommended with no decent.\n\nUpon our arrival, we found it at the beginning of Pier 39, second floor with a good view of the Fisherman's Wharf. We were promptly greeted and seated by the friendly staff.... Hot Waitresses, polite and professional.\n\nBreakfast Menu was extensive so I chose one of their Signature Omelets with Bacon, Cheese, Onions and Home Fries.... The presentation was excellent and food tasted great. Jenster enjoyed herself and more than enough food to satisfy her.... so I was safe from being 'attacked'  from my beloved spouse... who is proficient in the Three 'R' s...... \nRANTING, RAVING, RIDICULE a true test of any Male's committment.\n\nAfter Breakfast, we walked the various shops. This was the weekend of the Peak of the Swine Flue or the H1 N1  whatever.... the worlds largest Cruise Ship, Mariner of the Sea, had diverted from Mexico and stopped in until Sunday along with over 3500 passengers, which had disembarked AFTER we got seated and ate. \n\nI approached one of the Lanky and Lovely Pier Officers and asked her \"Is this the boat that does the SF Bay Cruise around Alcatraz?\" She smiled and said \"I dooon't think so Doofy.\" It's all in fun.   \n\nIncidentally, the City/County of SF gets paid a small fortune$$$  in revenue when a ship of that size docks.\n\nBy the way... you can park for FREE... 1st hour validated at this multi-tier parking area near Pier 39.

So you expect to get oyster with meat right? NO, u get a bunch of this weird spinach cream sauce while digging in that crap for an oyster u pull on something that probably was canned oysters. TERRIBLE. Her ceaser salad was about 10 or 12 bucks for a CEASER SALAD? it lacked in taste, was kind of water too. So was my clam chowder in a bowl, pretty runny not thick and creamy, kept biting into the taste of sand from the oysters, pretty bad tasting. should of just got to one of those vendors on the street and got a bowl there. Oh i forgot to mention that these three items took over 20+ mins for our order to come out! arent these considered appetizer type foods on the menu? while people who were seated later than us go their damn meals.

I was surprised by the number of Asian male wait staff. One was kinda cute (by my \"if I were still in college standards\"). The place has been an Italian family business since 1929. They literally lifted the whole restaurant and moved and placed it on the 2nd floor when Pier 39 was built and refurbished the exterior to match the Pier 39 design. It blends so well that it looks like the building has always been a part of Pier 39. Above the bar is a displayed collection of Navy caps including a SFPD one. Naval pics decorate the walls and it's a cozy restaurant with partial pier view. \n\nOur wait staff was very no nonsense efficient. Prices for breakfast are not worse than at any other SF restaurant & hubby thought it was more reasonable than some place like Perry's near the Embarcadero. Coffee $2.95, Sm OJ $3.00. His classic eggs Benedict $9.95 came with 2 muffins topped with eggs and Canadian bacon and lots of spicy, paprika flavored chunks of soft potatoes. Cutely garnished with a sprig of rosemary in a slice of cantaloupe and slice of orange. My \"homemade\" corned beef hash was too mushy, and was a disappointing small portion. My potato (same as hubby's) portions was 3x the size of my hash. Where's the beef? I asked for poached eggs which came in a separate ramekin. Get this, they ask how you want the eggs poached - soft, med or hard! And it was done right. 2 wonderful slices of buttered wheat bread, the good stuff with oats baked on the crust, not the commercial Wonder bread kind. \nThe tourist at the other table was enjoying his bloody Mary special of the day. Nothing like booze at 10AM to start the day, right? There's a SF Health surcharge and hubby was happy to see it's one of the few places who puts a pre-calculated scale at the bottom of the receipt to tell you how much tip to give at 15%, 18%, 20%.

They sat us at 2 tables next to each other, which was fine.  The view was lovely, even on a cold, rainy SF day.

Crab sandwich was disappointing.  The bread was too thick and the crab salad didn't have much crab flavor.

We saw the Eagle Cafe and noticed they had oysters on the half shell and that's what we wanted (plus a meal) so we decided to eat there. The oysters tasted so fresh it was as if they were just caught - and maybe they were, I don't know. So, yes, very good oysters, we could have had a lot more than the half dozen we shared but we had to save room for our main course. For that, we had the Alaskan Cod sandwich w/ fries. The fries were fresh cut potatoes into shoestrings - my personal favorite way to prepare french fries and the sandwich was excellent too. The sandwich was a generous portion so we definitely go our $$$'s worth. The sandwich could have had a little more of the sauce on it but other than that an excellent meal.", "author": "Marc W."}

Despite the general touristy vibe Pier 39 gives off, there are good things - but the trick is to go early and off-season. \n\nOne of our pleasant surprises were the breakfasts at the Eagle Cafe. I have never, ever eaten there later than 11 a.m., because by Noon the Wharf is chocked full of ass-bellied mouths-agape tourists, with families of crying toddlers, shuffling elderlies and people looking for the perfect \"Only In San Francisco!\" fleece pullover. \n\nWe are just a short walk from Mama's, but sometimes I don't feel like standing in line for an overrated meal accentuated by angry looks from others if I so much as dawdle briefly to examine a newspaper after I finish my meal. And so, we have enjoyed several morning trips to Eagle Cafe, and every time we've enjoyed it. \n\nThe eggs benedict are solid, the regular bacon/sausage/whatevs-and-eggs are good and if you're really, really hungry, give the ham steak a try - but be prepared to feel the need to go right back to bed. \n\nIf you're an omelette and meat fan, try their chef's special - another treat that should only be eaten once in a rare while, because otherwise your arteries will commit sepeku. \n\nThe only reason I didn't go for 4 out of 5 was drink prices. If you're somebody who enjoys the occasional breakfast cocktail - and I am - you'll find their prices a bit too much. A Bloody Mary or Irish Coffee cost almost as much as their enormous breakfasts. If you're looking for a real eye-opener with your toast and eggs, you'll drop far more than you initially intended for breakfast. \n\nAlso, they won't give out the password for the WiFi signal. Or our waitress during our last visit just had no idea what it was and gave us a lame excuse.", "author": "Drew H."}

It was a gorgeous day so we opted to sit outside at the bar top on the second floor and people watch. The clam chowder was pretty good here, served in either a bread bowl, bowl or cup. We also ordered a calamari which was really good! I recommend this place if you happen to be in Pier 39 and are looking for a place to hang out, have a beer and people watch.", "author": "Christina D."}

I had the mushroom and jack cheese omelette which arrived on a boat sized plate filled with well seasoned house potatoes, four wedges of sourdough toast, and slices of orange and cantaloupe. (Note: egg whites may be substituted for an additional charge ~$2, choice of bread and fresh fruit vary depending on what's available.) Also indulged in a Bloody Mary flavored with Absolute Peppar - spicy and refreshing! Servers were all pleasant and very attentive without being bothersome. Being accustomed to the higher price ranges of food establishments around the wharf/downtown SF, the prices here were not shocking at all (my plate was ~$12, drink $7), and considering the gigantic portion size and quality of the food/drink, I found the meal to be an overall great value. Perhaps this may not be the most satisfying place to have lunch or dinner - after reading some of the previous reviews - but the breakfast/brunch menu earns a thumbs up from me! And I liked that amongst the hustle and bustle of other eateries at Pier 39, this was busy, but not overly crowded since it's up on the 2nd level away from all the tourist traffic down below.", "author": "Elaine W."}

If you're looking for a chill spot or a romantic evening, I'd recommend Eagle Cafe.", "author": "Brenden L."}

I would really give the Eagle Cafe 2 1/2 stars. My grilled shrimp salad was good but it was just shrimp, lettuce, and dressing. That's it? For $19 throw a girl a crouton or something. My fiance's sandwich with seasoned fries was pretty good, but again the price issue...", "author": "Abby P."}

I love the breakfast omelettes - my fav is the California omelette.  The service was great and the view was stunning!  I was there on a nice warm day and got to sit outside to really enjoy the Cali weather.  I love their drinks - especially the margaritas!  A lot of ppl said how pricey things are - but this IS pier 39 San Francisco!  I think all the food places in this area are about the same.  So...just enjoy it :)", "author": "MissJ J."}

Loved that it had a great view, being at Pier 39 and the service was awesome too.  Anytime that I'm ever in San Fran I'm absoutely hitting up Eagle Cafe.", "author": "Lisa B."}

I have NEVER received such poor service, EVER, in all my years (...OK, maybe once...  See my review of \"It's Delectable\".  ...but that was a long time ago, and of a completely different type.  The Eagle Cafe is just pure INCOMPETENCE):  A SEVENTY-FIVE-minute wait for entrees, with nothing more than unfulfilled promises from our server that our food would be \"right out\" (never happened), and complete neglect from management, making no efforts whatsoever to put the situation right.  We ran out of time during our already extended lunch break, and just took our items to go.  And when we finally DID get them, they were of the absolute WORST quality.  A fucking JOKE.  Really.  For the prices they charge, they should be utterly ashamed of themselves.  Personally, if I were the manager, I would be embarrassed to offer such service.  This place should be CLOSED DOWN; the owners & managers made to hang their sorry heads in SHAME!!!  Save your money, and go find a quality place.  The Eagle Cafe doesn't give a rat's ass about you, or ANY of its customers.", "author": "Eric H."}

My husband and I do what we call \"date day\" and we absolutely love to go to the Eagle Cafe and order their raw oysters.  Nothing better than to order their raw oysters, along with a few Oyster Rockafellers (sp?).  Ambiance is nice and during football season it is nice to watch the games while we eat.  One more thing - their Bloody Mary's are simply the best.  Price is a bit high, but oh so worth it.  Service is usually good - not overly friendly, but good.", "author": "Karen Z."}

The found memories of a restaurant that truly captured the essence of San Francisco. The oldest restaurant on Pier 39. They actually lifted the building and set it on top of the Pier so that they can build the parking area. The atmosphere was like cheers, everyone knew your name. Most that worked on the Pier would stop off at the Eagle for a drink and to socialize before going to random bars around the neighborhood after work. The portions were massive, but to be fare there still pretty big. I used to looooove the breakfast. Living near by I would come here every Sunday just for the breakfast. Lunch was good. Dinner was too. The Eagle really change from a few years back. I think its called Tin Fish at the Eagle or something. Now it has no character. It just blends in with all the other restaurants on the Pier. The food is good, they have more choices now. I don't eat there anymore but I'm not mad at them. Hey, its a business. They had to sell out in order to turn a profit. I'd probably do the same.", "author": "Christian H."}
