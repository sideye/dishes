Me and my best friend were starving and I told my best friend that I don't want to go far just to eat and I asked him if he knows any restaurant that's nearby and I told him that i don't care what kind of food it is for I'm Type 2 diabetic and I didn't eat breakfast this morning so my blood sugar is coming down quick and i need something to eat now.\n\nHe said he knows this restaurant not far so he took me here we walked 2 blocks and dined here this afternoon. He told me that this is where he frequents because the food is good and they give you generous portions the way Chinese food is supposed to be served. We got in and were seated quickly as we were having a conversation about something. This joint was empty when we got in and I was paying close attention about the ambience of this place.\n\nIt's OK and a typical Chinese restaurant, brightly lit, the menus are easy to read and understand and there were menu items posted on the walls in both Chinese characters and English letters. Now mind you that in my experience as an veteran eater, whenever I go to a certain Chinese eating place and the are writings in their language, this means this joint is Legit specially if their local clientele are Chinese people too.\n\nWe were handed menus and I picked the beef w/ scrambled eggs and my friend picked the Mongolian beef and a big bowl of Wor Wonton soup. We waited about 10 minutes and we're still talking about the events of the day and our food came out and we started to eat. I told my friend that the food here is tasty and they give you a generous portion and he agreed.\n\nHe said he picked this restaurant not only because it's near his house but also the great taste of the food. We finished our meal and the tab came to $33.05 with tax and I added a tip so it all boiled down to almost $40.00 with the tip for 2 big main dishes + a big bowl of steamed rice + a big bowl of soup (We had to take some home because there was a lot of leftover soup) + 2 cans of soda....Not bad!\n\nWe enjoyed eating here and this wouldn't be the last time either. I usually eat in places like this then forget about it for awhile for I wanted to miss the restaurants I ate before and this place was no exception. A Jem of a restaurant if you happen to be near the Golden Gate park around Balboa street between 6th and 7th street. They accept cash and plastics here of every kind (Debit/Credit Cards). A highly recommended Chinese restaurant I might add.", "author": "Joel A."}

He told our group this was his favorite Chinese restaurant, and he frequented this restaurant quite often noting its proximity to his home and the restaurant's inexpensive menu.  That appeared to be the case when he led us into a crowded Emperor Palace Restaurant on Mother's Day weekend, and the waiter recognized him immediately offering our group of four to sit at a big banquet sized table.  The Emperor Palace sits on the 500 block of Balboa Street, a mostly residential block in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. \n\nPerusing the worn, sticky menus the first thing we noticed were the super cheap prices.  Together we shared three items, the Dry Fried Beef Chow Fun, the Chicken Pan Fried Noodle and the Rock Cod Filet in Black Bean Sauce Clay Pot (http://bit.ly/2zXiGvo).  The two noodle dishes were solid.  I didn't try the rock cod but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Included was a carrot with Chinese root house soup and sweet, fresh orange slices for dessert both complimentary.  All in all it was a very good experience.\n\nFast forward about eight weeks later my friends invited me back for a celebration dinner of sorts.  The restaurant was far less crowded.  We were greeted with a pot of hot tea and brand new menus with increased menu prices across the board.  Sigh.  So much for cheap eats!!\n\nAfter some indecision on what we wanted to eat we finally put in an order with the friendly waiter.  Our choices would arrive rather quickly but first they served us their complimentary house soup which was again a carrot and Chinese root soup.  In the order of arrival were:\n\nSalt and Pepper Flounder Fish Filet (http://bit.ly/2Jzs1tc) - Wait!  We didn't order this.  These were fresh flounder filet pieces, battered, deep fried, salt and peppered and served with chopped jalapeno.  Tasty as it was we flagged down the waiter who took it and started to walk towards the kitchen when he was intercepted by a young lady who brought it back to our table and asked if we'd mind keeping the dish on the house.  No sense in wasting good food.  Thank you!  We accepted.\n\nPea Shoots saut\u00e9ed in Garlic (http://bit.ly/2Nnu31N) - A non-menu item that I chose because I gotta have my veggies!  Delicious!  The pea shoots were vibrant and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of garlic.\n\nChicken Pan Fried Noodle (http://bit.ly/2Jzt0to) - My friend's favorite.  If it was the same as the one we had on my first visit then it was solid.  I picked off a few pieces of the tender bok choy but didn't have the chicken or the noodles.\n\nHoney Walnut Prawns (http://bit.ly/2LnfzSb) - Heavily mayo'd but okay by my standards.  I'm glad the walnuts were crunchy and fresh tasting.\n\nCrispy Chicken Half (http://bit.ly/2mqCzSb) - Very well executed the chicken meat was properly seasoned and moist while the chicken skin was nice and crispy.  Sadly, they served this with stale shrimp chips that tasted like they'd been fried in old oil and were left sitting out too long.\n\nSalt and Pepper Squids (http://bit.ly/2uL78Wr) - Similar to the flounder they served us by mistake but these were prepared flat pieces of calamari.  Despite not having any squid tentacles I enjoyed this as much as I did the flounder.\n\nRed Bean Soup (http://bit.ly/2JygwSL) - The traditional Chinese dessert was served complimentary.  A bit too sweet and runny, but it was free so I'm not complaining.\n\nOverall it was another very good meal, and my friends had plenty of leftovers to take home.  A 3.5 star experience for sure!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

However, there is something to be said about people who are more adventurous when it comes to food and have developed something called an \"iron stomach.\"  \n\nI LOVE Emperor Palace Restaurant for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Big Portions (because Chinese food is designed to be consumed in family style)\n2.  Quick (I have only done the pick-up option, and not delivery)\n3.  Tasty (as long as you order the non-Americanized dishes - quick find an Asian friend and get cultured!)\n4.  Takes credit cards\n\n My one con is probably the etiquette, but that's my little American-born \"first generation voice\" speaking up.  If you travel to Asia, and eat as the locals do, you will understand that customer service is a totally different concept.  Yes, I know we are in America and immigrants should do as we do here, but isn't this a country based on immigration?

I have posted many reviews of places around the bay, where you can eat well for not too much money. That's where my \"trademark\" \"$10 for lunch ya'll\" (mostly for yummy buffet food,) was born. When I reviewed a rare and outstanding \"$5 for lunch ya'll\" place in Daly City, complete with pics, I got messages from several of you telling me, \"looks great, I would like to go, but I live in Frisco, and with the time and gas to get down there, it ain't $5 anymore.\" Well, I've got good news for you. You don't have to drive all the way down to Daly City to enjoy one of my iconic \"only $5 for lunch ya'll\" places. There is one right in the middle of San Francisco, in the Richmond district, say hello to Emperor Palace. When you first walk in, you think hmmm, typical Cantonese. But you do see one notable fact immediately, and that's the fact that almost all the tables are filled with the usual \"good eaters\" and that means Cantonese contractors, house painters, and construction workers, s sign of good food and value. These folks know how and where to eat for lunch. The next thing you'll notice is the menu. (Selections and Price.) and you will immediately be surprised to see that most everything on the menu is ?? Yeah, you guessed it. \"$5.25 ya'll\". Impossible you say, with rents and expenses in SF? No, I'm not sh----n you! The whole noodle, fried rice, and rice plate section is $5.25! The Tomato Beef Chow Mein (fan ke au yok chow mein) was one of the best I ever had, and I love that dish! Order it all the time as my previous pics show haha. (perfect mix of protein, carb, and veggie. Tomato is not a veggie right? Well anyway....) and homeys crispy noodle house special (all ur leftover extra meats haha.,) was GOOD!! Both $5.25. We waddled outta there, \"Full, Dumb, and Happy.\" Sh--t, I know I'll never make \"elite\" eatin $5, payin $5, and reviewin $5 like this, but hey, I'm the real, no lie, voice of the common people. Somebody's gotta do it, n I do it cuz I love ya'll \"$5 bucks for lunch ya'll\" Aye ya ya ya hey, can't stop dancin. :)", "author": "George F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-25", "description": "This restaurant's name is Emperor Palace?  My family and I have always referred to it as \"The Cafeteria.\"  As unanimously stated, you get a lot for very little at this place, so you could afford to eat here as often as one would a cafeteria.  And, many people do, such as Chinese carpenters during lunch, locals who go so often they never even have to place an order, as their food is served hot from the kitchen when they arrive.  I usually eat in here, but getting take-out is speedy, and portions equally large.\n\nThey serve complimentary soup and tong sui/tian tang like other Chinese restaurants, but I love the five-star anise flavored fried peanuts they give you while you're waiting for the rest of your party to arrive or deciding what to order.\n\nThe \"boss lady\" doesn't seem the most friendly, but overall, the staff is very accommodating.  This one server (I don't know what his name is - sorry!) who only works there one day a week (usually Sunday nights I think) is super friendly and good at what he does.\n\nTo be fair, there are a couple cons.  You don't exactly come here for the ambiance, but c'mon, the food is delicious and the leftovers will feed you for days.  I live within walking distance so this isn't a problem for me, but I know parking in this neighborhood SUCKS, so I highly recommend you avoid driving to this place if you can help it.", "author": "Jenn C."}

I don't remember what I've ordered in the past, but tonight how will I ever forget what we ordered. Price-wise, this place is very good. \n\nI never really had a complaint until tonight. The family and I came by after the kids' doctor appointment and since we've had a good experience here before, we thought it would be a good choice since we were pretty hungry and I wasn't in the mood to try anything unfamiliar.\n\nWhy I never noticed it before, but when I walked in today, the place smelled like an old closet. No one else was eating there except a take-out customer was waiting, it was about 5:30, so probably local diners weren't home yet for dinner time. A couple of more take-out customers came in and out as we waited for our orders of broccoli beef, orange chicken and pot stickers.\n\nThe pot stickers weren't the first time I've had it but today it tasted like a burrito from Taco Bell. The broccoli beef was OK. But our biggest issue was with the orange chicken. It was all fat and skin! We tried to bring it to the attention of the only employee there (usually there would be a staff of waiters when I've eaten there). He claimed to have cooked it himself and it was all dark meat. My husband tried to reason it out: even cut it open, invited him to eat it and really admit it was what it was, and made it clear we weren't buying his claims. \n\nYes sure, we eat out and not really know what we eat but it was pretty OBVIOUS this wasn't chicken meat. I've had it better at Panda Express!  Before my husband even pointed out how there was no meat in the plate, I was already separating the pieces off my plate that didn't appear to have meat. And the little I got to eat was clearly all just  crunchy with fried starch and no meat.\n\nToo bad. One bad experience puts this restaurant off our list. There are many more in the area that we can go to next time.", "author": "Anio D."}

Being Chinese myself, I eat Chinese food every night at home with my parents. My mom is a excellent cook so when I go out for Chinese, I better get my socks rocked. \n\nMy parents started coming here when Ocean closed down. They said the food was good and I recently moved back from LA so I wasn't sure what was good anymore. \n\nThe only thing holding me back from that extra star is the consistentcy. The curry beef stew is the best beef stew that I have ever had in my life. The curry sauce is addicting and will have you eating so much rice you will end up with diabetes. The beef stew is so tender, its falls apart in your mouth. One time though, the tendons that end up in the stew was not so tender and soft. \n\nThe sticky rice is only 5 bucks and it the best sticky rice ever. Many times sticky rice gets too sticky or eating just a little can cause you to feel incredibly full. Not so with their version of sticky rice. It is the perfect balance between flavor and texture. \n\nThe chicken wings are incredible. The sauce is crazy good. I like it over the San Tung wings now but its a different flavor. The wings don't taste dried up or overly deep fried. \n\nThe beef stew incident was the only thing that prevents me from giving it all 5.

As many yelpers have already noted, they do have a $38 (or was it $36?) family meal that comes with about 9 dishes, that's hard to beat. However, as some have said, they did not have oysters the most recent time I came to this place and the waitress told us that it will be replaced with a beef dish. I'm generally not big on beef dishes so I had to substituted with Honey Walnut Shrimp but she told us that it's $4 to substitute it. But seeing as how the meal was only 40 or so anyway, I decided to let it slide. It did bug me to know that they charged $4 for it so I compared the oysters' price to the Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was a $1 difference so I found it a bit absurd that not only did they not have oysters but charged me more than they should for the substitution.\n\nThe service was also unsatisfactory as, again, what many others have said. However, it was on a holiday and she was working ALL the tables by herself and it was nearly a full house. Yes, this included taking orders, serving, answering phone orders, making sure everyone had tea, etc. I can't blame her for being frazzled and unable to treat us nicely (giving her the benefit of the doubt).\n\nThe food did come out very quickly though and the food was pretty good. I do have to take a star off for overcharging for the substitution though.

We had one of their banquet dinners--the one with two whole crabs for $118 which is a great deal--I think there were 15 dishes--crab, whole fish, fried oysters, roast chicken, pea sprouts, yummy friend rice, dried scallop soup that was delish, salted deep friend pork chops, scallops, etc.  The portions were huge so the value was certainly there and with 11 people, we had a lot of left overs.  Now for the taste--food was good, some dishes really good, others were A-OK,  So as far as Chinese restaurants go, this one gave a lot for the money with good food and the service was fine.", "author": "Nancy H."}

It's even hard to find a competitive one in SF Chinatown. It's the best choice for family dinner if you don't care about the environment and the service. The dishes served very quickly though.", "author": "dove t."}

My family and I UNFORTUNATELY ate at this restaurant. When we first arrived there were a couple of customers inside but it was mostly empty. The only person there to serve us was eating and didn't even bother to stand up up to greet us. When we ask questions about the dishes and check to see if they have clams or other seafood in stock the waitress would reply no in a rude manner as if we just insulted her. We wanted to order the $48 family dinner and it states clams as one of the dishes. My gf loves clams and my dad loves oysters, so we asked if we can substitute oysters and pay a little extra to replace clams since they don't have clams. The waitress tells us we can only substitute it with some lamb dish and they don't have oysters in stock either. We ask her if we can substitute the clam dish with some other seafood and she says it will cost at least $4 more to do that. Wow...her attitude, the policy of this restaurant, and the fact that she plain out doesn't care makes me want to leave. An extra for dollars to replace a similar seafood dish with another...rip off! She's lucky my parents were there or else we would've left. I don't think its too much of an expectation to get friendly customer service from a restaurant employee or just get the \"i don't care\" attitude from her without the rude and angry behavior.  We in no way said anything rude to her to get such harsh treatment from her. After the food was served we did let her know what we though of her rude, unacceptable behavior and that we would not be coming back nor recommend this place.\n\nBesides the terrible customer service the food was ok. Portions are smaller than similar Chinese restaurants. The food did come out of the kitchen quickly which may be indicator they didn't take much time to cook quality food. The fried chicken dish had chips with it but the chips were stale and not crunchy. The chicken had way too much salt on it. The soup tasted and looked like it was just water and a little msg. The shrimp with walnut dish was just globs of mayonnaise with small shrimps hidden inside. The best part of the meal was the end when we left. Why? Because it was over! The waitress didn't even say thank you or bye. Maybe she was annoyed that we went in when she was eating or she had a issue earlier with a different customer, or she's on her period. Whatever the reason may be there is no reason to vent that anger and rude behavior on customers that want to enjoy a dinner together. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! THE FOOD HERE IS NOT WORTH IT, AND THE SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS! I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN AND WILL MAKE SURE ALL MY FRIENDS DON'T COME HERE. I WOULD RATHER BUY THEM DINNER SOMEWHERE ELSE. If you are craving Chinese food in the Richmond neighborhood go to D&A on Clement. The food tastes better, the service is better, and they have fresh juice drinks.", "author": "Mike W."}

I eat here a lot (or at least get take-out) since it's close to my abode.  The food is usually pretty consistent.  Service is spotty, but really, what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant?  Not the cleanest place to eat, but the prices are reasonable and the food is good.", "author": "Kris L."}

Mains start around $4.50, and they usually throw in free rice and soup. The portions are so big that I've given up on trying to finish anything I order here. I eat half and take the rest home, which gives me two very cheap meals. It's cheaper and faster than cooking!", "author": "Aaron L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-04", "description": "I visited at the suggestion of a friend (Chalmers!) and was not disappointed.  As other Yelpers advised, the fried chicken is indeed succulent, yet crispy!  Pineapple fried rice is also good, and the steamed crab did not disappoint, especially at around $20 for a whole crustacean.  The only average (not bad, just average) dish was their crispy noodles.\n\nI went on a Tuesday afternoon and had no trouble getting a seat.  It was cool noting the crowd was a mix of contractors and locals who have probably been eating here several times a week for the past umpteen years.\n\nI will return here when I come back to SF.  I will still get the crab even though I'll hit up PPQ Dungeness Island as the main objective in my next SF outing.\n\nWarning: this is a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant with all the requisite diggings, including carpet that should have been changed out ca. 20 years ago.  But who cares?  You eat food off the plate, not the floor.", "author": "X. W."}

The portions are HUGE for the price you pay.  Their seafood is fresh, but the way they cooked our fresh crab (we ordered salt & pepper crab) wasn't cooked right.  They used this tempura-like batter, which wasn't really what I wanted.  The fried quail was a bit too salty.  Besides these two dishes, everything else we had ordered was decent.", "author": "Katniss B."}

When in season it's only 19.99 for 2 lobster. I would do dinner on the weekends only because I think they have a better cook for the busier weekends. When I have food there on the weeknights, it's a hit or miss with the food...can be a little bland at times.", "author": "Steven J."}

My brother, Grant and his wife, Liz (and her mama) came over and whisked me away to this tiny restaurant in the Inner Richmond District.  And,  we found in all the places to eat, my cousins from SJ on their way out the door after finishing their meal!  There was a small plate of toasted peanuts and the house soup(free) was served.  It's true their salt & pepper pork chops and chicken wings ($5.25) are tops.  We also order their Hong Kong style fried beef chow mein with bok choy ($3.95), Chinese Broccoli with Beef ($5.50), half Crispy Chicken  ($5.75). And of course, white rice (free) as well as their pot of tea (free).  Grant said if he had known how much I enjoy the Pork Meatloaf with salty fish  ($5.25) he would've ordered it.  I've learned later that this is a dish to bulk up on with your rice.  The entrees were huge and we had to have six boxes to take away.  After our dinner, the waiter bought us a sweet soupy bean dessert (free).   Ask for the Family meal style menu it ranges from $21.50 to $268.00.  Reservations for a large party. Just remember, when you order food to go, it doesn't taste as good and fresh.  I am coming back with my Wednesday Group for lunch next week!", "author": "Marian G."}

It's my family's neighborhood go to restaurant because it's convenient - walking distance/no need to look for parking, cheap, fast  - all the reasons why one would dine at a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant.  Yes, it's true you get freebies like roasted peanuts, soup of the day - you never know what to expect, and dessert usually a bean type of sweet soup.  I've tried everything here from your typical chow fun, chow mein, salted fish fried rice to their ala carte, and fixed menu items.  Our family usually goes for the $35 fixed menu (I think 5 courses) dinner and adds or substitutes dishes.  I can't say the food is always consistent, some days are better than others.  However the service is consistent - the food always comes out fast and the people are well....typical.  I will continue to come here because of convenience sake, and it does suit my Chinese food craving most of the time.", "author": "Meredith K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-19", "description": "I do not know how in the world this restaurant is rated 4 out of 5 stars. My boyfriend and I decided to try it after reading such great reviews on Yelp, but we were shocked by our experience. After seeing only one table full of people and the decor of the restaurant, we decided to order on the safe side. We ordered potstickers, kung pao chicken, and chicken fried rice, thinking these dishes were pretty generic. We thought wrong. I don't want to be very rude and say the things we really felt about the food... but let me just say this was the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant. We were pretty sure the \"chicken\" was just fat from a chicken covered in sauce, and the mystery meat in the potstickers was enough to make me sick to my stomach. I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant  in my life until last night, but it was so bad, we put cash down on the table and left as quickly as we could. All I can say is, do not eat here... and I do not know how the other reviewers' enjoyed Emperor Palace Restaurant's food as much as they wrote here on Yelp.", "author": "Megan L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-19", "description": "OMG...I died and went to hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant heaven!  I have not had an experience like this in a long while..and I'm not talking about the food, although the food was pretty decent.  First off, I was born and raised in Chinatown...home of the hole-in-the-wall, grease on the floor, rude wait staff, cheap, plentiful and decent food.  I had my fill of these type of restaurants growing up, and being the child of a cook that worked at the old Joe Jung's, I know the meaning of the words \"wok hei.\"  (For those of you that don't understand Cantonese, the best translation I can give is \"fire flavor.\")  After moving out of Chinatown, finding these types of restaurants were hard to come by....until now.....\n\nI went to this place on a lark...I was around the neighborhood for a meeting and was scouting the area for some place to eat.  This restaurant was packed at 11 am, with lots of old Chinese (Cantonese/Toishanese speaking) people.  A good sign since we \"lo wah kuei\" people are known for frequenting places whose food are not just good but friggin' cheap.  When I walked in, the heads swiveled to see what new blood walked through the door as I did not look like anybody in the restaurant.  Thank goodness for my parents insisting I speak Cantonese to them or else I wouldn't have been able to get a seat.  No one brought a menu, and it wasn't until I was moved to a smaller table (did I mention it was packed?) about 10 minutes later that I reached over to the counter and grabbed a menu that I finally \"got\" a menu.  About another five minutes later the hostess/waitress came by and asked (in broken English) what I wanted.  Replied to her in Cantonese, and she ran off to the kitchen to place the order.  In between waiting for the food that I ordered, I noticed that patrons were going into the kitchen with a plate and coming out with peanuts...a bribe from the cook to get these guys out of the kitchen?  Got my food (tofu beef) about five minutes later - HUGE portions and was told rice was coming - about two minutes later.  The flavor of the beef was great - tender, and the tofu was silky.  In the midst of eating, a shipment of food supplies came in and almost didn't make it through the very tight rows.  I was able to see fresh vegetables and some still kicking fish.\n\nAll in all the experience was something that I haven't had in over five years.  I knocked it down one star as it took over 10 minutes to pay the bill.  Waitress didn't give an actual ticket on the total price of the food and was only told of the price verbally upon her throwing a couple of boxes for me to put my leftovers in.  All-in-all if you want the \"real\" Chinese hole-in-the-wall restaurant experience outside of Chinatown, this is definitely the place to go!", "author": "J H."}
