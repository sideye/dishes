We made reservation the day before but even with the reservation, we still couldn't get our table on the time they wrote us down for... and we just need to go to catch our flight. That's why I am giving a 4 instead of 5 star review. Well... actually... I am taking one star out also because the shui mai was very dry and almost tasted like those supermarket frozen ones... kind of disappointing. But they are keeping the rest of those 4 stars because everything else was great. The sticky rice in the lotus leaves was probably one of the best I have ever had in California. The rice is fragrant, sticky, but not mushed together and too wet like most dim sum places would have it. Again, I love their tables at the atrium. I almost liked it there more than being inside the real restaurant. That ceiling waterfall was just great!", "author": "Sharon H."}

I've been to Yank Sing multiple times before for lunch and brunch as I am a huge dim sum fan, and my previous lunch experiences were pretty good. But also quite a while ago (at least a year ago). I ordered Yank Sing to go today and was sorely disappointed. \n\n$11.23 for one BBQ pork bun and an order of shrimp dumplings (4 piece set). The har gow were pretty small. They've mastered the art of making them consistently the same shape and form, but the flavor was just very average. Definitely not worth $8 for 4 pieces. The BBQ pork bun was made well, but the proportion of pork to bun was pitiful :( \n\nI'm gonna stick with Good Mong Kok bakery and other places in Chinatown from now on. I just didn't want to walk all the way to Chinatown since I work by the Ferry building. Definitely won't be returning for a weekday lunch.", "author": "Saachi G."}

However, I don't think that warrants the price... which is like exponentially more expensive than most other dim sum places. Honestly, I think ton kiang, which is already expensive but much less so, is on par with yank sing. Other mentions include Hong Kong lounge and dragon beaux... all of which are around the same quality but are much much cheaper. \n\nThe staff is really good here and the food is pretty good as well. They have the smaller dim sum with the thinner skin (my preferred style.) Its also clean and a great place to take tourists/ out of town guest that you would like to impress. I wouldn't say that there was anything particularly memorable but also nothing offensive. All in all, it's not bad.", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

The serving style here is a bit different - they come in carts and offer you food instead of taking your order right at the start of the meal so you end up eating more spontaneously. \n\nWe ordered and shared the savory vegetable, mushroom, spinach, and pea dumplings. All the dumplings are great and have great texture, but the savory vegetable one stands above all. It is full of flavor, but not too spicy. I'd recommend not dipping it with any soy sauce or mustard that they give on the side because then you might miss the flavor. I also really enjoyed the mushroom dumplings - they are not as flavorful but the mushrooms are extremely juicy and still taste great. The spinach and pea dumplings are good too, but not as tasty (although they are a bit healthier). I would recommend dipping them in a little soy sauce or mustard. We also ordered the silken tofu and although I'm not a huge fan of eating tofu straight up, this tofu was extremely good. It was very soft and went down smoothly. The sauce that the tofu was in was extremely delicious - very savory, but not too spicy. It also didn't feel too oily. For dessert I got the egg custard tart (I actually ate it afterwards and it was cold) and I was blown away. It was my first time trying it, but it was so good. The crust was very flaky and tasty, and the egg curd was very soft and delicious. It was not too sweet, but you could still taste the egg. I highly recommend getting white tea to drink with all of these items. \n\nWe ended up loving this meal so much that we went to the other Yank Sing location in SF a week later. The service could be a bit faster, but it is a great spot to come for lunch. Make sure to make a reservation before because it does get super crowded.", "author": "Sampath D."}

They keep adding more tables and more space to the original establishment and have opened up a nearby satellite.\n\nYou still can't get a table.\n\n* * *\n\nSamuel C's tips on making the most of your trip to Yank Sing.\n\n1) Definitely definitely definitely make reservations.\n\n2) IGNORE the menu.\n\nThe menu has maybe 50% of what they are serving.\n\nWhat matters is what is on the carts. \n\nWhat matters even more is what is on the carts passing by you personally.\n\n3) The atrium where the \"outdoor\" seating is for Yank Sing has the greatest indoor waterfall in the history of existence. It is a shower of water that falls from the center of the middle of the atrium four full stories on to a rectangle of floor below. It is breathtaking.\n\nBut Paradise has its price.\n\nIf you sit out by the atrium, you get a much much smaller volume of food carts than you get if you sit inside the actual restaurant.\n\nService is wonderful on the inside and middling to poor on the outside.\n\nThe waterfall is dazzling - but frankly I am there for the dim sum.\n\nIf it is a choice between food carts whenever I want them and a waterfall, I will take the food carts every time.\n\n4) Their soup dumplings are famous.\n\nThere are nine million things on the carts I like better than their soup dumplings ...\n\nBut that just means the soup dumplings are only fabulous,\n\nWhile the other dishes are mega-ultra-beyond-amazing fabulous.\n\n5) I can't even count all the dishes I have had at Yank Sing that have sent me over the edge of bliss.\n\nBut shrimp shumai, mushroom dumplings, barbecued pork slices and shrimp puffs would be high on my list.\n\n6) If you get egg custard tarts for dessert, you want them the nano-second they come out of the oven. \n\nA fresh hot egg custard tart blows away a regular on-the-cart egg custard tart. \n\nIt takes 30 minutes to make those - so put in an order for them soon after you get seated. They will show up just as you are starting to get unbelievably full. Your meal will end perfectly.\n\n7) The place is insanely expensive. \n\nIf you find you have a deep liking for the place, start looking for bankers you can date.\n\n* * *\nJames Beard knew his Chinese food. His childhood cook was of Chinese extraction. He spent significant amounts of time in San Francisco, New York and the Far East.\n\nThe James Beard Foundation gave the award to this place, rather than James Beard doing the picking himself.\n\nBut I have little doubt he would have approved of this choice.\n\nI am actually glad I don't live in San Francisco.\n\nIf I lived in San Francisco, I would want to eat here all the time.\n\nIf I did that, I would get as fat as James Beard.", "author": "Samuel C."}

I love dim sum but sometimes it is one of the more stressful of dining experiences. With seemingly an infinite variety of choices it can be overwhelming and I hate to fall back and just wait for the BBQ pork bun cart. Sometimes that language barrier gets in the way and I have to ask the server to repeat themselves praying I hear a familiar word in the description. Sometimes said server gets annoyed and rudely leaves after you just end up saying no the cart offerings. All that being said I had a hella good time at Yank Sing!\n\nThis was recommended by a cousin as one of her favorite places and considering she is an SF local we said sure despite the average star rating on Yelp. I think one of the major reasons people complain is that it's \"lack of authenticity.\" It's not located in Chinatown but in the Financial District. As such it caters to the business crowds. You won't get the \"Chinatown\" feel with a lot of power suits around you and the lack of Chinese families waiting for a table. But you know what, I did that at my last trip to SF and THAT dim sum experience sucked sesame seed balls (see my review on Lai Hong Lounge). Is it overpriced for dim sum? A bit. Total bill for a party of 6 was $280. However this was basically our breakfast and lunch having flown in that morning at 9:00 and doing some touristy stuff to almost 1:30. In other words we were starving. \n\nHighlight dish was the honey grilled sea bass. I loved it. Tender flesh with a slightly sweet sauce with just enough char from the grill. Now I need to mention. Neither of my kids like cooked fish. I've tried frying, grilling, baking. At other restaurants they totally turn a blind eye to fish unless oddly enough if it is raw. But my bold one decided to take a bite of the sea bass dish. We ended up ordering two more plates which for sure pushed the bill but was worth every cent to see her enjoying a new discovery. There was also a second preparation of the sea bass as, wait for it, salt and f-ing pepper sea bass. We just flat out ordered two of those without hesitation. Both sea bass were so good I'm tearing up. \n\nDeep fried claw crabs were a hit. My sister's one request in this trip was crab. Her exact words were \"I'm in heaven.\" \n\nPan fried Turnip cake was superb. Moist yet not too soggy with ample amounts of Chinese sausage mixed in giving an almost bacon taste. \n\nXLB were done right. The soup dumplings were loaded with a delicious broth. \n\nWe ordered some other standards like shrimp in rice roll, pork shui mai, BBQ pork buns, and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Hit, hit, hit. \n\nOne sad miss was the Peking duck. I've never actually seen this done as dim sum where they make a bun per person. My kids and niece ordered one each. As per my daughter \"the skin and bun were good but the meat was dry.\" \n\nService was exemplary which you would hope as a place pushing itself as upscale. Kind. Very attentive. Even if you told a server no thanks, they graciously thanked you with a smile. I also noticed the English spoken was pretty clear, again a by-product if location. They were also very efficient, if you asked a server for a dish they weren't responsible for they had little microphones that they spoke into to direct the correct server your way! It was like a Secret Service set up lol. \n\n\nExtra notes \n\n- If you are in a rush or don't want to pay too much there is also an Yank Sing Express for take out adjacent to restaurant \n-there is a parking structure and the restaurant does validate up to two hours \n\nThis was a seriously a great treat for the family and despite the price we would do it again.", "author": "Jeff R."}

I will say that I'm a fan of their hot sauce (try the hot sauce!) but not a fan of their prices. For dim sum, this is PRICEY. The bill for 4 people was $151 before tip and because their dim sum came in smaller than normal servings, we weren't as full as we usually are. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Pork siu mye: Not bad, not as flavorful as I am used to though. I prefer my siu mye to have a yellow egg wrapper to lend more flavor but this one used a plain wrapper and it tasted just alright.\n- Shrimp dumpling: Your normal hargow. Nothing too special.\n- Beancurd roll: This was one of my favorite items here. There are 2 rolls and they are way smaller than the other dim sum places but the sauce is so amazing!\n- Shanghai pork dumpling: $14 for 6 pieces. Kind of pricey but it tasted amazing! Better than Ding Tai Fung imo\n- Sweet rice dumpling: These are like deep fried balls of mochi with a savory mushroom and meat filling inside. It's definitely worth trying out!\n- Fried crab claw: Also one of my favorite items. Each plate comes with 2 crab claws and it's AMAZING. It's fried to perfection, the shrimp/crab paste has a nice texture, and theres a whole crab claw buried within. This plate also costs $14 and we ordered a few not knowing how pricey it was. Oops.\n- Steamed spareribs: You can't go wrong with this dish! Bite sized spareribs steamed in some savory sauce... SO GOOD.\n\nDefinitely had sticker shock when the bill came out but I think it was worth a try. The waiters here are super attentive and their english is amazing. Parking was a breeze as well since they have a designated parking structure. \n\nOverall, I like this place but I won't come back anytime soon for their dim sum. I will come back to pick up a jar of hot sauce though. That sauce is amazing!", "author": "Shannon C."}

Unquestionably, the prices are significantly higher than you'd find at a lower-end, no frills Chinatown kind of place, but the setting is definitely more upscale and clean. Always busy, this dim-sum-centric restaurant is both tourist and local-friendly. English is spoken here by the waitstaff, as well as the ladies who run the pushcarts throughout the restaurant, \"hawking\" their delicious delights.\n\nWhat really cinched it as a 4-star for me was the very good service we received on this visit.  Specifically, I was having difficulty deciphering exactly what the numerous charges were for on our bill.  Believe me, it isn't an easy feat after you have ordered about 15 different dim sum items. When I asked one of the waitstaff (maybe a floor manager) about this, she explained in detail what each and every charge on the bill was for.  Moreover, she was very patient in doing so, and didn't seem at all perturbed or bothered by our request for a detailed explanation of the charges.  Let me tell you, this kind of response would be a definite rarity in most dim sum restaurants, particularly if you aren't fluent in Chinese!  \nI was very much impressed by this!!  Additionally, Hubby is MSG-phobic, and the staff has always been upfront about which items contain and don't contain MSG.  For some with a similar phobia, know that even soy sauce contains a slight amount of MSG, but so does your can of Campbell's soup.  \n\nYou'll find all the vast majority of basic dim sum items here, and I really like almost everything.  However, since they have a huge tourist clientele, unfortunately, they don't have some of the very traditional items, like the Chinese steamed rice cakes (bhak tong go), which is one of my favorites.  \n\nThe push carts are another reason I like Yank Sing, and is a definite plus, as opposed to ordering off a menu.  There's nothing like visually seeing a dish to determine if it presents itself exactly like you expected. Plus, the push cart ladies speak just enough English to explain what goodies are on their carts.  \n\nDownsides were the wait time, difficult street parking and somewhat limited variety of dim sum.  I brought the lack of variation of dim sum items to the attention of the waitstaff, and was told that in the summer, they should have more items rolling around on the carts, since they anticipate a bump from their tourist business.  Makes sense.  We were pleased enough with this visit to return again, and will, but sooner next time...", "author": "Lori N."}

There are a few options here that you can't get anywhere else or that just make it way better (in my opinion) compared to other dim sum spots: the curry puff, duck bun (they bring you the bun and duck with crispy skin separately to diy and use as much hoisin sauce and scallions as you'd like), jin doy (their sesame bun is made with sweet potato), and stuffed crab claw. You can't go wrong with their fried rice, shrimp dumpling, gai lan (Chinese broccoli), steamed pork bun, stuffed eggplant, or siu mai.

That was just the beginning. We ate in the inner dining room as opposed to the noisier plaza area that was very busy on this Sunday afternoon. \nGreat meal ahead!  The many carts filled with various meat, seafood and vegetable dimsum and other small portions of good foods were all very GOOD. I could have passed on the overly fatty barbecued pork, but other than that the good service, nice environment, wide range of choices and great accompanying sauces were tops!\nWould I return, YES...and if you want this kind of dining experience I recommend you give it a try. \nThe show we enjoyed at the 42nd Street Moon theatre was also a winner.

In my opinion, the one thing that sets this dim sum apart from many cheaper places is that it's not oily at all and all the dimsum are very well wrapped. For example, the rice noodles rolls with shrimp are perfectly wrapped because the shrimp doesn't easily fall out and each piece has the right amount of noodles. The skin for the shiu mai and har gow never fall apart and are an absolute delight to eat. The only thing I regret ordering here was the green onion pancake. It almost looks like a donut, but it was so oily / heavy. The mango pudding dessert was quite nice. A layer of condensed milk is added and it isn't too sweet. \n\nIf you can get over the fact that the dimsum here is quite expensive, the quality is actually quite good.

Some of the favorites were- peking duck, lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice, steamed and baked pork buns, shrimp dumplings, and of course fried sesame balls and egg tarts for desert. YUM. There were a few dishes we ordered that had gotten cold on the cart, but for the most part everything was delicious. \n\nIf you've never had dim sum before- dim sum restaurants are usually louder/more chaotic environments as carts are rolled around the dinning room with a variety of dumplings and small plates to choose from. I am familiar with dim sum, but I can see how this would be very overwhelming for a newbie. If you are new to dim sum, I would recommend doing a bit of research online if you like to know what you are ordering/eating.

We texted a friend who remembered the place he enjoyed so much, so here we were. \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nLocated in an alleyway-like side street in the Embarcadero, it's not a huge place, but sports a good number of indoor tables along with a covered outdoor patio. \n\nMENU:\nDim sum and traditional Chinese (ask for additional menus). \n\nFOOD:\nPeking Duck with Bun - $6.95, 1-piece.  I thought I was getting a plate of duck but instead received a single bao bun which I don't care for.  It was very mainstream and came with the traditional sauce and veggies.  \n\nMushroom Dumpling - $6.35, 3-pieces.  The server said they were shrimp and mushrooms but neither could be detected.  It had the taste and consistency of fish cake and needed shoyu for flavor. \n\nChinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - $7.60.  AKA choy sum.  They were served chilled, a first for me.  Good portion, fresh and steamed perfectly but could've used more oyster sauce drizzled on top.  \n\nPotstickers - $11.70, 6-pieces.  Pricey but they are of the larger variety and stuffed full with a savory pork mixture.  No sauce was available sans for shoyu, vinegar and chili oil.  \n\nHoney Baked Seabass - $21.75, one tiny piece.  Holy pricey for the portion size!?  The small, boneless filet was insanely tender like butterfish and finished with a slightly sweet-savory honey sauce.  Very tasty but not worth the price.  \n\nMinced Chicken in Lettuce Cup - $6.35 per cup.  That's right, just one leaf of an iceberg lettuce will set you back that much.  The chicken mixture was generous in portion size, tasty and included pine nuts, shiitake mushrooms and bacon. \n\nShanghai Kurobuta Pork Dumplings - $14, 6-pieces.  Sold as their house specialty, be careful when consuming them as they squirt out juice.  It's best to pop the whole dumpling in your mouth.  Inside is a small helping of pork mixture surrounded by its steamed juices which were light in flavor. \n\nChicken Feet - $5.85.  I got about four feet, chopped in halves and finished in a non-spicy chili oil sauce.  Tender and tasty but I've had better at Legend Restaurant in Honolulu.  \n\nPork & Shrimp Siu Mye - $7.60, 4-pieces.  We couldn't detect the pork, but the shrimp was visible.  Moist but bland.  Pass the shoyu, please.  \n\nEgg Custard Tart - $12.70, 4-pieces.  My favorite Chinese dessert!  The crust was light, flaky and buttery.  The custard was filling was very good.  \n\nOrange Jello - $6.35, 4-pieces.  I have no idea how they make these, but orange-flavored Jello was cleverly molded onto actual orange skins.  The Jello consistency was thicker and more gritty than traditional Jello.  The flavor was refreshing, almost like actual orange juice.  \n\nSERVICE:\nEveryone was so professional and patient, unlike your typical Chinese joints.  No pushiness or short-talk, but very welcoming and friendly.  \n\nOVERALL:\nQuality cuisine but very light on flavors.  Severely overpriced.  Great service.", "author": "Vince N."}

If you've never had dim sum before where you take items off of a cart and they stamp a card on your table to indicate what you've ordered, I would strongly advise you to ask for the price of an item before you accept a steamer full of food. It's a pretty bad feeling when you pick up a plate of mediocre dumplings priced at $2 a bite. There are large plates (fried rice or noodles for example) you can order as well, but you'll have to wave somebody down and ask for that additional menu - it's not given to you by default. \n\nThe food overall was just mediocre; nothing in particular stood out to me.

Flavor was okay. \n\nCurry pot pie (1/5) - it's pale in comparison to other curry puffs I've had. The most unusual thing though is after trying all of the other items, my palette was very confused trying this. What's a curry puff doing in a Chinese restaurant?

I guess many many things have changed in SF and so did this place.  I brought my friend here for a Saturday lunch.  Everything here went downhill.\n\nFood.  \nDisappointed. \nThis used to be my favorite place to get dim sum and xiao long biao in the city.  We ordered the shrimp dumping and the pork and shrimp siu mye.  The skin on both were very thick, dried, and very tough.  Skin texture was very hard and tough to bite in.  It's the \"I couldn't even stab it in with my chopsticks\" kind of tough.  The skin used to be very thin, moist, slightly chewy, and freshly steamed.  We also ordered the Peking duck, xiao long biao, and other stuff, but they were just okay.  Food tasted old, not fresh.  Also, I've had better xiao long biao elsewhere in the Sunset District for a much lower price and bigger portion. \n\nCustomer service. \nMinimal to none.  \nAnd sort of rude.  No table-busing or tea-refilling.  Finished and dirty dishes were left on our table till the end.  We had to box up leftovers with table full of dirty dishes with no space.  Mind you, it's a very small table.  One cart lady forgot to give a sauce that was supposed to go with one of the common dishes I ordered here a zillion times before.  When I politely asked for it, she gave me a lecture on that sauce doesn't go with that dish here and how they already mixed the sauce in beforehand.  She then went on herself for a minute or two and finally admitted herself that she was just forgotten to bring it out from the kitchen.  So she said she had to go get it from the kitchen (in a pissed-off tone).  I was like okay.  I'd just do without the sauce then.  But then she asked me if that meant I would want her to get it from the kitchen.  Ok, wait a minute.  Is this a trick question? Does that mean I should get up to go the kitchen to get it myself?  Hey but I don't work here.  How could one simply ordering a dish became so complicated?\nOkay.  No big deal.  People could have off-days on job.  So I decided to move on without THE sauce.  She came back with the sauce herself a while later eventually, remarking \"here is your sauce!\"  loudly.  The whole scene made me feel very uncomfortable as if I was being an as***le to her, which I didn't.  \n\nOther stuff.\nParking was confusing and tough.  People were fighting for parking downstairs.  There were cussing and f-bombs.  Valet or no valet parking was the question. Then, waiting and seeing no one to go to for picking up your car afterwards.  \nPrice wise, the whole experience was pricey like I remembered, but it's not worthy to come here anymore.  Our bill with tips was about $100 for seven items for 2 people.  I am very sensitive to MSG.  This meal made me very sleepy afterwards because of the MSG.  \n\nConclusion: \nMy memory for this place is now full of disappointments, confusion, complication, and lies (about a sauce).  And I don't like being lied to. \n\nSeems like this place caters to Saleforce people and tourists only.  Enjoy your meal here if you're either.  If you're neither, stay away.\n\nOne star for the clean environment.  Another star for the waterfall outfront.\n\nThis would be my very last time.", "author": "Toasty H."}

The To Go arm of Yank Sing in Rincon just plain annoys me. The service is spotty, and if you stray from the narrow, limited menu good luck. They will forget your order.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-15", "description": "Some restaurants in life are just worth forking over a lot of money for. When it comes to dim sum joints, I usually prefer to pay less for A- quality than lose my wallet over an A+ experience. My uncle recently took me to Yank Sing, a favorite of his back when he lived in San Francisco, and I found this place to be the perfect example of an upscale dim sum restaurant that offers quality atmosphere, but only a slightly above average dining experience. \n\nYank Sing is located on Spear Street within Downtown San Francisco's Financial District. I actually find this place to be very convenient for several reasons. For one, Yank Sing is nearby both freeways (i.e. Highways 80/101) and BART Stations (i.e. Embarcadero), and so getting here shouldn't be TOO bad. But of course, be prepared to face HELLA traffic on weekdays because everyone is going to and from work. Furthermore, I like this spot because Yank Sing actually has a parking structure THAT THEY VALIDATE! This is such a rarity in a city that charges egregious amounts of money for parking. If you plan on coming, I highly encourage you to make a reservation. We came around noon on a Sunday and would have waited HOURS if we hadn't called beforehand. \n\nAs a dim sum restaurant (or deem sum??? as their menu spells it), Yank Sing will have pretty much all the stuff you are probably accustomed to ordering. For example, this place will have Hargow, Siu Mai, and even Xiaolong Bao. In terms of pricing, it's fairly expensive ($$$ signs!). Even though prices on the menu don't look that bad (everything is like 40-50% more expensive than other dim sum joints), it really adds up. We ended up getting an assortment of dishes, some of which I've highlighted below:\n\n-HARGOW (7/10): Shrimp Hargow was quite good! The pieces were decently sized, shrimp was filling, and the outer layer seemed like it was steamed well. \n\n-FRIED TURNIP CAKE (9/10): I love the fact that the turnip cake was only lightly fried; it wasn't overly crispy, and it tasted SO GOOD with sate and soy sauce. \n\n-XIAOLONG BAO (7/10): Dude, I recommend just coming to dim sum restaurants for soup dumplings over Din Tai Fung anyday. The ones here tasted great! Meat was savory, and soup was a great compliment. I felt like pieces could have been bigger, and the dumplings weren't quite as hot as they should've been. Still fresh though?\n\n-SIU MAI (7/10): Siu Mai was good but not spectacular. If you love this popular staple, I think you'll find that it's a good option at Yank Sing. \n\n-CHIVE DUMPLINGS (7/10): The same applied for the Siu Mai. If you're looking for another dish to compliment what you already have, chive dumplings are a great choice that's light and not overly heavy. \n\n-TOFU SKIN ROLL (9/10): This place has really good tofu skin rolls! The pieces were quite small, but they tasted GREAT! The soup filling inside was SO GOOD. \n\n-POTSTICKERS (9/10): Just like the turnip cake, I thought potstickers were fried really well. They give you at least 8-9 pieces, which is great if you're hungry. \n\n-ATMOSPHERE (10/10): If you only care about the ambiance, Yank Sing is definitely THE PLACE TO BE. I recommend getting a seat outside because you are in a GIANT OPEN AREA with a freaking waterfall that comes down from the heavens (jk from the ceiling). It's so cool! I feel like it's worth coming here once just to have that experience. It's unique, something you don't find at my restaurants in the city. \n\n-SERVICE (7/10): Service here was pretty aight when we came. Despite the fact that this place gets HELLA TRAFFIC, people working here are quite responsive. I love the fact that there's a separate station for the outside seating area, and so it's pretty easy to flag down workers when you need something. This place also serves dim sum on traditional carts, but given the smaller menu (compared to other restaurants), there aren't too many. \n\nShoutout to my uncle for taking me to Yank Sing because I would never have come across this place (especially with the $$$ o my) otherwise. Although the food was decent and the atmosphere was fantastic to say the least, I don't think this place is worth the high price tag. You are probably better off going to other places in Chinatown that offer food that's just as good for a much lower cost. But hey, at least they validate parking? For those reasons, I give Yank Sing a \"tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-09", "description": "Despite hearing about the higher price tag, I wanted to try Yank Sing out since it's so popular. And taste wise, everything ended up being pretty good. \n\nThe service is another story. Okay okay, I know...I get that most Chinese places are not exactly known for their quality service, and this is kind of a given. This was on another level though. Service was super inconsistent, and Yank Sing was clearly inefficiently staffed for the busy weekend time. \n\nWe got there at 10 on a Satuday and were seated promptly. It was still pretty empty inside the restaurant. Service was great for the first 30 minutes or so, with our water constantly refilled and dim sum carts regularly making their rounds. Towards the middle of our meal when it started getting busy, things went downhill pretty fast. We waited a while for a cart to come around, but we kept only seeing one that wasn't coming towards our table. So we ordered with a server. Then waited. And waited. Then saw our order of dumplings go to another table. We waved another server down about the order, who admitted that they accidentally gave it to another party. We got our dumplings after a little while longer, then we were soon ready for dessert. \n\nWe ordered an order of lotus seed buns with a server. 15 minutes later, the restaurant was almost completely full, and we had no buns. We asked a server for an update, and he said \"It should be 5 more minutes.\" Another 10 minutes later...still no buns. We asked the same server again, and he apologized, saying that it takes 15 minutes to make and should be out soon, which is fine, except we were waiting much longer than 15 minutes as it is. Another 5 minutes later (now about 30 minutes after we ordered), still no buns. We decided to just take our slip up to the front and pay our bill.\n\nFor two people, the bill was about $70. Definitely a higher price tag than other dim sum places, though to be fair, it's in Rincon Center, which offers a decently nice ambiance, and most of the other dim sum places outside of the Richmond area are pretty expensive too. Some items do have some particularly outrageous price points though, like the peking duck which is $6.75 for 1 piece of duck and a small bao, or the 4 sesame balls for $12. \n\nFour stars for the taste of the food (that we got anyway), knocked down to 2.5 or 3 stars with the price point and service coming into play.", "author": "Sara L."}

We got a table towards the back by the bathroom where the food carts come out of. Finding this place can be tricky but just follow the signs leading you into a courtyard and look for the building that reads \"Rincon One.\" Looking in, you'll see a bunch of tables set up banquet style in the middle of what appears to be a lobby and to the back right is where you check in. \n\nThe food was great. They've got all the dim sum favorites from shrimp har gow, shrimp and pork siu mai, shrimp and chive siu mai, and they've even got delicious xiao long bao (soup dumplings). One of my favorites was the plump fillet of sea bass that flakes beautifully and melts in your mouth with a delightfully savory-sweet glaze. Crab croquettes and cold Chinese broccoli were a couple more of the dishes we tried, as well as a sort of kung pao type chicken and fried potstickers. We finished the meal with the egg tarts, which have always been a childhood favorite of mine. \n\nThe service wasn't bad. They were all pretty friendly wait staff and the ladies with the carts did a good job circling around considering how large this place is.

We couldn't get anyone to let us place an order of food. Food almost HAS to be ordered because the walk ways are so narrow, the carts cannot get through so you'll never get food. It took us almost 20 minutes to flag someone down to place an order. 30 minutes later, only half of our order came out. And some of the food that was delivered to us wasn't even ours. But we were so f*-ing hungry, that we took it and ate it anyways. Shoutout to Ed who made sure we got SOME of our orders and was the most attentive waiter. Everyone else needs to be better trained. Only upside here is that everyone speaks English so you don't have to worry about a language barrier like at other dim sum places.\n\nYank Sing, you thoroughly disappointed me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-07", "description": "TLDR - \n\nCan anyone tell me why Yank Sing spells dim sum \"deem sum\"?\n\nFor a really expensive dim sum spot, I was expecting something a little fancier. Service is maybe above the typical dim sum restaurant, but the ambiance here was more or less the same, so I'm not really sure what warrants a price tag of 2x the normal dim sum prices. The dim sum is good, but it's also not anything mindblowingly better than your average-priced dim sum spot. If it weren't for a work lunch, I honestly would probably never come to Yank Sing.\n\nI came with a large group so we got to order a LOT of items. They have carts here so you can do it the right way and order from those, or if you're more comfortable ordering from a menu and waiter, that's an option too.\n\nMost of the dishes were pretty standard, but there were a few that I especially enjoyed more:\n* Baked BBQ Pork Bun ($7.35 for 3) - delicious bbq pork filling and super fluffy, slightly sweet bun\n* Shanghai Kurobuta Pork Dumpling / Xiao Long Bao ($14 for 6) - relatively thin skin that holds the dumpling well, lots of soup\n* Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai ($7.35 for 4) - very tender and flavorful\n* Egg Custard Tart ($12.05 for 4) - incredibly silky custard; flaky tart\n\nWe also ordered:\n* Steamed Rice Noodle Rolls ($9.15 for 3)\n* Steamed Spareribs ($5.65)\n* Shrimp & Chive Dumplings ($6.15 for 3)\n* Shrimp Dumplings ($7.35 for 4)\n* Peking Duck ($6.75 for 1 piece) - ridiculously expensive for 1 piece of duck and 1 bao, but at least the duck was good\n* Turnip Cake ($5.65 for 3)\n* Snap Peas in Chili Sauce ($7.35)\n* Sauteed String Beans ($9.15)\n* Honey Walnut Prawn ($13.55 for 6)\n* Honey Glazed Walnut Salad ($12.05) - not something I've seen at dim sum before. It was basically a pile of purple cabbage in some sort of dressing with honey glazed walnuts. Nice and refreshing if you're looking for something lighter\n* Szechuan Chicken ($9.70) - I feel like this isn't something normally offered at dim sum either\n* Phoenix Tailed Shrimp ($13.55 for 4) - nicely fried/crispy and very meaty\n* Sesame Ball ($12.05 for 4) - filled with yellow bean puree instead of the usual red bean but just as good\n\nFor 14 people, we ended up spending about $750 ($53/person). Honestly, the only reason I can think of for people coming here is to show that they have money to spend. The food was good but not spectacular or special, and the ambiance doesn't match up to the prices. Business lunches don't even really make sense for me here since the ambiance is the same as big dim sum restaurants in Chinatown. I guess if you're craving dim sum specifically in the Embarcadero area..\n\nDo yourself a favor and go somewhere else for dim sum.

The first thing I noticed was the Health Inspection ranking for this restaurant was significantly higher than a lot of the dingier places in Chinatown which made us both feel a little better about eating here. I've never had real dim sum before so this was an introductory experience for me. At Yank Sing, they serve their dim sum with carts and you basically just pick what you want as the cart passes by your table then they add it to your bill. We had the shanghai dumplings, beancurd roll, shrimp dumplings, egg custard tart, steamed bbq pork bun, and baked bbq pork bun. As I said before I've never had traditional dim sum before so I can't really give great input on the food. In my opinion it all tasted pretty good and the waitstaff was very helpful if you weren't sure what to get from the carts. The baked bbq pork buns are a must, the flavor and texture was great. I also really enjoyed the shanghai dumplings (it's soup inside of the dumpling which was very interesting).\n\nOur bill ended up being around $70 but I felt like we were really paying for the overall experience as well. This isn't some questionable restaurant in a back alley, it's located in a nice building near the financial district.

It was also expensive but I was dining alone and threw caution to the wind, sampling whatever I wanted.  I spent $80, but could easily have shared that with one or two others.  \n\nI started with Shanghai dumplings, delicate little baskets with soup inside.  I had to repeat that to my server to make sure I'd heard it correctly.  Soup in a dumpling?  I gingerly loaded one onto a spoon, drizzled it with red sauce and slurped it into my mouth.  Wow, what an intoxicatingly delicious treat.  Despite eating alone I had no trouble enjoying all six dumplings by myself!

It's tender and delicious and it's large enough to provide an entr\u00e9e size portion for three people.  So worth it.    \n\nI also sampled chicken satay.  Mine were tender and tasty, but a familiar item that didn't deliver the excitement of my dumplings.  Steamed pork buns were fluffy and stuffed with steaming honey glazed bbq pork, an appealing item to a Southern boy.  Stuffed crab claws were impressively large, but were slightly doughy and not crisp enough for my taste.       \n\nThe most disappointing thing about Yank Sing is the hours.  It's only open for lunch, from 11am - 3pm.  How I'd love to come at night with a group and sample even more treats on the menu.", "author": "Will T."}

Compared to nearly every other Chinese food establishment, what sets Yank Sing apart is that their dim sum captures explosive flavors without making you feel like your guzzling down teaspoons of oil or lard.  It's rare to eat as much Chinese food as your wallet will allow without coming away feeling like a pork bun yourself. Yank Sing's dim sum just tastes so much better, purer and healthier than other dim sum establishments.\n\nI just went there this past Sunday for me and my friend's weekly dim sum brunch. Weekend dim sum brunch is one of those classic \"Asian American people doing Asian American things\" that we try to incorporate in our lives as adults to make us feel more connected to our ethnic roots and to atone for the B's we may or may not have gotten many years ago in high school. Jokes aside, Yank Sing continues to have the best dim sum in the city.  Their steamed Shanghai Dumplings are the juiciest, most balanced dumplings you'll find without going to China. Their pork buns are a must order. What I love about Yank Sing's dim sum is that in addition to having traditional dim sum carted around, they also have smaller versions of their specialty dishes that make the rounds as well (I'm mainly talking about their fleshy cuts of sea bass that are plated beautifully). \n\nThe vibes of Yank Sing are awesome--loud, buzzy, energy in the air of happy people knocking back dumplings with friends and family. The one downside of Yank Sing is that it is very pricey. Our meal this past weekend for two came out to roughly $75. Is the food worth it? Absolutely...it's the best dim sum in the city. But just keep in mind that it's not the place to go if you're looking for cheap Chinese food in large quantities.", "author": "Max S."}

The place gets so busy that they use the outside restaurant area as seating.  Fine with me since it means faster service and it's actually nice sitting outside with that water falling from the ceiling.  The workers have walkie talkies on them so they can communicate with each other.  Very organized if you're asking for certain dishes.  What I love about dim sum is that as soon as you sit down you start eating and that's what happened here.  Their shumai was a bit tough but not anything to really complain about.

Our water glasses were always full and we were hardly ever waiting until another cart went by.

This is definitely a good first Dim Sum place to go to if you've never been before. You get the whole experience and an array of plates that keep coming. I knocked off a star because I felt like they should be bringing in more different dishes, since the menu is so vast. We kept seeing the same carts come by and ask us if we wanted some of the same things again and again. Although most of the time we actually did say yes (because the food is really that good, I could eat the same dumpling plate and not be bored if I wanted to) it be nice to see more come by on carts and be offered than having to order. You can order a plate on the menu to come, but it's always nice to see how it looks at first as well. Very rarely did we see new items and if we did it was because someone ordered it specially. I also think some items are weirdly expensive. The four sesame balls for dessert are around 12 dollars! Don't come to this place expecting you won't spend a lot, but that compared to other items like the dumplings being cheaper does not make sense.\nAny of the shrimp dumplings are great and so are the shanghai ones. The bbq pork buns are good if you order them so they come out piping hot! And the duck is a great dish to try something new. It comes with a bun and some veggies and spread so you can make your own 'sandwich' bun. This is by far the perfect place for large parties or even a date. You get a really cool experience with lots of new dishes. And unlimited tea!! Come early so you don't have to wait as long or make a reservation. They also have Yank Sing take out next door. So if you really liked a certain dish or wanted dessert elsewhere you can leave and head straight there. \nHighly recommend this place!", "author": "Melanie D."}

One thing I love about this place is you can sit down and be eating within the minute that you sit down. Also don't forget to make a reservation! It's very easy on opentable. \n\nYank sing probably has the best Xiao long bao (steamed soup dumplings) in SF other than the recently opened Ding Tai Fung, but that's in the South Bay and the wait is crazy long. \n\nOther must gets at Yank sing are the taro puffs, shrimp dumping and rice in lotus leaf (lo mai gai).\n\nTheir steamed and baked pork buns are ok, my favorite steamed pork buns in the city are at MY China. MY China has really good dim sum but there aren't many choices versus Yank Sing has carts and carts filled with different dishes for you to choose from. \n\nThe bad thing is it'll cost around $30/person versus other dim sum places in Richmond will only be $15 for the same amount of food.", "author": "Rohenne L."}

We did not even eat that much, and for quality/quantity to price ratio, places like Koi palace in Milpitas outperforms Yank Sing.\n\nNonetheless, aside from the xiao long bao which still needs improvement in recipe ($14/6 pcs!), everything was very tasty, held together greatly and was satisfying to the tummy. The highlight was the honey glazed sea bass, sooo delicate and lightly flavored.  I don't know if I can continue to indulge in this perfection the size of half a standard Rubix cube for $22.  Siu mai and har gow was delicious, but not that far ahead or different from many other restaurants. (~$7-8 per basket).  The piece of a single order of peking duck and bun felt like a rip off since it wasn't outstanding. \n\nService is pretty good but almost not enough for a \"$$$\" rating level.

I LOVE that you can do that here since most dim sum restaurants do not take reservations at all. :) I've been here for many weddings and the food was good, too.\n\nPROS:\n-Delicious, tasty, and good quality dim sum\n-Clean\n-Great location. You can walk off your dim sum to the Ferry Building to get dessert. \n-You can easily make reservations online!! Love that.\n-The dim sum carts come around fast so you get quick service.\n-Hostesses are friendly and nice.\n-Someone comes around to ask if you would like to also order take-out, which I did. \n-Delicious custard buns!\n\nCONS:\n-LONG WAIT if you don't make reservations. \n-Parking can be a challenge, but what do you expect in San Francisco? I always luck out & find street parking.\n-It is pricey dim sum BUT, you get what you pay for. Worth it here.", "author": "Jennifer J."}

Hard to enjoy the meal and conversation with all the interruptions. Maybe a red/green disk like at Brazilian BBQ's would help. I will say though that his was by far the very best Dim Sum ever. Each item had it's own distinctive flavor and textures. So many other Dim Sum houses are muddled and just reputations on the same theme. These folks are masters at flavor profiles and extracting as much as possible in each bite.", "author": "Kevin M."}

However all other things such as service, and price is all three stars and below are the reasons why. \n\nWe were sat at a corner table where a lot of carts didn't come to for nearly 15mins. We just sat there waiting for  someone to pass us by. We finally told our waitress who sent one cart our way. It was also little hard to get someone to get our waters refilled. In general it is a little hard to get the workers attention. We wanted more lotus leaf but after notifying our waitress and still no lotus leaf after 10-15mins we asked for the bill.  I guess if you have two hours to leisurely dine in, this won't be a problem. \n\nAs for the price, this is not your typical Chinese cheap dimsum place. There were two of us and the total was $70. This place is pricier than Din Tai Fung so be careful how many plates you order off the cart. You can lose track and it is a little hard to keep track since you choose from a cart that doesn't have a price tag on them. \n\nIf expensive price tag and time is not a issue for you, this might be a five star restaurant for you.

I wondered why we didn't get anything to drink so I asked for tea. We begin to order. My BF asks \"is there any lobster claws\" and the girl said \"sorry can you speak English, I don't know Chinese.\" I'm not sure what made her hear Chinese because he isn't even Chinese nor does he look like he is. Anyways, she proceeded to dump different things onto our table such as the shrimp dumpling and other things. I tell her \"no no, we don't want those, my BF is allergic to shrimp.\" Is this how you sell the dim sum on your cart, by dumping it onto our table without us saying we want it? I thought it was extremely rude.\n\nAnother lady passes by and we order Shanghai dumplings, shrimp/ cream cheese wonton, and two other dishes. Wonton was mediocre but the Shanghai dumplings were good. The two other stuff never came after a long period of time so we just decided to get the check and eat somewhere else.\n\nThe tea was $2 per person and validation was $4.

Be prepared for the less popular carts to visit often due to the lower take-up rate. Decent: xiao long bao, har-gow, siu mai, pork spare-ribs, lotus leaf rice, rice noodle rolls with shrimp (although it is $9.45). Do note that porridge is only served on weekends. \n\nTea ($2 per person) is served in a huge glass pot. I find that I often have to ask for hot water refills in other restaurants but the one huge pot here will suffice for 2 people for one long meal. \n\nThere is validated parking for 3 hours on weekends so be sure to take up that offer instead of parking on the street (not easy making the rounds to find street parking anyway due to the heavy traffic).

I think the prices are at least 2x more than what you'd pay elsewhere, but when you go to Yank Sing, in part you're going for the experience too. \n\nI have no complaints about the food quality nor quantity and all prices are disclaimed, disclosed on the menus, so nothing should catch a customer by surprise at all. \n\nDim Sum will cost about $20 per person for light eating and maybe upwards towards $40 (or more) per person if you are liberal with how you order and gorge yourself a bit more with less restraint, so in all reality, not that much more than going to a Mexican Tapas or Japanese Sushi place on a per plate cost basis. \n\nI'd recommend Yank Sing as an elegant and nice place to have a meal. \n\nParking is $4 for the Validation that gives 2 hours, otherwise I think it's $6 per 30 mins, so if you park, don't forget to get validated (and validated does not mean FREE, and they'll charge you there at Yank Sing for the validation, then you turn your ticket in at the garage for no additional fees and get to go on your way.

Even though I am a huge fan, I remain completely clueless when it comes to ordering, but the dim sum process is set up to keep me clueless.  For instance, Yank Sing sat us promptly.  A waiter came by quickly and briefly and equipped us with tea and waters.  Then, he was gone.  I think he brought the bill, but I am not really sure it was the same guy. \n\nThe ordering process involves a bunch of wait staff hauling around carts and just asking if you want some of what they are pushing.  This is pretty typical of dim sum.  I continue to order whatever looks good and whenever I hear the word pork.  Sure enough, it resulted in a successful lunch for me and Shari V.  We enjoyed the dumplings, pot stickers, fried shrimp and steamed pork buns.  The disconnect is between what is on my table and what is on the menu.  I'm not sure what's what.  Who cares frankly.  It's tastes awesome.\n\nThe process is pretty fast, but can be a little frustrating.  Occasionally, I would see a waiter with something I wanted, but this waiter would be halfway across the restaurant.  Because I have no idea of what I'm looking at and the language barrier between myself and the staff, I didn't have a good way of procuring this delicacy.  In the end, my patience prevailed and by just waiting 5 minutes, that very same dish would appear before me.  Then, I'd order it greedily and wolf it down.

Nothing over the top, just enough of a crap experience that I won't be going to Yank Sing again. It was my grandmother's 86th birthday lunch (just her, my mom and I), and when you don't have a good time at a celebration it always stings a little more. We sat in the courtyard because she loves the fountain out there. \n\n2 main issues - \n1) absurdly long delays and sub-par variety on the food, at one point we'd had about 7-8 dishes and were winding down, but wanted a few more, and there was a THIRTY MINUTE wait until more carts finally came around, which is absolutely absurd for dim sum. When a cart finally came, the family across from us pointed at us and said \"I think they're hungry too\" because they'd seen us longingly looking around the whole time (as they did the same). Additionally, when I went inside to look for the bathroom I saw about twice as much variety and HOT, FRESH dishes, which we simply did not see in the 1.5 hrs we were there. Why not send some carts straight from the kitchen to the courtyard?!\n\n2)**They overcharged us by about 25%.** When we got the check they saw us looking at it quizzically and asked if there was anything wrong we said it just seemed there were too many expensive items on it (we'd glanced at the prices on the menu throughout the meal), they claimed we'd ordered two soup dumplings (which were $14), we explained we hadn't we'd ordered 2 shrimp dumplings (which were $6.5). They adjusted the bill for that mistake, but at that point I was curious, b/c something was clearly awry, so I wrote down everything we'd ordered and the price, and the subtotal came to $97, our first check the subtotal was $120, and the 2nd it was $114, so in either scenario we were pretty significantly overcharged. i didn't argue the price at this point, because I didn't want to waylay my grandmother any longer (she'd been ready to go since half way through the cart drought), and bring down the mood further, and still tipped 15% (below what I'd tip for good service of course, but I'm not going to be an ass about it).

When I say \"Chinese\" I mean \"dishes,\" otherwise I specify noodles or dim sum, etc. so we were a little confused when we got here and saw no menu for dishes.\nWe sat down all the same because it had been a long time since we had eaten dim sum. The wait staff were fairly kind and the jasmine tea was actually quite good, but the food doesn't live up to the price tag, especially after eating a far more filling dishes meal for less than half the price with substantially more food just a few miles away later that day! \nThe soup dumplings were probably the best item, but they were also the most expensive of what we ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-02", "description": "Service: 4 stars\nFood: 3 stars\nValue for the money: 1 star\n\nAs usual, this place was packed and there was a long wait.  Fortunately, we had reservations and didn't have to wait that long (about 15 minutes).\n\nIn a nut shell, their dim sum is good.  They have a much smaller selection than other large dim sum houses such as Koi Palace in Daly City and Saigon in Sunnyvale.  We thought their chicken feet was extra good (slightly spicy) and they excelled at any noodle.  For example, their shrimp noodle (Ha Cheng) had a very thin noodle, large shrimp and sweet sauce.  The shrimp dumpling (Ha Gow) was firmly wrapped and the wrap was thick enough to not fall apart like a lot of places but thin enough such that it didn't taste doughy.  What we did notice though is that the filling for the Ha Gow our Sui Mai wasn't that flavorful.  So some of their dishes are a bit above other dim sum houses and many others are on par or slightly below.\n\nTheir service is good.  They are very busy so don't expect much attention but when you do get their attention, the servers are courteous and will get you what you want without displaying the attitude that other Chinese places give.\n\nThe prices are outrageous though.  $6.80 for 4 Sui Mai.  Most of their dishes average $6.80.  We didn't order tons of food and our check came out to be $116 for two people (with nothing left over).  Parking is expensive if you go on the week day.  They give you a discount on the rate but we still ended up paying $16 for 3 hours (after their discount).  Apparently the parking (with validation) is free on the weekend but good luck with the crowds.\n\nI don't see myself coming back anytime soon.  For that amount of money, I rather go to Saigon in Sunnyvale which averages $50 for the same dishes we got and tastes just as good but without the great service.  If service is important to you then Yank Sing shouldn't disappoint.  If you haven't tried Koi Palace, I think the service is comparable with free parking and much better variety of dim sum.  If service is not that important, go to Saigon in Sunnyvale or try some other places in the city.", "author": "Lily L."}

On top of that, there were so many dim sum items that were not available because they were not cooked yet - like their chicken feet. And by the time we were done eating, it still was not cooked. \n\nThey have a restroom located on the lower level, with only one stall, and it's difficult to get into if there is a long line of women waiting for the restroom. The men's restroom is passed the women's, so the women would have to wait their turn in the staircase (I understand it's in SF, but it's just a little inconvenient) They do have an elevator to accommodate those who are unable to make it down the steps, but it just makes it a little difficult if you're stuck in that situation. \n\nIt gets pretty noisy in there, which must mean the food's good!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "2.5 STARS\n\nSome things are left better unsaid. \n\nOne of those things are telling people that I like the dim sum at Yank Sing. Like r-e-a-l-l-y like (I can just imagine some of my friends shaking their head at me). It's the only place I will go to for dim sum; well, actually it's the only place I can go to now because of my msg allergies/sensitivities. \n\nYank Sing uses quality ingredients, the dim sum is well-constructed, and they do not add that msg crap(*). They also take reservations and they have free validated parking! NO where in SF offers this. No where.\n\nBUT...\n\nYou will pay the price. Dim sum for two? $100-$120. Yup, the same amount that would feed a family of 10-12 at other dim sum restaurants. They even have the balls to charge $4 pp for tea. Ridiculous right?\n\nThis is why I keep my fondness of Yank Sing on the DL. No doubt I would get a tongue lashing from my parents followed by a lashing from the feather duster. Then again, I think bringing them to Yank Sing for kicks would be fun. My mom would probably try to roll the dim sum cart home thinking the bill was inclusive of it. Oh yes, SHE would!\n\nBefore coming to Yank Sing, DO make reservations on opentable.com as it's always packed. I like sitting in their courtyard because it's not as cramped as their inside dining area. (*)Even though Yank Sing doesn't add msg to their food, they do have some dishes prepared with pre-bought sauces (e.g. oyster sauce, hoison sauce, etc) that contain msg. So if you have msg allergies/sensitivities like I do, ask your waiter which dishes contain these sauces.\n\nThe menu is a bit Americanized but we were still able to get most of our dim sum fix: http://bit.ly/1uJYMXr.\n*XLB: Shanghai Soup Dumplings (6 - $13.60)\n*Fung Zhao: Steamed Chicken Feet ($5.35)\n*Hai Gow: Steamed Shrimp Dumplings ($6.80)\n*Paai Gwaat: Steamed Pork Spareribs ($5.35)\n*Sui Mai: Steamed Pork & Shrimp Dumplings ($6.80)\n*Wu Gok: Fried Taro Dumpling ($5.35)\n*Fried Crab Claws ($13.60)\n*Sesame Balls (2 - $5.65)\n*Baked Custard Tarts (2 - $5.65)\n*Scallop Dumpling (not pictured - $5.65)\n*Phoenix Tail Prawns (not pictured - $12.75)\n\nEverything we ordered for the most part was solid. The dumplings were filled with savory seafood and meat yumminess with good pleating technique. Fried items are crunchy and not greasy (Mr. NSS loves their fried items here). My favorite item is their XLB Shanghai Soup Dumplings. It's like a golden sack bursting with hot soupy goodness. I get wet dreams just thinking about their XLB. Best in the city hands down.\n\nSo why 2.5 STARS?\n\nWell damn, IF I'm going to spend $120 for dim sum for two, the service better match the caliber of the food. Compared to their Stevenson location, the service SUCKS here (I hope management is reading this): \n\n(1) We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservations. After waiting in line, we checked in with the rude hostess (Chinese lady in her early forties with a pony tail). She told us we had to come back in 10 minutes to wait in line and check in again! WTF? We waited 5 minutes and checked in with another hostess with no issues.\n\n(2) We got seated at table with this as our lovely view: http://bit.ly/1pbEHVn. With the $$$$ prices that Yank Sing charges, trash and dirty plates should NOT be plain sight in front of customers.\n\n(3) The sesame balls and custard tarts we received were cold (they are usually served warm). We alerted one of the wait staff who then brought it to another waiter's attention and they started arguing with other staff in Cantonese about who should take their break first. Really unprofessional. \n\n(4) The sesame balls and custard tarts we sent back were re-heated in a toaster oven and sent back to us. If I'm paying 3x the price for this items, I want new ones NOT reheated ones.\n\n(5) The staff in its entirety lack basic customer service skills, professionalism, and attentiveness. I could care less if this happened at S&T, Hong Kong Lounge or Great Eastern but this IS Yank Sing, yo. STEP IT UP!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It's probably not much use to try to describe either the interior nor the approach and ethos of Yank Sing on here, because it has scores of reviews already, legions of opinions. I think what is useful to note is how long Yank Sing has been in business--before dim sum was trendy, not just trendy everywhere but even before it became really trendy in SF--and the depth and scope of their menu. \n\nYou'll find the standard dim sum favorites here: the various dumplings (their Shanghai dumplings aren't to be missed, and most of the seafood ones they do quite well on, too) plus the taro cake, turnip cake, sesame balls, egg custard tarts, and steamed pork buns plus some more esoteric dim sum and seasonal specials. They also have to-go orders which are not ordered per individual dim sum but by set meals (which include certain dim sum). It's a nice touch for those who don't want to dine-in but want the assured quality of Yank Sing. Now, on the issue of quality, overall it's very high but given the sheer volume they do, there can be a lack of attention to detail now and then, but rarely is it ever a real problem.

Do yourself a favor and save space for it, because I was disappointingly stuffed when the duck rolled by me on the cart.\n\nThey use a combination of carts and people carrying food around on trays.

We also tried the stuffed lotus leaf, phoenix shrimp, steamed pork buns, chive dumplings with shrimp, and peppercorn chicken.

This weekend's experience has definitely changed our opinion about this restaurant. I'll cut to the chase - one of the orders of shrimp rice noodle roll had a big dead fly inside the to-go container. It was a repulsive sight - see for yourself in the photo. Our appetite disappeared, as has our interest in dining here. We demanded a credit for the dish, and the initial communication with one of their male staff members (apparent manager) to ensure we receive a credit has been very difficult - he doesn't have the strongest command of the English language. We're still awaiting confirmation from the restaurant that we will be credited for this. At a high level, their prices keep going up and their quality has dropped to an all-time low. We will not be eating here again.", "author": "Cort K."}

The quality of the dimsum is really high quality.  You won't find any fat chunks in your shumai or thick flour on the shrimp dumplings (har gao).  Their Shanghai dumplings are top tier and honestly caught me by surprise!  Keep in mind though that the end cost will be about 25-40% (a party of two will spend about $70 here) more expensive than other popular Dimsum restaurants, such as HongKong Lounge II and parking anywhere in this area will be difficult! \n\nOverall, top tier Dimsum with prices that reflect it!", "author": "Mandy B."}

The only disappointment were the curry crab wontons, which were dry and gritty inside. But one not so good dish out of many delicious ones can be forgiven.\n\nDon't forget to bring your parking garage ticket to have it validated, and don't even try to get in on a a Sunday morning without a reservation. Even with one, we waited for half an hour to be seated. Walk-ins were told it would be a 1.5-2 hour wait, and judging by the crowd I'd say that's a conservative estimate.\n\nWe came here for the first time right before Christmas, and I think it's going to be a new holiday tradition for us.", "author": "Brenda A."}

Having already eaten at other places for dim sum, this one was the most disappointing.

Part of the fun of Dim Sum is watching a cart full of delicious food roll-up your way and then pointing and ordering in excitement.  \n\nThe must-order here, which the other reviews will confirm, are the Phoenix Shanghai Dumblings. Ohemgeee, these were incredibly delicious - super soft on the outside and when you bit into one, out pours the most flavorful and savory broth you will have ever tasted.  I would cross the entire Great Wall to eat these, they're that good.   The other dishes I tried, Peking duck, and the bao were also incredibly delicious and flavorful - I didn't want to stop eating.   \n\nI've read some reviews that said this joint is a bit pricey, and, perhaps, it's a bit more expensive than most lunch/dinner spots that aren't super fancy.

Mind blowing.\n-Spinach mushroom dumplings which look like green tortellini are wonderful.\n-The plain old shrimp dumplings were the best we've ever had, with no corn starch binder flavor and a clearly homemade dumpling skin,\n-Barbecue pork bun were the best we've ever had.\n-The glass teapots were beautiful and elegant to look at.\n\nWe pigged out. We ate $60 worth of dim sum for lunch and honestly could have come back to eat here at least twice during our trip if we'd had time. We will be back for sure next time we're in San Fran.", "author": "Sue S."}

Everybody from the receptionist to the wait staff to the cart ladies are courteous and attentive.  The cart ladies all have radios and they can order items from the kitchen for you if they run out.  The lady just sold out of turnip cake when we wanted to order, she radioed the kitchen and it was brought to our table in a minute.\n\nThe table setting is nice, with chili sauce and hot mustard in serving containers.  Both the chili sauce and mustard are of very good quality.  The teapot is  contemporary in design and has a filter for the tea leaves so they don't get to your tea.\n\nThe food is very good.  The har gaw and siu mai are superb and so is almost everything else.  When we ordered the sticky rice, the lady cut it open for us and it came with a serving spoon (see picture).  The only disappointment was the pork spareribs.  It was really only ok, and the quality of the meat is not good.\n\nThis is a perfect place for a business lunch, especially if your company is paying for it.  For us it was a very enjoyable dim sum experience, but I probably won't pay an arm and a leg for it again.", "author": "Rob L."}

It was a 10-course meal, plus dessert and beverages.  Oh, I can't forget the open bar if one wanted some other kind of libations besides champagne, chardonnay and/or pinot noir.\n\nThe ambiance and our waiter/server, Ray, are the main reason Yank Sing earns a five star.  He was approachable, friendly, and very accommodating...totally cool.  Our table was short a snow crab claw (my brother sitting to the left of me did not get one).  Ray came to the rescue and served him one.  Because most of the courses were seafood, my husband asked for white wine and Ray again came to the rescue.\n\nThe wedding banquet menu started and ended with the following:\n\nFive Happiness Cold Platter, featuring five spiced smoked beef shank, jellyfish salad, char siu and smoked duck...4 stars.\n\nSnow Crab Claw stuffed with seafood mousse...5 stars.\n\nSea Scallops with Macadamia Nuts sauteed with XO sauce and toasted...delicious but a tad too many macadamia nuts...3.5 stars.\n\nWinter Melon Soup with crab meat, dried scallops and seafood...tasty and had a hint of MSG...4.5 stars.\n\nPeking Duck served with fluffy mandarin buns and hoisin sauce...4 stars.\n\nCrispy Spring Chicken served with shrimp flavored chips...chicken was moist and flavorable, but shrimp flavored chips were between semi-chewy to semi-crispy...3.5 stars.\n\nImperial Lobster sauteed with ginger scallion wine sauce...5 stars.\n\nVelvet Filet Mignon Tenders sauteed with sugar snap peas in XO sauce...4 stars.\n\nHoney-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with red pepper garnish...the piece de resistance...5 stars.\n\nFook Kien Fried Rice - a chicken shiitake rice casserole with shrimp and sea scallops garnished with chinese broccoli...4 stars.\n\nDessert:  Chilled mango pudding...4 stars; wedding cake - beautifully decorated, but was dense and dry (chocolate cake is not a fav of mine)...a disappointing 3 stars.\n\nBeverages:  2002 Dom Perignon, 2011 Rombauer Chardonnay and 2009 Foley's Two Sisters Pinot Noir...5 stars.\n\nOpen bar:  The bartenders were nice, but my drink which was a Shirley Temple was flat...no carbonation in that 7-Up and it didn't have that lemon/lime tang.  A taste of my husband's margarita was weak...don't know what brand of tequila was used...2.5 stars on both drinks.\n\nEven though with the minor disappointments of wedding cake and drinks from the open bar, my overall rating stands at a 5 star with other activities going on...photo ops and dancing to the music...\"hey, get up and get down, get up off of yo seat; get up and get down, get up and move yo feet\"...something like that.", "author": "Carol C."}

Seriously the service is Ridic! Sometimes orders came in four and in like holy guacamole that's a lot. They understood and said how many do you want. I said two, so they split the plate and stamped a lower price. The best dish were the egg tarts! Comes in four but they let us have two.

The xiao long bao (Shanghai soup dumplings) are as good as they get: perfect thickness of the skin, plenty of tasty soup inside with a wonderfully delicious and tender meat filling. I've yet to break a single XLB (knock on wood) which is a testament to how well they are made! All the regular dim sum items are also very good (e.g., har gao, shrimp noodles, egg tarts, sesame balls, etc), and the seafood is always fresh. The only dish that needed improvement was the chicken feet. The sauce was a bit bland. Other than that, I have no complaints. And the service is very good - Americanized service, not your standard authentic Chinese service. ;-)\n\nMake reservations using Open Table or you will be stuck waiting for lunch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-09", "description": "Almost all the travel guides I read tell you to go to Yank Sing for dim sum.  So like lamb to slaughter, I followed suit and ended up in a restaurant though fine and well decorated, had kill your budget prices. It's located in the Rincon Center in the Financial District.   Be wary of restaurants that don't serve dim sum for breakfast and start serving at 11:00.  They figure it will be more gentle to bear when you see the bill and you rationalize that you are paying for brunch or lunch because who would want to pay so much for breakfast!   The cost for two people without tip was already a staggering $70.  They also did not have a menu on the table with prices nor did waiters bring any to the table.  I completely forgot to look for a menu seeing that I'm just some eating dim sum.  Wrong move!  Always look for a menu, especially in fancy establishments.\n\nI have had far more beautiful dim sum in Hong Kong and China and it was definitely affordable.  Some places serve whole shrimp neatly tucked in the shrimp dumpling (har gow) which was not the case at Yank Sing.  Yes, the dim sums are refined but it will cost you.  They only carried 5 teas and it came in the see through glass pot and the leaves, held in the center.  Unfortunately, I had chrysanthemum tea that didn't do well in this fancy pot.  It takes a while to steep this tea, and most of the time it tasted like water with just a hint of chrysanthemum.  Forget the fancy pot; give me a regular tea pot, and some flavor steeped tea.\n\nStaffs push around dim sum carts and all are proficient in English and most seem to prefer to speak English to all customers.  A stellar dim sum was the deep fried tofu mixture with seaweed wrapped around it.  It tastes best when hot, and the jello in the orange slices, clever, eye-catching and beautiful to look at.   The shrimp dumpling had overly sticky skin and stuck to my chopsticks, tearing it away from the filling.  The steamed rice roll was okay, but most of the dim sum had a sweetness to it which sometimes is bad when you want savory tasting seasoning only.  I had one piece of scallion pancake leftover and they packed it in a deluxe take over box that was hexagon in shape.  Give me a regular disposable container and slash some dim sum prices.\n\nThis is a onetime experience for me only and I would never do it again.  I have to remove one star for overly high prices and not giving us a menu to see how the dim sums are tabulated.", "author": "Lin Y."}

My gripe truly is on the prices. When you order some duck, and they serve it by the slice ($6.50/slice) you automatically fall out of your chair and want to give it back.  Who even does that?

My date and I were seated at one of those hard-to-reach tables today, but the waitstaff often came to check on us to make sure that we got everything we wanted, which we thought was a nice touch. That being said, the waiter responsible for tea/plates was often pretty curt (but what do I expect?).\n\nOn food: \n- Honey glazed sea bass ($20): This was definitely a melt-in-your-mouth kind of dish. I loved everything from the nice combination of buttery flavor of the fish and the sweet soy sauce to the garnishes that complemented the sweet sauce with a kick (scallions). The only problem may be the price tag.\n\n- Turnip cakes: Nicely done, with crispy outside (with pancetta-like pork pieces, too)! I would love it if other places all could do it exactly this way. \n\n- Spring rolls: These are okay but not great. The inside could have more texture, but the seasoning is nice and the wrapper is nicely fried.  \n\n- Charsiubao: I thought I liked it more than the Koi Palace's! The inside is well, a little overseasoned but I liked the inside-to-bun ratio. The bun is also quite buttery so the dish has almost a decadent feel to it. \n\n- Shumai: This was a great rendition of the classic dim sum dish with high-quality ingredients.  \n\nThe food is really great here if you are willing to spend $$$ on it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-01", "description": "Yank Sing is a fine dining Chinese restaurant that serves dim sum, which an assortment of steamed dumplings and side dishes. It's very well-known and has recognition from the James Beard Foundation: http://www.yanksing.com/about-us/reviews/james_beard_09.html\n\nAt first glance to people who are unfamiliar with dim sum, it may seem strange as a breakfast/brunch option. Don't worry, you'll crave it for breakfast soon enough. It's the perfect meal to bring families and friends together. It's shared family-style so it's no wonder large families gather for dim sum every Sunday! The dim sum at Yank Sing can be a bit pricey, but I'd pay for the quality and freshness that they put out. They also have a superb wait staff as compared to other more homey dim sum restaurants. I have nothing against the classic, small, hole-in-the-walls, but I don't mind the extra customer service and food quality that Yank Sing offers.\n\nYank Sing has two locations and during my short trip to SF, I went to both...\n\nThe two locations are: the Spear St. location and the Stevenson St.. The Spear St. location is within a business building food court and it's very nice. The Stevenson location is smaller and not as popular so you may not see as long of a line, but there will still be a wait. Food is consistent between the two.\n\nSo were there any notable dishes? Absolutely. The Soup dumplings. I first discovered these Chinese delights in NYC's Joe Shanghai restaurant. It's well-known for their soup dumplings and I can still taste my first bite. Unfortunately, New Orleans has no such thing, but I've discovered them in major cities like Houston and more recently in San Francisco. Yank Sing has one of the best soup dumplings I have ever had. The dumpling casing is so delicate and very similar to a won-ton. It holds the perfect temperature of soup and dumpling within. Once it's in your mouth, it just melts...Be sure to add the ginger and red vinegar. It balances the flavors so well. It can be an acquired taste so start with just a touch!\n\nOverall, excellent food and service.\n\nYes, the dim sum prices are pretty steep, but it's worth a try! Honestly, I would just go to Yank Sing for a few orders of Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) and some tea. That would be the perfect meal right about now...", "author": "Leslie L."}

Plus, they charged for tea (!) which is pretty ridiculous at a Dim Sum restaurant.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I had a pretty good feast, but ended up spending $80 before tip, which is an unheard of amount of money to pay for Dim Sum in New York. Here's what we got, and in the order we got them:\n- Steamed BBQ Pork Rice Roll\n- Baked BBQ Pork Buns\n- Steamed Chicken Dumplings\n- Peking Duck\n- Sesame Balls\n- Pan Fried Pork Dumplings\n- Sweet Chicken in Foil\n- Pistachio Ice Cream Pie\n- Pan Friend Chicken Buns\n- Shanghai Soup Dumplings\n\nOK, I'll admit it's pretty touristy that we got the Peking Duck and the Pistachio Ice Cream Pie, but they were both still pretty good. And those two probably went a long way in jacking up the price of the meal. Looking back at that list, I guess that is quite a bit of food...but it still feels a little expensive. It's a good thing I'm allergic to shrimp, since that severely limits the dishes you can order at Dim Sum, otherwise I probably would've dropped $150 and gotten a nice stomach ache.\n\nBeing half Chinese and not knowing how to speak any Chinese, it was a nice welcome change from the good places in New York where the waiters and staff don't speak a lick of English, so I was able to get a straight answer when asking questions about what we were ordering. Service here was super polite compared to most Chinese restaurants I have been to, which also made for a very pleasant experience.", "author": "Mike C."}

Having received such consistently high praise over the years, I wanted to give them another shot as it had been over a decade since I last ate here as a child with the family.\n\nClearly, there was a reason for the long hiatus because every single dish was mediocre at best.  The theme across the board seemed to be the use of unusually lean meats for the style of cuisine as everything from the siu mai to the seen jook geun was dry.  Of all the items, the xiao long bao turned out to be the best of the lot.  My issue lies in the abysmal quality-to-price ratio.  The bill worked out to be ~$90 for me and my parents and we didn't order a particular large amount of food either.  Be aware too that single orders of certain dishes come smaller than most Chinese restos, eg. 2 spring rolls per order versus 3 at most places, so ask if you're ever unsure.\n\nAdmittedly, the venue is on the more upscale side for dim sum and the servers can actually speak decent English.  That being said, I just can't fathom how the place can charge such egregiously high prices for run-of-the-mill fare.  It's not even worth one try as there's nothing truly different or particularly well done here.", "author": "Eric F."}

Their dim sum is definitely of quality but like all the other reviews have mentioned - the cost does not justify what you're getting. Nowhere will you find a plate of four egg tarts for $12  or a single dumpling split in half for $6. If you plan on coming, I would advise that you not come on an empty stomach but rather for a late afternoon snack (they're open until 4pm on the weekends).  The restaurant itself is nice and clean but the service is on par with any other Asian restaurant which was surprising.  I also found it unsettling how it seemed like every server's mission was to get as many plates of dim sum on your table as possible.\n\nThis place will surely impress people who have never had dim sum before but most definitely not your grandma who has had many years of dim sum in her lifetime.", "author": "Michele L."}

While some of the dishes were good, the other dishes were served luke warm to cold to us (especially the shrimp dishes that were priced at an unjustifiable $10+ per plate).  I don't care how well your service is.  At your prices, you should NOT be serving fried dishes cold, even if it's AFTER the lunch rush.  In addition, if you're going to be charging over $10 for those small dishes, then I better get giant tiger prawns!\n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings were fine, but not sensational to, again, justified the price.  I rather have them made to order instead of having sat on a dim sum cart for several minutes (the cooler they become, the less the chance they will burst with broth at the first bite into them).  \n\nComing from Los Angeles, and from the heart of the San Gabriel Valley where there are chock full of dim sum palaces galore, I was not impressed.  The Siu Mai looked woefully thin and undercooked.  Most of the other dishes did not \"wow\" me at all, and at their prices, I have to be \"wow\".  If it weren't for the fact that we were limited in time (having to head to Oakland Airport to catch our flight in the afternoon), I would have insisted that we make the trek over to Koi Palace in Daly City for better dim sum at a much cheaper price.  Obviously, the selection there would have been much much better.\n\nAt Yank Sing's prices, they should change their approach and sell dim sum to order.

I loved the idea of just ordering until you are satisfied. It makes the experience so much easier. And being a real lover of Chinese food, it was unbelievable. A must have for any resident or tourist in the area.", "author": "Elliot F."}

My parents and I were in the city for other business and finished at around 11:15am, so we decided to come here for their lunch. \n\nThe food is DEFINITELY really good. My family has always been rather picky about the quality and texture of buns, noodles, and skins of dumplings (my parents tell me it's in our blood), and we loved ALL of the steamed goods they had to offer us. We got the steamed pork bun, shanghai dumplings, mango pudding, and other things whose names I'm still unsure of after a lifetime of eating them. Everything we got was delicious, though.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this delicious dim sum definitely comes with a hefty price tag. However, the service is exceptional for a Chinese restaurant. The waiters are all connected through an earpiece and microphone so asking one waiter for something is like asking all waiters for something and you get it quickly. In addition, their varied clientele means that all the waiters are pretty fluent in both English and Chinese, which makes it helpful for an American Born Chinese like me where I speak lots of Chenglish.\n\nHelpful tip to people who DON'T live in the city: they have a parking garage (look for Rincon garage), and Yank Sing will VALIDATE the $30 parking fee.

When we checked in, were told we would have the next table.\n\nOver an hour later, one of our group had to insist on a table strongly as we watched tables of eight getting seated repeatedly for the last hour, as we had a four year old that was getting cranky (as well as some of the adults in our group).  The hostess was not happy at all.  But, we finally got seated in the center of the food court at a table set for eight.  My very strong recommendation is keep your reservation for 8 even if you have someone not able to join you.  For them to make the adjustment down to 7 is not something they know how to do, at least at the RINCON Center location.\n\nMaybe had to do with the Chinese New Year celebrations, but they did not explain anything so it was a bit uncalled for.\n\nFinally sitting down, the food was very good, but pretty Americanized.  We love dim sum and have had fabulous experiences through San Francisco and Los Angeles.  The food was good but we never saw the majority of the carts in the center food court area of this location. \n\nThis restaurant was picked because of friends who loved the Financial District location.

Here the shrimp or pork had bigger pieces of meat versus the ground up mystery meat you're use too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-24", "description": "Having not been to Yank Sing in over ten years, I was eager to return to try their dim sum.  In recent years, they've received a lot of notable press, especially regarding their \"xiao long bao\" or soup dumplings that Patricia Unterman raved about.\n\nTheir Rincon Center location (off Spear Street) is definitely their flagship and very popular with tourists.  The glass open-aired building with the indoor waterfall is impressive and Yank Sing is the epicenter of activity here.\n\nWe put down our name and only had to wait for about 15 minutes.  With plentiful tables both in the atrium and inside the main restaurant, the turnover appears quick.\n\nMultiple food carts soon passed by and I was thrilled when the first food cart was their famed soup dumplings.  Truth be told, they are well aware of the positive press as that cart would pass by our table at least five more times throughout our meal.  Our dim sum: \n\nHar Gow \nChives dumpling \nDumpling #3 (tasted similar to first 2)\nFried taro \nDeep Fried Crab Claw \nFried shrimp \nBacon wrapped shrimp with green onion  \nXiao long bao\nPeking Duck\n\nOverall, we found the items at Yank Sing to be solid, with an occasional one that was excellent.  The xiao long bao, in particular,  deserves the rave reviews.  It was close to perfect and the thin skin is extremely hard to find in the Bay Area.  As well, it had a soup quantity that puts most dumpling places to shame.  \n\nThe crab claw was excellent as well.  Lots of fresh crab meat and a nice crispy fried exterior.  \n\nOther than those two items, I thought everything was similar to what I'd find at other recommended dim sum places: Cityview (SF), Koi Palace (Daly City), Hong Kong Saigon (Sunnyvale), ABC Seafood (Foster City) or Joy Luck (Cupertino).\n\nThe real shocker of the meal came when I decided to ask how much an order of Peking Duck would cost.  The server comes to your table and asks how many slices you would like.  Little did I know, each SLICE of peking duck costs $5.40.  Are you kidding me????  How much is the entire duck?????  $100!?!  \n\nOnce I realized how pricey this item was, I perused the menu for other prices of dim sum items: \n\nA slice of honey glazed seabass (dim sum portion) -  $18!  Are you serious!?!?  How much does the entire fish cost?  $300?!?!?  \n\nThe famed xiao long bao -  ~$12 for 6 dumplings!  For reference, the more famous Din Tai Fung averages $7-9/order and they sell a truffle xiao long bao (available only overseas) that costs about $14/order.  Yank Sing may be among the better xiao long bao I've had in the Bay Area, but the price premium definitely changes my rating.  \n\nThe final sticker shock, of course, came with the total bill.  For 3 people, our bill was easily north of $100.  For lunch and simple dim sum.  We didn't have lobster.  We didn't have abalone or high end seafood.  Heck, the xiao long bao isn't even the crab meat versions many restaurants have.  With so many other options in SF and beyond, I can't justify those prices for dim sum. \n\nThe service for such a pricey establishment isn't particularly stellar either.  We had to flag down waiters to remove our empty plates and bamboo steamers and after we asked for the bill and gave our credit card, the whole transaction seemed like it took 15+ minutes, even though the lunch crowds had clearly died down with the late hour.  \n\nTake home message: Yank Sing is pretty good, but those prices are ludicrous.  Call it the tourist tax; foreigner fee; hype pricing; marketing premium.....just please don't call it a fair value.  I enjoyed my meal here, but at those prices, there are too many options and too many cuisines to choose from.\n\nYank Sing accepts credit cards, including American Express.", "author": "Randy F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-04", "description": "Food:\nNo complaints here. As expected of an authentic dim sum restaurant, the food was prepared very well across the board. My favorites were their home-made Shanghai dumplings and the cheong fun (rice noodles, shrimp, and soy sauce). For dessert, the sesame balls and mango pudding rounded out my meal perfectly.\n\nService:\nAgain, relatively good. Since we came in on the 4th of July, there was certainly a large population of customers in the restaurant; however, the food was still promptly served to each table, and it doesn't take long to try all the dishes that you want. One of the most impressive points of notice was how coordinated the servers were. When one member of my party ordered something that the cart was out of, the server immediately phoned a different cart and smoothly presented the missing dish. Although most of the servers don't speak fluent English, they genuinely try to be attentive and helpful in any way they can.\n\nPricing:\nAs you would expect in San Francisco, the food is extremely expensive. Dishes run between an understandable $5 and a ludicrous $21 (for the sea bass). Most of the dishes are also relatively small, further compounding the costliness of the restaurant. We spent $30+ for 5 thin pieces of Peking duck, whereas a whole duck would be cheaper at other places. As good as the food is, I am still unsure as to whether or not it warrants the price. This is by far the main flaw of the restaurant and keeps it from attaining higher marks.\n\nOverall Experience:\nAll in all, Yank Sing is truly a great dim sum restaurant for the Bay Area that offers an authentic taste of Asian appetizer style dishes. While the verdict is out on the high prices, if you are expecting and willing to spend big, I doubt you will be disappointed.", "author": "Connor V."}

When my cousin and I arrived 10 minutes before they opened, a long line had already formed.  Fortunately my sister came even earlier, so she was third in line.  Our group also had a reservation.  Score!\n\nOnce we were seated, our server asked us what kind of tea we wanted.  What?  You just don't serve everybody oolong?  I love a place that serves more than one kind of tea!\n \nWhen I go to a dim sum house, there are two dishes I use to rate the kitchen:\n\n1.  Har Gau (shrimp dumplings)\n2.  Siu Mai (pork dumplings)\n\nI have been eating these two dishes since I was kid, so I am definitely qualified to judge their quality.\n\nThe menu at Yank Sing is comparable to most other dim sum restaurants, as far as the number of items offered goes.  What sets them apart is their ingredients.  Yank Sing uses higher quality meats, and you can taste the difference.  I certainly did in the two items above.\n\nOne of my other favorites is the deep fried taro root.  I like it served with the insides molten hot, fresh out of the kitchen.  It was served hot, but really hot.  It still tasted wonderful and also just a little better than at other dim sum restaurants.\n\nYank Sing also offers daily specials, but we didn't try any of them after looking at the prices.  This is not a cheap place to eat, but it is definitely worth it on special occasions.\n\nMy advice to future weekend diners: get a reservation, and come early.  This place is popular and fills very quickly.  If you are still in line once the initial wave of diners has been seated, you must wait for the entire restaurant to finish eating before a table opens up.

It was good dim sum, stellar service, and a hefty price tag.\n\nThe menu showcases the same dim sum that you would expect. The steamed char siu bau was good with a very well-steamed, but not gummy bun with seasoned char siu pork that was well done. The fried wontons were still warm, but not excessively hot and had that crisp exterior that one desires. The taro dumplings were quite good, but could have used just another hit of salt, while the shrimp dumpling might have had just a tad too much.\n\nWho doesn't like Peking duck? Well, Yank Sing didn't disappoint with a very well executed duck set between the steamed bun and green onions and sauce. Their Shanghai dumpling were fantastic, however be careful with the hot soup! The balance of flavors with the broth and bits of meat were fantastic. Definitely a must-have when you go.\n\nService is stellar and the wait for items were never long. It was quite a different experience form the neighborhood spots where yelling becomes more common then service with a smile. It was quite refreshing to not have the teapot or water glasses go empty and have food arrive in a nice orchestration to fill our stomachs.\n\nPrice is on the tad higher side, however isn't insanely pricey. That being said, it definitely is a little more than what you would expect.

We would meet up here on a Sunday afternoon about 2pm, after seeing each other the Saturday night before about 2am closing down the clubs, if not 3:30am after a late night bowl of noodles.  \n\nThat was before Yank Sing and Yank Sing2 (the take-out little sister, not to be confused with Swing Out Sister, the British singing group of about the same time) moved to Rincon Annex, which used to be the old Bulk Mail processing center for San Francisco. Now it is a boutique food court with a 3 story dripping fountain in the middle surrounded by a marbled wall atrium. \n\nYank Sing was always known by the hardcore Chinese Dim Summers (not to be confused with the hard core Wannabe Donna Summers, R.I.P.) as over-priced and not that great, while the Business and Caucasian crowd thought it was the best Yum Cha experience this side of Hong Kong, where most had never been, or if they had, went to similar over-priced places. Maybe that is why it is called Yank Sing, because it makes Caucasians howl with delight?\n\nYank Sing has white table clothed tables with white butcher paper covering them, so they can quickly clean up all the spilled grease for the next party of 4. The space is elegantly appointed in a simple but quality wood and mirror decorated motif, that says you are not at a traditional Chinatown Tea House with the FOBs from Kowloon where you can't hear yourself talk, because everyone else seems like they are shouting at once in Cantonese.  \n\nOur party of four waited 30 - 40 minutes for our table, at Noon the day after Christmas, known as Boxing Day in the British Commonwealth, which Hong Kong used to be a part of until 1997.  We got an LED/Buzzer to hold in wait, like at Elephant Bar or The Yardhouse. \n\nOnce seated, service was very brisk, as dumpling carts descended on us with a battery of Pushers, Pimping Har Gow, Shiu Mai, Fun, Crab Claws, Chicken Feet, XLB, etc. The food was hot and tasty, and in the beginning, the service was great. We got a big clear glass pot of tea pretty quick, too.  \n\nBut later the service waned a bit, sort of like those Hostess bars in Asia, where the prettiest girls sit with you for 30 minutes, then they disappear and are replaced by the motley crew, as the A team sits with the next new customers. \n\nFinishing the dumplings, dung, and bao, we looked for a dessert cart, but it was MIA. So we stopped a waitress and asked for 2 Jin Doi and 1 pudding, and about 20 minutes later, we got 4 Jin Doi but no pudding. Oh well, they were nice and hot, like they should be, and covered in sesames, not just sprinkled. \n\nThis place is expensive! Our bill for 4 was $118 before tip, and we had no alcohol or drinks, besides water and tea. And the parking in the Rincon is very expensive, too, fortunately, Yank Sing validates. \n\nNow that I am a little older, I don't eat 3am noodles followed by 2 pm the next day Dim Sum, like I used to. Sadly, it is more like 12 noon lunch and 6 pm dinner. But it is good to know that Yank Sing is still around as an option.

I've been looking for a good one in SF, and this one is not bad.\n\nHowever, be prepared to pay about three or four times the price for the food! I'm not exaggerating. I came with a friend, and the two of us racked a bill of about $60. We ordered about four items and drank only water. One vegetable side (Chinese Broccoli) went to waste as it was awkwardly and intentionally served cold. It isn't as tasty cold as it is hot. The bitterness of the broccoli overpowers the will to eat it.\n\nAnother note on the cold food, if the restaurant is not crowded, stay away, because the food going around in carts may have been resting for a while. This was the case with two of the dishes we had.\n\nTwo words of advice. Don't come here hungry, or you'll rack up a tab. And don't be intimidated to explore a more authentic restaurant in Chinatown or Clement! I'm really not sure how this place is Michelin recommended.", "author": "Landy E."}

I came here a few months ago with the fiancee and were seated quickly. (OH, AND YAY FOR RESERVATIONS! EVEN FOR 2 PEOPLE!)\n\nThey must use their walkie system to tell the XLB lady when a new table sits down because that is literally the first thing they bring to your table. And they make it well. Although, I've had better at Din Tai Fung and other Kingdom of Dumpling on Taraval. \n\nService is on point here. They actually care; probably because their customer base is not 100% Chinese. There are many tourists and non-Asian folks that eat here, and for good reason. Their food quality and service are some of the best. \n\nAll said and done, it's too expensive for me to come often. That is 1 of the missing components of the meal - a bill that matches the quantity of food we had. Also, maybe it's because of their customer base, I feel the dim sum was not as piping hot as you can get from some other places farther in the residential areas. Something about jumping out of the way of a steaming basket while it's being put on your table and making sure you're not burned by the steam or dripping water makes the experience so much more authentic.", "author": "L M."}

We raced over to the Embarcadero, parked in a nearby lot on Howard, and arrived to check in at exactly 12:38pm.  Instead of getting seated for our reservation, we were told to wait in a HUGE, non-moving line of at least 75-80 people.  Yes, even with so-called \"Opentable reservations\" we still had to wait in line to get seated, as if we didn't have a reservation at all.  What a joke!\n\nThis place and how it handles 'reservations' is a joke, I don't care how good the food is.  The fact that people were still standing in that long line like lemmings when there are so many other good restaurants in SF nearby makes me question their intelligence. It also encourages Yank Sing's disingenuous, dishonest 'reservation' system.\n\nI've already lodged a complaint with Opentable to remove Yank Sing from their reservation system.  It's just a ploy to get people to come and then wait in line with the rest of the schmucks without reservations.  We also saw a lot of people sitting around at tables waiting for food.  Given the reported slow service of this place, we knew we would be there for hours and hours just to get lunch... so we left.  No thanks.", "author": "Dave N."}

Wasn't sure if they were ignoring our table, but this definitely lacked the variety I was hoping for in such a fancy dim sum joint. \n\nWe eventually gave in and decided our options would be to starve or eat shrimp. After a few rounds of shrimp, we finally got our hands on some Shanghai dumplings (good not great), but the lack of variety and the price made this place a total bummer.

I'm posting the review here because Project Wedding does not allow more than 2000 characters.  Hopefully, this will help a lot of Asian brides-to-be.  One review on project wedding really helped me, so I'm passing along updated info.  \n\nOverall: The Rincon Atrium is the best place you can get for an authentic Chinese style banquet that still offers a westernize feel.  Our guests were very impressed, complimented us, & thanked us for inviting them to such a beautiful wedding.  Further, we got rave reviews about the food, decor, event timeline, & how everything was well executed.  \n\nAnother thing to note is we originally planned for our wedding to take place at another Chinese restaurant that also caters.  This plan fell through when our guestlist grew.  Since we could no longer have it at the restaurant, we tried hard to keep them through catering.  We looked at the Bently Reserve, Julia Morgan Ballroom, Decathlon club in Santa Clara, & various hotels that allowed outside caterers.  With that said, I'm so glad the plan fell through b/c we got Yank Sing! It would not have been as magical elsewhere.\n\nAlthough the atrium space is beautiful, a lot of extras were needed to give it that \"wow\" factor.  One thing to remember is, Yank Sing is VERY stringent on negotiations.  \n\nThe Breakdown:\n\nDaisy Hung: She is Yank Sing's event coordinator.  Yes, Yank Sing is so popular that they have their own event coordinator.  She is absolutely great, & we're so happy.  She also speaks english, unlike some other restaurants where they can't communicate with some vendors, Daisy was able to.  She is very responsive, and since she ONLY deals with banquets, she is very knowledgeable.  Her recommendations on the timeline was so appreciated as our original timeline probably wouldn't have worked without her recommendations.  \n\nAtrium Fee: $4,000.  Our friend had it a couple years before us and it was $3,750.  However, in 2012, it's $4,000.  We get the waterfall though. \n\nClean up fee: $500.  No way around it, just pay it.\n\nCorkage Fee: $15 a bottle.  We purchased our own wine (Riesling, Chardonnay, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon) and paid the corkage fee.  We also purchased Hennessy Privilege from Costco and paid the corkage.  All alcohol was served at the bar.  No bottle of cognac at every table for us.  The guests complimented on the wine and said it went with the food.\n\nBartenders & Beverages: $2000 tab = three free bartenders. $1500 tab = 2 free bartenders.  $1000 tab = 1 free bartender.  This was fine.  It was good that Yank Sing has their own alcohol and we just went with the per drink option.  $7.50 low end / $8.50 middle / $9.50 premium.  $4.50 per bottle of beer.  $2.50 per non alcoholic beverage at the bar. Corkage is separate and does not count towards the tab.\n\nSoda & Ciders: Mandatory $6 per bottle per table.  We had Cider & 7-up, that's $12 a table.\n\nCake Cutting Fee: Yup, Chinese restaurant that has cake cutting fee $2/pp. \n\nChairs: We got our chiavari chairs through Yank Sing's preferred vendor, Especially Yours. See Especially Yours review.\n\nLinens: We used their linens.  Otherwise there are extra costs associated with using different color linens.\n\nCandle Fee: $160 to get your candles checked out, since Yank Sing is a historic building.  We just use lighting and minimal candles. They have these votive candles that can be used.  Check out \"enhanced lighting\" review.\n\nFood: The menu ranges from $578 to 938 per table.  Veggie plate was $40 a plate.  They are accommodating to moving things around the menus and customizing it so it worked.  For example, upgrading to abalone, adding lobster, switching out prawn dishes, etc. \n\nPre dinner reception: $1.50 - $2.50 per dim sum (like one har gow).  We decided to have a dessert bar instead and brought in cupcakes, candies, cheeses, and croissants.  This doubled as a pre dinner reception.\n\nTax and Gratuity: 8.5% tax in 2012, and 18% mandatory gratuity.  The bartenders made it out like a bandit that night! Double tip!\n\nCost for an extra hour: we didn't use this but there is a cost associated with this.  I think it's several hundred dollars.\n\nParking: There is a small garage downstairs that fits about 60-80 cars.  The place fills up quick! So use street parking .  Usually you'll find something within' a 3 block radius.  Street parking and meters are free after 6:00 pm.  \n\nTwo events can happen at the same time.  They can rent out the inside restaurant to another party.  They won't tell you this unless you ask.  The inside space typically doesn't rent out until the month or two before the date. \n\nTo raise the sweetheart table costs $600.  We skipped this option.\n\nService:  The service is TOP NOTCHED for a Chinese style banquet meal.  Bartenders walked around to serve our wine, and they were VERY accommodating.  Our guests kept on complimenting us about the service because they were not used to having a Chinese restaurant be good", "author": "Carrie-C N."}

You get the idea, it adds up quickly as you order the small dishes that come around and bite them off.  My recommendation, come for the food and don't order any drinks, just water or tea.

When my parents and I were attempting to look for a place to go to for dinner after we first landed in SF, we went inside the Rincon Plaza, and saw that not one peep was heard; the lights were dimmed; no one was there to help us take us where we needed to go.  Then, as I went to check the business hours of Yank Sing, it said that they are only opened for lunch from 11:00am-3pm.  I thought, \"Wait...that can't be right.\"  Then I remembered that night, I checked their website; I was right...they really don't open for dinner. #Dangit\n\nThe previous morning, I had met up with my cousin, and we had lunch; the place was pretty busy, and of course...the food?  Looked delicious.  We had ordered the pickled jicama salad, and I pretty much devoured the whole plate (yes, that's how great it tasted); my dad asked. \"Anyone up for a second plate?\"  Then my cousin just laughed, and replied \"yes.\"  \n\nI've read a lot of reviews of this place on the spinach mushroom dumplings and truth be told, I wasn't actually a big fan of them; guess my taste buds didn't quite agree.  The soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) were great (but, they couldn't compare to Ding Tai Fung in Shanghai or Arcadia, CA), and the honey-glazed sea bass...?

We talked to our waiter and got some recommendations on dishes we've never tried, ordered things straight from her, and picked up several dishes from the carts rolling by. \n\nOne of the best things we had were the soup dumplings, which are near impossible to find where we traveled from. \n\nThe char siu bao here is very good. The meat is not as sweet as some other places, but it has a bit more complexity in flavor with some different spices. The meat to dough ratio was also pretty good. \n\nWe were brought a chicken dish and asked if we wanted it for $8. We passed the first time, but the second time they asked us, we gave in and got the spicy chicken. It was good, but after eating for a while, our lips got a tad numb from the peppercorns. \n\nWe also got sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves (a dish we usually don't get), and it was good. The shrimp was a tad too fishy and overpowered the other proteins, but other than that, it was delicious. \n\nWe ordered some pan-fried chive dumplings and they were also good. The outside wasn't as crispy as I would have liked, but the inside had great texture. The filling was so simple, but it really let the quality of the ingredients shine. \n\nThe prices for dishes here are a little bit more expensive than in Chinatown, but I was happy to pay the extra dollar or two per dish. My only regret is that we went here after visiting the farmers market, so the space I had reserved in my stomach for the beckoning, jiggling orange gelatin dessert had been filled by fruit slices, nuts, and bread. \n\nAt least now I have an excuse to go again next time! \n\nAfter going to dim sum in San Francisco, it is very hard to be satisfied with what is available locally.", "author": "Nicole O."}

However, it is really pricey and dim sum brunch for 3 came out to over $100 for us. \n\nThe must-gets are the xiao long bao (Shanghai soup dumplings) and the steamed BBQ pork buns -- I don't even like BBQ pork buns, but the ones here are SO light and fluffy with quality pork inside that is savory and sweet, that I ate two. I wouldn't get them anywhere else. The pea shoot dumplings are the best veggie option here, I think, very delicate and fresh.\n\nIf you're a first timer, make sure to learn how to eat xaio long bao (helpful link here: http://www.foodrepublic.com/2014/01/30/how-eat-soup-dumplings-step-step-guide-red-farms-e). My preferred way is to eat the first one plain, and then think about the chili vinegar. The soup is so rich, I usually put a spoonful of the ginger-chili vinegar on the bottom of my soup spoon, let the dumpling absorb it through the skin, bite the top knot, suck the soup, and then slurp up the rest of the dumpling with the runny soup that spilled out + meat + dumpling + vinegar. \n\nOther items are worth skipping though... the potstickers are just so-so, the jello desserts are all a waste of time (they look cool though), and sometimes the veggie dishes are cold from being pushed around for a while. \n\nAnd they do have vegetarian/vegan friendly options; the spinach dumplings and pea shoot dumplings, especially, as well as the cabbage and walnut salad.", "author": "Laura J."}

I think you get what you pay for. They served excellent food and the wait staff/bartenders were professional. The water fountain in the middle added a nice touch. When it was time for dancing, they covered the fountain floor with a dance floor. Really neat. The second wedding I went to was held inside Yank Sing. It was nice and the seating arrangement wasn't too crowded like it can be in other Chinese seafood restaurants. Again, staff was professional and they were attentive. \n\nI saw Yank Sing on The Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate. They featured the baked bbq pork buns. I have yet to try the dim sum there. I hear, it's quite expensive dining here in general. My parents said they had dinner at Yank Sing once and the waiter kept pressuring them to order all the expensive dishes.

This will be very different in particular for native Chinese dim summers who are accustomed to loud conversations and needing to scream at someone across the table just to have a conversation, pushy carts, lack of care for decor, server 'tude and sometimes good/sometimes questionable food items. At Yank Sing, they offer total volume control, a combination of carts and servers presenting the food to you on-foot, a clean environment and hands-down the best customer service at a Chinese restaurant.\n\nFor food, don't go with the regular items (shrimp dumplings, shu mai, rice rolls, chicken feet, etc).  Those are very mediocre and not worth the extra money you pay.  Instead, Yank Sing has their own specialty versions of dumplings and other delicacies that will pleasantly surprise your taste buds.  They are very vegetarian-friendly and sensitive to allergies, always willing to check into an ingredient inquiry to confirm the ingredient list for the customer.  In Chinatown and most other dim sum restaurants, I usually receive a glare and then I'm told to \"just pick out whatever you're allergic to.\"  Vegetarians, they have an uh-may-zing steamed curry dumpling that is really worth at least a try.\n\nI'd take business associates here if they were interested in experiencing Chinese delicacies outside of the Americanized Chinese food, but Yank Sing can really put a damper in your wallet.  It cost us near $80 for only 3 people and we really did not eat that much (I think we had a total of 9-10 plates).  At a regular Chinese restaurant, that same bill would've probably been around $30, including tip.  My cousin did point out to me that we were in the Financial District though where business men and women frequent and that the actual Chinatown was still very much the same as everywhere else I've ever been to.  \n\nIf you don't give a hoot about decor, environment or customer service and only  want the simple, quick, down & dirty, go into actual Chinatown for dim sum.

We unfortunately got there too late, as the atrium was already booked, and decided to go forward with the restaurant. There was definitely a worry doing so that there wouldn't be enough staff, or the guests would get confused, etc. \n\nUpon arriving an hour early to check on things, I realized that they had barely started setting up. I asked around only to realize that they had just closed the dim sum portion of the day and didn't even allow my vendors in to set up until just then. I felt that to be a little unacceptable, as I was told beforehand that they close two hours before. Consequently, rather than relaxing and hanging out with my wedding party, I had to assign each and every person to do something so that we could be ready in time once the guests arrived. Again, they need to be very clear if we'll only be given an hour to set up, as I had A LOT of details I needed up and was under the impression that we'd have closer (or more than) two hours. \n\nSo being unhappy about that, why the 4 stars?

I just came back from Jing Fong today in Chinatown in NYC and the above order minus the extra dish I forgot came to $15.03.\n\nAnyway, I didn't get a chance to try other dim sum places but I would suggest reading other restaurant reviews to see if there are other places that might be better than here.  I'm sure with such a large Chinese population in SF there should be much better options.  From the other reviews, I seriously doubt this place is the best dim sum SF has to offer, if anything it's a place where only business people go for meetings (hmm, maybe that's why it's located in the Financial district in an office building).", "author": "C C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-24", "description": "When one side of your family is Portuguese-colonized Cantonese and the other side of your family is Shanghainese-Taiwanese (seriously, I'm a Chinese mutt), it's inevitable that you will become an expert on all things dim sum. Especially if you grow up in a city with a reputation for being one of the best dim sum cities in the world.\n\nI had high hopes that Yank Sing would be that elusive, upscale dim sum restaurant. The type of restaurant with traditional dishes done right and lots of unique, creative dishes added to the mix (like Casa Victoria in Toronto). Dim sum restaurants have such a bad reputation in the US of being these dirty, grimy, dingy hellholes with cheap, greasy food. It's been hard for me to convince even open-minded people that there is such a thing as a beautiful, modern dim sum restaurant with high-quality food and fantastic service.\n\nLet's just say, Yank Sing didn't exactly meet me halfway.....but maybe 10%. The service was definitely better than at other dim sum restaurants. However, take that with a grain of salt, since I do speak Mandarin and Cantonese, and it's always easier to converse with Chinese staff in their native language. The restaurant is pretty, but not in a sleek 'n' chic way--more antique-y, Old World beautiful (the kind of place you take your fiancee's strict, conservative parents).\n\nAnd the food. Because that's what it really all comes down to. \n\nKudos for the Walnut Shrimp. Score 1 for a creative non-traditional dish that quickly became my boyfriend's favorite. \n\nKudos for the Coconut Rice Roll with Custard, one of my favorite dim sum sweets. For some reason, it's very difficult to find this dessert at dim sum restaurants. The roll wasn't as sticky and thick as mochi (which is a good thing) and the custard was creamy, sweet and delicious. Score 2 for offering what many other dim sum restaurants don't.\n\nKudos for the Har Gow and Egg Tarts, traditional dim sum favorites done well. The shrimp were plump and juicy, and the pastry on the egg tarts literally melted in your mouth.\n\nKudos for the Char Siu Bao. Fluffy, white, perfectly sweetened dough, with well-minced meat inside.\n\nNo kudos for the Shu Mai. Greasy, overcooked, and missing the beloved yellow wrappers that are my favorite part of Shu Mai. \n\nNo kudos for the Vegetarian Dumplings. The skins were way too thick and the vegetable filling was missing any form of seasoning.\n\nNo kudos for the Bean Curd Rolls. Way too many water chestnuts, not enough other vegetables, and...is that sour I taste? No. Sour bad.\n\nNo kudos for the Soup Dumplings. OK, here's where I rant a bit: What is up with SF restaurants serving XLBs as part of Cantonese dim sum? First off, it's not a Cantonese dish. It's from Shanghai. Second, it's never done well. Like Yank Sing's had way too much ginger and barely any pork. And third, XLBs aren't even part of Shanghai dim sum! Nor should they be. Dim sum originated from the time of the Silk Road, when travelers would stop by tea houses to rest. Owners of said tea houses realized tea was good for digestion and began to serve small bites along with their tea. The food was created so that it would travel well, since travelers usually had to hit the road pretty soon Hence, dim sum favorites like well-cooked dumplings, thick-skinned buns and hardy pastries. Now, picture a soup dumpling with its thin skin and piping hot broth. Does that scream \"travels well\"? Didn't think so.\n\nWith a party of 10 ordering liberally, we each ended up paying $34 in total. Had it just been me doing all of the ordering, the total would probably have been in the $20s. Not bad either way, but certainly not the dirt cheap $10 or so of other dim sum restaurants. I don't think our experience was worth quite what we paid, but I don't feel ripped off either. All in all, glad I did it but probably won't seek to do it again.", "author": "Josephine L."}

Waiters come around with carts filled with a wide variety of options and you get to tell them what you want off the cart. It's a little weird to me that they still give you a menu because you never have a chance to order for yourself because these ladies come around so fast. Sometimes they can be a little rude because they always seem to be in a rush, but you do end up getting all the food you want by the end.\n\nI think I've tried every single one of their vegetarian options for dim sum and I LOVE all of them! Two of my favorites are the mushroom dumplings and the  steamed vegetable dumplings - both have great flavors and taste great, especially with their spicy mustard sauce. I've also tried the chicken lotus dumplings which were very tasty and had a flavor that was very unique - definitely recommend those as well! For dessert, I've gotten the mango pudding and the egg custard. I was a little skeptical about the egg custard because the name kind of put me off, but it was very yummy - tasted kind of like a caramel custard to me.

They did, however, warn me that it was pricey.  I didn't realize it was THAT expensive.  This place would've gotten a solid 5 star rating until I got our bill.  My boyfriend was in town and we usually get dim sum together, so it was a great opportunity to try out this place especially after the Chinatown fiasco, we were still searching for a good dim sum place in the city.\n\n+  BART accessible.  It's located right off the Embarcadero exit and near the Ferry Building.  My boyfriend and I are big on public transportation so it was a delight knowing it was a 2 minute walking distance from BART.\n\n+  We were seated pretty fast.  When we first walked it, we were shocked to see how packed it was and thought it would take forever to get a table.  They said our wait time was 10-15 minutes and they didn't lie about that.  It didn't feel like we waited an entire day to get a seat.\n\n+  Fast and friendly service.  One thing we normally get annoyed with dim sum places is how long we have to wait for a cart to come by even if we're the only few customers.  This place was different.  Even before we got sat down, 2 carts came by asking what we want.  WOW!  Never had that happen before.  Also, we never had to ask for water; it came without us asking.  The only thing we were asked was what kind of tea we want in which they have a variety (Jasmine, Oolong and Chrysanthemum for instance).\n\n+  Food and tea.  We ordered the following typical dishes - Har Gaw, Soup Dumplings, Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and 2 Shu Mai.  All of which were very delicious and absolutely fantastic.  It was certainly the best one we've gone to in the city.  The food was also very hot and fresh from the kitchen; I hate having lukewarm dishes that's been seating in the carts for a while.  We also got the Chrysanthemum tea and it was also just as great.  It was adequately rich in flavor and the aroma was wonderful.  The serving pot was pretty cute too.  It was a clear pot so you can see your tea steeping; no guessing on when it's okay for you to start drinking.\n\n+/-  Price.  Now here is where I'm on the fence.  I'm an avid advocate of getting your money's worth for good food, but I'm also a devoted promoter of \"cheap but good\" food.  Living by yourself in the Bay Area is expensive so spending on a lot of money for dining experiences is a touchy area.  For 6 dishes, our bill came out to be about $60 (including tip, and the tea was $3.90/pot).  That's about 3 times more expensive than any dim sum places I've gone to.  I don't deny that it was good dim sum, but I wish I can say that I can be a regular at this place.

I've had dim sum at countless places since childhood.  I would like to think that I have a good handle on what good dim sum should taste like, but honestly, I don't think I've visited enough of the world to cast an 'expert' judgment.  My experiences have only been all over California.  Should be good enough though.  Seriously.  I've eaten a lot of dim sum.  A lot.\n\nI've had dim sum all over the SF Bay and the one thing I can be certain of is that I've never really had good dim sum in SF itself.  Not that I haven't tried to find a place--of the numerous places I've been in the city, I just haven't found one worth praising.  Well, it took me a while to get around to Yank Sing and I'm glad I was finally able to give it a go.\n\nYank Sing, looking past some of its peculiarities, delivers on some pretty tasty dim sum dishes.  The staples were all certainly there.  The flavor was mostly there.  Note that the restaurant definitely caters more toward a Western palate.  That shouldn't bother you unless you're a diehard traditionalist.  There are some subtle hints and also some not-so-subtle, brazen applications in their dish preparation.  One look across the dining room and adjoining atrium and I knew why--there's a great diversity of well-to-do patrons.  As such, the service was far better and friendlier than your average Chinese restaurant that only gets frequented by Chinese folks.\n\nI won't get into all of the dishes that we had, but know that they were pretty decent and  properly cooked. Some oddities: The Peking duck buns were abominable.  Too much fatty duck meat on the cut, skin nowhere near crispy enough. Shanghai dumplings, while tasty, certainly not worth writing home about.  While every other bay area Shanghai Dumpling place is certainly a D- or F, Yank Sing hits a good enough dough thickness to juice to meaty flavor ratio to earn a C. \n\nWhoa, I had a few double takes: there was a lot of stuff that I really wouldn't normally associate with dimsum: honey walnut prawns during dimsum?  Not seen before in my lifetime!  Grilled sea bass steaks?  Cabbage salad? Hmm.  I guess if it sells, it sells.  Being that I'm not exactly an authentic Asian guy myself, I can't be too hypocritical.\n\nAt the end of the day after all of the tea was consumed and all of the mile-high piles of steamer baskets and empty plates were taken away, we were stuffed and left with the bill.  The price was definitely high for dim sum.  Probably the most expensive dim sum I've had anywhere.  Was it worth it?  Sure.  For now it reigns as the top spot in the city for 'deem sum'.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-02", "description": "High class dim sum food in San Francisco. When visiting this foggy city one of the places you must visit is Yank Sing. Famous for their dim sum and flavorful condiments which are sold nation wide. I personally love this place because of the delicate hand made dim sum dishes. They are served the traditional way on carts and they are steaming hot. So why Yank Sing versus any other dim sum joints? It may be slightly more expensive than your average dim sum joint, but the quality of the food is unmatched and the service is wonderful. You can easily have a business lunch here or just come here for a casual breakfast. \n\nThe key is to arrive early, before the doors open. There is an indoor seating area to wait in. Parking is a bit tight, but there is a garage below the building.They will validate your ticket for up to three hours. If you're up for a little walk after your meal you should venture towards the pier, it's right across the street and visit the cupids bow and arrow sculpture. Cash or credit is accepted.\n\nHere's a quick lesson / guide of dim sum etiquette, following with a list of items to look for. This can be applied to most Dim Sum establishments. Dim sum originates from Hong Kong. It's a whole breakfast affair that deals with a wide variety of food which is all shared, family style. Ideally go with two or more people so everyone can have a bite from each dish, but hey it doesn't hurt to dine alone, that just means you'll have left overs to take home if you decide to try a variety of food, which I highly recommend. Traditionally men and women would put on their Sunday best for dim sum dates. Almost everything is hand made, and steamed. There are vegetarian dishes, but it's not an ideal cuisine for those with gluten allergies or who are kosher. You may order drinks and other specific dishes from your waiter but the food is ordered directly from the ladies or men who come by with carts. The prices per dish ranges anywhere from $3.50 to $9 and you won't know until they stamp it on your check at the table upon ordering. You may ask to see what is in the cart if there is a language barrier or if you're curious. In a way, dim sum is Chinese soul food, the real deal what you can expect from a visit to Hong Kong.\n\nThe good stuff: aka what I always get\nHagow - shrimp dumpling in a clear noodle three pieces\nLo-mai-gai - fabulously wrapped little sticky rice balls filled with all sorts of pork, Shrimp, veggies. Comes in three pieces. \nShumai- pork meatballs in a noodle with minced vegetables. I always dip it in Yank Sings chili sauce which is at every table. four pieces to an order\nChar sew bow- red pork in a white bun. three pieces, for meat lovers, but I know people who will devour the bread part only, fascinating how they steam the buns.\nlo-bak-go- turn up cakes made with dried shrimp and pieces of pork. they're square and come in three.\nChicken feet- I don't always get these, but they're popular among the older Chinese people. My grandparents enjoy them, so in some cases I have one or two, but people are usually scared of this. Comes in a pile. Sorry I don't know the Chinese name for this. \nPork Spare Ribs- Don't know the Chinese name but these bad boys are some of my favorites! Depending on the time of year they can be cooked with squash or taro roots. They're cooked and served with bones in and this is the only dish I order one specifically for myself and a separate one for my friends or the table to share.They look pale with a light glaze sauce, so good. I eat them with my hands, don't worry, not rude. \nDan tat- an egg custard brought to China from Portugal. This is a very popular treat that you can find at most Chinese bakeries. But I'd order them here, you know they'll be fresh and hot. Comes in three, enjoyed as a dessert.\nBeng doi- sesamie covered balls filled with red bean or some sweet bean. comes in three, enjoyed as a dessert.\n\nI hope the above helped out especially if this is your first time having dim sum. You don't need to know Chinese to dine here, but if you have a friend that speaks Chinese it will be a plus. I don't speak Chinese, I only speak dim sum. I'm always opened to try new dishes, but after ordering all those other dishes there's hardly any room to fit new foods into my dim sum list.", "author": "Trisha W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-10", "description": "Having heard of Yank Sing during my college days across the way, I've long avoided it for the simple reason that I've grown up with dim sum as something that was simple, enjoyable, and most importantly, affordable. Yank Sing fails miserably in the last of these, coming in at a mildly obscene and outrageous $60 after tax for a mere six dishes.\n\nMy lunch companion (who is a much greater fan of this place) and I ended up ordering soup dumplings, shrimp dumplings, vegetarian dumplings, snow pea dumplings (I swear it'll change up soon), sesame balls, and sticky rice. And while these dishes were all good, and the soup dumplings were made particularly well (as one would expect: very soupy, with delicately thin wrappers), they were not of a quality enough to justify double the price of any other dim sum restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nFor those that do still insist on coming, reservations are highly recommended, as many, many others seem to find that the food does justify the price tag here - that, or because any other decent dim sum restaurant is a bit out of the way.", "author": "Johnny W."}

And we were not even seated inside the restaurant.  Just the atrium...???!\"  Well, sad to say nothing has changed other than it is more expensive than 3 years ago.  And we ate more with more people the last time we went there.  Around $150 for five people this time.  Luckily we had gift certificates.  My two boys used to think highly of this place, but after becoming more experienced dim sum eaters...they kept griping about the cost!  Guess I have brought up my young grass-hoppers well!\n\nHere's the breakdown, the Peking Duck at $5.70 per serving was not up to par.  Skin was not crispy.  The $19 Honey Basted Seabass was nothing compared to the first time we had it although it has jumped up in price tremendously.  The boys kept reminding me that it would have tasted better roasted with a miso glaze.... could have had a whole steamed fish for that price in Chinatown.  Fried Soft Shell Crab was tasty...reminded me of a mini-fried dungness crab from R&G Lounge.  Traditional Siu Mai and Har Guow were over $6 for four pieces....The steamed food did not come out piping hot but more luke warm.  Yechh...\n\nBe careful with the fancy glass teapot as it pours extremely fast.  We spilled and saw two tables near us spill.  The tea does not retain heat in the glass pots either.  I believe they sell the teapots but suggest you pass on purchasing the good looking but inefficient and dangerous pots.  Very good service....\n\nThank goodness for gift certificates.\n\nNote:  I remember going to the first Yank Sing on Broadway right below Stockton in the early 70s.  It had the best BBQ Pork Bun where slices of just bbq'd pork were served in an open faced steamed bun with scallions and more BBQ sauce.  Someone should revive that concept!

The place is nice, fancy schmancy, good for wedding banquets, I suppose, although the one time I came for a wedding banquet, I wasn't impressed by the food, it was not memorable. The atrium is pretty and the water fall from above creates an ambiance of sophistication but I'm here to eat.\n\nThe dim sum fare are standard and none of the regular fares (har gow, siu mai, etc.) was impressive. The prices seem on the steep side for what they give you in quality and quantitiy although I didn't pay, but I'm sure my in-laws felt it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-03", "description": "First off, I noticed that most of the clientele at this restaurant were white people, not Chinese. This means that they cater to a different target market from the various dim sum restaurants in Chinatown and elsewhere in the Bay Area. However, it doesn't mean the food here is bad; in fact the quality is very good and perhaps surprisingly, the dim sum are quite authentic as well. I do agree with many of the reviewers here that the biggest problem here is price. Or rather, what you (don't) get for the price you pay. It's easy to establish that a meal here costs at least twice as much as it would at any of the other decent dim sum restaurants in and around SF - just compare the menus. Unfortunately, there's not much that they offer to justify this price difference. The food here is good, but not significantly better than elsewhere. The service? If anything, it's WORSE here than your average dim sum place. There are some items that they don't carry on the carts, which you need to order yourself. But none of the staff will come to your table to take your order, so you'll have to hunt them down yourself. And they only send 2 or 3 carts around the very large restaurant, so getting something you want could take a long, long time.\n\nI can think of two things that Yank Sing has going for it. The first is their location. If you work close by, then obviously this is going to be your go-to place. For those living outside of SF (or even just another part of SF), it's not worth traveling here for dim sum - go to Chinatown instead and save your money. The second is that their staff knows better English than at most Chinese restaurants, which is helpful for non-Chinese customers. I wouldn't be surprised if this fact alone is responsible for many of the awards that they win.", "author": "Bo D."}

We were the only asians dining there, haha big red flag already. If people from the same ethnicity as the restaurant are not dining there, that really tells you something. When I looked around the other tables and there were wine glasses present, I really tried not to be bias towards the food.\n\nWe ordered the normal stuff for Dim Sum, egg tarts, chicken feet, BBQ Pork Buns, ground beef rice flour rolls, and of course the XLB (Xiao Long Bao, Shanghai Dumplings). We actually came here especially for the Xiao Long Bao, because we heard so much good things about it. Wow, were we sorely disappointed. The xiao long bao here are not uniformly made, the skin is too thick and filling is not consistent from one dumpling to another. I have never had such a bad experience eating xiao long bao. It is very tough to have proper XLB when you've had them from Din Tai Fung in Taiwan; hands down the best I have had. The locations in Arcadia are second, but still the best in the United States. Don't waste your appetite on the XLB here, they are very poorly executed.\n\nThe rest of the dim sum items were not special at all, and with the inflated price tag on every dish, I demand a wow factor.\n\nAll and all a very subpar dim sum place, not for me. But if you are intimidated by the normal dim sum restaurants where they only speak chinese, then this might be a good place for you, since all the servers speak english too.

Very super unreasonable for dim-sum $$$$$$$.\nFirst of all, their \"House special\" Shanghai Pork Dumpling. Looks delicious and indeed it was, but $14 for 6 pcs. What !? World famous Din Tai Fung only charge $9.5 for 10 pcs, and they are more professional too.\nSecond, Pork & Shrimp Siu Mye, it's nothing special than other dim-sum places, but you have that $7.15 for 4 pcs.\nNext, fried \"Sweet rice dumpling\"... bro you over-fried it, and it was $10.70 for 4 pcs.\nAnd peking duck rolled through, looks delicious, ordered 2 (funny it was priced by buns), $6.55 each bun. ($13.10 for 2 buns w/ little meats, and it wasn't really crispy). With same price, I could get a half duck with 6+ buns.\nMost ridiculous one, Egg custard Tart 4 pcs for $11.70, FXXX these are only 3 for $1.60 at Chinatown.\nI stopped ordering after I was aware of their pricing... total came up about $85 before tips for 2 people, and we were not full.\nOther things to be mentioned, they have 4 Spring Rolls for $10.70, and Wonton soup for $14, lol.\n\nThey have the old fashion style food carts and the dim-sum card stamping, but each food have their individual ridiculous pricing.\nCOME ON PLEASE, YOU CAN GET ALL THESE FOODS IN MULTIPLE DIM-SUM RESTAURANTS OVER CHINATOWN THAT ARE FEW BLOCKS AWAY THAT ARE WAY CHEAPER WITH EQUAL QUALITY OR EVEN BETTER.\n\nI'm a college student, their price didn't seem right to me.

However, since then, I'm frequented many dim sum places across the Bay area, and I have a better idea of what's good and what's not (at least to my palate).\n\nI'd heard a lot about Yank Sing prior to coming.  Mainly that: 1. the food was really good, and 2. the prices were really high.  Based on how popular it is, I was expecting a long wait.  I preferred to sit inside (for fear of getting less attention outside), but even then, the wait was not bad (less than 15 minutes at 11am on a Saturday).\n\nOne thing that I noticed right away (and kept noticing throughout) was that the service here was AMAZING.  It far exceeds any dim sum place, and is amazing even if you were discounting that it's a dim sum place.  All the carts seemed to make sure to stop at each table and get us food right away.  Before we had finished sitting down, we had 3 plates in front of us.  On top of that, when we asked about one dish, they were prompt to call in another person to bring that cart over to us.  As if that weren't amazing already, when we asked about another dish that they had run out of, they made it fresh for us and it came out piping hot!!\n\nNow onto the food.  The best things for me were the har gow (the outside of the dumpling was soooo soft and good), the egg custard buns (this was the dish that came out piping hot and they were definitely worth the wait -- best egg custard buns I've ever had), and the egg tarts.\n\nSome of the other dishes were a bit lackluster for me, for instance, the shrimp crepe dish (don't know what it's called in Chinese), which had chives mixed in and had a sweet soy sauce rather than a regular soy sauce -- this is usually my favorite dim sum dish and these two differences made me like it less.  The siu mai and the shanghai soup dumplings (a.k.a. xiao long bao; served lukewarm) were also not as good as I've had elsewhere.\n\nWhen the bill came out, it wasn't cheap by any means, but I've had just about that much at other places (about $33/person including tax and tip).  I think that for the service and quantity of food, the price was actually not bad!  Had we had a 4th person, the value might've been even better.  However, given that it's pricier than other dim sum places, this is probably a \"splurge when I can\" place.\n\nThank you Yank Sing for the amazing service!!

This restaurant caters to the fancy business FiDi people so don't visit anticipating authentic dim sum.\n\nI'm the great, great, great granddaughter of the almighty dim sum creator--joking. However, I do know my dim sum, and Yank Sing offers decent food at best. Yes, this is an upscale Chinese restaurant with good service. Yes, the dim sum dishes are aesthetically pleasing. Yes, you pay close to an arm and a leg for your meal. Yet, at the end, the dim sum is just OK. I came here for a lunch meeting with a party of eight. Our bill was well over $200 before tips (but I'm unsure if they autograt). If you have to pay $20+ individually for dim sum, it better be the best damn dim sum outside of Hong Kong (note: which Yank Sing is not).\n\nWe ordered the typical items: shrimp dumplings, siu mai (shrimp and pork dumplings), shrimp rice noodle rolls, shrimp and chives dumplings, BBQ pork buns (baked AND steamed), potstickers, egg tarts, and spring rolls. We even had honey walnut prawns! All of these dishes were average, although I did not try everything. I know, we ate A LOT of shrimp. \n\nI opted for some of the less Americanized stuff and asked for the ham sui gok (deep-fried pork dumplings), deep-fried taro puffs, chicken feet, and sticky rice in lotus leaf. I didn't eat the chicken feet but they looked measly. The rest of the dishes were actually pretty tasty. The ham sui gok was crunchy and chewy with a sweet honey shell but the meat filling lacked seasoning. The taro puffs were good but not enough taro flavor. I really enjoyed the sticky rice; it was moist and packed with pork and saucy goodness. This was by far my favorite item. \n\nOverall, everything was mediocre and bland. The dim sum wasn't too greasy, which is a plus. Yank Sing's selection is relatively small compared to other restaurants. I wish they had more choices but they are serving a different crowd. The wraps for the dumplings were too thick and hard. Portions are on the smaller side. Yank Sing does have a few vegetarian items but it's really difficult to do vegetarian for dim sum (their mushrooms dumplings were alright).

Then you just take the elevator up to the restaurant. Oh and make sure you get your parking validated! \n\nThe place was pretty packed, never an empty table.

Everything was good except the cod was kind of overcooked and cold but it was still good.

Inquiry/meeting as potential wedding reception site:\n\nI'm getting married and because I'm Chinese there was no way I was going to serve my family American food. God forbid I make my grandma eat a salad!\nHowever, I also wanted to host my reception at a \"nice\" venue. I looked high and low for a Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area that did not have tacky decor (you know what I mean - flying dragons). The choices are limited and the other \"high-end\" Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area just didn't work out for with some of our priorities. \n\nYank Sing seemed to meet all of our needs:\n-Aesthetically-pleasing Chinese food \n- We could book the entire restaurant to accommodate our 100 guests and thus, did not have to share the space with other restaurant patrons (not possible with HK East Ocean unless we wanted to fork over $20,000).\n-Beautiful decor and ambience\n-Great reviews on service\n-Validated parking for guests\n\nWe met with Daisy Hung who was very professional, prompt, and answered all of our questions in great detail. We were considering our menu combinations and Daisy worked with us to reprice out all of our menu substitutions.\n\nSince we did not want to spent close to $1000 on a tasting, we decided to try their dim sum.\n\n2. Dim sum experience: \n\nSo my fiance and I made a reservation for dim sum on a weekend. I don't know about weekdays, but if you don't make reservations you will probably not eat. The place was completely packed.\n\nInitially the cart pushers were very prompt and attentive. We ordered several traditional dim sum items as well as some food that's more likely served at banquets  and dinners such as the honey walnut shrimp, fried crab claws, and Chilean sea bass. Everything was very good. Not overly greasy.\n\nTowards the end, the carts didn't seem to stop by as often. I wanted to try their mango pudding since that was to be served at the wedding. It took about 10 minutes for someone to get this to me.\n\nWhen it was time to get the check it seemed like they were not concerned about all the people waiting for a table. We told them that we were ready to get the check. Waited for about 5 minutes and then my fiance goes to the restroom. When he is done, the check is still not ready. I went to the restroom, came back, and still no check. We had to flag several waitstaff for the check and after waiting about a total of 20 minutes we finally got it.\n\nI knew this was not going to be a cheap meal especially because we got the sea bass. However, $90 on dim sum for 2 people is just insane. Seriously, you can get dim sum on par to this place for half the price. The food was really good, but not THAT good.\n\n3. Booking Yank Sing for wedding venue: NOT POSSIBLE for 2014\n\nDespite the slow service towards the end of our meal, we still wanted to book Yank Sing for our reception site. \n\nWe were emailing Daisy back and forth and wanted to see about the pricing for a few menu substitutions. We didn't hear from her for a few days and she said that she's been busy with wedding banquets and will get back to us the following week. No word from her that week so we send a follow-up email. For another week, still no word from her. Finally after about 2 and a half weeks, we get this email from her: \n\n\"Thank you for your email, my sincere apologies for the delay. \n\nUnfortunately, after much thought and consideration, our company has made a decision to restructure our business model and therefore will not be taking events from 2014 onwards. We sincerely thank you for considering Yank Sing for your special day, and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. \n\nWith kind regards,\nDaisy\"\n\nAt this point, I was really upset. We had been communicating for about 2 months and was looking forward to checking this item off my list. Now back to square one.\n\nIn the end, I think things will all work out! We found a reception site and booked Ginger Cafe for our catering. So far, they've been so amazing. I'll write an official review after our wedding.\n\nFinal words: Try Yank Sing if you want to impress your date and have the funds to overspend on dim sum. I'm glad that I got to try this place, but I will not be returning.\n\nGlad to get this off my chest!!!\n\ntl;dr -  Good food, but too expensive for dim sum. Long wait time to receive check.

They just kept bringing things around and I tried them all. I loved every bite. \n\nIt was crazy busy, over an hour wait for two people at 3pm so we snagged two seats at the bar and the owner or manager came over to us and asked us to let her know if there was anything on the menu that we wanted to try but was not coming around.

It isn't the best, but you can tell it is high quality and tasty. The standard har gao and siu mai were good and the xiao long bao was amazing! Must order if you do go.\n\nWhat causes me to second guess is a few things. The queue is atrociously long. For a table of two, we literally had to wait an hour. I understand that it's popular, but the food does not warrant that long of a wait, in my opinion. Next, this place is expensive! This place will yank your wallet and make you sing Usher's \"OMG\" (see what I did there?). Don't even think about the cheap dim sum you could have had nearby in Chinatown because it'll ruin your experience. Third, this place caters to the dim sum newbie so I'm constantly having to shoo away carts that have these contemporary/fusiony dishes that probably look better on paper than in reality. This means I have to make an effort to scout out all the traditional dishes I want. I'm here to eat, not accomplish an assassination mission.\n\nAll jokes aside, Yank Sing is good, but all of those set backs are enough for me to not come back often.", "author": "David P."}

For a group of 3~4, you're expecting a check that's way over $100. Now, in order to justify this tag, one or more has to meet from the follows:\n\n1) Taste: it is good, but not the best in SF. Except for the Xiao Long Bao, many steamed Dim Sum are just around par. The wraps are slightly thick, ingredients are not superb, taste/spice was just around the norm.\n\n2) Variety: most streamed/fried Dim Sums are the usual suspects. I was expecting more authentic variety; again at this price tag. \n\n3) Service: personally, the biggest thing that matter in Dim Sum is the speed, and that's not just because I want it first, but it's because the Dim Sum's taste quickly degrades after it leaves the kitchen. I think this is the reason why some of the modernized/westernized restaurants (e.g., Din Tai Fung) are not using the cart, but directly serving from the kitchen. There cart speed (or number of carts) are just around average.\n\n4) Quality: At this price, you can't expect a single Dim Sum to go wrong.

The great variety of dishes are fine and delicious.  The dumplings are very juicy, savory, and delicate.  Unfortunately, saltiness is a notorious characteristic of Chinese food- but not here.  You are able to taste so much more of the flavors instead of MSG.  I wasn't a big fan of the rice noodle rolls though- very strange, gummy texture, like it was undercooked, which was very disappointing.\n\nHowever, with all that this restaurant has going for it, there are a few drawbacks.  First is the price- it's outrageous!  Despite the quality, I find it incomprehensible that it's so much more expensive than anywhere else.  It's not justified.  Also, they charge a lot for tea!  For something that is practically indiscernible from other restaurants, it is ridiculous that they would try to trick you into paying so much for something so simple.  They're also a little pushy with the food and are constantly hawking you.\n\nI would say that eating here is a nice treat to have once in while.  But for the most part, I would much rather go to a neighborhood place in the Sunset or Richmond.  Yank Sing tends to cater more towards Westerners and non-Chinese patrons.  But hey, it's in the Rincon Center- it's all about \"presentation.\"", "author": "Brandon C."}

We had our usual dilemma of the fact that my friend is Northern Chinese (and speaks Mandarin), so none of us spoke Cantonese, but since we weren't in Chinatown, and we were at very popular and accessible (for anyone wanting to try dim sum) Yank Sing, it was fine. Also, while I did wonder if this was as \"authentic\" as other dim sum spots, my friends convinced me that Yank Sing uses better quality ingredients. It was delicious, just as expected.\n\nAlso, I really, really, REALLY loved the soup dumplings (and did not break one!) #firsttime", "author": "Sally M."}

This place had some great reviews so we decided to commandeer a larger group of friends and check this place out.\n\nThe venue was spacious, definitely packed on a Saturday, however, the perfect thing about dim sum is that it's instant, the food is on every cart just at arms reach. They have tons of food options! So many delicious options, however, we were very surprised with how expensive our bill turned out to be.

What a mistake. The dim sum was mediocre at best. \n--I couldn't eat the dry fried string beans because they were too salty and boring, as if salt could make up for tasteless vegetables.\n--The siu mai had lumps of tough meat in it, and again no real flavor; \n--the char gow tasted like they came from, at best, Trader Joe's.\n--The cabbage salad tasted only of that herb that tastes like soap (I'm not talking about cilantro, either, which I love). \n--The shrimp-covered deep fried lobster claws were rubbery and tasteless, even tasted like old refrigerator once you got through the fried breading.\n--The eggplant was the ONLY good dish we had, out of seven choices.\n\n I would NEVER go here again; City View is much better. Hong Kong Lounge in the Richmond is **way** better. And East Ocean in Alameda, much much better.

They raved about this place so much that we had to see it for ourselves.  \nYank Sing is located in a commercial highrise, so it was a bit odd since you have to take an elevator, when you arrive at the lobby level you really don't feel like you are going into a restaurant, it feels like you are there to meet with your account or something. The restaurant faces the atrium which has lots of natural light and a water feature from high above, it is nice to stroll around while waiting or after stuffing your face with dimsum.  The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated, again it looks like an commercial office space and especially not your typical Chinese restaurant.  Personally, I love it!  Tired of the same-o dragon, phoenix, koi pond, etc. theme.  \nWe arrived pretty early and were able to grab a table right away.  The food was very good!  The Hargow (Shrimp balls) are my favorite item to order at dimsum so we got some of that right away.  I have to say, these are probably the best ones I've had.  The skin is ultra thin so you get lots of shrimp taste and not so much of the skin which is usually what I see in most places.  The \"main attraction\" was the Xiao Long Pao's, they are mini steamed buns with pork and when you bite into it it has pork juice that is usually pretty darn hot.  You dip them into vinegar and ginger.  They were REALLY good!  A very close second to my favorite ones from Din Tai Fung.  We also ordered some braised string beans, it had good flavor but it was cold.  I would love to go back and try more dishes in the future.  We were in a hurry since we had to catch a flight back to S. Cal. so we didn't get to really sit there and try all the different dishes they had, but", "author": "Tania S."}

I really like their mushroom, curry, snow peas and vegetable dumplings.

My boo and his cousins were in town and we heard this was THE place to get dim sum so I was hoping it would turn the tide of mediocrity I experienced in LA. \n\nWe had reservations which was a good thing as this place was packed on a Sunday at noon. The restaurant actually expands into the building lobby on the weekends for just this reason and we were lucky enough to sit next to the waterfall right in the center.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was like that of any other Dim Sum place but for twice the price (seriously, we spent nearly $50 a head on a just barely stomach filling meal). If it's not in some sort of bland dumpling dough or drowned in brown sauce, it was over cooked vegetables and indiscernible animal parts masquerading as meat.\n\nThe service is pretty standard with carts running all over the place, servers yelling across the room and a constant negotiation with clanging tins to see if you'll eat now or wait for the next trolley. Some people enjoy this hustle when they go out to eat. I can handle it if the food is worth the price but I can safely say this place tastes like any other.

Portions were on the larger side and taste was definitely there. Only knocking off a star due to its high prices. \n\nCame here on a Sunday and the overflow seating was situated in the courtyard of the Rincon highrise professional building. Definitely more seating here than their 49 Stevenson St location.\n\nGood service. Only waited 10 minutes at 12pm on a Sunday!  Maybe the crowds were out watching the America's Cup. Carts endlessly came around and if you didn't want anything from their cart the first 2 times, they didn't incessantly ask you each time they rolled around for the next 1.5 hrs which I appreciate. Waiters/waitresses were attentive, raised your hand and someone was there. Empty tea, and it was filled within the minute. \n \n2 dishes stood out to me. First the cheung fan was super packed with cha siu. Usually there might be just a thin row of filling in this dish but they didn't skimp on the ingredients here.  In fact, the har gao and siu mai, were ALL stuffed.  \nThe other dish was the sea bass. Its price is quite steep but the fish was cooked, seared, and marinated to perfection. Very tender, almost melted in my mouth and no bones! You can either ask to have this ordered or they constantly walk around with it in their hands asking if anyone wants one. \n\nProbably not an everyday dim sum place for me due to the price but a nice place to hit up if you are from out of town and wanting a little more upscale than the joints in chinatown.", "author": "Jonny I."}

A local SF institution for over 60 years, and 3 generations of the Chan family, serves up cart fulls of delicious bites and flavors to mouth watering patrons.  A great weekend lunch spot, or really anytime of the day or week, get ready to satisfy all your Chinese food cravings.\n\nA few go-to favorites are featured here but definitely mix and match to your hearts content.  A great way to sample a few selections is to visit Yank Sing To Go in Rincon Center.\n\nShanghai Dumplings - These are savory soup dumplings garnished with pickled carrots.  You lift the dumplings from their tops and place on a soup spoon to catch all the juices.  Best to put the whole thing in your mouth at once and then bit down. mmmmmm!\n\nPeking Duck - the duck is carted around the restaurant and dished table side.  It's hard not to immediately think of the movie A Christmas Story and imagining the duck smiling at you :)  Its a signature dish here and the honey roasted crispy skin and delicate meat is to die for.  It's served with a soft bun, scallions, and hoison sauce to be assembled before eating.  One of my favorites!\n\nMeat Bun - steamed, fluffy, soft, gushy, BBQ-y....  I literally can eat like 5 of these at once.\n\nWalnut Shrimp - a favorite.  Caramelized walnuts, served next to fried shrimp, served on shredded lettuce.  I would have been fine just eating this.\n\nSpicy Sezchuan chicken with chili - No we didn't eat the chilies but all the spice and flavor infused the fried chicken pieces.\n\nPot stickers - I can't eat dim sum or Chinese food without an order of these.\n\nShrimp dumplings and Siu Mye - these are must haves at Yank Sing.  Steamed and served in bamboo baskets, you'll probably need more than 1 order.\n\nSesame balls - although I usually don't have room for dessert, these sweet little balls definitely topped off the meal.  And no - we wont judge if you dip them into the chili sauce on your plate!\n\nOf course, all while sipping on some tea.\n\nIf you are just visiting San Francisco, or lucky enough to call it home, I highly recommend adding Yank Sing to your must dine at restaurants!\n\nCheck out pics of what we ordered here: http://beatseats.com/yank-sing/", "author": "BeatsEats K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-01", "description": "My husband and I recently had our Chinese wedding banquet at Yank Sing One Rincon location, and I couldn't have picked a perfect place!  \n\nOriginally I had reserved a space at R&G Lounge for this, got a private room and even willing to book the entire evening, accepted their minimum of 2400$.  They were so unprofessional, inflexible, and so unaccommodating.  Person A does not talk to person B, so you end up calling them multiple times...then they refer you to speak with the manager who is always busy, telling you to call back later.  It was total chaos.  It was literally weeks of stress dealing with them.  They have absolutely no costumer service.  Just don't even waste your money there if you want to have a Chinese banquet done right!\n\nIn a panic, I decided to call Yank Sing, spoke to their event department and boy was I glad I did.  The folks at Yank Sing was very very professional, and this is a rare find in Chinese restaurant.  Daisy & Vera the coordinators had made the evening very stress free and memorable.  Don't let the midrange review you see for their dim sum fool you.  I suggest you read the reviews carefully and look at the ones for banquet, all good reviews.\n\nI had been to many Chinese wedding banquets, and the 10 course meal I picked was the best I ever had!  Top notch on presentation and taste, even red napkin for family tables!  The service staffs were very professional, they keep my guests' wine and champagne glasses flowing.  They also helped coordinate toasting and making sure everyone has a glass ready.  Try asking that at other Chinese restaurant, they will probably blow you off.  Let just say my guests were all stuff by the end of the meal, all liquored up in a good way...just how a Chinese wedding banquet should be!  My husband and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out.\n\nAt the Rincon location, they can only have 4 tables of 10 people max.  Is a modern private room and you end up having that space all to yourself.  We were able to do some light decorating with double happiness signs, red lanterns with glow sticks...just that added touch of traditional elements.  The space was great for photos with friends and family. The setting was intimate and cozy. You can easily walk from table to table, chat with your guests, do traditional toasting and still be in the center of the room where everyone can participate!  Parking is validated for your guests as well.\n\nFrom my personal experience, most Chinese restaurant has decent food but lousy costumer service and just want to rush you off, maybe that is fine for dim sum.  However if having a Chinese wedding banquet done right is important to you, impeccable service, great accommodation, give Yank Sing a call.  You won't be disappointed.  I'm glad I did, and it was money well spent!  \n\nOn a side note, as soon as I cancel with R&G lounge, and told them I booked else where, they call me back immediately after 5 minutes and say...oh, we just have this space opened up for you.  Meanwhile the night before I had called them and was told no, and rush me off the phone.  I hope their owners realize their staff's lack of costumer service had just loss the restaurant an easy 4-5K$ dinner.", "author": "Ray H."}

The perfect amount to share!\n\nI've decided that all the shrimp offerings are the best! The shrimp dumplings, the tempura shrimp rolls, the honey walnut prawns - you can't go wrong here! This is also one of the only places that offers a soup dumpling. Those are great fun, served in a big spoon. You put some ginger vinegar in the spoon, then add a dumpling. Bite the top, drink the soup & eat the noodle. WOOT!\n\nIf you're looking for a fabulous weekend thing to bring the whole family together - look no further.

Kind of pricey, though... not sure I'd order them again ($12 for 2)\n- Green beans: great for a dose of vegetables.\n- Soft shell crab: good but pricey!  \n\nOn top of that, my boyfriend munched on the BBQ pork buns (mediocre per his review) and the Shanghai dumplings (on point). \n\nThe service here was great and the seating was plentiful. While I knew it wasn't going to be cheap, I was actually pretty astounded by the bill we managed to rack up!

We were supposed to go to Hong Kong Lounge in Inner Richmond, but by the time we got there they were closing shop. So we decided to stop by Yank Sing instead, which closes at 4 p.m. on Saturday. Street parking was a breeze to find, but a bit frustrating, since the meter only accepted coins. And because it cost nearly $4 and hour, we had to round out quite a few. \n\nBy the time we got there, the place was nearly empty, but they still had carts circling around. We tried most of the classic dim sum dishes and they were all solid, though not exceptional. I found the quality to to be on par with Bao Dim Sum House in Los Angeles or Koi Palace in Daily City. Xiao Long Bao were very juicy and had thin, delicate skins, but I wouldn't say they were the best I've had. I'm personally still more partial to those at Ding Tai Fung and Joe's Shanghai. The lady parading the Xiao Long Bao cart was a bit persistent, telling us we should have more since they were so good. Not knowing how pricey they were, we were like \"Sure, why not\" and she then proceeded to place two more orders for us. \n\nAlthough I didn't end up paying, I could not but help feeling that Yank Sing is overpriced. My roommate, who was paying, wouldn't let me see the bill, but it was clearly upwards of $120 before tip. And this was for three people, who hadn't ordered anything remotely exotic. The food was good and the ambiance superior to your typical dim sum place, but enough to be charging 3 times more than Koi Palace, which has just as good dim sum.", "author": "Pierre B."}

At $2 a piece it's over 3x pricier than the dim sum take-out spots,but I'll admit that the table settings and service are 10x nicer.\n\nIf you have (dim sum novice) guests to impress or a business per diem to kill, I suppose it's worth trying just to cross it off your bucket list, but if you really love dim sum and care more about dumplings than dining service hit up Stockton or Clement Street for something better for your tummy and wallet!", "author": "Krystle S."}

Hands down this is the best deem sum place I have ever been to and I've tried A LOT of different places. I will admit that this place is definitely pricey and it is easy to rack up your bill because the food is so good but it's definitely worth it. I think some of the scores that people gave Yank Sing were probably affected by the pricing but I don't mind spending the extra buck or so on great quality food! \n\nThe xiao long bao here is my favorite out of everywhere I've tried it and trust me, I've tried it at any place I've been to that offers it. I love the cabbage and candied walnut salad as well. Its nice and light and compliments the other items nicely. The sea bass here is amazing!! It is always perfectly cooked and has a nice light but flavorful sauce. The Peking duck here is amazing as well. Honestly, I've probably tried almost everything on the menu and everything is always so delicious. So rather than me listing everything you may as well just look at the menu and see what fits your fancy. I'm sure it won't be anything other than delicious and satisfying!  \n\nI've been here countless times so everything that I say I say with conviction. Come here for business or for pleasure. The atmosphere here is versatile and accommodates many different types of gatherings. The inside of the restaurant has large tables for people who come in a large group but there are smaller more intimate tables and there is also seating in front of the restaurant (but it is still inside the building Yank Sing itself is located in). There is also \"Yang Sing to go\" right next to the restaurant where you can order some of the menu items to go if you don't feel like sitting down and eating at the restaurant. \n\n\"Deem sum\" translated to English literally means \"to touch the heart\" and Yank Sing definitely embraces this idea with their wonderful cuisine!", "author": "Beca P."}

This is sophisticated dining with great choices, attentive service and attractive (though fading) surroundings.  Despite the  large numbers of patrons (250 inside and an additional 250 in the courtyard on weekends), food carts arrived swiftly with a profession of well-prepared, warm food with wonderful and piquant tastes ranging from mild to robust and spicy.  Most servers could explain the more exotic items and captains were nearby to refill tea, gather condiments, and track down special requests.  Asking for warm custard tarts at the end of the meal rather than accepting cool ones from the carts provided an ethereal pleasure.  Who knew that a humble egg custard tart could be so sublime?  \n\nBe advised, lines can be long for seating.  However, we arrived a bit before noon on a Saturday and did not have a long wait.  Do note that this fine dining comes at a price; it is very easy to run up a large bill while enjoying the myriad of passing pleasures.", "author": "M S."}

My favorite dishes were the Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao), sesame balls, and marinated chicken feet. Everything else was pretty bland and I needed the chili sauce and mustard to make the food more flavorful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-28", "description": "The most common comment I hear about Yank Sing is that's it's ridiculously priced for what you get, essentially no value for the dollar. I tend to look at it a bit differently. You need to go in with the mindset of having a special gourmet dim sum experience, not like the typical dim sum spots in Chinatown. There's nothing wrong with Chinatown dim sum (in fact, I highly recommend Great Eastern) but it's obviously a different mindset and almost an entirely different type of cuisine. \n\nIt's like comparing In N Out's double double to NOPA's hamburger. Obviously they are both delicious but one calls for a different occasion than the other. That's the exact case with Yank Sing and its Chinatown competitors. \n\nAbsolutely every dish is mouthwatering here. I love the turnip cakes, the sticky rice, the shrimp dumplings, the soup dumplings, the peking duck, the shrimp in rice noodles and the shumai. The wine selection is also incredible and complements the dim sum very well. \n\nAlso, the ambiance is by far the best I've ever seen for a dim sum restaurant. It's spacious, classy and located right in the heart of Rincon Center. \n\nFYI - you can order from both the carts as well as the menu, although the carts have an immaculate selection so you won't really need to whip out the menu. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

My water was always filled, I received all the orders I asked for, and the employees were all really pleasant.  I guess the only reason NOT to come, would be the price.  It is definitely more expensive than other dim sum restaurants.  Think about spending $5.00 or so per dish.  Their special Shanghai soup dim sum is amazing- but it's $10 or so for 4 pieces.  \n\nBottom line: it's a very good restaurant... if you can afford it.\n\nBTW- on the weekends, park in the garage!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-31", "description": "Yank Sing is a great spot for traditional weekend dim sum for seasoned and rookie dim sum (or \"deem sum\") diners alike.  The emphasis on \"weekend\" is important because weekday dim sum here involves more or less the same high quality, well crafted dim sum dishes but it is served at a frenetic Financial District pace and service sometimes suffers.  To beat the perennial line here, it's best to arrive by 11 am, otherwise you may face an hour-long wait.  \n\nYank Sing provides excellent renditions of the dim sum classics and largely avoids sacrificing authenticity of these dishes for the unfamiliar palate, though it also serves a few spotty dim sum dishes (e.g., the gailan, Chinese broccoli is too chilled for my liking, and is cooked in such that it minimizes the vegetable's natural bitterness).  Of course, there are plenty of highlights.\n\nFor starters, we enjoy pairing a combination of Pu-erh/Chrysanthemum tea with the meal.  Yank Sing's version is authentically smooth and slightly sweet.  \n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings are also generally good, though a little too dry (lacking in the eponymous soup) on a recent weekday visit.  \n\nThe Mandarin dumplings with chives -- fresh chives, cilantro, and shrimp stuffed in translucent rice flour wrappers -- are delicious and not commonly found in the triangle shape that Yank Sing has adopted.  \n\nThe shrimp dumpling (\"ha gau\"), a classic dim sum item, is quite good here.  These bite size dumplings have chopped shrimp embedded with crunchy bamboo shoot in a bite-size.\n\nThe pork siu mye, another classic dim sum dish, is also generally very good.  It features chopped shrimp with pork, shiitake mushrooms filling wrapped formed into a fluted \"basket\" with wonton wrappers.\n\nThe house-roasted Peking duck, served as an appetizer, is also good, but those who love Peking duck will be disappointed by the high cost to portion ratio.  This dish features crispy honey-coated duck skin and tender slices of duck stuffed in a steamed seashell bun, and served with slivered scallions and tangy hoisin sauce.\n\nThe steamed pork buns, another classic dim sum item, is also tasty, though not the best I've ever had.  These fluffy steamed buns are stuffed with honey-glazed BBQ pork.  These are often a hit with little ones.  \n\nTo finish off a dim sum lunch here, we like to get Yank Sing's bite size egg custard tarts, which combine flaky crust with a delicate egg custard interior.  Yank Sing's egg tarts are up there with Golden Gate Bakery's.    \n\nService is generally responsive and friendly, and the venue is spotless.", "author": "Chris T."}

We left our home around 4:00 a.m. and we arrived at Yank Sing about 10:50 a.m.\n\nWe identified ourselves by showing the e-mail and we were immediately seated, table for two.

We don't know the names of the Dim Sum items, but three outstanding items that the manager recommended were BBQ Pork Buns, Shanghai Dumplings, and Egg Custard. On these three items we doubled up. Everything that we ate was tasty and delicious. Of course hot tea was served to us.\n\nOur bill at Yank Sing Restaurant came to $127.00, tax and tip included.

You know a place is good when there is a line to be seated, as was he case with Yank Sing on the day I visited. Our group was not seated in the restaurant; we were seated out in the courtyard. As I understand it this is how it is done on the weekends.\n\nThings move very quickly, but dim sum carts always come around and there are plenty of opportunities too get whatever you desire. For me that would be the chicken feet, which were very tasty.  In addition I found the tofu skin and fried tofu wrapped in seaweed to be excellent. I dream about the fried tofu now!

I called ahead to notify the Resturaunt that my sons have food allergies. Ella called me back and gave me a list of options.  Once we arrived Ella helped us again with which dishes were acceptable with the allergies. She brought me a printed list and double checked everything.  Ella brought out special treats just for my boys to make them feel special. The place was packed with a line forming before they even opened.  It's all delicious especially the Shanghai Dumplings.

They also make some of the best fried sesame balls I've ever had. So yes, the food was good, but for the price, I would not return. The sesame balls were $11, that's just unreal. They're famous for their soup dumplings, which everyone at the table loved, but again, for dimsum this place is simply over priced.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-06", "description": "So for my first trick, I will pull a new yelp review out of my 2 year hiatus. \n\nSeriously, it's been way too long for me to not have informed fellow YELPers about all the food I've fallen in love with and hated. I should feel a little guilty about it but...ehh, what can I say, life happens. So to honor this comeback I'd like to take this time to write about one of my fav. foods: dim sum at Yank Sing in SF.\n\nI came here just before lunch on Sat. I was initially thrown off by the huge banquet space of the Rincon Center but immediately found my way to toward the sights and sounds of the bustling restaurant. It was much bigger than I thought. This place was no hole-in-the-wall, which I'm typically accustomed to. Servers pushing their carts like NYC cab drivers, not caring who's in their way, and the smell of fresh dim sum in the air. This was no dim sum restaurant at all. No, no. This was heaven.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I don't remember half the names of the items. There was hella dim sum that before I knew it, I lost track of what it was I devoured. But thank God to online menus. Here's what I liked: the Shanghai dumpling with its contents of pork and savory broth. The Mandarin dumplings were alright, just needed some soy sauce to moisten it up. The soft shell crab, seasoned with salt and pepper then deep fried, was a nice touch. For my fellow San Franciscans, ever heard of bacon wrapped hot dogs? Well then try the bacon wrapped shrimp. The stuff's so good it would make Bubba cry. Other things worth trying were the Sea Bass and the walnut shrimp. But the one item worth savoring (and ordering to go) was the Steamed pork bun. Seriously, take a moment to truly enjoy this mouth-watering, honey-glazed, warm and fluffy bun, stuffed with sweet bits of pork. It's amazing! \n\nDrooling yet?\n\nI bet you are. This place very much accommodates small-large parties. Great for families. It's clean. Though it is a big restaurant, it's still seems like tight quarters. So get to know your neighbors. You'll be there for a while if you're satisfied with the food.\n\nOther things to note: the service is good but I can see how busy it can get. And what's cool is they also validate parking (You're welcome). And if you're in a rush, you can order-to-go just outside the restaurant. \n\nSo if you're craving dim sum, hit this place up. You won't regret it...I hope. Overall, I was impressed. I'm definitely coming back, faster than you can say Abra-Cadabra.", "author": "Will S."}

I figured at least this place is nice and clean and the service should be a lot better, albeit expensive.  I know it gets packed during the weekend so I arrived before 11AM.  \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nShanghai XLB Xiao Long Bao -  each dumpling had soup inside.\n\nHaa Gow - quite good with nice amount of shrimp.  \n\nPeking duck - Good, skin could be crispier \n\nJook - OK, quite tasty congee.  \n\nBBQ Pork - Kind of sweet.  \n\nMango Pudding - Had some mango inside.  Very nice looking.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here.  The quality of the Dim Sum is good and the service level is bearable.  You could just tell that the woman who pushes the cart is trying to be patient and not blow up when you ask what's inside those steam holders.  This is especially true when you didn't find the ones you like.  I actually see some smiles at this Dim Sum place from the service personnel.  It's expensive, we spent $60 for 2 for Dim Sum which is worth it for me not to deal with sticky table and surly service from some of the other places that serves Dim Sum.", "author": "Jim J."}

There were even a few dishes they had which I've never seen before.

We were not as impressed with the xiao long bao, turnip cake, and the chicken and mushroom dumpling. Overall, everything was very fresh and we left happy. You will pay more for the better ingredients, financial district location, the James Beard and Michelin Star, and the restaurant's illustrious history. However, we all (7 of us) felt it was money well spent ($20-$25 before tax and tip). \n\nBTW, I am sick of people who are willing to pay $30, 50, 80, 100 per person for New American food, but find it insulting that great Chinese food costs more than $15 pp. If you are going to write a review stating that this was only so-so because dim sum should never cost this much and chinatown is cheaper, please take a moment to consider your values and whether your cultural biases influence your judgement.

Especially Xiaolongbao.  We have been to many dim sum places here or in NY and China.  Yank Sing is below average to me, with its cold vegetables with generic soy sauce,  steamed pork ribs that do not taste fresh at all.  Most disappointing is Xiaolongbao.  Yes it still has broth in it which is a sign of successfully made Xiaolongbao.  But its flavor is stale and average.  And it costs 13.6 dollars.\n\nAnd Sui Mai here is again very very average.   You could get something equal or better from any takeout dim sum place in Chinatown.   And every dish was served cold. It is only around 10:30 am when we ate there.  \n\nAnother advice is about their service.  People pay upscale price sometimes to just have upscale services.   None of the waitresses I saw there was friendly, helpful or smiley.   Yes in some Chinese places we have \"rude\" Chinese waiters, but the place is at the same time very cheap and good and maybe doesn't have the money to pay the overworking waiters to fake a nice smile/patience.  But Yank Sing is a so called upscale place.  Yet its waiters look mistreated or depressed somehow, for what we wonder.\n\nWith a more reasonable price, you can get much much better dim sum at Great Eastern Restaurant on Jackson St in Chinatown.

Because now, I am so rich that I have cash oozing out of my leather lined Hermes boxer shorts.  You might say, \"Lies!  I shop at Hermes all of the time- last purchase was a  $1200 hoe for my gardner because I didn't want my neighbors to be talking about me behind my back, and they DON'T have leather lined boxer shorts!\"\nWell, my dear, I have news for you, because I happen to know Hermes.\n\nAs this string of exaggerations continue, so does dim sum.  Dim sum is supposed to be a casual experience.  If people are justifying platinum prices, then be my guest.  It's just that if I were to go and have brunch somewhere and spend 40 bucks per person without a bloody mary in the mix, then there is a problem.  I mean, what makes one eggs benedict that much more superlative than another's?  \n\nIt's perception and deception.  Yank Sing is genius from a business standpoint.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-30", "description": "If someone hates Yank Sing on the premise that it's too expensive or too loud/crowded, it is because:\n\na) They have a food double standard - i.e. willing to shell out $50+ for mediocre French/Italian food on any day but ethnic food somehow does not have the same value.\n\nb) They don't value good ingredients, which cost money. Most other dimsum places don't serve expensive fish, they serve lots of fried stuff or stuff wrapped in rice based products, so is it that hard to figure out why they are cheaper?\n\nc) They place no value on service or quality of dining experience - yes I can get food that is almost as good for half as much, but do I enjoy chasing carts, waiting 20 minutes for tea and water, and having to grovel to get the bill? This is more food double standard going on here, if you were treated like that at a French/Italian restaurant you'd be pissed to pay even $15 for it.\n\nd) They have never been to a real Chinese dimsum place - waiting is normal - if there's no wait, it's usually bad. And Chinese people are loud (being one, I can say that for sure), and if it's loud, it's a good sign that there may be a lot of Chinese people eating at the Chinese restaurant - which is usually good.\n\ne) all of the above\n\n\nThe first time we went, we had 18 different plates between 3 people. And only one of them was fried and only one was wrapped in rice noodle. I've gone several more times and have had 30+ different plates. Most were good but not amazing, but the standouts were the sea bass, sweet potato wrapped seabass with basil, steamed shrimp and pea shoot dumplings, peking duck (try to wait for a fresh cart to come out though, otherwise its just so-so), and soup dumplings (xiaolongbao), which were the best I've had in the US after DinTaiFung in LA. The 7x7 sesame balls are the greatest sesame balls anywhere and their egg tarts are hands down the best egg tarts I've ever had (Golden Gate Bakery has NOTHING on these!).\n\nThe restaurant is clean, spacious, gives you a buzzer when your table is ready, all the carts come around on a regular basis even when we were tucked in a remote corner, the carts were almost always fresh and well stocked, there are dozens of people with wireless headsets you can flag to get you whatever cart you want to come to you, water and tea were always full, the staff were courteous and friendly and the bill is brought at the right time, when you want it. After tax and tip, ~$40-$55/person \n\nSome of the best food I've had have been at hole in the wall dives that violate many health codes and would scare the hell out of most people. But that does not mean every dining experience has to be like that. For the first time in a long time, DimSum was tasty, relaxing and orgnanized, and how often can you say that?", "author": "Snuffles B."}

To put things in perspective, my brother came to San Francisco for a conference, during which time he ate at Yank Sing every day for lunch, for five days.\n\nSo what makes Yank Sing so good? Its difficult to say, because there are so many things. The restaurant itself is refreshingly clean, and ranks a full grade above any other dim sum place I've been in terms of cleanliness. If you're lucky enough to get an atrium seat (on a sunday?), you should take it, because its a beautiful way to enjoy your meal. The spacious atrium is brightly light with natural sunlight, and the water feature in the center makes for a lovely backdrop for your sunday-morning conversations. \n \nMore importantly, the food and service are also excellent. There are enough people and enough turnover of food that the food you get is always hot and fresh. We got some of the honey walnut shrimp, which, though overpriced, was some of the best I've had, and I would gladly go back and pay that much again for the delicate and crispy shrimp. The dumplings, as expected, were delicious and full of flavor, with just the right texture in the dough. The bean-paste filled sesame balls were delicious and fresh, but were extremely overpriced (at least compared to what i'm used to paying for them...), and I would probably not order them again here. Overall, the meal was extremely satisfying and we didn't find a single bad dish. In fact, we both left wishing we had room to try more of the dishes....Next time, I suppose. \n\nThe bottom line is: if you're here and you want dim sum, you won't be disappointed. I haven't had enough of San Francisco's dim sum offerings to really say what's the \"best\", but Yank Sing is a comfortable and clean place to eat, its easy to get to (they validate parking), and the food is excellent, so I recommend it highly", "author": "Zameer A."}

I am a bit of a dim sum addict having lived in Asia for 20 years \nand I expect a lot and got it at Yank Sing.  Absolutely every dish we had was first class with the possible exception of the Peking Duck which doesn't belong at dim sum anyway.  (Probably the price had something to do with that).  The service was excellent, the food came fast and often and when we needed a special dish the girls with their head sets radioed for it immediately.  Believe all the good reviews of the Shanghai dumplings - super, but so was everything else.   Prices are higher than your average place but then so is the quality and well worth it.", "author": "Hank W."}

It's tucked away in a little street almost seeming like an ally way. It's small simple and clean. \nWe came for the dimsum and sat down, the carts passed by and we chose the items that we thought looked best and wanted to compare to other dim sum. We also ordered a fried rice to come along. Honestly their dim sum was a very common dim sum that you can find at many places, and the fried rice was sub par. I love fried rice and have been to many places, and this was the poorest rendition of a yangchou style fried rice. \nThe waitresses were nice and they always came by to see if anything else was needed. For the most part the service was extremely good. \nMy gripes come when comparing the taste and quality of the food with other notable chinese restaurants and for the price they serve it at. For a mere 5 plates of dimsum, and a plate of fried rice, the bill came out to eighty bucks plus tip. Extremely overpriced, and very disappointing.\nI recommend other cheaper restaurants around SF or LA because you can dine on foods of similar quality for better prices.

I debated on where to take him since it would shape his opinion of dim sum forever more.  So I decided on Yank Sing thinking it might be more expensive, but at least we wouldn't have to deal with rude or pushy servers or dirty surroundings and it would be a very pleasant experience for all of us.  I was wrong.\n\nWe arrived at 2:00pm on Sunday and were told by the hostess that there was a 25 minute wait.  Fast forward 45 minutes and we still had not been seated.  Meanwhile, our toddler is hungry and on the verge of a meltdown, as were my husband and I.  Finally, after almost 55 minutes, we are seated.  As we were sitting there, I was explaining to my husband all of the different dishes I like to order and that there were oh so many more for him to choose from, too.  So we waited, and waited.  Finally, a woman walked past with a (that's right, singular) small plate of walnut shrimp in her hand and my husband and I quickly said \"we'll take it\".  I tried to feed my son but he wasn't having any shrimp so I prayed a cart would come by soon with something he'd be able to eat.  Finally, after about 15 minutes, a cart came by.\n\nI requested some sesame balls because I knew it was something my son could eat while we waited for more carts.  So the three of us sat waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.  We had been seated for 30 minutes and only two, TWO, carts had gone by.  And the restaurant was full!  What the hell?????  We soon realized that what they were trying to do is to get people to order off the menu because A. the items are more expensive and B. so they wouldn't make a bunch of dim sum and then have food left over if no one purchased it off the cart.  \n\nI was livid.  I could not believe this so-called \"amazing\" dim sum place was being so cheap and chintzy with food WE WERE WILLING TO PAY FOR.  It's not as if they were giving it away!  I complained to three different servers that we were still waiting for carts to go by and they kept bringing the same cart around, trying to get rid of the left over food.  Then they suggested we order something off the menu.  Excuse me, isn't this dim sum????  Aren't you supposed to go by with carts overflowing with tasty treats for us to choose from?  What the hell is going on?????\n\nThat was it, I asked for the check.  And can you believe, after all that, the three of us left hungry and still ended up with a $46 tab.  For what?????  Sesame balls and dumplings?  You have got to be kidding me.  AND, these cheap bastards charge you for tea!  Have you ever heard of such a thing?  Wow.  Needless to say, we will never eat here again.  \n\nThis place is all hype.  Save your time and money and eat at any other dim sum restaurant but this one.", "author": "Homaira W."}

The staff is trained well as they were very attentive and we didn't have to wait long for the food. The bad: the food is mediocre and the price is slightly outrageous. I wouldn't mind paying $125 per person if the food was good. We ordered 8 dishes and two stood out... The pecking duck and some sort of chicken dish. But the dumplings are a disappointment. If you want Americanized dim sum and good decor then you might enjoy Yank Sing. If you want to eat good dim sum then Hong Kong lounge is definitely better.

I saw Grace K's review and she gave it 5 stars so I knew I had to experience it.\nYank Sink is known for there dim sum and it's lavish, spacious, eating area and it is quite impressive. When you see the interior in the Rincon center you will find many waitors and waitresses being polite and offering trays of delicious dim sum.\n\nOrdered the follow:\nPotstickers: wrapped Pork dumplings-flavorful. Not greasy.\n\nPork soup dumplings: dumpling with a pork filling and filled with soup. You can add red wine vinegar sauce for additional flavor.\n\nSui mai: pork with a dumpling wrapper, full of flavor, not grissley and not greasy. I have had greasy sui mai before and my stomach did not appreciate it.\n\nHoney walnut prawns: prawns in a white sauce very yummy with candied walnuts.\n\nGai-lon: green vegetables sauteed. Nothing special\n\nPeking Duck. This was one piece of moist duck with the plum sauce and the soft flour bun. Flavorful, just one piece per person though.\n\nAfter all of this I still had room for dessert. I ordered the mango sorbet that was light, colorful and very yummy. I was suprised with the bill, it was approximately $88.00 for four people. Not bad, I thought it was going to be over $100.00. I will definitely be back to try other specialties.

The bbq pork buns were ok... don't think I would rank it anywhere near the best pork I have ever had that's for sure. I think us Filipinos are picky about your pork.

Yank Sing definitely appeals to an older generation of businessmen.  I'm sure they made good food back in the day, but have since, been commercialized.  The one thing that is likely still the same?  Their chili sauce.  Its amazing.  But other than that, their dim sum really falls short of today's expectations in the Chinese community.  You're also overpaying for what you'll get at a lower end dim sum joint. \n\nEven funnier is that I understood what exactly the waiters were saying in Cantonese and lets say its a bit more than derogatory to their own customers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-25", "description": "Recently went to SF. Decided to give Yank Sing a try after much rav reviews. My impression, mediocre. There is a disconnect between the price they charged and the corresponding quality. For their signature dish, kurobuta pork dumpling, aka shao long bao priced at $12.95 for 6, it was ridiculous. It's even more expensive than the world renowned Din Tai Fung. This dish is known for the thin yet resilient dough to hold the broth within the dumpling. Yang Sing version was the Chinese version of piggy in a blanket, except the blanket is for the harsh Siberia winter! The poor piggy is most probably suffocating in the blankie. If I wanted to eat dough, I will just go buy some SF Sourdough bread and be happier eating that. A hallmark for this Shanghai delicacy is that the dumpling form a pear shape when pick up with the chopsticks, when is the laying flat in the steam basket, the centre of the dumpling is surrounded by a brothy perimeter within the dough, and as you pick it up, the broth moved to the bottom, if it breaks, it's bad craftsmanship, My late father would have tossed it away and send it back. Also you can count the folds, which should be about 18. I will have no problem if this is just one of Yank sing regular item for $8 pr $9, for this to be a signature item, it failed miserably! It is what it is, a terrible rendition of the traditional shao long bao. Dough too thick, not enough broth, # failed! For the other less famous items, Yank  Sing was actually half decent, the Har Gow, the Peking duck( a steam bao instead of the crepe but quite tasty I must say) and the shrimp rice noodle roll was all legit! The rice noodle roll reminded me the way HK dim sum chef pulled their's noodle  from the steam cloth, it was really good! But the misguided self proclaimed signature steam pork dumpling has left much to be desired. It was supermarket frozen food quality but for $12.95! At the very least put some crab roe and meat in it, that way Yank sing could at least commend that kind of price point. I know I am repeating myself, but that dough was thick enough to keep me warm on the golden gate ferry cruise. \n\nSF deserves better than that, to call Yank Sing a must go dim Sum place indicates how deprive people in SF are from good traditional dim sum, if you don't speak up, then mediocrity is all you are going to get! I understand they have been in business for 60 yr with three generations of the Chan family at the helm, but regardless of how many generations or how many decades you are in business, doing something bad for that long is not going to make it better. It just 60 yrs worth of crabbiness in this signature dish. My last name is also Chen, my family are from Shaghai and I am born and raised in Hong Kong, and now lived in Toronto. We have over at the minimum 100 years between 3 generations tasting shao long  bao, we are no experts just ordinary folks that take their old country food seriously. Yank Sing, please don't insult my palette and intelligence by calling these pretenders shao long bao! If your chefs don't have the chops to do this properly, take it off the menu and no one will blame you.", "author": "R's C."}

Dim sum lines can be a bit long on the weekends if you don't show up pretty early.  I say you have to be there by 11am otherwise there will be a crowd by noon.  On the weekends, they have more feature food items.  Shanghai dumplings are so tasty with that soup inside.  I like the typical dim sum dumplings as well.  Weekdays, the choices are limited.  Oh no one can say no to their egg tarts, it is like $2.50 each, but think of the cost of getting authentic French macaroons from Laduree or Pierre Herme.  BTW New York City has a Laduree so you don't need to go all the way to Paris for French Macaroons now.\n\nI go there often on weekday and weekends.\nThey have another location at 49 Stevenson as well.\n\nOur wedding banquet was here.  Our guest list was so big that our party there many years ago was outside of the restaurant premises and on Rincon Center grounds.  They served excellent 8 dish wedding banquet menus if you like shark fin soup and almond flavor bird's nest for dessert.  The dragon and phoenix cold platter was awesome in presentation and the selected cold cuts were the best of the best there is unless you are having this party in Hong Kong.  They did a good job, the lobster came whole in a pair for each banquet table, that's the point, it is about the newly weds.  Some restaurants will fail to do that over price and cost.\n\nWe had a chocolate fountain and traditional candies/sweets to accommodate Chinese and American taste.  The restaurant was really cool in giving us a dance floor after the banquet dinner.  We brought in our own MC and DJ.  We had a video of us from childhood to marriage explaining how our lives entwined with modern love songs playing in the background.\n\nVery tiring with so much entertaining to do and all dress up, had to change outfits three times. The bridal room was a short walk and easy to get to, it was really a converted private dining room of the restaurant.  The wedding party entered the premises in our western wedding outfits upon introduction.  We changed into the traditional Chinese wedding attires with the restaurant being able to provide a stage set up for us to have our tea ceremony for both sides of the family with all of our guests as witness to our wedding.

If I had to put a word on the cuisine, I'd call it 'gourmet dim sum', particularly given the price. The bill has run about $60 for 2 people on both occasions that I've gone, and I can't really say that the quality of the food is appreciably better than the dim sum I could get in New York's or Philly's Chinatown and would cost half as much. It's certainly more upscale, is clean, and has carts with everything on the menu on the floor, but I have to dock it a star simply because I don't think the quality justifies the price.\n\nThe service is very organized, and I'm a fan of the large pot of tea they bring out for the table.

You can enjoy your meal peacefully with family and friends (in my case, friends I had studied abroad with and hadn't seen in over 6 months) as long as the bill doesn't bother you!

We went into the garage which was valet only for visitors, and then when I went to validate my ticket IN THE RESTAURANT, the lady loudly and rudely said, \"Four dollars.\"  WHAT?  Why is a parking validation in the business I just spent a ton of money to eat in demanding MORE money?  In the end, not worth the money.

We have the special Peking Duck along with the typical Siu Mai and Shanghai Dumplings and the other regulars. A good Shanghai dumpling is served hot on the inside and this one is barely warm. That goes for all the food - including the Peking Duck. You don't pay $6.50 for a piece of cold Peking Duck that is being shuttled around in that Dim Sum cart. Brought this up to the Manager of the restaurant and all he said was he will talk to his chefs.

Kudos to all my yelp friends who are always ever vigilant about writing awesome reviews of places so others such as myself may peruse and make educated choices on how to spend our time and expenses.  thank you. \n\nAs for Yank Sing, well this used to be a fav of mine every time I visited SF.  Like things of the past, sometime we need to keep it in the past to preserve the good memories we experienced.  \n\nOn my last trip here, I found myself, quite sadden by the services and qualities I received.  Perhaps I spoke too esteem too highly, that i stories became even grandiose in my eyes.  Perhaps the shanghai dumplings pictured in my mind grew to iron chef proportion.\n\nNever the less, when i visited this mecca of high end dim sum, my expectations outgrew the reality.  To me, the yank sing of the past was a five stars establishment.  Perfect like in their promotional video plastered on their web page.  But here is where yank sing lost me this time.\n\n-1 star for price.  A simple weekend dim sum dinning for two cost $65.  I must say, the shanghai dumplings are good, but not at $10/plate.  We were never full, just a couple of dishes and bam, the bill was ridiculous.  They have restaurant weeks here in SD, I must say, I get better food at swankier joint for $30/person.  I know SF is expensive and the spear building rent must be high, but gauging patrons dinner prices for breakfast, that's was below the belt.\n\n-1 one more star for service.  we tracked down 4 people to get us our tea and ice water.  I was surprised by the hap hazard staff.  I was so steamed that I was about to stand up and walk out, if it not, for my company, who held me in check.  We were given a table on the side just because there was only two of us. we wanted a bigger table, and there were plenty, but they said it was reserved for larger party.  I understand, but one knows how dim sum goes, big table with big spread of food.  If you are going to decline the bigger table for me, at least have the staff clear off empty containers more often.  We ran out of real estate on our table, hence we did not order much, which comes to think of it, was a good thing, otherwise we would have had a larger bill.  And to top it off, two parties that followed us had better services, with their tea brewing and their water glasses filled.\n\n-1 one more more stars for dim sum taste.  I swear I must accept that yank sing prepare their food, cause they said so.  After sampling again the basics here of har gow, shumai, char sui bao, etc., I have to say, I have had better at buffets at indian casinos.  If someone told me that yank sing ordered them from china and just reheat them, charge premium price, and pass it off as their own, as a juror in a jury box, I would be inclined to believe such a concocted story.  it was simply plain, I could have found better for cheaper in chinatown.  \n\nOverall, I frown upon yank sing.  She lost her ways with me.  After my visit to hong kong, I placed her on a pedestal, shouting to the crowd, she is the only worthy dim sum place this side of the pacific.  Clearly my fallacy has been exposed to the world.  Hard press for me to return.  I think yank sing rest on her laurels too long.  Her staff both front and back needs refreshing.", "author": "Kevin B."}

The rooms \"are filled with loud conversation and laugher\" simply means you won't be able to have a dialogue at the table.

Go cheap and stock up on H2O.\n\nI like YS because the dim sum isn't greasy so you can taste the ingredients. Shrimp har gow is large, generous, meaty and fresh. The peking duck comes with fresh buns and is not fatty so you can taste the meat. Shanghai XLB is soupy (good for dim sum), but not the best I've had (best still is in Taiwan). \n\nMy favorite dim sum dish is shrimp cheong fun and YS is able to deliver it in a way where I secretly consume half the dish without my friends realizing the dish is there. Yes, that's how good it is!\n\nIn addition to the good service where they call in the dishes you want, we are hilariously obsessed with an over the top customer who is always decked out in fur and bling in the most gaudy manner.

Yes, it's expensive and not quite as authentic as if you go to say Ton Kiang or Gold Mountain.

These put the version at the Michelin-rate Din Tai Fung to shame; yes them be fighting words.\n\n2) Peking Duck - hand assembled right at your table; crisp skin, perfectly steam bun, good stuff...\n\n3) Shumai - seriously bursting at the seams with shrimp; the prettiest shumai I've ever seen...hey you eat with your eyes first no?\n\n4) Shrimp Wrapped in Rice Sheets - ugh...worst dish...wtf is with the addition of cilantro?\n\n5) BBQ Pork Baked Bun -  these are definitely well hyped and well deserved. The pork itself is delicious and the crust is flaky if not completely unique in texture. The honey wash brushed over the top was a bit much for me though as I'm more of a traditionalist.\n\n6) Sesame Balls - man these are tiny comparatively to what you can get in the Richmond, none-the-less, these are pretty darn good.

They charge because they serve truly premium teas - not Costco bulk.  I am partial to the chrysanthemum tea here - it is spectacular and truly complements the food.  \n\nLet's get those pesky negatives out of the way;\n\nThey're expensive. Yup.

With all that said, the dim sum here was excellent. If there's something you want that's not on a cart, they are really quick about getting that dish (either from another cart or straight from the kitchen). The tea was especially good. I think there's some kind of prejudice about Chinese food -- that it should be cheap, that it's not sophisticated. People will pay a lot of money for Japanese or French food but there's just this assumption that Chinese food (and Mexican food) should always be just a notch above fast food. THere are certainly cheap dim sum alternatives but, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Part of the extra cost here is that the overall quality is just better.", "author": "Tommy K."}

We had the first reservation of the day at 11am, but they actually opened a little early and seated us at 10:45.  We weren't seated but a few seconds when the waitress came up to us with their special of the day, which happened to be Chilean sea bass in a slightly sweet sauce.  The fish was SO tender that I could have eaten a whole plate of it! But of course I wanted to try other things.  I'd never tried the pork balls with the soup inside, but the waitress was kind enough to show me how to put it on the spoon and eat it with a little sauce and ginger.  That was pretty good.  Other items I tried were the Chinese broccoli (nice and fresh, though could have used a bit more lemon and pepper seasoning), Phoenix tail prawns (nice size and meaty!), foil-wrapped chicken (tasty but hard to get the wrapping off and still had some bones in it), regular pot stickers (about the same as every other Chinese food place I've tried, hard to mess them up), and shrimp/mushroom rolls (excellent with a bit of soy sauce!), and finally, a palate-cleansing dish of strawberry and melon balls.\n\nThe sea bass was the best, but as the special was not listed on the menu.  Depending on the day you go, they may have different items such as soft-shell crab.  Make sure you ask the price beforehand though, because their specials tend to be the most expensive items.\n\nOverall the meal was really good save for the minor flaws mentioned above, and service could not have been better.  One thing I wish they would offer is some kind of sherbet which would have made a better palate cleanser for the spicier things than the fruit did.  I understand the difficulty of showcasing such a dessert, but I honestly think there would be enough demand for it that they would lose very little to melting, and they can always bring some out to order.\n\nBe careful what you get here, though, because those prices add up!!  The total for just me and my girlfriend was $160, and that without tip!  Not a place you can go to every day.", "author": "Paul W."}

Therefore, I really don't have anything to compare this place to. \n\nI thought this place was fantastic though! I came here with two other people who eat here about once every month or two and I let them do most of the ordering (I'll eat just about anything). One of our dining companions only eats gluten-free foods, so there were a few items that she ordered that I didn't get a chance to taste. \n\nThe two of us non-gluten free people started with an order of pork pot-stickers and chicken egg rolls. They weren't bad, but they were probably my two least favorite things that we had. These were the only two non-steamed items that we had, and I'm thinking it's because of this they didn't taste as fresh as some of the other items we ordered (they were a little greasy). \n\nThe first two steamed items that we tried were the shrimp dumplings, which were awesome (they were basically all shrimp) and the Sui Mai? (I think that's what those pork dumplings are called?), and they were delicious! We also had two orders of the the steamed pork buns, which were highly recommended by one of our dining companions, and they did not disappoint. We also has the Shanghai dumplings (those soup dumpling things), which were great (these seem to be a popular item here). \n\nOur gluten free companion had some sort of leaf-wrapped rice patty thing that actually looked really good as well as the mushroom/chicken dumplings (I guess whatever they use as the \"dumpling\" with this item is gluten free). \n\nFor dessert we had mango pudding as well these sesame apricot ball things, which were both delicious! I'm not sure what kind of tea we had (it wasn't the jasmine), but it was good as well. \n\nSince I was a dim sum virgin, it's kind of hard for me rate the service since dim sum service works a little differently than a restaurant where you would order off a menu. However, the carts came around often and all the servers seemed to know the dishes pretty well. At times they can be a little pushy (they'll start to put plates down on your table before you say whether or not you want it) and it did take us a few tries to get the mushroom/chicken dumplings (this was the only item we specifically requested). \n\nI see where a lot of people say this place is expensive, and it definitely is a little pricey, but I thought it was worth the price for everything we ate. With tax and tip each of us in our group paid about $30 and we ate a LOT of food!!! \n\nI would definitely come back here for dim sum, especially with a large group for brunch or birthday.", "author": "George A."}

The XiaoLongBao are not that great - just go to Shanghai Dumpling in Saratoga or Hu Chiang in Cupertino if you want really good XiaoLongBao for less.\n\nIsn't a Yelp rating supposed to represent the overall restaurant experience?  Based on the price alone, I just cannot recommend Yank Sing.  They have duck for $5.  You may think $5 seems reasonable and it is if you're getting a small plate of sliced duck (like you'd get at other dim sum places) but it's $5 per person per slice.

Absurd because I'm just used to the host or hostess yelling out a number amongst layers of overlapping conversation in a crowd of people.   \n\nI had the day off, and my parents were available.  Bringing them here was only appropriate.  We sampled the typical dim sum fair such as the har gao (shrimp dumplings), shiu mai (pork dumplings), and BBQ pork buns.

Watching carts roll around is my preference and this place has carts. \n\nAs their xiao long bao (XBL) was surprisingly good, the general variety served followed that surprising feeling.  The ratio of quality to price still doesn't equate its prices unfortunately.  What I'm saying is it's simply not worth the money you're paying.  The audience they are obviously aiming for is a \"non Chinese\" (I don't even know why I put this in quotes) crowd, and thus assuming the better service.  Bottom line, personally coined by me the \"banana\" (white on the inside and yellow on the outside) of dim sum restaurants, offers unchallenged superior level of service for dim sum and the food isn't half bad.  It's just overpriced and doesn't have anything unique enough to back those prices.", "author": "Arnold T."}

Was taken to a place in Chinatown I no longer remember the name of--huge place though.  The next time I had dim sum, it was at Yank Sing.  The trick is: take a bunch of people with you so you can taste a lot of dishes.  4 people cannot go through enough food.  I seemed to remember Yank Sing also doing this crab claw dish that was outstanding but the last time I was there (with 20 of my nearest and dearest), they didn't have those claws and I so wanted my dad to have some--he is now dead without having tasted them, so sad.  It's noisy.  We had reservations so I don't know how lucky you can get without them.  We ate a LOT.  I'm not a huge dim sum fan, have to be careful with all the wheat things (all those wrappers, my gut doesn't like wheat) and all that fried stuff.  Still, it is an experience.  I'd like more vegetables though.  But this is not a place for regular dining (cause you have to rustle up 20 of your best friends which isn't that easy to do, everyone is so busy).  Many years ago there was a really good dim sum place in Embarcadero One (maybe some of the same space Crystal Jade now occupied)--they did have crab claws daily, and a take out area too, but they closed.", "author": "Kai T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-21", "description": "Super overrated, and it doesn't help that this place is on *both* the Michelin Guide and the 7x7 100 things to eat in Sf list. I'm even tempted to give it a 2 star (it's really a 2.5).\n\nI met up with a fellow Hong Kong girl who is just visiting this area. She was craving home food, as was I, as usual. I chose this place because of its fame and convenient location from BART. The location is amazing -- there's \"outside\" seating in the food court atrium with a gigantic sunroof and a nice water fountain in the middle. The restaurant is clean with nice tableware which is a rare sight in Chinese dim sum restaurants.\n\nHowever, the food didn't really satisfy our wants (or, ahem, needs) for good dim sum. Our first impression of the har gow (shrimp dumpling) is \"ew, it's a bit hard\". Indeed, the little dumpling was so stuffed with shrimp they might as well just sell the shrimp filling. The delicate balance of the filling and the skin was destroyed, and that immediately got me disappointed. The siu mai didn't even come close to tasting good, the chicken feet were not marinated enough (you can see the non-colour-stained meat in the inside! Although the sauce is pretty good), and the bbq pork buns just had the wrong dough texture. Other things that were just meh: Rice wrapped in lotus leaves, fried pork dumpling, spring rolls (they serve it with plum sauce, which is wrong! We eat it with worcestershire sauce in Hong Kong).\n\nThey redeemed themselves a bit with the XLBs (soup dumplings), since they were quite soupy and the skin was nice and thin. The fillings are still just average but overall it's much better than the usual XLBs you get in the area.\n\nHowever, when I tried their oh-so-famous sesame balls, my reaction was \"ugh, this is tough\".  There was too much filling and they were just not fluffy enough. This is their supposedly famous dish? I can find a lot of places in the area with much better sesame balls! Double disappointment at this point.\n\nAll-in-all, I did find a dish that I really liked -- the jello \"orange slices\". The taste was amazingly orangy, the texture a bit more like custard, and I was so ready to have more of it just to offset the other not-so-good dim sum I had.\n\nAh, the service. At the price of this place, I was expecting to have more than just 3 carts come by my table. We sat on the edge of the outside dining area. While they attempted to fill our table within the first 5 minutes of us sitting down (slow down, geez!), at the end of the meal it seemed like the carts just gave up coming over even when we were ready to order 1 or 2 items more. Also, it was incredibly difficult to get the attention of our server -- they somehow do it U.S. style here, so another server cannot process our bill or anything, and have to help us get our server. Why bother with that at a busy Chinese place?\n\nSumming up, the dim sum here is only average. Not too bad, but I'm not willing to pay so much for just mediocre dim sum, when other mediocre dim sum cost much less. This place is way too overrated and you'll do yourself a favour for not trusting Americans on their idea of what \"good\" dim sum is.", "author": "Alice C."}

The weather was oh so nice. The destination was even more so. Yank Sing. My very first Dim Sum, and oooh there is NO better. Let's get right down to it, as here is sincerely is ALL about the food, glorious food. \n\nBroccoli. Plain, fresh and perfectly palette cleansing between more savory dishes. This is a great choice for a plain little bite. \n\nFried String Beans. A little heat, a smattering of salty minuscule dried shrimp and tada! Tasty side dish at which to whittle. \n\nPot-stickers. Golden brown outside, yummy meaty inside. A standard. \n\nBaked Pork Buns & Steamed Pork Buns. Pork Buns as we all know them, are the steamed with the lovely chewy outer, the succulent, pork and sweet/sour inner. These, of course are the best you will ever have of a pork bun. Not at ALL skimpy on the filling and, like everything here, a clean, good flavor. Baked Buns are something I have never seen anywhere else, and having seen them on The Food Network's Best Pork Thing I Ever Ate, I had to try this Brother to the Steamed Bun. A little honey outside, and the same great inside. The baking dries the dough a little more and you miss that chewy perfect texture, so I am going to say - if you only get ONE bun, make it the steamed. \n\nRoast Duck with Pancake. This is SUCH an unassuming dish, but truly wonderful. The same pork bun dough in a tiny little pancake form that you stuff with your slice of duck, top with shaved onion and gorgeous hoisin. This was simple as could be, but excellent all around. \n\nHoney Walnut Prawns. Delectable, sweet and fresh fresh prawns in the slightest lobster sauce with toasty, crunchy, beautiful walnuts. So, so very good. \n\nRed Cabbage Salad. This is the first thing they will ask you if you would like. It doesn't at all look like much, but this was one unassuming dish I could NOT get enough of. So crunchy, a bit citrusy, a bit sweet and a LOT great with cilantro and fennel and more of those lovely walnuts. Yum. \n\nNow, don't think we forgot about those famous Soup Dumplings. Us newcomers were instant fans and Brat I, Miss Knower of All Things Wonderful, sat and nodded knowingly. These are not to be missed, and 2 orders right away are not frowned upon. \n\nBUT, the BEST thing - of all these honestly perfect dishes is the Sesame Balls. Coated in toasted sesames, delightfully crunchy outside and so so wickedly chewy inside and then a little dollop of sweet paste, these are definitely one of the best things I have ever had the joy of eating. Forget the damn Lucky Charms- THESE are Magically Delicious.\n\nYes, Yank Sing is pricey. But paying for great food that you know is clean, fresh, nothing funny going on with the ingredients and leaves you feeling uplifted and not greasy gross - done. \n\nYes, I dare say, Yank Sing will inspire you to...Sing!!", "author": "Katie W."}

But I'm going to take a chance on Yank Sing.  \n\nDim Sum used to be one of my least favorite dining experiences.  I found the experience at all restaurants to be similar.  Long and haphazard waits (people being seated randomly it seems), non-existent service, loud, crowded, and sometimes not a very \"clean\" facility.  Now, some people like this type of thing, I personally hated it, so avoided Dim Sum like the plague.\n\nThen my wife and I decided to try this place.  My wife is an established Dim Sum \"veteran\", so she immediately noticed the prices.  She says it's basically double what you'd pay for a comparable item at a regular Dim Sum place.  But then she also says food-wise it's the best quality Dim Sum she's had as well.  \n\nI personally think the food is excellent, and most importantly, consistent.  We've been going about once a month over the last year, and each time the food quality has been high.  Yes the XLB lives up to the hype.  And a bunch of other stuff my wife orders us that I still don't quite know how to spell.  \n\nBut more importantly, I really like the overall experience, in stark contrast to all other Dim Sum restaurants I have tried.  Yes there is a wait, but it's quite orderly and efficient.  Longest we've had to wait without a reservation is 30 minutes.  The restaurant does get packed, but at the same time not as claustrophobic as other places.  And the servers are actually fairly polite and friendly, and they'll bring specific items out for you if you don't see it on a cart and they have it available.  Very prompt in cleaning off plates and getting your check as well.  Clean facilities.\n\nOverall, I am giving this place 5 stars because Yank Sing has made Dim Sum one of my least favorite dining options to one of my most favorite.  I always look forward to making it out to YS when I am in the City.", "author": "Leo C."}

Or have you been lately?  This is the best Dimsum we have had in the US. Yes I have had Dimsum in Kong Kong. My issue with those comparing it to Kong Kong is that there is not just one style of restaurant or even just one style of Dimsum in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has every type of restaurant ad every type of Dimsum the states has and more. Having said all of that Yank Sing was far better on every level in every way than any Dimsum I have had in NYC. I actually do not review them (NYC Dimsum restaurants)  they are so bad. Their menus are limited and they are all pretty filthy and with a life threatening shell fish allergy I have found that NYC Dimsum puts me in danger every time! I ask if there is shell fish and they always say no in NYC. My husband even asks in Chinese so it is not a language barrier. And no I am not allergic to all sea food. I got nasty message from some weirdo here at Yelp saying if you are allergic to seafood blah blah blah... I am not allergic to sea food and eat Seafood more than any other cuisine. I am just allergic to shrimp. And I wasn't always. It is a relatively new allergy. But I digress...\nYank Sing was clean, the service was good, and the food was good. But what I liked about it the most is the menu was very extensive. I have been to all of the top Dimsum in NYC and we have NOTHING like Yank Sing in the 5 boroughs. The closest I have had to Yank Sing was in Hong Kong which is why I am mentioning Hong Kong. I do not think most of those who are mentioning Hong Kong have actually been there. Hong Kong has some cutting edge restaurants. Some are dirty like here in NYC and some are very stylish and clean which we do not have here in NY not for Dimsum. Some are like Yank Sing in Hong Kong   and some are very Americanized for tourists and some are old school. There isn't one style of Dimsum in Hong Kong. So having said all of that it is the closest to what I have had in Hong Kong. We had Dimsum at several restaurants in Hong Kong.\nYank Sing got the James Beard award and is also in the Michelin guide. It was also voted one of the top Chinese restaurants in the US. http://top100.chinesemenu.com/event/2010/en/winner.asp\nMy Chinese husband liked it a lot! He is hard to please as far as Chinese food goes because he cooks it better than any restaurant we have been to in the US. He said the thing he liked about it the most was that it seemed more like an authentic Dimsum \"experience\" than any Dimsum restaurant in NYC,  he explained that in NYC they rush you and most restaurants here are rude and dirty. He said the presentation at Yank Sing  is more professional and more like what we had in Hong Kong.\nAt Yank Sing the experience itself seemed to be more like what we have experienced in Hong Kong. If and when we go to San Fransisco again we would love to go back and try it again. Some say it has changed. It is worth a visit to find out.\nThe thing about having Dimsum in San Fransisco that is different than NYC is it seems everyone has Dimsum. It seems to be a part of the culture there. \nAlso all of the servers spoke Cantonese unlike  Ton Kiang where they did not speak Cantonese. http://www.yelp.com/biz/ton-kiang-san-francisco#hrid:-ZcurFux6rQdaxisRB_Pug/src:self\nMy favorite part of the meal was the Peking Duck. \nThe only real down side was the price.

In my recent visits with my eyes no longer drowning in earthy greens and gelatinous pork broth, I have found a new champion among the gaggle of choices:\n\nHar gao. The best of its kind that I have ever eaten; subtly pink shrimp meat packs the translucent, angelic skin. The bite is silky yet still has that velvety, toothsome snap that all crustaceans should aspire to. The flavor is sweet, buttery shrimp punctuated by a kiss of sesame. The little pouches are sublimely synaesthetic wonders; the subtlety belies their intense complexity.\n\nYank Sing certainly will never be one of my regular hangouts, but every once in a while (usually twice within a week-long period because after the first time you compulsively run back for more) it's worth the splurge.

Their individual servings of Peking Duck (\"A Yank Sing Signature dish, house-roasted Peking Duck served as a deem sum appetizer, Crispy paper thin honey-coated skin and tender slices of succulent meat stuffed in a steamed seashell bun, accompanied with finely slivered scallions and smears of tangy hoisin sauce.\") and Lettuce Cups are a nice way to sample what is normally reserved for banquets or large dinner parties.  \n\nTheir Egg Custard Tarts (\"Warm oven-baked velvety smooth and sweet egg custard in flaky pastry tart shell.\") have been a hit or miss over the years.  They used to be miniature ones and tasted so good.  And then they became the regular size ones, and it wasn't so nice anymore. But on my last visit, the little ones were back and they were good! \n\nOverall, their dim sum is pretty fresh and they have a pretty huge variety.  Everything looks visually appealing, so you can't help but want to try it all. And plus, most of the staff speaks English, so they are more than helpful when explaining what all the little plates are.  And service here is considered fabulous compared to other dim sum restaurants around.  You never have to ask for your teapot to be refilled because they can see for themselves when it needs to be and it gets whisked away before it's half way empty.  \n\nThey offer indoor seating and outdoor seating in the atrium, which leads to a minimal wait on a weekend.  And with free parking available in the garage downstairs, it beats circling the block a few hundred times in Chinatown looking for a space.  When I want to spoil myself, I'll come here.

(This may or may not have biased this review, but in all fairness, I did not know he was the owner until after having tasted the food). \n\nHands down, some of the BEST xiao long bao I've ever had in my entire life! The wrapping is delicate yet doesn't rip, well stocked with hot savory soup, and the filling is very loose and tender. It literally melts in your mouth. \n\nHar gow, sew mai, fun gwoh are all perfectly flavored and  thinly and delicately wrapped, then steamed to perfection. \n\nI see that a lot of people are complaining about the prices being high. Well here's a take on food pricing. You can order a steak from Denny's that is $8.99 and you can order a better steak at Outback for $25, and an even better steak at Ruth Chris' for $40+. The difference in quality of the steaks warrants the price hike.\n\nWell same goes for dim sum. You can eat that dollar-cheap stuff from a run down \"hole in the wall\" in Chinatown, but I assure you that you won't be getting the same high level of satisfaction as if you were to enjoy the clean and spacious dining room, the on-point and polite service, and good dim sum at Yank Sing.\n\nThe same goes for French, Japanese, or even pizza, or any kind of food for that matter. So why can't Chinese food also be pricey if the ingredients are excellent, the service is accomodating, and the quality of the food is up to snuff? It is time we recognize that Chinese cuisine can also be high class.\n\nMany details and a lot of thoughtfulness have been put into this fine establishment. From the community chopsticks for serving to the dark colored napkins to prevent lint getting stuck on your dark slacks, they have really thought of it all. The tea is so fragrant and even the chairs are so comfortable and made of the softest calf leather. They even bottle their own signature hot sauce.\n\nThis restaurant will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this year, and its longevity and success is well deserved.", "author": "Charmaine L."}

So many accolades, a James Beard Award Winner, Michelin Guide Acclaimed, the list goes on and on....\n\nBut the food and the service didn't quite match up.\n\nWhen we got there, the hostess stand was a mess. We went into the restaurant and politely gave our name for the reservation we had called in beforehand. Fifteen minutes go by and we realize that we were the only ones that were still waiting inside the restaurant. Apparently they had moved the entire hostess stand outside into the cortyard of the Rincon Center and failed to mention this to us. They had even forgotten about us! When we went back to tell them, we had to wait another 15 minutes before finally getting seated.\n\nThe food wasn't much better than the service. Overpriced and cold xiao long baos, sticky rice, egg custard tarts and Chinese broccoli made its way over. It was probably the worst dim sum I've ever had, and even the most expensive dim sum I've ever had. Pick anywhere else in SF and you should have a better experience.

Yes, the dim sum is expensive, but really, you get what you pay for.  The atrium is beautiful and the food is well-seasoned and well-presented.  \n\nI confess, I have a special place for YS in my heart because I got married there.  If you are even considering a beautiful but elegant banquet, do not rule out YS.  Our wedding was even featured in a magazine.  See here:  http://66.34.224.169/index.php?page=pay\n\nAnyway, back to the food.  Yes, it is expensive, but it's worth it.    Each dumpling is carefully made to perfection, and it's also clean.  And - gasp! - the service is quite decent.  People complain that it's not as cheap as other Chinese holes in the wall.  HELLO - YS is not a hole in the wall.  Also, to those posters down there who recommend Ton Kiang, I'd ask that you not go there (they have had many labor issues and have been sued numerous times by the Asian Law Caucus).  \n\nOne small caveat is that parking may be an issue.  I'd recommend parking on the street.  The YS parking lot is available, but the spots are tiny (we got in a small accident in that lot once and have never parked there since)!  \n\nFinally, beyond the dim sum, if you are planning to go to dinner there, I'd also recommend one of their banquet menus.  Yes you will be paying $400+, but the food is exquisite.  And, my parents who will only eat authentic Chinese food, have noted that this food really is very *different.*  They love it!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-09", "description": "So I'm a dimsum snob. Actually I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to Chinese food in general...after all, coming from Flushing, NY, I feel like I've definitely been spoiled. There is a certain level of quality that I expect and anything that doesn't match that standard is \"meh\" or just \"ok.\" So with that said, Yank Sing would have probably earned 3 stars because that's how I felt about the food - good but not great; executed well but doesn't really have an impact. However, $10.90 for 6 pieces of xiao long bao??? (Shanghai steamed dumplings) $8.70 for an order of cong you bing??? (scallion pancakes) My mom and I ordered 10 items and the bill was over $100!!! For dim sum...that was pretty crazy...and we didn't even order a lot of the \"high end\" food except for Peking duck. Honestly...unless the food is extremely amazing, there should be no way that dim sum should end up to be this expensive. And even then, most dim sum items are fried or street-food/ish...so this is the reasoning for the 2 star rating.\n\nMy goal is to find a place with good Shanghai steamed dumplings. I've given up on finding amazing xiaolongbao...I've long come to the (jaded) conclusion that only Joe's Shanghai could make amazing xiaolongbao. While these dumplings were soupy and tasty, the soup doesn't lack the thickness or viscosity that makes really great xiaolongbao great. These were merely good...but honestly...for the price...I was very disappointed. Especially when I knew Joe's Shanghai's xiaolongbao would be twice as good and half the price with 8 pieces instead of 6. Peking duck was dry unfortunately and at ~$5 for 1 piece, kind of expensive. There were two standouts, however. The curry pork bun was really good, but again, I could get just as good for less elsewhere. The cong you bing, despite the ridiculous price, was my favorite...flaky, light, and full of flavor, it was the best dimsum item we had.\n\nYank Sing also excels at desserts (which at normal dim sum places I never get to try since I'm usually too stuffed for dessert). The mango pudding was really yummy and refreshing. And the real stand out is the mango ice cream pie...cold ice cream (that somehow sticks together and doesn't melt!), delicious crust, a cheesecake bottom...this is probably the wierdest item I've enjoyed at a dimsum place, but it was definitely the best thing on the menu!\n\nWhile I've heard good things about Yank Sing, I felt like it didn't live up to the expectations that I had and the felt was simply just ok. Most of the diners were white and a lot of the menu items definitely seemed catered to non-Asian audiences (probably that mango ice cream pie!) and the menu doesn't have any Chinese on it (besides the name of the restaurant). These factors plus the prices definitely automatically made me skeptical and honestly, I probably would not come back or recommend this place, although I'm glad I was able to try it. Some places are not worth the buzz!", "author": "Kristen S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-02-01", "description": "Definite skip.\n\nI'll start with the positives.\n\nThe tea pot is pretty.  Clear glass with an infuser.  It's big too so no need for constant refills.\n\nService is good.  Very friendly staff (unlike typical Chinese restaurants) and yes, most staff speak English very well.\n\nParking is validated for 3 hours.\n\nDecor is restrained but nice and tasteful.  Not gaudy like most expensive Chinese places.\n\nNow for the negatives.  Yes, that really is all the positives.\n\nIt is EXPENSIVE!  Now, I'm ok with expensive.  I love Koi Palace, which is what I'm comparing Yank Sing to the most.  That said, while you get sticker shock at Koi Palace, once you bite into their food, you get an accompanying, \"Wow!  Yum!\"  You can see why they charge more.  Not here.  The food is mostly bad.\n\nThings like the har gow, siu mai and fried turnip cake are dry and/or bland.  Small too.  Worth $1 max, not the $5.25 they charge.  There was a coconut cream roll that was tasty, but it was small and seemed like it could have been made a while ago.  \n\nTheir famous Shanghai dumplings were alright.  Good I guess.  Koi Palace is still much better.  Throw in the price difference and it tastes worse here.   Plus they're small like at Din Tai Fung (SoCal locations).  For the record, I don't like Din Tai Fung.  I'm from down there.  While I have to say the DTF dumplings have skin that is made and cooked to perfection (consistent, perfect thickness and cooked just right), the meat and juice is super bland.  That lack of flavor ruins the flavor of the skin.  At least here, there's flavor.\n\nOverall, I'd give the food 2 stars.  However, considering how so much more expensive the food is, that drops things down to 1 star.  One last thing.  We went on a weekend.  The only Chinese people there came with white people except for us and one other table.  That tells you everything you need to know.  This place would last a month in SoCal.

Thank god for amazingly nice managers taking interns out...or I'd be out an easy $70-80 on this meal! \n\nAmbiance: Classy, upscale, fancy, and all that jazz. It's funny seeing the types of crowds in this area. You'll see people dressed really nicely, or the college kids in jeans. But regardless, the restaurant is a really nice place to have lunch and I highly recommend it for a corporate lunch or really for any nice occasion! \n\nFood: So unfortunately I'm vegetarian...but this didn't stop the party I went with from ordering almost every single vegetarian dish on the menu (overkill, but what a nice gesture). I sampled the vegetarian mushroom dumpling, some orange tofu dumpling, green beans, steamed broccoli, this empanada-type dish stuffed with tofu, and of course, the mango pudding so many yelpers raved about. Overall, I'd give this place a 3 for the food, but that's definitely because I'm a vegetarian. The options were limited, but from what I sampled, the mushroom dumpling was really tasty, full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The empanada dish had way too much oil for my taste, but interesting nonetheless. The other thing that stuck out was obviously the mango pudding. Not a smooth texture of pudding, but rather it was as if it had been in the fridge for a couple hours and served. So amazing--as good as the reviewers claim! \n\nWhere did the extra star come from? Impeccable service. The waitresses knew my manager since he comes so often, so she literally brought out all his favorites, without any questions, and kept coming back with vegetarian options every now and then so I didn't feel like there was no food at the table for me (there was enough food for me and my three other vegetarian family members). They were kind, quick, and knew their stuff. I have never been to a dim-sum place, so this was a new experience. But I liked watching how she stamped our bill with numbers each time we ordered something (so sneaky btw, you can end up spending SO MUCH because you feel like you're at a buffet) and since I wasn't paying, it was just more interesting than frightening! Our bill for a party of 5 came out to be $380 with tip...pretty damn steep but it's worth the experience! Plus I wasn't paying so...\n\nAlso, only open for lunch!! So make sure you plan your trip here.

Komen Race for the Cure to benefit breast cancer research.  While my times have steadily declined over the years, one thing that has not declined has been my enthusiasm for the post-race reward I have allowed myself: the ever-more popular Dim Sum for the Cure.  This year (2010), one of our group suggested that we go to Yank Sing instead of the usual Yet Wah.  Although I resisted this mucking about with tradition, it proved to be a most fortuitous and simultaneously wallet-lightening suggestion.\n\nThere were 7 of us dining this past Sunday (although only 3 actually ran), and we picked every quivering, steaming morsel that caught our eye.  The ladies pushing the carts around were pleasant and laughed with us as they marked our ticket, plying their delicious wares like the most seductive of sirens.\n\n\"Shanghai dumplings?  We make them soooo goooood here.  The skin is soft and delicate, while holding the flavorful juices within.\"  Oh God yes!  Yes!  We'll take two orders!\n\n\"BBQ Pork buns?  Why choose?

So delicate and exotic...so forbidden.  You can't get this anywhere else.\" (Ok, I may have exaggerated this part a little, but not the size.)  Ummm...unusual for dim sum...but yeah, ok, we'll take that too.  \n\nFor two glorious hours, it was simply wonderful, like a decadent, gluttonous dream.  Then, like the recent financial crisis, the check arrived, the party ended, and the hangover began.  Holy mackerel, did the party end.

I ran the numbers twice, then thrice, before I looked glumly around and told everyone the bad news.\n\nOne person considered declaring bankruptcy.  Another started talking about strategic default.  Yet another started berating her unlucky boyfriend for eating beyond his means.  But ultimately, stern-faced, we all reached into wallets and paid the piper.\n\nSo, is $45 a small price to pay for possibly the best dim sum in the area?

If you have a crowd ask for the magic scissors, have them cut all non-dumpling items in half so you have more to go around and can try other dishes instead ordering more of the same thing (unless you really like it of course).\n\nThey're really known for their shanghai dumplings which I think are just okay.  I especially like the different variety of vegetable dishes, not just vegetarian dumplings, that they bring around.  They also have a lot of deep fried/breaded dishes which I don't favour but cannot avoid when going with non-Chinese friends.  If you are like me, try to situate yourself closest to the aisle so you can commandeer the carts and pretend not to hear other requests.\n\nThe prices are quite high, easily over $30/person if not more.  I think for that price I would prefer Ton Kiang.\n\nCaveats:  Very crowded.  On the weekends the crowd fills the lobby area and outside seating in the atrium.  Get reservations.\n\nBike Parking: designated bike racks across the street from the Rincon center on Mission St.", "author": "Jean K."}

And I, for one, am never the type to turn down a free meal. \nActually, thank God for the company credit card. \nBecause while I don't mind plunking down good money for stellar food, I just can't justify eating here on my own dime. \n  Example: once, for lunch, it came out to over $100 for 2 of us! Yeah, unless you just killed a lobster and a baby cow and served them to me for the meal, would I be okay with that price for lunch. \n\nBut I digress. \nDespite the sticker shock, the food's actually pretty well made.

The seafood's fresh and the place is definitely clean and provides good service. My American colleagues love this place for those matters. \n\nBut wait! \nI don't expect good service at a dim sum place. I want the rude HK women yelling at me.

Instead of the predominantly shrimp and pork based selections served at most other middle-of-the-road dim sum restaurants, you'll find a diverse range at Yank Sing. From vegetable dumplings, to chicken w/shitake and cilantro ones, fat, juicy Xiao Long Bao's (meat dumplings), or chicken feet, mango pudding, and other standard dim sum dishes, expect all to be made with quality ingredients and delicious. \n\nI like to go and sip a cup of chrysanthemum poured from the beautiful clear teapot and snack on pan-fried yellow-chive dumplings, pork buns, and plenty of dumplings. The only dish I've disliked here is the peking duck. It's a dry sliver of duck, served on a white bun with hoisin and scallions. A typical dish, but I was surprised to see that they charged $12 per serving. Meaning, one sliver of duck + one bun = $12. If it had been particularly good, I may not have minded, but $12 is a bit much to pay for a bit of duck in my book. But besides the duck, you'll find plenty of other items that will surely please your palate. \n\nThe ambiance is comfortable, clean, and peaceful.  Service is attentive, despite sometimes being crowded, the staff will always accommodate your requests, and you will never feel lost within the hustle and bustle of a busy Saturday afternoon. Alternatively, if you prefer a peaceful meal, go when the restaurant opens at 9 a.m. for breakfast. Either way, don't forget to grab some egg tarts (dan tat) for later on your way out at Yank Sing to-go.", "author": "helen l."}

So, yes, I know the place even though I had not read all 973 Yelper reviews.  \nAnd I still haven't.\n\nAnyway, I knew the answers before I asked the questions -- it seemed like a fair test of the Yelp App.  I found the place on the map, opened the Yank Sing pin and brought up the Yelp.com page, where I enlarged the menu to an easy readability.\n\nSo, decision time -- whether to walk-in or walk-on by.  Three and a half stars.  OK.  \nThen there's a check-in item in the App.  So I hit that and also hit the Add button.  This was new stuff, what-what?  \nThings happen.  \nFirst, it broadcasts a notice to Yelp Friends that I checked-in at this 3.5 star Chinese restaurant. (I need to understand this part better).\nAlso, first, it posted \"Your Next Review Awaits\" on my Yelp.com welcome page along with a favicon of the menu.\n\nThat prompted me to rember Yelpers bad-mouthing the App for this:  some dedicated reviewers want to write their reviews on the phone's App in real time in the restaurant.  \nAlas, the current App allows you only to draft your review on the phone and you may only post it later from your computer. \n\nWell, I tried to prove the concept.  \nFirst problem I encountered was competition for right hand priority.  Both Yank Sing's plastic chop sticks and Apple's gleaming iPhone need the same hand (in my case the right) -- or you will have to alternate setting down the chopsticks and the iPhone.\n  \nThis is do-able, but there are consequences.  Second problem, the more you eat and the more often you set down the chopsticks, the messier you make the table -- so where to set down your expensive iPhone?  In your own greasy mess?\nI think not.\n\nEven worse, for thousands of years the Chinese have been pouring from pots that slop a lot of tea onto the table cloth. \nIf they haven't fixed that by now, they're not going to.  So Deal with it.\nDo NOT set your iPhone down on the tea-soaked table cloth.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Yank Sing's food, service and 3.5 star rating?\nForget about it.\nYou're going to be so busy punching buttons and trying to keep food off your iPhone/hand, you're not going to notice that stuff.\n\nAnd there you have it.", "author": "Peter N."}

My family can eat, but we spent a little more than double the amount at yank sing versus your average dim sum spot.  \n\nBefore we even sat down, there was a waitress at our table offering us the dishes on her cart.  The waitresses here are EXTREMELY aggressive and will even put food down on your table before you say that you want it.  However, everything looks so good that you will be hard pressed to actually say no.  haha.  \n\nA few of the standout items were the shu mai (is this actually bad anywhere?), stuffed mushrooms, seaweed tofu (a must try) and the kurobuta pork dumplings (supposedly the house specialty).  The one thing that really disappointed me was the baked bbq pork buns.  This is my favorite dim sum item and usually my standard for judging a dim sum place.  Yank sing failed miserably.  The bread was extremely dry and hard to eat.  They put too much of the glaze on top and the filling was just average.  A bit disappointing. \n\nWas this place worth double the amount that we usually pay for dim sum?  I am going to have to go with a no.  I forgot to mention that some of their dishes are per piece, so be careful with that (i.e.  lettuce wraps, peking duck).  They might use better quality ingredients than your average spot in chinatown, but once you add all the spices and sauces can you really tell a difference?  I like to compare it someone making a burrito using filet mignon vs your typical carne asada meat.  Aren't you just wasting filet mignon at that point?  \n\nAnyway, I'd only come back here if someone specifically requested it and I was not watching my budget.  The food is really good, but I just cant imagine paying this much for dim sum on a regular basis.  Parking is horrible, but what else is new in downtown SF?\n\nQuick tip...be careful when pouring the tea.

I'm looking at you Good Luck Dim Sum... \n\nthe first time I ate at Yank Sing they brought the carts around and offered me some shrimpy thing, to which I said no to and casually mentioned to the person I was dining with that I didn't like shrimp.

The restaurant was crowded when we got there with patrons filling up the tables located within the restaurant and throughout the adjacent common area.  However, we did not have to wait too long as we were promptly seated within 10 minutes.\n\nThe service was surprisingly pleasant being that Chinese dim sum restaurants usually have the stigma of not having the most polite service.  The wait staff was attentive and always provided us with bottomless cups of water.  Although our table was located in a corner adjacent to a wall, the dim sum carts would still regularly stop at our table. \n\nWe ordered about 8 typical dim sum dishes:  shu mai, fried pot stickers, shanghai steamed buns, scallop dumplings, spinach vegetarian dumplings; curry vegetarian dumplings, fried radish cake and flat rice noodles with roasted pork.  The cuisine was appetizing and well-prepared so together with the quality service that we received, we were going to rate the restaurant  4 stars and were thinking about coming back in the future..that is UNTIL we received our bill.  \n\nEver just want to say WHAT to a situation? To say the least, the bill caused us to regurgitate our food. For 8 typical dim sum dishes the total bill was around $60 (more than double of what normal dim sum places charge!). We had to ask the manager for a breakdown of the food prices (which most dim sum places provide a menu with the prices at the table, Yank Sing did not)  Notably, 2 extremely overpriced items were the fried pot stickers at $8.70 and the shanghai steam buns were $10.90 (it's not like they had shark fin in these buns)\n\nIf it weren't for the crazy prices, we might recommend Yank Sing.

The presentation for the \"Peking duck with flat bread, spring onions\" was flawless (the fat was completely gone& only the top layers were displayed)- the duck was sliced so perfectly, that my friend commented this is only place that's done it correctly besides Beijing. I personally like their Shanghai dumplings- it's rare for me to find a place (& a dim sum place to boot!) that can keep all the soup in the dumpling. \n\nThe other dishes were meh- I've had better shumai, shrimp dumplings, & Asian buns in L.A. \n\nAtmosphere-wise, this place is definitely fancier (&prolly pricier) than your average dim sum restaurant- but I think it's good to have a change in atmosphere every once in while.", "author": "Lucia C."}

All of which are delicious in their own ways!\n\nYank Sing's dim sum is very good, and perhaps the best I've eaten in SF. They are on top with their service. (something you usually don't get with Chinese Restaurants). If there's something you'd like, and you don't see it being pushed around in carts, simply ask one of the waitresses. Each worker wears ear pieces and microphones that helps one another communicate which helps us get our food in a snap.\n\nThis place is always jammed pack, and the prices are high compared to other Dim Sum places in SF.

The house special Shanghai pork dumpling was $12.95 for six pieces. And they go down quick. But they are crazy good little steaming hot dumplings full of a hot soup broth with tasty ground up pork inside. Sort of like a fat wonton. You sit at your table and they keep coming around with carts stacked with these bamboo bowl things with lids on them and they tell you what they have if you want to try it. Every time you get one, they mark it on your receipt and then count it up when you are done. Brilliant. I had a few other dumplings, pork buns, pot sticker things etc. and most of the time I had little idea what was in them. Could have been hound dog but I could have cared less, it was all very good. But it adds up quickly when many of these bowls are $7 to $12. I also got the Peking duck which was very good but sadly was a very small piece.

Are you comparing this restaurant to Chinatown? or dim sum in Hong Kong (where this deliciousness truly came from)? I grew up in Hong Kong & Shanghai, lived in both LA & SF, so I have so say that aside from the high price, this is as authentic as it gets here. \n\nTheir Shanghai dumplings: the key to this dish is that the skin must be thin yet DO NOT BREAK as you pick it up to eat. There should be juice or broth on the inside that has not leaked out. And filling should be pork meat, without loads of MSG or onions! The times I've come here, they have all met these criteria, so I'm willing to pay the price just to be transported back to my childhood, when I used to visit my grandma in shanghai every summer. \n\nHar Gau & other steamed dumplings: if you like your dumplings full of onions & leek, please do not come here. Their dumplings have really good quality ingredients and their skins DO NOT BREAK! I can't stress that enough because so many places, (even in HK), make dumplings that either fall apart or have skins super thick and chewy. Yuck! \n\nSnow pea shoot (dow miu?) is pretty good. Also fried spring rolls are pretty good here. The filling has pork, shitake, and cabbage, not stuffed with raw carrots & cabbage like some places in SoCal. I also love the fact that dishes are not very salty or full of MSG. Some people really like \"flavor\" but I prefer the milder taste of the ingredients alone. \n\nThe price is definitely $$$. But please don't say things like you could just go to chinatown for a third of that price and get the same thing. Because you really CAN'T get the same thing. Due to work & college, I haven't visited Asia in about 5 years, so when I really crave good dim sum I come here despite the price.

I'd be hard pressed to give the to go portion even 3 stars and I've actually been to a weeding catered by Yank Sing in the Rincon center so when my girlfriend suggested we go to Yank Sing for dim sum, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical since I knew it was going to bit a more expensive than a regular Dim Sum place. \n\nI was totally surprised. The dim sum was tasty and not greasy. They have these soup dumplings that are to die for. FYI if you don't know they're little dumplings that have a tiny bit of soup so you pick one up and put it on your spoon. Break it open and pour a little bit of the red vinegar you get and then you can sip on the soup from your spoon or try and soldier through and envelope the whole thing in your mouth. Depending on the temperature of the soup, the latter could cause you to scald the inside of your mouth. lol\n\nMost everything is else really flavorful and in comparison to most other dim sum places I've been to, much less greasy. The shumai was tasty with the pork and shrimp. The potstickers were delicious.\n\nThe one thing I'm torn on is the duck sandwiches. You know the little buns you get with a little bit sprig of green onion, piece of duck and some plum sauce to put on it. So I love duck sandwiches where you get a nice crispy piece of skin. Other places are usually good about it and the duck sandwiches even though are a bit more expensive still usually come three to an order. At Yank Sing they charge about 5 bucks for one and the pieces of duck are definitely much meatier but the skin wasn't that crispy. I have to say that was the one thing I felt I liked the cheaper grungier dim sum places.\n\nWe went a couple times before I decided to write this review to make sure it wasn't my extreme hunger that was skewing how I felt about this place. Both times the food was the same consistency.

My husband & I spent countless months in Socal looking for these delicious dumplings with no success.  We ended up in SF for an event llast year and stumpled upon YS dumplings.  We were seriously \"wow'ed\"..  They were perfectly cooked and they ginger/soy dipping sauce was the perfect complement, the meat filling was tasty, and when consumed all together with the savory soup, it was heavenly.. \n\nWe made our way to YS numerous times throughout the year and honestly, I believe the quality has decreased while the price seems to increase.  Last week the dumplings seemed off..  The restaurant was packed and the dumpling cart started off with the highest stacks of these dishes..  It seemed like they were 3-4 feet high.  Anyways, we eyed them around the restaurant and when they finally made it to us we were dissapointed.  The skin was hard, the meat was 'barely' a bite, and the lukewarm soup was just so-so..\n\nFor $1 a piece, it's hardly a bargain and the bill can add up really quickly.  We had about 7 different dishes and our bill was $50+.\n\nYS is definitely a great place to try dimsum for the first time, but once you start knowing your favorites, there are SO MANY other better places in & around SF.", "author": "Seung Eun C."}

The chili pepper sauce business made enough profits for them to move out of Chinatown and over to the Embarcadero area.\nSo when I was in San Francisco recently I was dying to go......but sadly it was over touristed and not the mystical place I built it up to be in my mind.  \nHonestly it is easy to please my Asian food palate after living in Italy for the past couple of decades where \"ethnic food\" was just accepted over the past 10 years but not evolved into anything super yummy yet. But even with my current low bar, Yank Sing was less than memorable.

I give this place two stars and the two stars are really for the decor and the service.  For Chinese restaurants, this is probably the cleanest place and offers you the most professional service.  Not trying to be racist but YS caters to Caucasians and not Chinese so everyone that works there speaks to you in English instead of Chinese which tells me one thing 1) the food isn't going to be that great.  Onto the food.\n\nWe only had a few different dim sums and then realized 1) the food wasn't good and 2) it was not worth it.  The bbq pork bun to start off with, there were only two, most restaurants have three which is fine.  The bun's shape wasn't well made, there weren't a lot of bbq pork in the bun, and it wasn't hot.  The shrimp dumpling was luke warm at best, so were the egg rolls, and so were rice noodles.  The rice noodles were $7, egg custards which we did not get were $9.  Egg custards at $9?  I'm definitely not one of those people who isn't willing to spend more on food and I'm not going to tell you that you'll get better quality in Chinatown but simply put the food is over priced and the quality is not there.  They also lack variety; many carts that came around were the same food over and over again.\n\nUnless I was invited to YS, I will not go back.", "author": "Pierre L."}

It was packed. Parking is free on the weekends at the Rincon Center. Give the ticket to the waiter and they will validate for you.\n\nTea is served right away when we get our seats. We waited probably less than 5 minutes. We sat down and next thing we know is people bombarding us with food choices. We order the standard har gao, yui chi gao and some specialties like the siu leung bao. Food was very fresh, hot, and steamy just the way I like it.  I had to use their special yank sing chili oil to compliment the dishes. The dumplings didn't stick to each other and didn't fall apart. However, the food itself was very plain and ordinary compared to other dim sum places.\n\nThe most important part of my meal I would like to discuss is the PRICE. For the group of three eating moderately with dessert (btw the mango pudding is terrible...) before tip was just over 100 bucks. I don't mind paying for food that is good and expensive but when food is regular and expensive, its just a rip off. The har gao was about 7 bucks, the siu leung bao was like 12 bucks for 7 pieces...For that price I could have bought 3 bags from 99 Ranch and steamed them and fed a family of 12.\n\nMy overall rating of this place is a 3 for good service, easy parking, and standard food.

I attended two wedding banquets here and the food is absolutely fresh and delicious! My favorite is the fried crab claw and sweet chili seabass. Their shark fin is really good too. Perfectly flavored and not just 3.8 shreds of shark fin in it. The service is attentive and efficient. I was the MOH in one of the weddings and they were right there to assist the bride and to help her with moving things in a timely manner. They were very accommodating and never rude or pushy. Yank Sing is definitely the place for brides who want the Chinese banquet food without the gaudy, depressing, or just plain dirty Chinese restaurants that are all over the city. The other option would be the one in the East Bay on the water. That place is kinda \"Chinese-y\" too, though. Yank Sing is definitely modern and American.\n\nDownside is the acoustics. The atrium goes about 5+ stories up so the sound is horrible. Guests in the rear can barely hear anything. The sound reaches about 1/4 of the way then starts bouncing around. This place is also super expensive and they will nickel and dime you for little changes you want. My friend wanted red napkins, but they would've charged her $1.50 per! C'mon, she's dropping over $40K on one night and they couldn't waive that fee?! They also wouldn't let her bring in vodka whereas she could bring in cognac.

I spent a significant portion of my life consuming soup dumplings, I can assure you. These were so excellent -- so much soup, and wonderfully tender meat filling inside. I only wish they served black vinegar instead of that red stuff. \n\nThe Peking duck was very disappointing, unfortunately. I was excited to have the opportunity to order an individual portion of Peking duck, as I rarely have reason to order an entire duck. But god....the duck was awful! The meat was gray, and there was none of the crispy skin that is really the absolute essence of Peking duck. I did, however, appreciate the very fluffy steamed buns. \n\nThe steamed pork buns were good, but oversized. I'd rather have four smaller ones than two enormous ones; it really changes the bun/meat ratio. I was not a big fan of the baked pork buns, and I remain convinced that the bun is whole wheat. It just tasted of like that! \n\nI also impulsively ordered shrimp toast, an item that I recall eating at family gatherings as a child. Given that it was $7.60, I did sort of regret it. The toast was pleasantly crunchy and greasy, but the huge balled up shrimp was a bit overwhelming after awhile. \n\nThe next time I'm here (and I will be, for the soup dumplings if nothing else), I want to try the snow pea shoot dumplings, the curry chicken turnovers, and fish (forget what kind it is, but looked beautiful). I really do like the variety of dim sum offered at Yank Sing. \n\nUltimately, I truly could not get over the prices. I suppose it is unfair to think it's ridiculous to pay so much for dim sum...not all ethnic food should automatically be considered as cheap food and I think higher prices for high quality food could really do a lot to improve the reputation of Chinese food. Another rant for another time...but I suppose what ultimately got me was that at the end of the day, you can get something just as good for quite a lot less.

Its rival is Koi Palace, though in Daly City, is better BUT the wait is just ridiculous over there.  \n\nThere have been a couple instances where I have been less than impressed but a majority of the time it is consistent and good.  The restaurant is also very clean, comfortable and nice.

The Rincon locations can get pretty crowded so I always go early and stay for a very long time (you can easily kill 2 hours).  The best table in the house is right close to the kitchen (my preference) so when all the Dim Sum ladies come rolling out their hot carts, you have first dibbs of all the hot dishes.  The place can get loud, but hey, good food... people.... loud... is what the Dim Sum experience is all about.  The dishes are hot and plenty and if there is something that you don't see, you can special order other dishes.  The service is always good.  It can be a little pricey, but I don't mind paying more if I know that the food is going to be delish.\n\nThe restaurant is also open on Sunday's for brunch.  They open up the courtyard for extra seating.  It can get pretty crowded with people waiting to be seated so best to make reservations ahead of time.\n\nIf you've never had Dim Sum and want to try for the first time, have your first experience at Yank Sing... you can't go wrong.  If you do and find out it's not for your taste buds, at least you've experience it.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Miriam O."}

And Yank Sing is undoubtedly one of the better places for it in the City. For sure, it is fairly Westernized, catering in large part to tourists and the well-heeled, and *not cheap* but it's an enjoyable weekend destination, particularly on wet weekend Sundays (like today!)\n\nI hadnt been here in a while -- and in my excitement, I had almost completely forgotten the basic rule -- PACE YOURSELF. Every time, in Yank Sing, after getting there and getting seated, you are immediately assaulted by a dozen Dim Sum options in very quick succession. If you waver, they'll deliver the dish to your table anyway. Soon, before I realized it, I had ordered Pot Stickers, Port Dumplings, some kind of Shrimp delight as well as Chinese Broccoli and some tea to wash it all down. (I followed it up with a Tsing Tao beer to steady my nerves...) A quick injection of excellent food... After that, I regained composure, and started to take stock of what else was on offer. The Pork Siu Mye was a must, as was the Shrimp Dumplings -- and of course, some Egg Custard Tarts to finish. Outstanding!\n\nHowever, there is a price to pay. It's very difficult to keep track of the dishes, and at up to $9.00 a pop, the cost of the meal mounts very quickly. So, definitely a fun, satisfying, once-in-a-while treat, but certainly not an everyday destination.", "author": "donal c."}

The food is SO expensive relative to other dim sum places! Paying $7 for an order of dim sum is ridiculous, in my opinion. And the food wasn't particularly spectacular. The Xiao Long Baos were very tasty, and there was a chicken/mushroom dumpling that was very delish. But other than that, it was standard dim sum quality. The service, however, was atrocious. We had 2 tables in our group, and we each ordered a rice and a noodle dish. One table received both orders after about 30 minutes, and had time to eat it all, while the other table's order hadn't arrived yet! After waiting another 15 minutes, I had to go complain to the hostess before the food was brought out. During this time, barely any food was brought out in the carts. We had also ordered a beef rice noodle roll early in the process, along with two shrimp rolls. The waiter brought our shrimp rolls and said the beef rolls were still cooking, so we would have to wait a couple minutes. We all forgot about it until we were starting on dessert, and the waiter comes and asks if we still wanted to get the beef rolls. So the 'couple minutes' meant 45 minutes!

For the first time in about two years I visited with my family and was surprised to see the check come in at $120 (btw, no alcohol).  I was looking over the check when a hostess came over and just outright asked me if I would like her to help me \"figure out the charges on my bill\" - like it was a routine task that customers were surprised by the bill and needed a translation from their obscure system of markings and line items on the check.  The hostess ignored me when I told her that \"No, I'm fine, I'm sure the check must be correct\" and just launched into a rather loud and I must say embarrassing accounting of each dish with the charges on the check.  It was as if I'd challenged their integrity and they were going to publicly prove me wrong. \n\nMy opinion is that they have managed to price themselves to perfection.  The businessman who needs to keep an eye on his expense account budget is going to think twice.  At $12.50 the small plate of walnut shrimp either needs to be impressive and if not, the customer must not know any better.\n\nI'm not in the Dim Sum business so maybe this pricing strategy is working for the owners.

I never had that before.\n\nCons:\n*Although they have a plethora of dishes, some of them were cold or luke warm....its takes away from the yummy dish :(\n* It was a little overwhelming bc waiters were coming at you from every direction. We would be looking at one cart on my right and another 2 waiters would come to my left and shove dishes in my face....back off!!!!\n*It's in the embarcadero area, so street parking can be VERY limited. \n\nOverall, the food was good. But it's not the best dim sum I've had. I think the experience is nicer becuase of the location and the crowd it draws. But I've had better for cheaper.", "author": "Radha X."}

But, of course, I never listen to my mom.\n\n- The service was excruciatingly slow. They rarely filled our tea pot.\n- The food was appallingly mediocre, AND they had NO variety. It was clearly gringo-fied dim sum because they only served the deep-fried stuff that normal Cantonese people don't eat, i.e. potstickers or jin dui (fried glutinous rice balls) or ja liang (fried Chinese \"doughnut\") or fried egg rolls. Each tray that passed by my mom got a slow shake of disapproval and contempt.\n- It was embarrassing bringing my Hong Kong-native parents here. They just sat politely and quietly the whole time - HUNGRY - because they knew I felt bad for bringing them here on behalf of the 1000+ positive Yelp reviews. \n- The tea wasn't even that great. We ordered jasmine tea, and the tea didn't smell floral or taste crisp and sweet. It was generic tea. Come on!!! Dim sum is about \"yum cha\"; it's about taking your time, philosophizing about life, over a pot of excellent tea. And Yank Sing couldn't even guarantee that? \n\nNow, here's the worst part. After paying the enormously expensive bill ($50 for 5 dim sum dishes.. uh. yeah), my mom leaned over to a server and wondered aloud in Cantonese, \"Everything is expensive beyond belief.

Yang Sing is one of the few places we will go for dim sum. Although it IS overpriced and they offer a lot of westernized dishes aside from the traditional dim sum items, the taste is stable and of good quality (for America). The ingredients are fresh and the taste is better than most dim sum places in the Bay Area. The environment is also very comfortable, clean and classy, another reason why I would choose to go here. \n\nBUTTTTTT!!!!!!!! The service is no bueno.....unless you speak English and English only. Or at least that was what was carried across during my last visit. While the manager and servers were courteous and friendly, the majority of the dim sum cart ladies were rather rude when they talked to us in Cantonese (our mistake for letting them know that we knew the dialect; I cannot understand dim sum items when they're \"translated\" to English, so I had to ask what it was in Cantonese). No smiles, no thank you's...just a bunch of glaring, shouting and frowning. It would be more understandable if we had been difficult customers with ridiculous demands or rude attitude - no, we were perfectly civilized people wanting to enjoy dim sum with our out-of-town guests. Oh I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that only non-Cantonese speaking individuals (indeed the majority of their customers) deserved your respect and attention.\n\nNormally we are chill customers and rarely complain to the managers. But one lady in particular was so bad that we felt it was necessary to report her (if that does anything?). I closely observed her - she gave every table a bright smile and almost bowed when she thanked them. As soon as she came into proximity with our table, the cheesy smile disappears and turns into a frown - before anything was said. In one instance, she was carrying pan-fried buns, which are traditionally made with pork. The ones she carried were chicken, and my dad, who doesn't eat beef, did not hear her and politely asked if there was any beef in the buns. To all of our surprise (dismay), she shot my dad a scornful glare and shouted (in English) \"CHICKEN!\" before proceeding with a look of annoyance. It sure did not sound like she was reiterating but instead it sounded like she was scolding him for mistaking (or so she thought) \"beef\" in Chinese for \"chicken\" in English. Needless to say, it pissed her off even more that we did not order the buns (evident by the rolling of her eyes.) Later on, she skipped our table a couple of times and made a face every time she inched close. SERIOUSLY? We did NOTHING wrong. \n\nLASTLY - the manager's initial reaction to our complaint was \"Really? But she has been working here for a really long time!\" .....umm are you trying to imply that we are making up the story and that there is no chance for a long-time employee to act so rudely to its customers? \n\nOf course, there were some ladies who were polite and treated us the same as everyone else. But overall, I was disgusted by how certain employees favored and sucked up to a particular crowd of customers. Though we thought the food was good, we did not feel welcomed by the restaurant at all. \n\nI don't know.

Though the dim sum options and quality in Yang Sink don't come near to the ones in China, it's still pretty decent, especially other dim sum places in the bay area are fairly mediocre. \n\nI like their shrimp dumpling the most, thin wrap with fresh shrimp filling, which is the best you can get so far in the bay area. The dim sum at Yang Sink is on the pricey end. It can get very busy during lunch on the weekends. Parking is validated. \n\nI would recommend it if you want authentic Cantonese dim sum.

We arrived today and found it to be as busy at lunch time as usual.  While my husband parked the car, I signed in for the one half hour wait  to be seated.   During that time I noticed there were fewer carts offering tasty morsels than in the past.  Although the dining room and atrium were full and lots of diners waiting, it seemed as though the food was either not being prepared quickly enough or was on rationing.  We did get seated within the promised 30 minutes, but no food was wheeled by our table for quite some time and we had to ask for tea, twice.  Also, the same carts kept circling and there was not the variety of offerings we have come to expect.  We asked for several dishes, as is customary to do, and they did not arrive for quite some time.   \nTo be fair, the food was pretty good, but each piece seemed to less dainty and fewer servings were given on each plate.   For a lunch that was almost $100, with tip,  I hope Yank Sing will return to its former, award winning glory so all those miles down the freeway still seem worthwhile.", "author": "Donalyn D."}

I love their steamed and baked pork buns here. ::drools:: And their chicken feet are pretty meaty. They have a signature shrimp dumpling dish. It was pretty good, but a little too wet for my taste. You'll never have to wait long for a cart or server to walk by, so your table will never be empty. Also, what I love about this place is that if you request a certain dish that they don't have on the cart, they will place your order through their radio system and someone will bring your dish straight to your table (no waiting for them to cycle through with their cart!). There are plenty of indoor and outdoor seating so the wait for a table to never long. And I love how the servers here can actually communicate in multiple dialects, not just Cantonese. And, here's a big plus for those non-Chinese dim sum lovers, the servers here actually speak English pretty well so there won't be anything lost in translation. Hahaha! If you're willing to pay just a little more for a great dim sum experience, I would definitely recommend eating here.\n\nAlso, if you eat here on the weekends, you can park in the garage and they'll validate your parking ticket.

YS definitely took care of the food part.\n\nthey have a few different banquet menus you can choose from. they also let you substitute certain items and charge the price difference (if needed).  compared to the dim sum, i found the banquet prices to be more palatable.  sure, you can get cheaper menus elsewhere, but if you really want chinese food at your wedding with ambiance and good service, it's well worth the price.\n\ni loved being able to serve dim sum items as the cocktail hour hors d'oeuvres.  servers passed around bbq pork buns, shrimp dumplings, siu mai, etc.  \n\nthey also have a room that's set aside for the wedding party. you can change clothes in there, touch up hair/makeup, hide out from relatives, etc.  \n\nbasically they are pros at the wedding thing.  their servers even take the bride/groom around and facilitate the table toasting ritual. they make sure you don't get stuck at a table for too long and keep the show moving.  that was key for my 300 guest wedding.\n\nto top it all off, you can have the reception out in the atrium and it's beautiful. only downside is it's kinda echo-y for speeches, announcements, etc. but who really cares about that stuff anyway? the food is delicious!", "author": "Jill L."}

Tucked down an alley, the building itself is upscale and far nicer than most other dim sum places.  I was seated at a table and the carts started swooping around me immediately.  I grabbed a few things that looked good, along with a few more traditional dishes.  The bill came to about $40, and I was definitely full, but for all the hype I was actually pretty disappointed.  The dishes were ok, but not stellar.  The glazed seabass was overcooked and dry, and the har gau dumplings and shu mai were very pretty, but not particularly tender or flavorful.  For dessert I tried a mango custard, and found it to be incredibly bland and unremarkable.  The staff are efficient and attentive and the ambiance is gorgeous, but the food was just subpar.

Dumplings, pork buns, stuffed mushrooms, beef in rice noodles (yum), pot-stickers, broccolini, Schezuan chicken, roast pork, and it just kept coming and coming!  I'm rather severely allergic to shrimp so I was highly impressed when they went out of their way to point out what had shrimp in it and what didn't and they put a special note (in Chinese) on the table so that the servers wouldn't serve me shrimp.  I think the note said \"No shrimpy eatie!\" or \"No shrimp for you!\" or something like that.  Anyways I felt special.  My only issue with this place is the duck cart.

No one should ever have to spend $$$ on dimsum unless it's some REALLY gourmet stuff.\n\nThe dimsum was good, I loved the soup dumplings (aka. Xiao long Bao) but not worth the price. It was pretty standard dimsum, the type you can get by running over to China Town and spending half the price.\n\nWe went with the basic stuff, hakaw, siomai, xiao long bao, steamed pork buns, steamed scallop dimsum, chicken feet, deep fried prawns wtih scallions and cilantro (this I LOVED)...\n\nI have yet to encounter an order of chicken feet from a dimsum restaurant that I did not enjoy. Most people are hesitant to try this dish, but I gotta admit... it's the part of the chicken that holds the most flavor.\n\nThe dough the soup dumplings were served in was soft and tender. Although the dumplings werent too hot by the time I got to them. Which was a little disappointing. And it was served with a red vinegar sauce as opposed to the black that I'm used to. Still did it's job... But wasn't as great of a fit as the black vinegar sauce.\n\n\nSo, that's really all I've got to say. Good dimsum. Nothing amazing that I can really rave about. And way too expensive. I suppose it's just the location. But if I were you, I'd drive down to Chinatown for the real deal for half the price.", "author": "Jenny D."}

Yank Sing has converted me to a dim sum lover, for I now know what is possible. The quality and taste of the food is just amazing. We sampled items from nearly a third of the menu, and absolutely none were subpar. The shanghai dumplings and Sichuan chicken were some of the best I ever had. They do provide a menu with the prices of each item, so no surprises were had on the bill--which was, of course, hefty.

We arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday, our party of 6 was seated right away and the service was unbelievably friendly and helpful I felt like something was wrong. It just did not feel like dim sum.\n\nI can't disagree, the prices are quite shocking when we first looked at the menu but the combination of the service and the quality of food made up for it and in the end what we paid wasn't terribly ridiculous.\n\nI was really looking forward to the xiao long bao since many gave it great reviews and I am such a huge fan. We carefully tried taking the dumplings out of the container onto the provided spoon but sadly the wrapper tore spilling out some of the precious broth on about 5 out of the 6 dumplings making it really disappointing especially at $11 an order.\n\nEverything else however was absolutely delicious. You could taste a difference in the quality of the ingredients of even in the most basic of dim sum dishes. For example, I usually can take or leave har gow, but the shrimp in the ones at Yank Sing were so sweet that we had to order more.\n\nI go to dim sum so rarely that I'm okay with paying a little more for excellent service and delicious food so I will definitely come back here again.", "author": "Cindy N."}

I've only been to the actual restaurant twice (once for a food tasting and once for dim sum), so I'm not going to comment on that.\n\nOur wedding was the best wedding ever (yes, yes, I know I'm biased because it was our wedding).  \n\nYes, this place is pricey, but was it worth it, definitely!  Our venue was gorgeous!  Having our banquet catered into the Atrium was probably the best decision we made wedding wise (aside from marrying each other, of course...I know, I know...gag). \n\nMy husband and I both wanted to have Chinese food at our wedding but I was 100% against having it at a Chinese restaurant.  I didn't want tacky decorations, loud servers, dishes clanging...no thank you..not on my wedding day!  So this place was the PERFECT compromise.\n\nJoy, who was their events coordinator, was sooo helpful.  She really did take care of everything!  We told her what we wanted from the menus, switched things around, and she made it happen.  \n\nThe customer service was superb.  All of our friends kept on commenting about how helpful the staff were.  On our wedding day, they even brought in an extra coordinator to help with our event.  The restaurant converts a room into a bridal room to put gifts, to change and such, with mirrors and everything!  \n\nWhen we made our entrance to the reception, there were staff and servers that popped out of no where to help show us where to go as we made our way up to the head table.  There was also a lady (who was super nice) that patiently led us around the Atrium (to all 40 something tables) for us to toast.  \n\nYou can tell that the staff definitely know what they're doing when it comes to weddings because everything went so smoothly and if anything ever went wrong, I had no clue.  They really made sure that they talked to my coordinator, bridal party, or parents, as opposed to me so that I could enjoy my day with my new hubs.\n\nIf we could redo our wedding, this one thing we would never change..hands down!", "author": "Tracy M."}

I had only been to Yank Sing for dim sum 2 other times, and never really got exactly what I wanted since I went with my Caucasian co-workers. I didn't want to scare them with the traditional Chinese dishes. \n\nThe scene:\n\nYank Sing is very fancy so be prepared to shell out $20-$30 per person on dim sum.\n\nThe food:\n\nWhat sets Yank Sing apart from other dim sum restaurants are their original dishes such as the succulent sea bass and the red cabbage salad. The sea bass is definitely my favorite, but it's $18 a plate! Their house made chili sauce is bomb too. It's similar to XO sauce minus the seafood. I believe they also sell it at 99 Ranch Market.\n\nShu-mai (meat balls) - I'm not a big shu-mai fan, even though it is a traditional dim sum item. I always found it too meaty, nothing special. However, Yank Sing's version of the shu-mai is so flavorful and juicy! It's almost like the meat in a xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup dumpling).\n\nHar-gow (shrimp dumpling) - This har-gow really wasn't any different than any other har-gow.\n\nBeef cherng-fun (noodle roll filled with ground beef) - By far, my favorite dish at any dim sum restaurant. They put way too much cilantro in their cherng fun though. I am not a fan.\n\nFried tofu - Again, nothing mind blowing. This was just cold, lightly fried tofu with soy sauce. I love tofu, so I usually get this at any Chinese restaurant that serves it.\n\nJin Dui (sesame ball filled with lotus paste) - This is THE BEST jin dui ever. I could just get an order of this and be satisfied. The doughy skin was thin, chewy and crispy. The inside dough is orange in color, which makes me assume the dough is made from yams. I could be wrong. The inside filling is a sweet lotus paste rather than the red bean.\n\nWe ended up spending $25 a person for only 6 dishes. It's a little outrageous, so I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. I may come back to get an order of jin duis to go though.", "author": "Sam L."}

Splurge is an understatement, given the amazingly good and reasonably priced fair within a mile or two from here.\n\nBut I love the soup INSIDE the dumplings. Dunno what it's called because I can't understand a word anyone is saying. (No, not all of us asians understand each other, thank you). I cannot get enough of this highly expensive but delightful dish. Delight is inadequate. I feel like a kid at Christmas time every time I bite into one of these explosions of flavor.\n\nI typically order the shrimp and crab plates that go by and avoid the hearty stuff. With a glass of plum wine, lunch is around $25 with tip. That's my treat to myself when I'm in this city. Have a nice lunch at the bar (or table, if I'm trying to dine with a customer) and have a big smile on my face for a few hours.\n\nAre there less expensive places out there? Of course. But hit the streets of NYC, Chicago, Honolulu, or DC and see if you get an upscale Chinese restaurant without these prices. It's not a place to eat on a daily basis, but definitely worth it for a nice visit.

Yay!)\n-broccoli (cooked correctly, had nice bright green color and were tender without losing the snap)\n-tea (loose leaf was a huge plus and was fragrant)\n-seabass (expensive!

Very few places in the city, let along a Chinese restaurant, can provide such a cool atmosphere in the middle of an office building.  The food was really good as well.  Every item we ordered was delicious--- from the buns that sandwiched my Peking duck to the soft tofu dessert, you can taste the delicate preparation that went into it, with no trace of MSG (which City View never failed to remind me of 30 to 45 min after my meal there).  \n\nLastly, the service was excellent.  Always polite, always attentive to our needs.  The clumsy me dropped a chopstick which was replaced seamlessly by the waiter who happened to pass by me.  My request for turnip cake was transmitted from the cart lady's mic to the kitchen instantly, and showed up on our table within minutes.

To wit: host-type people in suits materialize as soon as you sit down, offering to bring tea, diet coke or what have you.  Halfway through your meal, someone is likely to show up and ask if you'd like to order any take out from next door (smart move - if you had hired McKinsey & Co. they surely would have suggested that as a way to drive incremental revenue, probably on the order of an additional 5 - 10% per table).   If there's something you desire that isn't on one of the carts, ask anyone, and they'll whisper into that handy-dandy headset thingy (reminiscent of Banana Republic) and within minutes your chow fun or other special order will be at your table.  \n\nAtmosphere is not as authentic-feeling as (and much more expensive than) Ton Kiang, Koi Palace or the other Dim Sum stalwarts, but the food is great, there's a broad array of both traditional dim sum offerings and a bit of innovation here and there, the dishes are fresh, and tend to be lighter and less greasy, and it's a great place to take less adventurous folks who might recoil when having chicken feet waved under their noses at a more traditional dim sum venue.

I've come to that conclusion. you need to go to Hong Kong or at the very least vancouver) such as Koi Palace, Flower Lounge, Fook Yuen, Tai Wu, and Yank Sing is definitely up there with them. I felt that the food was not overly greasy/ salty or sweet. For example the charsui bao had the perfect amount of sweetness and meat. It wasn't a crazy dark red color from food coloring like most other places. and the bread was soft and not overly sweet either. Even the egg custard (dahn tat) was cooked perfectly. Many times even at the better dim sum places they over bake it and the egg turns out too rubbery and eggy tasting. I was impressed by that. And the mango pudding here is much better than the other places too. \n\nDefinitely come here for good quality dim sum. But don't expect it to be dirt cheap compared to the take out places on clement. \n\nAlso why would you eat out in the Fi-Ni, embarcadero area and expect it to be cheap?

The service was just a-okay. (Why?) During refills of water and pouring of champagne into glasses, our waiter always seemed to forget about my (invisible) fiance. It wasn't till I said \"hey Yen (I think that's his name?), can you fill his glass up too?\". That's when he finally remembered we had 10 people at our table and not 9.\n\n1) Chinese cold cuts - everything was decent. What stood out to me was the drunken cold chicken with it's slither down your throat meat in your mouth taste with a hint of wine. mmm....\n\n2) Lobster - sorry about the poor name, I'm obviously not good with name. But for all those Chinese food loving people, it's the lobster all cut up and they have that gooey suck it sauce on it. I've always been a fan of this and Yank Sing did not disappoint.\n\n3) Shark's Fin Soup - this is typical of all Chinese banquets. The soup was tasty, although honestly, I sometimes can't tell the difference between shark's fin and vermicilli.\n\n4) Duck with bun - I've always loved duck... add hoisin sauce and those buns with some scallions and it's heaven in my mouth! The duck skin was nice and crispy and you couldn't taste on the fat going down your throat.\n\n5) Fook Yin Rice - I'm honestly not a fan of this, the sauce is just a bit much for me. They had mushrooms, bamboo, celery... just a bunch of random stuff with rice and egg on the bottom.\n\n6) Mango pudding - I love mango... I love pudding... they had little pieces of mango here and there so it was like tasting hidden treasures when eating by the spoonful.\n\nThere were probably 3 other dishes, but I forgot what it was.

Dim Sum isnt slopped on a messy dish like So Cal.  Everything is petite, clean, and plated very clean.  Xiao Long Baos were very good.  Not sure what the best one is, but these were particularly tasty.  Again, nice acryllic tea pots.  \n\nIn the end, I wanted to treat the family to sunday brunch.....YOWZA... $215 plus tax and tip.  My anus is still quite red from that one.   Can you YANK MY SING anymore you sneaky carnivorous suckers!?!?!?!!!!  You got me good...you shit!!..

It's like a high class assembly line, the way the food comes around. It was a different experience. I believe this was a dim sum style restaurant. Not sure if this is how all of them operate, or if this was exclusive to here.  They roll around with carts, like at fine restaurants with the dessert carts, but instead of dessert, it's dim sum, which was cool, but be careful because you will rack up a nice size bill. You get excited because you just wanna try it all. There was quite a bit of waste because there were quite a few items that looked amazing but did not taste amazing. So I would suggest being very strategic in your ordering. Also ask for only a half order of what you want because they may have 4 pieces of something on the plate, and you may only want 2 pieces. If you don't tell them they will give you the whole order and you pay for the whole order, but be quick about it, cuz before you know it, they have dropped, marked, and ran. Marked means as you order they mark this\"tab\" that stays on your table as you get sucked up in the vortex of all these choices floating around the room. Ultimately, it was worth the experience. Would I visit them again while in SF??? Probably not. Check it out though.", "author": "ANGELA J."}

The places in Monterey Park and Rosemead are so much cheaper- here you must have a considerable budget to afford the otherwise super good Shanghai pork dumplings with vinegar and ginger, and all other goodies.\n\nOne thing we appreciate about this restaurant (especially this location): unlike many other Dim-Sum restaurants, this one has a bit more attractive visual presentation...

It is so popular that they have the restaurant and tables in the atrium of the office building where the restaurant is located.  They must be able to seat 200+ people.  Get there early or wait in line.  They do take reservations, although we didn't have any the last time and still got sat right away.\n\nThe purpose of dim sum is affordable good food.  This place is far from that.  The basics are mostly good, but some of my favorites are disappointing here.  Since I was a wee lad, my favorite Chinese food item has been the steamed Char Siu Bao (yeah that is spelled a hundred different ways).  The filling is the key.  Put lean meat and a tasty sauce in there.  For dim sum, you usually get the small sized baos so that they can get 3 of them in one of those steamer trays.  At a good spot, I usually approach double digits eating these delicious morsels.  The Char Siu Bao here were mostly a not-so-flavorful sauce and fat.  I struggled to eat 2.  \n\nWe had another dumpling dish that came in a large bamboo tray with about 8 dumplings filled with chicken and broth.  It was supposed to be special.  Unfortunately, the dumplings had absolutely no flavor.  \n\nThe wife and I racked up a bill of $85 - food, a beer, and a diet coke.  Wow.  The cost alone forces me to pull down a star.

Nonetheless, I ate many delectable things.\n\nOur benchmark is the Empress Pavillion in Los Angeles' Chinatown, with equally great food. There, our group of 8 MIGHT run up a tab of $100, (And believe me, we make pigs of ourselves. Here, it was $275 or $45 bucks a person.

I have been to Yank Sing a lot since it is a family favorite. Not until recently did I have a chance to peek at the bill. wow, dim sum for 3 for $80.00!!\n\nHere is why its worth it:\n\nFirst of all, its in SOMA. I mean the Fairy Building serves fish and chips for $17.50.  So you got to expect the price to be high. You are in a nice neighborhood, it doesn't smell like china town with that odd mixture of rotting garbage and good food. It smells fresh, its in a  part of San Francisco where the some comes out a lot. Prices are going to be higher for that reason. I mean, there are million dollar apartments around you.\n\nAnd you have to talk about the quality of dim sum. Yes, I admit I have had better dim sum before, in Hong Kong. Each piece of dim sum is smaller then the dim sum peaces at places around the bay area. And you might be confused and start thinking that they are trying to rip you off  by using less filling in the dim sum. I can see that happening in this super sized culture we have created in the US. They aren't trying to cut the portions, its how dim sum should be. Tightly packed with pork or shrimp not filled with fillers like corn starch. The quality of dim sum is really high. \n\nService, last week I went to dim sum with a non-asian friend of mine. She asked why the waitresses were so rude. My simple reply was, \"it's dim sum you aren't paying for service, you are paying for dim sum.\" Well, thats not the case here! Excellent service, I mean really superb. They speak multiple dialects of Chinese and you don't have to worry about them not being able to make out your English like you do in China Town. There was an old Jewish couple at the table next to us and they got served just fine. Speaking of being served. The carts come fast, there is no waiting for the cart with the dim sum to come around to your table, it's there. And! if it's not? Every cart serves has a headset and you can ask them for whatever you want and the order goes through the headset and comes in less then a minute. Ridiculously awesome.\n\nThe place is clean, super clean. This is authentic Chinese fine dining-- no fusion involved. This is something you see straight out of Hong Kong, a restaurant equivalent to a nice steak place here, culturally different of course. This is why things are a little pricier, the dim sum places you find in China Town are equivalent to going to Denny's for steak or maybe at best Outback Steak House, you get my point.\n\n\nAnyways, enough with defending the price, here is my latest experience:\n\nIt was a nice Sunny Saturday morning here in SOMA, we were headed out for brunch then, we were going to head over the the fairy building for farmers market, we stuck to the basics:\n\nSui Mai - Har Gau - Lo Bak Goh - Wu Gock - Pai Gaut - Nua mi fun\nhttp://chinesefood.about.com/library/blmenutransdimsum.htm\n\nThey also had these really good Taiwanese dumplings called - xiao long bao. Goodness I haven't had xiao long bao since I was in Taiwan.\n\nAnd to top it off we had some Pan Friend crispy noodle- which came with a generous portion of seafood, I mean, really good stuff.\n\nSatisfied we paid and bought two jars of their house made hot sauce and we were on our way, full and satisfied.\n\nSo there you go, $80 bucks, great service, superb food; 5 stars for sure.\n\nnote: Don't get me wrong, I love going to china-town too. I really am not all posh and stuck-up as this review makes me out to be, there just needs to be a clarification of what this place is all about.", "author": "Steve L."}

Couldn't find it in Chinatown, and thus we ended up at Yank Sing.\n\nBut when given a wait time of 30-40 min, we made the best of our situation and went next door to Yank Sing 2 Go. Ordered 3 boxes of dumplings and steered ourselves to the Ferry Market Building.  As a note of caution, none of the desserts at Yank Sing will be able to trump the sweet treats at the market.  So shun any notion of ordering the sesame balls, egg or mango custard.

Yes, I get that food quality is much higher here than some other restaurants but I really do not think 6 potstickers ought to cost $10.  I can only see myself coming here more often if I win the lottery or if I suddenly stumble upon an extra $100 that I really do not know what to do with.  \n\nService was excellent though!!!  Glass of water was never half empty; the waiters all spoke English and chinese (either Cantonese or Mandarin) and refilled our tea pot promptly.  The food servers all asked if we wanted anything from their cart and if we denied, they said \"thank you\" and moved on.  Here is the good part...we came specifically to try the peking duck.  Once we sat down, we sat the cart roll by 2 tables away from us but we were distracted by the waiter asking us what tea we wanted.  Throughout the meal, we kept looking for it but it never showed up again.  After we were all done eating what we had on our table, the waiter noticed we were looking around and asked if we wanted to order something, we mentioned to him we wanted to try the peking duck and ordered 2.  A few minutes later, I noticed a woman bring to the table behind us 2 peking duck pieces but nothing for us.  Another server asked us what we were waiting for and asked our waiter about our order.  He went to the back and checked but came back and told us they were cutting the pieces and would come out shortly and apologized.  When the item did come out, he apologized again and said, \"this is on the house, sorry you had to wait so long.\"  WHAT?!  I've never heard anyone apologize this many times and then offer the item for free at ANY chinese dim sum restaurant!!!! I was really shocked that this kind of service is still to be found and that they really want their customers to be happy when they leave.  That was a really good way to end the meal.\n\nIf only Yank Sing were not so expensive, I would come back in a heartbeat but unfortunately, I have not yet won the lottery.", "author": "judy l."}

As a child, my family would eat dim sum about 4 times a year, we always enjoy the fresh Asian flavors.  It's similar to the Chinese version of tapas.  I always enjoy being able to \"taste\" a bit of everything at the table.  When a colleague invited us to a lunch there, I was all over it.\n\nWe dined on a Thursday lunch among a mostly business/workday crowd.  The restaurant is located in a great food court in a low-rise office building.  The food court has a beautiful water feature in the middle.  The clientele seems to be a sophisticated lot.\n\nDim sum is best consumed with at least 4 people, 5 or 6 is ideal (imo).  This gives the diner the ability to sample a variety of plates, and not have to finish every one.  With only 2 diners, you may only be able to sample two or three plates.\n\nMy group of 5 ordered about 15 dishes, including 2 xiao long bao, pork sui mye, lettuce wraps, steam pork bun, potstickers, spring rolls, egg custard tarts, sea bass, lettuce wraps.  I tasted all but two of the dishes and (thoroughly) enjoyed each one.  The servers pushing hot steam carts to our table were relentless from the time we sat down; they came so often, that we had a log jam of food on our table after the fourth cart.\n\nMy two favorite dishes were the xiao long bai and the sea bass.\nThe xiao long bao is magnificent, my dining mate from New Jersey asked for another order, this being her first time trying dim sum.  The dumpling skin had a firm steamed texture and the broth inside was perfectly savory.  The sea bass had a beautifully broiled outside, with a subtly sweet crust and a flaky tender flesh.\n\nThe wait staff was very attentive, and quick to answer any requests.  The dining room is very clean, with a nice heavy feel.  We arrived at 11:45 and didn't have to wait.\n\nI wanted to try everything in this restaurant.  Every other dish looked terrific.  The bill for five us was $250 w/tip.", "author": "Parris B."}

I'm used to seeing a whole bunch of Chinese folks, everybody being loud and obnoxious, including the wait staff. \r\n\r\nAnd I just can't believe between us two little ass people; we had at least 12 orders of stuff. It's either:\r\n1.) We were really, really hungry, or \r\n2.) The food was really good. \r\n\r\nI think it's a mix of both. The food was good, but it is not that great because: \r\n\r\n- Shrimp cheung fun (shrimp wrapped in rice noodles) is my ultimate favorite dish when I eat dim sum. So I'm pretty damn picky about this particular item. Yank Sing's is a little different. The rice noodle wrapping is clearer than it's supposed to be, giving it a more chewy texture. I don't really like that. \r\n\r\n- Daan tat (egg custard) was ugh... Edible, but was not brown, crispy and flaky enough. Undercooked. \r\n\r\n- The roasted duck didn't have enough flavors. \r\n\r\n- Mango pudding... It tasted like it was made with those instant-pudding mixes. I expected chunks of mango in creamy pudding but it tasted like artificially flavored mango mousse. \r\n\r\nIt was a pretty interesting experience here.

Pretty high BUT the food was yum and i dont think i complained about anything we had.  One dumpling was slightly greasy but one out of the (what seemed like)15 we had.. not bad at all\n\n\nParking:  doood.. do i really need to say anything about the parking in SF?  Theres a parking lot downstairs but that gets filled up pretty quickly, i had to show some major clevage to the attendee to grab a parking spot that isnt typically used for customers\n\nWould I Come Back:  helllllllz to the yea!\n\n\ndid i miss anything?:  All in all, i dug it pretty hardcore, im trying to arrange a time to bring new people here, the fact that its only a short stroll from the embarcadero adds to its charm, because we SERIOUSLY had to go for a walk after that 3 hour meal.", "author": "Brendalynn K."}

Better.\n\nThere are much better places for Dim Sum, such as Ton Kiang, but 40 minutes on the 38 Geary is just too darn long of a trip when you just want a quick couple of dumplings and some buns. So, the premium price equates to a penalty for lazyness. No consistency on the pricing or itemized receipt (take a hint from Tian Sing) makes me suspect that a $40 lunch for two one week costs $70 the next.\n\nOverall, the food quality is good - but not nearly as good as when they operated the Battery Street location. The Rincon facility on the weekend is just too large and impersonal. A good place to introduce visitors to Dim Sum and when someone else is paying.\n\nPS: if Ton Kiang is only two syllables instead of the three I think it is, make the last line of the haiku \"Ton Kiang?

SO, I'm confident in saying that I'm pretty experienced. With that said, I really don't understand what the hoopla is all about when people talk about this place. There are a couple dishes that they do well, but overall, they are pretty darn average. The only level on which I'd rate them super high is customer service - very polite and attentive and everyone speaks great English. You don't get that in most dim sum places and I appreciate it. However, the food itself is pretty ok and it IS horrendously expensive...really really expensive for what you're getting. \n\nI go back cause my boyfriend (now fiance) likes their crab claw and a couple other dishes. Personally, I'd be quite content if I never ate there again - I can't say there's one dish I\"d miss. I'm not saying I've had a bad experience, just not good enough to justify the cost. And just for the record, I've been there about 7 times now so it's not like I'm dinging them based on one trip - I really wanted it to be great since everyone seems to be enamored by this place!!!", "author": "Kat J."}

Seriously!\n\nNever in the Bay Area have I had these dumplings made so perfectly.  The wrap was super thin, but enough to hold the piping hot soup inside.   Added with the traditional red vinegar and ginger dip, these dumplings were reminiscent of the ones I once had in Hong Kong.  \n\nThe rest of the dim sum is also pretty good (though I won't boast for them as much as I did with the dumplings above).  The jellyfish was one to note, not overly-oiled or any hints of a fishy taste.  The dim sum options, however, were a bit strange in my opinion.  Some dishes cater to a more American taste - I mean, when you offer salad plates and orange jello as part of your menu, you can't expect to be called completely traditional.   However, Yank Sink still provided the traditional plates and offered more than just fried foods (which some places distastefully do).\n\nThe service is extremely organized, though sometimes you may have to wait a little (**I say this admitting I went on Father's Day - does that change anything?  I don't know)  If you ask any server for a certain dish, they speak into their walkie-talkie/microphones and call up THE server  who is pushing the cart with said dish and they magically appear.  I've never seen that type of system anywhere else and was quite impressed.  The manager even came by and spoke to us at the end of meal.  Not bad =P\n\nThe scrumptious food was complemented by a huge glass roof ceiling with a water pump.  Essentially, if you look upward towards the ceiling, you see the sky and a waterfall going towards the ground, with water returning into the system through a circular canal in the floor.  That was probably not the best description ever, but that's the best I could do.  In any case, I liked it.\n\nThe one warning I have to future patrons is parking.  If you hit a busy day, the parking lot (which Yank Sing validates for) will be full and you will have to circle around the blocks for a street space.  Not the great nuisance, but when you're pushed for time, you still get stressed and yell at cars that speed up from a block away and steal the space you eyed at the traffic light (...stupid bmw...)", "author": "Bernadette C."}

Maybe it was lingering effects of last-night's punch.\n\nWe made our way to the entrance, were greeted by two friendly women dressed in traditional (I'm assuming) gowns, and were seated promptly.  There is plenty of seating, but from prior experience, there can sometimes be a brief wait.\n\nOnce seated, several servers, pushing carts towering with steaming baskets of dim sum, converged on our table.  Within minutes we were dining on an array of dumplings such as Shanghi Pork Dumplings, and my favorite, Shu Mai: meat and broth encased in a wonton skin. You have to eat it whole; when you bight into it your mouth is filled with savory-sweet goodness.  We also indulged on steamed BBQ-pork buns, pork short ribs, and crunchy spring roles.\n\nOur head waiter, Ed, was professional, charming, and witty.  He took our drink order, three Tsingtaos and a Bloody Mary, as we selected our dishes and had returned with them by the time the first dumplings hit our lips.  We joked with him about joining us for a beer; he laughed with us and replied, \"Oh, how I wish I could\" - or something to that effect.\n\nThe restaurant is very open, clean, and busy.  The high-level of activity makes it a perfect place for large groups, families with kids, or three friends reminiscing about the events of the prior evening.

The Charming Boyfriend picked me up for lunch, and when we passed by Yank Sing on our way to another lunch spot, we decided to give it a try.  He'd never been there before; I had but on someone else's bill.  ;)  So I didn't know how excessively expensive it was!\n\nWe enjoyed steamed shrimp dumplings, pot stickers, the sea bass special, and he seemed to really like the pork buns.  Since dim sum is comprised of little treats, you have to eat a lot to fill up.  Consequently, the Charming Boyfriend requested an order of chicken chow mein, which was adequately tasteful, reminiscent of Chinese buffet chow mein.  They definitely are a dim sum restaurant, so stick to that!\n\nWhen the bill came (a whopping $70, and written all in Chinese so we didn't know how much we'd been charged for what) we realized how naive we'd been, not ever asking how much an item cost.  And the sales routine is heavy-handed, with servers practically deciding for you that you want whatever mystery lies in that steam basket before you can even ask what it is.  \n\nThe food is okay; but it's very overpriced for what it is.  So if you go, go for dinner (who pays $70 for a lunch of dumplings and chow mein?), ask how much things are upfront, don't let them put things on your table unless you really want it, and either expect to leave with an empty stomach or an empty wallet.", "author": "akimbo j."}

With all the reviews here, a lot's already been said, but here's my two cents:\n\n(1) Yank Sing 2 Go is as good as eat-in.\n\n(2) They validate parking and you can park under the building (Zang!).  So you could, for example, eat dim sum, get validated (notice my clever use of layered meaning here), then walk on over to the Ferry Building for the farmer's market, come back to your car, and drive home with free parking.\n\n(3) I prefer eating by the cool rain fountain in the atrium to eating in the restaurant - it's less crowded and more relaxed as a result\n\n(4) The only thing I'm not crazy about is the peking duck.  Not because it's not good (it is), but because the portions are small - they sell by the slice, for goodness' sake - and so your value proposition is pretty grim.\n\nOther than that, I've got nothing but praise.

What stinks the most at chinese restaurants would be the service but not at this one.

But really, the food doesn't taste good. Their dumplings fall right out from the skin which is not a good thing. It means they need work. The peking duck doesn't have enough flavor. The sticky rice in lotus leaf is made all wrong. That's not even the real thing. They made it their way which some people may like but I like to eat the real thing. All they have in there is meat! I see no chinese mushrooms, chinese sausage, or the egg yolk thingy. \n\nThe one thing I do like would be there coconut creme roll. That is something that is hard to find elsewhere and it's pretty good here. Their egg custards are also worth mentioning because they are not as mini as other dim sum restaurants.

The baked pork buns were featured on Food Network Show, Best Thing I Ever Ate - soft doughy balls filled with sweet juicy BBQ pork.  The dumplings are perfect. The snow pea shoot dumpling as well as the spinach dumpling reaches a height of flavor that is amazingly accomplished with a lack of meat.  The Shanghai dumpling which has a pork mixture does not have that strong pork flavor.  There are others such as the lobster dumpling, goldfish dumpling (has shrimp, not what the name implies -  it is shaped like a goldfish.  But the chicken feet are literally chicken feet).  The stuffed crab claws are tasty and not greasy.

The quality of the special dishes is great. The deep fried crab claws are large and full of meat. The Peking duck is very nicely done with a morsel of duck meat and a slab of very crisp skin along with a freshly steamed mantoh. The egg tarts are to die for, with a barely there but oh-so-flaky crust and oodles of smooth filling. \n\nThe service is excellent as well. The table next to me had just missed a cart with plates of string beans, and asked a waitress if they could just order some.

My dad and I have been having lunch at this restaurant for YEARS!  When I was a kid we'd go to the old location on Battery Street.  They've been at this location for a while now, but the food is just as delicious as ever.  One of the best things is that they're constantly putting new things on the menu, but the old favorites never seem to disappear either.  I've tried other dim sum places, and I always compare them to Yank Sing.  The best part of the meal is the black bean chili pepper sauce you can mix into the soy sauce as a dipping sauce for the dim sum.  I miss it when I go to other restaurants and highly recommend you try it!\n\nParking is easy, as they have a valet in the garage.  Just don't bring any big cars, cause the spaces are tiny!  The restaurant will validate your parking stub, so it's even free!  Can't get much better than that in the city.\n\nThe restaurant is off of a beautiful atrium in an office building, and on the weekends the tables in the atrium are used by Yank Sing.  Weekdays it's all inside, but doesn't feel cramped or anything.  No cell service, but it's rude to talk on your phone at a restaurant anyway.  One word of advice: make reservations!  As big as this place is, it is always crazy packed.\n\nMy favorite things to order: jasmine tea, shrimp dumplings, chicken and mushroom dumplings, the signature pork dumplings that come with a red vinegar sauce, chicken in lettuce cups, red cabbage salad, and either egg custard or sesame balls for dessert.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

There are many other great places in San Francisco where you can find great dim sum at an affordable price. Unfortunately, Yank Sing is not one of them.\n\nWhile Yang Sing has a great variety of dim sum options, the price for what you get is a little mind blowing. When you go to a place where an average dim sum dish costs more than $5 and goes up as high as $11, it's disappointing when the dim sum is not the best you've ever had. At most dim sum restaurants in San Francisco or throughout the Bay Area, you can expect most dishes within the price range of $2-5. At that price range, you can expect very high quality dim sum with reasonable service and hot dishes. Yang Sing costs at least twice as much and it's not worth it, even if the service is great. \n\nPros:\n- Great setting and ambience\n- Wide variety of dim sum options\n\nCons:\n- Price (Way overpriced!)\n- Small portions\n- Poor value\n\nIf you have never had dim sum and have the money to spend, go ahead and try Yank Sing. \nIf you want great dim sum but want to watch your wallet, try dim sum restaurants in the Richmond District in SF, Oakland Chinatown, Millbrae, or San Mateo . You'll be more than satisfied with your dim sum meal and service.", "author": "Chris M."}

This unfortunately is not the case.  In a lengthy discussion with one of the best Chinese chefs in the US, Joe Ng (Chinatown Brasserie, Red Farm), most of the dim sum tea houses have people working for them that are too tired to prepare the dough the way it needs to be done.  It takes strength and vigor to make dim sum skin paper thin and the stuffing either nice and tight or juicy and flavorful.\n\nYank Sing is among the best in Northern California but still falls a little short of what the ideal should be.  This is one reason for just four starts.  While time tested for many years (10+), refreshing the menu would be helpful.  It is by far better than the Chinatown tea houses and better than the over rated Koi Palace.  Once the name James Beard rolls around or Michelin, then things must be absolutely divine, which this is not.  It's good dim sum, maybe arguably very good dim sum.  But it is not great dim sum.  Have it once, and perhaps to the less traveled dim sum hobbyist, it is great.  But have it the 4th or 5th time, and things get a little tiring.  Don't get me wrong...we went their at 10am and bought some extra to take home.  Sometimes, we even travel across the bridge just to get a bite to-go or even catch some to-go before having to catch a cross country flight.  But 5 stars this is not.  It's a solid four stars.\n\nAlmost everything steamed is very good.  For health reasons, we seldom eat anything fried unless it is a must have (like Hana's tempura or age dashi tofu); however, in the past, the deep fried crab and prawn dish has been very nice to have.  The XLB is probably the best that one can get in Northern California (look out for the upcoming review on the best XLB in the country).  What's an honorable mention for Yank Sing are the other, non-traditional dim sum items available (sea bass, Peking duck, lettuce wrap chicken).  Some of these items are nice to have.  Another very nice offering is the selection of teas.\n\nOne thought for some of the other posts:  quit complaining about the cost.  You pay for what you get for.  If you're looking for high quality dim sum, it isn't going to come at a cheap price.  If you're looking for cheap and large in quantity, go to Chinatown and eat that garbage.  Remember, high quality dim sum will have translucent skin with a) lots of juice inside (like xlb), b) firm texture (like shrimp dumplings...aka ha gow), or c) lots of flavor without an msg aftertaste (like Yank Sing's pea sprout dumplings).  \n\nMy suggestion to the readers, go early and grab a table.  One of my favorite times has been to take an early morning hike and then heading over for a 10am brunch.  Good times.  Good restaurant.  Good eats.\n\nH", "author": "Heathcliff D."}

They also have a Chilean Sea Bass plate that is like nothing I have ever tasted - it is AMAZING and melts in your mouth!

I often dim sum in Monterey Park and this is on the higher end of the quality scale. It is a bit on the pricey side but I thought it was worth it.\nUpon leaving, the car garage is very confusing. You also have to park in 90 degree formats. Make sure you get a spot that you can easily move out  afterwards. I scratched my car from a short turn radius on the curb.

Although we ordered maybe fifteen minutes since our seating, I didn't get my much needed water for another fifteen minutes. The soft drinks came relatively quicker though. Secondly, you don't know what the prices of the items are. We just pretended we were stamp collectors on our ticket thing but we were absolutely surprised our meal cost $400!!! The duck alone was $107 for 24 pieces. \n\nThe food is great. I really like the shanghai dumplings which is won ton soup in a dumpling! I was really surprised how they did that. The crab claws (which my friend is peer pressuring me to write about) were pretty innovative. It was shredded shrimp wrapped around an open crab claw and then breaded. Nicely executed. On the same note, the orange jello was just as impressive. Basically on real orange peels they had orange Jell-o shaped as if when we cut the orange into slices it wasn't filled with the flesh of an orange, but bright orange Jell-o! The expensive duck was good, too. I am not sure if you could eat the paper on the bottom of the duck bun, but if you can't I would prefer to have it taken off before serving it. Also, the sticky rice was soft and gooey like I like it! \n\nThe Rincon center is a nice place and I hear it functions as a food court when Yank Sing doesn't take over the whole central atrium on weekends. There is also this cool rain water fall coming from the ceiling. You can totally imagine Britney Spears performing in the center, dancing it the water, whipping her hair around. \n\nAnyway, super surprised when we got the bill. I wish we got to see a menu beforehand. At least I would be able to learn the names of things, too. All in all, very good dim sum, in a crowded place as is expected. Not a cheap thrill.

And boy do they push these dishes hard!  The lady with the miso glazed sea bass pushed the dish like she was getting commission (hey, maybe she was).  It is strange for me to see miso sea bass and chicken satay at a dim sum hall.", "author": "Dana H."}

I know, it's very polished and cleaned up and caters as much to Chinese people as it does to the \"gweilos,\" but the food was very good.\n\nUsually the true test dish of a dim sum place is Xiao Long Bao - the steamed Shanghainese pork dumplings.  These bite sized morsels need to be served hot, with skin that's not so thin or overcooked that it \"breaks\" if you pick it up, but not so thick that it requires extra chewing.  Ideally, you want it so that you can see the sack barely holding the juice in and the thing pops and then melts in your mouth.  Yank Sing xiao long bao met the test and passed, squirting pork juice and all.\n\nChar Siu Bao and Har Gow were also quite good, though I felt the Shumai was only so-so.  Loved the sweet tofu dessert with a hint of ginger - very refreshing and soothing.\n\nThe bill was surprisingly expensive.  I guess they gotta pay for that real estate.

I have been to many Dim Sum restaurants in my life, and Yank Sing has their method down better than anyone! No matter how busy they are, the food is constantly coming out of the kitchen and you rarely go more than a few minutes without some cart coming up to you with different selections to choose from. Or, one of the best things about Yank Sing is that if you don' t see what you want you just have to tell whoever you see and they will relay your order back to the kitchen. Many of the staff members, servers, and managers walking around have radio's that they can talk to each other and facilitate your order for you. It is an incredibly efficient system!\n\nAgain, I have had Dim Sum at many, many places and Yank Sing definitely ranks #1 to me. Yes, you can find cheaper in the city.

After taking the water taxi over from Jack London Square, we started our day with a little dim sum at Yank Sing. Wifey and I used to eat here all the time when we lived in the Bay and we've had a hankering for it ever since. They did not disappoint. The carts were whirlin' around the place servin' up tasty morsels. We lucked up and walked in right before the crowd so we sat immediately.  While our table was right at the entrance, it was still in the courtyard and the natural light and falling water make for great views/atmosphere. The staff was great with the kids and made sure we got everything we wanted and more. This was the first time the kids had Dim Sum and now they, too are hooked. \nI don't know if we just missed the place too much or what, but this place rocks.", "author": "kyle d."}

They offer all sorts of dim sum dishes that you won't see in typical Chinese restaurants, and the items that are familiar to you will likely have an American twist to them.  You'd think this would be a bad thing, but it's actually amazingly delicious!! It is, however, also amazingly expensive.  A meal with 3 of your friends could easily get up to $100+.  If you can't handle paying that much for dim sum, don't come here.  But if you're looking for something interesting and different, and all that money is weighing you down, you should definitely come here!!\n\nThis is definitely a place worth trying at LEAST once.\n\nAnd if you're looking to have a wedding here, they have four different set menus to pick from, and are fairly flexible about substitutions.", "author": "Mikolo R."}

I treated some out of towners to lunch here because I've been wanting to try YS for a while, and figured it's cleaner and is more aesthetically pleasing than most dim sum places.  Service was very good but the prices are absolutely ridiculous! Lunch for the three of us was $100 with tip, and when I returned to the office I realized I was still hungry.  We ordered the usual dumplings but I found the sauces on lots of the items to be too sweet. My favorite item was probably the soup dumplings, which was surprising to see on the menu because dim sum places don't usually have them.  The chicken feet were disappointing, and overall I found the portions to be tiny (for example they have a roast duck item but if you order one serving you get a small dumpling with duck meat in it - not a plate of duck!). I wouldn't come back here again as there's so many other good dim sum places in the Bay Area that are more reasonaby priced, like Koi Palace/Garden and Mayflower.", "author": "Bella L."}

The baked pork buns were mentioned so we decided to go.  \n\nWe got there around 11:15 and we were seated right away.  Food carts started rolling to us as soon as we were seated. Everything was so delicious and we were really enjoying the food...until my son saw hair (almost like a baby's hair) embedded on top of a dumpling he was about to eat. GROSS! so I told one of the waiters right away and my first thought was he would probably just take it and ignore it altogether. Boy was I wrong...he told his manager and he apologized and replaced the order right away! Now that's what I call service! Yes we found hair but I'm sure every restaurant has those. It's how they took care of the incident is what impressed me!  So everything was fine and we continued to enjoy our lunch. All the waiters and ladies pushing the carts were very friendly. If we didn't see a certain dumpling that we wanted they call each other thru their headsets and within seconds, they're there for you. \n\nThe baked Pork Bun was okay...nothing to really rave about.  I would say the best thing I ever ate is their fried soft shell crab!!! It's the bomb! It was my favorite back then and it still is!!!  \n\nSo, for the 4 of us (my kids 10 & 14) plus hubby...the bill came out to $76.00...not bad! We satisfied our craving for great dim sum.

We marveled and cooed as we gorged on the signature Shanghai Dumplings (xiao long bao) and sat back amazed at the various dishes that were being pumped out of the kitchen. We ordered a whole mess of stuff and out of all of them my parents were somewhat disappointed in only two: the chinese broccoli and the chicken feet. Both a bit skimpy on the portion especially the broccoli. They thought the chicken feet lacked flavor, I for one don't do feet so defer to them for the thumbs up or down.\n\nWe took a leisurely approach to the meal starting around 10:30 and leaving around 12:30. The place was packed by the time we left, so good thing we got there early. Not even a faulty fire alarm during our meal was enough to drive us or other diners from their food. \n\nWhich is saying a lot especially when you get the bill. My parents pretty much gasped but quickly rationalized the price with their sated appetite and overall enjoyment. That soon didn't last as they then launched into immediate mathematical calculations and comparisons of other dim sum places in Vegas and Ocean Star in L.A.

Other places the dim sum ladies would glare at you and give you the stink eye if you were to be so bold as to decline their offerings.  Not here...I suppose they probably get a verbal brow beating from the manager if that was the case.  The place could use a little sprucing up though...it's starting to show it's age.  That's always the case with Chinese restaurant...no upkeep whatsoever.   I guess the only drawback (and why Wifey and I are not here on a regular basis) is the price.

We found this place by accident, we parked in the basement of this building. We saw a lot of people waiting, and since it's almost lunch time, we decided to give it a try. \n\nAt first I was very impressed with their tea & teapot. It's very good quality, but of course you have to pay for it, later on I found they charged almost $10 for the tea for 4 people ( 2 adult & 2 kids). The food was good quality, the place was clean and the service was ok but I was so shocked when I saw the bill. It was almost $80. We did not ordered a lot since we all had some breakfast. (If we ordered like what we usually do, I believe it would be easily over $120.) We go out for dim sum quite a lot. And I've never had such a huge bill for dim sum. \n\nI would give the food a 4 star but the price would be a 1 star, so average 3 star.", "author": "Pearl K."}

We had the shrimp dumplings, the spinach and the mushroom dumplings, vegetarian rolls, steamed pork buns, potstickers, soup dumplings (incredible!), stir fried snap peas, spring rolls, sesame balls and mango pudding....to name a few.  The space is large and a little noisy (unless you request the carpeted dining room); but with the enormous glass ceiling to floor waterfall, it really is a fun spot!

I think it's one of their more expensive items -about $12 for six.\n\nThe shrimp dumpling was delicious - large chunks of shrimp and it tasted fresh.\n\nThe sweet rice in lotus leaf was so good that we had to order more.  Ratio of stuffing to rice was excellent.  The sauce was flavorful.  This is a typical dish my parents order for every dim sum outing and even they said it's the best they've had in SF.\n\nThe jook with thousand year egg and pan fried chicken bun were good. \n\nFried crab claw was okay; nothing memorable.  It's about $12 for two claws. \n\nNot so good:  spinach dumpling, mushroom dumpling, and beef rice roll.  Definitely not a fan of the spinach though the mushroom was okay. The beef rice roll as okay too, just didn't have much flavor.\n\nI must say, this is THE most expensive dim sum I've had for standard items.  $40/person.

Yeah, some of you say, same plate and quality but a higher price tag. Well to a novice, the food was enjoyable, and after all, the company is what matters the most, right ?\n\nSo, we initially sit and chat to catch up while we let the green tea brew and simmer in the presentable glass pot. Pauline says we should have tea first and then we'll proceed to eat at our hearts desire. So while sis and Pauline speak, I look about at all the variety of Dim Sum items being thrown about, well not literally but, you get what i mean. Pauline just keep deflecting attempts of cart pushers pimping out noodle wrapped goodness. It was like she was the gate keeper and these carts weren't quite yet invited to our tea party.\n\nSo after a few minutes of talk and tea sipping, (which was an eternity for me) she let's the first barrage of items through.\n\nBAM(catapult sound, 1st volley) \n- Steamed BBQ Pork Buns\n- Shrimp Dumplings\n- Pork & Shrimp Siu Mye\n\nThe words of my eloquent friend Rick W. echoed in me head, \"Wow....wow, woooow\"\n\n - The Buns, just tore apart and offered a savory tasting of sweetened Pork. \n - The Shrimp was just a straight, no B.S. ball of ground shrimp, no joke, all business. Beyond satisfying, I tell ya.\n - The P & S Siu Mye was a piece of heaven sent via a thin noodle scroll ala Ten Commandments.\n\nBOOM (2nd volley)\n- Seu Lung Pau\n- Seaweed wrapped fried Tofu w/ chives (no direct name, so I'm told)\n- Sea Bass\n\n - The S.L. Pau was interesting...I busted my first one, it was left for dead with all it's liquids left unappreciated at the bottom of the basket. But my 2nd attempt was a success ! Paired with ginger sauce that just accentuated all the inner savoriness. We had 2 servings of this, btw. \n - The Seaweed Tofu was a crunchy surprise that actually tasted like, meat. It was definitely a welcome change to the pallet. \n - The Sea Bass was braised in a sauce that I couldn't really I.D. It was a little salty that gave way to rich sweetness. The piece of steamed fish was beyond tender and paired well with the sauce. \n\nAs we were beginning to feel the end of the battle was at hand and it seemed that victory was in reach. Reinforcements came.\n\nWHACK (3rd volley)\n- Stuffed Crab Claw\n- Lotus Leave Steamed Rice\n- Sesame Balls\n- Custard Tarts\n- Sweet Buns\n\n - The Stuffed Claw caught my eye a few rounds ago, and I was able to snatch it this time around. Honestly, it was one of the better things I had this afternoon. I was seriously enjoying everything, but this was one of the highlights ! The combination of fried ground crab and shrimp was popping with flavor. That, paired with the red sweet and sour sauce has permanently etched a wrinkle in me brain for further longing in the future.\n - The Steamed rice was a nice compliment to the previous tastings. The rice was infused with pork in a great sauce. \n - Sesame Balls seemed to be what my sister was waiting for. Yes, it was good but didn't really float my boat.\n - The Custard Tarts, on the other hand, had me at hello. I got my first piece and quickly jumped on my second in no time. Mrs. Pauline saw my eagerness for them and offered this advise, \"Stop b.s.'n with the tart, and go for what's important, THE CUSTARD !!\" Oooooh yeeeeeah, right on, thanks....slurrrrrp. \n - The Sweet Buns were alright, she never called back or answered my texts (shoulder shrug)\n\nI have to say my first outing at Deem Sum was a success ! I thoroughly enjoyed the outing, the food, and the company. I do hope that my follow up visit at other spots stay the course and keep me happy and longing for these little surprises in wicker baskets.

Dim sum is a contact sport that's always better with a large group, both because its more fun and you can sample a wider variety of dim sum.  Yank Sing has a perfect formula, serving delicious varieties while the carts, servers, and host negotiate their way between the tightly packed tables in a well-choreographed dance.\n\nThe setting is, well to me, kind of odd.  The restaurant has a space at the ground floor of a building in the financial district, but their tables also fill the center courtyard.  The courtyard is dominated by a huge fountain which is pretty but still there's something about it that feels exposed.\n\nThe dim sum though is delicious.  Whenever we get dim sum my friends and I always find ourselves scoping out the carts, trying to figure out what they have before they hit our table so we can agree on just how much we want to get.  Definitely order more than you think at each pass, you'll never know when that dim sum is going to get back into rotation.  That does however assure you that everything is fresh.  Do be prepared to be there a while so leave yourself a cushion of time if you have plans afterwards.\n\nMy favorites are the xiao long bao, char siu bao, shrimp har gow, shrimp and scallop dumplings, and peking duck.  Peking duck in individual dim sum servings?  Yes, please!! I ask them to slather it with more hoisin sauce and extra green onions and oh that tidbit of food with the crisp duck skin, lush duck meat, and tang from the sauce and onions is a little piece of heaven.  \n\nYank Sing is on the higher end of the price range for dim sum and I hate how I never really know how much I'm paying until the end especially since with dim sum you do tend to order with your eyes versus your stomach.  I think the price tag is worth it though for the clean digs, decent service, and delicious food.  It looks like there's a take-out service they do next door, next time I may just get the dim sum to go and save the hassle of waiting and the price tag mystery.  Somehow though I think it would cheapen the whole dim sum experience though because the carts and anticipation waiting for them is what dim sum's all about.", "author": "C C."}

I had mine in the restaurant space for 100 people and it was great.  I had considered R&G because of the food but I'm SO glad I went with Yank Sing.  It was much prettier inside and Vera was great to work with.  The wedding reception went off without a hitch and my guests commented how good the food was (and how much there was).  I did the traditional 10 course Chinese banquet.  They don't normally serve dinner here so I highly recommend the trial tasting so that you know what you're going to get.  I also think the inside space can be decorated well and for anyone who is considering this place, it's a great option if you don't like the Atrium.

Not everything is available during the weekday; we asked for Chinese congee and we were told that it is only available during the weekend.

I went recently for lunch one Friday; had the shrimp dumplings, the pork soup dumplings, the lotus-wrapped sticky rice. What I did not expect was getting violently ill a couple of hours after eating. In fact, I got so sick that I had to go straight home, leaving most of my personal belongings at work. \n\nWhat I expected even less, though, was the reaction of the restaurant. I called and spoke to the manager. Instead of getting an apology, or a refund for the meal - which most restaurants at this price point readily offer - he repeatedly asked me to supply a doctor's note. I expressed that I was very disappointed in the restaurant, and he passed my note on to someone in the corporate office, who did leave me a voicemail but was never available when I tried to call back.\n\nAsking me to provide a doctor's note after I literally had to run out of the office hoping not to be seen by any of my coworkers was adding insult to injury. Did Yank Sing really think I would make such a story up, so that I could miss meetings and find myself in a potentially embarrassing situation at work?\n\nEvery other restaurant would offer at least an apology and offer of refund. As I see it, they can keep the $48, but they have lost me as a customer.", "author": "A W."}

They are definitely way more expensive than anywhere you could possibly go in Chinatown. They're also way cleaner and more polite than anywhere in Chinatown. If you want to keep an eye on how much you're spending, take a gander at the menu list. There are items that are actually quite reasonable, and others that are ridiculous. I don't get why people are complaining about the carts coming around as soon as you sit down. This happens at every dim sum restaurant. It's like a bakery. They don't wait for you to come and THEN bake your food. Regardless, none of my food was cold.\n\nPark in the garage--they validate: $4 off the first 2 hours. We weren't there for more than an hour so parking was free for us.\n\nBottom line:  If you can deal with loud pushy people, go to Chinatown and get some really delicious, cheap and authentic dim sum.

The XLBs are out of this world.\n\nThe other dim sum choices were just as phenomenal.  I'll be honest - I'm the type that keeps ordering the same thing everywhere.  So it doesn't matter if I go to the upscale Yank Sing or the ghettolicious Wing Lee Bakery in Inner Richmond, I would end up ordering the same thing: Lo Mai Kai (sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf), Phai Quat (steamed pork spare ribs), Char Siew Paw (bbq pork buns), deep fried crab claws, and sweet tofu dessert.  \n\nThe distinguishing factor was the quality of the food and service - everyone that thinks that they need to put up with rude non-English speaking waiters and two-hour wait to have quality dim sum can all go to  Koi Palace and fight it out.

As we were waiting for carts to come by our table, which there was only 2 carts that were parked at the entrance to the kitchen..It appeared we got whatever was leftover, However, we did noticed all this food being brought out to a table where all the servers were sitting down to.  As we waited for 20 minutes for a different cart we had to just flat out ask a server that was walking by for at least some rice.  The server blurted out we have no rice.  Kitchen closed. (mind you there was a HUGE pot of rice sitting on the servers table) so here we were...eating 2 plates of OVERPRICED dim sum (we found that out after we paid our bill, because you don't get to see the prices as your are ordering.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-04", "description": "After reading several reviews about this place, I decided it was time to finally dip into some dim sum. In fact, it was my first dim sum experience and I'm not sure how I will keep from becoming addicted. It was, in short: fabulous. \nI tentatively made reservations for New Year's Day and naturally, I was concerned that the already high noise level would be beyond tolerable or that the carts would just roll past us-- onto tables with customers buying the more expensive items (yes, prices do vary significantly). Yes, it was noisy-- think large wedding party...that's how loud-- but as soon as you have your first bite, you'll forget all about the decibel rating.\nUpon entering, I immediately notified the host that one of us was a vegan and this seemed to help things along quite a bit. Even when our plates were empty, I could grab just about anyone in uniform to send us the vegetarian carts. These folks are ready for busy and they are as attentive as can be-- possibly more so than waiters at a conventional restaurant. The amount of organization and coordination that a large business like this requires will leave you dumbfounded. Certainly, the walkie-talkies help them pull it off!  \nThe variety was almost overwhelming at times but the mystery of the items you didn't have a chance to throw down will keep you coming back. I was surprised that the wait staff gladly stopped in their tracks to point things out and explain them to us. All it took was a glance in their direction and they were at table-side. Turning things down didn't seem to wipe the genuinely warm smile from their faces. Okay, so their ability to speak English was a bit on the challenged side-- but they more than made up for it with efficiency, expedience, and above all, friendliness. Despite the hustle and bustle and being against a back wall, we were content with our glass pot of tea-- which never went dry or cold. \nOf course, given the expense of this place, you will need to keep an eye on the card they set on the table. It will be difficult, I assure you. Without a doubt, you'll find yourself saying, \"Wait! What's that? Okay, I'll try it. One more...okay two more\"...and by the time you know it, you've racked up a 100+ dollar bill. \nThe only bit of advice I have is to fill those empty belly gaps with lots of hot tea and don't take any long breaks in between plates-- after all, the longer you wait, the more tempting the unknown or old favorites start to look. \nBon appetit! Oh, wait, that's French. I'll work on my Mandarin for the next dim sum review...although, I really don't see a reason to look any further.", "author": "OKAY O."}

When she left, we started working with Vera instead, and it was such a breath of fresh air.  Vera was prompt in responses, was very warm, and gave great suggestions and advice in assisting us with our planning.  Vera communicated with us in detail, and kept us in the loop as our day got closer.\n\nThe servers were very polite and on par with what we have experienced as guests at previous weddings.  Our guests were impressed at the level of service that Yank Sing provides, and the comfortable feel of the Atrium.  (We had an inkling that this would not be the case inside other restaurants that are known for high table turnovers)\n\nIf you book at Yank Sing for your banquet, you are allowed 1 full tasting.  What this means is that they serve you all 8 courses, with enough to feed 10 people.  This was an awesome experience, as you can bring your families out to have a trial run at the food you will NOT be eating during your wedding (yes, as much of a wannabe food snob and glutton that I am, I had no appetite for food on the wedding day.)  \n\nI have 2 complaints about Yank Sing (although a lot more could have gone wrong!):\n1) The Peking Duck on our wedding day was soggy, which was a vast difference from the crispy duck we tried at our tasting.  Sure, there were ~30 tables to cook for, but those that know, Peking duck is absolutely disgusting when soggy!\n\n2) The Veuve Cliquot champagne that we had put aside for our cake/champagne popping was there, but once we poured out our half glasses, the champagne was nowhere to be found!!  We only hope that a saavy underage cousin or alcoholic friend was able to enjoy the bubbly.\n\nMake no mistake about it, you will definitely pay a premium to have a wedding banquet here.  If you are looking for a nice atmosphere feel, consider the Atrium.  And if you are looking for higher quality Chinese banquet food, this is definitely a great place that you should consider.  We ended up shelling out an arm, a leg, and a kidney or two for this place, but we have absolutely no regrets, as our wedding pictures looked spectacular with the Atrium surroundings and lighting.  The food and overall feel made our dinner such a better experience for our special day.  Much, much better than being cooped up in an inside restaurant venue with too many poles and beams in the way.", "author": "Pick S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-26", "description": "We have enjoyed the dim sum here for lunch a few times and this week we were in the mood for something different than our usual lunch spots.\nLet me start with 2 notes:\nFor those that say the restaurant is pricey, you know that before you go if you look at the reviews/menus online. And you are in SF...this isn't Panda Express.\nService being aggressive....the dim sum service ( or service in any traditional Chinese restaurant)..can be aggressive...there are millions of mouths to feed in that country.  But service can be aggressive anywhere. You have a mouth, speak up and politely slow down the service if you want to relax and dine at a leisurely pace.\n\nWe enjoyed the ha gau (shrimp dumplings....2 orders) as we always do. Huge, suculent portions of shrimp lightly seasoned in a paper thin wrapper served steaming hot. The seafood basil dumplings not quite as good a bit bland.  The sea bass in honey soy sauce was outstanding..a huge, flakey, moist chuck of pure white sea bass in a very light honey soy sauce. Nothing masked the delicious flavor of the fish. Our favorite dish of the afternoon. My husband enjoyed the Peking duck....me not. Hence, 1 star off for the duck....my opinion and taste buds. The only Peking duck on earth I have ever loved and devoured was in Beijing. I felt this was gamey and a bit greasy, yet overcooked and the buns were dry and flavorless. However, eggplant being one of my very favorite veggies...the eggplant with hunan sauce was excellent. Not sweet or cloying, not processed blood red sauce, light, nicely dressed and steaming hot, fresh made and brought to the table. Definitely enough food for a satisfying lunch. Agreement on the tea pot.....puddles are formed on the table at each pouring, but the tea is very tasty. The table cloth and napkins also concur with regard to the tea.\n\nParking is not easy anywhere in SF, a part of the dining adventure. A cheap eat, not, but how often do you wake up and say....let's have good dim sum....not every day or even every week. So when you have the craving, need your dim sum fix, this is an excellent place to satisfy the palate in a nice room with efficient and pleasant service.

Expect an update focused on the menu items eventually. First, I will state that the first time it was a banquet and the menu was preselected by the hosts. Therefore I cannot offer an opinion on their dim sum, etc.  However, I will say that it was a five star experience. The one and only five star experience I've had in a Chinese-American restaurant. The waitstaff was extremely attentive. They circulated through the crowd and kept our wine glasses full without having to flag them down. The food was not the greasy American Chow Mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour stuff that many people think represents Chinese food but in actuality was invented by cooks in mining camps during gold rush days as a way to get rid of garbage. The food was exquisite and served with flair. We were refreshed with clean plates between courses and the next course wasn't presented until the waiter had asked us if we were ready. That was the key to the service -- the wait staff never dumped a plate and walked off. They brought it fresh from the kitchen when we were ready. The portions weren't so huge that takeout boxes were left at the table. If we had extra, the waiter, after asking if we'd like to take it home, carried it off and packed it up for us. Ambiance was great; facilities were great;. parking and the Embarcadero BART station were close and convenient. I do know that  it's expensive -- the most expensive Chinese restaurant I've ever been too anywhere in the world but as the old saying goes: You get what you pay for.  I did bring some out of town guests here once to \"show off\" and they weren't  disappointed.  I'll do a review of their specific menu items the next time I eat here (provided I can increase my home equity line and can afford it).

While the food is still really good, the service is inconsistent. Maybe this is because they are so popular, and can churn and burn through so many customers, service is not a priority. I'm not naive, I don't expect stellar service, especially at dim sum....but I do expect the trolleys to come by at least more than once every 10 minutes. \n\nOur experience today:\n\nWent late to Yank Sing (1:30 pm) when dim sum service was winding down (yes, yes, I know, not the best time to go). We were seated on the far side of the atrium,  which I generally don't mind. Problem was, most of the people in our section were finishing up their meals, so the trolley servers just decided that our lone table wasn't worth carting their goods over to. To our waitress' credit she kept asking us what we'd like to have and getting it for us, while also telling us that she kept telling them to come over, but they wouldn't do it. The thing is, I wanted to see the food on the trolley and choose my dim sum, dammit, not wait for her to return every 5 minutes and take our next dim sum order. I was hungry, I wanted to spend money and I was not happy. I've never had this problem there and so 30 minutes into our lunch, when I demanded to be moved to another section, the trolleys finally started appearing en masse. \n\nThe icing on the cake was the broiled fish we requested when we were initially seated. We kept being told by our server that it was coming and that the kitchen was preparing it special for us since they had already run out for the day. 30 minutes later, no broiled fish. 45 minutes later, no broiled fish. Exactly 1 hour later, with the check paid, doggie bag in tow and walking out the door,  the broiled fish arrived.  Too late. 5 stars for the killer dim sum.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-07-24", "description": "I love the idea of Dim Sum: small plates of food so you can try a variety of different dishes, the ability to see what you're getting before you order it, plus just the experience of food drifting by and having the option of pointing to it, asking for it and eating it within seconds. The only problem is that I don't eat seafood or fish of any kind (I'm not allergic, but I just don't like it) and at most dim sum places I've been to that makes it hard to enjoy my meal. I've been to several dim sum places around the bay area and Yank Sing is by far my favorite. With other dim sum places I've tried, there would only be 2 or 3 non-dessert items that I could even eat, and while I could see that my seafood-loving dining companions were enjoying themselves, the quality of the dishes I got was mediocre.\n\nYank Sing is the only dim sum place I've found (in the bay area) that has a terrific selection of creative dishes that don't have seafood (there are good vegetarian options also). For this I am happy to pay more, and I usually do, because Yank Sing can get expensive: For a full dim sum lunch we usually pay about $20 a person and sometimes more. The bill is in Chinese so unless you can read Chinese you won't be able to figure out which items cost what, which can be confusing. Most of the regular items cost between $2.50 and $4 but some specials (xiao long bao for example) can cost $6-7. Also, sometimes you will ask for an item from a cart and they'll hand you the plate but what they don't tell you is that what they've given you is actually a \"double order\" (this almost always happens with spring rolls) so you're actually charged twice as much as a regular item. If you like Yank Sing but think it's too expensive the best thing to do is decide in advance what you want to get  and stick to it - avoid impulse shopping! Another way to enjoy Yank Sing food on the cheap is the Yank Sing 2 Go lunch specials on weekdays.\n\nMy absolute favorite here are the chicken mushroom dumplings - they have perfect translucent wrappers and a delicious filling (water chestnuts and snow peas giving it a slight crunch). Other favorites include green onion cakes with peanut sauce, xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings, which i think of as 'the ship in a bottle of chinese cooking'), sweet rice dumplings, shitake mushroom dumplings, spring rolls and pork buns. They serve Peking Duck by the slice, which is a nice way to try it. They have a lot of dessert choices - the coconut rolls are great. I've also enjoyed the custard tarts and sesame balls.

It's a fine place to have a quick lunch, but going there on a weekend is a real downer, in the same way that the downtowns of large American cities are a drag: devoid of human activity, they feel empty and heartless, and there's no question they are ugly. In terms of ambience, eating at Yank Sing is like eating at a shopping mall - that is, one that has no actual shops to shop at. We had ample time to experience this, too, since had reservations for 11:30 and weren't seated til 12:10, a situation that we found especially frustrating since there were TONS of empty tables in front of our noses.  The food was only moderately good, they dumped all the dishes on our table in our first ten minutes (as if to get rid of us), and to top it all off, it was wildly overpriced: my friends and I spent $160 for a totally normal amount of dishes. Since Chinatown is relatively close, I would HIGHLY recommend skipping this dum sum (sic) experience.", "author": "Gina A."}

There is a second, smaller location on Stevenson Street which I prefer to go to on weekends.\n\nFood:  3 stars.  My friend and I tried a ton of dim sum (about $85 worth).  We had the pork sui mye, shrimp dumplings, spinach dumplings, peking duck, Shanghai dumplings, Mandarin dumplings wih chives, crab dumplings, honey-glazed sea bass, crab cakes, sesame balls, and custard tarts.  Although there are some interesting, creative items to choose from, the standard fare (shrimp dumplings, pork sui mye, Mandarin dumplings with chives) were nothing special.  The highlight is the Shanghai dumplings.  You get about 7-8 dumplings served piping hot in a bamboo basket.   After letting them cool down for a bit, put one in your spoon, pour some vinegar on top, and let the rich flavors explode in your mouth.  The peking duck is also amazing.  Although the portions are small, there is absolutely no fat in the duck meat.  Make sure to add a lot of hoisin sauce to the bun and eat it all like a sandwich.  Worst of the bunch were the crab cakes, which had a slightly hard exterior and just no oomph in the flavor.  \n\nService:  4 stars.  The servers are really attentive here and call out the dim sum in English (the majority of the clientele is non-Asian).  They're also helpful in getting you items that you're not seeing on the carts passing by.  We had to do that for our dessert (sesame balls and custard tarts), which was cool because our server gave us the option of ordering just 2 pieces of each.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.  This is a good place to take someone who has never tried dim sum before.  The place is well-maintained and clean and the food is fresh.  Just don't take an Asian person here, they may complain about the prices.  \n\nHits:   Shanghai dumplings, peking duck, creative fare.\n\nMisses:  Crab cakes, prices.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Koi Palace, Ton Kiang, City View Restaurant", "author": "Keith C."}

They're location is clean and no strange smells.  Not your traditional authentic chinese dim sum place.\n\nThat being said...Yank Sing is probably my favorite dim sum place. Forget the price and just go by taste for a minute. Every time I've been there, the food has been hot and fresh. Of course I went on the weekend which usually is busier so the food is more fresh. So usually I order the following:\n\nThe hargow (steamed shrimp dumplings) & shumai (steamed pork dumplings) are your typical dimsum fare.  The rice noodles wrapped shrimp were cooked perfectly. Sometimes the rice noodles come out under cooked so they're a little too chewy or overcooked so they're too soft and jelly like. The steamed pork bun & the baked pork bun were cooked perfectly. The baked bun had a nice glaze on top that matched perfectly with the bbq pork instead. It was a pocket of surprises. \nBut the lettuce wrap chicken with plum sauce is pure bliss. The combination of the chicken with the water chestnuts, fried noodles, (and I think rice) topped off with the plum sauce. Man. That's food orgasmic. It's the sauce I think. I just love that sauce.  The chinese broccoli was nice and crunchy but not too chewy. The green beans with pork were delectable, a good balance to all the meat dishes. \nFor dessert I had the sesame seed ball and the almond ice cream. The almond ice cream is so nice. It has a light flavor of almond. I had to order 3.  =)\n\nThe wait is usually long on the weekend. Plus parking is a whole other mess.  But once you go in, it's nice.

There was a 20-minute wait for a table and it was very expensive for dim sum compared to Chinatown, but the dim sum was some of the best I've had.  There was this wonderful dim sum that they called their specialty of the house that was a dumpling filled with soup (that was a great sensation, popping this dim sum in your mouth and having this savory warm soup filling your mouth....mmmmm).  The only thing was that our bill for 5 people came to $99 (that was including a tip).  That's a lot for dim sum, in my opinion.  Despite that, we'll go back, because it was really good.", "author": "Meg T."}

If you eat at a normal dim sum place I usually spend between $30 to $40 for me and skinny cow.  If it were myself and my fat friends we would spend $30 to $40 each.  So if I took a fat friend with me we would be paying close to $60 to 80 per person.  Worth it.  No.  But the experience was good.   They have some off the menu items that I stole from the table next to me.  Everyone in this place looks rich.  Too bad I look homeless.  Suckaz.  The secret menu item to order here is the pistachio ice cream pie.  OMFG its amazing.  I asked the waitress if it was made in house she laughed and said no.  Chinese dont make no pistachio ice cream pie.  stupid me.  The ice cream pie had almond flavor ice cream on a bed of chocolate gram cracker crust topped with pistachios.  OMFG I think it was one of the best things I ate this year.  I want to order one for thanksgiving and christmas but I can't find it.  I will have to call them for the bakery.

I personally had great service (for a chinese restaurant)  \n\nI had barely sat down and by the time I had put my napkin on my lap, I had three dishes in front of me. If you are a dim sum fiend like me, that's a good thing. If you want to take your time and not feel pressured, then maybe it'll be overwhelming.\n\nOnto the food:\n\nI had rather high expectations and was happy that everything I had was of good quality. Spectacular quality? Eh. I was a tad disappointed because this is San Fran, after all. The siu Mai (steamed pork dumpling) was above average, though honestly I thought the shrimp to pork ratio was too high. The har cow (steamed shrimp dumpling) was good, but the skin was a tad too thick (still way above average, but i'm comparing this to the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon - I told you I was a dim sum fiend)  the Char siu bao (steamed bbq pork bun) was actually mediocre and totally skippable. Other reviewers seem to enjoy it, however. The Shanghai dumplings are an A minus. Or perhaps an A. Let's be honest, very few places do this dish well, and this is up there. Personally I enjoy Din Tai Fong's better (if you live in the LA area or in various locations in China)  theirs are better but these are still quite good.\n\nIf you want to just ask for a dish, they will gladly get it for you. If you want some hoisin sauce which is not at the table, they will also gladly get it. In general, this is spectacular service for a dim sum place. Many people pushing the carts at other restaurants couldn't care less what you do or do not get. Here, they seem to care.\n\nPrice: pricey. It was more expensive than I was expecting. Instead of of 4.50 or 5.00 for a dish, it was more like 6.50.\n\nI will say that I haven't been to too many SF dim sum places, but I would like to think you can get better 'value' elsewhere. However, if you want fresher food and better quality (though not always better tasting, though in many cases it is)  then this place is a good bet.", "author": "Mark L."}

I love Yank Sing; it's a weird experiment to upscale Chinese food from the depths of America's obsession with cheap fastfood.  (San Francisco arguably has a greater percentage of solidly \"authentic\" and quality Chinese, but say Chinese and try not to evoke take-out.)  Whether take out or in-restaurant, where else do you go for a meal of ginger scallion lobster, steamed fish, spring rolls, and sizzling beef, all for $25?  C'mon!  \n\nStars for the good food -- soupy dumplings, turnip cakes, pork spareribs, etc. Problem is, the restaurant struggles with fun food, essentially the stuff popular with the tourists that it can't give up (my friend LOVES the lettuce cups filled with minced pork topped with duck sauce...where the HELL did that come from?). You just want to take it by the neck and shout, NO!!  WCYD?  In the meantime, service needs serious quality control.  On this last occasion the cart ladies assiduously avoided us until I convinced a friend of the old lady technique, that is, to run up directly to the cart and finger their baskets of goodies until the lady acknowledges you to make you go away.  He mastered the technique quickly, and I think the beer got him off to a good start. Meanwhile, the tea ladies ply-ed us with a limitless supply of cold and hot tea. I had a full glass but she insisted I disregard the old glass and try the \"fresher\" one.  Gees.  \n\nI do detest the perennial wait at YS, and the absence of chicken feet, tongue, gizzards, tripe, and whatnot that reflect the ingenuity and reality of Chinese food. (Note: serve it up in a French restaurant and get charged 5x for 1/2 the portion.)  But think rent and location, think clean and bright, think tasty, and think of your first-time guests. This is definitely a place to introduce most folks to dim sum and to good Chinese.

So only go if you're using the Company's expense account, then it's Dim Sum at it's Finest. \n\nWhy 3 stars?\n\n1: Hands down on the Shanghai soup dumpling (XiaoLoanBao) (5 stars!!) The best in North Ca I have to say! Thin wrapper with tons of soup/juice inside! That is all I really come for. But $13 for 6 of them in a tiny basket. I order two baskets, then I bounce. \n2: Great service!! I'm impressed. Everyone there speaks English, (of course Chinese) from the waiter to the Cart pushing ladies! They are friendly & answers your questions & even help you order the food when it's not in their Cart & the waiter is not around. Everyone deserves to be tipped at 20% cause they are truly at your service. VERY RARE at a Chinese restaurant...even Koi Place doesn't have this top-notch service. \n3: Free validated parking on the weekends. Nice atmosphere. Lots of variety, some I've never seen before at other places - so it's great to try; such as Spinach dumpling & lots of vegetarian options - Curry Corner & lots of Tofu Wrap & Almond or Mango Ice Cream Cake slice. (Yummy)\n\nwhy negative 2 stars:\n1. HELLA expensive. every tiny dim sum dish is $9-15 bucks and there's no way you can find out the price; there's no menu or anything by the door. Just karts where you point & order. Unless you ask verbally to the Kart Pushers. \n2: As a Dim Sum pro, I know my dim sum and the Ha Gow & Sui Mai & some of the other \"Gow\" (dumpling in Cantonese)  was steamed too dry, it look & taste dehydrated. \n\nOverall, 70% of the Dim Sum is really good (4-5 stars) comparable to Koi Palace but the price is ridiculous.", "author": "Yum Y U M."}

I would've given them 5 stars but service can be slow at times and they need more bathrooms to handle their capacity (2 stalls for 200+ people is kind of weak).   On the plus side the bathroom and the restaurant are both very clean.  It's best to call ahead to make a reservation since even with a reservation you're looking at a 5-10 minute wait.  There's generally a 20-25 minute wait without a reservation.\n\nBBQ Pork Buns - tasty and filling.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps - Yummy and refreshing.\n\nGinger pork Shanghai dumplings  - one of their best dishes.  The perfect amount of ginger blended with pork in a nice steamy, juicy dumpling.\n\nBBQ Pork rice noodles - My favorite dish hands down.  I generally order two plates for myself.\n\nPeking duck - perfectly cooked.  Moist juicy duck with a crispy skin stuffed in a bun.  Perfection.  My second favorite dish.\n\nPotstickers - mediocre, dime a dozen.\n\nChicken Satay - tasty.\n\nBacon wrapped shrimp - c'mon did I need to say anything after bacon?  I had you at bacon.\n\nChicken mushroom dumpling - meh\n\nSesame ball - fine but nothing special\n\nThey have a nice selection of teas as well as a full bar.  They actually mix a really good cocktail (smooth, goes down easy). \n\nI usually go with a group of friends and it runs us about $35 each with tax & tip for multiple servings of 7 different dishes with a round of drinks.

I wasn't even full and when we split the tab.. it came out the be around $40 per person (tip included). If you don't mind paying a lot more for a little more attentiveness then come here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-28", "description": "Hands down, the place you need to eat dim sum!  Every bite is a bite of heaven. Yes, its expensive, but it is well worth it. Let me explain why Yank Sing is worth the money to eat here.  Kids, I have eaten at many dim sum restaurants over the years - LA, NY, SF, HK.  The best dim sum is obviously in Hong Kong, but Yank Sing is the closest thing you'll find to true HK dim sum in this area.  Dim sum is the bread and butter of this restaurant.  They do not do dinner here except for wedding banquets.  This restaurant has also been handed down generation to generation. The owner has had to learn how to make and perfect each and every dish.  The cooking was not outsourced to some independent chef. I agree, there are dishes served here during dim sum that are only for dinner, but whatever, they are appealing to the masses, not just the chinese. The quality and taste of the dim sum here is amazing...second to none.  Even the tea served is a higher quality.  Other dim sum restaurants may be very good but this a notch above.  Let me remind you, you get what you pay for.  \n\n1.  Taro root puff is very good - too many other places have made a good puff but is disgusting when it tastes like ammonia - YUCK\n2.  XLB (Xiao Long Bao / Little Dragon Dumpling / Pork Dumpling) is the specialty of the house - perfect bite size, texture and thinness of the dumpling is right, soup inside is tasty, pork inside does not taste overcooked or old\n3.  Onion cake/doughnut -  a little chic with the peanut sauce, but delicious\n4.  Mushroom dumpling - yummy goodness\n\nIf you are use to the hole in the wall dim sum place then Yank Sing is not for you. Call me a foodie, but I cannot even fathom paying 1/2 the price for even 3/4 the quality of food served here.  Its like shelling out money to buy an Accord when really you should just go ahead an pay for the Lexus GS .  This is the kind of place that the mainstream middle class families in HK would be eating at.  Good quality, good flavor, good service, and clean.  If you are willing to settle for cheap dim sum then you are totally missing the point... in chinese, dim sum means to touch the heart - not preserve the wallet.  And Yank Sing touches my heart so much that I feel giddy inside.", "author": "D G."}

When we got there, it was packed since bay to breakers and it's Sunday @ 2 p.m. Dimsum was in full effect in this place. The location and ambiance of this restaurant was very nice. It has that elegance and fancy effect like a true upscale restaurant. We had to wait for 15-20 minutes to get seated and I was tempted to just do a to go since it will probably faster and also cheaper. Anyway, we stayed and got seated. We were greeted by someone who asked for what we wanted to drink and the drinks/water arrived quickly (which is a plus for me I've been to tons of dimsum places and they never really give us water that fast). We ordered mostly seafood, fried, steamed, vegetables, pork shumai, and egg custard tarts. We had about 10-15 mini plates different things but the only thing that stood out for me was the crabcakes since it's flavorful and meaty. The rest are the same if not less than in comparison to all the dimsum places I've gone to (that aren't this pricey). For all the order we paid about $145 + tip. I feel like it's quite absurd on how expensive it was considering I usually go to dimsum with 8-10 people and our bill only comes to $200 for 15-20+ mini plates. It was a good experience but I won't go back there again for dimsum since it's too pricey and they don't have a lot of sauce that compliment their fried dumplings--they didn't have that mayo dip for the shrimpballs/crab claws.", "author": "Precious S."}

I expected the dim sum to be worth the expensive price ($30-40 per person); however, I was a bit disappointed. It started out bad when we were told that there was a 45 minute wait for a party of 2. This is pretty ridiculous considering it was 1 pm during the middle of the week, which isn't typically a popular time to eat dim sum. After an hour of waiting, we finally got seated. The wait staff was quick to bring carts around and there was a lot to choose from. Most of the dishes were standard and can be found at any dim sum restaurant. The more unique dishes were more expensive. Overall, the food was good, but it wasn't better than some of the dim sum places in Chinatown that serve these dishes for half the price. Expect decent food and a pleasant atmosphere at Yank Sing, but it seems like this place caters to American business people and tourists over Asians, which isn't usually a good sign in my opinion. Take a walk to Chinatown and experience a more authentic dining experience for a fraction of the price. On the other hand, if you're stretched for time on a lunch break from work or want to see celebrities like Dennis Haysbert (pretty awesome to see him walk in) then this might be your place. And if you decide to go, make sure you order the soup dumplings (xiao long bao)", "author": "Chenwu L."}

After moving to the Bay Area from Singapore, I went on a crazy hunt for the best \"xiao loong baos\" (shanghainese dumplings) here and I was deeply disappointed until I had them at Yank Sing. Call me a \"xiao loong bao\" connoisseur, where I would actually debate with my friend, Eric long distance on whether the ones from Crystal Jade's were better than Din Tai Fung's, and of course, he would always pull his, \"I've lived in Shanghai, so I know better.. and I was from Hong Kong\" rationale. They are still not as good as Crystal Jade or Din Tai Fung in Singapore, but it was a close second.\n\nAnyhow, Yank Sing is high on my list for dim sum in SF. The ones in Ctown are basically crap. \"Dim sum\" translated to English (not literal) means \"precious delicacies\" (the literal translation would mean \"touch heart\" -- eh?) and Yank Sing's dim sum embodies that. They are done with the right touch of flavor and aint soaked in grease like some of the other places.\n\nThe proper way of having dim sum (or yum cha that translates to \"drink tea\") in Hong Kong (or even across ctowns in Canada) is where you sit for hours, have a sip of tea, a few morsels, chat with your friends and read the papers. So, it's great that at Yank Sing, you dont have to yell over your food to have a decent conversation and the wait staff are always courteous and efficient.\n\nDining there isnt cheap, and some of my friends do not believe in paying that kind of price for chinese food. However, I'm a firm believer of paying for value, and I don't mind paying $25-$30/person for good dim sum. When I brought my parents who were visiting, they, of course had a sticker shock and kept comparing the prices to those in Canada, and the size of the dumplings, which were smaller than what they would get in Canada.

First my disclaimer, I am a Cantonese so I may be critical at what's considered as good dim sum. \n\nThis is my first time there since there are friends coming out of town and want to have dim sum in SF. It seems appropriate to bring the out-of-towner to the \"The Bay Area's Most Popular\" Restaurants according to Zagat 2008. It may be the most popular but it definitely not worth the drive from South Bay and the $$$. We paid $30 per person which echo one of the reviewer that is the avg price. The thing is that we still come out hungry. I am so furious and vow never to go back. \n\nThere are several awards mentioned in there website. I am not sure those people knows what dim sum is...hmm...now when I think about it they just said it is popular. Never mentioning it is good dim sum.\n\nThe food there is mediocre at best. I had much better dim sum in S.Bay (ABC, May Flower or HK Villa).  If you want closer to the city, there is East Ocean across the bridge in Emeryville or Koi Palace in Daly City. The steam BBQ bun there is not even authentic. The bun is not even made with the right flour and is not moist but wet like soaked in water. It does not crack on the top and does not taste like the traditional steam BBQ bun. \n\nThe one thing I may say good about is probably the decor and the water fountain for kids. The service is probably better than average relative to other dim sum places.\n\nHowever, I would steer clear of it if you want authentic dim sum at a reasonable price.

The Honey walnut cabbage salad is another mistakenly ordered delight, a cool crisp counterpoint to the doughyness of dumpling after dumpling.

I really like the restaurant, but this isn't Paris, and these prices are unjustifiable in today's economy. Very sadly, I won't be back.", "author": "Howard C."}

The hubby and I traveled to the city on BART, got off at Embarcadero and took a nice stroll to this restaurant in Rincon Center.  Boy were we glad we got reservations as the inside dinning room and atrium (for lack of a better word to describe it) space were packed with hungry people eating and hungrier people waiting to be seated.  I was a little worried about time even with our reservation since we were seeing Wicked after lunch but we got in right at our reservation time (how do they do that?) and before I could even take off my coat and put my purse on my chair a server with a cart was asking if I wanted shrimp dumplings.  We were ambushed by servers with carts and could only  manage to say no to a few things.  We had shrimp dumplings, eggrolls, potstickers, to name a few and their signature Shanghai dumplings that were recommended by a friend.  Litttle dumplings filled with a broth and topped with vinegar and ginger.  Really good!  It can be confusing and hard to say no but definitely be choosy and be aware that some of the more entree type dishes will be quite more expensive (take a look at that skinny menu they give you, the other side has drinks).  We were stuffed and happy about 30+ minutes after being seated.  The bill was a bit pricey but I can't complain about the service or dishes so I would say it was worth it.  Just make those reservations and you will enjoy the experience!", "author": "Laura T."}

The chaung feung shrimp rice noodle. With tender non sticky noodles, large pieces of shrimp and the chives inside. The little crunchy veggie added a zest of life into the roll\nThe soup dumplings were good and unique as always. They didnt break as u picked them up and were very yummy, since there is soup inside they are piping hot when u eat them.\nThe tea, while 2 dollars a person is actual tea and served in a pretty pot\nThen take the shrimp roll cake, which they added crab too. The two flavors worked very well together but still had seperate flavor to them. Fried to perfection and a great clash between the traditional dim sum and a crab cake\nThe char sui bao, which i might have ordered the wrong one had a good amount of filling and the filling was very yummy. You got a good contrast of flavors twin the two.\nThe schezuan chicken in appetizer size looked amazing. 6 dollars. So a bit expensive but would have been perfect if there had been two of me. Lots of chiles, lots of sauce but just enough to coat the meat and leave none on the plate\nThe peking duck. Served in a single serving hit the spot, small and yummy. The sauce was incredibly light which some might find ideal but i love the strong and heavy sauce they make for it. Right amount of fixins and served with a puffy bun instead of a pancake but still very tasty.\nThey didnt have the sugarcane shrimp which was disappointing. But i am stuffed already\nDude they do half orders of stuff thats awesome. It isnt for everything but most of the fried things. \nWow the shrimp toast was perfect.

The dim sum was good until we got the bill of $75 for a freaking LUNCH with tea!  At that point our whole day was ruined b/c we just ate ourselves into debit.  The night before at Le Colonial was supposed to be our \"nice\" meal, we didn't plan on spending over $50 for a meal for the rest of our trip, so you can imagine our disbelief at our bill.  What bothers us most is our mistake of going there.  We had lunch the day before at The Stinking Rose and loved it, so we thought about going again for lunch.  Stupid us for deciding to go to Yank Sing instead to try something different.  Our rational was that the Stinking Rose was a little pricey and that there was no way that Chinese food could be that much.  Well we were tragically wrong.

As far as the food, it is of excellent quality and a wide variety of different items is offered, including the usual seafood dumplings, but some unusually scrumptuous flaky curry chicken pastries and baked pork buns, to a few items that, to my eyes anyhow, appear at least inedible and at worst like something from Sinclair's poultry rendering plant.

One time I was too sick to appreciate what I was eating.  Another time I purchased to go.  A couple of weeks ago I came back to give it another try.  This time I sat with 11 other people.  They had gone back to the bamboo steamers apparently.  The tea sets still the designer ones.  But the food WAS EXCELLENT.  I especially loved the STEAMED CHICKEN DUMPLINGS.  It was so flavorful.  It looked like chicken instead of gray cardboard colored glob, tasted chickeny, and few sprigs of herbs.  I wanted more but they ran out.  I also loved the XIAO LONG BAOS.  Here is coming from a not red meat eater, folks.  I am generally a healthy food eater.  I do make rare exceptions.  Why?  Simply because I love food.

I love their scallop dishes too, they are a bit pricey. Be forewarned anything that they walk around with that isn't on the carts is at least $10 & up. Those definitely add up after awhile, and you leave the place questioning your $100 bill for lunch for 2. You also leave this place hungry after a few hours, which is kind of a bummer.

The same ladies with the same food kept passing us to the point where we could pinpoint exactly what they had in their carts. Our waiter hawked us so we were a bit uncomfortable but  I'm sure he was  making sure we got everything we wanted and needed. Food was decent but I've had much better (a bit overpriced as well). The best dish for me was the xiao long bao [ shanghai dumplings ] with vinegar/ginger sauce. I was able to slip to the waiter that it was my friends birthday and after our check, the waiter and manager came out to sing happy birthday to my friend (the first time ever in my entire life a Chinese restaurant sang happy birthday...well, in English) and brought egg tarts with a candle in one of them. The staff is very friendly and the location is very nice as well but if you want authentic (or as close as possible) Chinese dim sum, you might want to try going to Chinatown. Remember, they validate! $4 for two hours I believe. I think the parking garage charges $6 / 30 minutes.", "author": "Christina Y."}

I couldn't give Yank Sing the 5 star rating cause of the dismount (on that one jump where the chick landed on her knees...).... wait...I'm falling off the subject here.  Anyhow, yeah, the dismount after eating here... is the bill, and that usually gets a bit steep.. actually way steep.  Compared to the hidden jewels of Clement St.  But like other reviewers, the food is exceptional.  The Shanghai dumplings (just how to they get that soup in there and make it spiral up so nicely??!?!) are superb, and the shu-mai.... almost 'tastes' healthy.   And what other dim sum place do you know of where it's high-tech enough that the Chinese servers wear the headset/earpieces.... \"Uh, yeah... I need a chow fun in sector 8, and fish balls in sector 9... over!\"....  One nice benefit... the free complimentary parking underground on the weekends.... makes for one less thing to fight for when going here.  But be smart.... \"Friends don't let friends go to Yank Sing on the weekend without a major credit card or a reservation!\".", "author": "Dale K."}

My mom took me here when I was 5 and from then on, I was hooked. Our family would come back here frequently over the years, and I have had many a lovely meal here stuffing myself with my parents and sisters. However, over the past 9-10 years or so, the prices have risen more and more, and I think the quality of the dim sum has suffered some. Also- its not very authentic, although their dishes are very creative, its Chinese food geared towards tourists. I appreciate the fact  that the dim sum here has minimal grease and seems to use fairly high quality meats and seafoods, but come on- $5 for a plate of 4 tiny har gao! I went here with a friend that lived in the Rincon towers one morning, and we did not eat a whole lot and spent about $30 each, which I thought was ridiculous. This is a place I would probably take non chinese clients or coworkers to, but with all the great dim sum places in the area, I wont be coming here of my own accord, though the memories here are endless.", "author": "Manali K."}

The food is good, the service is efficient (the waitstaff speaks decent English) and the place is nice and clean.  I usually feel a little uncomfortable eating dim sum at most places unless I'm with a Chinese friend, but guay-lo can get by just fine here.  The restaurant even proudly displays their health code score of 100 because it's probably the only Chinese restaurant in the country that did so well.  I just love the dim sum carts  (I've been trying to get one of my friends to push a cart and dress like a dim sum wench for Halloween for years).  So many of the smaller places don't have them.  It's nice to see what you're getting before you order.  Also, the waitstaff here isn't as aggressive as at many other places.  Honestly, how many times do I have to say no to chicken feet!  They also have a huge variety, including some higher-end non-traditional dishes like the deep-fried soft-shell crab.  I also really like the deep-fried crab claw.  I typically focus on the seafood stuff, like various shrimp dumplings but pretty much everything I've had has been good.  It's also nice that they offer peking duck by the slice.  Many of my Chinese friends don't like this place because it's rather pricey for dim sum, but I don't mind spending $30 - 40 pp for good quality and service.  They also take reservations.", "author": "Saw T."}

Two words-- THE PRICE.  As most of the other reviewers have said, for your Sunday-dimsum-with-the-family dishes you could do better price wise.  However Yank Sing  does have innovative / special occasion dimsum like their peking duck, and not your typical minced meat (squab maybe?) in lettuce leaf, fusion dumplings, to name a few.  To get your money's worth, keep away from the typical dimsum fare and be adventurous.  That's where Yank Sing shines.  I travel to Asia time and again, and find that Yank Sing could be considered your typical \"fine dinning\" Chinese restaurant out there.  So keep that in mind when paying your tab (great food without the jet lag).  For families with small children and restless adults who can't keep still, the wanna be waterfall outside is a good entertainment factor when they get bored.", "author": "Marissa M."}

So I can't comment on its authenticity, on the service, on the price, or anything in comparison to other Dim Sum. \n\nWhat I can say is that it was totally overwhelming, delicious, and hella expensive all at once. But it was so worth it!\n\nI munched on tofu, scallop dumplings, scallop/taro fried things, sea bass , and some sesame dessert thing. My boyfriend ate some of this with me, but also ate some pork dumplings and pork/taro. The dumpling sauce was bright red and filled with ginger, so you know it was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The scallops were tender and delicately flavored, especially in the dumplings. Wasn't as hot on the fried taro, but I thought it was pretty traditional, so I gave it a try. The sesame dessert was wonderfully chewy, not too sweet, and served as a fine finale to the meal. Sorry I don't know the real names of any of the dishes. It was fast and furious. Carts kept coming, dishes kept piling, I'd ask what something was and it would be on my table. I was delighted and confused all at once. But by the end of the meal, I knew how to use the spoon for the dumplings and that you can use your hands for the taro things, and even though my right hand is so messed up from bass playing and designing, I even got the chopsticks going right for a bit. It was a great lunch. The most expensive of my life, but an adventure....though I wondered if they staff there totally hated me by the end. I made a mistake in not ordering tea...how could I mess that one up? But if I ever make it back there (it seems possible), I will be sure not to forget some pu-erh.", "author": "lisa s."}

We visited a lot of different venues before finding Yank Sing.  We accidentally discovered Yank Sing one Saturday morning as they were setting up for a wedding ceremony in the atrium and we immediately knew that this was where we wanted to get married because the site was gorgeous, especially the skylight roof and fountain.  Plus, there is free parking for your guests (nearly unheard of in San Francisco!) and we'd be indoors and protected from the elements.  However, we were concerned about whether the food and the service would pass the ultimate test of our parents.  Joy Li, our Yank Sing coordinator, arranged for us to have a tasting and our parents and bridal party were extremely impressed with the delicious food and the excellent service and could not stop raving about it!   Since we lived in Sacramento, Joy made time to meet with us regularly after work, late in the evenings and on weekends to help us customize our wedding ceremony & banquet.  She was a pleasure to work with and did a detailed and exceptional job.  On the day of our wedding, the food came out on time and was hot and delicious.  The staff were very attentive and polite.  Even the bathrooms were extremely clean and stocked all evening.  After our wedding, our friends and family all told us how much they loved the food and thought the service was so much better than at other Chinese restaurants.  They loved it so much that my brother later got married here as well.  Even though we live 2 hours away, my husband and I will still occasionally drive to Yank Sing on the weekends just to have Dim Sum because they have the best Dim Sum in the city.  We have such fond memories of our wedding day, thanks to everyone at Yank Sing.   We love Yank Sing and highly recommend it.
