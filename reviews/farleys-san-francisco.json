A rather interesting coffee shop located in Potrero Hill, this place features coffee/tea & pastries with small lunch options + both indoor & outdoor seating. Ordered a iced chai tea latte at the counter. To describe the ambience, lots of tables & chairs in the indoors along with some couches/sofas near the front/windows with board games to entertain goers and the outdoor seating features tables & chairs. It took longer than I thought it should for the baristas to fulfill the order after being placed, but it didn't bother me too much (it might for those less patient). Now, as for the product itself? It came out okay. Sweetness was there, but it lacked the sharp slight bitterness that should distinguish good chai tea. There was also too much ice in the drink as well. All in all, a decent & okay option for coffee/tea and pastries.\n\nP.S.

Although located on steel hills, the cafe is nicely situated alongside other mom and pop shops.\n\nFor the positives - Farley's San Francisco is in a nice neighborhood. If you walk around you'll hit a few artisan shops with friendly owners. The artisan feel is very San Francisco. Also, the food and coffee here is not bad. It's slightly above average with pretty delightful pastries. \n\nFor things to improve - the ambiance in this Farley's is a far cry from the one in Oakland. The cafe is always crowded with no space or room for creative deep focus. In fact, the cafe feels a lot like a regular coffee shop chain during their busier days. So, this is an unfortunate turn off especially since it's located in a nice neighborhood.\n\nOverall, I give this Farley's an okay rating of three stars.

This cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and on an early Sunday afternoon was filled with lots of busy bees on their laptops and studying with a full array of books. This cafe reminded me a lot of my college days in that the cafes on and around campus are filled to the brim with students, and it strangely made me feel at home? To be fair, I graduated from college less than a year ago, so it would make sense why Farley's would have that sense of comfort for me!\n\nFarley's had a nice selection of teas and pastries, and I ordered the Pacific Peppermint tea with a salted caramel fudge brownie. The tea was refreshing and cooling, but ehh it's peppermint tea, so you can find this anywhere, but the brownie was AMAZING. It was perfectly fudgey and dense and the salted caramel drizzle on top balanced out the indulgent chocolate in the brownie -- definitely the winner for me. \n\nFarley's makes a great spot to study on a lazy weekend afternoon and a lovely place to pass the time if you're waiting to eat brunch at The Plow.

They had a variety of baked goods and salads. They sell T-shirts and books/magazine(i think, since there is a shelf in the back right corner).

No regrets.)\n\nI headed here with my coworkers at about 10 AM to start doing work at Farley's. Because I don't really go over to Portero Hill that often, I'm not very familiar with the coffee shops around this area or their quality. \n\nService and Space:\nThe baristas are friendly enough, since I didn't really talk to them. They're willing to ice your drinks and adjust the contents according to your wishes, and like socializing with each other as well as the customers. This space doesn't feel like all the tech-industry workers have sucked out the energy and are here to enjoy their time, not just their work. The music is calming, too.\n\nDrinks and Food:\nI ordered the ginger root tea, which was surprisingly spicy (and I liked it!) It isn't overpowering, but since they give you the tea leaves to steep for as long as necessary, you can adjust the strength of your tea. The mushroom empanada that I tried (my coworker bought one) wasn't very crisp, though.\n\nOverall, I'd return here for the ambiance. Try to get the corner circular table, with pillows!

It's a very open cafe with tons of seating and airy feel. What I loved most was the little news stand in the corner -- with every magazine you could think of (minus trashy tabloids). People were sitting around reading their magazines while sipping coffee. I loved it! Such a different vibe that what I'm used to. I would definitely sit and study/ read here on a weekend. \n\nBest of all they had banana bread samples on the counter which was SUPER fresh and scrumptious.", "author": "Naseem K."}

Had no idea it had all these hidden gems!!\nI was attracted by the elevated patio seating outside with faux grass, it was really cute. It's your typical neighborhood cafe that is well maintained and friendly service. They have a corner with magazines (for sale?), and a high top table for reading.

At $3.25 for an Americano (that's espresso and water, folks!), they've gone completely round the bend -- that's close to what a cappuccino costs at a Blue Bottle, and indisputably, ridiculously expensive, even by San Francisco's insane standards. The coffee isn't even that good!\n\nWorse, the new owners have basically sterilized the culture: today I walked in the shop to find that every. single. table. was occupied by someone with their face buried in a laptop. Almost nobody had food or drinks. A cafe that used to have conversation and readers and singers and poets now has...tech dorks. Like every other San Francisco public space. It's just sad.\n\nFarley's owners: eliminate/regulate the wi-fi, cover the outlets, and otherwise discourage Laptop People from setting up camp.

Every time, I've asked (usually a nice woman) to make me a double espresso with a teeny bit of water, and a teeny bit of warm milk.  I'll say, \"Essentially, an Italiano as I've heard it called, with a little milk.\"  Every time, she (then a nice dark haired guy yesterday) made it with no question, other than \"water up to here?\" They both charged me for what they call a Macchiato, $3.00.  \n\nTODAY, some blonde dude with a British accent took my order, and charged me $3.25, which just made me curious so I explained, that whatever they were making me (which was PERFECT) had been called a Macchiato for $3 - I didn't want to end up with a different drink.  He started raking me over the coals, explaining to me that what I wanted was actually a \"GIBRALTAR\" and that I was actually \"getting a DEAL\" on it.  (Like I was trying to steal from them?!)\n\nI don't mind paying $3.25 for a drink, but I don't like being schooled, (to the point of embarrassment) in my coffee by a barista who was probably still drinking mother's milk when I was sipping cappuccinos in NYC 20 years ago.  .... \nGibraltar.

If you are more inclined to the mass produced, innocuous lighter roasts of S-bucks, you won't like Farley's.\n\nThey have almond and soy milk to mix in with your coffees, which is rare and most welcomed.\n\n-\n\nTo go cups - 1 size and it's miniscule.   Need to offer to go cups in various sizes.\n\nHygiene of staff leaves something to be desired.   When preparing food, their long, scraggly, unkempt and visibly dirty hair projects over the preparation space....Resulting in the likelier probability of unwelcome ingredients as you bite into your morning bagel with cream cheese.\n\nStaff also prepares food with bare hands....God knows what they've touched in the last hour!\n\nAttitude - I concur with most other reviewers.

The coffee is delicious, the ambiance is cozy, and the woman behind the counter was so generous that I tipped her extra. It's a cafe, so no, they don't have a huge menu. Want lunch? Go around the corner to Papito for a burrito, and come back when you want a cuppa java.

Farley's does a fabulous job of inviting the public, especially the locals, in for their daily ration of black gold. \n\nMy Breve Latte came foaming over the lip in the traditional large porcelain cup.  I took this, cradled between two hands, to one of the many quaint tables and a copy of The Captain's Daughter.  I had recently finished reading a Steig Larsson book (upon the recommendation of a friend who had just finished the Millennium series) and had found the modern fiction somewhat entertaining, if not a hard return to reality, given the subject material in that specific title.  My latte did a fantastic job of erasing such thoughts.  Hot.  Creamy.  Perfect.\n\nI had a supper gathering to attend to later, so after finishing my latte, decided it was high time to walk further down the block to kill time and rev up my metabolism for what I knew was a feast awaiting me.", "author": "Miika M."}

I can't remember ever having to apologize to someone for the coffee before.  Plenty of meh out there, but nothing sinking to this level.\n\nHow to describe it?  You may know and recognize the intrinsically lousy flavor of Farmers Brothers Coffee.  You know, favorite of greasy spoons and institutional kitchens, not because it's good.  Add a strong insult of burning and you have a reasonable approximation.  I had mine black (VERY BAD IDEA) but I doubt any amount of adulterant could hide this awfulness.

I know, it's a ridiculous thing to hear from a man in his 40s, but what can I tell you?  It wasn't in the house when I grew up, I tried it when I went off to college and didn't like the taste, and over the years since, every time I've tried it it always seemed unnecessarily bitter tasting.  I mean, let's face, ANYTHING is going to taste good buried under cream and sugar, but I wanted to like the coffee itself, you know?\n\nMy gateway drug came in the form of \"New Orleans style Iced Coffee\" from Blue Bottle.  They soften the bitter edge with Chicory.  And of course, the amazing, meth-like rush wasn't anything to sneeze at either.  Slowly, I began to acquire a taste for the bean juice.  And now, like the rest of the world, I am finally hooked.  HAPPY?  Another junkie joins your ranks.\n\nAnyway, all of this rather lengthy introduction is to say that I come to this whole coffee thing with a \"beginner's mind.\"  I have no pre-conceptions of how it should taste, I wasn't raised on Chock full o' Nuts, so I bring very little bias to the table. \n\nHaving said that, out of all the \"TOP TIER\" coffee joints in SF, I can tell you that, IMHO, Farley's is the best.  I've tried Blue Bottle, I've tried Four Barrel, Philz, Peet's, Faye's.  But, to me, Farley's tastes the best, hands down.  (Not to say that the others are bad, I can enjoy a cup from all of those places, but there can be only one Top Dog, and that is Farley's.)\n\nI have not had any problems with any of the staff being rude.  Maybe the manager saw all your negative posts and changed things up there, I don't know, it's not like I've been going for years and years.  But as far as I can tell the folks behind the counter are nice and friendly.  We usually have a brief chat if it's not too busy, so nothing bad to report on the customer relations front.\n\nIn short: yea Farley's!!  And they're not nearly as expensive as Four Barrel.  \n\nNow, can someone explain to me how Starbucks became so damn popular?  I tried their coffee and it taste like garbage.

I don't need a seasonal lunch menu or scones to die for or free-range chickens that led happy lives until you decided to slit their throats humanely, but I would appreciate a bagel.  Or toast.  Or maybe even--gasp--a sandwich.\n\nBut Farley's has none of this.  What it does have is coffee.  And there are games and magazines, so it looks really promising, actually.  Except that it's huge.  That's a positive thing, right?  Well, no, because despite its impressive square footage, it has managed to lay itself out so poorly that there are relatively few places to sit, and all of these places are crowded around one another.\n\nThe last time I was here, this blowhard who used to live in the neighborhood was literally walking around striking up conversations with people he used to know/work with/bother.  Despite the fact that no one seemed to be interested in what he was saying, he went on and on about how he had to pick up the keys to his Ferrari because his au pair from Denmark wanted to drive it before she returned home and about how he couldn't decide whether to build a house in Marin or Malibu or Miami.  I was trying to concentrate on grading, but it was impossible because he kept repeating himself loudly to different people.  I was here for at least forty-five minutes, and he was still talking when I left.  He hadn't sat down; he was just hovering and carrying on about his shallow, materialistic life.\n\nYou can bring in food from next-door Hazel's Kitchen, and that's pretty nice.  But the ambiance.  It's too big and too cramped at the same time.  It's really cold, and while it looks the part, it's not really a San Francisco coffeehouse.  Its clientele is just a little bit too--well, like that guy.  I know not everyone is like him, but if he felt comfortable doing what he did here and if he used to spend time here, it's likely that many other people are like him.

My cousins live nearby and two of us popped in on St. Patty's Day for a hot tea before heading over to Plow for breakfast (this shop doesn't serve food).  We were totally in for a fun surprise: a live Irish band (complete with violin, guitar, and some other instrument that slips my mind now) were there to treat the crowd in light of the holiday.\nWhen we walked back out about an hour later, a man on a bagpipe was bringing it as well.  So cool!  I am not a fan of bagpipes, but I am a fan of talent and all the musicians were really talented.  Beyond St. Patty's Day, you can tell that Farley is the type of place that really supports local artists, which I appreciate.  Many of their painting hung on the way and the set up of the cafe itself seemed like they must have had a hand in the design. Very nice.  I wish there were a shop like this in my own neighborhood, but for now I will just continue to stop by when I am visiting my fam.", "author": "Elsa M."}

They also are now serving four flavors of Three Twins Ice Cream (although no cones!).\n\nThe bad-the blend is still far worse than it used to be. They are going to be selling sandwiches in direct competition with the sandwich shop RIGHT next door and that is a huge douche move.\n\nThe poor decisions just keep on coming at Farley's. The new roast which they proudly proclaim costs more (hipsters seem to have a real love of paying more for less quality) is super sour and weak tasting more like starbucks chain coffee than a local custom roast. The folks have had a month to get the grind and roast right so that isn't the issue. Nope like most of the changes it's a matter of taste. Poor taste.\n\nRoger's son has taken over this place and the changes have not been good. I don't care if they worked in Oakland where he lives but the changes he has made like closing earlier, getting rid of seating and adding really uncomfortable seats and crappy hipster stuff don't improve this place at all. I am for change when it actually makes a place better. His changes haven't.

On several occasions, its been the only reason I've taken an afternoon to get some work done when I'm near Potrero. \n\nAnd yet I seem to forget that Farley's seemed staffed by people who are incapable of being nice. So much so that they seem to take some nasty pleasure in being just a little less than polite, a little cold rather than helpful, and a little to eager to tell you what they can't do rather than what they can. \n\nCase in point: I'm writing this review from Farley's. I ordered an iced coffee 10 minutes ago, which was delicious. The fellow behind the counter began our interaction not with \"hello\" or \"what can I get for you?\" but with \"the line is on this side of the counter.\" (Hey, jerk. There isn't anyone else ordering. a) how was I to know that b) what difference does it make and c) you beginning our transaction by scolding me makes me want to turn around and leave). After getting my coffee, I asked him for less ice, which he ignored. I then paid, tipped him anyway, at which point he didn't say thank you and waved his hand over his shoulder when I asked where the cream was. \n\nFarley's, I understand everyone has a bad day. This is at least the 4th time I've had this kind of rude, careless service at your counter. It is not cool, it is not fashionable, it isn't \"just our vibe.\" Rude is rude. \n\nWould it kill you to be nice people?

I don't know Besides, the cup is enough, it's pretty big. \n\nAs for the service, couldn't ask for more. Everyone there is nice and helpful. When I pay for my order, I'm usually told that if I wanted more hot water, just ask. Even though I've already engraved it in my brain, it's real nice of them to let me know. And the milk, sugar, honey & such is off to a sideboard by the magazines.\n\nOh, the magazine corner. Very impressive collection. They have a LOAD of different names, and subjects from auto to music to beauty to...well, you get the idea! There are some outdoor seating; few tables for two and seats that holds those plants/small trees (whatever it is you call them), as well as a few seats by the window, more tables for two, and wall/diner style seats inside. The atmosphere is very relaxed, selection of music very nice (well, it's my type of songs, so I deal), all in all, my 'boyfriend' is very comforting.\n\nI usually take the 22 when I go to Farley's, there's a stop on Texas and you just backtrack to Farley's.

Frankly I'll avoid this place on Mondays from now on. As for the coffee-making clown* with the snippy manner: Listen, Chuck, anybody who comes into your cafe and orders espresso has done it a million times at a thousand other cafes. They know how long it takes a competent person to make espresso. And none of these people were rude to you. You are an ass.\n\n* who doesn't deserve the appellation \"barista\"", "author": "Mark P."}

My kind of coffee shop.\n\nBut, the anachronistic part lies in their sheer disregard of modern coffee shop convention (ahem, Peet's, Starbucks, etc.) There's a gigantic magazine rack sitting in the corner-- if only people actually read them!-- at least 10 people on their computers who haven't returned to the counter for seconds in over an hour, and none of the Crate & Barrel polish of the more chic San Francisco java hot spots.\n\nThe result?

Due to those people, though - it's a bit hard to talk in this coffee shop at a discernable volume because with everyone solo at their tables, two chatty girls talking could be heard by basically all.  We were discussing... uh... classified information.  \n\nWhat disappoints me about Farley's is that their coffee is mediocre.  It's just nothing special - can't even hold a candle to Starbucks, in my opinion, never mind premium coffee like Blue Bottle.  Some love Farley's coffee, so to each his/her own, but it just wasn't my cup of coffee.  It was just OK.\n\nService was acceptable - - nothing warm or friendly but I can't say they were rude, either.

So, coffee is what keeps me going now more than in grad school, more than living in Milan, more than a long night (or week) of partying. Liam and I are now experts on the coffee scene of Potrero Hill. \n\nAnd Farley's is one of our favorites. The customers are extremely friendly and varied--lots of people \"between jobs\" who are probably updating their Facebook status more than their resume, scruffy dog-lovers in clogs, newspaper readers, and then a whole clan of dark-circled breeders like myself, wearing their little love bundles in Ergo carriers for fear that if the babies weren't attached to us, we'd be so zombified we'd forget them somewhere. \n\nThe cappuccino breves are life-savingly hot and the foam is perfect. It's like they know I have been looking forward to this beverage since my little Liam wake up call at 5 am. The atmosphere is comfortable and kid-friendly, though the staff are kind of surly for folks who get to tank up on free caffeine all day. The huge magazine selection is fun.

With some newbie coffee making and tea serving staff behind the counter who think they are too cool for school...specifically like \"I have a moped and you don't, and my hands are dirtier than yours coz I pretend I know how to fix my moped and you don't, or I'm too good to serve you though I willingly chose to have a job at a cafe making and serving unimpressive lattes on a daily basis\" attitude. Besides if you are really that cool, you don't have to PRETEND as such in order to overcompensate your insecurity. Get over yourselves already and serve me some subpar lattes with a half smile...I'll even tip you an extra $0.25 for that Kodak moment!\n\nI have been coming here on and off for years and have seen rude/indifferent staff come and go but this latest batch really takes the cake! I remember it being more of a friendly neighborhood cafe with OK lattes and OK desserts with pretty good magazine selection minus the severe \"better than thou\" attitude...though it's all relatively speaking...the poser factor has definitely worsened now than ever. \n\nPerhaps is guilty pleasure or something, I still drop in every once in awhile if I'm in the neighborhood. I really need to remind myself to stop doing that.  \n\nThere are way too many local cafes that are much better and more worthy of my support than this so-called voted \"Best Independent Coffeehouse in San Francisco\". I wonder if the votes were rigged?? Hmm...\n\nUPDATE as of 9/14/07: Apparently, the annoyingly rude batch of coffee makers (people NOT machines I was referring to) are no longer visible at Farley's lately and the new group of barristas have been quite pleasant and my lattes are actually tasting much better than before (it could be psychological or it could be not...but it's all good). So I'm upgrading them from two stars to three now. \n\nAnd if they keep up the good work/service...I'll have another update at a later date and may up one more star again in the future.", "author": "Jen L."}

Farley's has a cute window front and little outdoor tables which makes it very pleasant on the good weather days. Not too much sidewalk traffic when I was there--- but then again I didn't see much life outside of Farley's (this was 11am-1pm on a Sunday)\n\n1 star reduction for a cold server. I ordered a pot of Jasmin tea and the guy behind the counter was pretty unfriendly. My tea water was actually lukewarm, not in anyway hot. Only the first cup was at a somewhat appropriate temperature. It felt like such a waste of Jasmin pearls to not make many more cups. But on account of the server's attitude I didn't want to ask for new water. \n\nSeems like another great SF cafe. But it's the type of place where old newspapers are left behind and the tables get bussed but not wiped down. Chairs are unevenly placed and tables are turned weird ways based on the last person who sat there. This definitely makes it feel like a more neighborhood place but not as \"put together\" as others. Had only a few tables big enough for working/studying, and many little round ones for 1-2 people.\n\nThe strawberry scone I had was delicious!

The magazines were just the icing on the cake as was the simplicity of it all.  \n\nWhat you see is what you get.  Really, this is just your local, community coffee shop that does it's thing by just being itself.  I love the bikers, the families, the students, the techy-commuters, etc...  I've become a regular so much so that it feels really odd if I'm not at Farleys in the morning a couple times before work during the week or at noon on the weekends.  \n\nIt's like Cheers - everyone knows your name.  And you know ahead of time, that as you're about to arrive, one of your friends or acquaintances will be there.  Besides the coffee, it offers a great social platform.  I like that feeling.  That I can hide out in a corner and work or read or catch up on the neighborhood chatter and maybe make some plans for later in the week. \n\nAnyway.. when you find a place that keeps bringing you back, it's a great feeling.

Anywhere on the floor you sit, you kind of feel like you're in the way of the foot traffic, but seating along the walls is great.\n\nIt's easy to feel connected to the community here, since it's usually bustling with people and it feels like everyone is a regular.

I love neighborhood coffee shops and had high hopes for this one.  I was disappointed all around.  First the drink. My litmus test for any coffee shop is the cappuccino.  Before Starbucks this was almost always made right, now most place make the Starbucks version which is basically a latte.   Their one size cup guarantees this will always be bad.  I don't want coffee flavored milk.  Perhaps regular coffee is better here.  \n\nService, I didn't feel any attitude from the barista but maybe that was because he was to buisy ignoring me.  After standing at the counter for 3 minutes I expect a little bit of acknowledgment from the barista who is having a conversation with another patron from behind the counter just 5 feet away.  I don't need him to jump right over but an \"I'll be right with you\" would have been nice.  Not the most welcoming staff.  \n\nFrom the street the atmosphere looks great, one of the reasons I was looking forward to trying this place out.  Once inside finding a seat was near impossible at 3 in the afternoon on Saturday.  If half of the floor space wasn't wasted behind the counter I would be more forgiving on this point but they only serve coffee, tea and very basic pastries,  no real food to speak of.  Yet, half the cafe's space is wasted behind the counter while maybe a dozen tables are crowded together in the same amount of space. My living room is smaller than the space behind the counter here.  But I'm glad the barista is nice and comfy and no one is intruding into his personal space.  So sitting here is not incredibly relaxing.  On top of that the chairs are not comfortable at all.  The music is generally good but blaring way to loud. Yes, I'm old but not that old, background music is good, college dorm loud not so much when at a coffee shop.    \nWhat Farley's does have going for it is that it is a neighborhood cafe.  So I'll go here before Starbucks.  But the coffee down the street at Chats is better and you can get food.", "author": "Michael D."}

I wasn't really affected by the rebel cry, I just really liked... the space and the likability of the menu. At $1.75 for a cup of genma cha, this is probably a little expensive but in comparison to other SF coffee costs, pretty reasonable; additionally, its not everywhere that you can get a to-go cup of genma cha or pu-er tea, or even pekoe orange. \nService was great, though I can agree on the mellowness, which was agreeable to me...

I usually stop by alone these days to look at magazines, try a fresh pastry, or sip a latte. When my kids were small, they would accompany me for an orange juice and madeleine before we headed over to Christopher's Books. Owner and employees and customers are the reason San Francisco is still a fantastic place to live. Go Farley's!!", "author": "Mary G."}

Best latte I've ever had.  Love the magazine selection, window seats, sort of rugged decor, and all the games available to play while inside.  Love the homeless man asleep at the table next to me; looked sort of dead and was holding a book the whole time.  Pie, pumpkin chocolate bread, and ham croissants are perfect.  A bit pricey.  Some of the staff behind the counter are friendlier than others, but none of them have been rude to me.  I love that I can just sort of hang around in here all day.  A few cute employee dudes.  Overall, pretty good.", "author": "Tuesday J."}

Guess what, Farley's makes good, more importantly, STRONG, coffee, quickly. If you want a triple nonfat soy protein wheat-grass latte reduction served by a brainwashed loser with a shit-eating grin, I recommend you head to one of the 100 or more corporate coffee shops in the city. Sure, the staff can be, let's say, less than amicable, but, having to deal with cranky, under-caffeinated people at 7 o'clock in the morning every day might put a chip in your shoulders too, friends.  All I know is, I get exactly what I'm looking for, plus you just can't fuck with the dirt bombs doughnut muffins, they are incredible. If you're a coffee expert, buy a french press and shut up, if you're a thin-skinned bonehead that can't get over the fact that there's only one size cup, go to the starbuck's that inevitably located within walking, nay, driving distance (you have a hybrid, right?) of the neighborhood you're currently gentrifying.", "author": "Willy M."}

Even though I live between North Beach & Russian Hill, with 5 cafes within 2 block radius, I would still drive all the way across town for a Farley's latte. If I'm driving back on 101N when Farley's open, I always get off at the Vermont St. exit just so I can stop at Farleys.  The  staff have always been friendly to me.  I just wish they haven't given in to the non-fat  drinkers!  I respected Farley's for serving the \"real\" thing for the longest time. Well, it's s tough economy and they have to do what they have to do to broaden their customer base.  Still, I love Farley's!", "author": "Lori H."}

A friend lives in Potrero Hill so I had walked by Farley's on the way to his house and  thought that I would give it a shot.  Conclusion is: one of the best places in the city.  The coffee and snacks looked like your standard fare, although I can only attest to the current tea which was tasty. The part of Farley's that will be bringing me back is the awesome magazine rack, the journals full of patron doodles, and the table next to me that seemed to know everyone who walked through they door.  A great place to spend the afternoon.", "author": "Elliot A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-19", "description": "Farley's is a TRUE neighborhood coffee shop and neighborhood contributor. Great espresso, tea and pastries (if you pick the right ones). Not always impressed by the regular coffee although, now that they are having their own beans roasted, this might be improving. Amazingly kid & pet friendly. The rotating art displays are always interesting if not top quality and ho can beat the pet parade & photo gallery?? Totally incredible magazine selection for a newsstand let alone a coffee shop. Sometimes I wind up buying less that I would because they do not take credit cards which would also help me out as a business owner for expense tracking purposes. In general, the staff is quite delightful especially if you smile at them and do not treat them like crap like many patrons tend to do. Unfortunatly, like with any business there are a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.", "author": "CJ S."}

I have lived down the street from Farley's for over 10 years.  Cool looking place, perfect hangout, but the service can be unbelievably rude.  I remember being yelled at because the employee made me the wrong drink, and clearly that was my fault.  My 75 year old mother was yelled at by worker because she did not order fast enough.  Farley's is like a little club of regulars.   If you are not one of the \"cool regulars\" you get treated very poorly.  I really do not need to belong to a fraternity at this point (or really ever) in my life.  I always laugh when Farley's is rated as a great coffee shop.  Sad little place.

Now the place is filled  with some jerk in line ahead of me wanting some soy decaf double shot hazelnut skinny drink, and wanting to know if the coffee beans were picked by slave trade laborists. Though it still has it's vicotrian neighborhood charm, the added patrons seem to clutter the setting, altering the once low-key atmosphere.  Tables are now littered with laptops.  Gone are the local artsy types, but you'll still see a few here and there.  I know it may not have been the owners direction to flow this way, but they are a surving independent business, so I'll support them for that! Screw the Starbucks that opened up on 16th & Kansas. Stick to a place where theres some integrity behind it.  One milk used to be thier mantra, so i'm a lil displaced to see soy milk there, but they try hard to keep it real, the staff here is really cool, and the owner still has his heart it in to keep this place running.", "author": "B H."}

Last week, I had a meeting at a school down the street where the bathrooms were locked, so I made a pit stop here afterwards. The barristo poured me a delicious pg tips iced tea (an english brand i don't run across too often) and as I grabbed a tasty peanut butter cookie, he let me know that I could get a refill when I was done.   It was still toasty as usual on the Hill in the late afternoon & amazing light was streaming through the large front windows.  The gallery of photos on the walls were striking but unpretentious, including some portraits of the cafe workers, who are probably students from CCA, the pricey art school down the hill-- which means they are either trust funders or being crushed by massive student loans. You don't even have to acknowledge the 2.0 types at the sidewalk tables if that's not your scene (hey, they probably are yelp designers), but they do have cute dogs.  The inside of the cafe is airy and bright, and you can pick up some arty zines with your coffee.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-17", "description": "Out of all the coffee houses in Potrero Hill Farley's is by far my favorite. Initially, it is shocking that they only have one size of cup and only whole milk but you get over that once you take a sip of their drinks. They are that good to make you not care that they are laden with fat. Even when they are crowded, the simplicity of the Farley's menu makes the line move quickly. There is none of that indecisive ordering that will often turn a  2 minute wait turn into a 10 minute wait. Bottom line is, Farley's produces a great drink and I'll take their fatty latte over a \"not enough foam, burnt espresso bean tasting, let the shot sit too long\" latte any day. Extra star goes to the fact that they have a wide selection of pastries and their beans are fair trade and organic.", "author": "Sierra d."}
