The seating inside is somewhat limited, but we were able to find a space for two at the communal table. The decor is vibrant and fun, making the place quite photogenic - Instagram worthy shots made easy.\n\nFor serious coffee aficionados, Pinhole actually carries and assortment of beans from various roasters. I believe they use Linea for their espresso, Verve for their drip and pour over, with a rotating third option featuring yet another roaster. Very cool.\n\nWe ordered an oat milk decaf cappuccino, regular cappuccino, and matcha custard cake (they have a selection of tasty treats from Third Culture Bakery to enjoy with your coffee). Heads up! For those who are looking for milk alternatives, they don't serve soy milk here. They carry almond milk or oat milk, however.\n\nOn a personal note, I really appreciate the company's attentiveness to customer experiences. I provided some feedback through the Square email receipt, and promptly received personalized follow up messages from the owner, addressing my concerns. Despite my criticisms, the owner replied with professionalism and hospitality - I wasn't expecting it, but I appreciated the conversation. The productive and positive exchange definitely left the door open for an improved experience on our next chance to visit. Overall, a great place to grab a quality cup.", "author": "Roderick T."}

They serve Verve Coffee Roasters, and it seems to rotate from time to time.\n\nThe piccolo comes in a small glass and tasted dark and roasted.  The piccolo is like a combination of a latte and a cortado because of the small size and steamed milk.\n\nAnd you know what makes this place even better??  They serve pastries from Third Culture Bakery!!  The Matcha Green Tea Custard Cake was sooo incredibly good!!  Very soft and delicious, perfectly paired with a drink!\n\nUnfortunately, wifi isn't provided here and I didn't really see outlets either.  Luckily I was using my sister's laptop that is connected to xfinity WiFi so I was able to get some work done still.  Wooden benches can tire your booty out after a while though, but there are a few pillows laying around.  This place seems to promote having conversations and catching up with people or on a good book rather than working on laptops.

Once at the counter, we were greeted and my boyfriend placed an order for the two of us. He asked for a soy decaf cappuccino to which the baristas looked at each other, smirked, and one responded saying that they actually don't have soy, but carry almond milk and oat milk. My boyfriend proceeded with the rest of the order, but was a bit perturbed by the reaction.  We drank our cappuccinos at the cafe along with a green tea pastry.

I usually get to smell the grounds just after grinding. \n\nThe espresso based drinks are usually made from Verve from Santa Cruz.  The espresso drinks are all on point and balanced.\n\nSome items from local bakeries such as Piccino cookies, Midwife and the Baker scones, a and sometimes Black Jet Bakery pop tarts.\n\nIt's a great place to hang out and play with the magnetized board with letters.  Or your children ... or the adults.  Service is great.  Seating is a little limited with a few tables and a communal.  Parking is limited due to this being in a residential neighborhood.

Came here on an overcast Sunday, sat by the window to people-watch. We ordered almond lattes ($4) I'm not sure if it was real almond milk because it tasted so smooth and delicious.. We thought twice about asking the barista to confirm it's almond milk, but ended up sipping away happily instead. Before I knew it, the bottom of the mug was already visible :P They use Verve coffee and pulled very smooth espressos from it. \n\nThe croissant we got to share ($3~) was extremely flaky, rich, fresh, all in a good way.

And so, rather than jumping out of bed to start marinating your ribs for the grill, you put on your North Face jacket, but not before putting on your sweats, socks, UGG boots, and sweater and head out in search for some warm coffee that'll comfort you for a few hours before going back to SF Summer Despondency.\n\nThis was my Memorial Day. And I celebrated with kicking things off at Pinhole Coffee in Bernal in search of trying the well-discussed Supersonic Coffee that's out of Berkeley. Pinhole is probably one of the most eccentric coffee shops I've been to.  Lots of building blocks and magnetic letters to play around with, but also a lot of whimsical art in and around the shop.  I enjoyed my hot brew, having a quick conversation with two very hipster but very nice baristas, and taking in the scenery of families, dogs, families + dogs, and individuals in search of some warm and comforting beverages.

The entire left wall is full of long, colorful rectangular tiles.  It's very \"San Francisco\".  For a Friday afternoon, it was really empty and quiet-which makes it a really nice place for productivity working. The staff here is also really friendly, which is a huge plus.\n\nIn terms of coffee beans, I believe they use 3 different coffee beans-Verve, Linea, and AKA.\n\nThe only downside was that when I went, the Wi-Fi wasn't working (or maybe they don't even have Wi-Fi).

This is my second time here -  That last time, it cost me about 15.00 for two kids hot chocolates, and one item from the bakery case. Despite the crazy prices, I decided to try it again, but the rude attitude will keep me from trying it again. It's too bad:  they carry lots of fancy expensive coffee. The decor is nice, if not a little repetitive in that sort of Flora Grubb-modern-succulent-repurposed-wood-Mission newcomer kind of way. It feels like a Sunset magazine review come to life. That is not a compliment, by the way. I don't want to live in Sunset Magazine. \n\nSome tips for Pinhole:  there is a right way and a wrong way to handle the situation when someone comes in (not knowing you don't have WIFI) just, and only just, to do work on her computer. \n\n1. Be apologetic if she has already paid for her drink when you explain that you don't have WIFI. Don't be smug. A tiny bit of kindness goes a long way. Don't sneer and say \"all the coffee shops I go to don't have WIFI anymore\".  Assistant manager: don't tell your customer that your business is about making money not about people. It might be true, but it sounds awful when you say it right out loud like that. \n\n2. Be kind when you say you can't give a refund when your customer asks for money back on the completely untouched cup of tea, when she explains she now has to go to another spot that has WIFI.  I get it if you didn't want to refund my money.  Fair enough. It's more about how you treated me. You could have had a customer for life for 2.50 instead of someone who will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this place. Which I will. Think about this. You got to keep your 2.50 but you are losing way more money than that. \n\nBTW: I actually am glad some coffee shops are taking out WIFI.  I like the idea of having a place where not every person is on a screen. However, my issue is with the snobby way I was treated.", "author": "Carla G."}

It's a great neighborhood spot and they are super baby-friendly without being obnoxious about it. The baristas will mention how adorable your child is, and there are kids books, but no one lets their kids run wild or take over. Jo Ellen, the owner, is a really sweet and fun woman with a passion for coffee. The baristas are friendly and fast, and the seating is great for conversation. Sometimes we wish they had wifi so you could work there, but I have a feeling that's the point--they probably don't want you camping out for hours. It's definitely more of a meet-up-with-friends, hang out place than somewhere to work.", "author": "Lauren C."}

The decor is thoughtful with interesting art and other things to look at while talking or taking a break from my book.  I like that they don't have wi-fi.  This non laptop farm feeling contributed to the chill vibe.  The woman working behind the counter was extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome.

There are lots of interesting little bits and bobs tucked in every corner, and the colourful wall across from the brewing area will definitely catch your eye. The space itself was fairly large, and has a cool homey vibe to it. I got a latte ($4 something) and was definitely pleased by the quality and coffee art. They also have a variety of cookies and treats to go with your coffee, and also make piccolo's, which is pretty uncommon in most the cafes I've been to. It was pretty empty for an early afternoon, and I'm glad to see that Pinhole is more of a place to hang out than a workspace filled with hipster laptop users! It's pretty likely that I'll be coming back next time I'm in the area :)", "author": "Cindy N."}

The  decor is  sleek yet stimulating with a cool local geography mural in coffee colors and a lovely accent wall that makes everything in front of it look artsy.  The coffee is excellent, high quality, and artistically made. I usually use sugar, but they make it so rich and sweet there is no need.
