I was torn between the classic breakfast burrito and the breakfast sandwich. So I got both, because why not?!? But I have to say the breakfast sandwich was to die for. The bun is out of this world. Then the bacon jam and gooey cheddar cheese and bacon and fried egg. YUMMMM\n\nDONT get me wrong, the breakfast burrito was good. But it was exactly as ordered a classic breakfast burrito. It was good. There's just something about that bacon jam and that bun on the sandwich. \n\nOh and I got a Vietnamese iced coffee because I've been up since 4 AM, and I need a mid day/morning pick me up. \n\nThere's a cute little mechanical pig you can ride.

I don't have a huge sweet tooth, so I'm sure I would have enjoyed this more if I was more of a sweets fan. \n\nI loved the gooey cheesiness of this sandwich and the bun is really a star! The bacon, of course, was great. \n\nThe sandwich was delicious, but not the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. I think the pricing is fair and though the sandwich may look small, it's the perfect amount of food. \n\nIf you're a coffee fan, they have a pretty good Vietnamese coffee.

We both ordered the breakfast sandwich, and I venture to say it's the best one I've ever had. The bun is fluffy and soft but slightly crispy around the edges, the egg is perfectly gooey in the middle, the bacon is crispy and thick and delicious, and the bacon jam is the most perfect balance of salty and sweet. Dear God it was amazing. \n\nThe first time we went, we got iced Vietnamese coffee- YUM!! Creamy and strong and slightly sweet. The next day we got iced Havana coffee and it was somehow better than the iced Vietnamese coffee. Omg. A hint of cinnamon, a tiny bit of chocolate. And omgggg so good. Thank God we don't live in SF or we'd eat there everyday. \n\nService was quick and the staff was great. The guy gave us the coffee recommendations each day and they surely didn't disappoint.

(Apparently two burritos is too much?) I went ahead and did it anyways. Our office lunch delivery arrived by Caviar on Friday, April 20th around 12:30pm.\n\n*Bacon Fries: French fries tossed in herbs, parmesan, spicy olive oil, homemade bacon bits, and bacon jam served with a side of blue cheese vinaigrette ($7.50)\n*Breakfast Burrito: Scrambled egg, pork shoulder, bacon, avocado, and cheddar ($8.50)\n\nI got the breakfast burrito, but also tried some of my coworker's bacon fries. Both items were chock full of bacon and meat. The burrito was stuffed with filling which I appreciated. Not sure if they offer hot sauces at the location, but this was great with some heat. (I always have multiple hot sauces at my desk.) The fries were good, but suffered from the transport time as they were soggy. Still good flavor. Though they didn't deliver the blue cheese vinaigrette, so I was missing that cheesy element.\n\nGreat breakfast burrito. If they were close to work, I'd get it more often.

The restaurant is quite small, with about 4 bar-height tables and a longer counter that can all seat about 20 people.\n\nI ordered the banh mi, while others in my party ordered the breakfast sandwich, cobb salad, bacon cheeseburger, and the cuban.\n\nAs we sat down, we all noticed the crazy amount of flies around our table. After a few seconds of looking around the restaurant, we noticed there were flies EVERYWHERE. They're all over the walls, merchandise (sweater, mugs, etc.) that they sell, napkins, cups, water cooler, everywhere. This made me lose my appetite really quickly.\n\nWhile my Banh Mi sandwich was good, I couldn't get over all of the flies. Additionally, the bacon was really overcooked - not crispy but rather really hard and inedible.\n\nThere are restrooms, but you literally have to go through the kitchen and up some stairs across an extremely greasy floor.\n\nOverall, I'd say the food is good, but the restaurant really needs to put some effort into cleaning the place. I understand that cooking bacon all day and having grease spatter everywhere doesn't help, but I would think it's health hazard to have grease on the floors and allowing flies to breed here.

If you can get here earlier in the day, they serve breakfast items until closing, and they start serving lunch items at 11am. Familiar offerings from the truck, like the bacon double cheeseburger, bacon fried chicken sandwich, and bacon bouquet are all available here, are just as good, and are prepared quite quickly.\n\nBut, while you're at it, why not try some items you haven't had before? They've got a bacon banh mi here, and even salads and chicken, tuna, and turkey sandwiches that are enhanced with bacon. The breakfast sandwiches are to die for as well. I had a daily breakfast special that featured special cuts of cured bacon alongside egg, cheese, and aioli on an English muffin. It went down quickly, but boy was it scrumptious, and at least for me it was worth it.\n\nService is friendly, fast, and professional here, and there's a limited amount of seating at a window counter and at small tables. Endearingly enough, there's an amusement park ride-style pig that you can ride.

I would say about 20 seats. But we stood in the short line and ordered pretty quickly. We got the bacon maple scone and the breakfast burrito (regular, not classic). We sat down at one of the tables and waited for our food. I started on the maple bacon scone, I love scones, but I've never been much of a fan of maple bacon, but let me tell you, it was pretty damn good! Not overly dry, not cakey, it was what I expect of a scone. It even had a pile of bacon up top with some maple drizzled over it. YUM. Finally our food came, and I took one look at that breakfast burrito and instantly fell in love. I love when you can see the distinct layers in food, especially my burritos. Much appreciated. Added the Valencia hot sauce (sits on each table, along with Ketchup, sriracha, and mustard). MA DAM. I only had to take 1 bite to tell it was incredible. Juicy. Took another bite to make sure it was real, and boy was it. My friend devoured it in a split, 2 seconds. I saw another table with fries and it looked like perfection as well, nice size with a crispy outer layer, that looked pretty soft inside. Anyways, I will be back to try the fries, the mac and cheese balls, and the chicken sandwich. They all looked sooooo good.

The name of Bacon Bacon is like... meat that is so epic it just echoes when you say it once. My boyfriend and I live in the Castro District, so we decided to take a nice Sunday stroll here.\n\nWe ordered the Breakfast Sandwich and Breakfast Burrito to split, then the Porky Fries and Bacon Chili to save for later - yes we were feeling ambitious that day. Our food seemed to take forever to prepare. There is also not a lot of seating, so you might have to wait around for a bit and snatch a table when someone leaves. In the meantime, we enjoyed a tasty Hot Havana Latte.\n\nThe wait was so worth it though. The Breakfast Sandwich was my favorite out of all those choices. The egg was messy but the flavor was perfect. How could such a simple sandwich be so good? Would recommend. The other foods we got were also good. Would not recommend saving any of these for later like I tried to do.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Parking is EXTREMELY difficult, so I would recommend either taking public transportation here or finding parking a couple blocks away.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered the bacon breakfast sandwich because we wanted something that had a runny egg in it,plus we were both intrigued by the bacon jam it had. We ended up taking it to go because we were double parked and luckily, Haight and Ashbury wasn't too far away. We drove over there and enjoyed our breakfast sandwiches, but my boyfriend ended up forgetting that the egg was going to be a runny yolk and it exploded all over his car + pants (LOL). The breakfast sandwich was VERY light, especially with the amount of bacon in this sandwich. Definitely something worth getting in the morning! \n\nThe second time we came here,we wanted to order something off the lunch menu and we ended up getting the fried chicken sandwich. I have to say that I wasn't expecting the sandwich to be so big. There was TONS of fried chicken in that sandwich and to be honest, I couldn't finish it.

Can't go wrong here.\n\nService was nice and friendly and seating can be a little limited during lunch rush, I'm sure.

He looked impressed, as if he did not believe that we'd ever make it out here. I remembered distinctively that day when I sent an online review of this place to him, and said, \"you should go there.\" He replied back \"Yes plz\" but he never came here on his own even though this was damn close to his house. He was waiting for me to go with, as it turned out. \n\nBut you see, I had seen their food truck in SoMa, I never paid much attention to it really, until a nice article about the store front showed up. I go where the reviews tell me to go. I'm a follower and not a leader. And I like to stereotype.  You know how some people stereotype Asians, I stereotype the Midwesterners. If you announce to me that you are from Nebraska, Indiana and Iowa, I immediately think you are raised on a farm, harvested corn and ate bacon until you can't stand it any more and then you headed west. I'd be wrong, of course, but I'd be right about him liking bacon, who is one of those (wrongly) stereotyped Midwesterners.\n\nI knew because we had spent weeks last winter discussing bacon. Yes I like to spend time pontificating bacon. \n\nThe restaurant is hidden among a bunch of stately Victorian homes, \"stately\" maybe an overstatement, it's pretty and pristine, and well maintained. Fredrick street is residential, except for Bacon Bacon, there were just bunch of Victorians. You'd think you'd smell the bacon from miles away but you'd be wrong. The store front is not very large. I missed it, he spotted it. Once inside, you'd feel that it's got a bit of an odd combo: They also serve espresso drinks, fanciful ones with their own blend of coffee beans, along side with down home cooking of bacon themed sandwiches.\n\nFor $7, you get a gourmet breakfast sandwich with googy eggs and bacon strips. For a little more, $9, you get the stack of meats piled on with bacon as one of the meats, inside of a fresh roll, yes that's the Cuban and it was wonderful. If you are into pork belly alongside of your thick cut strips of bacon.\n\nAmericano for the after this-piggie-went-to-the-market meal drink. Foamed just right.\n\nInside dining spots are very sparse, but, on a weekend holiday, one could withstand a little bit of a wait and your patience will be rewarded with the front window counter space, where you get the view of the pretty Victorian homes across the street. Turning the other way, you'd often see someone riding the electric pig doing the photo op thing. Earlier, I had mistaken it for the horsey until he asked me to get on top of it like every other tourist. No, thank you, I look ridiculous enough without hopping on that piggy. \n\nI don't think I've ever had a sandwich that tasted this good. \n\n\"It's worth the wait.\" He concluded. \n\nIs it?

Moving from NYC, we've been dying for a good hearty grilled breakfast sandwich but haven't been able to find an ideal one yet.\n\nTheir breakfast sandwich was unique and quite good but I still wouldn't write home to about it.  The fun surprise was when my fianc\u00e9 and I both took a first bite and the perfectly cooked fried egg oozed over our hands. Delicious food is meant to be messy!  It was good. You could taste the bacon jam and the slices of bacon were just the right thickness. I just wish the brioche was a little smaller, otherwise wish the proportion of sandwich ingredients was more balanced. I'd say the bread : ingredient ratio was about 1:1, I think it should be more 1:2 to get more flavor and texture. \n\nGood sandwich overall, we'd probably come back if in the neighborhood next time.  \n\nThe cafe is cute.

Their food is generally pretty fantastic, but I have a few gripes. I've had their fried chicken sandwich a few times and I like it (would give it a solid B), but it honestly leaves a bit to be desired. I wish it had a fried egg or more moisture in the chicken. Also, their garlic fries get a B for the same reason as the sandwich, they're missing that extra oompf.

Naturally, she pulls through and finds the bacon bacon cafe. Note my son and I tried this fine cuisine last year at Eat Real via it's food truck. To say the least it's one of our most favorite trucks.\n\nAeden enjoyed their breakfast sandwich while I got my favorite breakfast item, a breakfast burrito. At $7 it's reasonably priced and filled perfectly. No rice or potatoes which was fine by me. Satisfying, not overwhelming. In my college days this would have been disappointing, however, as a father being more mindful of my diet this was a worthwhile treat. \n\nOn top of that I had an incredible iced Havana latte (mixed with condensed milk). It honestly is the best iced latte I've ever had. I even wondered for a second if some bacon was sprinkled for good luck ;)\n\nThe cherry on top or better yet the apple in the pig's mouth were our parting gifts. The young man staffed as the cashier that morning was a wonderful host. Warm smile and greetings for everyone. Anyway, I bothered him with plenty of questions/conversation during his shift and mentioned why we came to the cafe. As we were leaving he gave my son a piece of chocolate covered bacon for the road and for me a free sandwich card to use at their fisherman's wharf location.\n\nIt was a generous gift for my son and to include me was a bonus (Thank you again if you happen to read this review!).

This seemed like a bacon lover's dream come true, but now that I've been here , I don't need to return and here's why...\n\n1. This place is tiny with very little seating. Read that as noisy, cramped and super annoying when you're sitting next to the mechanical horse thing with screeching children a foot away giggling gleefully ,so you feel like an asshole if you say anything. \n2. It took forever, ok the figurative forever, about 25 minutes, to get 3 sandwiches. That's an average of 8 minutes per sandwich! Understaffed? \n3. It ain't cheap. With all the extra money you're making, how about hiring more staff. See point #2. \n4. Most importantly, it's called Bacon Bacon you'd think they would use quality bacon. Come on!! Instead the bacon was thin, flavorless, barely there and tasted like the cheap Kirkland (aka Costco) brand. Sad face. If they had used Applewood smoked bacon, you'd be able to taste it. Instead everything tasted like pulled pork. if you add hot sauce, you'll definitely not taste bacon and you'll have to change the name of the sandwich cause now it's just misleading. \n\nThe Cuban tasted like pulled pork with melted cheese and bland roasted red peppers. \nThe breakfast burrito tasted like pulled pork with melted cheese and squishy baby food consistency avocado. It was so \"wet\" and greasy, the smell stuck to me for hours. \nThe bacon chicken burger had the thinnest slice of really crunchy overly deep fried Panko crusted chicken breast known to man and by now you could probably guess...the bacon was not noticeable and bland bland bland. \n\nEchoing what another reviewer said, due to blandness, condiments have to be added. Bbq sauce would make more sense as something available to use. \n\nAll these people who gave this place 5 stars are either friends of the proprietors, getting kick backs or living under a rock so anything would taste amazeballs.

They were pissed (I would've been too. That was messed up!) but I was glad I didn't have to wait for them to order either. \n\nI had the bacon fried chicken sandwich and the porky fries. The sandwich was ok but the fries were disappointing. The fries tasted like they were frozen at some point. They weren't crispy, nor were they soggy. They were in that weird in between when fries aren't fresh and so they had the texture of cardboard. Not worth it. Would I go back? Only if I had no other options.", "author": "Susana T."}

The bacon chicken sandwich got great reviews so I ordered it and was sadly disappointed. It was over fried to the point where it was near impossible to bite into and of course this also means it was incredibly dry. It was even a little burnt on the edges. \n\nNow, I will probably try this place again as anything can get messed up once. \n\nBut my current three star review is because when something does go awry where the quality of the food is visually a mess I expect businesses to not serve it.  \n\nSo, overall I am bummed.", "author": "Karina B."}

It's simple but delicious... I mean melted cheese, perfectly cooked thick cut bacon, bacon jam (can I buy a jar please?!) and nice toasty bread? I'm not sure how that can not be amazing!\n\nSo more recently I've been craving a fried chicken sandwich and felt it was the perfect opportunity to visit their actual cafe... If you walk from 16th and mission bart you will definitely feel like this was a very well deserved meal! Lots of uphill walking..\n\nAnyways..\n\nI got their fried chicken sandwich. To my disappointment it was a little dry.. Not bad though! It was still flavorful thanks to all the smokiness from the bacon. Although it wasn't burnt my chicken did come out black..which seems darker than other people's I've seen walking around with at off the grid and in pictures. That could be the reason for the dryness (but why would you serve it to me if that were the case?).\n\nMy boyfriend got their burger plus egg. This threw me by surprise. It was actually realllly good. It was juicy and flavorful..while he liked it he personally preferred my fried chicken sandwich to his burger.\n\nI also got their bacon cookie to go which was good but nothing really special. Needed more bacon and chocolate chips.\n\nThe service is awesome and the cafe itself is hard not to love just by walking in... I mean you can ride a mechanical pig and there's bacon everywhere! \n\nFun and yummy spot to eat at..definitely want to come back for some more bacon goodness (can I get a bacon caramel latte though?!)!", "author": "Melissa C."}

After a quick search of the web and Yelp - Bacon Bacon seemed to be the best option in the area. Boy, I was not disappointed! \nThe menu offered many options for breakfast that looked and smelled delicious on my fellow diners plates, but I had burger on the mind. The breakfast burrito with Chicharr\u00f3nes I saw 1 table over will definitely be my pick next time though. \nThe walkup ordering was super easy and the staff was more than helpful with questions about menu items. If you're looking for a soft drink, your options are limited, but let's be honest you're not coming to a place named Bacon Bacon for the sodie pop. If you're cool with aqua like me, there is a water cooler with cups in the back, so no need to buy a bottle. There are also a variety of teas and coffee beverages if you so choose.\nI ordered the Bacon Bacon Double Cheeseburger with fries and it came to about $16. In a quick 8-10 minutes, it was ready. Seating is fairly limited so it was a perfect timeframe to wait for a table. Get a pic riding the pig while you wait!\nThe burger is prepared to complete perfection - two .5\" patties ensconced in a sharp melty yellow cheddar and sauce sitting atop thick cut meaty greasy delicious bacon and saut\u00e9ed onions all on a soft fluffy brioche roll (the perfect vehicle for all of that deliciousness). The bacon made me believe in bacon again. I didn't consider myself a fan of bacon before coming here, but I have since realized, I just wasn't a fan of the crappy thin, chewy, garbage that surely the pig making it would be ashamed of. Bacon Bacon's bacon is what bacon should be - thick and juicy. This was the best fast casual burger I've ever had - it blows Super Duper, Shake Shack, and Five Guys out of the water.\nThe fries, in my opinion, were fantastic. They were a basic, thicker cut (not steak fry), with shaved parmesan on top - no salt.\n\nI will most certainly be returning to try other menu items.

Though there is a LOT (and I do mean a lot) of meat, it doesn't taste too greasy, and at $9.50 (without tax), you are getting a lot of meat (although the burrito is considerably smaller than other ones of the same cost in the Mission district). The bacon grilled cheese sandwich is also very good: the Texas toast are treated immaculately with bacon jam (definitely beats the fruity stuff any day!) and the melted cheddar cheese with the bacon is perfect for a simple but delicious treat.

If you're looking for heart-stopping and delicious greasy breakfast I haven't found any better than their full menu, and I still drop in for drip coffee at least twice a week. Bacon Bacon is back, and my heart is rekindled!\n\n\n\nOld Review **\n\nTLDNR: Tasty, pricey, cafeteria, friendly, slow, broken stove they won't fix, inferior menu as a result, terrible americano, often out of ingredients \n\nI want to love the Bacon Bacon cafe, I really do.

I fell for you gooey sandwiches, cheap drip coffee and friendly staff, and overlooked your faults like broken wifi, lack of hustle and second rate atmosphere. You charmed me with your $0.10 mechanical pig and cute logo colour scheme, so I dealt with the facts you overcharge for a cafeteria and you're always out of something without posting it. \n\nThey say love helps you pull through the hard times, so when your griddle broke and you had to make a whole new menu of largely inferior foodstuffs we stuck with you. We say you trying and we tried back, supporting you. \n\nI don't know when I started to realise the fire was gone. Maybe the third time I sat around long after I order had been forgotten. Maybe it was when I finally said \"never again\" to the most awful American in town (despite good drip). Maybe it was the second time I waited in line to find out when ordering that you were put of bacon... In a place called Bacon Bacon. \n\nNo, it was when I learned you never plan to fix your grill and get your menu back. I know it's expensive, but you broke my heart.

The guy behind the counter said yes, so that's what I ordered. But it's not what I got.  \nTo be perfectly clear, It would have been just fine if he'd said \"no, we don't do substitutions\" or \"no, we won't do that\". I'd have gotten coffee and a pastry and no harm done.  \nInstead, I got a standard bacon sandwich. The server returned to the counter, had someone from the kitchen pull the bacon off, and brought it back. So I got a really greasy looking sandwich that had been piled in bacon a minute ago, which is gross and definitely not vegetarian.\nI wouldn't have minded waiting for them to make a sandwich that wasn't covered in bacon grease.

When I realized there was a cafe in my neighborhood where almost every option on the menu contains bacon, I freaked with excitement. Not to mention, I often catch the 6 in the morning right outside, so it's a fantastic spot to grab a cup of coffee to sip with my commute.\n\nThat being said... this morning I ordered a breakfast burrito for the first time, and I must say I feel way more hungover than when I woke up this morning. The hell? Their burrito is 95% greasy pulled pork with a small smear of avocado and a tiny portion of eggs and bacon. In fact, it was so greasy that I saturated three napkins with fluorescent orange and had to go back for more. By the time I was half done, the bottom of the second half was literally soggy with the amount of grease that had pooled in the bottom of my to-go container. Yuck!\n\nLast week I tried the cheddar bacon scone, and it was tasty, but I'm pretty sure they sold me a day-old for full price - it was quite stale. \n\nI want to love you Bacon Bacon, I truly do: both the owner (I think she's the owner? A ginger I see there time to time who LOVES to chat) and all of the employees have phenomenally friendly customer service. I also love the pics of neighborhood kids on the stop's old school horse-riding toy. The coffee is cheap and super convenient - I'll always keep coming back for that. But step it up with the food!

Though you have some well priced items I find it impossible not to have the Cuban every time, altho well worth the $10+ sandwych$ but then the porky fries are necessary to the essential Cuban (u will understand why)then the bacon desserts, sometimes caramel, sometimes chocolate, a bacon flavor chain that u just let happen since u didn't wish to interrupt it anyway...\n\nI think there are other items on the menu, I've split halves of other sandwiches when I can spare/share the Cuban. Love the bacon fried chicken too.. but beyond that, me and my bf find it hard to venture further. He's pretty stuck on the Cuban too. It's not the absolute best sandwich in the world necessarily, as this town is not lacking spots, but the special Cuban flavorings+ extra crispy crunchy bits of fried belly with just the right amount of grease light  +perfect light dusting of salty +convenience of proximity... ok so I am absurdly rav right now, no bkfst yet, need to food shop and waiting impatiently for 11a lunch menu to start...  but still I'm only exaggerating slightly.... for today as with most days, it is give me Cuban or give me death..\n\nAnd peeps are super nice there too, they insisted on cooking a fresh batch of sandwiches when I was really late for a pickup order the other day.. rare... tho wouldn't blame them if they ate it;) i just truly hope biz has picked up as they should not ever close shop until we've agreed where to move together next! ps:not promoting pork eating as the piggies are damn cute and smart!

For the purists, you can order a \"bouqet\" of bacon which is exactly what you think it is. \n\nI ordered the bacon burrito which albeit small, had a generous serving of avocado in it. And as if there wasn't enough pork, there was shredded pork shoulder in the breakfast burrito that was cooked and simmered to the point of melting in my mouth. \n\nMy friend's sandwich was a little bit dry, but no worries, we got a side of baconnaise with big fat bacon chunks in it. \n\nTo top it off they had some great coffee to settle all the bacon you just consumed. A great place and great menu for bacon enthusiasts and casual bacon-ners. Could use some seating, oh and maybe leave a bottle of the bacon hot sauce for all to try!", "author": "Kevin T."}

I went to Bacon Bacon for breakfast this morning and I was in bacon heaven.  I love my bacon!  I had the breakfast sandwich, maple bacon scone with bacon jam, and a their drip coffee.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  The bacon jam was a pleasant surprise and is inspiring me to learn how to make it myself but I'm sure it won't be as good as Bacon Bacon's.  \n\nTheir kitchen/storefront is small with little seating, so you will most likely have to take your meal to go or stand and eat at the counters.  The place was very clean and the staff are friendly.  It was worth the drive from Walnut Creek.  For all you bacon lovers, this place is a must.", "author": "Mary K."}

Feel free to skip ahead to the fourth paragraph, I will not know and have a strong constitution anywho.\n\nMy Aunt visits weekly from Berkeley, where she lives at the corner of University and Milivia, top apartment. Now about that Aunt. She recently finished dental school, bottom five percent of her class, but hey everyone who walks is called a dentist (right?!). She also suffers from crippling agoraphobia which, to make a long story short, keeps us local when we want to eat out. Bacon-Bacon's kitchen is just around the corner and it has become our go to place. You might find their cuisine at one of the many food truck gatherings around the city, as the majority of their food is slung via truck, but if you didn't know, they also have a kitchen in Ashbury Heights.\n\nAs a local I've had time to sample the entire menu. If you are a vegetarian, you might want to just sulk your way down to Haight Street, as the only vegetarian option is a parfait (I think... now I'm questioning my knowledge of the menu... look what are doing to me veggie-lovers, I hope you are happy!). But if you do eat meat you like bacon, and you've come to the right place.\n\nNow, for the omnivores who are reading on, enough with autobiographical nonsense, let's talk about the food. The bacon in each dish is always perfectly cooked. Their kitchen is consistent. Each dish is also clever, some might call it a \"foodie\" take on bacon-y comfort food. But I'm not calling it that. Don't put too much thought into what you order, as everything is excellent. If possible order extra, or with a buddy or two split your order so you can get a good sampling of as many dishes as possible.\n\nThat said, I do have favorites. For breakfast I love their standard bacon and egg sandwich. Quick warning, be prepared to manage the tasty egg yolk as you take your first bites, it can cause some difficulty if you aren't anticipating it. Also, you really need to order a maple bacon scone. If you have been there before and haven't had one, go ahead and punch yourself in the face (or do something nonviolent that will help you remember next time) as you have been missing out on bacon awesomeness. This is the best scone I have ever had; all other scones should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nFor lunch, I usually mack on their LGBT (best sandwich name ever). It's like a BLT, but it has goat cheese to complete the flavor profile and clever name. Or I go for their pastrami sandwich. It has a run of the mill name, pork belly, pastrami, cheese, and an olive red pepper relish that brings it a whole nother plane of kick-buttness. \n\nTo top it all off, they have great customer service. They are friendly, cook everything to order, and routinely serve excellent meals. I am a big fan of this place, and so is my Aunt. I give it my overwhelming endorsement.", "author": "Mac B."}

You can tell the ingredients are all the best possible.  All of the ingredients compliment each other perfectly.  The bacon is thick and cooked perfectly.  Not rubbery or overly cooked.  The bacon jam gives the sandwich a slight sweetness and makes it even richer.\n\nThey have great coffee too, which is a nice surprise.

With a little salt to balance the bitterness of the broccolini and more red peppers to add sweetness, this sandwich could be improved.

Only in America is it possible to have a cafe menu where 1/3 of the items are just various ways to prepare strips of bacon: maple, chicken fried, regular bacon, and 4 others I can't recall. One order of The Flight bouquet (a sampling of their 7 preparations for bacon strips) is a heart attack waiting to happen according to a calorie counter, that puts the entire order equivalent to one day's worth of sodium and over a day's worth of saturated fat. There are real food items for breakfast and lunch but given that I already ate 6 strips of bacon (left one for tomorrow to demonstrate restraint), I figure that I should give Bacon Bacon a least a week's rest. My only qualm is that they close at 3 pm. Who says a bacon craving can be limited to only the mornings and afternoons?!?!", "author": "Gwen L."}

I got the Bird, which had turkey, chicken fried bacon (oh yeah), avocado and purple cabbage. It was meaty, filling and delicious. I also shared an order of the fries which had pulled pork, bacon and hot peppers on it. It was a guilt-inducing amount of food and calories, but again, worth it. \n\nThe space is clean and welcoming (though a bit small) and it required a lot of hill climbing to get there, but that's probably a good thing considering the food. The staff was incredibly friendly as well. My friend's daughter made a bit of a mess, spilling some food on the floor, and they didn't bat an eye, just thanked us for coming by. \n\nWill definitely be heading back there soon to try out some of the other sandwiches.", "author": "Tae K."}

This is more of a counter eats place, or takeout, and obviously, it is full of bacon. They advertised some yummy looking mexican bacon hot chocolate, but they were out. They were also out of some tasty looking scones. They did have potato balls, which they'd just invented the thursday before. They were yum, made out of mashed potatoes fried with a little bacon inside. The guy said he's still perfecting the recipe, they were a work in progress, but tasted good to me! I must say, i'm not really a bacon fan, personally, but I just went because it was there and who knows it may have changed my taste buds and i just wanted to go with the flow. My friends had the pork belly breakfast sandwich and the almost vegetarian breakfast sandwich (which yes, has bacon) and enjoyed them. I also had the almost vegetarian. LOL it wasn't for me. I can vouch that it's good if you enjoy bacon but if not, it's my fault for being there. Fresh squeezed OJ was also thick and delish! The sandwiches were on the small side and my friends ended up sharing a dessert crepe elsewhere, so you may want to get your OWN potato balls with your sandwich instead of sharing them btwn 3. ppl. Friendly, fast service. It's a shame some neighbors are trying to shut them down. Rude! I hope they don't.

The fries, themselves, seemed a tad stale.\n\nMy friend, on the other hand, ordered the Free Bird, which she complained was too dry and the bacon-fried bird lacked any taste of bacon.\n\nPerhaps it was an off day for them or the fact that we did not order anything with a pure strip of bacon.\n\nI am still intrigued to try other items on their menu, but in due time.", "author": "Jason N."}

That was a big bonus.  We ordered the BBQ Pulled pork sandwich and the breakfast burrito, side of porky fries.  The sandwich was packed with three styles of pork, pulled, belly, and bacon.  The sauce was on the sweet side.  The roll nothing special but I didn't feel it was grocery store quality either.  Not the best pulled pork I've ever had, but definitely up there.  The breakfast burrito was very good.  Eggs nice and hot. Needed more avocado, would have paid more if I knew there would be so little.  The side of porky fries was ok, really the reason I couldn't stretch the review to be a five star, that and each item was good but not the best ever.  The fries were nice and crispy, but not enough of them.  The pork thrown in was a good sampling, but nothing really stood out.

We stop by the Frederick storefront as frequently as we can on weekends and are SO glad they're now open on Sundays!  Note - it's not always super easy to find parking around there, as it's smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood, but whatever - hop on the N line, take a bus, or circle the block because IT'S WORTH IT!   I'm a huge fan of the breakfast sandwich, which is an egg over easy with cheddar cheese, lots of delicious, thick-cut bacon, and bacon jam on the most delicious roll!   Never a fan of runny eggs, I order mine with scrambled and they have always been happy to oblige.   Bacon jam sounded weird at first, and admittedly, I did order the sandwich once without it, but never again.  It totally pulls the sandwich together and is delicious!     Otherwise, the bacon cheddar scone is also really good.  If you're a bacon connoisseur, you would probably enjoy the bacon bouquet, which is just a bunch of bacon, wrapped up together, ready to eat. :)   I have yet to go there for lunch, but the menu looks divine so it's on my list.  The storefront is teeny tiny, but there are stools and there's room to eat at the countertops.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-03", "description": "Bacon Bacon's web-presence via Yelp, Facebook, Twitter, the establishment's actual site, and other media outlets provide a body of messages and reviews that are not entirely on the same page. The questions raised by their virtual persona warrant further investigation. First and foremost, one might wonder how a restaurant survives in the organic/vegetarian/vegan obsessed food culture of San Francisco with a menu that is made up entirely of pork-based dishes. To answer this query, an initial introduction is provided by the company's website, baconbaonsf.com, where the clean and quirky aesthetic suggests a sensitivity to a design oriented market as well as their location in the famous Haight/Ashbury neighborhood. Based on these queues, an interested patron may guess that Bacon Bacon is more aligned with serving up novelty rather than just a greasy comfort food. The company's roots in the food truck tradition, where contradicting dishes, such as a pad-thai taco, might draw hordes of hungry diners, further re-enforces this deduction. Upon visiting Bacon Bacon at their physical space, customers are greeted with a boutique caf\u00e9, more hip coffee shop than gritty BBQ joint. The food it's self is very much in keeping with the image provided by the company. Although some reviewers suggest the fare is underwhelming, it is more accurate to describe the food as simple. According to general consensus, the dishes taste fresh and straightforward with the creative inclusion of some bacon-related feature to provide the restaurant's signature flair.  That is to say every aspect, from the warm maple-bacon scone, to the dainty track lighting, to the clean and simple website, ensures the entire experience provided by Bacon Bacon is satisfyingly cohesive.", "author": "Matthan C."}
