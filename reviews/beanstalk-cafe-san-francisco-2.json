I don't mind the hike up the hill.  I made a mistake though.  From Yelp, it appeared the place didn't open until 8 but I think it really opened at 7 so I wish I had come earlier than I did.  Second mistake, I think this business- well it has definitely expanded taking over a second shopfront when it used to be just half the size but I think perhaps the success of the business either led to it being sold or under different management.  I did not see the Asian husband/wife team from before and instead of owners, it seemed to be employed staff.  Nothing wrong with that, just a majorly different and unexpected vibe.\n\nSo the reason I came back was that although I am a huge fan of the breakfast sando, I really wanted to try the toast cup which I never had before.  I didn't even look for it on the menu or do a quick visual scan so it was quite a surprise when I returned to my room, and spilled my cappucino to find that it was tiny.  The toast part of it was different as well.  In past visits, I remember seeing them roll out a slice of actual sandwich bread for the toast and I'm not sure but thought it was two eggs with the bacon.  This toast was still good but not the sandwich bread and it was only one egg.  I finished it in two bites and was left wanting more.  \n\nThis whole visit was a bit of a bust.  If you've never been before, I would still strongly recommend it to try but if you've been before, you too may be in for a surprise.", "author": "Maria K."}

I got the pour over Colombia coffee which was pretty decent but nothing special.\n\nThe real reason to come here are the cragel sandos. Cragels may just be another way of throwing a croissant at another breakfast item (remember the cronut?), but it's actually pretty good. The best way to describe it is a flakey, buttery bagel. If croissants are just too decadent for you, the cragel is for you! I got the bacon cragel sando, which took some time to make. The prices are a little high for what is basically a bagel sandwich but we're not at avocado toast territory just yet!\n\nOverall, this is a cozy and hip little coffee shop that is worth trying for their food.

She nodded yes and kept motioning with her fingers to give it to her. \n\nUm. Okay? If that was not my cousin- ewwwwww!

Attached you can find 4 photos of the places I went along with the drinks I ordered. To the business order, sometimes things appear one way when they're actually the other. Stop making assumptions, especially when they might be influenced by your own biases. I was not trying to leech, I was literally just full from the two bobas I'd had before and the burrito I had at Tacorea. Sigh. \n\nUPDATED REVIEW: after the business owner replied, I'm updating this. Even if it was 45 minutes, this response is actually disgusting. Adding the screenshots in case they try to change them since they're clearly so messed up with this unprofessional response. Want to also note I was in town for an interview with a large tech company that's paying for all my expenses. Money was not exactly sparse in this instance? And in New York, the city that's supposedly ruder, it's fairly common practice to sit for a while and order when you want/need. Guess the same courtesy doesn't apply here? \n\nOLD REVIEW: \n\nThe staff was SO rude. I was in town for a day and stopped by while I was traveling around SF. I was hopping from one coffee/boba shop to another and was pretty full so I was waiting a bit until I ordered and sat down. (You can even see that I had checked in at several places beforehand on yelp) \n\nOne of the staff who was also sitting (not even behind the counter) went to me and asked if I was using the WiFi, which I wasn't - I was using my personal hotspot because I knew better than to ask if I could have the password if I hadn't ordered yet? She said i shouldn't be using the WiFi, which again, I was NOT. So she starts to grill me about ordering something in a super rude tone. I tried to explain that what was going on, but of course she wasn't having it so I told her I'd leave.  \n\nI pulled out yelp both because I was looking for another place to go and also because she kept hassling me so I was going to comment on how rude she was. This is when she actually started to lose her shit. She started yelling at me about going on yelp. Literally yelling at me, so I got up immediately and called a lyft to leave. As I'm leaving, she's still yelling at me.\n\nI'm waiting outside and she comes outside with HER PHONE to take pictures of me. Unbelievable! Which is why I took a picture back - how on earth did this woman think this was okay?? \n\nShe starts yelling at me more as I'm taking pictures back of course, and then of course it turns into a yelling match between the two of us. Unbelievable! I've never had a staff or even worse, a business owner, be this blatantly rude to me. \n\nHonestly would not be surprised if she saw an Afro-Latina woman and got suspicious because I really don't understand how my presence was so upsetting? The place was mostly empty.", "author": "Lesley C."}

They didn't go cheap on the eggs I had quite a bit on my sandwich and just enough cheese as well. The price was pretty high for a small sandwich, though. I suppose the prices in dt sf are pretty high everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this place if you don't have a little one with you. Can't comment on the coffee as I did not try it.

We got here at 1:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon while shopping in Union Square. The place is well-lit and has a wide variety of Korean-fusion style sandwiches (many vegetarian options) and coffee. We got the Bulgolgi Beef sandwich and Spicy Pork sandwich. The Spicy pork was better but both were super good. The beef is paired with a provolone (i think) cheese and Spicy Pork was with cheddar - good combos. The bread was perfect and there was fresh veggies like arugula. It seems like a decent place to study as they have free wifi and food and coffee to keep you fueled. The price is not cheap, however, at $10.25 for our sandwiches. The vegetarian options are just as expensive as the meat ones which is surprising. $22 for two sandwiches was kind of a lot but hey it's in the touristy part of the city.", "author": "Shannon W."}

Now that made sense for the $4.25 Grilled Cheese and the $9.75 Bul-go-gi Beef Sandwich, but for some reason, I was in the mood for egg salad. You ever have one of those moods...the egg salad mood? Maybe it's a second childhood thing or a subconscious memory of a kind chicken...or maybe you just need a mayo fix. Anyhow I ordered it thinking it would be like the one's I used to get at Lee's Deli where it was overstuffed between two slices of yeasty white bread.\n\nAs laptoppers took over most of the tables next to the window, I sat at my lonely table next to the restroom for about ten minutes waiting for a sandwich I thought would take about thirty seconds to make. They don't have Diet Coke...yes, it's one of THOSE kind of places, so I picked up a can of San Pellegrino Limonata, the kind that has the little useless wrapper on top, and of course I had to get chips. Not Lay's mind you but a bag of Deep River Aged Cheddar Horseradish Flavored Kettle Cooked Potato Chips (photo: http://bit.ly/2lH5nEG). That was a mouthful...the name, not the chips so much.\n\nMy $9.75 Egg Salad Sandwich finally arrived looking nothing like the lunchroom staple from days of yore. Hard-boiled egg mixed with mayo, yes, but also arugula, lettuce tomato, onion, and cheese. It was all encased in a crusty organic wheat roll, and yes, you guessed it...it was hot. Hot egg salad (photo: http://bit.ly/2llkhzB). All the ingredients seemed right, but hot egg salad seemed so wrong like repealing transgender rights or enforcing Muslim travel bans. Yes, that kind of wrong. But I finished it without complaint at least until now. \"All sandwiches served hot\". They mean it. No exceptions. Is Lee's Deli still open?\n\nFOOD - 2.5 stars...nice ingredients but hot egg salad isn't right\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...compact, light cafe appears to attract the young and fat-fingered\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...OK, not that friendly\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I'm guessing the \"real\" hot sandwiches are more satisfying, right?", "author": "Ed U."}

The coffee is delicious - I usually go for just an americano or espresso, no milk necessary for their beans! \n\nThe one downside is that their music is really obnoxious, constant top 40 of the worst pop songs around, and some of the songs were repeated over and over.

There was a short line, and I ordered an egg & sausage cragel sandwich and a cappuccino when I got to the front. I was told that there would be a 10-15 minute wait for my food, which was fine.\n\nNote: The cragel is just a croissant shaped like a bagel. Essentially you're just getting a warm croissant sandwich, but the shape actually holds the sandwich together a lot better.\n\nI got my cappuccino about 5-10 minutes after ordering. It was bitter, and overall just meh. I would get my coffee somewhere else next time. The big down side is that they only had one person making the sandwiches, despite it being pretty busy, and it wasn't until around 25 minutes later that we got our food. Much later than I was originally told. It seems like they could use some improvement in their setup to be more efficient in making the food.\n\nThe cragel itself was crispy on the outside and worth trying. The filling ratio was mostly egg, so I couldn't really taste the cheese or the sausage as much. A little more cheese or sausage would've been nice, though I love eggs, so I didn't mind too much. Overall, the sandwich was tasty, but nothing amazing.\n\nExpected a little more from such a high overall rating, but not bad.", "author": "Sara L."}

The line, unfortunately, was quite long, and we had come here to avoid a different line. It wasn't a big issue, and the line quickly moved. It seemed like there was some sort of problem with the cafe yesterday (when I went), though, as the employees seemed dazed and confused, and the poor (what seemed to be) owner at the cashier was trying to tell them all what to do and how to do it after an order messup that spiraled into a snowball effect for other orders. I felt truly bad for the manager, as she had to direct all of her employees and looked tired. Because of this it was a bit of a longer wait. When she asked us for our order, though, she was very sweet and made sure everything was in order. We sat down and waited for our order. The employees were again a bit confused when looking for us to give us our order, but the manager did make sure that we got our food. We ordered three cragels (croissant + bagel) with cream cheese, two coffees, and a hot chocolate. The cragels were absolutely delicious and were the perfect blend of the two different breads. The hot chocolate was equally great, and the coffee, I was told, was good as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-26", "description": "The cragel isn't necessarily a revolutionary breakfast food, but Beanstalk does it particularly well. This small cafe is situated on the border of San Francisco's Nob Hill section, close to Union Square. It's usually very busy, and consequently, difficult to secure a table, so it's better to arrive earlier on the weekends if you plan to stay and eat. If I had to guess, I'd say that the entire establishment could only accommodate between fifteen and twenty customers at a single time.\n\nMost people seem to substitute cragels for bagels (which they also offer) to form breakfast sandwiches, but the cragels are great on their own as well. Buttery and flaky, their texture on the outside emulates that of croissants. The inside, slightly denser, matches the consistency of bagels, and is even a bit chewy.\n\nAs for the coffee, it's sourced from Contraband, a well-known neighborhood spot located just a short distance away. Because of their arrangement, this cafe is a rare gem, offering both a good cup of coffee and a solid sandwich or pastry. Unfortunately, this also means that they run out of certain items fairly quickly.

I came on a Sunday morning around 10:00am and the cafe was pretty busy but I didn't have to wait a long time to order. \n\nAMBIANCE: \n- The interior is just like any cute cafe, bright and airy. \n- There are not many tables only about 6 or so you really have to be on the lookout to see if any diners are leaving their table so you can claim their seat. \n\nFOOD: \n- Cragel sandwich with sausage: This was sooo delicious! The combination of croissant and bagel was even better than I was expecting. The top is croissant-like with it's flaky and buttery taste but the sandwich is also more hearty like a bagel than a croissant. The sandwich is filled with fluffy scrambled eggs, chunks of sausage, and melted cheese. Paired with some hot sauce (which they'll give you upon your request), you have the perfect hot breakfast sandwich! \n- Drip coffee: I just got a normal black drip coffee to go with my sandwich and it was just your normal cup of black coffee, nothing too special. \n\nSERVICE: \n- The staff is really friendly! \n\nI'm really pleased with my experience here and I would definitely come by for another cragel if I'm ever in town again! :)", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I'd definitely recommend using Caviar if you're too busy (or too lazy) to get food, or if there's a cafe or restaurant that you've been dying to go to but it's not convenient for you to visit. Some of the prices may be a little higher than in the actual restaurant and delivery fees may be a little steep depending on how far it is, but it's super convenient and the food is fresh. \n\nI decided to try out Caviar for the first time with Beanstalk Cafe and ordered the bulgogi sandwich, warm, with no cheese, no mayo and the spicy Korean side on the side (yes, I complicate orders). Came out to be about $15 including taxes, tip and delivery. Delivery was quick and the sandwich arrived exactly as requested :)\n\n-BULGOGI SANDWICH ($10.50) - 4/5 \n[sweet vinegar cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, mayo, spicy Korean sauce; served on acme roll]\nMmmm warm, crunchy, toasted bread filled with a solid portion of bulgogi. The sweet/spicy sauce gives it lots of flavor and a good kick, though I would've liked it a touch spicier. No mayo needed in my opinion, but I'm generally not a fan of the creaminess mayo adds to sandwiches. As much as I love the proportion of protein though, I wish the sandwich had more veggies as well.

I only wish they had put more spicy sauce and that they'd pickled the cabbage and carrots to give it a nice lift. \n\nThe bagel sando looked like a regular and tasted like an unremarkable egg and bacon sandwich in a bagel. Tasty but nothing to write home about. Seating is sparse but accommodates about 5 or 6 and if you're so lucky to grab a seat outside when the weather is sunny, enjoying a good sandwich in the sun is a luxury.", "author": "Tim L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-19", "description": "One of the better food options if you're in or around Union Square, and like warm, fresh sandwiches. They have mostly sandwiches on the menu, so if you're in the mood for salad or something else, you may want to go elsewhere. This is more of a grab-and-go place - they have a few seats along the wall and window, and 2-4 seats outside.\n\nSandwiches will run you about $9-10, and they have a wide selection of breakfast sandwiches, Korean-inspired sandwiches; you'll have a selection of about 10-15 things to choose from. They also have a croissant/bagel egg sandwich that looked delicious, but since we had just come from working out, we opted for a slightly healthier option.\n\nI got the Korean Bulgogi Sandwch which comes with cucumbers, bulgogi beef, spicy Korean Sauce on a crusty French baguette that was airy, but not too airy, crunchy on the outside, and was just fresh and delicious. The proportion of filling to bread was good, and it was spicy but not overly spicy. I'd definitely get this again, and seems like one of the few fusion-flavored sandwiches you can get in the city, and certainly very unique.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Breakfast Sandwich which had bacon, eggs, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, arugula, on the same bread as mentioned above. It was delicious, and seems healthier than a cheese & egg sandwich on a bagel, since the bread is slightly less dense and it includes some vegetable and arugula. I only intended on taking one bite of my boyfriend's sandwich to try, but ended up swapping half of my sandwich for half of his, because it was so good. You can't go wrong with bacon, egg, and cheese.\n\nAll in all, a great sandwich spot, especially if you want something to just grab & go or want to order via Caviar or GrubHub, although I feel like these sandwiches are probably best when they are fresh and hot, just out of the toaster oven. I'd definitely come back here again to try some of their other sandwiches or to grab a coffee.", "author": "Christina L."}

It was all right, but not great.\n\nThe mint mojito iced coffee was more like iced coffee with a few squirts of chocolate mint syrup. Not even comparable to Philz, so I'm not quite sure why the cost was similar at $4.50. I think they could've set expectations better by not calling this mint mojito in the first place. Minus a star. \n\nFYI, they do serve Contraband coffee, so for a local coffee fix, this is your spot. \n\nThe toast cup was good, but pretty small and baked inconsistently. While pre-cooked, they still tasted nice and fresh after being warmed up. I bought two, and the egg yolk in one of them was slightly runny and orange, while the other one was well done and a pale yellow color. I like to take my eggs pretty seriously, and that feeling when one doesn't get that slightly runny egg while someone else does, is quite a let down. Minus a star for that. It was also pretty pricey -- mostly for the novelty or if you're on the run. \n\nThe price of the bulgolgi sandwich also seemed a bit high, considering I've gotten a high quality banh mi for less than $8. I may still try it to quench the foodie curiosity in me though. The prices could be a function of the location, which is close to union square. \n\nIt's a small shop with about four chairs and three bar stools.

I came here on the first day I came to San Francisco for breakfast with my boyfriend and the expectation and the hype here did not let me down. I have read many reviews here centering around Beanstalk Cafe so I decided to give it a try here. This place is very lovely. The outside was beautiful and it made me look really cute compared to the other buildings surrounding it. Here is my evaluation for it. \n\nBasic Facts-\n- I came here and I ordered a toasted cup and a milk tea. The toasted cup here is what they are famous here for and it is about $4.50. The milk tea here is about $4.00.\n- My boyfriend got a Polgulgi (Korean BBQ) sandwich that was about $5.50. \n\nPros-\n- The people there are very friendly! \n- The seats there is limited but if you find a seat, it's pretty nice to hang out here. The atmosphere is wonderful. One of the best cafe I have seen in a really long time. I wish they had this back in New York City. \n- The names here for the food is very unique and creative as well. \n- The food here is extremely good and tasty. \n\nCons-\n- There are limited seats. Only one table and about 5 other seats near a bar like table. It was kind of crowded in the morning because everyone was ordering and trying to grab a seat as well. \n- In my opinion, the milk tea was not that good. My boyfriend enjoyed it but to me, it did not taste like the milk tea you would usually get in Chinatown. It was a bit bland and unsweetened. When I did tell them to sweetened my milk tea, they put (get this) RASPBERRY bump into my milk tea to make it sweeter.", "author": "Ashley Z."}

I had a sip of my friends iced mojito coffee which was unique and tasty, overall this little joint was pretty good and had some interesting ideas.

Although they have a wide variety of sandwiches, I decided to keep it simple and ordered a grilled cheese with pepper jack cheese. I waited for about five minutes--no sandwich. They were busy, so it was totally understandable. Waited another few minutes before I decided to ask where the sandwich was. Turns out someone else walked up and grabbed it! Could not believe it. The kind woman who took my order apologized and had the guys make my sandwich right away. She threw in a drink as she handed me my sandwich, still apologizing, even though it wasn't her fault! Anyway, it was the best grilled cheese I've ever had. Seriously amazing. Pesto and just the right amount of cheese. Bread was perfectly grilled (panini style, I think). I can't wait to go back tomorrow. Totally worth more than the $4 I paid. \n\nUpdate: returned today to get another grilled cheese. She remembered me. I'm not sure how on earth she can remember one person out of so many customers. Any way. Sandwich is awesome agin today.", "author": "Patricia J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-24", "description": "Been here a few times; this place is fine as another neighborhood cafe; go in knowing some of the stuff below to help calibrate expectations. Also keep in mind it's quaint seating: 3 chairs around a small table and a few bar stools.\n\nToast cup is cute, but I agree that it's more a novelty as others have mentioned. Happy to have tried it once, but don't feel the urge to order it again. [Owner Collin would like to stress that it is simply supposed to be \"a good source of protein as a morning food item\", but the convenience of toast+egg+bacon in a compact form factor doesn't convince me to retry given the straightforward flavors.] It did inspire me to try making my own though, which was fun! The bread is flattened very thin here, which is hard to replicate with just a rolling pin and a hearty wheat instead of white. ;) If you're just looking for a reasonably priced, tasty meal on the go, a number of good banh mi shops will get you a filling sandwich for an extra $1 or two. But now that it's gotten you through the door, what else is there to order?\n\nI've tried the breakfast sandwich to-go. The breakfast sandwich was a bit of a disappointment for the price; they microwave the egg to reheat it, although their bacon is toasted in an oven. And the arugula component is token at best. [Collin tells me to ask for more arugula next time; duly noted, but not noticeable at first with a takeout order. Also, they don't have a hood, so can't legally cook inside, darn.] Best part of this sandwich is by far the crispy yet soft bread, but for $8.43 you might as well try something more uncommon: the bulgogi sandwich.\n\nI tried the bulgogi to-go another day, but was misled again a little by the older pictures on yelp. Looks like there's a lot more arugula in the earlier pics; both sandwiches skimped big time in comparison. And iceberg lettuce kind of sucks as a green in a sandwich to-go: the least nutritious of lettuces, it adds little but texture to a sandwich in the best case, and becomes a limp wet addition in the worst. On the upside, they do give you plenty of meat, moreso than you'd find in a typical banh mi since I mentioned it earlier. But it lacked that grilled caramelization on the meat edges that comes to mind when I think of bulgogi, oh well. [Collin says they braise the beef; thanks, so that explains that! I'm not asking to change the core recipe, but be aware if you had grilled in mind like I did at first.] They use the same tasty bread as in the breakfast sandwich, but that alone can't carry a $9 sandwich.\n\nI've also tried both their mojito iced brew and their regular. Unfortunately my palate apparently isn't refined enough to appreciate this ice brew? I'll take philz' mojito pour over as a guilty sweet indulgence over this, haha. Oddly enough, the regular ice brew kinda reminds me of flavors I might have run into in a cocktail (unsweetened)...what is it, maybe absinthe?? I think that's the initial feeling that hit me when i first sipped the regular each time; kinda strange to me in a coffee. Have not had this impression in other cold brews elsewhere; must be the beans...nice to hear though that it's striking a chord with other more experienced coffee drinkers though!\n\nP.S. Turned off by my banh mi comparisons? Ok, other examples of sandwich shops that strike a great flavor:price ratio include M&L Market near Duboce for a more deli-like sandwich, or Bakesale Betty in Oakland for fried chicken. If money were no object, I'd do places like Lunchpad and Sentinel more often, or maybe even Terminus, V-105, and OTD!", "author": "Linus W."}

It wasn't a big deal but I like the option of not having melted cheese on my sandwich.They have coffee, juice, sweet and savory items.\n\nIf I was staying in the Nob Hill area again, this would probably be my to go place for a non sit down place / to go.", "author": "Stanley C."}

When I travel, this is exactly the kind of unique, delicious, low-key place I love to find. I tried the mojito iced brewed coffee, which was very lightly sweetened and had the perfect amount of cream. And sure, the coffee was great, but let's just have a brief moment of silence for the Toast Cup...\n\nOkay. That was fun. It's amazing! They're small, so if you have a large appetite, I might recommend ordering two. It's a thin bread cup with cheese, bacon, and an egg. The cheese was a very welcome surprise! Their sandwiches are also amazing. The bread is perfectly crusty on the outside, but sandwich soft on the inside. \n\nAlthough I didn't try everything on the menu, I can definitely say that you absolutely need to try this place!", "author": "Jordan S."}

The place seems to be known for the Spicy bulgogi sandwich and there are numerous pics of it on yelp.  I found it on my mobile app and knew I had to stop here for food.  Was feeling tired and groggy from last nights Yelp Celebratory drinking and this was my quick fix. \n\nHad the Green Tea and a touch of some raw sugar in it to pep me up.  Paired well with the sandwich no doubt.  The cheese was melted and gooey just the way I like it and was not overpowering in the sandwich.  Very easy to eat and clean.  I finished it quick and was on my way to shop down in Union Square LOL.  I felt like I had energy to take me through the rest of the day and was ready to continue partying on our Epic Cruise ship around the bay that night, HAHA.  \n\nQUICK BITE PERFECTION!  True SF Gem!", "author": "Kenny P."}

Everything from the fresh crispy rustic and local bread, the sweet and savory beef, to the fresh vegetables (fresh tomatoes, lettuce+arugula, onions) was delicious. The sandwich comes hot n' toasty and full of flavor.\n\nThe second time I visited, I had a serious craving for the same bulgogi sandwich I had during my first visit. Unfortunately, I arrived too early in the morning and the bulgogi still had an hour left to cook. They suggested their next most popular hot sandwich and it was the spicy chicken sandwich. That sounded pretty delicious, so I opted for that. Everything about this sandwich was similar to the bulgogi sandwich, the only thing that really differed was the meat. The chicken had a good level of spiciness to it and it was also wonderful.\n\nFor the coffee, I tried the Iced Mojito cold brew coffee. It's made with the cold brew coffee they make (Contraband beans) with a little bit of vanilla and fresh mint leaves (you can also ask to make adjustments to sweetness, milk, etc). If you've ever had Philz Coffee's Mint mojito iced coffee, it's very very similar to this. It's refreshing and soo yummy.\n\nFor the space, it's a very very small coffee shop. There are about 4 seats indoors with one small table and a couple of seats with a narrow wall-mounted counter area. And there's a small bench right outside. On a busy day, it might be difficult to find seating. I would suggest ordering to-go and bringing your delicious sandwiches and coffee down to  Union Square and enjoying it there. You'll probably have better luck finding some seats there (and it's only 2 blocks away)!\n\nTL;DR:  You need to try the bulgogi sandwich (sweet and savory korean style beef in a sandwich)", "author": "Monica T."}

The service is as fast as you can get for a busy little shop (5-10 minutes for sandwiches, 2-3 minutes for drinks). The coffee was kept fresh each mornings.  Best of all, the sandwiches are what kept me coming back.  The cragel (bagel + crossiant) breakfast sandwich was what I expected.  An airy, flaky, buttery cragel bun combined with chedder cheese and bacon goodness.  The spicy Korean chicken sandwich was a fusion masterpiece (it wasn't burning hot spicy). The pastrami sandwich was filling and had a great peppery taste. I also tried the banana bread which was baked fresh that day. It was very moist, sweet, and well-balanced with walnut bits--greatness.

I expected the sandwich to be a little bigger when I first got it but after eating it, I was satisfied! The spicy sauce flavor was not too kimchi-ish garlicky spicy at all and only a smear of sauce which I enjoyed. Both sandwiches came with red onions, arugula, tomatoes and a little bit of cucumbers. I liked the bulgogi better than the RB but the RB was really good too! Coffee is excellent here. I tried both hot and iced and both were good. Would definitely come back on my next visit to frisco! My first visit I tried the breakfast cup and thought it was good, but I got it around noon when it prob wasn't as fresh as in the am. The Bread Seemed a little rubbery and wish there was more bacon although the bacon was a thick slice and good. A neat concept and I would try it again if early in the am when fresh.", "author": "Sandy G."}

They've done things like lower the shades and bring me water even without me asking! They also will recognize \"regulars\" and are always fun and willing to chat.\n\nIt's pretty small inside, but there usually isn't a wait for lunch and seats are almost always open, even though it is very limited seating. The decor is also super cute, which is a plus. They also have a bench outside, if you wanted to have a cup of coffee outdoors.\n\nTheir coffee drinks are delicious and use really high quality beans. It's a little pricier than other places (en par with Starbucks prices) but is better tasting coffee and they have a lot of non-dairy options.

The lady behind the counter greets her and takes her order. All normal. I walk up to the counter and she doesn't greet me and continues to stare into the payment iPad with a blank and rude face while I place my order. \n\nAn African American fellow walks in later and wanted to know what street the store was on cause he was lost. Granted the guy barged in and announced the question quite loudly. The lady gave an annoyed face expression and was about to respond (probably rudely) but another kind customer in the store replied the answer before she was given the chance.\n\nAnother Caucasian lady then walks in while I wait for my Cragel. She greets her with a smile and a hello. The Caucasian lady asked if there was a bathroom she could use and was not there to buy a single thing. The lady behind the counter replied that there was no bathroom in the store and continues the friendly manner.\n\nThis type of stuff leaves me bewildered since the worker/owner herself is Asian, I am guessing Korean based on the store's menu.\n\nAvoid this place if you don't happen to be the right skin color.

This very small cafe consists of an open kitchen, a table with four chairs, a counter with three stools, a coffee station, a cold case with some brownies and other items, and a counter at which to place your order. It also had a very friendly staff, very attentive, lovely owner and a constant stream of customers. \n\nI ordered the bulgogi sandwich and my husband ordered the breakfast sandwich. Both were delicious. The combination of marinated beef, cucumber kimchee, lettuce, cheese, kochujang (red pepper paste), and a bit of arugula all on a crisply toasted baguette were a perfect marriage of flavors. The sandwiches were neatly wrapped and the owner brought them to our table even though she was very busy. I saved half my sandwich for later but when I got back to our hotel, which was just a five minute walk away, I opened up my still warm sandwich and finished it off! My husband's comment was, \"Oink! Oink!\" I just smiled as I licked my fingers.\n\nThe coffee was really hot and REALLY good. It had great depth of flavor and wasn't bitter or sour. It was fresh and delicious.\n\nI wish I could comment more on my husband's sandwich but he scarfed it down. All I can say is, \"Oink! Oink,\"", "author": "Julia P."}

My wife and I were looking for a place close to our Union Square hotel to eat before heading to the Giants-Cardinals game.  With 4.5 stars and a lot of reviews, we gave Beanstalk Cafe a try.\n\nAfter getting in late the night before, we had a late start to breakfast.  By the time we ate it was not quite breakfast, but not quite time for lunch either.  As we came to this quaint storefront, we were hoping either the single table for two or the three bench seats would come available, which they did fairly quickly.  My wife ordered a breakfast bagel sandwich with a chai latte while I ordered a Korean \"Bul-gogi\" sandwich and Ethopia Yergacheffe Blue Nile drip coffee.\n\nFirst, the drinks.  My wife was impressed with her chai latte and pleasantly surprised that it came standard with almond milk.  The coffee was a tasty pour over that I was pleased with myself.  Now the food.  Both sandwiches were great and extremely filling.  The bulgogi was tender and tasty while the breakfast sandwich was filled with egg, bacon, lettuce, and tomato on an asiago cheese bagel.  The sandwiches were substantial, lasting over five hours before we could even think about having a ballpark snack.  Thanks to these sandwiches, it was only a two meal kind of day for us.", "author": "Jason H."}

I'm OK with the pre-made part, but it wasn't heated through, so it was barely warm inside. Nice concept though - the bacon had no grease but added yummy taste and the egg yolk was flakey and not a hard dried mass.\nThe cappuccino - if you like Columbian roast, you might like this. I don't like Columbian roast. I also have a pet-peeve against places that ask if you want your Cappuccino dry or wet. It's a Cappuccino!\nThe staff are genuinely nice and aim for top notch service. It is a relatively new place, so they are still learning. When it gets busy, it might be a good idea for the cashier to stop taking orders and help make the food/drinks. I know - you want to collect $ so people do not walk away, but people also walk away when they see the crowd of people with no food/drink in hand.", "author": "MT Y."}

The gal who opened this sandwich shop 5 months ago is a gem, from her winning smile to her customer friendliness to her cute doggie s&p shakers. The bulgogi sandwich is really among the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my 50+ years. The idea of putting bulgogi on delicate crunchy crusted French bread (not sourdough, which was a very good decision, since the Baguette is a more delicate backdrop) with just the right amount of pickled cabbage is just fabulous. The spicy chicken is also great choice, though not quite in the same stratosphere as the bulgogi sandwich. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!", "author": "Monika S."}

We moved a few months ago from the East Coast and have been in serious 'breakfast sandwich withdrawal'. While Beanstalk doesn't serve a traditional NY breakfast sandwich on a hard roll, we are happily replacing our old standard with their Morning Breakfast sandwich. We've become weekend regulars there, ordering a couple sandwiches to go each Saturday (and sometimes Sunday) morning. The food is always fresh and hot; they actually get their bread from the Acme Market in the Ferry Building every morning...and you can tell. I haven't had the toast cups yet, although I've been meaning to. They get great reviews and sell out early, although I'm such a creature of habit I can't tear myself away from the breakfast sandwich anyway, even if that have toast cups left. The sandwich is a great combination of the traditional bacon, egg and cheese, with fresh lettuce, tomato and onion. The veggies are always fresh sliced and really flavorful. The cheese is always melted perfectly. They are efficient and really friendly....all reasons why we're now weekend regulars.", "author": "Lauren S."}

My hotel was located in Union Square and I didn't want to wander off too far since the conference was fairly early in the morning.  This place was amazing with the only draw back being the lack of seats.  I ended up purchasing the toast cup, breakfast sandwich, and their iced coffee. The sandwich was great.  The portion was enough and it included eggs, bacon, cheese, and arugula lettuce (which I love). The toast cups, though a novel idea, I did not find to be all that impressive.  I know a lot of reviews raved about it which was why I purchased it in the  first place.  It was literally just rolled up bread with cheese, egg, and bacon. The coffee was what impressed me the most.  I ended up going with the 12-14 hour brew.  Most coffees I've had, specifically the iced ones, retains an acid like taste.  However, this one was purely the simple taste of great coffee beans.

I'm so glad we did! The first day we came, they ran out of toast cups so we ordered a breakfast and a \"burl kogi\" sandwich. Both were delicious! I wanted to try their toast cups so I had my husband go the next morning when they opened to make sure that we would get some before they ran out. They were wonderful as well! I also wanted a mocha latte with almond milk. Even though I told my husband multiple times that I wanted almond milk and even wrote my order on a piece of paper, he informed me that he actually forgot to say almond milk upon ordering my mocha latte. As he was telling me this story back at the hotel, my eyes began to widen and my nostrils were flaring. He continued and said that after the drink was made, he suddenly remembers that the mocha latte needed my requested almond milk. He felt bad that the drink was already made and was going to take it back to me without the almond milk, but the people who worked their insisted on making a new one, especially when they found out that it wasn't for him, but for me, his wife. I just want to say thank you to the workers at beanstalk cafe for going the extra mile and making sure that my husband wasn't going to return to the hotel dreading the consequences of his mistake, lol! Not that many places offer almond milk and being lactose intolerant, all I can usually get is soy; therefore, being able to have almond milk is a delight! I highly recommend this place for their amazing sandwiches and coffee. FYI.. It's kind of small so you may want to consider taking your order to go :)", "author": "Toothfairy P."}

The owner and staff/crew were all very friendly and helpful.  My girls had \"old fashioned\" hot chocolate...the real stuff.  They also had freshly made waffles...light and fluffy.  We also tried the egg, bacon and toast mini cup...very good.  Be aware that they only have one table and a counter/bar, but even if you group is too large to eat in..get it to go...it's very worth it.", "author": "Tom J."}
