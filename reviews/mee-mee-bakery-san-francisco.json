Naturally we had to get both. \n\nWe all walked out happy. \n\nService was what you would expect from the other reviewers.

Immigrants coming to a country not knowing anyone, the local language, nor having financial means to start a business, just satisfied with making ends meet.  Underdogs indeed.\n\nIn Chinatown, word travels fast these days especially food wise.  There is an alley location fortune cookie factory that is more famous and definitely tourist friendly.  This low key spot next to the Chinatown Walgreens beeped on my radar due to chatter about a place on Stockton Street that garnered lines, a rarity these days in these parts.  \n\nWhen I walked in on a weekday morning, there was no one at the counter, just a gentleman inside the baking area pouring ingredients.  After studying their counter offerings for a few minutes, he walked out and asked how can he help me.  Besides grabbing a bag of flat fortune cookies and a bag of \"defective\" cookies, I asked him for a pineapple moon cake (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=v7Q4km8lHwHiMr2DtWrztQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  I also asked about the item that prompted this visit and he told me to come back at noon.\n\nAfter paying for my sweets, he gave me the inside tip on how to ensure that I get this item which I asked a coworker to help me with a few days later.

I quickly googled it and it brought me to this place.  The husband drops me off and tries to find parking in Chinatown (everyone knows how difficult it is).  I walk into the store and I stand there for a while as I see an older man on the side packing some cow ears in bags.  \n\nHe doesn't greet me, just continues to pack them into the bags.  After about 5 minutes, I walk over there and ask if I can buy some cow ears crackers.  He says that its not for sale right now and to come back at 2pm.  I'm a little annoyed as I can see him packing it right then and there.  Its only 1:15pm.  My husband couldn't find parking, so we decide to go to the Ferry Marketplace to check it out before coming back to Chinatown.  I got back to the store at 2:30pm after I get dropped off.  I nicely asked the same man if I can buy cows ears crackers.  He then rudely snapped, \"Come back at 3pm.\"  Annoyed (because this is my 2nd trip back to Chinatown), I said, \"You told me to come back at 2pm.\"  He then yelled, \"Don't be late next time! Its all sold out. Come back at 3pm.\"  At this point, I'm shocked and left the shop.  \n\nI eventually come back at 3pm (I already wasted so much time- I better get these damn cow ears).  He's still sitting at the side packing the crackers in different bags and doesn't acknowledge me.  \n\nAt this time, other customers come in asking for cow ears crackers, and he abruptly tells them that they are sold out and to come back tomorrow.  After standing there for 15-20 minutes, he finally acknowledges me, and sells the 4 bags that I ask for.  I pay, get my crackers, and leave.  No thank you or anything.  \n\nI hear that sometimes they sell these same cow ear crackers at the Fortune Cookie Company.

They sell out quickly as a line can always be found during those times. \n- The day I went, it was nearly 3:00pm and the owner said that people wouldn't leave, so they packaged more \"cow ear\" snacks - but this seemed very rare. \n- Yes, the customer service can be lacking, but you also have to understand that the customers are extremely pushy as well.  I had a lovely exchange with the man behind the counter and he calmly explained the times and why he got upset with the people who were trying to cut the line. \n- I, personally, don't like the \"cow ear\" snacks but my colleague told me that this is the closest she has ever tasted of a Toi San childhood memory/snack.  No other bakery in NYC and SF makes these anymore. So BRAVO to this bakery for maintaining an old tradition and for briefly bringing people's happy childhood memories back! \n\nWhat I ordered: \n- The famous \"cow ear\" snacks - The price of each bag is $5 and each person is limited to 2 bags.  There will be a line, but the wait seems to be worth it!

It is a no frill bakery so don't expect exceptional service and butt kissing owners. I frequent this place because their fortune cookies are hella better than Golden Gate Fortune Cookies. \nThey're crunchy and thicker than GGFC. The flavor is real good. It is ALMOST (almost) similar to the taste of a waffle/sugar cone. When they're making fresh cookies, you can smell them when you walk in. I like buying the bags of rejects. They cost less and they're either not folded correctly or the edges are not complete because the batter dispenser ran out and the cookie is jagged or not completely round.  Some cookies have fortunes in them  but are not folded neatly. They don't taste any different from the normal /pretty ones. Once in awhile  I will buy the small flat round bite sized bags. They are the perfect bite-size pieces. They're like eating chips. They disappear fast. Also, there are adult-rated/rated -X fortune cookies and flavored fortune cookies-strawberry and chocolate. The rated-x ones have corny fortunes. They're pretty dumb. The flavored ones are different. I prefer the original vanilla flavor. Strawberry taste like Strawberry Quik. Chocolate is good if you like anything choc. \n\nTheir cow ear cookies are real popular too   I don't care for them and it is a only  because we grew up eating them a lot.

I would not come here aside from my mom asking for cow ear cookies. They have no sense of customer service whatsoever. I had emailed them (from their website it says this is how you order) and told them I'd like 10 bags and would be there on Wednesday to pay and pick them up. When I arrived he said they never got the email, but would be able to give me 10 bags but would have to prepare and bag them as well. I asked him simply how long it would take (my cousin had picked up 9 backs 2 weeks prior and she had to come back  3 hours later). He rudely said to me \"How long do you think it takes to bag 10?\" Taken aback, I told him I had no clue and then he interrupted me and said that he didn't know either and that it would take time. He then went to the back and proceeded to bag. I took this as a sign that there were enough cow ear snacks to bag 10, and waited near the register. \nAfter he finished, he told me that I needed to do it correctly and purchase online --I told him his site said the online shop was not available and that I had to email, which I did. He then told me that I have to state I am \"purchasing\" it......I don't get it. I didn't want to dilly dally and aruge with him so I told him that I would keep that in mind next time.

Look, I know Chinese service can sometimes be considered abrupt but I would rarely call it rude. The register lady's actions at Mee Mee Bakery were borderline demonic.\n\nMy poor father was taunted for being soft-spoken. The lady repeatedly yelled at him \"I can't hear you\" when they were literally across from each other. \n\nThere were also bags of cow ears behind the counter, which my dad had no idea what they were called at the time. So she quite literally sneered and taunted \"If you don't know what it's called, I'm not getting it for you\". That was the last straw and my normally reserved dad barked back \"There's no need to be rude\". I ain't no wolf on Wall Street, but refusing to sell goods seems rather counterintuitive. \n\nTo be serious though, I want to empathize for a moment. I don't think anyone ever becomes like this without some terrible life experiences to fuel that kind of anger and hate. And for that, I feel sorry, but taking it out on customers is not the smartest outlet for your frustrations.\n\nObviously, we won't be coming back.

Therefore, I've went to their website and it mention please email your order to meemeebakerysf@gmail.com to order any of their products since they no longer accepting online order and payment via PayPal. So that is what I have done. I sent them an email. Since I haven't heard back from them. I've decided to call and a very RUDE lady (I think it might be the same one) answer the phone. She told me that I have to come in and place the order today and come back to pick it up on Thursday. Since I don't live in SF, I told her if I can just tell her over the phone what I want to order now and come on Thursday to pick it up. She say \"no\" and hang up the phone on me.

They are amazing in flavor with a strong Almond extract taste.  Keep in mind that the texture is not what you normally would expect from a  Macron.

I bought a 1/2lb of macaroons.....I immediately opened the bag to eat some, and the chocolate one crumbled as I bit into it.  Normally they are soft and chewy with a crispy edge, as macaroons should be.  Then I tried one the almond ones.  Not as bad, but definitely could tell they weren't far behind the chocolate ones in terms of freshness.  It was too late to stop my friend from buying his share from one of the twin salesgirls.  \nAs my friends and I stood outside comparing notes,...I was so disappointed, that I thought I didn't have anything to lose by telling them that they weren't fresh.  The response I got was, \"we bake them fresh, and then we freeze them.  Let them sit out for a bit, and they'll get chewy again.\"\nI told the girl that they weren't frozen and not even cold.  I'm very familiar on what the texture of a macaroon should be like.  She stood her ground and insisted they were fine.  My politeness deteriorated, and I finally told her that they were just about stale, and shouldn't be like that.\nShe then says, \"what do you want me to do about it?\"\nI replied, \"can you take them back?\"  Her reply was \"no.\"\nRather then argue, I told my other friend who about to buy something, not to bother....and we all left.  TERRIBLE customer service!! \nI've been going here for over 35 years, and have never had a bad experience here until now.  Didn't even get an apology....or offer an exchange.\nThey have lost a customer for life, which is sad because whenever I have company visiting from out of town, I've ALWAYS suggested them to stop by here for macaroons.

But you don't have to be so rude about it.\" (The reason why we bought it was because we were craving it). While I was saying that, she was muttering something to herself. Like okay.

Everyone who walks past this small shop notices the delicious smell right away! I always go for their thin crispy almond cookies (~$3-4 per box), the mini almond cookies (~$3-4/half lb., ~$4-5 per lb.), and the flat fortune cookies that are *gasp* fortuneless! This is a cool place to check out if you're a tourist or a local.. You get to watch their old-fashioned machine in the back crank out these timeless Chinese classics.. They also sell almond macaroons, moon cakes (seasonal item), gigantic fortune cookies, and various other bakery items.. Even their cash register is old fashioned and fun to look at! It has raised buttons like an old-fashioned typewriter and the numbers displayed on the front (your total due) are like a counting clicker where you can see the numbers rotate.. This shop is very small and cramped but a lot of history lies within those walls.. All of my friends that I've taken to this bakery are a big fan and return frequently.. It is definitely a hidden gem!", "author": "Alysia W."}

So 3 weeks ago I was there with some friends and the chinese lady was so rude to us when we asked to take some photos. I understand that you might not like it when people take photos of how you make cookies, but gosh, you don't have to be so rude about it. Her attitude was not good. I'm not bringing my out of town guests here no more. \n\nThe first time (years ago) I was there we had to beg for a cookie sample. We just wanted to taste it to see if we wanted to buy a whole bag. The lady behind the counter was very reluctant and broke off small pieces of a cookie for us to try. Why not just give one cookie away? I mean how much is it going to cost? Like 3 cents? Once again, not customer oriented.\n\nThis place should welcome people into their stores and offer free samples. They would make much more money that way. I'm very disappointed. Once again, the quality of their cookies are fine. I'm speaking of their customer service.\n\nI think it's a tad bit expensive. $4 something for a small bag, but that's just my opinion.

I finally had to drop in to get a bag of premium fortune cookies last night and it was fresh, crispy, and very tasty. My bag came with small flat cookies that were made of strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla flavors and I must say that I like chocolate and vanilla the best. The strawberry had a sesame aftertaste that I didn't agree with but otherwise it was well worth the price ($3.95). Comparing to other places, their cookies were less sugary but certainly more thin and crisp. It was fascinating to see how they make everything on site with heavy machinery in the back, and to learn that they also sell moon cakes, breads, macaroons, and other types of cookies.

You can get large bags, adult messages (X-rated), or the \"rejects\" -- the ones that didn't get folded properly. These are sold at a discount and are fun to munch on.  But my favorites are the silver-dollar sized cookies -- they are bite sized, the same batter as fortune cookies, but with a smoothly rounded scalloped edge.  Truly scrumptious!  \n\nThey will also make custom message cookies for you - -just ask the owner, who is great.  Try to give about a week for processing, although once I had an emergency and they did some for me while I waited ( I brought my own fortunes, which makes it harder for them -- they prefer to do the fortunes themselves).  We used the cookies as favors at my wedding, and I've used them in the past for business events.  Everyone loves them.  \n\nThey also make great sesame cookies and almond cookies.  The little ones they serve at the Japanese Tea Garden.  These are so delightful, and luckily, they haven't changed the recipe in years.  \n\nParking is fierce on this stretch of Stockton -- it's best to go with a friend who will circle the block while you run in.  \n\nIf you are there at the right part of the day, you can watch them making fortune cookies -- they invented the machine, and little ladies still fold and stuff them with fortunes -- it's fascinating.", "author": "Bevy M."}

Within moments, I am 5 again sipping on malt Vitasoy, barely able to see over the counters, and tugging on dad to reach for a bag of \"B\" grade fortune cookies, which are visually imperfect, but taste just the same (and cheaper).\n\nI have since grown up and taken a new liking to their flavored fortune cookies like chocolate and strawberry. Between the two, choco wins the taste test, packing a pretty robust chocolate taste.  Another favorite of mine are their Shangri-la Cow Ears cookies.  It's not really made from cow ears, but is shaped like one thinly sliced with cream and brown swirls.  Looking at it, one would think it would probably taste like vanilla and chocolate, but it actually has a sweet and salty taste that's quite addictive.
