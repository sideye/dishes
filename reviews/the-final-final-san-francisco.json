Lots of reasons, here are some of my top reasons:\n\nThey have the best Irish Coffee in San Francisco.  Don't even get me started on this one.  \nThey pour strong cocktails\nThey are the friendliest, unless your a jerk, you probably deserve it.\nThey have every meaningful sport playing on TV.\nThe food comes out quick.  \nYou might run into a celebrity.\n\nReasons to avoid Final Final:\nYou hate fun.\nYou prefer to piss away your money at lower class establishments.\nYou like to be a prick to bartenders.\nPhotobooths scare you.\nToo many sports TVs make you anxious.", "author": "B C."}

Great manager & person and very hospitable. \n\nWith that said, I have to deduct 3 stars based on my interactions with the older male bartender last night. He was incredibly rude, short, and really should try and find a job in accounting or somewhere behind a desk. Further to Emylis point below....it wasn't just because he wouldn't give the blantons topper to us either. It was just his vibe that was a huge downer. If you're gonna reject someone's request for a blantons topper...Be a bartender and reject us WITH SOME CHARISMA!!! \n\nMy group spent about $700-1000 at the bar within a 3 hour period (12 person softball team plus girlfriends) celebrating a golf outing to cap the year off. \n\nIf you would have given out the blantons topper, we would have considered making your bar our 2019 after-game softball hangout, dishing you tons of cash. But not anymore. It's the small details in life that matter.", "author": "Tom R."}

Pool table and darts, ya really can't go wrong!

But you will feel at home in no time grabbing a seat next to some locals and catching a game or two. I know I did. \n\nThey have a great beer selection and the friendly bartenders pour 'em stiff. It only took two gin and tonics for me to feel the midday buzz, and that was after I ate a huge slice of pizza. \n\nAs far as sports bars go, The Final Final can rub shoulders with the best of them.

The problem is, there was still beer in them.  Now, if he'd said anything at all, like \"hey, I need to get these in the dishwasher, can I pour your beer in a glass for you?\" this would be a 4 or 5 star review.  Instead, he said nothing and tried to take our beer.  When we told him we weren't done with the pitchers, he said \"Yes you are,\" and kept trying to take them.  Finally, he slammed them down and yelled \"then you'd better pour them into a glass right now, because I'm taking these pitchers!\"\n\nLook, if you need to clean up after the game, that's great.

When I was about to inquire with another bartender what was going on and then realized that there was probably a computer/printing issue I told him with a smile, \"never mind.\" Faux-hawk came up and snapped at me (again) for \"complaining\" to another bartender when I never even had a change to ask my question. He was assumptive and extremely rude to me for absolutely no reason. I was beside myself. Working in the food and beverage industry for many years I would have NEVER EVER treated a customer this way. Furthermore, the manager didn't do enough to smooth this over. He listened to the story and did not even offer to take care of the two beers. After the game he then thanked us for staying to watch and said that he wasn't going to talk to he employee right away because the Warriors had won and he didn't want to 'kill' the mood.

First off, at $18 per draft pitcher, it is very expensive.  The two bartenders (older gentlemen) were friendly enough.  The beef I have is the lack of cleanliness in the bar itself.  Mostly, we were completely skeeved by the popcorn bowls.  Yes, you were treated to free bowls of popcorn, however, along with the popcorn you were handed a healthy serving of the last user's germs.  Each bowl had a ring of grime around the upper part which gave away the fact they are never washed.  I scraped the grime with my fingernail...ick.   Proof was apparent when we watched the waitress, twice, take bowls from the bar, wipe them off over a trash can with a towel, then place them back next to the popcorn machine.  No idea for what else that towel may have been used. I purposely put a wet napkin filled with who-knows-what in my bowl.  Again, it was dumped, wiped, replaced to popcorn machine.  No soap and water touches these bowls.  Between the price of draft and the laziness of the staff to clean, I would never return.", "author": "Joanne H."}

We got the cue ball just as someone else was putting in quarters, and shit almost led to straight up FISTICUFFS. Actually, I just kind of stood there doing a Kanye shrug outwardly being nice and explaining the situation to these older folk who tried to take the table while in my head saying \"FUCK THESE PEOPLE I WILL FIGHT THEM TO THE DEATH OVER THIS POOL TABLE.\" They backed down and sat in the corner semi-uncomfortably while we gleefully played a round of pool in their faces.

He does not come back with my 50 cents.  \n\nNow, I didn't say anything...I mean, who starts a scene over 50 cents?  But I was still put off by his assumption that I didn't want change.\n\nWhen I recounted the story to my friend who's been here before, he didn't seem at all surprised and said the bartender has been known to yell at people for leaning on the pool table or standing where he needed to walk.\n\nHe can shove his shitty little bar far up his royal ass for all I care -- I won't be coming back here.", "author": "Eugene F."}

If you like guys with a lot of gel in there hair and old man shoes, and bartenders who act like it's a chore to serve you, this is your place.", "author": "Ryan M."}

The bar was empty and I was the only one there. I asked the balding old bartender for a coffee drink. He rudely with a sound of irritation told me to go up the street for coffee. I have been a customer of this bar for 22 years or more and live a block away. I have brought many peep's there over the years. I deserved a pleasant refusal at the minimum. Had I ever been any kind of problem over the years, I could have understood his distasteful reaction to my request. \n\n      I found out that he lives in Marin and does not give a tinkers damn about folks in the old SF tradition of neighborhood. In the 22 years of my patronage there he has bought me one drink and I almost fainted. I will not annoy him again.", "author": "Jack J."}

Has a very neighborhood-bar feel to it.  Didn't try any of the bar food but the friends I were with had the pizza and I can't say it looked the greatest, but you should be coming to this place for the experience and not the bar food.", "author": "Katie P."}

The crowd is a little older and male, but not offensively so.  Popcorn is a plus.  FYI, $15 minimum on the credit card tab.", "author": "Amy H."}

Plenty of space but not much seating, free popcorn, lots of televisions. Marginal bar food, good if you need it. Great beer selection. Friendly bar and wait people although a bit understaffed when it's packed. Great sports bar. Go Pats!", "author": "trey b."}

Those were some fantastic times!  Anyway, on Saturday night after we left the Outlands Festival, we decided to hang in the city a bit.  My friends had never been to the Final, and I wanted to go somewhere not to busy it was midnight and there were actually quite a few people from the festival there.  There were 6 of us and we order some pints of Guinness with a few mixed drinks, bartender made us very stiff drinks which was nice although I really do not think we needed them, good service nice enough crowd not to loud.  Some of the atmosphere seemed different, but it is still a fun bar that only regulars really know about, the prices are good and if you want to stay a bit out of the limelight, it is a good spot.", "author": "A M."}

A lot of televisions that have different games playing\n2...Cold beer and shots\n3... A bartender that's priority is knowledge of sports over fine wine knowledge.\nAnd guess what, they pass all three criterion!!!  You want Fleur de Lys service??? Go to Fleur de Lys.  It's a dive sports bar, and they do a good job at being one.", "author": "Sam T."}

If you are going to be a shithole, own it, with the dingy floors, gross Swine flu carrying popcorn machine, etc., don't try to price out your beers as though you are the hot nightclub. All I wanted was one Guinness on a Wednesday night to catch the end of the Giants game. The lame excuse for a bartender starts to pour the Guinness, comes back and asks me for $5.75. Not a problem, but he sits there and waits for me to pay him.......before he even serves me, (WTF) so I give him $7. He then brings back a Guinness in some shitty 14oz excuse for a pint glass, instead of the customary 20 oz. Imperial pint that it is supposed to be served in. After taking a few sips, I ask him if this is customary for a $5.75 Guinness and his answer is yes and walks away without an explanation or even smart ass comeback that I could appreciate from a shithole dive bartender. If you are going to be a dive bar in the Marina, charge dive bar prices, but $5.57 for a 14 oz. Guinness, I could go to Johny Foley's in Union Square and pay that for a 20 oz. Guinness. This place has the worst bartenders.....50 year old bald guys should have some personality at a dive..... Either own your filth or clean up your shitty bar for those prices", "author": "Jim M."}
