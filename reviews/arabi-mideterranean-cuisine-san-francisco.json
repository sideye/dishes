This restaurant is a small hole-in-the-wall in the Rincon Center, but seating can be found in the area right outside of the restaurant.\n\nI usually get the chicken curry or chicken shawarma plate. Your taste buds will be delighted, since the food is spiced properly and is flavorful. I consider this place to be relatively healthy, since the food is not swimming in oil like some other Mediterranean food places. However, because of that, I find the chicken in the shawarma plate dry and have to cover up the dryness with a sauce.\n\nThe lady owner is extremely friendly and nice, and recognizes me as a regular. The prices are reasonable, especially for downtown SF!", "author": "Ganeev S."}

I've been here before and found it adequate as far as food court food goes.  However, I'm writing my first review of Arabi because of the terrible attitude I received from one of the other ladies working behind the counter (not the register lady).  And no, it wasn't just towards me.  It was to other customers including my wife and her coworker.\n\nFirst lets talk about the food.  I ordered a falafel pita sandwich for myself and a Middle East Plate for my wife.  I ordered the ME plate and then also said I wanted a falafel pita.  So the rude lady whom I ordered the food made the ME plate and then I said \"I also ordered a falafel pita\".  Her face got really shitty in a second and she forcefully said \"You ordered this ME plate!\"  I responded professionally and said \"No, I ordered this AND a falafel sandwich too\".  After telling her that, she still had that sour face and handed me the tray.  I paid for it and the lady at the register was pretty nice.  \n\nAfter returning from the back to make my pita sandwich, the rude lady came back w/ the sandwich about 2 mins later.  When she handed me the sandwich, zero eye contact but still had that sour face.  Just held it out.  I took it and waited for the other customer to finish paying for his food.  While waiting, another customer behind me asked for some sauce.  Literally the lady slammed it on the top of the counter. The young African American woman I saw was startled by it and we look at each other and gave each other the \"WTH is that lady's problem?\"  After joining my wife and her coworker, I asked them \"Hey was it just me or was that lady rude?\"  We all agreed.\n\nOh yeah as you can tell, my main focus on the rude lady distracted me from talking about the falafel pita sandwich.  The falafel was cold, not freshly made and it was more lettuce than falafel.  I'm back at the office hungry, but I still brought it back.  But still debating on whether to eat it or not or go downstairs and get something else.\n\nI won't be returning again.  And if you're the owner of Arabi (I'm guessing it's the nice lady behind the register), you really need to tell your employee to smile, be courteous, etc.", "author": "Bob K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-03", "description": "I went here for lunch today to get the lamb shank Wednesday special, by the recommendation of a couple colleagues. What I didn't realize was that Wednesday Special meant that lamb shank was only offered on Wednesdays, not that it was cheaper than usual. I looked at the receipt afterwards and to my disbelief I paid over $14 for a lamb shank, some rice and vegetables, and apparently a cup of soup. \n\nFood:\nThe lamb shank I ordered was really good! Definitely a flavor I hadn't experienced before, and the meat was very tender and easy to eat with a fork and knife. I had it served over some lentil rice, which also had a nice blend of flavor and texture, and paired with the vegetables and meat quite nicely.\n\nService:\nService seemed to vary. The cashier was super nice and chatty with everyone she interacted with, but the woman gathering the food and putting it into the containers seemed upset when I didn't know exactly what was going on. There also wasn't much explanation as to what was included with the lamb shank. My colleagues got different sides (pasta salad, something else) with their identical orders but I was only given the option of soup or salad, so I'm not sure what happened there. The woman serving also dropped a couple vegetables out of the bin and missed the container, having them end up on the (sanitized) counter beside the container. She just grabbed them and threw them back in, but missed a couple and still moved on. Was I cheated of some potatoes!?\n\nRecommendation:\nThe food was good, but seemed inconsistent between myself and my colleagues. One person's container was filled with food but also almost overflowing with grease and other juice, which made for a soggy and messy meal. My meal was fine, but the portion size was not worth the money I paid for it. It was definitely a unique flavor and style of food but not worth visiting more than once to experience it, if that.", "author": "John B."}

This is the real deal, ostensibly prepared by real mothers. The lamb is perfectly moist and pulls off the bone with the gentlest touch. It's rich and fatty in the best possible way with crusty caramelized bits in all the right places. 12 bucks seems a lot for lunch, until you realize you're getting a hearty dinner portion with a soup that's just as tasty as the main.

The shank is served over a bed of rice/couscous with two sides (free to choose anything from their salad bar, usually go for tabouleh and hummus) and pita bread. It is a TON of food and I think a great value for a little over $12. The lamb is perfectly braised and falls off the bone. The rice/couscous soaks up all the braising liquid and is exactly what you're looking for in a hearty meal.\n\nNow, for the burrito. Although I am a huge fan of Cicil's veggie wrap, if I'm in the mood for something a little more hearty, I'll go for Arabi's ultimate wrap with bacon. The burrito includes sauteed peppers, onions, potatoes, and mushrooms, your choice of cheese (feta, jack, cheddar), and a smoky and flavorful hot sauce. But wait, it gets better. They toast the burrito on the grill! It only costs $6.50, and you'll be stuffed until 2PM. \n\nFor all of the disappointed reviewers below, please do give the lamb shank and/or ultimate wrap a try.

It was interesting and ok. I am told people go there on Thursdays for such a treat.\n\nIt's never too crowded and again, just ASK and be persistent with explanations for how to get what you want.  If some of the display items seem enticing, just get the middle eastern plate and select items that looks good.", "author": "Jake S."}

I decided to head over to Rincon today because I work across the block and I was getting a bit tired of going to Rincon Grill. \n\nOne of my favorite Middle Eastern foods is definitely shwarma so I decided to get a shwarma sandwich. I was quite surprised when the only question she asked me when taking my order was if I wanted the sandwich in pita or lavash and what kind of meat I wanted. I asked for pita and lamb. What I got was definitely not a shwarma sandwich, although I can't really complain, for $7 I got an awful lot of meat and she piled on a lot of lettuce. \n\nMy complaints, however, was that this was not really shwarma! I got a lot of slices of thinly cut meat in the bottom of my pita after I had ate five mouthfuls of lettuce that were spilling out of the pita. There was no tahini, hummus, hot sauce, or even salad or onions besides the lettuce! Additionally, the top of the pita was drenched in sauce that I wish was more evenly spread throughout the sandwich. I ended eating the meat with the included fork separate from the pita because it had just collapsed because the sauce had made it soggy. The meat was heavily, heavily spiced. I'm talking about, I needed to chew two pieces of gum afterwards to not return back to work smelling like a shuk. \n\nWould I eat at this place again? Maybe but I think I'll definitely get something besides the shwarma because it simply was not shwarma. I've definitely had better Middle Eastern.", "author": "Rick C."}

I am aware it is based on a one time experience and I may have caught a business on simply a bad day or I was not in the right frame of mind, but this was the worst kebab I have ever had and I want to warn others so they do not waste money as I did. \n\nI had lunch there today. I ordered the shish kebab with vegetables and I assumed salad per the menu, but the menu is clearly not followed at this restaurant. It must just be for decor. \n\nFor example, on the dry erase board right outside their door, they advertised a half chicken lunch. This was also on the menu on the wall. That sounded good so I ordered it, but was told they didn't have it today. This was perplexing as it was on the board at the door which utilizes the technology of rapid modification through the use of an eraser and marker. It could have easily been updated to reflect the current status of their lack of chicken, but I decided to bypass this perplexing turn of events and plow on. \n\nI ordered the beef shish kebab which on the board had two listing for shish kebab, one for 7.99 and one for 8.99. Both listed coming on rice with salad, so not really sure what made one a dollar more expensive, but, again, menus are not to be trusted there. I noted the man behind the counter grabbed one kebab and put it on the grill. All of their kebabs were sitting in an open air bowl and had previously been cooked. He was heating it up for me on the grill. I asked about a second kebab and was told it was an extra $2.99. I debated about asking for clarification about the menu situation and the difference in price, but the man appeared to not be solid on his English and I decided not to overcomplicate the process. I was hungry, so I ordered another kebab and, as I am low carb boy, asked for broccoli instead of rice. I was expecting to be asked which salad I wanted, but that was passed by as my food was shuttled to the cashier. Now, I could have asked about salad, but figured they just tossed in the green salad that was there. Nope. No salad. As I said, there appeared to be a language issue present and they were not following the menu as everyone behind the counter kept looking to what I assumed was the owner and she would rattle off a price to them for what was there. The gentleman in front of me clearly ate there a lot as he knew them by name and was telling them he wouldn't see them until next week as he was going on vacation. I took that as a good sign that they had regular, committed patrons. He also order a beef shish kebab, so I figured it meant they must be good. Boy, was I wrong all the way around.\n\nThe Good\nLet me tell you, I am scrapping for the good here. The staff was friendly, but I am not sure what was going on with the staff. It seemed like they don't make decisions without the owner telling them what to do. The people behind the counter were not very helpful and I felt like I had to direct the transaction. That being said, they were friendly. Well, they smiled. They also had lights, so I could see everything. Oh yeah, they had what appeared to be a wide variety of salads and other foods that look tasty. Mind you, looked tasty. Looks can be deceiving as I soon discovered.\n\nThe Bad\nFrankly, the beef shish kebab was inedible. It is generous to say it was well done. It was more like cubes of beef jerky and I was ever so grateful for the cucumber-yogurt sauce they gave me to help add a smidgeon of moisture to the food to help me swallow it. Awful. Simply awful. I debated about returning it, but the line was long and I needed to get back to the office, so I powered through. Also, no salad, just the broccoli.  The broccoli had been sitting, but was fine. The best thing about my meal was my diet Snapple, but I can't really give them credit for that. This was simply horrid and should never, ever be experienced again. I know I won't make that mistake again. \n\nTotal cost for two crusty beef shish kebabs, 5 pieces of broccoli and a diet Snapple = $12.84. Did I already say never, ever again? There are plenty of other fine establishments at the Rincon Food Court, please visit them unless you like overcooked, overpriced crap.", "author": "Sean G."}

It was really good, moderately healthy, and the lady who served it to me was old and sweet.  \n\nalso, i got a piece of falafel on the side (no sauce, wrap or anything), and it was excellent.  maybe i just got a dud the last time around.  anyway, if the falafel is this decent next time, maybe it will be possible to score lunch in the financial district for less than $8.", "author": "Sunil A."}

For $8 (including tax), I get to choose a hot plate, a salad, and a drink (along with some pita bread). \n\nI ordered a beef Shawarma and I saw them microwaving my food...um, this is SO not worth $8...Can't imagine the horror of paying more than $8 to eat microwaved food!!  As expected, the beef was dried...VERY dry to be exact but very flavorful, which gave it a plus.  The rice and sauce is okay.  The salad was amazing tho!  They gave me enough food to split it into 2 meals, so that was good.  Plus, I get to choose any drink in the store for my groupon deal, that's also a plus. \n\nThe service was really good though!  The counter server was very patient as I choose my dish.  It's my first time here and it's been a while since I had middle eastern food, so it took me some time to make a decision.  The cashier lady was great too.  Was also very patient as I stood there choosing my drink. \n\nOverall, this place is okay.  Considering that it's sitting right in the financial district, their price is pretty good but I could've gotten better food as well.  I'll come back if there's a groupon deal and I'm craving for some Shawarma, but won't if there's no more deals :/", "author": "Icy H."}

(Stonestown, don't hold your breath.)\n\nNow, in a more competitive neighborhood, Arabi might only get 4 stars, but to the desperate office workers awash in a sea of mediocrity, it's a beacon of hope.  Besides, while you can nitpick the quality, you can't argue with the prices and portions (the $6 deluxe falafel sandwich with potato and eggplant is monstrous).  And they even offer a few lesser-known sides like mujadara, a scrumptiously seasoned pile of lentils, rice & such.\n\nEven if you don't work nearby, you really should find an excuse to visit the Rincon Lobby at some point, and if you don't want to shell out for Yank Sing, Arabi's got you covered.", "author": "Wes M."}

Tucked deep in the bowels of the Rincon Center, it's not hard to believe, actually.  For such a tiny hole in the wall, this place manages to crank out a nice diversity of dishes, and very tasty too.\n\nI had the bargain plate and a bargain it was--only $3.95 for a heaping pile of a nice dish I've never heard of before and, shucks, can't remember the name of, but it's got brown rice, lentils, sauteed onions, and herbs & spices.  They offered to heat it up and I accepted, and I'm glad I did.  It seemed to bring out the subtle complexity of the seasoning.  I also got a nice dallop of baba ghanouj, one falafel (room temperature, but large and quite tasty), and pita (white or wheat--I went with wheat).\n\nYou can also get a \"Greek\" salad instead of the rice dish with the bargain plate, and I just might do that on days when I'm not as hungry.  When your hungry, though, go with the rice dish.  It'll keep you going all afternoon!", "author": "John D."}

A ton.  But if someone gave you a ton of kicks in the lower-back, would you consider that a good thing?  Exactly.\n\nHad the lamb shawarma plate.  I love me some lamb shawarma, and have been in a slump with new places I've tried for this dish, so I thought this could get me out.  Basically I went 0-5 with 5 strike-outs, and got drilled in the head on a run-out.   First off the meat doesn't appear to be on a doner, but rather just stewed in a pot.  After they stew it, they leave it in a chafing dish until you order it.  The end result is basically chipped lamb (I think it was lamb) in a horrendously seasoned broth... too much of two spices, I think clove is one but it's hard to parse them apart.  Literally, the lamb was splintered - the biggest chunk I found was about 1cm across and 2cm long.  So the texture was no good, but the flavor I couldn't handle.  It is an extraordinarily rare case where I just can't bring myself to eat something (maybe twice in my life), but this was one.  Just couldn't do it.  Tried mixing it with the bland and watery humous, no good.  Mixing with the overly-dill'ed tahini, no good.  Tons of hot sauce, still nothing.  \n\nHad a side salad of veggies with jalapeno, which was decent but because the jalapeno had been sitting in the bowl with all the veggies for so long, everything sort of tasted the same.  Oh well.\n\nMaybe the other dishes are great, but avoid the lamb shawarma.  Overpriced as well.  If I'm back in the area I'll give the chicken a shot, but otherwise I'm benching myself from this place.", "author": "Jake D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-04-05", "description": "Perhaps my expectations were set too high with all the other relatively glowing reviews.  But I simply can't rate this place very highly.  First, I was disappointed that they only offer pita, not lavash.  The woman behind the register claimed that it was because lavash broke apart too easily.  huh?  Since when does anyting fall apart more easily than pita, especially when it's stuffed to overflowing?  If it weren't for the paper it was wrapped in, I wouldn't have had a sandwich; I would have had a pile of food.\nSecond, perhaps this is just a matter of taste, but my \"chicken shawarma\" was nothing like any chicken shawarma I've ever encountered before.  The sauce was strange (and very overly acidic and sour - quite off putting.  It almost tasted like hollandaise sauce or something.  Where's the tahini?), it was WAY over-spiced with the purple stuff (not sure quite what it is) to the point that I could hardly taste anything else, and the arrangement of ingredients was very poor - all spice and sauce at one end, chicken in the middle, and lettuce at the other, when it should be a mix all through.\nSo while some of this can be chalked up to personal taste, there's an awful lot that was just not well done.  Not worth a return trip.", "author": "Don H."}

The marinated chicken is soo delicious and they use lots of sauce. I always ask for hot sauce and they usually put in enough to clear out my sinuses. The service is very friendly. One word of caution: when getting the sandwich, ask for a plate to go with it. That thin wall of pita stands no chance against the flood of sauce inside, and the thing inevitably explodes after bite one. Which means a trip to the dry cleaners.\nBeware that going to Arabi requires a trip into the twilight zone that is the Rincon Center. Everything about this place seems...fake. There's always someone playing something mild and unnoticeable on a piano, giving it a department store vibe, the offices upstairs look like they belong on a stage set, and the inexplicable fountain rains down in the center of the lobby like an enormous shower. I usually get my shawarma and run the heck out of there as fast as I can before the Truman-show-eggshell-thin-reality crumbles before my eyes.", "author": "Kathleen B."}
