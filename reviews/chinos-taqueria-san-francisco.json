It's not that this neighborhood is all that hoity-toity or that riff-raff like us didn't belong there. No, we just didn't expect to see a taqueria among the coffee cafes and more traditional, north-of-the-border food to be found in this enclave. The menu was pretty standard - tacos, burritos, nachos and meat plates.\n\nJamie went for the $7.10 Super Vegetarian Burrito with plenty of black beans, rice, salsa and lettuce wrapped in a soft spinach flour tortilla (photo: http://bit.ly/2mTimni). It was heartier than most, though it needed a major dousing of hot sauce to enliven it. I ordered the $3.99 Super Carnitas Taco which had a lot more rice than pork on a soft flour tortilla with a drippy tomatillo sauce ladled on top of a tuft of sour cream, salsa, and black beans (photo: http://bit.ly/2mFY7IX). The shredded pork was also a bit too wet to truly savor but it was otherwise reasonable for a late afternoon bite. The pace was leisurely to match the food.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...reasonably decent Mexican lacks kick but satisfies with the basics\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...clean and sparse and not much else\nSERVICE - 3 stars...guys dish out the food pretty much on automatic pilot\nTOTAL - 3 stars...nothing offensive here, nothing extraordinary either...a foggy day in taco town", "author": "Ed U."}

That's a bad first impression. It didn't get any better. The carne asada tasted like it was made days before. The salsas were bland and provided a mild amount of salt that helped the nursing home burritos. All of this can be yours for $9.70. Way over Yelp's misleading price of $5.50.\n\nAlas, not everything was bad. The burrito was at least filling. But isn't that what food is supposed to do at the bare minimum? The beans and tortillas were ok, but both can be purchased in the store with minor prep. \n\nHere's my takeaway: follow your instincts when you go to a Mexican hole in the wall.

My son (12 yo) went in himself to buy one burrito and he was charged $ 17.65 for it. I had to go back to ask for an explanation for the excessive amount for one burrito.

The menu does not list $2.5 for extra meat and the guy did not say anything to my son when he was ordering  except for asking him whether he wanted other types of meat in the burrito. Not knowing that it would cost him extra, my son added 2 more types of meat in the burrito. Well, how much extra meat can someone stuff in a burrito? Not that more. A super burrito costs $7.10.  With 2 extra meats, it should have cost $12.10. How in the world could the cashier charged my son $17.65? $5.5 for tax?? Was it a mistake? I don't think so.

First off let me say, the food wasn't horribly bad. I ordered a super burrito. It wasn't bad at all, although the chicken was somewhat dry and had a burnt chewy texture. I'm not really a hard one to satisfy though so that was ok with me. Pic de gallo tasted just fine, the spinach tortilla was warm, the rice had a little flavor, and the guac wasn't too bad either. \n\nI walked out pretty confident that this would be a good replacement for Gordo's as it's closer and more convenient to me. \n\nFast forward 8 hours later, I wake up 3am in pain with stomach cramps saying to myself \"if this is what women go through when they have cramps, I have much respect for you\". Waves and waves of pain until just recently. \n\nI wish this wasn't the case but something wasn't right with what I ate. Either the food was old and kept out on the warmer too long or sanitation was off but man did I feel it. \n\nService is good though. Everyone's friendly and greet you as you walk in.

Now I've had plenty of\nLatino food to know that rice and beans are not in a quesadilla. Mind you this is a\nSuper quesadilla. I started eating and before I even took a bite I was already bummed out.

My super spicy chicken burrito's (6.40$) failures were legion: The ungrilled tortilla developed early leaks followed by complete burstage 2/3 of the way through, which resulted in the burrito being eaten horizontally (in a style befitting a hoagie, not a burrito!), and the consumption of several slow-growth forests worth of napkins. Cheese was barely present, spice non-existant, even with the addition of a loving handful of Jalapenos, and the \"spicy chicken\" not only lacked all spice but managed to taste almost fishy. Where was the guacamole I ordered? Nowhere to be found in the damn thing. Was it at least sized well? If I was on a diet the diminuative sizing would have been perfect, as such, it barely lasted 10 bites. \n\nNot all was bad, however, the ingredient mix was respectable, the rice flavorful, and the re-fried beans pleasantly pasty, but these shouldn't be burrito-defining elements by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nNothing to see here, folks.

After having eaten at several taquerias I change my mind about this place entirely. Their meats are seasoned nicely, the prices are very low, and their food is good!  It's a simple menu of tacos, burritos, nachos, and quesadillas, so it hits the spot 95% of the time. \n\nAlso, and perhaps more importantly, their staff are FRIENDLY. At most taquerias, employees seem to run on autopilot. For example, they'd ask \"What kind of beans\" and then slap refried beans onto your food before you even have time to answer. At Chino's, they'll ask you what you want, and wait for you to respond, and then actually give you what you want. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal but for me, it's a huge edge over the much-beloved Gordo's Taqueria (a love that I will never comprehend, for I find their food kinda bland).", "author": "Dwigt S."}

I wanted cheese in my burrito and they charge $.50 extra. \n\nMaybe I should've put lettuce in my burrito, because the burrito was very bland. The chicken pieces were also dry as a bone. After eating only half, I couldn't eat that burrito no more. \n\nI paid my co-worker's meal and mine in cash, because my co-worker forgot to go to the ATM machine and this place is \"cash only\". If my co-worker wants to return the favor and reimburse my meal, I hope it won't be this place. \n\nI usually rely on Yelp for recommendations for our meal, but this time I'm going to strongly disagree with Yelp about this place, considering this place has a not one, not two, but three Yelp stickers on the main entrance door. In my book, they don't deserve any Yelp sticker.", "author": "Matt G."}

I added an extra star for the portion which was fairly large. But I was expecting the little yummy street tacos I'm used to! The guys working were super nice!

I love having a place where I can take a nice leisurely stroll with my family and have some decent Mexican food without breaking the bank ($40 feeds my family of 5 including drinks).  I've had some pretty tasty Mexican food in Tijuana...as well as in SoCal.  Do I compare those experiences to what I get at Chino's?  No...because I don't have time to fly down south just for Mexican food.  The guys that run this place know what they're doing...they serve solid food with excellent service.  For the out of town guests and those that try to compare the food here to the taquerias in the Mission district, if you got time to drive over to the Mission, be my guest.  Good luck finding parking over in the Mission.  At least around here, you have a better chance.  So leave Chino's to my family and I and the other neighbors in the area as we all love what they serve.

Granted, I don't live in the Outer Richmond, so that might be why.  \n\nI was craving burritos for a while, so A decided to take care of the craving by taking me to his burrito joint of choice, Chino's.  It looks pretty small and ghetto on the outside, but it actually goes pretty far back.  You walk in and are at the counter right away.  You order, they make your burrito, you pay, then you either leave with your food, or you grab a seat at one of their tables.\n\nI, as you all know, cannot take spicy food at all, but A convinced me that the spicy chicken would probably be the best for me and it really wouldn't be that spicy.  So, I trusted him and ordered the Spicy Chicken Burrito on the Spinach Tortilla.  It was really good and the prices were very reasonable.  The burrito was hardly spicy at all and it was tasty.  I didn't want to order something and get really dry meat in it.  That always sucks.  I also got some Watermelon soda.  I've never had watermelon soda before.  It was kind of odd.

Daily I fight the urge to go back to the area of the city that I lived in years ago, the Hayes Valley, and to the spots I used to visit when I lived there: Union Square, the Embarcadero, the Lower Haight, the Marina, the Fillmore district, etc. However, I've been good, and I'm being rewarded as I discover some great businesses here in the Avenues.\n\nYesterday, I was on the 38 Geary heading to the Safeway on La Playa.  Around 33rd Avenue, I noticed a cute corridor of cafes and restaurants on Balboa Street.  I was tempted to get off of the bus, but decided to stay on to see what was there because I'd double back after picking up some groceries.  Also, I'd not eaten lunch, so I was hungry.  We passed Chino's and I decided that was the spot.  \n\nI'm glad I chose it.  They had the full spread in terms of different meats and other ingredients.  I ordered a carnitas super burrito because I love guacamole and their super burritos come with it.  They also have the choice of three different types of tortillas.  I chose the traditional flour one (and, sorry, I can't even tell you what the other two choices were.)\n\nThe only negative of the place was the line.  It wasn't necessarily their fault, but just bad timing on my part as I got stuck behind a woman who ordered I don't know how many things back to back instead of simultaneously.  They'd gear up to move on and then she'd start with another order.  That was really irritating because I was hungry.  However, there isn't much you can do in that situation outside of 1) suck it up and wait or 2) be a jerk.  I chose to suck it up, grimace and wait.\n\nThe guys taking working there were all nice.  The prices were great.  I paid just over $7 for a super burrito and a soft drink.  The best part was the burrito.  It was delicious and tasted just as delicious as the one made in the great taquerias in Southern California.  \n\nI'll definitely make my way back over there before I leave the city.

Sure, at 5:30 the streets are packed with throngs of locals celebrating their liberation from the 38-Geary, but who actually works around here during the day?  Exaaaactly.  The only other guy getting lunch at Chino's was picking up a massive take-out order for a construction crew.  Now, few restaurants are particularly appealing when they're empty, but you know what they say: it's the burritos, stupid.\n\nOn that front, Chino's is certainly in the upper echelon, and if you can navigate the cryptic and at times contradictory menu boards, you'll notice a little thing at the bottom: \"Jumbo: $8.00\".  This would be the jumbo burrito, possibly the biggest one I've seen in San Francisco yet, which they prudently wrap in double tortillas to avoid fallout (naturally we split--and even then it was a big meal).  The balance of ingredients was superb as well--carnitas, black beans, cheese and toppings in perfect harmony.

I don't frequent them enough...), service seemed decent though. The men behind the counter called me \"Senorita\" which I thought was cute. They also seemed prepared for either the \"eat-in\" or \"takeout\" options...the little plastic baggy was all ready for if a customer should say \"to go please\". \n\nI've only lived in this neighborhood for a couple of months now, and every time I passed by Chino's before, I always thought the place was super small. I thought there were only two tables in the whole place, but today I saw that there's a bigger seating area inside (off to the side, away from the doorway). \n\nNow, onto the burrito itself--I'm no burrito connoisseur like my friend Mellie P., so I can't say if the burrito I ate today was super-duper delicious, or if it was bland. Burritoeater.com states that Chino's is not that great, although it's working its way up there....seems like a lot of Yelpers however really love Chino's.\n\nFor me, Chino's is middle of the ground, at least for now. I had a burrito with carnitas; the hot sauce was a pretty good addition to the burrito itself. I passed on the guacamole and sour cream due to the fact that I know those two condiments have a ton of fat and calories (and you may ask, why is a calorie counter eating a burrito in the first place?). \n\nAnyway, I did like how they had their chip bags arranged in front of the counter AND in good, single-serving portions, too! Kudos on that. Seems like a decent neighborhood place with decent food and prices. I'm a little scared about the jumbo-sized option....I already felt really full after eating my \"regular\" burrito.", "author": "Helene K."}

I'd never had it like this before and it was pretty damn juicy.  The red hot sauce is flavorful...not made to fuel rockets, thankfully.  The juices and the hot sauce did make the burrito a bit soggy but it was expected.  It did not drip out of the foil.  The carnitas was delicious and not too salty.

It so happened that my sis came home right after my passed-out self, drunk also, and sloppily horked down my treasured left over burrito.
