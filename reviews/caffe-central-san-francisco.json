After passing by many lunch spots that seemed unappealing, I happened upon Caffe Central. Lots of choices at this little place in the center of the food court in the basement. \n\nThey have inventive breakfast items, pastries, sandwiches, salads and beverages along with fresh fruit--something for everyone. They appear to serve these items throughout the day, so if you are seeking a breakfast item outside of the typical timeframe (as I was at 11am) this is the place to visit. Prices are reasonable. \n\nHad the quiche Lorraine for $8.50 and it was just the portion I was looking for. I would have gotten the kale cauliflower quiche but I couldn't determine--and they didn't know for sure if it had any cheese in it. Cheese is a must have in my quiche! One improvement is that It could have used a minute more in the reheat process because there were a couple of slightly less warm spots inside, but the flavor was very good and spoke to homemade, quality ingredients. \n\nI would visit again if I'm in town and want a quick, tasty meal for a reasonable price.", "author": "B L J."}

The person who rang me has been the same both the times and I've noticed that each time I've gone hereshe has been rude. Second time around I got boba tea.  I asked for coffee flavor and she asked if I want tea or green tea base and she asked twice as I didn't get it the first time ( and IMHO she sounded even more frustrated the second time) and she didn't ask me how much ice or sugar I wanted. I also didn't mention as I thought they would ask me at some point.It is a norm AT ALL boba places I've visited to ask these two simple questions. They show you a chart and enter it in the system. But, no this place doesn't do it. \n\nWhen the lady was making it I saw her add lots of ice so I asked her very politely to remove it. So this lady at the cashier comes and uses a condoning tone and says I should've told her. I mean are you the boba shop or me? How am I supposed to know your process? I normally add a tip, but her tone was not nice so I didn't add anything and I am glad I didn't. \n\nAnyway the tea was actually good, but too sweet!\nI would give Negative stars for service.", "author": "Sakshi G."}

I can't comment on the guy making the coffee since I didn't order any. It took a good 10-15 mins just to get 3 orders of original green milk teas with aloe vera (no boba), and there was only 2 other orders ahead of me. The lady was too busy chit chatting with her co-worker, then talked on her cell phone. And when they ran out of aloe vera and could only make 2 drinks with aloe, so the third drink was with rainbow jelly instead. I asked the lady to make 1 regular sweetness and the other less sweet with aloe, and the 3rd regular sweetness with rainbow jelly. Instead of saying \"ok,\" or \"no problem\", she argues with me and says that she already mixed the two regular sweet ones so she can't do that. She hasn't even poured them into the cups yet (they were still in the mixing container) so it was just a matter of getting another cup, putting rainbow jelly in it and then pouring into that cup along with one of the cups with aloe. What's so difficult?? And it's not my fault you ran out of aloe vera. Why did she feel the need to make the 2 orders with regular sweetness with aloe and the less sweet drink HAS to be with rainbow jelly?? She isn't the one drinking it, it's me the customer.\n\nAnyhow, the drinks were ok, not the best but not the worst either.\n\nTheir other location right next to Ellis O'Farrell parking garage has much better service so I will go to that one in the future if I'm in union square and want some milk tea.", "author": "T H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-02", "description": "BOBA BOBA BOBA\n\nFinding this place was a bit interesting: \n\nI was out and about in San Francsico marking all the boba places that were in the city. I was deciding where I should go to and what I should try. I even made a decision to go to one shop, but it turned out that store was going to be open at 12pm. It was merely 9:45am. Obviously, I had to find boba somewhere else. \n\nAfter watching El Clasico at Thirsty Bear Brewery, I made my way back to the Powell Bart Station, I found my way into the Westfield Shopping Center and went down the escalators to the food court. I had settled with buying this Ramune drink from Bristol Farms. I also decided to just by lunch in one of the many eateries on this floor. \n\nNothing caught my eye until I came upon the menu for Caffe Central. Yelp surprisingly didn't show me that this place had boba so it didn't come in my search when I typed in boba. But there it was on the menu in clear writing that said, \"Boba.\" EKKKKK I was so excited. If there's boba, I must try it!\n\nTheir collection of flavors isn't as big as other boba shops, but it makes sense. This place doesn't focus solely on milk tea. Their flavors are: Original, Taro, Thai, Honey, Almond, Caramel, Coffee, Coconut, etc. They also had some cookies, sandwiches, and salads along with some coffee, tea, and juice. \n\nLet me just tell you that the people I met working there were nice. They were quick and efficient. I don't think I had to wait even a minute before my name was called with my order. Oh, I ordered Taro. They didn't have any cookies and cream flavor so of course I went for their Taro. Cost wasn't too bad for a pretty large size of 24 oz. I only paid $4.25. \n\nWHOA. This place actually has the best taro milk tea with boba compared to the other milk tea/bubble tea/boba stores I've been too so far. This wasn't bland at all as taro can be if made incorrectly. The milk mixed well with the taro. It created this lovely and almost soft kind of sweetness to the drink. I didn't feel like I would get hyper because of the amount of sugar in the drink. Instead, I felt very relaxed. There was however a lot of ice, and that did make my drink a bit watery towards that last few sips. They happen to also use standard boba. That didn't taste any different to the ones I've stated at ShareTea. \n\nA nice little hidden gem of a spot for the bubble tea lover.", "author": "Alexa T."}

I stood there for about 30 seconds while he pretended to ignore me. He was much nicer to other customers, though. I asked him about two different drinks, and he didn't look like he wanted to help me decide. I asked the right questions, but he had dumb, condescending reponses. It seemed he knew way less about the drinks than I did - and he works there. Or at least, he just didn't want to give me the good, helpful info he'd give to others. \n\nThis place is nice if they like you based on superficial appearances, a snap judgement, and rude if they don't like you. I'm just like any other customer who walks up to that place, but as usual, they were nasty and judgmental to me only. I saw others getting much better treatment from the same cashier. He didn't even thank me or say a parting phrase. I'm surprised but not so surprised by the reviews here that say they give friendly service. People naturally give friendly and warm service if they like and look up to you, however you look at that moment. And the more they dislike you based on superficial appearances, the worse treatment you'll get. \n\nI expected this place to have the Square register stand, like other places with their vibe. But it didn't have the Square thing, which makes cashiers treat each customer more fairly because asking for a tip is more in-your-face. With the Square thing, cashiers often turn the iPad-like device over to the customer, who can choose whether to give a tip of $1, $2, or more. But because this place just used a standard register, asking for a tip isn't so obvious and in-your-face for cashiers, so they're not as nice to every customer. When a tip isn't expected or wanted, they just treat the ones they like better, and the ones they look down on worse. That's extremely unfair, and extremely painful. They don't even know me, and they're judging me to death. \n\nThat barista was very indifferent, but he wasn't  quite as bad as the cashier or most employees toward me. At least when the barista saw me waiting there, he helped me immediately instead of pretending not to notice, like most employees. \n\nThis place has very differential service towards different customers, so it's left a very bad taste in my mouth. It's very overpriced, too. $7 for a tiny cake, and served with terrible presentation that doesn't match its high prices - on an ugly, cheap-looking plate. Very overpriced, mediocre drinks, too.

If you don't tip them they will remember you next time hahaha. The food is just ok. I found the tuna sandwich to be pretty good but sometimes tastes like freezer or refrigerator taste. \n\n\n****Update**** I went in for one last try on 2-28-15 since I work in the building. I hadn't eaten all day so I ordered the tuna sandwich. Everything seemed ok until about hour later. I got super sick! Vomiting violently and went home early sick. I literally had to vomit out all the contents of that horrible tuna sandwich!!! I called the following day and talked to the manager tried to diagnose me with some other sickness rather than food poisoning. She scoffed and said our tuna is not made in-house, it's made at the main location so she has no clue what they do there. She said there is nothing that she can do.

Yes, the coffees and espressos do take a while, but I think that's the charm of an SF coffee shop, as opposed to going to a Starbucks which is on the other side of the food court. (Not that I don't like Starbucks, but they're the fast food of coffee shops).\n\nThey do drip coffees and espressos with Blue Bottle Coffee, and also have TCHO for mochas and hot chocolates. The coffees come well made, with a little coffee art (even when they only do take-out orders).

Each morning I treated myself to their individual drip coffee; Fresh and Robust. Along with my morning joe, I treated myself to a few of their pastries. With a large selection to choose from, I opted for classics and my favorite, a cheese Danish.\n\nThe cheese danish was at best ordinary; nothing special.\n\nTheir croissant was flaky, but again it didn't wow me.\n\nThe surprising and the easy to miss best dish would have to be their tuna sandwich with granny smith apples. I had mine toasted, which gave it a nice texture to the bread. The apples gave the sandwich a distinctive and unique character. It provided a nice contrasting tartness to the rich tuna. I highly recommend it for a great pick me up. \n\nThe service was a hit and miss. As other reviews note exceptional service, I guess I was unfortunate and fell under a miss. \n\nI have to say treat every customer with respect. We are the customer, everyone deserves service with care.\n\nCaffe Central is a great spot to start your day or for a little pick me up. But be aware where the service there seems to fluctuate.", "author": "Rose M."}

She tried mine and said she wished she'd gone for the Vietnamese instead. \n\nI would've given more stars if it weren't for the rude barista. I went when it was slightly busy and the system for getting your drink wasn't very organized. My friend ordered before me and the guy called her drink out with the wrong name, but it was definitely her order. Since I ordered after her and there was a drink that had been sitting out for awhile, I asked him what it was. He wouldn't answer me and just kept calling the name on the cup even though no one was responding to it. I didn't even touch the cup but he grabbed it away when I asked what it was, as if I were a criminal who was going to grab and run. At coffee places, sometimes they get people's names wrong. That's why I asked. He didn't need to be a such a dick about it. I did eventually get my drink and he called out the right name.

My school just a block away so I come here quite often (maybe 3-4 times a week!)\n\nThey use real black and green tea and add milk powder. Now, don't be shocked, I have worked at boba places before and I know that this is how GOOD milk tea is made. Their tea to powder ratio is just right and the resulting milk tea is perfect consistency (not powdery at all! They mix it very well). Also, you can still taste the flavor of the tea (something I look for while judging a milk tea place).\nThey adjust the sugar they add to your drink based on your request. I usually get no sugar because I love the slight bitterness of tea and added honey boba makes my drink sweet enough. That being said, they have one cashier who seems to doubt my order and always ask me whether or not I am 100% sure I want no sugar \"because your drink will taste like tea\"... well DUH. its called milk TEA?! But other than that one cashier, the rest of the staff are nice and experienced. I have gone so much that they recognize me now :)\n\nTheir small size is usually a \"large\" at other boba places and is only $3.50! They also offer a student discount and that lowers my boba price to less than $3.00. So cheap for boba, love it.\nThat price also INCLUDES boba OR aloe vera in the milk tea. How awesome is that? Usual milk tea places usually charge extra for that! You can both into your drink for an extra fee tho. (Although one time I asked for half boba, half aloe, and the cashier didn't charge me... but another time it was that one cashier... she charged me extra and didn't give me my student discount...I'll avoid her now).\n\nAwesome place to get a drink or desserts if you are in the food court and looking for something sweet!\n\nThey also have a drinks stamp card.. Every 10th drink is free!", "author": "Jessica L."}

Considering the price I think Caffe Central is very good.\n\nI have been unable to find contact information for Caffe Central management.  I did not want to air this complaint publicly, but it seems the only way.  I tried to explain to Caffe Central staff, but to no avail.  Caffe Central uses hard plastic containers for take out.  They snap shut in the corners.  No matter how careful I am when I open them the corners break.  I want to reuse the containers, but they are always broken.  \n\nBecause I buy take out every day of the week I bring my own containers to other places who fill them up.  Caffe Central staff refuses to do so.  I tried to explain that my containers weigh more than Caffe Central's and I don't mind paying the premium.  But no.  I was told Caffe Central's scale is calibrated specifically for its own containers and no others would be accepted.  \n\nI hope Caffe Central will read this review and purchase containers that can be reused.
