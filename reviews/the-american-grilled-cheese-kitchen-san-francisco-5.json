I'm extremely shocked with the poor service I received from this place and the woman (Kim) who was \"working\" the day I came in. If I only had the option to give no stars, I would! First off, as I walked in there was no one at the desk to greet me. Waited, and waited so I finally flagged someone down from the back of their kitchen. Second, I didn't have my eyeglasses with me and couldn't see the menu on their wall, so I asked for a printed menu. The response was, oh we don't have one, you need to walk back to the front door and find the menu there, Kim says. Finally, Im ready to order and I'm asked to wait because Kim is in the middle of \"something\". I should have left but I was really hungry so I tried to brush this off. Butttt what really did it for me was when Kim basically slammed/threw my order on my table!

Overall, everything was freshly made in-house, the portion was filling, and the service was friendly. I thought the food was fine but not as good as I'd hoped.  \n\nIt's probably just my personal preference, but I like tomato soup to be a little chunkier and AGCK's is thinner. It did come with lots of croutons on the side, so that helped. The grilled cheese was so-so as well. The mac n cheese was not as cheesy as I'd hope and definitely needed some seasoning. They didn't skimp on the amount of mac for it being a half sandwich, but I just wish the flavor were there. I will note that the sourdough bread held up the sandwich well and it didn't get soggy at all. I think some salt/pepper or hot sauce would've helped the grilled cheese be more robust.

I like grilled cheese so I decided to try it out a couple of days ago. I ordered online directly through their website and decided to get the Red White & Blue Plate Special which is a small size grilled cheese with a soup or salad. I went with the Smokey Tomato soup and Mac & Cheese grilled cheese ($.92) for a total of ($10.60). After ordering I landed up after about 15 minutes as this place is a little far from the downtown lunch circuit.\n\nUpon entering I saw that there were a lot of people waiting for their food. Unfortunately I could not find any sign for online order pickup, so I had to stand in the normal ordering line. This is like the 100th place in FiDi that does not have a simple sign for directing people who order online. What is the point of ordering online and then having to stand in line again? Anyway, thankfully my order was ready and I was on my way.\n\nWhat I got was a fancy box with a tiny burnt Mac and cheese grilled cheese sandwich (see the picture that I've uploaded). It was really a snack size portion that was tasteless as it lacked proper seasoning. This would qualify as the perfect specimen to portray for bad grilled cheese sandwich. The tomato soup on the other hand was pretty good.\n\nPrice wise this was almost 50% more expensive when compared to The Melt, the other specialized grilled cheese place in FiDi with the quality of sandwich being half that of The Melt.

The grilled cheese was indeed pretty nice, but the tomato soup and homemade soda were letdowns.  I'm not against dropping $15 on a bougie grilled cheese meal experience in principle, but I feel like you can get something better at The Melt for a fraction of the cost.\n\nMousetrap: Filled with 3 gooey cheeses (cheddar, havarti, monterey jack) between some crispy sourdough.  A little cheese bubbled through the larger bread holes and got crispy, which was a nice treat during that particular bite.  Definitely beats the pants off of Kraft Singles.\n\nSmoky Tomato Soup: The texture was more like warm tomato juice.  Very watery, quickly soaking the portion of grilled cheese you dip in instead of coating it with a thicker tomato glaze.  I really enjoyed the smoky hints, but the texture just wasn't doing it for me.\n\nBlueberry Lemon Soda: This looked really cool with some viscous blue syrup coming from an unmarked glass bottle then topped with seltzer from the soda fountain hose.  I was hoping for a very sweet and jam-like tasting soda, but instead it was like subtly flavored sparkling water.  Eatsa has much tastier (and sweeter) homemade sodas for less money.", "author": "Adam B."}

We needed a comfortable kid friendly place for lunch after a day at the museum. American Grilled Cheese came up on mobile search, so decided to give it a try. \n\nAWESOME! Kids loved the kids grilled cheese option ~$5. I had the Cubano and the Split Pea Soup. Delicious, toasted to perfection. I liked the flavor of the pulled pork in the sandwich.\n\nAlso ordered a side of fries. They were your standard fries, but the seasoning was really good and when all was said and done, there wasn't a single french fry left. They use a fancy ketchup, which was nice because it doesn't have any corn syrup.\n\nIt's a great option for a casual meal; especially if you've got kids to feed.

They melted a combination of cheeses onto pulled pork and ham, and made the sourdough bread extra crunchy (the best part). They also included pickles or something of that sort, adding the perfect amount of sourness to the sandwich.

I'm a big fan of breakfast sandwiches so ordered the Farmer's Breakfast (cheddar, Zoe's applewood-smoked bacon, roasted potatoes, chive butter) which at $7.50 seemed like a pretty good deal, especially since the grilled cheese sandwiches were all $10+.\n\nThe sandwich came out pretty quickly (5 minutes?). The bread was lightly toasted white bread - nice big slices - with a gooey cheddar cheese and bacon poking out. The over-medium egg was good though I probably could have gone with over-easy since the sandwich was so big it wouldn't have exploded (see my disastrous experience at Plow). The potatoes would have been a nice touch but they were underdone. Pretty hard still and had a pickle flavor (probably from being half raw). \n\nI wasn't going to say anything about the potatoes but when they bused my table (cuz it was so slow, normally you have to bus yourself) and asked the usual \"how was everything?\" I mentioned the potatoes tasted funny. They agreed and said they tried them and thought they were underdone as well and were going to report to the kitchen.

It will probably be the same person that just handled your cash (as well as the five people before you - their cash out of their sweaty bra, or sock, or back pocket, or maybe they wiped their oily nose just before, or dug some gook out of the corner of their eyes, or forgot to wash their hands after they used the bathroom). Yeah, that same hand will, without shame, dig into the strawberries and put them right onto your plate. I've tried to overlook this and just pass on the strawberries. But it gets worse. \n\nTheir forks are standing 'face up'. I'm assuming this is the same for their spoons. Not a problem, but if you ask for a fork (or if one is needed with your meal and so they give you one without asking), the fork is grabbed directly from the tines. Yes, the hands that just handled money, credit cards, dirty cloth to wipe tables, the bottom of a plate off of a dirty counter or table, etc. has now just grabbed your fork by the tines. These tines will now go into your food and then into your mouth. Yep. None of the workers there have any shame about this. I've been there numerous times because I work close and sometimes only have time to run over and grab something real quick. I've seen this REPEATEDLY. My coworkers have too I recently found out, and they don't go there anymore for these same exact reasons. \n\nLast but not least, if you order coffee: the person that just handled your money and 30 other people's money from the morning, will place the lid on your cup and secure it by putting their whole palm (and fingers) all over the lid to get it on there securely. Walah! You now have a secure lid - but with 30+ people's germs all over it. This morning was the last straw for me. That's what happened. I threw the lid away and drank directly from the cup. Albeit my appetite was completely ruined.\n\nI will also send email to management, I really hope they see it. I should have done so months ago. \n\nThis place could be great. If only... \n\nI find it so weird that people working in food service don't know better!!!!!!!! GROSS.\n\nUPDATE: Management has said they will address immediately. #muchappreciated", "author": "Maya N."}

I've walked past this cute little restaurant so many times and decided to give it a shot.  First impression when I walked in was \"this place is so cute! So tiny and simply decorated.\"  As I walk towards the order line and perused through the menu: \"wow price is pretty steep for a grilled cheese.\"  But who knows, I would pay decent money for a good grilled cheese.  I customized my own grilled cheese with two types of cheese, chicken and arugula.

The lunch crowd came around noon and everyone in the kitchen seem to panic and mismatch some orders.  The chefs started arguing in the back in full view of the customers.  It was awkward and unsettling.  The chef then got so irritated because they were unorganized and threw the receipt numbers inside the open boxes and literally just dump those dirty paper in the sandwiches and yelled at the front to pick it up.  \n\nThe food is ok but not worth the price i think. I ordered one turkey sandwich and a tomato soup and I asked for the combo I guess the lady thought I want full orders which totaled to $16.50. A pricey lunch and I waited more than half an hour for a sandwich and soup it was ridiculous.

The promotional picture was pretty, but the real deal resembled a sad supermarket salad. The description says: \"Kale, red pepper, jicama, fennel, red & green cabbage, currants, arugula; topped with edamame & roasted cashews tossed in honey-sesame vinaigrette\" Despite it being the first ingredient, there wasn't much kale to be found (it was mostly arugula). The only bits of red pepper in the salad are the ones visible in the picture, and I couldn't tell what was roasted about the cashews. I should have checked before I walked out, but there was also no sign of the promised housemade garlic croutons, which I was looking forward to. Some of the reviews I've heard so far of MealPass are that restaurants are just packing up smaller, mediocre versions of their dishes for MealPass customers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-17", "description": "I really wanted to like this place.  In fact I gave it about 5 or 6 chances.  Who wouldn't love grilled cheese and tomato soup on a cool SF day?  Sounds like the perfect idea but sadly this place is a rip off.  \n\nThe two times I visited this shop I was happy because I only got the simple grilled cheese.  And like anything else in SF you pay about $10-15 for a simple sandwich.  Not the best deal but that's what we've got.\n\nAnyway, I got a little more adventurous my second and third visits at The American Grilled Cheese by ordering half sandwich/soup combo.  I am gluten free for medical reasons so I am aware/accept that I will always get the \"up charge\" for the switch of bread.  Well, my half gluten free sandwich and soup cost me $18.  What?!  I thought it was a mistake but I didn't question it. \n\nThe third time I tried the HALF sandwich/soup combo- emphasis on half so that I would get the \"deal\".  No, the price rang up around $18.  When I asked the woman at the register, she responded with confusion saying something like, \"oh that's weird, it doesn't register as half a sandwich.  I never noticed that.\"  And instead of correcting it she just shrugged her shoulders.  I was hungry, so I paid.\n\nAfter that trip I swore I would never step foot in their again.  Such a rip off for 2 small pieces of bread, cheese, and \"soup of the day\"....PS I couldn't even get the tomato soup because it has flour in it!\n\nToday a coworker suggested going here and I cringed but for lack of time we went.  I struggled with what to order, but decided to order the avocado toast.  Regular price $6 but $7.50 with the up charge for the gluten free bread.  Fine.  It comes out and I was appalled.  There was 1 measly piece of toast, less than half an avocado with a piece of melted cheese on top.  My first question was who only orders 1 piece of toast?  Was I wrong to assume avocado toast is 2 pieces?  With $7.50 I could buy a loaf of gluten free bread, a package of cheese and an avocado. \n\nThe manager could see I was clearly disappointed.  She asked what was wrong and I kindly explained all of the above.  Her suggestion was to switch my sandwich out for \"Mouse Trap\" sandwich.  When I said I was just disappointed and didn't want anything else she handed me a 10% discount.  Honestly, I'm never going back and would prefer to have my money back.\n\nOverall, this place is basic at best.  It has a great location because there are not a lot of quick lunch options in this area.  It's a shame something better didn't get there first.", "author": "Jean W."}

It was as big of a hit with the adults as it was with the kids! For the adults, there were a variety of add ins you could pick...bacon, tomatoes, caramelized onions, etc. The parents there could not stop raving about having warm, custom made to order grilled cheese sandwiches to enjoy as they watched the kids play. And the kids had fun watching the sandwiches being made right in front of them too! \n\nNot only was the food excellent, but the service was truly above and beyond what I expected. Nate, the founder, and Nicole set up efficiently and effortlessly. They set up so quickly that they even had time to help us with setting up the snacks and side dishes and drinks that we had brought along. I couldn't have been more appreciative, as we were definitely running behind. Then, throughout the party they even helped to re-stock our snacks and drinks without being asked! \n\nThen, during the party, I even spotted Nicole personally delivering plates of sandwiches to people. The adults were running around chasing after their kids, so after she was done making their sandwiches, she sought them out. How amazing is that?!?! With 40+ adults roaming around I'm impressed she could remember who ordered what sandwich!  \n\nThey also both checked in on me to make sure I was getting enough food since they know hosts/hostesses are always running around and don't get much of a chance to eat.

So I asked the woman if that was right- was something missing? She looked at me and said \"what did you expect?\". I said $6 worth of food and then she said \"well do you want a strawberry?\" and tossed 2 into the box. The strawberries eclipsed my sad little Triscuit of a toast. Hmmm, what did I expect?

The grilled cheese is good, but nothing to write home about- decent Cubano, the Mushroom gruerye is pretty bland, the jalapeno popper as fun as it sounds. I love the sandwich and salad deal- the kale slaw is pretty tasty. Because of this I decided to try the Cobb salad. For a place whose name suggests tradition, you would think they could manage to not eff up a cobb salad. It had no avocado, was covered in over tangy balsamic soaked onions, and other than that had barely detectable core ingredients- a few scraps of cheese, chicken and bacon on a ton of lettuce. A rip off for an $11 salad for sure. You can get a much better lunch value at the Roastery down the street. Also, they use fresh bacon where the bacon here tastes like pre-cooked, straight out of a package crap. I'd give it 3 stars if going off the grilled cheese alonee, but in a busy weekday lunch area like this, I think you need to be on your salad game!", "author": "Chelsea T."}
