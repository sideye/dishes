As I walked by I thought - hey another potential lunch spot! I've pretty much eaten up and down Castro Street and been wishing to eat somewhere new.\n\nLunch Special? Sweet! I went ahead and ordered a BBQ Pork, Chicken Green Curry combo. Took that bad boy back to my office nearby.\n\nUnfortunately, I thought the BBQ pork was just ok. The green curry though was just so watery. Lacking flavor and again just very watery. Perhaps it was a bad day? Perhaps it is because it's a lunch special? I always feel terrible for giving a low rating but it is what it is.\n\nI will one of these days give you another try and perhaps just order something from the menu.

Thai Chef's food is authentically good to my taste buds, it's consistently good and fresh, and it's served quickly.\n\nFull disclosure:  there was a time a while back when I noticed that their DPH score was low, and I avoided it for a few months.  They've done a lot of work, and they've brought it up to a very satisfactory 96.\n\nI've had a lot of their dishes, and those that I seem to go back to often are the tom yum soup, the beef salad (mercy, it's good), the red curry, and the pra ram (the curry and the pra ram usually with chicken).  I tend to stay away from the duck dishes, as I do at many Thai and Chinese places, because there's never enough duck for my taste, and what there is tends to be too fatty for me.  \n\nIt's fast, it's pleasant, the waitstaff is lovely, the food is great (try the beef salad), and the prices are reasonable.", "author": "Earline A."}

Through one way or another, since living in the 94114 zip-code, this place has quite grown on me as an easy option for when my boyfriend and I aren't feeling like wandering too far, since Thai Chef is right around the corner from us.\n\n-My favorite appetizer prawn rolls, is very nostalgic of my mum's cooking and some of the finger foods I was exposed to early on as a child.  A tightly wound cellophane noodle, minus the veggie mixture that is perhaps the most minimal item on the menu. Perhaps some pickled daikon, or a cucumber side salad would be a nice complement?!\n\n-Duck was perfectly crisp, and complemented simply with flash fried Chinese broccoli and a sweet & sour sauce\n-I also enjoy the duck served in red curry, which has some subdued heat to it.  Usually duck curries I've had elsewhere are highly fatty, but it's nice that they clean up the impurities so there isn't too much suspended grease.\n\n-Pumpkin curry with seafood has become one of my favorite staples, it is savory, delicious, and artfully presented in a hollowed out squash.  It really looks like someone had fun conceptualizing this dish, but most importantly the execution always has been consistent every time i've ordered it.\n\n-Yellow curry, of the non-greasy variety, with moist /succulent chicken and potatoes..  Hearty, warm, and usually a loft sized portion that carries over until the next day for lunch-time leftovers at work.\n\n-Mango prawn fried rice was the perfect blend of savory and sweet, the perfect amount for sharing, and a great alternative to plain Jasmine or brown rice (depending on varying degrees of hunger).\n\nThe only negative comment I have about Thai chef is the table for 2 at the front window, it is VERY awkward!

Unfortunately, my most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be back, especially since there are other similar choices in the neighborhood.  \n\nFour friends and I came here for dinner, expecting to eat family style.  The waiter wasn't exactly helpful with entree choices and gauging whether or not we had ordered enough food.  No sooner was the food put on the table then he asked how everything was.  Considering we hadn't even finished putting food on our plates, we couldn't answer.  We passed the food around and enjoyed most of our meal.  The dishes were tasty, although the portions were on the small side.  \n\nTowards the end of dinner, the conversation turned to the meal itself and we realized that the fried duck dish had barely any meat in it it.  (We were too busy during dinner to talk about it and each one of us figured that we were the only ones who hadn't tasted it.)  There was literally one small piece of meat at the bottom of the plate of fried batter.  Only one person actually received any duck and the rest of us had eaten fried bits of air.  I quietly pulled the waiter aside to explain the situation and ask that that dish be comped or discounted.  Instead of working with me on the issue, he blamed us for not knowing how much meat would be in the dish.  The situation escalated because he was extremely defensive.  He walked away, spoke with another waiter at the front, then decided that the best course of action was to ignore us for a while without coming back and at the very least, bringing the bill. \n\nA friend then took the matter to the front register.  The waiter was very rude, told him that we should have ordered five dishes of the duck if we each wanted to taste the duck meat.  It was ridiculous.  He made the situation much worse by blaming us for trying to order family style.  The other waiters argued with him as well.  It was in poor form.  Apparently, there wasn't a manager on duty to smooth over the small issue that could have easily and quickly been resolved.

Very bad karma awaits this horrible creature.\nThis is the review by my fellow Yelper who had the unfortunate experience of eating there:\nTwo words: rip off. I ordered the Tom Yum Soup. It cost me $12, plus I gave $3 on a TO-GO order (too generous). When I got the soup, it was HALF WAY full. I asked if this was the large order (I ordered the large), and they said yes. I asked if they could ask the kitchen to fill it up because it's awfully expensive for how much they give. I was given a total attitude by one of the employees and an eye roll by another. One actually said, \"well what do you want me to do; you keep complaining.\" I handed it to him and asked that he have them fill it up. The kitchen did, but I could tell there was animosity about it. Never again will I ever return. Learn some customer service skills and be more generous with your portions, Thai Chef, and maybe you will be a more successful restaurant.\n\nI will add that it was 6:30 pm and the ENTIRE PLACE WAS EMPTY. I know why. Bad ju-ju.", "author": "David B."}

And typically, when I crave Thai food, it's because I want some green curry or pad thai; but I wanted to venture out and try something new. So, I opted for the crispy noodles.\n\nBut I didn't know crispy noodles were served with a slimy sauce (or what they call \"special sauce\" or \"gravy\"). That's not normal, is it? It can't be. What a combination: some of the noodles were crispy and the rest were soggy and swimming in some slimy sauce. \n\nI tried to pick out the crispy noodles that had yet to mingle with the sauce. It became a game, but just ended with me being sad and hungry. So I decided to try a bite of the spring roll (stuffed with silver noodles, cabbage, carrot, Chinese sausage, and shrimp), which was just OK, but can someone tell me what's in Chinese sausage?

When the server came over to verify the problem there was no recall of the mention of the allergy, but she said she'd tell the kitchen.  Several minutes later, his meal arrived again (the experienced waiter in me thought it was WAY too fast) sans carrot garnish.  And as my friend tucked into his meal, he fished out a carrot on the second bite!  They had simply removed the garnish and sent it back out, completely ignoring his need for NO carrots, as if the carrots weren't infusing into the sauce....  \nAnd to top if off, we had to argue with them to remove it from the bill (they didn't even offer any form of redress).\nIn my opinion, this blatant disregard for the safety and health of their patrons is completely unacceptable and if I could give them zero stars I would.  \nAs a former server with 18 years of experience, I am appalled at the cavalier attitude and lack of responsibility from the entire staff; kitchen, server and management.  \nI will NEVER AGAIN eat here.", "author": "James G."}

Sorry if I don't understand.. but these noodles are what you will find as a garnish on Asian dishes.. nobody makes an entire entree of out of it.  In fact, I just had it a few nights ago at the Cheesecake Factory.. as a garnish/decoration for my avocado eggrolls.  Maybe I'd be less disappointed if there was more tofu and shrimp, but the dish was actually entirely fried vermicelli.  And that's not even the worst part.  The worst part is that I probably got a cavity from it!  The sauce was disgustingly and overly sweet.  It made my Coke taste like water and my teeth were crying. Ugh... Also, it was happy hour.  Drink were buy one get one free but appetizers were only 10% off.  That's about ... a whole 80 cents.\n\nThe waiters were nice and I like their folded red napkins.

So the market in the Castro is for mediocre food, but Thai Chef really is a lot better than that.\nI've eaten here at least 10 times and I am always impressed with the freshness of the food. The fake picket fence on the storefront has gotta go, but otherwise its in the top 5 of the neighborhood.\nStaff is friendly and efficient.

The lady in front said we'll sit you guys by the window so people can see people eating. Fine by me.\n\nWe ordered garlic pepper seafood and beef. My friend said oh it won't be spicy since she ordered it at other restaurants and they're not which is fine with me since I'm not a spicy kind of eater. My cousin ordered the Pad Sieu(sp). The wait for the food wasn't that bad. Then we tasted the garlic pepper dishes and they were freaking spicy as hell. We asked one of the waiters if it's usually spicy since other restaurants garlic pepper isn't. He said yes they are usually spicy and instead of offering if we would like another dish or ask the chef to get another serving to be not as spicy he just left.I should say the other dishes were good though.\n\nThen came the check. We were only a party of 4 but they charged us included in the total a 18% gratuity! We asked them why we were charged gratuity since it's usually for a party of 5 or more. What they said was it's not on the menu but their boss said they can charge it anytime they want. WTH! And she said to be honest a lot of people don't tip. Um lady how does that pertain to us?

I point out that their sign says they close at 10pm. They still refuse to serve anybody that walks in. Finally after being turned away so many times I asked why they won't take anyone and what their policy is. I came to find out they have an owner who refuses to pay them any overtime they work or pay them after a certain time. This was really sad to hear as the employee was quite upset as he talked about it. \n\nAlso, as of today there is a notice on the front door posted by the health department that they have been shutdown temporarily due to violations. This is not very inviting. But what upset me more is that there is a larger more prominent sign written in marker that they are closed for remodeling.

The waitstaff were very nice, however, they didn't come around enough to refill my water.  And they weren't very fast to bring the check, but that's my experience with most Thai restaurants.  The restaurant really began to fill up around 7:30.\n\nThe food was delicious, but the portions were average.  My friends and I shared about 10 dishes, including flavored rice, between 10 people.  It was enough to fill everyone up, but we only had a small taste of every dish.\n\nA rough estimate of the dishes we had:  cucumber salad, chicken satay, fresh spring rolls, veggie green curry, chicken yellow curry, salmon red curry, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken cashew nut, something with prawns, ginger rice, coconut rice, garlic rice, and fried bananas at the end.  I can't remember what else we had, but it was all pretty good.\n\nThe dishes I really enjoyed were:  pad see ew, pad thai with tofu, chicken cashew nut, and garlic rice.  The pad see ew was like every other one I've had, but delicious nonetheless.  The pad thai noodles were cooked perfectly and it didn't have the weird overly vinegary taste some pad thais have!  However, it needed more side veggies and tofu.  Everyone loved the garlic chicken!  The garlic rice had a really great flavor that wasn't overpowering. \n\nIn my opinion, there wasn't enough chicken in the yellow curry, nor enough salmon in the red curry.  They seem to be kinda skimpy on the meat and tofu here, except in the case of the chicken cashew nut.\n\nThe greatest thing about this restaurant is that I brought a birthday cake for my friend, and they were kind enough to serve it to us, birthday candle and all!\n\nFor ten people, including appetizers, two desserts, various drinks, we escaped out of there with a bill of about $165.

If this restaurant were anywhere else I would avoid it like the plague.  Every time the service is below average at best but the last time was the absolute worse.  Yes I admit this was a busy Sunday evening but the cheap owner should hire more staff on the weekends rather than subject the single waiter to run the entire restaurant.  After seating us the waiter never came over so about 15 mins later the hostess came over to our table to take our orders.  I ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken and fresh garden rolls, my friend ordered the chicken friend rice.  Thirty minutes later a chef in the kitchen only brought my friend's dish over and it was completely wrong!  The guy who brought out the tray tried to make excuses for the wrong dish and then tried to get my friend to accept the wrong dish!  But we insisted that he go back to the kitchen and bring what he ordered.  Meanwhile my order was no where to be found and when I asked the chef he acted like he didnt know what I was talking about.  About 15 minutes later another chef (I assume) finally brought out my friend's chicken fried rice while my order never appeared.  I asked the guy where my food was and he said he would check.  He never came back.   Finally about 20 minutes later I asked the hostess where my food was and she ran to the kitchen and came back five minutes later and said they forgot to make it.  Then she walked away.  No apologies, nothing.  So after waiting for about 15 more minutes I ate half of my friends dinner and as we were about to leave they finally brought out my dinner.  When we told the guy we were leaving he looked at us like we were completely crazy.  I told him we had been there for over an hour and I never got my food and we were leaving.  I asked them to put my food in a To Go bag.  About ten minutes later they came out with my food to go along with a complimentary iced tea.  That's it?  I sit in this restaurant for over an hour with no food and they give me a free iced tea?  When I asked if they would take my order off the bill the hostess looked away and asked an older guy (who I assume was the owner) to come over.  He was incredibly rude and said we were to pay the bill in full.  Are you kidding me?!  This place is a total joke and I would not recommend it for anyone, no matter how drunk you are when you leave Badlands.  \n\nIf you want mediocre service with hateful staff who dont care at all about customers then I highly recommend this joke of a restaurant.

I have given him my address and phone number (which he can confirm is valid since he called it) and he still did not cook the food.  \n\nOK, maybe this is petty but I was in rush, double parked and then come home with no food.

Gorgeous host! Shame I can't remember, but I believe my friend had the pad kee mao, which he seemed to have enjoyed, as well as his order of tom ka soup with chicken. I had not had pad thai in so long, and was happy to try Thai Chef 2's rendition of the dish. The overarching flavor I got, even after generous squeezes of lemon, was mostly sweet. I did run into one pocket of spicy (which I could have increased if I had asked for condiments, but decided against), but thought the traditional mix of spicy, sour, sweet, salty, and possibly even bitter could have been more present in the dish. Beautiful presentation, and timely, friendly service. So three-and-half stars for flavor, but four stars overall. Did I mention the host was hot?", "author": "Ryan T."}

The beer and wine list is REALLY short and REALLY from aisle 3 at 7Eleven, so if you have a table at home and anything that's a step up from Bud Light (not kidding) or cooking sherry, I'd get your food to go.  I like the food and service at Thailand Restaurant better (plus it's family owned), but Thai Chef delivers.  Cold + Rain = Tolerance for Average.  Most of the food I've had at Thai Chef is ok - not great, not bad.  Haricot vert in the panang curry chicken is a little odd, but not a big deal and otherwise good.  The green curry fried rice is really good as a share plate.  Even with chicken or beef, there are better options if it's the only thing you're ordering.  The appetizers are very average, basically things that have been fried.  Hard to mess that up, but nothing stands out.  One thing I have to point out, they serve the absolute worst pad thai I've ever had.  It's cloying, sweet and syrupy with overcooked starchy noodles.   I asked for some lime to cut through the sweetness (isn't that normally served with Pad Thai anyway???) and the server brought back lemon.  I said, \"No, I meant lime\" and he walked away and returned with a bigger plate of lemons.\n\nService has been really hospitable on most occassions, but one night we were sitting at our table waiting to be served and they brought our food out in take-out containers bagged and ready to go because, well, it seems that they were ready to go.\n\nI'd rather give it 2.5 stars, but I know I'll keep eating here so I'm rounding up.  In short, if you're walking by and it's that time of day, there are worse places to stop.    Otherwise, it isn't any better than the 3 other Thai restaurants you could walk to in any neighborhood.", "author": "P J."}

The brown rice is delicious is definitely worth the extra $0.50, and the yellow curry, pad thai, and pad kee mao were delicious. We asked for extremely spicy, and only the curry was mildly spicy, but they brought out a rack of spices for our use if needed; this would be my only complaint- not enough heat. I loved that the food was very light though, for a Thai restaurant, as I generally feel a bit over-stuffed and heavy after a single Thai dish (if I can finish it), but here I felt great and satisfied. Not to say that it wasn't enough food, but it seemed healthier and less just overcooked in too much oil. Definitely check these guys out!

A simple box of a space with a modern edge and touches of asiatic accents.  Usually not a problem grabbing a table unless you come with a big party, but even then the tables are easily configured, and eating alone here is just fine too.  The reception is always friendly unless the host is distracted by too many takeout orders; the initial service is sometimes spotty, but once your order is in, the food comes quickly. \n\nFood/Beverage.  Of the many Thai restaurants in the City, I find the food here fresh and delicious.  Definitely a fun place to go with a group so that many dishes can be ordered and shared family-style.*  As with all ethnic cuisines, there are many styles, and I happen to like the offerings here.  Be it spicy or not, I find that the ingredients of every dish all pop with distinctive taste and texture.  Examples: the claypot seafood will have your senses swimming as soon as the lid is uncovered and the fragrant, curried steam rises from the morsels of fish, shellfish and vegetables; even the simple pad see eiw with beef is a perfect combination of soft wide noodles, tender marinated beef and crisp braised greens, with a light sauce that does not drown out the various components.  As for drinks, not much of a wine list, so stick to something simple like a glass of sauvignon blanc, or just order a Singha beer or hot tea.\n\n* Query: what's with diners in asian restaurants ordering individual \"entrees\" and not sharing?  come on, when in Rome... oops, wrong continent but you get the picture...", "author": "Yan L."}

I told him, in a friendly tone of voice, that I felt it would be better service in the future if they tell customers who order vegetarian dishes that the soup they serve to everyone is not vegetarian.  The person I spoke to got very defensive told me the responsibility lies on me to ask whether the soup is vegetarian.  I didn't argue with him, but this felt like extremely poor customer service.

And, by the way, they overcharged me for my entr\u00e9e, and even after I pointed out the error and they re-did the bill, it still had the same overcharge.  I would not recommend eating at this restaurant.", "author": "Dave S."}

This place is ok, they are priced decently but the food isn't that great. The one great thing on the menu is the tofu satay. The pad thai and the pineapple fried rice are meh.", "author": "V R."}

Definitely not edible.  I took it back and showed the manager - they didn't know what it was either, and gave me my $ back.", "author": "ROGER C."}

The service was fine and the prices are reasonable but basically its just very bland Thai food. The food has no flavor at all. I find  can't find any reason why I would wanna go back again.", "author": "eric b."}
