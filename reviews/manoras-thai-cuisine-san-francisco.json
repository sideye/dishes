You can pick 2 entrees and it comes with Thai fried rice and lemon chicken soup. I ordered the garlic pork and the yellow chicken curry.\n\nThe lemon chicken soup came out first and I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with citrus, but the soup was light and refreshing. It sort of reminded me of a Malaysian laksa soup, which I love! It also had a huge, tender chicken thigh in it. The combo plates came next, and at first they look like small portions, but since I got two protein dishes, I was pretty full afterwards. The garlic pork was a little salty, but still yummy with rice, and the yellow chicken curry was creamy and flavorful. The chicken was also super tender like in the soup (I suspect another thigh piece). I didn't even finish my rice. One thing I wish I could've changed is swapping the rice for salad or veggies of some sort. The combo plate was definitely protein heavy.\n\nService was friendly and they fit 8 of us a table at lunch time, though we went a little early. Overall Manora's is a good choice for lunch in SoMa. Also btw, their yelp check-in deal of the $9.50 lunch special is no longer valid.", "author": "Tara A."}

After traveling through SEA for 6 months last year, I'm only now starting to crave the delicious savory and spicy flavors again. We landed at Manora Thai Cuisine after Yelping for a little bit. Yelp did us right. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty quiet for a Thursday evening. It's really peaceful inside and decorated nicely. \n\nThree dishes to share\n*Gang Gari Gai -- yellow chicken curry cooked in coconut milk with potato. It was served with a little portion of sweet cucumber salad. This dish was fantastic. The favor of the curry rich, but not overwhelming and chicken was so soft and tender.  The added potato carb also went really well in the dish. It was completely drenched in gravy. 5/5\n\n*Nur Pad Prik -- Sauteed beef with sweet basil in spicy chilli garlic sauce. Just as good if not better than the chicken dish. More savory, beautiful color and perfect with white rice. We went for medium spice, which was pretty mild for us. I would come back for these two dishes alone. 5/5\n\n*Pad Thai -- with how good the first two dishes were, we were expecting a pretty good pad thai, but this is where there was a drastic drop in quality. Reason being the excessive use of fish sauce. It tasted funky because they used way too much. My partner doesn't eat seafood, but loved pad thai. This took away the dish for him and I was left to finish all of it. Which I didn't do because the portion is HUGE. 2/5\n\nThe service is friendly. All the male servers wore tropical shirts, but it didn't quite go with the restaurant's ambiance. Of course that should not deter you. Great choice for Thai and we will probably get take out from here again. \n\nThe prices were reasonable too. $36 for all that plus two rice bowls. Sweet deal.", "author": "Priti K."}

We ordered a papaya salad, a beef dish (nur pad prik), pad thai, and mango sticky rice for dessert. \n\nMy partner isn't always a fan of Thai cuisine because he doesn't like spicy (as in \"hot\") dishes. I've learned to love spice over the years, and so can handle the default heat at a place like Lers Ros; however, all of the dishes at Manora's came out mild by default (per other Yelp reviews, it appears you can up the levels on request), which made for a much more enjoyable experience for him. \n\nThe papaya salad was one of the best ones I've tasted if not the best. Bright, fresh, tart, clean flavors. The dressing was so tasty that when we were done with the salad, I used my spoon to scoop up what remained of the dressing and drank it. Also drizzled it on my rice (which, BTW, you need to order separately if you want rice; I don't think it comes with any of the dinner time dishes). \n\nThe nur pad prik was a dish I've never tried before but we both enjoyed it immensely. The beef was tender and cooked nicely; the sauce was flavorful but as with the papaya salad, mild by default in terms of heat (which in no way diminished how tasty it was). \n\nPad thai is a dish I've gotten many times from many different restaurants and Manora's was great. Possibly a little bit on the sweeter side but also tangy and eggy, and as with all of the other dishes we ordered, packed with flavor. \n\nWe concluded with an order of the mango sticky rice, one of my favorite desserts of all time. The sticky rice part was perfection: the rice was served piping hot, the coconut sauce and crunchy bits added textural and flavor contrasts; however, the mango itself was the one weak spot in our meal. It was fine, but considering that mangos are in season right now, not nearly as good as other mangos I've had recently (in fact, it was the second mango of the day for me as I'd had one for breakfast and that one was much better -- tarter and more intensely mango-flavored). \n\nMango complaint aside, we would absolutely go back to Manora's again and plan to do so soon. My partner, who as I mentioned earlier, isn't always the biggest fan of Thai cuisine, said he would go back to try their lunch special if he's in the area, and that's actually saying a lot because he doesn't generally eat Thai food unless he's with me. \n\nOne final note: they have a bar area, but had no cocktails listed on the menu. I ended up ordering a glass of wine but would have been curious to learn what cocktails they offer (and probably should have inquired, I guess!).", "author": "Maya B."}

The fish cakes tasted nice but those are only the 3rd thai fish cakes I've tried so not qualified to comment. The beef Penang curry had good flavor as well. It was very different from the Penang curry I'm used to though. This one had soft cooked carrots in it which actually didn't distract from the flavor or make it too sweet. It was far more oily than any I've ever had and the beef was thick cut, again, not the typical style I'm used to. I was thinking it was going to let me down but the flavor didn't.

Not a typical Thai restaurant, I saw many unique options on the menu that I normally do not see elsewhere which made it hard to decide what to order! I went with three dishes:\n\nLarb - this is my go to dish anytime I get Thai food. This one was great, it had a good spice level but not overkill so I could taste all the ingredients, not too saucy as well as I've had Larb that was drowning in itself before. The bonus was the big avocado slice! It had a good amount of minced chicken and all the greens were crisp!\n\nSalad Kak - Listed on the menu as seasonal veggies this salad mostly consisted of bamboo sprouts, greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, half an avocado and hardboiled eggs. It was topped with fried tofu slices and a peanut sauce. Without the tofu and peanut sauce this would have been a pretty basic salad, but this particular dish introduced me to an amazing flavor combo: hard boiled egg + peanut sauce! Ohhh my I fell in love with that flavor combination!\n\nKai Yad Sai - aka Thai style omelette. This is what I imagine Thai \"soul\" food to be. A thin layered omelette stuff with crab, shrimp, and minced chicken with thai spices (not spicy though). It also contained peas, onions and peppers and came with a mild red semi-sweet chili sauce. The peas were an unexpected but nice addition. It was so satisfying it gave me that homey feel. \n\nThe restaurant itself was nicely decorated, with a small flower and candle on the table. Large red cloth napkins are provided and the placemats are leather embossed with the logo. I went in on a Tuesday night around 9PM it was not busy and the service was quick and attentive. My water was refilled as needed and I had different employees check on me and run my food. \n\nPrice was good as I spent $28 on three dishes before tip!

I phoned to be sure they would take a take-out order for 30 people - no problem.\n\nI went into the restaurant the day prior to place the order in person.  I had typed up what I wanted, nine different dishes in various quantities.  I handed the woman my order and she looked at it and told me that six of the dishes were not available for lunch and needed to be replaced.  She gave me a lunch menu and then told me I was taking too long and that she couldn't wait.  Long story short, I perused the menu, updated my order, and then waited about 45 minutes for her to come back.\n\nShe looked at the order, went over it line by line, recopied it into Thai on a carbon order sheet, and then took my credit card (a little weird, but ok).  When I paid (almost 300$) she offered to let me take a picture of the receipt (written in Thai) so that I would have a copy (hmmm ?).\n\nWe picked up the food the next day, and bless their hearts they were running a little behind, but oh well.\n\nWhen we got to the office, we realized that they had left out four orders of pan-fried noodles (the very reason we had ordered Thai). . .I called but no answer.  By the time the party was over, they were closed for lunch, so I went back at 5:30 (when they opened for dinner). I told the host what happened, and that I wasn't mad, I just wanted a refund. He yelled that it was my mistake, and that I was lying. . .over and over again. . .from across the room. . .in front of several patrons. . .at some point his co-worker joined in.  Eventually I was told to come back the next day to talk to the woman who took my order.  \n\nI went back again the next day, and this time the woman did the berating (seriously?). Again, I told her I wasn't mad, everything else was right, it was an honest mistake, but I did want to be refunded. First she said I was lying, she had packed the whole order herself.  Then she said the four dishes were noodles in sauce not pan-fried. When I matched the orders (both typed and handwritten) to two pan-fried noodle dishes on the menu, she said she knew she had packed them all in one bag. I told her that made perfect sense, I just hadn't received the bag, she offered to give me the food, right then.  I explained that I didn't have any use for four orders of pan-fried noodles.  She said that they never give refunds only food.\n\nLong story short, I asked for the owner, she took my information, said she'd give it to the owner that night, and that the owner would call me. . .it has now been 15 days. . .no call from the owner.  \n\n. . . . sigh. . .it is unbelievable that the staff of this restaurant would be so dishonest and abusive. . .very sad. . .", "author": "Rachel S."}

I don't think I've been to Manora's since I've been Yelping, and that's a long time not to go to a neighborhood Thai place, don't you think? Nothing horrible happened to me. I honestly can't remember why I never returned. But in need of a Thai fix, Jamie W. and I decided to give it a go. Heavy on traditional Thai decor or at least the Cost Plus version of it, Manora's offers pretty decent food albeit in rather skimpy servings.\n\nWe tried three dishes, so let me give you an itemized checklist. First, we went predictable and ordered the $8.95 Pad Thai, which was the standard mix of pan-fried rice noodles with shrimp, tofu, egg and bean sprouts (see photo). Good enough but skimpy. Then, we segued into the $8.95 Ped-Tod-Ka-Na-Grob, crispy, batter-fried slices of roast duck served with fried basil and a sweet chili garlic sauce (see photo). Tasty stuff but not nearly enough. Last was the $7.95 Kai-Yad-Sai, a seafood-stuffed omelet with crab, shrimp and some chicken as well (see photo). This was the right size but it wasn't helped too much by the chile sauce.\n\nNow the rice they give you plenty of, for sure. Oh now, I remember why I haven't come back. We were still kinda hungry when we were done and weren't in the mood for fried banana balls, whatever those are. Service, I have to confess, was on the perfunctory side like automatic pilot with a flickering light. I just like the quality and quantity to be found at Basil Thai further up Folsom, even if they don't have the Bangkok-style ambiance. Now wait, what was the name of the place I was talking about?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty good Thai but they should give seconds\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...heavy on the Bangkok vibe in here\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...they buzz by with haste\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I think I'll come back if I can only remember the name", "author": "Ed U."}

It was not as spicy as I had hoped, but overall pretty good... but nothing too exciting.. i guess it's hard to mess up papaya salad?\n\n2. tom yum talay: it's a soup dish, and i had requested them to add glass noodles to the soup.   It was good, but didn't blow my mind away. I've had better soup elsewhere. i have to say there were a lot of spices used for this soup... maybe a bit too much???  I was really thirsty after drinking the soup!  \n\n\n3. pad thai:  Of course we had to order pad thai to ultimately make our judgement of this thai restaurant.  I am glad we did. Pad thai was the best dish for us here. every strand of noodle was very flavorful, and the noodles were cooked and stirred fried just right.  I think they are very good at stir frying or pan frying at this restaurant.\n\n\nOverall, it was A-OK for a Michelin recommended restaurant.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

We ending up at Manora after seeing some good reviews on yelp. My first impression was, ok it's pretty packed. Must be good. The restaurant itself was a bit on the small side. The waitress sat the four of us next to what looks like a loud group, celebrating a birthday. We noticed that we were given only three menus for the four of us. upon asking the waiter for another menu, he replied, \"we don't have enough. \" WTF? really? Then as we made our order, we asked the waiter if we can make it two separate bill? The waiter stood back and gave us this dirty ass look, like are you serious? He took a 30 second pause and finally opened his mouth and said, it's too busy I don't think we can. \" I almost wanted to slap the taste out of his mouth for giving us that dumb ass look. \n\nNow as far as the food goes, we ordered the special soft shell crab appetizer, crispy duck, seafood pong ping? , and egg rolls and larb.  The duck and soft shell crab was delicious. I don't know if $9 for one small crab was worth the price. but it was good.

I always love me some chili powder that made it better. Nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain about.\n\nYellow curry chicken was extremely disappointing. Only had dark chicken meat (I'm more of a bones fan and white meat fan myself) and potatoes in there. Was not what I was hoping for at all. Didn't have any coconut flavor either.. which I'm pretty sure is a staple of thai restaurants!\n\nService was whatever. The servers there definitely don't look the happiest, but they get the job done. \n\nOne last thing - their menu is kinda hard to read if you're lazy like me.. or not a fob from Thailand. It took me forever to find a curry and didn't even realize there was a green curry which I had been craving (only found out when I heard the table next to us ordered it).

Unfortunately, Manora's did not live up to any of the accolades. \n\nUpon entering we were assessed by an inquisitive host; he seemed to wonder what could have possibly compelled us to walk in the door. Perhaps he was trying to warn us.\n\nWe were invited to sit at \"any of the tables for two.\" The only other two-top had us shoulder to shoulder with another couple. I don't mind close quarters, but the fact that the large restaurant was nearly empty left us feeling crammed in a corner for no good reason.\n\nOnce seated we noticed the table and place-mats were quite sticky.

We were originally going to go to another place, but it wasn't open yet so we opted for Manora.\n\nAs we sat down, we noticed some rather foul scents in the air...not ones I am used to.  Once we acclimated, we ordered our food.  I wanted Pad Si Ew, but realized that it wasn't on the menu (even though it's listed on the site) so I had to settle for another noodle dish.  It had chicken and shrimp along with veggies.  I started eating it and had a piece of chicken on my fork.  I noticed that the chicken looked a little uncooked, but I ate it anyway.  When I bit down on it, it was indeed raw on the inside.  There's nothing worse on the teetch than raw chicken.  \n\nThe entire dish was rather one savory note.  There was just salt and a bit of spice...nothing else.  I was very disappointed.  I was pretty much done after a few bites.\n\nMy partner had the Green Curry Chicken.  He asked the waiter if it was spicy and he said no, so he ordered it as he has a sensitive stomach.  Needless to say, it was INCREDIBLY spicy.

Not bad...not bad at all!\n\nI wasn't expecting super delicious Thai food, or any other food, around us, but I wanted to try a new place today.  Ordered the lunch combo ($8.95) with #7 and #11, the spicy curry beef stew and basil beef.  I must say this is a really good deal for a 2 item with rice and soup for less than $10.  The soup was a lot better than expected.  They actually have a lot of chicken in soup...the lemon chicken soup with mushrooms.  Loved it!  The combination selection had 11 items on the list, which is great if you're going with friends and can all share and try each other's!  Their portions are pretty generous. \n\nBeef curry stew was satisfying, but the beef basil was a little off.  The beef tasted a little too tough, but the taste was good.  The combo  comes with fried rice, which I thought was pretty bad.  I think steamed rice would've tasted a lot better with the combo meats I ordered. \n\nI could barely finish my meal and had to save it for dinner.

This has been a long time favorite restaurant of hers, and I guess it's genetic because I admit it's one I frequent also.\n\nEnvironment:\nWhen you first walk in there is a large tree that looms over the entry doors. Lovely paintings adorn the walls. A large wooden partition wall breaks up the open room nicely. There are always fresh cut, health flowers on vases on each table.\n\nService:\nThe service is always prompt and polite. All of the staff wear seemingly authentic colorful Thai clothing that certain adds to their charm.\n\nCuisine (The most important part!)\nDelicious! I've had almost every item on the menu, and I have no complaints. The highlights I'd recommend would be the coconut chicken soup. It's my absolute favorite. Moist chicken swimming in a tangy lemongrass coconut milk broth with white button mushrooms and cilantro floating on the surface. The Pad Thai is also not to be missed. Pad Thai is the go-to for many, and this restaurant must put magic in their sauce, it's just too good to be true. The papaya salad is really lovely. I normally order it mild. I love the crunchy, sour, spicy refreshing salad. The menu options are very affordable and you get quite a large portion for the price.\n\nOverall\nThis place is a gem that's been around much longer than I have been (referencing the first paragraph) and I'm glad to see it's still here and thriving.

We ordered tom yum goong, beef satay, pad thai, and som-tum. My favorite was the pad thai, which I actually don't usually order if the restaurant has pad kee mao, but I still enjoy nonetheless. The highlight of the pad thai here is definitely in the flavors - savory, a little sour, not too sweet, and some spice. I'm not a fan of peanuts, which is unfortunate because I love Thai and Vietnamese food, but I deal with it. However, the beef satay had too strong of a peanut flavor for me, and was a little dry as well. That being said, if you like peanuts, that`s probably a great dish. The papaya salad was on par with the pad thai in terms of quality, so not much to say there. But tom yum goong is one of my favorite soups in the world because it incorporates all my favorite flavors: salty, spicy, and sour. Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment last night because it wasn't spicy at all, and too sweet for me. The meats and vegetables in the soup, on the other hand, were great! \n\nReasonable prices, and great service. In fact, we left to go play games across the street at around 8PM. At around 10:45, we were getting ready to leave The Willows when I realized that my DSLR wasn't there, so I ran across the street to check if I had left it there.

It was *really* tasty: again, not overly spicy but certainly enough kick to satisfy. My BF got his favorite Thai selection, yellow chicken curry with potato (aka Gang-Gari-Gai) and this was a total league of its own, standing far out (in a good way) from the other versions he's ordered. It was completely healing and comforting.

The yellow curry chicken was so watery like a soup and you could hardly taste the curry! I was shocked, since this is such an easy dish to make! It was more like chicken soup with potatoes and carrots! The chicken satay was ok, nothing fabulous. We had a large group of twenty people and I asked to have an order for each group of four people instead of one giant order and bill. At first the waiter claimed he couldn't do it (wth?) and only when everyone at the table insisted on it that he changed his mind! Jeez!

We ordered the lunch combination which I think is the best value. It includes Thai fried rice and a cup of lemon chicken soup and your choice of 2 dishes out of a list of 11. I took me a while to think what I want because all of them looks good to me. \n\nI tried satay beef and Thai BBQ chicken in sweet garlic sauce while this time I went for fish cake with fresh/sweet cucumber which compliment the fish cake very well with the sweet sauce. I also ordered the saute beef in chili garlic and basil. I would say the beef is a bit tough but it is very beefy indeed and I like it. My coworker had the BBQ chicken which he likes very much, it's juicy and tender he said and no need for the sauce because it's very tasty already and I agree. He also likes the spicy beef curry with sweet basil. I like the fact that they use beef brisket so it's very very tender and juicy. I also forgot, the lemon chicken soup is very good too.

If you can't tell, I'm eating my way through all of them--15 bucks at a time. Manora's food is worthy of three stars, but the service is spectacular--and not just for an Asian restaurant. So four stars.\n\nMy friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes and shared them, including Tom Yum Talay (spicy seafood soup), Gang-Ped-Ped-Yang (roast duck curry), Pad Thai, Asparagus with Lobster Sauce, and Mango with Sticky Rice. It was a lot of food for three people, but we love to eat and have a little of everything. \n\nThe Tom Yum Talay was dynamite--I just couldn't get enough of the flavors and spiciness. The Gang-Ped-Ped-Yang was delicious--duck is my new favorite meat in curry (it's all about the fatty but fabulous skin). The Pad Thai was pretty good but I prefer the one at King of Thai Noodle House, which is more saucy. The Asparagus with Lobster Sauce was all right--you'd think lobster would make everything superb but you're wrong. The Mango and Sticky Rice was a good, sweet ending to our night.\n\nI'm pretty sure I went to sleep at 11PM (very early for me) because I couldn't stay awake after inhaling all that.

Maybe I am ordering the non-spectacular dishes, but for the most part, it was good at best, but not enough to get itself 4-5 stars.\n\nAte dinner here on a Fri. night before going to a bday party. They did not take 2 person resos, so we had to wait for approximately 10-15 minutes. We were impressed by the many accolades on the walls; from Best Thai Restaurant in SF, Zagat Rated, Best 100 Thai Restaurant in the World, etc. This place has to be good, right? Um, yeah, sure.\n\nThe place was packed and we were seated against the front window. It is super casual here. I mean, we were not that dressy, but we looked like a homecoming couple compared to the other customers. I thought I was eating in SJ for a second. Nothing wrong with that, but don't expect lipstick glam and LA glitter here.\n\nWe ordered the following with comments:\n\n1. Soft Shelled Crab - this was their special for the day and it was below average. The batter was so thick, we felt like we were eating fried batter, not the crab.\n\n2. Tom Yum Goong (spicy and sour prawns and mushroom soup with a touch of lemon grass and roasted chili) - The prawns were jumbo. Good flavor, good soup.\n\n3. Gang Ped Ped Yang (roast duck curry cooked in coconu milk and red chili sauce w/ a combo of pineapple and spinach) - This was also pretty good, but I like Osha's duck curry better. Personally, the pineapples were a bit too much and took away from the flavor of the curry and duck.\n\n4. Red Curry Snapper with greens - our favorite dish of the evening. The fish was cooked perfectly and the greens were nicely flavored with the red chili sauce, not much curry, which was pleasant.\n\nService was good. They refilled our water glasses promptly and there was not a long wait period between dishes. Add one beer and the total was $47 dinner for two. Not bad.\n\nI will return because I am sure there are other mind-blowing dishes somewhere within here. I just didn't hit the jackpot this time around.", "author": "Betty N."}

It doesn't have the authentic Thai feel, but it is indeed very welcoming. Me and my friend started off with the Tom Yum and I have to say it was spectacular. It definitely had an authentic Thai taste to it, not too sour or spicy. We had two noodle dishes. One was 62, a glass noodle dish with chicken, tofu, shrimp, cabbage, and various other ingredients. That dish was very flavorful and well prepared, the combination of the ingredients were perfect. The second dish which was 61, a crispy noodle dish was absolutely horrid. It was a crispy noodle dish with a sweet-salty sauce, tofu and shrimp. The noodles were flaky, I felt like I was literally eating cereal given the oddly sweet sauce overpowering the lightly salted ingredients. It was so dry and overly sweet I couldn't down it, asked for dessert promptly.\nI was disappointed that I wasnt able to try the Siam Gems dessert, since they no longer had that. We got the dessert of the day which was mango w/ sticky rice in a sweet coconut sauce. This has to be the best place where I'v had this dessert. The mangoes tasted rather fresh and the sticky rice had the perfect thick consistency.\nOverall, I did like the place, the crispy noodle dish definitely threw me off and badly finished the meal, but all the other dishes were worth trying.\nThe area is rather inconvenient and slightly unsafe at night.", "author": "Veronica L."}

The interior is enjoyable, clean and decorated with a more sophisticated taste than the exterior lets on.\n\nPrices are very moderate, with lunch specials in the $8-9 range.  I ordered the green curry with chicken.  My food was delivered quickly and they attentively refilled my water.\n\nThe food however, was not memorable.  My green curry was subtly flavored and nearly bland.  It really only served the purpose of adding much needed moisture to the bits of chicken in the bowl.   Although the appearance of the curry seemed right and the green color was vibrant, the consistency was very watery, a little greasy and it tasted as though the curry sauce was not left to simmer long enough for the flavors to really marry.  When I spooned it over my rice, it disappeared and got lost - making an already bland curry virtually undetectable.\n\nDigging into the curry veggies, I stumbled upon a piece of something green, which looked like another green bean.  I was taken back in the midst of my conversation, by a sudden spiciness that caused me to stop and compose myself for a second or two.  I think I played it off pretty well and my companion didn't notice that my mouth had been ambushed... by a formidable chile pepper.\n\nBear in mind that I love really spicy food.  However, I was not prepared for this sudden spike of heat, in an all too bland curry sauce that registered a 0 on the heat scale, until I unearthed the hidden chile.\n\nI can vouch for the service, affordability and the atmosphere, but my green curry was a step below average.  Where was the slightly herbaceous flavor of Thai basil, where was the subtle consistency that distinguishes a curry from a soup, and finally where were the complex layers of protein, fresh veggies and curry (the sweet, savory, spicy, salty) that typically make my taste buds dance?\n\nI'd give this place another chance, but on this visit alone, I wouldn't give it high marks.", "author": "Catherine W."}

I was craving thai food and this hit the spot! \n\nI ordered a plate of pad thai and the duck rice plate for lunch as we shared throughout our meal. The duck rice plate is quite reminiscent of the duck dish I always get from Sanamluang Cafe in Hollywood. The skin is crispy and roasted and is sliced thinly over a bed of spinach and drizzled with soy. It was the perfect lunch. The pad thai tasted grand with the mix of shrimp and tofu, bean sprouts and peanuts. \n\nI'm coming back here again!", "author": "Mika D."}

The basil chicken was also fragrant and yummy.\n\n2. I had the pad thai, which was OK. They didn't pan sear the tofu, they sort of mixed it all in at the last second, and they made it so spicy I well, you don't need to hear that.\n\n3.

It was the service  that spoiled it.  \n\nI was quite impressed with how fast our drinks and appetizers came.  I am pregnant and was ravenous, so I was really happy about the speedy arrival.

That was kind of the first sign that things were going wrong.  \n\nMy hubby had asked me to bring him some food home and I was told to put in the order towards the end of our meal.  Unfortunately for us, sometime around our second course a huge party of 15-20 sat down right next to us.  I kind of wonder if they were trying to get us fed and get us out before that party arrived, because they were so fast to begin with!\n\nAs we were eating our main course, our water glasses were empty for a really long time before we got any water.  It was almost impossible to get our waiters attention.  I actually felt bad for him, he looked so frazzled and was running all over the place.  We were also stuck in a corner, which meant we didn't get noticed.  \n\nAfter we ordered our to-go food, we must have waited for at least a half hour before we had to ask for it again, which then took another 15 minutes to produce.  Plus, they didn't have the dessert which was on the menu  :(  I was definitely disappointed.

Growing in a house where I get the real thing, you ask why I would pay for such food you ask?  Well, Mom was about 6 hrs away at the time.  But EVERY Thai place I have ever visited, nothing compares to Mom's cooking @ home.  Even my parent's Thai restaurant in Naples, FL doesn't taste the same as if we were eating at home.  That being said, I'll do my best not to be bias & compare it to my Mom's cooking.\n\nSo back to Manora's.  Small place, but very cozy.  Nice decoration, and very attentive wait staff, always a plus.  Our h2o glass were never empty.  My Thai Ice Tea was too sweet for my taste, but the hubby enjoyed his hot tea.\n\nWe started off w/ Por-Pia-Sod (spring rolls filled w/ veggie, pork, chicken, shrimp & it was suppose to have crab, but I didn't taste/see it, top w/ a sweet tamarind sauce).  It was different but good.  Had to use a knife & fork to eat this because it was laid out on a dish w/ the sauce covering it.  I would have prefer the sauce to be on the side so I can dip like how I'm use to eating spring rolls.\n\nI had their Gang-Gari-Gai (yellow chicken curry).  Chicken was very tender & glad they had more chicken & not cheat us w/ putting more potatoes than chicken.  The hubby had the Panaeng-Sam-Ros (combo of crisp chicken, pork & beef deep fried drench in spicy red curry sauce.  Tasted the chicken & it was pretty good, but I didn't taste the other two meats.  From the hubby's empty dish after, I take it that it was good as well.  Hubby can not handle spicy & he was able to eat it, so their spicy probably is suited for the \"white\" tongue.  Which is perfect for him.\n\nAll in all, good food & reasonable price.", "author": "F. C."}

Half the table did not receive the rice they ordered (and after we ordered rice, the server said to us \"you know that costs extra, right?\" as if we could not read the menu on our own - I think charging for rice is terribly cheap, but if your guests have noticed it has to be ordered separately, at least don't condescend to them about it.)\n\nWe asked the table of 4 next to us if their service was similarly inconsistent, and they reported that indeed it was - everything came out at different times, one person waited ages for her food while everyone else was nearly finished, etc.\n\nWe discerned this while waiting endlessly for the check.\n\nI really want more of that duck and greens, but I think I'll see if they offer carryout.", "author": "Sheila A."}

I've gotten everyone else at work hooked on it.

Like someone up and dropped an entire chunk of Southeast Asia into my mouth. But in a good way!\n\nMuch of my visits here are a blur of blissful devouring, but I distinctly remember loving the chicken satay so much that I may have asked its hand in marriage. Given that cooked chicken lacks cognizant functions such as speech, I left with that dream unfulfilled. I highly recommend you try it - the consumption of Manora's chicken satay, that is, not the misguided attempt at matrimony.", "author": "Erik P."}

If they can make a good Thai Iced Tea, basically setting the tone of my meal, chances are I'll enjoy the experience whether the food or service is phenomenal or not. At Manora's, not only was the Thai Iced Tea spot on, the food was delicious and the service was great. We wandered in rather early for dinnertime, so I suppose the attentive service would have been expected.\n\nWe started out with the Tom Yum Goong [spicy and sour prawns and mushroom soup with a touch of lemon grass in roasted chili aroma]. My oh my, this soup is SPICY! Next time I'll have to ask for one step down in the spice. My sinuses, which have been bothering me for over a week, cleared up instantaneously. The prawns were perfect, probably thrown into the soup at the very last second so that they wouldn't be smooshy. \n\nTo share, we ordered the Gai-Kraprao [saut\u00e9ed minced chicken in sweet basil and fresh chili garlic sauce] and the Nur-Toon [a combination of beef cubes and spices cooked in mushroom and garlic sauce served in a clay pot]. One dish was a little on the saltier side, perfect for eating with a generous helping of Jasmine rice, which is ~$1 per person. The clay pot was nicely flavored. All portions were generous, and we had to take some food to go.\n\nConsidering the portions [good and plenty], the price [entrees average around $8 to $10], and the service [very attentive early on], I'd eat here again. You know, especially if I happen to be in the neighborhood, shopping at Costco or perhaps for a MINI/BMW, or spending the evening at Butter or Wish nearby.", "author": "Tinna H."}

The beef with basil was a bit overcooked, but the yellow curry chicken was good with rice (although the chicken pieces were cut quite large).  I do like their mango sticky rice as dessert - I love mango and I love sticky rice and a lot of places don't do it that well.\n\nThis place is also great for take out.

My review is limited to lunch service only as I have not been here for supper.  Depending on my mood, the two-item lunch combo is always my go-to meal.  There are about ten options to choose from.  It is served with the best/tastiest bowl of lemon chicken soup (Gai Tom Ka), which includes sizable chunks of chicken.  The restaurant tailors to vegetarians as well.  The portions are more than satisfying.  My favorites are yellow curry chicken, garlic pork, and spicy beef.  Aside from the combo plates, I recommend the Pad Thai noodle also.  I think the best deal is still the lunch combo at $8.95 including soup and fried rice.  I always come before noon to avoid the crowd.

Even having been there for years, it often feels like they want you in and out rapidly! The prawns and egg rolls are very very greasy, but there are at least 10 other excellent choices for the combo plate that will thrill you!\n\nThe first time Manora's was recommended to me, I wondered why the hell I wanted to cross town at lunch time for Jewish food. After a brief moment of complete embarrassment, and much laughter by my pals, the distinction was pointed out and off we went.\n\nI think that Manora's is the absolute best lunch place in San Francisco. It started me on my quest for and discovery of Thai food. \n\nThey have a fantastic lunch option where you can choose any 2 of about 12 items for your lunch which also include  Thai Rice (absolutely the best Spanish rice I have ever tasted including a good sized hunk of chicken hidden in the middle)! The meal starts off with the best Tom Kha Gai soup I have ever had. This is basically a Thai chicken soup chock full of chicken, straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots, lemon grass, cilantro, chili oil, chicken broth and coconut milk. It is the most wonderful balance of sweet, savory and spicy I have ever had! \n\nNext your meal is served with your two choices, (I recommend the red beef curry, served in a small bowl on the plate, just hot enough that you have to eat it with a spoonful of rice in order to keep the temperature manageable to me). It amazing how much food  is held in that bowl and I still have one more entree in another bowl on my plate!\nMy second choice sometimes changes but primarily I go for the peppery fried pork which I dip in a sweet and hot sauce served on the side. Their satay is fantastic and their chicken in really tiny bits with fresh basil is also one of my favorites. \n\nFriends have raved over the BBQ chicken, the Pad Thai, and everyone raves about the soup! What can I say. I have actually sent my husband on a trek for just soup to take out when I have been sick and needing some major comfort food. I have trained classes and used the Manora as a catering service and even their take out for 40 people held up fantastically!\n\nFor those who are not interested in the combo plate, there is a page of noodle, chicken and seafood dishes as I recall but why go for one entree when you can  taste a couple of items? \n\nLunch price was about 8.50 and Thai Ice Tea an extra 1.50 on top of that. I've never been able to fit dessert so I have no idea even what is offered. Since I always leave there stuffed I feel the value of the meal  is a heck of a bargain!\n\nI have been to many many Thai restaurants all over the state and up in Canada and still this is my favorite place where I celebrate all my birthdays and any anniversary of note!", "author": "TiMarie S."}

I have never eaten curry like this. The sauce is great mixture of coconut milk and spices. It's not runny, and not so spicy that you can't taste anything else. The chicken itself, in the curry, isn't the usual dried out over cooked breast meat. It's actually very tender and it's dark meat. I 've been to so many thai places in the city and there's not one place that makes it like this. \n\nThe service is great too. Very friendly, and attentive. Parking isn't bad if you get there before 7pm. The only thing is the noise level. It's a small place and it can get a bit loud but hey you're there for the food right?\n\nHere's a quirky thing but a nice touch- Everytime I've gone there they would always have a different kind of fresh flower on each table.", "author": "Bert T."}

Finally, on Sunday, after a long day of couch shopping in SOMA and a craving for Thai, we stopped in Manora.  It was 5:00 and we arrived just as they turned out their lights to start seating for dinner.  The restaurant was initially freezing, probably because they had just opened.  We immediately ordered tea and some hot appetizers to warm up.  They brought out our two appetizers within minutes and they were delicious.  We had the Pirate's Treasure which was a spicy mix of shrimp, chicken, and bean thread sheets and the Vegetarian Delight which was fried tofu and taro.  Both were excellent.  The taro was lightly fried and melted in your mouth.  When we finished our appetizers, the restaurant had warmed up and had almost completely filled up.\n\nFor dinner we ordered Pad Thai, MaKeur-Paad-Prik (Japanese eggplant with prawn, chicken, and pork in a spicy basil garlic sauce), and Goong Ping (charbroiled jumbo prawns served with a spicy lemon garlic sauce).   All three dishes were delicious.  I especially loved the eggplant dish.  The sauce wasn't too heavy and was just spicy enough to give it a kick.  The prawns in the Goong Ping were charbroiled on skewers and the skewers were stuck into an orange so that the shrimp were radiating out of it.  Nice preparation.  The pad thai was one of the better pad thais I've had in the city.  We all had leftovers which is always an added bonus.  I think that sometimes Thai food tastes better the next day after the spices and sauces have been soaked into the meat and veggies.  I look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu!", "author": "Zoe H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-08", "description": "Why I give this place 5 stars is because this is the best Thai place in San Francisco, and as everyone knows, San Francisco has more Thai restaurants per square foot than it has Starbucks.  Seriously.  To compare, once I was in Connecticut, and drove an hour and a half to get to a Thai restaurant.   It takes 3 hours to drive through the entire state.  The white people I was with had never had Thai.... but that's another story entirely...  \n\nThankfully, San Francisco is only 6 miles in radius, so Manora is really pain-less to get to, even for people in the Peninsula.  The location is near all sorts of freeways and parking is easy.  Rainbow grocery is right across the way.  Rainbow sells no meat, so Manora is a good stop off for non-vegetarians, especially during lunch!  Dinner would be better though, because unless you're a complete lush, the Mai-tai's aren't to be missed.  They're cheap as well.   \n\nThey make the BEST yellow curry chicken with potatoes and onions I've ever had.  I judge all Thai restaurants on this dish, and none live up to Manora's curry.  The chicken is stew like and the spices are cooked perfectly.  The chef special of eggplant, chicken, shrimp, pork and basil in an oyster type sauce is delish, even if you don't like eggplant.  The Pad Thai is perfect, (most places screw it up)  There's a string bean and beef dish...  You get the point.  \n\nHave dinner, followed by many many cocktails, and walk down the street towards downtown, and go into the little clubs littering both sides of the street... if you're into that sort of thing.  I myself prefer Mai-tai's, dinner, more Mai-tai's and the other direction towards the Mission/Potrero, but that's what's so great about Manora.  It really is the center of whatever direction you please.", "author": "L. K."}

The red and white curtains juxtaposed with traditional Thai decor are odd, not off-putting.\n\nThe Good:\nThe appetizers are generally good, and they are big enough to share between a couple of people if you order several. \n\nTheir curries are reliable. Only once in four years have they made a mistake and given us red curry when we ordered green. I prefer the green because I love the eggplant in it. Manora's uses whole, boneless chicken thighs in their yellow curry, which distinguishes them from other places. The dark meat is far more tender than the smaller pieces of white meat that most Thai restaurants use.\n\nThe whole fish, if you enjoy such fare, is flavorful and succulent. The beef shish-kebab is, while non-traditional, quite tasty. The quality of the meat sometimes varies.\n\nThe Bad:\nI've had better soups and have ceased to order them at Manora's. Don't get the sirloin with peanut sauce (Pra-Ram-Long-Song). The sauce was too peanut-y and the steak was tough.\n\nManora's is especially good, my family avers, when they are busy.

So, I knew I was in a great neighborhood restaurant cos the warmth was immediate. The smell of the dishes was fresh and unmistakably Asian -- flavorful burst of crushed and blistered lemongrass, chopped cilantro, basil leaves, familiar curry paste and sweet sour plum sauce rule the air. This place ranks very high in my book (the kind of dishes I feature on my food blog  ( http://queergam.blogspot.com ). Manora's is as good as it gets for me. People always find ways to fault dishes esp the so-called Asian food experts. This popular restaurant, located on the corner of Folsom St and 12th St in San Francisco, is as good as it gets.  I've eaten Thai at so many places in NY and CA, but one bite of their beef curry and the green salad with hard boiled eggs and drizzled with sweet plum sauce and crushed peanuts, swept me away! Their Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce is, well, quite decent:) (I cook it at home, I have high standards since this is one of Singapore's and Malaysia's signature/national dishes). Definitely come back over and over again with local and visiting friends. The price is good, the service is always better than ok and the boys are hot usually:) The reason I didn't give this a 5-star because of its location (I am not a fan of this area in SF) and the parking here is bad esp on weekends.

I'm not used to having peas in my Thai food, and the shrimp were a bit rubbery.  The crunch of the little shell and the flavor of the filling were good though.\nThe Sahai-Pad-King was my favorite dish - Thai sweet n sour.  The shrimp were delish, the veggies yum and not over cooked (who knew I'd like warm cucumber?), and the pork had the best ginger flavor.  And because I was feeling wild and crazy, I got the Gai-Yang.  That's right non-Thai speakers.  I had bbq chicken.  But I was really curious as to how it might be different than bbq chicken anywhere else.  In case you're now curious as well, it's not really.  But it was cooked perfectly - tender, juicy and falling off the bone.  Next time I think I'll ask for Sriracha as nothing we ordered had any heat to it and I was kind of in the mood for heat.

We happened to be in the neighborhood and were starving around 9:30pm. Manora's was open, so Manora's it was! I loved the decor and the authenticity as soon as we walked in.\n\nWe started with some hot tea, which was amazing! It was a red thai tea blend and smelled and tasted fabulous. We had the Yum Hed appetizer (combination of various types of mushrooms, prawn, and chicken in Thai spices, laid on a bed of greens), which was very good. It actually started sweet then went to spicy as we kept eating. Great flavor combination. We then shared 2 of the \"Chef's favorites\" dishes: the Pooket Skewer and the MaKeur-Paad-Prik. Now, I don't really like things too spicy, and I've never seen a server seem so disappointed and personally offended by me asking for something mild. I was a little perturbed by that, but the taste of the dishes easily made up for it. The skewers--with charbroiled scallop, prawn, fish, and vegetables with yummy dips--was amazing. And the Japanese eggplant in the other dish was perfectly done. My only real complaint is that they do not have brown rice, so we went with the jasmine rice, which was also really good. \n\nOf course, you can't have Thai food without having some mango with sticky rice, so indeed we ordered that as well. \n\nThe presentation, taste, service, and ambiance all surpassed my expectations for a corner place that was going to ease my late-night starvation.

I've never been disappointed w/ a single item there.  Great pad thai, curry duck is awesome, I had an eggplant dish that was fantastic (can't remember the name of it now).

The service seems to be the star...you feel very well attended to on every level, but the food! Wow!  I'm not easily impressed by thai food places, but this one made me take notice.  unique dishes and carefully prepared recipes abound.  Try the treasure chest appetizer and the pong pang seafood hotpot...oh man, delish!  If they offered brown rice, it would be perfection.  Oh, they may not ask you \"how spicy\" you want your dish and the chef will prepare it his way.  I would say the spice runs a little on the hot side for people not into heat.  I'm sure they'll gladly tone it down for you.  That said, just go here.  You won't regret it.", "author": "top b."}

But I don't think I could have felt more invisible.  I went by myself, which straight away marks me as someone they aren't going to get very much money from.  BUT STILL.  I was feeling sad about eating lunch by myself anyway, and then I got totally ignored by the staff.  My water was set down without a word, menu, and then my food was put down - still nothing said to me.  Then throughout my entire meal not a single person came up to ask me how it was, or give me more water (which was totally empty).  So I was a little dissapointed.  \n\nThe food was good though!

I'm glad she did because I shared it with many friends and coworkers and everyone was impressed, even my boss!  The lunch menu allows you to order two items which has a variety of chicken, meats, and vegetables.  With that you get a soup and your choice of rice.  Their fried rice has vegetables which isn't bad.  It's a lot of food.  You can sit down but it gets noisy.  Or you can take out.  They are pretty fast when you order for pick up.  Let me just say the chicken soup is some of the best.  It has lime, cilantro, mushrooms and sometimes on a cold day, that is all I need!  The curry bbq chicken is some of the best and the Gai Gro Pow is awesome.  You can get it mild, medium or hot.  However you like the spicyness, they accomodate.   You are allowed to order ala carte and they are open for dinner but the $ on the menu increases.  The staff is very friendly.  Service - if you sit down is great and if your in a rush to get back to work, they get you outta there.  They also need to seat the many people waiting.  So yea it gets busy.  Keep in mind parking can sometimes be sketchy.  Someone once told me a secret about asian restaurants: \"If it is busy and crowded, that means the food is good.  But if you see an empty restaurant, then that means the food isn't that great\".  I live by those words.  Keep in mind, San Francisco has some of the best asian cuisine in the country.   I had my chance to try some in New York but didn't get to, maybe next time.  From what I here, its not the same as SF's!  Sorry NYC!", "author": "Chris S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-10", "description": "Went here based on a recommendation and was disappointed with their lack of vegetarian options. When I asked our server for any suggestions, or what dish can be made vegetarian, his reply was vague and unapologetic. It was as if my question was making him work above and beyond his regular duties. Perhaps he was having an off night, but he was not very helpful. I ordered the glass noodle dish, which was lacking in spice but not so much in flavor. It was pretty good. My partner ordered a beef dish covered in peanut sauce, which looked like it had been regurgitated (sorry, but it did). He said it too was lacking in spice. Maybe they assumed we were weaklings to spice, but I'm used to Thai restaurants asking me what spice level I like my dish at, and our server failed to inquire. Anyhow, it wasn't the worse Thai food I've ever had, and I'm sure some of their other dishes are much better, but  for first impressions it was just OK. I'm sure there are plenty of other great Thai places to choose from in SF in the meantime.", "author": "Victoria G."}
