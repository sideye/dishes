This area lends itself very well to groups of 20ish people. Upon entering the room, I was immediately greeted by friendly staff asking me what I'd like to drink. I asked what they were offering and got the reply \"we can make you anything you'd like\". I was tempted, but felt like wine so went with a Cabernet Sauvignon, which was brought swiftly. I took a sip and was thoroughly impressed, this was a great wine. \n\nAfter networking, we were all seated at a large table. We each received a menu, which was completely tailored to the event (custom made with logo) and offered a list of appetizers and entrees. We learned we would receive all appetizers to share (hooray, an opportunity to taste everything!) and could pick one entree.\n\nThe appetizers did not disappoint. My personal favorite was the stuffed pepper with goat cheese (I'm sure there is a nicer description for it on the menu, but that's what it comes down to). Very satisfying. For an entree, I had the opportunity to pick between 2 meat options, 2 fish/seafood options and 1 vegetarian dish. They lose one star because the vegetarian dish did look pretty sad among their steak and seafood counterparts. I feel like they can up their game here, but granted I did not taste it. \n\nI went for the New York steak and it was delicious. I am not a big steak eater, but figured now was the time as I was confident this restaurant would nail it, and they did. Solid dish. This was a class act, even more so because they managed to get everyone's entree out at the same time while respecting everyone's cooking time preference (mine was spot on medium well). \n\nAnd then...they brought out a whole arrangement of tiny desserts. Oh my heavens. I was so stuffed that I only tried one and a half but they were superb. \n\nTop-notch experience.", "author": "Ellen H."}

It was not fried, see my picture so that you realize you're not getting a large portion, but the portion you do receive is extraordinary. The sauce is also excellent for dipping with the complementary bread.  5/5\n\nTuna Steak Sandwich, Onion Marmalade, Arugula\n$16. This was also excellent although not a large portion the quality was superb. I wanted a light lunch so this was exactly the right size and it came with a very small mixed green salad on the side with a light dressing.   It comes seared and the quality of tuna is really the star of the show although the marmalade and sourdough bread are also contributors to the overall deliciousness.  5/5\n\nThe location is very convenient right alongside the bay and the restaurant itself is actually pretty spacious and has very attractive lighting although the decor is not as Basque as I would have hoped on the interior. There is also an outdoor seating area that also would be nice on a warmer afternoon.  Complementary crusty sourdough bread is served at the table with a very nice olive oil and I also requested balsamic vinegar for dipping.", "author": "Ariana N."}

I had the toy box tomato tartlet, new york steak and the potato-manchego gratin side, and my friend had the butter lettuce salad and seafood stew. We were bowled over by the outstanding quality of everything. I'd asked for the steak to be done just under medium, and it was perfect; my friend's sea scallops and prawns were sweet and delicious with no metallic unpleasantness. \n\nOur server wasn't familiar with the Vesper cocktail that I asked if the bartender could make, but she queried me about the ingredients and ensured I had an wonderful rendition of that drink in front of me in just a few minutes. I really appreciated that. And she recommended a glass of the Miura 1842 Tempranillo when I asked for her opinion on a pairing for my steak -- what a great find!\n\nI hadn't been to Piperade in a few years, and I'm so glad to see they haven't lost a step since.", "author": "Teresa D."}

Although nothing was bad, nothing really WOW-ed me. \n\nDinner was perfectly average. I personally had the Piperade to start (a sort of veggie stew with bacon and a poached egg). This had really nice flavors, but there was no attention to detail here. All the veggies were cut in very different shapes and sizes, so it wasn't consistent. The egg, however, was cooked to perfection and the bacon was really good.\n\nOther appetizer favorites included the Piquillo pepper with goat cheese (they loved this), Foie Grois, the Bacon Wrapped Dates were amazing, and the mushroom tart was well-liked.\n\nThe entrees were decent. I personally was not a huge fan of the New York Strip. I ordered it medium rare, it looked medium rare, and yet it tasted tough. It honestly tasted like steak I attempt to make for myself at home. It really needed a sauce!!! I was craving some extra flavor. The sides were good, but the steak was flavorless and tough. Not great!\n\nEveryone else really liked their entrees. The Duck Confit was excellent. Crispy, good lentils, nice addition of carrots. Others got the special fish, the Cod, the Sea Bass, and the Pork Cheeks (nice dish, but nothing special). We felt that the Sea Bass was completely ruined by the addition of spinach. It took away from the vinegar flavor. It was a tasty fish, but the spinach made the flavor watery.\n\nDessert was okay. We ordered the Orange Blossom Beignets- these are NOT Beignets! They were pretty flavorless, non-stuffed profiteroles. I was almost insulted that they called these Beignets.... No. Apple tart was enjoyed.\n\nService was also nothing to rave about. It took ages to find someone for more water. They were not around very much.\n\nDefinitely an average meal at what was supposed to be an above par restaurant. Would not return at these prices.", "author": "Hannah S."}

Given it's so close to Embarcadero, if you don't mind the wind it's also great to walk by the bay afterwards.\n\nI have to start with the bread. My god, consuming carbs never felt this right and wrong at the same time. A bit of olive oil, balsamic and seasoning the only thing you have to worry about is leaving enough room for the actual dishes. \n\nWe have ordered two appetizers. The calamari and Piperade. I have to be honest, Piperade wasn't really $18 worthy but it was still a nice dish. Calamari though, was incredible! The citrusy flavor and the fact that it wasn't fried made everything much more flavorsome!\n\nFor the main dish we have ordered the seafood stew and the fact that they've separated the dish onto two plates because we were sharing made me realize how much this restaurant cared about their customers. The flavor? Again, just fantastic.\n\nMeanwhile we were ordering our wine and usually I hope the wine is average but god no, it was also quite good! Hats off to you guys!\n\nAt the end, after having so many wonderful dishes and having a great time we wanted indulge ourselves with dessert. Decided on the Hazelnut dish, we told them we would share and again they've amazed us by cutting the dessert right in the middle and serving on two plates. Dessert? Yup, it was fascinating.\n\nSo please, please give this place a try. They will live up to all the expectations you have.", "author": "Ali O."}

So when I can get to a restaurant that helps bring me back, to that magical experience, even if it's only through food, wine and a waiter with a slight accent, it's a wonderful gift. \n\nPiperade is small. The menu isn't too extensive, but it's alluring enough to go back for more. There is something for everyone, the pescadarian, the vegetarian, the vegan and the full fledged carnivore. They will even modify happily to cater to the dairy or gluten free person as well. \n\nWe had the Dungeness Crab Cake Special, Gem Lettuce Salad, Warm Olives for starters. The Crab special was light with tangy fruit and greens mixed to make a pleasureful mouthful in each bite. \n\nI went for another appetizer The Calamari with lemon and garlic as my main course while my dates opted for the special and the Sea Bass. Our table hardly spoke a word, while we dug into our entrees. \n\nDon't skip the traditional basque cake, with a side of Tawny Port.

I really enjoyed the calamari it was cooked really well and had nice flavor but wasn't overpowering. I was disappointed in the sea bass, it was overcooked. I know fish can get overcooked easily but at least it was only slightly overcooked so it wasn't dry it was just a bit chewy. Another person I was dining with had the braised pork cheeks and those were delicious, very tender!

My parents and I all tried this, and even split between 3 people, there was plenty of seafood to go around. There were scallops, salmon, some other types of fish, shrimp, and squid cooked together in a tasty sweet pepper-based sauce.\n\nBraised pork cheeks: the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender (though there wasn't actually a bone). I really enjoyed cutting off small pieces and dipping it into the gravy for some additional flavor.\n\nDessert\n*Dark chocolate cake: this ties with the mushroom tart for my most enjoyable dish at this restaurant. I don't like the bitterness of dark chocolate, but this cake was the right amount of sweetness, not too much and not too little! And the best part was that it's served warm (maybe straight from the oven?) so each bite you take is a soft warm piece of chocolate-y wonderfulness. My parents aren't huge fans of American desserts normally, but even they really enjoyed this cake.\n\nFrench apple tart: this was an okay dessert. It was already sweet enough without the caramel sauce, so the sauce felt like it was too much.\n\nOn top of the $80 I had already bought, I paid another $32 for tax and tip. Not bad for a nice enjoyable meal out with my parents!\n\nNote: the environment felt pretty formal. Most of the diners were pretty dressed up, though there were some more casually dressed patrons as well. Would be a nice spot for a date (in fact I saw multiple couples there), especially if the weather cooperates and you can sit outside in their patio area.", "author": "Dianna H."}

Butter was broken and cold. The food was a let-down, plain and simple.  The vegan food had tomato in every course, seems like they were running out of options - no creativity for a vegan guest of honor they knew about in advance. My one and only appetizer was a skewer of half a grape, half of a cherry tomato and small piece of beet.  I was starving for salad that came as a butter leaf lettuce with only dressing and my entree was bland rice with corn and the same cherry tomato from the appetizer.\n \nWe had to wait over 15 minutes after all but 3 guests had dinner for steaks to cook instead of putting them on sooner so the steaks finished off together.

The food is both French and Spanish Basque, but seems to be more focused on the Spain side of Basque food. First the vibe: the restaurant and bar both have a warm and comfortable feel, but with a lot of energy coming from not only the customers, but the servers, as well. The cocktails are excellent and the wine list is phenomenal. The food is outstanding, and everything from the Pintxos to the Main Courses are delicious. Everything I've had during my four visits to this restaurant has been incredible, with a few memorable standouts: Calamari \"a la Plancha\", Almond Stuffed Medjool Dates, and Stuffed Piquillo Peppers. But, the star of any meal I've had at Piperade is the Braised Seafood  and Shellfish Stew-this is a top five meal I've had anywhere.

We started with cocktails from the cocktail menu and the fried Manchego cheese with pickled vegetables. The cocktails were incredible and the cheese was quite good too.\n\nNext, we had two appetizers -- the Basque salad and the grilled calamari. They split both for us without us even asking, which was nice. The calamari was some of the best I've had. Very tender and the sauce was so delicious that I had to sop it up with bread.\n\nWe ordered glasses of red wine, both of which were excellent, with our dinner. The lamb chops and the swordfish. The lamb was perfectly done and the swordfish also was very tasty. Everything was perfectly prepared and presented.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the dark chocolate cake (more or less a lava cake) and the lemon roll (which was not very lemony and a bit dense for sponge).

Both were delicious! The Mushroom Tarlet was perfectly flaky and had a wide array of different mushroom varieties. I LOVE MUSHROOMS. The Serrano Ham was also tasty and went well with the complimentary bread at our table. \n\nOur tiny two-person table got a little crowded with two appetizers, bread, and our glasses of wine... but we managed. For our main courses, we shared the New York Steak and Duck Confit. Personally I liked the steak. The fact that it had black pepper sauce immediately caught my eye. It was served with a side of super buttery garlic broccoli rabe. YUM!! Would come back here specifically for this dish again. The Duck Confit was delicious as well. Was not quite in the mood for something so greasy but it's a good dish. Both portions were huge and very filling.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal with a few glasses of Syrah before heading out to the musical.

The decoration inside is very classic and European-style, which I would see as a nice break from hipster and trendy places I frequent mostly. Most customers were dressing up and with their colleagues/partners from business. But I didn't feel very uncomfortable in my casual normcore-style clothes. \n\nWe shared 5 appetizers and 2 desserts, which was a lot for 2 girls. 3 dishes stand out the most - stuffed pepper with goat cheese, pistachios, and raisins, grilled calamari, and mushroom tartlet. \nStuffed pepper looks really fluffy and adorable - pink-red pepper skin is paired with cream-white filling, which looks more like a dessert than an appetizer. And the taste lives up to the look! The goat cheese filled my mouth with crunchy pistachio pieces and sweet raisins. Simple yet sophisticated taste and texture. Love it!\n\nGrilled calamari is very fresh and with great texture - not too dry and over-cooked, and not too raw and chewy. The sauce itself has a nice sour taste, and could be easily sopped up with bread.\n\nWe also tried Orange Blossom Beignets. While I think it does smell like blossom and spring, the taste is not as vibrant. And would be nice if it's softer and more fluffy. \n\nOverall, if you want an adventure for Spanish food in the city, this one should be on your list!", "author": "Yuhuan T."}

I have the sense that they often do better than they did last night, but last night was \"off\" in a few important ways.\n\nI arrived quite early, at 6:45pm for a 7:15pm reservation; and as such, had absolutely no expectation that I would be seated early. My expectation was to have a cocktail at the bar and await my friend's arrival. However, since I was there anyway, I figured I'd announce myself to the Ma\u00eetre d so they would know I was present. So I did, then I went to take a seat at the bar, however there weren't any seats. So I walked outside and took a seat on the stairs of the chiropractor's office nextdoor and waited a bit. Understandable, so far everything was as one would expect.\n\nMy friend arrived and we announced ourselves at 7:10pm for our 7:15pm reservation. We were told that our table wasn't ready yet, but that there were two seats at the bar, and we were welcome to sit there until they were ready for us. So we walked through the crowded restaurant to the two seats at the back of the bar, to be informed by someone that they were \"saved\" for his two friends who were in the restroom. So we cancelled our order with the bartender and walked BACK to the front of the restaurant to wait again.\n\nAt 7:30pm we were told our table (7:15 reservation) was almost ready. And again at 7:45pm. At 7:50pm we were offered complimentary cocktails since we had to wait so long. At 8:00pm we were finally seated. In the meantime, I had to call and cancel an appointment I had made for after dinner; there was no way I could make it on time. That appointment had to be rescheduled for next Friday, as they had no other openings beforehand... so now my schedule for the week is skewed and my weekend plans have to be adjusted. Really annoying.\n\nThe food was fairly hit-or-miss. Credit where credit is due; the stuffed piquillo pepper was flavorful and delicious. Though the menu said peppers and it was, in reality, one small pepper (for $14). It was fantastic and totally worth getting, even at that price, but a bit misleading and I was already cranky at this point.\nWe ordered the pommes frites as well, and they were amongst the best shoestring french fries I've ever had. The Calamari Txipiroa, however, which was their special of the night, was really not a dish I enjoyed at all. I don't know what \"ink sauce\" is supposed to taste like, and perhaps the dish was prepared flawlessly and I simply have a peasant's palate, but to me the entire dish tasted like smoke and rice. I actually left it mostly unfinished on my plate. The orange blossom beignets somewhat made up for this, as they were perfection.\n\nIn summary, a delightful aesthetic, poor organization and time management, cursory efforts to compensate us for a fairly ridiculous wait, some really good dishes, some really unpleasant dishes, and pricey.\n\nI probably wouldn't return; in a city with so many high-end restaurants, I suspect that there's just better out there.", "author": "Sean B."}

It wasn't what I was expecting, which was traditional tapas/paella/sangria, etc., but it was still delicious. For four of us, we got stuffed peppers, warm sheep's milk cheese & ham terrine, grilled calamari, oxtail, potatoes gratin, and two orders of the braised pork cheeks. The only thing that was disappointing was the terrine; the taste and texture was just like cold cheese and ham squished together. We snagged the last gratin of the night, but I wish we could have ordered one each. The oxtail was also a tad dry but delicious none the less. The braised pork cheeks exceeded expectations--it came with a temperanillo sauce which had me like YAAAAS. \n\nThey also have an extensive selection of wine.

My friend and I were at the Exploratorium, but realized that the lecture we wanted to attend wasn't until 9pm.  Since we were 3 hours early, we decided to find a place nearby to eat.\n\nI really like the decor of this restaurant, especially on the outside.  It's intimate with low lighting.  Basque food is the specialty, and we ordered fried manchego cheese, sauteed green beans, a tomato tart, and chicken with corn and chorizo.  The fried cheese was good, but it was lacking acidity for me.. It had to be eaten with the pickled vegetables for a more robust flavor.  The green beans were okay too.  They had to be eaten with the marinated pluots to compliment the dressing.\n\nThe stars of the meal were the tomato tart and the chicken.  The tart had simple ingredients: cherry tomatoes, a flaky crust, basil, garlic, balsamic, and thyme.  And together was an explosion of flavor!  I wish it was bigger because I could've eaten more.  My friend ordered the chicken, and she devoured it.  I got to try the corn and the chorizo, which were fantastic.\n\nWe weren't thinking of ordering dessert, but we got the menu, so we decided to treat ourselves.  The orange blossom beignets caught our attention, so we ordered one to share.  They were okay.  I'm assume it's not a traditional beignet, but I wish it had more of sweetness to it.  And it was a little dry to me, but if it was drenched with sauce, it would've been more of a Greek dessert.\n\nThere were some hits and misses, but overall it was a good meal with friendly service, and I would definitely come back again for the tomato tart.", "author": "Vira P."}

Their delectable and deliciously good looking, small dishes!\n\nStarting out with their Dungeness Crab, presentation was splendid and the grapefruit pieces, added a nice tangy complimentary taste.  Next up, their Sheep's Milk Cheese mixed in with Ham Terrine and Aged Sherry, was phenomenal!  I am already a sucker when it comes to aged cheese!  Add the gamey taste to the cheese and salted ham with the whole sha-bang, we have a winner on this tapa dish!

Their Braised Seafood in Shellfish Stew was rich on the variety from the sea, but the salmon was plain dry.  Too overcooked. Their House Special of the Day, mango slices topped on a medium rare thick pork chop, was not to my liking.  I have to commend on their Rack of Lamb, however.

My memories were that of a dark cozy restaurant buzzing with people and plates of comfort food. A wonderful experience.\n\nIt was with some trepidation that I returned: I mean you read the Yelp reviews that give one or two stars  and the complaints of indifferent service and long waits.\n\nWell my friends those reviews, Imho, are greatly exaggerated and unfounded from my experience.\n\nPiperade still has that certain charm and warmth that is exemplified in the Basque culture. First of all when we arrived there was Chef Hirigoyen, outside, enjoying a glass of wine after a long afternoon of work. He is a very approachable guy and it was fun to chat with him.\n\nThe service was really nice. My friend asked, after we had been seated for a while, if we could move and they did it quickly without any hassle. The waiters are warm and friendly but they arent in a hurry to get you in and out.....and I really appreciated this.\n\nThe food was really good. It is pretty pricey but the quality is pretty stellar. The crab appetizer was amazing. Nothing but chunks of light, fluffy, fresh crab. Lightly dressed with some blood oranges and vinaigrette. Seriously I could have eaten three of these.\n\nThe other appetizers were the mushroom tart which was a great flaky pastry with loads of very fresh and flavorful shrooms.\n\nThe salad was boring and I would skip.\n\nThe mains were the shinning star of this place. My duck was cooked to perfection. Light crunchy skin, succulent meat that was not dry at all. The seafood stew was also amazing: chalked full of mussles, calamari, and prawns....it was good. The steak was also very nice albeit boring. We oredered two sides and they were amazing. The gratan was lovely potatoes and cheese. The lentils were lovely.\n\nThe surprise of the meal were the desserts. They were lackluster and basically boring. The beignets  were cold and paled in comparison to spruce's. The apple tart was so so. The chocolate cake was another boring production.\n\nFinally the wine list is impressive and you can find good wines at pretty reasonable prices. We ordered a bottle of 2007 Clarendelle Bordeaux..... a really really nice wine at 40 dollars.\n\nFor a special occasion I think Piperade hits all the right notes.", "author": "David G."}

My girlfriend and I chose this place for our 2 year anniversary dinner. When we got to our reservation at 7, it was rather full and they tried to place us on a table so close to two other ones that it felt like we were at McDonalds. I had to negotiate with the host to be able to switch, and he was nice about it. Even so, I was paying attention to the other people they tried to place there and no one seemed happy about it, they should really space out their arrangement given the price of the food.\n\nThey were also using their side room for a private party where lots of noise was erupting, regularly. This was not terrible but once again a small annoyance that was unwelcome.\n\nAs for the good, I ordered the duck and lentilles and my girlfriend the mushroom tartelette appetizer. It wasn't bad but the duck and lentils was not worth 28$. The duck was overcooked and the lentils undercooked, and they both were served it too hot, which led to me burning my tongue.\n The mushroom tartelette was better, but my girlfriend also thought it probably wasn't worth its price.\n\nAll in all I wasn't impressed.

I wasn't really concerned about my main, I figured I'd game it and see what happens.  After walking in to a completely empty restaurant, my co-worker and I got settled in and ordered the mushroom tartlet, which they graciously split for the two of us! The tartlet, which appears on 7x7's Big Eat list, is definitely worthwhile.  The flaky tartlet crust with some seriously savory mushrooms is definitely a great starter.  It's not big either, so sharing it between two people was idea.  I had their special shrimp salad, which in all honesty, was not that special.  In fact, it was a borderline rip off.  I should have stuck with the tuna.  Alas, lesson learned I guess.  My co-worker had the tuna steak sandwich and absolutely loved the onion marmalade that came garnished with it. We then split the Gateau Basque and I appreciated the not-so sweet taste that came out from it.  It was also split for the two of us, but the slice was incredibly small.  The photos from Yelp seem to indicate that the actual slice is bigger, but given that I'm trying to be better about what I'm eating, I guess this was a way of them helping me with portion control.\n\nThe total bill came out to around $80 after gratuity, and I honestly was a little disappointed that I wasn't a) more full and b) more satisfied with my experience. That salad was easily the biggest disappointment, and while I loved the mushroom tartlet and the dessert, it wasn't enough to overtake my disappointment in my entree. Meh.", "author": "Lisa I."}

About five years ago I attended the Basque Festival in Elko, NV, and found out about Chef Gerald Hirigoyen by purchasing Pintxos and The Basque Kitchen, two incredible Basque cookbooks. A couple of my favorite recipes are from these books - so yes, I might be a little biased to have finally attended his restaurant.\n\nThe boyfriend felt bad rolling up in jeans, and I in leggings, but the hostess assured us that it would be fine - however, just keep in mind this place is a bit dressy. We just didn't want to pack anything fancy for a 36 hour SF trip - :\\\n\nThe service here is wonderful. The ambience is quaint, and beautiful. Soft, romantic lighting, cool decor, minimalist but still fancy. We were seated and immediately ordered a Picon Punch (Basque tradition, usually cheap red wine and coca cola, or is that just done in Elko? - because this one was WAY better), and a blood orange and vanilla cocktail for me. I'd order the Picon Punch again.\n\nWe had a sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine - split for us - and it was divine. I mean, literally divine. It was perfect. I wanted like, eight more. But alas, we had to eat the main courses, so I enjoyed it while I could, savoring each bite to the fullest. Grand.\n\nUsually I stay away from seafood unless it's sushi or Plouf (mussels). However, since the Basque are well known for their seafood dishes, Ryan suggested I try the stew - and it was amazing. Seriously, it was. The mussels were perfect, the scallops were so good, whatever fish was in there I savored, all in this magnificent stew sauce. I mean, I was amazed. And Ryan's steak - buttery, cooked perfectly - he was incredibly satiated.\n\nSave the best for last: dessert. We ordered two, the almond mousse and the orange blossom beignets, accompanied by a 20 year Tawny.\n\nIn August 2010, I had dinner at Ad Hoc with my cousins. Afterward we walked to a ridiculously fancy hotel in Yountville for drinks, and I passed by the most fragrant bushes - orange blossoms. I could have stood there for hours just breathing deeply, and to my companions, it felt like I did.\n\nThe orange blossom beignets ignited that peaceful memory of a perfect night. The beignets themselves, hallowed and crunchy, could not have possibly been made any better. Their orange blossom scent lifted through the back of the throat and back down the nose, in a fragrant cycle. I was almost afraid of tasting the mousse - how could anything live up to the beignets? Surprisingly, it did. The almond mousse was perfect. Everything was perfect. The whole thing.\n\nI want to come back here. Forever and ever.", "author": "Jaime L."}

(the deal said they add 18% tip and tax, and was worth about $140).  I LOVE that they included the champagne, and that there were TWO desserts and TWO apps- often these deals only include 1 to share, and I love my man, but I'll rock paper scissor him for the 3rd beignet every time, and if I lose, he often lets me have it any way. - what can I say? I'm a lucky gal.

This one was coming up and so I called on Friday for a reservation for the following Thursday the deal was set to expire on Sunday.  They said they had 9pm...not really my style.  Then they said they were \"extending the expire date\"  FANTASTIC, the following Thursday was great with me, 6:30 please.\n\nWe arrive into a beautiful space, and are seated against the wall with a nice view of the dining room (well I had a nice view of the dining room).

You had me at \"ham\".  \n\nin order to maximize the voucher's deal, we ordered the 2 most expensive entrees, the steak and the rack of lamb with sausage.  I cook a mean rack of lamb, and while this was cooked to a perfect med rare, I think I do a better job of seasoning on the grill, but the mergeuz sausage was awesome, and the figgy/fruit sauce was quite nice. The steak was actually better than the lamb, and I almost NEVER order steak in a restaurant, why bother, you can get it anywhere and cook it yourself if you are so inspired, but the steak was better than the lamb. Again cooked perfectly and the size of my foot - HUGE.  (we had leftovers enough for a steak egg taco for breakfast for my man and a petite lunch sammy for me.)\n\nI think we fumbled a bit on our dessert selection - the orange beignets were great, but we ordered the almond cake - which was good, but I could have used some chocolate and there were a few selections.\n\nLike I said we did not finish our steak, so I asked the nice waiter to package it up WITH the delish bread we had leftover - YUP, I'm exactly that cheap, but they were gonna just throw it away anyway right?\n\nI wanna go back, sit at the bar and get a big glass of red wine and that crispy ham terrine...drool", "author": "Amy W."}

We were seated in a smaller dining room off to the left of the host stand and for the first half of our meal we were alone. Separating our dining room with the other, more full dining room, is a wine cooler.\n\nI was here for a business meeting with five other people, so a variety of different food was tried and enjoyed. The very first thing we enjoyed was the bread. Even though the bread was cold, it still tasted good and instead of serving it with butter, bottles of olive oil are placed on the table. \n\nWe shared plates of the sea scallops, the four cheese plate, a crab cake, and bowls of tomato puree bisque. The scallops come with parsnip puree and a shaved apple salad. \n\nThe scallops were cooked beautifully, so I didn't have to pull a Gordan Ramsey and smash them against the table. The parsnip puree I couldn't taste much of but the shaved apple salad paired very well with the scallops. \n\nThe four cheese plate was minimal in quantity, but all four had amazing flavor. My favorites would have to be both the blue cheese, and the goat cheese that was served. The cheese is served with a Spanish fig cake that was very delicious and paired great with every piece of cheese on the plate. \n\nThe only \"cake\" like about the crab cake, was the shape. The circle of crab was very easy to pull apart with your fork for bite after bite of deliciousness. \n\nThree of us ordered the tomato bisque, which were then passed around so all could try. It tasted pretty good, but nothing too special. \n\nFor my entree I ordered the blue nose sea bass, which was served with saut\u00e9ed spinach and fried garlic vinaigrette. My first time having bass, and I must say I am now a fan: Very flaky, and with marvelous flavor. The bass was great but the spinach with the garlic vinaigrette was spectacular. I could have probably eaten plate after plate of just that. \n\nI was able to sample a bite of both the pork cheeks and the prunes they are served with. Both are excellent. The cheeks are tender, and the prunes are just delicious. \n\nAlso must have are the potato and manchego gratin. We had four orders of this, and all four orders were completly emply by the time we left. I would say this dish was probably the star of the night. \n\nFour of us ordered the same cocktail. The Elkano: Two of us hated it. The other two LOVED it. I fall into the \"Love\" column. Being that I love rum and being that this drink really packs the rum into it, plus adding all the fruity flavors to it, the drink was pretty damn good. \n\nThe service was pretty OK and average. Everyone who waited on us, seemed to be in such a hurry to the point where I for one felt a little rushed. No orders were served wrong and everyone was happy with their meals.\n\nPiperade is for lack of a better word, PHENOMENAL.", "author": "Jonathan R."}

One of my favorite dishes here is the Mediterranean bass, when is generally crispy on one size and moist on the other.  Almost always very well executed.\n\nClass European service here too.

Stew was okay, I have had better, the white fish was bone dry, mussels, small, but perfect.  I have never eaten three pieces of bread during a meal in my life, these two dishes needed the bread for sopping and to tone down the sodium.\n\nDesserts were a letdown.

The salad was full of flavors and we both enjoyed it, moving back and forth between that and the oxtail, which was really yummy.

It was like a risotto with small tomatoes, roasted corn, arugula, peppers, and more of the delicious Ossau-Iraty cheese.  Even though we could not finish all the rice, we ordered dessert (why not?!).  We had the apple tart and dark chocolate cake.

The sweetness of the peppers married well with the tartness of the cheese. It was simple and not over done. A must order!\n\nThe rack of lamb is arguably the best that I've ever experience. It was perfectly medium rare -- great flavor and tender as butter. It would use a bit more of that delicious sauce, but the meat was amazing on its own. I also adored the poached fennel. Compliments to the chef.\n\nThe steak was slightly overcooked, more like medium than medium rare. Nevertheless, the beef had great flavor and a nice crust from the sear. The polenta fries were crispy on the outside and cheesy/tender on the insider. The watercress salad was slight overdressed and probably the heaviest tasting item on the plate, but the acidity cut through some of the richness of the dressing. The sauce was nutty and complex. It certainly helped out with the slightly overcooked meat. Maybe we'll order it rare next time.\n\nThe apple tart was very thin with slivers of overlapping apple slices. There's a nice crust from the caramelized sugar. The star of the show is definitely the caramel sauce. I overheard another table order their apple tart with extra caramel -- they probably are repeat customers and know how great the sauce is.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the place.

This is one of the very best restaurants in the city, but hardly the most famous or expensive or anything else.\n\nNominally Basque, this is basically a serious but somewhat informal French restaurant owned and overseen by a very serious chef. Typical restaurant service. You come, you're seated, they ask for a drink order, wine bla bla, appetizers, main entree, desert, or you could ask them otherwise. \n\nService is a little weird at times, a cast of fairly experienced but personality-rich characters dealing with dinner service. \n\nThe food is at times transcendent. That is the highest praise of food. Not just good, or filling, or a good value, or whatever. Out of 7 dishes in my last visit, two of them took me to another planet where Yelp reviews, the existence of restaurants, or the American economy did not matter. You forget yourself, it was that good. It is like going to see a music event and you are in shock.\n\nSpecifically, one dish, an oxtail appetizer, was the gateway. Always on the menu, the lamb chop was also amazing. A seasonal simple chanterelle mushroom side dish was also a gatewy to a better place.\n\nThe weak point as it has always been is the dessert, kind of desultory, overly sweet, not fresh, and I wonder what they're thinking.

I'm happy to report that all is shipshape during the lunch hour, with the menu modified to include a few sandwich items and simpler dishes.  \n\nMy friend ordered a chicken sandwich with avocado, red peppers, and cheese, which was accompanied on the plate by a simple green salad.  He devoured it and said it was excellent.  \n\nI ordered the Bizkaiko, a fish and shellfish stew in a red pepper infused sauce.  From what I could tell, beneath the sauce were cod, tuna, salmon or char, shrimp, clams, and mussels.  The fish was cooked absolutely perfectly, poached to a buttery consistency, and was clearly fresh as could be.  While the sauce was very simple and almost bland, this was a wonderful dish, especially when accompanied by the restaurant's signature bread, a sourdough with wonderfully coarse texture.\n\nWe also split an order of frites, which I remembered from previous dinners as being amazing.  Either the memory was flawed or the product isn't always the same.  We got a generous portion of shoestring potatoes that we enjoyed eating and that weren't awful by any means, but they weren't \"special\" and they hardly justified a $10 price tag.\n\nEven without appetizers, drinks, or dessert, but with Cafe Americanos and SF Health Mandate surcharge, the bill came to more than what most people spend for lunches in a week, but it was a very enjoyable meal for us.  An added benefit was that the restaurant let us sit where we were for an extra couple of hours after lunch, which allowed two old chums to catch up on bygones and gossip.  \n\nAll told, I probably prefer Piperade for dinner, when the menu is larger, more complex, and worthy of elevated pricing.

There were a few large tables filled with business people that seemed to be pulling our waiter's attention. The waiter came and was so brisk with us, took one cocktail order and left. We all looked at each other confused. I got his attention and I said, \"Can everyone order their cocktails now?\" He took the orders but I tried to order some appetizers as well (since I guessed it would take him a while to come back), but he left again without asking if we would like anything else! It was horrible. He brought our cocktails at all different times, then we tried to order the appetizers, and we only ordered ONE and he ran away again!

Also tried the seafood medley which came with shrimp, scallops, also with several other kinds of fish.  It was served on a tomato base.  Delicious.   \n\nFinal course were 2 desserts.  They were good but i honestly don't recall what I had.  My only beef with them was that on checking out they already added a tip.

We started a few appetizers: Pacific Calamari, Toy Box Tomato Tartlet, Piperade, and Twice Cooked Oxtail. The appetizers were pretty good, i didn't try the calamari tho. The Tartlet was delicious and had a wonderful flaky crust to it. The piperade was amazing, especially with the bread that they served. The twice cooked oxtail was also flavorful and amazing. For my entree I ordered their lunch special which was the Lamb Shank over pasta. The Lamb was well cooked and tender but the dish as a whole could have used a little more flavor. From the looks of it, I thought sure thing the sauce mixed with the pasta would be quite flavorful but it was a little more on the blander side. At least the lamb was tender and didn't have that strong lamb taste (that I don't mind) but it was cooked well. Overall it was ok, i'd give it a 3.5.\n\nAnd of course at a place like this portions are smaller.\n\nOther than that, the dining environment is gorgeous. It's quite spacious and comfortable.

We sat near the rear against a wall. Our view was of the main dining room.\n\nPart of why we loved our last experience here is the setting but also the waitstaff.  Last time, our waiter was extraordinary, one of a kind, old school, incredibly patient, knew where the prepared food were from, had an air of reassurance, and knew when we needed something.  \n\nThat wasn't the case this time. We were underwhelmed and disappointed.  Although nice and efficient, our waitstaff struggled to tell us how the food was prepared, could  not tell us where it was from or describe its tastes and had to be flagged down numerous times for ordering, getting the check, etc.. This person also always seemed rushed, running from the kitchen to various tables, not checking in on us.  The restaurant was busy, but I can't remember seeing waiters running around at other fine dining places.  Also, when we asked for water, this person gave bottled water which she didn't mention the $8 charge.  Uncool.\n\nRestaurant owners and managers: your waitstaff needs BETTER TRAINING to describe the amazing food you cook and how to better anticipate the needs of diners, and disclose any costs. Your patrons are intelligent and savvy, and many of us want to know where your food is from and descriptions of their tastes so that we can make good meal decisions and come back again.  \n\nSo while the choices we made were delicious  (beet and argula salad, calamari a a la plancha, steak and mushrooms, halibut and tomato, corn puree, beignets and warm chocolate late), what was sorely missing was the calm, knowledgeable waitstaff.  I've had better service at take out restaurants and cafes.\n\nIn addition, Travel Zoo's mandatory 18% gratuity was not fair based on our lack of service.   Patrons should be able to control how much we pay for the service.  Giving the same tip to all servers is a dis-service to patrons who expect good fine dining service and to servers who don't know they need better training.\n\nAgain, disappointed.

The service was very slow and my favorite fish dish that has always been cooked to perfection for take out was bone dry.\n\nMy take is they have a great kitchen, but the front of the house seems to be easily overwhelmed at busy times.

My wife and I brought in our 3 y.o. daughter and although we were 15 minutes late, they seated us within 10 minutes.  This place isn't really kid friendly, since they have no high chairs, boosters or even a kid's menu.  They couldn't even do a special request of spaghetti but did offer pasta with butter.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is awesome as it is dark wood floors, ceiling and a cool ass wine chandelier in the center of the room.  We started off with the 2 glasses of champagne and some bread, and then had the calamari app and some crispy fries for the little one.  Next course for me was the rack of lamb which was delicious and a nice size portion.  The flavors of the food were really nice and not something I am accustomed to.  It really felt like I was transported to Spain in a tiny village along a rural street.\n\nThe waiter didn't seem to pleased that we had a toddler with us, but this could have just been the way he is with all guests.  They added a travelzoo tax of $12.60 which I think is 8.5% of $148.00 and a service gratuity of $29 which is 20% of what the total would be.  I wasn't about to get out my iphone and start calculating what these charges were.  I was just glad they didn't tell us they lost our rsvp when they saw us show up with a kid.

Fantastic food and strong cocktails in a sexy yet rustic ambiance with dim lighting, exposed red brick walls and wooden furnishings with crisp white linen clothed tables. They also have an outdoor dining area which is perfect for those rare warm city nights and a private room to accommodate larger parties (up to 30). Piperade is nestled in a more desolate area between North Beach and the Embarcadero which makes finding free street parking after 6 pm a breeze. \n\nAcclaimed as the top basque chef in America, Chef Hirigoyen's menu focuses on Californian influenced Spanish and French Basque dishes. Every dish we had was very well-executed and packed a big punch of flavor which justified the high prices for the portion sizes. For a less spendy meal, try his other nearby restaurant, Bocadillos (next door to Bubble Lounge) which focuses more on Spanish Tapas.  \n\nWe started with the Dungeness Crab \"Txangurro\" w/ Orange, Grapefruit, Basil & Aioli ($16): http://bit.ly/12J1KCr which was a tower of freshly shredded sweetly tender crab. It was a very light and refreshing way to start a meal. While Mr. NSS grappled the crab appetizer, I lusted over our second appetizer, the Piquillo Pepper Stuffed w/ Goat Cheese Topped w/ Pistachios, Golden Raisins ($14): http://bit.ly/140RAZI. An absolute must order, the goat cheese was like devouring creamy, fluffy clouds with a nice textural contrast from the crunchy pistachios. The golden raisins gave it a lovely pop of sweetness. \n\nFor our mains, Mr. NSS had the Roasted Rack of Lamb w/ Merguez Sausage, Fennel, Cumin & Date Relish ($32): http://bit.ly/1600lUZ. The lamb was succulently tender but the date relish was what made the dish; it was like a savory and tart honey glaze. I was delighted with my Seared Duck Filet w/ Braised Carrots, Coriander, Orange & Green Olives ($29): http://bit.ly/14yZ87Z.. One of the best duck dishes I've had,  the breast was perfectly rendered and seared leaving a deliciously crunchy skin atop. The breast was lean yet had a luxurious fatty flavor. Loved the accompanying sweetly crisp braised carrot as well. The better half grappled half of my duck breast because yes, it was THAT good. I didn't mind because I had dessert all to myself (Mr. NSS doesn't eat sweets). The Biarritz Rocher ($9) was calling my name on the menu and it was a wise choice: http://bit.ly/12qa1tF. A Ferrero Rocher in dessert form, this was THE best dessert I've ever had. The chocolate mousse was divinely light and airy while the hazelnut crust was chock-full of crunchy hazelnut bits. Words can't describe how heavenly this dessert. GET THIS!\n\nService was friendly and very timely though not very polished. Dishes were abruptly plopped on our table without any explanation by the food runner while our waiter was stretched thin. He had to tend to our section and the outdoor dining area which understandably lowered the attentiveness. Had service been a tad better, this would definitely be a solid 5 star review. \n\nPiperade is easily one of my top picks for date night especially if you want to \"secure the goods\" as Mr. NSS so eloquently put it. \n\nOh yah, no date is complete with starting with one or two...ok, three cocktails. I had the tequila based Spring in Biarritz ($10): http://bit.ly/11inn6s. And, you know how Mr. Tequila and I roll. *Wink Wink*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Sweetening the deal was my Bloomspot for a 3 courses for 2 (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert). I called to make reservations a week ahead of time and had no problems, but we did have an early dinner (5:30pm) since we were meeting up with friends after. We arrived a little early, and saw that they were allowing patrons in before they technically opened at 5:30pm. We were greeted at the door by the host, and sat promptly. Our server was very attentive and came over right away. We ordered:\n\n-Calamari \"a la Plancha\" (Fennel, Olive, Caper, Coriander, Lemon, $15, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g): Good. The calamari was cooked very well, and they very nicely split the plate without us asking. Although, I felt the olives and capers overpowered the subtle taste of the calamari a bit, I would still recommend this dish.\n-Veal Cheeks (Roasted Red Peppers, Fingerling Potatoes, $29, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#sne9CJ87yEziFM7M2TIYlQ): The veal cheeks were fork tender, but the dish overall was very bland! They definitely need to add more salt/seasoning, since it was hard to eat the tasteless red peppers and potatoes. This dish was also too watery for my liking, and I'm not sure I would order it again.\n-New York Steak (Romesco, Broccoli Rabe, Garlic, Ossau-Iraty, $32, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#Q_zAwzRySo-At4j0AfLSiw): The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and I loved the sear on the steak. However, the NY cut was too lean for my preference, and it got a little boring to chew after a while, even with the romesco sauce. My favorite part of the meal was actually the broccoli rabe that accompanied this dish, since it was topped with shaved parmesan pieces.\n-G\u00e2teau Basque (Cherry Preserves, $9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#zxBcqT2sxr48omcfufRR1w): Eh.. just ok. The custard filling was good, but the crust of the basque was too dry. I liked the version I had at a bakery in Portland a lot more. This version wasn't worth the $9- Skip!\n\nI mostly enjoyed my dinner at Piperade, but I'm glad I had my Bloomspot deal, and am not sure I would return and pay full price for a meal here. The ingredients seemed quality and were cooked well, and they gave you a good sized portion, but I just didn't love any of the dishes for some reason. For the prices, I would rather dine at a number of nearby restaurants in the Financial District where I've had tastier food. I agree with Marisa G. that the other diners were considerably older (I'm in my late twenties), and it seems like they have a lot of regulars.

I had made the choice to order it to share only because it's a staple in the Iberian diet (well, ham).\n\nFor the entrees, I ordered the \"Seared Filet Of Duck with braised romaine, cippolinis, cherries & pork wine sauce\" which was very well done.  I had it done medium-rare (consistency of steak) since that's the best way to have game meat... if duck is cooked too well prepared, then the meat is dry and unpalatable.   It was rich with flavor and the texture was great, and the romaine, small onions, and cherries complimented the complex flavors of the seared duck.  Absolutely delicious.  I had it paired with a Basque red wine, which I cannot remember the name, but they went together VERY well.\n\nLastly for dessert, we all ordered our own separate things, but I had the turron mousse cake with roasted almonds.  If you are a big fan of turron, what Spaniards and Italians have during the Christmas season, then you'll love this cake. It tasted like eating turron but in a soft, cake form...delicious.  It was paired with a glass of their sparkling moscato, which wasn't too sweet or too dry--so the two went together perfectly.  \n\nIf you look at the menu online, there aren't any prices listed.. usually that means $$$.  And with no exception, this place is actually kind of expensive.  Each of us ate about $60 or more worth of food... but it was well worth every penny.  This place is really cozy, so it's a definite great place to bring someone on a date to!", "author": "Matthew L."}

I went with the Basque rice (risotto) as my entree & my fianc\u00e9 had the New York steak. My dish was  rich in flavor, & cooked to perfection. My fianc\u00e9 was not blown away by his steak, unfortunately. We shared the dark chocolate cake (gluten free!!!) for dessert. It was sublime. I only wished we'd each gotten our own! Yum. \n\nI will certainly be back. I'd love to dine at their outdoor tables (great outdoor space), or one of their window tables. \n\nOnly negatives - we weren't informed of the night's specials.

It turned out to be the best Basque place I have ever been to in the states.  Having a little Basque blood in me, this occasion felt a little more personally intimate for me.  The ambiance and the decor was fantastic with touches of Basque decor.  The selection of dishes are plentiful which was great to see.  The head chef even came out to my table and asked \"Who has the Basque name here?\" since the reservation was under my last name and chatted us up.  Very pleasant fellow.  Now on to the food.  I was not alone in this dinner endeavor so i will give a list of things I remember us ordering.  \n\nFor the Tipiak's:\n  - Calamari\n  - Mushroom tartlet\n  - Foie Gras\nFor the Haundiak's:\n  - Piperade\nFor the Euskaldunak's:\n  - Seafood & Shellfish Soup \"Ttoro\"\nFor the Goxoak's:\n  - Orange Blossom Beignets\n  - Warm Apple Tart\n  - Gateau Basque\n\nI cannot tell you how much I enjoyed my meal.  Every dish was a homerun and wish my stomach was bottomless.  I particularly loved the mushroom tartlet, the Piperade, and the three desserts were phenomenal.  My dad was here from out of town and got to partake in this experience and he was impressed with the food and wished they served something even remotely close to this back home.  I am definitely going back here as this place was right for me in every way.  Even if you have no idea what Basque food is like, there is stuff on the menu for everyone with taste buds from all walks of life.

We were seated timely, but that was the only thing timely.  The entire time we had a hard time finding someone to take our order.  The time between each course was too long, and in each case, we seemed to have to flag down the server.  We would have ordered another bottle of wine, since the first bottle was empty just before our entrees arrived, but no one ever came to say, \"would you like another bottle\"?  Overall length of dinner was 2 hours, 45 minutes, and although we were enjoying each other's company, I could tell my guests were getting antsy.  Ok, that's the negative. \n\nOn the positive side, when the server arrived, she was pleasant.  I asked her for a Spanish wine recommendation, and she immediately recommended a Rioja Reserva I hadn't heard of, but it seemed moderately priced (by restaurant standards), and it turned out to be awesome.  I later found out it had been rated 94 by Wine Spectator, and was in their Top 100 wines of 2013.  Great choice and a good find.  They sell it at K&L for $30, and I will buy some.\n\nThe food was also excellent.  We had several appetizers, including a cold crab salad, calamari (not fried) and stuffed peppers -- all very good.  For entrees, most got either the lamb chops or the steak.

Although you are not having tapas, the flavors aren't too different.  The preparation here isn't complex, and the approach in cooking is relatively conservative.  The quality of ingredients can be hit & miss.  While I enjoyed their veggies and lamb, I felt their NY steak was unforgivably poor.  Ordering the right dishes here, or at least one that fits your preference will make a considerable difference.  \n\nOn to the food;\n\n-'Butter Lettuce + Fresh Herb Salad' ($10 or part of prix fixe)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=lYW2-NnVpPFjTheytHdD9w\n\nI had this as part of my prix fixe.  Salad itself is quite fresh, and a generous portion is offered.  I like butter lettuce, because I feel (as the name implies) it has a more buttery texture and it one of my favorite greens.  Ultimately it wasn't a bad dish, but the use of the herb (I'm guessing vinaigrette) dressing really didn't add much to the greens.  I don't think there would be much difference if they served the greens as is.  Dish rating, 45% (two and a half stars).\n\n-Haricots Vert Salad, Black Mission Fig, Perfect Blondes ($13)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=Rbdo67vnABZOVLH3xEqGAQ\n\nThis was dessert of string beans with fig and various spices, the most notable being (what I would guess as) mint.  Walnuts were a nice touch.  It's a nice simple appetizer, and the ingredients hold their own.  I felt it was a bit overpriced, but a good dish nonetheless.  Would have also be a fairly solid side dish for an entree.  65%\n\n-Cherry Tomato Tartlet, Basil, Balsamic ($13)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=ddqVs0X5FNEVq8uMBcy6Zg\n\nOne of the better appetizers of the evening.  This was a simple tomato tart, but executed well on every level, albeit the concept was more on the conservative side.  Tomatoes & basil were fresh.  Just the right amount of basil & balsamic were used.  The pastry crust has a nice tender texture to it.  temperature was perfectly warm. Good execution and good balance of pronounced flavors.  81%  (four and a half stars).\n\n-Cold Poached Foie Gras, Black Pepper, Sea Salt + Rhubarb Compote ($20)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=KS0m6WkOtGa3gJMUUcVAnw\n\nNot a bad foie gras dish, although short of exceptional.  This was similar to some of the foie gras torchons that I've had prior.  Texture is rather dense, and it is predictably heavier.  Unfortunately the flavor of the foie was a bit more muted than I would have preferred.  I felt the flavors of the dish were brought out more by the pepper, salt, & rhubarb jam.  I can't remember what bread was used, but I don't recall it being any better than the usual choice of brioche.  Portion size is reasonable however.  50%\n\n-Balcao of Raw Cod & Oysters with Creme Fraiche\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=npaw3jwOfv4lK8t6rrHC2A\n\nThe raw fish here isn't similar to Japanese Sashimi, Italian Crudo, or Ceviche.  It was too briney for my palate, and so are raw oysters.  One bite of this was already more than enough for me.  Just not my thing, but some of my dining companions enjoyed it more.  I'm not going to rate this because it's not something I would appreciate even if executed well.\n\nContinued, please refer to 'earlier review'", "author": "Adrian Robert H."}

The food is usually quite nice, but there's just something,,,not right. Last night I figured out what it is.\n\nWent in with a TravelZoo voucher for the 2 glasses of sparkling wine, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 dessert menu ($79). Not a bad deal. Were were seated right away, the waiter came over, took the voucher and immediately returned with the wine. If he had waited to talk to us, I would have said, bring one now and one later (for my SO), since I didn't plan on having the sparkling wine at all. The waiter seemed somewhat distracted when he took our order. Perhaps he wanted a different set of diners.\n\nFood was excellent, though. I had the smoked herring salad, husband had the cheese plate; I had the lamb rack (done perfectly), husband the seafood stew (served somewhat cool). We would have asked for a warmer stew IF THE WAITER HAD STOPPED TO ASK US HOW ANYTHING WAS. But he didn't. We were seated in a spot where he had to pass us constantly and he seemed purposely not to look at us.\n\nWe had to flag someone down to ask for pepper and more water. Who has to ask for water in a restaurant of this caliber?  \n\nDuring the meal, the bus boy would stop by and remove something from the table that needed removing, but not everything. We spent the meal looking at 2 olive oil dispensers (why 2? I surely don't know) and dirty wine glasses and flutes. But the waiter NEVER returned to the table. Except to throw, and I do mean throw, down the dessert menus.\n\nMy orange blossom honey beignets were outstanding and hubby enjoyed his apple tart. Time for the check. Where did our waiter go? Hmmmm. He finally did drop, and I do mean drop, the bill on the table on one of his fly bys. No smile. No thanks. No looking directly at us.\n\nUnfortunately the Travelzoo voucher requires an 18% tip, otherwise we would have made an adjustment.\n\nSo, what I figured out about Piperade is that they concentrate on the food and only the food, but that is not the only reason we go to a restaurant. We like to have a comfortable time in a welcoming environment. It will be a long while before we return to Piperade, if ever. And we live only 3 blocks away.", "author": "Diane K."}

To begin with, our group shared these apps:\n\nCalamari \"a la Plancha,\" Asian Pear, Mint\nTerrine of Warm Sheep's Milk Cheese + Ham\nPiquillo Peppers stuffed with  Goat Cheese, Pistachios and Raisins\n\nTheir apps and desserts are hands down the best part of the meal.  The calamari was grilled and refreshing, the terrine was UBER salty but so fatty that little bites were still foodgasmic, and the piquillo peppers were stuffed with heavenly creamy goat cheese.  Honestly, I wished I had ordered two more apps for myself as my entree.  Here were the reasons why I didn't like the entrees:  \n\n- I thought the roast chicken was pretty boring, as well as the steamed rockfish.  I just wish there was a little more umph to it.  It was fine quality, but I like the rockfish I steam at home better (or perhaps its just I don't like the subtlety of the basque style fish/chicken?\n\n-My husband's new york steak came out medium to medium well, which is truly upsetting when you expect a medium rare.  He had to sit there while we all ate and by the time he got his food back, he wasn't hungry. This definitely ruined it for him. \n\n+ On the plus side, my friend got the rack of lamb and he loved it.  We all agreed we should have gotten his dish instead. \n\nFor the desserts:\n* Dark Chocolate Cake \"Amatxi\" & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche\n* Milk Chocolate & Hazelnut \"Biarritz Rocher\"\n* Orange Blossom Beignets\n\nI loved the airy and chewy texture of the beignets, but felt they lacked something; whether it was a creme to dip in the beignets or more flavor in general.  I didn't like rocher, since the botttom crispy part had tasted like it was previously frozen, and maybe even had frost bite on it at one point.  Definitely the Dark Chocolate Cake was the winner, and I would be happy to get this every time.", "author": "Hannah W."}

I feel like every time I buy a restaurant coupon I have high expectations, only to be let down. I will say we got a *good* deal, as in we paid $69 for the Travelzoo voucher and food alone regular price would have been $114 (plus 2 glasses of champagne with the deal). Then again, they add tax + 18% mandatory tip on top of that, so you end up paying way more than intended. \n\nGreat rustic atmosphere with outdoor seating area, although it's definitely an older crowd, potentially because it's in a back alley/warehousey section of North Beach. No problem getting an online reservation for a Thursday night, and we were seated right away. We were pretty close to the 2 tables beside us, like when we stopped talking we could hear every word of both their conversations. Not quite ideal. Our server definitely took her time getting to our table, and was rushed, rude, and inattentive the entire night. We heard her say to the couple beside us how completely swamped she was (\"sigh\"), and how she had too many tables, but honestly she just seemed to hate her job. We actually had to ask for ice for our water, and I had to request salt & pepper shakers from the bus boy. I guess I get the whole European authenticity thing, but we're in America here ...\n\nThey were out of the cheese plate, which I was most excited about ordering, and so we ended up with the serrano ham and crab txangurro appetizers, which admittedly were both excellent. I had the halibut entree which was tasty, but my bf's steak was way overcooked when he had specified medium rare. The spectacular desserts would have partially made up for the poor service, if only our waitress hadn't forgotten to bring us our leftovers after we asked her to bag them. (????!!)

On days that I'm not too concerned about carbs, I'll get a toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese, tomato, and pesto. Pass on the baked egg whites - the whites are overdone and bland. Frittatas are tastier but heavy, and I've found egg shells more than a few times in mine. Lunch runs around $8+. The chicken mandarin salad ($7.95) is my go-to salad, although I'm usually hungry again by 4pm. I also like the side tuna & black rice salad, but it's so small that I usually get a soup along with it.   \n\nOn rainy days, the lines are ridiculous and you're better off walking in the rain a few blocks away cause you'll get your food faster than the suckers staying in line.

And unfortunately, this place is one of them. Of course, if the food was good, I wouldn't complain, but it really didn't deliver; I was truly hoping that Piperade would have amazing food with all the decorative hype. \n\nThe service was cordial and the restaurant is quite nice. A bit on the fancy side, which is perfect for a business luncheon when the food is only secondary to the conversational transaction. \n\nI do like the originality of the Piquillo peppers. It's stuffed with goat cheese with pistachios and golden raisins on the side. For an appetizer, it's delicious! The goat cheese was slightly warmed and melted inside the peppers, and the sweet taste of the raisins added a nice touch to lighten the flavor. Piquillo peppers: 5/5!\n\nThe tuna sandwich I ordered turned out cold and dry, so I don't recommend it. It's actually a real tuna sandwich, where a thick piece of tuna fish is stuck in the middle of two pieces of bread. The tuna was seared well, such that the middle was still half raw, like how one would cook medium-well steak... but it came out cold! Also, because the tuna was so healthy, it lacked any flavor to help take down the bread. I was so disappointed, that I actually wished I had a normal tuna sandwich. At that point I didn't mind having just pieces of tuna marinated in mayo...I just wanted SOMETHING that had SOME flavor! I think the dish would have been better if the tuna wasn't in a sandwich form.

Good, but thank goodness I only had 1/2 of one.\n\n- Rack of lamb with cumin-date sauce, veggies and fennel bulb. For the longest time, we couldn't figure out what the mystery white vegetable was --- cabbage? onion? artichoke? --- No, apparently it's fennel. Ok, moving on the meat. The lamb was cooked exactly as we requested with a charred outside. The veggies were also very well seasoned.\n\n- Steak with a small sauce-platter of romesco and broccoli rabe. I've never had romesco with steak and it was brilliant. Need to try that at home next time. The broccoli rabe had parmesan cheese melted on top which really hid the bitterness of the rabe well. Delicious! And of course, the steak was PERFECTLY cooked with a crusty, grilled outside.\n\n- Dessert: Dark chocolate cake with cr\u00e8me fraiche. It was like a dark chocolate flourless cake.

This is totally fine with me, as long as the experience is good.  The patrons were all noticeably older.  In our mid-thirties, I think we were by far the youngest people in the restaurant!  As others have mentioned on Yelp, you are sitting very close to other tables so it's hard to not to eavesdrop on people's conversations.\n\nFood:  for appetizers we ordered the grilled calamari and the Serrano ham, which were both quite tasty.  The Serrano ham was very overpriced though, considering how much you get.  The grilled calamari was probably my favorite part of the dinner, very tender and perfectly seasoned.  For entrees we split the Cornish game hen and the New York steak.  The Cornish game hen was good, but the New York steak was even better!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium-rare and came with a yummy sauce for dipping.  Since we got two appetizers we didn't order dessert.\n\nService:  We had to wait over 20 minutes for our appetizers because of a large, private party that was in the restaurant. Once the waiter noticed he did apologize and our appetizers eventually came.  We had to ask for our waters to be refilled and I also had to ask for another glass of wine, which was a bit annoying (even more so because I was starving and irritated from waiting).  Our waiter was nice enough to comp my second glass of wine because of the wait, which was a nice touch.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon unless there's another Bloomspot deal because it's not worth their price point when there are so many other restaurants to choose from in the city.", "author": "Marisa G."}

I had the Monday Classic: Albacore \"Marmitako,\" Saffron, Potatoes (loved the saffron flavor with the albcacore), and then we shared the G\u00e2teau Basque with Cherry Preserves (nice light cake with sweet cherry preserves, loved this combination).  Piperade also a nice wine selection, and the cocktails looked interesting too.  Service was helpful in making recommendations, pleasant dining environment with lovely decor.

Round two did not disappoint. Heading here with another traveling colleague, we both thought it was a great meal. \n\nWe began with the Dungeness Crab \"Txangurro,\" which was light and flavorful, and paired very nicely with the Beef Crudo. The Fingerling chips with the crudo were a really nice touch. I chose the Alaskan Halibut for my meal. It was perfect cooked, seasoned beautifully and the roasted corn relish added a great dimension. Meanwhile, the green and yellow zucchini medley that supported it left me pleasantly surprised by its grilled flavor and nothing like the soggy mess that often characterizes zucchini dishes.\n\nWe finished off the meal by splitting the orange blossom beignets (which were good - but I would have like a little more of the orange flavor to come through) and the \"Milk Chocolate & Hazelnut 'Biarritz Rocher'\", which pleasantly surprised me. The waitress described as something like a Ferrero Rocher concoction, whereas this was a delicious mousse-like centerpiece, on top of a crumbly and crusty chocolate base.\n\nCan't wait to head back on my next trip in town.", "author": "David B."}

The food here is GREAT, which is why it makes it so frustrating!!! My main complaint is the short girl with the dark hair. She came on as soon as Zach left and the service has gone WAY DOWN HILL since then. She moves at a snails pace and it usually seems like she is half asleep. She knows nothing about any of the menu items if you ask her and she is just plain stupid and unfriendly. Sorry to be so harsh but this is a daily occurrence and I see others EVERY DAY storming off with their orders.\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to ring up orders and hand people food but this just not seem to be getting any better and it has been months now since she has been there. I work across the street and a lot of people in our office are aware of the same problem and some say they won't even go over there anymore.\n\nTo the Management: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE fix this problem!!!", "author": "Randall F."}

I felt like I could reward myself with a night out and I was ready to eat up a storm and not feel guilty about overdoing it. \n\nI believe that first impressions are important and I loved this place from the start.  It's tucked away on a corner, subtle but classy.  I was looking forward to trying Basque food.\n\nMatt and I were fashionably early and the waiters offered us a seat at the bar.  The bartender didn't glare at us when we both just asked for waters. \n\nEventually, the rest of our party arrived and we proceeded to our table and started admiring the menu. :)  This is what we ended up trying:\n\nTipiak small plates: \nDungeness crab with basil, roasted pepper and mango\nWarm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine\nCalamari \"a la plancha\"\nPiquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts and golden raisins\nThinly sliced serrano ham\nEndive salad with pomegranate seeds and persimmon \n\nFor big plates, I ordered the braised seafood and shellfish stew in red pepper sauce.  My dining companions tried the lamb chop, roast duck, sea bass and another fish dish that I can't remember the name of now.  I loved the stew that I had.  For the price, I felt like it was very worth it.  The portion was perfect and the sauce that coated all the seafood was really flavorful. \n\nTheir menu has seasonal features so if you go on the website, you won't always be able to see the full selection of what they currently have.\n\nOn top of all the food (Hey, I said all-out-no turning back right?), we started the night off with two bottles of Basque wine at the recommendation of our server.  Both of the wines were wonderful.  We tried one white, one red.  The white wine was really fantastic.  It was on the dry side, very light and refreshing, with a taste of apple mixed in.  I'm by no means a wine expert so this is just what my elementary palate remembers from last night. \n\nOut of all the small plates, my favorite was the piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and the calamari.  Both were really well done and I'd definitely get them again.  For some reason, the sheep's milk ham and cheese terrine didn't leave a big impression on me but if you go there, you should still try it.\n\nOh! I almost forgot about the desserts!!!  I had the cornmeal cake with strawberry compote and creme fraiche and also tried some of the orange blossom beignet as well as the kefir cheese yogurt with seasonal berries and honey.  I also tried a glass of their moscato to go along with dessert.   The cornmeal cake was a bit dry and hard.  Not sure if that is how Basque cornmeal cake is supposed to be, but it was worth a try, although I don't think I would get it again. The orange blossom beignets were delicious though.\n\nIf you're ever looking for an intimate classy restaurant to enjoy a night of great food (and spend some $$) , Piperade is the place to go!", "author": "Gloria C."}

The food was hands down some of the best I've had in the city and the presentation was equally as impressive. The last time I had basque food was in a casual environment with heaping family style portions so I wasn't sure what to expect with a higher end establishment. \n\nStarters:\nWe started with the Picquillo Peppers and the Sheep's Milk Cheese + Ham and both were amazing, packed with tons of unique flavors--nothing like I've experienced before. I also tried the split pea soup with ham, which was very fresh and tasty, and unlike your traditional green gooey split pea soup (which I also very much enjoy). And like most restaurants, they provided bread and olive oil. The bread was pretty average but the olive oil was very tasty and had a strong olive flavoring. I probably should have stopped after my 5th piece of bread... \n\nEntrees:\nI ordered the Roasted Rack of Lamb, which was cooked to order (medium-rare) with a charred outter layer. The lamb was packed with flavor and was very tender, and was not too gamey. My dish also came with braised fennel and a sausage which complimented the lamb very well! My fiance ordered the Pacific Petrale Sole over a bed of spinach and fried garlic. Mmmm-mmmm that combination makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I think I enjoyed her dish more than mine!\n\nDessert:\nBy this time, we were pretty stuffed but we decided to split a dessert: the Gateau Basque. This was a nice dessert given our level of stuffedness because it was very light and not overly sweet. There was a very subtle hint of almond which I loved. All in all, a great choice.\n\nService:\nWe were sat immediately per our reservation. Our server was very nice and informative. She didn't come by often, but she also didn't neglect us. My fiance and I had time to chat without being interrupted every 5 minutes, so that was nice.\n\nOverall, my fiance and I were pleasantly surprised at this restaurant and will 100% be returning, next time with friends and family to help spread the word!", "author": "Eric C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-19", "description": "I really like the food at Piperade but I must admit that I was fairly disappointed with the To-Go outpost. Perhaps it's unfair to compare the two but if you see the Piperade name, you expect a certain standard. \n\nThe Basque influence of the mother-ship does not fully transfer over to the pick-up lunch spot. On that note, Piperade To-Go doesn't actually cook anything. Everything's done at Piperade's kitchen (the server said so himself) then brought to this little nook. Some of the quality must have fallen off the trolley along the way I guess. Not that it's inedible by any means but the fried chicken in a Mr. Williams sandwich for example, has long lost its crunch by the time you put it in you mouth. \n\nWith that said though, I really like the folks who work here. Upbeat and friendly, they kept conversations going plus they also take cards which is nice. I can see how having a salad here is the thing to do since they don't really make anything in-house but for a lunch time spot, I think there are better options around.", "author": "Jon L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-18", "description": "YUM. I have been a loyal Piperade guest since probably 2006. It is consistently an enjoyable spot, whether you're just popping in for a drink (or 3) at the bar, indulging in a few apps, or sitting down to a full-fledged dinner.\n\nI must start off with what I consider the beacon of their menu, which is the Calamari a la Plancha. If you are someone who only enjoys calamari when it is battered and fried to death, then this is not for you. What it is, in all of its tasty glory, is a perfectly cooked squid (not battered or fried) drizzled with a red wine-type of sauce that is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Don't skip the bread basket as you'll want to use a piece or two to sop up any remaining sauce after you've thoroughly enjoyed the calamari itself.\n\nAlthough the menu changes seasonally, I think I have tried almost everything or at least a version of what is on the current menu. Honestly, I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't enjoy. I generally change up my order depending on what I am in the mood for that day. If you happen to pop in on a Tuesday, don't skip the Calamari with Ink Sauce (if two calamari dishes are too much for you, might I suggest starting with the Crab Tower or Piquillo Peppers instead?). If it's not Tuesday, my go-to entree is probably the Duck; my best girlfriend alternates between the Lamb and the Shellfish Stew.\n\nIf there are at least two of you, be sure to get the manchego gratin as a side. You won't be disappointed.\n\nLastly, don't forget to finish off with some dessert. Although I tend to be a chocolate fanatic (and their dark choc cake is fantastic), I usually end up getting the almond mousse cake. It is a little more unique and is a great, light-ish way to finish off such a tasty meal.\n\nNow I may need to visit Piperade tonight now that I've relived all of these dishes in my mind while writing this review...", "author": "Nicole A."}

I made reservations over the phone in the morning around 10am and the lady said I had the last reservation!!  \r\n\r\nWe showed up about 7am about 30 minutes before our reservation but we were seated anyways.  It wasn't busy yet.  B. got a glass of wine and then we got bread which was good which we dipped w/ the slightly spicy olive oil.  Later we noticed there was a red pepper floating above the olive oil.  \r\n\r\nEverything sounded good on the menu so it was a tough decision.  Dishes we tried: garlic soup w/ rock shrimp, bacon, bread & egg $10-was good but I was expecting a creamy soup--it was too watery for me and didn't come with any bacon that I could see or taste.  \r\n\r\nWarm Piquillo peppers w/ goat cheese, Calif raisins & moscated vinaigrette $10 was good, but for the price I'll skip it next time.\r\n\r\nB. got a cod dish appetizer that he really liked.  $10-$12 can't remember.\r\n\r\nMain dishes:\r\nMarinated lamb chops w/ a potato gratin $23-Excellent.  Very tender and juicy, ask for it medium rare!  Potato gratin was delicious.\r\n\r\nI got the veal cheeks comes w/ peas and corn and some brown sauce. $23.  I liked the veal cheeks-which was very tender but I didn't like the peas-too hard, corn was just ok--maybe from a can.\r\n\r\nDessert-we tried the turron mouse cake w/ roasted almonds. $7.  It was very light tasting and the almonds were crunchy reminding me of corn flakes a bit.  \r\n\r\nTotal was around $90 after tax but before tip.  I'd go back to try other dishes such as the warm sheep's milk cheese & ham terrine $12, steamed pacific snapper $19, Biarritz chocolate rocher dessert $7; or the chocolate cake \"amatxi\" $7.

It's a cosy little restaurant. The staff was prompt and welcoming, we were seated right away. \n\nThe wine list is pretty impressive, from the finest Basque wines to wines from France, Spain and then, our very own California wines. We got served with some fresh bread and delicious olive oil to compliment our wine/bubbles.\n\nWe had a bunch of appetizers, and here is what I would recommend:\n    - Dungeness Crab \"Txangurro,\" Mango, Peppers, Basil : Served cold and absolutely incredible in flavor. I was enjoying the chunks of mango and pepper. \n   - Piquillo Peppers, Goat Cheese, Pistachios, Golden Raisins : Being not such a big fan of cheese, in general, I'm skeptical trying it. But this was a perfect 10 for me, absolutely delicious and the texture was firm yet smooth. I happily went for a round two.\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy was the Cold Poached Foie Gras, Sea Salt, Black Pepper, Fruit Compote, it was my first experience with Cold Poached Foie Gras and the after taste it left me with, didn't make me happy. People in the party seemed to enjoy it but it did make me loose my appetite for a few. \n \nI had the Black Cod, Broccolini, Baby Leeks, Pil-pil Aioli. An absolutely well done, well presented and delectable item. Cod was mild and tender, the portion is small. I did sample some Lamp chops and NY steak, but the tenderness of the Cod beats all the other sampling I indulged in that night.\n\nOut of the desserts, what stands out was, The Dark Chocolate Cake \"Amatxi\" & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche. \n\nI would like to try Bocadillos Tapas+ Wines, since Chef Gerald Hirigoyen owns that as well.", "author": "En J."}

Neither the food, nor the atmosphere, nor the service compensates for the price exacted for not buying into their sad, pricey champagne offerings.  Next time, I will sacrifice an evening at Piperade.

But strangely enough, it was now that I would only truly discover and appreciate what the food is about. I've recently returned from Spain and spent a significant time in the Basque country which is where the chef and our server hailed. Now unfortunately the many dishes that I really loved just arent available here as the nature of seafood,produce, etc are just too wildly different. However we still found many things to be attractive and went as follows:\n\n-Warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine with aged sherry\n-Calamari a la plancha with fennel, olive, caper and coriander salpicon\n-Cold poached foie gras with black pepper, sea salt and apple compote\n-Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, and golden raisins\n-Lamb basquaise chops with gigante beans and zikiro vinaigrette\n-Gateau basque with cherry preserves\n\nThey were out of the Axoa special and they didnt have things like pil-pil, caillos, kokotxa, txipirones, or bacalao/hake which I was really looking forward to, but all the familiar basque flavors were there. I had ordered a glass of Txakoli which kind of perked our servers attention. As we spoke further I found out that she was from a village outside of Lasarte which houses one of the most famous Basque restaurants Martin Berasategui. I then started talking about all the places throughout San Sebastian/Donostia  that I had been and she said I made her homesick! It was very cool to be able to relate to someone who grew up on the other side of the world. I always say that the easiest way to be accepted by another's culture is to eat their food and it sure held true here. At the end of our meal I was asking about dessert wines and was offered some complementary Patxaran, which is a specific Basque digestif. The same thing happened to me at Arzak in San Sebastian. It's true the hospitality of the Basque people! They are so damn friendly!\n\nIn normal form, we closed the place down and I'm excited to go back.

If you love Spanish serrano ham, order it here.  The ham is piled high on the plate. The ahi tuna was seared just right and comes in a soup bowl with sliced potatoes.  Our friends liked the flavors in the garlic soup and calamari, but both felt their dishes were somewhat salty.\n\nEveryone enjoyed the entrees.  We ordered the lamb chops, the seafood stew, and the locally caught halibut.  Everything was cooked perfectly, and each entree was very generous.  Definitely order the lamb chops if you love lamb.\n\nThe noteworthy dessert was the orange blossom beignets.  Came 4 in a bowl, and was very hot.  Sure the inside was a little doughy as noted by another Yelper, but not uncooked.  More like a custard texture.\n\nOur server was very reserved, but efficient.", "author": "Shirley N."}

Obviously it was good enough that I was happy to return, which I did earlier this week.   A friend of mine drove up from the South Bay and I suggested we revisit this restaurant for lunch.   Him being Basque, I thought he might enjoy a taste from home.\n\nMy friend ordered the fish stew, which he enjoyed.   I for one tried to be a little adventurous and decided to go with 2 appetizers.  I had the Foie Gras and the Piquillo Peppers stuffed with goat cheese.   The portion of Foie was quite generous though I thought it was served a little too cold and hard for my taste.  While the piquillo pepper dish was lovely and tasted good, I couldn't help but compare it to the same dish I had at Julian Serrano in Las Vegas last month.   Obviously the dish paled compared to Serrano's masterful creation.    Nevertheless, all in all it was a nice dining experience and I definitely recommend you check out Piperade.", "author": "David O."}

A coupon on Bloomspot finally gave me an excuse to go.  The ambiance is warm, the service was both friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  The seasonal cocktail list was full of tempting options.\n\nTo start, we split the dungeness crab, with blood oranges, basil, and grapefruit.  The lumps of crab were generous and tasty, and the citrusy fruit complimented it quite well.  We also tried the gigante beans with bacalao and caviar, which was quite good.  It wasn't the heavily salted bacalao of Spain, but a fresher-tasting version (it nearly reminded me of ceviche).  \n\nFor dinner, I had the seared duck filet and my husband had the lamb.  Both were cooked perfectly.  I don't think I had enough entrees when I was in San Sebastien to really speak to the food's authenticity (we primarily ate at pintxo bars), but my impression is that this food is California Spanish Basque.  What seemed to be fresh, local ingredients inspired by Basque cooking.\n\nFor dessert, we split the milk chocolate and hazelnut \"biarritz rocher,\" which was an amazing pastry that, as the named suggests, tasted like a Ferrero Rocher (but better).

The steak was cooked well but shouldn't have been cooked a second longer for medium.  We then shared the mousse cake with almonds.  My bf who is French said it reminded him of something he used to eat in France.  It was delicious and not something you normally see on the menu.  \n\nFood, 4 stars but the service 2 stars.

My asparagus side was lovely and my halibut cooked to perfection, but that arugula salad cast a heavenly halo over everything.  My host, visiting from out-of-town, insisted on Piperade when he usually defers to me on SF restaurants.   He reported his meal excellent, too, but I was in raptures and didn't pay much attention (maybe the seafood stew).  Sorry.\n\nI'm not a cocktail drinker.  Give me a straight 15-20 year old single malt with a side of water and I'm a happy girl.  My host ordered a Grey Goose martini and reported it, \"Perfect!\"  He was very, very happy.  We had a Molinari chardonnay, he being a reformed wine collector and still wine lover, that he was very pleased to find on the wine list.\n\n I'm glad we went as the decor while simple had an elegance that welcomed and enfolded us.  We talked and caught up with service that supported the food and our conversation without intruding.\n\nIf you you're looking for a romantic spot, Piperade has all you need.  We weren't looking for that and yet I couldn't help imagine the simple elegance lending itself to a grand romantic gesture.  The wait staff controls the room well, but as in all high-end SF restaurants these days, the tables of shall we say self-involved \"entrepreneurs\"  trying to work business deals can be distracting.

If you like that, then you should order for sure.\n\nMain:\n- Duck: this had a really interesting sweet flavor from the pear and sauce.  The duck was pretty tender, but not the best duck I've had in SF.  Jardiniere still takes the cake for the best duck in the city.\n- Sole: BF ordered the sole because he wanted something lighter, and he definitely got it.  It wasn't anything extraordinary in my opinion - it was actually pretty  simple... a piece of fish on top of some sauteed spinach.\n\nDessert:\n- Orange Blossom Beignets: MAN i am so glad we ordered this.

I know nothing about the food.\n\nI had the house sandwich, which is good and bad. It was good because it was something easily recognizable, but it was bad because it still gave me no idea about Basque food.

Service, ambience and the food were great.  So when I recommended it for a work dinner for 8 of us, I expected more of the same.  Sadly, I was wrong.\n\nThe food as always, was terrific.  Every dish we ate was delicious and cooked exactly as we would have liked it.\n\nThe glaring issue this time was service. Our server was downright useless and felt like a banquet waiter serving 100 people in a Las Vegas hotel ballroom.  He took a half hour to first come to our table and subsequent visits were rushed, perfunctory and entirely reactive.  Not once did he make suggestions on menu items, offer to pour our wine or even ask us if we wanted anything.  We'd have to flag him down, order and/or ask for additional items including water and wine and then wait another half hour for him to show up again.  Between orders, we'd get our dishes nearly thrown down on our tables by expeditors and buss boys.  Our waiter would come by a couple of times to ask \"are you enjoying\" and then quickly disappear.  Because of his constant absence, our dinner took nearly 3 hours from start to finish, which would have been ok were we having fun instead of waiting for long periods between courses and for wine and water.  In his defense, his long absences were clearly because he was working multiple large tables including a party of 12 next to us.  That said, no one from management once came over to pick up the slack. The celebrity chef/owner of Piperade was doing his rounds around the restaurant, saying hello to patrons and kissing regular guests on the cheek.... perhaps he and his staff should have picked up the slack and covered for frazzled waiters instead of doing his celebrity round.\n\nThe icing on the cake was when our bill came with 18% \"suggested\" gratuity included.  One of my biggest gripes about our dining culture is this pervasive need to over tip and for entitled wait staff to expect 20% or more in tips for lackluster and sometimes downright bad service.  Tips should be considered a gift for good service, not expected for a terrible one.  Our hosts stayed back after the rest of us left to have a talk with our clueless waiter about his misguided expectations.  I wonder how that transpired.\n\nIn any case, back to what i said in the beginning.... the food was excellent and all things equal, I'd go back in a heart beat.  Sadly, the terrible service from last night's dinner shocked the entire group and unfortunately, terrible service overshadows good food.  In a city with a plethora of great dining venues, what sets restaurants apart is service.  In that aspect, Piperade fails miserably.

What was odd on the bill was the \"TZ deal tax\" line item charge which was then taxed again.  But overall, loved the lamb and stuffed peppers and would return in the future.", "author": "David L."}

I'd order them all again if afforded the chance to return. For dinner, I had the sole - which to be honest, didn't have a hell of a lot of flavor - and sampled my dad's shellfish stew.. excellent.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-16", "description": "I dined here last night with 5 other people, at the suggestion of one of the couples in our party. They had been here twice before, and raved about it. I've known about Piperade for quite some time but had never dined there. I was looking forward to trying it out!\n\nUnfortunately, since last night was the Chinese New Year's Parade, all of us were running way behind for our reservation. I called the restaurant and the person on the phone was very nice and understanding and told me not to worry about it - it had been a theme all night and everything was running behind. We finally all made it and after ordering drinks at the bar we were seated a short time later. Our server, who was on the older side and possibly European (?), came by pretty quickly and announced the specials. My boyfriend and I wanted to order a bottle of wine, and I instructed my boyfriend to inquire about a bottle in the $40-50 price range. the wine list is pretty extensive, so we were hoping the server would make things easier on us by offering a few suggestions. He immediately said \"the Rioja is very good\" so I flipped over to that page and saw that both the ones he suggested were either $60 or $70. If I were in charge I would have kept looking for something in our price range, but my boyfriend is more impulsive. He asked our server \"which one is better??\" and what do you think the server said? \"oh, the $70 one!\" That REALLY irritated me. I wasn't the one paying for dinner, so I let it go. Also, when the server was going around taking our orders, I said I would be ordering a few small plates and not an entree. My boyfriend had to tell our server 2-3 times that he was NOT ordering an entree.\n\nAnyway, our food was very good, a bit pricey at least for my small plates, but it arrived pretty quickly. Our server was not the most attentive, I'm not even sure he ever came by to check on us and ask how we were doing. We ordered dessert, and then the bill came. I wasn't involved in the bill paying process, but we paid with one credit card and the rest cash. When server guy came to collect the receipt, he opened up the folder, looked at it for a minute, then walked over to a nearby vacant table and looked at it some more. We all kind of looked at each other like \"WTF?\" He returned and commented that our tip was really low considering the amount of our check. I took a look at the bill and realized that my friend had tipped on the amount HE paid with credit card, not the total bill. His mistake, and we corrected it.  It was most definitely an uncomfortable moment, and I honestly don't know what I would do if I were in his position, but he definitely had major attitude with us! \n\nIn summary, I thought the food was very good, the appetizers were a bit on the pricey side (two apps equal the cost of an entree), the ambiance was very nice, and I'm still really irritated at the server upselling us on a more expensive bottle of wine than we wanted to pay for. Oh! I almost forgot - he didn't even ASK who all was having wine, he just started pouring glasses! Two members of our party were drinking something else, and one doesn't drink at ALL! Grrrrr. Not sure if I'll be in a rush to come back here.", "author": "Dina M."}

Although the food is Basque, it would be enjoyed by anybody as the meals are pretty mainstream and there are no off the wall dishes on the menu.  The Piperade itself was amazing, and probably my favorite dish of the evening.\n\nI would have given this place 5 stars, but the service was a disaster.  The host (Igor) is actually the most pleasant person there and he is from Basque country.  Igor is a delight.  If he was our waiter, I would have nothing to complain about!  Our server (Javier or John) was a total jerk.  He cut us off numerous times telling us what NOT to order.  That was helpful the first time with the wine list (many were from Spain), annoying the second, third and fourth times.  When we asked him about the Piperade he replied that he would recommend something else and stated (paraphrased): \"It is not that great.  It is traditional Basque, if you like that sort of thing.\"  Why do you think we are here buddy?  I wondered why he is even working there if he isn't stoked on the place.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  The garlic soup and ham & cheese tourine were delicious.  We also split the Piperade and rock fish -- both quite tasty.

We ordered a bottle of wine that was promptly served and they consistently kept our glasses full throughout the meal. We loved that we didn't have to worry about any exclusions on the menu so that we could freely explore the options. We opted to go for more of a family style experience, halving each dish so we could try each other's. For appetizers, we ordered the strip steak crudo with serrano chile pepper, Granny Smith apples and fingerling potato chips; and the frisee salad with warm serrano vinaigrette, goat cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers and pine nuts - EXQUISITE. The steak crudo was sliced perfectly and the blend of the textures was extremely well done. The salad was also great as a light starter with flavorful ingredients. The meal was very well coursed as we had a small break after finishing our appetizers before our entrees arrived. We ordered the roasted rack of lamb with merguez, fennel, roasted bread, pecan, cumin and date relish; and the braised pork cheeks with tempranillo, black plums, Cipollini onions and parsnips. We were most attracted to these dishes because of the unique blending of ingredients and we were absolutely not disappointed. The pork cheeks legitimately MELTED in our mouths, paired perfectly with the thick sauce and onions. The lamb had incredible flavor and went extremely well with the date relish. We took a small pause again before ramping up for our dessert course: almond turron mousse with candied almonds, and caramel custard \"Koka\" (aka flan). Once again, we were very impressed, both being just sweet enough with great flavor and texture. Overall, our experience was very memorable with amazing cuisine, great service and a cozy atmosphere.

Unfortunately the vegetarian options were quite limited.  Though tasty, I wouldn't sing the praises of any of my meal.  The desserts, on the other hand? TASTY, like OMG tasty.

I have wondered what I would review on my hundredth, alas while the restaurant wasn't 5 stars, the occasion was.  My husband and I celebrated our two year anniversary last night!!!!  Well, officially 12 years together, but two of those years we were legally wed.  So yay for us!\n\nAnyhoo, Piperade.\n\nPiperade is consistently interesting.  Unless you have been here 10 times and order the same thing every time, you will be sure to explore new regions of your palate.  \n\nThe bacaloa (salted cod) was excellent.  Presented as a thin falayed layer of sushi grade fish topped with a backbone of shucked gooey oysters and drizzled lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche, I was in heaven, but the man wasn't really having it.  As he pulled a face, his words were \"I just ate the ocean.\"\n\nI let him finish the haricot vert salad while I OGed over the bacaloa.  The salad was extraordinary (in the literal sense) as they used herbs I had never seen paired with green beans.  For example, the chef added mint to the otherwise earthy flavor that was such a nice surprise and worked cleanly with the walnuts.  It was subtle and clean. Save some bread to mop up the morsels left over after the green beans are gone; they are not to be wasted.\n\nI took fellow yelper's suggestions to forgo the big plates and stick to the small dishes and I am glad I did.  Therefore the calamari came next, which was not like any calamari I have ever had... Again the Piperade surprise.  As far as I could tell, the calamari was only cooked in the sauce.  There was no crunch because there was no breading, no deep frying or pan frying.  This was calamari you would find in a sushi restaurant; fresh and chewy.  The sauce was fantastic, but very different...spicy with fennel and coriander and salty with capers... It was really flavorful but didn't take away from the calamari.  I enjoyed the dish but was left wanting a more substantial consistency to the calamari.\n\nAnd then my favorite: the peppers stuffed with goat cheese.  God I love this dish.  If you love a really fresh goat cheese, please do yourself a favor and order this.  Perfectly softened piquillo peppers, ballooning with barely warmed goat cheese and topped with pine nuts and golden raisins. YUM.  It is just such a beautiful combination and one that I can't wait to emulate at home.   \n\nI had forewarned the man to stick with the small plates, but the steak was calling to him. I didn't taste it as I am not eating meat these days, but the consensus was that it was \"ok\" and \"not $30 good.\"  Also, he did not finish it! 12 years together and this has only happened a handful of times.\n\nBut all was good as we ended the meal with the cornbread and fruit dessert which was just perfect.  We both loved it.\n\nYes, newness is relative, but to me Piperade felt novel.  If you have an open mind and an adventurous palate, Piperade is worth the money.", "author": "Hayley W."}

Come on.. raw chicken?\n\nWe came here by default because it was the only place that could accommodate a party of 6 on short notice on a Saturday night.  We had 2 appetizers: the cold mussels with bread salad was okay, but the \"bread\" was just straight up CROUTONS. The open mushroom pie though, was AMAZING. This was the best piece of food of the entire night.\n\nThe entrees were nothing but disappointment. I ordered the lamb. It was decent, but the rack I had at Chouchou less than a month ago was way better. Also, it was way more overcooked than the medium rare that I had ordered. In fact, I'm sure the lamb that went to the other person at our table was medium rare when she had ordered medium. Umm.. when the waiter brought the food, didn't I ask, \"Is this the medium rare?\" As for the other entrees.. well.. I have nothing good to say. The sea bass was very overcooked and bland. The sauce/toppings that came with the chicken was good, but one of the chickens at our table was so undercooked that it was raw in the center. Shouldn't a chef know how long to cook a chicken breast? And the pommes frites we got on the side were simply store-bought frozen fries. Yea... totally not worth it.\n\nService was not good, either. My water glass was empty for most of the meal and no one came back to check on us, even when my friend was waiting for someone to come by to take back the raw chicken. Horrible.\n\nI guess we weren't the only ones who were dissatisfied, because the couple at the table next to us just walked out of the restaurant since their food never came out.\n\nNope, not going back there again.", "author": "Kazu O."}

Both were fantastic. The sauce on the squid was so good you wanted to sop up every bit with bread. The pepper was full of goat cheese and sweet raisins. To die for! Presentation was appetizing. The strip steak, was like a carpaccio, and was the only thing that I think could have been improved. I drizzled olive oil over the top and that helped give it flavor. It was just a little strange with apples, peppers and potato chips atop the meat. I would sub out the chips with some manchego. The gateau for dessert was very delicious, as well. Not too sweet and the sour kumquat on top was divine! Service was good. Restaurant was beautiful. Overall, I would go out of my way to come here again and keep trying new things on the menu.

Ordered a bottle of pinot noir & just sat enjoying the delish bread with our cheese. The bartender was good at knowing when to pour more wine into our glasses as well as knowing when to interrupt. I hate when servers interrupt during a good conversation, so I was glad that he knew when to interrupt & when to walk away.\n\nAs soon as we finished, I let the hostess know we were ready to take our seats (had reserved seating through opentable).\n\nDinner was... unbelievable! Their bread is so crunchy on the outside & soft & firm on the inside. We ate all the bread w/ that very olive-y olive oil dip! Loved! For entrees, my friend chose the Roasted Salmon & I picked the Duck breast per the waiter's recommendation. I was hesitant to try duck because it could go so right or more commonly.. so wrong. This duck.. did not disappoint! Ordered medium rare & pretty much licked the sauce off the plate! That sauce w/ that perfectly crispy skin & moist breast paired so perfectly! The salmon was just as good! I believe it was breaded in a tomato-y sauce, not that it tasted like tomato. But believe me.. must try! Btw thank you waiter (sry forgot his name)! \n\nOverall, good ambiance, good conversation & company, good food & good wine. What could be better?

There's outside and inside dining which are both nice and the food is very tasty. Reasonably priced and you'll walk away very satisfied. \n\nGet the Mr. Williams sandwich with pomme frites and you won't be sorry! Mr. Williams is a crusted chicken sandwich which comes with a small salad served on the side of the plate.  YUMMY!

Everything from the Poached Foie Gras to the rack of lamb to the Veal stew was tasty, hearty, and quite delicious. \n\nI was expecting a bit from the desserts, especially if Michael Bauer raved about the Beignets, but desserts were nothing special. \n\nService was great, but nothing too outstanding. Restaurant was fairly spacious and not too cramped, most or all the tables were for 4 people, so seating 2 at a 4-seater made it feel spacious.

I also haven't been to too many Spanish Basque restaurants so that added to my excitement.\n\nFirst of all, the chef/owner, Gerald Hirigoyen is so sweet. When we got there, he was playing host and kept making sure we were happy with our food and our service. Their service in general was awesome and they understood how food lovers love to eat. We like to share. So our waiter always made sure we had extra small plates so we can try each other's dishes.\n\nFor appetizers, we had their Serrano Ham and they give you a very generous heap of this. Awesome. Also ordered their roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and served with golden raisins and pistachio. I never realized how well roasted peppers went with golden raisins. This was delicious. I think my favorite was the foie gras with rhubarb compote though. I've never had foie gras with rhubarb so this was an eye opener for me. The flavors were so complimentary I couldn't stop eating it.\n\nFor the main dish, I ordered their Tuesday Special which was calamari with roasted peppers rice and squid ink. Now this was AMAZING. I've always been a huge fan of squid ink anything so when I took the first bite, I was in heaven. The squid was cooked perfectly and went really well with the roasted pepper, rice and ink. When you combined all four together in your mouth, you just didn't want the dish to end. The rock fish with spinach that my boyfriend ordered wasn't very good. The spinach was very chalky. A little disappointing. BUT my other friend's dish, duck with cherries and sunchokes was another amazing dish. I highly recommend that too.\n\nFor dessert, I had their Gateau Basque (of course) with bing cherries. This was an awesome way to end my perfect dinner. I'm looking forward to the next time I come here. I fell in love with this place. The restaurant is nice and homey and the food has that homey flavor too.", "author": "Yokes F."}

Had a lunch interview here and both my interviewer and I came away very satisfied with the food.\n\nI always believe that if a restaurant is willing to stick their name in front of one particular dish then that is the dish I need to get.  It's kinda like a fancy restaurant's way of putting a gold star next to the dish they like the best.  I had the Piperade Sauteed Serrano Ham w/ Poached Egg.  It was fantastic.  It had a bunch of sweet peppers in the dish and the tastes all came together in a great way.  The butter lettuces salad was just ok, but the main course more than made up for a so-so salad.

What to do... follow, follow, follow and add another 4 stars!\n\nI live on T-Hill and although I'm right off of Union and so is Pip\u00e9rade, we are 500 steps and a hillside apart. I guess that doesn't really make us that close! So the other night I thew on a pair of flats, stuffed my heels into my purse to thwart off the Clutz Clause, and set out on a nice walk down the Filbert Steps.\n\nPip\u00e9rade, the sister restaurant to Bocadillos, is casually decorated with architectural warmth and sports a similarly styled menu. Brick walls (like many FinDi buildings), low ceilings, raw wood beams, and a \"chandelier\" of empty wine bottles had me momentarily transferred to wine country. There was a good mix of ages present and my people watching radar was tuned up high. Most unusual spotting: A white haired man dressed in white pants, white leather motorcycle jacket holding a white double wine carrier. Sean Connery couldn't have been smoother.\n\nWell, let's get right to it. I decided to lean towards tradition and went with their famed Garlic Soup and signature dish of Pip\u00e9rade. \"Huh?\" That's what I said. So, I Wikipedia'ed it on my phone while sitting in front of the menu. Oh yeah, I'm totally \"THAT person\"! And so you don't have to be, here's what Pip\u00e9rade is:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperade\n\nDon't you feel better now? It was just as they say: a wonderful combination of bright, peppery flavors with light fluffy pieces of egg, a yolk to break, and jamon sarrano. It served as a nice accompaniment to Monday's special of Sweet Breads, which I recommend sharing. Both dishes were tasty, but to eat that many slippery lumps of lamb in one sitting could quite seriously make a person ill! As to their Garlic Soup, it was so glorious that I gave mine up to the Birthday Guest of Honor. I reluctantly ate a bowl of the Potato Leek soup, which we all agreed screamed for a little salt and pepper, and then wished it had been my birthday.\n\nThey kindly let us stay til the lights went out in the kitchen and our server, who taught us a little Basque, was lookin' like a Monday night was just not the same as Saturday.

The evening got off to a bit of a rocky start, as the Ukranian hostess with a former Soviet Block attitude asked if we wanted to be seated early.  We told her that we wanted to enjoy a drink at the bar and would like to be seated at our resy time.   Meanwhile, she seats another party in our seat at 7:55 without asking us if we wanted to give up our seat!!!  Anyway, I raised a bit of a stink, because we then didn't get seated until 8:15 or so.\n\nAside from that, our evening was fantastic!!!  The atmosphere there feels like Barcelona.  It is warm and cozzy with exposed brick and heavy timber ceilings.  The large windows look out onto Battery St., which is deserted on a weekend night.\n\nOur waiter was excellent and the consumate professional.  He is from France, and he was very knowledgable about the menu.  He helped us choose the first course and the wine, which were all excellent:\n\nHericot Verts -- had a surprising hint of mint.  Delish!\nCalamari -- perfectly cooked squid with a perfect almond tomato sauce.\nStuffed Peppers -- great blend of flavors with the cheese inside.\nTomato Tart -- Wow!!!  The cherry tomatoes were very sweet.\n\nThe second course was also very good.  I enjoyed the seafood stew, and my brother in law had the lamb, which was perfectly cookedl.  The ladies had the piperade (described by our waiter as ratatoulle without the eggplant) and the halibut.\n\nThe best part was the dessert.  The begneits were just as good as other Yelpers have described.

There is such an abundance of restaurants along the FiDi that you can eat at a new place everyday for probably a year.  We arrived at this Basque restaurant for an early lunch, warmly greeted and led to our table.  This was an introduction to Basque cuisine, which reviewing the menu and Wikipedia, is heavy on peppers and cheese.  I ordered the sheep milk cheese with ham terrine with aged sherry and the basque burger.  The ED ordered the piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and a basque burger.  The retired annuitant ordered the seared tuna salad.  The basque burger came with piperade and upon inquiry, learned that it is very similar to ratatouille.  \n\nThe sheep milk cheese was so savory and one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.  It is layered with ham terrine and quite intricate in presentation.  In addition, it came with a bed of something that tasted like thinly cut apple slices.  The sheep's milk cheese was not overpowering, yet, unlike any other cheese I've eaten.  That's not saying much as I have recently discovered a taste for it.  My only experiences are: cheddar, jack, mozzarella, Parmesan, provolone, Gorgonzola, goat and now this.  My knowledge of cheese is not vast at all.  This is an appetizer that you have to get.  The piquillo stuffed pepper was also delicious.  Its innards ozzed with goat cheese.  The Basque burger was big, however, the patty was not as flavorful as a gourmet burger should be.  Being a frites connoisseur, these fries were rather limp.  The piperade ketchup was very intense in flavor.  It tasted like spiced tomatoe purree...a very different taste.  It is definitely good in controlled portions, however, I felt that it did not serve as a good dipping sauce for my frites.  It was such an intense flavor that even a dab of this stuff on your burger will mask the burger taste in its entirety, leaving you to taste nothing but piperade.  \n\nI will definitely come here again with the swain to conduct a more thorough taste test.  The workers here are very accommodating and genuine and this place just has a very classy feel to it.  By the time we finished lunch, this place was jam packed with an assemblage of white collars in tunnel and peripheral vision.  The Basque burger left something to be desired, however, the sheep milk cheese more than compensated.  The flavours are extremely robust and I would like to see how they incorporate piperade in other dishes like fish.  \n\nps...i relinquished my coat during our seating.  when i went to retrieve it, i was intercepted by a garcon who took my coat, and held it open for me to slip my arms through.  not fond of being served in this manner, i motioned for him to desist and hand the coat over.  he stoutly refused, not budging, ever smiling.  god lam him.  it nearly brought tears to my eyes.  may the fates' spindle break on his thread of life, rendering him an immortal.  bless up.", "author": "Brian V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-27", "description": "Piperade is located on a perennially sleepy section of Battery street, skirting the base of Telegraph Hill and the long buried line of the Gold Rush waterfront;  in an area of warehouses that have long been transformed into chichi offices.  Just off Broadway, but well removed from the Barbary Coast atmosphere there, the biggest threat to the pedestrian is dying of boredom before reaching the restaurant.\n\nFortunately for the diner, Piperade has a lot more going on than the unfortunate street upon which it sits.  If you have weekdays off and don't feel compelled to eat at 11 in the morning, you can walk in to what is essentially your own private restaurant, sharing a large space with only a few other people.  The setting is of a recent modernism aging to classic---clearly not cutting edge, but not dated, either.  Nice, warm, yet elegant.\n\nWe confined ourselves to small plates, sharing the piquillo peppers;  calamari a la plancha;  Dungeness crab txangurro;  and the beans gigante---the menu changes daily and I notice that today it's mussels a la plancha and no beans gigante, with other stuff added that wasn't on the menu the day we dropped in.\n\nEverything was well prepared, tasty, well presented.  There were no \"Wow!\" moments of culinary discovery, or bliss, but if we had a complaint, it never found words to express itself.\n\nThe hands-down favorite was the Dungeness crab, in a simple preparation that allowed the sweet marine flavor and silky texture of the crab to shine through, with added tropical notes, and a light crunch from the fresh, julienned escarole that topped the dish.  The grilled calamari (a la plancha=grilled) was basically the cone and tentacles of baby squid separated but cooked otherwise intact.  Fresh, soft, and slightly smoky, this is a far cry from the fried variety I love, and I didn't care.  Seafood polyamory!  It's San Francisco!  The beans gigante were O.K.;  a cold preparation as I remember, with a small number of the big flat beans beneath what looked like slices of pickled herring (a delicate white fish, in any case), but tasted better.  Not the most impressive dish that day, but still decent.  The piquillo peppers were the Basque equivalent of Mac n Cheese:  You'd be a real sour puss not to like something with this much goat cheese stuffed into it.  The flavor burst of the creamy cheese preparation were an hard to resist delight.\n\nThe lunch ended with the dark chocolate cake amaxti with creme fraiche;  a near molten (and very warm) chocolate  cake cooled by a generous dollop of the creme fraiche, which also tempered the bitter of the chocolate itself.   The espressos coming out ahead of the cake, to be mostly consumed by the time it arrived, was the only gaffe in service we experienced.\n\nPortions are not generous but appropriate for this level of dining establishment and I'd heartily recommend eating here.", "author": "Paul T."}

It had the feeling of a place you would go with your grandparents when they visit and where all dishes should always be shared. \n\nIs it cutting edge locavore cuisine? no. Is it cheap American comfort food? no. They don't list the farms they use, nor do they add on the SF health tax on afterwards to your bill instead everything is done with class and a manner that lets the history of the food speak for itself.\n\nThere were so many smaller plates that looked interesting that we decided to get lots of them and just split a larger plate. We both started with soups, my spouse got the soup of the day which was a pea soup unfortunatly she realized after it came and she tried it that it had bacon in it and had to return it as she doesn't eat land animals. They were nice about it and removed it from our bill. I had the garlic soup which was wonderful, it has the lovely bouquet of garlic while not being bitter or too strong, there was egg and croutons floating in the broth as well as perfectly cooked prawns.\n\nSeafood is really where Piperade shines. All the seafood dishes were spot on in terms of cooking and seasoning. We had the calamari which my spouse really liked and I thought was pretty good. We both really enjoyed one of the vegetarian dishes which was a mushsroom pie which was so rich and creamy and the staff brought it out already cut in two and on two plates for us. I order the cold poached foie gras which was pricey at 20 dollars but when I saw the huge portions I understood why. This is a dish for 4 people to share. they brought out two huge torchons of foie gras with salt, pepper and quince compote. quince compote plus foie gras on toast is truly a marvelous thing. There was no way I could eat all the dish though and I brought one torchon home with me for midnight snacking.\n\nThe large entree we did share was basque stew of seafood with the wonderful pepper sauce that is used so often and it was all cooked beautifully. I really liked it while the French wife liked it but clearly since she has spent far more time eating Basque cooking at the source didn't find it so amazing.\n\nWe finished off the meal with a play on the Ferraro Rocher  with a dense chocolate mousse on top of a bed of hazelnut \"rocher\". It was one of many tempting desserts on the dessert menu and it was really lovely and one of the standouts of the evening.\n\nThe archicture may harkens back to a basque farmstead with rough brick walls, low timbered ceilings and distressed wood floors. What was lovely was how quite it was with an almost full dining room and how relaxed it felt.\n\nThere servers were almost all older men and our server was a nice uncle type who was present without being overbearing. With a spouse a with a mohawk and uniform of combat boots and cut off cargos I'm never quite sure how the service will be although usually in San Francisco we haven't had too many issues and this place followed that pattern with the staff being surprised but amused at her giant furry animal hat.

Man, did they get this one right!\n\nA warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine, perfectly salted, over a balancing slightly bitter frissee and tangy shredded green apple salad drizzled with aged sweet sherry. Oh my. I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. When the bartender turned his back, I mopped my plate with the crusty-on-the-outside, chewy soft-on-the-inside  bread.\n\nThen, I moved on to the Calamari a la Plancha. Perfectly cooked fresh squid tentacles and full pieces. The seafood was slightly sweet with a tomato-y broth that was a perfect tangy counterpoint. Again, not inhaling was  a struggle. \n\nTop off the night with a caramel custard \"koka\" (aka creme caramel). Light and luscious. Perfect with the glass of muscato gifted to me by the bartender.\n\nOh, and did I mention the lovely setting, the superb and genial waitstaff who treated a solo diner like a star, and the perfectly suggested pinot noir?\n\nI immediately recommended Piperade to all my co-conference attendees!", "author": "Leigh W."}

I can absolutely say that I will no longer return! \n\nI've always had issues with the menu items tasting like processed foods churned into charming brown-boxed goods: The orange cheese in their sandwiches is pretty much Velveeta; the Mr. Williams \"fried chicken\" looks and tastes like it came out of a supermarket freezer; mandarin oranges in a popular salad clearly come from a can. However, given the close proximity and the FRIENDLINESS/ sheer EXUBERANCE of the people there--seriously, what are they on?!--made me a regular customer, and hey, their sandwiches are decent enough. \n\nUsually the wait is rather long, but today, they neglected my order completely. As I watched entire lines exhaust and dwindle down to the last stragglers, I inquired about my order. The buoyant cashier keeps referring to some other sandwich I did not order, but never mind that, because they never made a sandwich period! She talks to the guy manning the kitchen, and instead of taking care of my order from at least 20 customers ago, he fills incoming orders until he feels my order is fit enough for his time. In my opinion, he should've made me his priority customer instead of taking his sweet a$$ time.\n\nNow, I mentioned service is usually slow, but slow meaning a total wait time of no more than 10 minutes of standing around the little window. Grilled cheese is no mad science, and half the cheese isn't even melted. I can see the beveled edges where they were sliced at the factory.\n\nWhat irritated me further was how, of course, they handed me my sandwich unapologetically and with that HAPPINESS of theirs, and then I realized that they are not \"on\" anything...they are happy out of sheer ignorance!! If I had run this window, I would've not only made my order as quickly as possible, but I would've refunded my money. But nope! Instead they've lost a customer.", "author": "Nicole L."}

But either way the servers were attentive and very very helpful when making decisions about the menu. \n\nFor appetizers we tried the calamari, peppers, and terrine. The terrine was my favorite of the three because even though it was on the salty side the flavor was delicious and the crispy texture and savory flavor paired well with the bed of julienned green apple. The calamari pieces were very sour and chewy and not really to my liking. The peppers were tasty though, with goat cheese oozing out of the grilled piquillo peppers.\n\nFor the main course I chose the strip steak with shallots, thick sliced potatoes, and portobello mushrooms. The steak was DELICIOUS. Perfectly cooked medium and juicy. Definitely my favorite compared to the lamb chops (though also very flavorful) and steamed pacific snapper. A very solid steak dish.\n\nAnd of course we had to try the beignets for dessert! These were orange blossom flavored so they had a light floral taste that wasn't too overpowering.

I booked reservations 3 weeks in advance and was counting down the days.\n\nI've never had food from the Basque region of France. I left a bit underwhelmed.  Everything sounds great on paper but I was not entirely blown away by the food I received.\n\nThe warm sheep's milk and ham terrine was delicious!  My dinner companion and I couldnt stop talking about it.\n\nWe both agreed that the cold poached foie gras would probably taste better if it were a warm dish.\n\nThe grilled calamari was addictive! I almost didnt want to share it with my friend.  It paired well with our glasses of white that our lovely server recommended.  I'm such a rookie when it comes to wine.  I have to remind myself that its not about getting sloshed (haha).\n\nI love lamb chops and was glad that it was on the menu.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and there was no gaminess which would be indicative of old meat.  \n\nMy friend had the NY steak.  She offered me a nice portion of her steak but fessed up after the fact that it was only so I would do the same with my lamb chop!  Ugh!!  Conniving b*tch!   Anyway, the steak was ok and funny enough it was the portabellos that stood out the most in this dish.\n\nI dont have much of a sweet tooth so our server recommended the orange blossom beignets . Light and airy with nice hint of orange.  The smell reminded me of a winter themed Thomas Kincade print I saw at Walgreens when I was a little kid.

It is an over priced and  not so memorable place to eat,  when there is so many other great places to eat while in San Francisco.\nThis was our first experience at Piperade and we were looking forward for a nice relaxing and tasty meal with a good glass of wine. We end up ordering a couple of appetizers and a bottle of Rioja and we so disappointed we decided to cut our losses and ask for the check.  An overly-salty Serrano-Sheep's milk cheese dish and a rather bland goat-cheese stuffed pepper was our starter. Not bad, just not great and not what we expected from such a well reviewed restaurant. \nThey have an amazing wine list, but when we asked for some guidance, our server went right to the cheapest wine on the list. Why would they do that? We know Cali wines but just wanted some good advice for Spanish wines. They brag everywhere that they have a \"master sommolier,\" but it turns out he doesn't actually work in the restaurant. In the end we paid over $100, left hungry, and went to our neighborhood restaurant for a much better meal.\nMy advice to \"PIPERADE\" if you are so willing to charge the prices that you have in the menu the least you can do is use the best and freshest ingredients and this includes a real olive oil not your Bertoli-esque cooking olive oil mix that you have on the table for the bread ( bread was the best thing on the table) You are in California where you can get the best of the best ingredients.

There is a nice little patio which would be quite lovely to enjoy your meal when the weather is nice, though the opportunity to dine outside comfortably without bundles of layers only occurs in San Francisco two months of the year!

The ingredients came separately which allowed you to season each bite of foie gras to your own liking.  I think I especially enjoy the sweet salty combination and with a little bit of the kick from the black pepper, the combination was quite good.\n- Garlic soup: I just had a spoonful of the soup and I didn't think it was that great!

He even helped out by bring our check to the table.  At a high end restaurant like this, we did not expect such humble actions which are very special.\nWe think the Seafood stew is the best, most flavorful dish we've had so far. I had the lamb which had a perfect crust and was cooked to a nice medium. I believe my boyfriend had the Halibut which was good but not special. The applet tart was delicious last time with the caramel sauce. we tried the beignet which we weren't so fond of though really enjoyed the dry cappucino we had with it. Must say, the beignets I think about over and over are at Epic Roasthouse.\nMust say that the foie grois is gamey so I'd also pass on that next time.\nOverall, really lovely and we would return for the Seafood stew with lots of the yummy warm bread!", "author": "Quan T."}

It was the holiday season, and even on a Thursday night, the dining room was jam-packed with people. \n\nMy companion and I started the meal off with the garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon and egg. It had a savory piquency that was quite memorable. A refreshing, zesty beginning to a great meal.\n\nNext came my pick for my favorite dish of the evening, if not the entire year: Salt-cured cod (bacalao) with lemon creme fraiche, oysters and caviar. Words cannot describe the sensory pleasure this dish brought: The thin cod fillets were fork-soft, flavorful and ice-cold, as were the tender, plump little oysters on top (my favorite part of the dish). I still remember biting through one of those little oysters atop a piece of rustic bread, topped with some of the creme fraiche - absolute heaven.\n\nA close second was the cold poached foie gras with membrillo paste. Personally, I much prefer hot foie gras to cold. Foie is so meltingly tender and succulent when served hot, but when cold, all the fats seize up and what was once tender becomes firm. (Sort of like what happens when you cook a chicken, then refrigerate it, allowing all the fat to become solid as a rubber ball). Still, of course the foie tasted lovely smeared on the crusty bread, particularly paired with the very sweet, complex-tasting membrillo paste. \n\nThe entree was less unusual, but still delicious: I think it was a rare duck tenderloin, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. \n\nIf we had dessert, I can't remember it now; nevertheless, the meal was really one to remember.", "author": "Suzie Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-27", "description": "My friend Tina celebrated her birthday here and I was part of the task force to find a restaurant that could handle a table for 12. Finding a restaurant that's open on a Monday and that can hold such a large group without charging a fixed price is almost impossible. I finally found the perfect restaurant, Piperade. Piperade gets MAJOR props for being so incredibly nice and accommodating. When I first made reservations, it was only going to be a group of 10. When I had to change the reservation to 12 people last minute, they were incredibly flexible. I even asked for a \"nicer\" table since we were celebrating Tina's birthday and they made sure to give us a gorgeous, round table at the center of the restaurant. Piperade is a smaller, intimate restaurant that serves Basque food, influenced by Spanish and French regions.\n\nSo I need to preface this review and mention that I was not feeling well at all during this meal. I was fighting a cold and was super congested. It affected my sense of taste. As a result, I think my food was less flavorful. Nonetheless, there were a couple of standout dishes at Piperade. I loved the calamari \"a la plancha\" and the piperade. The calamari was cooked very well (didn't have a tough, rubbery consistency) and I was loving the slightly tangy sauce on top. I had never had piperade before so I can't vouch for it's authenticity, but I can vouch for its tastiness! Piperade is a vegetarian stew with onions, green peppers and tomatoes and the restaurant topped it with bacon and a poached egg. It reminded me of ratatouille with a spicier kick. Out of all the desserts we tried, my favorite was the apple tart. The crust was flaky and buttery like a puff pastry and the apples and cream/custard were delightful. The caramel on top was the icing on the cake. I didn't want to share.\n\nMy dungeness crab txangurro had a healthy amount of crab in it, but it tasted a little bland. My cod was cooked well, but I kind of wish there was more sauce or a broth to bring the dish all together. The dish almost seemed too simple. The orange blossom beignets failed to impress me too. I'm not a big fan of floral-flavored things (I hate rose water and lavender) so the orange blossom was not my cup of tea. I also wished that the beignets were a little lighter and had a creamy sauce like a creme anglaise to dip it in. Oh man, Grand Marnier creme anglaise would have been a life-changing addition.\n\nOverall, the ambiance was warm and inviting with wooden tables and really comfortable chairs. Seriously, those chairs were a lifesaver because I was feeling so uncomfortable otherwise. I would totally recommend Piperade if you're looking for a restaurant that can handle larger groups. And, parking is easy too! Glad we got to celebrate Tina's birthday in style!\n\nRead more reviews and see lots of photos on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/a-basque-feast-at-piperade/", "author": "Jackie T."}

She also whined about us ordering drinks from the bar (\"I have to make them myself\").  No drinks including water were ever refilled.\n\nFood was very slow:  A one hour lunch took almost two!!

Light and refreshing, full of flavor, so glad they didn't drown the delicate crab in dressing.\n\nMussel Salad: Simple mussels (de-shelled) with frisee and a light vinaigrette, some mini croutons. Good but not mind-blowing. \n\nRock Cod with Spinach: A fillet of rock cod with a little red vinegar sauce on a bed of sauteed spinach, vinegar...a lil too acidic, too much vinegar. Rock cod was cooked well though.\n\nSea Bass, Vanilla Brown Butter Foam?, Brussel Sprouts, Pancetta: Sea bass was cooked perfectly, brussel sprouts were full of flavor and pancetta added nice bite. Maybe a little too much vanilla in the foam/sauce but overall pretty good dish.\n\nDuck Breast, Potatoes: Nice sweet and savory sauce, duck was tender, potatoes simple but flavorful. Very good overall, would have preferred slightly more rare duck but that's just my preference.\n\nLamb Chop: Perfectly cooked, juicy. \n\nTheir desserts were REALLY GOOD, definitely not an afterthought!\n\nFlan: delicious!! Best flan I've ever had...I'm not a huge flan fan and this one blew me away, it was creamy and had a wonderful caramelized sauce.\n\nAlmond Cake- dense, full of almond flavor and a little liquor maybe? Super yummy.\n\nChocolate Cake- rich, dense, fudgy, with a yummy cream on top that tasted more complex than a plain whipped cream..perhaps some marscarpone or creme fraiche.\n\nOrange Blossom Beignets: Though they are known for these, I thought they tasted too perfumey, like when you spray your floral perfume and then accidentally get some of the mist in your mouth :( The texture was good, just too floral.\n\nCheese Course- yummy fig cake, cheeses were all very good especially the manchego.\n\nThere service is awesome, very attentive, quick and friendly, and not uptight. \n\nThe ambiance is wonderful: charming and elegant...something about this place just feels happy and comfortable, and even though it's an upscale dining establishment it doesn't feel stuffy at all.

The service was very attentive and accomadating - they rearranged our entire table so that we could have more room with 9 people instead of 10! \n\nThe food was tasty but a bit overpriced. Among the 10 people of my party, we tried most the main dishes of the menu. For appetizers, the garlic soup and the mushroom pizza tart were the best and most flavorful. The garlic soup wasn't overly garlicy and the mushrooms on the tart were amazing. As for entrees, I had the salmon w/ summer corn. It was pretty straightforward - however the nectarines atop the salmon were a nice surprise. For dessert, the french apple tart w/ caramel was delicious. Small & simple, but a nice close to the meal. Also, the citrus beignets were refreshing and melted in your mouth. They even gave us an extra bowl!\n\nOverall this place was a nice find for a dinner restaurant.

The ambiance of the place is chic yet warm, and the aroma that fills the dining room was simply intoxicating.\nAfter a glass of txakolina at the bar while waiting for the table to be set, we were seated for a memorable feast.\n\nFirst was the cold poached foie gras with blue berry compote. It was beautiful in its simplicity: the crisp toast, the lushness of the foie, and the sweet acidity of the compote blended very well.\n\nThen came the soup. It was unpretentiously called chicken, bacon and white beans soup, which is exactly what it was. But the execution!!!! It's not often that I'd just slurp the broth alone: never mind the bits of smoky bacon and perfectly cooked beans, I was in heaven just with the broth. \n\nThis is one area where so many restaurants fall short: the quality of the stock. Stock is the foundation , and without a proper foundation, no matter how you engineer the edifice, it will fall down. Here, it's bolted directly to the bedrock.\n\nThe main course was duck confit, with lentils. This rustic food with its humble origins deserves loving preparation, and the chef delivers. From the crisp, crusty skin to the melt-in-your-mouth-but-not-falling-apart meat, I was in heaven. It was accompanied by lentils, with more bits of bacon or jamon, pearl onions, and probably a good amount of piment d'espelette that lent distinctive, fruity character. It formed an effective counterpoint .  In short, enjoying the whole dish was like listening to a J.S.Bach fugue.\n\nBeing a fan of aged Spanish wine, I brought my own bottle: good 25 years older than most on the wine list. However, the wine list here is quite extensive, and wines are very carefully chosen to accompany the food without overwhelming the palate. There are some top-shelf stuff like Krug champagne and various vintages of Opus 1, but I found them to be priced very reasonably. I would not hesitate to order any of the wine from their list.\n\nI came away thrilled by the experience. I can't wait to return, and bring more friends to this jewel.", "author": "Anonymous M."}

So, decided to treat a friend to a birthday lunch here yesterday.  Never been disappointed before and they were just as good yesterday.  \n\nI love that it is not in the bustling market or Soma area, making metered parking easy to find.  The calamari appetizer had an intensely flavored dressing.  Beef crudo was yummy with the diced sweet apple and jalapeno kick.  (I think it was missing just a sprinkle of sea salt to enhance the taste and we could've used just a bit more jalapeno. I'm sure they would've provided those if I asked for it, but I didn't want to interrupt the nice conversation I was enjoying with my friend.)  We said we were sharing the halibut and they served it already split onto two plates.  The halibut was the most perfectly cooked fish I have ever had!  It came piping hot, after we took our time sharing the two appetizers.  I don't know how they timed it so perfectly.  It was moist and tender, from the first bite to the last.  If I didn't know that halibut is a deep sea fish and must have traveled some time to get here, I would've thought it to be freshly caught 10 minutes ago.\n\nWhen I made the reservation online, I asked for a nice table for my friend's birthday and we got a window table.  Our server was great and explained everything I asked about.  We ordered the milk chocolate hazelnut cake for dessert.  It came with a candle on top.  That was a nice touch.\n\nThis is my secret special occasion place.  Most people who don't work/live in that part of town doesn't know about this place.  I don't really want to tell others about it.

My husband, our infant daughter and my parents were seated immediately at the only available table as soon as we arrived at the time of our reservation. The service was excellent and they helped allocate space for my daughter's stroller. The food was truly the star of the evening! We were collectively blown away by the repast. We shared a bottle of wine from the basque country as well as appetizers: calamari and cheese selection. I ordered a soup that was so good, we bought the restaurant's cookbook that evening (I just happened to notice it by the hostess in the front of the restaurant) so that I could mimic it back in Montreal (which I did just two nights after arriving home). The garlic soup with rock shrimp was perhaps the best part of my meal - if you go and you love the 'stinking rose' as much as I do, then it is a must! My husband and mother both ordered the duck entr\u00e9e and my father and I both ordered the signature dish, the piperad\u00e9. Everything just sang in our mouths and tummies.

We decided on ordering a few of the Tipiaks and ordered bowls of soup and desert and some cocktails.\n\nTipiaks (small plates) ordered:\nCalamari a la plancha with fennel olive, caper and coriander: whole small calamari grilled, the dish was very pretty but lacked some seasoning. The calamari was cooked perfectly.\n\nPiquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts and golden raisins: very good, balanced flavors, beautiful dish\n\nFois gras with black pepper, salt and pineapple compote: creamy and went well with the pineapple compote\n\nOpen face mushroom pie: crowd favorite of the night. It was scrumptious on a lovely puff pastry with herbs and chantrelles. All three of us loved this dish.\n\nAlso ordered:\nMushroom and leek soup: it was nothing to really write about, again lacked some depth and seasoning.\n\nGarlic soup with rock shrimp, egg, bacon and bread: this was very interesting and very good. Broth like soup that was not overpowering in flavor. There was no skimping on the shirmp or egg or bacon for that matter in this dish. Absolutely recommended.\n\nDessert: Touron mouse cake with roasted almonds: the mousse was light and fluffy and the almonds were candided wtih nice crunch and sweetness. This dish actually reminded us of a bowl of Frosted flakes from a taste aspect. Different. Good.\n\nDrinks:\nCava sparkling wine: yummy\n\nCockails from their cocktail list:\nJasmine infused vodka martini: Very good, like a lemon drop with out the sour and not overly sweet\n\nMargarita:Not impressed, my friend actually didnt finish it and switched over to the Martini\n\nStaff: friendly and attentive.Also had a cab waiting for us by the time our check arrived.\n\nOverall, its a nice quiet atmosphere, romantic setting if  you are looking for a date night.

We did have a late reservation, which may play a role, but we felt that the gentleman server was very short with us, as if he wanted to rush out out of there (the hostess was also very short with us).  Nobody was mean in any way, but we felt that a restaurant at this level would treat its customers with much more care and friendliness.   Additionally we learned later that a friend attempted to get us something special for dessert (phoned in a request earlier), but the server forgot to give it to us.\n\nWe don't think we will be back because of the low level of relationship building by the server and hostess.

Perfection.\n\n- Calamari \"a la plancha\": I'm not even a calamari fan and I liked this dish.  Not breaded and deep fried like the abominations they have everywhere else.  You can really taste the quality of the squid here.\n\n- Marinated mussel salad: Excellent taste to this dish. Especially for seafood lovers.\n\n- Wild mushroom tart: Delicious mix of umami here - all on top of the most buttery, rich crust you'll ever taste.\n\n- Almond and pear tartlet with creme fraiche: The perfect amount of sweetness, with a slightly tart whipped topping.  After a spectacular meal, I just couldn't believe the desserts matched up.\n\n\nJust a skoach from the top:\n\n- Fresh goat's milk cheese and ham terrine: Delicious, rich dish.\n\n- Butter lettuce salad: A little plain compared to the other stunners on the menu, but a nice start with the perfect, crisp acidity.\n\n- Cold poached foie gras with pepper, sea salt and pineapple and vanilla compote: Really nice foie - I just couldn't get down with the vanilla scented fruit.\n\n- Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese: I liked it, but it wasn't anything outstanding.\n\n- Artisanal cheese plate: You all know how much I love cheese, but it's pretty much the same anywhere you go.\n\n- Duck confit: Not a big fan of duck (except the extra crispy, extra fatty kind) so I'm of no help here.\n\nGateau basque: What a way to end a meal.\n\n- Chocolate cake \"amatxi\" with creme fraiche:  So dark and decadent.  And there's that creme fraiche again...\n\nThere were seriously no dishes that I didn't enjoy here.  I'm truly impressed with Piperade.

When we got to the restaurant and took a look around all of the diners were white and middle aged.  The men were dressed in slacks and Khaki's and button down shirts and the women were in cocktail dresses or shirts.  A little stuffy but classy.  So here was what I ordered:\n\nSmall plates:\nPiquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts and golden raisins:  two peppers served warm.  the cheese was super creamy and went well with the sweetness and texture of the raisins.   very enjoyable.\n\nCalamari \"a la plancha\" with fennel, olive caper and coriander salpicon:  a salpicon is a diced mixture of various ingredients.  the calamari was savory and very tender.   i was scooping the salpicon up with the wonderful warm bread that they served...\n\nEntree\nLamb chops with gigante beans: the lamb were cooked to perfection.  I must admit that it was a little salty but that did not stop me from cleaning my plate.\n\nMy friend had the duck dish and he said it was wonderful.\n\nSo the food was delightful and the service is very good.  I must say the restaurant's decor is nice but it didn't give off that trendy vibe.  It semed like kind of place to take your republican parents visiting from the Northeast.

You think you will be paying less but you will actually pay almost full price for everything.

I sopped up the sauce with the crusty, chewy country house bread.\n\nSadly, my garlic soup was a mess.  The predominant taste was salt, with little garlic to be tasted and too few bread crumbs.  The worst part was the egg, which was so overcooked into a rubbery mess.

The ambiance is romantic yet comfortable for a group of kids that came with some grown-ups to celebrate a birthday. A beautiful, tasteful wine bottle chandelier hangs from the ceiling that does not scream \"look at me!\" the way so much restaurant lighting does. The exposed beams and dark wood floor exemplified the aesthetic of the rustic Spanish-Basque menu well.\n\nThe hubby and I decided to chance it and walked it without a reservation on a Saturday night. We were greeted at the door by a very nice hostess who offered us a table, even though she was saving it for a 730p reservation. Having exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes to dine, we didn't dillydally with our decisions. Our server and waitstaff didn't dillydally either as they gave us brisk, concise yet efficient service. \n\nAfter taking our order, the bread, that was absolutely to die for came out. Complimented by the even more impressive olive oil, we had to stop ourselves from eating all the bread. I noticed no salt and pepper were available at the table, which I thought was a gutsy move that showed that Chef Hirigoyen really encouraged his customers to trust his flavoring. WIth no salt or pepper, we were also able to taste the wonderful olive oil in its true, barest state. Wow, I might never put salt in olive oil again.\n\nWe both ordered the garlic soup (on the 7X7 list) to start. The soup was indeed a simple yet complex clear-broth soup. My tastebuds were amazed to find how well seasoned the soup was given it's bare, yet simple home-cooked look. I concluded that I had never had anything like it. My hubby ordered the lamb chops and I had the seafood and shellfish stew.  Both dishes were excellent, well-portioned and presented, and left both of us with exactly enough room for a cup of coffee afterwards.\n\nHowever, the clock read 730p as we both sopped up the last bits of sauce from our dishes with the two pieces of bread we wisely saved. We paid for our dinner and thanked the hostess for her kindness. No dessert but we were glad to have another reason to return as we walked out with warm, happy bellies.", "author": "Dawn L."}

I must've read the menu 10 times through before he told me and made my choice. The soup had rock shrimp, bread and eggs. I dont enjoy shrimps, but i'll eat it. The soup was more salty than garlic-y. There was one spoon where I actually was able to taste the garlic. I found myself dumping a bunch of the free bread into the soup to alleviate the saltiness, and i'm usually pretty good with salty foods. I think if the chef wasnt so heavy handed with the salt, the soup would've been pretty good, on the lighter side. Slightly reminiscent of chinese soup.\n\nAs far as the experience, I dont like being in fancy-smancy restaurants in general. For what it was, service was really nice--they were patient with our party of 18, especially when we were holding the table up for another large party. I felt pretty uncomfortable being there simply because it was obviously I didnt fit into their demographic of upper class diners.\n\nI think I'm too much of a casual eater for this place--I really didnt need someone to unfold my napkin for me.

He was attentive, honest, and he totally put up with our group of 6 girls. You rock! I'd definitely come back again. Everyone's food was delicious and nicely presented. I'll start from the beginning. :)\n\nBread - huge basket full of sliced sourdough (?) bread. The olive oil was full of flavor and really robust. I think I ate 4 slices and sopped up at least 2 TBS of olive oil.\n\nGarlic soup - had very high expectations, as everyone was raving about this soup. It smelled garlicky, but didn't actually taste garlicky. I liked the bits of bacon in it, and thought the shrimp and egg bits were delicious. In itself though, I thought it tasted like wonton soup. Almost all the girls who ordered this put in pepper to taste. Pretty filling though, and still good. Shouldn't have been that hyped though!\n\nRoasted pork - YUM. The meat is quite tender. At first bite though, I did think it was slightly dry. but then I ate another bite with the cabbage, and WOW. My mouth was in heaven. The pickled cabbage was perfectly sweet/sour, and complimented the pork very well. I finished everything. I want more now...\n\nOrange blossom beignets - a very unique spin on beignets! The aroma of orange blossom really came through, but didn't overwhelm the taste buds. I didn't feel like I was eating perfume, so that was an A+. It was quite a delightful treat.\n\nChocolate cake \"amatxi\" - delicious. Great flavor and consistency. Reminded me of the insides of a slightly overcooked molten lava cake...so still dense and moist, but not runny. The creme fraiche that accompanied it paired very well with the rich chocolate cake. The cake disappeared within 4 mins. I got to eat the last bite. i win! :)", "author": "Carol L."}

What of it?\n\nNeedless to say, I rarely eat there cause they charge like $18 dollars for a hard boiled egg.  But when I do decide to throw my money to the wind and my ass to the morbidly obese, the food is fantastic.  \n\nHard day today.  I just polished off a three million dollar salad with pecans, ripe avocado, mandarin orange slices, grilled chicken breast, slices of rich parmesan cheese and a lovely vinaigrette.\n\nIt was hard, but I stayed away from those sneaky snacker Greek Yogurt cups.\n\nSo this one time I walk in to get a snack, and they are out of the little hummus cups that I usually make mouth sex to.  I ask the counter lady when they might get some more.  She says she doesn't know and points me in the direction of the Greek Yogurt Cup.  I am like, sure.  Greek Yogurt.  Whatever.  I'll take it.\n\nI get back to my desk, and sure enough I have been fucked royally.  The Greek Yogurt is the thickest most insanely delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Ever.  It's like eating a whole cup of sour cream. \n\n2.5 seconds later, I need more.  That's right.  I got ANOTHER one.  All the while thinking, \"It's YOGURT! What harm can it possibly do?\", and also giving major props to Zeus or Aphrodite or Chlamydia for sprinkling some their big phat Greek wedding magic into healthy food to make it taste like straight butter covered butter.\n\nYou might have already come to the punch line of this stupid, tedious little story, but I'm blonde, so I'll take you all the way through the painful details.\n\nCut to Casa G****berg about a month later.  No wisdom teeth.  Moms asks me what I want to gum on.\n\nUmmm, greek yogurt of course.  The most amazing, delicious, ridiculous shit ever.\n\nSo she brings it to me.  Sho nuff, it tastes different.  Not as thick.  Not as creamy.  Not as sour cream, buttery.  So I am like, \"WTF?\".   \n\nTurns out what the lunch ladies have been shoveling in my yogurt hole weighs in at about 25 grams of fat and 300 calories per serving.  Can anyone say Big Mac?  Like, I could have been eating fried bananas covered in peanut butter and fudge sauce this WHOLE MOTHER FUCKING TIME?  \n\nSo, I came to work very enraged and wrote a little note for their suggestion box, that went a little something like this:\n\nDear Lunch People, \n\nThe greek yogurt is fantastic.  And why wouldn't it be?  IT'S MADE OF FAT.  CHUNKY, PEARLESCENT, WHITE FAT HARVESTED FROM GREEK BABIES.\n\nYOU SUCK.  I HATE YOU.\n\n- Rachel\n\nPS.

My first experience was more like a 4.5, so I'll knock down to 3.5 and round up.  \n\nAs a person who has had the \"opportunity\" to work in a restaurant as a Server, I have a LOT of patience toward restaurant personnel, BUT I also value good service tremendously.  \n\nWe came for the 2nd time in a one week period to celebrate a great friend's birthday.  We were a group of 9 and we spent a LOT of money, as you can imagine.  Service-wise, the experience was NIGHT and DAY from the previous experience.  Our server hardly seemed to care about how we were doing/ our experience, etc.  Very shocking, especially in this economy.  Lady, there are a thousand people out there who would kill for your job about now... just saying.\n\nI won't say the service was terrible, just negligent.  She seemed pretty nonchalant: water glasses were not refilled.  She never poured wine from the bottle, we had to do so ourselves....  Now, I admit it can be annoying when a waiter seems to practically ram the wine down your throat so that you'll buy more bottles, hence a larger bill, BUT at such a large table, where conversation was flowing, it's not so easy to halt the conversation, yell to the person on the other side to pass the wine... that's when it's useful for the server to step in and assist.  Not once did she refill a wine glass.  As we were waiting for our desserts, we realized that we still had 1/2 a bottle of wine leftover and the lushes in the group (including me of course!) had to start chugging!\n\nI made a BIG mistake and ordered the Rockfish (minus 1 star) -- quite boring and bland.  Basic basic boring white fish served over steamed spinach.  In fact, I think that I enjoyed the spinach more than the fish!  But I'll take 1/2 the blame because the description on the menu wasn't all that... don't know WHAT possessed me to order it, to be honest.\n\nMy husband, however, ordered the Lamb Chop entree (plus multiple stars!!!)  OMG.... that is the winning dish for sure.  Hands down the BEST thing on the menu (besides the beignets, but I'll get into that in a moment).  Super tender, served med-rare, meaty, tasty, YUM!!!  It is served with soft roasted potatoes, soft roasted onion and a mini-lamb sausage as well.  I want to go back right now and get that dish!  LOVE it.\n\nAs for dessert, we had been raving about the beignets all night (since we had enjoyed them just a few days prior).... I SWEAR folks at the tables around us MUST have heard us rave, because as we are going around the table ordering, they RAN OUT!!!!  So, two of us got to order the Beignets but by the time our lovely server got around to my hubby and I, they were all out.  OMG!!!  I could have cried.  We ended up ordering the Flan, which was also delicious.  But we bartered 3/4 of the dish for 1 beignet!!!  It was worth it too....  Oh, by the way, we had to ASK for coffee, aren't they supposed to ask by default?", "author": "Sheila D."}

This time, they asked me to give them a few options for restaurants to choose from that could hold a good amount of people.  Piperade was one of the places I've always wanted to come and I'm glad I did!\n\nBefore even entering the building, there was surprisingly a lot of parking near the area.  That's a plus!  Walked in to a calm, cool environment with a dark, yet chill decor.  There weren't too many people there so it was quiet, which is nice because I could talk to everyone that was there.  They easily accommodated our group of 16ish people.\n\nThey had a small menu, but everything on it looked great!  I decided to go with the Veal which was delicious.  It was very tender and just melted in my mouth.  I'll have to come back to try the other dishes like the duck, and sea bass.  I did get a chance to try some of the garlic soup and rock shrimp.  I liked it, but it didn't really wow me.  It was unique and I could see why it would be on the 7x7 list.

Amanda had a wonderful halibut and IQ's pork tenderloin was moist and perfectly cooked, although I wasn't crazy about the flavor combinations in the pork dish.  \r\n\r\nI especially love the beautiful, warm, intimate dining room.  We did not see the chef making table rounds as other reviewers note, and that may explain the spotty service.  Bar service was friendly and fast, but the table service was cool bordering on frosty.  I have to give extra kudos to the hostess who, having accepted a late reservation with the understanding we'd be at the communal table, nonetheless found a nice corner table for us that made our party of four much more comfortable.  The big square communal table might work for either very large groups or groups of two, but a group of four would find the conversational logistics tough.\r\n\r\nWe will definitely be back.", "author": "Kevin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-20", "description": "Primary disclosure: my girl and I have been cooking Spanish food for many months now - every weekend, twice a weekend. Became slightly obsessed with it, actually. Penelope Casas, I think I love you. I've said, quite seriously, that I could eat in the Spanish style for the rest of my life and never be dissatisfied. It's one of those 'last meal' kind of questions. Last lifetime cuisine? Spanish contends. That noted, I might have reached my Spanish ceiling. With this in mind, we come to Piperade - overall, excellent, exceptional perhaps, but nothing we could not or did not do ourselves. We tried as much as we could and drank Viognier the entire meal long.\n\nWe started with small plates and made our way to one big plate - it was far too much food.\n\nCalamari 'a la plancha' with fennel, olive, caper, and coriander salpicon ($12): Probably my favorite because I find it hard to resist perfectly cooked squid - a touch salty, mind you, but intentionally so and explosively flavored.\n\nHouse cured bacalao with oyster tartare and lemon creme fraiche ($13): Nice, also salty (it's thinly sliced salt cured cod!), but very sound - oysters a nice contrast and the creme fraiche a needed cut against the salt of the bacalao.\n\nGrande white bean salad with boquerones, fresh herbs, and crushed egg ($11): Fantastic, actually. But this is also why I opened with my disclosure. This is a classic Spanish dish. Not much to it if you have the best ingredients - simple simple simple - but miraculous in its simplicity. The Spaniards love egg (and ham), olive oil (it's like oxygen), boquerones are one of my 5 favorite foodstuffs (they change all the time), and the white beans were heirloom-good. If you have never tried heirloom beans, give them a go - they are notable.\n\nPiquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, and golden raisins ($13): Another delicious dish. Spanish food has enlightened me to the divinity of the properly prepared red pepper. Before we started cooking Spanish, red pepper of any sort never appealed to me. Piquillo peppers? Nom nom nom. Stuffed and roasted with goat cheese, pine nuts, and golden raisins? So obvious, right? Indeed. You cannot go wrong. But this is the genius of Spanish cooking my friends.\n\nThinly sliced serrano ham ($16): Quite possibly my favorite foodstuff, ever - I have dirty dreams about serrano ham. I do not know why, I could be mad, but I find serrano significantly superior to prosciutto - deeper, subtler, less salty, more complex, more fulfilling, more luscious - my palate slides softly into an ecstatic delirium. Rightfully, they do nothing to the serrano - I do not like it heated or cooked (it loses its life force). Why is this not my favorite small plate? Well, that's a lot of $ for a small plate of thinly sliced cured ham. So I reward the imagination of the calamari a la plancha - however, if I could take only one to my grave, it's serrano by a mile. And smokes. And wine.\n\nGarlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon, bread, and egg ($9): Easily the most disappointing dish - not bad, not great, just adequate - no rich garlic essence, average little shrimp, bits of so-so bacon, a nice bread cube, an egg-drop kind of egg, and a far too salty broth.\n\nFinally, the big plates all looked interesting but, as noted many times now, we've done a lot of Spanish cooking and wanted something slightly more special. So we went with the Friday night Basque classic. I preferred other Basque classics on the menu, but you only have one choice each night. Which takes us to...\n\n...Albacore 'marmitako' with saffron potato stew ($26): Good. The tuna reminded me why I prefer my tuna on the raw side. Thick tuna muscle, cooked fully, loses flavor, loses the lushness of its fat maybe - and so maybe more olive oil and a pinch of salt would have improved the fish. The saffron potato stew was classically Spanish with julienned red peppers (which I would have preferred skinned) - sound, classic, good. That's about it. We were way too full to finish and boxed it for home. It heated up just fine for lunch. \n\nTo close as I began, if we did not cook so much Spanish food, every dish we had (with the exception of the garlic soup) would have been more impressive - as is, still a sound 4 stars. Service, ambiance, excellent.", "author": "Brski B."}

Being vegetarian, I didn't really want any details but I thought I would pass on his review.\n   Salads had a nice attention to fresh ingredients that made them incredibly tasteful. As for all the entrees at the table on a scale of 1-10 they all scored between a 7-10. Piperade is a great place to enjoy delicious food and wonderful friends.", "author": "Stella N."}

Piperade delivered.\n\nThe highlights for me were the peppers stuffed with goat cheese and the steak.  Sampled some other plates at the table and thought everything was good.  Wine list was solid.\n\nMore than anything, though, it is a good relaxed place.  Good service without being stuffy, pretentious, or annoying.  Interesting location close enough to North Beach to stroll over afterwards but out of the hustle and bustle.  A few bottles of wine into the evening we realized it was past 11.  Left happy, full and relaxed.  Will be back...", "author": "Brad C."}

A few were really good, most were meh, a couple were really not.\n\nThe service was spotty. But, I am not one to begrudge a restaurant on its service. I am there for the food right? All could have been forgiven if not for one fatal mistake.  They messed up their signature dish...the piperade...and when I called the waiter out on it he says \"This is the way we serve it.\" Eww...\n\nOh how the mighty have fallen. Maybe at one point this place deserved to be on Bauer's top 100 restaurants in SF...no longer. We spent close to 200 dollars, and had 1 completely inedible entree, 2-4 boring dishes, and maybe 1-2 truly delicious things. \n\nRecommend: If you insist on going...\n- The mushroom tart was awesome. Extremely tasty flaky crust...a great savory dish.\n- The foie gras was pretty good. It was served with a compote that overpowered the foie gras slightly, but was interesting\n\nAvoid: Oh...so many things...\n- Saffron potatoes (just a cold plate of blah)\n- Mussels on a bread salad (not delicious like the bread salad at Zuni)\n- the piperade (served with a completely cooked poached egg, by a waiter with no shame...hah)\n\nOne final note: most people dining at this place are like 50-70 yrs old...kind of creates a sort of \"Retired Wall Street\" feel.

The hostess thanked us for the call and let us know there would not be a problem.  \n\nUpon arrival we were seated promptly in a window seat.  The restaurant has a warm feeling and my stomach had a very hungry feeling so we got to ordering right away.\n\nSparkling water was brought to our table upon request and we each ordered a glass of rose - delicious, dry, and a gorgeous ruby color.  \n\nWe each ordered the Prix Fixe menu and were not disappointed.  I tacked on the Haricot Vert salad which was delicious and the perfect mix of mint and amazingly fresh flavors.  As a starter it tantalized the palate. My first course was the soup of the day - lentil bean, I believe.  It was hearty and warm, perfect for the all-too-typical freezing San Francisco summer weather outside.  My husband had the green salad.  \n\nWe both ordered the pork which was of the fall-off-the-bone-and-into-our-mouths variety.  This all sat atop a bed of cabbage which was equally enjoyable.\n\nFor dessert my husband had the Gateau and I the Orange Blossom Beignets.  They disappeared shortly after arrival, not surprisingly.  \n\nSince we'd let the restaurant know this was a special occasion (hubby and my last date before the new baby arrives) I believe they surprised us with a sparkling muscat after dinner.  It was so SMOOTH!  I forgot to ask what bottle it was, regretfully.  I guess I'll just have to return!  \n\nWoe is me.  Finding another San Francisco favorite yet seven years too late.

He greeted us, poured our champagne choice, made us feel very welcome.\n\nThe food -- fantabulous.  I'd been dreaming of going here for their sweetbreads alone (alas, this is considered a Basque speciality and is only served Mondays).  The menu is essentially split into categories of small plates and large, with a small selection of sides.  The fries are addicting.  One can't stop.  I love their Baccalao carpaccio with 4 perfect, sea-subtle oysters and creme fraiche.  Gerald Hirigoyen is a genius.\n\nWe had a lovely and gracious server -- Sandra -- who was extremely helpful in recommending a Basque wine. It was perfect for our meal, and very reasonably priced.\n\nAnd then, the coup de grace -- we received a call 3 days later from a staffmember (Anthony) saying that he believed one of our party (my fiance) had left a Canon 17-40mm lens when we dined there Monday!

I spent two weeks eating my way through Spain recently (think seared foie gras pintxos, black pudding, creamy discs of goat cheese, fried calamari sandwiches, deep fried chorizitos, grilled padron peppers, creme catalans topped perfectly charred sugar, arroz negro with seafood, etc.) so the bar was set extremely high. \n\nPiperade is great - on a relatively quiet part of Battery Street, the exposed brick dining room is warm and inviting, service is efficient, and the tapas portions are just right. We tried the grilled calamari in a tangy but savory tomato sauce, bacalao tartare with raw oysters and aioli, garlic soup with shrimp and croutons, and the crabmeat tower with veggies and microgreens. On an SF restaurant scale of 1-10, I give it a 7, which is pretty high considering the quantity and quality of good food in this city.

Fifteen minutes after we ordered they brought out all seven of the dishes at the same time--leaving the table extremely crowded and making it difficult to pace ourselves when eating the food (since several of the dishes started getting cold as they sat there).  Even if the food all took the exact same amount of time to cook, it seemed like a poor decision by our server, the kitchen, or whoever makes those decisions, to not spread it out a little bit.   \n\nIf my review were divided, it would have three stars for service and five for the food and atmosphere.", "author": "Katie S."}

For appetizers, we had dungeness crab (shredded crab meat with basil, chopped peppers, mango) and Piquillos peppers (stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, raisins), which were EXCELLENT.  Full of flavor! Entrees were not as impressive, though - we had chicken (with crushed pistachios on top, and mushrooms on the side) and rockfish laid on spinach bed. Chicken was rather dry.  Fish was very tender, but flavor was nothing special.\n\nI recommend getting a bunch of appetizers to share instead of getting entrees.  Oh, their pomme frites are very good, too.

Piperade has a really nice ambience - check out the cool bottle chandelier in the center of the room, the cozy lighting and the bar that is oh so worth bellying up to. My fellow diner started with a lemon drop martini, perfectly poured and oh so pretty; I opted for a greyhound, stiff but not unreasonably so. \n\nDinner itself was pretty durn tasty. I began with a dungeness crab and mango salad concoction which was superb - appropriately fishy, succulent, not overly rich thanks to the mango's fruity acidity. My buddy opted for whole prawns with garlic, parsley and lemon, which was truly epic in its portion size. There must have been 7 or 8 of the suckers lined up on the plate. I would have been quite happy with those two apps and dessert to be honest. \n\nWe both had fish dishes for mains. I was a little disappointed in mine - I don't recall what kind of fish it was, but it was about the same size as my app, overpowering cumin and served with a vegetable that just didn't do anything for it. My friend had the sea bass, on the other hand, which was pretty wondrous.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the experience was that the waiter actively steered us away from a more expensive wine to a lighter pinot after we had ordered our food, because he felt the wine we'd picked out might overpower the cuisine. I thought that was quite refreshing. \n\nI would definitely dine here again - prices were reasonable and overall the experience was quite pleasant.

I found it to be cooked well, with a slight crust on the outside and a rich flavor throughout, however I felt the portion to be very small for $26, and I found the presentation to be lacking (general mish-mash of beige and white with some afterthought peas thrown on top for whatever reason).  It came with artichokes, which were a decent complement, but also with a slew of runny hazelnut butter sauce and peas (like we ate when we were children), which I felt degraded the meal.  As for the dessert, the caramel custard was perfect, with an excellent portion size and a perfect sweetness without being over-the-top.\n\nENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: THREE STARS (* * *)\nThe restaurant is beautiful and the chandelier made of bottles was rustic without being too kitschy.

When we planned an after work get-together, this seemed like the obvious choice.\n\nWe also wanted to go on a Spanish food hiatus in advance of our trip to Spain (lunch at El Bulli) in August.  This place seemed like it would offer up a great last meal, and they did not disappoint.  I'm more accustomed to tapas, so the bulk of the menu was uncharted territory for me.  Strap in for the post-mortem on our meal.\n\nThe table started with the cold foie gras.  It was served with salt, pepper and a compote of fruit (quince?).  This is a simple but delicious dish that wouldn't be well served by a more complicated preparation.\n\nMy wife had the piperade, a thick soup akin to French Onion Soup, but based on red peppers.   There's also some serrano ham & perfectly poached egg thrown in for good measure, and it is, again, simple but delicious. I had the Thursday special which was a confit of duck leg served over green lentils.  Again, this is a simple dish that is as rich and textured as you would want it to be without obscuring the umami.\n\nThe table also shared an order of fries that I regretted ordering as they were not done to my taste.  They were cut larger than I prefer and rather bland.  We also shared 2 desserts, but they were unremarkable.\n\nThe service was fine - nothing stood out good or bad.  In hindsight, I think that this is probably a very good thing.  The wine list is impressive.  We frequent a number of tapas places in the city and I know most of the reds that are in the rotation.  Piperade didn't have any of the usual suspects and it was fun to get acquainted with something new.\n\nParking is relatively easy on Battery, and if you don't find a spot there's a lot a block away on Embarcadero.", "author": "Michael F."}

I have been here several times and it is the one restaurant in memory that I can say has surpassed my expectations every single time.

Their entrees have always been exceptional- simply prepared and perfect. Our last meal there ended with a superb orange blossom beignet dessert that I've been craving ever since. \n\nI have always been happy with the service. The wait staff probably errs on leaving you alone more than some may be comfortable with, but I'm rather easily irritated by waiters who are constantly asking if I need anything. The decor is rustic and welcoming and exactly the kind of space that makes eating enjoyable.\n\nI will certainly return here again with high expectations.

I had been expecting a foodie's delight, more of a familial cuisine and environment (larger portions, moms, kids, grandmas, etc.), agricultural atmosphere (because Basque people are that way! My family's favorite Basque restaurant was in Chino, CA- cow country!). I wasn't expecting something cheap- a hamburger heaven, or a place with coloring menus for kids, but I was thinking it would be a little different. \n\nPiperade had good food, but the experience was rather unmemorable, and was not the Basque restaurant I had wanted so desperately to replicate in San Francisco.\n\nMy BF has a seafood AND nut allergy and he was limited to 2 items on their menu (other than salad)... who wants to go to a Basque restaurant and eat salad? I got the lamb, he got the steak and fries. (safe and boring, but he had no other choice.) \n\nI'd seen Piperade on \"Check Please Bay Area\" and had been dying to go, and it was awhile before I could get a reservation. In fact, despite our reservation, we ended up standing, waiting. I can comment that that fact was a little awkward because they do not have a foyer or waiting area. They had an extensive wine list, and the place itself was very beautiful with its wooden beams and large windows, but in a location that was out of the way from the hustle of Broadway, but close enough.\n\nThough intimate and refined, I still left a bit disappointed. Piperade is part of a group that also includes Bocadillos, so maybe I should try that before I give up on Basque SF. We'll see.", "author": "Glansande J."}

Dined there last night and while it was good, it has lost some of the edge that put it into the top echelon. First, let's wash the windows. My wife and I sat next to the windows and they had not been cleaned for awhile -- that is always a bad sign.  My lentle soup was luke warm and a relatively small dish for the price. It was good but not as much flavor as I am used to from Piperade -- and it was only warm.  \nThe service was O.K. but not a lot of enthusiasm -- you like that extra effort. The main waiter is good but looks like he is ready to retire -- too  many nights.  The back up waiter was good but had a personality problem. He had a bad habit of looking the other way when he brought something -- as if he wanted to avoid you like the plague or if you had bad breath or something. The main course was good, it was the sauteed serano ham with a poached egg.  Good but for $20, a bit over priced.  The dessert was excellent. The wine from Northern Spain, white, was excellent, but at $45 was one of the lowest priced on the menu -- so the wines are expensive and no deals. \n\nSad part, is we maybe will not return.  Too much competition at better prices. But the truth is we will return because we love this restaurant and have so many great memories.", "author": "Bill L."}

We dressed up for the occasion, and the warm, romantic atmosphere was perfect. We were glad for our reservation but would have been happy to sit at the bar had there been a wait, or on a warmer evening, outside in the comfortable and very inviting sofas in the patio area. Most diners were in elegantly casual attire, others formal, but everyone seemed to be there for a special meal. And that's what we got: excellent, attentive service from a waiter who had a deep knowledge of the wine list and menu, and an imaginative, fresh, beautifully presented dinner. We ordered the seared sea scallop with parsnip pur\u00e9e and shaved apple appetizer as well as the fris\u00e9e salad with goat cheese stuffed piquillo peppers. Three fat and tender scallops were positively popping with flavor, balanced by the cool and tangy apple. We were tempted to order a second, despite the generous portion. The fris\u00e9e salad was equally delicious--the goat cheese melted like butter in the warm vinaigrette, in savory contrast to the crunch of the salad. My husband ordered the Duck Confit over braised green lentils for his entree. He found it rich, and artfully prepared--moist and hearty but delicately flavored. I had the fish special--a black cod over a leek and potato \"stew.\" The fish was light and not overpowered by the leeks--crisply seared on top, flaky beneath, but overall this dish was the least impressive and blandest of our selections. I unfortunately couldn't persuade my husband to try a dessert so after much difficulty deciding, I chose the \"Dark Chocolate Cake Amatxi\".

You can go cram your anti-duck-gullet-cramming bill down someone else's gullet, because mine was full of rich, buttery, seared foie gras. The grapes were a nice touch in lieu of a more traditional fruit accompaniment and the calamari was wonderul -- \"it's like two appetizers in one,\" said S. Three, if you want to count the verjus, which actually sat up and asked us to sop it up with bread.\n\nWe also got the \"bacalao fritters,\" which were my attempt to dull the pain of not seeing a brandade on the menu. Bad idea. Even though bacalao is fun as all get out, it's probably too dry and fibrous to be successfully batter-fried. Or maybe not. It seemed like they were aiming for a hush puppies batter-fried style and I generally don't like hush puppies.\n\nIn terms of main courses, I got the \"pork daube with fall vegetable ragout\": soft, thick chunks of braised pork with vegetables I actually really enjoyed -- they tasted as if they had been stewed along with the pork. Hearty and decidedly unfancy, but I'm always a sucker for braised meats.\n\nBemoaning that we were there on the wrong night for the rabbit special, S. went with that night's special, which was a veal \"stew\" composed of veal that she described as \"like butter,\" served with potatoes and some other mish-mash that I didn't pay much attention to, as I was too busy marvelling at how the veal was so soft and buttery, I literally didn't have to chew it. It was a masticatory revolution.\n\nDessert was a flan-ish custard with a more substantial texture that reminded me of pumpkin pie. Also, a little pile of orange-blossom-flavored beignets. I'm not sure how they did it, but the beignets were so orange-blossomy that I didn't miss the fact that they were served with nothing but a sprinkling of powdered sugar. The only problem was that they got way too soft way too quickly, so we decided that the best thing to do was to stuff the beignets with the custard. Kind of odd, kind of fun, and rather good.", "author": "Chester Y."}

I think it's listed as between pacific and Broadway which through us for a loop so i had to call the restaurant for the address which i explained to the woman who wanted to put me on hold (seriously, i work in customer service, it would have taken 2 seconds to tell me) so I walked the 4 blocks to the restaurant until the hostess was back on the line...didn't need the address anymore, but still...annoying.\n\nOk, so we step in and instantly i felt two things;\n1. i was the youngest the person in the room (I'm nearly 30)\n2. the old white man's republican convention was at La Piperade\n\nMy boyfriend (who is French and doesn't know proper terminology) said it was pretentious...the point is, it was stuffy.\n\nAfter we got the stare down from the hostess who couldn't answer simple questions on the phone, we were seated...\n\nWe had a nice table at the end of the restaurant  near the bathrooms, and kitchen...yay!

Dash a little salt on top and WOW!!\n\nEntrees:\n5 stars for the garlic roasted salmon\n5 stars for the pacific snapper with spinach\n\nboth really great entrees...I had the snapper...it was light and delicious. A warm vinagrette smothered on and around it...really good stuff.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-28", "description": "I went to a wine supplier lunch here yesterday, and it was my first time experiencing Piperade (although I have dined at Bocadillos once before). \n\nI ordered the txangurro crab app to start. It was a composed salad of dungeness crab meat (in a tall cylinder form), with brunoised mango and roasted red pepper around the bottom. I didn't taste much of the alleged basil accompaniment, and I had to repeatedly salt the crab meat as well so I ended up giving away a lot of it to the other diners. I was a bigger fan of everyone else's starters: the warm white bean salad (although I didn't try any of the anchovy or egg accompaniments) and especially the mushroom pie - this was basically a seasonal mushroom tart with creme fraiche. It had the most amazing savory flavor tempered by the creamy goodness - I will be back for that!\n\nMy seafood & shellfish stew entree was just okay. There was a giant head-on prawn, several tentacly (rubbery) baby octopi, a couple scallops, and some thoroughly overcooked fish chunks (salmon? whitefish? not sure). The flavors of the broth also needed to be more developed, and I was looking for a toasted bread slice smeared with romesco or something. I thought it would be a Basque interpretation of cioppino or bouillabaisse, but I was so disappointed. Once again, everyone else's dishes were great. Clearly, I need to order differently next time. The sea bass entree came with some of the best brussels sprouts ever - they were almost blackened and were braised with bacon - plus there was some buttery froth all around the plate. The burger looked a little unwieldy but tasted good, with just the right amount of cheese (Ossau Iraty, a sharp little Basque cheese). I only tried one fry and it was kinda limp, but the spicy ketchup was great on the burger. The duck confit Plat du Jour looked very good as well, nice crispy skin and plated with green lentils, but she didn't want to share.\n\nThe desserts were all-around fantastic though: the traditional Gateau Basque was a little slice of heaven - almond cake served with a cherry compote - and the Rocher dessert is a must-try (although a little hard to eat since it is semi-frozen and there are whole hazelnuts on the top). I would definitely come back to try the orange blossom beignets and the roasted pineapple clafoutis.\n\nI am giving three stars because of the general under-seasoning of my dishes, plus the extremely slow service. Our waitress was a lovely little Basque woman, but we were not on Basque time! It took almost half an hour to get our orders in, and while the food/desserts came rather quickly, espresso/the check/etc did NOT. Our companions had to call their next appt to cancel because we were there for so long. We arrived at 12:30 and left at about 2:45!\n\nGet a more attentive server and the salt shaker in the rotation and I would give 5 stars. Until my next visit...", "author": "Stephanie S."}

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since I've had many an outstanding dinner at Piperade and hopefully last night was just an anomaly (the place was packed and there was a party of 12-14 people so the staff was overtaxed).\n\nWe started with the crab, mango, and pepper salad and the cold-poached foie.  The crab was anemic - severely lacking in flavor and refrigerator cold  (bland and too finely shredded, making the dish texturally boring), accompanied by precise dices of just-ripe mango and overpowering pickled peppers.  The foie was of inferior quality and the terrine was haphazardly made, breaking into pieces when cut into.  The  vanilla-infused compote was its saving grace.\n\nWe then had the duck with sunchokes, onions, and balsamic reduction and the lamb trio (chop, shoulder, and loin).  The duck was our one unadulterated highlight - beautifully cooked and well-accompanied, very mellow and delicious.  \n\nBut the lamb...oh, where to start.  The portion was comically oversized, with easily a pound of protein on the plate.  When I cut into the chop, it was rubbery and grossly overcooked.  Our server was very attentive and considerate in immediately noticing the problem without my prompting and taking the plate back to the kitchen.  She returned just a few minutes later with a new chop.  I wanted to let it rest so the juices got a chance to recirculate and cut into the shoulder to find it dry and below room temperature.  The loin was likewise lukewarm and completely devoid of any lamb flavor, as was the chop.  They were accompanied by mushy and bland gigante beans.  Again, our server really took care of us when I told her it was not to my liking, sending the plate back and removing the charge from the bill, as well as offering another entree free of charge.\n\nI got the seafood stew, with perfectly cooked and delicious clams that had a compelling iodine and brine flavor.  The remaining fish was a bit overcooked and unremarkable.\n\nDesserts were a marked improvement, we got the beignets and the kefir yogurt with asian pear and honey.  The beignets were room temperature and doughy but the flavor was good.  The yogurt, however, was spectacular - tangy and creamy; well accented with the crisp fruit and sweet honey.  The kitchen could have ramped up the presentation though, as the yogurt was simply ladled onto the plate.  A simple piping bag would have greatly enhanced the visual appeal of the dish.\n\nI've had too many stellar meals at Piperade to be seriously bothered by this miss-step and will certainly be back, expecting the greatness that I know chef Hirigoyen can deliver.", "author": "Yan G."}

But, \"Piperade\" is definitely worth taking the time to brag about.  \n\nBasically, this restaurant literally brought me back to my days living in Barcelona, Spain.  The food is not simply \"Spanish\" but Basque food- the Northernest part of Spain that touches the French border and is the culinary center of the world.  The Basque region is where the term \"tapa\" comes from.  I had such an incredible culinary experience there, that I had to try this restaurant as soon as I heard about it.  \n\nThe first impression was the inviting ambience.  Warm colors, romantic lighting, jovial energy.  The second impression was the hospitable chef and owner, who actually met us at the hostess table.

But for lunch, service was unrushed and extremely pleasant. One the table for shared starters was a tartare of bacalao and oysters, a garlic soup, and a French onion soup. The garlic soup was easily the favorite, but I convinced everyone to leave some as I knew I wanted to take some home for a late-night snack. This was all consumed with a Tablas Creek Roussanne which worked quite well.\n\nK chose as his entree lamb chops served with Manchego potato gratin and I opted for rarely-seen veal cheeks with fava beans and cepes. Our guest was dieting and opted for a butter lettuce salad. Both our entrees were astonishingly good but the veal cheeks, undoubtedly a sous vide preparation, melted in the mouth. We had as a second pairing a Guelbenzu blend that consisted of a cab-sauv/tempranillo blend which worked quite well.\n\nBeing a business meeting, more time was needed for negotiations and dessert was ordered... a cheese plate and port for K, a Gateau Basque for me, and our guest (then realizing how great the food was and foregoing the diet) ordered an apple tart. At one point during the discussion, I mentioned in passing to our guest that K and I were experimenting with making cheese but were struggling with finding goat's milk that is not ultra-pasteurized. While clearing plates and overhearing this remark, our server brought a large hunk of goat's milk cheese from Petaluma for us to try. It was a simple gesture, done without largesse and was well-appreciated.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-04", "description": "I have to say, I was disappointed with my overall experience, especially as I work in the area and have been passing by for months and dying to try.  The menu looked fantastic, it's a beautiful venue, and they have a ton of servers on the floor so was excited for a nice experience. Upon arriving, we told our server we were grabbing just a quick, small bite as we had somewhere to be.  Clearly she didn't understand the \"quick\" part as she didn't return for our drink orders for 10 minutes.  We ordered the mussels, a sheeps cheese and ham terrine appetizer and sauteed sole to split.  When we got our first two starters, we were super confused - the mussels were actually a cold salad - and very fishy at that.  I was sad that our server didn't explain that this was actually different than most traditional mussels - at a place as nice as this, I would expect more guidance.  Same went for the terrine - you actually couldn't see the cheese, it was extremely light and in between the superfine ham slices...so really was like a salty ham slice with slight crusting of cheese.  It was good...but again, not at all what I expected and way too salty for me.  Most disappointing was the fact that our server never came back to check on us to ask us how it was.  I would have liked to let her know that it would be helpful to know beforehand as I honestly couldn't eat the salad (too fishy) and would have like to know the other options.  Finally, the sole came, which they split for us and while it was good if I took a bit with all ingredients (garlic and sauteed spinach were divine), the fish itself was, well, fishy.  Again, since runners brought out our dishes and she never came back until the bill, there was no opportunity for feedback to our server, even when the bill came.  It should always be a question in any restaurant about the satisfaction of the taste of the food - so needless to say in such a nice place, she soured the experience for me.  I really want to like this place, but after spending $80 for a meal to my disliking with no question of my satisfaction, I will definitely have to spend my money elsewhere.", "author": "Betsy C."}

My daughter had passed by the restaurant several times on her way to work and wanted to try it so we dropped in on a Thursday evening without reservations.  What a beautiful spot!  People were dining on the patio area.  We were greeted warmly and efficiently, and seated inside the restaurant which is beautiful, warm and inviting.\n\nAs we were seated, we received water and warm, crusty bread.  Service was spectacular.  Our server was very knowledgeable, picked up on the nuances of each of her guests, helped with indecision and was thoroughly effective in her role.  Two out of four of us ordered specialty cocktails and they were delicious.  The other two martinis were perfectly prepared.  We ordered appetizers, salads, soup, and two entrees to share.  One entree was the salmon, and it was heavenly.  The other was a steak dish and, again, out of this world.  We had a garlic soup that was very yummy, but the soup of the day (although I cannot remember what it was) amazed us!  \n\nThe wine list is diverse and interesting, and we were assisted with selecting a Malbec (from Argentina) that was fantastic and extremely reasonably priced.  We followed up with a couple of glasses of Spanish Tempranillo that was superb.\n\nDessert was fantastic as well - we ordered a flourless chocolate cake to share, but our server also brought out a sumptious fruit tart as a bonus.\n\nIt was such a pleasurable experience - fresh ingredients, beautifully prepared, and great ambiance.

The Calamari is the best I've ever had and I loved the pork chops. Both my wife and I thought the food was really good and the desert was excellent. Finally, parking is easy to find on the street. \n\nNegatives: the portions are small. I ordered pork chops and this dish was $28 and I got two very small pork chops, and some vegetables. For $28 I thought they might be a little bit bigger or maybe a third chop. \n\nAlso we ordered wine by the glass since I did not want to drink alot and just wanted one glass. However even though the waiter suggested a good wine, he probably poured me and my wife about 1/5 of a glass.  I felt I got ripped off, it was like paying $11at a wine tasting and getting a small pour of one varietal.

This year we chose to go to Piperade the day after Valentine's. It was scrumptious. It was lovely. We'll go again. \nIt's located in an interesting space on Battery street, and although we sat inside there was a lovely little patio space outside that would be ideal if the weather in SF was cooperative, or if you are bravely bundled (they have patio heaters!)\nThe interior is dimly  but artfully, lit and has the perfect mixture of exposed urban brick and reclaimed wood floor that says \"I'm having a laid back yet swanky dining experience tonight\". \nI started out the evening with the Biarritz cocktail, it's mixture of Jasmine infused vodka, citrus, and a little sugar was refreshing without being cloying. \nSince we were little piglets and literally everything on the menu sounded tasty we opted for two starters and an ala carte main course.\nMr. H started with the Calamari. It was perfection with it's light dousing of vinaigrette and almonds. I got the open faced mushroom pie. scrumptious. Then came Mr. H's garlic soup and for me, the goat cheese and ham terrine. The soup looked almost like a Chinese egg drop soup when it arrived, a slightly clearish broth with recognizable egg and shrimp. But the taste was utterly unlike eggdrop,  deep and redolent of roasted garlic. My terrine was one of the clear winners of the evening. You know how when you were a kid and your mom made the most perfect grilled cheese sandwich in the world and the most perfect part of that perfect sandwich was the small, lacy rim of crispy cheese that had melted and oozed out of its bready home onto the griddle and cooked itself to golden perfection? Well this terrine is a 3\" by 3\" by 1/2\" piece of that married to smoky ham and kissed with a little sherry. By that time I'd moved on to a glass of Tannat and it was perfect with the cheesy goodness, and later with the sweetbreads I ordered. The generous portion was lovingly cooked and tender in it's madeira braise with some carrot and spinach. Mr. H had the Sea Bass which was tasty, tender and juicy.\nWe finished up with a piece of Gateau Basque (it only seemed right!) and apple tart. Both were good, although the Basque and it's side of glacied cherries were the winner for me. I'll definitely be back for the chilled mussel and bread salad and the orange blossom beignets.\nFor a dining experience of that caliber we expected to spend somewhat more than we actually did, so we were more than pleased all around.", "author": "Joyce H."}

Which, if you think about it, is totally impossible.\r\n\r\nOf course, I realize that the authenticity factor is not the only axis upon which food is measured. The other one, of course, is the chichi factor. Cuisine can be completely authentic but still be disregarded by those who consider themselves epicureans simply because it lacks the appropriate chichi-ness. These people are, I would argue, fuckheads. Take, for instance, the Harvard professor I met at a conference in Milwaukee who I overheard say immediately after delivering a keynote address on how academics need to relate better to, respect more, and listen more carefully to, the general NASCAR-loving population of our country in order to have progressive change -- while drinking a martini in the hotel's top-floor martini bar that had a needlessly French name despite it being, you know, in the middle of Milwaukee -- that there are only two \"worthwhile cuisines -- cuisines, period -- in the world: the French, and the Chinese.\"\r\n\r\nObviously, Mr. Harvard Professor -- would-be savior of the palates of the underprivileged -- has never drank a gas station slurpee, eaten samosas sold by a street vendor in a sketchy alley, or devoured fried tortillas covered in cinnamon and sugar and washed them down with a jug of pulque at a country hut outside of Cuernavaca.\r\n\r\nI've been to plenty of Basque restaurants, from tavernas in villages outside of Donostia to completely disgusting steak-houses-in-disguises next to truck stops in the San Joaquin Valley. As far as authenticity, Piperade falls somewhere in between. As far as chichi, well: it tries to bill itself as \"French\" Basque cuisine, when there really isn't much difference between French and Spanish Basque food, since it's a tiny-ass region to begin with; its menu says, \"West Coast Basque\" and we all know that that is a euphemism for \"California Fusion Yuppy Basque\"; they have many items on their menu that include mango; and many of the menu listings include the French name for the dish instead of the Basque name. So, yeah, it's up there.\r\n\r\nChock full o' chichi, I must admit, is not necessarily a bad thing. It resulted in, I'm sure, such a carefully constructed combination of fresh herbs, perfect golden raisins, ridiculously smooth and tangy goat cheese, and their placement inside of a just-ripe-enough piquillo pepper. It resulted in, no doubt, perfectly seared scallops. And, to be sure, it resulted in a fluffy mousse approximation of the oh-so-Spanish turron. In fact, I could have even dealt with a tad more chichi in my \"cod donostia\"  -- the Basque-iest of Basque dishes -- which was completely uninteresting and maybe even a bit overcooked.\r\n\r\nBut despite the inherent snobbishness of their attempt to Frenchify Basque food, Piperade's fusion approach is, in some ways, representative of the only possible solution to the nationalist violence that has plagued the Basque Country for so many years. Basque food is as dear to many Basques as it is to the rest of the world. Old Basque men in berets attend secret Men-only cooking society meetings where they trade -- and guard -- traditional recipes. They will argue that it is the best cuisine in the world, that they invented many French dishes long before the French. However, as important as the preservation of this tiny culture is, too much emphasis on authenticity only creates the kinds of perceptions of difference -- between Basques and Spaniards or French, for instance -- that have fueled both the terrorist organization ETA to commit violence against the Spanish as well as against Basques who do not support its cause and the conservative Spanish government to commit violence against and suspend the civil liberties of many Basques. Yes, I know that the chef at Piperade probably had no political message in mind when he added a slice of mango to a traditional Basque dish. Still, it's as good a place as any to start.", "author": "Ben P."}

Besides the light flickering on and off above our table, it was a completely enjoyable dinner.  The size of the restaurant was perfect - not too small, not too large.  Noise level never got too loud, even as the evening wore on.  Very cool, laissez faire waiter but we never wanted for anything. I'm still thinking about the small plate calamari - so that was the memorable dish of the night for me.  Foie gras - very earthy and strong on the duckiness.  Halibut & duck main dishes were lightly infused with sweet fruit flavors and colors of nectarines and blackberries.  Lovely.  Especially liked the colorful little mini squashes accompanying the halibut.  Besides the foie-gras, the other heavy dish of the night was the potato gratin - heavily decadent but also good if your arteries can take it. Hazelnut rock for dessert was interesting - liked the moussey part better than the rocky part.  As always, it's fun to dine with Curly & Larry.", "author": "Peg S."}

It's not unusual to see him out front, schmoozing with dinners and graciously accepting their deserved compliments. The simple but stunning space, with its wooden beams, bold, colorful paintings, and subdued lighting, is a pleasant setting for the cuisine, a creative blend of his French Basque origins and contemporary California touches. The menu is divided into small and big plates; the former include options like garlic-spiced prawns, warm sheep's-milk cheese-and-ham terrine, white bean salad with eggs, chives, and anchovies, and garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon, bread, and egg. Among the more substantial offerings, all priced below $20 - are piperade (a traditional dish of melted onions, peppers, tomatoes, and garlic) served with sauteed Serrano ham and poached egg, blue nose sea bass with brussel sprouts, and beast of chicken with roasted butternut squash. Each day Monday through Friday, a different Basque specialty - such as sauteed calamari in ink sauce or braised rabbit with prunes - is featured. Orange blossom beignets and kefir cheese yogurt with honey and caramelized nuts are irresistible desserts. Hirigoyen's culinary empire includes Piperade Cafe in Icehouse Alley (between Union  & Green and Sansome & Battery ), with a wide range of high quality take-out soups, salads, sandwiches, pastries, and coffee drinks, and the more informal Bocadillos, a sandwich-soup-and-tapas bar.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

Basque is not French or Spanish, but its own distinct style of food.  We had 2 cocktails (Basquerak and Donostia), and some Voss still water as far as beverages go.  The Basquerak is similar to a Sazarac - not sweet and made with bitters.  I had the Donostia, which is gin based, and also not sweet.  Both of these drinks are very good and strong , but to be savored slowly.   The appetizers (Ttipiak)  are small plates, similar to tapas, so we went for three of them: piquillo peppers,  calamari \"a la Plancha\", and the marinated mussel salad.  All three were outstanding.  For entrees, we had the steamed pacific rockfish with bed of spinach, and the chicken breast, roasted gernika peppers, white beans, and chorizo.  The gernika peppers are mild and very flavorful, and complements the chicken breast and white beans well.  The restaurant feels warm and comfortable, and the service is excellent.

For lack of a better word, they were well \"trained.\"\n\nRegarding prices, I'm not really sure, since it was a business lunch, it looked a bit pricey, but there are affordable entrees on the menu for under $15 and all the appetizers are around $7.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-03", "description": "Piperade is brought to you by chef Gerald Hirigoyen, who also owns nearby Bocadillos.  There aren't many Basque restaurants in the Bay Area, so it's a good thing that Piperade and Bocadillos are here to represent.\n\nFood:  3 stars.  \nThe restaurant has a regular menu and classic Basque dishes served on different nights.  We chose from the regular menu as the restaurant had already run out of the dish of the day (atlantic cod \"porrusalda\").  This would be a running theme throughout the night.  For appetizers, we had the garlic soup, warm sheep's milk cheese, calamari \"a la plancha\" and dungeness crab salad \"txangurro.\"  The garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon, bread and egg was definitely garlicky and too tepid.  The calamari \"a la plancha\" with fennel, olive, caper and coriander salpicon was the least appealing of the appetizers - the texture was good (not too chewy), but there was not enough flavor.  The Dungeness crab salad \"txangurro\" with basil, roaster pepper and mango was also a little on the bland side.  I wonder where they got the crab, considering the recent shortage due to the oil spill... The best dish among the appetizers is the warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine with aged sherry, which was a little salty (probably due to the ham), but REALLLLLY GOOOD.  It's fried and crispy and orrrrgasmic.  Next were the entrees.  Like the cod special, the sea bass was also unavailable.  Fortunately, we had plenty of good things to still choose from.  The piperade, which is a stew similar to ratatouille, but prepared with onion, sweet peppers, and tomatoes sauted in olive oil, was a standout.  It had crispy sauteed Serrano ham and poached egg on top.  The ham totally makes the dish.  We also had the steamed pacific snapper with spinach and crunchy fried garlic vinaigrette.  The ingredients melded well together, but they didn't do a good job of fileting and cleaning the fish, as we found some random small bones and scales in the fish.  The lamb basquaise chop, shoulder and loin with \"zikiro\" vinaigrette was tender and juicy, but just a bit too hearty with the gigante beans that accompanied it - and I do mean gigante.  The savory filet of duck with salsifis, quince and peppercorns was by far the best dish...I'd order it again and again.  Desserts were a bit on the average side.  In keeping with the night's theme, the popular orange blossom beignets were out.  The caramel custard \"koka\" is basically a glorfied name for flan, but not really that spectacular.  The chocolate cake with creme fraiche was just okay.\n \nService:  3 stars.  Although our waiter was really friendly at times, we mostly couldn't understand him - it must have been his Basque accent.  Service seemed slow at times, especially to take our order and to take care of the bill.\n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.  The decor is simple and modern, accented by a huge wine rack chandelier with empty bottles hanging over the largest table (I'm glad it wasn't hanging over my table - hello, earthquake).  To describe the atmosphere as convivial is correct.  My table was practically in the center of the room, and the large parties neighboring both sides of my table were loud and merry (one table was a little on the geeky side, where some guy laughed like Keith Carradine's character from Revenge of the Nerds).  Lining the walls are intimate two-person tables, where most of the patrons appeared undisturbed by the loud people in the middle.  The crowd runs the full gamut from nerds to preppies to cougars and more (yes, all were present that night).\n\nHits:   Filet of duck, piperade, warm sheep's milk cheese, plenty of parking at night.\n\nMisses:  Calamari \"a la plancha\", running out of too many dishes, the revenge of the nerds.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Bocadillos, Iluna Basque", "author": "Keith C."}

The decor is masculine without being overbearing or overly noticable. The staff is friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The proximity to my job is unbeatable. Hoping across the street for an expertly mixed manhattan or a well selected half-bottle of wine (well, you have to make the visit worthwhile don't you?) is so convenient. \nSo this was my second visit. On this visit I had reservations for dinner with a friend. And we seriously needed to catch up. So away we went - yakking up a storm from the moment I walked in the door. So the only negative thing I'm going to say here - the waiter did not seem amused by our rapid-fire conversation. On the contrary he seemed determined to make me feel bad about it. I was not up for that. I ignored him once I realized he was irritated with our lack of attention to him. The service - was fine. Water glasses filled, wine attended to, food explained -  all adequately. Enough about him. I hope he doesn't wait on me next time. \nThe food was delicious. I ordered the piquillo peppers stuffed w/ goat cheese - oozing with melty goat cheese. Fantastic. I ordered a half bottle of a pinot noir for myself - reasonably priced and delicious as well. My companion ordered the calamari \"a la plancha\" - offered me a bite - and thank god for generosity! Another great dish - fresh, refreshing, just the right size. I ordered the New York steak and was extremely pleased. Cooked to perfection - with wonderful gascon fries and caramelized shallots. \nMy first visit a month or so prior - I sat at the bar with a friend. I ordered a manhattan on the rocks. The bartender was so personable - the cocktail was perfection. I really like this bar. We ate at the bar that night and I have to say I will be doing that many more times. \nThis is a beautiful dining experience - worth every penny you may spend. This establishment is seriously devoted to making your experience within its 4 walls worth the effort of the visit. I hope they save a seat at the bar for me......this Wednesday.", "author": "Tom R."}

Not considering the hype, this is a good place with a nice rustic ambiance, feels very warm and inviting, although at times it's down right cold and dark on those dreary winter days. The food is good, but there's certainly inconsistency as another reviewer mentions. Sometimes the same dish is too salty, sometimes not at all. I don't feel the Basque flavors come through the way they should. Perhaps it's our produce? To me, it's more like eating good California cuisine with a Basque theme. What really is 4 stars about this place is the desserts. Their orange blossom beignets are awesome! \nYou can often find the exec chef greeting patrons. In fact you're more likely to see him outside the kitchen than inside. Prices are high, even for lunch, and even if you want a sandwich you have to get extra sides, which are pricey, but very very good (especially the fries). Their MR Williams is a classic Chicken Avocado sandwich which is done really well. \n------\nPiperade to-go is the little to-go window open at lunchtime at Williams Sonoma Corp building. It offers some good lunch options such as sandwiches and soups (they also have Mr Williams here). Their sandwiches are a little cheaper than what you pay in the restaurant, but the quality is also worse, although some would reason that it's still better than getting something for the same price as the deli. It seems they sometimes use the restaurants leftovers for the to-go boxes, especially for the side salad. Once there were fruit flies in the mixed greens that came with the sandwich. Gross. They do have some yummy cookies, yogurt & honey, spring rolls, fancy sodas, available at the to-go window. The line gets really long right at lunch, so get there early.", "author": "B C."}

We were very excited to go, as my husband and friends had a great dining experience at Piperade this past winter.  I wish I could say that I was that lucky.  My experience was nothing short of AWFUL.\n\nI'll begin with the food.  It was okay.  The asparagus salad was tasty, but the flan's consistency was too crumbly and the flavor too sharp for the smoothness of the dressing.  My halibut was fine, but not stellar.  The potatoes gratin were PHENOMENAL.  This was the very best item on the table.  (Hence the 1 star.)\n\nNow I'll write about the service.  It was BY FAR the WORST SERVICE I have ever experienced in my life.  The waiter took 30 minutes to take our order.  He never asked if we wanted wine.  (An obvious up sell that he could have benefited from.)  There was a dirty wine bottle from the previous guests right next to one of my dining companions.  It remained there for the entire meal.  After the food was LITERALLY DROPPED in front of us, we ate.  Most of us felt the food was, \"eh\".  \n\nAfter we were finished with our entrees, the dirty dishes and EMPTY water glasses sat for about 20 minutes.  (Our water glasses were NEVER refilled.)\n\nOur waiter finally DROPPED a few dessert menus.  We were all so frustrated by our experience thus far that we were praying for a delicious dessert to sweeten a pretty bad experience.   Unfortunately, it took our waiter 20 more minutes to ask what we wanted for dessert.  (Still with empty water glasses and dirty cocktail glasses.)  We took a pass on dessert completely.\n\nOne of my dining companions needed to use the restroom...  It was completely FILTHY.  There was actually wet vomit sitting in and around the toilet.\n\nWe left a 10% tip.  I've never done that before.\n\nI doubt I will ever try Piperade again.  It's a shame.

We went on a Wednesday night. Wanted to try for a few years. Dining companion had been there several years ago and still remembered it = must be pretty good.\nDecided on several small plates.  Garlic soup, special of asparagus soup, mussel salad, white bean salad, sheep milk cheese terrine, mushroom pie.  \nThat garlic soup is delicious. Straight up. Reminds me of some kind of Chinese soup. Probably due to egg floating in it. Really garlicky, bacon, egg, and perfectly cooked rock shrimp. Not rubbery at all. How do they do that in a boiling soup? I would order that anywhere over and over again. Did not share it, though that was original plan.\nAsparagus soup. Eh. not my thing. Companion liked it.\nMussel salad- well, i mistakenly thought we were getting steamed mussels. My fault for not reading. Still, it was really good, though seeing mussels out of shell struck me as odd. Didn't stop me from gobbling it up.  White bean salad very tasty. Not a whole lot different than something I'd get at maybe Whole foods. Well, maybe a bit better. Also wiped plate clean.\nMushroom pie kinda disappointed me. Was barely warn, crust not so much that of tart (i.e. shortening and flour), but more like flaky pastry that's toughened or sat around too long. Tasted ok, but not exciting. The Terrine was also not what I anticipated. I thought it would be melted cheese in a casserole, as I'd had at  a few Spanish places. Nope. It's layered cheese and ham that appeared to be pan-fried. I love salt but this was WAY too salty for me. My friend loved it. Thought it was the best thing we had. I enjoyed small bits of it atop the mushroom pie. It was just way too salty (and quite greasy) for me.\nThough we were both really full , especially after eating 2 baskets of bread (did I mention we were hungry?), we still got dessert. From these reviews it seems most are comped a couple glasses of the sparkling dessert wine. We were as well. Very nice, not too sweet but just right. I got the hazelnut chocolate Rocher mousse and he got the caramel custard. Both were very tasty. I prefer chocolate and I like Ferrero Rocher chocolates, so the crust made of what seemed to be melted Rocher was really lovely.\nWe were both stuffed afterwards, and both very happy with dinner.

The brick interior is warm and inviting and the tables are not placed on top of one another, meaning you don't have to listen to the conversation at the next table over. We started the evening off with drinks at the bar, where a friendly French bartender served me up a 'don-OSTIA' as he called it (nunca mejor dicho -- I was definitely feeling it's effects by the time we sat down) -- ginger, juniper, agave and a lemon twist. Very nice and very potent. We started off with the famed stuffed piquillo peppers and though there were only two of them, they did not disappoint. For our main course, I ordered the New York steak and the finac\u00e9e, the duck. The waitress suggested a spot-on Bordeaux to accompany. Both mains were very good, though not outstanding. I preferred the duck and my fianc\u00e9e, the steak (grass is always greener on the other side of the table...), though we both agreed the best part of either dish was the mushrooms that accompanied my steak. Dessert surprisingly stole the show. Rarely, if ever, does something as glorified on Yelp as the orange beigneta has been, live up to the impossible expectations over-zealous yelpers set for it. I must admit, these little doughy puff-balls exceeded even the most hyperbolic reviews. I felt their light orange perfume in my mouth the rest of the evening and woke up this morning thinking about them...My advice, IF they happen to serve these little gems in the morning, would be to check this place out for brunch and get a massive caf\u00e9 creme to accompany a half dozen orange beignetas. In short, we'll be back...soon.", "author": "Matthew Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-17", "description": "My fiance and I had her best friend and best friend's boyfriend up for the weekend and had reservations at Piperade.  After a quick drink at Slanted Door, we cabbed over and were told that we would have a 'short' wait until our table was ready for our 9:30 reservations.  We took a seat at the bar and perused the wine list.  The standard bar drinks were pretty fair, though the pours were kind of weak.  I hate it when a bartender just assumes the left over change is for him and just keeps it.  This is what this place's bartender did.  I would have given it all to him anyways, but they lose half a star for that because the entitlement pisses me off.  \n\nFinally, after 30 minutes, our 'short' wait was over and we were seated (another half star off).  The restaurant was slowly emptying, but we didn't care because we got a delicious Spanish wine and some apps.  The calamari was WAY too acidic, but was still ok.  When the entres came out, we were really excited.  I got the braised pork with figs, and it was among the best food I have had.  The sauce was rich, and the bites of cabbage, fig and tenderloin were ridiculous in the levels of flavor.  My fiance got the chicken.  I usually hate it when she gets chicken because it is just so plain, but they did a great job.  It just melted in my mouth.  The fiance's best friend got the sea bass, and I was really impressed.  I love seafood, but for some reason rarely get it at nice restaurants.  It was perfectly cooked, and had real delicate flavors.  The last dish was a Salmon, and it was just as good as any of the other dishes.  The presentation was a bit lacking compared to the others, but might have been the best balanced taste-wise.\n\nFor desert, we had the chocolate cake.  It was fairly standard and forgettable.  However, for some reason they kept trying to give us the beignets which we didn't order.  We sent them back once, but since they were closing, they just decided to give it to us.  They were sooooo good.  Not New Orleans good, but REALLY good still.\n\nAside from the bartender, the service was average to above average.  Not enthusiastic by any stretch of the imagination, but polite, prompt and wasn't intrusive.  I would definitely recommend this place for semi-romantic dates or group dates.  It is a bit pricey (about $50 each with a bottle of wine, but not included other drinks).", "author": "Daniel M."}

A couple of the items we had were really wonderful while others were just okay.  We started with the cherry tomato tart which was by far the best thing we ate.  It is served warm with a flaky layer of pastry topped with incredibly sweet tomatoes, basil, and garlic.  Sounds so simple but it was really special.  They also split it for us and put it on separate plates which was a nice touch.  We also had the sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine which was layer after layer of salty and crunchy ham and cheese served over a frisee and apple salad.  Might be too salty for some but for a salt lover like me, it was quite delicious.  We then ordered a large plate to share and opted for the halibut.  I think this is where we didn't make the right choice.  While the halibut was good (seemed to be poached with garlic and almonds on top and served over wilted spinach), it didn't \"wow\" and was something that could probably be made fairly easily at home.  For dessert, we had the cornmeal cake with blackberry compote after hearing such great things about it on \"Check, Please\".  This was another mediocre dish and I get the sense that some of their other desserts are really show stealers.  The service was excellent and I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and while some of the dishes didn't live up to my grand expectations, I would definitely return to try some new things (and maybe have that tomato tart again).", "author": "Carrie L."}

I was dining with a party of 8, so we ordered 5-6 txiki (pronounced cheeky and meaning small, as in small portions).  While I'm no expert on Basque cuisine or preparation, I was struck by combinations which sound really awkward but tasted really good (calamari + mint + cantaloupe) and (goat cheese + pistachio+ raisins).  The atmosphere is definitely appropriate for a date or special occasion but formal is not required.  For my entree, I opted for the dish which is the namesake of the place.  Piperade is a nice blen of vegetables (primarily peppers, tomatoes and onions) which is garnished with a poached egg and 2 strips of Serrano ham.

Overall I gave it 3 stars because I am a serious 'foody' and I believe there are other restaurants in the city in this price range that are better. The ambiance is very quaint and romantic. I love the small, intimate atmosphere that is evident as soon as you walk in. The food overall was above average in my opinion with the Piperade, Lamp Chop, Steak and Pork Tenderloin being the big hits at the table. The wine selection was below average with very few California wines being represented on the menu. I understand this is Basque cuisine so the importance of representing European wines is not being understated in this review, but being that we are less than an hour away from Napa/ Sonoma I would have liked to have seen a better selection of local wines. There are very few Wines By the Glass options available. \n\nThe big negatives for all of us were the sea food dishes. Each was very 'fishy' and the Bacalao was the most 'unique' of them all. It's undoubtedly an acquired taste and none of us were too enthused after the first bite. By the same token the Halibut, Red Snapper and Crab salad very similar to the Bacalao in terms of them being rather 'fishy' in smell and taste\n\nThe dessert selections were okay - the Cheese Yogurt is unique and worth a try if you're open to trying a more tart/sour dessert versus your traditional chocolate cake type ending.\n\nThe last comment is that as one of the last tables to finish our meal it was clear the folks at Piperade were ready to see us leave. They 'hovered' for the last 30 minutes of our meal and that was most infuriating.....irritating....and surprising.....\n\nAll in all 3 stars.....for 5 people the tab was around 400 bucks not including tip.....", "author": "Anon Y."}

The service was impeccable and friendly with great wine recommendations; the food was delicious.  The server  was knowledgeable of the different wines as well as the food.

We took out of town guests and they were amazed by the fine service, food, and ambiance.

I used to send friends there just so they could order Autumntinis. They were all the rage! That was back in the day when I lived a life of leisure, leaving the house only to lunch with friends and shop. Those days are over and this working girl has to work, indeed. My money's well spend at Piperade. I love the piquillo peppers, garlic soup, and seared tuna salad. They also make up a mean cheese plate. I am a huge fan of the restaurant's interior and comfortable, mellow vibe. It's a delightful place for lunch or dinner and service is always great. There's no more Autumntini, but the restaurant is pretty wonderful regardless. When tables are hard to come by, the bar is an equally good option and the bartenders are always a delight. And the word Piperade is just so darn fun to say.", "author": "Autumn K."}

I had my 30th birthday party here in January 2003, and the 8 of us took over the square sheepherder's table in the center of the restaurant. Chef Gerald Hirigoyen used to own Fringale, and now along with Bocadillos, serves amazing Basque food at the former Pastis. And plenty of parking on the street too! When we arrived, we hung out at the bar while we waited for our table, and a few us had the sublime Chateau L'Hermitage Costieres de Nimes, an off-dry white with a subtle note of honey that I have not been able to find anywhere else. It's become my favorite wine. Among the 8 of us, we had the ham and sheep's milk cheese terrine, the garlic soup with rock shrimp, the braised seafood stew, the rack of pork, the squid with grapes and foie gras, and the gateau basque. I came back in January 2005 when Piperade participated in Dine About Town. I had a perfect meal, with a cute Slovak waiter. The waiters wear jeans here, and that can prove to be a bonus. :) But come for the food, everything else is just extra. Love this place!", "author": "Hao L."}

So I found Piperade on Battery near the Financial District.  Wow!  Piperade is Basque+++.  First of all the location's charming and the interior has a nice unpretentious loft-like feel.  The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful.   Nevertheless, it is the meal that matters most.  To start I had an amazing warm cheese and ham dish that was so good I ordered a second round.  It was warm, mild sheep's milk cheese accented with ham and aged sherry.  At this point I was in an absolute feeding frenzy.  For a main dish I enjoyed steamed snapper with spinach.  This dish had a light background of garlic vinaigrette that pulled the spinach and snapper together into blissfully mellow Basque wonderment.  Lastly I enjoyed three light and warm orange blossom beignets.  The place is great.  Service is somewhat slow but that's what you get in restaurants where preparing great food that makes people happy remains the prime directive.", "author": "Hale J."}

You won't find dishes that you can't pronounce, only great food that you'll want to rave about. Between three people we split the mixed baby lettuce, the thinly sliced serrano ham, the artisan foie gras, the white and green asparagus, the lamb chops, and chocolate cake. We weren't sure if it'd be enough for us, but you knew that it was after the last bite of the dessert was devoured. However, the service wasn't that great. You won't have difficulty getting what you want when you want it, you'll just get it with a bit of attitude from the snooty waiters and the icy hostess. They just perpetuate the ridiculous French maitre'd stereotype, which normally isn't true, so just take them with a grain of grey salt. It's tucked away at the end of Battery street, intersecting at Green, so you'll almost miss it if you're not paying attention. All in all a romantic little restaurant worth checking out.", "author": "Jenny R."}

The restaurant is lovely and the staff is attentive and courteous but I found both my appetizer and my entree under seasoned and lacking in depth of flavor. I started with the garlic soup which I had expected to be more creamy but was actually somewhat similar to the egg drop soup you get at Chinese restaurants. It had some bland rock shrimp in it and really the overwhelming taste was salty. I could see what they were going for in the soup though and it was disappointing to me that it didn't quite come together. For my entree I had the piperade which was also good but was hampered by the fact that it was served to me way too hot and again the overwhelming flavor profile was salt. I didn't taste enough of the vegetables and it felt like they had not been allowed to cook enough to develop the flavors and let them meld together into something wonderful. I'm really bummed about my less than stellar experience but am willing to give Piperade another shot.", "author": "Cathy T."}

I wish they would re-inject the menu with Basque pride again; it added a dimension to the experience to see dishes spelled out in their native language.  The atmosphere at Piperade is warm, inviting, and elegantly rustic and the service is attentive and friendly.  The food is usually impeccably executed, but sometimes inconsistent.  One time I had very excellent sauteed sweetbreads and beef cheek daube, and on another visit, I had an overly salted terrine with serrano ham and the rabbit entree was too salty too.  I like the modular menu that allows you to order many small plates to get a breadth of Basque cookery or go for a more standard appetizer-entree sequence.  If you are comfortable with variety meats, the sweetbreads in various incarnations is highly recommended.", "author": "maiko h."}

The food I sampled here was superb. I came away satisfied with a curiosity of how I could recreate the dishes rather than the feeling that I could have done the same, if not better. \n\n- Bread - generous Acme? whole wheat sourdough levain w. excellent olive oil. \n- Appetizer - Cold poached foie gras w. quince compote - accompanied by a sprinkled streak of sea salt & ground pepper; served w. thin toasted wheat bread. The sweet-tart quince (texture of applesauce) and crunchiness of the salt paired w. the fatty duck wonderfully. The waiter automatically split our appetizer into 2 portions without prompting. Very good, silky, smooth, the flavor of duck was delicate, not the least bit strong.\n- Seared duck breast w. sunchokes, cippolini & huckleberry sauce - Wow. incredible. Thick duck medallions perfectly medium rare came w. its crispy skin. Surprisingly the tart huckleberry sauce accompanied it so well. The sunchokes (jerusalem artichokes / potato like tubers) were thin shaved and stirfried until crispy. More assertive flavor than potato, I kept digging under my duck to unearth more sunchokes. Wonderfully harmonious dish. The only dissent came from the fresh italian parsley sprinkled over the chokes & onions, green flavor was a bit overpowering. \n- Lamb chops w. potato confit, fennel & some sort of relish - lamb came in thick portions, also very well cooked, great flavor. I appreciated the deviation from typical rosemary or mint seasonings. This one used a light cumin seasoning. great lamb. The potatoes were well-cooked, perhaps needed a bit more salt (i'm not a huge fan of potatoes), fennel was braised, not much flavoring beyond its own slight licorice taste, a little bland. \n- Dessert - Orange blossom beignets - very light, airy, almost like a soft choux batter. Moist inside, well dusted w. powdered sugar (dough was not too sweet). Also not particularly drawn to orange blossom essence but this was not overwhelming.\n- Coffee - flavorful, not bitter. excellently paired w. dessert\n\nBar manager was extremely rude & put-offish. Waiter was nice, attentive, and professional. \n\nFriday night w. reservations, the place was packed.\nThe dining area is an unusual angular shaped open space with wooden floors and warm lighting. There's a nifty recycled wine bottle chandelier centerpiece over a large round family table. \n\nIn summary: \nVery good food, well prepared. Different from the conventional French style of preparation or Spanish flavors. I'm interested in trying a fish dish sometime.", "author": "A. T."}

Going into entrees, since we normally don't have meat at the house, the NY steak was WOW. med-rare, perfect, caramelized shallots, scrumptious. everyone got a little piece and raved about it. For the table we got the side of fries, which had to have been deep fried in beef fat, you seriously couldn't get enough! And to the even MORE amazing parts of dinner...DESSERT. *insert drool here*. we needed to try alot, so we ordered eight different ones and just shared. too much to write every single one, but hands down, my favorite ended up being the Gateau Basque with cherry preserve! i tasted heaven and it was great.", "author": "Abigail W."}

I didn't like our waiter much - he seemed to have an attitude and not once, did he ever offer to refill my husband's soda. We even put the empty glass right at the edge of the table - still didn't get the hint. There's an asian guy who serves the bread and brings out the dishes; don't think he speaks english. got our entrees mixed up, and he came by once to take away dishes, and as was clearing the table i asked him for some fresh black pepper. He just started walking away so i said excuse me! He turned to look at me and continued walking away. i thought he would call our waiter over, but didn't. so i had to flag our waiter for fresh black pepper. He came over, did some turns and rapidly walked away, as if i had really inconvenienced him. He didn't bother to even ask my mom and husband if they would like any.

There were only one or two things on the prix fixe menu that were actually on the regular menu so I can't really comment on the standard menu items - what we had was ok.  Apps were a salad with truffle vinaigrette that didn't taste at all like truffles but was fairly tasty anyway, and chestnut and celery root soup that was pretty good, mostly because it had a ton of heavy cream in it I think.  For our main course we had steak that was pretty standard and lamb chops that were the same. The standout of the whole night was definitely the flourless chocolate torte for dessert.

Now I'm not familiar with Basque food but I'm always willing to try a new cuisine. The resturant is located in the 1000 block of Battery which in the evening offers lots of free parking close by so that was definately a plus. The resturant is set in what looks like an old factory - with it's old unreinforced brick masonary look giving it an old world feel.  When we were seated for our 7:30 reservation the place was crowded, and , like another reviewer mentioned, not a lot of young people under 30 there.  Our waiter was very helpful and the wine list was truly impressive.  The small dishes were superb.  We ordered the Garlic Soup which I found to be delicious, but then again I love garlic.  My companion was not so enthused with it. The heirloom tomato, herbs, and watermelon dish was a feast for the taste buds and definatley a must here as was the braised calimari in tomato sauce.  In fact according to a friend that dines here often, you can't go wrong with any of the small dishes.  Our dining experience went south, however, when I ordered the Basque Special which was Duck.with lentils and mango I believe.  The lentils and friuity sauce was wonderful but it couldn't save the bird which was so over cooked that I've had ducks that have been hanging in the windows of Chinatown for a week that were more tender and moist.  The leg and thigh portion was so dry and tastless and was helped little by the fruity sauce. I guess it was my bad that I didn't return it but I tried to struggle on with the dish.  On the other hand the Angus beef with carmalized onions was incredible. The deserts were only so so as well as the flan I had was rather ordinary.  Outside the washroom, which was as hot as a sauna, framed clippings and magazine covers heralding  this resturant. lined the walls.  My trip here was just a little less enthusiastic. Our waiter, it should be mentioned,  was attentive throughout and if I ever go back here I would stick to small dishes exclusively as I saw others at the surrounding tables do.", "author": "Nick C."}
