My French toast seemed like it was going to be a hit, as the first piece was delicious! Perfect blend of cinnamon, cooked great- slightly crispy but still soft in the middle. The second piece was undercooked- doughy. \n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly small with tables cafeteria style so you're most likely going to eat elbow to elbow with someone, unless you get a window seat- during busy hours, seating is assigned. \n\nOur walk to this area that the restaurant is located in was absolutely awful (we were coming from union square) the homeless population is flooding the street, a man was literally craping on the street about .1 mile from the restaurant, urine everywhere- over flow of trash and had to walk on the street to avoid walking thru a homeless encampment that lined the sidewalk.

The pool of oil made it seem like they just fried the garlic in oil and poured both the garlic AND the oil over the fries... Therefore too much oil. The other sandwich had turkey, melted cheese, and a cranberry sauce. It was good except I wasn't aware that it was super spicy!!

We all got our food to go as we had to catch a tour group not too long after. I would say that eating one of their large breakfast entrees while on the go was not a good idea on our part, but despite the large mess that my food had become whilst being transported in a cardboard container, I just didn't think my food (veggie scramble) was too good.

However, the wait was minimal compared to some other more popular locations, and the food was good enough. \n\nI honestly forget what day of the week it was, but the line was kind of out the door. But keep in mind that the place is kind of small, so even if the line is out the door, the wait isn't too bad. Homeskillet is one of those places where you take a table marker and someone brings your food out to you, but everything else is self-service. So after ordering a coffee and the Tortilla Sunrise (breakfast burrito) with chicken apple sausage, my friend and I managed to find some seating by the window.\n\nThe coffee was okay, but can't really compete with some of the great coffeeshops around the city. The burrito was better than I expected. It was bigger than I expected! Extremely filling. The dish originally comes with a side of homeskillet hash, but I opted for the salad (which I pretend like cancels out the oozing cheese and sour cream in the burrito). Just get the hash. The salad was drenched in dressing, and I couldn't finish it... Honestly, I'd return to Homeskillet to order that burrito again. I've had better breakfast burritos, but I've also had much worse. \n\nI'd recommend giving it a shot if you don't feel like waiting at the more popular breakfast locations in the city.", "author": "Haley B."}

So, when you attempt to brunch at Dottie's and find out that the rumors are true -- a line out the door at 7am, a 90 minute wait --\u00a0you can happily skip on over to Homeskillet for some similarly hearty egg & carb therapy. \n\nIt goes like this: you order at the counter, find a spot in the surprisingly-not-crowded dining room, with big windows facing Market & 6th (now that's some people watching!), and wait for your food. \n\nThe brunch menu has cheeky names like \"99 problems\" (beef scramble), \"California Love\" (avocado & sausage scramble), and \"Hashtag\" (hasbrowns, veggies, cheese & eggs). Our egg dishes were A-OK, but the brioche French toast was vastly disappointing: not custardy at all, just egg-coated bread. There's almost nothing that disappoints me more than a dry piece of French toast! The flavor should come built-in, not from drenching it in syrup. \n\nDon't opt for the side salad with your eggs - it's just a pile of greens scantily topped with dressing. The homeskillet hash is worthy of the hype. \n\nThough brunch was just fine, the lunch menu looked a lot more promising: gourmet burgers and fancy sandos.", "author": "Nique F."}

Pearl's Deluxe Burgers tried to make a go of it for a couple of years, but I'm guessing the swarm of mouthy derelicts was at odds with paying customers who would prefer eating their burgers in peace. I know I was harassed and didn't feel a compelling reason to come back. Other operations on Sixth Street like Dottie's True Blue Cafe and Split Pea Seduction appear to be surviving, so maybe Homeskillet has a shot here since they have a similar spot a few blocks down in Little Griddle. I guess it depends how far Twitterland really goes into the mid-Market area. it still strikes me as a dicey proposition.\n\nI had been wanting to try Homeskillet for breakfast but never could get my cajones inflated enough to get there early enough on a weekend morning. When owner John Chow decided to stay open to 9PM for dinner (quite a risk taker, isn't he?), I gave it a go on the way home. What they serve is their extensive burger selection and a carryover of their lunch menu of specialty sandwiches (photo: http://bit.ly/1kFoUgC). Having a faint recollection of the wet and sloppy burger I had at Little Griddle once, I decided to try instead the $8 Oldskool, which was a pastrami sandwich kicked up a notch by peperoncini, sauerkraut and stone ground mustard. It just got a little too rich for my taste with the sourdough toast slathered in butter and the triple layer of cheese: creamy havarti, cheddar and pepperjack (photo: http://bit.ly/1kFoWF4).\n\nExcess is usually not a problem for me, but a nicer balance of flavors would have increased my satisfaction level, especially with passers-by on Sixth staring at me intently like I was giving away free iPhones. I have to admit what I did like a lot were the fries, which were on the shoestring side and not as oily as I was expecting. They were easy to eat by massive handfuls with little fuss. The interior is a bit perplexing as it felt like kitschy Americana after a rummage sale with tables organized in a crowded arrangement except for the ones next to the window (photo: http://bit.ly/1qnlDKw). The larger community tables appear to work for legions of lost foreign tourists searching desperately for the cable car but for solo diners like me, not so much. Given the servers were quite nice and accommodating, I'll likely come back for another late-night bite.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...heavy-duty sandwiches that are a bit on overkill but with fries that are right on target\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...a bit confusing inside coupled with the sketchy 'ambiance' outside\nSERVICE - 4 stars...they keep a stiff upper lip in here given the cast of characters they must face all day long\nTOTAL - 3 stars...with a little sustainable luck, Homeskillet may have a shot here", "author": "Ed U."}

Great quality ingredients. The hash browns were also perfectly fried, and were excellently complemented by the hollandaise that dripped over the eggs.\n\nThe French Toast was good too, though a far cry from amazing; definitely more homely than lavish. The bread was a bit thin and less substantial than one would expect given the price. ($7.50 just for the toast, an additional $4 for the fruit/pecan toppings and whipped cream.) Being a self-proclaimed French Toast expert, I'd recommend sticking to the egg dishes, or perhaps venturing into the pancake zone. As an aside, some of their plates have this San Franciscanly pretentious hole on the side. When I went, they happened to have put the whipped cream right next to the hole, so it tragically dripped out and onto the table as I ate.\n\nThe coffee is bold and highly recommended. ($3, self-service and refillable, several varieties.)\n\nOverall, though perhaps not quite strong enough to stack up to some of the more well-known (and consequently, heavily customer-barraged) breakfast/bruncheries in town, Homeskillet has a strong case for itself as being an alternative to spending your entire morning in line.\n\nRecommended Dish: Chorizo Eggs Benedict + Coffee", "author": "Derek K."}

Come to find out that apparently we are not allowed to eat inside because 4 of our 9 girls ordered to go instead of for here. So they literally refused to let us sit inside. They legitimately kicked us out. And very rudely I might add. One of the girls said that we \"made her manager angry.\" Oh really? That's funny because your manager should be the one out here trying to resolve the issue. What kind of manager just sits in the back & lets their employees yell at customers? We asked if we can change our orders from to go to for here and they said no. No attempt at all to accommodate us in any way. And did I mention how rude all the employees were? Bunch of bitchy girls.\nSecondly, the food was terrible. Everything was bland and we all ordered a variety of items off the menu. No one enjoyed their food.

However, we were very happy that we came here instead. I'm not very familiar with San Francisco, but I don't think it's in a great area, as there were a large amount of homeless folks outside and around the area. \n\nThis is the kind of place where you order at a counter, get a number, and then a waiter/host brings the food out to your table. I didn't thoroughly analyze the menu, but it definitely seemed like they had a wide selection of items, but most importantly, they had all of the traditional breakfast items (which is definitely up my boyfriend's alley). \n\nAlthough it took us a while (maybe 15-20 min) to get through the line to order, our food came out to us within five minutes or so. Also, all the condiments you could ever want in life are already on the table (yes y'all, that includes sriracha), so you don't really have to flag anyone down.\n\nI had the #hashtag, which was a sort of hash brown scramble (hash browns, cheese, eggs, onions, avocado, sour cream) with your choice of a bagel (various options) or toast on the side. Not only was the portion big enough for me to save half for later, it was only $9! It was also just very good in general. I also had an iced chai latte ($3.50), which was great and tasted like it was made from real ingredients, rather than some sugary mix from a carton.\n\nMy boyfriend got the french toast with bacon and eggs (total of $10 I believe). He absolutely LOVED it. And let me be the first to say, I have taken this man on a tastebud magic carpet ride throughout the East Bay and I usually get a \"this is pretty good\" or \"it's cool\" out of him. But he loved it so much, even pulled the waiter aside to tell him how good the french toast was. \n\nThey also had brunch-like items on the menu, and if I ever come back (which I plan to), I would definitely experiment with the grilled cheese options they have. Honestly, I was tempted to give them 4 stars just because the place is a little small and the homeless issue, but both things are out of their control. It just comes with being in San Francisco. Overall, definitely recommend this place.", "author": "Bryanna D."}

I got orange juice and the original benedict which came with hash browns. The Orange juice was so fresh as if ripe oranges were being squeezed straight into the cup, pulp and all.

For what appears, on the surface, to be an age-worn diner is in fact a very tasty breakfast/brunch spot. The line wasn't too long yesterday (Saturday) morning around 10:30 and moved fast. Their menu had plenty of delicious options from scrambles and french toasts to a variety of other breakfast dishes (although no omelets). Not too big to be overwhelming, nor too small to be restrictive. \n\nI went with the chicken apple sausage scramble, and chose the balsamic greens as a low-carb side instead of the hash browns. When I told her I didn't want any bagel or toast, she didn't charge me the extra $1.50 for the avocado I added to my meal. \n\nI was most impressed by how delicious everything was - the sausage, the peppers, the onions, yum! What a great scramble. And with three cage-free eggs, and a healthy portion of salad, this was a very filling meal and a great deal too! \n\nI would happily return here again and have more of their great food!", "author": "David B."}

Everything was good, though I was slightly alcohol-influenced from the night before, so the food got a little heavy for me half way through.

I said yes if you're going to make it with the toppings in the pancakes, otherwise, I could just move the toppings to the side and eat the plate that was brought out. She said they could do it. She brings the next plate out and all they did was serve me PLAIN pancakes with the eggs & meat they served on the previous plate. I don't understand not mixing the toppings in the batter. I could have brought my own banana, sliced it, and sprinkled pecans on top for that lol! I could have just eaten the first plate because the pancakes lacked flavor and the rest of my meal was now cold. I ate a couple of bites, then I was over it. I left still hungry and had to go elsewhere to purchase a meal.", "author": "Meagan M."}

But don't let that dissuade you from popping over. If you're in line at Dotties, starving and regretting standing there, try this place instead. The breakfast items are an upscale, fresh, and non-processed version of Denny's. Very tasty and service is quick. The line was out the door when we arrived but the kitchen is very quick, so table turnover is quite speedy. \n\nI ordered the traditional bacon, eggs, hash and toast. The bacon could be a little crispier but it had excellent flavor. Eggs were cooked perfectly sunny side up. Hash could be a little crispier... Mash the hash on the griddle, cover it with a flatiron so it gets a good crisp. And the toast was good! The coffee options are great! The mocha Java is my favorite.\n\nOverall, I give this place 5 stars because you can't beat the value for the area! We will be back!", "author": "Travis S."}

I also got the chicken sausage on the side, which was alright. Not really any healthy options that sounded appetizing.

My friend and I were walking by on a dreary Friday and saw lights on and people inside.  We knocked, and a nice older gentleman let us in and said it was the soft opening - meaning free lunch!  \n\nI had the 99 problems - ground beef, onions, hashbrowns, sour cream, and cheese - and it was delicious!  My first bite of beef was perfection.  The meat was super flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  They nicely accommodated my request to add spinach to the dish.  \n\nMy friend had the bacon avocado burger, and it came on a nice, fluffy brioche bun.  All the fixin's were very fresh, and her bacon was a hearty, thick slab that stuck out of the burger.  You could tell the chips alongside had just been fried and cut from real potatoes.  This burger totally outshines the old Pearl's burger, which by the end was not so good.\n\nI saw they're pouring Equator coffee, which is one of my favorites.  In mid-Market, there's either okay donut shop coffee or super fancy coffee (Blue Bottle or Machine).  Equator is a nice, well-balanced everyday cup of joe for the non-coffee snob, who doesn't necessarily want hit or miss donut shop coffee.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-19", "description": "I live nearby Homeskillet and I like to support the local businesses but this place is not doing it for me at all.\n\nThe service is really poor. I'm not playing the race card here but when I walk up to the counter to order, I expect to be greeted, not to be looked at and then have the white guy at the register turn around without saying a word. I can understand slow or sloppy service if they were busy but there was a very small crowd there.\n\nNext, when I order a burger, the first question the server should have asked when they take the order is how I want it prepared. I had to tell him that since he didn't ask, I wanted it well-done. This is after I paid.\n\nMy food order was to go. I saw a sign about the bag fee charge which I was fine with since he didn't ask and he knew my order was to go I thought he just tacked it on. I was mistaken.\n\nWhen the food arrived I was handed a bag with the fries in it and a greasy box which had the burger in it (not a good sign that it was greasy). I had to ask for a bag because I was not going to walk home juggling food in my neighborhood.\n\nNow the \"good part\"... the actual food. I start eating the fries and I notice a mushroom had fallen on top (no big deal) but then a third way through the fries I noticed they had dropped lettuce and chunks of onions in the bag... what's with the sloppy service??? I'm not a fan of onion-flavored fries (yes, the flavor leeched out.)\n\nThen the burger... by the amounts of mayonnaise in it, it could have been called the 25% mayo burger. It's very unappealing to scrape off the gobs of mayo from the burger. Given the way the lettuce and onion on the burger were just thrown on, I could now understand how lettuce and onion ended up in the fries. Very sloppy presentation. The burger taste itself not even at the level of mediocrity. I probably could have gotten something better from fast food.\n\nI understand 6th/Market is not the most ideal spot but slop food and slop service are not going to cut it.", "author": "Alex P."}

I was not unhappy with the dish I ate \nalthough I did ask for a refund of the difference in price ($1.50).\nThis was not a matter of the server bringing me someone else's order, this was a problem created by the order taker not being familiar with the menu and placing an order for the wrong item.\n\nI'll eat at Homeskillet again and I anticipate another good meal.

We ordered a hashtag ( vegetarian) and eggs Benedict , it was odd that when we paid, it was requested we leave a tip, before even sitting or getting our food, we didn't know how the service would be so I found it weird. You have to try to get a table on your own and you also pour your own coffee( which I guess is good , because you get free refills). Once we got the food, it looked really good and tasty ( we were really hungry too) the food was good, but I ordered a vegetarian meal and found meat towards the end ( in the hash brown) I was so disgusted I just had a feeling I had eaten meat without realizing and it wiped out how good the food looked at the beginning and I started feeling sick!
