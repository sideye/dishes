Used to stop by for lunch prior to heading over to Candlestick for the 49ers game. Now that they moved, I have a little further of a commute. Place is fully decorated with sport artifacts from signed jerseys to autographed photos of players.\n\nI describe their turkey sandwich as the Mona Lisa of sandwiches. Simple yet elegant. The bread that is probably made in house as described by reviewers has the perfect crunch. Turkey is thinly sliced and just melts when you bite into it. Also, comes with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and mayo. After the sandwich is toasted, they add on their house dressing, which taste like a tangy vinaigrette to complete the perfectly classic turkey sandwich.", "author": "Ronald M."}

It's a tiny place and when my husband put this place on our itinerary I thought it was a museum or something, but this is way way better. \n\nTiny hole in the wall with maybe 5 tables max, most of them 2 seaters, this is not the place for a large party. We waited in line and though it took a while I realized it's because they keep it in the oven for so long that it heats up all the way through. \n\nWe ordered a super sized pastrami sandwich with avocado with onions on half and they nailed it. The bread was super fresh, crunchy and chewy in all the right spots, the pastrami was not crazy salty and was dripping fat due to aforementioned oven time. \n\nOperationally it's not the best since there's basically 2 lines, the line to the left is to order your sandwich and then you get out of that line go into a second line to the right to pay and then you wait wherever you can to get your actual food.

They use their secret sauce which I think is just Italian dressing but adds a nice tart flavor to the sandwich. The bread is also toasted to create the perfect crunch when you bite in. \n\nWhat's nice is they offer different sandwich sizes. You can get a mini, center or super. I usually order the center which is just enough for me but if you plan on sharing for two might as well order the super. \n\nI recommend ordering online. There can be a long wait during lunch hours and you can save yourself some wait time.

I got super size on both sandwich roast beef and avocado ,pastrami and Swiss. I also paid extra $2 for extra meat on the pastrami which I'm not sure if he gave it to me even though I did ask him again to confirm. In addition to the sandwich I got two drinks, two chips and a whole $1.50 pickle. Total came up to be $37 dollars. \n\nTotally not worth it. The Sandwich for a super size is so small for the price I paid. Just check the picture of the so call extra pastrami meat sandwich. Even Louie's, Ike's, Roxie,etc. has more meat without paying extra $2 for meat. The bread didn't wow me either and everything comes with basic lettuce, onion and tomato. Honestly I should give it 2 star than 3star but the pastrami meat was pretty good with flavor. The sandwich reminds me of Safeway sandwich so it's decent you can get anywhere even a corner store. Service is nothing wow but they were busy and it is a fast food Togo place so can't expect too much. \n\nAnyway... would I come back? Probably not.

If you're not familiar with the area - this street is literally a few buildings long so park on nearby street or in the lot (metered) across the way. \n\nIt's a very small shop with a giant sign saying \"gourmet sandwiches\" out front. I believe there are  6 or 7 small tables inside.  This is the ONLY seating.  If when you walk in there is an open table - GRAB IT!  Or you will be eating in your car as we did. \n\nWhen we entered, the first table has an employee sitting at one of the few 4 tops with her phone and salad she brought from from home. \n\nWe ordered the \"center\" or medium sized pastrami that everyone raves about and one of the \"gourmet\" sandwiches-  roast beef, avocado and cucumber.  The  avocado and cucumber IS the gourmet difference.  :( \n\nIt took 10 minutes to make them, by this time a line of people came and it reaches the door.  Locals knew to grab tables and did.  The staff member continued to leisurely eat her salad and play on her phone instead of making it available to a paying customer.  Lost a star for this - poor customer service \n\nSANDWICH REVIEW:\n\nBoth of us agree the bread was delicious.  It's a soft center that has a nice toast crust when they warm it in the oven.  The \"center\" size was a decent sized sandwich equivalent to the size at Safeway.  The toasty bread makes a mess - no biggie but be prepared. \n\nPastrami was well seasoned and shaved.  One side of the bread is French's plain yellow mustard. 1.5 slices of generic provolone cheese,  handful of shredded iceberg lettuce, 4 tomato slices and a big scoop of mayo on the bread.   Before closing it - the secret sauce is Italian salad dressing in a squeeze bottle which they drench the lettuce in. \n\nSandwich was good - wished it had more meat and less dressing.  Defiantly made a mess while eating.  It was a decent sandwich. \n\nWife has the \"Gourmet Roast Beef\" -\nSame fixings except she has three thin slices of avocado and cucumber - which they forgot or didn't have because it wasn't there. It was good - not gourmet and the Italian dressing was a bit much. \n\n2 sandwiches and a small soda $22.\n\nOverall,  would we come back?  If we were in the area and didn't want to try and find something else - then yes.   Would get the pastrami and go light on dressing.  Wife would do turkey or something else. \n\nIt's better than Safeway because of the bread.  But if you've had Ike's or mikes sourdough - they are better.", "author": "marc j."}

My sister was in town and we happened to be in our old childhood neighborhood of west portal.  Of course we've gotta stop at the nostalgic submarine sandwich shop our mom used to take us to after getting off the Muni. The place looks almost identical inside as it did when we were kids with that huge wooden menu and the bread on the wall.\n  We were pretty excited to see that the deli had a 4.5 avg on yelp after all these years and that our memories did not deceive us of what we thought a good sandwich tasted like from when we were kids.  It must the the combination of the crusty bread, yellow mustard, fresh chopped lettuce and their special sauce that set them apart.  The sauce isn't your typical oil and vinegar, theres a little something extra in it, mustard? Herbs? Idk.\n  We ordered the turkey and pastrami 7\" sandwich as a snack, as there were many food destinations that weekend.

We ordered using Yelp's Eat24 service so when we arrived at 12:10pm, we just needed to walk to the right side of the sandwich shop to pick up orders. I like that there are two lines - one line for ordering (left side) and the other line for order pick ups. Submarine Center is right next to the West Portal metro station so it makes commuting here from work easy! The sandwich shop is not that huge (several tables), but the walls are aligned with sports memorabilia from the 49ers to the Giants and even the Warriors. Very cool to see if you're a sports fanatic.\n\nFor the sandwiches, they come in 3 sizes - Mini ($6.20), Center ($7.70), and Super ($9.75). If you can eat a lot, the Super is the one for you. I ordered the Super for my Meatball Sub and after finishing, I was bloated. I think the Center would have satisfied my hunger and I would have been content with the Center. All sandwiches come with mustard, mayo, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and their secret sauce. We brought back the sandwiches to work to eat (10-15 mins) and it does have a decent weight to it. However my bread for the meatball sub was a bit burnt on top, but nothing too bad - still edible! My meatball sub was drenched with red sauce which is good, but it didn't seem to pair well with the mustard and onions. Also the meatballs were a bit bland in flavor - it simply tasted like the red sauce. I'd prefer the meatballs to be more seasoned and more flavorful. I would add cheese (extra money) to the sandwich if you're thinking of ordering a meatball sub. Otherwise I think I'd order a different sandwich here. I remember ordering the Hot Pastrami Sub (Super) the previous time I came here and that sandwich definitely tasted better and was not burnt at all. I also wish this sandwich shop had Dutch Crunch as an option for bread.\n\nOverall a decent price value for what you get. The Super is pretty good size for the sandwiches and you don't need to wait long if you order ahead. Plus with the walls filled with sports memorabilia, this sandwich shop is pretty cool.

I was looking for a sub in particular, good meat, shredded lettuce (a must), soft bread, and a tasty vinegary sauce....Well Sub Center caught my eye, and after reading the reviews and looking at all the pics, I was hooked. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon, and I ventured out to West Portal. Snagged a parking in front, (sometimes I just get lucky). There were only a few customers there when I arrived, but that soon changed.\nI could not decide, so I chose the Atomic, a little bit of the best....Corned Beef, Hot Pastrami, Turkey, jalapenos, oh and cheese, a must. He toasted it to perfection, then mustard, mayo, lettuce, onions and that delightful drizzle. No tomatoes, not a fan. By the time I paid and was ready to go, the place was filling up! Everyone greeting each other, obviously family owned and serving a happy community. I made my way back to Pacifica where I enjoyed my perfectly prepared sammy. It was exactly what I wanted, and it really hit the spot. \nAs I said, I don't often get a craving for a sandwich, and I have had my share, however, this place is the real deal, out of my way but totally worth it!!!", "author": "D.

There's something special about their magical pastrami, fresh veggies, and whatever dressing they add onto the fresh lettuce. I usually get the Turkey, Pastrami, and Swiss. The Pastrami, swiss, and avocado is also really really good! \n\nWhat they do is add on your meat and cheese onto the bread, put it into the salamander for toasting, then add on the rest of your toppings and the dressing, cut it in half, and serve it up! Grab yourself an Orangina or Martinelli's and you're set to have one amazing meal! It's pretty small in there, so hop in line and pay attention. Those guys are quick!

Pretty damn easy and cheaper than quite literally anywhere else you'd pay for someone to make it for you. \n\nBut, I bet it wouldn't be as delicious as Submarine Center would make it. The Atomic was awesome! Tons of delicious meat, tons of delicious toppings and it was perfectly toasted. It was so big, I had to go straight Guy Fieri on it; in a slightly bent over position, firm grip on the sandwich with both hands, 3 deep controlled breaths in order to gain a steely look of determination and focus m in my eyes and my mouth open like a python trying to eat an alligator. Yeah, that actually happens a lot in FL and yes, it has literally nothing to do with this review other than to be used as a perfect metaphor. \n\nI also thought it was a great value for the money. \n\nMy pastrami (the word beef is so overused) with this place was that you don't automatically get chips. My body fat says I don't technically need chips but it's a damn sandwich.

Extremely rude to customers, period. The only time they would get their \"act\" together was when you gave them the same negative energy. Interestingly, the owner or another older family member is always watching the register at all times. So there seems to already be an extreme lack of trust.

Along what I think is the most important- the perfect amount of layered meat with delicious sauce to end it all but still not too saucy to make the sandwich soggy. \n\nWhat place has this perfect sandwich? WELL, that would be the Submarine Center sir/madam! \n\nOpened for more than a decade, the Submarine Center is a locally known hole-in-the-wall filled with amazing sandwiches. My go-to sandwich here is the Hot Pastrami. Bread is toasted to a light brown shell that makes a crunch noise every time you bite into it. While biting in, you taste the juiciness of the pastrami mixed in with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The secret sauce makes it all more mouth-watering. Doesn't it make you want your own? And a size 'Super' for under $10? YES...mmm.\n\nEven a delicious place has its downsides. Like every place located in SF, parking is crazy hard and stressful to find. Also, due to the shop size, sometimes there are long lines that can form to the outside of the shop. Not to mention, its right next to West Portal station where its a hot spot for people to go to during lunch rush hours. \n\nNever mind the downsides though because it's all about that sandwich!

It has remained the same over the past 20+ years with the same duo behind the counter making the sandwiches and taking orders.  This is a small shop with ~5 tables that is mainly used for take-out orders.  Sandwiches are available in three sizes, with a number of gourmet sandwiches on the menu.  There is only one bread (toasted) available, an Italian roll (white) which works perfectly for these sandwiches.  There are also pizza subs, meatball sandwiches, sausage sandwiches, and a few options aside from ordering sandwiches with typical deli meat.\n\nI recently went by to order an atomic sandwich and a turkey sandwich.  They were both the right amount of meat, cheese, and lettuce/tomato with the crisp bread that is a great pairing.  The atomic contains three different meats (turkey, corned beef, hot pastrami) along with cheese and jalapenos.  You can taste each meat without any overpowering the others, definitely would recommend - this is also the sandwich featured in Eater SF's list of best SF sandwiches.  The turkey sandwich contains oven roasted turkey - nothing too special, but turkey has always been one of my personal favs for sandwiches.\n\nParking may be difficult, so I would recommend this if you manage to find parking, are waiting for MUNI in the West Portal tunnel, or have a friend to drive you over and pick up.  If you are in the West Portal/Portola area and craving a sandwich, definitely hit up Submarine Center.", "author": "Brian C."}

I have tried most of their sandwiches over the years, but my favorite is and always has been the roast beef with provolone. \n\nThe hot pastrami is also off the hook but you have to eat it there on site while the lettuce and tomato are still cold; if you take it home, the \"hot pastrami\" combined with oven time will make the sandwich so hot that the lettuce and tomato will be warm and taste gross by the time you get it home. Other favorites include \"The Submarine\" (two hams, salami and cheese) The Turkey Avocado and Swiss, and \"The Italiano\" Mortadella, Capicolla, Salami and Provolone. \n\nCall ahead of time for your order and get someone behind the counters eye and wave them down with the \"phone hand gesture\" if you don't want to wait too long when it gets busy. It's very awkward when it's busy and some people are ordering and others are waiting for their orders. \n\nParking at West Portal is a pain in the butt, but there are usually extra spots along Portola if you don't mind parallel parking on a busy avenue and walking up and down the hill on Claremont Blvd. or try the next block up Ulloa street. \n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that if you and a friend each want a \"mini\" and want the same thing, order a \"super\" and split it! it's like two mini's and about three or four dollars less that way. \n\nWhatever you get here, you'll be pleased with their delicious oven toasted sandwiches.

We called in   about 15 minutes ahead of time, so our order wasn't ready when we arrived- luckily, I was able to double park right by the Submarine Center and didn't have to deal with the West Portal traffic. We tried:\n\n-S3/Italiano (Mortadella, Capicolla, Salami, Provolone w/Mustard, Mayo, Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Secret Sauce, $7.45/Center/Medium, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EnoLVES88d-IqZ7RVMo2Mw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the combination of ingredients worked really well in this sandwich! However, the variety of different meats were a bit too much for me (I preferred the simplicity of the hot pastrami), but this is highly recommended for any cured meat lover.\n-S6/Hot Pastrami (w/Mustard, Mayo, Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Secret Sauce, $7.45/Center/Medium, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Xs0_MOHa4sY1UCRAzVOzIg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was my favorite sandwich out of the two. The pastrami had excellent flavor, and was seasoned very well. I could only make it through half the sandwich since I didn't want to fall into food coma. Highly recommended!\n\nOverall, we all enjoyed our sandwiches a lot. I've been to my fair share of highly rated delis/sandwich shops, and the sandwiches from Submarine Center is up there with the best. I definitely want to come back to try their BBQ Beef and a Gourmet Sub sandwich (one with avocado), and will make sure I call way ahead of time to avoid any wait.

With tax, my total shouldve been $6.52. Is it cuz I used a card? But  +$2.28 for using a debit card seems excessive. I asked for a receipt so I could see what the line item charges were but it didn't show. It just said total: $8.80. Perhaps I was mischarged.

I have been going to Submarine Center since I was in middle school (I am graduating grad school now) and I remember walking here after school. Yes, since middle school I have been to many other sandwiches places in the city and yes, I do love Ike's. However, Submarine's Center's appeal is not all the wacky combos it comes up with but its simplicity. It's just fresh ingredients, juicy meats, delicious sauce, on perfectly toasted bread. It is to die for. \n\nI usually get the cheese steak (roast beef with cheese) just because of habit but the pastrami and atomic subs (pastrami and turkey) are really really good. The pastrami is so flavorful. Together with the tomato, lettuce, cheese, mustard, mayonnaise and special sauce (I think it is Italian dressing...) these sandwiches just work. They make the sandwich right when you order and toast the bread, meat, and cheese before putting on the rest of the toppings. This makes the bread so crispy but keeps the lettuces fresh. I have tried the various soups here too and they are quite good. \n\nI swear almost all the workers here are the same as when I was growing up - which is great. That is probably why this place has remained so consistent all these years. When my sister was pregnant she craved this place; whenever my brother comes back home to visit we go here. The lines have gotten long because of how popular this place has been but you it moves fast and you can also call in your order and they will have it ready for you when you arrive. \n\nThe only problem with Submarine Center is that they offer a mini size. Every time I go and decide I will just get a mini to be good I have SO MUCH REGRET. The mini is gone so fast an then I wish I got a bigger size.

Cheese Steak, Super sized, for $9.15. \n\n2) Wait time\nPlacing my order took close to 10 minutes, and receiving my order was almost another 10 minutes. Nothing much to do in here while waiting and it is pretty cramped in terms of space. Keep in mind, after ordering, you have to proceed to another line to the right to pick up your order, so you're gonna stuck inside there and it could get a little hot and possibly stuffy. \nI did not know that we had to move to another line, but it did not seem to matter since I heard them call my order out.\n\n3) The Food\nThe sandwich was absolutely delicious.\nThey really loaded it up with roast beef and the secret sauce was definitely a plus.\nI ordered the super size and definitely felt full after eating it, so it was well worth the $9.\nThe bread/bun was toasted first in the oven and had a very crunchy feeling, almost like a Vietnamese sandwich. (not necessarily a bad thing)\nIt didn't fall apart and drop everywhere like most sandwiches do.\n\nKeep in Mind: \n*It was quite loud in here with all the customers and people dining in.\n*Not necessarily the best place to dine in: quite cramped and people will be standing right next to you when you're eating which might be a little weird.\n*The staff seemed fairly nice and intact, despite having to deal with so many orders all at once.\n*Not the store's fault, but there was one rude man who said \"Excuse Me\" in the most annoyed tone because we didn't move out of the way right after we ordered, even though it was only a few seconds.\n\n*Final Verdict*\nThese sandwiches are great and I definitely see myself coming back here in the future.\nWhy have I not heard of this place before?", "author": "Jeffy Y."}

It's where I discovered my love for meatball subs. It's a family run business. Mom and Dad and the mustached, cute sons. They were very quick, and it felt like the kind of place where you didn't want to mess up the rhythm so you better know what you want once you get up there. They were friendly through the process, yet you don't want to be that person slowing the machine. It's been nearly 20 yrs since my first steps into this spot and it's still the same... minus the mustached sons. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm. I starred in awe of the owners how they have remained the same... just with a few greys. The walls are still covered with the same local 49ers memorabilia and some new local additions. The main thing is that the food is still the same... the process, the taste, the small space and the machine is still pumping it out. I love their fresh cut pickles and cucumbers. I love that they heat up all the sandwiches. I love all of their toppings. They are so busy and constantly refilling it so you really don't get a bad piece. They are the reason why I eat veggies with my meatball sub... I couldn't imagine it any other way now. I dream about eating their sub often, I wish I could say that I go often though I don't but I wish I could. All I know is in 20 years I have relocated many times and many of my favorites have closed their doors, so it's great to see a love remain open. \nTill next time.\n\nps. parking does suck, but suck it up and hunt for a spot... or take the train or bus in.", "author": "Madhu D."}

The problem is the bread was so crunchy that it just ruined the whole sandwich. You can literraly almost cut your mouth eat that thing. I didn't say anything to see if he would actually have the decency to toast another one given that fact this place prides itself in making quality sandwiches.. NOPE. He clearly sees that it was over toasted but I guess I was expecting to much from him. I know this place gets a lot of business, but you know nothing last forever especially when your staff starts  not caring about the quality.  The difference is night and day when the owner makes the sandwiches. You can tell he still makes every sandwich perfectly, from the timing to the layers and amount if each ingredient that goes in.

I searched this city high and low for years (!) for a go-to sub shop, and finally found it right here in West Portal.

If you do then continue reading, if not then please skip this because I don't want to disappoint your non-fairytale life . . .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nYou still with me? GREAT! Lets begin\n\nI actually tried this place out years ago when a friend of mine took me here and told me that he had been coming here since he could walk because he and his family just couldn't get enough of the plce. And so, being the good friend that I was I gave it a try. Surely enough he was right, just by walking into the place you are hit by a wall of toast (not really, just the smell) which made my appetite go into a frenzy mode making me drool uncontrollably. I proceeded by walking towards the counter and asked the Professional Sandwich maker \"How long until I can get my hands on the best sandwich and when can you take my money?\", he replied back with \"have a seat, I got you covered\" It was then that I knew I was in the right place. I ended up with the Hot Pastrami, which was surely the best. Bread is toasted to perfection that makes every bite a crunch. When biting in, you taste the combination of pastrami, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, and their secret sauce. Not only was the combination of ingredients perfect but the right amount per ingredients as well. And to make matters even better, the \"super\" size is under $10!!\n\nOverall, this is what all sandwich shops wish to become, a legacy. The only downside to this place is the parking. Like every place in SF, parking is like finding a needle in a haystack.", "author": "Benson M."}

Because I was in a hurry, I immediately got on the phone and called Submarine Center and ordered my sandwich.  They told me that my order would be ready in 15 minutes, which worked out well for me.  When I arrived, the place was packed -- all the tables were taken, and the line was long.  I thought, \"oh, thank God I ordered my sandwich over the phone.\"  So, I went to the far right and told them that I was picking up my order.  Sure enough, my sandwich was wrapped and bagged waiting for me.\n\nSo, I met up with my friends, who all had brought their own lunches, and I took a bite into my sandwich; it was ATD -- absolutely to die.  The bread was crispy and the right amount of meat and vegetables were added to it.  I couldn't have asked for a better sandwich than what I got at Submarine Center.\n\nAlthough the price point is a little high for their sandwiches, it goes back to the old saying, \"you get what you pay for\"; I most certainly did.  This is definitely a great place for sandwiches, but one thing I must warn you is, if you're in a hurry, or if you're on a time limit for a lunch break, I would highly suggest that you phone in your order.  Otherwise, that line is pretty long, and there is no guarantee that you will be out of there within 15 minutes if you arrive during the lunch hour.

The service was nice although they definitely rushed us. They get pretty busy pretty fast but I think it's because they also work really fast. It's best to know what you want right away and move out of the way once you make the order. You pay later when the sandwich is done toasting (maybe a few minutes).\n\nWe ordered a super size Italiano to share. They customized it for us and had mustard on one side but none on the other (yay for customizing option). I thought the sandwich was good but not great. I couldn't help but think \"I can make this myself.\" My cousin and I were looking for the 'secret sauce' they say they use for every sandwich but we couldn't taste anything.

The secret sauce and crispy bread are just two of the reasons their subs are hard to beat. Thankfully I don't live too far, but they are definitely worth the gas money if you have to drive a distance. They have hot subs, cold, pizza subs and soup. A small selection of chips as well as cold drinks in bottles and on tap. Friendly staff and full tables are what you see when you wait in line in the small place. There is usually a line but somehow I missed the lunch rush today. You can call your order in ahead of your arrival if you want to avoid potential lines or a long wait. My average wait is 7 min and most of that time is my sandwich in the oven reaching maximum crispness. \nThey have toppings such as: hot pastrami, kosher corned beef, turkey, and ham. They also have fresh tomatoes, whole dill pickles, sliced to order with your sub, lettuce,  jalape\u00f1o's, cucumbers and avocado.

Their hot pastrami is a popular item; it's not overly-salty but still flavorful. They don't skimp on the meat, and they give plenty of lettuce and tomatoes as well. But one thing I love about these subs is the bread. When the bread is toasted, it's soft on the inside, and very crispy, light, and flaky on the outside.

Pretty basic, but there's just something about them that puts them above all the rest.  I do love how they stick all of the sandwiches in the oven for a few minutes to get the cheese nice and melted and they bread perfectly toasted.  \n\nI could seriously go on for days about how much I love this place, but I'll refrain from writing an essay about sandwiches.  The place is very small and unsuspecting, but do NOT underestimate it! It's incredible.  It does get busy around lunch and dinner, but it's worth the wait.

The toasty bread, the secret sauce and the hot meat really make the sandwiches tasty. Yes, they are a bit pricy, but at the end of the day, Subway doesn't measure up because of the taste. I will discuss one facet of this sandwich shop though that some of you may find amusing. If you have ever seen the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld then read on.\n\nI have been here three times and every time, the dude with the moustache tends to bust my balls. He asks me rhetorical questions, which I later realize are rhetorical, then we both just start laughing. Anyway, the atmosphere in this place is similar to that of the episode of Seinfeld with regard to these guys knowing they are probably the best sub sandwich shop in SF. Therefore, they behave a particular way and the customers do also because they want a good sandwich and like the Soup Nazi, there are rules. You must know what you want before you approach the sandwich maker or they will get serious with you, but its all in good humor as repetitively, they know they are top notch and probably seen the episode of Seinfeld, so they know they can mess with you LOL.

The place is pretty casual, with many 49ers plaques on the wall and there are a handful of tables. \n\nThe sandwiches come in three sizes.  My boyfriend and I got the super (the largest) and shared. We tried the pastrami (about $8).  I liked that the sandwich bread was toasted in the oven and that it was warm, but the bread itself is really just okay.  I was disappointed with the amount of pastrami on the sandwich (some bites didn't even seem to have any meat) and overall, the sandwich seemed a bit on the salty side (it may have been the overuse of their special sauce).  \n\nThe service was prompt, but not that friendly.  The man helping us didn't say much, he didn't even describe the sauce or ask if we wanted it.  He just held it up to us and looked at us for a nod.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-11", "description": "We all know that pregnancy cravings are intense. I have a particularly humorous story about one of those, but that's not what this review is about. \n\nSee, not everyone realizes that sympathetic pregnancy cravings are a real thing. This is evidenced by the fact that, after buying me a gallon sized package of Goldfish (because I was craving them,) and watching me gobble up a ridiculous amount, he proceeded to polish them off. \"I can't stop eating these!\" he said.\n\nLast night, another sympathetic craving hit. This time, he just had to have a meatball sub. I had desperately craved a deli sandwich several weeks ago, so perhaps this one was just slightly delayed. Unfortunately for him, he didn't get off work till past midnight, so short of making his own, finding one was impossible. I promised I would take him to get a meatball sub the next day, figuring that since he's been so good about my cravings, I could indulge him this once.\n\nI'm pretty sure he would have been relatively content with a meatball sub from Subway or Togo's. However, I decided that if I was taking him out for a sandwich, it was going to be a damn good one.\n\nI've been coming to Submarine Center for upwards of 10 years now. It was *the* place to go in high school on days when classes ended at noon. I don't get to go as often as I'd like, but when I do, it's consistently amazing.\n\nI had been telling my boyfriend about this place pretty much since we started dating. Almost a year later, I finally got to take him. He, of course, ordered a meatball sub with provolone  and extra marinara sauce. I ordered my usual hot pastrami with provolone, tomatoes, and secret sauce.\n\nI always worry when I take someone to try a place that I've recommended. What if they don't like it as much as I thought they would? Thankfully, Submarine Center is always amazing, and my boyfriend loved his sandwich.\n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu over the years, and everything has been delicious, but pastrami is my consistent favorite. It's tender, juicy, flavorful, everything pastrami should be. My boyfriend took a bite of my sandwich, and he said it was so good, it's making him consider ordering pastrami next time. This is coming from a guy who refuses to order anything but a meatball sub at any other sandwich spot. \n\nThere's only one type of bread that they use, but it's absolutely perfect. It has a good \"bite\" to it (not too hard, but not like you're biting into air either) and is toasted nicely. It might sound weird, since it's something so simple, but this bread can really set them apart from other sandwich places. I'm a huge fan of their secret sauce, and I find that it complements the pastrami perfectly.\n\nA lot of people are comparing Submarine Center to Ike's. Personally, I think they attract different audiences. Go to Submarine Center when you want a \"classic\" but really high quality sandwich. Go to Ike's when you want something richer, or a bigger variety of toppings. Ike's would probably be a better option for vegetarians and vegans too. It's really all about what you're looking for.", "author": "Leigh R."}

Even though I love SF's beloved Ike's, I always come here for a nice simple turkey sandwich without any fancy dirty sauce or crazy topping people try to add in these days. Pricing is fair and you get what you ask for. The staff is more focused on getting you your sandwich right and on efficiency since it can get pretty packed during peak hours and with so many guys behind the counter. I know people can complain about how they're not nice enough but honestly, it's not a 5 star restaurant where you expect to get superb service. They're there to make your sandwich good, they don't have time to ask you about your day. I see they move their hands around like crazy working on the sammies! They make Subway employees look like turtles. However, I am always greeted with a nice smile and common courtesy from the employees so no complaints there either.", "author": "Cathy N."}

But in the spirit of sharing, I highly recommend their sandwiches if you're in the neighborhood.  The key to Sub Center's brilliance is the toasting of the sandwich, in an open-faced fashion, to melt the cheese and crisp the french baguette to perfection.  The multi-hamed Classic Submarine is particularly outstanding, as is the Meatball Sub (preferably with melted Provolone), but their sandwich making prowess can make even a mundane Turkey sandwich sing.  Lines can extend beyond the door of the small shop, but they tend to move quickly despite the attention each sandwich gets.  One word of advice: they go big on the onions if you request \"everything\" (which you should), so if you're not thusly inclined, ask them to go easy.  Over the years, parking in West Portal has become pretty tough, so be prepared.  I also noticed that you can also order for pick-up (no delivery, yet) via Eat24.

I love the use of the shredded lettuce over leaf.\n\nMy only criticism, and while I realize I may be in the minority here, is I'm not a fan of the french roll they use.  For me, it's too soft, the crust is too delicate, and it doesn't add much flavor or texture to the overall gastronomic experience.

Although the pastrami sandwich was tasty, the amount of pastrami in the sandwich combined with the pedestrian fillings did not warrant its over-$8 price tag.

I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich while my friend ordered the super atomic. The fact that they have different size options is great too. \n\nMy medium sized (they call it a \"center\") sandwich was seven bucks which isn't too bad. Their special sauce is tasty and I like that they put their sandwiches in the oven to soften the onions and toast the bread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-04", "description": "I have been a loyal fan of this San Franciscan jewel since 2008, and I have never stopped, nor will I want to stop, coming.\n\nWhether this place has the best SANDWICHES in the city - is debatable (even though I will defend that they do until the day I die). But it is unquestionable that they have the best Italian Subs in the city! \n\nPros: You cannot possibly go wrong with anything on their menu - the Original Submarine, the Cheesesteak, the Corned Beef, (The cheesesteak and Corned Beef I have to say are rather mediocre), the Meatball, the Italiano, the Atomic Submarine - but the best thing by far is the Hot Pastrami. They have the BEST Pastrami! It's super well balanced with the crunchiness of the bread that they have delivered from Boudin's every morning. In fact, everything in their sandwich is well balanced - the mayo, the mustard, the cheese, meat, lettuce - I could rant about this for days! \nA couple of other tips are that their tomatoes are deliciously ripe. I have never EVER had a sour tomato in my sandwich. Ever. This was the place that made me start liking tomatoes in all my sandwiches. Also, avocado is always a great addition to any sub sandwich. Their avocados are always buttery sweet and add that extra kick in any of their sandwiches. (Even though they do cost extra!)\n\nAnother thing that people don't know about is that they have this amazing pizza. It's not your normal everyday pizza, nor is it like any pizza you've probably ever tasted before. It's essentially just extremely fresh French bread, with some Marinara sauce, gooey melted cheese, and some pepperoni on top. Some people call it a joke of a pizza, but for me it's absolutely delicious!\n\nCons: Since this place is extremely popular, during lunchtime - especially during the week - they have mass orders and long lines. Make sure you get there before the rush! Also, they have limited seating - only about 3-5 small tables, so don't expect big parties to be seated there.\n\nThis place has always hit the spot.

I'd been craving lip-smackin', finger-lick-it-good sandwiches and Sub Center just didn't  do it. \n\nBread- The bread just  wasn't good enough. It was something reminiscent of some Safeway French bread. Too light and airy, no character. I felt like I was eating some cheap bulk bread from Foods Co. \n\nHot Pastrami- Wasn't impressive. Your standard pastrami. Salty. Hot. Chewy cheese.\n\nSpecial Sauce- Reminds me of Kraft Italian Free Dressing. Salty. Vinegary. Nothing 'special'. Didn't go well with the mayo.\n\nVeggies- Stingy. \n\nService- We watched our Super and Mini subs sit on the counter for 5 minutes before finally having one of the dudes ring 'em up. There weren't that many people when we first came in, but the line grew tremendously shortly after. The guys were all mean. No smiles. Rude, rushed service (Okay.. I know they have to work fast to catch up with all the orders... but COME ON!). Ignorant. \n\nHonestly, this is just another subpar sandwich shop. The quality's similar to a Subway franchise. Exact same veggie toppings, minus the olives, green bell peppers, and pepperoncinis. Way pricier than Subway too. The mini, comparable to a six inch at Subway, was 4.95, but it didn't even fill me up.

Woops! \n\nSo instead of eating that sandwich, we went and ordered another pastrami but this time from Submarine Center since that is the reason I brought her here. We get the sandwich and go off in the car to eat it. OMG! Just as I remember! They do put on a tangy Italian dressing which I think enhances the flavor but my girl didn't like the addition much. The bread is so fresh and so perfectly toasted! Mildly sweet and delicious! Overall it was the best!\n\nWhen I got back home, we still had the other pastrami sandwich and I decided it was time to eat again. I warmed it up and was very unimpressed!

I don't even know how that place stays in business next to Submarine Center. \n\nI drove from Fremont for this place and I would do it again!

Please don't tell my parents. During my senior year, the class right before lunch was history. I would ask to use the restroom 10 minutes before class ended & my teacher was so clueless - he never noticed that I would never come back.

Gooey, melted cheeses with ham & salami, crispy lettuce, juicy ripe tomatoes, crunchy onions, accompanied by a wonderful duet of light mayonnaise and their special vinaigrette -- all on a toasted baguette. Wash that all down with Martinelli's apple juice [everything tastes good with Martinelli's apple juice]  and well, the nerd in me became a rebel during lunchtime.  \n\nActually - I don't even remember what class I had after lunch.

Sandwiches come in 3 sizes, Mini (Appetizer size), Center (looked like 1/2 a normal sandwich), and Super, though Super is not an entire roll (maybe 2/3).\nMy choice was the Super Cheese Steak with everything minus the hot peppers, this ran north of $9-, so not exactly a great value but still, I was here to check it out not to become a life time customer.\nService was fast, prompt, and efficient and the guy that made my sandwich was sort of cute, so points for that. \nGetting back to work and bag in hand it was lunch time.\nMy take on what they made, \nBread was okay, BUT, I prefer a bread crust that does not shatter, and prefer those that have more of a chew. Meat was very good quality, and the toppings resembled a slaw. \nFor me it was okay, but I had some issues.\nNot crazy about the bread, and not sure how I could correct that.\nSandwich needed something acidic, that might have been solved with a splash of oil and vinegar.\nPrice point was not outrageous but also not a huge bargain either, I might return if in the area.", "author": "Joseph A."}

I have been coming to this place since I was in 7th grade, which was 8 years ago and I still love it. This place has never disappointed me.\n\nThis is my favorite sandwich place to go when I am craving a submarine sandwich. I always get something different off the menu and I am never disappointed with the yumminess of the sandwich (I don't think that is even a word). The bread that they use for the sandwich is really good, and it tastes even better when they toast it and make it all crispy, also their special sauce is very good.\n\nIt is close to my house, I am able to call in the orders before I get there so I don't have to wait in line (I recommended everyone do this). I know that it is sometimes very hard to find parking which can be very annoying sometimes but these sandwiches are so worth it. I usually have someone come with me so they can double park while I run in and get the sandwiches. The prices are very reasonable which is good for my budget. \n\nI went here today (12/9/2010) to get myself some lunch and I found parking right out front, and I walked in told them my name, picked out my chips and paid for my food and I was out of there in less than 5 min. Talk about great service. \n\nWhen you call in the orders, the usually say that it will take 10 min but it always takes less and I am always out of there in less than 5 min.\n\nOverall, this place is amazing and I recommend everyone try it at least once, because you are missing out on a great sandwich if you don't. In the 8 years that I have been coming here I have never had one complaint and they have never disappointed me with the quality of their sandwiches and the way that they handle their business.", "author": "Alicja D."}

I hate vinegar so I got the sub without the dressing once and it did not taste as good, so I think the dressing is a MUST.\n\nThey are pros. They make their sandwiches how they're suppose to and every sandwich is made to be taste the best it can. Thus, I do not recommend taking out any ingredients, unless you really really don't like them or you're allergic/intolerant.

The sandwich, on it's own, is fine. \n\nBeing that sandwiches are, for the most part, bread, meat, veggies and condiments (and what seems to be an SF phenomenon, some type of garlic sauce), I find that most places are easily rated against each other. That's where this place falls short.\n\nMeat:\nPastrami was fine. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible. Passable. Turkey ditto.\n\nVeggies:\nOn point, on par with everyone else. Which is to say, lettuce is shredded (for optimal lettuce retention), tomatoes fresh, onions present and not too overpowering. Pickles, peppers. Yeah, they're here. \n\nSauce:\nAdded something, but not to the point where I jumped onto the table Bobby Flay style to proclaim it the king of my taste buds. \n\nBread: \nSomeone said this was dutch crunch? Oh heavens no, this is some generic white roll that is toasted so fully that whatever slight texture this poor bread had to begin with is lost, leaving only a gum scratching vessel. Seriously, the bread was the worst part by far. It is somewhat akin to Quiznos; no chew, no tear, just toast. Sometimes at home, when a loaf of bread reaches the end of its life expectancy, you toast it to mask its loss of character. Seems like that's what happened to this bread. After having Ikes, Luccas, New Daly City Market, Roxies, et al, one word defines this bread: cheap.\n\nPrice: \nAlmost 10 bucks for a super atomic? Keep in mind this large is smaller than Ikes (who also gives you a pack of dirty chips for 10) and the same price for a \"standard\" large sandwich like Luccas ($7-8 for something monstrous).  What's the basis? You give me a smaller sandwich that's like everyone else, on some dimensionless bread, and charge me the same?\n\nGo to Ikes, go to Roxies, go to Luccas. Go here.

I was visiting the area today and needed Yelp to really help me find a good Pastrami sandwich because, well, who doesn't love a good pastrami sandwich?\n\nThis place was super-high rated and I thought I couldn't miss.  Well...\n\nI got in a little early and the place was empty when I came in.  I ordered the large pastrami.  \"With everything?\" I was asked.  Hmmm.  Where I come from pastrami sandwiches come with pickles and mustard.  And maybe cheese.  \n\n\"What's everything?\" \n\nThe (nice) guy behind the counter pointed over to a few items that were available.  Lettuce, tomato and onion.  Jalapenos, mustard and mayo.  Let me give this place the benefit of the doubt.  \"Everything but mayo\" (because God knows mayo should never grace a pastrami sandwich.  And I added provolone.\n\nSome good-looking pastrami was put on the bread with mustard then cheese on top, then the whole thing was put in an over.  A few minutes later, it came out and on went lettuce, tomato and onion.  And Italian (Special Sauce) dressing.\n\nI added a macaroni salad and a coke.  Then sat down to eat.\n\nThe sandwich:  wow, what a disappointment.  First off, no pickles?  Really?  Second, the bread was so crusty I couldn't take a bite without poking my lips and scratching the roof of my mouth.  That would have been fine if there was enough pastrami and if it had really strong flavor.  Which there wasn't.  The condiments overwhelmed it and the pastrami was hardly noticeable.    Hardly the best sandwich I've had.  Subway beats it (though it's been a decade+ since I had a pastrami there and it was awful).\n\nThen there was the \"macaroni\" salad.  Yes, it was technically correct because it had macaroni in it.  But it was TERRIBLE.  It was nowhere near fresh and so gummy and bland it tasted like I was eating glue.  I had about three bites and I tossed it.\n\nThe coke, however, was perfect.\n\nI don't visit the area often but will never return, and I can't imagine there aren't better places around.  It had a nice, neighborhood vibe and everyone was very friendly -- probably why people like this place so much.  Good for them.  And maybe some of the other sandwiches rule.  But the pastrami is not a star here.", "author": "Greg B."}

There are only a few spots in the city that I'd recommend for a good submarine and this is definitely one of them. \n\nThe guys behind the counter are really friendly. Along with the old school decor, they really do give the place a mom and pop feel. The portion sizes are decent, but not overwhelming. I do wish they were a bit larger, but then maybe that's just the Chicagoan in me. None of the ingredients jump out at you as being of superior quality, but they're still tasty and more than adequate.

My favorite part was when the man behind the counter put the subs into the oven for baking. \n\nOver 20 years later I'm still coming to this spot for yummy, healthy, and expertly made subs. Some faves to order include the roast beef sub, the turkey sub, the barbecue beef sub, the Italian combo sub, and the belly bustin' Atomic. \n\nYou're best to step up the counter knowing exactly what you want because the guys that work there are busy and quick. Come during lunch time and they have even less time to spend on you so don't stand there dawdling and gaping at the menu on the wall. If you really can't decide just order the roast beef sub. You'll never go wrong with this classic. \n\nGive yourself extra time to find parking during the busy hours (lunch esp) and be ready to take your sub somewhere else to eat as the tables are often filled. The shop also offers regular sandwiches which are also good, in addition to chips and sodas. If you're short on time after work, pop on over after you get off the L, K, or M at West Portal and bring home a sub for dinner.

While waiting in line for our sandwiches, I admired all of the 49ers paraphernalia strewn around the shop, even if all the stuff was old championship memories.  I'm all for toasted sandwiches, so I was pleasantly surprised when my turkey sub was lightly toasted and perfectly grilled.  As for their \"special sauce,\" I really think it's just Italian dressing, but really delicious nonetheless.  In So Cal, there aren't as many mom-n-pop type sandwich shops like Sub Center, so it was nice to eat a sandwich that wasn't made by a minimum-wage earning teenager at Subway, Quizno's, or Togo.\n\nGrab a friend, take the Muni down to West Portal (parking is really limited and is such a pain the area), enjoy two Sub Center sandwiches with their special sauce, and you're in for a treat.", "author": "Andy P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-13", "description": "This place is a San Francisco institution.  I've been going to this place on and off for over 15 years and my review for this place is long overdue.  Local gem in the St. Francis Woods/West Portal area next to the 76 fuel station.  \n\n\"My name is Stephen J...  and I dunno if they put crack into these sandwiches or what but I've had an addiction to these sandwiches over the years!\"  I wish I could write-off the part of my income that I've dumped into this place.  \n\nI would not exactly say that sandwiches are cheap here either.  On the contrary, I would go further to say that I find the prices here a little unreasonable (my center sized Atomic Sub and Coke drink WITHOUT chips, comes in just under $10.00!).  But like paying for gasoline, I find myself helpless and at the mercy of these prices as I find myself back here often for their addictive sandwiches in the past.  Damn you Submarine Center for being so addictive!  \n\nAs mentioned by other yelpers, it's a narrow and small shop with 4-6 small tables by the entrance.  Parking is usually impossible around here.  If it's your first time, know what you're going to order before stepping up to the counter without holding up the line!  Once you've got your order locked in, step towards the left line, place your order and get out of the way to the line on the right by the chips rack to pay for your said order.  Your order will be called when finished.  Almost unapologetically, I mostly get the center Atomic Submarine w/plenty of meat!  \n\nWhatever these guys have been doing to their Subs they have a clear recipe on what they are doing.  After slicing their fresh sour dough bread, they toast their bread just the right amount with your specified meat and cheese in their mini oven.  About a minute later, heaven and earth comes together when they bring the perfectly toasted bread, meat and melted cheese onto their assembling counter before you by adding crisp shredded lettuce, cool sliced tomatoes with mayo/mustard, their secret Italian dressing sauce and they will ask you whether you'd want oil & vinegar.  The Yin finally comes together with the Yang when they fold the warm/toasted half with the cool/crisp half before slicing this Sub in half width wise and rolling it up onto white butcher paper.  \n\nThis use to be a top lunch spot for me when I use to be in the area.  There is high anticipation when unwrapping that sandwich for the first bite.  That first bite for me is usually unreal as I negotiate for the best angle to work into the sub.  The sandwich gets better with every bite as I work into the sandwich towards the meat and condiments.  With this order, I usually wash my sub down with a Coca-cola drink with crushed ice (cannot be Pepsi w/cubed ice!).  This is my moment of nirvana.  \n\nI know there are many great \"sandwich\" shops in the City and Bay Area but this has to be my all time favorite \"Submarine sandwich\" spot.  Keep in mind I'd like to differentiate a good \"Deli sandwich\" versus a good \"Submarine sandwich.\"  \n\nI'm still looking for other recommendations for spots to try to dethrone this top spot for me (someplace more reasonably priced would be good too!).  I've tried Gene's Liquor on Taraval, Good luck cafe on Kearny and Lucca Italian Deli in Castro Valley.  Not two sandwiches are created equal!  \n\nI remember when they use to have the frequent visitor cards where after 10 visitor stamps you get a free sandwich.  If you think about it, how ridiculous is it to buy $75.00 worth of sandwiches before being rewarded a free sandwich?!?  (I was doing that for years and they still have one of those cards on display on the wall next to the cash register)  They unfortunately, do not take these cards anymore nor credit/debit cards!  They are cash only.  \n\n\"Food-COMA-setting-in!...\"", "author": "Steve J."}

Sub Center has the best subs in the city.  Maybe even country.  I've been coming here since my hooligan days as a teenager when we used to terrorize West Portal and get drunk on Mt. Dave.\n\nThe subs here are worth the line out the door, the lack of seating, the parking gauntlet and all the calories.  I drive all the way across the city to eat here, and I am more than willing to park illegally in the lot across the street and risk a ticket if i cant find street parking to get a sub here.\n\nThe bread is perfect- slightly crunchy yet still soft inside, so the sub doesn't fall apart when you bite into it.  Hot pastrami with provolone is one of the best meals EVER.  The pastrami melts in your mouth - and they have the best quality salami here too. The tuna sandwich is fucking BOMB as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-29", "description": "The shop seems like it's been there for decades, judging from the look of it and the faded pictures (mostly of the 49ers) on the walls.  It's basic-looking and nothing fancy (which is the way a sub shop should be), with a few wooden tables and hanging sausages.  I spied autographs from Bill Murray and Jonathan Winters (plus plenty of 49ers).  They seem like they would know their sandwiches but they probably didn't know about Gene's on Taraval.\n\nThe sandwiches are good but overrated.  Submarine Center's secret sauce tastes of Italian dressing (reminds me of Gene's sauce at Gene's Liquors but Gene's is better).  I had the hot pastrami sub (medium \"center\" sized, $5.70; there are three sandwich sizes to choose from) and it is a fair size but much smaller and also more expensive than Gene's. \n\nThe toasted bread (white roll) was crunchy on the outside but it quickly becomes soggy, so you need to eat your sandwich right away.  It came with mayo, mustard, shredded iceberg lettuce, secret sauce, your choice of cheese, and tomatoes.  I thought there was way too much sauce/dressing on the sandwich. If you like a sandwich that is drowning in condiments, this could be the place for you. The filling was definitely on the skimpy side (compared to most other sandwich shops) though the pastrami was nice and tender.  The price is reasonable but given the lack of fixings, it's not such a bargain. Gene's gives you more veggies (quantity and variety), accepts credit cards, and has a wider selection of beverages (after all, it is a liquor store).  And it's easier to find parking too.\n\nCash only.", "author": "Lolia S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-21", "description": "I just had a hot pastrami sandwich from here about half an hour ago.  I will definitely go back again someday to give it another chance, but honestly, I wasn't all that impressed this time.\n\nI realize it wouldn't be fair to compare this pastrami sandwich to something from NY, especially considering this is not only SF, but West Portal/Sunset.  However, after seeing all the stars and reviews, I guess I expected a little more.\n\nAnyway, I was surprised to see that without asking, they toast their Hot Pastrami sandwiches here, but as if that wasn't bad enough, the bread was way overtoasted and burnt black in the corners.  I peeled off the black parts, but the rest of the bread was kinda tough as well.  The pastrami itself was very dry, although I did give them points for it not being overly spicy like Togo's.  As I was nearing the end of my sandwich, I did come upon a piece of pastrami that hadn't been overtoasted and that one bite actually was pretty decent.\n\nI'm thinking that if I was the kind of person who liked my hot pastrami sandwich loaded to the gills with cheese, vegetables, and every gooey condiment known to mankind and toasted then this place might actually be pretty good.  However, in my book, a real proper NY style hot pastrami should be just pastrami, bread, and mustard...ideally on rye.  Yes, I realize this is more of a sub place, but even then, that's the way I'll order it, without all the extras.\n\nIn general, I've found that when you don't order your sandwich fully loaded with all the options and stick with just the standard equipment, you can actually enjoy and appreciate the quality of pastrami.  All the taste and textures which won't be hidden under everything else.  Who knows, maybe I've just been ruined by my all-time favorite, Carnegie Deli in NY.  Until my first one there (I've been going there for years), I never really knew how good a hot pastrami sandwich could truly be.\n\nI liked how the sandwiches here at the Sub Center come in Small, Center (med), and Super.  I ordered mine in Super and the size was comparable to a Togo's large.  Price for a hot pastrami sandwich by itself without soda or etc was $8.30 which I thought was a little high considering where I was, but okay.  \n\nIn every respect, this place blows Subway out of the water, although that's not necessarily saying much as I really hate Subway.\n\nAlthough I probably went at the worst time which was during the lunch rush today, I wasn't too crazy with their order/pay system either.  After you order, you are mixed in between those trying to order and those trying to pay.  Now it would be great if like most places, you could order and then pay right away (I have no problem if the cashier is different since they are handling money), but here it appeared to be that you first order, then have to wait until your order is ready before you pay.  Not sure if that's their usual system or if today was an anomaly, but that's how it was today and it was so disorganized.  I stood there holding my $10 bill looking silly for the longest time.\n\nI will say though that I did see a mighty impressive meatball sandwich go by and will probably go back to try that next time, but not during the lunch rush.\n\nWho knows...maybe I came on an off day.  I'll be back again someday, but there are so many other sandwich places I'd like to try first.", "author": "Roy N."}

Each of them boasts an undisputed classic, and they're so well-matched for quality it might just come down to whether you prefer your submarine-themed nostalgia from the nuclear 50's or the psychedelic 60's.  The only observation I can make is this: Submarine Center sandwiches are slightly more crusty and oily, whereas Yellow Submarine's are more chewy and creamy, and hence slightly more to my taste.  Also, sadly I can no longer order their signature \"Atomic\" sub, as it's filled with beef.  But the classic submarine, with two \"splendid\" hams and salami, is a good, er, sub-stitute.  \n\nOf course, watching the highly choreographed sandwich-making dance behind the counter is well worth the price of admission alone, particularly at the 12:30 rush when the line of hungry and oft-burly patrons is going out the door.  And it's all presided over by that handsome gentleman who vaguely resembles a mustached Cary Grant.  Classy all the way.", "author": "Wes M."}

I like that they stick your sandwich in the oven to warm them up and melt the cheese. A warmed sandwich always tastes much better. \n\nI liked my roast beef. The bread was fresh. The lettuce/tomatoes were added after it was taken out of the oven so it didn't get soggy or warm with the rest of the sandwich. The BF ate his warm pastrami quite happily too.

The mayonnaise I think is the key to these sandwiches, because although they indeed use the freshest vegetables, that's what truly brings out the flavor of every ingredient in the sandwich. Their meat looks like the kind you can get from Safeway...I'm not sure where their meat is from. However it's totally fresh, but it's not something I'd be too crazy for. Also they add SO MUCH SALT. Lol. Chill with the salt, sodium is overused. Their small size is about $7.00. I feel as if that is sort of pricey...for me that is. But surprisingly their small really fills you up, again idk if it's that mayonnaise because mayo can be super fattening and has a lot of calories. But when I want a sandwich I either go here or Ikes. Although, I'm only OK about going here. Owned by a family, I believe...? Very friendly workers. Also they create your sandwich right in front of you, and that's fun to watch.

Donuts are my downfall and I'm the one who's got her nose in the donut cabinet, squeezing each one with a pair of pincers to see which is the freshest. \n\nSub sandwiches go along the same principle. The bread is nicely browned on top with a little give when you press on it, letting you know that the bread on the inside is springy and fresh. Nicely crisp with a slight spring, not over toasted, bread that scratches the roof of the mouth slightly but not enough to hurt. And even if it did, you would not notice. Warm fillings that are bathed in a special sauce create a long sloppy trail of saliva that would rival that of any banana slug in the State of California. \n\nI am partial: I have only eaten the roast beef and am quite scared of trying anything else, for fear that the craving that I had reserved for a completely ecstatic, full frenzied culinary smorgasbord would fall depressingly short of any sort of feasible climax (very sad).

When I think that I really really want Sour Patch Kids, I probably actually want fruit. When I want enough carbs to feed a small village, I probably just need a nap. \n\nSo when I woke up on Sunday--starving, not having eaten in 14 hours (unheard of if you're an Alys D)--I had to trust my body when it was screaming\nPASTRAMI PASTRAMI PASTRAMI\nMaybe I was low on Iron...whatever. I checked Yelp and ended up at Sub Center, hidden beyond the more visible Toastie's (though better than the latter, according to the Yelp community). \n\nI got a \"mini\" size pastrami and turkey which absolutely satisfied my craving. I'm not exactly sure how much the sandwich itself cost, but it + a small soda = $7.17. More than I would usually pay for that size of sandwich, but totally worth it. \nMy only wish is that they offered wheat bread and more veggie fillings.\n\nP.S.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-19", "description": "A dang tasty sub sandwich, and like Marina Sub, my other favorite sub shop in SF, they toast the sandwiches properly with a huge oven that somehow produces an entirely different style of toasting from that found at Quiznos or Subway.  No comparison.  It would be like comparing a frozen grocery store burrito to one from a taqueria in the Mission.  You just don't do it, at least not if you want to retain any respect among your friends.  The bread is more approachable, the cheese is evenly melted, the meat gets somewhat toasted, but the vapors don't immerse themselves in your clothing and hair to where you smell like the sandwich shop for the rest of the day, nor do the corners of the bread get all blackened and knife-sharp.\n\nI prefer Marina Sub, but this place is totally in the running and if you're closer to it, I can see going here more often than not.  Marina is better for a couple of reasons: bologna on the basic sub, dressing is a bit better (IMO, girlfriend liked it more here), Tony the Marina restaurateur is always all smiles, and he puts like 3x the quantity of avocado on your sandwich, plus watching him slice it up is like an in-person Iron Chef experience.\n\nWith that summary in place, more detail:\n\nBread: generally soft, but with some risk of mouth-slicing-up.\nCheese: melted, tasty.\nDressing: Italian salad dressing, vinegar flavor.\nSides: potato salad served very cold (thumbs-up) but needed salt, soup was really excellent, some kind of vegetable barley business.\n\nCash only, but there's an ATM in the bar next door.  Only one guy sitting in there drinking hard liquor at 11:30am.  It occurs to me that, if I'm ever wondering if I'm an alcoholic, I'll know it's very likely if I find myself in a bar before 3pm, alone, drinking.\n\nSeemed very popular with the local workmen which is always a good sign.  Two sandwiches with bonus avocado were about $14.  Add'l sides were another $6.  So say $10 per person for tasty vittles, eh?  Not bad!", "author": "Walter K."}

I have to give this place a solid 3 stars (3.5 if I could) simply because I've had better.  There is another sub place that I do prefer.\n\nIn my experience, the service has been excellent.  If there is a person in line ahead of me, the guy will always ask if they're ready to make their order.  If not, he simply moves on to the next person, in a nice way, due to the fact that they do get busy at times.  Speaking of which, it's best to have your order ready especially when you do have time to decide as there will likely be a person or 3 ahead of you.  The only issue, if it is one, is that I can never understand what they say because they speak quickly.\n\nSo the reason why it's only 3 stars is because they slightly over-toast the sandwich which leaves the top and corners of the bread a bit dry.  The special/secret sauce is indeed your standard Italian dressing, but they splash just the right amount, and the meat is of the right portion.  The guys here are quick and put great effort into making a delicious, good looking sandwich with the meat nice and fluffy.

Fortunately they are open until 7:20 on weeknights, so I made it just in time the following day.\n\nNaturally, I went for the super size Atomic Sub, which was prepared by the person who was wiping down the tables. I was pretty surprised by the portion of meat being pretty meager all things considered, but withheld judgement. The sub was finished in the oven by the more senior counter person who seemed to be in charge. I was gratified to see that they dressed the rest of the sandwich with mayo and fresh trimmings AFTER the toasting. I ate the sub there while looking over the items framed on the wall, which were pretty ancient.\n\nThe crunchy roll did what it was supposed to - it held the sub together and the bread essentially disappeared - which in my experience is the way the classic Po'boy's in New Orleans function. The flavor of the meat and other ingredients was very good, and there was a pleasing after taste that transcended the Coke I drank.\n\nOverall it was a decent sub. The staff was indifferent, but then again it was the end of their day. I wouldn't send someone there unless they were already planning to be in that general area, and had a sub in mind. I can't really see what the fuss is about, but if it were in my neighborhood I could see being a regular. \n\nNot really a \"value\" as far as cheap eats go - given the portion, but a decent sub.

I always get the hot pastrami, seriously I have not had anything else here but the hot pastrami.  It's so juicy and flavorful.  They add the perfect amount of ingredients so everything compliments each other to perfection.  I love that vinaigrette that they put on, it adds a nice tangy flavor to the hot pastrami and keeps it moist. They always get freshly baked bread daily, they trim off some of the crust where it's too thick so when they toast it to perfection for you, it's a nice even toast all around.  I don't know how they do it, but the guys here just know when each sandwich is done toasting.  You think they forgot about your sandwich because it's been in that toaster for awhile with all these other sandwiches.  But no, they just know when to take it out to get that perfect toast on your sandwich.  It has a perfect thin crust that has a crunch on the outside but never burnt, inside is always soft and warm.  It's probably because it's always the same workers here everyday. I've been coming here for years and it's the same workers from the first time I walked in here.  The prices have gone up (but what hasn't?) and it is a little pricey for what you a get but that isn't stopping me from getting that hot pastrami.", "author": "Darren W."}

Don't bother saving the sandwich or its doomed to get soggy and why wouldn't you finish it?! \n\nAfter one bite, you'll just keep wanting more of their fresh crusty italian loaf bread. \n\nBesides the food, parking is a pain in the butt, theres this small lot on the other side of the street or by the Chevron gas station.

I've worked as a chef and written over a million words about food on the Internet. The Atomic Sub simply is one of the finest sandwich flavors you will ever taste.\n\nI can't tell you about any of their other sandwiches because there is no way I'd go there and not get a Super Atomic. The combination of pastrami, corned beef and turkey synthesizes into a gyros-like flavor that just can't be beat!\n\nBeen going there for over a decade and have never had a bad sandwich. Also, it is so good to see the huge number of locals who are crawling out of the woodwork to praise this place. This is a San Francisco jewel, much like Sam Woh's back when Edsel Ford ruled the 2nd floor dining room.\n\nMiss this at your own peril.

Picked a few up for me and my friends and ate at their place.  I ordered a large pastrami and turkey combo for each of us.  \n\nI have to admit it wasn't as great as I thought it'd be.  Don't get me wrong, it was a solid sandwich.  I liked the combination of the 2 meats and the bread was nice and crunchy.  It just didn't wow me like I expected to, especially since I don't go here too often.  It could be because I had the sandwich half an hour after ordering and maybe it got a little cold or the special sauce got the sandwich a bit soggy in places.  It could also be that the first half was filled with onions, which is one thing I hate in almost everything (yes, I have a few exceptions).  I took the wrong one because I assumed the unclear writing on the wrapper meant 'no onions'.  I could usually just take the onions out, but they were mixed pretty well with everything inside so I just ate it.  Ick.  Thankfully, I switched with my buddy for an onion-free second half and it was better!  Nonetheless, the sandwich simply did its job of filling me up but not much more.\n\nI'll definitely come back here sometime, since I pass by the place often.  The next time I will try to eat in so I can have it hot and fresh.", "author": "Oliver C."}

I was wondering how a tiny sandwich shop could be the most popular - and top rated - restaurant on Yelp.  So I finally tried one.  Here's why this place is so great.  The subs are served on soft, warm bread that doesn't make you look like a dog with a chew toy when you take a bite and is toasted so the cheese is perfectly melted.  I will say though, I tried to be healthy and ordered a turkey sub and had an awful case of food envy watching the meatball subs come out of the oven.  I'll definitely be trying the meatball sub next time.", "author": "Erica G."}

I have been a vegetarian for 4 years now, and I still enjoy the deliciousness of my avocado/lettuce/tomato/provolone sandwich + permission to bring a bottle of their secret sauce to table for personal emission on perfectly toasted bread. Like many of the reviews have stated, the dressing appears to be a mere Italian dressing, but its combination with sandwiches from this humble shop is unmatched.\n\nI shared some similarities to you carnivores pre meatless diet. Subs' turkey has a smokey, distinct taste that will give you a good idea of what to order for a first time visit. I never strayed away from this choice because of its consistency, and overall delectable combo. Sitting there on my many lunches I think I overheard the Atomic sub being ordered the most: roast beef/turkey/pastrami.\n\nTheir service is solid. They treat everyone coming in as quickly, and efficiently as possible. As a regular, I enjoy the pleasure of not needing to say my order, a feeling I always wanted to experience. For the many years of eating at this small business, my favorite has been the \"little guy.\"\n\nDon't waste your money at Quiznos or Subway. Where can you get truly toasted bread and almost any meat (or meat substitute) for a premium (it is pricey but look how beautiful West Portal is)  and know every time you will leave with a feeling of satisfaction?\n\nJust to conclude this, I want to mention I live a good 40 miles away from San Francisco.

The warm toasted bread is just right, not too hard and still soft on the inside while not too fluffy. The taste of their pastrami with their special Italian sandwich sauce is such a delectable combination it almost made me curl my toes. They don't necessarily make the biggest sandwiches in the world and the only thing I wish they would do is give just a bit more meat. Other than that, exceptional hot pastrami sandwich which is made fresh and relatively quickly (will take a bit longer than cold sandwiches because they stick the sandwich in a mini oven).

The biggest problem I encountered was all their meat was already pre-cut and simply sitting out in the open.  The place didn't look that clean to begin with, so seeing the meat uncovered wasn't very appealing.  I have to admit the bread was decent, especially being toasted in their oven.  The weird part was they put the meat on the bread and then put it in the oven, but the meat was still room temp.

If you get a night craving for these sandwiches, Gene's Liquor's on 32nd and Taraval uses the same recipes (the owners are from the same family) and is open late, although the menu is less extensive and the ingredients not quite as fresh.", "author": "Bobby M."}

The perfect bread. the fresh ingredients. the secret sauce.  the best is the hot pastrami.  with the meat kept warm stewing its juices... juices that when married with the secret sauce and mayo make my toes cramp.  the meat ball is great (hold the lettuce)  and if you are feeling crazy the atomic sub is sublime.  otherwise, remember that the cheese stake is just a roast beef with cheese, the pizza is just the sandwich bread with tomato sauce and cheese, and don't expect the lady to drop the change in your hand.  she's ocd like that.  she always puts it on the counter.", "author": "Charlie H."}
