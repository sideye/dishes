It was a weekday and my brother-in-law picked us up at the airport at 9am as we caught the first flight out to SF.  BIL asks if we want to go to brunch, \"there's this whole-in-the-wall place that I go to all the time, its CHEAP and its really good too!\" He's saying all the right things and of course, we're in, plus this gives us quality time to spend with him before he drops us off at his house to run errands.\n\nBecause of the time of day, we make it from the airport to the restaurant in 15-minutes.  Street parking is the only option as this is a neighborhood joint. People walk from their homes, school and nearby businesses to feast here.  Because this is BIL's frequent stop, we park at the Safeway across the street and like city folk, we jay-walk.\n\nSo we walk in and I look up at the menu and exclaimed how cheap it was as the lunch special beef broccoli was only $3.75! So my BIL was like, no you can't order from there, order from here and points to the menu on the front window of the counter. Which was still a good deal. I opted for the longanisa plate at $3.75 while my BIL got bangus (fish) and my husband got the tilapia plates.  Including, coffee, our bill was $17.  Cash is king here.\n\nService was quick.  My husband went to the market next door to check it out and in less than 2-minutes, our meals were delivered. And the food was good too. I've never had a sliced tomato with longanisa before. Of course my BIL enjoyed his meal as he orders it all the time and my husband did a great job of digging into the tilapia as they serve the entire fish.\n\nBut I still wondered why I couldn't order from the menu up above.  My BIL says that the menu has been hanging there for the past 30-years and through the different owners. They just haven't taken it down or removed any of the menu items or the prices. It's quirky but makes for a good story.\n\nMy BIL told us that this place gets busy at lunch because the high school kids at the school nearby come here for lunch.  And sure enough, 10:30 am, 8 people came in all at the same time.  The restaurant is small, so the 8th person in line stood at the very entrance of the restaurant.  If a 9th person came, they would be standing in line outside the entrance.\n\nThe city in the older suburb areas has many of these type of restaurants. This certainly made for a great start to this visit to SF.", "author": "Edith S."}

I travel all the way from the East Bay to get my favorite, Hong Kong style pork chops. \n\nIf you thought that your local Filipino restaurant had delicious food, you were mistaken. This restaurant may not be the best looking, but looks can be deceiving sometimes! It's a hole in the wall restaurant that only locals know about. From their longanisa, to the tocino, to the pork chops, to the fish, etc... Everything is amazing.\n\nWhen I first went there, I never thought that I would've enjoyed the food so much. They cook everything perfectly. The pork chops are never dry or over cooked, the longanisa and tocino is juicy, the fried rice isn't too salty. The prices and portions are another favorite of mine! For a plate of your liking, its about $3-$5 at the most. The portions are huge. If you can't finish your brunch, you can always take it to go and it still tastes the same or even better later! I usually order the hong kong style pork chops with a scrambled egg, rice, and tomatoes on the side. I dip my porkchops in vinegar and soy sauce. \n\nIf you're ever in the mission and come across this restaurant, do not sleep on them!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-24", "description": "Hole-in-the-wall does not even begin to describe Superstar Restaurant. From the dingy front sign, the old-school menu board, the damaged ceiling with water stains, the taped-up chairs, and mismatched plates and utensil, Superstar is more like the crack in the wall that always leaks, is discolored and rusting, and large enough for your neighbor to peek through. With that being said, you won't find a cheaper, filling, and more complete meal. At $3-$5 a plate, Superstar stands as one of the best deals in the city.\n\nSuperstar serves some variations of Chinese food, but most people come in for the Filipino breakfast dishes. From favorites such as Tosilog, Tapsilog, Longsilog, and Hong Kong Pork chops, Superstar has maintained its clientele with its generous portions and rarely changing prices. And don't be scared to combine certain items, as they are usually really flexible with combinations. Superstar has maintained a good business model, cutting out on most of the extras, to serve their customers a consistent product. Each \"silog\" comes with eggs, garlic rice, and your choice of pineapple or tomato. When ordering, please mention if you want pineapple as tomato is the default choice.\n\nSuperstar closes before most get off work, so plan accordingly during the daytime. Make sure to call in advance as they do get busy, especially during lunchtime. And I recommend ordering for pick-up, especially those of you who prefer or are used to cleaner eating conditions. I have been going here for years, and like the quality of their dishes, some things will never change.", "author": "Carlo D."}

The sign is so small and simple that you probably wouldn't even see it if you were driving. But the workers there are really nice.\n\nMaybe it's the Filipino in me, but goodness I la-la-love silogs, even if it's not made from Filipinos. The people here make a mean silog for an amazingly nice price ( one box is like $3 I think) \n\nI've tried practically every silog in this joint, but my favorite is their tapsilog and their bangus sisilog. Salty but it keeps you wanting a crapload more. They always ask if you want tomatoes or pineapples with your order and I opt for pineapples, because I have this thing for pairing up salty foods with sweet foods.\n\nParking is horrible in Excelsior.

Alright, stop throwin' tomatoes. \n\nIn fact, my love for tomatoes is why I rate Superstar better than Gateway. Taste-wise they're pretty similar. I ordered the hotdogsilog at both and they use the same brand. But Superstar offers the choice between a side of pineapple chunks or fresh cut tomatoes unlike Gateway, who only offers the pineapple. \n\nI believe the prices are slightly cheaper at Superstar, too (maybe by 25 cents). They also offer a hardboiled, salted egg for $0.85 and other Chinese lunch plates, which I don't think Gateway has.\n\nHaving a side of tomato and salted egg with my silog plate is how I'm used to eating Filipino breakfast, so that's why Superstar gets my vote, but honestly they're both great, cheap Filipino eats.\n\nIt gets an A from me (4/5 stars) for the big portions they give under $5.", "author": "GG C."}

Their taped up menu in the front might look cheap, and their coffee machine old and nasty, but everything is better than it looks! Their building is actually not as bad as it looks and their kitchen is surprisingly clean.\n\nI've been going to this place since high school and it's never disappointed me. What's not to love about this place? Cheap, good, and quick. Perfect for high school and college students that are trying to save money. Hell, it's even great for someone looking for some good Filipino food while in the area!\n\nSuperstar has always been my go-to place when I needed some delicious and cheap food. I live in Daly City currently, but I still make the drive up to this place! The location is perfect for people attending City College of San Francisco as well because it's just a 15-20 minute walk or about a 5 minute drive depending on traffic. There is also a Safeway across from the building which makes it even better! Their food always comes with a buttload of garlic fried rice, an egg, and a side of pineapple cubes or tomato slices. I'd recommend trying the Jumbo Fried Chicken (jumbo is not an overstatement) or the Hong Kong style pork chops!\n\nThe only thing about this restaurant is that sometimes the food can get a bit greasy. I mean, some of the menu items are fried already, and the egg is probably cooked in a good amount of oil on their skillet. If you're watching your weight, you probably don't want to eat here. The building can also look pretty bad at first sight because the owners have kept the building the same way ever since it was purchased. It's not that bad though, feels a little like going to your grandma's old house.\n\nThe last thing is that Superstar can get extremely busy at around noon because everyone is ordering for lunch. There will be people that have 4-5 boxes to-go that have called in beforehand for takeout. They are open until 4:30, so there's plenty of time to wait!\n\nI'd recommend trying this place because it's great, cheap, and in a pretty decent location.", "author": "Alexander L."}

Their logo used to say Superstar Filipino Food now it's just labeled Chinese food. I heard the owner made lots of money over the years and bought lots of houses. All I can say is after milking all of those money from making FILIPINO food, the owner should at least acknowledge and let it be known that what their customers eat is Filipino food. It's just like how China is currently stealing Philippine lands as I type this, Chinese people wil try to profit off of our Filipino food too? These people are shady and greedy! Hongkong style silog really? And the Filipino guy who taught the owner how to cook Filipino food is an idiot and deserve a smack over the head", "author": "Michael L."}

This place has been here since early 80's, maybe late 70's, and the prices are stupid CHEAP. They serve all types of filipino tselog plates, it means everything is served with garlic fried rice, fried egg, and tomatos (you can request pineapple instead). Tapsilog, bangus, whole tilapia, tocino, longonisa, and more. \n\nThis place is really famous for the signature Hong Kong style pork chop. Deep fried pork chop with all its glorified greaazyyyy goodness. I will always make this bad boy a combo, Tapsilog & hong kong pork chop with an extra egg, & sabow on the side (soup broth for melting the greese in my stomach). \n\nDo not come here expecting a classy atmosphere with waiters to seat and serve. Come here, find a seat, and sit. If the place is full, just stand and wait for a table to open up, people here eat fast, and you should do the same. Once you sit down Jeff or his sister will come take your order, so please do not sit down unless you know what you want. The menu is on the wall behind the register. Order your food, and in less then 5 min, they will run it out to you on old school Chinese plates. Every table has hot sauce, vinegar, salt n pepper, and the sauce dipper dishes are behind the counter, just ask. If this type of stuff scares you, ORDER TO GO!!\n\nCaution: Eating here will make you sleepy! but its hella worth it!! \n\nI love this place and everyone that loves old school Filipino food love it too, eversince 1980's.", "author": "Mono L."}

The price is unbeatable for the quantity you get. The pork chops themselves are decent, but could have been juicier. The meat was very dry in some parts. They aren't the best slabs of meat, but breaded nicely. The garlic fried rice is simplistic, but hits the spot just right and goes with the pork chop well. \n\nThis joint is a complete hole in the wall.

This place is dirt cheap, so cheap i dont know how they keep the price so low. For close to $3 you can get a huge mutated size chicken (legs and thigh) with garlic rice and an egg. The Chicken is cooked asian style and pan fried. The skin is super crunchy and delicious. The hong kong style pork chops are really good too. They give you 2 pieces, but a lot of it is bone. \n\nA lot of filipinos come here cause they make filipino dishes here but its chinese owned. I always call ahead and take it to go.

I read Yelp reviews before I came and I was thinking about getting the HK Pork Chop, but I figured that I might as well try something new.\n\nI ordered the Tapsilog. It came out to $3.25, and I spoke to the cashier in Cantonese. She was really accommodating and nice, and made sure that my friend and I understood what every dish was. \n\nI didn't get to eat the Topsilog that my friend ordered, but my Tapsilog was amazing. There was less beef than I expected, but the sauce was somewhat spicy (to me) and salty, but there was a lot of garlic fried rice. The egg was done nicely - not too runny and not too solid. I got pineapple and it was just... pineapple from a can. Can't expect too much. The rice actually didn't taste like garlic. I was kind of disappointed, to be quite honest! I would have liked a small hint of garlic somewhere, but that wasn't the case. However, the rice was cooked well and it was good. \n\nFour stars. Honestly, the food was cheap enough to make up for some of the oversights - i.e. the rice with no garlic taste and the lack of beef - because it came quickly, tea was good (and came with the meal). \n\nI actually came back here after this visit and ordered the HK Pork Chop and it was HUGE. However, the rice that time was leftover (I got it to go), since it was harder and  eh. But I got tomato this time and was surprised to see that it was raw. It was soooo good.

Sheetrock walls cry out in vain for a fresh coat of paint, while fake walnut paneling along the north wall is loaded with carved sets of initials that pre-date the Reagan administration. Two windows face Mission Street, but fliers, pamplets, and advertisements hinder any light trying to get in.\n\nWhile ambiance is lacking, the grub isn't bad.  The sound of orders sizzling on the grill radiates through dining area, and no steam trays are visible from the counter.  Better yet, everything on the menu is under five bucks, with the vast majority of combination plates selling for under four.\n\nI got the Mongolian Beef, which came with alongside a sizable pile of steamed rice. Bargain-priced at $3.95, it was mildly spiced and unconventionally sweet.  While the super-star's rendition of Mongolian Beef is anything but conventional, it's still tasty.  One might even think of it as Szechwan-Filipino fusion instead of the generic Mandarin you might expect.  The staff is friendly and polite, and despite the wear-and-tear on the interior, the entire place looks pretty clean.\n\nUnless you find yourself deep in the outer Mission, the Super Star isn't a destination that's worthy of inter-neighborhood travel.  But if you're in the Excelsior and not far from Geneva, stop by if ambiance is something you'll sacrifice for decent Chinese food at rock-bottom prices.", "author": "Mike W."}

I remember being a kid, and waking up to these styrofoam takeout boxes with happy faces on them on the kitchen table. My dad would get home from work at 9am, and always bring me and my big sister some food for us to eat. So I guess it's safe to say I was brought up with this food, and I still love it to this day.\n\nThe place, as far as I can remember, has the same cashier guy, dealing with all the customers. He is truly a nice guy, and I always let him know I was a kid when I first saw him. \n\nThe food is what's special about this place. Very simple filipino/chinese plates that are extremely cheap. They range from about $2 to $3, from tosilog to longsilog, to new plates they have introduced. The plates usually come with either tomato  or pineapple slices, and an \"eeg\". Some of the regulars might remember this, but they used to have a wooden board that said \"blah blah blah w/ eeg\". They misspelled egg wrong and it always caught my eye. Anyways, this is place very old, and has had the same layout since my early years. I hope the business continues to prosper, as I would be truly saddened if they ever decided to close.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-06-07", "description": "I think the ratings are high because the food is so cheap here. A dish with MEAT [looks like it, has the name of it, tastes sorta like it], a ton of garlic rice, and a fried egg for less than $3? An entire fried tilapia for $4? Where are they getting these ingredients? It doesn't even make sense! The quality is definitely reflective of the price, even though the quantity is not.\n\nI suppose you can come here if you're broke or whatever, but I think for the same, I'd rather get a burger at In-n-Out. For all other silog cravings [silogs aren't exactly healthy as it is], I'll probably go elsewhere. I'm sure the people are nice here. The spot is pretty grimy. You get a lot of food for paying next to nothing. So it's really between MEH and A'IGHT since I'm not overly picky.", "author": "Tinna H."}

I always went to the first two because I've always heard of Superstar as a Filipino restaurant and I don't really know Filipino food that well.\n\nI actually went in recently and was surprised. The place is literally a hole in the wall and is a typical example of a local greasy spoon Asian-style. The food is quite plentiful and cheap. The restaurant's decor is non-existent because they simply don't have the time to manage it. The restaurant is packed and it seems like they are all locals. It is a favorite amongst Filipinos because I always see a lot of them eating in. The food is prepared really quickly and definitely with its fair share of grease and them some.\n\nFilipino food and Chinese food are both served here and they're both really good. I had the garlic fried rice and it looks like they use an entire clove or two of garlic for the fried rice. Although I may not come back because the hygiene just looks a bit too questionable for me, it was definitely tasty and a good experience.", "author": "Rick C."}

I've had pretty much the main lunch menu....the Tasilog, Longsilog, HK Style Pork Chop, and Fried Fish, and I can vouch for every one of them. \n\nIn a take-out box, they give you a decent portion of the food. The garlic rice, with sprinkles of garlic on top, is probably what will fill you up the most along with a side of fried egg and your choice of either pineapple or tomato. \n\nThis place isn't the most sanitary place on the block, but people seem to love coming here. Because of this, I've only had take-out and those who decided to sit-in seem to enjoy their food regardless of the environment. O well.

Wow this place is cheap for what it is and the portions are a lot. You can't go wrong with the price. I guess they have a similar place located somewhere else in the Daly city area.  So my friend Mark and I decided to hit place up.  Right when we walked it was cramped with a bunch of stains in the ceiling and walls.  The place is really small for being a hole in the wall joint.  I got the hong kong style pork chop which was $3.25. Damn that's cheap.  The reason why I gave this place a two star is because of the cleanliness but I should be giving it a one but I'm being nice.  So I saw one of the ladies who was cleaning the place was busing tables out in the dining area.  She had these rubbermaid yellow cleaning glove on.  After that she went to the back making the fried rice.  She had the same rubbermaid glove on one and was mixing the fried rice with the same gloves on!!!!!! After that I stop eating my food and was just in shock! I told my Mark what I just saw and we both left.

For the price, I can't really complain, but if I had to point a couple things out then it would be the way they made their tocino...Instead of it being served in their normal form of meat chunks and strips, it is broken down into mini niblets which is unsatisfactory in my book. The rice is also fried in bulk which is a half-ass attempt to cooking garlic fried rice. Being such a small Hole-In-The-Wall family owned restaurant, I understand that they have to whip those plates out in record time in order to satisfy the masses, so i'll give them points for that. \n\nBut once again, I cannot complain for the amount of food I am given with the price I pay. I must say that they serve the meanest Hong Kong Style Pork Chops and Bangus. Turn those two choices into a combination rice plate and you have yourself a feast!\n\nOne more thing I must mention is that they are closed on Sundays out of all days! They are literally missing out on the potential cashflow they could be receiving due to the early morning church-go'ers and  lazy sunday post-party animals looking for something quick and cheap to eat. \n\nI love this place to death and will continue to eat here but these are just a few suggestions for a great place to make it an even better place!", "author": "Duane R."}

That being said, Yelp should have a new price range called UBER CHEAP (less than $5/person)\n\nSo, my cheap-ass Asian side LOVES that.\n\nAuthenticity-wise, didn't really impress my Filipino boyfriend.  He liked their Spamsilog (but c'mon I have yet to meet a Filipino who DOESN'T like spam) and their garlic fried rice.  However, the longanisa left him wanting, so much that he didn't eat the second longanisa link (and he RARELY leaves uneaten food on his plate)  I was halfway tempted to eat it for him since I hate wasting food myself, but my vegetarian conscience wouldn't let me.\n\nSo speaking of which, once I told the guy behind the counter that I was vegetarian, he immediately gave me BOTH pineapples and tomatoes w/ my garlic fried rice... who knew such simple food could make me so happy?\n\nTo echo previous reviewers, this place definitely does not get famous off its ambience.  Definitely small and cramped, sticky tile floors, but hey overall not horribly dirty.  Having grown up eating at hole-in-the-wall's all over SF, Hong Kong and Hawaii, I'm totally ok with it... but it may not be suitable for the faint-hearted.\n\nOne more thing... not sure if this bothers some hardcore Filipino diners, but the owners and cooks of Super Star are NOT Filipino.  They are a Chinese family who speaks Tagalog and Cantonese (so my boyfriend and I could both pick up bits and pieces of their kitchen conversations).  However, that doesn't seem to bother many of the Filipino locals in the area... many of them seem to be regulars.\n\nSo if you're hungry and broke, this be your place.", "author": "Catherine C."}

Dingy, dirty, depressing. BUT amazingly THE FOOD WAS GOOD.\n\nHowever like someone said, were I to look in the kitchen... it might be another story. I am surprised they passed the health inspection. \n\nFOOD:\n\nThe garlic fried rice is a bit heavy for my taste but it suits most people fine. It would be better to get steamed rice if you're ordering a fried or greasy meat component. I ordered the fried chicken, and it was moist and flavorful inside, not dry like I expected. \n\nThe sunnyside egg and tomato are nice sides that accompany every dish. I liked their Longaniza, philippinio sausage, better than the chicken. I never tried it before and it was savory and sweet at the same time. The flavor was very intense so again, steam rice might be a better option. \n\n\nCOST:\n\nIt is dirt cheap, 3-4$ dollar for a meal. I wouldn't take someone on a first date here though. The food might be decent, but you might be labeled a cheap ass and again the \"decor\" will scare away your date. Would I come here again? I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-02", "description": "Super Stars located on Mission Street is a great place to eat if your on a budget. The food at Super Stars is really cheap because all of the meals on the menu probably cost around four dollars or less. The food is served in a pretty large portion for the price that it is. Each dish is served with garlic fried rice, eggs, tomatoes or pineapples, and then your main dish. Some of  the main dishes that are served at this location are Hong Kong style porkchops, tilapia, bangus, tapa, longanesa, and fried chicken. I recommend getting the Hong Kong style porkchops because they're good, and they serve it to you in a very large portion. I also enjoy eating the other dishes, but the porkchops are my favorite. The food is also kind of greasy, especially the garlic fried rice, but i still think its good.\n\nThe food is great at this restaurant, but the surroundings and the area to sit is kind of dirty. There are not that many tables in this restaurant and only a limited amount of seats. Each table has four chairs, but if four people were to sit in one table then it would be cramped. There is also barely any space between you and the table behind you, and this makes it very hard to back out of your seat. The sitting area in general is very small, and I would recommend taking the food to-go. You are also not allowed to take your food to-go and eat at the tables because there are no garbage cans in this restaurant. If you eat you food there, then they serve it to you in a plate, not in a plastic container. I also think the cups that they serve your water seem dirty, so i don't recommend asking for a cup of water. I also think that the bathroom is dirty, and should be cleaned more thoroughly.\n\nI would consider this restaurant to be fast food because after you order you would probably receive your food within five to ten minutes. They are really fast and quick when they make your meals, but it still tastes delicious.\n\nI would definitely recommend Super Stars to all audiences if they enjoy Chinese/Filipino food. It's a great place to eat for breakfast, and maybe even lunch or dinner. I would definitely recommend this place to starving college students like me that are on a tight budget. You could get a large meal that could get you really full for under four dollars. These meals are authentic home cooked meals if you long for those meals that your mom makes. This would probably be the same price if you were to eat at a McDonald's, but Super Stars is a lot better. It's a good hang out place for a large, cheap, and tasty meal.", "author": "Bryan T."}

I especially like the Hong Kong style fried pork chops.  You will have cholesterol and MSG running through your veins for days!  However, they do fry the rice with toasted garlic to make it a bit healthy.  This place is great for those once-in-a-while urges to eat something really greasy for breakfast, lunch or dinner...especially when you're broke and feel like eating out. This place is popular with Filipinos, but the cooks are Chinese.", "author": "Raging R."}

What better place to go then to Super Star.  Lunch is very affordable especially when feeding large groups of people.  I bought 10 lunches for $38.00.  9 Hong Kong style Pork Chops and 1 smoked boneless bangus.  Usually when coworkers order from here I just place my order and they go pick it up.  This time I went to the establishment and picked up the orders.  This is not a place you want to eat at.  Call it in \"To Go\" and have someone else pick it up for you.  The place is small, crowded, not clean at all.  So why eat here? Because its that darn good and cheap.  The rice can be a bit hard at times but I think its because its steamed first and then fried with garlic and the rice turns a bit crunchy or stale like.  I had the bangus(milk fish) rice and 2 eggs.  The eggs are always over cooked and I wish they could come a bit more runny.  I think it just carries on the cooking while packed and by the time it arrives the office its over cooked.  The fish is always good, perfect smokiness and no bones at all. Drizzle a bit of vinegar and enjoy with the egg and garlic rice.  You cant beat the prices and the yummy food.  Just have someone else go pick it up and you will enjoy this typical Filipino breakfast/lunch specials.", "author": "David P."}

The food is great and for a starving student just getting out of afternoon class, you can not beat the price.  Keep it up super star, im a customer for life... and dont trip, Ling Nam cant fade you guys.", "author": "eddo l."}

Fried chicken there is huge and delicious. all for under 4 dollars too!?!? crazy!?! yes its dirty, but those are the best places to get food at", "author": "Preston L."}
