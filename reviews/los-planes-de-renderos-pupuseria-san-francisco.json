This as the first place that I have ever had pupusas and this place was my standard. I really love how cirspy and fresh the tortilla and fillings were. My favorite ones to order are the cheese and bean as well as the shredded pork. The pork is absolutely delicious as it is tender and juicy. The cheese and bean pupusa is really delicious and the ratio from cheese to bean is perfect. Also the salad/garnish it comes with is delicious. Just having that alone as a side dish is honestly perfect to me. I wish it had more kick to it (spicy). \n\nOne thing that I have to mention is be careful if you're vegetarian/vegan because they cook their beans in lard. I believe there is an alternative where you can ask for black beans instead of refried beans, but again it is best to ask. \n\nAnother special mention on the menu is to get their horchata. It is seriously tasty and it will lighten up your day. Everyone loves a good horchata drink!\n\nIn terms of food and service it is pretty good. Sometimes the wait for the food can be long , but for the most part on average it comes in around 10-15 min. \n\nIf you're ever in the neighborhood or in the mood for pupusas I'd say this place is a must. It is also right outside the bus stop so it's super easy to get to.", "author": "John M."}

I will say that so far, based on my Pupusa Spreadsheet, this is currently ranking at the top based on several factors.

The pupusas at Los Planes De Renderos are deliciously flavorful, nice & cheesy, and the exterior is not greasy. \n\nAn order of pupusa comes with a side of curtido (cabbage slaw) and homemade salsa. I tried 3 different ones and they well all quite good!\n- Pupusa de Chicharron y Queso (shredded pork + cheese) - my favorite!\n- Pupusa Revuelta (shredded pork + cheese + beans) - a bit salty\n- Pupusa de Queso y Loroco (cheese + loroco) - Interesting since I didn't know what loroco was but had ordered it because it was recommended. Loroco is an edible flower. It's good, I just prefer meat filling :P\n\nAMBIANCE - As other yelpers have commented, this place is a bit dive-y. When you step in there are 3 small tables and a partial view of the kitchen. There's a stairway that leads to more seating on the 2nd floor. While the interior may not be impressive, the food will more than make up for it. It's often these mom & pop shops that have the most authentic food so order yours to go.\n\nSERVICE - I called ahead to place an order and it was ready in 20min. The lady who took my order was friendly and gave me recommendations on their popular pupusas.\n\nPARKING - a bit difficult to find parking but the food is well worth the hassle\n\nTIPS -\n- CASH ONLY!\n- Check out the Salvadorian bakery next door -- good pastries especially the tres leche!", "author": "Ruby C."}

If I overeat, I'll have zero appetite in the morning, still drop a few pounds and go binge-eating by the afternoon. It seems very unreachable especially since fast food is out of the question, and with my metabolism always in overdrive. \n\nThat's why I decided to hop on a Latin diet. Who doesn't love the exotic flavors and fresh ingredients of Latin America? And let's not forget my favorite day of the week, Taco Tuesdays! That's where Los Planes de Renderos falls in.

All pupusa orders are served with their house concoction salsa rojo and a cabbage slaw. Each pupusa was the side of a huge oversize pancake.  The shredded pork was evenly distributed with the ooey gooey cheesy goodness webbing through interior. Top it with the slaw and add the salsa to adjust to your spiciness liking, these things are simply bomb!\n\nLos Planes de Renderos Pupuseria is special.

Me and my folks use to come here on the regular like clockwork for about 10 years and it never disappointed. One of my fondest memories is my pop's arguing with the owner of the place about some Salvadorian soccer player and in the process almost getting us banned from this place. The pupusas are really good and their platoa\u00f1os are always on point. They have two floors (at least since the last time I've been there) and their service is always great. The pupusas tend to be a little less greasy than other places which is OK but I'd prefer my pupusas dripping wet (That's what I said, get it??). If only this place was open late night so I can find my way in there after a nice night which probably includes a near death experience at Bottom's Up then that would awesome.\n\nI suggest you don't drive here because it can be a real B trying to find parking. Be careful in parking in front of this place next to the bus stop because you will get towed. Hasn't happened to me but I've seen it happen plenty of times. \n\nAll in all this is definitely a place you need to check out.", "author": "Javier G."}

I ordered 2 bean and cheese pupusas and a fruit drink that had chunks of apples, pineapple, and I think mango with cilantro, it was very good!! I decided to eat there and minutes later came the pupusas with a side of coleslaw.  The beans and cheese spilled out while cooking and it got a little crunchy on the sides which was so good!!

I mean, honestly, a pupusa is a pupusa right? How can a stuffed maize-dough tortilla from one location taste any different than that of another; besides, of course, the amount of oil used by each? Boy was I given a slap in the face when I tried Los Planes. I was dead wrong in my assumption, and was so overwhelmingly satisfied with not only the really low prices, but also at how fresh and delicious the pupusas were. This place is good eats. \n\nNow, I'm not Salvadorean, so by no means does my judgment of the authenticity of Salvadorean cuisine hold any validity whatsoever. However, as a previous poster commented, this place is filled to the brim with native Salvadoreans (I do speak fluent Spanish and can distinguish the accents/diction of several Latin American cultures), and that in itself speaks loads on the restaurant's behalf.\n\nIt is a hole-in-the-wall establishment, which may turn-off the bombardment of hipsters and yuppies recently acquired by the Mission District, but this is an authentic Mission-style restaurant, with authentic Mission-style food, and fuck me is it delicious.\n\nI would definitely love to come back here, very soon, and recommend this place to anyone who loves them some pupusas! It may be a bit difficult to find, so in case you are having trouble, just note to yourself: Mission Street & Persia Ave, on the right side of the block with the uphill slope, right next to the Salvadorean bakery. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Bryan H."}

Customer service, honesty and integrity are of utmost importance when running a small business.  My 12 y/o daughter and I decided to venture out and try a new restaurant we love Salvadorean food and found Los Plane De Renderos Pupuseria on Yelp.  We entered the small restaurant and sat ourselves as no one came to greet us.  The place is quite small maybe 14 x 10 feet and we were two of four customers in the Restaurant mind you there are only approx 6 small tables it's not like they were busy.  We waited to order and finally my daughter got up and went to the register to get someones attention and placed the order, she ordered a $12 dish of Lengua and Salsa and I ordered $6.50 dish we also ordered two Horchata's listed on the menu as $2.50 each.  It took a long time to prepare the food, it finally came and was decent but nothing to write home about.  No one ever came out to check on us so my daughter once again went to the register to ask for our check.  The lady told her \"That will be $32.20\" My daughter and I had already calculated the bill to be $23.50 + tax & tip so I said do you mean $23.50?  She said \"No $32.20 you ordered large horchata's and they cost $5.50 each\"   We did not order larger horchata's we asked for 2 horchata's as there was no size designation on the menu and they did not ask us what size when we ordered.  The menu just reads horchata $2.50.  The lady said we changed the prices and its not on the menu.   I paid the $32.20 I'm still kicking myself, I left the restaurant feeling cheated and reverse discriminated against.  I will never go back here or recommend this place to anyone else there are many other Salvadorean places to visit.  It's sad thou, being a SF resident and a business owner who showers there customers with customer service I never expect to be treated badly or unfairly by other small business owners as your customers our the life blood of your business.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-03", "description": "I love pupusas.  For those that are unfamiliar with Salvadorian cuisine a pupusa is somewhat similar to a quesadilla but utilizes thick corn cakes instead of thin flour tortillas.  The middle of a pupusa can be filled with a variety of things but are most commonly seen with cheese, beans, or carnitas or a combination of all or each on their own.  \n\nThe thick corn cakes are then pan-seared until the ingredients are hot or melted and when it is eaten it is usually accompanied by a special cabbage salsa called Curtido.  This type of Salvadorian 'slaw' at Los Planes is great and tastes just like my aunt makes.  \n\nNow about Los Planes......it is a very very very tiny little hole in the wall restaurant but the food here is very authentic and delicious.  There is no real seating downstairs but there is a smaller area upstairs if you insist on eating in but i wouldn't recommend it.  It is better to take out and enjoy the comforts of home.  \n\nGiven that I can't really eat these greasy cakes of goodness all the time I must do so sparingly when I get the chance and thus I choose my pupusas carefully.  I LOVE the bean and cheese combination the best and I completely smother it in curtido.  The crunchiness of the cabbage combined with the crispy and soft pupusa is a definitive experience of El Salvadorian food.  Beware of dripping grease while eating this tasty dish as we all know that oil is the WORST stainer.  \n\nI wouldn't change los planes for anything because i appreciate and love hole in the wall places.  the best part is that the owners don't skimp on the curtido and the prices are great.  \n\nWhile you wait for your pupusas take a trip next door to the Salvadorian panaderia next door (bakery).  They have sweet cake and cookies that are to die for.  Check out my review on Pacita's Salvadorian Bakery\n\nIf you come to SF and want to try the real Salvadorian pupusa go to Los Planes.

If you order out, they always give plenty of it along with Salsa\n\nTrue, this place is more like a take-out place/dive and they DO tend to forget customers upstairs (trust me I've been in many of those situations), but I do not complain because the pupusas are that good haha The platanos fritos and the Empanadas are also delicious mmmm\n\nAnd honestly, there are A LOT of dives in SF that only take cash, not just this place, so always come prepared, especially if you plan to eat on Mission, OK!", "author": "Cesar C."}

Also in a sort of obscure part of the Excelsior, so keep an eye on the shadows at night. However, that said, the restaurant has a friendly atmosphere.\n\nBut, the food was excellent. The menu for papusas is fairly limited, but the papusas are great. We also had the sweet corn soup - sweet, but great. And the plantains...that might have been the best of all. Don't tell your cardiologist.\n\nNo beer or alcohol served.", "author": "Mister K."}

I have been going here for 2 years and I have tried several places but this is my favorite so far. They're so cheap too $1.79 each or something. Really reasonable for anytime of the day! I have come to eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! I bring all my friends here and I would recommend this place to everyone.  Parking is sometimes hard depending what time you go, but this is my go to place! I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if you do come here you must try their papusas!", "author": "Liana D."}

God.\n\nI ate my first pupusas here today after hearing about the wonderful morsels of Salvadoran deliciousness that they serve here. Every word I've heard is true. YUM!\n\nThe menu is larger than I expected, but the second page is all that matters. They serve about 5 varieties of pupusas here and the ones filled with pork are by far the most juicy and most flavorful.\n\nI ordered mine for an early dinner with an horchata (less cinnamon-y than others and a bit chocolate-y) and was full with 2 pupusas. The cabbage that they serve with the pupusas is absolutely wonderful in terms of flavor and texture. The cabbage is soft and easy to eat, but not so soft as to make you question its freshness. The salsa they serve is watery, but has enough flavor to really enhance your pupusas.\n\nThe actual restaurant is a bit grungy, but just bring hand sanitizer and you're golden.\n\nThe MUNI 29 line rolled by while we were upstairs, so that's certainly an option for getting to this restaurant.\n\nFor those who go without a guide, you sit down first and the owner will find you. Grab menus off of whatever tables you find to decide what you want. When you're done, head for the kitchen and pay in cash. Head on over to the Salvadoran bakery next door for a guava filled shortbread cookie or a tres leches cake.\n\nTotal cost of my two pupasas + horchata? $5\n\n====\n\nRubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again", "author": "Eric K."}

It's got about 4 2-person tables stuck down in the entry room where the cash register is, and additional seating upstairs (those waitresses are hardcore climbing those up and down all day with big trays of food).  I haven' had a TON of pupusas in my time, but from the one's that I've had (which were all highly recommended by friends), these were up there taste-wise.  They come out piping hot and are served with free chips and the radish/sauce stuff you get to smother the things in before you gobble them down.  If you're in a big rush it may not be the best place to stop by since parking can be rough, and since it's run by a staff of about 3-4 (only noe waitress usually), you may have to wait 15 mins or so for your food.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a little cozy spot where you can have a chat with a friend and down some hot, tasty pupusas, this place is great!  They're like less than 2$ each too!", "author": "Matt M."}

I don't remember their name and i used to go there EVERY WEEKEND TO GET A PAPUSA but they raised their prices from 2.50 to 3.00 and thats just too expensive...though when you taste it...ITS WORTH IT.  I have to go and remember their name because thats how i want EVERY PAPUSA TO TASTE!", "author": "Bing D."}

The ambience is definitely nothing to speak of, and the sticky plastic table coverings prompted us to take our order to go, but the food was delicious. We had the bistec encebollado (about $10), an assortment of pupusas (about $2 each), and an empanada ($2.50). The bistec was remarkably lean and tender, the beans and rice that accompanied were tasty, and the corn tortillas were plentiful and delicious. The pupusas were also delicious and quite large, and came with a tasty red sauce and cabbage slaw (almost like a Latin kim-chi, flavored with chili and vinegar). The empanada was not at all what I expected, being more familiar with Argentinan style spicy meat empanadas. Instead it was a pastry made of mashed plantains and cream, which was a perfect way to finish our meal. For $20, we ended up with a huge amount of food for two people. We will definitely be going back to Los Planes.", "author": "Brian H."}
