But there are lots where you can pay an hourly fee/all day parking that are just a short walk to the picnic site. \n\nBring a few blankets to sit on, your own dranks, maybe a speaker that has volume strong enough just for your little area. \n\nA few people go around doing a $ polaroid service, which I thought was a nice touch.

I decided the hubby and I will just spend our Easter at Off the Grid's Presidio Picnic. It was a warm sunny day in San Francisco, so the picnic idea couldn't have been more perfect. We brought our camp chairs and picnic blanket, and parked ourselves on the lawn with an amazing view of the Bay which was dotted with sailboats and kite surfers. \n\nPresidio Picnic is the best OTG event and on Easter the attendance was almost to capacity. That huge lawn was filled with couples, families, and small and large groups of friends. People brought their dogs too. Make sure to bring a hat, and camp or beach chairs or a picnic blanket if you're gonna stay a while. People also brought their own or rented tents for shade from OTG. \n\nThere were lots of great food vendors that day, but we only got food from 4 vendors throughout the 4 hours that we were there.  We started with a plate of fried chicken from the Wing Wing Fried Chicken booth which we shared. Omg that was the best fried chicken I've had in a while! The hubby described it as flawless. All 4 pieces (wing, thigh, drumstick, breast) were moist, flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I was so surprised the breast was moist too. The chicken was crunchy without being heavily breaded. It was actually light. \n\nAn hour later, we each had a plate of the Lechon with rice and salad, and some lumpia from The Jeepney Guy. The lechon skin was crunchy and melt in your mouth goodness. That plate was enough to keep us satiated for a while. For dessert, we shared the Cookies and Cream sundae from Bi-Rite! It was just enough satisfy our sweet tooth. \n\nPresidio Picnic has a bar if you need some libations to go with your food. You can get beer, wine, Bloody Mary, Margaritas and Mimosas. I got a Margarita and it was really good. It's a little pricey at $12 but hey it's convenient. \n\nIf you want to get a good spot on the lawn and parking, get there early! The lawn filled up nicely after noon or so. The fancy port a potties were really clean, and the compost, recycling and trash bins were regularly replaced to prevent overflow. This is a very well run event, so I would definitely come back again for a picnic. I can't think of a better way to relax and people watch on a warm Sunday afternoon!", "author": "Hazel C."}

View of the bay was the icing on the cake.\n\nThe grounds were pretty packed with friends, families, pets (including a cute pot bellied pig named Prosciutto) and kids. People were relaxing in lounge chairs, on picnic blankets, or straight on the grass.  Everywhere I looked, people seemed to be enjoying themselves.\n\nThe FOOD TRUCKS.  Oh gosh what a great collection of options.  We walked around before making our decisions and finally decided on a few \"basic\" choices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-07", "description": "When people ask me what my favorite culinary experience is in San Francisco, I will often times not mention a restaurant (though Burma Superstar omg so good). Personally, one of my absolute favorite \"food\" things to do in the city is to visit the food trucks at Off The Grid; if I hear from friends that they've never experienced Bay Area OTG before, you bet I'm taking them there the next time I have a chance. \n\nIf you have ever heard of OTG before, Off the Grid is the Bay Area's very own \"food truck\" experience. All throughout the Bay, OTG will have different vendors (trucks) circulating throughout. From Sunnyvale (where I live) to Fremont, there's always trucks during different times of the year. Personally, my favorite Off the Grid has and will always be the one in San Francisco's Fort Mason - basically, for around like most of the year except winter, there's a HUGE block party every Friday near the Marina. There's always at least 15-20 different food vendors with music playing. \n\nRecently, I was able to share my love for OTG with my girlfriend at Presidio's Off the Grid (Presidio Picnic). It was actually my first time here at the Presidio Picnic and so I was pretty stoked. If I'm correct, Presidio Off the Grid is every Sunday during brunch time for most of the year. As the name suggests, this OTG is right at the Presidio (basically a park area next to the Golden Gate Bridge). Unfortunately, parking here can be rough since EVERYONE comes out (be it for the food or just to chill). And doubly bad, SF charges you for parking here. Unlike at Fort Mason, in which you can actually park at the lot or park on the street (weekends free), it's like $1.5 per hour/$8 full day and there's no alternative. Make sure you put that ticket on the dash! Also, I recommend bringing a blanket so you can sit and snuggle. Maybe also be bold and bring a tent. \n\nWhile Fort Mason OTG is all about partying at night with strangers in close quarters, Presidio OTG is definitely the opposite: here, you have a HUGE space to roam around and the atmosphere is much more chill-especially with kids and more doges everywhere. Unfortunately, there's probably half the number of food vendors. I counted around 7-8 really substantial trucks/tents for food, whereas the rest served drinks. BUT, luckily there's always a good turnout for reputable vendors. For example, Senior Sisig (omg, get this please) was there, as well as El Sur (their Empanadas are to die for). We ended up getting a burrito from Sisig (so good) and tater tots from Jackrabbit (not bad for only $5).\n\nThe beautiful thing about Off the Grid (especially the ones in the city) is the community component that gets injected into the food. Everyone knows that the Bay has the best, well-rounded people. But how do you bring them all together? Through food! At every Off the Grid, I always meet the coolest people. The Presidio is definitely no different. It's perfect for all ages. For example, if you are a child, there's little game areas for people to meet. There's even a tent with people teaching you how to bike. There's EVERYTHING!\n\nI have to give Presidio Picnic an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this.\" The experience is well worth it, especially if you are in the city for a day. Sure, there's plenty of amazing restaurants in SF, but there's few that really give you the \"hands on\" adventure that OTG does. If anything, come to Presidio Picnic for the view of the city and the calmness that is basking in the sun on nice grass!\n\nHave fun and prosper, eat well and prosper!", "author": "Bryan W."}

Occurring every Sunday during the summer and fall, Presidio Picnic may not be as large as OTG's signature event, but it's just as popular.\n\nIf you're familiar with any of OTG's pods/events, the list of vendors and food trucks might look somewhat familiar.  OTG staples like Curry Up Now and The Chairman may be absent, but the list of eateries is still extensive and varied - Grilled Cheez Guy, Del Popolo (pizza), Little Green Cyclo (Vietnamese), Cr\u00e8me Brulee Cart, El Porteno (empanadas), Nopalito (Mexican), The Whole Beast (BBQ), Reveille Coffee, Sam's Chowder Mobile, La Marcha (Spanish), and Slightly Skewed.  And those are just the ones I can remember!\n\nWhile the food is obviously the biggest draw, what really makes this particular OTG event so awesome is its location.  Posted up on the grassy lawn at the Presidio's Main Post, there's really no other food truck meetup that can compare.  On a warm, sunny day, it's the perfect spot to lay out a blanket, soak up the sun, and take in that gorgeous view of the bay in the distance.  Toss in some delicious eats and drinks and you just might start hearing Maroon 5's \"Sunday Morning\" playing in the background.\n\nAs picturesque as the setting may be though, sadly, Presidio Picnic isn't perfect.  Yeah, it sucks having to pay for parking, but there's always Uber/Lyft/MUNI.  Rather, the real knock is the lack of line control.  Maybe it was just the combination of the gorgeous weather and it being the first Presidio Picnic of the year, but the lines got ridiculously long as the day went on.  Already bad on its own, yet even worse when they started to snake between people's picnic spots, making it tough on everyone (maybe create a buffer zone?).\n\nAll in all, FOUR AND A HALF STARS is about right, but I rounded down (sorry!).  Still, lines aside, Presidio Picnic is an awesome (and free!) way to start your Sunday Funday.  Good food, good times, and plenty of good vibes to go around.  Plus, with the handful of alcohol stands dotting the picnic area, you can get an early start on the drinking to forget that you probably have that deadline for work on Monday!\n\nCHEERS!", "author": "Mike L."}

There's a wide selection that is sure to please everyone.  For example, while I was waiting for wood-fired pizza I stepped over to the Vietnamese food truck for spring rolls.

(I'd like to point out now that I also liked making fun of hipsters before it was popular. And yelp. I was on yelp back when most people were still using zagat). But there was a time when food trucks provided a generous quantity of tasty if unhealthy food cheap. You know, the whole no real overhead discount? At the Presidio Picnic, you won't find a heaping plate of fried food for $5, however. Be prepared to pay $10 for a small bag of tiny zeppole (which horrified my Italian American friend), which could alternatively have bought almost two dozen Krispy Kreme or even three giant (even more hip) Johnny's donuts. \n\nBut still, even if your belly feels a little unsatisfied, you can't beat that view.

I would recommend coming early as possible to get good parking and to avoid long food lines. \n\nI got there around 12 and spent 10-15 minutes looking for parking. We paid $6 for all-day parking which isn't bad at all. When we got there, the place was already packed. There are a lot of different food vendors and carts. I would recommend doing a walk through first of all the different food vendors before making a decision. :) \n\nPlaces I tried:\n\n--Sugarfoot Grits: This place had one of the longest lines. I wanted to try the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. I waited in line for about 20 minutes. When you place your order, you have to wait even longer for your food. I was kind of disappointed because 1) there is an additional wait time for you and it's pretty long, and 2) the biscuit sandwich was not worth the wait. I thought the biscuit sandwich would be the size of a \"regular\" biscuit...like the ones at KFC, Popeyes, or the Pillsbury store-bought biscuit dough. The sandwich was probably the size of half my palm and it really didn't taste anything special. Would not order this again.\n\nGirl Friday: Tried this place for their lemon ricotta donuts! Half a dozen donuts with a sauce of your choosing for $5. These are sooo delicious. You can't really taste the ricotta, but it was a really good donut. Super fried and the earl grey chocolate ganache with sea salt dipping sauce was amazing.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Cart: Yum!! We tried the SF Gold creme brul\u00e9e. They ran out of the chocolate cookie crumble, which is a topping that comes in the SF Gold, so we replaced it with graham cracker. I like this cart because it's different and the serving size is good. I would definitely try this. You can tell they use real vanilla beans because you can see the black specks in the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nTips:\n--Bring cash so that you can pay easily and get the line moving!\n--Bring a blanket so you can have a picnic on the lawn!\n--Bring an ice box/cooler with cold drinks.

My bf and I took the free PresidiGo shuttle from Embarcadero Transit Station straight to the event. Despite the mass of people and doggies, the lines were surprising not very long and went by extremely quickly. The food selection was huge and varied, the DJ played catchy music, and the entire lawn was filled with families who were either in tents, sprawled out on blankets, or running around playing games. It's very family-friendly, lively, and relaxing, with a beautiful view overlooking the entire Bay Area.\n\nThe premise kept clean throughout, with event workers educating and helping people sort their trash. Even the porta potties were beyond clean and quite fancy, where each stall was equipped with its own sink and napkin dispenser with a lot of room left to move around in. There were also ones equipped with up to 5 stalls in each trailer. Overall, the event was very well-planned and well-executed. \n\nBut most importantly, the food was to die for. My favorite trucks were The Whole Beast (smoked corn on the cob), Fine and Rare (oyster po boy), and Girl Friday Zeppole (zeppole with vanilla bean creme fraiche dipping sauce). The prices weren't outrageous and the food was definitely gourmet, or at least with unexpected but delicious twists. For people looking to get a little tipsy, there is a alcoholic beverage station in the middle of the lawn. Like I said, this place is family-friendly, good for kids, adults, and pets.  \n\nNote: bring blankets and jackets because the grass might be a little wet and the wind tends to pick up at times and temperature tends to drop, since it's by the water. Also bring cash, because some places are cash only (and trust me, you don't want to miss out on any food).\n\nI will definitely be back to try even more foods.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Parking in this area was tricky and hard to find so I parked by Crissy Fields and walked (yes it was far, 1.3 miles to be exact). Once I got there I was taken aback, the grassy area where OTG was located was extremely spacious and beautiful. There were TONS of food booths, about 5 food trucks, a bar and a DJ. This seemed like a good festival/party. I walked around to check out all of the food booths even though I knew what I was there to get.\n\nSome of the booths/trucks included Wing Wings, Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Cart, Fins on the Hoof and bubble bar just to name a few. I finally went to Sugarfoot Grits and ordered The Valencia ($10) which is cheese grits, organic greens and local \"crispy\" bacon. It was pure heaven, very much worth the walk and drive. I also went over to Wing Wings and had there fresh made fruit punch, it had a florescent pink color but was delicious, unlike any punch I've ever had. I sat on the grass to eat and drink while listening to the great music. It was so relaxing even though there were many people there.\n\nIf you are a big fan of OTG or just a foodie in general, this is a must and make sure to bring a blanket, football, frisbee or something to have more fun. It's perfect for the whole family to enjoy especially on a nice sunny day and you have a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Well, I don't - I don't know about you! My cousin hosted her birthday celebration here this past Sunday (9/13/15) and it was a lot of fun. It's the most casual meet up for a birthday anyone could have, and everyone's essentially in charge of whatever they wanna bring/order/eat, etc.\n\nAt this specific on off the grid, I shared all of the items I ordered.\n*I started with Nopalito - and ordered the totopos con chile y picadillo (house made tortilla chips, ground pork, potato, salsa, de arbol, cojita cheese, onion, cilantro and crema ($9) and totally shareable with at least 2-3 other people. This was pretty good! It seemed as if they sprinkled cheddar cheese on the chips, it kind of resembled doritos. \n\n*To wash it all down we went to Cholita Linda and had their agua frescas. The lady at the cashier was super nice and offered to do a mix of the two flavors they have. So she did half mango-passion fruit and half strawberry-lime --- so refreshing! It was a tad too sweet for me so I ended up adding about a fourth of extra water when I had the space ($3.50)\n\n*For dessert we hit up the creme brulee cart - they had the usual vanilla bean, dark chocolate, salted caramel and the chef's special which was bourbon butterscotch and nutella strawberry ($5/each) as well as other specialty flavors and bits and drizzles as additions (+$1). I had the vanilla bean and this was delicious - as expected! My mom had the salted caramel, it was way too rich, we ended up giving it to someone else in our party to enjoy. My friend got the nutella strawberry and she was basically having mouthgasms from first bite to her last - I think it was pretty good too, but I enjoyed the simplicity of the vanilla bean. \n\nMinus one star because I think they could've had more options, but other than that, a very enjoyable experience on one of the last Sundays of Summer.\n\nTips:\n-Bring cash if possible. Although most vendors do accept card, it's easier and faster to pay with cash\n-Bring your pooch!

We live very close and one time I went without my wife. I came back drenched, cold and miserable. My wife didn't even see a cloud.\n- Sunscreen - if the weather is good it is easy to sit, drink, eat and relax for a little too long in the sun.\n- Time - some of the food trucks (like the pizza one) can have massive lines. Make sure to come that little bit before you are hungry. Although there are still places where you can get a meal straight away.\n- Picnic blanket - there is no seating here, it is a giant chunk of grass. The grass is nice and soft, but it is nicer if you are sitting on something else.\n\nAdvanced:\n- Drinks - even though getting a Bloody Mary from the dude pushing around the cart is nice, paying $18 isn't. Grab some wine, beer or whatever from home. You can always grab something to try when you are there but it isn't super necessary.\n- Wind/sun shelter - what is it with parks without trees/shelter in this city? The wind up here can be pretty strong, plus you are sitting exposed for a long time while picnicking.\n- Sports equipment - there is free rentable stuff at a stall near the entrance.

Now I know lines and crowds are a given, but literally everything had almost a 45 minute wait. Since the main attraction is the food, I didn't mind the wait there as much, but these lines also carried over to the bathrooms. They had a little trailer with a total of 2 men's single stall bathrooms, 1 women's single stall, and a women's 3 stall. There was also a handicap private restroom, however, that one was quickly put out of commission. That means there were a total of 5 bathrooms for a crowd which probably reached at least 1,000 people, if not more. Everyone in line, including myself, nearly had an accident as we waited about 45 minutes to finally get to the front of the line. Not only is that ridiculous, but it is clearly a health and safety concern. I asked around to see if there were any other bathroom stations, and was told that these were the only ones. Very poor planning in my opinion. \n\nI'm not sure what sort of restrictions they put on this space, but I really hope they do something throughout the Presidio Picnic season to resolve these issues.

So, when my friends recommended going to the one in Presidio, I had just imagined a few food trucks in a street corner.\n\nBut it turned out to be like night and day. It was on a HUGE lawn in front of the Walt Disney Museum and there were aplenty of food trucks and ice-cream trucks.\n\nAfter walking around all the food trucks, we got Mediterranean shawarmas. The portions are huge and they were good.\n\nYou can bring your chairs or tents or even bring your own food and sit on the lawn, while enjoying the beautiful SF weather and watching the bay at a distance.\n\nTotally unique experience.

Many people were laying on the grass so be sure not to step on anyone or any animal!\n\nNot my first rodeo at an Off the Grid event, so I knew the lines were going to be long. Don't let the long lines ruin your experience (4 stars) and bring cash just in case. The vendors at this event was a perfect variation. Just to name a\nfew they had: The Whole Beast, Cholita Linda, Chotto, and Salumeria (sp?). Come early!!! Parking is a little challenging and some tents will run out of items on their menu. \n\nThe lines will definitely discourage you from experiencing many of the vendors; hence, I highly recommend to come with a group and fan out!

I had just watched their diners drive in and dives episode and my mouth was seriously watering as I was watching the episode on TV!

The food was good, I had the Shrimp Po Boy and my kids had burger sliders, veggie burger and fries.  Not a lot of options for the vegans like StreatFood Park has.

If you wanted to nab a cabana or a fire pit, now until maybe 5:15pm would be a good time to do it, as only a few were claimed with people's belongings. No one actually sat in the cabanas or fired up their pits until maybe 5:30 or 6:00. \n\nI was disappointed to see that there were only 8-10 food trucks present; not the entire lineup that was presented online. Of the few, I decided to get Koja (has never failed me), Kokio (who says no to Korean fried chicken?), and Pagan Fired Pizza (friend is obsessed with analyzing peoples' pizzas). OTG is a great place to grab tried-and-true goodies and check out some new ones too. \n\nThe fire pits and the cabanas are a nice touch to the event, but I did not stick around to enjoy either, as it was way too windy. This event is pet friendly, as evidenced by the 5-6 dogs I encountered on the field there. Live music started at around 6:00pm.\n\nOverall, the concept is great, but the food truck lineup was paltry and it was just way too windy that day to enjoy the space and the food.

I didn't notice a single person being an asshole which was refreshing.  Nice folks, respectful of eachother,etc.\n\n-  Parking can be a challenge.  If you go in one of the paid lots, it's $7 for the whole day.  I noticed many people cabbing/ubering in as the day went on.  If you live in the city, this is probably a great way to go\n\n- Bring a picnic blanket and chairs so you can relax on the lawn.  It can be a bit of a walk to the food trucks and we saw several people with trays to carry their food.  Not a bad idea.\n\n- Very family friendly, we saw kids from toddler age all the way up to teenagers.\n\n- Dog friendly but your dog has to be on a leash.  All the dog owners seemed to be very responsible with their pets (including us) so that was nice to see\n\n-  We froze our asses off most of the day so it's best to be prepared for all kinds of weather.  You're right on the bay\n\n-  There are two bars but they are very expensive for the amount of hooch you get so plan accordingly.  $10 for a small glass of wine, $5 for beers, and $10 for mixed drinks...not a bargain\n\n-  Our group tried a bunch of different food trucks and it seriously adds up money wise so if you have the space, it's good to pack some essentials like water and snacks for the kids to keep the cost down\n\n-  The crowd is a very good mix of people.  Tons of families, tons of hipsters, and all ethnicities and ages so nobody should worry about feeling out of place.  \n\n- I don't think it would be ideal for disabled people unless they have others who can carry the food, stand in line, etc.  Could be rough for someone to manage if they were in a wheelchair or needed to use a cane.", "author": "Jonathan A."}

This particular Off The Grid is one that I would definitely recommend people to visit because it's not like the other chains at all. First off, the view is absolutely beautiful and relaxing. You'll find families or friends scattered all over the Presidio lawn with their tents, picnic blankets, dogs (yes, this place is dog-friendly!) and more. You can even catch a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge! Your food trucks are lined up in an organized fashion along the sidewalk, making it easy to navigate through and find your desired entree.\n\nFrom seeing signs to looking up the information on their website, Off The Grid at the Presidio is open EVERY Sunday from 11AM - 4PM. We went here for one of my friend's birthdays and it is definitely a nice place to kick back on a sunny day. There is so much space for any party to sit down, but I would suggest bringing a ton of picnic blankets or towels! This OTG pretty much radiates those laid-back, \"kickback\" vibes similar to one of those family barbeques you have in your backyard or similar to a picnic at the famous Mission Dolores Park.\n\nI'm not sure if the food vendors switch every Sunday, but Off The Grid always contains enough variety with each visit. This Off The Grid has way more vendors, and thus food entrees, to choose from out of the rest of the chains. From being a previous fan of many Off The Grid places, my food experience was still over-the-top amazing. First, I went to a booth named \"Chotto\" and ordered Kimchi Fried Rice with Pork Belly and Gyoza. Though the fried rice felt like it was lacking kimchi, it was pretty flavorful rice that kept my stomach happy. The pork belly in the rice dish was excessively fatty, but I mean...it was pretty darn good. The gyoza was very delicious and came with a sweet dipping sauce. I finished all of my food before my friend even received hers, which pretty much gives you a good idea of how food the good is. Lastly, I went to a booth that sold \"Three Twins\" ice cream and I ordered the Mocha Difference. $3.00 for this cup of ice cream isn't a terrible deal in my opinion, but there was nothing spectacular about this ice cream brand. I would probably suggest ordering a different dessert to make your money more worth it, such as the Creme Brulee Cart.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time at Off The Grid in Presidio. I want to warn you that it IS going to be a bit pricey with any vendor that you go to, but the great quality of the food and the fun vibes definitely make it worth your money.

I walked to my friend's office near Embarcadero and requested a Sidecar. He got us there in 30. If you're a Presidio resident, you can take the PresidiGO shuttle for free.\n\nI loved the truck line up when I went: Bacon Bacon (my friend got a delicious breakfast burrito), Little Red Riding Truck (I got the Bratwurst with potatoes and sauerkraut, delicious!!), Casey's Pizzaria, Lobsta Truck, and others. We got dessert at Keep Rolling (Chimney Cake, a Hungarian dessert; the cinnamon one is like a churro) and hot spiced apple cider, A MUST! It was gloomy and windy, so the hot drink was perfect. They have other drinks too. \n\nThe most important stuff:\nOff The Grid at the Presidio + alcohol - DO IT!\nMUST: hot spiced apple cider\nDon't drive...parking is a nightmare.

The view is, of course, ridiculous. And, this being OTG, there was tons of great food to choose from. Lines got a little crazy, but that's to be expected at an event this size, and overall they did a pretty good job of moving people through.\nKudos to the drink stand as well. I was expecting nothing but beers, but they were also putting out some pretty solid mixed drinks (including a very yummy bloody mary). The music was a nice touch, and I liked the fact that it wasn't turned up to an obnoxious level (something that occasionally happens at the Haight OTG, depending on who's manning the music tent). \nDon't know if it was related to this event or not, but there was also a little Shakespeare in the park production going on nearby.

I enjoyed it but I prefer Off the Grid: Fort Mason better. I enjoyed the company of my friends and family, the beautiful scenery along the water, the concept of sunday funday picnic at the park with gourmet food, the weather was a bit windy but I didn't quite enjoy the food as much as I had hoped. \n\nFirst of all, i didn't know this event has more gourmet restaurants than regular food truck that we usually see. I was hoping to get my usuals like curry up now, sisig burrito, chairman bao, or bacon truck... however, they were nowhere to be found. The only familiar one was the creme brulet cart and the whole beast. Well, that was a bit disappointing for me... They also don't have as many food choices as OTG Fort mason. The food here is a bit pricey - 12 dollars for a lobster roll which was gone in 3 bites, 10 dollars for a single grass-fed lamb burger with no sides, 16 dollars for fried chicken (4 pieces)...\n\nThe food we got were pretty good. \n1. The grass fed lamb burger is super juicy - with feta cheese, wild arugula and pickled onions. It was a bit salty but very delicious (It's restaurant quality).\n2. The \"sausage\" pizza - gourmet pizza that was made on the spot (imagine the line...we waited for a decent 30 mins) was pretty popular. 14 dollars for 4 pieces. the dough was extremely soft and thin. good flavor. kind of stingy on the sausages and basil.\n3. Fried chicken - great seasoning, juicy and tender except a bit over priced! 16 dollars for 4 pieces.\n4. lobster roll - delicious but gone too soon... 12 dollars\n5. baby back ribs from the whole beast - tender and great flavor (not sure about the price)\n\nIt is a great space for such a fun event. Personally, I think it's more than enough to add on a live performance of some sort like how fort mason does it. It will add more fun to the ambiance and bring the light out of some \"still-drunk, hungover\" people.\n\nI think there's a lot more room to improve. Will I come here again? Yes.

I have turned many friends and family on to this event and my parents love to drive two hours from their home in Modesto just to meet us for an impromptu picnic by the Bay.  \n As other reviewers have stated: The lines are long.  VERY long.  When it is super busy, we've gotten in the habit of just going somewhere else, because we don't want to deal with the masses.  But, every so often we find the sweet spot of 2:00 p.m. as an arrival time because many of the attendees have already arrived and gotten their food, so the lines tend to be shorter.\n Also, as others have stated, BRING EVERYTHING.  We've gotten this down to a science.  In our garage I house a chest full of Presidio items: Blankets, sunscreen, hats, cups, napkins, plastic utensils, trash bags, hand wipes, etc.  I've ordered nice picnic chairs from Amazon.  I'm now looking into some sort of pop-up tent for shade.  Once you get comfortable, you're set.  \n I came last Sunday (Pride weekend) and the crowd was great.  The DJ was playing awesome 80s-90s music and the crowd was enjoying themselves.  The downside was the massive wind that was so bad we ended up leaving after only an hour there.  :(  But, that isn't Off the Grid's fault and it's just one of those gambles with picnics.  If you can be fluid and expect the unexpected, you'll be fine.\n\n Oh, I'd also recommend you bring cash.  The WiFi/Internet connections there are shaky, at best, and it doesn't help the lines when you're one of those \"I only bring a card\" people and find you suddenly can't pay.

We'll definitely be back.\n\nLocation/Atmosphere: 5/5. Can't get any better than this location! What an awesome view of the bay, and the Presidio is adorable with all of it's \"wait, are we still in San Francisco?\" charm. The atmosphere is casual and fun; there were people of all ages at this event. We didn't sit at a cabana or fire pit, but brought our own blankets and chairs to sit on. Although maybe next time, we'll come early and try for a fire pit. \n\nService/Lines/Parking: 5/5. Parking was easy, and free. The lines for the food trucks were moving pretty quickly--no complaints there! The event staff were really nice and helpful. The website says \"bring cash\" but all the vendors we went to accepted credit and debit cards as well.\n\nFood Trucks: 3.5/5. Decent selection, but not a lot of vegetarian, vegan, or gf options. I'm surprised, San Francisco! And some of the options that were \"vegetarian\" weren't *technically*--e.g. \"we fry the okra in the same oil that we fry this chicken in!\". Not a huge problem for me, but one of my friends doesn't eat meat, so we had to look around a bit to find her a good option.  Also, we overheard a parent who's child had some sort of fish allergy saying it was hard for her to find something for him to eat. The beer/wine/cocktail tent was great--and had a lot of options. However, the drinks were a bit pricey. $11 for a glass of wine--the selections they were offering were probably around $13/a bottle in the store.  \n\nOverall: I'd definitely go to this again! Next time, we will BYOB. If you're going and have any sort of food restrictions: maybe bring something to eat in case none of the food trucks have anything for you.

So, bring cash or use the ATM machine Off the Grid provides.

I was really looking forward to it since I have never been in this area. When we got there, I was a bit disappointed. At around 2pm all the lines were extremely long. The average wait time was about 45 minutes to an hour for food. I was really surprised that there weren't more food vendors for the opening. We ended up giving up on the food line and just ate the chips that we brought. I would definitely suggest bringing your own food if you're not trying to wait in line. The restroom line for the portable bathrooms took about an hour. Two of the stalls were broken so a ton of girls were waiting in the guys line. Later we found out that the restroom at Walt Disney museum were open. I definitely suggest taking advantage of that instead of the portable bathroom. Overall the vibe was really nice but the lines were just ridiculous.", "author": "Christina C."}

I thought there may be more than just 8 or so but it was still a good variety. There were mostly food trucks that we had no clue about so it was fun just picking one to line up for. The lines were LONG! at least 40 - 60 minutes wait. Our first stop was a food truck name BobCha. It is this Korean joint that had a mix of the American/Mexican culture. They had rice bowls, fries, tacos, burritos, etc. My friend ordered the bob burrito while I got the kimchi fries. The burrito was not too bad, not that exciting either though. It was basically the korean bulgogi beef plus rice and lettuce but the kimchi fries was DELICIOUS. It had kimchi, bulgogi, their home made hot sauce and melted cheese. It was savory and sweet. The meat + the sauce + the cheese really kicked the night off well. Great starter. Walking around with this big box of fries....people were all \"whoa...that looks good\" IT WAS YUMZZZZ.\n\nToday was a bit windy so it started up kind of chilly already. But whoa...as the night went on and the sun started to set, it just started to get freezing cold. Being in such open space, I would expect Off The Grid to have outside heat stands. I've been to the OTG in Fort Mason and they have live music and heat stands. I had similar expectations for the Twilight tonight but there was none. No heater, no music, and sadly not enough lightings! This is a disappointment because the banner on their website showed a lot of tents and lights and it felt so warm and bright. Really wish there was some music at least. \n\nEventually, we got so cold that we had to leave lol. Definitely an interesting area though. Maybe it is just be but I need Music everywhere lmao.

I've been meaning to try out the Presidio's Sunday Off the Grid, but I'm often away on the weekends and just hadn't had the chance (plus kept forgetting). But this Sunday I didn't feel like leaving the city, and a few friends and I did an urban hike from the Haight to OTG. \n\nIt was a beautifully sunny day, until we got our food and sat down. Then the clouds/fog rolled in and I was freezing. Of course, on the walk home, the sun was out again. Oh SF.\n\nBut anyway, now on to the important stuff. I really like this Off the Grid simply because there's so many options! There's a few of the usual suspects (ie. food trucks) but then there's also a bunch of tents set up where local restaurants sell their food as well. For example, I got the pork tamales from Nopalito's tent and they were great. When I ordered them, I actually didn't realize there was pork inside (and I don't typically eat pork). But once in my hands, they looked so great I ate them anyway - and wasn't disappointed! I also got an amazing kale salad from The Whole Beast - it had this lovely creamy dressing and was topped with whole peanuts. I usually don't like kale either, but this salad totally changed my opinion! Definitely a day for firsts :)\n\nThe picnic aspect is appealing too. At most OTG locations (like the one near my apartment in the Haight) there isn't enough seating and you end up standing around, trying to hold a drink and eat at the same time, and the venture usually ends with food on the ground or on the shirt. You also end up very cold, because it's in the evening, and we all know that SF is incapable of serving up a balmy night.\n\nBut here, you just bring along your blanket and voila, more seating space than could ever be filled! And sunshine! (Well, if you're lucky). But beware, there is a plethora of small children, strollers and dogs. So if that ain't your thing, watch out. \n\nOh, and they also have a row of port-a-potties which were very clean. Good job OTG!", "author": "Lindsey B."}

After about 3PM most of the vendors are running out of food so don't bother showing up around than because you'll be stuck with limited options. We ended up getting food at the Grille Cheez Guys and some mexican tent. Both were good, but in classic food truck fashion they used excessive amounts of butter and fat, which I am not a big fan of.

I wish there were more b/c there was so much lawn space in the back. Traffic and presidio being at the farthest corner of sf, we end up being late. Go early if u want the tent!! But we still caught the sunlight before it went down. It was actually a very nice day in sf! (Didn't freeze in a t shirt) Definitely love the location and that you can see the bridge and there's so much parking.\n\nLines were long but quick. You already know the drill. Totally worth the wait of course.\n\nComplaints: rude sf people... The lawn is huge, can't you find another place to sit instead of right next to us? The lawn didn't even fill up to every corner.

There are many places to just plop down and enjoy the event. Make sure to bring a blanket/chairs or be prepared to sit on the grass because there isn't any seating anywhere.

Located near the Walt Disney Museum, it can be a bit of trek to get to without a car (for those with a car there's a giant parking lot). \n\nReasons to love this: \n1. Large grassy area for picnicking; lots of families with cute kids and dogs running around \n2. Little red wagons selling bloody marys and beer\n3. Bins for composting/recycling/trash--- the inner environerd in me loves how this is just standard practice here\n4. The food! If you're in the mood for tacos, Cholita Linda is an excellent choice for fish tacos (2 for $8); the batter was light and I like that they use flour tortillas. They also accept credit/debit via Square!! Love it \n\nIf you're in the mood for nachos, hands down Napalito is the place to hit up; the chips are nice ad thick made from fresh tortillas, dipped in their housemade salsa and then topped with a generous sprinkling of cotija cheese. My friends and I inhaled them while waiting in line for other food and immediately came to the conclusion that we needed to get another order stat. \n\nAfter our tummies were nice and stuffed, we layed in the fresh grass and relaxed taking in the sounds of giggling children and feeling the cool ocean breeze against our skin. \n\nATM machine on this particular visit was broken, and the only sad part was when humphry slocombe ran out of most of the ice cream flavors later into the afternoon.", "author": "Leslie T."}

I'd wanted something sweet to finish it off and went with the cr\u00e8me brulee tent...bc sadly, the ice cream guys only had a lavender ice cream left, weak.  But my cr\u00e8me brulee with fruit was good.\n\nTrip #2 Sunday was better as it was much less crowded.  I made my way over to Popolu: the brick oven food truck.  It had the longest line around so naturally, I had to give it a whirl.  Limited menu...margarita pizza, a bianca pizza (no sauce, but includes mozzerella ricotta garlic and basil,) and then some other one.  all priced about $11-12, add $2.50 for stinking pepperoni!  after plopping down $25 for 2 pies, i will say it was a decent value, but wish they had more options for toppings...like fresh jalapenos! regardless, i loved the crust; super yum.\n\nall in all, worth the wait...which wasnt all that bad.  they take your order halfway through the line so by the time you're at the front, it's ready to go.  check um out for sure if you want a solid pie!!\n\noh and everyone else loved the pizza too, yay :)", "author": "Sara W."}

I like this OTG because they have cabanas and fire pits which was totally cute. The line up for food trucks isn't as extensive to the one on Fridays at Fort Mason. I don't remember the two trucks i made purchases at but it was pretty good. I just remember it was Asian fusion - one had steak cubes and the other had pork belly. Hmmmm pork belly... i will definitely come again - with more layers and more friends because this is definitely a neat spot to just kick it.", "author": "Kristina L."}

We got a good view of the Blue Angels, there was tons of parking, it was sunny, there was plenty of room and it was just an all-around great time.  It's great for kids, dogs, couples, families, seniors and everyone!\n\nThe food was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared a nice lunch consisting of a few things from different vendors.  We tried the cheese and baguette from one place and a sausage trio from another to have a little meat, cheese and bread lunch.\n\nI saw some vendors were selling alcohol, which is awesome!  We'll have to try the drinks next time.\n\n*Warning! Yes, some vendors take credit cards but make sure to bring cash just in case.  One of the vendors was having a hard time getting cell coverage to process our card.", "author": "Nic E."}

There's an ATM and plenty of places take a card, but wouldn't want to miss some great food for this reason!). We've always brought our own beverages, but there are also lots of options of delicious drinks to buy too. Great place to chill for a nice sunny Sunday Funday with friends.

This was my first visit to the Picnic.  Great setting.  Not enough trucks on this occasion - waits were pretty long and there was one truck, Smokeys, where it was over an hour to get a so-so tri-tip sandwich and they let the other part of the order get cold.  Sorry but you need to be prepared for the rush if you are going to do this!  Something was clearly not going right with that truck and I hope they fix it, the menu looked promising.  The 3 other trucks provided great variety but still they all looked very stressed, this was not representative of a good OTG meetup.\nWe enjoyed  the other vendors and stalls that were present, chocolate makers,  a few farms, cheese, the creme brulee (they also suffered a very long production process and we had to pass once it looked like another long wait).\nLots of dogs and most well behaved but I'd suggest some protocol be 'enforced' before its left to pepper spray and yelling.", "author": "Peter R."}

I got a pulled pork sandwich from Wexler that was dry and tasteless.  My BF got some oxtail egg thingy that was forgettable.  The only highlight was dessert.

Maybe it was the muggy weather or the high drink prices, but I thought something was missing.  Even though there was a decent selection of food, I was expecting to have many more food truck options.  I was looking forward to some Vietnamese tacos and cupcakes, but looks like either the trucks rotate or these options are at another Off the Grid location.  I also heard there was supposed to be music there but didn't hear that either.  There are two drink stations there (one on each side of the lawn) and they serve wine, beer, bloodies, and mimosas.  The drink prices are steep--expect $10 for a glass of wine.  I would say bring your own picnic with snacks and drinks if planning to stay for a few hours.  All in all, it's a great family and friends gathering space, but I would think twice about coming all the way here again.  Definitely bring your beach/lawn blanket and cash!", "author": "Tanichka B."}
