We got there around 9:30am and were seated right away. We both ordered the Vegan BB, which comes with soyrizo, black beans, sliced avocado, and potatoes; with salsa on the side.  Let me be clear, were not disappointed! The burrito is about 6\" long and pretty heavy. It has a nice balance of ingredients, and the salsa on the side is perfect for individual adjustment of spice.\n\nThe only negative feedback I could give was actually something my bc mentioned, which is that the yellow paint on the walls is a bit much. \n\nOther then that 5 stars!", "author": "Seumanu D."}

The atmosphere is home-y and quiet, almost like you're sitting in a grandmother's kitchen. \n\nThe vegan breakfast burrito at Sun Rise is probably my favorite I've had maybe anywhere thus far in SF. It comes loaded with potatoes, black beans, avocado, soyrizo and a side of homemade salsa. It's pretty hefty -- enough to fill my girlfriend and I up and hold us over until lunch time. \n\nThe vegan tamales here are also very good. They're moist and flavorful, perfect if you're craving tamales but having trouble finding vegan options. \n\nI love the menu at this cozy, casual spot and I'm looking forward to trying their other vegan options! Assuming, of course, I can ever bring myself to try something besides the breakfast burrito. \n\nGive this lovely, family owned and run restaurant your business -- you won't regret it.", "author": "Alex K."}

I am vegan and my partner is vegetarian, and we had multiple options. We ordered the vegan french toast and the vegan tofu scramble (pictured) and split it. The tofu scramble was amazing.. well-seasoned tofu with spinach, zucchini, tomato, onion, mushroom, and peppers. It came with some big homefries (about 1 cup worth), 2 slices of toast with an amazing strawberry jam, and was garnished with orange and apple slices (I also used the tapatio hot sauce provided yummm). The french toast was made with soy milk and came with diced fruit on top (apple, orange, banana, strawberry). This little hole-in-the-wall was a great find, especially after finding it tough to locate a vegan breakfast place in San Francisco that also offers multiple nut-free options. It can be frustrating being a vegan with a nut allergy, so I was extremely pleased to come here. The food was delivered in a timely manner and the waitress was attentive, kind, and accommodating (e.g. brought me soy milk for my coffee). Great place!", "author": "Whitney M."}

I noticed there's a sign on the door asking for donations to keep their business running. Their landlord raised their rent to $3,000 a month which is the equivalent of an extra $36,000 a year and on top of that the owner has to have surgery soon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-04", "description": "So I was with my children on the Day of the Dead celebration and by the time we got to the 24th Street Mission drag of the march we were famished.  Surprisingly it wasn't crowded and we took our seats and ordered their famous pupusa platters (thick deep fried handmade tortilla filled with, in our case, spinach.)  It took them a while to take our order and were even glacial in bringing-out the food. But once we started digging into the spinach pupusas we realized that it was well worth the wait.  The black beans were so tasty and salty and my family dipped their pupusas into the salty bean sauce as a sort-of dipping sauce - decadent.  Their curtido salad (lightly fermented cabbage slaw with red chilies and vinegar) felt light and healthy and digestibly spiced nicely.  The pupusas themselves? Tasty and above average but not phenomenal.  The biggest problem I had with the place was the price.  These platters would normally go for much, much cheaper in an authentic hole-in-the-wall central American restaurant in the mission district, probably 1/3 the price if you find a low rent family run operation.  We ordered three pupusa platters with, after looking at their prices on the menu, water... and it still came-out to $45.  We contemplated standing up and leaving because of the value restaurant impression bait-and-switch bit didn't.  The price may not seem so bad by normal standards I guess, but simply by the look of the place you thought good value/good food; looks can be deceiving.  So in a nutshell:  tasty but a semi-ripoff.  If they want excellent marks, and repeat customers, all they need to do is charge 6-something for your platters not 9-something.  But I have to give it to them: they have a lot of vegan options, serving breakfast all day, so props.  Also, the servers were nice.  \n\nThey squeak the third star because of their menu diversity but the restaurant pricing leaves a lot to be desired.  If you are a hole-in-the-wall, even a cute/clean hole-in-the-wall, on 24th Street, you need to price as such.  I can imagine that if we ordered drinks the bill would have been in the $60 range.  Their pricing removes it from the category of \"daily cheap-eat/frequent order\" restaurant like Poncho Villa burrito-like everyday food and places it in the rare special occasion restaurant category.\n\nNote to Management: Pupusas are not supposed to be pricey.", "author": "Khash C."}

When I first moved up to the Bay, coming to Sunrise reminded me of home cooked meals at my best friend's house in LA (beans, chilaquiles, burritos, plantains, oh my!) I never had a bad experience before today's visit -- and I could not be more bummed about it. First, the food itself tasted fine (we ordered chilaquiles and plantains) ... but it took a tortuous amount of time before our food came. \n\nWe arrived to a short wait (about 3 parties of ahead) and were seated after 15 minutes. We had a game plan (let's share chilaquiles and plantains so we can stop by Philz after) ... but no one came to take our order for over 10 minutes. (We were seated next to the register, so this isn't a \"you're seated in the corner and I will conveniently ignore you situation.\") Ok, that was weird, but I suppose the restaurant is busy. We order. \n\nAnd now the waiting game... I kid you not ... at least 40 minutes passed before we got our food. Now I've been trying to live a more zen life, where I don't do things like, stare at all of the plates leaving the kitchen angrily and anxiously hoping that they're mine -- and I didn't ... for the first 30 minutes. That last 10 minutes (or however long it was), I had run out of resources and boy, was I hungry and anxious to be fed. At the rate that they were serving food today, I really thought that 90% of their kitchen was not functioning. \n\nBut even then, it took forever to get our bill (even though most of the restaurant was gone by then...) and even longer to get our change. No sense of urgency from the staff and no basic customer service provided (\"how was your meal? Everything ok?\"). I can't say that the food is good enough to endure almost an hour of unnecessary, impatient, confused waiting.

Feels like mornin' in your eyes.\" As Norah Jones once stated in her eponymous song, I'm pretty sure she was talking about Sun Rise Restaurant when she harmonized those beautiful words.\n\nI can't think of a better way to wake up when you are craving a delicious Vegan Mexican inspired breakfast. I can't believe I had this place bookmarked for nearly a year before my sweetie and I had the chance to sample the soyrizo-fueled goodness.\n\nThey don't only specialize in south of the border dishes. I had their Vegan French toast on my mind for quite some time since I first browsed their menu online. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sun-rise-restaurant-san-francisco-2?select=EBX4ZIu43NiGocJSaJ-poA#VG81GjehrQ28oFRGfzSSdA I can't remember the last time I had a Vegan French toast in a restaurant. My only experience is with the homemade variety. I have to admit this one is more authentic than my homemade version, if less substantial. I feel I've gotten used to the heavily battered Vegan version, thus I prefer it. (Sidenote: I know I just created myself some work because my girl knows I can make French Toast now) Not saying I wouldn't order this again. Just saying don't come here expecting to get full off this alone. I would like to see them use a thicker bread to make the French Toast.\n\nIn fact, skimpy portions seem to be par for the course here. This tofu scramble looked downright meager. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sun-rise-restaurant-san-francisco-2?select=EBX4ZIu43NiGocJSaJ-poA#HcA_Y3RfmtezxAfHpifJ_w I think I'm used to seeing huge plates served for breakfast/brunch that it's a bit disappointing at first. In the end, after finishing it all, we were quite fulfilled without being stuffed to the brim. I can't hate on a restaurant that is trying to look out for my girlish figure... What I CAN hate on is the flavor. Much more bland than most I've had. It wasn't terrible but if you're gonna choose quality or quantity, you need to choose at least one of them. \n\nI was hesitant to order their full soyrizo plate, believing it was the usual stuff you'll find in TJ's or Whole Foods refrigerator section. We got a side order to go with the scramble. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sun-rise-restaurant-san-francisco-2?select=EBX4ZIu43NiGocJSaJ-poA#eug8ozm5p1p5r-jpilXZdw I'm glad we did because it ended up being the best thing on our table. Nicely spiced and quite homemade looking. I'll certainly opt for the full plate with beans, rice, & salsa next time.\n\nTheir Mr. Espresso coffee is seriously \"wake the heck up\" strong. I'm sensing \"espresso\" isn't just a moniker. I normally drink my coffee black. That wasn't happening with this one. I had to make liberal use of the soy creamer provided. \n\nService was really good except for the fact she couldn't deduce that we are Vegan based on our order. She brought out dairy cream with the coffee. No harm as we asked her and she apologized while bringing the soymilk. I just figured with the amount of hipsters that come through here, she would know by now. Over all, the service was actually really good.\n\nWith a breakfast burrito on their menu, we'll be back to try that as well as the soyrizo plate. If that's as good as I'm thinking, consider this a full 4/5 star review. Until then it's 3.5 for now, but I feel like rounding up today.", "author": "John B."}

Although I suppose you can make the argument that they are akin to an ancient Mayan pizza (move over, Naples!). Basically, pupusas are a thick and crispy pan-fried masa tortilla stuffed with meat/cheese/veggies. I'm a huge fan of the loroco (a slightly bitter-tasting flower) + cheese as well as the revuelta (mixed) pupusas. Definitely order 2-4 of these as a side dish to share.\n\nI usually don't order vegan at restaurants but their soyrizo is actually quite good. The odd thing is that they serve the vegan breakfast burrito on a huge plate with just a side of salsa. Really makes the burrito look smaller than it is and they definitely waste a lot of precious plate real-estate. Wish they would also serve some side salad or avocados with their burritos!\n\nIt's usually easy to get a table for 4 on weekends without much wait, but you end up losing that gain due to their slow service/long cooking time.", "author": "Arushi S."}

The only thing keeping me from giving 4 stars is because the place is small, decor is not great and could be done so much cuter.  However, the food was very good.  But I try to reserve my 4's for places that really, really impress me.  I was definitely impressed - but not wowed.  : ) We went for breakfast on New Year's Day.  We had to wait about 20 min to be seated (3 of us).  Service was good - bringing food out however, was a little slow.  With all that said, here's what we ordered:\n\n1. Huevos Rancheros - this dish came with black beans, queso fresco (would have liked a slightly larger piece) and steamed tortillas on the side.  The slightly fried tortilla that came under the eggs was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal.  It was slightly fried, not soggy at all and gave the dish a really nice flavor and texture.  l also liked the fresh and pleasingly light sauce and cheese that they placed on top of the eggs.  It wasn't too tomatoey - which I liked.  Sometimes when I've ordered at other places it tastes like they poured a can of diced tomatoes on top - but not here.  Sauce was nice and had good flavor.  We also ordered a side of fried plantains which went really well with this dish - so - go for it!\n\n2.  Chilaquiles - had a bite of my daughter's meal and I have to say..it .tasted WAY better than it looked.  Yummy chorizo flavor and overall just really tasty.  She ordered a side of avocado and fried bananas and seemed to enjoy this addition to the meal.\n\n3.  Horchata - we all got the horchata to drink.  It was good, nice and cold from the ice.  A little sweeter and less \"spicy\" than most horchatas but good.  Spicy isn't really the word I'm looking for but those who drink horchata probably know what I'm trying to get at.  We had coffee too - which was fine.\n\nWould definitely come back for either of these breakfast meals and everyone who worked there was very nice and accommodating.", "author": "Rachael C."}

Apparently it flopped. Apparently a version is coming stateside anyway. \n\nThe takes & jokes & quips tapered off, and I realized I hadn't eaten.

The egg, my God. It's as if they carefully scooped a slotted spoon into a classic cookbook and retrieved the poached egg attempted by students for centuries, and placed it upon the aforementioned delectations arrayed atop the English muffin. Perfect in form, exploding from the fork's touch onto the tower of luscious food, the egg beheld itself, and it was good. \n\nSun Rise's house potatoes are similarly the pinnacle of house potatoes, each bite-sized chunk perfectly crisp, but not dark, seasoned just so, and as fluffy inside as a mashed angel. \n\nI ordered a side of black beans to dip the potatoes into.

On our last day we wanted to have a good breakfast for our long journey home. Being Salvadorian my parents wanted to have the typical Hispanic breakfast eggs, beans, cheese, and all that good stuff. Thank god I was able to find Sun Rise on Yelp. \n\nTheir place was small, nice and cozy. Their service was a bit slow but then again it was a Sunday morning and only one waiter. But from the beginning the service was excellent. The waiter being Hispanic herself and most of the people eating there were white she made my parents and family members feel comfortable by speaking Spanish to them. \n\nAll of us were satisfied with our meals. I ordered huevos con chorizo and a side of platanos and it was delicious!!  My mom ordered a mushroom omelet which was also very good. We also ordered a quesadilla, a salvadorian sweet bread which had a different taste to it then a typical quesadilla but was still really good. \n\nOverall my family and I enjoyed our meal and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic central American meal!", "author": "Nidia E."}

The over easy eggs are solid enough to be transported into a fresh tortilla, where it can then be broken for the yolk to trickle throughout the self-made taco; the slab of crumbly homemade cheese is subtly yet powerfully salty; the plentiful black bean & rice mixture provides a gluing foundation that holds the other fillings together; and the slightly spicy salsa only enhances its companion ingredients.\n\nBe sure to pack each tortilla to capacity, since the filling to tortilla ratio is overwhelmingly in favor of the fillings.

Arriving before 11am, we found a parking spot right in front AND there was no wait for a table. Half an hour later, there was a line out the door!\n\nI had scrambled eggs, pancakes and bacon. One friend had vegan breakfast with \"vegan chorizo,\" and commented that the hot sauce that came with it could have killed her. Our other person had tofu with pesto, and a bagel with cream cheese. This place has something for everyone!

Chilaquiles, by the way, are typically crispy tortilla wedges cooked in a mildly spicy red or green sauce, then mixed with (usually) scrambled eggs, some sort of cheese (queso fresco here), and often times one might see lettuce, shredded meat, and/or beans. Here, they are served with just eggs, cheese, and a bit of chorizo.  \n\nThankfully,the mark it was met. The chilaquiles were slightly crispy, mildly sweet and salty (a good salsa), with a hint of chorizo, and generous eggs. I ordered it with a side of beans for old times sake, and they partnered with them quite well. Paired with a hot cup of coffee this couldn't have been better. The Huevos al Gusto my friend ordered were good too, with the plantains tender and sweet. A winner as well.

Somebody ordered the mushroom omelet and we spent the rest of our breakfast trying to describe how disgusting it was, wishing we didn't taste it. \n\nI was revolted. It was like, as if I was giving a BJ to a mushroom. And then the mushroom had climaxed and squirt tons of little spores into my mouth. And then spores tried their hardest to impregnate my tongue. \n\nThat's how bad this tasted. \n\nI even offered a friend $20 cash to finish it off. HE DECLINED.\n\nWe were the only four people in the restaurant, and even then we got ZERO service. The waitress took our order, and that was all that we saw of her for the next 45 minutes. No refills on water. Nothing. We had to get up to get her attention. Once to get the check. Once again to pay. And even when we paid, she wouldn't split the check among our cards, forcing us all to pay on one. Next time, I suggest that if you go here with more than one person that has a card, you all sit at different tables. \n\nActually, I don't suggest you go here at all. \n\nP.S. After we reasoned that there is some possibility they didn't know they were serving their customers spoiled mushrooms, we thought it'd be a nice gesture to tell them.

Rotating the platter to begin my quest afresh, I tuck in again from the new angle AND......... still no eggs, still no chorizo.\n\nI attempt to catch the waitress's eye to no avail. She was too busy serving some damned fine looking breakfasts WITH eggs and damned fine looking eggs they were. Oh, and what is that on that young fellow's plate??? It's my missing chorizo!!!\n\nI give up. I surrender. I retreat to the cash register, pay my bill and exit the door to check the menu in the front window, hoping, praying the folks in the kitchen mistook me for some overgrown, very tall, very Texan vegetarian and served me their vegetarian version of chilequilles. My heart sinks as I read the veggie version contains black beans. Whole or mashed, you ask? Why I would have no idea since the special Texas vegetarian version not listed on the menu contains nary a trace of a bean of any stripe, not a single one, zilch, nada, none nestled anywhere among that vast plate of chips.\n\nThere is always a first time and a last time for me. Rarely do the two coincide. At the Sun Rise Restaurant, that rarity became reality.", "author": "John A."}

Their menu showed a great variety and typical Latino breakfast items that my mom enjoys; she opted for the Huevos Rancheros which she hasn't had in months.  She really enjoyed the ranchera sauce, plantains, casamiento, and the quesito fresco.  So simple, yet so delicious.  I chose the Huevos a la mexicana which was scrambled eggs with bell pepper, tomato, and onions; the plate came with a side of black beans and queso fresco.  So yum!!

Unfortunately, sometimes friends have conflicting tastes.\n\nA sweet charmer had some business to attend to at Philz, so after I wandered around the Mission for a while (hello Aquarius Records!), we reconnected and aimed ourselves toward breakfast before hitting the road for lands southern. As it was right in the neighborhood and highly esteemed by a friend, we stopped at Sun Rise Restaurant for a bite.\n\nBeing in the Mission, I decided to do as the Missionaries do. That is to say, I ordered a Mexican breakfast with eggs, black beans, corn tortillas, queso, and salsa. She ordered a tuna melt with fries, not being in the mood for breakfast.\n\nMy food was passable. Unremarkable, and certainly not bad, but passable. Her sandwich smelled like the tuna had come from a can opened and left on the counter the previous day... and the tuna was completely ungarnished. Hint, folks, a little mayo or something? The fries, well, let's just say that multiple impotence references were made. Greasy, salty, and completely flaccid. No, really, I've seen dead fish with more rigidity and structural integrity. After finishing what we were going to eat of our meal, the waitress ignored us, making it difficult to pay our bill and leave. I eventually went up to the counter to pay there.\n\nWe left wandering what the appeal of Sun Rise is. Perhaps the vegan options are their strength. Perhaps we were there on amateur cook day. I'm not sure, but neither of us was impressed. So I don't plan on going back to Sun Rise. But that's OK, I'll keep my friends.", "author": "Paul B."}

But I digress. \n\nThe food here was fair to midland, but what killed me - and why I doubt I'll find myself back there - was the service.

Inside the burrito was soyrizo, roasted potatoes, avocado, and black beans. For some reason when reading the menu I thought the roasted potatoes, salsa, and avocado came on the side, but they were inside. At first I was disappointed because I just had a burrito on a plate and nothing else, but once I realized they were inside of the burrito I was fine. Not the restaurant's fault... I blame a certain Seattle vegan restaurant who's breakfast is enough food to feed a giant for tricking me into thinking I need that much food. I'm a small lady, not a beast, so a burrito is just fine thank you! \n\nMy boyfriend got the vegan french toast and a vegan tamale which he said was the \"best vegan tamale ever.\" I tasted it and it was very good.

It's a smallish, home-y, family-run type of brunch spot, in the heart of the mission on 24th, right across the street from Phil's Coffee. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have known about it either, but my boyfriend used to live right above it, and he was the one to actually discover it. \n\nSunrise is one of those places that offers a standard brunch menu with a Latin American twist, and frankly, it really works for them. They make great pancakes, and you can order them with fresh strawberries or bananas. I've also enjoyed the vegan chorizo scramble several times, and while I'm generally not big on fake meat, their vegan chorizo (or, \"soyrizo\" as some call it) was truly a cut above most of the fake meats out there.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the most note-worthy item on their entire menu is the Fresco de Chan, listed under the beverages...it's this incredibly refreshing fruit drink, and I don't even know what to compare it to...it's a bright fuchsia color, it's full of little floating seeds, and it has a slightly gelatinous texture to it, and sort of a \"tropical\" sweet taste...sounds odd, I know, but trust me, it's DELISH! We could never figure out what the heck it was made out of, so we finally asked our server one morning, and she told us it was just the juice of a popular Salvadorean (?) fruit (for which she could offer no English translation).

My omelette came with perfectly-cooked hash browns and buttered toast with what I believe was home-made strawberry jam. My only real complaint about my order was it came with a few pieces of fruit, and all of them were overripe and kind of yucky.

Even more shocking....the little place was near empty at 6pm on a Sunday!!\n\nThis is definitely my kind of place. We are both vegetarians and have exhausted our list of exclusively vegetarian restaurants in this city. Especially in the Mission. So, every once in awhile we come upon a place that has a pretty extensive vegetarian menu and dive in this new one, head first! There are even a handful of vegan items such as vegan chorizio and tofu. There are even corn and rice pupusas for those with celiac / gluten intolerance. Their house hot sauce (Tapitio) is also gluten free\n\n\nOverall, there are so many types of options from breakfast, (starting @ 7 am and served til\" closing ) Tofu pesto, eggs benedict,, 3 different vegetarian omelets. The usual type of fare....Chilaquiles, Huervos Rancheros or Al Gusto if you prefer. Pancakes, toast, fruit , granola, eggs florentine, eggs duchess..... There are still sandwiches , salads and for dinner you can get the New York steak for 14.95. Their highest priced dinner on the menu. There is so much variety I could go ON, ON and still ON!!! Camarones, Tilapila, Milanesa.\n\nFor this particular dinner, I chose a cheese and spinach pupusa and I think it may have been the best damn pupusa I have ever had in my life. For one thing, I ordered a rice pupusa and was not charged extra. Another, they were extremely generous with both potion sizes and better ingredients used. Many, many other pupusa to choose from too...\n\nBoth food and beverages are priced quite well.  \nBreakfast & 2 pupusas = $11.50\n2 beers & 1 coke =          $7.00\n\nTwentyish with a nice tip came to \n$30.00..... Not too shabby\n \n\nOne more cool thing....Every 2 months the owner participates in the 2nd Saturday art walk and the walls of the restaurant are covered in eclectic art, all by local artists. This restaurant is very cute, clean and simple but with a very homey and comfortable feeling.\n\nEmbarrassingly enough I did not get the owners name but she was our food server as well.

The crowd is unassuming and I like the tables by the windows because the sun comes in and warms you up as you watch passerbys on 24th. A comfortable and comforting place.", "author": "Chris L."}

However, it seems that the quality of the food is gradually on decline.\n\nFor example:  A few weeks ago, the lettuce on my salad was starting to rotten.\n\nOn different days:  My pancakes had a sour taste to them. My chilaquiles had been salty to the point where I could not enjoy them.\n\nI have noticed that they have a loyal clientele on weekends.  Mostly local families of 4 or 5 per table.  However it seems that the owner does not realize this because she has not hired a helper and there is no way that two cooks and herself can run the business alone on weekends.  You can easily be waiting 20 minutes for her to take your order and another 35-45 minutes to get your breakfast.  It is also a task to get coffee refills.\n\nI really do hope this place improves.", "author": "Carlos M."}

It was probably around 1pm on Saturday, and we were seated right away. This place is a mix of latin American and American food. There were a lot of egg options and some vegan options too, for you vegan people. I noticed they even have vegan French toast. Both of us had the huevos al gusto, which I thought was an egg scramble or an omelet or something, but it wasn't (I liked it anyway). Honestly, I picked it because it was the only thing that had plantains in it (although you can order them as a side). You get laid out separately on a plate: two eggs, made whatever way you want, plaintains, fresh cheese, sour cream, salsa, and some yummy beans and rice (that beans & rice was soo good). Plus a side of 3 hand made tortillas to eat them with. I didn't have a big appetite and by a little after the first tortilla, I was getting full, but I pulled through and ate almost everything. Roomie ate all of his and felt hungry still. He liked it, but felt maybe it was a bit too homestyle for him, like we could have made it. I reasoned that we probably could, but when do we ever make beans & rice, or fry up some plantains? Never. He conceded my point. We both did enjoy the dish and prices were very cheap ($8 for that egg dish), it cost about the same for 2 breakfasts here as it did for half a dozen donuts up the street. Service was friendly, and there were other things I'd definitely try. The one thing neither of us liked was the chai. It was too sweet, it tasted like it was a mix. I couldn't finish it. There was no spiciness, no bite, although they did make it with soy for us. Do go there, do try the yummy food and friendly service, don't order chai. Oh, and I think they serve breakfast all day, but not only breakfast. There is regular lunch/dinner food here too, I should have tried their papusas.", "author": "Merredith L."}
