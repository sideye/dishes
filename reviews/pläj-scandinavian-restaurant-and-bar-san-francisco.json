From the bread and leek dusted butter (only two pieces of bread so order it with that in mind) to the burrata, cauliflower soup, duck, swedish meatballs and rhubarb strawberry pie. Everything was honestly perfection. I am excited to say that I've now tried Scandinavian cuisine. \n\nAnd it stops there. I thought it was just me. But my three dining mates agreed. Our server was cold after she greeted us. Mainly she seemed annoyed with us. We asked normal menu questions (ex. Is gioja a food or place?) and her response was in a tone suggesting we should have known. We just felt overall that she was not happy to be there. Yes, it was busy, and we understand timing would be slow, but her vibe turned us off. \n\nFor the amount we spent (worth it for the food) the four of us agreed we deserved a better experience.", "author": "Meredith R."}

The food was fantastic and I loved every dish we tried. The drink menu was spot on. Our server on the other hand was a disappointment. She was rude and passive aggressive. We sat for almost 15-20mins before she even came to the table while others were already starting their meals (and they got seated after us). She made it seem like we were a burden to her. My friend had been here a number of times and apologized and the service isn't normally like that. She even mentioned something to the host on the way out and he was fairly dismissive. Still the food was spot on. Quite honestly if the server was even slightly better I would have given 4 stars. I'd be willing to give the place another try to see if the server we had was a fluke or if this is typical behavior.", "author": "Dara M."}

The restaurant is darkly romantic with cool lighting and comfortable seating. The waitstaff is pleasant and the food is generous and out of this world. The caviar was a pipe it yourself on blinis, the oysters were fresh and delicious with the sauce, the smoked salmon with bread crumbs was out of this world. And the main of Swedish meatballs and venison with fruit sauce was truly exceptional. If things couldn't get any better, they had my favorite dessert- princess cake. Truly exceptional food, every dish was executed perfectly, well balanced and pushed the boundaries in creativity and flavor combinations.

Enter through hotel and walk all the way back to a really dark, no windows at all, cave. This is the perfect place for that secret rendezvous.  You can whisper sweet nothings to your date and no one will ever see.  \n\nBut let's talk about the food. Menu has three options.  A small plate, medium plate and then the main entree.  We ordered one of each and shared between the two of us.  \n\nStarted with kohlrabi and beet with water cress salad.  Then a pickled herring plate with knacke brot, cheese,  onions, plus more.  Main was meatballs and mashed potato.  Each dish was excellent and really brought out Scandinavian flavors with dill and lingonberry.  \n\nFor desert they had quite a few options.  Hard to choose but tried the chiffon cake with marzipan topping.  It was delicious!  \n\nService was great.  I appreciated them asking if we had show tickets and needed to leave by a certain time.

We dined here soon after it opened and I can't remember what we had, but I know we had an amazing experience. In fact, we thought I wrote a review about that dinner, but it looks like I didn't. \nWe started off having drinks at the bar. The cocktail list is always amazing. One of the most creative cocktails lists I've seen (attached). I mean, honestly, when was the last time you saw Mustard, Dill, Beets and Sorrel as ingredients in a cocktail?\n\nAll the menus, including the cocktail list change frequently (even their website doesn't have the most up to date menus), but I remember that even on our first visit the cocktails and the food was just superb.\n\nAfter trying 5 cocktails on the list, we were a bit too tipsy to go anywhere else for dinner, so we just stayed here. Justin, our bartender was fantastic. Makes great cocktails, he's super friendly and nice and a very intelligent guy; a treat to chat with. \nThis is the first time I think we've ever had Aquavit in any cocktail. Justin let us taste aquavit on its own. Very interesting, Scandinavian liquor, similar to vodka or gin, but has more flavor and it's a bit spicier.\n\nThe homemade bread with the homemade butter was a great way to start dinner, to soak up the alcohol. It was so yummy that we ordered another round of it. Some of the menu photos are older here, the new menu is a bit different.\n\nFor appetizers we had the Smoked Ricotta filled Beets and Kohlrabi with Watercress and Hazelnuts. I thought it was a very creative idea for a salad and it tasted lovely. We also had the Broccolini, but that was just as good as anywhere else. It looks like the preparation of broccilini is rather similar everywhere, with chili garlic oil, but that's fine with me. \n\nFor the entrees we had the King Salmon with Chanterelle Mushrooms, Asparagus and Fennel topped with a Mussels Cream Sauce. OMG! It was to die for. Again, fantastically creative pairing of ingredients and amazing flavor. It just melted in my mouth while blowing my mind. Probably the best salmon dish I've had in America. \n\nWe also had the Braised veal Cheeks with Cauliflower, Morels and Fingerling Potatoes. I have never had such well prepared, moist and soft and delicious veal in my life. The accompanying sauce was fantastic and complemented the dish superbly, Maybe the creativity here wasn't as mind-blowing as with some other dishes, but it was an amazingly flavorful dish. I just wish we could have tried some of the other entrees on the menu.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Strawberry Rhubarb Pie with homemade Bay Leaf Ice Cream. Hello!! Did you read it right?? Yes, you did!! Bay Leaf, the nasty little hard leaf, the spice you often find in soups and sauces that they accidentally forgot to remove. I'm telling you, this is where creativity kicked in again. You wouldn't even think of having bay leaf ice cream, would you? Well, it was the perfect pairing for the Strawberry Rhubarb Pie. It balanced the sweetness with its tart, but refreshing flavor. \n\nI just can't praise our experiences enough here. Both times we were beyond satisfied and happy. Highly recommended.", "author": "George M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-30", "description": "Wow... how have I never heard / come to this place?  One of the most colorful and tasty dinners I've had!\n\nVenue / service: located at the back of Inn at the Opera, the vibe inside is that of an upscale bar without any of the drunken rowdiness.  Dark woods and walls add to this vibe, and we were seated on bench seats along the wall.  Servers were pretty prompt at refilling wine/ cocktail / water glasses, and would give an ETA on food once in a while if there was any particular gap.  \n\nFood: for us at least, we loved the bold flavors of every dish we had!  We mainly went with what the waiter said were favorites / popular dishes\n-- Taste of Herring: saffron, mustard dill, grandma's classic ($19) - luckily I like herring and other strong tasting fish, but probs not for those who aren't a fan of that.  There are two pieces of herring per sauce / condiment, so great for sharing between two people.  My favorite was probably the saffron for its more subtle flavors, though my friend liked grandma's classic better.  \n\n-- Blodpudding: bacon lardons, apples, lingonberries ($16) - surprisingly one of our favorite dishes of the night, and I usually don't like blood sausage.  However, this one is a little light in terms of blood flavor and texture, and this is probably because of the lingonberries, which add great acidity and brightness to the dish.  Textures were great in the dish too!\n\n-- Saddle of Elk (pumpkin, chanterelles, roast shallots, brussels sprouts, huckleberry)($38) - my friend ordered this entree and cooked to medium rare as recommended.  Elk tends to be a bit gamey, though we didn't mind this and a bit on the chewier side.  However, the gaminess worked well with the earthy brussels sprouds and chanterelles, and the huckleberry was enough to cut the richness without making the dish too sweet.  Lot of meat given.\n\n-- Braised Duroc Pork Cheeks (broccolini, grilled spring onion, quince, pickled mustard)($30) - my favorite dish of the evening; I ordered this as my main after the waiter recommended it.  The texture is similar to shortribs- super tender and falls apart easily without dissolving and not too fatty.  Kinda weird how you can't see it at first underneath all of the broccolini and other veggies, but that pork cheeks were very tasty!  Quince and mustard work well to counteract the richness of the cheeks and lighten up the dish.  \n\n -- Sorbet (black currant, strawberry, coconut) with Meringue ($9) - light refreshing way to end the meal; we ended up liking the strawberry the best.  Black currant was good too (tasted like sweeter grapes).\n\nAlong with two glasses of wine each ($17 per glass), we both paid little under $110 per person, or ~$75 per person without drinks.  On the slightly expensive side, but the quantity and quality of food made it worth it.  A must try if you are in the Hayes Valley area!", "author": "Audrey H."}

Everything was delicious but-my girls' gnocchi had nettles with them and they were very bitter. It was a tough dish. I wish the waiter had mentioned that to us. My potato pancake dish was amazing and I'd order that again and again. Delicious and light yet a meal. \n\nThey had great cocktails too- I enjoy sparkling wine so the Tulip spoke to me but my friend had the \"Plajer\" and has bourbon that was SO smooth!(Four roses) Truly a great cocktail!

Here it's cozy, welcoming and really, are they going for the \"hygge\" that Denmark is so known for? or maybe it's just the dim surroundings?\n\nIt could be the sophisticated dishes that come out of their kitchen that still manage to wow me over the years. Small plates that are meant to be shared, such as the smoked fish croquettes, taste of herring and beet cured gravlax, really showcase the amazing talent of the chefs with seafood. For your main entrees, get the classic Swedish Meatballs or be adventurous and try the saddle of Elk: scrumptious MMMeat that's so tender and flavorful. Rustic, elegant and seasonal, this place manages to effortlessly combine Scandinavian flavors with California flair. I love it. \n\nDespite the well picked wine list, I always find myself ordering a cocktail or two. If still on the menu, get the Garden of Sweden or for the ladies, a nice Elderflower Gimlet. \n\nScandinavian restaurants come far and few in between here in the city, but Pl\u00e4j checks off all the boxes when it comes to food, ambiance and service.

I probably wouldn't order it again just because there were sooo many other interesting items to choose from. \nThe only negative part of our experience was when we fiat walked in... we waited quite a while before we were greeted and someone who as probably expediting rudely said \"out of the way\" as he pushed himself by.

Couldn't really taste the leek dust with all the butter, however.\n\nThe smoked fish croquettes tasted quite nice without being overly breaded or oily. Their bite-sized shape helped manage the richness of the smoked fish - larger croquettes would have been a bit too rich.\n\nThe elk tartare had a creamy texture, and the included rye crisp seemed extra flavorful and crispy.\n\nI liked the swedish meatballs (who doesn't?) but I found the gravy and and potato puree lighter that I would like.\n\nThe seared scallops tasted like, well, seared scallops from any modern restaurant.

Was a little confused coming up to the hotel lobby. It was pretty dead.. and as the boyf said, \"it looks and FEELs like a hotel restaurant,\" i.e. rather generic. Seems like they could have played up the Scandinavian decor more, since their cuisine is so different. Apprehensive at this point.\n\nWe started out with cocktails -- loved our Fawlty Towers and Copenhagen. Great intriguing cocktail menu.\n\nWe had a tough time ordering since we were so unfamiliar with the ingredients and flavors on the menu. However, our waiter gave us some pretty good guidance I think and we ordered some of his recs.\n\nFresh baked bread with caramelized butter and leek dust: I'm a sucker for warm break and flavored meltable butter, and this was a great start. Hearty bread, simple but beautiful presentation. \n\nBeet cured gravlax: smoked salmon on fleek, and then some. Super interesting with the sea buckthorn sorbet mmmm yum. \n\nElk tartar: balanced well with the beets and horseradish, so the raw meat doesn't overwhelm. Honestly you'd hardly know you're eating elk. Not gamy at all. Really liked this!\n\nRaraka & caviar: came with a TON of caviar on these lil crispy potato pancakes. Tasty, pretty, and very filling. \n\nSmoked fish croquettes: in retrospect wish we wouldn't have ordered this, or that the waiter would have steered us away bc they were too much like what we'd just eaten, and they were the most bland and throwaway dish of the night.\n\nOverall glad we came and tried something new.

We call her several times as she was passing by our table bringing food to others. Finally we stopped and asked her that we had indicated from the beginning that we had concert tickets. Her answer was \"so is everybody here\". I did not ask everybody here but we have been waiting about 20 minutes to call your attention. We ordered hearing, duck, mini panqueques with a white cream on top and a little red \"caviar\" that you spread over the panqueques. We ordered Veal chicks and several other dishes. Most dishes came with an excessive amount of salt.  We ordered wine with dinner. We finished the main courses before the wine arrived. The attitude of the waiter continued to be very unfriendly and rude. She neglected our table and do not want to go back unless we make it a condition that she will no longer be our waiter.

Walk all the way in, you will find it.\nSALAD: yes I said SALAD! Sooo refreshing and well put together, very creative as well. I don't like salad in general but I was still thinking of their salad the day after. Our waitress told us that they used locally-grown ingredients and the salad is created based on the season. It was amazing and let's leave it at that.\n\nCame here with my best friend on a Thursday. We made our reservation at 8:30pm but got there 20 mins early. Service was kinda slow but it was okay cuz we needed to catch up.\n\nAmbience: semi-dressy and intimate . But I saw ppl coming in jeans and sneakers. \n\nWe ordered:\nDaily Creation- Kohlrabi & Beet Salad: 5/5 $16 MUST ORDER! This salad consists of Smoked Ricotta, Sausalito watercress, burgundy truffle and caramelized hazelnuts. Oh boy, it was party in my mouth. So refreshing, balanced, and full of flavors. The salad was well-dressed to perfection. What a Creation! My mouth gets watery thinking about it. And and ... it's vegan and  gluten-free. What! I want more!!!\n\nAutumn salad: 4/5 $13- consists of persimmons, pomegranate, almonds with mixed springs salad and vinaigrette dressing. We had this first before the beet salad. It was great as well but the beet salad was another level. I know they constantly rotate/change their menus. So if you don't see the Beets salad on the menus... order this. \n\nSwedish Meatballs: 2/5 $23: this dish was mediocre for the price of it. Yes the meatballs were soft but I wouldn't say it worth $23. The lingonberry sauce was interesting thou-sweet and a bit tangy. I wouldn't order this again since I can get a lower quality of Swedish meatballs at IKEA for a fraction of the price.\n\nPan seared diver Scallops: 3/5 $35 : This dish was good. I like all the veggies it comes with ( sunchoke, fennel, cauliflower), but the seaweed butter has a weird taste to it. Maybe I haven't have seaweed butter before. The Scallops were perfectly cool but it's a tad too salty for my liking. Again, we had our main courses after the UHMAZING salad, My palette were spoiled. \n\nPresentation: well-put! All the dishes were beautifully plated and well-plated. \n\nI would definitely come here again .... for the SALAD.", "author": "Jessica Doan N."}

I have never had Scandanavian food before, so I was looking forward to trying something new. For starters, my friend and I tried the smoked fish croquettes and elk tartare. The croquettes were fried to perfection, and the sauce that the croquettes were made to be dipped in was balanced in the amount of fattiness and savory flavors. The Elk Tartar was wonderful as well. I wish they gave us a few more rye crisps to go with it, but since my friend and I got the bread appetizer, we used that to finish up the elk tartar once we were out of the rye crisp. \n\nNow for the entrees, I ordered the House Made Wild Boar Sausage. My friend ordered the Local Halibut. The presentation for these two dishes were beautiful and I was blown away by the way that the flavors complimented each other. I was able to taste the intricacies of the dishes. Additionally, the service was very attentive and they did not rush us. Our waiter was also very considerate and made sure that me and my friend were not in a rush to go catch a show, so that the food would come out in a timely manner if we were in a time crunch. \n\nI am looking forward to coming here again.

It's hard to imagine that Scandinavian cooking could turn out anything particularly special, but Pl\u00e4j near Hayes Valley has won me over! The restaurant is located in the elegant hotel Inn at the Opera, and the dark setting is matched with absolutely beautiful decor. The service was incredibly friendly, and our server in particular was so helpful in providing recommendations and was obviously excited about the food when she went over the menu for us.\n\nWe started our meal with the homemade sourdough/rye bread, which came with a dish of caramelized butter with sea salt and leek powder. The bread was amazing--warm, soft, and chewy, and the salted butter complemented the earthiness of the dough so well! We continued with three of the small plates, which were definitely the highlights of the meal, and the portions were actually quite generous for \"appetizer\" plates. The trout tartare with shaved onion butter was creamy and delicious with a nice balance of flavors. The gioia burrata had a spicy kick from the peppers and bursted with Mediterranean flavors of olive oil and fresh heirloom tomatoes. And finally, the rolled slices of gravlax were served with a refreshing sorrel sorbet, creme fraiche, and a dusting of rye--the contrasting oily, fresh, and earthy flavors in this dish worked together so well! Wow!\n\nThen came our entrees. In comparison to the small plates, the dinner entrees were far less interesting and didn't come with any flavor surprises. The filled potato dumplings were served with a saute of mushrooms and a side of lingonberry, and the lean Swedish meatballs came with creamy mashed potatoes, lingonberry sauce, and a simple pan gravy. Nothing crazy, but tasty nonetheless.\n\nAnd then we finished with dessert! We shared an ordered of the delicious plum/lemon tart, served with a plum sorbet and an airy meringue. The tart really showcased seasonal flavors, and the refreshing sorbet and the balanced, creamy meringue really rounded the dessert out! With the bill came some delicious chocolate/nut/coconut balls, which were an amazing complementary treat.\n\nOverall, Pl\u00e4j was an absolutely fantastic restaurant that has a few surprises up its sleeve.

Decided then that this is a restaurant that I must try someday. Fast forward just a few days later, I find myself sitting at Plaj, excited for a good meal, and I was not disappointed. Having just dined at the one Michelin started Octavia the night before and having ordered some fairly similar dishes (devil's eggs and flaky white fish), I came away thinking Plaj as more successful in its execution. \n\nYou truly feast with your eyes at Plaj - everything was plated beautifully but the even better thing is that everything also tasted wonderfully rich, complex and sophisticated. Ok, maybe the meatball dish was as expected, which I enjoyed as well. The special amuse bouche of Devil's egg was wonderful. Mushroom soup was full of umami. Favorite dish of the night was definitely the halibut, where every bite was bliss. Meatball was solid and we gobbled that up as well. We were so full that we skipped dessert, but the morsel of chocolate they provided to end our meal was a perfect end to a great meal. The restaurant itself was a little odd being inside a hotel and without windows, but for the food and attentive service, I'd gladly come back again.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Unfortunately, we were seated right by the entrance so wasn't particularly great. \nWe ordered bread (2 slices with butter) - the bread was just ok but the butter was delicious. \nTheir herring plate was excellent, for me it was a real highlight. I love all things herring so it was a winner for me. \nFoie Gras terrine was delicious. \nChargrilled broccolini was very good, loved the flavors.\nFor mains we had elk - (delicious) and duck (pretty chewy so I was disappointed with it). \nNorthern Lights dessert was very tasty, you must try it and it's good to share as it is quite rich. \n\nSo the food was pretty good but what I thought could improve is the service.

Okay, so they had some delicious variants of those dishes, but there were other dishes as well that were superb. The highlight was probably the Taste of Herring, an appetizer of small pieces of herring prepared in different styles. Seemingly simple, and yet, the combination of the flavors were superb. Really loved the housemade rye(?) bread with a seasoned butter that added an interesting herbal element. Raraka, a potato pancake-like appetizer that comes in a cast iron skillet, which strangely, reminded me of a cross between potato latkes and Japanese takoyaki, were delicious. The meatballs were great, but the pork cheek was forgettable.\n\nA bit on the pricey side, but each dish was very well executed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-20", "description": "I have never written a Yelp review before, but I feel compelled to do so after a bizarre experience with the waitstaff at pl\u00e4j that marred an otherwise lovely meal and makes me uninterested in returning to the restaurant. \n\nPl\u00e4j's thing seems to be mixing bold, different flavors in surprisingly successful combinations. We ordered oysters, lobster, elk tartare, pork cheeks, and banana cake. The banana cake was my favorite dish of the night. I felt that the strong flavors accompanying the oysters and tartare made it hard to taste the actual proteins, but the dishes were overall very tasty. We also had two delicious cocktails - Swedish Gold especially had a fascinating twist from a sweet start to savory finish in every sip.\n\nWhen we ordered, I asked if that seemed like a good three courses. Our waitress responded by saying that the kitchen was closing soon, so we should be sure we were ordering everything we wanted now, and she said, \"those two things will make a light meal,\" did we want to order anything else?\n\nWe said that we had ordered what we wanted. I know now that I should have called out the \"two things\" on the spot, but I dunno, she was writing on a pad, and there was no world where we ordered two anything, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed \"things\" meant something like dinner courses in a world where oysters are such a starter they don't count.\n\nThree great dishes later, she brings the dessert menus and walks away. My partner and I are confused about the missing pork cheeks, but we pick a dessert we'd like and prepare for a reality in which pork cheeks are not in the cards.\n\nShe comes back, and I say, \"you know, I was worried when you said 'two things,' we also ordered the pork cheeks.\" She gets flustered, says that she really doesn't think the kitchen will be able to do this, would we like any dessert? I say that we've picked a dessert we'd like but that it would be great if she could check on the pork cheeks. She says, this is why I was so careful to go over everything you ordered, because the kitchen is closing. I say, \"we did order the pork cheeks\" and she walks away.\n\nWhile she's gone, my partner and I discussed that initial interaction about courses, etc. He hadn't heard the \"two things\" thing, but we agree that there was definitely no time she said anything like, \"okay so four oysters, the lobster dish, etc.\" Just didn't happen.\n\nShe returns with great news! They can do the pork cheeks.  We are thrilled! But she repeats that we really should have ordered these to start, that is why she was so careful and made sure to repeat everything that we ordered back to us. Well, that was simply not true, so with a smile on my face, I say, \"I don't think you repeated our order back to us.\" \n\nThis earns a \"I'd punch you if I weren't such a good employee\" smile from her - she rolls her eyes and walks away without a word. She has an agitated exchange with another waitress. That waitress serves us the pork cheeks and clears our plates after, seeming to have taken over our table.\n\nOriginal waitress comes back to wipe food debris from our table. I thank her for making the pork cheeks happen. She replies with a frosty \"sure.\" She makes a move to the dessert menus saying, \"I know you said you didn't want dessert before, but can we interest you in anything else tonight...?\" And before she arrives at the table with the menus, we tell her we want the banana cake because we had picked it out before. I only recount that episode because it was clear that she wasn't really hearing us for some reason - earlier, I had very clearly said that we had picked a dessert we were interested in but that it would be great for her to check on the pork cheeks. So, some kind of crossed communication wire.\n\nAnyway, original waitress finishes out our service. Before we had been smiling and bantering about great flavor combinations, now was icy formality and one word answers from her. She made clear through tone and demeanor that interacting with us now took a lot of effort. \n\nAfter the meal, the waitress starts recounting in a raised voice to other staff how we had been lying, how she had repeated our every dish back to us when we first ordering. Loud enough that I could hear her through the men's room door and my partner could hear her down the hallway in the hotel lobby. \n\nTHAT was the moment that sealed the night. We had been prepared to leave, satisfied eating dessert after elk tartare and getting more food elsewhere. It was she who took us to this strange antagonistic place after \"I don't think you repeated our order back to us,\" which was the plain truth. Like, really? You're going to pass us off as liars instead of owning your honest mistake? With your own weird lie about repeating our order? And you're going to scream about it so loudly that we can hear from the bathroom and the hotel lobby? Days after our meal, I am left dwelling on how unpleasant our waitress became because of her own mistake. Unprofessional.", "author": "Andy B."}

Service was top notch, our waitress checked in with us just enough to enjoy our night but not too much where it was overwhelming. She helped to time each course perfectly so we enjoyed them at the proper serving temperature. \nFood wise, we started with the trout tartare which was my favorite dish of the night. Incredibly light and fresh it had a clean taste and the dressing was refreshing and clean. Perfect way to start the meal. \nNext we had their famous potato dumplings which were stuffed with leeks and onions and beautiful sauce of fresh vegetables. It was not heavy and great intricate flavors abound in the mouth! The onions were the best, sweet and crunchy. \nFinally our two meat courses of boar sausage and Swedish meatballs. The boar sausage had the most selfish grainy mustard which popped with a hint of heat with each bite. The most delicious boar sausage I've had. The Swedish meatballs were incredibly tender and we substituted the mashed potatoes for saut\u00e9ed veggies (one can never have too much veggies). The lingonberry sauce added an element of sweetness to cut through the richness of the meatball. Yummy! The veggies were cooked in butter and so rich. Perfect meal for two that we skipped my favorite princess cake and I had a decaffinated herbal tea, blueberry merlot instead which was the perfect way to end the meal. \nBut wait, after paying, they gave us there delicious chocolate coconut truffle malls which had the most amazing texture and taste.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-15", "description": "At one time I lived in the heart of the largest Scandinavian communities in the U.S.  Often I would eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and go out for drinks at night with friends at any of numerous restaurants. Since then I've sorely missed the food (and sometimes drink) that is unique to their culture, which these days is nearly impossible to find anywhere. Even in San Francisco, one of the food capitols of the world, there is but one restaurant that bills itself as Scandinavian.\n\nPl\u00e4j (pronounced \"play\", as in being in the theater district. Get it?) is located inside The Inn at the Opera, although it is not really merely a hotel dining room. It is small, dark and a nice place to hide away on a cold foggy San Francisco night. It is also a favorite of the theater district, although unlike some restaurants in such districts it bills itself as \"casual\".\n\nWe walked in without reservations, casually dressed, right after an onslaught of well-dressed theater patrons were just leaving. There were several unoccupied tables but the person who greeted us made a value judgement based on our casual attire and insisted that we eat at the bar.  I'm not a bar person and I don't find eating anything but a hamburger at a bar to be conducive to fine dining. I wasn't very pleased at the rude greeting but with a strong desire to quench my appetite for Scandinavian food I relented.  Fortunately the bartender, Simon, had none of the attitude of the other employee (owner?) and helped make eating at the bar tolerable and even enjoyable.\n\nThe menu at Pl\u00e4j is quite short and there was so much I expected that simply wasn't there. It seems they have their own take on what Scandinavian cooking is all about.  I wrinkled my nose at something like Swedish meatballs being featured as an example of fine dining. There was hardly a hint of the variety of Northern European ethnic foods I knew and loved ... I guess they believe that their clients aren't sophisticated enough to understand and appreciate?\n\nSo, since they were out of what I intended to order, I actually did end up ordering Swedish meatballs, thinking that when I got home I would be reading some sappy Yelp review from someone complaining that they could get meatballs \"just as good\" at IKEA for $1.99 (you know, that same person who complains that Wagyu beef is overpriced and no better than what they use at McDonalds).\n\nWe started with the Taste of Herring as an appetizer at $19. True, most people have never tasted herring and if they have it's that putrid stuff in a glass bottle you can buy at the supermarket. This selection was good but I would have gladly paid a few dollars more for just a little bit more. It's one of those things that you just start getting the flavor rolling around in your mouth and are left yearning for more.  Just one more piece of each next time, okay guys?\nAs I say, my entre was Swedish meatballs and I could describe them but my picture probably says it better.  No, my friend, they are NOT the same as what you can get at IKEA for $1.99!\n\nA couple of final observations: their Facebook page shows hundreds of amazing food photos, none of which I recognize from the very short menu I saw. What's up with that? Did Pl\u00e4j used to be owned by someone else who was more into food than the current owners?  Are they going out of business?  Are they just getting bored lately?  Were we given \"special\" menus because the owner didn't like the way we looked?\n\nAlso, I've used the term \"Scandinavian\" here because that's what the restaurant owners' use. Many people lump people from that geographic region (Norwegians, Swedes, Danes and Icelanders) together as all being the same. No, there is a lot of cultural difference in them, including their food and also their personalities.  My experience has usually been friendlier than what I experienced here (exception being the bartender, Simon). Especially as we were leaving, not even a \"thank you\" from whoever was supposed to be in charge.  That entire lack of making me feel welcome at their establishment keeps me from rating them any higher than I did.", "author": "Todd H."}

This iteration is a *win*. Creative, interesting, elevated Scandinavian food in an upscale, but not stuffy, environment. Cutting edge decor, a mishmash of modern Scandinavian with quirky accents keeps the atmosphere from feeling overly formal. The wait staff aims to please...even on a busy Friday evening. \nWe started our meal with fresh baked bread (served sliced in a paper sleeve) and caramelized leek butter...and fully understand why this is a house staple.\nBeing a group, we not only wanted to share, but there were some dietary restrictions among us. Plaj aims to please with several gluten-free and vegan options, all every bit as delicious as the \"regular\" options.\nBeet Cured Gravlax with passion-fruit sorbet, rye crumbles and lemon crepe fraiche is not only delicious, but beautiful to behold.\nDefinitely order and share the Taste of Herring...even if pickled herring isn't your thing. Another bright spot: Raraka & Caviar - a potato rosti with a choice of whitefish caviar, or a more upscale sturgeon-y variety, served on a steaming cast iron skillet with a pile of crunchy sea salt to hand sprinkle. The yummy cauliflower soup was the perfect option for our gf diner who had to forego the warm bread appetizer - rich, piquant and warm on a cold foggy SF night!\nThe best of the meal (for me) was the Arctic Cod \"daily creation.\" I'm so grateful to our server for recommending this seasonal dish - cooked to perfection - which will be off the menu in just one month. One of our party ordered the Swedish meatballs, reporting them to be the perfect comfort food, an elevated (highly) version of what many of us have come to associate more with an Ikea run.\nFor dessert the birthday boy ordered Princess cake - reimagined and deconstructed...served in a Mason jar (cute touch!) The rest of us finished off the meal sharing Northern Lights (highly recommended): chocolate terrine, passion fruit sorbet, soft meringue -- also gluten-free, so nobody was deprived of a sweet ending to a delicious meal.

I personally love the decor, particularly the back room with its Swedish floral wallpaper and large wood table with fur-covered chairs.\n\nThe cocktails are outstanding. I hate when cocktails feature obscure liqueurs and unconventional ingredients designed to impress, but actually suck. Pl\u00e4j's crazy concoctions taste amazing. My favorite, Swedish Gold, manages to successfully combine gin, mustard, dill, honey, and black pepper.\n\nI appreciate how the menu evolves, although it's bittersweet when a beloved dish is replaced by a new variation. They had a sublime appetizer of dungenesse crab, leeks, shiso, and gr\u00e4ddfil (a Swedish sour cream) that I only got to have twice before it shapeshifted. Even when nothing on the menu looks fabulous at first glance, as on my last visit, I still end up being delighted.\n\nI can always count on their fish dishes to be fantastic. I've had an incredible duck breast. Their elk carpaccio will thrill anyone accustomed to traditional tartare. The only dish that didn't wow me was the Swedish meatballs. The meatballs were dry and the mashed potatoes needed more fat.\n\nPl\u00e4j can be polarizing. It's not entry-level food, and it's easy to dismiss their flower-strewn, ash-dusted dishes as frivolous. But they haven't let me down yet.

As appetizers we had ordered the baked bread and artisan cheese plate. The cheese plate featured cheeses from all of the countries.

Saw this place on Yelp and it said it was close to Davies so we checked it out. \nI ordered:\n- Smoked Fish Croquettes ($12): Good, but only comes with 3 pieces which is quite expensive.\n- Arctic Cod ($29): Was alright, nothing super special.\n- Kladkakka ($9): This is the chocolate cake with blueberry sorbet. Cake itself was not bad but pairing it with blueberry sorbet was not as good as the normal vanilla ice cream.\nHonestly the food was not bad but what makes this a 3-star review are the prices and the service being off. The service was not up to par of a fine dining restaurant. Our waitress wasn't rude but she wasn't very friendly either. Also, on the bill we noticed that we got charged for two cokes...when we asked her about it she was just like \"He drank 2 cokes, so I charged for 2 cokes.\" When she asked him if he wanted a refill, she didn't warn him that it would be $3.50 extra, so naturally he said yes.

There's a back area that can accommodate groups.\n\nFor cocktails, the Copenhagen is pretty liquor forward, while the rye blossom is on the lighter side and refreshingly citrusy. We started off with the fresh baked bread. It came out mildly warm - it was aiite, but we only got 2 pieces. The smoked fish croquettes were okay. The tartare of elk was interesting, though I personally thought the orange was a bit out of place.\n\nFor mains, the braised ox cheek was tender, and the homemade gnocchi was done well. I tried a bit of my friend's meatballs, which were good in terms of texture, but a bit light in terms of taste. The kladdkaka chocolate cake was moist and dense and paired well with the blueberry.\n\nOverall, the flavors were decent.

Overall experience 1 star. \nI was there for the first time with my girlfriend. It all started out very romantic and chill. The decor is on point and it was very dark and intimate. Half way through our meal, I noticed a grain of sand in my salad. It was quite a big piece of rock and my teeth felt the pain. After spitting it out in the plate, I tried to press on it to see if it's just a piece of hard shell. It made a mark on the plate and a scratchy noise. Uhh,  then we notified a person who looked like a manager of the place. With no smile or apology, he immediately took it away and came back with that was mustard seed. MUSTARD SEED? really?

The restaurant accommodated our request to finish before the show began, and we were treated to a very classy and comfortable dining experience for four. \n\nFood: our dinner was delicious, and there were a lot of sweet notes throughout the meal that, coming from a Chinese background, were unexpected and exciting. \n\nFor starters, we had the Gravlax, the Croquettes, and the Bread. The Gravlax was a suggestion from the waitstaff, and what a great suggestion it was! The fish was sweet and delicate, and was paired with light sorbet, lemon creme fraiche, and rye crumbs that gave it good texture and flavor. \n\nFor entrees, we had the sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d, Maine scallops, and the classic Swedish meatballs. The sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d was a delightful platter of three open-faced sandwiches with different toppings. The one with game terrine had a healthy heap of horseradish that was pretty overpowering and had to be set aside, but apart from that, the potato-anchovy salad sandwich and the thinly sliced rullep\u00f8lse were delicious. \n\nService was very attentive and knowledgeable, and always open to explain the menu which can be daunting to someone who might not read Swedish. \n\nAs a family that usually shares plates, the presentation made sharing amongst four a little more difficult, as it seemed every dish was served in sets of prime numbers.

We definitely had a positive experience at Plaj, although it was a bit strange in the beginning. When we pulled up to the restaurant, we found that it was located inside an inn (totally fine, and I had read that advance on Yelp). However, there was a large party of people gathered just inside the door, and it looked like some sort of Scandinavian class reunion was going on, so it seemed like we were in the wrong place. We walked in, received a few odd stares, and caught the eye of an attendant who pointed us down toward the restaurant. \n\nOnce inside the restaurant proper, the mood totally changed. We were seated at a delightful table next to a crackling fireplace, which was just perfect. After 15-20 minutes, our waiter finally appeared and brought water. One thing we noticed during the entire experience was that the meal was quite drawn out, although we suspect this may be a cultural difference where the staff purposely give LOTS of time between courses. That said, if you are in a rush, don't come to Plaj as it was an hour before we received our appetizers. \n\nThe bread with butter and leeks was quite good. Nothing mind-blowing, but the addition of slightly shredded, almost powdered, leek was interesting. And the whipped butter was a nice touch. \n\nWe also shared the Autumn Salad appetizer, which was delicious. I have a special admiration for restaurants that prepare unusual, seasonal, and tasty salads, and a special loathing for ones whose salads are janky. Fortunately, Plaj falls into the former category. I'm not a fennel fan, so I was happy to see that fennel did not overpower the dish. It had a nice mix of hazelnuts and pears, a Scandinavian cheese, and a little drizzle of aquavit vinaigrette.  \n\nFor entrees, two of us ordered the Swedish meatballs, which come with pureed potatoes and a nice and soppable gravy. The dish also came with lingonberries, which are basically the most Scandinavian thing ever. The meatballs were well-prepared and properly seasoned without going overboard. One colleague ordered the wild salmon, which she thoroughly enjoyed. We were also going to sample the Flying Jacob Chicken, which apparently is a Swedish casserole, but they had run out of the dish earlier in the evening. Sad story.\n\nPlaj's wine and cocktail menu is quite affordable and covers different regions of the world. I had a spicy gimlet (not normally my first choice, but I enjoyed it) and a Spanish red to pair with the meatballs. All good.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and helpful, although again, don't expect anything to come quickly. This is a great place to come for a leisurely evening.", "author": "Willie R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-13", "description": "I came here for a celebratory dinner a few months ago and have been meaning to come back ever since.  The overall experience here is quiet, romantically dim, and spacious.  We made a weekday reservation to ensure that we got seated right away, and it was good that we did because with such limited seating, it was necessary to book ahead.  The restaurant is also located at the back of the hotel lobby of the Opera Inn which is unexpectedly fancy (their patrons are usually opera goers).  That said, it is not necessary to dress fancily for dinner, but a business casual or more reserved attire would go nicely with the ambiance.\n\nLike a lot of the other Yelpers have mentioned, Scandinavian food is hard to come by in San Francisco, so it was great that the waiter was more than willing to describe the menu items in detail. Every heading on the menu sounded like it was an object out of an Ikea furniture instruction manual.  I'm not sure if that aspect supports the authenticity of the Scandinavian influence, but it convinced me.\n\nOf course, I had to try the Swedish meatballs with lingonberry jam sauce and potato puree was the most upscale alternative to frozen meatballs with canned cranberries and powdered boxed mashed potatoes ever. I absolutely loved every bite, and I chose the full order for $3 more than the half order which was well worth it.  The potatoes were so buttery and beaten into almost more of a cream which made it light and airy, and with a dribble of the lingonberry, the meat/carb/fruit combo was perfection. The in-house bread (reminded me of Boudin at the Embarcadero Center) was so good with the salted butter with fennel; this combination with my entree really made the perfect meal.\n\nWould I come back? If I'm in the mood for something fancy and on the pricier end, yes! Great as a celebratory dinner spot for memorable occasions.", "author": "Kathy T."}

No valet which makes parking a bit of a challenge here. Their house aquavit tastes oddly of cumin, but I love that they made me a diluted version of one of their cocktails, since I don't love the taste of alcohol. The bread is a bit dense but served warm. The salmon, meatballs, and fish (in an incredible mushroom sauce) were amazing. The shrimp skagen was forgettable and not what we expected, all four of us having visited Scandinavia. We were hoping for a larger pile of shrimp. The elk carpaccio was tasty but not very exciting. The pie was not really a pie so much as a crumble, and the princess cake was not really cake so much as a deconstructed princess cake in a jar. However, the good news is the cake tasted really good - so moist and flavorful but weird to have the marzipan stretched over the jar containing the cake and custard and jam layers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-02", "description": "I love Scandinavian food, so I really want to like this place. Unfortunately the quality really does not justify the high prices.\n\nA lot of the menu is not particularly Scandinavian, and seems to rotate frequently-- I've gone about twice a year for the past two years, and it has been different ever time. It's all pretty good, but nothing remarkable for the price. I'll focus on the more traditional Scandinavian items, which seem to stay on the menu.\n\nHouse Aquavits:\nYum! Aquavits are a Scandinavian spirit, most notable for their strong dill/caraway taste. Pl\u00e4j serves both a \"traditional\" house aquavit and several infused versions. My favorite is the traditional, which has a delightfully strong caraway flavor.\n\nTaste of Herring:\nThis herring is about as good as it gets. Definitely on par with the best herring I've had, and that includes several trips to Scandinavia. The cheese and crackers go nicely with the herring, but the amount of potatoes is excessive and is clearly just trying to compensate for the fact that there is not nearly enough actual herring on the plate. The staff seems to recommend sharing this dish between two people, which gives each person just one or two bites of each type of herring. I recommend the opposite-- get two orders per person. It's expensive, but this is really the only food item on the menu which is worthwhile.\n\nSwedish Meatballs:\nThis is a very traditional Swedish dish, but generally not a particularly remarkable one. The Pl\u00e4j version is no exception. It's good, but not much better than what you could get at Ikea. I recommend passing on this in favor of an extra order of herring.\n\nPrincess Cake:\nA traditional Swedish cake consisting of layers of marzipan, sponge cake, and cream. The Pl\u00e4j version is served in a jar and is quite tasty, but nothing super remarkable.\n\n\nI'll keep coming back every now and then when I want some decent quality Scandinavian food, but in general this place just reminds me that I need to make more frequent trips to the grocery section at Ikea.", "author": "Christian P."}

Not only were sauces lathered all over everything but so were a lot of onions, chives, pickled vegetables. Why not leave this on the side? I was really looking forward to the salmon and it was barely edible. I began to get queasy. The wait staff was nice but way UNDER trained and focused on selling cocktails.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "I've never had Scandinavian food before (unless IKEA meatballs count..) and I don't commonly see things like elk and wild boar at restaurants, so I was really intrigued by Plaj. My friend and I ended up picking it for a nice, celebratory dinner based on the menu and pictures of the food, but didn't really think about the restaurant itself. Turns out the place is located inside the Inn at the Opera and it's pretty classy. Like classy in a more elegant, old-fashioned way rather than a trendy way. Imagine a pre-opera dinner. We made a reservation, but it wasn't necessary for a weeknight.\n\nService here definitely matches up to the classy ambiance. Friendly, welcoming and just attentive enough. Our server explained the menu to us, which was divided into 4 sections: Dagen (specials), Hagen (from the garden, aka veggies), Fjord (from the sea, aka seafood) and Beta (to graze, aka meat). Apparently these words aren't actually Swedish/Scandinavian words; they're just made-up words that sound like they could be.\n\nPretty much everything on the menu sounded good to me, but since I love trying things I can't normally get elsewhere, I ended up ordering the WILD BOAR CHOP. My friend got the SWEDISH MEATBALLS, and our server brought us some complimentary bread to start.\n\n* IN-HOUSE BREAD (complimentary, additional bag $3) - 4/5\nIncredibly soft!! I'm not sure if the bread tasted good on its own, but it came with this butter that was sprinkled with ground fennel and sea salt, which was absolutely delicious. And incredibly dangerous.. I'm not really a carb person or a butter person, but I couldn't stop eating this pillowy soft bread + butter combo.\n\n* WILD BOAR CHOP ($25) - 4/5\n[swedish mash, figs, wild broccoli, pickled mustard seeds]\nI've never had boar before so I don't have anything to compare to, but I enjoyed the dish. The meat reminded me of a pork chop, so it was a little on tough side but by no means too tough or overcooked. Whatever the orange mash that it came with (I want to say some sort of carrot puree) was more of a highlight to me though. Very lightly sweet and soo silky smooth. That along with the figs and mustard seeds paired really well with the boar. The broccoli (I think it was Chinese broccoli) was a little too buttery though and the yellowing leaves didn't make it look the freshest.\n\n* SWEDISH MEATBALLS (half order $15; full order $18) - 5/5\n[potato puree, pan gravy, lingonberry, pickled cucumber]\nThe full order comes with 5 meatballs while the half order comes with 3, so I'd definitely recommend getting the full order for the $3 difference. The dish doesn't sound as fancy as most of the other dishes, but it's absolutely delicious! The meatballs are super tender and everything else in the dish complemented them pretty well. The potato puree was incredibly smooth and light, the gravy was very flavorful and the sweet lingonberry sauce was a nice contrast in flavor.\n\nPrices aren't so bad in my opinion, and the food is definitely worth it. From other reviews and photos, I was expecting tiny portions of expensive (but good) food that would leave me still hungry afterwards, but I actually felt like the portion sizes were very reasonable. 5 meatballs doesn't seem like a lot, but with the potato puree (and the complimentary bread at the beginning), it's very filling. The boar chop is pretty sizable as well. \n\nIf you're looking for a nice, elegant dinner (or for some unique dishes), I'd definitely recommend Plaj! Food is amazing and it won't break your bank :) I'm still not entirely sure what Scandinavian food means (aside from Swedish meatballs), but I definitely want to come back and try some of the other things on the menu.", "author": "Jessie L."}

After making a few trips to Scandinavia over the past few years, i wanted a little taste of Scandinavia in SF.  My friend recommended this place to me and i was excited to come try.\n\nThe food is good, my only problem is that the service was terribly slow and the food did not come out in an orderly manner.  We ordered appetizers that came out in about 5minutes all at once, then it took a long time to get entrees, and even longer for dessert.\n\nWe started out with the bread, oysters, elk carpaccio, and pickled herring.  They should just give complimentary bread, why even charge $3?  The bread is really strong on anise, and the leek butter was not special.  I would probably skip ordering bread.  The oysters are good, nice balance of sweet and salty.  Elk carpaccio was probably the highlight, very tasty and surprisingly beefy.   I liked the mix of veggies and garnishes on the carpaccio.  The pickled herring was good, i liked the orginal flavor but not the curry flavored.  It was definitely unique and not something you get everywhere, a must try dish!\n\nMoving on to entrees, we tried both the meatballs and braised ox cheek.  The braised ox cheek was just devine.  Rich, meaty, tender, and packed with flavor.  I only wish it was a larger portion of cheek.  The celeric whip and beef jus was also a nice compliment to the ox cheeks.  You must try this dish if you are a meat eater!  The swedish meatballs are disappointing...while it was very flavorful and tasty, the meatball texture was mushy.  It just didnt sit right with me.  But other than that, the gravy, pickled cucumbers, and ligonberry sauce was delicious.\n\nSo we decided to share a princess cake, it took a good 30min to come out, we just kept waiting and waiting.  The princess cake was very disappointing, deconstructed in a glass jar, the flavor was just off to me.  It was way too sweet (even by swedish cake standard), the custard had too much brandy and sugar, the cake was not soft, the jam was also very sweet and didn't taste homemade.  The whole thing was just not tasty to me.  I would have been more satisfied buying a slice of cake at Schuberts.\n\nOverall, food is good, but the service is very slow and a little frustrating at times.

One would think Scandinavian design where form over function is emphasized and symmetry takes over all other aspects of a place. Nope Plaj is located inside a hotel and the interior is what one would expect and old style hotel lobby. We had reservations though did walk in early. We were offered early seating but that particular table is suited for people who can fit in tight corners. Decided to wait at the bar and had a nice detailed conversation with the bar tender about the offerings there. \nNow for the main attraction we ordered quite a bit so here goes \nBread with Caramelized butter: Bread was wonderful as it should be due to the fact that most dishes utilize and hence its their bread and butter (look how that worked out!) Butter was seasoned well too.\nFresh Ricotta: Very good IMO. If you like fresh cheese this dish is for you\nGreen Salad: I hadn't read the full description of this dish so was at a loss on what the grated cheese was. Lo and behold it was blue cheese. Clever. \nSmorrebrod: Next were the sandwiches: House smoked salmon. Hit it out of the park. Just gorgeous full of flavor yet delicate. Herring was decent but we should have skipped it here as had an entire herring course. Lamb with liver. Didn't do it for and tasted like airline food to moi. My DC liked it a lot. \nHerring: we had three types here . All were decent I liked the Kaviar one particular accoutrements were good as well and usually what accompanies a Caviar course \nFritters: Meh nothing special here just regular stuff.\nFarm Vegetables: Decent and hearty and would please a vegetarian. \nNorthern Lights: Hit it out of the park. Chocolate ganache topped with passion fruit sorbet and meringue on top. A brilliant take on baked Alaska. I would come back just for desserts it was so good.\nThe wine list is decent and good place to familiarize oneself with aquavit if you are into distilled items. \n4 Stars solid.", "author": "Elvis A."}

How ignorant was I to expect Scandinavian Designs decor and horse meatballs on the menu! The dining room actually looked upscale and the food was a far cry from those sketchy IKEA lunches I've consumed over the years.\n\nThe beet salad was outstanding! It was served warm and accented with a hint of truffle. The slices of v\u00e4sterbotten cheese on the plate were scrumptious! I have been dreaming of it since.\n\nAlthough we were initially scared to try the herring, it actually turned out to be very tasty. The fish was slightly sweet and accompanied by a variety of veggies and ugly brown crackers. \n\nFor entrees, I recommend the lobster and ox cheek, both of which were delectable. Be sure to save some extra bread to sop up the lobster sauce with, or drop an outrageous $3 for another order.\n\nI would probably skip dessert next time. I tried the Princess Cake, which is normally my favorite (duh!), but this was served trifle-style in a cup.

To be honest, my experience with Scandinavian food is either hoity toity restaurants like this or Ikea. Plaj is like an epic Ikea. There's even a dish called Swedish meatballs. Order it, and smother the meatballs in lingonberry, then gravy, then both. Half order of meatballs comes with 3 meatballs, while the full order comes with 5. The smoked herring is phenomenal. And totally Scandinavian, right??? Being a seafood lover, I also went for the black cod, which came with Dungeness crab and vegetables, in a pool of butternut squash sauce. The cod was flakey excellence.\n\nGorge yourself on their delicious complimentary bread. Wash down those pickled proteins and veggies with a drink from their carefully curated selection.

So when it came, I was a little bit surprised at the substitution - instead of the grain mustard they had hollandaise sauce.  Look, I am not going to lie, I am really picky.  I don't like hollandaise, and moreover, I don't like things that touch hollandaise.  This isn't anyone's problem but my own, and I just make sure to ask for no hollandaise or mayo or aioli on things that I suspect are going to have it.  This dish didn't seem like it was the type to have it, nor did I see it anywhere else on the menu, so I let my guard down.  \n\nSo my partner, who no one has EVER described as anything less than pleasant tried to kindly ask the waitress if she would be able to bring us the Elk Tartare without the hollandaise.  This. Did. Not. Go. Well.  What we got instead was a patronizing lecture on what hollandaise was, and how she could not understand why I was okay with the egg yolk on top, but not with the hollandaise sauce on the bottom, and how they're not responsible for listing everything on the menu description.  \n\nFair enough, it's me who is picky, so I just decided to drop it after two or so minutes of her lecture on our ungraciousness and just remember it for next time.  And all was fine for another 15 minute or so until she brought out our main, which our waitress described as \"trout with potatoes and other ingredients we do not bother to list on the menu.\"\n\nOk.  \n\nFortunately for anyone reading this review, I don't mind being explicit in my detailed description of the experience and listing all the necessary ingredients that combine for a perfect 1 star review.

Even so, if San Francisco were an epicenter of Scandinavian culture, like St. Paul or Minneapolis, Pl\u00e4j would still rank among the top restaurants featuring innovative cuisine in a beautiful convivial setting.  \n\nAt Pl\u00e4j, one finds the best results of \"California Cuisine\" from a predominantly Swedish perspective.  The exceptionally well cured and seasoned gravlax resemble the most beautifully presented sushi at a minimalist contemporary Japanese restaurant.  The Deviled eggs with caviar are sublime.

I liked the layout of the restaurant, each table had a lot of space which I like.  They did a good job of accommodating us so we could make it to the show we were going to see.\n\nI was underwhelmed by the food, which I had high hopes for.  I had the halibut starter and cod main course and felt like there was too much creamy sauce.  My wife had the lingonberry brussels sprouts and the potato dumplings (large gnocchi).  We both had queasy stomachs for the next day.  We left still hungry after spending $140 including tip.  I can't say that I felt good paying $1.50 per slice of buttered bread or $10 for a draft beer.\n\nIt was an ok restaurant, just not worth the cost.

If you're vegetarian, make sure to ask for it without bacon.\n\nEcopia Greens:\nA great mix of tasty things, with a great dill vinaigrette.\n\nSummer Mushrooms: \nThis was the closest thing to a vegetarian entree they had. It's smaller than a regular entree, but still a good amount of food if you have a starter or two. I think after so many delicious starters, I was a bit worn out and this wasn't my favorite dish.\n\nDessert:\nThe desserts were especially cute.

It's in the most unassuming location, too inside what looks like a Holiday Inn but is a boutique hotel in Hayes Valley (my favorite neighborhood to dine in).\n\nWe went on a  Tuesday later and it was quite empty but I'm sure the wkd it gets busy and may require calling or a reservation. It's got a full bar and speciality cocktails. It's all small plates so you are basically doing tapas and I recommend it because you get to try many things!\n\nThe menu is pretty detailed and authentic so we found it helpful to ask our server who was pretty well informed. The menu is divided into sections breaking it down by meat, poultry, cheese etc. I definitely yelped to see what ppl were into and made some decisions based on that ;-)\n\nThe buratta was divine. It came with some sort of crunchy breadcrumbs that were absolutely fantastic. Could not get enough. The salmon sashimi was great too - just a very small portion but the sauces were incredible. My favorite was the swedish meatballs. Extremely flavorful and delicious. It came with a mashed potato dish and cucumber salad, all extremely complimentary and delicious. We did the half order which came with 3 meatballs. Absolutely divine! We also had the pork belly which was seasoned and flavored extremely well just a bit fatty! Luckily we shared so it really wasn't a lot of food or made us feel extremely full. It was just right!\n\nFantastic place would be fun to try other dishes!", "author": "Priya S."}

You in?\" Yeah, I thought so. Unless your buddies have names like Lars and Bj\u00f6rn, you probably never uttered those words, did you? Hey, the closest I've come to Scandinavian food was getting a sandwich at Anderson Bakery. Well, that's not quite true. I was in Copenhagen a couple of years ago, and except for the sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d I had at Aamanns Etablissement (review: http://bit.ly/19xGtMe), I really couldn't tell you what Scandinavian cuisine is. Now that I've come to Pl\u00e4j, I'm still not quite sure I've had it because the menu feels more Continental than Nordic to me, but what do I know? My name ain't Sven.\n\nThe rather elegant restaurant is located inside the understated Inn at the Opera on the quiet block of Fulton behind the War Memorial (photo: http://bit.ly/10HYR1F). There is something undeniably operatic about the ambiance even if you are looking for a small-scale dinner like I was. The menu is subdivided into four sections - dagen, hagen, fjord, and beta - which weren't understood well in Google Translate (photo: http://bit.ly/147vFBT). Judging from the selections underneath, I'm guessing the sections break down into starters, vegetarian bites, seafood specialties and entrees. I began my meal with a $15 small plate that sounded more Iberian than Nordic, the Charred Spanish Octopus with Crispy Garlic, Whole Grain Mustard, Pink Apple and Arugula (photo: http://bit.ly/13uMvIQ).\n\nIt was quite an artful presentation with slivers of apple decorating the small bites of tender octopus swimming in a pool of grainy mustard. It worked although there was barely enough to satisfy as a starter. My chosen entree was another relatively small plate, the $22 Berkshire Pork Belly with Swedish Mash and Brussels Sprouts (photo: http://bit.ly/10Qq8f0). It represented a succulent few bites of pork resting on a creamy mash made of shredded carrots providing a slightly sweetened counterpoint to the meat. The freshly blanched sprouts were peeled and piled gently on top. The contrast in textures and flavors made this one a winner. I certainly had enough room for dessert, but instead of going for Scandinavian cheeses and pumpernickel, I went for something a bit more decadent.\n\nThe $8 Rhubarb Strawberry Pie came in a Lavender Granola Crust and was topped with a scoop of Housemade Vanilla Ice Cream (photo: http://bit.ly/119Wb8D). It looked more like a hefty wedge of a cobbler, but I wasn't complaining and neither were Sven and Olaf at the next table who had the same ending to their meals. The waiter was certainly attentive if a tad unctuous. He made sure to let me know I was dining at one of Michael Bauer's newly anointed Top 100 restaurants, an opinion that chef Roberth Sundell should take pride. Funny thing is that I didn't make it to Noma when I was in Copenhagen, the elite dining destination that was only recently taken off its perch as the world's best restaurant. I'm not sure Pl\u00e4j is in the same ballpark culinarily speaking, but it'll do if you want a touch of the fjords.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...elegant presentations, subtle but pronounced flavors, portions a bit paltry for the price\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...classy ambiance but not overly ostentatious\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive if a tad strenuous\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I'm up for some Scandinavian tonight...you in?", "author": "Ed U."}

Simple (especially at such a restaurant). \nSecondly, the foie gras was more of a p\u00e2t\u00e9 than what most of us would consider foie gras. As for the food in general, the portions were small, and many of them were served warm-ish: we ordered the elk carpaccio, the foie gras, and the ox cheek.\nAs for the quality, the cheek was very soft, but lacked flavor with the sauce being too much (in volume) for the quite small portion of cheek. The sauce was also a good bit cooler than the meat. The cheek was also served with onions, but these onions were not cooked (although they looked carmelized) and had an eye-water effecting that didn't at all complement the bland meat. The carpaccio was very fatty, and bland as well. The foie gras was more of a super-fatty p\u00e2t\u00e9, and it tasted like a mix gruyere and butter, and was served with very-tasty brioche and jam.\nAnother thing that irked me--as I consider it improper--was that after finishing our first serving of bread (super small servings--two or three pieces), we were asked by the waitress if we would like some more. In no way did we go out of our way to ask for more bread, therefore meaning to that it would be covered by the house (it's bread, c'mon).\nI ended up paying $105 for two--three light dishes, two servings of bread, and one $13 glass of wine. No dessert. For the portions and quality I would only pay $70-$90 with tip for an equivalent meal. I cannot say that I hated the experience, but going to Pl\u00e4j looks to be a risk depending on service and meal plan. Wouldn't return.", "author": "Julian P."}

Up drinks nice and clean, rocks drinks sports a lone 2 inch cube.  Nice selection of aquavits, which in my opinion is a must when noshing on Scandinavian flavors.  Dill, caraway, coriander and anise will resonate through out the meal, both in drink and eats.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=XFV_U5YlYs47l0i4NQ2IeQ#XFV_U5YlYs47l0i4NQ2IeQ\n\nTaste of Herring ($14) On our visit were 3 cold cured/pickled preps.  2 were real similar with a creamy mustard thing going on.  The other had more of mild, ginger sweetness.  All spectacular in texture and flavor.  Perfect pairings with chopped chives, tiny boiled gem potatoes and rye crackers.  But don't neglect their house bread, very meaty and slightly brown with an excellent crust.  The first is complimentary and a charge may appear for additional request.

The smoked lardons were good but strong.  Poached apples and lingonberry sauce were the contrasting factors.  Pudding had a strong lard note that may be off putting to some.

Perfectly roasted hearty root vegetables served with a slice of Anno 1225 cheese (dryish cheese), sorrel and finely grated truffle.

Fish was perfectly crisped on the skin side, perfectly seasoned, perfectly moist on the meat side.  Textbook!  Sabayon more like a foam but still tasty.  Chanterelles never fail in my book, in any dish.  An overall memory burning dish.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=FhIv8HGJeRp8m0sTiy5nWQ#FhIv8HGJeRp8m0sTiy5nWQ\n\nAebleskiver ($14) is a homey Scandinavian dessert.  A thick pancake-like batter is griddled/fried in molds, so it resembles donut holes.  The result is crisp exterior and a very fluffy interior.  It is not airy like a donut, but more cake-y.  It is served with soft salted butter which instantly melts upon spreading.  And a cloudberry preserve that is so uniquely arctic that it is hard to compare it to anything.

Plaj is located inside a hotel, and is very old-school (kind of reminds me of Nectar Wine Bar?). Clientele was older, and many seemed like business people or families getting dinner before seeing an opera or concert.\n\nThe food was delicious, but on the small and expensive side - so 4 stars (otherwise would have been 5). You can't go wrong with anything, but the standouts were the crab special, and pork belly. The drinks were also delicious, and I found that the wine was amazing even though the list was limited!\n\nFOOD------------------------------------------\n\n* Rye Bread: Complimentary rye bread was so delicious, I think it's the first time I've ever liked rye bread in my life. It is wrapped up in brown paper and served with slightly softened butter. So dangerous.\n\n* Gioia burrata, organic frilly red mustard greens, organic toy box tomato,aquavit vinaigrette ($12): This is a really light and refreshing salad served with some bitter greens and burrata. I was hoping for more tomatoes. And more cheese. Good, but would have rather spent money on something more substantial.\n\n* Crab Starter ($14?): I don't like crab. This dish changed my life. I'm not sure what I was eating, but it was a creamy crab starter that tasted like pure heaven. \n\n* Krondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili ($21): This was good, not quite as good as the crab, but very delicious. The flavors were amazing, the lobster was fresh, and the horseradish flavor was very mild. So. Tiny.\n\n* Sashimi of white fish with pickled onion & ginger, crispy shallots & garlic, hot dill oil ($14): I was hoping this dish would be more raw, it came out semi-cooked probably because of the sauce it was sitting in. The fish and the sauce were delicious, but I was hoping for a silkier textured sashimi.\n\n* Berkshire pork belly, Swedish mash, brussel sprouts, mustard greens ($22): The pork belly was fork tender, and the flavors were amazing. I would order this again, if not for the pork belly, for the intensely buttery brussels sprouts. \n\n* Saddle of venison, chipollini onions, chantarelle, rainbow chard, Scandinavian gratin, Juniper berry jus ($26): We ordered this because the Ox was no longer on the menu. Good, tender, but nothing amazing.\n\n* Swedish spiced apple pie, house made vanilla Ice cream ($8): A great way to end a meal. I wish there were a little more apples though.\n\nDRINKS------------------------------------------\n\n* Michael David Freakshow Lodi 2008 ($12): I REALLY loved this cabernet sauvignon. I'm not sure why.\n\n* Stockholm: Kanon Organic Vodka, Lillet, bitters ($11): I'm impressed by the balance they were able to strike in such a high-alcohol, pure vodka drink. This was tasty if you like martinis, but it was way too strong for me and I prefer something fruitier.\n\n* Pl\u00e4j Thyme: Four Roses Bourbon, fresh thyme, lemon, ginger beer ($11): This was probably my favorite cocktail of the night. Very flavorful and refreshing, served in a tall glass with a sprig of rosemary.\n\n* The Pl\u00e4jer: Buffalo Trace Bourbon, dried apricot cinnamon gastrique, blood orange ($11): This was my 2nd favorite drink of the night. Strong, flavorful, and a tiny bit more on the sweet side. Served in a short glass with one large ice cube.", "author": "Jess C."}

I have not had Scandinavian/Swedish cuisine before so I was very interested in trying it out. I first heard about Plaj when Kron4 first featured it in the dining segment with Vicki Liviakis. It's located in the quaint Inn at the Opera. You enter through the lobby and it's just straight ahead inside. You cannot miss it. There is an eclectic crowd...some tourists staying at the Inn and SF Opera/Symphony goers mixed with regular folks from the area. \n\nBf made a reservation and our table was ready right when we walked in. Plaj itself is romantic and dimly lit. The decor is classic and welcoming. There is a bar that seemed quite lively with patrons sitting there and a bartender mixing up a lot of fancy cocktails. \n\nOur waitress, Heather, was very friendly and efficient. The waiter who brought out our dishes described every dish, so that was helpful and informative. \n\nI'm a sucker for any hot/warm bread, so I enjoyed the rye bread and butter very much. I liked how they served it in a little paper bag to keep it warm. Also, seemed much cleaner than a bread basket. Of course, we had to ask for more bread after the first serving. \n\nIt had been a while since I had a 5 star culinary experience! There was not one dish that wasn't exceptional. The presentation was beautiful but the flavor profiles were just stellar in each dish. We chose 2 plates from the fjord menu and 2 from the beta menu.\n\nThe Poached Lobster was delish! Perfect pieces of lobster topped with caviar. It had this unbelievable foam on it. Usually, I'm not too much into the foam as I see it more like a culinary fad than anything, but I do not oppose it in this dish. \n\nThe House Cured Salmon was great....clean tasting and very fresh. I liked the Swedish mustard on the watermelon turnips. It looked so pretty but tasted even better! \n\nThe Porter Braised Ox Cheek was super flavorful and tender. The portion was quite large. I especially loved the roasted beet root mash. It added some beautiful color to the plate and was so yummy.\n\nThe Saddle of Venison was cooked perfectly on the rare side. Bf thought it was a little gamey but I didn't mind it. That's how venison usually is. The Scandinavian gratin was served in a separate small bowl and it was so goood! It was just creamy and cheesy but not overpowering. \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't save any room for dessert so I cannot comment on anything from the godis menu. Rest assure, there will be a next time!

Was a soft spoken and elegant drink. It would be this person's birthday soon, so for the week, we would do much celebrating, starting right here.\n\nOur Scandinavian meals began with the Taste of Pickled Herring. Three variants existed on the plate with assortments of mustard and other pickled vegetables, plus bread to serve it atop. Quite delectable. Then ordered our Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast.\n\nUp next was our Foie Gras dish. Unfortunately, although we were looking forward to this one, we thought it was possibly burned...\n\nLuckily, our hopes sprung back when served both the Braised Elk and the Wild Boar. These two dishes, Pl\u00e4j knew inside and out! Meat was tender, aromatic and flavorful for each.\n\nAt this point, we just so happened to get treated to a special dessert wine glass by a friend who knew of our whereabouts -- we were given a glass of Porto! Thanks much to them!\n\nIt was perfectly timed, too, because we were starting to receive our Dark Smoked Cheese and Fruits Dessert Plate! It even had a lit candle on the side for the birthday event. These cheeses were not typical cheeses -- I can only describe them as smoky, delicate and \"not cheese\" because it was so unusually gracious! Porto was surely its complement!\n\nIn all, minus the Foie, everything else had here was very good. Excellent dining experiences definitely can exist here, particularly with the helpful service. I'd come back just for the dessert plate -- it was that exquisite!", "author": "Garett T."}

Opening in July 2012, Plaj took over the old Ovation at the Opera space (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-at-the-opera-san-francisco) and is a welcome addition to Hayes Valley. \n\nLately, I have been having a string of good luck with new restaurants joining the San Francisco foodie scene with Plaj being one of them. All the dishes we had were perfectly executed and left me wanting more. \n\nF O O D\nWith a seasonal menu, Plaj's menu is divided into four categories: Hagen (Veggies), Fjord (Seafood), Beta (Meat), and Godis (Dessert). Everything is tapas sized with the exception of the Beta which is more of a small entr\u00e9e portion. Two dishes per a person should be sufficient. \n\nDo NOT ignore the cocktails menu. If you're a Gin gal (*ahem Janice C.*), you must try the Bols Danish Gin. With just two Bols and club sodas (I have a very high alcohol tolerance), I was ready to drop it like it's hot. I highly doubt the Golden Girls and Matlock & Co. crowd would have have appreciated my \"performance\" though. *Le sigh*\n\n*Taste of Herring: Saffron Tomato, Coriander Chili-Lime & Ginger Smoked Soy ($14) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=1cUKkQtQHWGEpZPmwtBVeQ#1cUKkQtQHWGEpZPmwtBVeQ\nA trio of tenderly soft herring each with their own distinct nuances from the various spices, this is one of the must order dishes. \n\n*Krondill Poached Lobster Skagen, White Fish Caviar, Horseradish, Avocado & Chili ($20) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=1cUKkQtQHWGEpZPmwtBVeQ#eTZGlUSRC1X69Ljj3oGSDg\nA dish that would delight any lobster fan, the lobster was perfectly poached leaving it deliciously soft and sweet. The abundance of foam surprisingly added a delightful creaminess to the lobster while the caviar gave a pop of saltiness and the chili a slight kick. \n\n*Beef Tenderloin, Sunchoke Puree, Spring Onion, Danish Blue & Tarragon Jus ($24) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=1cUKkQtQHWGEpZPmwtBVeQ#H7BQCeG3V02hTLjrxpboZg\nNicely seared to a rare as requested, the beef tenderloin was tender enough to cut with a butter knife. The salty pungency of the Danish blue cheese and anise piquancy of the tarragon gave an interesting but lovely dimension to the dish. The only thing was missing was a texture contrast. \n\n*Porter Braised Ox Cheek, Roasted Beet Root, Fried Onions & Horseradish ($22) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=1cUKkQtQHWGEpZPmwtBVeQ#eZYTZK6V0fbXJyDzzN2BEw\nShort ribs lovers would go ga-ga over this must order Porter braised ox cheeks. Insanely soft, you can tell the ox cheek was slowly braised for hours as it melts in your mouth. Along with the beet root, a healthier rendition of mash potatoes and the scrumptious fried onions, it was a flawless dish with incredibly balanced flavors and textures. \n\nS E R V I C E\nOur waitress, Hilary was just as delightful as the food at Plaj. She was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Food service was amazingly fast which seems like a good sign for those wanting to have a nice dinner before a performance. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nClassy and dated (even though they did a revamp), Plaj seems well suited for the older opera crowd. The attempt to freshen things up with the communal table and pumpkin metals seats seems out of place with the dim lighting, ivory walls, and rich wood furnishings: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=1cUKkQtQHWGEpZPmwtBVeQ#oKtyuN59IgAlPOLfvad_EA.

The place is classy and intimate being a small room with a lot of dark wood paneling, but it still has a casual feel as the servers will get to know you and joke with you. We liked that the bill came wedged into a Scandinavian Lonely Planet book.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect in terms of Scandinavian dining, but I found it was like nouveau American but with a slight emphasis on dill/pickled flavors. Every dish was exquisitely well presented and it's clear they care about every detail of preparation. \n\n~~Hagen~~\n* What asparagus, lobster mushrooms, fennel confit, egg 65 degrees C, hollandaise sauce, soft rye croutons ($15) - 4.5 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=Y6ffw2SK-fK7i7XE8FOHqQ#mHm7GoG4ifxAPuQ2wY4owg\nI absolutely loved the egg - it had the perfect runny texture and made everything taste better, especially the croutons!\n\n~~FJORD~~\n* Taste of Herring: saffron tomato, coriander chili-lime, ginger smoked soy ($14) - 3 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=Y6ffw2SK-fK7i7XE8FOHqQ#o7Io_89fWlsr9b5QkP9CgA\nThe herring was fresh, but I would say the difference in flavors between the three were a little too subtle. \n\n* Krondill poached lobster: Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili ($20) - 3.5 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=Y6ffw2SK-fK7i7XE8FOHqQ#Y6ffw2SK-fK7i7XE8FOHqQ\nThe lobster had a great freshly-caught-crunchy texture.

The salmon was done perfectly, with just enough pink and seared just right.

Everything else was kind of light, not super filing, but this dish was a great way to end the meal. The beet root was subtly sweet and had a good creamy texture, and the ox cheek was super tender, the sauce thick, and was well flavored.\n\n~~GODIS~~\n* Chocolate torte, orange-vanilla cream, house made cloudberry sorbet, meringue - 4.5 stars\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feufnVt4k_t2eJakDU1bAw?select=Y6ffw2SK-fK7i7XE8FOHqQ#E_1TzJOdkt9eiEiwJTGk4A\nThe chocolate was delicious - moist and dense, with a slightly crunch and drier crust. This diversity in texture and density made every bite great. The sorbet was refreshing and a great compliment. The meringue was just a little dry/hard, and if you got too big of a chunk it just got stuck to your teeth - something less sticky (sliced almonds?) may have been a little better. Maybe I'm just picky about meringue.. but overall this was a great dessert!\n\nFull menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=cw6LyqUyitQ4oeWXK11gNg#cw6LyqUyitQ4oeWXK11gNg", "author": "Ziyan C."}

It is winter, and Scandinavian sounded a bit more appropriate and a little more adventurous.\n\nThe place is small, so reservations are essential.  We were seated by the fire place.  Very warm ambiance.  We started with soup and salads.  The split pea soup was excellent as were the salads.  The \"Ecopia\" salads had apples and pomegranate seeds and was excellently dressed.  We also got an order of bread.  Don't skip the bread; it's delicious.  One of the party tried the aquavit, an infused vodka, opting for the entry level \"pear\" flavor.  I went with an Icelandic Pale Ale that was very good.\n\nOur main courses were elk, lobster, and scallops.  All were excellent.  It might have been smart to take a picture of the scallops so people know what a perfectly cooked scallop looks like: a good brown crust on the top/bottom, but white and tender in the middle.  The elk, two thick medallions cooked medium rare with a nice sauce/jus, chanterelles, berries, and some young, fresh Brussel sprouts (that were sliced open and not those dreadful large pods).\nThe food was all five star.  The proportions were appropriate.  Unfortunately, with the ballet calling, we couldn't stay for dessert.", "author": "TennisBum P."}

We went here for dinner after a show at the Jazz center. The show was on a Sunday, and we were very lucky to find free street parking about a block away.\nThe menu is done in tapas style. It is recommended to order two dishes per person and share. They start off by bringing the homemade bread in small paper bags. The bread is dense whole-grain and appears slightly rustic, similar to bread made in bread machines. I thought it was okay, but I wished it was a little bit chewier and less dry.\nWe started off with an organic roasted beet salad ($16). The beads were sweet and well done, going well with the watercress and hazelnuts. The sauce was some type of berry spread and the menu mentioned truffles, however, we did not notice that flavor. The taste of herring plate ($14) featured cold herring prepared in three ways. I am not a fan of herring, but it was nice to try flavors that are not common in American cuisine. Mustard, dill, onions paired with a slightly fishy flavor.\nNext was a potato dumpling dish which was covered with a lingon berry sauce ($14). This one was supposed to have lardons, but it also seem very mildly flavored. This dish was not memorable.\nThe charcuterie plate ($18) was nicely presented on a slab of wood. It featured house-made cured lamb & pork belly, and boar salami. It wasn't that different from regular salami. The chicken liver pat\u00e9, however , was very delicious. Super silky and savory. It went very well with the butter toasted rye bread. DH really liked this dish. I didn't think it was a good value.\nBoar belly with Swedish mash and brussels sprouts ($24) - the belly was super tender without being overly fatty. Flavor was really good and not too gamey.\nSwedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce and mashed potatoes ($17) for a full order. The meatballs definitely seemed more real. They had less filler than the stuff from IKEA. They were okay, but not spectacular. The mashed potatoes seemed too gummy. The pickles were nice and crisp.\nThe highlight of the meal was the house gnocchi with bright green kale sauce ($23). This featured special hen of the woods mushrooms and cheese. The flavors were complex and very delicious, even though they seemed unfamiliar.\nThe braised ox cheek ($25) with fried onion was described as \"okay\" by DH. This dish was overly salty. DH said, \"it was underwhelming based on the great Yelp reviews we read.\" The fried onions were soggy and oil-logged. The other items did not pair well with the ox cheek, such as the raw granny Smith apple bits. Not recommended.\nFor dessert we got the Swedish pancake which was surprisingly good. It is like a cr\u00eape with fresh berries and whipped cream. It was well executed and pretty light, not too sweet.\n3 1/2 stars would be the perfect rating for this restaurant. DH said he would go back. I'm on the fence about that. The modern decor is nice and our server was also very good. some dishes were hits and other dishes were misses.

Definitely a place to visit pre or post ballet / opera / symphony. (In fact, that reflects the general clientele.) Food is different, innovative, positively surprising, and delicious.\n\nWe split:\n- Salad: with apples, cheese, dill vinaigrette, and candied almonds ($13)\n- Potato Dumplings: with onion ragout, lingonberry, lardon, brown butter ($14)\n- 2 House Caraway Smoked Salmon: with roasted radishes, fennel, lemon cr\u00e8me ($18)\n- Chocolate Cake: with vanilla cream, caramel brittle, and hazelnut ice cream ($9)\n\nThe salad was, in my opinion, the best dish. It was light, extremely flavorful, original, and refreshing.\n\nThe potato dumplings were also very tasty (definitely heavier than the salad - which should be obvious if you serve something in a pool of brown butter). The lingonberry was a wonderful complement to the potato- I thought this alone would've made the dish - my B, however, thought that the lardon was important to the entire bite.\n\nThe Smoked Salon was good, but not great. I enjoyed the lemon cr\u00e8me and the caviar - but I personally would've preferred more salt (perhaps not for everyone). Would likely not order this again - but they had so many delicious 'fjord' (seafood) dishes that I wanted to try - that it's probably for the best.\n\nLastly, the chocolate cake was a bit heavy - but very hearty! The caramel brittle was the perfect amount of crunch. I'm not sure the vanilla cream added too much to the bite - but all-around, a solid dessert.\n\nService was extremely fast, very professional, but perhaps a bit stuffy.\n\nRecommend!

We had reservations at 8:30pm and were promptly seated. The server, Chloe went over the menu with us and we proceeded to order. We ordered 4 apps and 4 entr\u00e9e and requested bread since we heard so much about their bread. The server came back and told us they're out of the gnocchi and we switched it out for another app.\n\nAll 5 of our apps came out at the same time, about 20 mins later, but still no bread. The server told us she'll bring out the bread once it's ready. We got our bread, finished our apps - the cheese plate, burrata and the lobster was good. The smoked salmon and octopus was just ok. the texture of the octopus was too chewy. The server came by to tell us she's going on break, took our empty water bottle and said someone else will fill in for her while she's gone. A person did come over to take our plates and that was the end of the first course.\n\nWe sat at our table for about 20 more minutes, with no plates/silverware and the hostess actually came over to ask if we're all set and if we'll like to see the dessert menu. Then we told her that we haven't even gotten our entrees yet. She went and checked on it and told us it'll be right out.\n\nAnother 20 minutes went by and our food came out, everything was lukewarm except the temperature of the restaurant! For our entrees, we ordered the halibut, squab breast, meatballs and potato dumpling. The potato dumpling was my favorite, the sauce was good. the halibut and meatballs were ok. The squab breast was not what we expected...and here's the issue. The squab breast was cooked medium rare....There were 2 pieces of squab that was very rare, and when we asked her, she just said, \"oh, it's suppose to be medium rare\" and proceeded to convince us that there's nothing was wrong with the meat.  I think the server should've informed us when we ordered, what if I can't eat raw meat? Anyhow, after some back and forth, she offered to make us a new one. but we were so tired of sitting in the hot restaurant waiting for food, that we declined.\n\nAfter we were done w/ our entrees, my friend really wanted to order their princess cake and the crispy waffles. At this time, the server also told us they'll take the squab off the check.\n\nThe princess cake was better than I expected. It's princess cake in a jar with a sheet of marzipan on top. The crispy waffles were disgusting. It was cold and burnt, it tasted like stale waffles. We took at bite and left it on our plate. When the server cleared the plate, she didn't ask/notice/care that we left the entire dessert pretty much un-touched.\n\nOn my way out, we noticed that the restaurant had a fan at the hostess desk and at the bar facing the bartender. This shows they obviously know that the restaurant is hot and too uncomfortable, even for the hostess standing by the door!\n\nOverall, a few dishes were good but the entire experience was terrible.", "author": "Terry C."}

The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere - the entrance is in the back and past a small boutique hotel lobby. We were seated in the far back at the communal table - we were a party of 6 - and was surprised our chairs were metal (and they were uncomfortably cold when you first sat in them) unlike the cushy upholstered chairs in the rest of the restaurant. \n\nFood was good but the appetizer portions were tiny. The $20 cheese plate had the tiniest portions of cheese and crackers which meant each of us had barely a taste. Herring sampler was good but again not enough for each of us to try everything. We also tried the elk tartare, foie gras, potato dumplings, fish fritters, smoked cheese/beet plate. For main dishes we tried their signature Swedish meatballs (almost liked the mashed potatoes better than the meatballs), black cod, and sausage. Again, all pretty good food. \n\nFor dessert we tried the deconstructed princess cake which was awesome, chocolate cake, apple cake and Swedish pancakes. My fav was the princess cake. \n\nWhat was disappointing was the inattentive service and also wasn't sure why our server changed for dessert. At a place like this I would expect more personal, friendly service and a server who would engage with patrons a little more. And no one checked in on us after our main courses were served which also contributed to the overall subpar experience. \n\nI'm willing to give it another try if I knew they would expand the menu or have specials because just in this single experience we tried just about everything they had to offer.", "author": "Miki C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-09", "description": "Since graduating college, I made a bucket list of food/cuisines I want to taste at least once before I die.  One of the few remaining line items is Scandinavian fine dining (Ikea fulfilled my Scandinavian cheap dining).  Now that I've been out of college for a little more a decade, I was pretty hyped up when my wife booked a table of 4 at Plaj before our Matilda play nearby at the Orpheum.\n\nI walked in to the building which at first I thought I was at the wrong destination.  A few steps in, I realized that Plaj is the restaurant/bar area of the hotel in which the two share the same real estate.  Immediately sitting down, I ordered a gimlet to loosen myself up for the meal.  I know nothing about Scandinavian cuisines other than Swedish meatballs and swedish fish candy (just kidding).  My wife and I along with our two friends decided to try as many items as possible with the reasoning that we don't eat Scandinavian cuisines often.\n\nThe appetizers ordered were the elk tartare, summer mushrooms, crayfish soup, and potato dumplings.  If you fancy tartare, the elk tartare won't disappoint.  Mix the egg yolk on top and spread the meat onto your crackers or the complimentary bread, and you have yourself a winner.  Simply marvelous.  The summer mushrooms are.... just a plate of mushrooms.  Refreshing but unsatisfactory unless your vegetarian.  The smell reminds me of mushrooms on pizza though.  The crayfish soup was severely underwhelming.  There's a little cognac taste but other than that, it's best avoided.  The potato dumplings are an interesting specimen.  The dumplings were cooked well but was drenched in butter, lingonberry, and bacon.  The butter made it really heavy to down but the sweet lingonberry tricks your mind that it's sweet not savory.  Without the lingonberry, I don't think I would have finished my portion.  \n\nMain dishes include the Halibut Salmon Fritter special, full order of swedish meatballs, saddle of elk, and the taste of herring (one of us wasn't too hungry).    Salmon fritters are fried fish.  Need I say more?  Good but there's better options on the menu to choose from.  Saddle of elk felt like the filet mignon of elk.  Juicy tendy but still wanting more.  The swedish meatballs comes with 5 in a full order, has a nice brown sauce with lingonberry.  I'm not trying to compare Ikea with Plaj, but I would be satisfied with Ikea's meatballs to be honest.  This is fine dining but I don't see the value in ordering meatballs here.  Order the elk saddle instead.  The last item for the not-so-hungry friend is the taste of herring.  It's essentially a wooden plate of 3 different fish with crackers and sauce.  It reminded me of the cold fish for breakfast or the ones you find at a buffet.\n\nOverall, a decent experience.  The one thing that irked me is the waitress forgetting our 4 glasses of water.  After we received our entrees and asked for water again, she acted as if we just ordered water.  Short term memory?  Then, she spilled one of the glasses of water over my back which proceeded to drip to my bottom.  She said, oh it's just a small spill and that was the end of it.  I don't remember her name but she sort of looked like that Australian actress Rose Byrne.  Hopefully, next time she remembers to give a sincere apology otherwise it really ruins the ambiance and experience.", "author": "Ronald L."}

Our waitress was really helpful and sweet but I can't give 5 stars because it took almost 10 minutes for her to come over to our table and start our meal. For a place known to be popular before shows this baffles me (we were there before the ballet).\n\nBut once she came over it was great! I had the butternut squash soup with crab which was amazing. Then the bf and I shared the charcuterie plate, a salad, herring, and the elk. The charcuterie was the only thing Id say was just ok - the pate was amazing but the rest was good but not notable. The salad was awesome with green apples, nuts, grapes and a dill vinaigrette. I had never had herring before but loved it - came with a lemon creme, pickled carrots and potatoes. And finally the elk... Phenomenal. \n\nAll in all very impressed and will definitely be back!", "author": "Lizzie S."}

I went in a group of 4 and we all shared appetizers, drinks, dinner and dessert, so I got to sample lots of food in one sitting. This was single-handedly the finest food experience I've ever had. It's been a few months, but I still recall the visit with great pleasure and wanted to post a review. We started with the herring platters, they were super tasty and fresh and I loved every little thing they piled on the platter. We tried the smoke salmon and halibut fritters, very perfectly crispy, not oily, and super tasty filling inside. My cocktail was green, I forget the flavor, maybe it was the Copenhagen, but it was beautifully bright and perfect. My dinner is hard to remember (I went 6 months ago) but it was a perfectly pan-cooked fish, stacked up and at the base was an asparagus or pea mash; It was excellent, but it's not on the menu right now. For dessert I had the Northern Lights: a chocolate terrine that was smooth and rich, passion fruit sorbet was a bright and unexpected but perfect contrast, and the soft meringue was delicious and fun to break into to get to the chocolate and sorbet.  \n\nWe all shared each others desserts and dinners and had a ball! \n\nCompliments to the staff, my friend called in a reservation, but we got mixed up and came early, but they made time for us. The staff was super friendly in a quiet way, they very proud of their work and food, but in a way that impressed me, but there was no sense of superiority. Gradually, as we delighted in every round of food, the service warmed up and they shared lots of info about how the aquavit is made, suggestions and though we were the last table seated, they did not rush us at all. \n\nI usually don't go around thinking I want a 5 star symphony of food and looking for the perfect experience, but damned if that isn't exactly the experience we got!", "author": "margaret c."}

Parking can be tricky in this area, but we got lucky!  \n\nWe came here to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Reservations were for 7:00 p.m., but we arrived early.  We sat at the bar and had drinks.  \"A\" and our friend, Jenny, ordered the elderflower gimlet. It was recommended by the bartender.   I took a sip and it was quite refreshing.  It wasn't bitter from the gin and it had a nice tartness to it.  I wanted something more on the fruity side so the bartender recommended me to try The Pl\u00e4jer (pronounced player).  It's made of Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Dried Apricot Cinnamon Gastrique, and Strawberry.  The drink was okay, not too sweet.  However, it left a yucky aftertaste of the bourbon in my mouth, which I wasn't a fan of.  In some ways, it reminded me of Malibu Rum.  \n\nI've never had Scandinavian food so I was looking forward to the dinner.  Their menu is tapa style so the plates are meant to be shared.  However, we only ordered a few appetizers and everyone ordered their own entree as they did offer some items that were entree like.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered:\nSmoked salmon fritters, grilled lemon, dill aioli, arugula ($12) - Wasn't impressed with this plate.  I didn't taste the smokiness from the salmon.  Instead, it tasted like it wasn't fresh (seafood-y taste).  \n\nCharcuteri: Fennalar-salted lamb, in-house syltrulle-cured pork belly, creminelli wild boar salami, in-house rullep\u00f6lse-cured lamb belly, spicy gooseberry jam, grilled rye ($16) - The cured pork belly was good, but the lamb and lamb belly was awful from what I was told.  I don't eat lamb, so I didn't even bother to try it.  \n\nDungeness crab - There were about six scoops of crab and a scoopful of cucumber sorbet, which was probably the best part of the dish.  The cucumber sorbet was very refreshing.  \n\nEntree:\n\nWe all ordered different entrees so I can only write about what I ate.  \n\nBerkshire pork belly, swedish mash, brussels sprouts ($24) - Me and two of my friends ordered this dish.  Funny thing was the size of the pork belly on each of our dishes were different sizes.  The pork belly was tasty and very tender.  The Swedish mash was either a sweet potato or carrot puree.  \"A\" was expecting it to be the creamy mash potato so he was a bit disappointed.  \n\nVerdict: Nice experience and happy that I tried Scandinavian food.", "author": "Candice H."}

It had bitter dark chocolate, passion fruit ice cream, hazelnut brittle, and a merengue.  When all the flavors were put together, it was delicious!  Individually, they were quite strong.  The chocolate was really bitter, the passion fruit very tart, the merengue was very citrusy.. The only thing that was muted was the brittle.  Together it was harmonious.\n\nThe waiter also gave us a dessert wine, which was just a bit sweeter than my wine.\n\nI would love to come back here again to eat dinner.

Pl\u00e4j is located inside of the Inn at the Opera House, and they have a little sign on the sidewalk to point you in the right direction. I made reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night, and we were seated right when we arrived. The restaurant was about half full at that time, but they seated a bunch of tables right after us so it filled up pretty quickly. I loved that they had booth style seating, but you sink down pretty deeply in the booth, so it wasn't the most comfortable. We tried:\n\n-Golden Sapphire (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#lLz7UA8X3M_FiHQR3RSAcA): This was one of the featured drinks on the menu, and we wanted to try it since it had Aquavit in it along with saffron. However, it was really gross- the saffron overpowered all the other flavors and made the whole drink taste soapy. Skip!\n-Complimentary Rye Bread & Butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA): Eh.. not my favorite. The rye bread was super dry and not very flavorful, and it took a lot of butter for it to be edible. \n-Krondill Poached Lobster (Skagen, White Fish Caviar, Horseradish, Avocado, Chili, $23, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#xyn-kgQdslXkMu8fPXkIVA): AMAZING, and a must order! The lobster was cooked perfectly, and all the components worked really well together in this dish.\n-House Cured Atlantic Salmon Gravlax (Dill Puree, Swedish Mustard, Lemon Cr\u00e8me, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#KLsx-_wfk2thmwuzi9yFeQ): Just ok. The salmon was really fresh, but I didn't like the Swedish mustard or other components much. I wouldn't order this again.\n-Potato Dumpling Kumla (Onion Ragout, Lingonberry, Lardon, Brown Butter, $14, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#b-5xY5NVytiNxmMnHSxnzw): Also delicious! The brown butter gave the potato dumplings a nice sear, and I loved the lingonberry it was served with. A must order!\n-Swedish Meatballs (Potato Puree, Pan Gravy, Lingonberry, Pickled Cucumber, Full Order, $17, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#fs6dl_tsvQ2bBN4SaG52aA): I'm not a fan of Swedish meatballs, but wanted to give this version a try since there are so many rave reviews for it. However, I remain unconvinced- I didn't like this version either. The meatballs weren't flavorful in my opinion, and the potato puree was just so so. Although they give you a huge portion of potato puree, I wouldn't order this again.\n-In-House Princess Cake (Raspberry Jam, Pastry Cream, Marzipan, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pl%C3%A4j-scandinavian-restaurant-and-bar-san-francisco?select=42EZWRP6sN3aEPFoiOkDOA#GBpiBhgbH-XqpjKhnWOJ3A): Pretty good, but not amazing. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet, but it needed a little more cake to pastry cream ratio. It was also very difficult eating this dish out of a little glass jar. I would get this again.\n\nThe service was solid here, and they were attentive without being overbearing. However, our waitress didn't exude a lot of warmth/friendliness, which would have improved the dining experience. Overall, I would come back to try additional dishes and order the lobster and potato dumplings again.

This should be fixed, no one wants to have a meal sinking into a pillow and seat that is far too low. \n\nFor the food: \n1. Beet salad: was nice, the herbs were fresh and gave it a nice nutty flavor, but it was a bit bland, while the sauce was gorgeous in color, it didn't taste like anything. \n\n2. The lobster: great presentation, loved the foam and delicate preparation and amazing lobster, but for $28 we felt cheated.  It was not an entre sized portion more of a light appetizer.  \n\n3. The squab, which my friend was a bit hesitant to try but I told her it was a really great meat dish and very tender.  This unfortunately was neither, there was hardly any meat on the dish, it was too tough to cut with the butter knives and they also had the little legs with claws on there.  I thought that was creative but not for everyone and certainly not when we had to hunt for the meat.  I've had amazing squab before and this missed the mark on ever level and the portion was again very small.\n\n4. We were still hungry so we opted for dessert, the molten chocolate cake.  How can you go wrong with this? It was overcooked and burned, and not molten but dry and flaky.  We told our waitress and she took it off the bill.\n\nAll and all this was a disappointing meal and I'm not coming back anytime soon unless it's for drinks at the bar.", "author": "Inga W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-24", "description": "This was my first time having Scandinavian food, other than IKEA which I don't know if that necessarily counts as real food. There are not really a lot of Scandinavian restaurants in the Bay Area, other than this one and one in San Mateo, so I guess this place earns points when you want Scandinavian food in SF or you want to try it for the first time.\n\nThis is not on the normal Hayes Valley strip of restaurants, but on Fulton tucked away in a hotel. You could walk by, blink, and probably miss this place. It's tucked away inside an old-fashioned hotel and you'll walk down a corridor to get to the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant looks really old, and reminds me of some of the old bars in Nob Hill - you'll almost feel like you went back to the 70s or 80s.\n\nThe food here is expensive and the portions are small - you know, where you feel like with every bite you may as well be eating dollar bills. And the at the end of your meal, still feeling kind of hungry (or maybe I just eat a lot). This place is best with 2 people, because many of the plates are meant to be shared, and if you had 4 people, you may just be trying one bite of each dish.\n\nIn-House Bread (complimentary, then $3 for each additional bag) - I don't know what I expected here, but wasn't really blown away by the bread. It came in a cute brown bag, and I expected it to be hot, but it was just lukewarm and just okay. It had a bit of a pumpkiny-spice taste to it. I don't eat a lot of carbs, but made an exception because everyone raved about the bread but I wouldn't pay for an extra portion or probably eat it again.\n\nClassic Herring ($16) - Probably 4-5 pieces of herring, and when the plate comes you may be searching for where the herring is on the plate since it will be buried amongst the sour cream, picked red onions, and all the other vegetables / sauces on the plate. It comes with 2 rye crackers which were pretty tasteless. The fish was good, but pretty covered in a mustardy-cream sauce. I do think it's worth trying since it's very traditional, but expensive for what you get\n\nUltra Green Salad ($14) - This salad was delicious with apricots, strawberries, cheese, a dill vinaigrette and candied almonds. I'd almost just get this salad and one other thing if I came back. The apricots, strawberries and almonds were a perfect trifecta and I'd love to be able to replicate whatever was in that dressing.\n\nPotato Dumpling ($15) - This is one of those dishes where you'll feel like you're eating a few dollars with every bite. This comes with 2 potato \"dumplings\" which are basically like a potato patty that is 3 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. There's not much there, so eat slowly - it pairs nicely with the onion and lingonberry, but it's a bit on the heavy side and wasn't all that special for me.\n\nSaddle of Elk ($35) - Again, one of those dishes where you wonder where the rest of it went. The elk was interesting - like steak, but more gamey, less fatty, and tasty, but nothing super special. They had 2 mushrooms and some lingonberries. I wouldn't recommend getting this.\n\nSwedish Meatballs (3 for $15, 5 for $18) - Not sure who did the pricing on the half and full portion of this dish, but it doesn't make a ton of sense since each meatball for the half portion is $5, and then if you want 2 extra, it's only $2 more. I'd get the full portion because this was delicious, but $5 per meatball is ridiculous. The meatballs were tender, soft, and flavorful, and paired nicely with the mashed potatoes.\n\nAebleskivers ($14) - We couldn't pronounce this, which meant it was probably very traditional. Think little donuts but more cake-like and not very fluffy / airy. There are 3 pieces with a disproportionately small amount of strawberries and vanilla cream on the side. You have to eat half of your bites without the fruit & cream otherwise there won't be enough. Please don't be so cheap with the fruit since $14 is a lot to spend for dessert.\n\nAll in all, an interesting experience with a lot of traditional dishes I had never tried before. Probably one of the few (if only) places you can get Scandinavian food and lingonberries, but I probably wouldn't make another trip back here. There are a ton of other places I can think of to spend $130 for 2 people (this did not include drinks) for more inventive and filling food. Come if you really want Scandinavian food, like to eat small portions, or need a slightly fancy place pre or post symphony and don't mind dropping a lot of money.", "author": "Christina L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-25", "description": "To celebrate Martin Luther King Day, we went out for a nice dinner, but unintentionally ended up eating food from the whitest culture in the world. :-/\n\nDidn't realize that this would be a traditional fine dining experience, but it was certainly welcome! We ordered the following:\n\n***ORGANIC BEET ROOT: Sausalito Springs watercress, P\u00e9rigord black truffle, hazelnuts, v\u00e4sterbotten\n\nOh my gosh was this good, maybe the best beet dish ever. Divinely juicy & sweet beet with a nice meaty consistency, refreshing watercress, & gorgeously savory truffle oil and v\u00e4sterbotten, which has a nice Parmesan flavor and feel. Those crunchy & buttery hazelnuts just put it over the edge.\n\n***BRAISED OX CHEEK: beet pur\u00e9e, fried onion, red wine jus\n\nCheek meat, naturally tough, tastes damn good when it's braised until the proteins break down to give that beautiful melting texture, pretty much the best texture any piece of meat could hope to have. The beet pur\u00e9e seemed to be mixed into mashed potatoes, which was aesthetically pleasing and quite interesting, but it needed more butter (and garlic). The fried onion was pretty, but it could have been prepared more tantalizingly--it was hauntingly similar to a can of French's. I enjoyed the horseradish, but I was surprised that such a copious amount yielded minimal spiciness.\n\n***KRONDILL POACHED LOBSTER SKAGEN: white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili\n\nThis was a warm foamed cream broth of light flavor with chunks of chilled lobster that tasted a little bit like seafood salad (slightly mayonnaisey), which was a tad disappointing because the lobster was supple & fresh and had so much potential, but I guess that's the whole point of skagen. It's a shame that I didn't detect any caviar. The avocado was a nice touch.\n\n***NORWEGIAN SKREI WILD ARCTIC COD: creamed rainbow chard, Dungeness crab, butternut squash nage, bronze fennel\n\nThey apparently fly the cod in every 24 hours. So yeah, super fresh, and yet the flavor of the fish itself is a little boring. And the consistency is a little too firm to melt in your mouth. The chard was also kinda boring, like stir-fried Chinese greens, however, the Dungeness crab was everything it should have been, and the butternut squash puree was smooth & sumptuous.\n\n***GRASS FED ELK LOIN: pickled chanterelles, sunchoke gratin, juniper berry jus\n\nI would describe this dish as very German tasting, which is my best reference point. Meat with Cipollini onions and brown sauce with a berry kick. Others have mentioned that elk is gamey, but I didn't think so at all--in fact blindfolded I may have guessed steak. Nice and rare, just like I like it. The fact that the gratin used sunchoke made it very light and a pleasing accompaniment to the elk. Overall, this course was a very traditional-tasting dish prepared pleasantly, but not crap-your-pants out-of-this-world. \n\n***STAR ANISE POACHED D'ANJOU PEAR: almond ice cream, Italian meringue, biscuit\n\nI actually couldn't taste star anise in this, but it is strong stuff and that's probably a good thing. The sweet syrup had a can't-put-my-finger-on-it slightly strange flavor that I didn't care for. The pear itself had a consistency similar to canned pear, which is not necessarily bad--the creamy meringue made it into a favorable palate cleanser.\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nIn fine dining experiences, the first thing I ask myself is, \"Did they make any rookie mistakes?\" Pl\u00e4j made really no mistakes at all--everything was top notch. The second thing I ask myself is, \"Were there any dishes that I'd sell a kidney for?\" In this case, maybe the beet salad, but it was just a salad and kinda doesn't count. Every dish was interesting and ranged from quite to very delicious. But nothing stood out as \"Oh my gosh you must go here to try the ____\". Still, great restaurant, great experience, an ethnic rarely & novelty, and should probably be considered for a Michelin star at some point, for it was a superior experience to several starred restaurants we've been to.", "author": "Elliott D."}

Couldn't find any other place that served authentic Scandinavian food, and thought I give it a try based on people's review.\n\nPlaj was a little hard to find, but it sits in a small hotel right at the end of Fulton before Franklin. The restaurant is in the back in a cozy nook of the hotel. There's a full bar and the dining area is relaxing and modern. The menu was delivered on a clip board with drinks on the next page. The menu featured four categories: greens, seafood, meat, and dessert. The greens and seafood were described as \"to be shared,\" and the rest would be entree sized. \n\nThe menu items seemed modern and elegant with delicious appetizers such as potato dumpling that was delicate, like eating clouds of umami, served with lardons and a sweet lingonberry sauce. A white asparagus salad with a perfectly cooked poached egg and hollandaise sauce that was velvety and made you want to sop up the runny yolk from every inch of the plate. We shared the charcuterie plate that featured pork belly, lamb belly (never had, but glad I did), smoked leg of lamb, and wild boar salami - the tiniest slices of meat packing so much flavor! The taste of herring definitely brought you to the ocean. The ginger smoked soy herring was definitely my favorite, and was served with shaved bonito flakes. \n\nFor entrees, we had the braised ox cheeks that was uber delicate and melt-in-your-mouth that was served with a roasted beet puree and lots of freshly grated horseradish that made the dish clean and have a nice finish. My wife had the Sturgeon (substituted for the halibut), which we've never eaten before - the fish is so moist and delicate, almost like sea bass, and surprisingly didn't have any muddy flavor, considering they usually swim in muddy waters (I speak from experience fishing on the Sac river with my dad fighting a sturgeon for hours on end). My mom had the lobster that was topped with a foam, which was also good.\n\nThis is my first time eating Scandinavian food, so I have nothing to compare it to.

But by 7:40 we had only received the first 3 of the 5 courses in the tasting menu. None of the staff came by to inform us of a delay in the kitchen, but we could sense that something was off given the lengthy wait between the first 3 courses, and the agitation of the guests around us who were also attending the show.

The restaurant itself is housed inside a hotel.  Like some reviewers had previously mentioned, it's a bit warm inside and so to combat that, you'll probably spot a couple inconspicuous fans placed throughout.\n\nAfter being introduced to what dagen, hagen, fjord, and beta meant, my friend and I decided to order the following: \n\nScallops: Probably my least favorite of the night.  Seemed a bit rubbery, although I overheard a table close to us say that theirs was really good, so maybe there was just some inconsistency issues.  They ran out of blackberries, so they substituted it for raspberries instead.  Either way, I didn't see its purpose.\n\nOx cheeks: Good,  very flavorful.  Liked the cauliflower puree that comes with it.  Cutely shaped apples were placed randomly on the plate...but again, didn't really see its purpose.  \n\nHalibut: This was my friend's dish and because I tasted this AFTER I tried the ox cheeks, it was a bit on the bland side.  So, I can't really give a fair judgment on this one.\n\nPrincess cake: I've only had princess cake from Schubert's so I was curious to see whether it would taste the same.  And it pretty much did.  The only difference was that the cake here is a teensy but denser.  Still good though.  \n\nThis other dessert that resembled a baked alaska:  Surprisingly, this was my favorite of the night.  This consisted of a chocolate mousse/ganache layer topped with a lingonberry sorbet, which was then covered in meringue.  I don't usually like chocolate desserts but I really enjoyed this, despite the fact that I was stuffed already.\n\nOverall, the meal didn't live up to my expectations.  If I were to come back, I'd come back for the desserts.  Those were yummy.", "author": "Vanessa C."}

I can't deny that this food is the most authentic you'll find in the States, but I do feel that it's not quite up to par.\n\nThe ambiance is kind of blah. It's in a hotel, and the dining room is small and not Scandinavian-themed at all - just a dark, paneled room. \n\nAs far as the food is concerned, some of the plates seem a bit too Americanized, and though many ingredients are truly Scandinavian, it's not likely that everything is imported/flown in. The dessert menu is particularly not very Swedish - apple pie? Where's the Princess Cake?\n\nI found some of the appetizers delightful - the gravlax, for example. But the entrees were nothing special - the fish was a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nI didn't think the restaurant was too pricey for the Bay Area, and it was refreshing to not get huge American portions.

Even the name of this place, Pl\u00e4j, pronounced \"play\" (seriously, umlaut & all, that's how it's pronounced), is confusing. The titles of the dinner menu sections? Dagen, Hagen, Fjord & Beta. Yeah, that's a little unsettling to an English-speaking American.\n\nBut worry not & stay your trepidation. Any anxiety over a total & absolute lack of Swedish language skills is very short-lived. Service at Pl\u00e4j is top notch & they know most of their patrons will not be Swedish. The servers are perfectly happy describing, in great detail, every single dish on the menu\n\nThe girlfriend & I joined a couple friends for dinner on a Saturday night & that's exactly how it went down. Our server was friendly, appropriately eclectic for the setting & gave us the complete lowdown on the restaurant, the menu & Scandinavian food in general.\n\nFor your consideration follows everything I manged to sample, taste & eat:\n\n+ Smoked Halibut & Salmon Fritters w/ dill aioli\n+ Local Asparagus, King Trumpet Mushrooms, candied Fennel, Egg 65\u00b0C w/ hollandaise sauce, rye croutons\n+ Hjortonsylt, Cloudberry Jam, Norwegian flatbr\u00f8d\n+ Taste of Herring w/ saffron tomato, coriander chili-lime, ginger smoked soy\n+ Krondill Poached Lobster, Sk\u00e5gen w/ white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili\n+ All natural Elk Loin, V\u00e4sterbotten Pie w/ juniper berry jus, pickled chanterelles\n+ Swedish Meatballs, Potato Puree w/ pan gravy, lingonberry, pickled cucumber\n+ Chocolate Kladdkaka, Vanilla Cream, house-made Hazelnut Ice Cream\n+ Cardamom Cr\u00e8me Brulee, Mint, organic local Peaches\n\n& drink:\n\n+ Beet Up (cocktail): Tequila, Beet Nectar, Ginger Liqueur, Orange Juice\n+ Mad Viking Night Raid DK 11% (beer-Imperial Stout)\n\nI got to try quite a few dishes & a good wide variety of Pl\u00e4j's menu. Nearly everything was magnificently divine. 1 well-composed bite of the Lobster, incorporating all of that dish's elements, was arguably 1 of the best overall single bites of food I've ever had.\n\nThe Elk Loin was ridiculously tender while still being gamy like Elk should be. & the Swedish Meatballs? If you plan on ever eating at the Ikea restaurant again, avoid the Swedish Meatballs at Pl\u00e4j. There's no going back. The only tiniest of a letdown was the Asparagus, it was merely very good.\n\nWhat about the Hjortonsylt, the V\u00e4sterbotten Pie & the Kladdkaka? What are those & how were they? Sorry, no spoilers here. To find out, you'll have to be daring, make reservations at Pl\u00e4j & go find out for yourself.\n\nBut relax & take comfort in knowing that even if you don't have a clue about what you're getting into, all of it will be transcendentally superb. Because when it comes to handing out glowing recommendations for a restaurant, such as this review, I don't pl\u00e4j.\n\n(see what I did there?)", "author": "John M."}

Their bread, which is made by Acme, was rye, and warm and delicious, with home made butter. I tried a glass of aquavit, but ended up hating it as it had a very anise herbal flavor, but if you're into jaeger meister or fernet you'd probably love the stuff.\n\nThe rest of the meal only got a lot better after this. The menu is divided into 4 sections, small appetizers, from the earth (salads) from the sea and from the land. We ordered one salad, one fish dish and one meat dish.\n\nThe \"salad\" was a selection of fresh roasted vegetables with a poached egg and it was incredible. Each piece of veggie was cooked to perfection and had its own unifying flavor and it was all bound together well with the creamy poached egg (with hollandaise sauce, I might add). \n\nNext course was the herring, which I personally loved. It was served with finely diced onion and some cold boiled potatoes, and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe final dish was an entree sized dish, braised ox cheeks in a red wine sauce.

The sauce was thick and rich with perfectly matched vegetables.\n\nWe didn't get dessert because by this point we were both pretty full.

I found the cream sauce a bit too rich and overwhelming after a while, though\n\nSwedish meatballs with potato puree, pan gravy, lingonberries and pickled cucumbers - You can't go to a Scandinavian restaurant and not try the meatballs. That's like going to a Japanese restaurant and not trying the sushi. I liked everything about this dish except the pickled cucmbers. Authentic perhaps, but way too sour for my liking (and I love sour things!)\n\nKladdkaka with vanilla sauce - Dessert #1. Amazingly moist cake with a smooth, rich sauce. We could not stop eating this.\n\nCardamom creme brulee - Dessert #2. Cardamom is my favorite spice in the whole wide world, so this dessert was just perfection to me. \n\nIn addition, we got the Kronan Sour, Elderflower Gimlet and The Plajer cocktails. Of the three, the Kronan Sour was the best. I liked the unique spin on one of my favorite cocktails, the Pisco Sour. Service was attentive and friendly, as one would expect at a restaurant like this. I'm not sure I was so blown away that I would go out of my way for a second meal here, but I'd definitely recommend it to first-timers.", "author": "Josephine L."}

I had to know so I found it, Marnie S' 2 star review was a fresh 17 hours old. I'm writing this pretty much just to spite her. The herring was pedestrian, whatever. She actually complained about the parking, having to walk through a hotel lobby to get to the restaurant, the ambiance, and the fact that it wasn't as busy as she thought it should be for a Saturday night.

Quite simply, the food was unique and delicious, service was prompt but not too invasive, and the prices and portions were pretty fair.\n\nOur favorite dishes were probably the Gioia burrata salad and the roasted Mary's chicken breast. Although we also loved the sardines dish (which they may or may not have, as they seem to change their appetizers) and the poached lobster. We also got the Swedish meatballs dish, which I liked, but the meatballs didn't seem so Swedish to me (I've been eating Swedish meatballs my entire life!)\n\nFor dessert we got the Saffron doughnuts which had a nice crispy, sugary outside and a soft saffron inside. I loved it, but I'm probably biased since I'm a sucker for saffron :)\n\nI also recommend trying some of the cocktails. Like the food, they're also pretty unique as they bring a lot of Swedish flavors to them. Try the Tulip!", "author": "Andrew D."}

I got their salmon gravlax and potato dumpling kumla, while the mister got the cheese plate and Swedish meatballs. The plates are moderately sized so if you are a big eater you might want to have a third.\n\nThe gravlax was not really out of the ordinary, delicious, but totally overshadowed by the amazing cheese plate. The cheeses were crumbled or sliced into pieces, arranged on a big wooden trunk, along with jam, bread, crackers and fruit. It was rather large even for a huge cheese eater like the mister, and I happily helped him along.\n\nThen came the kumla, which was soaked in brown butter and served with pork belly. It induced so much guilty pleasure. I also had a bite of the meatballs, and they were definitely better than the Ikea ones (I still like those!). The mister really liked them as well.\n\nWe ended our meal with the princess cake. Princess cake...in a jar. It was served like a tiramisu, layered cake, jam, and cream inside a jar, with the iconic green marzipan sealing it. What a lovely presentation! It was a decent princess cake, and I would get it again because it looked so cute, but I have definitely had better from another bakery.\n\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly, even offered the mister a taste of different aquavit flavours before he picked the one he wanted. Oh yes, there is house made aquavit, which is a rare sight around here!\n\nOverall the meal was very pleasant, the staff was nice, and we now know where to get our Scandinavian fix...if only it weren't so expensive.

I've experienced better.\" absolutely fits this restaurant, In short: the food was delicious, the servings were tiny, the atmosphere was lovely and the service was dismal.\n\nIn long....\nI made reservations for my family to come here in order to celebrate my brother's return from Afghanistan, and we were planning to see the Nutcracker afterwards. When we walked in, it took us a while to get seated in spite of having a reservation. No big deal. They eventually sat us and the waitress was kind enough to ask us if we needed to get going by a certain time [they must get a lot of people going to plays or shows that come there beforehand for dinner]. We happily said we needed to get going by 7.\n\nWhen we arrived for dinner we were starving. It said on the menu that there was one complimentary basket of bread, and additional ones could be ordered at a charge. I was kind of psyched to try this free/not free bread. It took a ridiculous amount of time for the bread to come to our table, as it did for anyone to bring us our drink orders once we ordered them. To be clear, the restaurant was pretty much deserted at this time and I saw at least two waiters and a bartender working. I can also say that not once during out meal did anyone's water glass get filled.\n\nOur courses were served extremely far apart, and not in the way that lets you eat a relaxed leisurely meal. In the way where you are seriously considering paying for a second basket of bread and running down the street to buy some fries at burger king. By our last course we had to scarf our food down and then track down our waitress in order to ask her for our check in order to make it to the ballet on time. Why did she even ask us if we had to leave by a certain time?\n\nThe food itself was served in extremely small portions [which is somewhat to be expected at a restaurant of this caliber] but every bite was freaking delicious. However, for the price the service and tiny portions did not make it worth it. I am glad I got to experience the food, but wouldn't recommend it to others or dine here a second time.", "author": "Courtney M."}

Four of us split the meatballs, the taste of herring plate, oysters, and the charcuterie platter. All of them were amazing, and it was just the right amount of food. Well, we did also have a cheese plate and an order of aeblskevers for dessert. All great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-01", "description": "I came here a few months ago a bit haphazardly after discovering that very few restaurants were open late at night in the area of SF I was in. As my previous exposures to Scandinavian food have mostly consisted of scarfing down a platter of meatballs at IKEA after an exhausting search for the right umlaut-ed piece of decor, I was totally game for trying something more upscale. Pl\u00e4j was that, and more. This place is not cheap, but it's the kind of elegant, thoughtful food that you almost don't want to eat, it's so precious looking.\n\nThe night that I was here, the crowd consisted of glossy-magazine families and what I could only imagine to be Russian oligarchs. So as a solo diner, I felt a teensy bit out of place, but the staff was fairly gracious and tucked me away at a nice, quiet table. I do think this place is better suited to groups, so that you can share a bunch of small plates. But Pl\u00e4j is a well-curated, small restaurant -- sort of boutique-y and exclusive, and if I hadn't been dressed in my polished work clothes, I would have felt out of place.\n\nThe food was inventive, and while I haven't been to Noma, I can sort of imagine that it would have items like Pl\u00e4j. While the plates are realllly small and pretty pricy, there's a lot of care put into the composition of flavors, textures, and colors of each dish. I really enjoyed the house-cured caraway smoked salmon with lemon cream, mustard, and dill - like a gravlax plate gone super-high-end. The flatbread bread they serve is great, with butter that tastes so different than anything I'd had before. I also had a beautifully curated salad that perfectly captured the best flavors of each component.\n\nThe beverage menu is solid. I had the Mor\u00f6tter & Rum, because it seemed like the most unusual drink (carrot juice, rum, gl\u00f6gg, and maple syrup), and it had flavors I find difficult to describe. It almost tasted healthy -- with an earthy, rich, woodsy flavor that I felt went really well with the food. \n\nMy bill was pretty high for the few small plates I had, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. Service is attentive, and the place is a real jewel.", "author": "Natasha G."}

There are some things on the menu that are amazing like the Foie Gras...don't hate me for saying that lol.   It really is amazing there though if you can get past the issue that California has \"outlawed\" it and then accepted it back into restaurants again.  I guess the geese have to be \"humanely treated\".  Seriously?????  \n  \nAnyway, aside from that issue....I found the squab to be soo dry.  Definitely not good imho.  The drinks were nice and the cheese plate was nice but it seems to never change which is kind of a drag.  We've been there several times before the ballet over a year and the cheese is exactly the same.  snore.  I found the appetizers light and refreshing but the main dishes sort of fell flat for me.  My husband had the swedish meatballs and he liked them but I certainly didn't find them to be anything special.   Everything I had seemed to have a sweet flavor which I'm not that fond of.  I don't like my food to have sweet components, so be forewarned in that regard.   Lots of things have lingonberry.\n\nIt's a good place to go prior to the opera or ballet since it is literally across the street from the opera house but would I go back for dinner?  Probably not.

Lots of wood makes for an old-world feel, but it's not stuffy.\n\nThis is a Scandinavian place, which is nice in that the menu is different than the usual French or Asian fare you find at most of the nicer restaurants in the city. \n\nAll of the food was impeccably plated. Visually, this was an incredibly beautiful meal.\n\nApps:\n\nPoached lobster with caviar and horseradish - Delicate flavors, wonderful sauce to sop up with the bread. Not a whole lot of lobster in the dish.\n\nPotato dumplings with lardon - Incredibly light and fluffy dumplings. The pork adds texture and saltiness. Onion ragout, lingonberry sauce, and brown butter all add supporting flavors. These were really good.\n\nSardine - One large sardine crispy-fried with garlic chips. Salty, garlicky, crispy, and a little fishy goodness. We cleaned this plate, including the crispy bones.\n\nGreen String Farms daily crops - This is their vegetable side, with assorted fresh roasted veggies with a light hollandaise and a runny egg. Delicious.\n\nEntrees:\n\nElk loin - Perfectly cooked, amazingly tender loin. Unfortunately, there was no gaminess here, so it was difficult to distinguish from beef. The sunchoke gratin accompaniment is very tasty.\n\nBlack cod - This was a special, and it was my favorite dish of the night. Crispy skin, tender buttery flesh. Outstanding.\n\nPork belly - Melt-in-your-mouth tender, this is fatty and salty and everything you want from pork belly. The Swedish mash is interesting, if not amazing. I wish there were more brussel sprouts than the sprinkling of leaves that came with it.\n\nSwedish meatballs - How could I not order Swedish meatballs at a Scandinavian restaurant? These were good, but honestly they paled in comparison to much of the rest of the menu, if only because other items were more distinctive and interesting. The potato puree, jus, and pickled cucumbers worked very well with the meat.\n\nDesserts:\n\nPrincess cake - White cake layered with raspberry jam, cream, and a marzipan topping. Served in a jar, which is the only reason I didn't lick the plate. Really really good.\n\nChocolate kladdkaka - Dense chocolate cake (practically a brownie) served with homemade hazelnut ice cream. Very rich. If you love chocolate you definitely want to order this.\n\nSaffron donuts - Meh. Too dense for a satisfying donut, and not enough flavor, so it just tasted doughy to me. The only thing we had that I definitely wouldn't order again.\n--\n\nService was impeccable throughout the night.

Past the bar, the dining area is more formal. Overall, the place is smallish, but well-laid out and designed. I could easily see myself coming in and relaxing at the bar for a good hour or two drinking house-made aquavite and snack a dish or two regularly - if I lived just a little bit closer, and had the budget. \n\nFish, fish, fish. We ordered the whitefish and gravlax, and I wish we ordered more fish dishes. I think the reason being, as Aarash Z mentioned, is that we discovered  Plaj a few months ago while at Nobuo, a Japanese-place in Phoenix that has an impressive command on fish, and one of the chef at Plaj was recuited away from Nobuo. Anyways.... The whitefish is a MUST-HAVE. You've never seen anythign like it  before. I want to go back to get the herring and smoked salmon, especially that herring. I like oily fish (saba, anyone?) and think that this is probably THE place to have herring for the first time.\n\nThe beef cheeks didn't 'wow' me like I thought they would. No doubt they were soft and tender, beautifully presented with crispy onion strings, beet puree, and shaved horseradish, but I've had softer and more flavorful - ew! I feel like such a snob to say that - in a tagine-styled dish. The charcuterie was good, and I couldn't get enough of the rye bread and mustard that was served with it... This is amazing considering I've never liked rye bread in my life. \n\nAnd the desserts. Leave room for dessert. The flourless chocolate cake, a farily standard offering, was served with an orange creme anglaise and crispy meringue toppings. A very nice twist on a classic.  \n\nTucked away behind the opera house, this place is ideal before or after a show, but worth a visit even without going to opera/symphony/ballet. Oh, if you go after a matinee showtime, expect the symphony, opera, ballet type of crowd eating dinner at 5pm :) Hopefully on my next visit, with or without the opera or ballet, I can cozy up on the couch with some whitefish and herring ;)", "author": "Leona Z."}

After breaking down the menu, we ended up with:\n\n-White asparagus, morels, fennel confit, egg 63\u00b0C, hollandaise sauce, fried sour dough\n\n-Potato dumpling kumla, onion ragout, lingonberry, brown butter, lardon \n\n-Krondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili\n\n-Cured Norwegian salmon belly gravlax, spicy grain mustard, dill puree, lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche\n\n-Swedish meat balls, potato puree, pan gravy, lingon berry, pickled cucumber\n\n-Charcuteri: fennalar-salted lamb, syltrulle-cured pork belly, wild boar salami, prinskorv- pork sausage spicy gooseberry jam, grilled rye \n\n-Porter braised ox cheek, roasted beet root, fried onions, horseradis\n\n-Rhubarb lavender crumble pie, strawberry ice cream\n\n-Cloudberry sorbet\n\nthis may sound like a huge spread but the plates are moderately sized. It's not the huge excess of what I understand traditional Danish dinner to be. The chefs touches are more Swedish but they do try and touch on Denmark and Norway in the process. The cocktails and alcohol also touch on those areas.\n\nEverything was fairly delicious and there are certainly some things I wanted more of. Service was very friendly, though there were some lulls from the kitchen even though there were just a handful of people eating that hour. I think if they work on their timing this place will be a great pre show/opera/ballet/you name the Civic Center event place to go eat before or after.", "author": "Kim N."}

The place is tucked along a quiet street and as you enter you need to walk past the lobby to the back of the hotel to find the restaurant. Only issue was the restaurant was very warm while the lobby of the hotel was perfectly cool and comfortable.\n\nThe server explained the menu very well to us and we ordered 6 smaller and 3 larger plates to share. We had to request some bread/butter since we say so many comments and pics on Yelp about it; however we were told they're were still baking it and we'd get it when it was done cooking. Got excited to get some fresh, out-of-the-oven bread! Our server then came back to tell us they don't have the gnocchi anymore so we got something else. Our food arrived, but they gave us 5 of our smaller plates all at once! I was more use to having restaurants get the food out to me in a better progression so that dishes don't get cold. Oh well. The bread finally arrived wrapped in a bag however it was barely lukewarm. The burrata salad and lobster dish were my favorites. Kept using bread to wipe up all the sauce from the lobster dish. The potato dumpling was also quite flavorful.\n\nThey took away our plates when we were done and I guess here's where the rest of the night went completely downhill. Our server told us she'd be on a break and that another server would be taking care of us. Time passed and no other food came to us. After nearly 30 min without getting our rest of our meal, another server asked us if we were ready for dessert. Now I knew something went wrong. We told her we didn't even get our entrees yet. I have a feeling our entrees were forgotten. After another long wait, the rest of our meal arrived. \n\nThe meatballs were a little bland for me. Halibut ok. Squad...here's the final straw. I bit into it but found it extremely hard to bite off the meat. I looked at it and it appeared red and still a bit raw. I told my server but instead of an apology, she told me that it's served medium rare and that's normal. Firstly, she never told us earlier it's served medium rare; however I like my meats medium rare and this definitely was not! You couldn't even tear the meat off the bone! I didn't appreciate how the server didn't accept my opinion about the doneness of the meat and just brushed my opinion aside. Usually, restaurants would just apologize and redo it. Anyways, she finally offered to redo it but by then I didn't feel like waiting another 30 min in this hot dining room for a replacement dish. She later came back and offered to take it off the menu.\n\nFor dessert we got the princess cake and crispy waffles. We were thinking of trying the Northern Lights but then the server came back and told us they don't have that as well tonight. Don't ever get the crispy waffles because it should be better described as crispy slightly burnt waffle cookie. The waffles were not hot and was like biting into an actual hard cookie. I didn't want to tell the server because I thought she might say that the menu said it's supposed to be a crispy waffle (which it technically was) and that the menu description never said it would be hot. \n\nIn the end, I expected the meal to be a bit more expensive, but the dishes are hit and miss (but more misses), and the service was atrocious. Basically it took 3 hrs for our two course meal and then dessert. Unfortunately, that evening's dining experience didn't do enough for me to warrant a return trip.", "author": "Rick T."}

DELICIOUS!\n\nAs many other Yelpers had commented, my level of Scandinavian food was on the same page of pickled herring from a jar or IKEA.  SO, my husband and I were quite excited to give this place a go and we definitely had a great night!\n\nGreat food, great service, great experience.  So let's get into the delightful eats...\n\nDrinks:\n-Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Bols Genevere Danish Gin, elderflower liqueur, egg white, Angostura bitters- Such a great name, but not an impressive drink.  Very boozy, but a little too busy for my taste.  :(\n-Pl\u00e4j Thyme: Bols Genevere Danish Gin, blueberries, thyme, lavender- LOVE the name, LOVE the drink, LOVE it.  I could probably knock back 5 of these guys if you let me... \n-Lingon berry Soda- tasty tasty tasty\n\nAppetizers:\n-Beet root and Jerusalem artichoke, black summer truffle, watercress, hazelnuts, v\u00e4sterbotten cheese- Delicious warm salad with great texture from the hazelnuts.  Tasty!\n-Taste of Herring: saffron tomato, coriander chili, lime, ginger smoked soy- Herring is a bit of a fishy fish, but these were great!  Two pieces per type, so great for two!  My least favorite was probably the ginger smoked soy- still edible, but a bit too fishy for my palate.  \n-Charcuteri: fennalar-salted lamb, syltrulle-cured pork belly, wild boar salami, prinskorv- pork sausage spicy gooseberry jam, grilled rye- Dear lord, who knew Scandinavian cured meats were so AMAZEBALLS.  Absolutely wonderful and such a great variety... from salted lamb, fatty pork belly that melted in your mouth... lovely!\n\nMains:\n-Porter braised ox cheek, roasted beet root, fried onions, horseradish- So succulent and just falls apart.  Love it!\n-Swedish meat balls, potato puree, pan gravy, lingon berry, pickled cucumber- Pretty standard.  It was a tasty dish, but I definitely would try something else the next time I'm back.\n\nDessert:\n-Cardamom spoon cr\u00e8me brulee, lime-mint marinated strawberries- DELISH!  Great way to end dinner, but definitely note it's a small dessert.\n\nMaybe we at a lot more than your average, because I thought I was going to pop out of my dress.... but we thought the portions were perfect!  I definitely think one appetizer and one main is PLENTY leaving you room for dessert.\n\nGo!  Try something new!  Order a bunch of things and just enjoy!", "author": "Christine K."}

I ordered the Caraway smoked salmon which absolutely blew my mind. I loved how the lemon crema was rich and complimented the softness of the salmon and vegetables, that were cooked to perfection. I did not want the dish to end, which is a true testament to how amazing it was. The restaurant is surprisingly located on the first floor of a hotel. I was unaware of this prior to arrival but it did make for a calm and friendly ambience as you entered. Luckily there are few Scandinavian restaurants in the city, as I believe this one would give all of those a run for their money. Towards the end of our dinner the service was a little lacking probably because it progressively got closer to closing time, but other than that, I give high marks to this place..

As was the Krondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado. Tom's service was so spot on we just let him choose and course the rest of the meal and all of his recommendations were amazing: We shared the chicken as a second course, then afterwards shared the halibut dish and also the potato dumplings with lingonberry (Yes, we stuffed ourselves). \n\nThe dining room is quite comfortable (there's even a few comfy chairs in front of a fireplace where you can sit and have drinks) and the service was perfectly timed.

Ok, so admittedly, my other experiences with said cuisine involved IKEA meatballs and Icelandic airport food but STILL. Plaj's food, atmosphere, and staff are exceptional, one of those dining experiences that just leaves me glowing from head to toe (and not just from too many cocktails).\n\nWe'll start with the little things like the rye bread with fennel butter that just keeps refilling itself. The servers are indeed well practiced in the art of stealthily dropping unending packets of fresh bread on the table, to the point where you've eaten 8 slices before you realize something is wrong (and by wrong, i mean so so right). But you will soon praise the gods for these unlimited quantities of bread for they are the perfect vehicle for mopping up every last bit of delicious sauce and gravy from the other dishes. And this is not optional. The servers will pretty much refuse to collect your plate until you have soaked up each and every last delicious drop. \n\nOh my gosh, where do I even begin with the food? The LOBSTER, holy buttery smokes, the lobster was divine. As were the Swedish meatballs and ox cheek. The star of the night for me was the smoked salmon, SO tear inducingly tender and flaky and flavorful. Again, all of the dishes come with a pool of sauce or gravy that are all variations of liquid heaven. There may have been plate licking but there was absolutely no shame. Other highlights included the white asparagus with morel mushrooms and the DESSERTS: cardamom creme brulee (holy amazeballs) and chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet (i died).\n\nAnd of course, the cocktails. Strong, creative, and highly recommended. Especially The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nThe place is cozy, intimate, with soft lighting and even softer couches.

We have been in the San Francisco Bay area, Stockholm/Sweden, Phuket/Thailand, Austin/Texas, Santa Cruz, Los Gatos and San Francisco. We will remember the dinner at Pl\u00e4j as the best anniversary dinner yet! \n\nWe started our meal with some fun drinks. Bill enjoyed the Fjallbacka Cocktail with: Linie aquavit, Kanon Vodka, lime, chili and Sprite. Helena enjoed a Tulip Cocktail but changed it to include Elderberry Liquer insted of Lingonberry taste. The next time, I will definately stick with the Cocktail menu instead of changing it to my own taste. \n\nWe started with 2 dishes, the White Asparagus & Lobster Skagen. The White Asparagus dish was a clear winner. \n- White asparagus, lobster mushrooms, fennel confit, egg 65\u00b0C, hollandaise sauce, soft rye croutons \n- Krondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili\n\nThen we shared the Coriander crusted tuna dish with licorice ponzu, parsnip chips, ginger jam, horseradish. This was an amazing dish that neither one of us will ever forget. Beautifully presented, amazing flavors, and just the right doneness of the increadibly tasty tuna. Better than any Sashimi or Tuna Tar Tar dish I have ever tasted. \n\nWe both had Saddle of venison, Scandinavian gratin, Juniper berry jus as a main dish. I am not a big meat fan, but this Venison melted in my mouth like nothing I have ever had before. Again the amazing flavors and the perfect doneness of the meat was impecable. \n\nWith the Venison Helena enjoyed a glass of Freakshow Cabernet from Lodi. This is a wine I am going to try to find and buy on my own. Great flavorful Cabarnet and a very fun winebottle to spark conversation around the dinner table!\n\nChef Roberth Sundell came by our table and wished us a Happy Anniversary. A very nice, gentle, calm guy who looks way too young to create such increadibly great dishes!\n\nThe very Swedish after dinner Punsch was enjoyed by both Bill and I!\n\nWhen we thought we couldn't have anything else, we managed to enjoy a Swedish spiced apple pie with house made vanilla Ice cream.

I am basically a huge fan of Scandinavia (Denmark in particular), so that when I saw that there was a Scandinavian restaurant I just had to try it for my birthday. It was that special of an occasion. Now I know Scandinavian food is known for being very bland so I had my expectation set so... and thus I was very happy with my experience with Plaj!\n\nWe got beers which were pretty good beers. They were good beers but I don't know if its because they were from Denmark, or if they were just nicely made. I had a porter so that was already something I like. They can't really mess that up. \n\nFor our food, we got the butternut squash soup, gnocchi, some sort of salmon/cod (?) fritters, and the elk! Everything but the gnocchi was good. I didn't like the gnocchi.. it wasn't very chewy and it was kinda floury..? or..something was off with the consistency. \n\nThe soup was really good!! It had pear in it for that extra crunch which contrasted with the soup itself. The soup was really oily though..which was weird. The oil seperated from the soup and I do not appreciate drinking straight up oil. \n\nThe fish fritter was pretty good..but what do you expect from deep fried fish balls? Of course they're gonna taste good!!\n\nAnd lastly..the elk.. taste like a rare or a medium rare steak but with less fat. I liked the mushrooms that came with it and all that weird extra sauce. It was literally like I was eating in a forest and I foraged for my food. I appreciate the presentation.\n\nPlaj wasn't some place that I would go crazy for or crave really. But I really do appreciate that they were somehow able to make a cuisine known for it's blandness and make it into something enjoyable to eat and to look at!

I just wish there was more of it! From the Beta section, the Swedish meatballs (of course). It was also good. I think 4 items to share is perfect for 2 people. Oh, we also had dessert drink and chocolate cake topped with ice cream.\n\nI think my 3 star rating is due to the ordinary feel of the food.

I confused him by tell him we would be celebrating his heritage (1/4 Norwegian, yeah!) by trying some food we'd never had before.\n\nBeing so close to the Opera house, many of the patrons were dining before a show.  When we arrived for a 7:30pm reservation (on a Saturday) the place was packed, but it quickly emptied out as people left for their shows.  The dining room was HOT, though - as you enter the hotel the lobby and hallway are nice and cool, but the dining room was sweltering.  I counted 6 fans on in there - maybe there was a maintenance issue.\n\nThe menu is divided into the daily specials, from the garden, from the sea, and from the pasture (I won't embarrass myself here by trying to remember the Norwegian/Swedish names).  There are both small plates meant to be appetizers and larger plates meant to be the main course - our waitress explained this to us but you can also tell by the prices, generally.\n\nWe went through the menu and picked out some dishes that caught our eye - we ended up with a starter and a main dish each, plus a cheese plate and dessert.  I had the dungeness crab salad (daily special) and the pork belly.  I found a small shard of shell and bone in each of my dishes - not a big deal for me, but it definitely keeps me from giving them five stars.\n\nThe dungeness crab salad was very fresh and delicious.  It came with a cucumber sorbet which was delightfully refreshing.  For the main dish, I got an enormous slab of pork belly.  Seriously, this thing was huge.  And tender, and fatty, and a little salty....wonderful.  Then came two desserts because we're crazy like that - the cheese plate (with four cheese, fruit, bread, two jams, and crackers) and the waffle.  Both were delicious but I'm partial to having cheese for dessert.\n\nThe service was a bit slow to start, as everybody was running around making sure that the theater customers made it to their shows on time.

My fave was the lobster dish. The broth served with lobster was savory and delicious. I used up all the remaining bread on the table to sop up all the sauce.\n\nMy entree was the ox cheek.  It was a soft piece of meat in a rich sauce.    Not a large dish, but satisfying to the taste. I'd say, if you have a larger appetite, to go with the beef tenderloin dish.   Tasting my friends, it was also tender and juicy.  \n\nEveryone in my party enjoyed the dishes that we had. The cocktails that they offer were also tasty and unique.    I enjoyed my Plaj Thyme.

The reason why I mention this is because she had her personal qualms coming to this restaurant because: A)Her old favorite place was under new ownership and B)We have never ever ever tried Scandanavian food before. My mom only eats what I lovingly call \"Pilgrim food\" (white food from the traditional all American cuisine). The waitress said they had only been open three days, so I was excited and scared for both myself and my mother.\n\n But after entering this brand new establishment,\n\nWe. Loved. IT!\n\nThe place looks mostly the same, except brighter fall-like colors in mahogany, orange, brown and amber. The difference for me was that the staff seemed younger, vibrant, and happy to talk to us about the food.\n\nOur waiter and host recommended the best food to be served my mother's traditional Irish/Italian/Midwestern palate and also for the more adventurous foodie, that being me. :D\n\nEach plate is told to be small so that you can try a number of different items on the menu. But what it may have lacked in size, it was LOADED with flavor and substance and I was definitely full after our meal.\n\nWe had:\n*Rye bread served in a traditional paper bag with delicious cardamom butter.\n\n*A Tulip cocktail which was a sparkly delight in my mouth due to its refreshing sparkling wine and lingonberry concentrate mixture topped with a lemon finish due to the bitters and lemon peel. \n\n*Warmed Beetroot and Jerusalem artichoke salad with crunchy hazelnuts and scandanvian cheese, and crisp watercress (suited us both as a fancy beet salad, which we both share a constant love for).  \n\nA play on a traditional tomato salad with burrata cheese (o.m.G!), organic greens, heirloom tomatos, herbs, and a DELCIOUS aquavit vinaigrette. I wanted to wipe the plate's dressing with my bread after. \n\n*My mom had the Beef tenderloin with a sunchoke puree, Danish blue (cheese?), and tarragon jus. The beef was tender and chewy and I freaking love sunchokes, so A+\n\n*Porter-braised Oxtail cheeks with fried onion, beet-root puree, and horseradish. I decided to be adventurous and try this since I've never had any form of cheek, but to me, it reminded me of an Osso bucco dish (veal) that I usually eat at my old place of employment, Il Fornaio, but WAY better. The porter braise created a juicy and sweet texture where the meat just fell apart and melted into your tongue. Love beets and its sweet puree went well with the sweetness of the meat. \n\nDesserts: Let me preface this by saying I am not a dessert person. I mean, I'm normal in that I like the occasional vanilla ice cream, but usually I need my dessert to confuse me from tasting sweetness by providing me with a salty or spicy infused bite. The dessert we had made me forgot all about my distaste for loaded sugary sweets and truly helped finish off our meal. \n\nMy mom had the Rhubarb crumble pie (which befits my savory tongue since rhubarb is like a combination of tomato and straweberry) and really fresh tasting strawberry ice cream.\n\nAnd finally,  the best dessert of all: Cardamom creme brulee with lime-marinated strawberries. I was delighted to make that little crack of the buttery crunchy shell with my spoon before digging into an almost vanilla like-spice bowl of cremey goodness. My mom and I meant to share every dish, but I almost shook with the issue of abandonment over having divulge any more of it to her.  \n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience.

I also really got a kick out of the chocolate torte with orange-vanilla cream, cloudberry sorbet, and crumbles of meringue.  It was also a series of varied textures balance by bright, clean flavors.

The Scandanevian influence was intriguing after being immersed with a flurry of steakhouse and southern food over the past few months. Anyway, I read a few articles about this place and was interested in the photos / reviews here on Yelp- thanks you guys- so we gave it a go. I think my boyfriend was pleased with the variety of dining selections I made from just a bit of online research.\n\nOur server explained the four sections of the menu- dagen (specials), hagen (vegetables), fjord (seafood) and beta (grazing). She told us that plates were meant to share, but informed us of the items that were considered \"entrees.\" The menu changes daily, but we ordered a lobster/caviar appetizer as well as an amazing asparagus dish- both were divine. I was sad that they were out of the ever-popular Swedish meatballs, but I steered away from my usual seafood preference and ordered the squab. It was cooked medium-rare and definitely interesting- the portions were on the small side small but delivered to me, squab foot atop and all, with an amazing potato. The foot made me nervous so I put that piece aside to eat. :)\n\nWe finished with coffee and the amaaaazing Swedish pancake. Thin and delicious. All in all, Pl\u00e4j  is an absolutely lovely place. Presentation is A+ and there is a beautiful ambiance of interesting art, dim lighting and class. I'll definitely return.", "author": "Kristin F."}

What? A Scandinavian restaurant in SF? Where have I been? How could I not know this? Yes of course we are going to go there for Scandi husband's birthday!\n\nSo how does the food taste judged by a genuine Norwegian? Well, it's more Swedish than Norwegian but close enough to taste like \"home\" to him. We tried the white asparagus and charcuterie starters. The charcuterie was outstanding - really authentic. I'm a big fan of lamb and especially of lamb salami when a friend introduced me to it last time we were in Bergen so you can imagine how excited I was to see it on the menu. Highly recommended unless you don't like lamb. For the main courses we had the halibut and the ox cheeks. Hubby liked the ox cheeks while I thought the halibut was so so. Flavors and textures didn't quite come together. Dessert was rhubarb crumble and chocolate torte. Both were good. Overall the food was okay/adequate/as expected. I just liked the special Scandinavian ingredients that you can't usually find.\n\nMy biggest complaint, and it's a big complaint, is that service was very slow. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Friday evening and arrived and were seated in a timely manner. But by 9 PM we hadn't made it to our main courses yet. I understand it's a Friday and they were full but that's a really long time - like 1.5 hours of just appetizers and drinks. \n\nMy recommendation is that if you really want to try Scandinavian food, and I mean something other than IKEA, then you could eat here. But for me, the service is too slow and the food not outstanding to make me want to come back.", "author": "Jean K."}

The herring was probably the most disappointing of the night- our server introduced it as \"herring three ways\" but really it was three pieces of herring with different sauces. We were divided on what we thought about the fish itself- one of us liked it, the other thought the fish was too dense and not-fresh tasting. The sauces that accompanied the fish were okay, each one a slight bit different but overall nothing to write home about. \n\nThe poached lobster and halibut with chantrelle emulsion, both recommended by our server, were much much better- solid 4-4.5's both of them. The lobster was fresh, sizeable, and beautifully put together. The halibut was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were delicious. \n\nOverall a decent meal.

As you might expect from a Scandanavian place, there was an excellent selection of fish and game meats. We had herring and salmon (poached and pickled) and boar and elk. All flavorful and satisfying. Even the vegetable dishes were spot on, one of my favorite dishes overall was the beet salad with hazelnuts, and gnocci with nettle also delicious and well prepared. For desserts the Swedish pancake was simple and super yummy; the princess cake might have been good, but they didn't take it out of the refrigerator long enough to get to room temp, so it was too cold and hard.\n\nThe space is just one relatively small room, an interesting combo of an old hotel dining room with big wooden pillars, a fire place and a large wooden bar contrasted with contemporary touches like bright orange light fixtures over the fireplace and whimsical flower arrangements.

Started off with cucumber & rye cocktails since they were out of Viking's Spirit. Pretty standard cocktail, not mind blowing.\n\nFirst up were oysters. I freakin' love oysters, but these oysters were lost on me. They were topped off with enormous dollops of horseradish which really drowned out the flavor and intricacies of eating an oyster. They were much better leaving that on the side. I scraped most of mine off.\n\nThen came the cheese plate, which was probably my favorite part of the meal. The Norwegian smoked cheese was to die for... perfectly smoky and melts in your mouth. Comes with assorted domestic cheeses and jams.\n\nMussels were next. Wasn't impressed. I love me some mussels, but the dish was lukewarm at best and barely flavorful.\n\nOur gnocchi and lobster were brought out simultaneously. Gnocchis were... interesting. Instead of being cooked however you usually cook gnocchis, they were lightly fried. This dish was pretty bland without the green sauce that came on the side. The lobster was disappointingly small, and also lukewarm. Lobsters are pretty damn big; why did we only get two small claws for almost 30...? It was swimming in a frothy orange liquid which made it difficult to fish out what small bits of food there were in there.\n\nDessert options were underwhelming and decided to opt out of that.\n\nThe food wasn't terrible, but I could have spent that $160 excluding tip elsewhere for higher satisfaction. If you go, get the cheese plate. I could have done without everything else.", "author": "Paulina D."}

Cause its delicious!!\n\nOne of my favorite dishes here is the Alaskan Halibut.  Theres a lot going on in this dish, but its perfectly balanced.  The sauce is made up of a rich and savory mushroom reduction.  The shaved asparagus adds a nice thin crunch, while the trout roe adds mild, briny bursts of tang, which adds to the flaky and mild halibut.  I seriously dream about this dish.  **Save your rye bread to wipe up any remaining sauce.\n\nMind you, all these dishes are very beautiful and full of color-- my eyes definitely had their feast and as a result, I forgot to take pictures until AFTER I'd already taken a few bites!

No problem - that was my fault.\n\nThe service was attentive and friendly - we particularly enjoyed chatting with the bartender. The restaurant is located inside a hotel, and the dining room looks the part: comfortable, white tablecloths, and pleasant in an inoffensive hotel way. Got the feeling that this is a popular destination for the opera and symphony crowd.\n\nStarters were nice. Ordered the herring plate and cheese plate, as well as the house made lemon horseradish aquavit. The house bread is unique and a nice break from ubiquitous San Francisco sourdough.\n\nThings totally fell apart with the entrees, though. My companion's fish was just under-seasoned and overcooked enough so that she made her way through it without sending it back. The saddle of elk - which had been billed as cooked to medium rare by way of sous vide - was cooked well done entirely through most of the portion. And I mean well done as in all brown. This resulted in a dry, chalky bite. On top of that, there appeared to be zero seasoning on the meat, and the accompanying mushroom, lingonberry, etc. sauce/side also lacked any real flavor. The bartender was kind enough to offer to have the kitchen re-fire another piece of meat, but the complete lack of flavor made me think it wasn't worth it, even if the meat came out cook properly. It's especially disappointing because it was billed as sous vide, which is a fool proof method of cooking meat - so either the temperature was turned up too high, or someone just left it on to sear and forgot about it. \n\nWould I return? Not for dinner. But if I was in the area, I might pop in for some small plates and aquavit at the bar (maybe going for something less aggressive than lemon horseradish aquavit) for a snack or a quick appetizer before dinner somewhere else.", "author": "Robert R."}

I belive reservations are a good choice here but we quickly were seated at the bar, which I actually prefer. Not knowing too much about Scandinavian cuisine, we weren't really sure what to order beside the obvious choices (aka meatballs) but luckily the wonderful bartender Roger gave us some wonderful recommendations.  We decided to do the blood pudding, Swedish meatballs, and gnocchi. \n   The blood pudding was really delicious, especially since I'm not the biggest fan of coagulation-- my husband on the other hand would prefer blood on anything he consumes so there ya go. Kind of mineraly and good texture.  The gnocchi dish was incredibly earthy, consisting of crispy gnocchi in a bed of nettle sauce and braised kale and mushrooms. The meatballs,  however,  were to die for. Or at least come back again and again for. Perfect taste and texture,  a mix of really seasoned beef and pork, served in heavenly sauce with pureed potatoes and lingonberry compote. So so good-- really jogged memories for me of my German grandma's cooking- especially the potatoes.  This dish was like a stick to your ribs delicious tummy hug. \nOkay so dessert here must be mentioned because a) the dessert list here is extensive b) you absolutely must order something or regret it and c) they have Swedish Princess cake on the menu. Helllooooo princess cake!!! It's only my fave cake of all time,  and plaj's princess is outstanding. Beautiful presentation and delicious marzipan.

When Pl\u00e4j was suggested to me, I imagined a heap of pickled herring, Swedish meatballs, and solid social welfare programs. Thanks to Pl\u00e4j, I now have a slightly more nuanced understanding of the cuisine, and am ready to further explore the territory. I'm also closer to correctly pronouncing the name (like \"Play\", apparently).    \n\nI started off with a fantastic Fernet/Aquavit cocktail (\"Norwegian Sunset\") -- subtle and light that went well with the heavy entrees. I'm still not totally sure what aquavit is, but my Finnish dining companion assured me that it was a classy choice. So there. \n\nMeatballs were great -- far more dense and savory than their comparatively-wimpy IKEA cousins. You really need to properly mix all the component ingredients (lingonberry sauce, mashed potatoes) correctly in each bite to get the full experience. \n\nHighlight for me was the tender braised ox cheek and the fantastic beet pur\u00e9e -- I'd love to see beet pur\u00e9e take hold in other cuisines, purple food is way cool.  \n\nAmbiance was so-so. Tables felt squished a little close together, and the lighting was poorly distributed. Totally fine, just not sure I'd recommend it to people looking for a super-romantic spot.", "author": "Ryan D."}

We were seated at a spacious circular table, which facilitated easy \"family style\" plate sharing.\n\nWe started with two salads: the burrata and the ultra greens with Granny Smith apples.  These salads were perhaps the highlight of the whole dinner.  The lettuce was rich in flavor and texture, accompanied with delicious fruits, nuts and cheeses.\n\nThe cheese board was next, beautifully prepared on a wood slab.  There was a wide variety of unique cheeses along with two types of jam and assorted berries.\n\n\nFor our main course, we chose:\n-gnocchi with sausage:  the gnocchi were delectably pillow-soft, with deep spiced whole sausages\n-elk:  NOT too gamey, a complex multilayered flavor of spices and tender elk meat\n-meatballs: absolutely delicious: broke apart with the touch of a fork, with a rich satisfying taste and aroma\n-pork belly:  somehow fatty without being greasy, crispy on the outside and served with a unique Swedish Mash\n\nDessert:\n-princess cake:  served in a cold jar and covered with marzipan- beautiful presentation and delicious till the last spoonful.  Moist and rich with berries and frosting\n-kladdkakka: warm crispy savory chocolate cake with gooey inside, served over ice cream\n\n\nOverall this was a wonderful dining experience.

We finally went last wednesday, and in summary we thought the experience was underwhelming at best, and boring at worst. While waiting for our seat at the bar, I got a cocktail which had a cardamon fig aquavit, and the cardamon flavor was so dominant that I had a hard time finishing it...but I did anyway cause hey, i'm not going to let an expensive cocktail go to waste. That would be an insult to the (likely good) shot of scotch hidden somewhere within.\nAt first glance, the interior and ambiance (decor, lighting, music) seemed very understated and borderline boring. You could be anywhere USA, and my wife pointed out that it reminded her of most hotel restaurants she has been in.  Unfortunately this impression never changed, but sometimes it's refreshing to be in a place which isn't trying to be something it's not.  \nWe loved the fresh baked bread (2 small pieces) they brought out immediately, which had a lovely toasted fennel aroma. Each additional request for this bread costs $3. Our starter was the classic herring, and this was super delicious and interesting, quite possibly the most memorable dish of the night. It was beautifully presented, surprisingly colorful, with each bite providing a novel combination of flavors. Once you realize which ones are harmonious together, it gets even better.\nNext came our potato dumplings (2 about the size of golf balls), which had a decent flavor and texture, but were sitting in such a heavy pool of oil that it was off-putting. \nWe then got the meatballs on mashed potatoes, which were good but basic, though there was an essence of nutmeg (?) i believe that was quite nice. My wife said they just tasted like other meatballs.\nThen came our braised Ox cheek, which was surprisingly large considering the small portions thus far. It was delicately tender, flaky, and moist but to me tasted like a standard pot roast. Nothing too memorable except for the contrast offered by the freshly grated horseradish on top. That was a good combination.\n\nIn short, the food was stable, well-prepared and humble, which unfortunately can translate into boring when you're in a city like SF, especially when you leave paying $190 all in. It's worth a try for sure, though if you are expecting a good Scandinavian cultural experience, you may leave teased.", "author": "Carlisle H."}

We were one of only four other tables which seems unusual for a supposed busy Saturday night in the city - but not for this place. In hindsight, that should have been a telltale sign. It was 15 minutes before the water came, which is unacceptable. Our server seemed resentful of questions about the menu, giving us clipped one-word answers which left us feeling oddly guilty for having asked about things like the exciting and exotic herring flavors, in the first place. She was uninformative and seemed eager to leave the table as though she had something better to do than wait on us. The good news is that our appetizers - brown bread & fennel butter, Aquavit herring, saffron herring and mustard and dill herring were delicious. Likewise the entrees - ox cheek, smoked salmon - were exquisite and throughly enjoyable. Also the bartender took time to take care of us which was greatly appreciated.

And the $$$ pricing elevates expectations to a level that the service, decor, nor food could match.\n\nThe food and drinks were hit-and-miss. Some things were quite tasty (e.g. mushroom sauce, cabbage soup, and pork belly). Some things were drenched in brown butter (potato dumplings, fish of the day) or overly salty (beet salad).\n\nActually, about the only thing that's truly authentic is the prices. 40-50 USD per person works out to be 250-325 SEK, which is about the price you'd expect to pay for a fancy dinner and drink in Stockholm.\n\nBut you're not in Stockholm, are you?", "author": "John C."}

Other than the fact that you will be paying entree prices for appetizer portions, this is a near flawless restaurant. Everything that was brought out to us was presented beautifully and, more importantly, was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe menu is broken down into four section: specials, vegetables, meats and seafood. The Smoked halibut & salmon fritters as well as the Swedish meatballs really stood out and I would recommend ordering them if they are on the menu.\n\nThe location makes this a great place to come before the opera, ballet or SF Jazz.

This place has one of those. \n\nThe first time my girlfriend and I went to Plaj, I really loved it...but, I had also gotten really drunk though-out my meal and history has proven that I'm not always rational when it comes to food and I'm drunk. (flashback to a LOT of 2am Taco Bell moments in my early 20's) We decided to go again and, \"BLAMO\", I was right! This place did not disappoint.\n\nPros: \n\n* Herring dish - Awesome\n* Wait staff - Super attentive and willing to educate you on the dish choices\n* Fritters dish - So amazing it grew hair on my chest\n* Clean\n* Great place for a date\n\nCons:\n\n* The only con I'd say about this place it that there is some seating up near the front that is on a couch. Being a man built more to win a limbo contest then a 1-on-1 game, I found the couch was an uncomfortable arrangement that didn't allow for a natural seating height for dinner. I ended up having to put a pillow under my butt to get to a comfortable height. (felt a little bit like I was in a booster seat and was a little humiliating) \n\n\nA pleasant surprise:\n\nHalfway through our starter, the owner came buy and asked if we would mind if they moved our seats over to make room for a larger group. These type of things are not a big deal for us and we said \"of course\". The manager/owner decided to thank us by buying our first round of drinks. That was unnecessary but a very nice touch.\n\nOverall:\n\nSo although the seating situation was embarrassing, the food and the staff at this place far exceeds a little embarrassment. I'd definitely go back but request a different seat this time.", "author": "Robert B."}

Bartender said it might be too heavy, but it was also pretty small for $18. Overall, this was the only decent place walkable to the theater. But wouldn't go back again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-29", "description": "In a district where mere proximity to the War Memorial Opera House guarantees longevity and business, Plaj produces outstanding food and cocktails worthy of any district of our fair city at extraordinarily reasonable prices.\n\nI (and a few associates) ordered:\n\nThe Plajer Cocktail: A superbly executed take on the Old Fashioned, with hints of cinnamon spice, a strawberry finish, and notes of toffee, vanilla and butterscotch. All of the flavors were well-integrated, and it provided an excellent aperitif. It also came with the largest ice cube I've ever seen in my entire life, which amused me to no end. \n\nWhite Asparagus Appetizer: While the appetizer was well portioned, beautifully plated, and texturally outstanding (I especially enjoyed the 65 Centigrade Egg, although, admittedly, I did not test the temperature), the bechamel sauce could have used a hint more citrus to truly produce a dish that functioned as a unified whole. The rye croutons were especially noteworthy, providing a much needed textural contrast along with a salty backbone that complimented the delicate flavor of the asparagus well.\n\nPotato Dumplings: Probably the highlight of the meal, the potato dumplings had a superbly springy mouthfeel, and were complimented exceptionally well by the Lingonberry and Brown Butter sauce they came with. The textual and flavor contrast that the perfectly cooked lardons and onions provided added a much-appreciated rich aftertaste. This was the sort of dish I had to restrain myself from chain-biting.\n\nTaste of Herring: I felt that the subtlety of the flavors that the chef was trying to accomplish were drowned out by the naturally strong flavor of the herring. While the garnishes were greatly appreciated (especially the wonderful vegetables), I fear that this course fell short of my expectations.\n\nSwedish Meatballs: Having nothing to compare to but the travesties provided by IKEA and the occasional luncheon I find myself compelled to attend, I found them delightful; obscenely tender, and deeply flavorful. While the sweetness of the gravy was at times overpowering, it worked exceptionally well with the potato puree and the salty crunch of the accompanying pickles. \n\nCharcuterie: The Lamb Belly, Lamb Leg and Duck were all superb, and contrasted well with the toasted garlic rye, and Lingonberry Jam provided. The wild boar sausage, was a bit too salty, and as a result didn't allow the flavor of the meat to shine through. I could have done without the grainy mustard, which detracted from the natural flavors of the meat and jam.\n\nService was generally good, although it took a bit longer to bring our check out then I would have otherwise liked. Our waitress was exceptionally friendly, and took good care of us, compulsively filling our water, and breaking a tie with good humor when our party had come to an impasse on what entrees we should order. Ambiance was likewise pleasant, in a vaguely modern European fashion, with dim lighting that made the windowless room in the basement of the Inn at the Opera far more pleasant then expected.\n\nCorkage was 20$, and the wine and beer selections are extraordinarily well-curated and provide a plethora of appropriate pairing options, although the selection could be described as limited compared to many other restaurants at this price point.\n\nOverall: A fine dining experience slightly marred by minor flaws. Certainly worth a stop, and perhaps the best value in the Civic Center area. 4.5 Stars.", "author": "Casey U."}

For starters, it is a very old school, beautiful and elegant dark wood low lighting restaurant.  While I went semi dressed up, my eating companion went in jeans and a casual top and I would suggest dressing slightly nicer than the SF norm (though we were both comfortable there- it still is SF).  \n\nWe ordered quite a bit: Beef tenderloin, lobster, gnocchi, Swedish meatballs, and the burrata.  Overall, this was one of the best meals I have had in SF in a very long time and the price/value for the experience is quite good.  The beef tenderloin is a \"newish\" addition to the menu for them and it was spectacular.  It came on top of a cheese pie type thing, and with the mushrooms it was outstanding.  The next best dish was the lobster.  It had lobster bisque foam on top with caviar and frankly was delicate and divine.  The other dishes were quite good as well (note to others not familiar with Scandi food: Swedish meatballs typically come with mashed potatoes NOT noodles.  Noodles are served for kids in the region...and apparently with Stouffer's frozen special;-)\n\nService was impeccable.  Note to self: do NOT go on a hot night.  It doesn't have A/C, there is no air flow as it's in the back of the hotel with no windows, but frankly, how often in SF do we have to \"deal\" with that!\n\nI will be back with a group.", "author": "Deal G."}

The food is relatively modern and light, and the portions are not as small as one would think, given the warnings.\n\nPotato dumplings, while unique, were probably the least memorable dish and also a little too heavy on the brown butter component.  White Asparagus with 63C egg - five spears of white asparagus went wonderfully whit the fennel confit, though the egg was slightly less cooked than the advertised 63C.  Taste of Herring - again excellent, with three creative and distinct marinades, though it would have been nice to leave one of the preparations traditional.  Lobster with Caviar - excellent for the price.  Meat Balls - slightly too spiced for my taste, but well done with sweet lingon berry and a nice gravy; perhaps a bit too much mashed potato.  For dessert, the chocolate torte - did not get much flavor from the cloudberry sorbet, but again well executed.\n\nNear the end of the meal, the chef came out and shared a taste of Swedish rum punch - a unique and sweet aperitif.

Just a heads up both to Pl\u00e4j (Keep your prices consistent!!!) and to future patrons (don't be alarmed if you end up paying a little more).  To be fair, the dish is probably worth $20, but still...\n\n--------------\nMy girlfriend and I decided to try out Pl\u00e4j kinda spur of the moment, and we're glad that its newness meant no wait times and an easy to snag reservation (seriously, just to be safe we made a reservation for 10:15pm at 9:30pm, showed up early, and were seated promptly).\n\nWhat we had:\nKrondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili\nSwedish meat balls, potato puree, pan gravy, lingon berry, pickled cucumber\nRhubarb lavender crumble pie, strawberry ice cream\nVoss sparkling water (totally not worth it, our waitress kinda snuck this in, and at $9 it's a HUGE ripoff. water is water).\n\nAnyways, the food was great! The Swedish meatballs were decently sized, the flavors were solid and distinct, and they weren't overly fatty or greasy.  The rest of that dish was fairly simple and to the point.  The pickled cucumbers weren't too tart, more on the sweater side of pickles, and the potato puree was nice and thick and not overly buttery.\n\nThe Lobster dish was phenomenal! Savory broth, soft & succulent lobster bits, and the caviar, avocado and horseradish played nicely off each other.  The plate was somewhat small, but Pl\u00e4j is more tapas-style and less large-entree style.  \n\nThe dessert was delicious and perfectly balanced.  Whatever the cream sauce was, it really brought the whole plate together.  The crumble was nice and firm.  Very excited to try the other desserts next time - they all looked good!\n\nThe -1 star was mostly for the lack of originality in ambiance - wasn't bad, just didn't seem terribly original, especially for being billed as 'SFs first Scandinavian Restaurant'.  Seems like they missed out on a cool opportunity to dress the place up a bit.\n\nAlso, our waitress kinda snuck in the Voss without mentioning that it came at $9 a bottle.  That is something that should definitely be mentioned, as that's more than our dessert cost and nearly half as much as the Lobster + Caviar plate.  \n\nAll in all, I think we'll most definitely be coming back, especially with it's close proximity to the Opera & Symphony, I can see us stopping by for a meal before/after a show.", "author": "Albert T."}

The restaurant has only been open for four months, but I didn't notice any kinks.\n\nCame here for a pre-opera dinner last night and I was extremely impressed. Atmosphere is warm, but not stuffy. My friend and I shared the Taste of Herring trio (which was lovely) and the poached lobster Skagen (mmm, caviar) to start, followed by the saddle of venison (which came with the most delicious juniper berry jus and gratin potatoes, heaven!) and Swedish meatballs (so much better than Ikea's--and I like Ikea Swedish meatballs, don't get me wrong). For dessert, we shared the Swedish apple pie. The highlights of the meal were definitely the venison (cooked so perfectly) and the Swedish meatballs (they just tasted so homey and autumn-y, awesome!).\n\nTo top it off, the service is top-notch--really, maybe its because I haven't been eating out as much lately, or my cocktail was stronger that I thought, but the service was fantastic--friendly, unpretentious and informative. There was a real sense that the service staff takes pride in their restaurant. \n\nGiven the dearth of Scandinavian cuisine in the city, the great food, and the amazing service, I think this place is going to do very very well.", "author": "Nora G."}

We came on a Monday and there were only a handful of tables full. There wasn't  one assigned host at the host station but the service was decent with some kinks still being worked out.  \n\nThe French Spouse and I have only eaten Scandinavian food in Finland, Denmark and Sweden and never had it in the states so we were excited to see how much it hewed to tradition. It was nice mix of traditional ingredients with modern technique.\n\nThe menu is divided up into four sections, hagen, smaller plates of greens and veggies, fjord: seafood; some smaller plates, some larger, beta:meat in mostly larger entree portions and finally Godis: desserts.\n\nWe order one dish of each category. As is common the smaller dishes were the more creative and interesting while the larger dishes especially the meats which stay true to the Swedish inspiration while be very approachable and familiar to American palates and the opera crowd scene.\n\nWe had the\n1. Potato dumpling kumla, onion ragout, lingonberry, brown butter which we got without the lardon (12) This was one of the best dishes we had in a meal that overall very good. The dumpling were crisp but nice and smooth on the inside and the onion ragout & lingonberry & brown butter was the perfect savory complement to dumplings. This dish was smaller with two large dumplings but very filling.\n\n2. Krondil poached lobster skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili (18) This dish was so delicate in the best possible way, there were many component but nothing overwhelmed the perfectly poached lobster. It was a good portion too. There was a nice horseradish cream that complimented the lobster rather than overpowering it.\n\n3. Porter braised ox cheeks, roasted beet root, fried onions, horseradish (22) This had all the flavours of a country side farm favorite but was rather bland. The cheeks were tender and cooked beautifully but didn't have much taste of the porter. The roast beet root which was super light and fluffy was the true star of the dish. The fried onions were nice but there was too many on the dish and the real shaved horseradish was great.  It was the least interesting dish and I would still recommend it.\n\n4.the halibut, chanterelle emulsion, shaved asparagus, trout roe (21) The fish was beautiful and it was complex and really well composed dish with bursting flavours and a sauce that was sopped up with the in house made rye bread.\n\n5. For dessert we had the chocolate tarte with cloudberry sorbet, meringue, blood orange sauce (8). I've never seen cloudberries in North American except in northern Canada but I've heard they are also grow in a few northern states. Either way it was really nice to see what is a common wild berry in a dessert here and it was nicely paired with the chocolate torte. Neither the sorbet nor the torte were overly sweet and the meringue added a nice crunch and texture to the dish.\n\nI really liked how the chef has married traditional Swedish food and dishes with the abundance of local produce and seafood. Although they said most dishes are for sharing I found four dishes to be very filling and don't think we could have eaten more. I would have preferred some smaller dishes at lower price point as the lowest price was 12 dollars.\n\nFor drinker there is a selection of cocktails, three kinds of Aquavit which is must if you are drinker and eating Swedish food, beers,both draft and bottle. There was a small selection of wines as well as dessert liqueurs. There is also a good selection of non-alcoholic beverages including elderflower soda and lingonberry soda both as well more American sodas.\n\nThe staff was friendly and knowledgeable, our server explained that many of dishes were meant to be shared and pointed out which ones were larger and smaller. She was able to answer most of our food questions and they were able to remove elements from some of the dishes on request. They also don't add on a healthy SF charge on which is so incredibly tacky of a restaurant owner to do. \n\nI liked the decor more than the French Spouse who is more of a hipster and likes the current trends of wood on the wall and faux vintage in restaurants more. It looks like they kept much of the old decor with the dark wood paneling and just changed the furniture to a mix of swedish country house and modern bright metal elements. The lighting was good and we could see each other and the menu well. The music was downtempo electronica which was kept at a low volume and hearing each other was easy.\n\nParking on the street was very easy but it gets much harder when there are events going on. There is a paid parking lot across from the restaurant.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

WooHoo!  A new restaurant and a new cuisine.  Based on the first review on yelp, it sounded promising.\n\nFor drinks, I ordered the Mikkeller Monk's Brew Elixir.  Once again, something new!  I enjoy an amber or dark ale and this one did not disappoint.  There was a hint of sweetness at the end that surprised me in a good way.  My friend had the Kanon Organic Vodka straight up.  That was another surprise.  With no burn and its smoothness, it was truly refreshing.  \n\nAnd I love the bread!  Delivered in a paper bag, it was a lovely brown bread with great texture and wasn't dry like some other brown breads.  The butter was sprinkled with ground fennel seed and sea salt.  Perfect. \n\nWe started with the white asparagus, morels, fennel confit, egg 63\u00b0C, hollandaise sauce, fried sour dough and the potato dumpling kumla, onion ragout, lingonberry, brown butter, lardon.  For the latter, when I took a bite with a bit of everything on the fork, it was heavenly!  And we used the bread to scrape the bowl of the former.  We were thisclose to picking up the bowls and licking them clean!\n\nFor our main courses, we shared the porter braised ox cheek, roasted beet root, fried onions, horseradish and the Swedish meat balls, potato puree, pan gravy, lingonberry, pickled cucumber.  The ox cheek were so tender.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate torte, cloudberry sorbet, meringue, blood orange olive oil and the cardamom spoon creme brulee, lime-mint marinated strawberry.  There were also blackberries and blueberries in the latter dessert.  \n\nService was also wonderful.

My siblings and I came here on a Saturday for a pre-theater dinner and we were not disappointed.  We weren't entirely sure what to expect for Scandinavian cuisine, but now I really want to travel to Norway, Sweden and other countries.  Until then, Plaj with be my go-to restaurant.\n\nWe ordered a total of 6 dishes for a party of 4, and it was the perfect amount of food.\n\nFlatbread served w/ chicken liver pate with added black truffles: Mmm mmm good!  The flatbread was light and crispy, and the pate had a good texture and flavors.  My sister probably could have licked that mason jar clean if she could have.\n\nGioia burrata w/ frilly red mustard greens, heirloom tomatoes, aquavit vinaigrette topped w/ rye bread crumbs: hard to go wrong here.  Perfect balance of richness from the burrata and acid from the tomatoes and vinaigrette.  The greens had just the right amount of bite and the bread crumbs added a delightful crunch.  \n\nTaste of herring: we had to split this 4 ways so I didn't get to try all 3 versions, and I think I had the ginger smoked soy and the saffron tomato versions.  They had distinct flavors but my mind was boggled by all the tastiness on the table and I couldn't figure out which I had.  It didn't matter though - they were both delicious.\n\nSeared sturgeon w/ chanterelle cream sauce, salmon roe, & asparagus - easily the best dish of the night!  The fish was cooked perfectly w/ a sear but still medium in the middle.  I could have filled a cup with the chanterelle sauce and sipped it all night long, it wasn't too rich and had delicious mushroom flavor.  Great balance on this plate.\n\nOx cheeks w/ beet puree, fried onions, and horseradish - a very close second.  Incredibly tender and flavorful meat, and I would have never guessed that you could turn beets into this delicious mound of creaminess.  The fried onions and horseradish are a nice touch.\n\nSwedish meatballs w/ potato puree, pan gravy and lingonberries - good but not necessarily memorable.  Maybe I was just eating too fast so I could get the last meatball.\n\nI was very impressed with the innovative dishes, flavors, textures, and overall balance of every dish.  Service was also lovely.  They had one tiny snafu where they brought out the asparagus dish that we didn't order but they cleared that up pretty quickly.  It was accidentally added onto our bill but our server was very apologetic and quickly took care of it.\n\nCocktails are also good - I had the Tulip because I can't get enough of lingonberry stuff!

I grew up eating the typical jewish cream herring and the flavors reminded me of my childhood.  Amazing!\nSo fresh and tender, I loved it.   The bartender, Kurt, recommended the strawberry dill soda since I didn't want to drink.  I was hesitant but it was amazing as well.  Sweet and strawberryish but with a dill aftertaste.  Brilliant!  Then I had the Krondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado and chili.  Each bite of the Lobster was better than the next.  The lobster was steamed perfectly and it was in a foam surrounding the lobster.  I could have eaten 2 of these dishes if I had the appetite.  The place isn't cheap but you get what you pay for.  Very high quality fish and ingredients and great presentation.  The bartender even let me try some of the Aquavit selections that they had.

The herring appetizer was the bomb, I could have had 3.  We tried almost everything on the menu and to be brutal, you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Seafood, beef, appetizers, dessert, you name it, the food just plain rocks.\n\nThe service was nice without being irritating. She checked on us periodically but was not pushy about it. It was actually very refreshing for the quality of the restaurant.\n\nThe last twist that I thought was pretty cool was that the bill came in a Swedish language book. Much more well thought out than having it in the standard bill folder or tray.", "author": "Chris B."}

With our only experience with Scandinavian food being Swedish meatballs, neither of us were sure what to expect.  The menu is largely comprised of small plates which are intended to be shared.  Our server did an excellent job of helping us navigate through the menu.\n\nBeef carpaccio -- I believe this was in the Dagen (daily) section.  It was very good but was probably the least interesting plate we ordered, and I wouldn't order it again.  I believe it had pickled onions (and a number of other garnishes that I can't recall) on it, but was otherwise pretty much what you would expect beef carpaccio to be (and not particularly \"Scandinavian\").\n\nPotato dumpling kumla -- very good, but larger and heavier than I was expecting. The sauce and toppings really made the dish.\n\nCoriander crusted tuna -- seared perfectly and a really innovative and unexpected flavor profile for tuna which is so often done in Asian flavors.  The licorice ponzu was subtle and not at all overwhelming, and the ginger jam was lick-the-plate good.\n\nElk loin -- even though we'd shared all the previous plates, I was pretty full by the time this came out which is unfortunate since it was absolutely delicious.  The elk was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  It was served with lightly pickled mushrooms which provided a nice but not overpoweringly tart counterpoint to the slightly sweet jus and the incredibly rich and decadent cheese pie.  This is one of those dishes that I'll be craving for years to come.\n\nAlthough all of the dishes were rather small, they were packed with flavor, very thoughtfully put together, and definitely left us feeling satisfied.  It was a rather expensive meal but well worth every penny.  I will definitely be coming back here.", "author": "Shana O."}

They also worked well with the food, which can be a rarity - cocktails overpower more often than not.\n\nAs for food, the burrata and mustard greens salad is fantastic, and the Saddle of venison (with amazing Scandinavian gratin - and I don't generally like gratin!) and house caraway smoked salmon were both spectacular. The venison was flawlessly medium rare, rich, moist, tender and flavorful. The salmon was similarly medium rare, warm, and melt-in-your-mouth tender with a wonderful subtle smokiness.\nThe only imperfect note of the evening was the Taste of Herring, in which we both felt the intensely flavored sauces and accompaniments overpowered the fish.\n\nThe rye bread for snacking was also great - dark and hearty; a true Bread of Sustenance.\n\nAll in all, a great experience, and most certainly worthy of a return trip, particularly given its perfect location adjacent to the Opera and Symphony halls.\nStrongly recommended.", "author": "Don H."}

So Swedish food tastes like CELEBRATION, even though I'm not even remotely Swedish. So if you've been pining for the fjords (or Gustaf Anders), Plaj is the place for you.\n\nEVERYthing we ate was wonderful. The beet, black truffle, watercress and candied hazelnut salad was delightful. The herring was wonderful, 3 different flavors, all heaven on a plate. The coriander crusted tuna with wasabi was the Japanese dish we will never get in a Japanese restaurant because coriander isn't very traditional - and it is wonderful with tuna. As good as the charcuterie plate was, with the wild boar salumi, cured lamb leg, cured lamb belly and cured pork belly, the meat winner was the venison. I had wonderful venison at Gustaf Anders. But this was the BEST venison I have ever had. The sauce...we kept picking up all the sauce from each dish with Acme's Swedish rye that they make for Plaj. I don't eat bread anymore. I make an exception for such wonderful rye bread.\n\nPushkin asked for cloudberries (moroshka) on his deathbed. You can get cloudberry sorbet on a delicious chocolate torte. Yum!\n\nThey had a wonderful selection of wines by the glass. We loved Michael David's 2008 Freakshow Cabernet from Lodi, CA. The red 2009 Carmenere from Grey Ventisquero Chile tasted like thyme and was great with fish and meat.\n\nWe ate at Benu a few days ago and were still amazed by the food at Plaj. 5 stars!\n\nAte at Plaj again when we had a nearby 8 pm show and were seated at 7:20. Our waiter knew exactly what to do to get us happily fed and on our way on time. We had the local herring and the local sardines.

The menu was pre-fixed and had a wonderful variety of options (everything from elk, to chicken, to local black cod). I started with the apple/almond salad, which was so yummy! My husband got the burrata salad which was a much richer salad to start, but still tasty. I then got the smoked salmon starter which came with a delicious pesto-like sauce. My husband tried the herring which was a much richer taste (reminded me of gingerbread). For my entree, the black cod was cooked perfectly and comes with these flavorful & hearty little mushrooms which I loved. Lastly for dessert I went with the apple pie which was the perfect combination of melt-in-your-mouth and crispy, it went beautifully with the vanilla ice cream.", "author": "Tori M."}

I have a soft spot for it as did my dinner companion. I didn't know such restaurant existed in San Francisco. The restaurant is connected with the Inn so it felt that I was visiting San Francisco as opposed to living near it. It reminds me of Europe, specifically, northern Europe. I liked the pickled herring. it reminded me going to the basement of Magasin in Copenhagen and getting the local treats. The ceiling seemed low, and the decor was suitably European. I came here for a birthday dinner and was positively surprised and thoroughly impressed. I didn't expect such a restaurant existed in San Francisco. It felt old school. It took me right back to my travels to northern Europe, which I do on an annual if not more frequent basis. I was never a big fan of meatballs, so that dish I could take or leave it. I like the mash potatoes. My companion was tired and full, and I am an adventurous eater so I charged ahead and went for the charcuterie plate which had wild boar, lam belly, pork belly, all cured and all salty and all very unusually tasty, but it's not the charcuterie you'd expect to get in France, nor Germany, or Italy. By then I could barely eat. I was so stuffed. I also liked the wine selection, though I only like red and found the selection were more Californian (intentionally, as I learned), and I was hoping for more of my stable French reds. It's the surprisingly fresh execution that made me happy. Ah, let's not forget venison - very good but heavier than I am used to. I love venison though and this is the best execution of venison I've ever tasted. \n\nIt's a very different type of experience because it felt intimate and romantic in an understated old European way. I would suggest to come with that special someone, and you'd have this memory captured for the rest of your life.  And when you visit Sweden, Denmark or Norway, you'd think to yourself, if I ever miss these beautiful countries and the cuisines they offer, I can always come here for a meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-23", "description": "I think the last time I had decent Scandinavian food was in Copenhagen.  \n\nPlaj is located inside a boutique hotel, and parking around here can be pretty difficult, especially when there are concerts/shows (there's a public parking lot, but it was full).  It wasn't until after we circled around for a long time that we realized they have valet, but I think even the valet lot was full.  The hotel is super cute, and the restaurant is located in the back.  There's a pretty long bar area, but they don't have a ton of tables, so definitely make a reservation.  The room is slightly dimmed, and our table had 2 chairs and a large leather couch with cushions to sit on, which felt very cozy.\n\nDrinks: they use lots of interesting Scandinavian liqueurs and spins on traditional cocktails.\n1. Stockholm: vodka, lillet, grapefruit bitters, with a cherry inside.  This one was stronger, good to start with, not too sweet\n2. Elderflower gimlet: gin, elderflower, and lots of lime. I loved the tartness and had 4 of these :p\n3. Kronan sour: like a pisco sour, but kronan is like a punch liqueur, so it's a lot sweeter.\n4. Beet up: beautiful red, with light ginger, tequila\n5. Norwegian sunset: also pretty colors, kind of orange themed in flavor \nI think there were more we got, but now I can't remember..\n\nThe menu is kind of small plates style, meant to be shared.  A few of the dishes are bigger (the beta section, which means meat).  We may have gone a little overboard for 4 people...\n1. Lobster: lobster was poached with krondill, topped with caviar and a foam that was a little creamier than I like\n2. Swedish meatballs: 3 in a 1/2 order for $14, 5 for a full order for $17.  The gravy, lingonberry jam, potato puree, and pickled cucumbers all went perfectly with the meatballs\n3. Ox cheek: surprisingly lean, loved the pear parsnip puree. The fried onion added great texture to the dish, and the chard was cooked nicely.\n4. Gioia burrata: burrata at a Scandinavian place?  Why not?  The red frilly mustard greens had an interesting texture and went well with the burrata and tomatoes\n5. Green strong farms crops: all I saw when I looked at this was 65 degree egg. The truffle is subtle, as the hollandaise kind of dominates. The rye croutons are nice for texture\n6. Gravalax: not as smoky as I expected, not bad. The Swedish mustard was a nice touch.\n7. Skrei tongue: fried tongue of skrei (a Scandinavian fish); ended up tasting very similar to filet o fish..\n8. Smoked salmon cod fritters: amazing!  So much flavor, with a good mix of fish inside, best eaten freshly fried. It's served on a dill aioli\n9. Pork belly: fatty as expected, tender.  The \"swedish mash\" was actually like a carrot puree, which was not done with cream, so it was good to balance out the pork belly.  Brussels sprouts leaves are nice, too.\n10. Venison: lean but tender, amazing reduction underneath, good potato cake and chantarelles.  \n11. Lamb neck cassoulet: comfort food in a mini Le Creuset pot, kind of like a creamier and richer version of beef stew with gnocchi inside.  It was my first time having lamb neck, and it wasn't bad \n\nDesserts:\n1. Apple cake: warm, lots of apples, with ice cream on top\n2. Princess cake: served in a cup with raspberry jam, pastry cream, marzipan, topped with the traditional green outside of a princess cake\n3. Sugar n stout: dark rum, chocolate bitters, stout.. interesting.\n\nFor 4 people, we had a lot of food and a lot of rounds of cocktails (4 or 5 rounds a person), and the total ended up being around $500 with tax/tip, which isn't cheap, but it's not bad at all for how much stuff we got.  I really liked Plaj and am excited to have this new addition to the SF food scene. It's nice to finally have some different food styles in SF!", "author": "Marilyn H."}

The drinks are elegant, I had a Copenhagen and my friend had two Elderflower gimlets both drinks were soo good.

It could work for vegetarians as well but not Vegans. The veggie dishes are out of this world!  We all loved the beet dish. Deserts are large, we all agreed that we should have shared two instead of getting four. The herbed bread may be the best bread I have ever tasted!\nThe service was a little spotty...perhaps we were a little loud...but I had to ask for water and our ice bucket with our bubbles  was put out of reach but the wait person didn't offer to refill, they did put a candle on my friends desert when I requested it but overall the service was a bit chilly or I would have given it five stars.", "author": "solell s."}

My fiance and I did not have much of a conversation the first few minutes after the food arrived.  \n\nFor entree, we had the roasted chicken and the meatballs. I couldn't resist ordering meatballs. I have a soft spot for meatballs. These meatballs are slightly different from the homemade Swedish meatballs that you have in Sweden, but they are still exceptionally good. They melted in my mouth with the lingonberry jam. \n\nService was outstanding! Friendly and service minded staff. \n\nPS. The owner and main chef, Robert, is a  very nice guy.

Seriously, we found parking right across the street.\n\nThe restaurant is located inside a small boutique hotel, so you do feel like you're just hanging out in the lobby of a hotel.  It's got a fancier vibe to it, but even though I wasn't spiffed up (I was wearing my black and orange for Orange Friday - Go Giants!), I didn't feel out of place.\n\nOur waiter advised us that their dishes were made on the smaller side so we would have a chance to try more dishes.  He also recommended about two dishes per person.\n\nHue L, our NYF and I decided to split everything family-style.\n\nFIRST COURSE: \nGioia burrata, organic greens, heirloom tomato, fresh herbs, aquavit vinaigrette.  Really fresh and tasty.  I would order this gain.\n\nTaste of Herring: saffron tomato, coriander chili, lime, ginger smoked soy.  Not bad.  We ordered this because it sounded like a very Scandinavian kind of dish.\n\nKrondill poached lobster Skagen, white fish caviar, horseradish, avocado, chili.  Super yummy.  The lobster was perfect and I liked the foamy stuff it was in.\n\nSECOND COURSE:\nPorter braised ox cheek, roasted beet root, fried onions, horseradish.  Ox cheek was tender and oh-so-good.  And I really liked the pureed beets.  It was bright red and scary looking, but tasted just like mashed potatoes.  Yum!\n\nCharcuteri: fennalar-salted lamb, syltrulle-cured pork belly, wild boar salami, prinskorv- pork sausage spicy gooseberry jam, grilled rye.  Not bad.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  My favorites were the toast with the spicy gooseberry jam.\n\nDESSERT:\nChocolate torte, cloudberry sorbet, meringue, blood orange olive oil.  My favorite dessert out of the two.  I have no idea what cloudberry is, but I do know it's tasty!  I like the meringue too.  That definitely added a nice texture to the dish.\n\nCardamom spoon cr\u00e8me brulee, lime-mint marinated strawberries.  Nothing really special about the creme brulee.  It's something you can pretty much get anywhere.  \n\nPRICE:  For three people with one drink each plus tax and tip - $165.\n\nOh, and the drinks are quite tasty.

Not too pretentious, decent food (some hit and miss; some were excellent, others too rich/heavy/bland or too salty; the elk was slightly overcooked  and the cod was underdone), at an expensive price point.  It could be argued that the food fits the price, however at up to $30+ dollars for an entree, I would expect service to be equivalent, but unfortunately it is not.  Plaj required a credit card for reservations and warns that you may lose your table and be charged $20 per person if more than 15 minutes late. For our party of 6, we were seated promptly but waited 15 minutes before the server came by, 25 mins for drinks, 35 mins for bread, and *she never checked on us during the meal*.  Their rules for promptness apparently do not apply to them; the server is not waiting on the diner, rather it is the customer that is waiting on Pl\u00e4j.  \n\nAt one point, while we were still eating, they started clearing the plates! It wasn't as if they didn't know since we still had the utensils in our hands. I guess they realized they were going to have to be a bit better with timing if they didn't want to close late since they took so long at the beginning of the meal but clearing plates while people are eating is not the right way to fix your errors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-21", "description": "J wanted to try something different, and suggested Pl\u00e4j, since neither of us have ever really had Scandinavian food before.  3 stars is actually a very generous rating, IMO.\n\nAMBIANCE: The dining room/bar is dimly lit, with a weird mix of baroque/hunting lodge/modern design elements.  When we walked in there was low key instrumentals playing softly in the background, but throughout the meal house/electronica (although... they did play some Swedish House Mafia... appropriate?) would blare over the speaker system.  It was a very strange juxtaposition given the design/feel of the space.  The restaurant was pretty empty (it was a random Sunday) and only got emptier as the night went on.  The fact that Pl\u00e4j is situated in a hotel in the Tenderloin probably doesn't help them bring in crowds.\n\nSERVICE: Of the two staff members working the restaurant, one was friendlier than the other.  Both were fairly professional, but as other Yelpers have mentioned, service was rather slow and inconsistent.\n\nFOOD: We followed the 4 for 2 plan, with two larger plates and two smaller plates to share.  I actually think 3 plates would have been sufficient (especially if you plan to order dessert). \n- Smoked halibut & salmon fritters ($12): Not exactly what I was expecting, given the \"fritter\" name-- these were arancini-like (or perhaps the fried potato balls from Porto's in LA is a better description) lightly fried balls of yumminess.  It didn't seem like there was much fish in each ball, but the smoky flavor was apparent in each bite, and went very well with the accompanying dill tartar sauce.  One of my fave dishes of the night, and also one of the most flavorful.\n- \"Taste of Herring\" ($14): Really pretty plating-- almost minimalistic, yet very colorful.  Interesting flavors/textures--  light and refreshing, but I found all flavor combinations to be too sweet.   \n- Pork belly ($24): I preferred this to the ox cheek.  The flavors were VERY delicate, borderline bland... except the Brussels sprouts were SO SALTY.  I liked the Swedish mash (cauliflower and carrot?  Maybe some cabbage?).\n- Braised ox cheek ($25): When this plate arrived at our table, I uttered a silent \"wow.\"  So colorful!  The beet pur\u00e9e was gorgeous, especially against the white of the bowl!  However, the color belied the flavor-- not very beet-y at all; tasted more like traditional mashed potatoes.  The ox cheek had a very strong beefy flavor, so if you're into that, then you'll likely love this dish.  I wasn't a huge fan of that gaminess, especially when paired with the stringy toughness of the meat.\n- Princess cake ($10): recommended to us by one of the servers.  She described it as a \"light lemon chiffon cake layered with raspberry preserves and fresh whipped cream in a mason jar... and covered with a thin layer of marzipan.\"  Sounded good, so imagine my utter disappointment when bite after bite of this dessert was STALE, CRUSTY and FLAVORLESS.  Actually, I kinda wanted to vomit after the initial bite, but decided to soldier on because I didn't want to waste $10.  This dessert was really difficult to eat-- the opening of the mason jar was on the small side, and trying to dig into a hard cake led to some (minor) mishaps.\n\nOVERALL: The presentation was gorgeous (comparable to much higher end restaurants), but the flavor fell short for having such bright, bold plating.  But perhaps delicate flavors are what Scandinavian food is all about?  I wouldn't know, seeing as my past forays with this region's cuisine have been limited to Ikea.  I don't have an issue with the portion sizes, but I do think that the price point is high for the overall flavor of the dishes and service provided.  We ended up spending ~$120+ (including tax & tip) for the above dishes and ONE beer ($11).  Not worth it, even if you ARE paying for novelty.", "author": "Susanna W."}

What I got was a thorough intro to intricate dishes with unusual ingredients and combination and beautiful plating.\n\nLocated discreetly in the rear of the Inn of the Opera, the dining room is warm and homey and exudes Scandinavian sensibilities.\n\nFirst off, we had cocktails.  The Plajer (Buffalo Trace Bourbon, dried apricot cinnamon gastrique, strawberry) was refreshing and uniquely delicious and was a big hit.  On the other hand, the Plaj Thyme (Bols Genevere Danish Gin, blueberries, thyme, lavender) was too tart and overpowered by the thyme, whereas the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Bols Genevere Danish Gin, elderflower liqueur, egg white, Angostura bitters) was overly sweet and disappointing.  \n\nBeers are all Nordic in origin, including the two on draft.  Cool!  But strangely, both draft beers were way too strong, hoppy and overpowering for the meal.  Better to stick with a bottled pale ale\n\n\nAs for dishes, we shared plates and my favorites included:\n\n1. Potato dumpling kumla with onion ragout, and lingonberry - great texture on the dumplings - slightly crispy but gooey on the inside\n\n2. Swedish meat balls, potato puree, pan gravy, lingonberry, pickled cucumber - great dish (much better than the Ikea version) ;)\n\n3. Krondill poached lobster Skagen with white fish caviar - beautiful dish with an abundance of foam\n\n4. Porter braised ox cheek, roasted beet root, fried onions, horseradish - delish!\n\n5. Cubes of venison with a side of Scandinavian potato gratin, Juniper berry jus. - liked that these were cooked  medium rare and not rare, which is often the case with venison.\n\nWasn't as fond with the white asparagus with 65\u00b0C poached egg - the hollandaise (or maybe the white asparagus itself) was too sweet.  Also, the gravlax was okay but nothing spectacular.  Finally, the taste of herring was a must for a Scandinavian restaurant - but I found it to be expectedly too fishy.\n\nFor dessert, the chocolate torte with meringue pieces was great, although I thought the tart cloudberry sorbet (which looks like vanilla) was an odd combination that didn't pair well.  The cardamom creme brulee was ok.\n\nFriendly service (although they seemed overstretched at times ... it took a while to get drinks or more bread).\n\nCaution: there's a woman impersonating the valet here.

He made me feel at ease and I was excited to go!\n\nWe ordered a few dishes and I have to really rave about one in particular -- \n\nThe beet root salad with Jerusalem artichokes. It was so scrumptious and the beets were the best I've ever tasted. Ever. \n\nMy companions liked their starters too (apparently, the potato dumplings are delicious as well! But, not gluten free. Boo.) and we were happy with the meal thus far. \n\nMains came out and my beef tenderloin with sunchoke puree was really great. The meat was cooked perfectly but I felt it was a little under-seasoned. The sunchoke puree and delicious jus made up for it, though. \n\nMy other companions like their food very much, except the overpowering horseradish covering my friend's Ox cheek dish. The meat itself was very good, but she said the horseradish blew out her palate pretty quickly. \n\nWe had all intended to order dessert, but we ended up having to rush off to see our play instead. \n\ntl;dr: yummy food, nice ambiance, eat the beets", "author": "Amy J."}

Great food, great service, warm subdued atmosphere.\nOur first trip was for my birthday in July there were four of us and I think we ordered everything on the menu. Highlights were the Beef Check, the Lobster Bisque with Lobster and Roe, the Jerusalem Artichoke salad, and the Bass.\n\nNext trip was with a fantastic foodie gf of ours. Again Lobster dish was out of this world as were the beef checks. We all loved the beet salad with a Scandinavian Cheese on top. This dinner involved ending the meal with Aquavit yummy good shot of anise flavored goodness. \n\nLast trip was with bf's 90+ french teacher. She loved the place as did we again. She oreded the meatballs which were dense but light and came with a sweet/tart ligon berry compote over mashed potatoes. This time we got the smoked salamon and seriously nothing should taste that good!! Oh and of course we got the lobster dish bc if I could hook up a shower with the bisque I would never get out!!! \n\nFull bar, great cocktail selection, I am drawing a blank right now but there was a bourbon based drink that I loved the first night. Small but effective wine list. Not too pricey well for a great night our in SF average 50 to 60 pp. \n\nTrust me Scandinavian chef combined with California fresh produce and meats = best new restaraunt in SF!\n\nI love coming here and cannot wait to come back again!!", "author": "Matthew B."}

All were delicious and unique (to my palate).  The menu warns you that the plates are to be shared and not large, but we felt like they were medium sized and walked out overstuffed (but happy).  Walking to the restaurant, you literally have to walk through a hotel lobby.  Location is great if you are going to the symphony (like we were); however, remember to let your server know that.

The plate sizes were good tapa sizes and it was nice to order a variety of dishes between the four of us and sample a little bit of everything. The sauces to all the dishes were all finger licking, pick-up-the-dish-and-lick-up-the-sauce delicious. I also liked the cocktails here. \n\nService was super attentive!

We came to Plaj (pronounced \"play\") before the Opera last night to give Scandinavian food a first try. The restaurant is located inside the Opera Inn, and features elegant wooden decor, but is a very small location (maybe 40 people). We did not have reservations, so we were seated at the bar, which was fine, because the place was packed. We were first served warm bread and butter, which felt freshly backed. For appetizer, we got the squid which was decorated with dill and a dill sour cream, which completed the lightly fried squid very well. For the main dish, I decided that I had to try the herring, being of Russian origin, I am practically a connoisseur. And I must say, the herring blew me away! And anyone who hasn't tried herring before, should give this one a try. Every bite is the ideal blend of sweet, while salty. The dish came with purple potatoes that were covered in dill. My date got the smoked salmon (another common Russian food for us), and she said it was even better than the one she makes at home (and they were able to smoke a very thick piece of salmon!). Lastly, for dessert we got the most popular chocolate dish, were tasted like a fancy brownie, nothing super special, but brownies are always good. The service here was fantastic, and we left very satisfied. Overall, a great place to go before the Opera (if you haven't see Showboat, go while you can!).", "author": "Nikita K."}

My prior experience of Scandinavian foods was limited to a dinner I fixed myself using recipes from Time Life Foods of the World The Cooking of Scandinavia (don't laugh!). If Plaj is any indication, this is a cuisine that deserves to be better known.\n\nI live in East Bay and since I have SF Ballet season tickets, for 2 PM performance, am frequently in SF for Saturday lunch but rarely for dinner. This limits me as many restaurants either are not open for lunch at all or only on weekdays. So I never tried Plaj before. But decided to splurge; went to Cavalier for lunch before Nutcracker and to Plaj for dinner. Quite the day! \n\nI had a 5 PM reservation, not wanting to hang out on the cold streets longer than I needed. Promptly seated as soon as they opened.\n\nI ordered a cocktail called tulip. Sparkling wine, lingonberry, rhubarb, lemon. Lighter than a \"straight\" glass of wine or mixed drink. Just slightly sweet. Perfect. For appetizer I got the bread with caramelized butter and gravlax. The bread was so good, I could have eaten all 4 slices but (with difficulty) wrapped up two to take home for a sandwich. Also gravlax, paper thin slices, with paper thin watermelon radish shavings, celery sorbet and rye crumbs. The sorbet was not something you eat every day but was great, so was the fish, everything. Gobbled every bite. For entree I got Swedish meatballs. I was worried they may come in cream sauce (I dislike creamy sauces) but it was a brown sauce, the meatballs was crisp on the outside and tender within, full of flavor. Came with potato puree, basically mashed potatoes with no lumps!, lingonberries, and a pile of very thinly sliced marinated cucumber. Everything worked well together. Also got Earl Gray tea. Tea was standard, but they were very attentive in refilling my teapot and replacing the dribbly saucer without my asking. These are the little things that make good food a great restaurant. Desserts, oh my, so many looked good. I'd had ice cream with lunch and have lactose problems so avoided having ice cream again. Hesitated over the apple pie with granola crust, but settled on Northern Lights. A sophisticated take on baked Alaska. It had a disk of rich chocolate terrine with a slightly fruity flavor, topped with passion fruit sorbet, then a dome of soft meringue lightly browned. Rich chocolate, tart/sweet sorbet, soft slightly warm meringue, this was not a dessert, it was a Beethoven symphony. \n\nI may need to make an excuse to be in SF some evening again so I can come back here and try other things.", "author": "Carol S."}

I'm really, really proud of my Norwegian heritage, and I'm usually dismayed by the cartoonish American presentation of Scandinavia and what is really a very delicate and refined cuisine. I was blown away by Pl\u00e5j.\nThe setting is very comfortable, like a living room. Just enough formal to make it feel special, and refined, but not heavy or stuffy. In Norwegian, \"det v\u00e6r koslig!\" The staff was extremely nice, and work on a team system. More than once we asked for things or changed our orders with people not assigned to our table, and they got every single thing right, and did so with genuine smiles. They know they are getting this right!\nThe owner and head chef is fully Swedish, and this man knows what he is doing! He takes long-loved traditional plates and presents them with a The menu is fantastic. Very creative, yet very approachable for people not accustomed to Scandinavian faire. Some things that we absolutely LOVE (herring) are acquired tastes that many people have yet to develop, but at Pl\u00e5j, they are presented in creative ways that will appeal to nearly everyone. I especially recommend the poached lobster, the pork belly, the charcuterie, and gravloks. No offense to other cuisines, but no one on earth can do lobster and salmon like the Scandinavians.\nThe drinks were also excellent, and again, really creative. Aquavit (akavit) is the Scandinavian equivalent of tequila: our national drink, but many people struggle with the strong anis flavor. At Pl\u00e5j, they creatively find complementary flavors and present this regional treasure in delicious and unexpected ways.\nFinally, the desserts were exceptional, ranging from savory to sweet. Highly recommend the saffron donuts and the rhubarb. All in all, this place was an instant favorite, coming from a Scandinavian purist.", "author": "James N."}

We sat down at 5:30PM and did not leave until after 8:30PM, as the service was painfully slow. It took an hour before our first dish was served (cloudberry jam and Norwegian flatbread). \n\nWe decided to treat the meal as a 'tasting for 2' and ordered 10 dishes, as the menu suggested that the dishes were portioned so that you could try several dishes. We were stuffed by they 7th and could have done without a few of the items that came highly recommended. \n\nI would recommend the taste of herring and poached lobster, if you're looking for something different and refreshing. The Swedish meatballs seem to be popular -- they were tasty (not dry, like some reviews had mentioned) but they didn't particularly stand out. The staff made the potato dumplings sound amazing but we could have easily done without -- the dumplings were mealy and the sauce was too oily. \n\nIn general, we found that a lot of the dishes used a bit too much cream (i.e. our halibut was drowning in cream so we couldn't even taste the fish).

Sparkling wine overpowered anything else.         \n- Kronan sour: Perfect balance of sweet and citrus. I loved it! Egg white foam was nice. I had two of this, and the second one had not as much foam as before.       \n\n- Poached lobster: There were three small lumps in brownish foam. These three small lumps, it turns out, were lobster with fish roe. The lobster was great, cooked to perfection and the foamy sauce was yummy. I wish there were more of lobster though.\n- Cloudberry jam: A small small jar of jam, and $20. This is expensive, but the jam tastes definitely different from anything I had before.    \n- A taste of herring: Pickled herring. This is not for everyone! Eek, not my plate of dish.\n- Screi tongue: I wasn't a big fan. The tongue meat felt almost non-existent inside the outside fried dough.

The place is dark and tastefully decorated but I would not call it a really romantic place; I'd say its more for fine dinning and experiencing a cuisine not common in this part of the world.\n\nThe Staff:\nThe staff was quiet and discrete which I really enjoy. Plus we had an issue with one of our dishes and the staff was more than happy to accommodate us. I have never had that good of a reaction before and I will always appreciate it.\n\nFood:\nThough some of the names sound intimidating once you look over it once or twice I think it will be pretty intuitive. Here's what we got:\n-Scandinavian and domestic cheeses: \nThis was good but I wouldn't strongly recommend getting it without extra bread or if you're a cheese nut. I felt like there was too much cheese and it was hard to spread on anything, but dish was good especially the jams and fruits.\n-Swedish meatballs: \nThis was one of my favorites, though I wasn't a big fan of the lingonberry jam on the meat. Aside from my minor gripe this is a simple dish and an easy home run. We both loved having the meatball with the pickled cucumber.\n-Local Rabbit:\nThis is very tasty, succulent and garlic-y which I love and is a generous portion of food.\n-Elk Saddle:\nCooked perfectly and was good with the mushrooms. Personally, the rhubarb was too bitter for me to eat and in hindsight its a bit too expensive; I couldn't see myself ordering it again if I am honest. Despite my issues I managed to finish it and was satisfied.\n\n(just for an idea this was about $110 before the tip)\n\nConclusion:\nI would recommend this place if you're willing and able to afford an extravagant evening (like seeing an opera or an anniversary). Though you may see people dressed up, as long as you're in khakis and a button down (even short sleeve) you will be fine. If you have time constraints please let the  staff know; we didn't have drink or dessert (we were too full) and we spent 2 hours there... Also, even though I said this place isn't really romantic I would not recommend a group bigger than 4, or 5 people.", "author": "Josh L."}

I took my husband  there last night for his birthday before seeing a show and it was a magical surprise. I had read all the good reviews and i had wanted to go for a long time but never could make it. Last night we got there early with a reservation easily made on OpenTable. We were seated immediately.. the service was impeccable throuout the entire meal. The menu is different from most menus that I've seen. So it's important to be open to new experiences. But everything we had from the bread to the desert was superb. We started off with two first courses which we were able to share. In fact sharing is something that they do very willingly and openly. We had a wonderful salad and these salmon fritters that were to die for.  My main dish was a lobster dish that was very reasonably priced for lobster. It was not a heavy dish but each bite was extraordinary.  My husband had the saddle of elk. Even bite melted and burst in your mouth at the same time. We shared the apple pie with homemade ice cream and it was delicious. But there were so many more desserts to choose from and I would love to go back and try them all. They're all quite unusual. The chef is Swedish. And his vision is spectacular.  Don't miss out on this wonderful experience.", "author": "Joan J."}

Cooked delicately to the right texture, mixed with egg and some exotic mushroom, I recommend this.\n\nFor mains, we had the poached lobster, which comes as an odd but delicious foamy mess, and meatballs, which have many layers of flavors and textures.  Unlike anything you've ever had (including IKEA).  \n\nBottom line, the flavors were diverse and balanced and delicious, with nothing too bold.

I was so embarrassed I brought him here and I was so excited about it- it just ruined my night and I felt so bad afterwards. \nI have been to Plaj several times and it used to be my favourite restaurant in San Francisco, ever since I moved from Copenhagen. I love the food here, I feel it is highly representative for the Scandinavian culture. \nI have called the restaurant to let them know we were running 10 mins late, so the lady on the phone agreed to 8:30, instead of 8:00 pm. We got there at 8:20 and I was asked my name and supposedly checked in.\nWe moved to the bar, while waiting for a table. The bartender- so unwelcoming. We suggested we moved from there, because there MIGHT be 2 persons sitting on those seats. No one was. The blonde lady comes up to us and asks my name again.\nWe're being seated and we order. The beers were brought to us after around 30 mins of waiting, after I have asked 2 different waiters about our drinks.\nWe got the appetizers and then the bread. At some point, I as for more bread and I am told, on an arrogant tone, that it costs 3 bucks more! I am paying 100$ for my dinner and you think I care about the 3 extra dollars for the bread. That's sweet.\nThe waitresses were totally ignoring us, we had piles of empty appetizer plates and bottles and glasses of beer. And then, without cleaning the plates, they brink us the main course.\nExcept that I am getting the potato and bacon dumpling again, instead of my main course. So, instead to taking both dishes back, until we can both get our food, my boyfriend is left with his plate. And I am waiting 20 mins more to get, AGAIN, the potato  dumpling. I thought it was a joke.\nThe blonde lady from the entrance is asking my name AGAIN. I mean, seriously.\nAfter around 5 mins, I get my main course, but my boyfriend is already done with his dish. By that point, I just felt like crying.\nI couldn't believe that we got such a poor service, for no reason. \nI have politely asked for our check and have explained the situation to our waitress (the lady from Latvia), who had ignored us all night and had mixed up our order in the worse possible way.\nI have never seen so much ignorance, arrogance and amateur service- ever! \nOh, and apart from this, I got an e-mail from OpenTable, saying that we missed our reservation- which means that that incompetent at the entrance hadn't even checked us in. \nI cannot find words to explain how disappointed I am with this restaurant's staff and how uncomfortable and embarrassed I felt to bring my boyfriend here. \nThis is unacceptable and, even though the food is great and I have been here around 5 times in the last 4 months, this was the last time I stepped into this restaurant.\nObnoxious service.", "author": "Andreea C."}

Then, beginning in 2010, Noma in Copenhagen Denmark won best restaurant in the world three years in a row. Plaj is not \"authentic\" Scandinavian food - it's very, very good food made with some Scandinavian ingredients. I ate at the bar prior to the David Brooks/Robert Reich City Arts lecture (the restaurant was full of gray heads). I only had the asparagus and the scallops but the sauce on the scallops was wonderful - cream infused with butter ;) & yummy fennel.  A pre-game Stockholm and post game Brandy Alexander were just right for a Monday night. The bread was just like the graham flour bread I made in high school - my grandmother taught me - yes, Scandinavians could always bake!  At Plaj 21st century Scandinavians have learned to make sublime sauces without overcooking the meat, fish and vegetables.", "author": "Susan P."}

The octopus salad rates a 3 star; the gnocchi with mushrooms, a 4 star, and the non-gravlaks smoked salmon, a 3 star.  Portions are small -- even by tapas standards.  The Trefethen Chardonnay (glass) rates 4 stars and the Pinot Noir, (glass), 2 stars.  They have no wine by the half-bottle, a pity for those going to a 3 hour performance.  The service was 2 star.  The problem is that Plaj has \"Attitude\" which it fails to live up to.  The low point was when the server dropped the dish of butter onto my wife's plate with a loud crash.  Accidents happen--no big deal.  But his remark, \"Good thing I didn't drop it into your lap, my dear\" was inappropriate and rude.  \"My Dear\"?!

Plan on having several small courses, and staying a little longer than you might usually linger in a restaurant.  The chairs are comfy, the table linens are crisp, the music is pleasant, the decor is stately but welcoming.

Each one has amazing things to offer. For Hagen, opted for the burrata salad and potato dumplings -- both delectable; for Fjord we felt compelled to get the herring and also got the tuna; the herring was surprisingly tasty and NOT \"fishy\" and the tuna stood its own with any world-class ahi you can get in SF; for Beta we naturally selected the Swedish meat balls which were actually less amazing than we'd sort of hoped for at this particular establishment (a bit smaller and crustier than at least what I'd imagined at least on my end of personally diving into an immersive comfort food experience). The Godis was again fatalistically the Swedish apple pie (awesome) and the creme brulee (not quite awesome).\n\nThe service certainly hit the mark, and the food great with the few exceptions hinted at above (as in, the meatballs should have been exceptional and they weren't); also the portions were a bit skimpy so if you go in a group that wants to share, be sure to order at least 2 of each dish.

I read about Plaj in my hotel's San Francisco magazine and I was just enchanted with my whole experience. First of all, I've never been so spoiled by a bartender....Kurt not only exhibited an unusually high competence at his job, a professional, welcoming demeanor that demonstrated the good judgement of the management for bringing someone like him on board to this four month old restaurant, but he also treated me like gold the entire evening, schooling me on Aquavit and all manner of locally distilled spirits. I was delighted. I started with the Tulip as an aperitif, which was lovely, but in watching him prepare other cocktails, I have to say that they all looked quite wonderful and carefully thought through & constructed. He generously offered to let me sample a few here and there, including the absolutely *delicious*  Pl\u00e4jer, though each one seemed so wonderfully balanced and thoughtfully created that I felt as if you could hardly do wrong on their carefully concocted cocktail menu. I had a reisling with my entree that was just what I was looking for. \n\nThe food was sublime. I started with a beet salad that included tastes of lingonberry, shaved truffle, toasted hazelnut, the freshest imaginable watercress, carefully dressed, and a special Swedish cheese that added complexity to the salad. I moved on to a Halibut that had a lovely crust and sat in a pool of the most wonderfully herbaceous cream sauce. The chanterrelles were delicious and an addition of salmon roe added a briny complexity to the dish that proved a perfect foil to the cream. \n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant was very mellow and the clientele was generally \"older\". At 35, I felt rather like one of the younger in the patronage set, but I enjoyed this wonderfully chill evening and felt very well taken care of. The concierge of the hotel got a cab for my ride back to my own hotel, and all in all, I cannot offer even one petty complaint. It was a wonderfully perfect evening. XOXO Thank you, folks!

Started with the Potato Dumpling which was a wonderful collection of flavors although I probably wouldn't order it again (consistency is a bit too \"gnocchi-like\" for me).  One \"main course\" was the tuna, which was excellent although I was taken aback at first by the fact that it was served cold; there was no indication on the menu that that was the case. The second, ordered by my companion, was the halibut which was simply fabulous. To close, a mouth-watering chocolate torte infused with orange, out of this world good.\n\nThe reason I put \"main course\" in quotes is that if you just look at the menu online, you might think this is a relatively inexpensive restaurant. However, as the menu makes clear (the actual menu, not the online menu), these are all \"small\" portions. As it turns out, my wife and I almost always get two meals for the price of one at restaurants, since the portions are twice as big as either of us wants to eat. Here, the portions were perfect - you're very unlikely to go home with leftovers, but, if you're like us, you won't go home hungry either.

In fact, their wine prices are actually higher than advertised on their online menu. Absent altogether are bottles of red under $50 or glasses under about $14. Given how many high quality, reasonably priced bottles of wine they could include, I find that unacceptable.  I spent $45,  had a few bites of vegetarian small plates and one beer (the least expensive on the menu) and left hungry. So, bear this in mind unless your budget is large.

When I read the menu I was impressed by the authentic dishes that were offered.  I grew up eating many of these things. I was beyond disappointed with the Lefse dish.  The Lefse was fried which makes it a glorified potato chip.   It was a huge let down because Lefse is one of my favorite things.  It is a labor intensive process to make good Lefse, so the thought of being able to get quality Lefse in the city was very exciting to me.   Besides the lefse, every other dish we ate was excellent.  My Swedish meatballs with lingonberry really hit the spot.   The bread was also excellent.\nThe service was beyond fantastic.  The staff was knowledgable and friendly.  They definitely created a great atmosphere.  I just wish that the one thing I was excited about eating here, Lefse, was served how Lefse was intended to be eaten.

Being a first generation Swede and the daughter of a Swedish Chef (no pun intended!) this restaurant served up an experience I will never forget.  The food was outrageously good and the service was polite and accommodating.  We sat at the bar and Kurt (Curt?) served us.  We had ros\u00e9 and some white wine and we were able to taste a few before making our decision.  We had the gravlax with homemade mustard sauce which was amazing.  We ate it with the rye bread slices they give you which is the best bread I've ever had in a restaurant.  Swedes are big on dark bread so no surprise there, I wonder if they bake it themselves. Next we had the gnocchi with morels served with nettle cream and V\u00e4sterbotten cheese--the most amazing cheese in the world--this was the highlight of my evening and I have not been able to stop thinking about the flavors of this dish.  The gnocchi were different from traditional Italian gnocchi, not nearly as firm, these were light and puffy.  Lastly, although I don't typically eat or like meat, the Swedish meatballs stole the show.  We learned that they are 100% beef (excellent for those of us who don't care for pork) and they put a bit more all spice than most other recipes call for... they were phenomenal; served up traditionally with lingonberry jam and mashed potatoes.  For dessert we had a rhubarb tarte with pecans and ice cream, it was the perfect finish to our dinner.  Our awesome bartender bought us a round of Kronan Swedish Punsch (which is better than aquavit in my opinion) and the chef came out to do a shot with us and let us talk up the deliciousness we had just experienced.  If you are looking for a unique culinary experience, this is the perfect place to begin.  I will be eating here very often!

The interior is modern, cozy and spotless. The owners are this adorable married couple and are super hands-on. The husband is the main chef and he is basically produces miracles with food. Each dish we have had not only tastes super fresh, it tastes so homemade, as if you're mom was cooking along side him. The halibut, potato dumplings, and Sweedish meatballs are to die for! The wife, Andrea, meets everyone and makes sure everything is perfect. The cocktails are so addicting. I highly recommend the \"Payr\" - I'm not much of a drinker, but have been managing to consume a few of these each time we have gone.

My only thought was how great is Scandinavian food.  It's not really talked about though the hype over this region seems to have picked up over the last couple years.  I finally got to go here last Thursday with a couple of my friends.   I wanted to try things like herring and venison but I was handcuffed a bit by my friends.  Lucky for me what we did order was really good and now I have an excuse to go back not that I'd need one.  I'm always a nit pick on service and Plaj was on point.  I'm constantly looking for that place that judges their guests and when I entered the hotel in which Plaj was located in I was expecting that.  Thankfully, they let me down and I was greeted warmly and seated immediately.  Our server (and I wish I remembered her name) was fantastic all night.  We ordered the Gioia burrata, White Asparagus,  poached lobster, Fish of the day which was Halibut, Coriander crusted tuna, and Cheese plate. The Gioia was my least favorite and probably won't be ordering it again.  Looked like a nice dish but flavors were nothing exciting.  The other dishes however were fantastic especially the halibut which I'm not usually a fan of ordering but in this case it was the star of the night for me and had one of the best sauces I've ever tasted.  Lobster and Asparagus were excellent as I was expecting based on the descriptions in the menu.  The cheese was surprising as there was a brown cheese from Scandinavia I had never tried before that was sweet and delicious.  Overall this is now one of my favorite restaurants and I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Joco F."}

Nice calm atmosphere and the couch I was sat on was so comfy. The location is a little walk away from market street in a fairly quite area, at least it was at night, which was nice. The food was delicious. The dishes are set in a way to order a few and share. Our first course was the poached egg, king trumpet mushrooms and white asparagus with a hollandaise sauce that was more tart and matched well with the fennel confit and the rye croutons gave a nice mix of textures to the dish. We also had the beet root salad with summer black truffles, watercress and hazelnuts which was delicious. the beets were warm which was a little unexpected to us, and the truffle in combination with everything was just delicious. The next set of dishes were the poached lobster and caviar with horseradish and avocado, and the charcuteri board consisting of cured lamb's belly and leg, wild board salami, and a cured pork belly paired with spicy gooseberry jam, some rye toast and stone ground mustard seeds. The lobster dish was served at room temp which was also unexpected, but had this absolutely scrumptious broth that was pretty much wiped clean by the end of that dish. The charcuteri board was also delicious, my favorite being the cured lamb's leg, and the wild board my least, just didn't stand out. For our final dish we had the pork belly over swedish mash, brussel sprouts and mustard greens, which was alright. most of the flavors were mild in this dish, but was still satisfying. For dessert we decided on the cardamon creme brulee which was served with blood orange segments and the rose hip soup and vanilla ice cream. Both weren't the greatest, and weren't finished, but they're weren't bad, just not what we were expecting taste wise.

Up until now.\nMy husband and I went here on a Sunday evening, after another Swede recommended the place. It's brand new and has only been here a couple of months.\nThe restaurant itself is quite cosy, located in a small hotel close to the City Hall. With the exception of a couple of pictures of Stockholm on the wall, you wouldn't be able to guess its a Scandinavian restaurant from the way it's decorated.\n\nI'd say they're doing a pretty darn good job on getting the Scandinavian flavors right, with only a couple minor flaws. \nThe complimentary bread has a typical caraway flavor, and would probably have been really good had it come straight out of the oven. Unfortunately, ours was quite dry, and I suspect it was Saturday's bread...\nWe decided to share a bunch of dishes, and started with the white asparagus. I'm not a huge asparagus fan, but my husband loves these white ones. The poached egg was just cooked through enough to hold its shape, and mixed wonderfully with the hollandaise sauce.\nThen came the herring, which was one of the highlights of the evening, and very, very far from the stuff you get at Ikea. It came with fresh chives, chopped onions, and sourcream, and for a moment I felt like I had been magically transported to a midsummer feast back in the cold North...\nThe lobster was wonderful. It would have been nice to have had some other bread to mop up the sauce with, as the caraway and spices of the dark bread overpowered the smooth and gentle lobster and caviar flavors.\nThe charkuterie platter was the only thing I wasn't overly impressed with, and my husband agreed. I guess the word I'm looking for is \"meh\". We've got some great game in Sweden, such as reindeer and moose, and this platter would be way more interesting with some of that on it.\nInstead of dessert (neither of us likes sweets), we ended with the smoked salmon, which sent me straight to food heaven. Baby potatoes, dill, and a barely cooked-through but tender salmon that lasted for only a few sweet moments until we had cleaned the plate completely...\n\nWe will definitely come back, and I'm looking forward to trying some of Plaj's meat dishes and the cheese plate...", "author": "Jeanette F."}

Since we've eaten there which was about two years ago, this restaurant has become very popular and on recent stays we haven't been able to get a reservation.  So this time we made reservations well ahead of time and we were joined by friends who live in the area.  We dined early as we had just attended an afternoon concert at Davies Hall.  We were seated promptly and given menus.  The server took our drink orders and returned with three of the four drinks.  She couldn't remember what our friend ordered and had to ask him again, and he replied a MacCallum single malt scotch on the rocks.  Why didn't she write this down?  Three of us were sipping our drinks and it took some time before the scotch arrived.  Meanwhile one of the members of the party tasted her drink which was an Aquavit/citrus mix which she declared \"tasted like perfume and was awful.\"  I tasted her drink and concurred.  The server was informed and said she would be glad to replace it with something else---in this case the choice was a pinot noir.   The meal progressed nicely.  Three of the party ordered the Swedish meatballs and they all cleaned their plates pronouncing them to be delicious!  I had elk cooked medium-rare with chanterelles.  I really enjoyed that as well.  Dessert was apple pie, a princess cake, and a Swedish pancake with berries and Chambord whipped cream(my choice.)  All were delicious.   We had ordered coffee---it never came.  When we were presented with the bill, we reminded the server that we ordered coffee.  She forgot--again!  But we got coffee.  The bill reflected the bad tasting drink and we brought it to her attention.  She corrected that and omitted the drink and was apologetic.

One problem I had was that my fellow diner and I are vegetarian and so ordered off the Hagen menu, which was presented as the vegetable section (Hagen apparently means 'of the garden') but one of our dished was covered in bacon and sitting in a pool of fat. This is perhaps our fault for not knowing what lardon is but for any vegetarian going to this restaurant, beware! Lardon is meat and for some reason on the vegetable section. Otherwise everything else was delicious. Many of the ingredients were Swedish and presumably unknown to most of us unfamiliar with Swedish cuisine so if you have allergies or dietary restrictions be sure to ask about each thing or you may be unpleasantly surprised.", "author": "Jordan R."}

This is one of the most interesting menus in the city.  We sampled broadly from the menu and every dish was delicious.  Standouts were the lobster, salmon, sardines, dumplings, and beet salad.  The room is lovely, and best of all, you can hear each other.  The drawbacks were not with the kitchen, but the management or service.  The hostess was somewhat cold, but did try to accommodate our wish to have drinks before dinner since they could not seat us immediately.  However, we waited 15 minutes in a somewhat cold lobby for the drinks, not long before we were seated. Our waitress did apologize for the delay as they had had a rush of people come at the same time.  It would seem they would have faced this issue before and worked it out by now.  The service was a bit slow and we had to keep asking for bread, but I enjoyed the relaxed pace.  We all would certainly come again.", "author": "Judy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-10-17", "description": "OK. I gave them a second try a month later.  Nothing has changed.  The food is good at best - not very interesting.  I had the ox cheek the first time and this time I had the venison.  A bit... boring.  If I can't get a reservation at any of the other restaurants located in Civic Center I'd go back as a \"last resort\", the food is acceptable.  BUT the service is painfully slow.  Even the bartendar is slow.  30 minutes between courses?  My reservation was a 6pm and I was once again following up with the waitress to get the check so I would not be running full speed to catch my 8pm opera.  We only had appetizers, main course, and coffee - yes, almost 2 hours!  Flagging down the waitress was a challenge.  Even if the restaurant offered me another 20% discount  (my service was so bad the first time they called me and asked me to come back with the lure of 20% off my check, which I used last night).  No, I'd rather pay full price at several of the other great restaurants in the neighborhood.  Also, what's up with all the 5 star ratings.  Something is fishy - is it the gravlax?  I think someone might be paying for reviews... This is NOT a 5 star experience!!!!", "author": "bill l."}

The menu offers  \"hagen\" (veggies and salads, incorrectly translated by our waitress as \"daily\"), \"beta\" (meats but I find no translation from any Scandinavian language), \"fjord\" (fish dishes), and godis (goodies).  The dishes run 12 to $26, most around $15 and quite small.  A few are more normal portions but they are not marked and you must ask.  The two of us ordered four dishes.  That was quite sufficient because they ranged from not very good to so so.  The octopus salad had very small pieces of undercooked octopus with seasoning so overpowering that the little rubbery chunks were unrecognizable.  We received our charcuteri at the same time.  It arrived with half of a very thick slice of toasted dark rye bead which was much needed to dilute the slices of pork belly that were 90% fat.  There were also a few tiny slices of unremarkable sausage.  The best part of the dish was the bread.  Next came the tuna, an array of about six tender nicely cooked 1/2 inch square chunks.   Again the seasoning was so overpowering that the squares could have been mashed potatoes or most anything else.  Finally we were presented with halibut  which was the only dish with a reasonable portion.  The fish was cooked to perfection, tender and flaky. The sauce with cut up veggies was just OK but but not so flavored that we couldn't enjoy the fish.  Based on the first four we opted out of dessert and each had a really expensive espresso.  We had a pleasant bottle of wine which at $40 which was the second cheapest on the menu. Total price with tax and tip was $136.   The restaurant has nice ambiance, friendly waitstaff, but we will not be returning any time soon.", "author": "Ted U."}

Our friend ordered for the table, and we were amazed at the range and array of dishes.  We started with the gravlax, lobster, and halibut, moved on to the Swedish meatballs (definitely not Ikea), ox cheeks, and chicken done two ways, and finished with apple cake, brownie, and creme brulee.  Not being familiar with Scandinavian food, I wasn't sure what to expect, but the food was complex, savory, and the portions just right for sharing.  Everything we had was delicious, but I would definitely recommend the lobster and the chicken, particularly the portion that was wrapped in cabbage leaf.  The desserts were delicious, but not notably Scandinavian.  Of the three we tried, I liked the creme brulee best--the brownie was delicious but not more so than a regular brownie. The creme brulee, by comparison, was light, sublime, and perfect with grapefruit.", "author": "Christine H."}
