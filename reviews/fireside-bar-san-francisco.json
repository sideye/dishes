It's dog friendly. The drinks are cheap. What's not to like? I planned to catch up with an old friend and Fireside proved to the perfect pick. It's got a lively feel to it, but still not too loud or distracting. It's an easy spot for the locals but tourists are welcome too. Grown-up crowd and chill vibes.", "author": "Helina G."}

Stumbled into Fireside Bar on Friday, May 4rd around 12:45am. There were a fair amount of people here, but we still managed to find two seats at the bar.\n\nWe were drinking Jameson at the other spot, so decided to do the same here. Got two pours of Jameson neat. One with a ginger back for my gf and a water for me. The pours here were a good size compared to the last bar. (They served their Jameson in a shot glass.) Not sure how much each drink was, but the total charged on my credit card with tax and tip was $17, so I'm guessing both drinks were $14?\n\nThe atmosphere here was very lively, so we were able to have a conversation with the roommate via video chat. (My gf and him haven't seen each other in forever.) I know, we were that annoying pair talking on our phone the whole time. But no one gave us any sh!t which I appreciated. Everyone was just doing their own thing. Though I'm sure there were some people silently judging us. Good thing the bar was noisy.\n\nFun place to close out Thursday night. It had been a while since I saw my gf, so we had a great time catching up. So glad Fireside allowed us to have one more round before the night ended.", "author": "Elena N."}

The environment is unpretentious, with the bartenders that create this casual yet friendly feeling. Not broverdosed, tech, dive, bousiour, hipster, it is a place of comfort.\n\nI love Lisa (one of the bartender) since unlike other bars with bartenders that are trying to take care of as many orders possible, she is on top of things while being an individual that you can simply talk to and feel like you are not just another person simply ordering a drink. Alas, I do not know the other bartender's name, but he is a no BS individual that makes this establishment great as well. I remember coming here a few hours before my birthday, with my friend trying to argue that it is actually my bday since I was born in the East Coast, he tilted his head back for a moment, then lined up 3 shots for all of us to toast on behalf of my bday.\n\nFor a great and casual time, Fireside is a wonderful bar that is managed by great people.

It's not just the plethora of well-priced eating and drinking establishments but the whole package that comes with it:  it feels like a real community of normal working people going about their lives, consuming food and knocking back a few.  In fact, it feels like the opposite of where the young tech community goes to spend their riches and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nLast time I drank on Irving I learned that the Blackthorn allows dogs in before 7 p.m.  It was after 7 p.m. and my dog needed a drink so I sidled up to inquire whether she could come in and sit on the back patio.  Rules are rules though so the answer was no, prompting my next question:  Do you know anyplace that does allow dogs?\n\nEnter Fireside Bar where dogs are welcome though not atop the bar or tables.\n\nFireside is less of a packed scene than Blackthorn.  It's smaller and a bit trashier.  There is a fireplace but I can't say it was the centerpiece of the place.  That title seemed to be reserved for the big screen displaying the Warriors playoff game 3 and several smaller screens displaying the same.  \n\nIf you watched the game you know that it was one for the ages and it may have contributed to the good feeling I left the Fireside with.  Or that good feeling might've been a result of all the nice regulars I met as a result of having my dog with me.  Then again, perhaps it was the fact that the folks beside me introduced themselves to me, not my dog, and we wound up having a really nice conversation.  All of this and then it was time to go. \n\nThe tab for 1 Guinness, 1 Sierra Nevada, and 2 vodka cocktails was $17.  $17, that was not a typo.  Now you know all you really need to know about Fireside Bar.", "author": "Tracey A."}

We stumble upon this place and I must say, this place is pretty nice! Small and cozy, this bar seems laid back and nice to bring a small group of people. \n\nThey have this fireplace at the center of the bar which is cool because it feels at home, especially with the couches around it. We wanted to talk comfortably so we were in the back. I ordered an old fashioned and she ordered a lemon drop. Both were good and proceeded to take some more drinks. After a shot of tequila with lime, I suggested we should get a scooby snack. The bartender didn't know of the shot and did some \"research\" (aka: Youtube) on it. I was pretty impressed on how spot on he made the drink and my friend loved it. So much so, she asked the bartender for another one and gave him a big tip. \n\nOverall, a great place to take someone out, have a drink, and have a casual conversation.

Showed up around 11 on a Saturday night and was surprised that there were only 10-15 people in the whole bar.  That worked for us because we were with a little group and wanted to be able to talk to each other, and we were able to control the jukebox.  First impressions were decent - nice artwork, candles on the tiny 18\" roundtop tables, cool looking benches, a large projection TV, and reasonably priced beers.\n\nAfter serving us our first round of drinks, the only bartender went outside for a cigarette.  Fifteen minutes later, she was still outside, smoking and making out with some guy who may have also worked there, as he was spraying down tables later in the night.  When she finally came back inside, she went straight to the bathroom for a few minutes until my girlfriend got so fed up she went in after her and finally ushered her back to the bar to serve another round of drinks.  I closed out my tab immediately for fear of her leaving again and my card being stranded.

There is no excuse for that.  If you can't recognize an ID, even if it isn't the new fancy CA one, just the old kind,  you need a serious refresher in what a legal ID looks like.  As someone who works in the Emergency Medicine system, I even have a CHP sticker on there.  No one has ever questioned my ID.  Why? BECAUSE IT'S REAL.\n\nI went in to meet a guy friend for a drink on Friday night, whom she did NOT card, and sit down.  First, she can't work the tap and sprays me with the beer over the tap.  I smile, tell her no problem, I understand, very calm and polite, no reason for her to take offense and give me a hard time.  She then takes 5 minutes to ask me what I'd like, and when I order a jameson neat, cards me.  Okay fine, I think, I look under 30, no big deal.  I used to work as a bartender, I understand the uncertainty.  Next thing I know, the bartender is using the candle to see my id, which, last I checked, doesn't work like a blacklight, and turns to me and tells me loudly that it's a fake, she can't take this, the photo is in the wrong place and grabs it to tear it in half.  Now, I work on an ambulance and need my DL in order to DO MY JOB, and convince her not to tear it only by offering her a look at anything else in my wallet, and all but freaking out.  She still refuses to serve me, giving me attitude the whole time, but thank goodness gives me back my DL.  My friend and I take our business over to a bar down the street where the bartender doesn't even bat an eye.\n\nLook, I understand that the fireside gets a lot of underage drinkers, lord knows everyone knew to go there in high school, but when you can't recognize a real ID just because it isn't the new one that all the transplants are handing you and almost put me out of work until the DMV can give me a new DL?

I had passed by it several times, but hadn't tried it out.\n\nThe place is fairly small, as most neighborhood bars are. On A Saturday night at 11 there was plenty of space to move around and sit. It's has a nice cozy feel to it. Bathroom is nasty, completing the neighborhood bar ambiance. However, they have a digital jukebox playing loud music, and there is no dance floor. This is stupid. The music made it hard to have conversations unless you were right next to the person talking into their ear. They'd be much better off turning the music down or off completely.\n\nMy friend got a Sierra Nevada off the tap from the unfriendly bartender. They did not have Blue Moon on tap. Weak, and points off in my book. \n\nOverall the bar is alright. It's not terribly sketchy, but there are problems with it. I would not go again unless i was meeting people there.", "author": "J C."}

My boyfriend and him instantly hit it off and started trading drink recipes and before you know it our crew had more drinks than I can count! All the drinks were made to perfection and the service was what all bartenders should strive for. So thank you a million times for such a fun night. I can guarantee you we will become regulars! \n\nThe bar itself is clean and cozy and sexy feeling. Great place to take a date I think. The pictures on the page don't do it justice, it's much sexier looking at night. And A+ for not being out of toilet paper at 1am. I love that the bathroom floors are painted black too, makes it feel much cleaner. As far as bar bathrooms go, it was one of the cleanest I've seen for being so late on a Saturday night. \n\nAll in all a definite gem in the inner sunset. Fancy yet casual. Chances are you'll see me here quite often in weekends to come!\n\nUPDATE: Dear Steven.. I love you. You got me wasted last night (again!) and I appreciate that. Your drinks are amazing and creative. If I had enough room in my apartment I'd make you live with me and then I'd be drunk and giggly everyday!\n\nPeople... if you are feeling brave, ask Steven to 'surprise you'.

When it's 80 degrees in the Castro but 60 degrees in the sunset, you have no problems walking into a cozy bar and kicking back with a beer by the fire. Like most of the local joints, there's not much that really stands out about this place, but I love the fact that you can walk across the street, grab some tacos, and walk back in to pair it with your cerveza. I don't know if I just never took advantage of it before or if it's something that you find more in SF, but I love the fact you can bring outside food into a lot of bars. It's really the best of both worlds.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Free chips, free dog treats, a fireplace, Guinness on tap along with a nice Butte Porter, the Chimay and a few more wine selections than the norm.

With an older crowd and no frat rat types in evidence, it's a lot less grating and much more alt/interesting than Yancy's. Also, the N Judah stops right in front, so it's a good place to get a respite from the often brutal Inner Sunset micro-climate. The place is old but doesn't smell and looks clean. I haven't worked up the nerve to try the bathroom yet, I'll let you know. SF could use more dog friendly and unpretentious bars like this one.", "author": "tess s."}
