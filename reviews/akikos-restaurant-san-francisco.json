The chefs, the services, the quality of fish, and the originality of the dishes were superb. This is definitely a place that adds its own special touch, and you get a lot more than just nigiri when doing omakase.\n\nWe came here on a week night with a reservation requesting bar seating. I loved having our own personal sushi chef (shout out to Shin) and being able to constantly give feedback as to what we were in the mood for. A lot of the dishes were something I would have never imagined to order myself, but were also some of the most delicious. The rice of the nigiri was perfectly seasoned and none of the pieces were overwhelmingly wasabi-y where I could no longer taste the fish.\n\nI definitely recommend to everyone who wants an amazing sushi night in SF to come to Akiko's. I would also lend a word of warning that we spent  a LOT more than we thought, so definitely give the staff a heads up regarding how much you're want to spend (for Omakase). Overall, I really have no complaints because everything was so delicious and service was amazing.\n\nI would love to return for another go.", "author": "Arezou A."}

Open the menu and immediately I was like hhhmmm this might be something both of us might have to pay for tonight if we are indulging. \n\nAnd let me tell you we did! This place is not for your average joe to come and order 6-8 rolls of sushi and get away with a $70- $100 bill. No my friend you are getting seasonal fish that are artistically hand crafted and cut. And it was out of this world! If you're not too big on your fish knowledge, let you server make the suggestions cause they do it well. \n\nWe ordered doubles of a few sashimis and beers and two rolls and the bill was close to about $200 which we expected so not mad. \n\nFavorites: ji-kinmedai (smoked snapper), nama sake (salmon), tennen sawara (mackerel) and the yazu (yellowtail) \n\nI'm hoping to bring my dad back next year for his b'day to explore their summer menu.", "author": "Ankita C."}

There was a couple ahead of me getting seated. When she returned I told her it was just me and asked if I could sit at the bar (there are about 8 seats). Two seats were open but it looked like they were reserved. She told me it would be a little bit. Maybe it's just me, but she didn't smile and wasn't pleasant. I think that's 90% of your job as a hostess - make your customer feel good about dropping $$$$ on small pieces of raw fish. \n\nIt took about 10 minutes for me to get seated. When I sat down I noticed not just one but both of my chopsticks were crooked. The sushi chef noticed I was playing with them and asked if I wanted another pair but I told him I'd just ask the waitress when she came. When she got to me, I mentioned this to her and instead of just getting me another pair, she told me I was probably mistaken because their chopsticks twirled at the base (the irony of an Asian being questioned, by another Asian, about his familiarity with chopsticks doesn't escape me). She stood there and stared at me for a few seconds so I stood the chopsticks up and showed her that the tips of chopsticks shouldn't touch and form a wishbone shape at the base...\n\nThings sailed smoothly after that. I ordered some sashimi from the chef and he was nice and polite. The fish came out in good time and it was tasted as good as it looked. \n\nA beer ($9) and the sashimi ($39) after tax and tip ended up being $62!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-04", "description": "I've been to Akiko's several times and my last trip there merits a review. My wife and I went for our anniversary and had a gift card there that really allowed us to explore the menu and try a lot of different dishes and Akiko's did not disappoint. \n\nThe restaurant is small with probably around 20 tables and it can be cramped. We ended up sitting next to two couples who were much rowdier and noisy than the rest of the crowd, but it didn't dampen the experience too much. However, don't expect to have a ton of space or fancy decor, it's pretty barebones when it comes to that. \n\nWe were presented with a menu of both regular dishes and the fresh nigiri flown in from Japan. We focused on the latter and ordered a variety of nigiri dishes, as well as the grilled black cod. Let me just say: order the black cod. The flavor is complex but consistent and the texture is fantastic and the fish melts in your mouth. The dish is served very simply without sides, but the seasoning and the sauce really accentuate the flavors.\n\nOnto the nigiri. We tried both the ensui \"unprocessed\" uni, which came in a little spoon without rice and the more traditional uni \"nigiri\" with rice and seaweed. Both were excellent and my wife preferred the unprocessed uni for pure uni flavor, while I preferred the nigiri for a more balanced uni flavor with the rice and seaweed. It was a good problem to have as both were fantastic.\n\nThe fish in the other nigiri we ordered was stellar and came preseasoned (no dipping in soy sauce here)...the salmon (sake) and the toro (tuna) both stood out as being perfectly seasoned and flavored while having a wonderful texture. \n\nOverall, a fantastic culinary experience. For what Akiko's lacks in frills, it more than makes up for in high quality, well seasoned, and delicious fish. Certainly a great place for a special occasion to try something special.", "author": "Marat M."}

I should have gotten nigiri so that rice would have accentuated it. \n\n4/5 Murasaki uni @ $12.50 a piece. It was great sea urchin, but it did not blow me away. Perhaps I expected too much. \n\n4.5/5 Wagyu with truffle slices @ $12.50. To be honest, this was my first time eating truffle. Although I've always liked truffle flavored things like fries, pasta, etc, but never tried the real thing. Thus, I had to taste the truffle by itself first. Not what I had expected - much more subtle in flavor. Then I downed the whole wagyu nigiri with delight.\n\n4/5 Ankimo nigiri (Monk Fish foie) @ $6.50. Nice smooth flavor, but think the seaweed and bonito fish flavor overpowered it.\n\nThis was a nice restaurant with good service, ambiance and great tasting food.

This place in particular (like most higher end sushi places) puts a high emphasis on the presentation so there is a certain precision/art to it that you don't see at your average run of the mill sushi joint.\n\nBack to the option I settled on...I didn't get the Chef's Omakase because on this day I didn't feel like spending a ton of sashimi so I settled on their 12 piece \"Sashimi Moriawase\" for $39 before tax.  \n\nDid I like the Sashimi?

He encouraged us to order a few items at a time.  He then checked in to see if we wanted more.  There was zero pressure to keep ordering.\n\nI took pics of most of the items we ordered.  I don't remember the names of each fish.  Sushi purists are going to hate me, but my favorite dish was the salmon roll.  I found it delectable.  My second favorite was a cherry fish from Japan and the butterfish.  My husband like everything we ordered.  The pacing of our dishes was excellent.\n\nOur meal came out to be about $250 with 1 glass of unfiltered sake and no dessert. \n\nNote:  They allow children, but this is not a family restaurant.  One of the sushi restaurants we first tried to eat at did not allow kids, so I hope this helps parents.  My son was very pleased with his bowl of rice and edamame.  Akiko's is NOT a place for kids that cannot sit still and might knock over plates because all the stoneware seemed very pricey.", "author": "Kat M."}

We finished with a few individual pieces of nigiri that we either saw other diners eating or the sushi chef recommended to us & these ended up being some of the best bites. Our absolute favorites were the Sake (king salmon & part of the sampler), Hotate (scallop) and Shiro Toro (white tuna belly). \n\nThey have a wide array of sake and our server was able to provide us with great recommendations for each my husband and my own different preferences. \n\nIt was worth it in our opinion, but still not cheap.

About five minutes later she said they were running behind and we should come back in about 45 minutes. I was annoyed and hungry at this point plus we had a flight that we needed to catch in less than 8 hours so we wanted to sleep. We ended up walking around town and coming back 45 minutes later. She greeted us again and informed us a table directly in front of us would be ready shortly. It was cleared, reset and she grabbed menus and was about to walk over to it when two men walked in. She happily greeted them both by name, leaned over to me and apologized saying they requested this specific table so she had to give it to them, then told us to go back to waiting. Overall we waited nearly an hour and twenty minutes. It was horrible. I'm super easy going but this was pushing my limits. \n\nThey ended up finally seating us in the back of the restaurant and gave us the menu - we noticed they had several different types of uni, including a few overnighted directly from Japan.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "Akiko's was probably one of the biggest let downs of 2017 for me. The quality, cut, size, flavor profile and options were not reflective of the high price point. The chefs who came from Sushi Ran and Ota are long gone and it seems the quality and consistency left with them. \n\nFirst of all, this is not a true Omakase style and everything is \u00e0 la carte. It's a good concept as you can choose what you want but the problem is, what you are choosing between isn't worth it. \n\nThe prices are similar to others such as Kusakabe and Omakase ($15 uni, $12 Toro, etc.) so you can easily end up with a $200 per person bill without trying too hard. The issue? The flavor profile, complexity and options are not even remotely close. Not even in the same universe. Mentioning them in the same sentence is offensive.  \n\nThe rice was subpar; that's nigiri 101 basics. If the base is not on point, it ruins everything. The cuts were inconsistent with some pieces being too small, others too large, some too thin, others too fat. The seasoning was off, often lacking saltiness and failing to bring the full flavor out of the fish. The sauces and wasabi underneath were often inconsistent, either leaving the piece too bland or just completely overpowering the fish and actually taking away from the experience. It just lacked the sophistication and masterful preparation one has come to expect at the price point. Nigiri is more than just slapping on high quality grade fish on top of rice. You can tell they don't source their fish from the same places either; they clearly don't get top grade. \n\nAdditionally, for \u00e0 la carte, the options were quite limited. They didn't have many bluefin tuna cuts, no wagyu, and nothing quite interesting. It's good that they had Russian uni but they only had one type of Hakkaido uni (and it wasn't as good as others I've had so probably wasn't as fresh). I even saw that they sometimes run out of Toro... I can go get my usual salmon and tuna cuts elsewhere without paying $10-20 a piece. Give us options!\n\nThe actual place was nice but service was subpar and slow. One would expect better. The person in charge of tea was the only one on point. \n\nAnyone that tells you Akiko's is the best sushi they've ever had either hasn't gone there in years, or worse - has no idea what they are talking about and has had their taste buds thoroughly burned right before they ate. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but at that price point, it does not deliver the complexity in flavor, sophistication and consistency one should expect.\n\nFor half the price it would be solid run of the mill 4/4.5 sushi joint; as it stands - the mediocre service, inconsistent quality, lack of choice, and simplistic flavors make it an easy pass! Plenty of better choices in the city!", "author": "Mario B."}

I don't mind if the waitstaff is overly polite but not the most friendly, but there were way too many instances (perks of watching them interact with customers who wanted to walk in) of downright impoliteness. I get that it's a super popular restaurant, and thus hard to accommodate walk-ins given limited seating, but put a sign on the door or be more gracious when turning people away-- word spreads.\n\nWe got the wagyu nigiri (miyazaki) with truffle, nama uni (hokkaido), gyu (beef), and ika (tempura monterey squid). I was under the impression that the squid would come out first, since we had indicated that was an appetizer, but they brought out the order as nigiri to beef to squid. Not a problem normally, but was expecting more professional service at a high end spot. \n\nThe wagyu nigiri (+$5 for shaved truffle) was beautiful to look at, with a buttery beef taste (not from fat you could see, but from the well distributed marbling). Emphasis on buttery beef. I think they must have torched the bottom of the piece, as the cooked taste of beef did come through, even though the top portion I saw was red. Very little sinew as I chewed through. The truffle complimented the taste of the meat, but on its own, it reminded me of vegetarian / grass, which is in line with other truffle I've had. Good meat to rice ratio, but the piece certainly could have been ~30% larger. 4/5 on taste, 3/5 on value.\n\nThe nama uni (they were kind to explain the differences between the four different types of uni they had that evening)-- and I settled on the processed one (meaning there is salt added) because it makes the texture of the flesh sweeter. Certainly very fresh (unfresh uni is really bad), creamy, and sweet, though I wasn't in love. Same comment as the wagyu on size. 3.75/4 on taste, 3/5 on value.\n\nThe gyu was nicely presented, with the meat on one slab, and an assortment of veggies in small interconnected bowls. The meat itself was very tender, little sinew, and had that beefy taste I look for in beef. The last piece in the bunch was quite sinewy though, and not in a good way. The veggies all had very distinct flavors that were a good contrast to the beef. The brussel sprouts were in a vinegary sauce and lightly crisped. The kimchi wasn't spicy at all, but very crisp vacuoles. The pea sprouts were refreshing and also had crispy vacuoles. The only thing about pea sprouts is that if you're actually at a high end (Chinese) spot, they remove the stems since those parts are a bit older than the young leaves. Nice garlic flavor on these though. The soy marinade accompanying this was very...I'm not sure how describe it, but it reminded me of sauces I've had in Japan, in a good way. A bit overpowering for the delicate taste of the steak though. 4/5 on taste, 3.75/5 on fancy restaurant value.\n\nAlmost forgot about the squid! This was my least favorite dish. While it looked beautiful, the delicate taste of squid was completely drowned out by the unidentified sauce they put on it-- the little dollops of mayo (no particular flavor) were no match for the sauce. The sauce reminded me of a pork sauce for spareribs at a Chinese place close to home, which isn't bad, but didn't match what I envisioned squid to be. The squid itself was tough, the breading was a bit hard, and...yeah, I'd pass on this. 3/5, thought it was one of the larger portion sizes.\n\nThey were a bit pushy for us to order more (do you need to see the menu, do you want dessert)-- a quick glance of Yelp reviews suggests that most tables of 2 spend ~$200. While the dessert did sound enticing (yuzu and sesame ice creams), we had a cake waiting for us. The seat right next to the door (literally less than 2 feet) made it quite chilly as well.

When you tell the sushi chef omakase, you will tell them your likes and dislikes and they will start providing you with different dishes until you're full. I can definitely see and taste the freshness of the fish. Each fish was prepared very prettily, but inconsistent with the seasoning. Mostly, it was lacking salt, so each fish's taste wasn't as highlighted. Each slice wasn't as precise as other places either. Some pieces were thinner and some were thicker. For dessert, they gave us complementary ice-cream, coconut and Thai green curry. The coconut ice-cream was amazing. Full of fresh coconut flavors and not too sweet. The Thai green curry was interesting, slightly salty and sweet. I couldn't get any curry flavors, probably because it was too cold. \n\nOverall high points for freshness, but because of the lack of appropriate amount of seasoning, it lacked flavor.

Look for the sign that says Irish pub (weird), and then you are there.\n-pricey for what it is\n-I had an unfortunate wasabi situation\n\nNote to all, they serve you soy sauce and wasabi\nEven though their nigiri is fully dressed already (comes with soy sauce and wasabi already in it). Problem is I hate wasabi, ruins the sushi for me. High end sushi bars usually already add wasabi to the nigiri, and this is my fault, but I didn't associate this place with those authentic sushi places for some reason. Thus, I didn't ask for them to remove the wasabi because I didn't think it would be fully dressed. Sushi came, I had to remove all the wasabi from each piece of sushi before consuming. Sad. Really ruins the enjoyment as construction by a lot.", "author": "Cynthia X."}

Even though this place isn't reservation-exclusive, you can't get in on a normal day without calling a few weeks in advance. That's because many people have high regard for Akiko's. This place is known for providing a modern and artistic take to traditional sushi. It's even been mentioned on food ranking lists such as Bay Area 7x7's 100 things to eat in SF! \n\nWith such hype, my girlfriend and I decided to come for our anniversary since this place was one of the few \"good\" sushi joints in the city that took reservations. To give you a sense of how early you need to call in, I contacted them 2-3 weeks before our planned date (a Saturday dinner in August) and only two options were left: 5:30pm when they open and 8:30pm. So RESERVE EARLY! \n\nAkiko's Restaurant is located on 431 Bush Street right outside Chinatown. This place is NOT to be confused with Akiko's Sushi Bar. Parking can be horrendous, and so I recommend public transportation. Else, be prepared to pay for parking if you come before 6pm. Now, the restaurant is right in the middle between Kearny and Grant. You won't see a sign outside (because sign=too many people) and so you'll have to count the numbers. Basically, it's next to the Irish Pub.\n\nRight when we arrived, we experienced the first sensory experience: Ambiance. One of the best features about this restaurant and why so many people pay $$$ to eat here is because it's intimate HEAVEN. The place is TINY, and so it will never get too loud. The place is split into one area with the sushi counter, one dimly-lit back area with 4-5 tables, and two tables up front near the window (where it's brighter). We ended up getting seated at the front. I love the fact that here at Akiko's, you can really get that sense of privacy with your friend/significant other. With low noise, check off sound (or lack thereof) as a sensory experience too! \n\nIn terms of the menu, Akiko's prides itself in quality over quantity. They have 9 different appetizers (I heard soft-shelled crab good), 4 different grilled items. The most important one is the Saba (Mackerel), which is apparently a \"must eat.\" Next, they only have like 6 rolls, since this place is mostly about the fresh sushi/fish from the bar. And in terms of fresh fish, they have A LOT (they also have a rotating menu based on seasonal catch too). And if you want drinks, they have a separate HUGE menu too. We ended up getting the 12 piece sashimi moriwase to sample their fish, the negi toro and sake rolls, and the Saba.\n\n-Sashimi Moriwase (9/10). Aesthetics as the third sensory experience? Major check! As you probably already saw from Yelp, Akiko's is Instagram heaven. Their plating is SO beautiful. We first noticed this with the sashimi sampler. The fish looked amazingly fresh, and I love how their plates were 1. perfectly sized and 2. high-quality. In terms of taste, man was their fish so soft and clean! You know how at some sushi restaurants you need some wasabi to get rid of extra bacteria? Here, just shove it straight in your mouth because it's THAT PERFECT. I wouldn't say this was the best sashimi I've had, but dang it was delicious. $35 was a bit too high, but that salmon was especially... And knock off another sensory experience for touch because the sashimi was so soft!\n\n-Negi Toro/Sake (8/10). Both rolls (x5 each) had really fresh fish inside (tuna belly omfg+delicious salmon), but I'd avoid rolls if you are here; the experience really is with the sashimi/nigiri and it'd be a waste if you spend your $$ on seaweed and daikon/avocado filling. But, if you want cheaper alternatives, rolls are fine...\n\n-Saba (10/10). There is a reason why people rave so much about the mackerel. This dish is truly both a taste+smell sensory experience for the ages. First off, the fish gives off such an aromatic \"grilled\" flavor that begs for it to be eaten. Second, the combination of soy sauce, lemon, and daikon provide the fish with the perfect blend of salty and sour. But best part was the fish was SO JUICY. GET THIS PLEASE.\n\nWould I say Akiko's is the BEST sushi restaurant in the city? No, because you will be paying $$$ (we spent $110) for great quality fish, but nothing \"out of this world.\" People come here more for the experience, and that's what I'd rate Akiko's highly for. If you want an intimate  adventure that teases your senses, Akiko's is for you. Otherwise, I recommend spending the same amount on another place such as Tataki because you'd probably get more bang for your buck. But all in all, I give Akiko's a \"nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy.\" Don't forget to use the nice bathroom!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-02", "description": "**Summary: Rushed service, unclear ordering, sticker shock for good quality omakase **\n\nI came back recently on a Saturday night and was disappointed with how Akiko's has changed since my last visit four years ago.\n\n-Ordering: Other reviews have mentioned the \"eat until you're full\" philosophy at Akiko's and I understand that's how it is done in Japan. What I felt was missing was the waitress trying to gauge how hungry we were. Without asking, our waitress seemed to expect us to each have 15-18 dishes. My sister and I, who only ate 11 pieces, risked either 1)missing the best end pieces (Wagyu, Toro) or 2)overeating.\n\n-Atmosphere: The restaurant felt crowded, with people standing at the doors and outside. That unfortunately translated to a rushed feeling from the staff. From ordering to dish pacing to the waitress describing the dishes, I felt as if the staff was trying to turn the table as quickly as possible. Our 15 dishes were done in around an hour and 20 minutes, with the bill coming quickly after the last dishes were cleared and without any dessert menu. That's not quite the experience I expect for $200/person.\n\n-Food: Quality of the food was good, but not outstanding. The chutoro and wagyu w/truffle were standouts.\n\n-Value: My bill came out to around $200/person for around 12 dishes, without any alcohol. I spent $225 here 5 years ago for a 15 piece sushi omakase plus a nice bottle of sake, so diminished value for diminished quality. The \"eat until you're full\" style at market price also contributed to the sticker shock, so either come one an expense account or be prepared to pony up!\n\nThere are plenty of omakases in SF/Bay Area that offer as good or better quality food and atmosphere for the price.", "author": "Louis Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-22", "description": "Maybe 1 star is a bit too harsh. But in my rating system 1 star means I will never re-visit this place. So I had to give 1 star. But let me be fair, it was not that bad. I wouldn't be surprised if they lose costumers and close soon.\n\nPros:\n-the front part of the restaurant looks really nice. \n-if you have reservation you can enjoy your dinner.\n-fish was fresh and tasted good. \n\nCons:\n-pricy for the taste. Sushi was not outstanding, melting in your mouth kind. Especially with the mushy rice it was pretty below average.\n-the back of the restaurant looks like a basement of a psycho kidnapper. If you're claustrophobic make sure you reserve a table from the front side, or sit at the bar. Back is nightmare-land. Whoever picked that decor must be blind or has no taste. \n-they prepare sushi with brown rice. In my experience this has never been the case. Some restaurants would have the brown rice option but they would ask out of respect. This one prepared everything with brown rice without asking or double checking. Weird.\n-Rice was mushy and pasty and too warm almost hot, that made the sushi experience really bad.\n-Space is too tiny, the tables are too tiny, and there are too many of them placed way too close to each other, very uncomfortable environment.\n-Service was horrible. Especially the lady with tattoos, I am not sure if she is racist or just rude by nature but I've never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant. \n\nGoing into more detail about that last part. This lady made us feel unwanted there. And she's the main reason we will never visit this place again. She acted like she was doing us a favor by getting us a table, when half the restaurant was empty. She did not smile. Did not make eye contact. Had a selfrighteous attitude. She said she can get us a table but we have to leave in an hour cause we don't have a reservation with a bossy tone. We said \"sure\" then she said \"then follow me\", and we said \"thank you\" she didn't respond. Then we came to our table, while sitting, we said again \"thank you\" she said nothing, instead put the silverware like throwing on the table, with a frowning face. My husband again said thank you one last time, loudly, looking at her face. She completely ignored and left. We ended up ordering only a few pieces of nigiri and left. I actually wish we left without ordering anything. It was a horrible experience. \n\nWhen ordering we saw the table right next to us had handrolls brought to them, and we couldn't see it on the menu, so i asked. They said it was a special case for that table. Another discrimination! When I asked why can't we get any, they paused for a while but couldn't come up with a smart explanation so said okay with a big frown in their face and left.\n\nI want to assume she was not racist, which kind of makes it worse, cause that means you'll all get the same treatment. She doesn't like costumers, she doesn't like her job, she doesn't like her life, she's not welcoming, she's self righteous, and god knows why she's the front face of this restaurant. Some person who does not understand how to work with costumers thought it would be a good idea to put a snobby, bossy, rude woman at front desk to welcome costumers. But after reading the reviews of the owner saying \"you're not welcome here\" to costumers, I'm not surprised how she's so rude. Monkey see monkey do.\n\nIf you don't mind being treated horribly and feeling unwelcome, and if you like mediocre sushi with warm brown rice, and you don't mind eating in a non-ventilated humid basement like tiny space, and pay a lot of money, I do recommend trying this place. But if these kind of things matters to you, while spending so much money on sushi, you might as well find a place that treats you like a valued costumer and make you feel welcome. \n\nOverall I do not recommend this place. The service and food is NOT worth the money.", "author": "Selen A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-29", "description": "Akiko's is the first and only restaurant where some of the highest quality sushi I've ever had in my life was met with some of the most depressing service I've ever experienced. This is a landmark where their sushi chefs are as talented as the best I've ever known and where you're treated to an experience that spits you out worse off than you came in. Was it a matter of demographic prejudice? Why would I write this review if I hadn't thought otherwise. \n\nI found that good restaurants strive for consistency -- that everything their servers, chefs, and sushi chefs are proud of rests on their ability to deliver an experience like their motto. Their motto struck me as: \"quality, attention, uniqueness\". However it's an utterly bitter truth that their good side rests solely on the demographic they are trying to serve: The businessmen/women of San Francisco whose $80 lunch check is a drop in the bucket to their otherwise astronomical monthly apartment rental and salary. The ugly becomes apparent when you walk in without a reservation, in clothes that don't command a sense of formality -- the common man's presence.\n\n- They don't welcome you, your first experience is intimidating. You're an outsider stepping into their house: \"come in and pay if we must have you\" the first mood rang.\n\n- They will make a scene in front of other customers if they need to move you. A custom of curtesy felt handled more like being prioritized behind the first class -- those who reserved ahead of time. You will feel the entire restaurant look towards you like it was your fault.\n\n- They will forget some of your order, and charge you for it. Simple mistake done with little repercussions.\n\n- They will make you wait 15 minutes for your check after you've finish your last bite. This took four attempts, once from me, twice from two different sushi chefs who knew how long it had been, and one more from me.\n\n- They will forget you if you're not a person of interest. I'd ask if you do decide to go that you dress up to attire, even if you start feeling a little pretentious and entitled. This will be a magnet of attraction to them and I promise you'll get better service. \n\n-$50 was spent for this lunch. I don't know anyone who could afford that price range and didn't feel sensitive to being marginalized by economic status. \n\nAkiko's felt more like a new age San Francisco restaurant than it did a Japanese restaurant. They follow a culture of serving those they seem fit to be served. If you've ever felt ignored, like a kid eating alone in a cafeteria, or a college student suffering from depression, it'll just be a reminder of that painful experience. If you're upper class and you're not worried about siphoning money into an experience similar to a nightclub bottle service, the sushi was incredible and the meal itself was pure. Money will be their undoing -- it is their true motto behind a remarkably aesthetic facade. \n\nAnd if this review does anything to your restaurant, it's to say that common people still have a voice, even if we can't express it through our status.", "author": "Clark F."}

She was simply ecstatic & proceeded to deliver the liquids down our bodies, we started upon more of the flesh in the mouth extravaganzas.\n\nWe ordered the hamach, salmon, yellowtail, tamago, unagi, anago, sweet shrimp with the busted nut head charred & slightly molested in the deep fried man goop, the spoon full of Mary's poppins' it in your mouth hole crab, & we topped the whole orgy flesh fisted delight in our mouths with what is dubbed by our non samurai, un-miyagi like unborn from the rising sun chef as the uni sex change converter....Fun times, the flesh fish was slightly a finer mix than you might find at your local Vons, but here, our imitation ronin, delivered random flesh fish cumming seared, & coated in man juices, and other unpleasantries that ruined the experience of getting the flesh raw, deep, unfiltered, uncut, penetrating your flesh filled throat hole. We prefer to have the penetrations as raw & as direct as possible & having these trinkets & tinkles on our manhood man flesh fish slices was not to our desires, & simply left us pining for our return to our homelands to get the raw penetration in our mouths & tongues that we were lusting after prior to our reservation arrivals.  To our dismays we were among friends whose motto is pride keeps it in the mouth, & gives me the courage to swallow, we were not converted to these slightly infested imperfected flesh fish penetrations in our mouths...sure we still got that hint of the sea breeze, musty wind between the legs goodness that we were cat calling for, but we just did not get the full reach around experience that we had longed for all week & for the remainder of our night.\nLastly, we wrapped up with some fun, as we deep throated the final bottles of serum syrups to get completely blitzed out of our minds, we chose to select the man made creams of the ice scoops to help massage & numb our throats from all of the raw crusted, adulterated, seared, smoked, flesh fish meats that had left our throats, lips, tongues, & cheeks sore for the night. The butter, pale white sesame, creams oozed in our mouths as we came to ecstasy, dripping, leaking down our lips and exposed bodily parts....maybe it was because this setup had been prepared by our friends from the rising sun, that it tasted so good in our mouths and throats, their dances of delight, prayers, to the mighty Buddha himself created the creams in the cups, it was simply a treat of satisfaction in our mouths, like a big fat cow rolling around in the countryside after it has been pampered & ready for a slow unpainful wagyu creating death for consumption by only the wealthiest of the wealthy to stomach & throat with butter down their lard filled esophaguses. \nSure this isn't the best place to get sushi in the land of the golden suns californications but that doesn't mean you should not take a gander, get completely blitzed out of your skull,throat all of these flesh fish meats drizzled n jizzled with whatever nonsense they may put on it, one can still cum to ecstasy, blow a minds & weeks load from the sheer mass of the meats & raw flesh.", "author": "Jonathan S."}

The service was professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. We both had the 12 piece omakase with a side of Hokkaido Uni. The Omakase was super fresh - daresay the freshest I've had in the city. Favorites include the sea bream and of course, the salmon. Fresh, real wasabi is a plus. Uni is something I've never liked, but our server taught us how Hokkaido Uni is different from what we usually have, and it was so so good. No regrets. Coming back soon", "author": "Caroline N."}

Warning: It's tough to find this place because there is no sign out front. \n\nThe interior decor was beautiful and we were seated right away since we had a reservation. The restaurant is very small, and I had been turned away the last time I was in SFO because I tried walking in, so I knew a reservation was a must. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered omakase and sake based on waitress recommendations. I am always suspicious when the recommendation is the most expensive sake on the menu, so when she recommended exactly that sake, I was a little annoyed. For the rest of the meal, I felt like we were treated as less important or less intelligent diners because we were young. The staff was not as friendly to us as they were to the people around us, and the offerings seemed very bland. Overall, I've gotten much better sushi in Austin for half the price of this sushi dinner. If I'm going to pay that much, I don't want to feel like I'm an inferior customer based on my treatment. I'd rather pay slightly more and eat at Otoko in Austin or else pay less and eat at Uchiko in Austin. I never thought the seafood would taste better in a landlocked city than in SFO, but that was definitely my experience. Though, I will say I ate at Elephant Sushi in SFO last time, and it was amazing!\n\nOverall, I was incredibly underwhelmed and dissatisfied with this dining experience.", "author": "Lauren B."}

Now, we expected it to be expensive, however we expected at least good customer service, high quality food, and attentiveness from the server for that price, especially since we were still hungry when we left.\n\nMy boyfriend and I try to go to SF for sushi once a month as a date night (our favorite is a place called Domo, however they don't take reservations and can get busy since it's a small place) so we decided to try somewhere new to avoid a wait.\n\nWe found Akiko's and used maps to get us there (we were walking). It said it was a 5 minute walk but ended up taking almost 30 because we walked past it 4 TIMES. This is because THEY DO NOT HAVE A SIGN IN FRONT - instead there's a sign for the Irish pub that's behind it out front, so we overlooked it many times. Finally, we figured it out when we saw some other people go in and noticed a sushi bar inside - if they hadn't opened the doors we probably wouldn't have found it.\n\nWhen we went inside it took several minutes for a hostess to even acknowledge us - when she did she told us that we would only be able to able to eat for 45 minutes to an hour because they had another party coming and we agreed. \n\nWe were seated and were surprised by the limited number of rolls - it was mostly sashimi which we love, however the prices were extremely high. We thought it'd come with 2 pieces but it came with only one, so we paid $15 for once piece of fish.\n\nFor 2 rolls and 4 pieces of sushi it ended up being $85 (we only ordered water and I had a miso as well). The waitress only came to check in on our table to leave the check (it's a very small restaurant and she checked on other tables much more often). When we asked her questions about the fish, she was very unknowledgeable and couldn't even tell us what cut of Toro the fish was.\n\nWhen it came time to pay my boyfriend gave his card and she came back to say it had been declined. She asked for another card and he said it was fine, he had cash. Her response was \"Good\" in a very snooty manner. When he checked his wallet he realized he only had $70, but he knew he had plenty of money in his account (we checked his bank app) and asked her to run it again. She said she had already tried it three times and in his bank account it SHOWED that it had gone through and then been returned 3 times. Her response was, \"We haven't had issues with any other cards tonight so it must be a problem with your funds.\" \n\nWe asked to talk to the manager and my boyfriend said he could go to the ATM and I could wait there. The manager said \"Well, I'll just take the cash you have.\" We were relived that someone was finally being nice to us until he said, \"That way I know you aren't just going to leave.\" \n\nWe were treated like crap and disrespected all night, and additionally there was no other party coming for our table - they just wanted us out of there for better spenders. \n\nOverall, the fish was pretty good, but definitely not worth what we spent. I could've eaten a lot more and been a lot happier somewhere else for half the price. The fish didn't taste as fresh as I expected and one of our rolls was overly salty. This place would not be memorable at all had they not been so rude. \n\nHuge let down and a waste of money.", "author": "Haley A."}

However, when we got to the front door they told us that our party was too large (we were a group of 5) which is understandable, but the woman who informed us was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered. She was just ridiculously unhelpful and condescending. She went into a long,  nonsensical explanation on what was wrong with our party and their policy and it was just unnecessary. She didn't even say sorry. She was just a (excuse my language, but the word describes her perfectly) bitch about the whole thing.

But in terms of the sashimi and nigiri--not sure if it was just a bad night or what--the quality was underwhelming. \n\nWe had two seats at the bar--I loved hearing the kitchen conversations and conversing with the sushi master! Again, 5-stars for the atmosphere. :)\n\nFor drinks, weordered a bottle of Ginjo sake (Dewazakura Dewasansan)--which I highly recommend others to order if you're looking for a smooth and bright sake. :)\n\nFor our meal, we started off with the sashimi moriawase--6 different types of sashimi (2pcs each). Nothing very memorable or impeccable--is it bad that I can't remember the fishes we were served? Yes.\n\nWe then had the omakase--again, nothing very memorable or special. There was a tare-tare + caviar + nori chip, which was an interesting concept and we were intrigued to try it! However, while it sounded and looked like a promising course, the flavor was blah and there was really no texture contrast. The tare-tare and caviar basically mushed together (and not in a good way), while the nori chip didn't provide much added crunch or flavor. :( Maybe my taste buds are defective.\n\nSigh, bummed that this experience was so much different than the first time I came to Akiko's a few years back!

That remains to be seen, but for the lunch and dinner times I've been here I have yet to be disappointed. A reservation is definitely needed for dinner, but lunch is more flexible, although I would make a reservation anyway. I know it's not typically done this way - but in the instances I have been here for omakase - our group had elected to sit at a table instead of the bar (you can request one or the other when you make your reservation), but on every occasion I have left utterly satisfied with my meal and the service. \n\nThe place is not the easiest place to find - I have gotten lost twice thus far coming here - once because there is a similar restaurant called Akira's that is also on Bush and one small typo can result in a 20 minute walk through hilly SF blocks, potentially in the rain, and another because my GPS actually put Akiko's at another location 4 blocks away (why google?! why!). Hopefully neither of those instances will happen to you and you'll be able to find it without a hitch, despite the Irish bar and Guiness signs pretty much right where the restaurant is cleverly cloaking a superb japanese restaurant. \n\nAll in all - if you do decide to come and try the food - I recommend you to go with the omakase because it's fantastic every time. It may put a dent in your wallet, but it will be worthwhile. It really does not disappoint - all the fish are fresh and delicious, flavored intelligently and purposefully, and when the servers recommend sake to you - they know what they are talking about. The sake that I have been recommended has been light and delicious - combining amazingly with the fish the chef prepares. Some of my favorite items here are the blue fin tuna, barracuda, and uni.

We sat in the sushi bar and was ready to enjoy our meal until the sushi chef's attitude made us change our minds.

He wasn't friendly, didn't treat us with respect, pretty much seemed like he didn't wanna be there. He had no smile and he looked at us like we were dead. I don't think he's fully japanese or had any japanese decent in him. Anyways horrible attitude with customers. We sat right in front of the bar where we could see every move the chef makes. In the middle of our meal we saw him started making sushi for himself and ate it! He kept making pieces of sushi and going into the main kitchen to eat them thinking no one will probably see him! Ridiculous! We ordered a few pieces of uni sushi and as he was making our pieces he took some uni and put it on his hand and ate it! Very sneaky! He did this a few times that night!

Very unfortunate, because the WAITRESSES WERE REALLY NICE, BUT THE HOSTS HAVE HORRIBLE ATTITUDE, COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. \n\nOn the food side, presentation and quality are nice but not outstanding compared to other well known restaurants in the city.

Unfortunately we were a bit delayed, but the restaurant accommodated us and pushed our restaurant reservation to 8pm when our whole party didn't arrive at 7:30. Restaurant is decently sized for a Japanese restaurant -  there is bar seating at the front and maybe 6-8 tables in the back area.\n\nThey had both a regular menu as well as a special menu for the day - lots of options. We wanted to get the omakase, but the ordering for it was a bit more complicated than we would have wanted. The price of the omakase is all to the chef's discretion depending on what they decide to serve you. Also, you could request certain fish to be included if you want to, and the chef would prorate it to the amount of people at your table/the number of people who want to participate. We decided to opt out and just order everything that we wanted. \n\nSome highlights included the uni (very good portion), albacore, halibut, and the toro. Some things I would skip on next time would be the rolls - only about 5 pieces each, but the negi toro roll (tuna belly) was pretty good. \n\nTo much of our disappointment, the dessert options were slim pickings. They didn't have a menu and only said they had 3 options for mochi icecream, so we left our dessert stomachs for another place. Another downside was that service was not the best. Had to flag down the waiters and waitresses to put in extra orders and to get our check.", "author": "Megan K."}

It didn't matter what time of day I tried, lunch or dinner. I happened to be walking by one day and they said they could get me in 30 minutes later, woo hoo!  It ended up being an hour but I was committed by then anyway. \n\nIt's a pretty small place, maybe 30 seats including the sushi bar. The service was really good. They were around when I needed them and didn't stop by too often. The table next to me was full of sushi novices but they were treated like regulars. Sometimes challenging to do. I liked the look and feel of the place. Japanese style but not overdone. \n\nI ordered a 12 piece sashimi, the grilled Saba, miso soup and a large bottle of Orion beer. Total out the door was about $90. The majority of the menu is a la carte per piece and is a little overpriced. The 12 piece sashimi for $36 was a good value though. $3 per piece versus an average of $8 on the a la carte menu. \n\nHow was it???  The miso soup was maybe the best I've ever had. Seriously, that good. The grilled Saba was really good as well as the sashimi. All of it was worth the money. The sake menu was super high end. I think the lowest priced bottle was $45 and went up to $600. I opted for the beer instead as I don't know enough about sake to make a decision like that. \n\nOverall I totally understand why it's though to get in here but it's worth it for a good not super high end sushi restaurant.", "author": "Scott M."}

Now it's been replaced with sushi sets that are about $4 per thumb-sized piece of nigiri (often mixed with standard fare like tuna / salmon / hamachi ). Since they're now only interested in courting $$$-$$$$ customers, I feel like I need to use a more demanding rubric on them.\n\n-Wandering off the omakase menu could mean $6-12 per tiny half-bite, and a man with an average appetite would need like 20 pieces to be full. So that's like a $120-240 meal? You better be on Kiss Seafood / Ijji Sushi's level for that, but sadly Akiko does not compare to these. It's more like Pabu, somewhere to bring Bob from Accounts Payable visiting from the HQ from Charlotte or Orange County.\n\n-The sushi rice seems mushy, warm and not vinegared enough.\n\n-Their saucing on the omakase nigiri also seems too bland to bring out the natural sweetness of the fish. Every piece had a light brush of weak, thin soy sauce that seems lacking compared to, say, the creative sauce brush of Ijji Sushi or the traditional mastery of Kiss Seafood / Kusakabe.\n\n-Their fried seafood items were extremely good and worth it, though!\n\nThe space is cute and charming and the staff is very friendly, but again, I don't feel like being taxed an extra 25% for my mild enjoyment of edison bulbs and polished wood.\n\nI'd say a better value quickie lunch can be found in nearish-by Sanraku, and better taste+value full dinner omakase can be found at Kiss Seafood / Ijji / Saru / Kusakabe. It's stuck somewhere in between high and mid-grade in terms of price and target clientele...", "author": "Ken H."}

The menu price says A.Q. but we paid ~$90 for the pleasure. Do it.\n\nStuff-of-legend.

Words simply are unworthy to describe. Just know this - cherish those fleeting moments you have with Akiko's uni.\n\n-Tenth came the beef, which single-handedly revolutionized my concept of 'beef'.

The table is plated nicely and artistically. The waiters were very attentive with refilling my water cup as soon as I took a sip.\n\nWe ordered:\n--12 piece sashimi tasting $34\nIt consisted of assorted tunas, salmon and other exotic fishes. It was a nice thin portion for sashimi. Each piece was juicy and melted in my mouth. My favorite might've been the fatty salmon.\n\n--Tekka Roll $12\nTekka Roll consisted of tuna, scallion, avocado, crispy shiso, pickled carrot and sesame. This roll was new and interesting to me. The tuna was fatty and juicy. The rice had the perfect texture and the crispy shiso gave the sushi a nice crunch. It was delicious\n\n--Green Tea and Black Sesame Mochi $2.50 each piece\nI'm not sure if these were made in-house but they were creamy and perfectly sweetened. The mochi skin was thick and sticky and paired really well with the ice cream.\n\nThe food was decent, but the service was meh (except for the hostess).

There was some difficulty locating this place cause the restaurant had no sign or name! Turns out it was a tiny corner restaurant with open-windows that looks kinda like a cute coffee shop at a quick glance.\n\nUpon arrival, we were seated promptly in a back dining area. The ambiance of the restaurant was very cozy, hip, and modern. I loved how the place was dimly lit and quite romantic; perfect for date night.\n\nThe gf and I both opted for the omakase.\n\nO M A K A S E:\n\n- Ohitashi (2 for $8): marinated spinach. \n- Akami Sashimi(2pc for $12.80): tuna sashimi. Cut thin but nothing special. \n- Umimasu Nigiri (2pc for $6): ocean trout. very fresh and buttery. enjoyed it very much.\n- Tennen Hirame Sashimi (2pc for $10.80): wild fluke. usually one of my favorite fishes, but this one was quite stringy when bitten apart.\n- Kuromutsu (2pc for $12): fish looked a bit oily than others, but taste was delicious.\n- Shima Aji Nigiri (2pc for $15): farmed striped mackerel. Pretty good & Fresh\n- Kinmedai Nigiri (2pc for $20): \"cold smoked\" aged wild golden eye snapper. This one was torched so it gave off a delicious seared smokey taste. Only downside was I didn't like the texture that much. \n- Kamasu Nigiri (6pc for $36): wild young barracuda. the gf and i LOVED this one so much we ordered seconds! \n- Ankimo Nigiri (2pc for $8.50): loved this one also. The ankimo was soft and delicious.\n- Russian Uni Nigiri (2pc for  $25): the uni was delicately small and sweet! Absolutely yummy. Pretty impressed at how they just topped the uni on top of the rice without any seaweed wrap. \n\n\nA L A  C A R T:\n\n- Negi Toro Roll ($20): this roll was utterly disappointing. definitely not worth $20 cause it was very plain and tasteless. Made American-style and the roll was kinda loose. nothing special... cept the price.\n- Nama Hotate Nigiri (2pc for $15): over nighted, unprocessed fresh scallops. The gf and I are scallop fanatics and these babies did not disappoint! Definitely fresh. \n- Ikura Nigiri (2pc for $8): the gf ordered this and said it was good.\n- Uni Nigiri (2pc for $12): sea urchin. \n- Ebodai (2pc for $12): Wild butterfish. Didn't order this but it came out and we drunkenly ate it :(\n- Tsuri Aji Nigiri (2pc for $14): Wild horse mackerel. Also didn't order this but ate it once again. (face palm)\n\n\nD R I N K S:\n\n- Okuden Kanisukuri (300ml for $28)\n- Groth Sauvignon Blanc BTL (Bottle for $50)\n\n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waitress gave us both mixed feelings. She was sweet and always smiling and came to us when we waived her down. But she was also very confusing. Where do I even start :(  So we asked for the omakase and after number of nigiris were out already,  she came up to us and asked if we would like to \"continue\". When she said that, we thought she was just checking in on us and asknig if we would like to continue with our omakase with whatever nigiri's were left or if we were going onto dessert, so we said yes. Then ten minutes later, she comes back to our table with a whole set of nigiri's again from the omakase, so we told her we already got those. She then looked hella confused and said: \"Oh, i thought you guys wanted another round of omakase\". My friend and I just looked at each other shocked and told her no.... She continued to look at us really confused but took the nigiri's back. We then told her that if we were done with our omakase, we would like to order a la carte. From there on, there was even more confusion. Our nigiri's were all mixed up and we were getting fishes that we didn't order and we got the kamasu three times when we only asked for seconds. Towards the end and a few drinks in, my friend and I were pretty tipsy and disappointed to continue so we asked for the tab and left still in shocked with all the mix-ups and the fact that we racked up our bill by drunkenly eating some nigiri's that we didn't order. \n\nAnother factor we found very interesting was the fact that the omakase was no different from ordering a la carte. When we asked for the omakase, we thought it was gonna be a set price (not listed) for a set menu. But when we looked at our bill, we were charged by the items on the omakase individually and at the SAME price as ordering them a la carte... so what's the point of an omakase?!? If we knew this, we would've definitely not have gotten the omakase cause there were some items we didn't like as much. Our bill came out to be $340 for two people pre-tips. \n\nOur experience at Akiko's was ok. Although there was a lot of mix up and confusion from the waitress to the menu's, we did enjoy the atmosphere and the nigiri's. Our visit was a few months back so hopefully it's better now cause I do wish to return someday...... one day", "author": "Anissa D."}

The quality of fish and other ingredients are all top notch although the dishes are quite a bit more pricey than the two dollar signs on Yelp might suggest.\n\nThe menu options are pretty limited (especially if you like rolls) and most of the dishes are small so we ended up ordering most of the menu.\n\nSashimi / sushi - Very high quality fish and nice thick cuts. (4.5/5)\n\nMushroom + seafood soup - Clean and simple seafood flavor. (3.5/5)\n\nScallop + cucumber salad - Fresh scalops and cucumber in a soy based sauce. A bit underwhelming for its price. (3/5)\n\nGrilled Hamachi collar - Incredibly well cooked. Very flavorful and juicy and served with a delicious sauce. Best thing I ate here. (5/5)\n\nGrilled mackerel - Very juicy for mackerel and flavorful. (4.5/5)\n\nMiso marinated black cod - Like most of the items, very fresh, well cooked, and flavorful. Flavor is a bit too sweet for me though and was very pricy for the small size. (4/5)\n\nFried tofu - It was supposed to come with salmon roe but they didn't have any so they gave it to us without us and without saying anything until we asked. The tofu was nicely fried with a light breading in a soy based sauce. Underwhelming and overpriced overall. (2.5/5)\n\nFried soft shell crab - very similar to the tofu dish but crab works well on its own unlike the tofu. (3.5/5)\n\nRolls - Average. Rolls were very simple with seaweed wrapping the rice and fish tartare on the inside (not whole fish on outside). (3/5)\n\nOverall the food was good but pricier than expected.

But I guess it is good for us since the price will go up surely if they get a star. This is the #1 Sushi restaurant in town for me. Better than Kusakabe (previously #1 on my list).\n\nThis restaurant has around 30 seats, 8 at the bar. Very good atmosphere with nice decor. The chefs and staff are very friendly. I was seated at the bar with chef Alex who is very friendly - we had a very good conversation.\n\nLet's go to the food. The rice is really good! Seasoned with akazu vinegar (red vinegar) giving a very nice subtle vinegary flavour. The texture is a bit al-dente - very nice. The fish here is fabulous with amazing flavor and texture. Awesome.\n\nDefinitely try this restaurant. You will be very pleased! \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's the note I took during the meal.\n\nOmakase\n\n- oyster with Russian stergion caviar - The saltiness of caviar paired beautifully with the oyster\n- shima aji with fermented yuzu zest - Excellent. Firm texture. The yuzu zest cut through the fattyness very nicely.\n- aradashi tofu\n- kinmedai - even better than the last piece.\n- scallop from hokkaido and sea urchin. The scallop is really fresh sweet - the chef told us that the scallop is not entirely dear i.e. The muscle reflex is still there.\n- zuke bluefin tuna (akami) from Nagasaki - wonderful red meat tuna. The best akami I had in the US\n- uni in ocean water from hoggaido - wow! Not bitter at all. Very creamy and smooth.\n- king salmon - really good flavor with a little bit of yuzu zest.\n- kani (hairy crab from hoggaido and uni donburi with seaweed from tsukiji. The crab is seasoned with miso butter which go very well with the crab.\n- zuke chutoro marinated over night lightly torched. Fantastic! This is wonderfully tender tuna. Almost melt in your mouth but still have the flavour of red meat. Very nice.\n- shiro toro from higgaido with mustard - torched. Wonderful flavor. Never had better shiro maguro.\n- black grouper with onion ponzu\n- scallop marinated in unagi sauce.\n\nAddition orders\n- iwashi (sardine) with young finger and chive - recommend by chef. What I like about this is it has some fishiness but in a very good way. Wonderful\n- ayu with lime zest\n- kohada\n- saba - marinade in vinegar. The flavour is very clean. You can forget the saba you had in other sushi restaurant around here.\n- hokkaido shiro murasaki sea urchin - great! The texture is like that of a custard and had a little bit of eggy flavor. Very nice. This is a very expensive sea urchin (25$ per piece) and it is the same one used in sukiyabashi jiro and sushi saito. Is it worth 25$/piece? I think my pallet is not good enough to distinguish it.\n- miyazaki wagyu topped with foie gras and white truffle. Not quite sure if I detected the smell of the white truffle but it give a nice chewy/crunchy texture.  Foie gras and wagyu beef is a holy combination. I'm in heaven!", "author": "Thanapat W."}

Note: this place is different from Akiko's Sushi Bar.\n\nSince our friend knew chef Ray, we got to meet him before the dinner, and he personally brought out some amazing salt and pepper octopus on lollipop sticks for us. He was super down to earth and clearly excited and passionate about the food they were making. \n\nThen, we were lucky enough to get the prime sushi bar seats on the end (there are only 2), so we could look at everything going on behind the counter.  \n\nOur sushi chef was Roger, who was super personable, and the sake expert, Jessica was very knowledgeable and took great care of us. Chef Ray also made a couple of appearances, which was really nice. \n\nTo start: \n1. Wagyu tartare on a nori chip: the nori chip was super crisp and savory, and the wagyu kind of melts in your mouth - a good combination of textures. \n2. Matsutake mushroom soup: light clear broth with mushrooms and squid \n3 Spanish mackerel sashimi: seared and cold smoked - there were quite a few pieces on the dish \n\nOnto sushi:\n(All the pieces were great, but * = favorites that I would order a la carte as add-ons)\n1. *Hotate with crystallized soy, citrus, and charcoal infused salt\n2. Halibut with seaweed and a sort of mussel on top \n3. Kinmedia (golden eye snapper), torched, with a special salt on top \n4. Kawahagi (trigger fish): an unusual find, served with its own liver sauce \n5. *Japanese barracuda, torched, with grated ginger, lemon, and an intense pure tasting sesame oil \n6. *Shima aji with kombu infused seaweed and Japanese mustard (loved these flavors together)\n7. Kohada with shiso and sesame \n8. *Akamutsu (Japanese throat fish) with Japanese fermented chili \n9. Blue fin tuna: the lean part as a hand roll in fresh nori - this was a very generous portion\n10. Wild winter yellowtail, torched \n11. New Zealand salmon with shiso flower, sea kelp, salt crystals - super rich but also with texture from the salt - a good mix of sweet and savory\n12. *Bonito with chopped wasabi stem \n13. Otoro aged 10 days in house\n14. *Otoro marinated in a jalape\u00f1o soy, torched\n15. Uni in a natural brine, super sweet and fresh, served on rice in a wooden spoon \n\nDessert: a friend who I completely trust for food told me that with all of her world travels, she thought the best ice cream ever was that made by Ray, and it did not disappoint.  We had a non-fish shaped taiyaki (thin and flaky outside) filled with smoked buttermilk ice cream and shiso ice cream. The texture on the ice cream was good - dense and rich, and the flavors were basically as described. \n\nWe definitely had some more interesting selections for the sushi, such as the trigger fish and throat fish, which was a nice change from the regular stuff. Again, I love anything torched and made sure Roger knew that, and I really liked that the fish was torched while sitting on a salt block for extra flavor.  I was really happy with all of the sushi pieces - the flavor combinations were interesting, the cuts of fish were consistent and good, and the shari was good.\n\nMake sure you get a sushi bar seat for the omakase.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

The coating on the soft shelled crab appetizer was far too thick and greasy and sadly all crab flavor was lost.

Also tried the negihama but again, couldn't even tell there was fish in it by taste alone. Sad too because at first glance they seem to have a good variety of fish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-13", "description": "Top-notch fish! i.e. possibly among the closest I've gotten in my life to the sushi that Jiro dreams of. Comparable in quality to those uber-authentic sushi places in LA's Little Tokyo.\n\nThe fish menu was amusingly similar to wine, with the name of the fish, place of origin, and categorization of white fish (\"mild, clean\") vs vibrant fish (\"full flavor, buttery\"). To extend the analogy to wine flights, they do offer omakase and sashimi tasting for the undecisive and/or high-maintenance. \n\nSake king salmon (Marlborough, New Zealand, $8 nigiri): The salmon taste and fattiness was more attenuated than I had expected, based on my experiences with cooked king salmon. It's different from your typical sake, though it does require some thought and patience to notice the subtle complexities: first an interestingly firm texture, then unraveling nuanced salmon flavors, and a buttery finish. I was slightly disappointed with the small cut, but this was a pretty memorable piece of fish.\n\nSpider roll ($10): One bite and you feel like all the previous spider rolls you've ever eaten was a hoax fabricated of batter and sauce. Akiko's version puts the softshell crab boldly in the spotlight (for once), supplemented by touches of tempura, soy sauce, avocado, and sushi rice that had a stronger mirin taste than usual.\n\nSaba shio-yaki with chives, ponzu-daikon,charred lemon ($12): I'm usually not a huge fan of saba, but I was a huge fan of this dish! The saba is everything you expect of saba shioyaki (robust, roasty, buttery), minus the usual negatives (overly fishy, salty, greasy). The additional ingredients synergistically contributed tangy and umami overtones. The texture was well constructed as well, with the fish infused with the sauce, a layer of soft daikon, topped with fine strings of (what I believe are) chives (but looked like moss). And props to the decent sized portion!\n\nAkiko's has fantastic attention to detail, which really brings the overall dining experience to the next level. There are numerous little things, such as chilled soy sauce, fresh authentic i.e. very strong wasabi, and quality wooden chopsticks (so you don't taste raw wood or plastic with every bite). \n\nThe main aspect of Akiko's that didn't fly was its hodgepodge ambiance. First of all, they initially seated us in this random table right by the entrance next to a pillar, even though we had a reservation. After asking to move to the back area where there were tables open, we noticed that the room appeared very confused--three walls are covered in a wallpaper print that looked European, while the fourth wall was bare stone with exposed metal pipes. It also didn't meld well with the restaurant as a whole: the other sections consisted of an haute gastropub-like sushi bar and a bright atrium with a few tables (including the random one in the hallway) and a giant octopus painting.\n\nTip: If you're like me and not well versed in know how to fully appreciate fancypants fish, I highly recommend the rolls. The nigiri selection has some seriously exquisite options, but personally I don't find it worthwhile to spend so much $$$ on a bite unless you're a connoisseur. The rolls, on the other hand, are mostly priced similarly to other sushi places, except the quality is superb. The caveat? It will be a challenge to go back to regular sushi. I never liked cheap sushi in the first place, but I think now I will be utterly disgusted. Akiko's redefines your concept of fish.", "author": "Edna C."}

The tonkatsu had good crunch and came with this thick dark sauce to dip in. From my home chef tastebuds, it tasted like a vinegar and honey concoction. However, it was delicious and I would eat again. The pork cut was on the thinner side though.  The combo also came with four nigiri pieces, which were decent. I wasn't blown away at the quality of fish but it's the side dish to the tonkatsu plate so I wasn't expecting much. But the fatty tuna is really the star. When the plate was placed in front of me, I was so happy. Color was a nice pink and it looked so fresh and clean.  When it hit my tongue, I felt all the troubles in life melt away.

I almost did not go in!!! I sat at the bar and had an awesome variety of nigiri and sashimi prepared for me. I tried things I have never tried before like barracuda, eel fish, hokkaido scallop, and more. \n\nI outlasted a couple that was already eating when I came in and another couple came in during my meal and I outlasted them as well. I just kept wanting to try more and was excited to see what else the chef would put together. My chef was a cute lil japanese guy who did not say much, but you could see the care he took in making each nigiri (you didn't even need soy sauce...just their VERY delish wasabi). My meal cost $116 (without tip and I had hot tea) and it was money well spent. I would come back here again for sure!!!\n\nI was told that 70% of the fish here is imported from Japan. They even import from Hawaii as well.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

However, if the service in a high-end restaurant is bad, I don't see the need to come here. \n\nSo I made a reservation to seat at the bar with my boyfriend. Seriously, there was only one couple seating far from us and Ricky was the only one serving us. However, his attitude and service was just unacceptable. I never had a chief, who does not greet us as we seat. So we were ready to order and no one was ready to take the order and no water was served as well. After calling out for a waitress, she told us to order directly to the chief, who doesn't even bother to serve us. So I said \"Excuse me, we are ready to order.\" Then finally he said \"what do you want?\"\n\nHmmmm.... Excuse me.... We just wanted to get out right there. Seriously, who would serve a customer like that. But their nigiri are good and with that cold weather and time, we didn't want to find another dinner place. So we told him what we wanted thinking that he's having a bad day. But mostly the point of seating at the bar is to get a detailed service from a chief. WOW!! Seriously, he served us with 5-7 sushi at a time (instead of one by one) and explained too fast that we didn't hear which fish is what. Seriously, if you are having a bad day, don't express it out when that is your job!!!! \n\nSo usually when we go eat sushi, it takes about 1:30 - 2 hours. But it took us 40 minutes to finish our meal. Although the food is good, if the service is this bad I wouldn't come back here AT ALL. \n\nBy the way, after we finished our nigiri, an \"important\" couple seat next to us. And wow, Ricky's service was totally different. It looked like they were their regular customer by he knows what they wanted. But seriously, treating customers should not be that much different. Oh well, not coming back here but people should know to not seat at the bar or not even come here for their unacceptable service.", "author": "Alice C."}

However, the server never confirmed what we ordered. Most frustrating was that they gave us a lot of trouble about sending it back, insisting it was what we ordered. Another server tried to give it to us again saying it was what we ordered, then rolled her eyes at us. The original server never checked on us, except to ask if we were done after having only agedashi tofu and 4 pieces of nigiri. When I noted that the food was talking a long time (all the tables around us who ordered multiple rounds of food after us were already getting their food) the waitress made a long winded excuse about the mix-up, in effect blaming us for their rude and slow service. Having a cold server would have been fine had our order been correct. In addition, the servers seemed to be going out of their way to be hyper-attentive to the tables beside us.

I came here for lunch a few months ago and it was a total 5 star experience for me -- felt like I was mindblown by how high quality the food was and how delicious it was. But I came here last night for the omakase and was severely underwhelmed by how mediocre the entire omakase experience was. Unfortunately, I'm writing this review post that recent experience so my review will be a little less than desirable, but eh. What happens happens.\n\nAkiko's is a reservation only restaurant -- all you do is email the restaurant to make a reservation. It's not particularly hard to get them e.g. I've always emailed a few days in advance and had no problems. The crowd is definitely FiDi business people lunch eating kind of atmosphere, so it's classy etc. \n\nThe lunch set I had was quite simple -- some rice and some sashimi pieces. I've uploaded photos for my dinner --there were quite a variety of things -- scallops, black cod, mackeral, salmon, yellowtail, lean tuna, etc. Interesting mix of sashimi and some other raw fish with some nigiri pieces. Overall... it just wasn't an amazing experience. The sushi was okay, but I was pretty intrigued by the rice since it looked like brown rice but didn't have the texture of it? I was confused. I also found it really weird that for an omakase they didn't give us our own place. For one dish, we were served one cooked black cod which is fine because I was with a friend, but what if we were coworkers? That would have been a bit awkward and strange if we had to split the fish with our chopsticks and share off of it. \n\nAnother odd thing -- they made a specific deal about asking us about what we didn't like. My friend said she didn't like cilantro. Then the first dish they served us ... had cilantro. Like why?? What was the point of asking if you weren't going to honor it? Or did you already forget? Unclear.\n\nAnyways, each fish was above average I guess... but the final omakase was $125 after tax and tip. You can get a Jiro's apprentice omakase for $125 in NYC ... I'd much rather eat that than eat here. Fish was generally fresh and good, but I just wish there was more nigiri since I left pretty hungry but didn't feel like adding more to the baseline omakase since I knew it was going to be $$$$. In retrospect, we should have just customized our omakase and ordered fish on our own rather than letting the chef choose. \n\ntldr; lunch is better than dinner, imho. it's cheaper too. make sure to email in for reservations cause you're unlikely to get in by walking", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Both times the food was delightful. I especially recommend the deep sea red grouper, sea trout, uni, and... well, basically everything! \n\nMy friend and I each had about 11 pieces of nigiri and paid ~$60 plus sake. We were both pretty satisfied. Not hungry until later into the night when we got some golden boy from North Beach. My friend and I were lucky in that we came in on a Saturday at 8pm and the guy was able to seat us in 15 minutes. Apparently, this is atypical. \n\nOmakase was $130/person (pictures are on their way up here). I would say my only disappointment (other than the fact that I will never have an endless river of sushi flow before my eyes and into my mouth -- this will only happen in my dreams), is that usually I enjoy hearing what everything actually is; we had a hodgepodge of wait people, and several of them mumbled or didn't even explain. Super sad face. But all is forgiven in light of the quality fish meats! \n\nFidi, so parking is rough, but if you take bart BART, Akiko's is definitely walkable. Also... omakase well get you ice cream mochi for dessert!", "author": "Michelle K."}

Took the husband here for a belated Father's Day lunch, and we decided to splurge on the omakase ($100-$120 depending on the day's offerings). It was very, very good, especially if you are lucky enough to get the wagyu beef with truffle in the end. All the fish selections were fresh and delicious, especially the Hokkaido uni and amaebi (sweet shrimp). \n\nI do agree with another reviewer that the rice didn't seem to hold together well (a couple of our nigiris would just fall apart) and some of the fish had too much wasabi. It needs some more finesse to compete with Wako and Kusakabe (still our top favorites) but it's a great spot for weekday lunch and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.", "author": "Jen K."}

However, what caught us by surprise was that the greeter asked us if we had a reservation. I did not read other yelpers' tips prior to walking in, so I had no idea that we had to have a reservation. I explained to her that we just came across the restaurant on Yelp and it was just for the two of us. She looked around and seated us right away. (Yay! Granted, we did walk in at 5:30PM on a Thursday, so it wasn't THAT crowded) ((Note to future self: make a reservation beforehand!!!))\n\nOur friendly waiter, Alan, offered us water and gave us ample time to go over the menu. \n\nWhat we initially ordered:\n1 edamame\n2 Ji-kinmedai nigiri (nice salty & buttery taste!)\n2 Amaebi nigiri (crunchy and buttery taste!)\n1 order Kuromatsu nigiri (meaty & the melt-in-your-mouth type of fish!)\n1 Spider roll (nice and crispy taste without that weird shellfish after taste!)\n2 Sayuri sake \n\nFirst round of nigiri was so good, flavorful and buttery! However, what really stole our hearts was the Kuromatsu nigiri. My best friend said we should order another nigiri, but I opted for the 5-piece sashimi. When it came out, the dish legit sparkled with the fish oil and they were presented on the shishio leaf with radish. It was so good, my friend and I totally forgot about our sake! Turns out, Alan had forgotten to bring it out to us.  \n\nHe apologized and brought it out for us and said the sake was on him. We were surprised and felt that he truly did care about the experience we were getting at Akiko. \n\nLong story, short:\n(+) excellent quality of food\n(+) amazing service (ask for Alan! He gives great eating tips and can provide you with really good recommendations.)\n(+) great selection of sake/wine/\n(+) menu organization between different fish with clear descriptions \n(+) presentation of each dish was on point\n\n(-) a bit pricey, but it's San Francisco. $10 for one nigiri was a little over my head since I hail from LA. \n(-) no complimentary edamame or miso soup\n\nOverall, I would give this place 4.5 stars, but bumping it up for Alan's amazing service, tips and the quality of food! Will definitely come back... with a reservation next time! Thank you for the awesome dinner and experience!", "author": "Nicole Q."}

We came at 5:30pm and requested if we could be accommodated earlier than the 7:15 seating that my BF has reserved online. We were told that there were no seats available for us until our reserved time. However, their website was accepting reservations for several slots at 15-min increments way prior to our 7:15 reservation. (It was already 6:20 when I checked Yelp to see if Akiko is still accepting reservations and there were several slots open at 15-min increments starting at 6:30pm). We cancelled our Akiko reservation upon seeing the open slots online and ended up at PABU by Michael Mina.  At PABU we had the omakase plus the supplement and it was a great dinner starting from the happy spoon to the foie gras (all of them great tasting) and ending with the monaka dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-28", "description": "Akiko's is overpriced for the quality of sushi they serve. There's an $85 minimum per person, which I'm happy to pay for excellent sushi, but Akiko's is not worth it. I would much rather go to Maruya for authentic high quality sushi. If you a TRUE sushi aficionado and you have lived in Japan, you will know the difference. Otherwise, you might think Akiko's sushi is really good (as demonstrated by my American friends' raving recommendations). \n\nThe restaurant itself is very chic and modern. It's well decorated and has a good atmosphere for date night. I saw a lot of couples here. The restaurant is pretty small, so I would not come with a big group. Probably 2-4 people is ideal. It was a little bit hard to find at first since there's no sign outside that says Akiko's. \nI came on a Saturday night with 4 other people and the restaurant was full. We had a reservation at 7 and we arrived 10 minutes early and had to wait till 7 to be seated. \n\nWe sat for about 15 minutes and were not served water or given menus until I asked someone for the menu. Our waiter did not do a good job of explaining their offers. He asked us if we were all doing the omakase and when I asked if that was our only option, he said yes. But since my boyfriend's dad doesn't eat a lot of raw fish, we asked if we could see the menu and if he could order off of the menu instead and then he said that would be fine as long as he hit the $85 minimum. Then why did you say we HAD to do the omakase!!  -_- We were very confused as to why the menu offered so many food options from the kitchen if everyone was required to do the omakase. \n\nWe waited quite a while for our food. The first 2 dishes were an avocado mixed greens salad and an octopus cucumber salad. They were both average and pretty small. Then we were served Hamachi kama and were confused if this was part of the omakase or not since the server didn't say anything. I was under the assumption that the omakase was for sashimi and sushi. I wasn't expecting Hamachi Kama so I asked the waiter to walk us through what is included in the omakase. He probably should have told us in the beginning or given us an omakase menu. \n\nNext, we were served assorted sashimi which included salmon, Hamachi, and other fish. Nothing too impressive. After the sashimi we probably waited 20 minutes or more before they finally served us the nigiri. The timing was all off. While we waited a long time between each course, when they started bringing the nigiri out, they brought out the next piece before we were even done with the first few pieces they brought out. In a real sushi restaurant, the chef should serve each piece individually and wait till you are finished with one before serving the next so that each piece is served fresh. \n\nThe uni (sea urchin) and hotate (scallops) were decently good, but not the best.  The gindara was probably the best thing I ate there. It wasn't part of the omakase though. \n\nAt the end of the meal, our server didn't even ask us if we wanted desert...Our total bill came out to $525 including tip. Pretty pricey for mediocre sushi. \n\nIn conclusion, our experience was sub par and I will not be going back to Akiko's when I can get better quality fish and service at Maruya for the same price.", "author": "Mai Y."}

But again the fried shrimp head was not crispy enough.\n\n#Sashimi Tasting: B.\nWe all got one order each, and before we ordered we were really struggling to decide between this and omakase. All of us really regretted it though - the fish selection was very ordinary (albacore tuna, big eye tuna, sea bass, king salmon, yellowtail). The freshness was okay but it's on the same level as any ordinary Japanese joints in the Bay Area. And it's $34 not cheap at all. Not sure if the omakase would be any better though. \n\nOverall, I think I would only go back for an omakase experience and see if it justifies for an additional star.

While it was raining hard AF and I was recovering from a minor cold, I didn't want to reschedule.  I had been wanting to try out Akiko's for some time, and no one, not even monsoon rain and ebola could stop me.\n\nWe arrived and noticed the quaint cozy intimate restaurant.

We were graciously served by our waiter, whose name I can't remember, but his recommendations I will have in memory forever.  Their menu changes daily, and you can tell they take pride in using the finest quality of local and seasonal fresh fish.  Apparently- the fish arrive daily from local purveyors and Japan's Tsukiji Fish Market (insert swoon).\n\nThe beau and I opted for miso soup, edamame, their scallop roll, tekka roll, Hara Sake, Amaebi, Hotate, Negihama, and this amazing house salmon roll they had.

Finally made it the other evening, and it didn't disappoint.  In fact it was quite the experience and we were amazed and impressed with everything we ate.\n\nThe menu is extensive, definitely not a newbie sushi kind of place.  We thought we knew our sushi until we saw the daily special menu of fish from Japan, most of which we have never heard of.  So being our first time we leaned on our waiter to put together omokase selection for us based on a few preferences and some selection from the specials.  The 6 sashimi's and 4 nigiri sushi's were incredible, and afterwards said it will be hard to eat sushi anywhere else after this.  Everything was so fresh, clean tasting, we actually never ended up using the wasabi, ginger and soy sauce on the side, didn't need it.  Along with the sushi, we got cod and fried squid, both were amazing in themselves.  The squid (ika) was prepared so the hard portion of the shell is removed, but rest of the head, tentacles and legs were still intact and fried whole.  Crazy as it sounds, everything was edible, even the spiny legs.\n\nNot cheap yet not over the top expensive either.  About $200 for omokase sushi, with 2 glasses of sake.

Some stand outs were the golden eye fish, the uni, cooked black cod and the A5 wagyu. On this particular day, they had 5 different unis.

Sashimi is presented with nasturtium in addition to the usual shiso and daikon.

I had to do a double take making sure I was at the right place. \n\nCame in at 11:35, and the place was already busy. I was seated right away at the Sushi bar. Took a glance inside the menu but already knew I was gonna do Omakase. Omakase it was. \"Oma\" the sushi chefs shouted in succession. \n\nSeries of Nigiri sushi came out in interval. With my omakase order I did not get any hot food, and I was fine with that. I don't remember even quarter of the name of the fish presented to me. These are some of the ones I remember: Hirame, Kinmedai, Kanpachi, Soy-sauce infused Tuna, Shima Aji, ... (blanking out right now). Anyway, nearly all of the Nigiri were seasoned with some kind of sauce or torched to perfection to bring out the Umami. \n\nTowards the end on the 16th Nigiri, the chef asked me if I wanted some more. I decided to wrap up the luxurious lunch with all 4 types of Unis that they had (really good decision).\n\nThe first Uni presented on a wooden spoon, was Uni which had been soaked in Salt water (or so I thought I heard). The second Uni was from California. The third from Hokkaido (smaller compared to California ones). The last, which I thought was the piece de la Resistance, was Russian Uni (I assume it's from Russia), presented in a nice wooden bowl. I found the progression was deliberate; first Uni to the last - start with milder, simpler tasting to more complex, more nutty and more explosive.\n\nEnjoyed my Omakase experience here at Akiko's. There were not a single miss, all hits. I've already recommended this Sushi place to my Bay area friends.\n\nIt is easily one of the best Sushi place I've been to.\n\nP.S: I was a tad skeptical that there wasn't any Japanese sushi chef behind the counter. Rest assured, I did not have to worry about that at all.", "author": "Arie R."}

My favorite part is when the waiter/waitress serves your order, they explain everything in details. Most dishes come pre-seasoned so don't be surprise when you don't see soy sauce on the table, lol.

If you enjoy fresh quality raw fish/sashimi, definitely stop by here. If you want big portioned rolls that are fulfilling, then skip this place because each specialty roll came in about 5 small pieces. Your wallet will hurt tenderly if you're hungry.\n\nMy friend and I came here for Weds dinner around 6PM and snagged a tiny table in the corner of the restaurant. I immediately noticed the minimalistic vibe of the restaurant. There were not many decorations and everything was made of light brown wood and had a nature color scheme. We ordered edamame and 3 specialty rolls, total bill was $32 (excluding tax and tip). I spent ~$20 for 6-7 pieces of sushi...Not. Worth. It. \n\nSPIDER $7...SOFT SHELL CRAB, AVOCADO, SCALLION, SOY PAPER\nGrade C: There was simply not. enough. crab. This was actually one of the worst spider rolls I've ever had. The crab was in such small quantity that it got lost because the fresh avocado was so overwhelming. \n\nTEKKA $12...TUNA, SCALLION, AVOCADO, CRISPY SHISO, PICKLED CARROT, SESAME\nGrade B: Definitely the busiest roll I ate. There were many components to this specialty roll and somehow the chefs still managed to downsize it to tiny itty bitty pieces. The tuna and veggies made this roll the crispiest one. Tasty but not worth $12.\n\nSAKE $10...FRESH SALMON, AVOCADO, SCALLION, YUZU JALAPENO, TARE, TOASTED SESAME\nGrade A: My favorite roll of the night! By far, the salmon had the FRESHEST taste to it! It was so exhilarating that I wish I had more to eat :) The Yuzu jalapeno definitely gives it a nice feisty kick in your mouth! Nothing too spicy so don't be alarmed. The pieces of avocado however were unusually large in this roll, although the salmon cuts were also proportionally large. Love love love!\n\n[[PROS]]\n++ FRESH fresh fresh Fish! The salmon and tuna were both excellent cuts and the texture was perfect enough to melt in your mouth. Hands down, quality freshness.\n\n+ Fresh Avocado and Veggies. All their avo & vegs were crisp and had no signs of browning or mushy texture. Perfecto again.\n\n+ Efficient Service for sure. Friendly? Sort of, depending on who you get. My water and teas were always refilled and our table was cleaned after every consumed roll, bravo.\n\n+ Minimalistic Ambiance. I find beauty in simply things and the abstract yet quaint set-up of the restaurant was mesmerizing and much appreciated. The careful choosing and pairings of the candle, water glasses, tea cups, chopstick holder, etc. are a harmonious cohesion.\n\n[[CONS]]\n-- Not ENOUGH FOOD! Argh, my friend and I ordered an appetizer and 3 rolls (total= $32) and STILL left so hungry ugh. Each specialty roll we ordered consisted of 5-6 TINY pieces! How frustrating considering the prices...but their quality is spectacular though.\n\n- Too Pricey for the Food portions. I do enjoy and appreciate good quality but not at the expense of quantity and leaving the restaurant hungry. How embarrassing.\n\n- Crowded/Small Restaurant. I got lucky eating dinner at 6PM but I cannot tell you how many people waited or left during dinner time because there were simply not enough chairs or open spots at the bar.", "author": "Donna T."}

My first time I sat at a table in the back and had an assortment of nigiri and the second time I sat at the sushi bar in front of Chef Alex. These two experiences were very different, and my second time here doing omakase at the sushi bar is what drives this 5-star review.\n\nThe nigiri that Chef Alex prepared was absolutely delicious and included hotate, mirugai, madai, otoro, kani, hamachi, kanpachi, uni, ika, aji, and anago, to name a few. I think overall we had ~23 pieces of nigiri. The sushi I had here wasn't the very traditional kind you'll find in Japan, or at certain other restaurants here in the city (Maruya, for example, is more on the traditional side in my opinion). The chef used a variety of ingredients to mix things up and add his own interpretation of the nigiri, all of which were received very well. Some pieces were very flavorful and others simply melted in your mouth. The rice was also good too - not sticky, good texture on the individual grains.\n\nOverall a great time at Akiko's and just the omakase itself that night was ~$165. They also have some great sake too, but of course that will easily bump you up into the $250+ per person range.", "author": "Gore S."}

I think that's a very exaggerated assessment of the sushi served here.\n\nI spent 15 years in Japan, so I know my sushi, but that said, I'm def not a sushi snob.  \n\n3 of us came, and one of us ordered OMAKASE.  The other two of us ordered assorted nigiri-style.  \n\nNo doubt, the sushi quality was good, but the cuts of the fish were undersized.  The waitress said a lot of their fish is flown in from Japan. We had hamachi, tuna, kanpachi and a bunch of the other usual suspects.\n\nThe problem is, if you're going to pay this much, the quality and experience for me needs to be off-the-chart.  And it wasn't.  It was just good, maybe *very good*, but then you look at the bill and then shake your head.  The value wasn't there.\n\nI've been to the other $$$$ places, Morimoto, Nobu and the rest.  And when I leave there, it's a different feeling.  I don't feel ripped off because my enjoyment level was such that I don't care about the money.  At Akiko's, I resented the amount of the bill because the experience wasn't worth it.\n\nWe also had some pretty mediocre agedashi-dofu.  And the miso soup was WAY under par, watered down and lacking flavor.\n\nBottom line, I would rather take the money I spent on this meal, put it toward a plane ticket to go to eat at Sugarfish in LA.  You'll pay a total of $100 for 3 people at Sugarfish and you will leave completely and utterly satisfied.  \n\nSugarfish in LA.

However, I think it's a rip off.\n\nI found them sneaky with their pricing.\n\nFirst off, right after we sat down, the server came and asked \"Would you like some edamame and miso? Would you like me to bring you one of each?\" Usually, when someone offers you \"would you like XXX\" like \"would you like some bread?\", it is assumed to be complementary service. And often times, edamame is complementary at Japanese restaurants. So that's what we assumed. However, we later found out this was not the case here, in fact they charged ~$15 for a bowl of edamame and \"miso\". This is the first time I've ever paid for edamame at a restaurant. The way the server posed the question was extremely misleading and never made us aware of the fact it was not complementary.\n\nWe were also confused what exactly he meant by \"miso.\" That's the first time we heard someone offering \"miso\" as is. Turns out, the server meant miso SOUP. Here's a tip - \"miso\" means fermented bean paste. So I assumed you meant your edamame comes with some innovative miso paste for dipping. Miso SOUP is what you offered me - a diluted bow of water with barely any scallions. Don't try to be too hipster when it actually makes no sense. Please study up on your menu and language. Do you say \"Would you like some soy?\" \n\nThen the omakase - nothing spectacular and some of the fish was so cold and a bit hard. I knew right away it was frozen then defrosted. Apparently our reservation was too early (5:45) that they haven't fully finished defrosting?\n\nFinally the bill... Turns out their \"omakase\" isn't a real omakase but a \"Let the chief just pick some items from our existing menu and give to you suckers who can't order yourselves\". Usually, the omakase menu comes at a particular fixed price and offer items not on the regular menu (that's the whole point of Omakase - to enjoy something off the menu). However, here every item on the omakase was charged SEPARATELY and it turns out, they just cherry picked a bunch of random items off their regular menu. Then what's the point of ordering omakase? We could've just ordered off your menu and actually picked items we liked. That's NOT the purpose of omakase/chief's special!", "author": "Sam C."}

I tried calling the restaurant and Open Tabling Akiko's for the next two days with no success of connecting to them.  This is not good news to a planner.

I completely get it, but I couldn't help but want to try.  Luckily, after some pleading with some of the kind Akiko folks, they made some magic happen to accommodate us at the scheduled time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-24", "description": "I'm just going to say it...100% the best sushi I have ever had in the city. EVER.\nLet's get it straight here, you are not coming to Akiko's to order rolls and chicken udon (oops, sorry...my inner snootiness is showing). I'm sure they keep these things on the menu to appease the general public but if you're going to shell out $$$$ prices you at least should know why you're paying the big bucks. You are paying for amazing quality fish and unforgettable nigiri. Yes, it's only one bite, but it's one bite you'll be thinking about for days to come.\n\nOur group of 4 was initially not planning on getting the omakase but the menu was a little difficult to navigate so we ended up opting for the omakase due to our insufficient sushi IQ. It was nice to just let the sushi chef do the thinking for us and sit back, relax and let the food magically appear on the table. BUT, lucky for you, I took diligent notes throughout the meal and now you can get the highlight of the omakase for 70% of the cost (yes, I did the math). Our omakase cost $120 (it depends on what/how many dishes they bring out) and you can have the greatest hits for roughly $80! Yes, you are very welcome!\n\nI've thought this out a lot...here are the must haves in ranking order:\n1. Ji-kinmedai (cold smoked golden eye snapper): I have never had or heard of this before but the cold smoke mild flavor paired with the mild fattiness of the fish...ridiculous. \n2. Otoro (fatty tuna): This one I did not see on the menu but it was heavenly...texture and flavor spot on\n3. Giant clam: Another one that was not on the menu but the texture had some bite on it and it had a mild sweet flavor\n4. Nama hotate (over-nighted fresh scallop): Crisp, fresh scallop at it's best\n5. Ensui uni (sea urchin): This was not your usual sea urchin, it was unprocessed and served on a spoon with rice. Sweeter flavor and less fishiness than your usual sea urchin.\n5. Sanma (pike mackeral): A little more of that fishy flavor but still smooth and not off-putting\n6. Managatsuo (silver pomfet butterfish): It has a light sear on it but even the raw parts have that smooth buttery flavor\n7. Salt water eel: Another one off menu, didn't have as much of that cloyingly sweet sauce so you could actually taste the subtle flavor of the eel. Different texture from fresh water eel.\n8. Kuro Maguro (black tuna): Really nice texture as far as tunas go. I'm less of a fan of tuna but this is definitely one of the best ones I've had.\n9. Kanpachi (amberjack): Good but less unique than everything else, it's all relative.\n\nExtra not nigiri orders:\n1. Hamachi kama was good and at only $15 it's a good way to fill up the belly a bit\n2. A5 Wagyu with truffle: This was a nice way to close out the meal but it has really strong flavors and textures. For the omakase it was $50 for 4, I would get it once for the experience but probably not again.\n\nOther throwaways on the omakase was an agedashi tofu and a salad with octopus on it that are not really worth having.\n\nWell, there you go! Consider yourself a professional nigiri orderer now although, I'll be honest, I mainly wrote this review for my own use so when I go again I can easy navigate the menu.

Do make reservations and try omakase, it's worth it.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I love getting omakase at different sushi places, we always like trying new and exotic fishes. We had a 15 different items and the nigiri was so fresh and good. The best ones were the Chu toro, Russian uni, scallop, local king salmon and kinmedai.  The uni was the best I have ever had, it was creamy and had no taste of the ocean. The Chu toro was so buttery and rich, it was perfect. Akikos ranks in one of my top 5 omakase  places. If you love fresh nigiri and sashimi this place is worth a try! \n\nTotal for 2 with tax and tip: $249", "author": "Stella J."}

In the past I've been to places which I felt were good, but they're in a different category. I always thought it people were exaggerating when they would talk about melt in your mouth, tender sushi. Now I know they are not. I got the nigiri sampler plus a couple of other items and everything was so fresh and full of flavor.\n\nI will definitely visit again.", "author": "Gerry M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-23", "description": "My inner paranoia came out when we initially entered Akiko's because I was convinced they were having a good laugh at me. I must have walked past the windows of the restaurant at least half a dozen times trying to find it since they have no exterior sign. If you're having any trouble searching it out - just keep an eye out on the street numbers and look for The Irish Bank sign!\n\nWhen we finally did find it, they asked if we had a reservation. It was a Thursday night... and they were very, very busy. My advice to you? Regardless of what day of the week it is: MAKE A RESO. Fortunately for us, they were able to squeeze us in (albeit next to the bathroom). The interior decor was very clean and simple (the art on the wall was gorgeous, though and really stood out against that exposed brick). Seems pretty trendy and hip here, too.\n\nDrinks:\n- Iced Tea: They ran out. What the... HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF ICED TEA?! Tsk. Tsk. I've read through other reviews and it seems this is a common problem. \n\nEats:\n+ Edamame ($4): Pretty delicious, standard edamame. Can't go wrong with this! Just make sure you're putting the sucked on pod in the discard bowl if you're sharing with a friend (sorry, Emily C!).\n+ Tamago ($5): Egg omelette. My first time trying this anywhere and it was surprisingly dense and delicious. Definitely excited to try this elsewhere now that I know it's veg-safe.\n+ Kappa roll ($4): English cucumber with sesame. So refreshing!\n+ Avocado roll ($4): Avocado with sesame. Can't go wrong with avocado!\n+ Futo roll ($6): Egg omelette, avocado, cucumber, spinach, with sesame. It was like taking the aforementioned three things and putting them in one roll. Again - so flavorful and hearty.\n\nUsually I'm still hungry after what seems like a bounty of sushi, but not here. This was plenty of food for this little pig. Oh, and on a side note,  I think the prices here are awesome. I'm used to MUCH more expensive, less delicious sushi on the East Coast. So - right on!\n\n+/- Service:\nA little spotty; they got our food out insanely fast but seemed a little disinterested in us as customers. Took some serious work to get their attention for water refills and our check.", "author": "Steff D."}

You can show up and wait for no-shows and obtain a seat that way too.\n\nWe ordered:\nFried Ika ($8)\nSaba Shio Yaki ($11)\n12 pcs sashimi ($34)\nKanpachi sashimi ($23)\nKuro maguro Akami ($15)\nKuro Maguro- Otoro ($25)\nNegi Toro sushi roll ($20)\nUni ($9)\n\nThe slices of fish are very generously thick. The only thing I have to complain about besides the rice being a little too hard/distracting with it's brownish color is the uni we got. This was my first time trying uni and we watched the sushi chef take the last piece from the box that was very slimey and put it on the rice and for the other he grabbed a brand new uni piece from a different box that looked more fresh. I didn't want to complain or ask about it because sushi chef knows best... (see pic) \n\nMake sure you get the Nama Selection menu (that's where the premium stuff is). We didn't know about it until the sushi chef told us. They serve you the sushi roll last so you have room in your stomach to order more nigiri/sashimi or to prevent you from being too full to enjoy the good stuff.\n\nService was good even coming from the sushi bar. I think we had more fun sitting there than a regular table because we got to order whenever we felt like it and watched the chef meticulously slice the fish and prep the other orders.\n\nThis place isn't authentically Japanese but they do get all their fish from Japan so it's very fresh.", "author": "Lauren K."}

It's been a couple weeks since my phenomenal birthday dinner...and I'm still dreaming of sushi, Jiro style.  Okay maybe not as masterfully and eloquently as Jiro, but I do still dream longingly for the sashimi I savored at Akiko's. According to my boyfriend, Akiko's is notoriously known for their practice of turning away folks without reservations.  Fortunately, he remembered to make birthday reservations for us (that's a big deal for him!), and we were seated at what we consider the best table in the entire restaurant.\n\nWe sat in a semi-private alcove at the front of the restaurant, near large window panes with natural, filtered light pouring in.  The hostess gave us a choice of sitting at the bar so we could talk to the chef during our meal, or a private table for quieter conversation.  This choice was most likely offered because we requested the omakase menu on our online reservation.  Service was top notch throughout the meal, and I appreciated how informative our server was when presenting each plate of nigiri.  It has been said many times before, but the fish at Akiko's is a step or two above the rest.  The fish is extraordinarily fresh, tasty, and served at the appropriate sea level temperature (this is not true for most other sushi restaurants).  Their attention to detail and commitment to simple elegance in plating and decor is so refreshing.  \n\nFrom the light jasmine tea we drank, which complemented the sushi so well without overpowering the flavor of the fish, to the carefully selected pre-seasoned plates of sushi with wasabi and different varieties of soy sauce layered into the rice, I could tell that Akiko's understands authentic Japanese sushi.\n\nOur omakase menu - stars denote my favorites of the night :)\n\n-Green salad\n-Agedashi tofu\n-Kani-age (fried soft shell crab)\n-Copper river salmon*\n-Shima-aji (mackerel)\n-Maguro (tuna)\n-Umimasu (trout)*\n-Uni\n-Hotate (scallop)*\n-Amaebi\n-Suzuki (sea bass)\n-Ume-madai (snapper)\n-Kamasu (barracuda)\n-A5 Wagyu with truffle garnish*\n-Red bean mochi\n\nOur bill was hefty ($210 pre-tip), but the experience was memorable in all the right ways.  Akiko's simply serves up the best sashimi I've ever had.  We will be back again!", "author": "Brittany N."}

My husband and I shared the sashimi sampler, which was simple, clean and varied, as well as some nigiri specials and a roll.  All were prepared well, including their house sauces.  I also liked that it wasn't very formal, where you wouldn't necessarily have to come for a special occasion and maybe even just after a day of shopping would suffice.  The place is small, holding about 20 ppl, so not great for large parties but maybe even appropriate for a double date.  The only issue I had was the service with the waitress(es).  I always like to hold onto my menu during sushi, so I could order as I eat, but seriously, every 10 minutes, a waitress would come by asking to take the menu.  I know I'm being picky but it did disrupt our meal.", "author": "Sheri H."}

I've heard such great things about Akiko's for years, I had let myself imagine so many incorrect details. There was no old man sushi chef, and no little old lady wife serving a few small tables - there were hipster white people cutting sashimi and searing fish. The place was not especially Japanese or traditional, but rather modern and new. \n\nAll the dishes were ordered were pretty good, the fish was really fresh and didn't leave me extremely hangry... just a little hangry. I enjoyed the food here, but it doesn't meet the hype. \n\n* SHRIMP TEMPURA ($8) - 3.5 STARS:\nLightly battered and flash fried, 4 piece tiger prawns with ginger broth. \nI typically don't like tempura but this was nice because it tasted like it was freshly battered and fried. The tiger prawns were on the small side, which ultimately was a good thing because it was delicate in texture. The overall taste was good but it wasn't mind blowing.\n\n* DEEP FRIED SOFT SHELL CRAB ($??) - 3.5 STARS:\nLightly battered and flash fried. This was delicious, fresh and tasty just like the tempura shrimp. \n\n* TUNA SHOULDER NIGIRI ($12) - 3.5 STARS:\nThis sashimi special was nice and marbled, it reminded me of Saru and Ichi because it was so overpriced, but comparatively the flavor and quantity was miles ahead. It was good, but I've still had better.\n\n* SASHIMI SAMPLER 12 PC ($35) - 3 STARS:\nThere were definitely highlights (trout wow), average pieces (salmon, yellow tail), and passable pieces (octopus so chewy). This chef's special is fixed, too bad....\n\n* RAINBOW ROLL ($??) - 4 STARS:\nThe rainbow roll was good, better than your standard rainbow roll (ahem We Be Sushi). It comes with 8 pieces and is decently portioned compared to most other Japanese restaurants in the city (ahem Saru, Ichi....). But again, it wasn't particularly mindblowing. To me a good rainbow roll is large, has fresh fish, and delicious sauces on top. It was good but nothing to return for.\n\n* SAKE FLUKE ($??) - 5 STARS:\nThis was a 5-piece roll, a concoction of radish, avocado, salmon sashimi and several items I can't remember, topped with unagi sauce. One of the favorites of the night. \n\nOverall Akiko's was good, an upscale sushi restaurant with fresh fish and tops other famous Japanese sushi spots in the city. Perhaps the thing to get is the Omakase (ranges $99-110). While I enjoyed my experience here, I don't think the value was there. I still prefer Wayo for something more traditional.", "author": "Jess C."}

The best sushi I've had in the city is Kusakabe - which recently received a Michilin star actually, and while Akiko's did not exceed Kusakabe, it was nonetheless *very* good.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered two rolls, the sashimi sampler, about 8 pieces of nigiri, and two plates from the kitchen and we were stuffed. \n\n- The agedashi tofu here is delicious and I would highly recommend it. The broth that it's served in is very light, has great flavor, and isn't too salty. The dish is served with roe, so if you're not a fan of it, you may want to pass.\n\n- Tuna here is great! We tried a few different cuts and each one tasted very fresh. The only nigiri that I wasn't impressed by was the scallops. Scallops were not as sweet as I would've liked them to be. Maybe next time. \n\n- King crab roll/friend crab: you must order one of these. Fried to perfection, and every bite will leave you wanting more.\n\nAkiko's does not break the bank so don't feel like you have to come here only to celebrate a special occasion. Get a reservation for sure, since you might be turned away otherwise.", "author": "Austin W."}

It's a small shop that serves premium sushi so it's pretty hard to get a reservation so remember to book at least a week ahead.\n\nThe first time I ventured to Akikos was lunch with my coworkers. I ordered the rainbow roll so I could try as much of their fresh fish as I could. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety I was served. It truly was a rainbow roll, and not the generic three fish roll you get at any other sushi place. \n\nThe second time I came to Akikos was with my parents visiting from out of town. We ordered the special fatty toro sashimi. SO FRESH & BUTTERY DELICIOUS. We also ordered a few different rolls including the rainbow roll. This rainbow roll we received was completely different from the first. Though I was a little disappointed at first, I actually ended up really appreciating that their rainbow roll is always just a variety of their fresh selection of fish for the day.\n\nThe last time I went was for my birthday Lunch with my office. We ordered the omakase. Everything served, from the sashimi to the nigiri to the specialty rolls was amazing. I tried so many fish I had never really seen before on a menu anywhere. I'm not an uni person and I was hoping that trying the uni here would change that, but I guess uni is just something I will never grow to appreciate. But to each their own!", "author": "Nancy T."}

I came in here for lunch and saw that the menu had quite a few sashimi and nigiri options that I was unfamiliar with.  I asked the waiter to recommend some things for my friend and I to order.  He recommended a few pieces of sashimi, and so we agreed.  We didn't know how many pieces would be reasonable, so we asked him to recommend some.  He asked us a couple of questions about any allergies or dislikes, and then determined some plate to bring to us.  \n\nOverall, I was not impressed with the quality of the fish.  Some of it did not taste fresh at all and it was not particularly flavorful.  Additionally, the waiter recommended way too many pieces for a lunch order, and when we realized this and asked to cancel the last plate of 3 bites before it arrived, he said we could not.  At no point during this process did the waiter notify or warn us of the price, nor were the prices listed on the menu.  Given our obvious unfamiliarity with the menu and restaurant, the waiter should have informed us of the high prices.  We ultimately received the bill and it came out to over $200 for two people.  We felt robbed after this experience for mediocre fish and essentially dishonesty by the waiter.  We trusted the waiter to make a reasonable recommendation for lunch, and he basically sought to maximize his tip without regard for our wallets or appetites.", "author": "Radha K."}

Three of us were craving sushi and fortunately my wonderful man dates have frequented, and we happen to all work, in very close proximity to Akiko's. We came close to lunch hour closing so there was no wait. First thing I noticed was how cute the place is. It's tiny, narrow, and you would probably pass it a hundred times without noticing (those are my favorite kind of spots). Very clean and nice overall, props on the Aesop hand soap in the bathroom (but no mirror... weird).\n\nFeeling indecisive, we opted for omakase, but with a special instruction to keep bringing out more until we decided we were satiated. Three different kinds of uni, shrimp, tuna, salmon, more tuna, more uni later, we pumped the brakes. The fish was so fresh. I couldn't get enough.

At an identical table for two. At this point things were getting silly and if it wasn't still pouring down outside we would have left but we took our seats, in different parts of the restaurant. \n\nEventually after promising that we'll pay on two separate checks, we were allowed to sit next to one another.

Fish was fresh but the rice was on the cold/firm side. Miso was also available and was good. However the price was definitely not worth it. You can find better for a lot less.\n\nThe one star is for the decor. That's the only thing this place has going for it. It's all lovely wood. Even down to the bowls and chopsticks.

Another server stops by later and tell us that they only have the tall bottles of Asahi Black. We say, okay that's fine, we'll take one of that instead. A third server comes back and pours us our beer while we were talking. He finishes and I look at my cup and realize this is not Asahi Black but just regular Asahi. This is extremely annoying, and shows the disconnect and lack of communication amongst the staff here. I don't mind paying a lot of $ to eat good food, but if I'm spending that much, I do expect the restaurant to have their $h*t together. This was not acceptable, but they remedied the situation by taking away the regular Asahi and bringing out two short bottles of Asahi Black (because they only have this size in the Black). \n\n2) Omakase here is \"AQ' - based on what's available that day. I guess that day was a sucky day because although there were a few great pieces, the overall meal experience was extremely subpar. I was not satiated and desired more, so I ordered more a la carte. Even that was disappointing. What probably made everything worse was...\n\n3) There were flies throughout our entire meal. It was the weirdest (and alarming!) thing. They were small -- bigger than fruit flies, kind of like a gnat. And they were buzzing around our face. A shoo here and there, and I figured I could get over it. But when it was landing on our plates at the end of our meal, that really killed everything for me. What's worse was that it wasn't just one or two. There were 5 flies in my glass of beer. And not just hanging out on the rim, but inside my glass, currying around. I was livid, and tried my best to not make a scene. I showed the third server the glass and he gave me a half-hearted apology.\n\nWe spent $300 that night for the worst meal ever.

Even the fresh wasabi and the housemade ginger were delicious.  However, it is hefty on the wallet compared to some other quality omakase, and service was incredibly slow.

I'm still a novice in the non-lunch special sushi offerings, but there wasn't a bite that wasn't out of this world to me. I went with the Omakase, and really that is where my issues began. Omakase isn't cheap, and as such I was hoping to not only get great food but also great service. For whatever reason, the sushi chef just didn't seem to want any part of dealing with me. His explanations were short and any followup questions lead to answers with attitude. I take fault with perhaps not being as vocal about wanting more knowledge as a Omakase neophyte, but I just never felt welcome at the counter. I've been fortunate to have experienced Omakase in NYC and also Washington D.C. and in each of those experiences the sushi chefs went out of their way to make a newb like me feel welcome.", "author": "Eric W."}

I sat at closing time at the sushi counter and ordered many things. I also came back the very next day at opening time and sat at the sushi counter as well.\n\nFirst off I will start by saying that I don't think this restaurant is only two $$ in price. It's definitely more expensive. For just a party of 1 (me) my bill was $100+ on the first night. Yes, this was partly due to the fact that I didn't realize the kinmedai sushi was $20 for two pieces and I ordered 4 pieces (whoops). Even though it's outrageous to pay $40 for 4 pieces of sushi, kinmedai is my favorite, so my bad. \n\nSecondly, I have to mention how hard I laughed at the crowd that dines at this place. They are the white people crowd that think they are sushi experts AKA they had a California roll one time 4 years ago. When I hear someone ordering rolls with pride, my blood boils. I shrink in my seat and whisper when I order rolls. I swear to you this woman came in, made a big deal about sitting at the sushi counter and then said \"I'll do the omakase - chefs choice and let him choose my sushi\". Then she said \"btw I don't eat\" and listed 400 things). She also then said how she definitely knows he can make her a good roll. Uhhhh. Omakase sushi at the counter DOESN'T EQUAL ROLLS. It equals a piece of raw fish sitting on top of rice, period. I laughed so hard I almost damn near fell off my chair. \n\nI ordered:\n+ Uni (just the uni over rice). He put this soy sauce glaze on the top and it literally melted in my mouth. It was one of the best pieces of uni I ever had in my life (now that says a lot).\n- Octopus sunomono - I'd pass on this. The scallop one was much better.\n+ Scallop sunomono - MUST. ORDER. Wowzers\n+ Tekka roll\n+ Kinmedai sushi - They torch it and honestly this is soooooooo good\n\nI can't remember what else I ordered. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Melanie A."}

Wandered in to be asked if we had a reservation, the answer to which was presumably quite obvious due to our casual attire and touristy exhausted looks. Of course we did not have one - so the host looked through his computer and found someone that was very late for theirs, so, voila, we have a table. Absolutely sensational experience. I crushed a ton of food, but also asked the waitress what she would recommend most and she provided a black cod dish that was to die for. Probably one of the best single plates I've ever had if memory serves. Wine list was on point as well. Tried again on a different day and no such luck. Definitely worth a stop if the space is available.\n\nOne quick edit - I didn't read the other reviews first, and now notice a lot of people mentioning price. My share was well over $100 for lunch and I do not regret a single penny. But yes, I ate a lot and we also had wine :)", "author": "Daniel M."}

Also, the staff seem to have this snotty attitude without justification.  On many occasions I've seen them turn customers away simply because they did not have a reservation, even though many tables were clearly empty and had nobody there/prior reservations.

If you want one of the coveted 10-12 seats at sushi bars like Sushi Zone, Tekka, and Yume, you sometimes have to wait up to 2+ hours BEFORE they even open. Been there, done that numerous times so while others don't appreciate Akikio's \"reservations only\" policy, I DO.\n \nAkiko is the only sushi restaurant in the Bay Area that I've been to that carries an array of very rare and exotic fishes like Keiji Sake Salmon (1 found in 10,000 catches), Kindai Toro (Sustainable Bluefin Tuna belly), and Russian Uni (Sea Urchin). Most are sourced from Japan. They even carry A5 Wagyu which only 2 other restaurants in SF that I know of do (Alexander's and 5A5). \n\nConsidering this, be prepared to forgo your first born or bring your sugar daddy/mama here for one of the most amazing omakases you'll ever have! What they excel in is their extensive uber fresh fish offerings so please don't come here trying to order teriyucki chicken or a bento box. That's what Sushi Rock and Kiki are for. Plus, you won't be able to get a true appreciation for what Akiko has to offer if you order such Americanized items. \n\nBeing located in the Financial District, Akiko is swankier than your typical sushi restaurant located in Japantown, The Richmond, and Sunset which is perfect for bringing a hot date or to impress a client. Definitely request a seat at the sushi bar when making reservations and entrust in the sushi chef to prepare a series of courses a la omakase that will woo your eyes and your taste buds. \n \nO M A K A S E\nOur omakase was $113/person but the price will depend on how hungry you are. You can always give the sushi chef a general budget and they can work around that. \n\nOmakase took over 2 hours because there was about 5 people doing omakase at the same time so don't come here if you're in a rush.\n \n*Tuna Poke Salad: http://bit.ly/Z00lhM\n*Kindai Toro (Sustainable Bluefin Tuna Belly): http://bit.ly/10GvRVr\n*Hamachi Toro (Yellowtail Belly): http://bit.ly/ZIpBeM\n*Umimasu (Ocean Trout): http://bit.ly/YaXTWM\n*Walu: (Wild Escolar): http://bit.ly/YaXT96\n*Kanburi (Wild Winter Yellowtail): http://bit.ly/13W1iQg \n*Tenen Hirame (Fluke): http://bit.ly/WHFiXc\n*House Cured Ikura (Salmon Roe): http://bit.ly/WnsxPg \n*Plum Snapper: http://bit.ly/10Gxjr4\n*Sawara (Spanish Mackerel): http://bit.ly/Z00CkO\n*Masaba (Mackerel): http://bit.ly/YnIkNM\n*Kuruma Ebi (Black Imperial Shrimp): http://bit.ly/13W0ZFo, Fried Heads: http://bit.ly/12PGtGN\n*Russian Uni (Sea Urchin): http://bit.ly/X74RMj\n*Ankimo aka Foie Gras of the Sea (Monkfish Liver): http://bit.ly/16s7mPT\n*Santa Barbara Uni w/ Quail Egg & Ikura: http://bit.ly/15MHVY7\n*Kinmedai (Golden Eye Snapper): http://bit.ly/15MHFbv\n \nEach beautiful bundle of a gem is brushed with an accompanying nikiri sauce and topped with a garnish (wasabi included). This is what seasoned sushi chefs do so that you don't go dunking your nigiri in a sushi pool and masking the delicate flavor of the fish. I gave Mr. NSS the evil eye when he attempted to do this. I'm trying to get my multiple foodgasm on so don't get us kicked out, buddy!\n \nI wish I could say I had a favorite but EVERYTHING was insanely fresh with a melt-in-your-mouth butteryness and a clean finish. I told the sushi chef that I hate Hirame (Fluke) and asked that he not include it on the omakase. He was insistent that I try his version. Okie, fine. Boy, let me tell you...the raw Hirame against the torched Hirame fin was ridiculously good. The torched fin gave a rich smokiness that was mouthwatering and was unlike anything I've seen prepared before.  Kudos for wildly creative nigiris.\n \nAfter slowly savoring 15 pieces, I was ready for the happy ending....\n \n*Drum roll*\n \nTHE A5 JAPANESE WAGYU: http://bit.ly/14X0sPi\n \nHOLY F*CK! Where has A5 Wagyu been all my life? Oh yah, chugging beer and getting massages since I'm not balling out of control and have no sugar daddy. The $25 for two pieces (included in the omakase) is worth every penny just to have every one of your taste buds luxuriously caressed by this holy grail of beef. \n\nThe A5 Wagyu is seriously the BEST thing I've ever put in my mouth though someone would pervertedly beg to differ.

The food was good and the service was fine, though a bit abrupt.  Sushi was high quality, and the prices were reasonable. \n\nThe reason for my terrible review is that when we received our credit card bill a few weeks later we realized that the restaurant had overcharged us by an even $100.00.  No problem, mistakes can happen.  However, all attempts to reach the restaurant to have this rectified have been fruitless.  I have called multiple times a day for two weeks, left numerous messages, and have not received any response.  We have also emailed the restaurant multiple times, and still received no response.  This lack of professionalism is very alarming given the amount of money we were overcharged.  Any respectable restaurant would at least have the decency to respond and make the situation right, but Akiko's is clearly not a respectable establishment.  Very disappointing. \n\nI highly recommend that you avoid this restaurant or you may be overcharged and ignored like we have been.", "author": "Steve S."}

Yes, that means the nigiri and sashimi take center stage over rolls.  If you want some legitimately fresh fish, you HAVE to come to Akiko's.\n\nAnd for a guy that has a serious toro addiction, this is exactly the spot.  Both the shiro toro and negitoro were pretty much as good as expected.  Extremely fresh, melted in my mouth, not much else I have to say.  And the uni...damn.  Seriously, I could pretty much eat uni all day and not get tired of it.  This uni was quite memorable and is a definite automatic selection.\n\nThe place itself is pretty small, but that's to be expected of San Francisco.  Especially in the back, everyone is crammed together pretty close.  I can understand that they need to fit as many people as they can, but it does make it a bit uncomfortable.  The bigger problem was actually trying to find the place, since there isn't even a sign with Akiko's name on it!  If I hadn't known the actual address, I would've kept walking around like a god damn headless chicken.  \n\nIn any case, now that I actually know where this is, I'm definitely going have to come here a lot more from now on.

The A5 wagyu nigiri was good but having tasted A5 in Tokyo, for some reason it didn't match up to my previous experience (maybe the transport diluted the taste =P). The nigiri and sashimi were also just meh. The toro barely had that fatty taste to it. All in all, would not go here again. I don't mind paying money for quality, but this place is not up to par with some of the other better Japanese establishments within the City or Silicon Valley.", "author": "Edison T."}

We decided to go with the omakase based on majority of the existing Yelp reviews.\n\nAmbiance: It is definitely a nice place to go for dinner, but keep in mind the restaurant is quite small.\n\nSushi: The sushi is quite fresh and i liked the three nigiri's that came from Hokkaido (scallop, shrimp, and uni) and the A5 wagyu. Those items were quite delicious, but the other nigiri's that were included in the omakase didn't really create a wow factor. Reading all of the existing reviews really put my standards sky high and I just wasn't that impressed. Maybe I came on a bad day? I don't know, but this dining experience definitely made myself think I'd rather go to another Japanese restaurant that offered a much better Omakase dinner.\n\nPrice: The grand total including tax and tip was about $250, so if you're not ready to splurge, then this is probably not a spot you would want to go to.\n\nService: The service was great and very attentive.\n\nTip: The sushi chef that served us suggested to come on a Tuesday or Wednesday because they usually received their shipments on those days, so there would be more variety for the Omakase dinner set.", "author": "Denise K."}

I knew better this time but I was itching for some yum-a$$ sushi!  Open Table said next avail was at 2pm, that was out of the question.  Me and my sissy walked over there with hopes and dreams of getting a seat without reservations.  This time, Allen (same dude as last time), didn't hesitate and said 1 second but within 45 seconds, we were seated.  SCORE!\n\nFirst thing I noticed, the cherry blossoms were gone gone gone.  It's now a blank canvas screaming and kicking for decoration or color.  Where did my pretty blossoms go?  Oh well.  I can live without them.\n\nWe ordered our favorite delicate CLEAN and SIMPLE tasting sashimi of sake, shiro maguro, walu, and Allen recommended an off the menu item, uni something but its translated as salmon trout fish.  Plus, we also ordered 2 orders of unagi nigiri and a rainbow roll.  \n\nHot damn!  All the sashimi pieces were so good.  The unagi nirgiri was warm and had a slight smoke flav to the top.  I believe the flavor and experience of their sashimi and nirgiri messed up our tastebuds for the rainbow roll.  Because the rainbow roll was wasted on our buds.  But I must give props to the way they make their rice, it was cooked perfectly.\n\nAfter we were done, the YIKES! factor comes into play.  The bill..oh the bill...the bill puts a dent in our wallets.  But for some reason, that doesn't stop us from attempting to come back.  But since then we placed a rule to our budget and limited ourselves from coming back once per quarter... or maybe every 5-6 months.  The strategy is to spread it out further to avoid the pain of spending so much for lunch.  \n\nSee ya soon Allen and Akiko!", "author": "Jenny T."}

I tried to make a reservation a week prior but it seemed like the restaurant didn't take reservations on weekends (there were consistently no weekend slots on open table). \n\nI got there at 7pm and the hostess informed me that they actually do take reservations on weekends, but it's usually booked weeks ahead of time. Regardless, it didn't turn out to be a problem; the hostess was super nice and was able to accommodate an 8pm table for my friend and I. We grabbed drinks at a bar close by and when we came back at 7:50pm, we were seated right away, which is pretty amazing. \n\nOur order was:\n\n(1) Saba Shio-Yaki (Mackerel)\n(1) Uni Nigiri\n(2) Spider Roll\n(1) Sake Roll\n\nWe shared everything and honestly, it was just the right amount for two people (my friend's a guy). We weren't stuffed (which I never aim to be), but we were both satisfied after the meal. Needless to say everything was delicious. The Uni and the Mackerel were the highlights of the night and the rolls were quite unique in flavor--I've been to many sushi places in San Francisco and around the world and I've never had anything quite like these. \n\nThings to note: \n- There is no restaurant sign and the sign above it is for an Irish Pub, which is confusing and made it somewhat tricky to find.\n- Akiko's is open for dinner between 5:30-9pm, so by the time we were seated, they were out of a couple of menu items. \n\nOverall, an excellent experience for both my friend and I.

Anyways, right after the last dish, we asked for the check and got it instantly. We paid it instantly and decided to chat for a bit to catch up. 5 minutes in, we got the \"there are two other parties with reservations after you.\" I have never experienced this at a Japanese restaurant and having given then nearly 20% tips on top of the 4.5% health tax, thought that was just not right. Worse yet is the reason why we thought it was fine to stay a little longer was because there were empty tables when I glanced over. So to summarize, food would be a 4, atmosphere is a 4, and service have to be a 2. Price is $$ to $$$. Reason why I say $$$ is because they price per nigiri whereas most places are for 2 pieces.

Also, I do think you could get out of there without spending a fortune if you watch what you order. \n\nThat said there were quite a few things I noticed at the bar that made this sushi spot seem not of the highest caliber. At any truly good sushi restaurant sitting at the bar is an interactive experience and you can really watch the chefs work their magic. I did watch and saw what I felt were negatives: \n\n-I could NOT get over that one of the chefs doing sashimi had what looked like dirty finger nails. I can't imagine he did .. how in hell could a decent sushi place have a guy with dirty nails working????? I looked at the other chefs.. their nails were totally clean. Could it have been from the fish? I just don't see how the fresh fish could have made the outlines and underneath his nails black. I just could not get over this.. three carafes of sake later I did get over it but I just can't understand. It was SO BIZARRE I wanted to say something but didn't see any GM around. \n\n-Sushi chef with dirty ass nails also had old rubber bands around his wrist.. I felt they shouldnt have any jewelry on (aside from a wedding wring) when handling raw fish. \n\n-Sushi chefs were swigging from snapple bottles. Why not put it in a glass and keep it at a certain class level? \n\nOverall from sitting at the sushi bar if the chefs could tighten up their visual and performance game to have a true high end experience it be a lot better.", "author": "Nala P."}

They served a chopped tuna belly marinated in 2-year-old, aged soy sauce that was soaking in applewood...what???? Yup, 2-year old soy sauce as a marinade. This makes the soy sauce not so salty and the flavor of the marinade really enhances the tuna. The fish sits atop a soft roll of sushi rice.\n\nOutstanding! really really fantastic.\n\nThere was also a second bite of slice raw tuna which was silken and also wonderful.\nIf I go out in the near future which, of course I will (!), and I'm in the mood for tuna; I'm going to make a bee-line for Akiko's Restaurant.", "author": "Joanna T."}

I am not sure whether I was at opposite ends of a spectrum, or whether one was more in line with the norm. \n\nAnyway, the pros: tremendous, memorable selection of fish (e.g. barracuda and some delicious marinated toro), and everything was very fresh and tasty. Also, not all that expensive, really. \n\nThe cons: the nigiri/sashimi was the only part of the menu that I thought was creative. The rolls I had this time were a bit unimaginative and only marginally better than the average sushi joint. \n\nThe first time I ate here, our waiter offered to make recommendations and I think he might have gone off-menu for some rolls. They were amazing and unique, and he paired them with other dishes to boot. This time, our waiter seemed hurried and did not offer (and I did not ask, which admittedly is on me). But then he forgot part of our order. \n\nAnyway, Akiko's is still quite good and worth making a reservation at, if you know you're going to in the area. I would definitely go back, and I'm still giving it 4 stars because even my second visit was really quite good.", "author": "Benjamin G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-22", "description": "Is it the Battle of the Akiko's? I keep picturing the competing chefs in ninja outfits having a mano-a-mano kendo stick match, probably on Claude Lane, in front of indifferent French diners I assume. Do they truly compete or is it more like the Battle of the Network Stars where they throw nerf balls at each other in a bouncy house? One Akiko is a modest, tight-fitting sushi bar on the lower part of Nob Hill on Mason. The other is this place, which is sleek, posh and also tiny. Or maybe the other place is the other place. Oh I don't know except this one does produce some mighty fine sashimi, sushi and nigiri, the standard delectables from my homeland. This is definitely not the Akiko's I remember from a decade back. No no, that one was a lot more like the other Akiko's.\n\nThis one places a lot of focus on a beautifully immaculate presentation with exceeding freshness. For what was supposed to be a leisurely lunch with colleagues, I was blown away. We threw caution to the wind and let the chef perform his magic for us. It started with a polished, rustic-edged board upon which laid a half-dozen world-class trios of sashimi slices - Umimasu (Ocean Trout, $4.50), Hara Sake (Fresh Salmon, $6), Sunazuri (Yellowtail Belly, $6.60), Tenen Hirame (Fluke, $8.10), and Kodai (Red Snapper, $3.60), and Kuro Maguro (Pacific Bluefin Tuna, $9.60) (photo: http://bit.ly/1jchNtW). Simple and ocean fresh, devoured by us in a matter of minutes like it was Chicken of the Sea which would be ironic since Charlie was a tuna, wasn't he?\n\nNext came the sushi starting with the jewels in the crown rolled in nori - a pair of the mouth-popping Ikura (Wild Salmon Roe, $4) and a pair of the impossibly luscious Ankimo (Monkfish Liver, $4.25), which I've gotten to know intimately at the must-go Ino Sushi (photo: http://bit.ly/1jJbrrT). The nigiri followed with a couple of Kuro Maguro (Chutoro) (Fatty Tuna, $10) and a couple of Kamasu (Barracuda, $6), a nice discovery for me and a new favorite (photo: http://bit.ly/1lHwrea). Arriving almost like a late-meal amuse bouche were two spoons of the Kan Kani (Crab, $5), perhaps the only slightly marginal taste of the bunch (photo: http://bit.ly/1jci6ow). But all was quickly forgiven at the end with the pair of Kuro Maguro (Otoro) (Tuna Belly, $12.50) (photo: http://bit.ly/1gVvG5F) and the pair of Managatsuo (Japanese Butterfish, $7.50) with dabs of liver on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1lHwyGK).\n\nWe kept the libations to a minimum with a $13 glass of the Omachi Sake (photo: http://bit.ly/1nxND8G). Yes, it was quite steep for such a small amount, but it has a subtle flavor infused with rice, herbs and anise that made for a smooth ride down the gullet. The check did give us an audible gasp, a total of $116 for the three of us, and as you can see from the price tags above, we are talking about fish that runs quite a cost range. I assume the Fatty Tuna came in chauffeur-driven fish tanks. Alas, that is the price we pay for the quality. You can always go to the nearest sushi boat operation or maybe some franchise like Sushi-R-Us if you are balking at our bill. But if you treat yourself on those rare occasions and you're not in J-Town, then come here. But for Akiko's sake, make a reservation in advance. Drop-bys are near-impossible. Or go to the other Akiko's if you're that desperate.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...world-class fish even if it is a lot of do-re-mi (...that's Japanese for \"I lost my wallet\")\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...small place but if you can get a table, you're in like bluefin (photo: http://bit.ly/1jB8eJB)\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very kind and serviceable wait staff\nTOTAL - 5 stars...best sushi in the FiDi...but make sure you're at the right Akiko's when you make that reservation", "author": "Ed U."}

There was something off about the sushi that day and it was a bit overpriced to be honest.  Ok let me back up... first of all the restaurant is difficult to find because there is no sign outside and it is very small.  \n\nWe did not order much food to be honest; just enough.  Spider Roll (see pic) - this was recommended by our server who strangely didn't really know exactly what to recommend to us LOL.  Tekka - was pretty good but the portion was a bit small and flavors were not bold.  They don't do the whole crazy sauce thing here like you might find at the more Americanized sushi places in the South Bay but definitely cleaner more subtle roll setups.  \n\nThe SAKE which was $10 had some pretty fresh tasting salmon which for sure was one of the better dishes out of everything we had.  Overall the service was very good, and it is NOT the worst sushi I've ever had.  I've had some really bad sushi in the south bay.  Shoot, I had worst sushi last weekend in SF.  I'll review the place soon enough, I don't even remember the name of it. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is nice and they play kinda cool music... we got stuck strangely in a claustrophobic spot in front by the window which I guess is more desirable location in SF....? not really sure haha.  Anyhow the highlight of the night was that Mike Epps was filming a movie outside the restaurant in the alley way which we had a clear view of right from our table, hehe.  I have pics of it.  \n\nWe later realized that we could have gotten a much more satisfying meal elsewhere for less money.  I joked around about it, but I think my friend took it a little more seriously than me haha.  I'm not a big fan of sushi unless its during the summer.  And for me it's often a question of how fresh the fish is.  If the ingredients in the roll aren't fresh, I try to stay away.  If the fish isn't good quality I'm never coming back.

But the service is so terrible that there's no way Akiko's is anywhere near multiple stars. They have a long way to go and a lot of inefficiencies that need to be addressed.   \n\nWe came here on a Thursday night with reservations. I noticed some people being turned away because they didn't have reservations. I also noticed that people were waiting in line when 2-3 tables were open just because they were reserved by people late for their reservations. Inefficiencies abound; they had maybe 4 bus-boys but only one guy taking real orders. \n\nIt took 30 minutes to finally get a waiter to come to us; we asked 3 different bus-boys to place or order but they all said they weren't waiters and that they'd call over the waiter. The one waiter would walk by avoiding eye contact and go to another table each time we tried waving him down.  \n\nWe ordered some entrees and some sushi, but sashimi took forever to come out; in fact our order of uni took 1 hour and 30 minutes. We asked the waiter once, and the bus-boys twice for our order of uni. Later on the receipt we were double counted for our uni. \n\nWe ordered two volcano rolls, one with fake crab and the other without; we explained that our friend was allergic to crab and didn't want to risk it (even if it was fake crab). The first volcano roll came out in 15 minutes, the second took an hour. When the \"crabless\" one came, it was the same as our volcano roll only they sprinkled the crab on top rather than frying it in. We explained that we didn't want to risk the crab-allergy but the waiter simply said \"it's just fake crab don't worry eat at and you'll see.\" Sure it ended up being fine, but there was no need for it to be sprinkled on top (when it's usually fried into the volcano roll toppings). \n\nThey offered the roll on the house, but they put a random $15 dollar roll we didn't order on our bill anyways. We didn't check our bill close enough; we caught the double order of uni mistake but we didn't catch that they included a random roll into our bill. \n\nThe dining experience was from 7pm to 9:30pm. Most of that time was us trying to catch a waiters attention, being avoided by bus-boys who knew they couldn't help us, and waiting for our single order of uni and crab-sprinkled volcano roll.  \n\nExtremely disappointed because what's the use of good food when the service is horrendous and the wait time is a few hours for fish to be sliced.", "author": "Jennie C."}

We will definitely come back on future trips to San Francisco. \n\nIf you love sushi, go, and omakase your heart out.", "author": "Ryan J."}

There was maybe one or two friendly faces the whole time we were there.\n\nAnyway, small details like when one of the waiters were setting our table, he rudely picked up my phone and set it aside so he could situate the sauce bowl ever so perfectly by the side of my plate. What place have you been that they're allowed to touch your property without asking??? Unbelievable. And he kept coming back to adjust my sauce bowl whenever I moved it. Come on.\n\nI was steaming already.\n\nThe other waiter and the busboy were quite friendly and the food was expertly crafted. However, when you piss off your patrons square off the bat, it's hard to not see red for the rest of the time. \n\nI ordered everything I wanted to taste and it was masterful and divine.

We ordered the omakase and it consisted of a plethora of selection from Japan including two types of uni, wagyu beef, aji, and much more.  The omakase also included a beautifully done black cod which was done in a way that I have never tried before in a Japanese restaurant.  The restaurant is small and intimate and they were great to accomodate our little one.  What I was surprised by was the rolls weren't that expensive ($10 to $12).  \n\nI'm giving this four stars instead of five because 1) the food took longer than expected, there were times we were waiting for half an hour it seemed for the next thing to come out and 2) when we asked how much the omakase costs, they said starting at $100.  That could be a bit scary, as you don't know how high the price can go to.  Basically they just serve you what you want from the special selections menu and price it that way.\n\nI thought the type of sushi we got was probably better than Kusakabe and if I were to go all out on getting some delectable sushi, I'd most likely come back here.", "author": "Pierre L."}

We have been to Koo in the Sunset 3 times, our No. 1 favorite sushi restaurant for years.  We love you Koo!  And then we went to the beautiful Wako, a new, small sushi place on Clement.  Last weekend we went to Kusakabe which is also new.   It is a kaiseki style restaurant that we just adored.  Elegant dining with a emphasis on great fish.\n\nThen last night we returned to Akiko on Bush.  I have to say it was really a great night!  Before we got there I had decided to try at least 1 of their cooked dishes but then as we ate one incredible fish after another, I realized I was enjoying all the nigiri too much to stray.\n\nWe sat with Chef Geoff again and he thrilled us with his omakase!  LOL.  We started with amber jack and a succulent Hokkaido scallop.  It always best to start with really good fish and we did!  But it was at the 3rd bite where he had us.  It was a tasty bite of Japanese Blue snapper, aodai, with a salted cherry leaf.  It was really blue too!  LOL.  We loved it. And we loved how different it was.  My husband and I glanced at each other with the nod and we knew we were in for a great evening.\n\nIn fact much of what we had was so different.  Some were served cold, some were warm, all were put together with a twist.  Such interesting blends of flavors yet you could taste the so fresh fish.  Really gourmet sushi.\n\nMaybe the best all night was their house cured Ikura cups.  Not only were they so dramatic looking they were genius.  I will be dreaming of them for weeks.  The so fresh ikura was salty with the eggs just popping in my mouth. They cure the eggs in concentrated dashi and truffles.  But then they smother the ikura in shaved frozen ankimo.  This piled high savory confection was so creamy rich yet so light; oddly it did not taste that cold.  They freeze the ankimo in a \"super\" freezer (one of only 2 in California) at 82 degrees below zero and then grate it into an airy pile.  You have to eat it before the ankimo starts to melt.  LOL This over the salty eggs was just perfection\n\nAlso a delight was a spoonful of Hokkaido crab mixed with miso butter and lightly seared.  So good.  We had 2 kinds of uni, the first Hokkaido little yellow tongues and then later Russian uni.  Both great and so mild.\n\nAfter 16 pieces of nigiri, I cried UNCLE!  I could eat no more.  I was way too full and stayed like that till I went to bed. My husband on the other hand felt we should have had more!  LOL \n\nWe ended the night with a really big piece of A5 wagyu which was piled high with shaved truffles.  I think this is Akiko's signature finish.  And a perfect finish it is!", "author": "Kell M."}

First dish was spinach with an amazing sauce. Also had a scallop and cucumber salad - everything else after that is just a blur.

The decor, ambiance, quality of the fish, skill of the chefs and professionalism/politeness of the owner and staff is astounding. Never have I been to a sushi place that serves fish of this quality and, on occasion, special rare types of fish.\n\nEvery bit of fish they serve is so soft, fresh and has so much flavor. Not only do they serve incredibly high quality fish but, if you're lucky, you may find yourself there on a night when they have certain rare items on the menu such as the Russian Uni and the Keiji Salmon. I have never been an Uni eater but Akiko's turned me around. Their Russian Uni, and even their other types which they have frequently are so creamy and tasty that anyone could love it. One night there I asked the chef for a creative dish using Uni. I was given a Uni nigiri with salmon roe, a quail egg yolk and grated ankimo on top, absolutely amazing.\n\nAnother favorite of mine was the Keiji Salmon, a $140/lb fish that is found in about 1 out of every 10,000 salmon that is caught and has a higher fat content than toro! I had a few pieces of this and they also fried up the head for me. Definitely the best salmon I have ever eaten and quite possibly the best fish in general. It was so amazingly soft with so much flavor, I barely even had to chew it. It was so good that I even came back the very next night for another round. \n\nOne final thing you can always find there and is a must have is the A5 BMS10+ wagyu beef covered in sliced and shaved fresh truffle. A seared piece of only the highest grade beef covered with truffle slices and a mountain of shaved fresh truffle. Usually the last course you will have if you put yourself in the chefs hands and is absolutely incredible, and who doesn't like truffle?!?!\n\nAkiko's is an amazing restaurant, one of the few where I am continually astounded every time I come, my only complaint is that they have completely ruined my palate and as such I am no longer interested in any of the other sushi places I use to frequent. Their quality of fish, amazing staff and skilled chefs (especially Ricky) makes this restaurant an incredible place to be. For the best experience, sit at the bar and put yourself entirely in the chefs hands, you will not be disappointed (unlike some other reviewers below me leaving 2 and 3 star reviews when all they ordered was a rainbow roll and some shrimp tempura), even when the bill comes at the end, if anything you'll just walk out wanting to come right back!", "author": "Ian P."}

During the 30 minute, the adjacent table paid a check; a new table came in, and got served TWICE!\n\nSo here come the nigiri, pretty mediocre, except the monk fish liver and wagyu, which probably stood out due to the mediocrity of everything else.\n\nYeah then we got some hot dish like agedashi tofu and hamachi collar, AFTER ANOTHER 30 MINUTES! Probably longer, we lost count. It's ironic that all of us feels the salad on the side of the hamachi collar is superb, peak of this pathetic dinner.\n\nAnd this tormenting ongoing hunger got us a nearly $400 bill! With tip, we each paid $91. Oh damn I type with rage.\n\nSo whenever you think of coming, DON'T. Kusakabe, Maruya, Roka Akor... You name it. Anywhere with the same price level is so goooood in comparison to this one.", "author": "Jass C."}

Tucked into a tight hallway tricked out with lavish wallpaper on one side and gritty exposed industrial brick on the other, it can be hard to hear your companion on a busy night. However, that won't matter much because your mouths will be too full of scrumptious, pristine nigiri and sublimely tweaked versions of classic rolls to bother with conversation. The \"kitchen\" selection of cooked items offers the fanciest, yummiest battered fried squid and dreamy crispy fried sardines.\n\nThe specials menu features rarer versions of standard offerings (here you can find smoked mackerel rather than the usual vinegar cured stuff), plus treats like young barracuda and sea urchin.\n\nAttentive servers make helpful recommendations, & keep wine/sake/beer/water glasses filled.\n\nCan't wait to go back.", "author": "Sian K."}

We were not expecting Tsukiji Market deliciousness but were looking forward to what many have said to be one of the best sushi experiences here in SF.  \n\nUnfortunately, the only thing we experienced was disappointment.  I made the reservation through Opentable and noted that this was for our anniversary.  We arrived a few minutes before the reservation and the table was ready and in the front which was nice as it was more private and probably had the best view (street).  \n\nThe food:\nThe sashimi was definitely fresh, buttery, and delicious - included some favorites like blue fin tuna, yellow tail belly, and mackerel.  And there were a few solid sushi dishes (uni) served as part of the omakase but there were also misses.  Don't get me wrong, none were bad but some were just meh and definitely not worth the price paid.\n\nThe service:\nGood attentive service - quick to clear, explain dishes, refill water, adjust menu to tastes, etc but the service was slow and not fluid.  There was a 20-30 minute break mid way through the service.  Also nothing was done to make it feel special (as we noted it was an anniversary) - not even a \"Happy Anniversary\".  I am assuming the table assignment was their only contribution?  But that have been just luck.  Places like N/Naka or Craft in LA may have ruined it for us - they go out of their way to make the experience memorable.\n\nAt about $130 per person (no alcohol), I was not impressed.  The sashimi was the only redeeming part of the experience and the only reason I would consider going back.  But the slow service, unimaginative dishes, and lack of a truly unique dining experience will probably have me trying the other options in the Bay Area or going for the budget (but good) sushi restaurants.", "author": "Roy L."}

From the outside, it looked like your ordinary sushi restaurant. Which made me almost mad that he took me here when we could have just went to our usual go-to spot. \n\nBut once I sat down and saw the menu, I knew why. It's pricier than your typical sushi restaurants. But the price is really what you pay for. We ordered tuna sashimi and it tasted so fresh. It didn't taste frozen and thawed fish. But literally tasted like the sushi chef had just cut off the fresh flesh from a tuna he caught hours before the restaurant opened.\n\nBesides the sashimi, we also ordered the spider roll (very tasty, soft shell crab was crisp and not soggy), and the ika (calamri). The ika was my favorite. It was so addicting to eat, especially with my saporro.\n\nWe also ordered the uni but the server said they had run out. Which was a bummer because we've never had uni before and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Instead, our server recommended we tried the wagyu. And we were really glad we did. That was probably our favorite thing we ate all night. The beef was so tender and left your mouth salivating for more.\n\nOverall a good experience. Staff was very friendly. Place was very clean.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-20", "description": "It's a tough challenge trying to explain to well traveled sushi eaters why we don't have world class Tokyo Ginza style sushi in SF Bay Area. \n\nTo me the answers are obvious. Some of it boils down to lack of demand, and lack of talent, and even though people know about ordering omakase, the general level of sushi eating knowledge is actually not as high as that of other cities for destination sushi stops (e.g. LA and NY). Plus, not many of us have money coming out of our cornholio$ to be able to afford such supreme luxuries.\n\nToo many \"enthusiasts\" got pumped up after seeing Jiro Dreams of Sushi, then proceed to go to places like Ino Sushi to show off their knowledge. Particularly guys of a certain ilk, to impress their Asian girlfriends. e.g. I witnessed some doofus next to me at Ino telling his Korean gal that he Googled SF for the best sushi in town, and told her \"yeah right here, Uni sushi\", to which she replied \"uhh, it's INO Sushi\". I almost choked on my nigiri. Surprised Ino didn't kick his a$$ out.\n\nThe original owners of Akiko's handed the reins down to their son, who then decided to take things a different direction some years back. Suddenly the chefs are different. The vibe seems swanky, friendly to non Japanese, and the fish is SUPER DUPER HIGH END EXOTIC! \n\nAfraid of Ino, but want fish quality on the level of LA or NY's finest where you do not have to speak a lick of Japanese, but don't want to have to fight with Alice Waters or Chris Cosentino for a coveted bar seat at Sebo? Well then Akiko's is the place. \n\nThis might just be the best we have in SF (to compete with NY & LA).\n\nGet a reservation at the bar. If it is your 1st time, bring a credit card with a high limit, or a very thick wallet stuffed with a couple Benji's. Primo seafood of the highest exotic caliber, costs a pretty 24k gold penny and it's downtown where tourists run amok. You can take the reins yourself or you can just have the chef decide (omakase) which you may want to see the daily specials exotic fish they have (try not to faint when you see the price$). \n\nFrom 6/28, one piece nigiri each\n\n-Kuro maguro (akami Bluefin from Nagasaki prefecture). On par with the Kyushu Bluefin I had in Hong Kong. Meaty dorsal cut.\n\n-Wild Copper River King salmon. I try not to eat farmed salmon as sushi, but very hard to resist America's wild finest .\n\n-Kamasu (Barracuda from Mie Prefecture)\n\n-Aodai (Blue snapper from JP). Pristine white fish.\n\n-Shiro Toro (albacore belly). Does not taste like albacore. Beautiful knife cuts.\n\n-Ayu (sweetfish / river trout). Very unusual to have this as sushi. For shioyaki, get it at Sumika Los Altos. Quite excellent.\n\n-Hamachi belly (sunazuri). Shaved lime zest a nice touch on top.\n\n-Matsukawa Karei (flounder from Hokkaido prefecture), served with its seared fin (engawa) on top. Sexcellent.\n\n- Ensuii uni (unprocessed Hokkaido sea urchin kept in its original saltwater). \"A spoonful of sea butta, makes the medicine go down....la de da\"\n\n-Nama hotate (overnighted fresh Hokkaido scallop, never frozen). True original scallop flavor. This is what the ocean \"tastes like\". A light brush of preseasoned soy and a tiny pinch of sea salt does the job.\n\n-Ji Kinmedai (single pole line caught alfosino from Chiba prefecture, cold smoked and light seared with a special salt on top / Moshio). Very very nice take on this fish.\n\n-Black Imperial Shrimp / Kuruma ebi from Hokkaido prefecture (fried head, raw body). The fried head tastes like freshly fried shrimp chips from Indonesia (the good stuff). Haven't had a wild shrimp with intense flavor like this in aeon$. So good.\n\n-Kuro maguro chu toro (medium fatty tuna). Sublime. Umami indeed.\n\n-Hatsu Katsuo (spring bonito / Skipjack from Chiba prefecture). Great, would have preferred a bit more garlic on top.\n\n-Kihata (Yellow Grouper from Nagasaki prefecture). Daikon oroshi infused with yuzu juice, thin slivers of shiso/perilla leaf. Very interesting.\n\n-Aka Mutsu (red fish, light sear, ponzu, shio, fish liver from Chiba Prefecture). Very tasty. I love Japanese white fish.\n\n-Nagasaki Prefecture seared Bluefin (meat near eye socket) with Santa Barbara uni on top. It's like a m\u00e9nage a trois (or 3P as they call it in China or Taiwan).  \n\n- Russian \"Tokujyo\" uni from Kaigara island. This is the high end caviar of uni. Some think it's not worth it, but it's subjective. \n\n- A5 Miyazaki Wagyu (high end Japanese beef) seared with shaved French Black Winter truffles on top. One ounce of thinly sliced fatty marbled J-beef seared on one side, rolled up, and truffles shaved on top of it. It's like sending Anna Chapman over to Edward Snowden in a Ferrari to live in an underground castle with an unlimited supply of blow.\n\nI prefer Ino's rice a lot more, but the fish here is undisputed (comparable to Sushi Ta-Ke and Sushi Mori in Hong Kong even!). \n\nAn expensive \"happy ending\", but treat yourself!

Served at the right temperature.  Most places will put most of your order on one plate and bring it out.  What ends up happening is that the fish gets warm while all of that sushi is being made.  Akiko brings out your order course at a time.  That means you get the sashimi or roll or whatever you order pretty much right after the chef slices and plates the dish.  \n\nThe chefs are also quite thoughtful with how the dish is seasoned.  Two different house made soy sauces are offered.  One for Sashimi which is a lighter flavor and one for rolls which has a darker richer soy taste.  Most places give you soy that overpowers the sashimi.  The veg and salads are thoughtfully sauced and presented.  The blanched spinach is particularly good.  \n\nService is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They are willing to offer their opinion about what is good and will tell you good detail on how its prepared.  \n\nThey also have a menu of fish of the day from all parts of the world if you wish to explore and spend a bit of money.  \n\nPretty much everything I had was good and I got to eat some new fish.  Barracuda anyone?  (Super good BTW, but leave it to the pros to prepare, it can be poisonous).\n\nI do wish they had some rolls and appetizers that were a bit more creative.  From what I did eat, I think the talent is there to make some interesting appetizers or seasoned rolls.  I am not looking for a massive menu, just a few more dishes perhaps as specials that showcases the creativity,  That is a pretty high bar, I know, but this place is not cheap.  Without alcohol we came close to $100 pp.  At that price level, I would expect to see a bit more of the chef's personality on the plate.

Where IS this place? I checked the address and it turns out that Akikos would be a great location for sushi entering the witness protection program; I was standing right in front of it!\n\nThe entrance to Akikos is below the sign for the Irish Pub and there is not a sign in sight depicting proximity to Japanese cuisine! \n\nAfter peering through the window, I was able to determine that numerous people eating rice-clad dishes with chopsticks was probably, in reality, NOT something I would find in an Irish pub, so I walked in.\n\nInstantly, the ambiance awakened my taste buds. The d\u00e9cor was simple, but attractive and comfortable. The sushi bar takes up the bulk of the tiny establishment's dining space, but the back dining room has a very cozy, warm feel.\n\nThe hostess is sweet, attentive, accommodating, friendly, and always smiling. I love it when customer service includes status updates to ensure your expectations are met. The hostess did just that. We were waiting for a table for about 15 minutes and she offered us beverages, review of the menu, and conversation about the restaurant while we waited. She also kept us very informed about the patrons who were supposed to vacate the table we were waiting for. Basically, she set the tone for a great experience.\n\nWe had yellow-tail hamachi, a variety of nigiri, warm edamame, a few tuna rolls (I did NOT like the \"burnt sesame\" flavor they deliberately put on those rolls. It was a hostile-palate-takeover), and chicken with rice. The food was nowhere near the caliber of Japonessa in Seattle, but it was good enough that we went back a second time within the same week. Unfortunately, the second time wasn't quite as good as the first, but it was still decent. The fish didn't taste as fresh as it did on our previous visit and there was a pool of water at the bottom of my bowl of Hamachi, which (no surprise) tasted recently-thawed or watered-down.\n\nStill, if I'm craving sushi during lunch time, I will head back to Akikos.

(Nothing special was done, so just a little pointer for everyone, don't waste your time writing in the little comment box, they don't pay attention)\n\nThe food: HORRIBLE!!!! If I had to choose between Akikos and take out sushi shops, I would so choose the take out sushi shop. The quality of the fish was hard to swallow, literally I was having the hardest time, The sake was the only thing helping me to swallow the horrible food.\n\nThe service, nothing to do with our server, he was very nice. But I think just how long it took them to bring out the food was horrible... I know we ordered the omakase but it was VERY long for each dish to come out (way too long for a birthday girl to wait) and as the minutes went by I felt sicker and sicker from the food. \n\nI really did want to like this restaurant so much. But for the quality and the price we paid. Heck no. We def got ripped off. I would never come back and pay $300 plus for their omakase again! \n\nNever again going to Akikos......Unless I wanna throw up.", "author": "Kayla R."}

Each experience has been just as amazing as the last! Always on the search for authentic Japanese food, especially fresh sashimi, I always know I am getting quality ingredients here. \n\nThey have a variety of unique rolls, and all of them are different in some way. The volcano roll is no longer on the dinner menu, but it is one of the most unique rolls I've ever had. The Forty-Niner roll is one of my new favorites, with a shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon sashimi and the most thinly sliced lemon. That little extra lemon zest on top of the salmon made for the perfect bite, and added something that a lot of rolls don't have. \n\nAll of the raw fish that they have to offer is amazing. I recommend ordering a dish in which you can get a good sampling of the different variety. My favorite is always some kind of salmon, but their toro is also great. The hamachi kama seems to have gotten a bigger portion size, but the fish is grilled perfectly and paired with a fresh salad and pickled vegetables. The ponzu dipping sauce adds a nice acidity to the moist, buttery fish. Even the skin is grilled to a crispness that makes you devour the entire thing down to the bone. \n\nThe dining experience at Akiko's will not disappoint, and if you're willing to pay for high quality food, then this is the place to go to again and again.", "author": "Ashley T."}

It is exactly the type you would expect at a higher end sushi house. \n\nI highly recommend the Sake Avocado roll ($7).

And after a week of binging on pork, all I wanted was that. The mixed green salad and the 6-piece nigiri tasting couldn't have been better for the situation. \n\nThe salad is light, and fresh, with cucumbers adding a bit of texture. The avocado is well-seasoned, and the soy-ginger dressing delicious enough that I want the recipe. \n\nThe nigiri was nearly impeccable; generous portions of buttery, clean fish, it was the absolute antithesis of everything I'd been consuming for the past week...and yet, just as delicious. \n\nI left thoroughly satisfied, and only having embarrassed myself with fish hanging out of my mouth once.", "author": "Peter D."}

After searching, Akikos seemed a good choice as a top tier sushi place without the formality of some of the other options. Needless to say I left deflated. \n     The reviews insisted a reservation was necessary so I procured mine and waited anxiously for a week to be slapped in the face by the sushi gods. Also from the reviews, I imagined being overwhelmed by amazing service and only having to say \"omakase\" to the chef to get this party started. From start to finish, my every expectation was insanely incorrect. \n    First I waited out front for the restaurant to open and my 5:30 sushi bar reservation. As the gates open a handful of people came in. All without reservations and all sitting next to me at the sushi bar  So much for that reservation thing.  One guy even strolled in on his work break and sat down next to me. \n     At a sushi restaurant of this caliber, I imagine an old Japanese chef who has been doing this for years. Not so much. My chef was a young white guy that had just started the week prior. I have been getting sushi for 20+ years and never have had anything but a Japanese chef. Not that it's a big deal but it was a little surprising....I guess. \n     After getting my water I never saw a server again. I was interested in some help navigating the sake menu but my menu was taken and no one checked in on me afterwords. I just asked the chef who I ask about drinks to and told him to just get me a beer.  Grrr. Lame. \n     After all this I was hoping just to yell \"omakase!\" and have all my negatives subside. So I did. I was told they don't do that. Hmm. He said just tell me a few things I want and we will go from there. So I did. He said I misunderstood. WTF is going on here?!! He explained he would just pick some sushi and \"walk me\" through the menu.... I thought that's what I asked for? Blah. \n     The sushi was all fine. I never got any of the crazy high end stuff even though I requested it. No wagyu, O toro or grouper for me. Must have not been my day. $175 later, I used my ride home to be extremely pissed. Not that the food was bad, just the experience. For this kinda money I want to be wined and dined. Not feel like I'm hanging at my local bar for happy hour and friendly conversation.  I guess if u just walk in without reservations or expectations you might be satisfied. But for me, if ur restaurant is on all of the \"best of the best\" lists, u better bring it.

However, I was warned that Akiko's Restaurant is pretty much popular for its location -- not its sushi. It was a little too late to cancel, so we decided to try it anyways. \n\nWhen we arrived, the atmosphere was confusing. You could tell that they're trying to make it feel sophisticated with the candles and interior decor, but it was a cramped and crowded space. Not exactly a place I would have thought to book well in advance. \n\nWe were left to explore the menus on our own, which had a limited selection at quite the high price. The four of us decided to get a bit of everything to share. I ordered a nigiri duo (with teriyaki beef) and a wakame salad. My friends ordered salmon teriyaki, saba, fried squid, and a few rolls. \n\nThe wakame salad was good, if just a bit salty. The assorted nigiri and saba tasted very good. However, the cuts for the nigiri were inconsistent. They should not have served a nigiri with a brokenly cut piece of akami. The salmon teriyaki was good, and the beef teriyaki was even better! Very tender and soft. The rolls were average. The 49er was actually terrible because adding too much lemon completely covered the taste of anything else in the roll. Despite having a decent slice of salmon, I could taste nothing but lemon. The fried squid was average too. We found the food overpriced for the quality. Sure, the quality of the fish is great, but good ingredients do not always make for good food.\n\nService was just bad. We kept getting food we didn't order brought to our table. They weren't able to read our confused faces either. We had to explain to them that some foods aren't ours. Two of our orders never came, so we had to ask about them. Perhaps they got taken to another table! After that, we mistakenly received a duplicate and after table's order. Get it together, Akiko. \n\nWhen the fried squid finally showed up, the waiter apologized for the wait and said that because of it, this dish was on the house. That's nice. Then maybe ten minutes later, a roll finally shows up after waiting forever and they didn't put that on the house. It was the same waiter too! I wonder if he thought that to be odd -- not putting the even later order on the house.\n\nBy the end of the meal at Akiko's Restaurant, we were all undoubtedly disappointed. They were right -- the pricy food tastes average, but is in a good location.", "author": "Jessica F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-10", "description": "Before I start this review, let me say that I'm a harsh critic when it comes to sushi. i've eaten my fair share so I'm just a little bit more picky when it comes to fish. You can say that the bar has been raised and Akiko...well they definitely jumped, but they slammed themselves right against the bar. I came here with two of my friends and you probably already know how we do. OMAKASE SON!  (actually we never intended on getting that, but right when we got there we were like...dang it. YOLO)\n\nAtmosphere:\nThis place was poppin. It has two rooms in which one where you can sit near the bar and the other which is in the back that looks like some James Bond movie where you are chased down an alley way with hooligans about to shoot you in the face. But the ambience here was nice and I was definitely digging the decor. They get 4/5 from me on the layout of the room.\n\nFood:\nWhat can I say? Service was great, the chef himself was awesome (he even reminded me of a samurai warrior the way he maneuvered his knife around), and the timeliness of getting our fish served was great! I really enjoyed the spread of the food, however the one thing I will say is that certain pieces tasted a lot better than others. It wasn't that it was bad or anything, it just wasn't the best out of the best. I think a better way to put it was that the quality consistency of each fish was just not there. We ended up eating about 12-15 pieces I would say and I definitely enjoyed it. I would highly recommend getting the Japanese Uni over the Santa Barbra. Not that I tried it, but the Japanese one was just so on point that it was amazinggggg. It also came in a wooden spoon. Hipster shit. That's all I gotta say and it definitely gives a +5 to the taste. Oh apparently there was a beef wagyu that looked really yummy that I didn't eat. It had some truffles stuff on it. Get it.\n\nPrice:\nPrice is consistent on what you see from San Francisco. It's most definitely more expensive than Seattle. Seriously it is. Just don't think about it when you eat it. It's all part of the experience and if you wanna eat Omakase...well you gotta pay to play or you're not even in the game.\n\nOverall this place was cool. I really enjoyed the ambience, but I've definitely had better and there are better places in SF for Omakase. I just wasn't completely satisfied by the time I left the place. Is that weird?

It's easy to miss the restaurant from the exterior but it's a quiet and exceptional meal.  I tried the aji (mackerel) which has become my testing staple at sushi bars and I was very pleased.  Each piece served individually to allow all guests to receive some food was tasty and prepared without the need to drench the food in soya sauce.  The nigiri pieces were in the smaller side but the rolls larger than excepted.  I will certainly return and probably have the omakase next time.", "author": "Greg L."}

I just wasn't overly impressed! We ordered a few rolls and sashimi. The first 49er roll that came out was actually prepared differently than the second order. The two other gfs I was with noticed since they had dined before here. It was really slow yet it took long and the rolls came out staggered. What was odd was they were really annoying about taking reservations when it was 11:30am on a holiday week. I feel like they keep that air about them which I wasn't impressed with.\n\nNonetheless, the rolls were good. We also had the Rock n Roll roll which was pretty good - prices were average but I feel like I've been elsewhere and it's more bang for your buck. Sashimi was tasty we had a 6 piece order and I found that on the slightly pricier than most. \n\nThe sake was so not impressive! We ordered a large and another small between the three of us - granted we wanted to drink! It just felt so dinky it came in this clay pot so it was extremely deceptive in size. Our total was a little over. $90/3 and I feel like I've just had better despite the fact the quality was good.\n\nRyokos is better!", "author": "Priya S."}

It's located a block down from the Chinatown Gate on the corner (next to the alley) where the sign for the Irish Bank is located. Since it is downtown, there's only street metered parking or paid parking garages. The restaurant is tiny with only a few tables and bar seating. For dinner, walk-ins that night were all turned away. So get reservations, and get them early! We went on a Thursday night and all the reservations were taken except the one I managed to grab early that morning.\n\nWe came here to celebrate my friend's birthday a little late since we weren't able to see her on her actual birthday. She wanted sushi and this restaurant is easily BART-able as it's about 2 blocks from the Montgomery Station.\n\n~~ Our Order ~~\nEdamame: $3\nAgedashi Tofu: ($9) Fried House-made Silken Tofu, Roe, Dashi\nNigiri Tasting: ($23) 6 pcs\nRainbow: ($14) Fresh Crab, Selection of Fish, Avocado, Cucumber, Tare\nBeef Teriyaki: ($13) Cubed Niman Ranch N. Y. Strip in Teriyaki served w/ a bowl of rice\nTekka Maki: ($12) Tuna, Scallion, Avocado, Crispy Shiso, Pickled Carrot, Sesame\nMebachi Maguro: ($9) Big Eye Tuna nigiri\nSake Maki: ($10) Fresh Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Yuzu Jalapeno, Tare, Toasted Sesame\nOkuden Kantsukuri: ($10) Mirror of Truth\nShizengou: ($11) Rich, Deep Aromas & flavors of Hazelnut, White Pepper & Mushroom\n\nPortions are small but of high quality, so I wouldn't really come here starving unless you don't mind spending a lot of $$. When we were first seated, we were asked for drink orders and if we would like edamame while we waited for another friend to join us. Take note, the edamame is not complimentary. We weren't told this unfortunately and I find it odd that such a high caliber place would charge for it. For sake, get the Shizengou if it's available (it tends to sell out).  I'm not a fan of sake because of the strong alcoholic burn afterwards but this one is so smooth! We didn't taste the hazelnut though which was why we ordered it in the first place. Initially our waiter had told us that it was sold out but he somehow was able to find some for us. It wasn't a full glass but at least we were able to taste it and we were so glad that he did! Definitely will order again next time. We had ordered the Okuden Kantsukuri since the Shizengou was out as suggested by our waiter. It was good but definitely not as good as the Shizengou.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the agedashi tofu. I liked the broth for the agedashi tofu, but personally, I prefer slightly more firm tofu. For an entree, I had ordered the Nigiri Tasting and felt that the fish was a bit on the warm side, so I was a bit concerned. However, the texture of each of the fish was so buttery soft! It was so good! The favorite roll of the evening was surprisingly the Tekka Maki because of the slight crunch from the crispy shiso. One of my friends just ordered it randomly too. The rainbow roll was good, especially with the fresh crab. The birthday girl loved her Mebachi Maguro. The meal definitely satisfied her sushi craving.\n\nService was very attentive, prompt and courteous. Dishes were quickly cleared away and water/tea were consistently filled.\n\nGreat place to go for a quiet date night or for a celebration. Highly recommend!", "author": "Kitty K."}

I came here and had the omakase simply because this is the best way to experience the skill level of the chef as well as the true ingredients.\n\nWalking into this place, the ambiance was awesome,discreet store front and inside, you have a cozy modern, chic decor. We sat at the bar, and had an awesome chef. Straight from Japan, it was great watching him at work putting together a variety of plates. I couldn't have asked for a better environment to spend time with friends, even the water pitchers were on point. \n\nNow, the food, was about average for me and that is the main driver as to why this place is receiving 3 stars. I love all types of sushi, and when it's good you know it is GOOD, but at the same time, it is very easy to tell the difference between the quality of fish you are getting. That being said, as we went through our different pieces, you could distinctly tell that some pieces were fresher and more flavorful than others. For me this is a problem. To be a top tier sushi restaurant in my book, you need to provide consistency across the board.  This in no way is a reflection on the chef, but rather on the ingredients he was given to work with. \n\nAlthough, this is listed as $$ on Yelp, if you are having the omakase, expect to pay pretty similar prices to other sushi restaurants. Overall, this place had good vibes, friendly staff and decent food. I will be back here to try some of the other dishes.", "author": "Alex L."}

My first time, I simply stumbled upon this place via yelp and didn't really have that high of an expectation until they surprised me by how traditional their techniques are.\n\nI grew up in Asia where Japanese food is everywhere, easily way better than places in the U.S, and tons more affordable. So it takes a lot for me to five this place 5 stars!\n\nThis time, I got the Omakase and spent $117 excluding tip - I honestly felt the price was fair given the quality of fish that was served to me.\nMy omakase included \n1. ponzu vinaigrette Japanese seaweed + smoked scallop - delicious, not only am I a big sucker for anything yuzu flavored, but this appetizer was balanced with sweet, salty, spicy, and sour.\n2. big eyed tuna poke + ponzu albacore - I didn't care for the tuna poke, I'm not a big fan of overly marinated sashimi and I also get this impression that poke is made with scrap pieces. But I was pleasantly surprised by the albacore. I normally dislike albacore since it tends to have a strong taste. The texture is leaner and stringier, if not sliced right, the fish tends to look spoiled. But the chef put it together nicely. Ponzu sauce was elevated by a few additions (one of which being ginger), and the albacore was garnished with chiffonade shiso which so I saw the chef chop himself. This guy has good basics!\n3. Cod & Ocean Trout - The ocean trout was fresh and good, but it's like salmon so I don't have a whole lot to say about it. But the cod was delicious! The chef had stacked a small piece of seared meat and added a very light smokey dimension.\n4. Santa Barbara Uni and horse Mackerel - Santa Barbara Uni was cream and delicious and I thought I was satisfied, but no, I later found out in my Omakase that there's an even better one.\n5. Shima Aji (Striped Jack) and overnighted Hotate (Scallop) - Besides uni, I also really love scallop, but I like it served in a very specific way - butterflied, dressed with yuzu, with a pinch of kosher salt. But today's scallop was different, not creamy and sweet like how I normally get to have it, but it was more like crispy! I suppose that is how fresh scallop taste like! The fibers are very distinct and separates easily as you chew it.\n\nOk you get the point there are actually 5 more courses after that which two nigiri sushis each.. But the biggest highlight of my meal was probably the Tokujyo Uni. I didn't think I would be able to tell the flavors apart from the different kinds of uni... oh but you can! Tokujyo is much much sweeter. Now I'll never forget Tokujyo Uni as my favorite kind of Uni.", "author": "Melody K."}

Chef Ricky will take you on a magical mystery tour of fishes you never knew you loved.  Over a period of at least two hours you will enjoy an endless series of fish and vegetables complemented by various innovative sauces.  You will be treated to an array of temperatures, textures, and cooking methods--all of which are awesome.  Don't hesitate; just do it.\n\nWhile the rolls are good, at Akiko's you should head straight for the sashimi and nigiri.  The monkfish liver is sublime. Don't miss it.  If you think you do not like urchin, try the Russian uni. Its delicate, creamy taste will change your mind about spiny sea creatures.  Rich and delicious, the keiji salmon has a higher fat content than toro and shouldn't be missed.  Toro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), unagi (grilled freshwater eel), saba (mackerel), sake (salmon), hotate (scallop)--all the fish is of the highest quality, perfectly prepared, and artistically presented.\n\nService is hit and miss.  The sushi chefs are great, but, while friendly and informative, the wait staff assigned to use would sometimes disappear for long periods of time.\n\nTips:\n\n- Make a reservation; do not try to walk in, as you will be disappointed\n- Skip the crowded dining room with its closely spaced tables; sushi bar all the way\n- Bring your gold Amex; the prices reflect the quality of the fish\n\nOverall Akiko's puts out some high quality fish at commensurately high prices.", "author": "CJ G."}

More details about that later..\n\nThere isn't a sign on the door, so make sure you look for the number 431 on Bush Street! If you are coming for their omakase, or to try the speciality sashimi/nigiri options off the nama menu, don't be an idiot like I was and come on a Monday. Fish deliveries usually come on Tuesdays, so there is much less selection available. And I was wondering why it was so easy to make a reservation for Monday night on Opentable. In any case, we decided to stay since we were already there, and opted to sit at a table in their dining area versus the sushi bar since we were a party of 3. The restaurant is pretty small, so reservations are highly recommended. We told our server we wanted the omakase, and he let us know it would take at least 2 hours. The restaurant is quite dim, so apologies for the ugly picture quality. Our omakase consisted of:\n\n-Poke ($9.16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA): Just ok. The tuna was fresh, but some pieces seemed a bit stringy. The soy sauce was also a little strong for my preference.\n-Sashimi: Kodai/Wild Tai Snapper ($4.40), Hirame ($5.50), Hamachi ($5.86) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#XxQVZ0fwlGwmiHyCH1pyXA) Australian Ocean Trout/Umimasu ($5.13), Seared Walu/Escolar ($4.40) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#wPXdrb-4YVtmHQvfTaTrrw): The hamachi sashimi was by far my favorite. I normally love escolar, but didn't like that they seared it- it gave it more of an oily mouth feel. Everything was really fresh though, and sliced well, although I didn't care for the kodai or ocean trout.\n-Ginger, Wasabi, Pickled Wasabi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#1TY3JjrVsCKZ1kLJu68PIg): The wasabi wasn't very strong, and the pickled wasabi was interesting but I didn't like it with my sushi. My friends liked it a lot more than I did.\n-Black Chu Toro/Kuro Maguro Nigiri ($9.16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#bUFdNQMmNMGfldCxVkn1nQ): Delicious, and almost melted in my mouth. \n-Hokkaido Uni Nigiri (From Russia, $10.99, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#LVmxZfE7hndCPEWT1aELCA): Yum! The uni was really sweet tasting, and very different from your normal uni.\n-Umami Ikura w/Truffle Nigiri ($5.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#f5Ike985hqmUjpeINqEqWQ): The ikura was delicious! I normally love truffle oil, but in this case, it overpowered the freshness of the ikura.\n-Hamachi Belly/Sunazuri ($3.66, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#GHgJlw0AQZpuwraSH7gLxg): Super good, and one of my favorites that night.\n-A5 Wagyu Nigiri ($11.42, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#wDrXMxhhnO2foBwtYR8Q8Q): I was really excited to try the A5 grade waygu, and this was good, but I wasn't super amazed. It was worth a try though!\n-Sesame Ice Cream? (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/akikos-restaurant-san-francisco?select=krdc8cCBl5AKukKttY6gzA#SCR22I2akDLNi2nNYDwWfg): Since it was my friend's birthday, they were nice enough to give us a complimentary dessert with sesame ice cream and some other components that I unfortunately cannot remember. \n\nOur server was friendly and informative, but would sometimes disappear and we would try and flag someone else down. For such a small restaurant, it was sometimes difficult to find someone to help us! Also, the table runners would deliver the dishes at times, and it was really hard to hear what they were saying/understand them sometimes. The worst part of the dinner was the bathroom incident- the sole bathroom stall is at the corner of the dining room, and there isn't much ventilation in there. Apparently, one of the workers had to go poo, and the smell wafted out and lingered for almost half an hour. Thankfully we were winding down, but it was an awful experience that I hope never happens to me at a nice restaurant again! Since a lot of their premium fishes were out of stock, the total for our omakase came to $82.24. I was full, but only because I had to eat some of my friend's portion since she had a really late lunch that day.\n\nOverall, I may still come back to try their speciality nama menu items, but will ensure I sit at the sushi bar versus the dining room with the bathroom!! Parking here can be difficult, but there are spots available for street parking, and it's pretty easy to find on a weekday night (especially Monday). However, the traffic on Bush can be heavy during rush hour.", "author": "Amy D."}

The first time I was taken here by a couple of awesome friends, one of whom knows one of the sushi chefs (now former). That experience was pretty unforgettable as we sat at the bar and indulged in individual plate after individual plate of delicately prepared and indescribably delicious bites of nigiri, dressed with fish, wagyu, shaved truffle, and other amazing elements.\n\nLast Friday, I returned with a couple of my coworkers, as one of them was leaving us to start her maternity leave. We decided we needed a GOOD meal and headed to Akiko's.\n\nThe restaurant is unmarked, so it's easy to just walk pass it, which I pretty much did. We got there at around 1:30pm so the lunch hour rush had died down for the most part. We were asked to wait a little bit as our table was cleared and prepped, and were pretty promptly seated by the street-facing window.\n\nInitially, service got off to a bit of a shaky start. We just sat there browsing our menus and waited for someone to come over and check in with us. A gal who seated us didn't really come back, nor did anyone else, and we had to physically flag down someone and ask if we can order. At a fine dining restaurant like Akiko's, we didn't expect that kind of service. They had a lot to make up to make the lunch spectacular.\n\nLuckily, things turned drastically around for the better once food started to arrive. We ordered Sake (fresh salmon) Roll, a salad to share, Kani-Age: Fried Soft Shell Crab, Nigiris (Hara Sake: Seared Salmon Belly; Ankimo: Monkfish Liver;  Shiro Maguro: White Tuna; Uni: Sea Urchin, Amaebi: Sweet Shrimp), the recommended Kampachi (Amberjack) head and collar, broiled and tasty.  \n\nThe salad was presented in a lovely fashion, even accompanied by tiny little lavender flowers, edible I guess since I ate them. There were tiny arugula looking leaves. Very adorable. The dressing was just right. Refreshing and a good accompaniment to the textures of the greens.\n\nThe Kani-Age (Fried Soft Shell Crab) was cooked excellently. It was lightly battered and crunchy on the outside, juicy, hot and delicious on the inside. We savored each tiny crab leg that was fried to perfection.\n\nAll of the Nigiri were delicious and the fish portions were pretty generous. The Ankimo pieces far over draped the rice, so you could really taste the liver flavor. The fish is incredibly fresh here, and the sushi chefs look like they're master artists while creating these creations. We thoroughly enjoyed each nigiri. The Amaebi came accompanied with friend shrimp heads, which was really crispy and the gushy brains tasted extra good. What a sin! \n\nThe Kampachi (Amberjack) head and collar was a good choice because as it arrived, all we could see was the giant eyeball staring up at us. Definitely photo-worthy right by itself! The meat was well cooked, and there were plenty to go around as we just dug into dish and shredded it to pieces. \n\nThe host was very attentive (far surpassing the initial hostess we had). He came to our table and explained each dish as they were delivered to our table. We were admiring the beautifully plated food, and he came over and told us not to let the sushi sit on the table too long because the temperature will change the taste. We quickly stuffed our mouths as soon as we heard that! \n\nAt the end of our meal, we were so satisfied with our bellies full of super tasty food. Akiko's was just as I remembered! For me at least, this is a special-occasion kind of place, but I think that just make each visit that much more memorable! See you next time.", "author": "Jing D."}

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Who doesn't enjoy a well-made rainbow roll and a glass of wine after a long day?\n\nSpeaking of rainbow rolls, Akiko's is tasty and well-portioned with lots of fresh fish. It is made with scallions, which I don't understand (SF sushi restaurants seem to really love putting scallions in rainbow rolls), so if you're not a fan of green onions like me, make sure to request no scallions. I also indulged and got some sea bream nigiri, one of the specials of the day. It tasted fresh but was a tad too....warm? Like it had been sitting under a lamp for too long. \n\nPrices are standard (not dirt cheap, but not exorbitant either) and service is decent. I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, but if you're in this part of FiDi, it's a good dinner option. Just make sure you make a reservation. The restaurant was full even on a Monday night.", "author": "Josephine L."}

I even cancelled the sushi bar reservation at Zushi just because a friend recommended you to me. I asked you for 2 things: please beat Zushi Puzzle omakase, impress me! (in writing) and asked for a little something small with a candle for his birthday on the phone. And you said yes! Guess what? You failed both miserably\n\nIn details: The food was good but not exceptional. It was much more expensive compared to the other $$$ sushi place... surprisingly when you only have $$ sign on Yelp. Or maybe you think it's okay to put whichever price on for omakase. I was honestly so upset that there was not even a little mochi ice cream with the candle at the end when the bill came out to be over $400 that all the little good things you present over the omakase meal was technically gone. And I couldn't ask for it since it would just be an awkward situation. Even at Zushi Puzzle, a strange guest who pays that much would at least have a spoon of strawberry sorbet just so you know, Akiko!\n\nSo 1 star for your waiter and another for your food! \n\nYour sincerely!", "author": "MS T."}

Wish the person taking the reservation would have let us know. Anyway don't make that mistake. We ended going to the other place and then coming right back.\n\nSo the sushi chef was nice. Omakase price was \"aq\" not sure what that meant...but it must be code for EXPENSIVE! We got a decent amount of pieces but I think if we didn't stop the chef our bill may have been out of this world. Unfortunately we couldn't get a reservation for Kukusabe so we ended up here.\n\nSushi was well prepared, we liked the fact that the chef dresses the pieces so we don't have to worry about soy sauce etc.  None of the pieces really wowed us like other sushi restaurants we've tried in southern cal. But they were unique pieces including sardine, baby yellowtail etc the Uni and toro was ok also $25 for two pieces. Shima Aji was my favorite.\n\nService was good and people were friendly.\n\nThe bill was the shocker. Didn't expect to pay as much as we did for a fairly par tasting of fish. We had about 12 pieces and we're still hungry. We didn't even order alcohol.\n\nOverall...it's not a mind blowing experience maybe for the first time sushi goer but if you are a sushi lover don't expect anything amazing.", "author": "Simon S."}

We added a couple of rolls (chef's choosing), the Russian uni (which is A MUST). \n\nThe omakase consisted of EXTREMELY FRESH direct from japan over-night-flight fish. They were all exceptionally delicious and fresh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-07", "description": "Sushi is special occasion. It should be. No one should eat that much fish consistently. It can lead to a myriad of health issues. When I go eat sushi, I go to the best I can. I spend the money to ensure the fish I get is from waters that are clean and handled by professionals. The advent of the All You Can Eat sushi factories and Sushi Boats spots have inundated us with mediocrity disguised as authentic. In the Bay Area, when I do sushi I go to Sushi Ran, Ebisu, Hanna Sushi, and Akikos. Let's focus on Akikos shall we?\n\nSo I'm going down the current reviews for Akikos. Solid reviews except this one from Lily T. Lily, you are an idiot. Anyone who compares Akikos fish to Bobo is a food noob. I take your review with a \"whatevs\"\nI have a sake bomb waiting for you at Ozumo. \n\nLet's just let it all be known, Akikos is not the same without our brother Ricky representing. It's not worse it's not better. As far as Ricky is concerned, It's like when George Michael went solo from Wham. Good for him, but in the long run, was it? Who gets laid at a rest stop?  Good luck bro. \n\nAkikos is Ray. He sources the fish, he does the R&D, and he pushes his boys to geek out on their craft. And boy what a craft. The rice cooker they use is some serious Kit Knight Rider stuff. The soy they glaze some of there fish with has been sonically emulsified to thicken and soften the flavor profile. Sous vide?  Check. Blast chiller?  Check. Boxes straight from japan to age there tuna?  WTF is that?  Aged tuna?  Damn straight. Check out the knives and chopsticks used by these guys. Oh my!\n\nThe rice is great. Individually distinct grains with just enough vinegar to hold your attention without making you stand up.  Toothsome and warmed above body temperature, it's how sushi rice should be.  \n\nI always do the omokase so I let the boys decide on what my mercury intake for the night will be. The fish is always good. Ray sources with an eye for unique and delicious product from Tskiji, local, and national waters. Only gripe is that I find them garnishing too many of there dishes with lemon. \n\nSake list is great. Have one of their little hotties choose for you. Pricey but again, special occasion. I can't read the the damn label so someone translate please. These guys always get me the right bottle cause they always talk to me bout what I like. They can communicate to me cause they all speak engrish. \n\nSee, that's what I love about Bay Area Japanese cuisine today. Communication. The chefs speak to you in English. The cult of the sushi nazis is dying out. From Ichi, to Ramen Shop, to Akikos, the next generation is speaking unbroken English and that's great. I can converse with the chef and it's no longer a mystery. It's just plain simple service. Without the R's and L's getting jacked up. \n\nThe call. Order as much Russian Uni you can get your hands on. Oh my beautiful little sea urchin. I prefer to call it ocean vagina. It's an acquired taste but damn I just wanna shove my face in it and come out looking like a glazed donut. Nuff said. Maybe TMI.", "author": "Chris K."}

I went there several months ago and it wasn't as good as it used to be but I chalked it up to an off day since every other time I'd been there over the last several years it'd been great. Then, a month or so ago I went there with a friend for lunch and they informed us that they had changed to being a  \"reservations only restaurant\". It was later in the day, around 1:30, and there were empty tables but even though the tables weren't reserved, they would not seat us because we did not have a reservation. \n\nI knew I was going to be in the city today and wanted to go there for lunch so I made a reservation. I went there with two friends and . . . wow wow wow - have they changed. They were AWFUL. I mean, amazingly bad. \n\nFirst of all, the menu was completely different from what was on their web-site. The web-site has their old menu which was fantastic but NOT what they're actually offering now. The old menu was focused mostly on sushi - some fresh and different combinations that were really great - with some traditional items like tempura and teriyaki. The new menu is a menu you would see on any average Japanese restaurant anywhere in the bay area. Tempura, teriyaki, some salads, some sushi, etc.  And the sushi options that remain on the menu are common sushi options you would find anywhere. Nothing interesting or innovative. \n\nNeedless to say, we were all very disappointed but decided to go ahead and eat there. Wow, such a mistake. The prices on the menu are the same pricey prices which they had when they had an innovative menu and great food but sadly, the food was awful. Honestly some of the worst Japanese food I've had.\n\nFriend #1 ordered a combination lunch of sashimi and tempura. The sashimi consisted of four different types of fish very thickly cut but was decent. He said he would give it a 7 out of 10 (which, to me, is scary for sashimi - since sashimi is raw fish, it should be a 10 out of 10 otherwise I'd be worried about the freshness). The tempura was horrible. Instead of the golden brown, crunchy and fluffy batter that tempura should have, the batter on these were a medium brown, hard as a rock, and greasy. Yuck.\n\nFriend #2 decided to order some sushi. She ordered the spicy tuna and rainbow roll. In the past, the rainbow roll had vibrantly colored (hence \"rainbow\" roll), juicy, fresh fish on top. What came out today was pale and looked stale - you couldn't tell the different types of fish apart and it definitely did not resemble a rainbow. The spicy tuna looked like something you'd grab from the Safeway deli. In fact, they both looked that way.  Her assessment was that she'd give them about a 4 or 5 on a 10 scale.\n\nNot seeing anything interesting on the menu, I thought I'd go with some Japanese standards so I went with a chicken teriyaki and tempura combo (yes, I know that JFC invented teriyaki as a way to sell soy sauce in America but my Japanese grandmother made great teriyaki and I love it, if it's good). The chicken consisted of 8 small slices of chicken that was grilled on one side - the non skin side - and not on the other so the skinless side had char marks and the skin side was flaccid and . . . can't even think of a word for it. A thin teriyaki sauce that was HEAVY with star anise or Chinese five spice flavoring (neither of which should be in teriyaki) was ladled over the chicken. The overpowering taste of the anise/five spice was really all you tasted so, not good. The tempura . . . well . . . see above. Yuck. \n\nWe were all very disappointed since we have been going there for years and had high expectations. So, when the waiter brought our check, I asked him what happened and his response was to say that they can't continue to serve the same menu for 18 years without changing and that they were trying to move away from heavy fried foods to lighter, fresher, healthier options. The problems with this answer are:  1) yes you can if people love it and are ordering it which - they were; and 2) but . . . the original menu was lighter and fresher and healthier and the new menu has more deep fried, heavy stuff on it.  \n\nI mentioned that the original menu was more innovative and fresher and better and that the new menu was more of a menu that you would see on any average Japanese restaurant and he said that they had great fish and they were trying to focus on that and do new and interesting things like fish soups and stuff - there were no fish soups on the menu and, frankly, his answer didn't make any sense. I kind of felt bad for him because I'm assuming that's what he's told to say but I really wanted to ask him, \"Do you believe anything you're saying?\" \n\nI heard that the son recently bought the restaurant from his parents and I'm guessing that's why the changes. So sad. Time to find a new sushi place. You've lost at least 10+ customers, just today (us + friends and family).", "author": "Patricia G."}

You should make a reservation; they aren't always able to accommodate walk-ins or have long wait times (over 1 hour). \n\nAkiko's is on SF Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants, so you know that this is some quality food. The menu looks like a standard Americanized Japanese restaurant (specialty rolls, nigiri, set dinners, etc), but the individual items tend to be more tapas-sized. \n\n- Negi Toro (MP, $15 that night): 5 pieces, with tuna belly/toro, scallion, pickled daikon, sesame. This is the best toro I've had; the fish is so tender and melts in your mouth. The additional flavors complement the fish without overpowering.\n\n- Negihama ($10): 5 pieces, with yellowtail, scallion, shiso, sesame. Yellow tail is my go-to sashimi option because it's hard to mess up an inherently high quality fish. Akiko's does no wrong with this roll.\n\n- Beef Nakimono ($13): We ordered the Hamachi Kama, but they had run out for the night (it was only 7PM!), so the waiter suggested we get the beef instead. The Niman Ranch beef is cooked medium and arranged in a tetris-fashion with Japanese pumpkin and carrots. I usually do not enjoy teriyaki-ed meat, but I was impressed by the beef quality. We ordered this after finishing our rolls and it took 20 minutes to come out, so order up front to avoid the wait.\n\nI shared these three dishes with my friend, and we both felt that it was a light dinner. We probably should have ordered 2 more dishes to eat our fill, so I would probably tip Akiko's to a $$$ restaurant, rather than $$.

Sushi is mediocre at best. I've had cheap sushi that was more satisfying than this. \n\nWe had 8pm reservations for two and had to wait a bit for the table to clear. No problem, we get it. We were very excited to eat here so we were cool with it.\n\nGot seated, knew what we wanted to order right away because we were waiting a while to get seated. Waited a very long time to get the waiter to even pay attention to us. Tried to flag him down  3 times and he finally came and took our order.\n\n- Half the items on the menu were not available. \n- Wanted ikura nigiri, was told that they were out of ikura which boggles my mind. It's quite standard. \n- We were later served agedashi tofu WITH IKURA (see photo). So he lied. \n- Waiter knocked over my chopsticks. As in one of them flew into the air and then both fell onto the ground. Waiter didn't even apologize or pretend to be sorry. \n- Agedashi tofu was lukewarm and soggy. Sushi was extremely petite and not good quality\n- Waiter forgot to put in an order for the roll we order.. Instead of apologizing or immediately offering to place the order he kept telling us we had no roll. We literally went back and forth 3+ times with him arguing that we didn't order the roll. I have no idea why we were even arguing. How hard is it to just place the order? We just wanted to eat. Waiter clearly does not have the word sorry in his vocabulary. Stone cold and unapologetic about everything. \n- He also forgot to put in an order of edamame for the table next to us. \n- Tried multiple times to flag waiter down to get the bill. My girl friend and I at one point were so bewildered by our awful experience (this place is rated really well) wondered if he had something against females and if he ignored/hated us because we weren't men. Everyone else seated around us were and he hustled to serve them. Yes, it was that bad. \n\nI don't believe for a second that this was a one-off. I think he just can't be bothered to act like a decent person and provide decent customer service. Manners and courtesy and the word \"sorry\" don't just completely disappear. Either you have it or you don't. \n\nI've talked to others and the sentiment is the same. Poor sushi, no passion, terrible service, know nothing about fish. All they care about is the money.

It was an experience and I can see why people completely rave about this place. Truly, a terrific, terrific meal.\n\nMy only (relatively big) con is for noobs like me who don't truly understand how omakase works. The menu said it would range $80-100 and I figured with the quality of fish we got, it would be a little higher than that. What I wasn't prepared for was the $500 bill we got at the end of the meal that was NOWHERE close to the $80-100 listed on the menu. Yes, NOW I know that the price is based on the fish but I really wish they had told me this beforehand so I wouldn't have gotten such sticker shock at the end. This is probably just me since I didn't know what to expect getting omakase but it kind of ruined the dinner for me. It's not great when you're half expecting a bill around $250-300 and then you get a bill that's actually $500.

My typical re.visits in the bay are ichi, sushi ran & sushi sams...I think of themmmm when my mouth craves for sushi... :) Akiko is just not in my thoughts.\n\nI do recommend this place though as I am confident they will not disappoint", "author": ".I I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-12-12", "description": "Let me preface by mentioning that I absolutely LOOOOVE sashimi and would go out of my way to get my fix.  Having heard good things about Akiko's, I was excited to come here for a friend's birthday.  However, good quality sashimi does not give you a free pass on customer service.  \n\nTHE STORY (skip to the bottom for review of the food)\nI went with a group of 4 around 2pm on a weekday.  Note: this time was already past the downtown lunch rush.  My party of 4 wanted to sit close to coworkers who were also a party of 4.   Akiko's told us that they do not seat groups.  Given the size of the restaurant and their tendency to be busy, we understood.  \n\nHowever when we looked inside the restaurant, we saw that they had two empty tables next to each other, both of which sat four.  \"Perfect, both our parties could take up those two tables!\"  Or so we thought.  When we asked the hostess if we could sit at those two tables, she told us that she would ask her manager.  We told her that we would not change the seating arrangement (out of respect for them), but would just like to sit closer to one another.  She asked her manager who told her no and that our parties would have to sit at separate tables.  \n\nLet's stop and think about this for a second.  Two separate parties, check.  Two open tables, check.  No problem, right?\n\nThe manager, a younger gentleman who stayed in the office, came out to speak with us.  He did not look happy.  When our group tried to explain that it was a coworkers birthday and that we would like to respectfully take the two, four person tables to enjoy lunch, he repeated that they did not seat groups.  We asked why this was not possible since we would not move the tables together.  He only looked annoyed and sarcastically said, \"Well, you guys will be talking to each other won't you?  I think that's called a group.\"  \n\nThis was shocking to us since we did not expect a manager to behave in this manner.  Not wanting to push the matter further, one party took a table of four closer to the door while the other party was seated on the other side of the room.  To add salt to the wound, the manager promptly seated the other open table with another party of four.  Even the hostess apologized multiple times for her manager's behavior.\n\nTHE FOOD\nI had the chef's special, seaweed salad, and the agedashi tofu.  I must say that the seaweed salad was a delightful little appetizer being fresh with just the right amount of crunch.  The agedashi tofu was soft and the sauce was light enough to add flavor but not overpowering.  The cuts of sashimi were a good size, soft and buttery - though a few were stringy.  Honestly, I have had better sashimi for the same price elsewhere.  I enjoyed the appetizers most, though.\n\nIn conclusion, the food was decent, but I expect better service.  Two stars.  We will not be coming back again.\n\nEDIT IN RESPONSE TO RAY'S COMMENT\nHi Ray,\n\nYour response to my review tells me a lot about how much you care about your customers.  (I guess I should have known from the way we were treated at your restaurant.)\n\nLet me explain to you, again, how I felt.\n\nAlthough it was frustrating that you do not seat groups (my party complied to your policy), it was your attitude that pushed me over the edge.  Was it really necessary to make such a snide comment to your guests? \n\nWe were polite.  We were respectful.  There was no reason for us to be treated the way we were no matter how good you think your restaurant is.  As the owner, you should have been the prime example of excellent customer service.  This, however, seems too much to ask.", "author": "Kristy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-07", "description": "Misguided, disorganized, expensive sushi here. They aim high the sushi chefs clearly know what they're doing (beautiful presentation, perfect rice, some nice fish) but it's as if somebody doesn't know how to run a restaurant or doesn't care or maybe they just got out of the wrong bed this morning. \n\nStaff came in a few minutes late and was hand carrying wine bottles in the front door past 5-6 parties that had come early to score a walk-in. They took a long while to seat us, then a while to order in the bright mid-afternoon summer haze. Our first appetizer, a delicious wakame (seaweed) salad arrived almost instantly but despite telling them we didn't have much time and their telling us they needed the table soon for a reservation, the other apps took a full 20 minutes at which time the waiter said that three of the 7-8 items we had ordered were out, basic stuff like agedashi tofu. Are they having management problems? Somebody had a car accident? Kitchen explosion?\n\nA few of the dishes were beautiful, ankimo was sublime. The kappa roll --\u00a0thin slice of cucumber in a skinny roll, a pure test of sushi hand skills --\u00a0was flawless. Other dishes were over-seasoned and swimming in a pool of cloying sauce. This is the kind of place that serves each sushi selection on its own expensive plate (they use Heath Ceramics here), and where the chef adds exactly as much wasabi and sauce as he thinks is proper -- which is way too much, as if he's anticipating American tastes --\u00a0so you don't have to. The exception was the humble kappa roll, for which they pre-poured a deep portion of homemade soy sauce into oversized bowls (which, manners-wise, is considered rude if you do it, the Japanese equivalent of pouring half a bottle of ketchup on your plate next to the fries). Nevermind, they were nice bowls, the soy sauce was delicious, and it was the best item of the night.\n\nA word about the bathroom. It looked just fine. But it has a door that nobody can figure out how to lock and a motion sensing faucet that is completely unintuitive to use, I think you have to pat it on top like it's a dog. To compensate there is a hand-written sign, in sloppy handwriting, taped to the bathroom backsplash wall where the mirror should be (there is no mirror) with colorful carpet tape of all things, with an unhelpful explanation that nobody understands. How long has this place been open? What are they thinking? If there's a problem with the bathroom, please fix it for goodness sake. At most restaurants at this price point you would expect stuff like this to be fixed on the first night before start of service.\n\nIf the service, and maintenance, and menu concept were as good as the chef skills and plating presentation, Akiko's could justify its 4 and 5-star Yelp reviews, and perhaps even its high price. As it is, they have to do better if they are going to last.\n\nAt least we didn't order too much. You know how sometimes after eating unfulfilling sushi you feel like going out for a hamburger? After we left Akiko's we felt like going out for sushi, which we did, at a much less expensive place that technically wasn't nearly at the same level of sushi skill, but was a lot more fun and enjoyable and satisfying.", "author": "Gil S."}

It was simply the best, creamiest albacore I have ever tasted and I've eaten sushi 1-3 times a week for 30 years. Sliced just right, it is worth every penny. Why? Because I am still fantasizing about it 5 weeks later.(I tried to go back last week but there wasn't a reservation until the following Tuesday :( Not even if I wanted to eat dinner at 5:30.\n \nWe let the chef choose and he didn't hold back! Everything was amazing and being surprised with what would come next was half the fun. Each serving an edible art show, we gasped \"wow\" as the chef handed it over the counter like Haute couture coming out the curtain and down the runway. Bill came to $300 for 2 of us including tip; for the quality, I think it was well Worth the price. Impressed by each selection - every dish made our eyes light up!  It all tasted even better than it looked.  I think that it is out of my budget to go there as often as I'd like, (three times a week) but then again, how often does a bill for 2 hit over $125 - $150 for something completely forgettable?

I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see a maki menu with nary a mention of mayo. Mayo on raw fish is a crime against nature. I almost danced a jig before side-eying the Philadelphia roll. Salmon and cream cheese has a time and place. Wrapped in seaweed is neither. Write it down! Ahem. The wine pours are generous. The service accommodating. You should expect these things from a very favorably reviewed SF sushi spot. If not, rethink the way you're living. So, since each and every review would/should speak in depth about the satisfying cuisine, I am going to spend a couple of paragraphs speaking on some other elements of Akiko's.\n\n1.) The name. This is completely personal to me but Akiko's is the name of one of my favorite dive karaoke bars in Louisville. Many night was spent there making bad decisions, singing terrible songs and openly mocking people who were extending earnest effort. So, points for making me smile, right off the bat;\n\n2.) Akiko's looks nothing like any other sushi spot I've been to before. The dark lighting, exposed brick and cool flooring brought to mind thoughts of a hidden bar in England rather than a maki miracle in SF. Cheers and props to whomever came up with the look. It's distinctive, appealing and memorable;\n\n3.) The bathroom. I got stuck in it. Much like I would imagine a bar that Jack the Ripper forgot, the bathroom has one of those slot-latch lock thingies (you can tell I am very tech-minded, can't you?). In any event, it's small, sorta broke-down looking (it's clean; it just goes with the distressed motif) and a little scary in the serial-killer-could-pick-you-off-here sort of way.\n\nThis might be the most useful review evAr.", "author": "Johnny T."}

Otherwise, their standard menu fare is not worth a special visit. If you don't like surprise bills, ask how much that day's omakase will cost. \n\n- Don't expect every single bite to be mind-blowing-- that's a pretty unreasonable expectation even for Michelin-starred restaurants. You're going to get a mix of decent everyday items with some imported/wild-caught items that change throughout the year based on availability. The opportunity to taste the latter is what you're really paying for when you do omakase here. \n\n- From the previous reviews, it sounds like they don't always provide the friendliest service, but they were plenty accommodating on our visit. Be polite and keep reminding yourself that you are not the Queen of England (unless you really are) and you'll likely be fine. \n\n- Not going to review their food because by the time you visit, you may be getting a slightly different menu.

Without question it's the best sushi rolls I've had in a couple years. This was my first visit to a Japanese restaurant where literally every roll satisfied me in some way. The Firecracker, VV, Volcano, and Dragon were especially phenom. Of the eight rolls we had, I think the Dynamite and Spider Roll were the least favorable. \n\nThe decor is also super cute: floral designs along with bamboo. Service was a bit slow in the beginning and I think they could've been a little more attentive when pouring beers, but overall I was highly satisfied with the experience. Even on weekdays - we went on a Wednesday - I recommend reservations. It's in a central area on Bush and Grant so there's popular street activity. Sitting up front, I saw a lot of people turned away because they were walk-ins. Also, sit in the back! The front tables got a little chilly (though I also take blame for being a bit underdressed based on SF August weather).\n\nI think based on the quantity of pieces in each roll, this place is also very reasonably priced: 8 rolls, an app, glass of wine, and prob 6 bottles of Sapporo for $155.

For those of you who don't know what Omakase stands for, it's not a fish or a Japanese dish, but rather a Japanese phrase that means \"It's up to you\" (from Japanese , entrust). If you're a true sushi/ nigiri/ sashimi fan then my suggestion... don't even open the menu and just tell your server \"OMAKASE!! \"  (Hint: it's not on the menu).  The chef will prepare a specialized tasting menu in a variety of courses.  Just let your server know when your table is full at any time.  \n\nMy friends & I have been coming to Akiko's for over a decade now.  We used to order the rolls and some of the cooked items as everyone else who have left reviews here on Yelp.  But you won't find too many who have ordered OMAKASE like we do. This is a great way to try their daily specials and seasonal favorites.  Ray takes great pride in flying fresh delicacies in from around the world such as from the internationally recognized Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan.

I was dining by myself as in SF for work/conference.  Got seated at the sushi bar.  Two other single guys on my left and three women together on my right.  I made reservations, but Tuesday at 8pm, probably didn't need to do so.  I'm presuming at other times this place can get jammed.  Both sushi chefs were very friendly and talkative.  I always like that.  Later the women left, and two more single guys on my right.  I guess that's par for Tuesday evening after 8pm downtown...\n\nGot a Japanese ale (name escapes me) ... very hoppy for an ale, but not bad.  I started off with sashimi 12-piece sampler...very good.  Very fresh.  Then got a spicy tuna roll and spider rolls...always my favorites, and their spicy tuna was very well done.  Highly recommended.  Spider rolls were only OK.\n\nAs I was still hungry (I'm still growing ... as they say.. sideways), ordered the salmon teriyaki ... came with 4 nigiri, miso soup, and rice.  The teriyaki was done perfectly ... nice and crispy, without too much sauce.  Perfect.  Bravo.  Miso soup was also very good.  I now felt too full .... I guess never a happy medium.  Anyway, I'd highly recommend this place.  Service was very attentive and excellent.\n\nI'll also address the amount of food for the cost that other posters noted ... I'd say that if cost/sushi is what you're looking for or volume of food, don't go here unless you're willing to spend a bit as the sashimi can get pricy (lots of offerings from Japanese waters)... go to Japantown or elsewhere.

I can't rate the food since we never got past the very impatient hostess. But the night was saved because we went to a different sushi restaurant that exceeded our expectations and made the night fantastic.", "author": "Karly B."}

I also couldn't live with myself if I didn't write down how great this place was for me. Automatically I knew it had to be good when I found out it was near Irish Bank and Claude Lane two of my favorite places in the city.  \n\nThe second we walked in all eyes on the staff greeted us with a hello or a nod.  Something I always look for when going to intimate places such as Akiko's.  We were warmly greeted by a member of their wait staff and taken to our table. The room is small, cozy, and stylish. \n\nOur servers were all very helpful and extremely friendly.  We had 3 people attending to us and they all took turns warming up to us. It didn't matter which one showed up they all took our questions as each of them had full knowledge of all the things the restaurant did and served.  It is really rare when that happens so when it does it's a real treat. \n\nAs far as the food it was a true sushi lovers dream.  They take great care in their fish and rice. The quality is some of the best around by far. We did like that even if you are into the more non traditional forms of sushi served at other restaurants they cater to those folks as well. We would imagine that those items from the looks of it at the other tables are just as good and as well prepared as the traditional items. They have a daily menu of what is fresh and the server was nice enough to share their delivery dates with us and even suggested that the day after delivery is usually the best as far as taste and flavor. We learned quite a bit about sushi that we hadn't known about and even got a lesson in nigori sake from the woman who brought us drinks. Needless to say this was one of the best sushi experiences I've had. \n\nAs we left each of the people who greeted us on the way in took the time to acknowledge us on the way out. Overall I love this place and look forward to returning very soon.", "author": "Joco F."}

I'm not quite convinced that I can give Akiko's a badge of sushi excellence.\n\nPositives\n* The Chef speaks Japanese, appears to care an have pride for his food.\n* Decor and vibe rocks - great place to spend time.\n* They carry Orion, a great beer from Okinawa.\n* Carry 3 kinds of Uni (Santa Barbara, Hokkaido, Russian Tokujiyo from Kaigara)\n* Cryogenically frozen Monkfish Liver (Ankimo) shaved on top of Uni!!\n\nNegatives\n* Bar unsuitable for sushi enthusiasts - it's thin and too short, hurts your arms to rest them on the edges of the counter.\n* Very pricey, every order of nigiri comes on a separate plate instead of being set on the same Geta (Samurai Shoe) like in traditional sushiya.\n* The fish underwhelming - not very fresh but not old either - for the price this was definitely expected. Just the look of the fish in the neta cases revealed this.\n* No real wasabi - instead just run of the mill horseradish with wasabi powder. Did have wasabi paste (which is better) but the waiter took my plate while I was eating it...\n* 2 Chefs was clearly not enough for how busy it is, counter sitters get neglected\n* no salmon roe (ikura), guessing no demand\n\nAll in all there was enough good things about Akiko's that I'll probably give them another chance, but considering Sanraku doesn't do any of the negatives listed above - I might have a hard time.", "author": "Grayson K."}

I was joking with my friend about asking people at other tables if I could take pictures of their food for instagram, because everything really looked that incredible.\n\nUnfortunately, our overall experience was a little less enjoyable. A friend and I went at lunch in the middle of the week, and were seated fairly quickly. Beautiful atmosphere (although they really crowd the tables in), and the sushi bar looked really impressive. \n\nOur waiter was a little slow about getting to our table, and when he was finally ready to take our order, I asked about why types of fish were included in the sashimi sampler that came with a dish I was considering ordering. His response was \"the typical ones.\" Maybe he didn't know the answer, but as someone who is a little picky when it comes to sashimi, I wasn't really satisfied with his response. I ended up ordering something else, and that was that. \n\nOur food ended up taking about 30 minutes to arrive, which for a rice dish and udon seemed like a really long wait. My friend's udon was brought the to table a few minutes before my meal, which I always find to be a little irksome.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-25", "description": "What makes my experience so disappointing is that Akiko's had everything it took to become my favorite sushi restaurant in SF, but just failed miserably.\n\nNow, I will definitely give credit where credit's due: Akiko's has some of the freshest, unique, and delicious fish that I've tried in SF. The Ankimo (monkfish liver) here was amazing, the Russian Uni was the best uni I've ever had, and Hamachi nigiri was perfect. The ambiance of the place was incredible -- the brick wall blended with pipes and stucco felt like I was in some cool underground bar, but the lighting and atmosphere felt like I was in a tranquil spa in Kyoto. \n\nWhere it goes miserably wrong, though, is with the service. Aside from the extremely slow service (it took about 15 mins for them to even acknowledge us at our table), our server Ray was a nice guy (I'll give him that) but it really felt like he was pushing orders on us way too aggressively. We felt like we were being upsold by a Comcast representative and it just wasn't pleasant. It was like he was only trying to get us to order only the most expensive sushi, rather than actually helping us with choosing items that we'd actually enjoy. After we put in our order, our drinks were forgotten and we had to ask a busboy twice to get us the beers that we ordered. They didn't arrive until our third dish had already come out. \n\nBut honestly, even that's excusable.\n\nWhat really pissed us off was that we ordered the Kuro Maguro (Chu Toro), since all of us really go to sushi restaurants for toro (everything else is a nice plus). First off, they ran out of every kind of toro, except for the Chu Toro, so we ordered that. Another server (not Ray) brings us our \"Chu Toro\" that obviously did not look like belly, so we asked him what it was. The server said it was the Chu Toro and we said \"Are you sure? That doesn't look like Chu Toro.\" He says: \"That's the shoulder cut, you ordered it\" and walks away. It wasn't until after the dinner that our server (Ray) comes and says: \"Oh by the way, we ran out of Chu Toro so we substituted it for the bluefin tuna shoulder cut.\" \n\nThe whole exchange was just extremely shady. If you run out of toro, then you come tell us that you ran out of toro and ask if we'd like to order something else instead. You don't sneakily throw something in there that we didn't order and try to trick us into thinking it's what we ordered. That whole experience really left a bad taste in our mouths.\n\nAnd by the way, what sushi restaurant runs out of 3 different types of toro on Friday night at 8pm?? I can't trust any sushi restaurant that can't get their inventory straight, especially for toro.\n\n---------------------------------\nFOOD:\n\nEXCELLENT: Ankimo, Russian Uni, Hamachi\nVERY GOOD: Hamachi Kama, Santa Barbara Uni, California Maki\nGOOD: Aka Mutsu, Kamasu, A5 Wagyu w/ Truffle, Shiro Maguro, Sesame Ice Cream\nMEH: Amaebi (Blue raw shrimp), Unagi, Ikura\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAkiko's definitely has great sushi (when it's even available), so I'll give it the 3 stars that it deserves for the food. The experience that we had, however, can't push it any higher than that.", "author": "Roy C."}

We went for it. \n\nNow Akiko's also has Blue Fin Tuna on the menu and before you get up in arms about it, they are the first to tell you it's sustainably farmed Blue Fin Tuna and our server went through great lengths to answer all our questions and quell our concerns, well done.\n\nThe food came fast and furious and it was excellent. The rolls were large  and packed to the rim with fish & veggies and I am extremely happy to report that the SPICY TUNA ROLLS had a nice heat to them, they truly lived up to their name.

There wasn't a visible sign outside, so that may be a little confusing, but it's the corner spot just outside the alleyway. Pretty cozy and small in there, the hostess will actually tuck you in if you're sitting against the wall (amusing and kinda of a strange aspect of what otherwise feels like a more upscale dining place). Service is very good, polite and attentive. Small, more traditional menu for sushi (hooray!) with more of a focus on fresh fish and \"gourmet styled basic\" rolls (your Sake roll will have more than just salmon and avocado) - which by the way, was delicious. They use brown rice, and the seaweed was a little moist/soft so it made it a tad chewy, but the pieces were all bite sized so it wasn't a problem. \nTried the barracuda nigiri (fresh catch that day) and the white tuna toro - both were delicious, fresh - no fishiness, the toro was buttery of course, and the barracuda was great - had the texture more on a steak side of the fish (like swordfish) rather then the buttery thick slab of salmon. \nEasily could overspend here, so maybe save it for a special occasion, and definitely make reservations!", "author": "Adrienne L."}

Took us about 20 mins to find the restaurant because there were no sign on the front, just the street number which made it nearly impossible to find if you're not from the area. When we finally found it, the hostess was rude and pretentious. She told us that it was full and there were no more reservations available that night. Although we could be on a waitlist that was not a \"guarantee\" and would take an hour and a half to be notified. I put myself in the waiting list and asked how many people were ahead of me and she told me there were four. We took a stroll in downtown and the hostess from Akiko's called back under TEN MINUTES and told us there were seats available. Unbelievable. She could of simply told us \"yes or no\" there is a wait time...instead of leaving us discombobulated about the waitlist and no guaranteed seating.

The walls have been repainted, the menus are stylish, the music has a trendier feel, and the place is more crowded for dinner.  BUT (and this is the most important thing) the food is just as delicious as it always has been.  Might even be better.  I originally started coming here because my dad lived just down the street, but even though he moved away a long time ago, I still try to make it across down as often as possible to get what I consider to be the best sushi in SF.\n\nI always sit at the sushi bar, and love talking to the chef (usually Joe, but there is another guy there too - sadly, I did not catch his name) about what is fresh and how to best eat it.  Apparently not everything should get dunked in wasabi/soy - stupid American!  I love that they only order small quantities of each fish, and never freeze anything.  Yes, that means they might occasionally be out of something, but there is always a delicious alternative.  \n\nOn a recent visit, we had their last order of Kindai, a sustainable blue fin tuna from Japan.  We also tried the Copper River Salmon from Alaska...this was amazing!  Like no salmon I've ever tried before, it melted away in my mouth and was such a vibrant color it looked like candy (see the pic I posted of it).  The star of the meal, at least for me, was our final dish - the Uni Nigiri Das.  This was smoked uni, with salmon roe and quail egg yolk on top of rice, wrapped in nori.  Popped the whole thing in my mouth, and the flavors just exploded!  I didn't want to eat or drink anything else for a few minutes after, so I could continue to savor the delicious-ness.  Seriously amazing!\n\nCan't wait to come back!!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

I don't like fusion sushi or fish that is way dressed in something that ruins the taste of pure fish. Sushi-snob I know. \n\nBut this place is great - the specials proved to be fantastic. We ordered the omakase and even though I hate Saba Mackerel, the horse mackerel was pretty good. I love the tekka poke tuna dish they give you - huge chunks in a good marinade. The red snapper, ebi, and halibut were also among my favorites there. We tried extra things like tempura (not that great) and the scallop was just alright. I'd stick to the special fishes for the day! Plus, make sure you make a reservation b/c I saw so many get turned away thinking walk-ins were welcome. Also, don't confuse this place with Akiko's Sushi Bar in Chinatown. The story is the sushi bar used to be where they were but they moved and sushi bar kept the name.

The best way to describe this place..... A modern day rendition of the classic sushi restaurants such as Ino in San Francisco and Yume in Alameda.  They have taken classic Japaneses sushi and created their own twist.  However, they were still able to keep it simple and let the fish shine.  I have been to other Japanese establishments that have twisted it so much that the integrity of the fish is lost in translation.  For me, putting all of that sirachi and mayo sauce, it just kills the fish.\n\nThey receive most if not all of their sushi from Japan.  The explanation on where the fish came from and how it was prepared gave me a better appreciation, respect, and understanding.  It's all in the details and it shows when it is presented.  If you are confused on what to get?  Get Omakase, Chef's choice.\n\nThings that you have to get here\n\nA5 wagyu sushi, amazing how they nitro oxy the fat and sprinkled it on top\nRussian Uni, the creamiest uni I have ever tasted\nToro, very fresh\nsous vide diced ankimo,  sous vide ankimo?!?  YES\nWalu\nTuna Belly\nArctic char\nBlack prawns from Japan........I wasn't a fan of this but my friends loved it\nScallop\nWild King Salmon\nKanpachi........not a fan of this fish\n\nWe didn't order any of the udon, tempura, bento box combo.  I just went with what they do best, their fish.  It was amazing.\n\n\nAnd I shit you not..............there's one dish that you have to get here.  It's the California roll.  Yes..........I know.  They ground fresh toasted sesame seed and layer it on top of the California roll that just made this come together.  Just get it.\n\nThis place is a bit pricey but based on how the fish was imported, it is expected.  So bookmark this place, it's definitely a must try.", "author": "jason g."}

Also the staff were really nice and they told me that the sushi is usually less than 3 days old when served. Along with the staff being very kind it also had speedy service, but when coming to your table they gave a five-star presentation to serve the hot sake. The exterior of the building isn't something to be proud of though, it's boring and doesn't have any sign at all. This has caused me to walk pass it a couple of times thinking it was part of another restaurant. When I figured out that it was in fact its own restaurant inside it had a very interesting atmosphere that I half liked; half was modern and the other was the original wall. The first time going there I was seated in the half of the room with the original wall which would have been cool if they put something over it to make it look less like an abandon castle.

Then after the birth of our son, it just seemed harder to go to places that are more intimate like most sushi places.\n\nSO for my birthday, she surprised me with dinner at Akiko's!\n\nWe decided to go with the omakase.  I told her that places in Japan generally don't let you chose omakase when not at the bar, but in this case it worked to our advantage.\n\nOmakase (December 2014)\n-Agedashi Tofu: This was super subtle but super good.  Whatever he put in the ponzu was amazing.  There were subtle hints of spiciness on top of the flavor which was very pleasant!\n-Salad: I thought this was only so-so, but my wife loved it.  There was a green there that had a very fresh-herb taste but also had a slight bitter aftertaste.\n-Hotate: The scallop wasn't super fresh.  This is normally one of my wife's favorites but she didn't enjoy it either. It had the sweet initial taste of a quality hotate but the after taste was a bit fishy I'm afraid.\n-Shiroebi: Kind of the same problem as the Hotate.  The initial flavor of the shrimp was sweet and the texture was there, but it had a fishy after taste.\n-Kuromauguro (toro) Probably one of the worst toro I've had.  The fish was a pale pink.  The texture was sandy/grainy and the pieces we had, had that hard/stringy peice that I hate with sushi.\n\nAt this point, my wife  was pretty upset.  Out rare night out and we didn't like anything except the tofu so far???\n\nThen the turning point was 1/2 way through the service.  The server (who seemed like either a head server/host/part owner).  Whoever he was he started talking to us and letting us know about the fish coming out.  instead of just the name.  this was when the freshness of the fish jumped up a few notches.\n\nKinki:amazing.  Great flavor.  Sweet and rich.  Amazing texture.\nKenpachi: Was good.  Par for the course.  Good flavor and fresh.\nUmimasu: The trout had a great texture and was also fresh!\nKamasu:Barracuda-I've only had it two other times.  Once in San Diego and the other in Austin TX.  This one was up there with the both of them.  Such a good flavor!  \nShiromaguro: Again, par for the course.  I love white tuna and this was fine.\nKinmedai: Okay, now were talking!  This was incredible!!!!  The reddish skin seemed to be slightly seared because it had a different texture.  And the smokey flavors!  The oils.  The texture.  The after taste!  I was in sushi heaven!\nSawara: I've always been a fan of the mackerel.  It's just hard to prepare well when it has so many bones and the texture isn't the best, but this Spanish Mackerel was OFF THE HOOK!\nMadai: This snapper was also filled with natural oils and an amazing smokey flavor.  Such an amazing taste!  The final trio plate is the only reason why I would say Akiko is one of the top sushi joints in the City!\n\nThe night started off really shaky.  The place is super stuffy and maybe I'm spoiled but during omakase, I'm use to getting some 411 dropped on me, not just the names of the fish.  Ray (I think was his name) was awesome.  He gave us attention, he dropped knowledge.  Was super friendly.  And the last 5 on the list above were AMAZING!  Totally made up for the horrendous first half of the meal service.\n\nMy advice: Don't order the omakase and order off the special/seasonal menu.  Don't go for the normal nigiri you see everywhere else.  If you go this route, this will be an amazing night out.  Will go back again!!\n\n2.5stars for the omakase and stuffy atmosphere.  4.5stars for the special nigiri and Ray (I hope that's his name. Dude was awesome).  Avg=3.5stars", "author": "Anthony L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-19", "description": "Akiko is the name of one of the sushi chefs, the little female one behind the sushi bar. Hayashi Shiyo-san is the man behind the sushi bar, who speaks Kansai or Osaka Ben (dialect). Together they have owned this restaurant for 13 years, and they anchor down all the sushi orders at this nice little gem downtown, which seats 49 total, with 8 at the sushi bar. If you want to go here and you don't pay attention walking by it, you'll miss it, as the signage is not ostentatious at all. \n\nMy colleague and I came in on a Wednesday night, and it was pretty much full. However the Sushi bar had seats, and so we sat where I always prefer to sit, at the sushi bar, to see the craft and converse with the sushi maker.\n\nOnce I knew he and Akiko were actually Japanese and not Korean, Chinese or something else, I felt comfortable ordering sushi Omakase style (Chef, I leave it to you) for $50 per person. I also asked for a preference to Nigiri (\"Nigiri de').\n\nChef Hayashi made a range of Nigiri creations that were understated, but had nice little accents to them. Many of the servings had a double order plate of 4 pieces, so that my friend and I could each get a couple to enjoy. Below is what we had, with the order size (1=2 pieces, 2=4pieces)\n\nHamachi (1)  $5.50\nHIrame (2) $11\nShiromaguro (2) $10\nKing Salmon (2) $14\nKodai (2) $12\nWalu (2) $11\nSuzuki (2) $12\nMadai (2) $12\nUni (1) $8\nAji (1) $7\n\nAs you can see, the sushi is very reasonable, especially for downtown San Francisco. Hayashi-san added little touches, like a dab of green chili sauce, or finely diced negi (green onions), chopped ginger or a little brush of sweet honey syrup to add complexity to the nigiri flavors, without overpowering the fish. \n\nGranted, the sushi were smaller than regular sushi you would find in Osaka, Japan, where Hayashi-san is from, but many Japanese sushi-ya in Los Angeles and San Francisco have gone to the smaller piece to provide more variety and keep the cost reasonable. The smaller rice balls fill you up less, too. \n\nWe had 2 large Kirin beers ($7/ea) and a small Hakushika Sake (cold, $15), so with the $29 in booze, Hayashi-san served us Omakase for almost exactly $50 each, as requested, because the bill was $131 before tax. \n\nUmai-shi, Yasui-shi, Subarashii-shi!", "author": "Wanugee N."}

Ok, let's pause on that.  I've had monk fish liver once before, many many years ago and I do recall it tasted like a can of cat food.  Not that I've had cat food before, but what I would imagine cat food would taste like based purely on the smell.  Let me just say their monk fish liver was DELICIOUS and rich just like our beloved foie gras.  I just wish they served it with some kind of bread.  Popping the piece into my mouth was like popping a good size piece of foie into my mouth.  \n\nSo, why 3 stars?

We made reservations about three weeks earlier but still could not get a table until 8:30 pm. We were several minutes late because we walked past the restaurant twice without noticing it - there is no sign! Once we realized where we were, we found a very small and intimate restaurant with an exceedingly friendly and accommodating staff. We opted for the omakase dinner and relied on the chef's recommendations. Not one of our courses disappointed. We had an excellent bottle of wine to accompany our food, which was recommended by our server. For the last course, our server asked if we would be interested in the Wagyu beef. Coming from beef country, we were not really looking for beef but agreed to give it a try. That was the best piece of beef I have ever eaten. The service at this tiny restaurant was spectacular. If you are in the area and want some excellent sushi and Japanese fare, you cannot go wrong with Akiko's!", "author": "Brian F."}

Although my friend has only been to Akiko once awhile ago, the sushi chef and one of the waiters immediately recognized him and shook his hands. This shows that Akiko not only cares about the food, but also the people. This is prominent in particular when the sushi table was full even around 11 p.m. when my friend and I left the restaurant. \n\nAccording to my friend and his other friends, the sashimi at Akiko is extremely fresh and the sushi is well executed. Similar to the sushi chef at Jiro's Dream of Sushi (an award-winning documentary about a Japanese sushi chef), the sushi chef at Akiko thinly brushes a thin layer of soy sauce on the sashimi and a thin layer of wasabi on the rice in order to bring out the original flavors of food. If the food at Akiko is not so fresh, the sushi chef would not have been to do this. \n\nThe only reason that I gave Akiko three stars rather than four stars is that it lacks vegetarian options. I could barely order anything there. Thus, unless you can eat or love eating deep sea fish, you are better off going to a different Japanese restaurant. Nonetheless, the tamago sashimi was hand-made and well-executed. I would not mind coming back to Akiko just for the tamago. However, I think the chef put way too much scallions in the miso soup that covers the original flavor of it. \n\nOverall, LG and I had a great experience there, and I would recommend you going to Akiko.\n\nFood: 4\nService: 5\nDecor: 3", "author": "May Y."}

As I was approaching it, I realized I've been here before, many, many years ago, when the place was still quite rustic.  How it has transformed into a very modern, stylish place today!!! \n\nAs others have mentioned, the staff are very friendly and attentive (maybe even too much if you're looking for some intimate chat).  We asked for, and got some excellent recommendations, with the Russian uni at the top of the heap.  It is more briny but also sweeter than the standard uni and is just more intensely flavored.  I enjoyed the head of the blue shrimp better than it's body.  The head has so much meat on it and was fried perfectly.  The body, on the other hand, is rather chewy with not so much flavor to sufficiently reward you for all your troubles.  We also enjoyed the wagyu nigiri with shaved white truffles on top.  The light sear truly enhanced the flavor of the meat.  However, at $30 for 2 pieces, I'll probably pass next time.  \n\nThis is probably going to be the place for us to go back to the next time we look for more unusual sushi options.", "author": "Yvette F."}

We had a reservation for 3 people for 8 PM. We arrived on time and noticed there were a lot of people waiting and that one couple was already very upset.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of waiting & a lot of tables being seated I realized we were going to waiting a long time for a table because all their tables are two seaters so for there to be a big enough table to fit 3 two table would have to leave. Finally the hostess offered us a free beer for our wait which was a nice start to the long wait. \n\nWell at 8:50 or so the 9:00 reservations start to arrive and be seated. At that point a spot opened at the sushi bar that would fit 3. We inquired about it and were told that they were working on getting us a table and proceeded to seat two gentlemen at the sushi bar spot, note they had walked in like 5-10 minutes before we mentioned that spot. Well at this point of an hour of waiting we were all hungry and pretty frustrated. I inquired why we were not seated at the spot at the sushi bar and were informed that the two patrons were VIPs and the manager told the hostess she had to seat them there because it was the best seat in the house. I then asked to speak with a manager because that is just bullshit after waiting an hour! Well the manager would not come over and by then another spot at the bar had opened up, so basically the manager avoided us.\n\nWe sat down and were served a free app pretty quickly and choose our sushi as quickly as possible. The sushi came and was AMAZING! The manager kept coming to visit and gave us a free sushi roll, hot sake, and dessert which was a nice touch after waiting an hour when we had a reservation. However, if the food had not been so awesome I would never consider going back again. RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE LARGER THAN A PARTY OF 2!", "author": "Pam J."}

The sushi was very good, and the atmosphere was fun. It was a nice spot for a cozy date night with the hubby and even here we were attempting to make it more of a cheap weeknight date than a splurge. We felt this was clear from what we ordered, and let me make it clear that we always tip well when we are cheap because we don't want to punish the waiters. \n\nWhen ordering we asked our nice waiter for a recommendation on the nigiri. He responded with a special tuna that was on the menu that night. It was listed as 'market pricing' but considering nothing else was that outrageous we decided to go with his recommendation. He came back a few minutes after taking our order to say that the chef recommended the other cut of the tuna we had ordered so we went with it. Never once did he mention anything about the price. \n\nWhen the bill came it was $25 for the order of tuna nigiri, almost doubling the bill. I understand that it is priced where it should be, but a little warning that it was so much more expensive would have been the courteous thing to do. No good waiter points out only the most expensive item when asked for recommendations without also giving more reasonable options. To be honest it ruined the whole dinner for us.

Went for my birthday with my mother and had a great time. This one star review is regarding the new hostess with bleached light blue-ish hair. I went with a friend for lunch and was told there would be a wait (I totally understand, they are very popular and therefore very busy). She said there would be a table in half an hour so we went walking around. Came back after 25 minutes and when we approached her, the same hostess just stared at us with a look that implied \"why are you bothering me?\" I thought it was obvious that we came back to check on the status of any available tables, but since she just stared at us and didn't say anything, I felt the need to explain myself. I said, \"oh... we're just here because you asked us to come back in 30 minutes\" She kept staring and eventually said \"I still don't have a table for you.\" So then I asked, \"will it be more than fifteen minutes?\" and she said yes firmly. I'm not sure if she understands the role of a hostess (I've worked every role in the FOH of many restaurants, so there's no excuse that I don't know what I'm talking about) but part of her job is to make guests feel comfortable, not like they're bothering you with their presence. Please don't take for granted that I would like to spend my money at your place... for that reason, I would like to be treated with some courtesy. I would like to apologize in advance because I know it's unfair to let this one experience with a rude (and obviously inexperienced) hostess define my feelings towards Akiko's, and to assure the business that this is not the case.

First ones seated! They mentioned that their kitchen was closed and were only serving sushi. That kinda gave me mixed feelings at first but didn't bother us too much since we were there for the sushi.\n\nWhen I came back from using the bathroom, the restaurant was packed! Mostly everyone in there had reservations. Once it got packed, they started turning people away! We were shocked and asked them why they do that . There explanation was \"so we could focus our time on the customers here and not have to feel rushed.\" also they make EVERYTHING fresh so they take their time with their food. I was impressed. \n\nSo overall, the service was great! I love it when servers really converse with you. The food was THE BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD!!! You must try the Volcano roll that everyone yelps about as well as the Forty Niner roll! Oh, and make sure you make reservations! We lucked out by being the first ones there! The prices were a little pricey for sushi but you're paying for great quality AND quantity. Each of our rolls came with about 10 pieces.", "author": "Alyssa T."}

Ever.\n\nSeriously, you won't find a better traditional sushi meal outside of LA and Tokyo - every experience I've had here has been genuinely superb. First off, you'll want to make reservations.

Once you're in, if space allows sit at the sushi bar ask chef \"Joe\" to simply make you what's good (omakase nigiri) and he will BLOW YOUR MIND. I've had so many different varieties of fish that I never even knew existed, and experienced flavors I had no idea could come from fresh fist. He even convinced my wife to like Uni, which is something that even The French Laundry failed to do!\n\nI'm not sure what their rolls are like but, in my humble opinion, you'd be underutilizing your time, dollars and some awesome fish if you order rolls here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-08-23", "description": "I had pretty high hopes for this place.This was one of the few that I still had on my list of sushi restaurants to try in the city along with Kiss. After eating at probably 30-40 different sushi restaurants around the city, I think I have a pretty decent list of dining experiences to give a meaningful review and not either blast it at 1 star or say it was the greatest sushi ever at 5 stars. I'll break it down into these areas\n\nService - Surprisingly slow. Given the size of the restaurant and the atmosphere, I anticipated a more attentive dining staff. Maybe I should have eaten at the sushi bar? We ordered sake and that took maybe 15 minutes before we received it. The actual first course took maybe another 10 minutes after that. If it wasn't for the fact I was enjoying the company I was with, it would have been a painfully long dinner. \n\nThe Food - is it good quality? Yes. Is the fish interesting?  Yes. But is it so different and so tasty that it justifies 12/15 for Nigiri? Not at all. A lot of this fish I have tried before at other restaurants but I think Akiko's does a better job of presenting it to you on their menu as specials where other places may just have it on a white board and you have to ask. It's the same fish though. They just try to make it sound classier because they name the region of Japan it came from vs. just saying - Japan, or Australia, or California. In addition, they focus a lot on presentation, but that only goes so far at these price points. \n\nSashimi/Sushi Roll Comparison - I prefer sashimi but I do appreciate a good roll. We tried two rolls, one with unagi, one with salmon. They were both very good, but we noticed they put so little actual fish in the roll and try to mask it with avocado and fancy sauces. Pretty disappointing. The sashimi is very fresh, no question. But they also cut very thin slices and still give you the standard 3 pieces in a sashimi sampler of 4 different fish. \n\nIn short - good spot if you have some money to blow and its a first date and you want to make a good initial impression. Can't go wrong. For a true sushi lover, you may walk out a little disappointed. You will need to drop an easy $80-$100 per person before alcohol to try a wide selection of the fish and may leave hungry.\n\nSee my other recommendations for other sushi places if you want to know what is good and why I like it.", "author": "Adam W."}

I really love this small restaurant. Like so many places I eat out at in the city it feels really cozy with nice lighting and exposed brick walls. There isn't a ton of seating so if you have a big group you'll probably want to make reservations, but I've never had trouble getting a table for two during the weekdays just by walking in.\n\nThe beer and wine selection is so small there isn't a menu you just say you'd like red or white wine and your server can tell you your two choices. However, the service is really on top of things and that's quite nice.\n\nWe usually end up ordering mostly sushi rolls and a couple pieces of fish and everything is always really fresh. I like that there is some creativity in certain rolls and I'd say my favorite roll that I've had so far is the dragon roll because it has a fairly spicy sauce that comes with it.

The sushi were stacked in four rows of two and looked like a volcano. The salmon skin, green onions, and spicy sauce were splattered on top of the sushi and around the bowl, like lava. The best part of that dish, was the salmon skin, which was crisp and not too oily. The sauce had a hint of spice with it, but also some sweetness to it as well. The roll itself just reminded me of any other spicy fish roll with avocado.\n\nI really really really liked their gyozas though! Instead of the normal pork gyoza, it had shrimp and scallions in it! The shrimp was sweet and you can definitely tell it was fresh upon each bite. I liked how the skin of the gyoza wasn't crazy deep fried, and was thin enough to not overshadow the yummy goodness inside.\n\nAlso got the chicken teriyaki with tempura. Tempura had too much batter and tasted like the outside of an onion ring. Chicken teriyaki was nothing special as well. Didn't think it was worth $18 for 8 pieces of tempura (2 shrimp, 5 veggies) and a slab of chicken teriyaki.\n\nFUNNIEST THING THOUGH: was celebrating my friend's birthday, and for her birthday dessert, they put one of those trick candles that won't blow out unless you dose it with water!

I will definitely be having it again.  The fish was so delicate and tender.  \n\nService:\n\nThe service was friendly, professional, and polite.  We were seated quickly.

The food came out in an orderly fashion with dishes being removed promptly along the way.\n\nAmbiance:\n\nIt is a nice room.  It is cozy and comfortable.  One negative note, if you are offered to sit at one of the twos along the interior wall of the back room, you might want to pass and wait for another table.  They appeared to be very cramped.  Plus, there is only one restroom and there can be a small line that forms bordering these tables.\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed the dining experience at Akiko's.

And then we had to wait awhile before the waiter came and took away our plates and then a few more minutes for our rainbow roll. Gobbled that up right away - and then again, we had to wait for our dishes to be cleared, and then it took forever for our volcano roll to come. \n\nIn terms of the quality of the food: the sushi was fine; the fish is fresh.

The night didn't start well, as I had an 8 PM reservation, which the server had given away because they only hold tables 15 minutes after the reserved time. My friend and I were at the restaurant by 8:10 PM by my watch, and my watch is always 1-2 minutes faster. Luckily a party at the sushi bar was just finishing up so we didn't wait too long for seats at the sushi bar. \n\nI knew this place would be pricey given its location, but seriously, the portions here are tiny! Slices of sashimi and nigiri were super thin and I couldn't help but thinking why they were being so stingy. I mean, I wouldn't mind if pieces are small, but super fresh, but I was incredibly underwhelmed by the quality of fish here. \n\nI ordered the chirashi ($17) and there were some pretty stringy fish in the mix I got that I really had to tear through. I do think he gave me more pieces than normal though, because this portion was relatively reasonable compared to everything else we ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered the sashimi and saba dinner combo ($21), which came with miso soup and rice. Wow I tried some of the saba, and it was definitely either overcooked or an old piece of saba. Dry and completely unmemorable. Also super tiny - portions were about palm size. \n\nAnkimo ($8) is served nigiri style, and wrapped in seaweed. This was actuall pretty good, but tiny portions.\n\nOshitashi ($3) good, but standard.\n\nWe were still hungry so decided to order an order of the hamachi belly ($8 for 2 pieces of nigiiri), thinking maybe individual orders of nigiri might be better. Wow, what a mistake! Another underwhelming dish. There was absolutely no wow factor, nothing spectacular, tasted squishy....I was utterly disappointed.\n\nI wanted to like this place, I really did.

Some items on the menu are a little pricey, but others are more reasonable, so be sure to \"shop\" through the entire menu before making your choice. I have consistently experienced very good service here, and the ambiance is quite nice for a sushi lunch spot.  I would even go here for dinner, although I am a much more frequent \"luncher\" here.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit on the small and snug side, with limited seating, and has been completely filled at the lunch hour each of the several times I have come in for a sushi lunch.  I would recommend booking a reservation on Yelp using the OpenTable system, even for lunch.  You may luck out if you're early, but if you come in after 12 noon you may be turned away, which has happened to me once.  I now always get a booking through Yelp.  Of course, the fact that they are busy is also a really positive indicator of how well-liked they are as well.\n\nThere are 2 dining rooms -- I would recommend the back room as it is a little more private, with some cool high red brick walls.  The room is a bit narrow and it can be a little loud as the sound bounces back at you off the brick walls, but it's still better than the front room.  In the front, there are a couple of tables tucked in near the front windows, but the other tables tend to get a lot of foot traffic passing by going to the sushi bar (which is also in the front room) as well as folks passing through to the back room.\n\nAkiko's 8 piece Nigiri is $24.  The 6 piece Sashimi is more reasonable, but it wasn't really enough quantity to make a meal if you're on the hungry side.  I have enjoyed the Dragon Roll, and the Volcano Roll looks great.

Very good place for a quick meal and if you have time, make sure to ask about what special items they are currently offering.

I was really looking forward to eating there after hearing such great things about the place.  First when we were seated at the bar, I notice a very foul smell.  As I looked around I notice the trash can was placed right in front of the door as cars driving by the smell blew into the restaurant.   I ask politely to have the door closed...they looked at me as if I was bring a picky patron.   But they finally did....but from there I had already lost my appetite.  The smell had linger into the restaurant.\n\nMy husband went on ordering.  We ask about the specials...they rudely said we don't have any everything is in the menu.  Then as we proceed to order our meal we order some nigiri and sashimi it was decent, but I have had better and nothing extraordinary where you can't get from any decent sushi bar.  When we order the negitoro maki, we notice it was a package of frozen tuna mashed that cost $3 at the store, that they charged $18.  (If you know what I'm talking about it's not even fresh tuna nor is it toro quality...if you read the package it's frozen tuna with grape seed oil to give it that oiliness of what they called toro). When we received our order that took long because they were trying to throw it out the whole time by stalling was still frozen.  We also had order some items from the kitchen but only got one of the item...even that item was not what I order.  By then I just wanted to leave.  I don't mind spending money for good quality food.  \n\nOverall experience chefs we're not friendly and inexperience, food quality was ok as long as you're ordering straight from the case....but I've had better.

We ordered the spider roll too, which wasn't too special, so my big recommendation is to go with the market menu so you're guaranteed amazing fish (although this would put your price way above the $$ rating to the $$$$).  I don't think the other rolls on the menu do this place justice (and the complicated rolls do not really count to me as sushi, i think) - you really have to appreciate the place for the purity of taste in its fresh sashimi/sushi, the main stars of the show.  Plus, they make their own soy sauce (true sign of the real deal!).\n\nWe also ordered some other dishes, including the hirimasa head/neck, vegetable tempura, and the nabeyaki udon.  All great.\n\nGood sake selection, lychee sorbet from Japan.  MM-MMM!\n\nRay, the owner, was also our server and was very attentive to our table.

It looks like the seafood udon was good, however I opted for the nigiri sampler. I found the shari (rice bottom) to be really inadequate but the fish was fresh. For me, sushi is an \"experience\", so even though fresh fish is often hard to get, it's a real buzzkill when the rice does not work with it.

You can't just walk into any sushi joint and be satisfied (though in Japan you can go ANYWHERE and the sushi is on point), if only it were that simple and easy. Cue Akiko's.\n\nI came here on NYE and had their prix fixe menu and in that menu contained a nine piece omakase. Nine pieces of nigiri heaven, YUM. While everything on the menu sounded amazing, the omakase is what I was most excited for. It was definitely super satisfying, but what really hit it out of the park were the add-ons we got. I couldn't help it. If I wasn't planning on returning to this place for a long while, I wanted to make my trip worth it. We added on the uni, both the Hokkaido and Russian. The Hokkaido was creamy and light, not like any uni I've tasted (I usually eat Santa Barbara)... no other words to describe it other than \"fresh\". Not fresh as in it was flown in overnight to preserve it's freshness (which it likely was), but fresh as in the freshness of eating an ice cold watermelon on a hot summer day. Maybe refreshing is a better word for it? If uni could be refreshing, the Hokkaido uni is just that. The Russian uni on the other hand... it's rich, creamy, and full in flavor. So, so good... best uni I've ever consumed, I totally wanted more.\n\nOne of the other add-ons was.. can you guess? Yep, otoro. Of course, it was melt in your mouth delicious. Without a doubt everything you'd expect from a good piece of otoro.\n\nIf you're looking for good omakase I highly recommend Akikos.", "author": "Kimberly F."}

What's up with that, San Francisco?  I love you so much, but you keep disappointing me!  \n\nAdd this to the list of okay but not-spectacular food.  Another 3.5-er.  \n\nLet's break it down now.\n\nMy friend and I got four rolls: the forty-niner (your basic shrimp tempura roll), philadelphia, volcano (spicy salmon and the works), and the sake (a regular salmon roll).  Everything tasted fine.  Nothing tasted omg-amazing.  The forty-niner was my favorite; I liked the crispiness of the shrimp a lot, and they do it right.  The volcano seemed to have an explosion of deep-fried batter decorating the plate of sushi stacked like a volcano.  I like batter too, but not THAT much.  And this was truly batter explosion.\n\nDinner was $41 before tip, so I guess it's averagely-priced for four sushi rolls.  The portions were also decent.  We left feeling pretty content with the amount of food we had just consumed, which was nice because I normally leave sushi places feeling like I haven't been adequately fed. But this time, it was that feeling of: \"Well, I COULD get an order of delicious, deep-fried and perfectly hot onion rings from Burger King next to Sephora on Powell Street and enjoy sitting there munching on the grease explosion in front of me, but I don't HAVE to.\"  You know? \n\nAnother note: this place is kind of hard to find.  Because it's right under a sign that says \"Irish Bank.\"  Not sure why they haven't changed the sign yet!  Confuse! Do not like! \n\nI guess if you just want some standard sushi, this'll do for your sushi craving.  But warning: there's nothing particularly exciting.  And would I come back?  Probably not.  There's far too many sushi joints in San Francisco, and this one is like all the other ones.  Plus, they're slow.  We were the first ones in the restaurant for dinner, and it still took them a long while to take our orders and get us our food.\n\nSo, overall, if you're in the area, REALLY have a craving for sushi, this is fine for you and decently affordable.

Portion was slightly on the smaller side considering the price was $19. Sushi quality was decent, but didn't blow my mind. It's kind of in the limbo between cheap low quality sushi and expensive high quality sushi, which isn't something I usually go for.", "author": "Sherry L."}

Watch out!\n\n---\n\nSuper classy sushi place. But it's not, like, IN YOUR FACE classy, which I appreciated. Low-key classy. It won't get all up in your business.\n\n**TRIVIA FACT**\nI think you need to get reservations here but I don't actually know because I didn't get them for my group.\n***\n\nThings are kind of pricey, especially if you stick to the sashimi or nigiri. I guess that's how it is at most sushi places---but since this is a more upscale joint, you can drop, like, 25 bucks on what basically amounts to two small slices of fish.\n\n\n***TRIVIA FACT***\nThe bathroom door is kind of confusing. You'll... you'll see what I mean?\n***\n\nService was glacially slow. We were famished, and waiting for sushi, and really really wanted to eat sushi, and waited a little bit more for sushi, and then the sushi came. It's something you'll just have to deal with. Highlights at our table were the salmon nigiri and the volcano rolls.\n\n***TRIVIA FACT***\nMy recollection of the price is a bit biased in the expensive direction because we were paying for the dinner of one of our friends who was going away, and because I have no ability to account for cognitive biases.\n***\n\nThe rolls are actually a pretty good bang for your buck. If I come back, I'll definitely be getting more of those.\n\n***TRIVIA FACT***\nThat's all! I'm done now.\n***", "author": "Greg P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-07-26", "description": "Having been to Akikos on a few other occasions, I was stoked when my wife surprised me with a Saturday dinner there to celebrate our anniversary. But this visit turned out to be our last, because it was one of the worst restaurant experiences ever.\n\nIt all began when we inquired about a 12-piece Sashimi tasting. Not a fan of Mackerel, I politely asked if it could be left off the selection. The waiter abruptly replied \"No\" as it was the chef's decision. Ok, fine. I get it. But what ensued the rest of night was outright ridiculous. While trying to decide on our meal, which couldn't include Toro, Black Cod or Wagyu because they were out despite appearing on the menu, we finally made our wine selection. They were out of our first choice of course, a $42 bottle of German Riesling. So we settled for a $46 bottle of 2012 Hugel Riesling. The waiter showed up with a 2013 bottle instead, and we again settled. But the wine was rank, and we sent it back. The waiter proceeded to lecture us on the taste of Riesling wine, of which we have had plenty.  We decided to just drink beer instead... a standard Sapporo. \n\nWhen it came time to order, our selection off the standard menu included Ikura and Seared Salmon Belly, both of which were unavailable all night also.  At this point we were pretty pissed. How can you be out of so much and charge the same prices for inferior products on a Saturday night in San Francisco?! We placed our order, and I got up to ask for the manager to discuss the poor service. But apparently Akikos was out of managers as well, so I ended up speaking to the expeditor. He offered his apologies, said he would pass on the word and offered us Sake on the house. I kindly declined, but he later appeared with a Nori cracker topped with Spicy Tuna, and said drinks were on the house for the evening.  A step in the right direction, right? WRONG.\n\nNot wanting to abuse the gesture, we inquired about the three other Japanese beers, one costing $9 and the other two, $13. But guess what? Out of the latter as well! So we sipped on our $9 bottle from Okinawa.\n\nAfter overhearing the waiter tell the table next to us that they had Yellowtail (not on the menu), we ordered a few additional Nigiri, which were quite tasty, but nothing out of this world. With our glasses still full, the waiter removed our plates, but rather than asking if we wanted any dessert, he disappeared and quickly returned with the check. This was the last straw. We hate, I mean HATE, being brought the check without having asked for it. Even more so when there are plenty of empty tables available for sitting people. We finished our beer, paid and left no tip whatsoever, and headed out the door for our last ever visit to Akikos.  A terrible experience for a place that has only gone downhill since our first visit. Check out their website. Their drinks menu doesn't work and their blog hasn't been updated since 2012. Pretty lame for a place that charges what it does. Sayonara, Akikos!", "author": "Matt G."}

Realized when I changed the reservation I actually moved it to the following evening accidentally (I'll blame jet lag). But the waiter/host found us a table and sat us right away. Made a potentially disastrous mistake absolutely fine.\n\nFood was spectacular. I'm from Buffalo, NY, I have some sushi places back home I adore, but this has totally recalibrated my scale for rating sushi restaurants. I knew the seafood would be fresher, but I wasn't prepared for how good this was going to be. I honestly don't know if I'll ever enjoy sushi the same way again.\n\nStarted with gyoza, wife had chicken teriyaki and some unagi nigiri. I had a spicy tuna roll and their 49er roll. The spicy tuna was legitimately hot with super fresh tuna inside. The 49er roll had a bunch of stuff in it including really crunchy shrimp tempura and was topped with a sliver of paper lemon peel. That lemon peel just made the roll pop and made my eyes bug out of my head when I ate the first piece. Wife was worried something was wrong by my reaction. When she tried a piece she understood. Wow.\n\nAlso, their wasabi had more kick than any I've ever had.  \n\nWas worried about slow service based on other reviews, but it was very speedy.

The 49'er roll, Rock 'n' Roll, and fried spicy tuna roll were all delicious.  One lunch buddy had the oyako-don and seemed to enjoy it immensely.  I had the nabeyaki udon which was good (especially the perfectly cooked soft-boiled egg), but not as interesting as other versions I've had elsewhere (i.e., there were pieces of white fish, but no mushrooms, shrimp tempura, or fishcake).

This is a great place to eat sashimi because the quality is very high and very tasty!\n\nWe had a reservation for three for 6:30 on a Thursday, and it was already full.  \n\nLive Scallop - I was put off by this because, silly me, I thought you eat it while it's moving.  It just means that it was shipped live to them, so it was very fresh, and so very delicious! My friend mentioned that they should not have sliced it so thin, and I agree since I like that pillow-y texture of scallops.  But still it was very good.\n\nSake Sashimi - Delicious!\n\nHamachi Sashimi - Delicious!\n\nUni - Pretty good.\n\nMonkfish Liver - My friend loves this but I'd never heard of it before.  I love trying new things though. Reminded me of uni but more creamy,  maybe it will grow on me.\n\nSake Avocado - Loved this roll!\n\nDynamite Roll  and Firecracker- Roll - one had scallops and was good, one had eel which I thought was sweet and did not like.\n\nSpider Roll - good\n\nGrilled Mackerel - I'm not into this is all I can say.  It had a lot of fish oils which I'm sure are really good for you.\n\n\nWe ordered the hot sake and I like that it comes sitting in hot water so that it keeps warm.  The bottle is too small though. Every person needs one bottle for themselves, yet I believe it was for a pretty penny.  Service is very friendly, but it does take a while to get your food and orders, so I wish that the sake size would compensate for that :P  All in all, a very enjoyable dinner.", "author": "Erica D."}

Anyway they share the same name and perhaps original owners but this is a more upmarket experience. The other place -although also 5 stars (see my review) - had excellent food with some incredible dishes (hamachi belly); this place -- where a reservation is required--is like the posher big brother. Here every single piece of sushi and sashimi I tried was mindblowing with the piece de resistance being the Kobe wagyu beef nigiri (at 25$ for one piece) as well as the various types of toro (bluefin tuna) sashimi and nigiri. I also tried the sashimi tasting menu. Never had such fresh sushi. The drinks menu was also very extensive and some of the sake was also outstanding. Service was also very good and the chefs were friendly and brilliant, explaining each dish in detail. Obviously you pay more in a place like this but, with a 20% tip, my bill came to just north of 150$ but I had the very best sushi of my life. Definitely go there on a special occassion or to treat yourself or if you are looking for a great place for a romantic dinner date which serves astonishingly good sushi.", "author": "Asif J Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-05", "description": "Akiko has fresh fish. This is evident, in pictures taken by other Yelpers, and in the food itself once you visit. \n\nBut there are reasons I will not visit again: \n\n1) We placed 5 orders of nigiri and out of the 5, our waiter had to inform us later that they had ran out of 3. Our dinner reservation was at 5:30! If you run out of fish basically before dinner time, I have only 1 question: WHY?!?! The strange part is that our order wasn't specialty seafood, which I would understand if the restaurant had only limited amount--all we wanted was sea urchin, yellow tail belly, and toro. So... WHY?\n\n2) too hipster. pretentious as hell. I like real food. Grub food. Street food. Mom and Pop food. Sushi and sashimi CAN be such food. Just because it's Japanese and has an upper scale feel due to the price doesn't mean it can't be mainstream in a way that diners can enjoy, eat large portions of, accompanied by hearty alcohol, and have a merry ol time. One such place is Sushi Sam in SM (except it's usually packed). \nAt Akiko, all I saw were white couples whispering, one in dreadlocks, one or two hip Asian folks in Warby Parker glasses and straight bangs... ALL whispering. Ordering California rolls, \"seaweed salad\", Spider roll AT MOST (but you are really kind of pushing it), 6 pieces of salmon sashimi (too dangerous and exciting!) and alas... MOCHI ICE CREAM IN EXOTIC FLAVORS: sesame- what!? lychee- OMG. and green tea- PHEW~ \"safest Oriental flavor\" I can't. Seriously. This is just too SF for me. I am a lame duck suburban kinda girl and witnessing all of this in one night is too much. \n\n3) the wait. As part of the SF hipster sushi experience, we first waited 20 minutes for our first order (fried tofu) while the couple who came in and ordered after us got theirs, then 15 minutes for 2 pieces of nigiri, another 20 minutes for the other 6 pieces, and another 10-15 minutes for a small roll. WHY?!?!  It was 5:30pm and half of the restaurant was empty. I watched as a waitress kept replacing and rearranging the 2 pieces of ginger on a plate waiting to be served. I have no idea WHY, but she just kept rearranging them, literally for 5 minutes, maybe wanting it to look \"perfect\". I was dumbfounded. Details and presentation are important naturally, but this is not the type of arts and craft experience I want to be part of. \n\nBy the end, I just kind of lost my patience. Even though my partner and I weren't full, I didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait for 2 more pieces of sushi. Did they drive all the way to the Bay to fish? Maybe that's why the food was so fresh, regardless, I didn't want to spend time in there anymore.", "author": "Salamander L."}

The volcano roll is only during lunch hours to reserve appropriately\n3. Don't bring a cheap ass not down to pay more for fine sushi dining\n\nI was pretty disappointed when I was told that delicious volcano roll everyone keeps talking about is only during lunch hours when I came here for dinner.  Either I got to excited and missed that little information or no one bothered to mention it!!  lolol oh well! It's an easy to get to place from downtown and I'd definitely come back.  The fish is fresh and they have special kinds that they don't serve at most Japanese restaurants.  I came here with a terrible i-don't-even-want-to-consider-a-date and I won't go into detail but seriously -- if you're cheap and you're not down for some fine dining, don't bother.  The menu isn't super expensive but it's not cheap either.  IDK maybe I just never mind paying more for sashimi that melts in your mouth.

I wasn't feeling particularly good about things. The guys working there (all I saw working there were guys which was a bit odd to me in a restaurant like this) seemed a bit overwhelmed/disorganized considering how small the place is. The earbuds they wear to communicate didn't seem to be helping - perhaps that's the problem, they can't get anything accomplished with each other in their ears.\n\nAnyway, things turned around after that. The food was excellent. Rivaled my favorite sushi place in Seattle. From then on everything was delicious and came to the table in a timely fashion. The anal-retentive positioning of things on the table and attention to presentation was commendable, but perhaps part of the reason they seem to have issues with quick service.\n\nOverall, excellent food and a nice little restaurant despite the bumpy beginning.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-18", "description": "I went to Akiko's with the full expectation that it was to be a 'hipster'  sushi spot as noted by other reviewers here.\n\nI was impressed by Akiko's freshness of food and, in all honestly, I felt the work here left a greater impression on me than that of Morimoto's in Napa.\n\nI haven't explored a wide variety sushi places - but Akiko left me with a positive impression of what sushi can be.\n\nMy only requests are that the dishes could have explained with more detail (as was done with the couple next to me) and the menu could use a bit of reorganizing. I'd like a bit more written explanation as to what I was ordering so I didn't have to ask your server every new sushi eater question in the book (e.g. differences between Sake types, etc.). But, that being said, every waiter took their time in helping me make a decision.\n\nI ate 1. A white tuna Sashimi. Solid and tasty enough on its own. 2. Tako nigiri (ocotpus with rice) - much less 'chewey' than other octopus I've ordered. The only pieces I added soy sauce to - but still greater. 3. Hibachi belly Tuna - super rich and tasty. A much 'buttery-er' version of the White Tuna I had previously. 4. The Waygu truffle nigiri.\n\nI was left in shock and awe after the truffle+waygu combination... I'm not sure if there's anything much more indulgent in the world. As the chef said - it's one of their 'show stoppers'. If anything at all - come here for this. I was still in awe nearly 20 minutes after I had finished the meal because the Waygu truffle was truly that good. An 'umami' explosion of meat and truffle.... It was everything I wanted it to be and more...\n\nI will come back to Akiko's. I want to leave my choices more up to the chef next time and explore more of what quality sushi is. \n\nEven though some people can perceive Akiko's as a 'hipster' spot - it remains dedicated to providing fresh sushi and excellent service. There are a lot of things here I don't think you would find on a typically sushi spot menu and I appreciated the effort that was put into every piece of sushi I ate.", "author": "Kyle M."}

The sushi is very fresh and well-prepared, and the tonkatsu chicken was cooked to perfection. Even their regular sake is the best I've tried in a long time. However, I agree with previous reviewers in that Akiko's service is slow, hence the one-star deduction. It took 15-20 minutes for our food to be served at lunch time on a Monday. Kind of ridiculous.

Be sure to make a reservation before you go; I don't think they allow walk-ins.  I came a little earlier to bring a surprise cake for my girlfriend and they were kind enough to store it in the back for later.\n\nWe came in and were promptly seated.  The ambiance is pretty nice; it's kind dark, with little candles lining the wall.  Atmosphere isn't too loud, which we likes.\n\nFor our meal, we ordered:\n-1 4-piece Nigiri with Udon\n-1 4-piece Sashimi with Beef Teriyaki\n-1 Kani-age (soft shell crab)\n-1 Rock n' Roll\n\nThe sashimi/nigiri is oh-my-god fresh.  I used to not really tell/care since it's all food to me but wow... after coming here, there really is a huge difference.  There might be better, but I ain't paying for that.  This place is good enough.  Fish is nice and lean and just melts in your mouth in such a yummy yummy way.  Love love love it.  Girlfriend even thought it was good enough to finish ALL of hers :)  She normally eats just the salmon, and passes the rest to me but she liked 'em this time.\n\nThe udon is kinda standard, but it was huuuuuuge.  Pretty darn good, seeing as it wasn't super salty.  My beef teriyaki was nice too.  Came with a little bowl of rice, but it was filling enough.  The Rock n' Roll was pretty good too!  Girlfriend looooooves unagi so this was a perfect fit.  Nice big pieces of unagi, and the sushi pieces themselves were really big.  The Kani-age was alright; I think it could use a little more flavor, but I don't order this dish enough to compare and see if it's good or bad.\n\nWhen we finished the meal, the guy came out with the cake, and my girlfriend was suuuuprised :)  They didn't even need me to signal or anything.  Super awesome peeps.  It was a $2 cake fee, but who cares.  They did it perfectly and I couldn't ask for more.\n\nThis place is super duper yummy, super duper awesome, and super duper wonderful.

However, a friend who seems to always have insider knowledge said good things about this place. I wondered, because I had heard that it was run by people from Taiwan. It has been my own experience that non-Japanese Asians have different tastes than someone like me, who was weaned on my grandmother's Japanese cooking. But it is always good to keep an open mind (open palate?). This place did not disappoint. First off, it is tough to find. There doesn't appear to be a sign out in front, but I spotted it by the diners near the front windows eating tasty looking Japanese food! The interiors are lovely, decorated more in a 1930s Shanghai style with a modern twist, than traditional Japanese. The food was delicious! The fish was first rate quality, but more importantly, the sashimi was prepared properly (ie, cut properly to maximize flavor and texture--yes, there is an art and technique to this. It isn't just about getting out a ginzu knife and slicing away any which way). My friends wanted the hamachi kama, which was delicious and perfectly broiled. The meat was not at all dry. Nice sake selection. Sushi was perfect, although I would prefer to just eat sashimi (raw fish only, without sushi rice) at a place like this! Service was prompt, efficient and courteous, even on what may have been a typical packed lunch crowd. However, I would skip the agedashi tofu. Nothing special, and they served it in tiny squares with more of a katsu coating (bread crumbs) than batter. Still tasty and perfectly season sauce, though. We also ordered mixed greens, which I had hoped would be oshitashi (parboiled leafy greens, pressed and served with a soy sauce based dressing) but was instead a basic mixed greens salad (also tasty, but nothing special).  The only disappointment was that the staff did not seem to know how to pronounce menu items correctly--or did they intentionally mispronounce items so that the mostly non-Japanese customers would understand?", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

Where can you find $20 omakase?? \n\nJoe-san made us a yamaimo (Japanese mountain yam) appetizer dressed with yuzu vinegar on a bed of mixed greens. So very refreshing! Then our sushi was served.. With every sushi, he does something different to it. Some he adds some ponzu, some he'd sear, he also has a sweet soy he puts on that is absolutely delicious! Of course, the ones whom should be left alone, he does not mess with! \n\nHe's so careful and detailed with the sushi.. it's truly an art! Everything he did was to enhance the flavor of the fish, and to bring out the perfect balance. Every bite was a little piece of heaven in my mouth! (drools as i type away.. )\n\nWe also tried to volcano roll that was highly recommended by fellow yelpers. It was indeed very delish! It reminds me of orange chicken in a good way. I love how they make unique rolls, but also make the perfect traditional nigiri sushi. \n\nAlso, Joe-san was so generous and made us several special dishes to go with my sake! He made a special shrimp ceviche dish that was to die for!! It's mixed with avocado and dressed in sesame oil and some other Asian seasoning.. you eat it with some fried wonton chips.. OHHH my it's soo good! n he made us a grilled yellowtail belly that melts in your mouth.. \n\nI made a promise to myself that from now on, every time I visit San Francisco I will dine at Akiko. They're my new found family in North Cal.. \n\nOH! and gotta mention, price is VERY reasonable.. please go and let Joe-san take you on an exciting party in your tummy!!! :)", "author": "Ann C."}

The sushi was extremely fresh, buttery and flavorful. For my entree, I ordered the chirashi sushi. The sashimi was really good but it was one of the more disappointing chirashis that I have had; only about 6 pieces of sashimi, a bit of wakame salad and a sprinking of tobiko over sushi rice. \n\nMy dinner companions all ordered udon and were very satisifed with their dishes. \n\nThis restaurant has daily sashimi and sushi specials, some flown in from the famed Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan.

We got water immediately and after we got a pot of hot tea, waiters came and helped us refill our cups. We didn't order a lot of plates overall, only 3 rolls. We got the Spider, Rainbow and VV and they were all noms. Props to the sushi chef b/c he rolled them tight, none of the pieces fell apart for any of us. The fish on the rainbow was super fresh too. The plates were also presentable and the prices were not too bad considering the location and atmosphere. The sushi rolls averaged $10 per roll. I have to say I left hungry since the three of us shared three rolls. I think if you want to have a decent meal, expect to pay around $30 per person after tip and tax.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation because it seems like everyone else had one. The restaurant isn't very big, a front section with tables for twos and fours, and a back section with more tables. I definitely want to come back here to try the sashimi.

It's the most unique roll ever, whenever I go to other places and order a volcano roll, it's nothing like Akiko's.  Akiko's is way better!  It's topped with crispy tempura bits and has a yummy spicy sauce.  I can eat a whole roll by myself but that would leave no room for my udon.

We got standard rolls like the rainbow roll and rock n' roll but those in itself tasted really good - fresh and the flavors were just right. We also got white tuna and wow, it melted in my mouth... so freaking good. Their restaurant-brewed soy sauce was perfect for dipping - the right amount of flavor and not too salty. I definitely recommend their special sashimi - we got 3 different types - not exactly sure of the names but they were all imported straight from Japan. Very unique and very fresh. We also got a hamachi head and the fish was cooked perfectly, and it was served with a light ponzu sauce for perfection. The service was also impeccable.

I had came to this acceptance because I've never given a recommendation to any, which prevented lazy me from trying out any myself. \n\nI was craving sushi, so I decided to rely on Yelp to steer me in the right direction. This was the winning pick, as it was close enough to me and had sufficient reviews. \n\nWe did not have reservations, but when we arrived around 6:45pm it was pretty empty. The decor very modern and had a hint of fancy dancy-ness, but when I scanned the prices on the menu I thought it was reasonable. I would say it's a nice place for a date. \n\nMy bf and I shared the Spider roll, Firecracker roll, and a Chicken Katsu Donburi. The Spider roll was good; I like the use of soy paper in lieu of nori and the softshell crab was crispy. The Firecracker was spicy! but additively so; It was flash fried so there was a thin crunchy crust and the flavors worked well. I can't handle spicy, but still managed to eat almost half of the order. The Chicken Katsu was on the pricier side, but the chicken was moist. It was good, but not worth $11 (unless they provided another piece of chicken, THEN it'd be a good order). \n\nOverall this place gives me hope that there is indeed some good sushi restaurants around the city.

Let's be clear: this is some of the finest if not the finest sushi I have ever had. That includes Tokyo and Kyoto cities too.\n\nI, too, passed right by the restaurant. The storefront is understated and easy to miss. I walked in and the other reviews are correct: the place is small! Loud too, mostly due to the hard walls and ceiling. The place was totally full although there was one 2-seat table open. Curiously, they said I had to wait and then 10 minutes later they put me at that open table!\n\nHappy to get seated after a long day of flying, I opened the cold sake menu and was delighted by the choices. A minor complaint: the menu font was small and printed in grey and with the low light level, I had to use the candle lamp on the table to read with my old eyes. Prices for the sake were a little steep but there were a number of reasonably priced sakes of good quality. \n\nService was a bit frenetic and slow but eventually they came by my table, tucked into the front corner, and took my order. The hostess didn't write it down and it my order was a bit extensive and I figured she would forget something and she did. I had ordered one of the rolls but let me tell you, I am glad they forgot it because the choices of fish were so varied, it left me more room to try them!\n\nShrimp tempura appetizer was typical. Good and delicious but not a standout. Then the hamachi sashimi came out and it was superb and I marveled at the subtle flavor and buttery texture. The temperature was perfect. If this is what the rest of my meal would be, I was in for a treat.\n\nUni, unagi, shiro maguro...a mature yellowtail I have never had before...it was all exceedingly fresh, perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. This is why I was happy they forgot the roll...although they looked delicious, I wanted to try some of the other fish on the menu. One of the servers, Joseph, came by and asked how the food was and needless to say, I expounded on the subject. Turns out the sushi chef, a mature and jolly-faced fellow, has been a sushi chef since age 13. That man makes this restaurant; His knowledge and selection of only the finest quality fish results in a dining experience that is unmatched. \n\nJoseph went on to recommend some ocean farmed fatty tuna (toro) and it was superb. Turns out the chef is very concerned about tuna sustainability and buys direct from one of the farmers in Japan. \n\nI cannot see any reason this place deserves less than 4 stars. If you give it less, you simply don't know sushi or are responding to the size or ambiance of the restaurant. I wish the sushi bar was bigger so I could have sat in front of the chef and just had him toss whatever he thought I would like my way! \n\nAfter another sake, it was time to go and I went to the bar to give my compliments to the chef. The bill was moderate ($100), but for the quality a bargain in my experience. I have had $150 bills (for one person) in New York and Tokyo and although those places were good, they are measurably  below the quality of Akiko's.\n\n I am still searching my past experiences to see if any can compare to Akiko and I cannot come up with any that is better. I look forward to my next trip to SFO so I can again partake of this chef's art.", "author": "Jorge d."}

While we were on the outside, the world was fast-paced, cars drove recklessly, people darted between the raindrops and anxiety pulsed through the veins of commerce.\n\nOnce inside, the breathing slowed.  The warm faces full of concentration turned towards us and brushed the weight of the world off our shoulders.  The lights were dim, the space was well utilized and we were seated.  Above the doorway, the steel i-beams of FiDi created an archway.  In an bit of ingenuity, someone had painted it red to resemble the wooden doorways that dot the Asian landscape of history.  Clever.  Creative.  Working with what is there.  Tim Gunn would be proud.\n\nI ordered chirashi for the first time.  And uni.  And agedashi tofu.  Val got the a.j., edamame, and a miso soup.  I recognize now that I got so much food.  Way too much food.  Because my chirashi came with soup too.  \n\nAgedashi tofu was not the best.  The broth/sauce was a bit dark.  Too much like soy sauce.  The soy sauce was not proper soy sauce either.  Darker, like chinese soy sauce.  Edamame was regular.  Neither good nor bad.  \n\nUni was fantastic.  After a brief hesitation, I crammed it in my mouth and smeared it all over my tongue.  Sorry.  I tried to think of something lyrical to say, but it was all savage instinct.  \n\nChirashi was good.  A bit expensive.  I paid $30 for my portion.  It was a lot of food.  And I was well fed.  Good food is satisfying.  This means I won't be satisfied for a while unless I make it myself.", "author": "Christina C."}

We arrived at 7PM and the place was relatively empty.  \n\nI started the night off by ordering a glass of the tenth degree sake.  Unfortunately, they were out of it, and I was forced to settle on a lesser one.  No big deal.  Upon arrival of our drinks, we then ordered the following:\n\n1)  Kindai (sustainable blue fin tuna).  They were out of it.\n\n2)    Kanpachi (Japanese Amber Jack).  They were out of it, so the server recommended another option.  I believe it was the Arctic Char.  The server then comes back saying that she \"hates to do this to us but, they were out of that as well.\"  On the 3rd attempt, she finally brings out what I believe was sea trout.  It looked very similar to salmon, but evidently, the fish had not been completely thawed out, as I tasted crunchy ice crystals as I had my first bite.    \n\n3)  Hamachi Kama (Grilled Yellowtail collar).  They were out of it so we ended up ordering the saba shio-yaki (grilled norwegian mackerel).  Quite tasty, the fish was tender and cooked well.  The daikon, wasabi and lemon added a nice combination of flavors.\n\n4)  Smoked uni with salmon roe and quail egg.  The uni was extremely fresh as evidenced by the little dimples, and the smoked flavor along with the texture of the roe and the quail egg made this the most enjoyable dish for me.  \n\n5)  Hon Hamachi sushi (baby yellowtail).  Highly recommended.  Great texture and flavor.\n\n6)  Firecracker Roll.  Quite tasty with a good amount of heat.   A little heavy for my taste, but I would order it again.\n\n7)  Forty-Niner Roll with shrimp tempura, avocado, lemon paper, salmon, and magaso.  Really awesome roll.  \n\nI would rate the food a 4 despite the one sashimi dish we received that was not completely thawed.  What I don't understand is how you can possibly run out of so many items on the menu, especially when you have a menu that is printed on a daily basis.  At some point the server needs to be held responsible for knowing what is out, and mention it to the guest before they order.  The servers themselves were very nice, but extremely slow.  It took us over 2 hours for us to finish our meal.  In addition we waited about 30 minutes between our last course and the one before it.  I'm not sure I would go back again.  Most of the food was exceptional, but I'm not sure I would be willing to sit through a long drawn out dinner.", "author": "David D."}

Splurged even though we weren't on an expense account that night. Had the Omakase and was quoted between $110-120/person.\n\nFood: 4 stars - some exceptional fish flown in from varous parts of the world. 1/2 the sushi was really great and special. However, the other 1/2 was solid and I liked it, but they were some of the imported fish so the prices for the okay ones were like $20-25+ for 2 pieces. A few of the basic pieces like salmon was really good. We also got a young hamachi cheek (kama) and although tasty barely had meat.\n\nService: 5 stars - great service all around. Friendly, engaging service. \n\nQuality to Pricing (Value): 3 stars - part of the issue I had was some parts of the omakase fish was only okay and not worth the price. The bill came out to $300 for 2 and we only had a few bottles of beer and no expensive sake either. I have been to some of the best sushi/Japanese restaurants around some major cities and I really felt this was overpriced by 50%. Akiko's caters to those with an expense account.\n\nI will come back, but just not order the Omakase anymore. Too many of the Yelp reviews recommended the Omakase. Go for it if you are on expense account, and investment banker, venture capitalist or just sold your tech company.

I was especially impressed with their saba (well cured), along with their ikura (one of the few places that marinades their roe). You can usually tell how much pride and effort a japanese restaurant takes from their saba, tamago, and ikura (all time consuming preparations). One thing about their sake maki was their method of curing the salmon. Salmon's one of my favorite fishes, but I'm not particularly fond of using Kombu for the marinade, it makes it taste almost like smoked salmon (dislike, unless it's on a bagel). \n\nAll in all, I'm glad I found this place because I can only take so much Tokyo Express.

It's always been very busy when I've been in, so lunch takes a little longer than other places.\n\nThis is the best sushi restaurant I've found in this part of the city and I've been working in the Financial District area for 5 years.\n\nThis place doesn't get 5 stars because it is pricey, crowded and a little bit of a hassle.

But they started turning customers AWAY at 8:30PM.  But the weirdest of all, was that they RAN OUT of TEA!!!!  Wow.\n\nOn to the food.  The food here is good, but not spectacular.  We got a couple of rolls and we finished it off with fried octopus.  We also got the agadashi tofu, but that tofu was drowned in a big bowl of the broth.

Shiro toro pleasantly surprised me with its buttery goodness.  Wasabi seems authentic and less pasty than some other places I've tried.  Green tea is tasty and included in the meal for free.  You just have to ask for it.  While sitting at the bar, I saw the chef making a roll with four different colors of masago.  How fun!  My friend enjoyed his seafood salad and commented that his spicy tuna roll was actually spicy and very tasty.\n\nNigiri sushi was about $5-7 per pair and while I didn't eat anything else, other items (such as udon) were reasonably priced for under $10.  Some combination meals were on the menu - 5 pieces of nigiri or sashimi and a choice item including udon and dontaksu - for $17-18.\n\nI visited for a weekday lunch (walking distance from work) and really enjoyed my experience here.

The 1st thing that stood out was the music they played at this restaurant. I have a keen ear for music and they were playing chillout-type of music here. The 1st track I recognize was a Bonobo track and the 2nd one was by Ulrich Schnauss. 2nd thing I noticed was the service. The waiter was friendly and kept our glasses full of water, but the service was very slow. A warning sign should've been when the waiter asked if we were in a hurry to go anywhere afterwards. The positive to the slow service was that everything was at least freshly made and tasted good. I absolutely love Unagi so I got the Unagi Donburi along with the VV and Volcano roll.

Unbelievable; guess Panda hasn't been hitting the gym.\n\nService was pretty good, ambience was typical for a pretty nice sushi place. Got a sashimi duo, which was a couple pieces of salmon, tuna, and if I recall some sort of white fish, along with chicken teriyaki, miso soup and rice. The chicken teriyaki was pretty bad; a few small pieces of overcooked white meat drizzled with some teriyaki sauce. Definitely two star chicken.

Though, the tables were extremely close together so if I was really claustrophobic I'd have some issues. But I'm not. So it's okay.\n\nThe sushi was very good.  I don't remember everything we had, but the sashimi was delicious as were the rolls.  I recall the seaweed salad and agedashi tofu being tasty as well.\n\nThough, the service was kind of horrendous.  Not only was the server incredibly unfriendly and standoffish, but the intervals in which our food came out did not make any sense.  I do agree with the traditional serving of sushi (not all at once)...but I'm pretty sure we received a roll before our appetizers and it was all over the damn place.  We had to ask multiple times for one of the rolls we ordered and the amaembi.  \n\nSo, it's one of those places you want to love...but you just don't.

I met the chef at Akiko's while volunteering so I may be getting better service but from what I observe, all the guests (well at least those who sit at the bar) get amazing service.  the chefs are really knowledgable about the sushi and really the best thing to do is just sit at the bar at get omakase (chef's choice).  The philosophy is \"I'm going to serve you what I'd want to eat.\" and that is pretty much the freshest stuff.  And their stuff is EXTREMELY fresh.  And mind blowing.  Their fish is over-nighted from all over the world and it certainly comes through in the taste as well as in your wallet but it is really worth the exorbitant price you pay.  OK, for ME it's worth the price I pay and that's like $100 a person.  For most, I have to say that $100 is just too much to pay for any meal so for those people, this is probably not the place for you.  Always make sure you have reservations going in.  It's pretty impossible getting seats on a walk-in save unless you are a regular then they would probably do their best to try to accommodate you.  Take a seat at the bar and let the chef's take care of you.  Your mouth will die and go to heaven.  Can't say enough good things about this place.", "author": "Nat L."}

When i looked at the menu, intially thought, ok, decent selection...but then saw the specials menu with the fish flown from Tsujiki Fish market from Japan and knew i'm in for a treat.  The selection was amazing, heck there were 3 types of Uni ( i ordered the one from Russia and boy was it good)\n\nThey allowed half nigiri order (1 piece sushi) so i was able to try lots of the specials.  Also being at the  bar I was able to chat with the sushi chef (came at 11:30 so wasn't too crowded yet since you never want to disturb the chefs at their art)  and knew I was in for a bigger treat.  He knows his stuff.  Watched him opened up unpacked filets of my order and watched him delicately sliced the pieces to perfection.  On top of this, for some of my white fish selections, he put in toppings from Yuzu to other sauces.  Meant \"no sauce\" needed.  LOVE it when the sushi chefs do this...as this is their interpretation of what complements each fish and you know it's fresh.  the mixed Yuzu topping and pickled real wasabi with the white fish orders was amazing.  Nicely balanced with acid and a little bitterly, which complemented the butterly fish perfectly.  Been to many sushi places and only had 3 places do this \"no soy\" interpretation.  \n\nOverall was extremely impressed.  Will say that the sushi chef did all the nigiri himself so you need to allow him time to work his art.  It's just not slicing fish, but also to put in his interpretation of what complements each fish.\n\nSummary:\n\nSelection: 5 stars\nFood and Taste: 5 stars\nService: 4 stars (water always filled and chef was great), took some time but worth the wait and you can see the chef takes pride in his work.\nambiance: 5 stars - looked cozy, dark, intimate settings\nLocation: 5 stars for me... can come here for lunch at work.\n\nDefinitely coming back.", "author": "Vien C."}

I had made a reservation a week prior and the lady on the phone was adamant on us being on time. She said \" If you are not here at 7:00 for your reservations, your table will be given to someone else.\" So we showed up right at 7:00PM and there was one other table there, it was NOT busy at all and the entire place was practically empty!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and it was still half empty when we left at 9:00. \n\nBtw, this place has no air conditioning and the back room felt like a sauna on a rare hot day in SF. They tried to stuff us at the very end table in the backroom but we requested to move by the door. The menu was meh, everything you expect to see at a average sushi restaurant. I tried the California, the forty niner, and some other spicy roll and everything was forgettable. \n\nATTENTION: no sake bombing here. They won't let you drop the sake shot into the beer so if you wanna have a little fun, you would need to pour your sake into the beer which is fine. I understand that some places are for that and some arent but i think it's the the way they approached the situation that was a little rude. I actually overhead a guy, possbily the manager talking to our waiter about us. Pointing his fingers at us and told our waiter that \" THEY CAN\"T DO SAKE BOMBS\". Treat me like an adult please. The price is average, a little on the pricey side but not completely unreasonable given it's location. Right between union square and financial district. \n\nI think this place would have been better for a quiet date night but definitely not meant for large groups.

I saw Akiko's on yelp, and the fact that it was a small sushi-counter type restaurant with a Japanese chef made me more willing to trust it and try it out (since it sounded like sushi bars in Japan), willing to expect pretty good sushi.\n\nIt's true the place doesn't look much on the outside, but the inside is great and well-decorated.  My friend and I chose to sit at the counter, partly so I could practice my Japanese with Tayashi-san, the sushi chef.  Everyone there was very nice and accommodating, and Tayashi-san was more than willing to converse with me (despite my poor Japanese) and answer questions about the menu.  While the menu had a fairly standard varied selection of Japanese entrees, we chose to stick to makimono and nigiri.  I'm glad we did--the hamachi was very soft and flavorful, and the shiro toro filled up your mouth with its buttery softness.  The maguro and sake were nothing to sneeze at either, and the dragon roll's unagi on top was cooked in a way I had never tried before, but was delicious.  And as with all good Japanese food, there was special care taken to presentation.\n\nThe biggest deal for me, though, was that the fish (particularly hamachi and shiro toro) was pretty much Japan-quality, which combined with the experience of being able to converse in Japanese with Tayashi-san made me feel like I was at a sushi bar back in Japan (even if the interior looked like a typical hip restaurant in the SF financial district, which is different from hole-in-the-wall Japan sushi bars).

The outer layer is slightly fried, so the texture was crunchy, but with a nice soft interior.  The only complaint I'd have is that I wish the roll had some avocado on it, but otherwise...great choice.

That's always a plus.  Our orders were taken within a decent amount of time however we noticed the couple sitting next to us who had looked like they had been there quite a bit of time - got their orders taken after us.  After we placed our order with the waiter - we had to remind him to serve us our drinks and for ordering dishes that didn't need a lot of preparation, the food came out way too slowly for our hungry tummies.  \n\nI ordered the chirashi here (one of my usuals) and I was pretty disappointed.

I will guess if they do a better dish display for the food, this restaurant might be one of the Michelin one star. \nAkiko offer seasonal import fresh food for sushi/sashimi, and that selection doesnt make you disappoint. \nfew dish worth to mention, first is the Hokkaido uni and osetra caviar! (I actually found this dish from someone's yelp review) it was a good combination,  especially how difficult to find a SF restaurant offer Japanese uni! and the price for that dish is reasonably good, $15 for a order of two piece.\nWagyu (A5+ grade)! if your budget allow, its a must try dish! $25 for order of two for sushi dish or $50 sashimi an order is quit pricy, but.....im telling you, if you want to try wagyu beef, this is it! sashimi was not recommend for wagyu, i guess is becuz too fat. I had so many wagyu beef before, most of them I had from some two or three stars Michelin restaurant, and other I had was in japan. Akiko make this wagyu beef the best I had so far, the taste and how well the meat was cooked just prefect! you will never had enough!  (again, only if you could afford it T__T )\nUdon, first i wanna say I dont like Udon at all! maybe its because most japanese restaurant use the Udon noodle you could bought in any supermarket and the taste like shit when it does. But Akiko's Udon noodle was good! again, one of the best Udon I had so far.... the noodle was real chewable but smooth! very nice!\n\nPrice for a auth Japanese restaurant is alright, my bill was $150 without tips tongiht for table of 3, and we didnt have any order of drink. \n\none thing was disappointed was the dessert menu suck! they only have ice cream and mochi ice cream you can pick from, and sorry, its NOT house make ice cream or mochi! so make no sense to order it. and the restaurant is hot ( I wonder do they have AC?!)\n\nAkiko become my famous japanese restaurant in downtown! will definably come back again! ^^", "author": "tao x."}

And, as you can tell by my nickname, I really enjoy sushi. So when I discovered Akiko's Restaurant, you can imagine that I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nMy bf and I sat at the sushi bar so we could watch the chef. It was an older looking japanese man as the head chef with an older woman as his sous chef. (Perhaps a married couple business?) He was a bit gruff, but throughout our meal he slowly warmed up after we chatted him up a bit. \n\nThe menu was simple. We ordered 3 rolls and some nigiri. The vivi was an unagi and white tuna salad with a garlic sauce. I'm not a fan of saucy sushi, but this was not too over-powering and delicious. \n\nWe also ordered the rainbow roll. I typically dislike crab salad, but he mixed it up fresh right when we ordered it with japanese mayonnaise, and boy did that make a difference! I was really yummy! The fish on top was very delicious too . One of the white fish was so good that I asked the chef what it was (Tai - red snapper) and ordered a Nigiri!\n\nWe also ordered the spicy tuna roll, which was a bit too spicy for me. I don't mind spice, but when I eat sushi, I want to taste fish. \n\nThe Hamachi Nigiri was like butter!\n\nIt was maybe a teeny bit more expensive than Sushi Toni, but the quality of fish and ambiance was worth it. \n\nAll in all, good food, good service, and good price.", "author": "Kealie G."}

It was a little fish-bowl-esq but still a charming little nook.  Noise level not too loud, cute cherry blossoms painted on the walls.\n(4) little touches-the real wooden hashi (chopsticks) were a nice touch, so were the randomly decorated little plates the food came on (not the cheapy plastic plates you get at other restaurants).  \n(5) price- not bad considering the quality of the food.  the rolls were priced reasonably, the combination teishokus a little pricey but probably worth it if it comes with all the little sides.  portions looked decent from what I could see around the restaurant.\n\noverall, great neighborhood establishment.  Also, the service was spot on.  The two waiters were no non-sense, super polite, but very efficient.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-17", "description": "I came here on a Saturday nigh with last minute reservations after running a quick-and-dirty query on yelp for \"yummy sushi\". \n\nThis place is right around the corner from one of my absolute fave places, Gitane, and since I walked through Claude Lane to get to Akiko's, I arrived in a great mood. \n\nI was immediately lead to the back \"main\" room and seated upon walking through the front door and within a few minutes, a couple glasses of water and a bottle of sake seemed to automagically materialize from thin air. I was really taken with the level of service at this family-run joint b/c it was prompt, friendly, and helpful without being intrusive or overbearing. I chose this place b/c I initially figured it best to have something \"light\" but in my heart of hearts, what I was really craving was udon. Nabeyaki udon, to be very specific, from Sushi Tomi in Mountain View. So imagine my delight when I saw the \"Duo\" section listing combinations with sashimi. Who offers udon with sashimi? I mean, really.  At any other resto, I'd probably be stuck trying to split a full udon order with a friend and subsequently, begging for scrap pieces of sashimi.  When the waiter came by, I asked what kind of udon the duo was and he mentioned the kitchen could add chicken or whatever I wished to it. Meekly, I asked if it would be possible to convert it to Nabeyaki w/ poached egg and I nearly exploded with joy when he agreed it could be done and assured me it wouldn't be a hassle (sometimes I feel a bit bad for 'customizing' orders). \n\nMy friend was tasked with ordering the sake and we had the $15/bottle of Hakushika. Neither of us are sake conniseurs and to be very honest, it was between this or a $32/bottle and I wasn't in a spendy (AKA: drinking) kind of mood but we were both very pleased with this selection. It was palatable, not too sweet or dry, was smooth, had some character and it wasn't so complex that you felt like you were drinking something you were unworthy of. \n\nWhile the udon I had appeared small, it was practically bottomless. SO MUCH FOOD. I guess I wasn't expecting there to be more seafood at the bottom b/c I was so happy with the veggies/meat/egg already. The duo came with maguro and sake sashimi and on the side, we ordered some type of hamachi (after finding out the kampachi was sold out). My friend had the chirashi which seemed a bit on the smaller side but then again, it was also less expensive (at $18) than most other chirashi bowls I've come across. The fish was fine and while I enjoyed my sake sashimi the most (despite not being a fan of salmon), I don't think I had enough of the fish to make a call on the quality of the fish. \n\nThe only thing I would pick on is the restroom's door. My friend went to the restroom and returned, claiming it was occupied. \"I didn't see anyone head that direction\" I replied. \"Neither did I\". Hrm.... about 8 minutes later, I went to the restroom myself, turned the loose knob a few times (it didn't 'catch') and pushed the (heavy!) door open. Ahhhh, I see. Then the thing slammed behind me and I felt bad for the party sitting 4 feet away (altho they didn't seem irritated nor did they seem to mind). Of course, I returned to the table with a smug look on my face and my friend greeted me with much eye-rolling before making his 2nd trip the restroom. Hah :D. \n\nAgain, service was fab. The busser was great when it came to refilling water glasses, the water carafe, taking away dishes, wiping down small spots of soup on the table, bringing extra spoons for dessert, and so on. I guess I take notice of such things due to my days of slaving away in the resto service business. \n\nWonderful, atmospheric little gem in the FiDi.", "author": "Ida C."}

The restaurant is very small, so reservations are highly recommended. We had the best table in the house up front by the window. The main part of the restaurant in the back is very tight and a bit claustrophobic with no windows. You also have to deal with everyone walking thru the narrow passage behind your table to get to the restroom. Ideally, secure a table up front or at the sushi bar. We did go with our 7 and 10 year old kids, and they were able to find items on the menu that they liked as they are used to us dragging them out to good places to eat, but there is no kids menu, and I would recommend not bringing children if they are in any way picky eaters.

Ok...it was raining outside, so that might have something to do with it. I have to warn you that the service is pretty slow. However, they make up for it with amazing sushi. \n\nThey have some pretty good rolls. We ordered the Dynamite, Volcano, and the 49er. Along with that we got some maki rolls and some nigiri. The sake nigiri was great! We definitely could have done with more of that.  Among the rolls, the 49er was our favorite. Good thing we were a bunch of 49er fans! The maki, however, was a bit disappointing. Again...not in quality or taste, but in size. \n\nRegardless, I really like this place. The prices are on par with other such small sushi restaurants like Red Box Sushi. The quality is pretty damn good. If you're in the area, definitely hit up this joint and order a 49er.", "author": "Samir P."}

There were some recommendations for the volcano roll, so I ordered that and the seaweed salad, figuring that was a good size meal.\n\nLittle did I know, the volcano roll is Ginormous with a capital G.  I don't even know how to spell ginormous but that's what it was.  It's got tons of goodies and the rolls are cut and stacked into a pyramid with tempura and salmon skin all around and crab on top.  Like an erupting volcano.  Love love loved the presentation and it was frickin' delicious on top of that.  It was quite possibly my favorite sushi roll that I've ever eaten.\n\nAfter a seaweed salad and half the roll, I was stuffed.  No worries - I finished it for lunch today.  Mmmmmmmm!\n\nThe restaurant is really cute with cool decor.  Very fancy looking.  With prices to match - no lunch specials and the volcano roll was $14.\n\nMinus one star for slow service.  I'm hesitant to do this because our rolls really were pieces of art, but does it really take over half an hour to make two rolls?  There was only two of us in the restaurant, after all.", "author": "Nilar H."}

Luckily, our server Alan offered to give us a \"fast\" version of the omakase, and boy did it deliver.  There were a few misfires, as nearly any omakase will have, but some of the highlights were among the best pieces of nigiri I've had - and this coming from someone who goes to Tokyo at least once a year.  If I'm counting correctly, we were treated to 16 pieces of top flight nigiri over about an hour and 15 minutes, and the presentation was spectacular.  Highlights included the baby shrimp with caviar that had an incredible texture, searred chutoro that was topped with charred uni (needs to be tasted to believed), and of course, the miyazaki wagyu topped with truffles.  While expensive, it's still cheaper than most top flight omakase experiences in New York, LA, and Tokyo, yet delivers a fantastic sushi experience for even the most practiced palate.  If you are someone who likes rolls and can't appreciate the different between colored horseradish and grated wasab, you might say Akiko's is \"overpriced.\"  However, if you are someone who truly loves sushi, I'd be hard pressed to think of a better option for straight nigiri in San Francisco than Akiko's.", "author": "Andrew B."}

I have just had an amazing sushi experience that deserves far more then 5 stars.\n\nA few disclaimers: I am a sushi purist, ie I hardly ever eat rolls or pre-selected sushi combos and I don't put soy sauce on pieces that don't deserve soy sauce. When my mother was pregnant with me, all she craved and all she ate breakfast, lunch and dinner was sushi (I'm 30 so they didn't know any better back then). Finally, I am from NY and since moving here 2 years ago have been wholly disappointed in SF's sushi offerings ... until today.\n\nThe sushi here is very fresh and delicious. The seaweed is very crisp - as it should be. The ika was sliced thin and scored a ton - as it should be. They were almost out of hirame and offered me an alternative that was truly comparable and outstanding (for the record I ordered 2 orders of hirame and got the last order available and one of the alternative). The ikura was sweet and not at all fishy tasting. The white tuna literally melted in my mouth...twice...I had to order another order it was so good. \n\nFinally, they had not one but two unfiltered sake options - my personal favorite - including one by the glass.\n\nI have found my favorite sushi place in SF.

Sakae in Burlingame would previously have held that position in my mind, but some fish quality inconsistency there in recent visits cause it to fall below the level of Akiko's.  Everything we ate was first-rate in quality.\n\nAkiko's space is familiar in that I remember eating in that space back in the 90's when it was a Mediterranean restaurant of some sort.  It is (in my mind) an optimally-sized restaurant and I like the space very much.\n\nService is really on the ball.  However, we didn't see any Japanese staff.  They serve tables each individual sushi item (more or less) as a single plate delivered with an explanation by the wait staff.  That is a service-intensive model, but the place is small enough they can pull that off with good timing.\n\nIn terms of taste, the house-blended shoyu (of which much is made) isn't really that special.  They might be better served by simply buying a high quality shoyu and saving themselves the trouble.  On the other hand, the taste of the blend might appeal to some people more than it did to us.  The uni they serve was absolutely first-rate, but it was just slightly too little uni relative to the nori wrapping.  So, to taste the uni, you sort of had to move it around in your mouth while chewing.  They might want to address proportions there.  We ordered one cooked appetizer, and afterward would call that a mistake.  This really is a place that is all about high quality nigiri and sashimi.  We also ordered one maki, and while it was very good, next time we won't waste stomach capacity on maki at this place.  The hara sake (seared fatty salmon) was absolutely wonderful as was really all the nigiri and sashimi items we had.  There was no keiji sake (baby salmon) the day we visited, so it just means we have to go back again very soon!\n\n$200 (pre-tip) for two people with no alcohol isn't a bargain.

We went based on the high reviews, and while It wasn't bad - it wasn't particularly good either.  We ordered 5 different specialty rolls.  I can't speak for the sashimi, but the rolls were all just kinda mushy and bland.  They looked good, and you felt like they should taste good, but they just didn't.  I thought it was just me but I found out afterward that the other two people felt the same way.  Also (and I know that this sounds petty, but it was annoying) - I shouldn't have to fight to get some pickled ginger.  We ordered 5 rolls.  There are 3 of us.  We would like more than 1 sliver each.

A wonderful combination of fresh, quality food prepared by talented chefs, served by a highly capable and knowledgeable wait staff.  We started with an order of shrimp and scallop gyoza coupled with a poached spinach dish, followed by a trio of amazingly fresh and perfectly prepared nigiri: amber jack, poached eel and copper river salmon.  Our 'entree' of a rainbow roll offered such a stunning array of tuna, salmon and avocado, that we decided to order the firecracker roll so that we could taste more that the kitchen had to offer.  We finished the meal with a creamy, delectable black sesame ice cream that was a perfect finish to a great meal.\n\nOne word of warning: the place is small and tables are at a premium every night of the week.

That treasure being raw fish, of course! Indeed, my fellow yelpers did not lead me to a disappointing hole, but rather I feel more like geocacher that's just made it to the indicated coordinates and removes a rock to discover the treasure hidden beneath. \n\nOK, so this sushi place isn't really hidden, but you could almost miss it walking by if you didn't know where you were going. In fact, my friend kept walking even after I stopped, not even realizing we were at a sushi restaurant. His attention was grabbed more by the Irish Bank Bar & Restaurant tucked down the alley next to Akiko's. The outside of Akiko's even looks like it may have been an Irish Pub back in the day. The inside is decorated to look like a run down building, some walls half brick, half stucco, and with wooden posts running diagonally from wall to ceiling.\n\nBleh, I must be bored at work or something, why am I talking about the building? The sushi itself really was good, but then, I'm not high-maintenance when it comes to sushi. As long as there are enough pieces of raw dead fish on my plate, I'm good to go.

We were seated right away and the place seemed nice.  After ordering 5-10 min within our seating time, it took 35 min for them to bring out our sushi rolls!! You do the math, but our break was pretty much over! As we were waiting, we saw other tables continuing to get 2nd and 3rd rounds of their order without us even getting our first roll!  The sushi was good, but the service was bad and I have never had to wait so long for a simple sushi roll..ever!  The only reason they don't get 1 star is because the food was pretty decent.", "author": "Jeff M."}

It's definitely a good idea to come early for lunch cuz by 12, them office people from the FiDi neighborhood just come swarming this place.  The restaurant itself is kinda small, so I'd guess it would fill up pretty quickly.\n\nThe decor is nice and kinda typical Japanese/sushi place; it's nice and comfy tho.  The service?  Ehh.. nothing too special to write about, just don't expect too much from them, I think....\n\nAs for the food, I think they're great.  Most entrees and rolls are priced 9-15 bucks, which I think is pretty average for Japanese restaurants.  Oh, for some reason, the tempura's tasteless.  Haven't tried their sushi though, it seems quite popular among other yelpers.  I most likely would come back to try other stuffs.", "author": "Erik C."}

We rarely come to San Fran (once or twice a YEAR) and when we do, we always come to Akikos.\n\nThe first few times were pleasant and enjoyable.  They had a large menu, quick service, and reasonably priced sushi compared to the sushi places in the East Bay. But this time, i noticed that they took off a lot of the sushi rolls (im not sure about the sashimi, not too big of a fan)\ni would always get the dynamite and the volcano whenever i come over but today,  i noticed that their menu changed.  Many of the signature rolls that they used to offer were gone.  I was looking forward to the spicy signature rolls, especially the volcano and the satisfying crunch that this establishment piled on top of a bed of spicy tuna roll.\nAnother problem (as mentioned numerous times below) is SLOOW SERVICE and a different order or serving us the food? Usually appetizers would come before the entree, in this case, an order of gyoza would be served before any of the rolls. Just my opinion\nOtherwise, what we settled for was still good but the fact that our favorite rolls were gone sort of got us thinking of looking for another sushi restaurant next time we come to SF.", "author": "Xavier L."}

I've tried a variety of dishes which I will discuss below.\n\nSushi Rolls I've Tried:  California, Dragon, Dynamite\n-  All three of these rolls are top notch.  Even the california roll (which is normally the same at every sushi place is actually pretty good.  They use fresh crab vs. the fake stuff and actually use very good ingredients.  Dragon and dynamite rolls are more of the complex rolls and they are definitely worth the extra few dollars.  All the fish is high quality and the rolls are put together nicely.\n\nChicken/Salmon/Beef Teriyaki:  I would recommend the chicken, then the salmon and I would stay away from the beef.  Beef seemed a bit chewy and tough, but the chicken and salmon were both really good.\n\nSashimi/Nigiri:  all legitimately fresh and tasty.  Nothing to write home about but still a solid 4 star quality for the price (5 star would be if you were getting way more than you expected for your money).\n\nSalads are decent and the yakitori is alright as well.  They use the same chicken in the chicken teriyaki as in the yakitori but the veggies on the skewer are very good as well (sauce that comes with this is perfect).\n\nWasabi:  they use real wasabi! the kind that separates into little balls when you mix it with the soy sauce vs. the tube kind that melts away.\n\nService:  the service is very good here because the people are very nice. always the same sushi chef and the same guy taking your order.    the only thing I would have to say is that if you're making large orders to go, it's going to take a while.  It's almost as if they don't start the sushi rolls until you get there to pick the food up.  Maybe they've had bad experiences with people not showing up?\n\nAtmosphere:  pretty dark inside and looks pretty ghetto from the outside but it'll surprise you once you step inside.  it's a nice homey feeling.  \n\nOverall:  good sushi, good for pickup or dine in, slow service due to the lack of staff but ok if you go when it's slow.", "author": "Paul C."}

Intimate ambience and decor, unassuming and attentive service, and deliciously buttery-tender nigiri. Have never sat at the bar, but the chef is always very friendly and greets us when we arrive. I love, love, love the a.j. roll... the spiciness is -- unlike cheap spices or hot sauces -- perfectly overwhelming without being nauseating or disruptive to the flavor of the tuna. \n\nDress code is business casual. Very reasonably priced -- a huge plus and pleasantly surprising for this part of town. Reservations are recommendable for groups but not necessary. (Also, check out the lovely restroom while you're there: despite being even more dimly lit than the restaurant itself, it's a world of its own... tiny, relaxing lounge-y feel, no mirror, hip and modern look, great hand lotion.)  \n\nBest sushi in the Financial District, by far!", "author": "G.

First impression was how nice and classy the decor looked. The wait staff seemed quite attentive and seated us at the table next to the window the moment we walked in. We ordered the volcano roll, chicken donburi and the 10 piece nigiri and sashimi. One word I must say is - expensive. This place has very fresh and good sushi but for the amount of food we received it was quite expensive - the two $$ don't justify the prices at the restaurant. However, when the food did arrive everything was quite delicious - the sashimi melts in your mouth and the chicken katsu was nice and crispy. The volcano roll was definitely something special with loads of tempura bits on top of the roll which were delicious enough to eat as is. Great sushi and very nice decor but the prices were quite high for the amount of food that was offered and I guess this would be a 3 1/2 stars but I guess the waiting staff wasn't as friendly or as attentive as they should be.

The waiter greeted us, was friendly and helpful. However, the sushi bar experience was lame and indifferent. This usually is the best seat in the house...not here! The Asian chef with the mustache, the sous chef, and the owner were behind the sushi bar and did not once greet us, smile, or ask us what we were interested in. They did not even take our order. We flagged down the waiter and ordered the 6 piece sashimi, volcano roll, rock n'roll, and salmon/avocado roll. The fish was very fresh and flavorful. While the food was very good, the indifferent and disengaged sushi chef (younger guy with mustache) and staff behind the sushi bar, slow pace of food coming out, and expensive, small portions just ruined the experience. We paid our bill with no follow-up on how the food was, if we wanted dessert or tea, or thank you from the anti-social sushi chef (specifically the Asian one with mustache in his early 30's, no hat on his head, and constantly wiping his sweaty forehead with his sleeve).

They have a good selection of rolls and also have a \"specials\" menu for fresh fish from different regions, although the specials are a bit pricey so we didn't get any of those.  I got the \"Duo\" sashimi/udon meal which was $19 for a big bowl of beef udon and 4 pieces of sake, maguro, and hamachi mmmm.

Our party was early so we stood around waiting for our seats to be vacant and the hostess told us if we could be quiet since people were having their dinner. Is it our fault they don't have a seating area for guests that have to wait, especially on rainy days like the day we went? Stand outside in the rain until our seats are ready? Eh. The food was really good though, I had the  teriyaki bento with tempura. Overall, it was a nice restaurant.

I've had volcano rolls at other sushi restaurants, but Akiko's was one of the best. Oh yeah, no sake bombs? What kind of Japanese restaurant does not do that? Apparently Akiko's.

We received a free sake and and ice cream on the house. \n\nWe ordered the dragon roll, volcano roll, and shrimp tempura roll, along with a plate of chicken teriyaki. Everything was great!

If you order the mixed sushi plate beware the pickled sock sushi, it's got yellow pickled something, tastes like gym socks, I asked what it was once, and I forget what it's called but she followed it with \"its really good huh? very tasty!\" sadly I really don't agree. Other than that though I really like everything there. Good miso, salmon teriyaki is tender and good, sushi is fresh and good.

I don't know why I never stepped inside before now, but I do know that I'm glad I finally did! The decor was a bit puzzling (partial exposed brick with some exposed piping and cement, with interesting, if confusingly religious? art on the walls), but welcoming and pleasant.\nThe atmosphere around 8pm is extremely quiet, unpretentious, and laid-back. The sushi is no-frills on the menu, but comes to the table with lovely presentation and great flavor! I personally recommend the Rainbow Roll. \nThe pricing is not unreasonable, especially for good sushi, but is still just a smidge higher than I generally enjoy paying. Certainly it was not unexpected for the financial district. After all, if you want cheap sushi in San Francisco, it's hard to find outside of the Richmond! \nThe service was not particularly attentive, but not by any means bad. I suspect that if we had sat closer to the front of the restaurant, we would have received more attention. As it was, we were in the furthest-back corner of the place, which proved to be cosy and private, and made up for the lack of attention.", "author": "Rachel C."}

I called way in advance to make reservations for a group of 18 people. The man I spoke to said that was fine to have a party of that size and they would reserve a table for us. He also asked if we had any special requests. I told him it was my 30th birthday and we were a big group of fun, loud females so to be prepared for that and could we have a fun waiter. I was partially kidding but also partially warning him that when 18 of my friends get together, we can be loud and like to have a good time. He said, no problem. He would take care of it and was happy to have us. My girlfriends wanted to suprise me by putting balloons in the venue at the corner of our table, so they called in advance to ask if that was okay. The guy said no problem. When they showed up with the balloons, the people in the restaurant were all bent out of shape about my friends bringing them which we found odd since they had asked. The waiter was super rude right from the get go and not happy to be serving such a large party. instead of us ordering ourselves, he said he would order the food for us to give us variety, but he must of ordered the most expensive things on the menu. We didn't have very much sushi and it was really expensive. Plus dinner took over 2 hours and each item would come well after the food was finished from the previous dish. The sushi was definitely good, but the high price, the fact that we were all still hungry when we left and the fact that the waiter was so rude to us really put a damper on the experience. He even tried to keep our change at the end of the night even though we had already paid our tip. They shouldn't accept reservations for that many people if they're going to be jerks about it and can't handle bringing food out for the amount of people we had.

I was on my way to Sushi Toni when I walked right past this place and decided, since it was closer, to pop in. The ambiance looked inviting and they had a sushi bar, so I sat down at the bar by myself. I ordered a nigori sake and small Sapporo. I had no idea where I was and what I was in store for, I just figured I would get some standard sushi at a quiet, quaint place near my hotel.\n\nI thought about doing omakase, but wasn't really that hungry and had my heart set on some standard nigiri - salmon, spanish makeral, tuna, etc... The waiter came over and made some recommendations and I ordered three nigiri sushi's. They were fantastic. It was then that the sushi chef asked me how I liked it. Turns out, the sushi chef is \"Joe\" the owner of the restaurant. I didn't even know the name of the place I was eating. I actually asked the sushi chef what the name of the place was and he handed me a card. At that point, I asked Joe to recommend stuff for me. I was not disappointed. In fact, nigiri after nigiri and handroll after handroll, I sat there and really thought hard about what I was about to tell Joe. I wanted to make sure I was being truly honest. He made me a handroll that was the best handroll I've ever had. I've had sushi at some of the best sushi places in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco and I'd never had a handroll like Joe made me.\n\nI'm so glad I happened upon this place and the next time I come back to San Francisco, this is where I'm going for sushi. Joe is a delight and provided me with some of the best sushi I've ever had. We toasted (kampai!) and had a great time. This place is truly legit and I really, really look forward to coming back.", "author": "Justin H."}

We happened to \"run into\" this joint as our real intent was to go to E&O, alas, it was closed for remodeling. We then decided to check out the restaurant in the alley, and \"ka-pow\"... Akiko. We both haven't been here before, so we decided to give it a try. We started with agadashi tofu and miso soup, followed with the spicy tuna roll, sashimi combination, and katsu don. \n\nThe agadashi was not the most flavorful I've had, the broth lacked the sweetness that I prefer. The miso soup was actually pretty decent because it was not salty like other places. That rates in my book. The spicy tuna rolls and sashimi combo (salmon, tuna and yellowtail) were fresh and palatable. The katsu-don, I can't comment on as I did not have a taste of it. But, if I were to rate it based on appearance, it looked it appetizing. My friend said it was tasty. \n\nMy only complaint is the snail's pace of the wait staff. The person setting up and cleaning was quick - it was the person that took the orders that was slow. It took a while, a long, while before he got to our table. To be fair, it was getting packed soon after we got there and he was the only wait person in the restaurant, and on top, we were extremely ravenous. Almost towards the end of our meal, he seemed more attentive and came back to our table to refill our teacups. \n\nOverall, it would be a place I hit up again if I were in the FiDi and wanted Japanese food. But, I can't really give it a 4 star as I need to try it out once more for consistency...", "author": "Carmen S."}

It's close to the Hilton - Financial District so it was an easy decision to drop in for lunch. I was dining alone and asked for the sushi bar which was pretty wide open. They stuck me at the worst seat by the register and service station. It makes sense so small groups can sit next to each other but I expected better service since I was in the middle of everything happening. Not the case. I had to ask for several things and ended up stealing a napkin from the spot next to me. Seriously, if you're going to put someone in the worst spot in your establishment, at least have the courtesy to treat them right. Why 4 stars? I had an excellent chirashi bowl. The fish was very fresh and the sushi rice was easily the best I've ever had. The sushi chef was rushed but managed to produce a perfect bowl of the freshest offerings. I did not punish the chefs on the tip as they excelled but someone needs to step up and figure out how to manage the restaurant.", "author": "Neil B."}

I've never sat at a table here, looked at the menu, tried a fancy-name roll, or visited at any time when they're busy (i.e. never on weekends or lunchtimes).  \n\nBut I have come here 15 or 20 times, to have sashimi and nigiri, always on a weekday evening when the chef (Joe) and host/server (his son) have plenty of unhurried time,   And if that is what you like to do, I can highly recommend Akiko's.  \n\nThe fish is reliably good & fresh, and often excellent & very fresh.  Joe chooses and cuts it well, likes to talk about the fish and steer you to the freshest choices.  (The uni is particularly fresh.)  After a few visits he'll remember you and what you like.  Then ask him to make you something interesting, whatever he chooses.  It'll be way more rewarding than yet another burrito-sized white person \"sushi\" roll with a fanciful name.\n\nUpdate 12/09:  Since posting the initial review, I've been to Aikiko's 15 or so more times, and I'm so happy with the consistency of the quality. that I'm now raising my rating to five stars.   \n\nJust for fun, I figured I'd remember some of the best things I've recently had at Aikiko's bar:\n- Hawaiian royal fish - this was divine, succulent flesh, and they only had it for a few weeks (its imported very irregularly).\n- Herring pressed in roe - sort of a sandwich of firm white herring flesh and salty yellow roe\n- White salmon - \"white\" meaning very fatty, sort of like the toro equivalent for salmon, delicious\n- Oysters - I forget the type, they came in a nice wooden box and we had them on the half-shell, the oysters were small, fresh, and very flavourful\n- Uni - Aikiko's continues to have the most reliably good uni of any sushi restaurant where I've been a repeat diner.   Really good uni is fresh, sweet and creamy - the texture is like ice cream - with no bitterness or stickiness.  Here they have really good uni 4/5 of the time and just plain good the rest of the time, and I've never had bad uni here.\n- There's more, but not a single roll is on the list.  I have still never had a roll here, and probably never will.  The fish here is really good, and stuffing it in a roll is just not the best way of enjoying it.  For me.", "author": "John L."}

Whenever I was having a bad day I would grab my friend Joyce and we would go here.  I would have the sake nigiri, the albacore nigiri, the california roll (they put a special crunchy topping on it that makes it extra delicious), and the aj roll.  And it would never fail to better my mood.  I'm a little further away now, so I don't go as often, but it's delicious every time.  Joe and Mary the owners are always there and are lovely people.  Their young son waited for a while a few years ago and he was super sweet.  He was later replaced by a bit older guy who has a little more 'tude but is OK  I guess. I don't usually have a lot of cooked food at a sushi restaurant but I do get the impression that the fresh fish is their strong point rather than the cooked food. Anyway it's all about the sushi and for good, simple reliable sushi downtown, this is the place to go.", "author": "cecilia g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-13", "description": "Feeling in the mood for Japanese food, but not wanting to stray far away from home, I decided it was time to pay a visit to Akiko, a small restaurant on Bush Street between Kearny and Grant. On a Monday night, we find this quiet enclave practically empty. Our waiter seated us immediately, at a table near the sushi bar. We barely had a chance to look at the menu before he was back to take our order (talk about quick service!) The menu is not extensive- although there are a variety of sushi choices, when it comes to regular food, the options are limited- a few udon choices, but no ramen or sukiyaki. We decided to start with edamame and a salad followed by various sushi rolls- egg and vegetables as well as the California roll among others. The edamame arrived first, steaming hot, in a cute dish along with a separate bowl for the pods. We enjoyed a bottle of hot filtered sake while waiting for the rest of the dishes to arrive- unfortunately I cannot remember the brand, it was very mild and slightly sweet. Next to arrive was the salad- greens with cucumbers, pickles and a ginger miso dressing presented artistically on a plate decorated with a sesame seed containing sauce as a garnish. I am usually a fan of Japanese salads due to the miso dressing, and this salad was no exception. Our rolls followed- pretty standard for sushi. I enjoyed the egg and vegetable, although the vegetables fell out when I was attempting to eat this bursting at the seams roll. Messy yes, but definitely tasty. In summary, Akiko is a fine place for some Japanese food, but I'll probably venture somewhere else in the future, just to expand my options.", "author": "Kate A."}
