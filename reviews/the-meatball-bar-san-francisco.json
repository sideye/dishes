I am trying to stay on the healthy side, so I got the quinoa salad that comes with two meatballs. The salad was actually a nice mix of lettuce, shaved asparagus, and quinoa. The lamb meatballs were tasty, although nothing out of the ordinary IMO. The salad dressing was nondescript, so I ordered a side of the classic tomato sauce (for an extra $2) - decently good enough.... I may have been at least a 3.5 stars, but the cost alone is enough to drop to 3. $13 for a salad for two balls? I would expected at least 3 like the sandwich. Also a little confused as to why you can't mix and match meatballs.

They were fresh fried and crispy golden on the outside, and had fairly good mushroom flavor. If I had encountered a smaller version of these on a appetizer menu, I would love them. However, given that these are 2\" diameter meatballs, the flour-y middle is hard to overcome. Truffle Alfredo sauce had amazing truffle flavor though.\n\nThe saltiness of the lamb meatball was a bit rough, although there was some good lamb flavor hiding behind it.

A couple of days ago I finally gave it a try during happy hour (M-F, 3-7 pm). I got the deal aptly named beer and balls ($10). You get 3 meatballs of your choice (turkey, chicken, lamb, pork, Italian etc.) along with the sauce (Classic tomato, pineapple BBQ, meat sauce, mushroom sauce, truffle fondue etc.) that you want. I decided to get lamb meatballs with truffle fondue sauce and a draft beer which I think was some IPA. The person taking my order tried to push some sides but I politely declined.\n\nEverything is premade, so by the time you take a seat with your drink you have the meatballs delivered to your table. Based on the reviews, I was expecting the meatballs to be bad, but they turned out to be average. The good news is that they were not hard but at the same time they were not soft and juicy either. The truffle fondue sauce was pretty good and made eating these balls a little pleasurable. Portion size was pretty small, just about right for a side that you can have with your drink, but for a full meal I would definitely add a side (salad, mashed potatoes, greens, spaghetti or risotto).\n\nPrice was it was a pretty good deal for happy hour and I would have no problem repeating. At full price it would be $13 with a side, which is what you would pay for a soup and salad combination at lunch in FiDi, so it's in line with other options in the area. 3.5 stars generously rounded up to 4, is how I'd rate this place.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I probably could have done with only 3 meatballs, but an order comes with 4, and I wadn't about to shaft myself a meatball!\n\nI usually love my food soaked in sauce, but the amount they provide was surprisingly sufficient.  But, I will say it isn't enough if you want to use the side of bread to stop up sauce.  Big plus that the spicy sauce was actually spicy.  Not spicy to enough to be a \"kick\" to the palette, but enough for a pleasant tingle on the tongue.  Those mashed potatoes though . . . So fluffy and buttery.  How do they do it?!?!?  So damn good!\n\nWorst part of lunch was the fresh juice.  I got guava juice, which was watery and barely guava tasting.  Next time, I'll just get water because that's free, and was pretty much what the juice tasted like.\n\nI hope they open a location closer to my office soon.

I'm not usually a meatball person but these were good. The spicy meat sauce really isn't that spicy. It adds a subtle kick but it's nothing overwhelming. The spaghetti was good as well. They give you a good amount, and it comes with its own spaghetti sauce. Lots of red sauce in this combo, haha. It also comes with a slice of bread, which tastes amazing when dipped in the sauce :) Total came out to be $14 something...which I thought was quite a bit.

They offer a variety of different flavors, from the classic Italian to vegetarian. Once you choose your ball, then you can choose your sauce: classic, tomato, pineapple BBQ, Korean Gochujang, spicy meat sauce, truffle fondue, and mushroom Demi-glaze. For 4 meatballs with sauce and a small chabatta bread it cost about $10. For an additional meatball it's $2.25 each. They also offer different sides such as spaghetti and mash potatoes.\n\nI ordered the classic Italian meatball with tomato sauce and a chabatta bread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-16", "description": "Love the concept; been waiting for the meatball craze to hit San Francisco after it caught on in NYC several years ago.  The format is stereotypically fast casual (or is the term fine casual now?), where you choose a meat, a sauce and optionally add on a side for plethora of personalized combinations.  The big drawback is that to make the meatballs versatile enough to pair with any sauce, they tend to go light on the flavoring.  Meanwhile, whether you're talking a about kofta or tsukune, meatballs typically are infused with all sorts of flavor components.  Hence, the sauce has to do the heavy lifting here.\n\nItalian Classic w/ Classic Tomato: If you're going to try a place that specializes in meatballs, you have to start with the traditional Italian style and loads of red sauce.  Given how many different spaghetti and meatballs we've eaten over our lifespan, it's tough competition.  There's is solid, but not quite up to the meatballs from your favorite Italian restaurant (or relative).  I found the meatball a bit too dense and lacking much flavor besides meat.  The sauce was nice though.\n\nLamb w/ Truffle Fondue: The lamb meatballs had a similar dense texture and lack of distinct flavor (other than lamb).  The truffle fondue was pretty awesome though.  More like the texture of alfredo sauce than fondue, but definitely true to cheesiness of fondue.  The truffle tones were pretty subtle and would probably earn a disapproving rant from Gordon Ramsay.  But for $9, you can't expect freshly shaven white truffles, so it was just fine.\n\nKiwi Aqua Fresca: A little too much aqua and not enough fruit or sugar.

I ordered the Italian meatballs with spicy meat sauce.  I figured they would do a mediocre job, and I could go about my business having learned a lesson.\n\nTo my surprise (I'm a professional Italian), the meatballs were pretty good.  Not good like the meatballs I make, and certainly not good like my grandmother used to make, but \"American\" good.  At least they used high-quality ingredients, which I didn't read about, I could taste.\n\nI still think the odd kinds of meatballs they offer is just hipster bait, but you gotta do something to get people in the door.  They've got that down.  The line was out the door.  Fortunately, they move fast and most people were getting their meatballs to go, so it only took a few minutes to place my order, which was delivered to me at one of the community tables within three minutes.\n\nAnd about the pricing...yeah, it's a bit much for lunch, but they are not exactly in a low-rent area, and overhead is no doubt pretty high.

I came in today an hour before closing and ordered the truffle sauce on pork meatballs. My fianc\u00e9 got the meat sauce on Italian meatballs. It was so good! I hate bad Italian food (and there's a lot of that in America), but when it's done right, it's so yummy! Meatballs were perfectly cooked, juicy, and well seasoned. I wish I had the recipe! And both sauces were amazing!! We ordered the mashed potatoes, but they ran out so we got the spaghetti instead and I'm so glad we did! Pasta was perfect, sauce on it was so authentic and balanced. It was heavenly! \n\nOther things to appreciate about this place:\n- ciabatta bread is really good here and served with every plate\n- extremely filling-- we ended up taking 3 meatballs home between the two of us\n- this place gets an A+ on style points. World clocks on one wall, and it was either spaghetti pasta makers or meat grinders on the other (I didn't look too closely). But this place is just so cute right down to the pails of utensils\n\nWhat I'd change if it were my restaurant:\n- I'd get rid of the curtain in front of the bathroom door all together. Not needed and brings attention to the door too much\n- food came out scalding hot and I burned the roof of my mouth :( I'd appreciate really hot food if it were to go, but otherwise let's keep it at a reasonable temperature so I can wolf down my food without burning myself\n- there should be music playing \n- please stay open until 8pm so I can go there for dinner more often :) \n- this place should have happy hour specials too if they have a drink menu!\n- meatballs should be offered on a bed of spinach for another $1 or so. It'll make it more lunch-friendly and feel healthier (all the veggie options seemed heavy too). This place reminds me of Dig Inn in NY in that the food is perfectly balanced/seasoned and Dig Inn has meatballs on spinach and it's so good! This place has better meatballs though \n\nDefinitely worth a try.", "author": "Holly M."}

The business is in a \"soft opening\" period, having started operations yesterday. Staff was very nice, there was a glitch with ringing me up but they were appropriately apologetic about it. Our food orders (to-go) came very fast! The business is definitely ready for financial district speed!! Trouble is, we all found the meatballs a little bland. I had the meatballs with marinara sauce and a side of mashed potatoes. Potatoes and sauce were good, but the meatballs were dense and not very flavorful, and a little dry. I tried my friends' sauces, a Korean one and Mediterranean one, and my favorite was the marinara sauce. The Mediterranean sauce had a strong spicy flavor, and the Korean sauce was very sweet, but we all agreed the meatballs needed some seasoning on their own.  Honestly, for $17+ for meatballs, side and a tiny bottle of Diet Coke, I probably won't be going back. Yes, I know it's the financial district (I've worked 1-2 blocks from here for nearly 13 years), and to be fair the portion size was decent -- but it felt more like it should be more like $13-14 compared to similar meals in the area.", "author": "Dave M."}

Boss went yesterday, hated the meatballs, he said he could have played golf with them. I can't disagree, the two varieties I've tried have been far too tough and hard, a meatball shouldn't be difficult to cut with a knife.  Other folks in the office that have tried it were also underwhelmed and won't be back.  I may try it again, maybe third time's a charm, but I'll need a serious craving for comfort food and a spare $14.  Honestly, I give it a year. Once the novelty wears off, I can't see people paying that much money for mediocre balls.", "author": "Yolanda B."}

I think the waiting time was not so long and service was good. Also, the restaurant atmosphere was fancy and neat. \n\nI ordered Italian classic balls with classic tomato and spaghetti on the side. It was not bad. I mean surprisingly it was plain. I know I ordered really typical tomato meatball spaghetti, but I expected more than that, because this place is a MEATBALL specialty restaurant. Plus, it costs about $14.\n\nI think the price is quite expensive compared with its taste. I think I can have that kind of tomato meatball spaghetti anywhere, even lower price.  \nNext time, I'll try other dishes and then I'll decide to leave this restaurant on my list.", "author": "Jalim K."}

You should be able to cut meatballs with a fork, they should be tender.  The first week, I tried the Italian meatballs with a side of spaghetti and tomato sauce.  The spaghetti and sauce were good, cooked al dente, but the meatballs were spicy, tough and dense.  I went back the following week to give another try, and had the lamb meatballs with creamy mashed potatoes, and  mushroom sauce.  The mashed potatoes were decent enough, but the same situation, the meatballs were dense, spicy and actually didn't taste much difference between the two, except for the sauces.  How can meatballs not be tender, do they arrive frozen, then thawed?  The prices here can be high for lunch, if you purchase a side.  I wouldn't care if the meatballs were wonderful, but unfortunately I could make these better myself fresh.", "author": "Ms. C."}
