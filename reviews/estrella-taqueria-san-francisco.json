Or, in my case, have too many beers next door at Toronado and stumble in to demolish some food.\n\nEstrella Taqueria has a great vegetarian menu (something you don't find too often in the area) as well as choice of 4 different kinds of tortillas (flour, whole wheat, spinach or tomato).  I went for a veggie 'bowl' (no tortilla) with black beans, rice, grilled veggies, tofu and pico de gallo.  The service was super friendly and the guy even cooked up some veggie on the spot for me as they didn't have any prepped.  He explained the beans weren't cooked in lard (seems this has changed from the past) so great for vegans/vegetarians.  I also went for a side of chips and guac and loaded up on the spicy salsa for the serve yourself salsa bar in the corner.  The veggies, tofu and beans were okay a little bland so I added some hot sauce to kick it up a notch.  The guac was really disappointing.  Somehow super watery and no flavor at all (gimme some salt!), maybe they over mixed it or it was made in the morning and just not fresh by the time I got it around 7PM at night but this place does not do guac justice! agh!\n\nAnyway.

(I can't speak to their online ordering complaints though, of which there seem to be quite a lot.)\n\nI feel like it follows a model similar to the taquerias in the Mission, except it's not in the Mission, and that confuses and disturbs people who wandered in from Hayes Valley or the Marina who were expecting something more like Tacolicious or Little Chihuahua.\n\nThe cook asks you what you want in your burrito like they don't know what goes in a burrito? That's the way most taquerias operate. Even Chipotle does that. Go to Chevys if you can't be bothered. You couldn't exchange your food for something else after you started eating it? What restaurant does that? It's not a sweater that ended up not fitting right.\n\nThe food is fast and they assemble with practiced precision. They prepare it right in front of you and let you choose the ingredients, so I am not sure how other people have gotten their orders wrong or claim that the meat is microwaved. The produce has always looked fresh and vibrant. The food has always been really tasty and filling, though I agree with the reviewers that said their burritos tend to be wetter. I am not sure if it's because the produce is wet or the amount of salsa or what. I would also agree that it's not a place to go to for the decor and the ambiance.

You will become full of disappointment when your food actually arrives. \n\nOur meal actually arrived in a timely manner, however the contents of said meal was quite disappointing. The \"crispy\" tacos were anything but. So soggy all the innards fell out the bottom of the shell. Prawn tacos were mostly lettuce. The super taco means \"please slop on as much guacamole and sour cream as humanly possible (because who wants to eat tacos with their hands anyways).\" Speaking of sour cream - if you order the Super Nachos and ask for \"sour cream on the side, please\" this means you will get some chips with a SEA OF CREAM on top of them. Literally, the most sour cream I have ever seen on top of anything in my life. I'm talking an entire small tub of sour cream. Please, no.\n\nWhen we called to get new nachos, made correctly, they told us we needed to call through GrubHub since we used them to order and that it would take and hour to get the new nachos. After talking to GrubHub, waiting about 30 minutes for a response, we are then told we can either get a refund for the nachos or wait an hour and a half - two hours to get a replacement. What? No. Just give me my money back, this is ridiculous.\n\nSo seriously, save yourself the trouble and do not get food from here. I can't say if it's any better if you actually go there in person, but just put \"delivery tacos\" on your list of things that are just too good to be true.", "author": "samantha g."}

It's extremely close to my house so I've gone quite a few times. The food is good as long as it's done right. You can get a pretty good burrito. You can get a pretty good quasadilla. However, don't get fancy! Their supreme-something-blah-blah quesadilla is gross. They put sour cream, guac, salsa, and other mystery liquids into the quesadilla before grilling it. It comes out a soggy, sticky, perplexing hot mess of a quesadilla. Just get a meat, cheese, and maybe veggies. \n\nAlso, they're very stingy about ingredients. For example, I ordered a burrito. I don't get beans in my burrito, but I like cheese so I asked for a little extra cheese. They charged me $1 or something crazy like that for a few morsels of extra cheese. I kind of get it, but I didn't get a bunch of other ingredients that are included. To me, that's just stingy. \n\nAnyway, I don't love this place but I'll probably continue to go.

If you like wet burritos and chorizo id say give this place a shot. \n\nThe chorizo is cooked fresh, and then pre-paired with all the fixings including a choice of tortilla, i get the spinach tortilla, beans, rice inside then smothered in sauce. Its topped with sour cream, guacamole  and cheese. The sauce they use has a little tang to it, a smooth mild flavor. It pairs nice with their hot sauce on top, which is also included. The chorizo is spiced nicely, but not over the top. It isnt to greasy like chorizo can be. The overall flavor is good of this creation; seasoned nicely, a good tang from the lime, salted correctly, and the right amount of food. I suspect the wet sauce is what adds the richness of flavor and depth of character. Would it not be for the wet sauce it probably wouldnt be as good, it just brings it all together.\n\nThis is a classic mexican joint that has the meet pre-cooked (other than the chorizo wich is cooked to order) and why i never order anything other than the chorizo. Of course things like marinated pork in green sauce and what-have-you need to be pre made, i get that, but because of this i find its better to order things that are cooked fresh and not from the hot warmers. This is a general statement about all mexican joints with warmers. \n\nI have noticed if you dont watch them make the food, they have a tendency to get things wrong, like giving me a regular tortilla instead of a spinach one. So make sure your clear, patient, and pay attention when they start your order. \n\nI can see how people may think they are rude, but lets be honest, if you are rude first why would you expect them to be super nice. Gotta put out what you want to recive back.\n\nAll and all, its a decent spot for a wet burrito with chorizo. If you order anything else, with the exception of their veggie items, which are all good, i wouldn't expect anything to rave about. I have had way better super burritos so these are not really worth mentioning here. \n\n3 stars for the chorizo wet burrito. \n\n2 stars over all.

I've been here twice and they don't greet you as you come in (come on now, at least smile, I am giving you my money and you a reason to continue operating). The food also seems to have been sitting out for a while since all the sauces, ingredients are in metal (heating) canisters with a thin film on top where you can tell the sauce with meat/veggies hasn't been stirred in a while. I just try to stick to the non-meat items (even though I'm not vegetarian and have a tough tummy) so I don't feel sick later. The veggie burrito for less than $5 with rice, beans, cheese, salsa is an awesome deal, I'd recommend getting that!\n\nThey do give you a good amount of food for the price though.

The ham was \"blah\" as the best way I can describe it. the bread was stale, avocados seemed fresh, the ham was nothing special by any means. The Cubana looked heftier with much more contents, sausage, egg, ham, and some kind of meat patty. The bread tasted better on the Cubana because it had butter on the inside halves of the sandwich. Everything was edible, but mediocre except for the meat patty. I could barely bite into it. I pulled it out and tried biting a piece off, but I had such a difficult time, I decided to give up on the meat patty. One torta and a drink costed me $14.41!!!

Absolutely no flavor at all.\n\nI feel bad writing this, because I really want this place to be good, and succeed; but unless they realize that their food is just not good, it won't happen.

It's not like she threw meat and cheese into a tortilla and then a sandwich suddenly appeared.\" \n\nMuch to my chagrin, they threw that burrito in the trash and she made another.

Food is fresher and the staff is friendlier.   \nOnly complaint is on the beans having lard, as they should be vegetarian with veg oil added.", "author": "John C."}

Was delivered the wrong order and was not offered any compensation, refund, or exchange. I spent a few minutes on the phone with someone who admitted that he'd read the order wrong and then he said, \"Next time just call here and place an order\" (I'd ordered via GrubHub). Yeah, not calling them again.", "author": "Kim K."}

SO obnoxious. The food tastes alright... the carnitas were good but too salty. Also they didnt give us any lemon or lime wedges so now i have to go down the hall and hope i dont walk in on my roommate and the guy she brought home.", "author": "Caitlin G."}

I was so pissed I didn't even buy anything at 1am so u know I wanted something! My homegirl cracked up and we shared her high priced a$$ burrito which was nothing to write home about but enough to fill the void in your stomach. Bottom line is the stars are because they are open until 2am.", "author": "Niah N."}

Feelin a bit haggard and not in the mood to leave the house, I placed an order for delivery. The lady who answered the phone sounded very confused and I had to correct my order several times. She then told me I had to text her personal cell phone my address. That was weird.... An hour later (I mean ordered 2 burritos and live on the same street?) I called to check on my order. The gentleman who answered set the phone down to check on my order. I heard him and what I am guessing is his wife laughing about the customer who waited \"un hora\". He then left me on hold for 5 minutes before picking up the phone and telling me I never texted them (which I did). I then verbally told him my address and asked him to bring it down. He then told me I would have to text his wifes phone my address for a delivery. Out of pure frustration I hung up the phone. I wouldnt't ever try this food after being mocked and laughed at.", "author": "Holmes C."}

Delivery took well over an hour and when the food arrived the tacos were wet and chewy and gross. So I tried a burrito. Yuck. This is the worst Mexican food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. I ate about a third, gave up in disgust and threw it in the trash along side the tacos. I paid $28.00 for this crap and learnt my lesson. DO NOt eat here.", "author": "Tony C."}

Now after countless visits, hoping it would improve, I have to update my review to only 2 stars. Service, is great. The food is just lackluster. Papalote has it's wonderfully wrapped burritos with the most delicious sauce. Cancun has just overwhelming large and filling eats, and Little Chihuahua just kills it with high quality and a great price. This place just needs to increase the flavor and quality of their burritos.", "author": "Devon C."}

However, after over an hour of waiting for delivery we called to see if everything was ok. the man who answered the phone said that he would call the delivery guy and see when he would be arriving and give us a call back. we thanked him and waited another 20 min then got a call and went down stairs where we saw that  their was in fact no on there. after waiting about 5min we called to ensure they were on the right st. the guy said hold on and put the phone down and started laughing and picking on us for still calling. once he returned to the phone he asked our address. so we said thanks but we will no longer be using their business and hung up.

I have to say I was a bit taken aback from the reviews so I suppose my expectations were lowered. The food came within an hour, and it arrived hot. I ordered:\n\nbreakfast chorizo burrito, which if I don't say so myself, is pretty awesome.\n\nWe also ordered the tacos- al pastor and chicken- my advice- skip these. Not too much flavor, pretty dry, and the soft corn tortilla broke within the first bite. \n\nAlong with those two items we also ordered a chili relleno, which was A-Ok. \n\nI would order here again!\n\nThanks Estrella Taqueria!", "author": "Blair H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-10-20", "description": "First off it's the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Really! I've been eating Mexican food my whole life. I grew up & hour from the border of Baja. My mother can make better Mexican food & she's not even Mexican. I thought Mexican was supposed to be like sex... even when it's bad... it's still good. Not in this case.. it's just BAD. They do deliver if you're desperate. They seem to be the only Mexican food place that does. But, think twice this is what happened to me last night after ordering food off of Grub Hub. \n\nI called to check on my order because it had been an hr & a half late. The woman had know idea what I was talking about & could barely speak English. She said she'd call me back. She didn't so I called her back. Then she hung up on me! Then for the next 40min I kept calling & the phone just kept ringing. Now they were purposely ignoring the phone!!! Then 2 hrs later the food shows after we already ate dinner!!!!!\n\nHERE'S A DESCRIPTION OF MY ORDER: **Food arrived cold**\n\n1 prawn quesadilla. Only 3 shrimp in it! The shrimp was fishy, not fresh & over cooked\n\nBurrito did not have the sour cream on it that I specially ordered & paid for\n\nWas missing the drink we paid for\n\nThe taco salad had no cheese or guacamole on it. The lettuce was soggy because they obviously forgot to deliver it. That's why all the food was cold!\n\nSo now they owe me money. Guess I'll have to go personally in there to collect it. THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!", "author": "april m."}

I'm not from this part of town, but I had a super taco with carnitas and a cheese quesadilla, both of which were quite good. Liked the salsa.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-15", "description": "The food is cheap, and I ordered delivery. It took them almost 2 hours to deliver the food (1 hour of the estimated time) and when we called to check the status of the order (about 1 hour and 25 minutes in) they said \"20 more minutes\". When we explained that it had already been over 1 hour, the man on the other end said \"we will call you back\" and never did. \n\nOn top of that, they messed up our order. Like I said, the food was decently priced, but the customer service was terrible. I can find similar, if not better, food with a faster response time and a better customer experience. I was very disappointed.", "author": "Corin D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-15", "description": "This review is based solely off of the one menu item that kept me alive the first few weeks I lived in the lower haight and had not yet been grocery shopping. The super taco! This perfectly proportioned 2 tortilla masterpiece piled high with beans, rice, meat, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guac... pretty much everything you would find in a burrito, \"taco\", is a whole meal in itself and is still under $5. Perfect for someone like me/ pretty much anyone who orders a burrito and gets to the halfway point where the, \"do I just go for it and polish this baby off or am I good and wrap the second half up for later (which usually ends up being an hour later)\" game is played. Minus one star for the never warm chips and the mediocre salsa, but hey, you get what you pay for and they're free with the super taco.", "author": "Lauren S."}
