Although you could seat up to 6 people for a $35 session, we decided to try it with our small party anyways. First, we had to choose 4 teas out of the 8 options available. Then, a kind lady sat us down and guided us through the teas. \n\nA few things I would like to note about that place is that I loved how clean and tidy the place was! The cleanliness of the place definitely made the experience great. Also, the lady who served us was very kind and answered any of our questions. Last, I personally loooved the Formosa Red #18 tea and would definitely recommend trying that one! It has such a natural sweet flavor despite not having any sweetener added, and it smells delicious!", "author": "Julia S."}

A salesperson sits with you through the tasting to explain and prepare the teas, and tries to sell you teas and glassware, etc.\n\nMy first disappointment was that they did not put any effort into helping us select which teas to taste. In hindsight we really should have browsed the store and picked some out before talking to a salesperson.\n\nThe actual teas we tried were pretty good, as was the preparation. The salesperson rambled through a script full of half-truths and posudoscience about the benefits of tea as we went, which I found somewhat annoying. Once the core tasting was complete we were left alone to enjoy the extra tea, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nI did end up buying some leaves, but in general the prices seemed quite high and the experience was not good enough to make me inclined to buy more.", "author": "Christian P."}

Having tried tea up and down Grant Ave. in Chinatown I think Red Blossom is the best, by far.  Although the store may look new and modern, they have actually been in business for over 30 years.  This family owned store is serious about sourcing pure and quality tea and I think their clean and minimalist displays echo that sentiment.  \n\nAlice, who I presume is the owner, grew up in the tea business as her father was the entrepreneur of this great shop.  Alice is very knowledgeable about tea - not just from reading about it, tasting it and growing up in the business but also from traveling to China to visit tea plantations.  She visits tea plantations once or twice a year to see the process followed by farmers and to make sure they are not directly using pesticides or getting overspray of pesticides from neighboring farms.  Given Red Blossom's attention to detail it is not surprising that their tea is featured in many Michelin-Star restaurants throughout the United States.  The many varieties of teas sold at Red Blossom are perfect as is - there is no need to doctor them with milk of sweeteners. \n\nAlice is not just an expert in Chinese tea, she is an expert in the tastes and customs of tea served around the world.  I really appreciate that her context for tea extends beyond that of China and that her personal ties to England have given her another perspective.", "author": "Courtney K."}

I loved how they had tea lining up along the shelves and how in the front you could try the tea they had there. The tea was very good. I first walked in that store last summer and I keep ordering tea from there. I recently ordered 4 oz of the honey orchid oolong tea for about 60$ and I would highly recommend it. Another great one is the golden monkey first pick black tea and that was the first tea I bought I would also highly recommend ( about 17$ for 2oz ). They also have very nice tea sets. When I was there I bought a 20$ tea set and I use it frequently. The costumer Service was amazing they were very friendly and helpful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-13", "description": "Red Blossom is a fantastic tea shop for the beginning to intermediate tea drinker, and I love that they're conveniently located near my apartment, and near Chinatown where I like to buy other things.  Red Blossom covers your fundamentals, so they'll have great quality selections of the most famous / classic Chinese teas, and starter teaware at reasonable prices.  I can always find an excuse to drop by Red Blossom.\n\nIf you're looking for more rare, aged, specialty teas and artisan ceramics and are willing to pay accordingly for them then I recommend Song Tea & Ceramics in Pac Heights (see my review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/song-tea-and-ceramics-san-francisco-2?hrid=tHJ7jtRMpgPWhAQRGmSChA)  I've found that Song's selection is much smaller and skews heavy on oolongs and a few red teas, so if you like whites or greens you might be disappointed.\n\nThe ambience in Red Blossom is clean and modern, and usually pretty busy.  They have 3 gongfu tea setups so they can serve about 12 - 15 people, but it's not the kind of place you can dawdle and taste tea all day.  They do try to discourage you from trying too many teas that are similar to each other, or teas they can tell you won't like.  I wish I could try more teas without feeling guilty but I suppose that's fair, the tastings are for customers who are actually planning to buy and just need to decide which varietal to buy.  If you want to sample the tea ceremony without purchasing tea, you can book a tasting and I think it costs about $10 or $15 per person.\n\n\n\nGeneral review of Red Blossom's teas, by type:\n\n---- GREEN TEA ----\nAll their Dragon Wells have a beautiful buttered toast aroma and flavour.\n- Pre-Rain Dragonwell:  bought this one as it's their cheapest Long Jing, finicky to brew but gorgeous clear fresh flavour\n- Cloud and Mist:  Fragrant, versatile, cheaper and easier to brew than the PRDW.  Next on my to-buy list.\n- Huang Shan Mao Feng:  Not my favourite, but good for people who like more grassy flavour\n\n\n---- OOLONG TEA ----\n- Jin Xuan Winter Sprout:  so buttery and sweet, my partner bought 2oz of this and almost finished it within a week\n- Heritage Golden Buddha:  creamy, smoother younger cousin of Da Hong Pao.  This tea has one of my favourite aromas of the teas in my collection (~40 teas)\n- Da Hong Pao (Beidou):  they take great pride in the fact that this is a close descendant of the Da Hong Pao mother trees, it was good but I'll need to taste it again before buying\n- Wenshan Baozhong:  beautiful light aroma of a greener Taiwanese oolong, but leaves only last about 2 infusions\n\n\n---- RED / BLACK TEA ----\n- Formosa Red, Assam:  gorgeous aroma, smooth, not sweet.  Partner bought this\n- Formosa Red #18:  slightly sweeter version of the Assam\n- Three Cultivar:  one of my favourites at a reasonable price, but then I'm inclined towards Wuyi oolongs\n- Golden Monkey, First Pick:  malty, caramelly, excellent\n\n\n---- WHITE TEA ----\n- Bai Mudan (White Peony) tasted rather old, not the best.  For fresh white teas I love the selections at Teavivre.com\n\n\n---- TEAWARE ----\nThe teaware Red Blossom carries is higher quality and thus more expensive than most of the temptingly cheap stuff you can buy online from China (and many other US importers).  The tea trays especially are gorgeous but the stone ones will run you a mind-blowing $400+!  (Makes sense, because the shipping from China alone for a similar stone tray I found on Taobao costs at least US$160.)\n\nI want to call out Red Blossom's basic Jingdezhen Spring / Summer gaiwans, incredible value for US$28.  (I bought one of these for my partner and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a first gaiwan.)  It is made of very thin but sturdy porcelain, and they actually use those models in the shop for tea tastings every day and they don't seem to chip or stain easily.  For similar prices (US$10 - $24) I've bought 4 gaiwans on Taobao, Ebay and the like, that look good but the material and workmanship are coarser (for example, thicker porcelain that tends to burn the tea or blunt the aroma).  Am saving up to buy another of Red Blossom's plain gaiwans for myself soon.", "author": "Letitia L."}

I love taking high tea English-style with all the pretty silverware & pastries, and also drink \"tea\" on a day-to-day basis. Alice opened my eyes to the world of authentic, high-quality teas. For example, I learned that herbal teas are not really teas in the traditional sense, since they are mostly just flowers and herbs steeped in hot water. Also, the English tradition of taking tea usually calls for adding cream and sugar/honey to your tea, which, if the tea is of high quality, ruins the experience and masks the tea's true character and beauty. \n\nAlice took great time and care in explaining the different kinds of tea to my husband and me (white & green, oolong, & black teas). Very informative & enlightening! I love wine and have a fairly educated palette, so Alice used lots of wine references for me to relate to, since tasting wine and tasting tea are similar experiences.

Fun fact: Lapsang Souchong really isn't meant for drinking in the world of Chinese teas--it's mainly used for cooking. Who's making Szechuan tea-smoked duck in the near future? Meeeeeeee! :)\n\nI've visited pretty much all the tea shops in Chinatown and this one stands miles above the others in terms of service (friendly), knowledge (robust), decor (clean, modern and simple), quality (high) and prices (fair and actually cheaper than Aroma in several instances). Don't be put off by its location. It's anything but a tourist trap.", "author": "Josephine L."}

No wonder why the tea bags bought at the grocery store (anything in tea bags for that matter) can be so bitter - I am told those leaves are the just bits and pieces leftover from the tea houses!  Just look how supple and fresh these tea leaves look after steeping, not like the dry, crackly bits and fragments you normally get: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZG0CRrkc9i-AGnea3CeWYw?select=RmcjO6uz5YCaKdZpQH5Dgw \n\nI did not know that the loose leaf teas carried by stores like this can be steeped several times.  I love jasmine tea and I fell in love with their \"blossoming\" type (also called flowering or blooming teas).  Tea leaves wrapped with dried flowers take the form of a bulb for drying and storage, the little bundle of leaves and petals unfurl and \"blossoms\" and have an amazing aromatic fragrance, looks so pretty and such a joy to sip on!  Here's how it looks in my personal steeping vessel, also bought at Red Blossom:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZG0CRrkc9i-AGnea3CeWYw?select=sRTGEYFm62TGqMmVWQXNGw\n\nThe folks here are really nice, so well versed and are always happy to give a lesson and tasting.

My apologies.\n\nAlice has been the owner since her parents retired and she has kept the family tradition intact. Her brother Peter now sells very high end teas at a different shop in San Francisco, but Alice has kept the original shop the way her parents ran it. It was through Alice that I became a full-time tea addict, and I am forever grateful. I have probably bought about half of the teas on the shelves by now.\n\nThis shop sells mostly teas sourced from Taiwan, but also has a selection of Japanese greens, if I remember correctly. They also have flavored teas like Jasmine and those fun flowering teas. I gave a friend some black tea flavored with rose petals and it was a huge hit. They have teas at every price point, but the prices are definitely going to be higher than the teabags at the store because you're not getting junk. \n\nI've never made an appointment for a tea tasting. That said, I've had tea tastings here many times and it's one of the reasons I stay pretty loyal to this shop because this is how I ended up learning about many different teas. Try asking for a tasting when they're not busy. \n\nGreat place to venture out into the world of teas. \n\nMy preference tends to lean toward sweet, buttery, creamy, yet citrusy. That's why I'm really into their greens and lightly oxidized oolongs lately, so take what I have to say below with that in mind.\n\nMy faves right now are: \"Our Finest Dragonwell\" (the priciest one, but that one goes fast because it's super buttery and rich and amazing, totally worth it.) \n\nAlso, I am really into their high mountain oolongs right now. My daily tea choice is usually their Wenshan Baozhong; this one is very sweet and creamy, not as watery and citrusy as I've had elsewhere. My other daily tea is their Alishan (very buttery last year) and the Fu Shou Shan (despite the fruity, floral overtones this has a nice backbone that I typically just drink by itself, no food).  Love the Lishan as well. I love their Heritage Grand Scarlet Robe Wuyi oolong (very dark, charcoal roasted oolong). If I recall correctly, this is the one that someone suggested drinking while eating a chocolate cake. I haven't tried that yet.\n\nAssams are typically Indian teas, but I really like the Taiwanese sourced \"assams\" that they have here. I really love the Organic Formosa Red assam (sweet, rich, thought it was an excellent accompaniment to a single butter cookie)  and the Native Cultivar Mi Xiang one (from the word \"honey\" in the name, it's definitely sweeter, yet I'm kind of partial to the less sweet version). The Three Cultivar Red looks intriguing, but I haven't tried it yet.\n\nMaybe if I win the lottery, I'll go check out Peter's shop, or maybe I'll just stay here.", "author": "Choco L."}

Each tea was brewed using a different method to show all the different ways it could be brewed. Each time she took the care and consideration to allow us to taste several different times, re-steeping the tea at least 3 times each.  My favorite was the black tea- bold, rich and full.

I am sure the tea is wonderful, but I wouldn't know, since we never got to taste it. We tried to get the attention of a saleswoman for about 10 minutes before she acknowledged us at all. When we asked to taste two varieties of tea, she told us to smell them instead, as the tea \"tastes like it smells.\" We asked again if we could taste it, which I don't think is an outlandish request in a tasting room, and she brushed us off. Then she asked us what kind of tea we like and where we normally buy our tea, and when I answered, she walked off without even answering, never to return. I got the distinct impression that her questions were a test we had failed, and that she had decided we were too pedestrian to be worth her time. Despite feeling uncomfortable, we still wanted to taste a few teas, but she never came back, so after standing around like idiots for another few minutes, we left. It's a shame, because some of those teas were intriguing, but I don't need to be treated like I am too dumb to qualify as a customer.\n\nInstead, we walked down the block to Vital Tea, where they were happy to prepare every tea we wanted to taste, and kindly and patently explained to us how to prepare them ourselves. You should go there instead.", "author": "Julie R."}

These Chinese candies are the kind that I grew up eating (I'm Chinese) and that my grandma would always get for me as a child.  So if you're into Chinese candies, this is a great place to go if you know your Chinese candies.  \n\nThey have a large variety of different teas, arrange on shelves from darks woody teas to the more delicate jasmines.  The staff are very knowledgable about every single kind of tea and can describe the flavor, texture and origin of anything.  It's almost like a museum -- so definitely grab one of the staff and they will be more than happy to give you a \"guided tour\" of all the tea selections.\n\nThe highlight of Red Blossom is their tea demonstration.  It costs $30 for up to 4 people.  And it's worth every penny.  One of the staff sits on a little banquet chair and you sit across from her on a little tea station.  They offer a variety of 6 teas (at least I think it was 6) and you pick 3 to taste test.  The staff member was very (as they all are) well versed in everything about the teas.  For about an hour or so, she showed us how to properly brew each tea and she serves you a little cup of each as she goes along  She steeps each of the 3 teas at least 3 or 4 times which gives you a sense of how the flavor changes with each steeping.  Needless to say, everything I thought I knew about making tea was wrong.  So if you're a fan of tea, this is a great way to learn and really discover how to make that perfect pot of tea.  When I have friends visiting from out of town, I always take them to Red Blossom and sign up for a demonstration.  The gal who guided us was well spoken, elonquent and a charming person.\n\nThere are several tea stores in China Town and I think Red Blossom is one of the best -- it's SQUEAKY CLEAN and the staff are always happy to help.  They also have a variety of tea pots/mugs, etc. beautifully packaged that would make great gifts or souvenirs for your out of town guests.  It doesn't stop there -- they also have a decent selection of ginseng roots that range from $28 a pound to almost $500 a pound (these are for the serious ginseng fan) -- it sounds horribly expensive, and it is but these prices for ginseng are market price.\n\nAll of their products are market priced -- this is not your discount tea shop.  But it's not terribly expensive so if you're a tea lover, this is the place to go.", "author": "Paul N."}

Came here with my dad who is an herbalist/acupuncturist and has been a tea enthusiast for years. Let me start by saying they had 6 people working, were not crowded, and told us they were too understaffed to provide us tea tasting, yet they provided it for 4 other people who came in! Pretty rude. The place is snooty and uncomfortable. The staff is overdressed, and the tea is overpriced. We went a few doors down instead to Vital Tea Leaf and spent over $200 after the staff generously served us about 10 types of tea, including their best (and btw Red Blossom said they do not sample their top shelf tea) and taught us all about the teas and how to prepare/serve them. If you want a perfect experience walk about a block more to 905 Grant and visit Vital Tea instead- much more welcoming, high quality, and fair prices.", "author": "Jessica S."}

I will admit I have a lot to learn about other types of teas. The staff at Red Blossom Tea was very patient with me as I stared longingly at the many containers of amazing teas.  Their English is better than mine so we had no issue with communication.  I asked so many questions my throat began to get dry.  I was even allowed to open the container tops to take in the aroma of each of their offerings.  Intoxicating.\nOne of the staffers brought me a sample of a tea in a small ceramic cup. They had just brewed it.  Such a nice touch and a fine selection.  I savoured every drop.  My throat was soothed. \nI found they had a large number of regulars who came through the door who greeted the staff and seemed to have a standing order for specific teas.  It's terrific to have such a loyal following in such a touristy area.  \nI was a little overwhelmed with the sheer variety of selections and I found myself reading all the details on each tea canister.  I decided to focus on tea which would be something I could have at bed-time.  One of the staffers (sorry I forgot her name) pointed to the low caffeine tea containers and the Rooibos in particular.  They still had a very large selection and it still took me some time to select.  I settled on the Rooibos.  It's a South African tea that contains a high amount of Antioxidants and a very low level of Caffeine.  Great recommendation.  \nI got a nod of approval from the lady who rang up my purchase so I felt pretty good about what I bought.  I'll bring my friends here.  Terrific Place.", "author": "Webb P."}

My family and friends have a running bet each time I go here on whether I will spend 100, 200, 300, or 400 (and sometimes, they even put me on a budget).\n\nTo those out there who are coming here to get \"medicinal teas\"...my suggestion would be to go to the tourist trap tea stores down the street. They have teas that are not as good quality and they will tell you anything you want to hear (I know this because I went into one of these stores and it just confirmed that I will stick with Red Blossom).\n\nRed blossom is for those who truly want a quality tea. If you tell them, what you are used to drinking, they will find a tea that might suit your taste buds and they will brew it for you to taste.

The assortment and branding of the teas are OK, but what I find disappointing is the attitude of the shop owners.  As I understand, this shop is run by a couple.  The husband was OK, didn't talk much though.  The wife was quite passive aggressive and gave me a blind eye when I asked her a question.  The most friendly staff was a young girl who should be their employee who had to be nice anyways.  What's more, I was not offered any tasting although I bought two different teas from them.   \n\nRegarding the price, it is very expensive.  Most of the teas are around $20-30/two ounces (or about 50g).  Some of the prices can be as high as early $40/two ounces.  I bought the best Japanese green tea in Japan Town, which cost me only about $18/200g.  That is to say the teas here is at least 4 times more expensive. I understand tea prices vary a lot depending on the type, the origin, the quality and the season.  But I seriously doubt that the teas sold here justify such a high price.  I am happy to spend more for the tasting experience, the knowledgable and friendly staff etc, but unfortunately these were just absent in my visit.

Explaining that she and her brother took over the family business and gave their store an HGTV remodel, you can see and appreciate the personal service that has made this family business such a success.\n\nAfter enjoying a few cups, you'll feel inclined to want to purchase a few bags of loose tea for your home consumption.  And if you're concerned that loose tea from a tea company will be expensive, think again!  Sure, they have some very expensive (out of my budget) type tea, but they also offer some moderately priced ones as well as some inexpensive ones.

Luckily I found this place and was able to buy it because it can be pretty expensive at a restaurant or at one of those boba drink places.  You can even buy their tea online. The other thing that is difficult in making thai iced tea is finding a recipe online that taste like the thai restaurants do. Someone who works at Red Blossom makes it often and knows exactly how the thai restaurants make it. She told me the secret is to allowing it to brew for hours. She told me that she even let it sit overnight. \n\nThe woman at Red Blossom likes her tea a little stronger than I like mine. After experimenting a few times I found out that the only way to get it to taste like the restaurant is to let it steep for several HOURS or allow it to simmer for several hours.\n\nHere is what I do:\n\n1. 1 or 2 tbsp per cup of water\n\n2. Get water to a boil, turn stove off, add tea leaves, let steep for a couple of hours or so, bring back to boil, allow steeping again.\n\n3. Strain in pitcher\n\n3. I use splenda instead of sugar and that does not compromise the taste for me at all\n\n4. Pour half and half, evaporated milk, or condensed milk to taste. (I think condensed milk is the traditional way, but I use what I have on hand plus it has a stronger taste than half and half which is what I use)\n\n\nRed Blossom has many different kinds of tea and the people there are so helpful.

They went away and made a bag of it and then came back, always a very bad sign. Sure enough, when I was back in the office I opened the bag and found a tea no more than 2 years old. You can tell right away because of the earthy smell, completely different than in the store. It's like the difference between smelling a wet and a dry blanket. There's no way to verify the tea without opening the sealed bag. They obviously hide when they pour and seal it so they can trick you. I took it back and they said over and over \"absolutely no return for any reason\". What a scam! Then I took the tea to two other shops and asked them if they could match it, just to make sure I wasn't losing my sense of smell. Both places offered me their youngest Puer. After I told the story to the third place they said Red Blossom has a bad rep and actually offered to exchange it for the real thing. Now I go there instead.

I think he told us his name, but I'm bad with names. Anyway, we were a pair of obviously non-rich, goofy, overly enthusiastic young ladies but he treated us to tastings of two different teas and we were there past closing, smelling the wares and eventually buying more than we could afford. It was such fun.\r\n\r\nI know the owners are yelpers themselves (at least the woman is) and are probably reading this - thanks for your time and consideration, you really made our day. \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you're going to go here, don't expect to be served tea (they do tastings, but this isn't a Starbucks) and expect to have your picture taken by random midwesterners.

Granted, there are loads of tourists and people who have no business sticking their noses in the tins and manhandling the teas in the back but I grew up with tea and I feel like it's a  place of peace when I walk into any medicinal/herbal shop. \nI wanted to thank Matt for dinner and since my wine knowledge is like that of a pretentious Wrigleyville yuppie (meaning I know my wine, but I can talk and buy a better game than I do appreciating it) I opted for leaves instead. And yes they have rolled leaves that blossom as they seep in hot water and they have the popular blossoming tea pot sensations but what makes me want to come back time and time again is the owner of the shop? I think he's the owner. I gave him a sample of what I was used to drinking but the shop I frequented was from D.C. and there's no way I'm going to find the Jasmine tea I use in my J.W. Gold Label from Safeway. He breathed it in and found me a suitable pairing and explained the subtle notes and intensity. Awesome awesome intensity from this guy! He'll look at the wall for a moment, grab the tin and move it away from himself as you take a breath in. I got dragon ball pearls and jasmine leaves for myself and Matt. I'm so impressed with the knowledge and the time he took to explain about the process even though the store was extremely busy and I'm sure he could have made a killing with every tourist that walked in. \nI still have a few pearls left and the aroma just fills the kitchen. I can't wait to go back and try some new ones. They give you a handy little bookmark to help you differentiate teas and seeping times. The place definitely isn't like the normal Chinatown tea shops you're used to seeing and it's almost chic I'd say but don't let the new decor throw you off-it's old school at heart.

Before that day,  I kept on complaining to my friends about the crappy tea you'll find in either Chinese grocery stores or Peet's. I feel offended to see those places selling two-years old huge leaves of Dragonwell and wanted to have my own shop to introduce really nice tea.\n\nApparently they did what I wanted to do. When the extremly friendly staff emphasized that they have an exclusive selection of Dragonwell newly picked during march to April from different farms located at different attitude of the area, I know they know something about tea. I tried several samples and very pleased to take some really nice Dragonwell-----best green tea and the best tea for me.\n\nI also love their taste about the tea pot and cups and tray.

My experience was the complete opposite.  I found Peter to be very knowledgeable about teas and friendly too.  He gave my wife and I great customer service.  He let us taste several teas and occupy a table for a very long time even though the store was very busy.  He admits he doesn't sell teas for their supposed medicinal qualities.  They have an apothecary in the back of the store for that.  And even there, they'll only fill out presciptions.\n\nAnyway, I think you'd not be doing yourself a favor if you like tea and decide to bypass Red Blossom.

(I've only been inside the store twice -- parking in Chinatown is just a pain.)\n\nAlice at Red Blossom is constantly introducing me to new teas or taking me on tour of some fresh and intriguing tea that has recently come in. She always sends a sample of something interesting together with my orders (not uncommon for tea shops), and she even seems to know what I like. \n\nMy current favorite is their Pi lo Chun Early Harvest. Simply delightful. A lovely looking tea with a great nose and wonderful flavor. I find that it only holds up to a couple of brewings but no matter; it's worth every penny.\n\nTheir Silver Needle is always very fresh, and I tried a Pouchong from them today that had a great flowery nose (smells like fresia to me but I'm not an expert on flowers). I've tasted a kuding from RBT that I'm sure was quite good (and definitely fresh), but a bit too tannic for me. It was quite intense with a sort of fruity taste.\n\nTheir Dragonwells are always excellent; including the low-end ones. Speaking of which, I typically stay in the $40-60/lb range with their teas and I'm quite happy. (Though I've succumbed to a couple that are a good bit more expensive.) \n\nRBT offers a great selection of very fresh tea with excellent value throughout their range. Alice will always steer you in the right direction and she clearly takes her tea quite seriously.\n\nNow, I am just getting to know the depth of puerhs and I am drinking their Emperor Puerh in the morning. It's better than the puerh I buy by the pound in New York's Chinatown (about $40/lb, so a bit less), but I don't know -- I'm just not floored by it. Then again, I don't know how well I know puerhs and I can only imagine what those $300 cakes taste like. (Though I did get a very nice bit of puerh from Ying Kee Tea in Hong Kong with a very deep and complex flavor.)\n\nI've sampled a couple of RBT's oolongs and they were very good, but I'm not drinking oolong much these days. I haven't tried any of their black teas, though I'm drinking a tasty Keemun from another tea shop as I write this.\n\nOh man. There are still so many more teas to try. Well, I'll start tomorrow.", "author": "WILLIAM P."}

It's the Blue Bottle of tea stores, specializing in interesting and amazing tea.

They know their ish, and have turned me onto some great teas without making me feel like I am being upsold. My only complaint - i always come here on my lunch break, so have to decline their offer to do tea tastings.\nI also had to make a rule for myself - I'll only go there when I'm almost out of tea.

It is a very close rival to coffee and each morning I have a mental debate on which will be my morning partner. Tea wins about half the time. If coffee wins, then tea gets me afterwards as I usually brew a cup at work around 11. Unlike coffee tea is my friend during more times than just when i need a caffeine buzz. When I am sick, it's helps me get better, when I am coldie on a rainy day it helps me feel cozy, when I am trying to chill out after a long day it helps me go to relax when I am hot on a summer day it brings some ice and is the perfect treat. Tea is so versatile and interesting it just really goes with everything. All of these things I already knew about tea, but today I learned I know very very little about tea and was not experiencing nearly as well as I could have been. This tea shop is a beautiful family run business that has incredible staff. We sat down for a tea tasting and in just 10 minutes were blown away with the information we picked up. Plus the teas were really excellent. My mom and I both left wanting to learn more. We bought a new cup so we could steep our tea more accurately and individually. Also a sample pack because we wanted to try so many. I am looking forward to getting to know my friend tea on a much deeper level over the next few weeks and hopefully go back to Red Blossom tea company for another session soon to continue my tea education.
