Food came out quickly and the guy managing orders was very friendly.\n\nNow for the food:\n- Garlic noodles: nicely flavored, chewy, generous portion (4/5)\n- Five spice pork: not very flavorful, could barely taste the five spice (2/5)\n- veggie stirfry: broccoli/cauliflower nicely flavored, tofu was bland (3/5)\n- Vietnamese crispy roll: TBH kind of bleh. it wasn't crispy at all, sauce could have used more punch.\n\nGiven the price ($14 for the combo + tax) I'm not sure I'd be back again.", "author": "Jenn C."}

I opted for the beef, paid a little over $9 and waited about 5 minutes to pick up my order. I open up my box only to find a small skewer with a little bit of beef and an average portion of garlic noodles. Don't get me wrong, the garlic noodles were decent, but the portion of beef was SMALL and chewy.\n\nMy coworker ordered the fried crab dumplings to share with everyone... crunchy on the outside, mushy and bland on the inside.

Well I've been hearing about An the Go for a while now and decided, sure why not and I just had a burrito yesterday so even though the lines at Tacos de los Altos was significantly longer, I stuck to my guns. The verdict? I should've had anything else but this, but hey now I know better. The noodles were over cooked, but had a nice little garlic tingle to them. The Five Spice Pork not dry, flavorful, but not remarkable. \n\nL O C A T I O N\nAn the Go is a food truck so you'll have to check out their schedule. I was able to catch them in San Ramon Bishop Ranch.\n\nP A R K I N G\nAgain depending on where you catch the truck. At Bishop Ranch there's plenty of parking as it's a business park. I didn't have to drive anywhere so convenient for me.\n\nM E N U\nThey basically serve garlic noodles with skewers. They have two different combos:\n\n~ Garlic noodles combo - $ 14 + tax ~\nChoose two meats/veggie\n- Lemongrass chicken\n- Yuzu shrimp\n- Vegetable stirfry\n- Five spice pork\n- Lemongrass beef\nChoose one side\n- Vietnamese crispy roll with dipping sauce\n- Dungeonous crab puff with mustard sauce\n\n~ Original combo - $9 + tax ~\nChoose one meat/veggie (same as above)\n\nThen they have sides same as the above but the crispy roll is $6 for 2 rolls, puffs are $6 as well. They do have a few drinks, Fiji water, diet coke...and another drink which I didn't capture.\n\nI ordered the original with five-spice pork as this was their best seller in terms of meat. The meat itself wasn't too shabby. Nice grilled taste, pork was not dry. The bed of garlic noodles on the other hand were the disappointment. They were overcooked and mushy. The garlic taste was prominent and it was oily but that was to be expected. If you don't want to have dragon breath for the rest of the day, you shouldn't have this otherwise, hey...embrace the garlic! I kind of wish they could do a side of veggies or something that can lighten up the dish. Even some cilantro would've probably helped the meal Heck even put the noodles on a romaine lettuce. There's just missing a crunchy textural element.\n\nS E R V I C E\nSince it's grilled fresh, it does take time. The lines are fairly long during noon so get there early. It took about half an hour to get through the line and get the food. The person at the window was at least cheery even though it was blistery hot. So that's a plus.\n\nO V E R A L L\nUnless you really love noodles or just want to try it out, then sure try An the Go. Otherwise, the only thing really going for it is the punny name.

I ordered garlic noodles with pork on top, and the amount of pork I was given was laughable. I'd say I was able to finish all the meat that came in my dish in maybe four bites. Additionally, the garlic noodles themselves, while plentiful, were not the tastiest dish I've ever experienced. The noodles themselves were standard affair and comparable to spaghetti, and the garlic sauce was on the dry side, and not as flavorful as I would have expected. I was also surprised that it wasn't that filling, even though the portion of noodles looked substantial.\n\nIn conclusion, I am not sure An The Go has hit the mark with their garlic noodles, the toppings that come with them, or the price they charge.

I mean you don't have a fixed monthly rent to pay, and you open only at peak hours so your staffing costs are also minimized.  An The Go isn't the exception, but the rule.  Back in the day, food trucks were called roach mobiles, but that was when they were unsanitary and roach infested.  Yelp shows that An The Go got a health score of 94/100 so I guess roaches are pretty scared of this place.\n\nWell I needed a quick bite and my friend suggested we try some food trucks that park at a local hotel next to where we work.  Having an urge to eat some Chinese food An The Go looked like a good fit.  I order the 14+tax combo which included a half box of garlic noodles, a short stick of lemon grass beef, and a short stick of 5 flavored pork.  The total was $15.25 and I tipped 10% which made my meal $16.77.  The lemom grass beef and 5 flavored pork were both pretty good.  But it was like 4 pcs each on a 5 inch skewer.  Common An The Go, I get more meat then that on a hamburger at Micky Ds. \n\nThen came the noodles....they were definitely over cooked and drenched with oil.  It might be the garlic sauce that they use, but the noodles ended up having a soggy texture and almost soaked through the bottom of the box when I finished.  Also for $16, you'd think they would use a full size square box vs a half size take out box.  I usually see this size box for hot dogs or for left overs.\n\nAt least they keep the truck clean and I didn't get the runs afterwards so that got them 2 stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-11", "description": "5/11/15: First time this truck showed up at work.  I probably don't have much to add beyond what the ~300 other reviewers said before me, you know, way too expensive, sides (and meat) are tiny, noodles are good.  But well, here it is from me:\n\n1. \"$14 Garlic Noodle Combo\" $14: So, here the price is part of the item name, if that foretells anything.  There is a $9 combo.  So, you either go with rich people price or if you aren't feeling like shelling that kind of money for a plate of noodles, you got an option of nearly 1/2 off the price for maybe 1/5th less food..... k...so how is it 40% less for just a bit less food?  Cause the skewers were small and the side of Dungeness Crab Puffs was absolutely miniscule.  So if you get one less skewer and no side, it's not really that much less food, and not a huge loss.\n\n1a. Garlic Noodles: Yeah, they're good.  But if you put a little bit of effort into it, I'm sure you can make the same thing at home without much trouble.  Heck, I have myself.  Just get fresh noodles from Ranch 99 of your choice, and cook with butter and lots of minced garlic.  That's just about it.  Looks like they added some parmesan or something for texture--you can do the same if you want.  When I went to Crustacean in Beverly Hills many years ago, I feel like it might have been better then (I guess this truck is owned by the same people?)  The noodles this time were a tad overcooked, and could use a little more firmness.  They also opened AnQi in Costa Mesa many years ago just specializing in those noodles.  I've been to South Coast Plaza where it's located many times, but never had the desire to pay $20 or whatever crazy price they were asking for a plate of simple noodles.  6/10.\n\n1b. Five-Spice Pork [skewer]: You get about 3 or so decent bite-sized pieces.  Has a good amount of flavor, but it tastes a bit off to me.  The meat is a bit dry and overcooked, but not too badly.  Nothing special here.  5/10.\n\n1c. Lemongrass Beef [skewer]: Meat was good quality (skirt steak maybe?) and cooked mediumish, which I was pleased to find.  Spices tasted good too.  Good stuff.  Also about 3 pieces.  Pretty good.  7/10.\n\n1d. Dungeness Crab Puffs: Utter sht.  Come on.  Almost false advertising.  \"Puffs\"?  I was expecting like pastries stuffed with crab.  Nope.  These are standard small wontons stuffed with some crab meat.  They were even over-fried!--very close to simply burnt!!!  I could not believe that.  The stuffing was on the dry side.  Yes, it's crab, but it's not good crab.  Not juicy.  No flavor.  2 pieces.  Yeah, this is bad stuff.  I got this as part of the combo, but PLEASE do not pay $6 for it standalone!!!  2/10.\n\nIf you really want to try their good stuff, go to Crustacean--I really do like their crab.  Might have been some of the best I've ever had (again, Beverly Hills location--not sure how that compares to up here.)  If you do go, my tip is just get the crab--everything else sucked as I remember, including even lobster!  And like I said, I walked by AnQi many times and said hell no.\n\nAnyway, ignoring the crab \"puffs\" everything else was decent tasting, but at ripoff-level prices.\n\nStill keeping it at 3/5 (instead of 2/5) stars despite the pricing cause it tasted good enough (again, ignoring those crab things), and the steak probably wasn't cheap, and given they give a lot of noodles I am rather full, so I'd probably eat this again if I didn't have another lunch choice, and yeah this is a mega run-on sentence.\n\n#truck #noodles", "author": "Dean C."}

It's already an uphill battle when I have to pay $9 for a little skewer over a bed of noodles. \n\nMy yakitori-esque beef skewer exemplified the limitations of food truck cooking. There's a good reason why skewers are normally grilled over an open flame rather than cooked on a griddle in a food truck. A griddle is fine for pancakes and eggs, but with the unevenness of skewers, a lot of the meat can't directly touch the metal top, and you end up getting chunks of gray meat instead of a nice dark sear all around. Without the even charring and caramelization you'd get from a real grill, the skewer was missing a lot of flavor. \n\nThe noodles were pretty bland too. They weren't very buttery or garlicky. I mostly just tasted the doughy flavor of the noodles. The weird part is that even though they weren't very flavorful, the noodles were still greasy and left me with garlic breath for the rest of the day. How does that work?", "author": "Nei N."}

I don't know about it that pricing.\n\nI would suggest picking up the noodles here and get your protein from another truck if you happen to be at a truck event.  The noodles went well with the Mandarin Chicken Taco from Streez Eatz.\n\nWell I guess if I have a super craving for their Garlic Noodles then I would go back.

Years later, I finally saw that they were at the Alameda one this past Sat so we rushed over and got there 30 min before they closed. \n\nFood:  I didn't see the option for garlic noodles only so had to get the $9 \"meal\" and since I was buying for the fam, ended up with a $27 dent in my wallet for 1 chicken w/lemongrass, 1 beef w/lemongrass, and 1 five spice pork.  The beef that I had was very tasty and would definitely get it again.  The other two skewers also seemed to go over well with the recipients of those meals taste wise.  The garlic noodles was loaded with garlic flavor that I was still tasting it in my mouth hours later.  Unfortunately maybe because it's being kept warm vs. made to order due to time constraints, the noodles can be mushy so not quite the same texture as the ones directly from the restaurant. \n\nCost:  As many others complained, the skewers are quite small and although I would not want them to decrease the amount of noodles just to match the skewer portion, $9 is a bit high for noodles and a tiny bit of meat.

It's been years since I've gone back to Thanh Long, but I've always remembered thinking that their garlic noodles were pretty tasty.  Now that they have a truck, talk about a convenient way to get some of their noodles An The Go (har har har).\n\nBeing that there was a few of us there, we decided that instead of getting our own orders, we would just share instead.  To give ourselves a bit of variety without going overboard, we decided to get only one order of their garlic noodles (of course) along with two of their skewers - the Lemongrass Chicken and the BBQ Pork.  After all, we had to save space for the other trucks!\n\nWhen our to-go box came out, we popped it open to find a sizable mound of noodles along with our two skewers.  Although the noodles looked somewhat similar to what I had before, the taste wasn't that familiar.  Granted, it's been a while since I've had the stuff, but it didn't seem to be as garlic-y and buttery as I remember or would have liked.  It was still pretty decent though, but it could have packed a little more punch and it just didn't seem as good as what you get at Thanh Long.  As for the skewers, they were perfectly fine, but not unique either.  The meat was cooked well on both, and the lemongrass chicken flavor was solid.\n\nFrom what I could see from the orders ahead of us, adding a skewer or two will get you a little more noodles in your box, but you might want to do it anyways for some meat.  It'll be filling either way though.  I'd say the truck is worth trying if the line isn't too crazy, since the taste will vary slightly by the day and batch.

You've got to be ****ing kidding me.\n\nThe garlic noodles feel OK going down, but are soooo heavy on the garlic that it'll leave you absolutely dehydrated no matter how much water you gulp down, not to mention an aftertaste (and totally funky breath) that'll linger for hours.

No, not soup, but still the best effin' thing I've eaten in my 47 years of living on this planet. \n\nI usually attribute such superlatives to being so hungry and starved. But no, I just had tacos, so it had to be the garlicky noodles. I just don't get people who considered these noodles to be disappointing.

Well, An the Go's garlic noodles is much like this instant packet of pancit canton (Filipino version of the chow mein). An the Go's is pretty basic.

Plus, there's a whole lot of noodle compared to the little meat you get from a single skewer. I was out of lemongrass chicken by the time I got halfway through my noodles.

Garlic Noodles! and all for less than $2.00 when made at home.\n\nAdditionally,  I ordered a crispy spring roll, and what I got was an anemic and tasteless/half fried small \"crispy egg roll\" $2.50 \n\nVietnamese coffee.  The coffee was good and strong made with condensed milk so it was sweet $3.", "author": "amy m."}

The wrapping on the spring rolls were chewy; I was looking forward to that satisfying crunch, but no.

While my friends look like they barely got filled on the chicken truck (piddly portions), An the Go provided heaping amount of garlic noodles in their $9 set.

For an extra $2.50, you can get another skewer.  \n\nMy set was the lemongrass beef and noodles.  The beef was not too flavorful and looked pretty lonely in the sea of wavy noodles.  Luckily I had opted to add a shrimp skewer so it was less lonely.  The shrimp skewer is VERY flavorful--I wished I had taken two of that instead of the beef.\n\nMy coworkers--being vegetarian--got the noodles with veggies. Now that's a pretty good deal.  There were ample veggies in their set, although I still prefer having some animal protein.\n\nOverall the garlic noodles taste as-if you were at Crustacean (I guess they are affiliated since it's on their food truck).

I don't expect Asian wheat noodles to be as \"al dente\" as Italian-style hard wheat/semolina pastas or egg noodles (though they should still have a bit of resistance), and one of my favorite preparations for noodles at home is close to what An the Go does: plain, dry, and dressed with lots of oil and minced garlic. It's not fancy, but when done right it's pretty satisfying.\n\nHowever, the fact that I do noodles like this at home is also why my rating is not going any higher than three stars: for $7.50 An the Go gives you roughly a third of a pound of cooked noodles dressed with plain oil and minced garlic, and nothing else. It's good, but as an avid noodle eater (hush!)

I still cannot forget that!\n\nAnyway.. they accept Visa/MC and that's always a plus.

I was thrilled when I learned that they do accept it.\n\nI ordered the garlic noodles w/ beef skewers.  Though I'm 100% Vietnamese, sometimes I swear I'm a white male as I really technically need just meat (and more meat) and potatoes.. I love chicken too (boiled, grilled, steamed, fried, broiled, baked, ground, rotisserie, etc.) but the choice that stood out to me was the beef skewers.  \n\nThe garlic noodles was yummy after 4 days in the fridge.. this isn't chow mein type of noodles so it did not get all starchy so that was a plus!  The beef was a little too well done for my taste but now I know better.. \"Extra rare por favor.\"  \n\nWould I come back to Thanh Long?  YES!!\n\nWould I come back to An The Go?

The deliciousness of garlic and goodness of noodles is what I'm talking about.  Vegetables will only take up precious space in my take-out container.  Obviously, the garlic noodles from An The Go will not taste exactly the same as the ones from Thanh Long - remember, it's a completely different kitchen.  \n\nPeople complain about the price but next time you feel like standing in the Chairman Bao line, head over to Chinatown first to see how much a pork bun really costs.  Let's admit it, we're all into this whole food truck craze because we're buying into the gimmick that gourmet food trucks serve some sort of amazing food that cannot be found elsewhere.  It's this elusive quality that draws us in.  That and it's like a party when you hit up OTG.  The trucks know that and that's how they get away with charging wayyyyyy more.  At least An The Go doesn't charge MORE than Thanh Long.  I can't say the same for some of those other trucks.", "author": "Peggy N."}

While visiting Off the Grid Civic Center and seeing that Chairman Bao's had a monstrous line going, I decided to line up for the truck that seemed to be the fastest/had the shortest line so that's how I ended up at An the Go that day. I had heard that they were owned by Crustacean, but based on Yelp reviews and looking at people's garlic noodles at Off the Grid I wasn't super pumped for my garlic noodles. First of all, just noodles cost $7.50 - and that is literally what you will get, just garlic and noodles, no vegetables, not even a green onion. \n\nIf you order noodles only you get it in a pretty sturdy looking piece of plastic ware, but it's fairly small. If you add a skewer or vegetables to your noodle you get your food all in a paper box that is an upgrade in size from the plastic container. If you find that you like the food here, I'd say add skewer to your noodles for the meat, and extra noodles. \n\nNow for the food, the noodles were just boring. They looked sort of like spaghetti and chow mein noodles at the same time, mixed with a ton a garlic and were quite greasy. The noodles are filling, but I got sick of them really fast. The main problem with the noodles is that they lack firm texture, they almost reminded me of noodles that had been sitting in water for too long and had absorbed too much liquid. The noodles are very plump and mushy so they fill you up fast, but after awhile it ends up tasting like garlic mush, and the garlic is fairly intense. To add some variety to the texture I think they need to either add some onions, or fried garlic slices for a crunch, it was just too mushy! I also got a lemongrass beef skewer which was actually really good. The meat was juicy and tender and wasn't too salty, for $2.50 it was pretty decent. They also sell drinks here but I didn't bother since I was already shelling out $10 for bland noodles and one skewer. I couldn't finish my box of noodles for lunch so I stuck it in the fridge and came back to it after a few hours. I will admit that this improved the noodles. By chilling the noodles it became slightly firmer and the garlic flavor a little sharper, but I still wasn't in love with it.\n\nI got my food fairly fast, so that was a plus considering how crowded Off the Grid lunch events can get and I was running short on time for my lunch break. I don't think I'd go to An the Go again, for $7.50 I expect some pretty spectacular noodles (especially if it's noodles ONLY). I might be tempted to order just a skewer in the future, but I'd stay clear of those noodles.", "author": "Monica W."}

Even a little green onion, seaweed flakes, sesame seeds, etc. would have made it a big difference!", "author": "Wolfy W."}

I got the garlic noodles for $7.50 and the beef skewer for an additional $2.50. Considering I just spent $10 bucks at a food truck, I expected my meal to be a little more satisfying-- but it wasn't. I got a disproportionately big serving of noodles coupled with a very lame looking skewer of beef. $7.50 should be able to cover an entire meal at a food truck and not just a portion of it. I'll be sticking to restaurant version of Thanh Long in the future where at least I feel like I'm paying for overpriced garlic noodles because the restaurant has costs and upkeep.", "author": "Angelo T."}

I'm a fan of the garlic noodles at Crustacean!  I ordered the Garlic Noodles $7.50 and a Yuzu Shrimp Skewer for $2.50.  The noodles were good, but didn't taste as flavorful as the ones at the restaurant.  The shrimp were flavorful, tender and just slightly crispy on the outside... perfect!... but there were only three.  Overall I enjoyed my meal but I was underwhelmed with the value.  For $10.00 I could have found a bit better food with table service at a sit down.  The portion of the noodles were generous, almost too much not to share.

But as I was driving on Bollinger, I saw my cupcake truck driving away in the opposite direction =/ boooo. I proceeded to Bishop Ranch, in hopes they'd return, but the didn't. Since I made the trek all the way I decided to pick up lunch from An The Go. I wasn't hungry (for anything but cupcakes) but I had always wanted to try An's famous noodles. I've actually made these noodles a few times, for my family. I got a knock-off recipe off the internet. I've eaten at Crustaceans before, a long, long time ago and it was fabulous. So I was excited to try their famous noodles. When I got my lunch special order ($9 for noodles and a lemon grass beef skewer), the box was very hefty feeling. It came with a minimal portion of beef and a lot of noodles. The lemon grass beef was very tasty. The noodles were a notch above my own. The leftover noodles was enough to eat for dinner. I was sufficiently satisfied with the taste and quality of my food. $9 is reasonable, compared to the prices they charge at their restaurant. Now I know how to tweak my own garlic noodles.", "author": "Tracy S."}

The shiny red food truck itself proudly informs you of their affiliation and emphasizes to you their go-to thing is definitely the garlic noodle. Additionally, a whiff of the garlic aroma (or \"stench\" if you a vampire) can be smelled from a few trucks down. \n\nThe menu is quite simple - garlic noodles for $7.50, and the choice of either (a) lemongrass beef skewer, (b) lemongrass chicken skewer, (c) 5-spice pork skewer, (d) stir-fry tofu and veggies, or some other choices for an additional $2.50. Today there was also a choice of Coconut Prawns or Mix Green Salad with Miso as side dishes. By no means is the menu extensive, I mean... it is a food truck. I stuck with garlic noodles + lemongrass beef. \n\nOne cool thing I just noticed is that these food trucks take credit card! So for you cash-strapped folks good news, Visa or Mastercard can spot you for your lunch. Now on to the food... I was shocked at the portions... and not in a good way. I opened by box and what stared back at me was such small portions. It looked as if someone had eaten half my lunch and doggy-bagged the rest for me. \"Mr. An, I did not order a half-order of the food. Did someone in the truck get hungry and ate the other half of my portion?\"  I had thought for $2.50 there would at least be 2 skewers of lemongrass beef.\n\nLemongrass beef was cold and really not all that flavorful. To me, it could have been beef jerky for all I knew. The garlic noodle was crisp on the edges and tasted of buttery and garlicy goodness. But for a cheaper price, I can sit at a restaurant and get comparable garlic noodle from Red Crawfish or Mangosteen. I did not really see the hoo-ha of the garlic noodles. They were good... but not \"ZOMG! It's garlic noodles from the owners of Crustacean / Thanh Long!\"-good. Might considering making a return if they (1) lower the price or (2) increase the damn portions.", "author": "Kevin L."}

I do feel that the garlic noodles at the restaurant are better than at the truck.  Having said that though, the truck offers the convenience of bringing the noodles to you even though they are not as good as the restaurant's.  For $9 you get a ton of noodles and also a topping such as vegetables, or pork, or shrimp or chicken.  I recommend sharing this dish or splitting it into two meals to eat on different days or else you will suffer from carb and calorie overload!  I will definitely eat here again when the garlic noodle craving hits!  I wish they had half size portions for half the price, but then the economics of that pricepoint may not work out for them as a business, and having to deal with different sizes could affect their order fulfillment times.", "author": "Bebe W."}
