I was in SF   solo for a work trip and it happened to be my birthday. A couple of amazing coworkers were also in town so we decided to get saucy. We ended up at Black Horse and we had an absolute blast. Check out Jonathan T's review for a full account of what went down. \n\nThis magical night was filled with bathtub beers, new friends, bar dancing, ice throwing, dice rolling, and even hula hooping! I got to shotgun a beer, wear a happy birthday sign the bartender cut down from the ceiling, and don her dope ass LA Gear pink denim jacket while I showed off my moves atop the bar. The memories I have are all amazing and I can't wait to come back on my next visit.", "author": "Scotty C."}

Why? \n\n- I won a dice game of 1, 4, 24. (Buy-ins cost one dollar). And after I announced my victory, the bartender dropped all ten, hepatitis covered dollar bills on my face. When she ran out of money, she tossed a stack of coasters onto me. #blessed\n\n- If the bartender likes a patron, he or she may ask that person to dance on top of the bar. I had the opportunity to do so and got down to Michael Jackson (so stretch your calves and ankles before venturing out to The Black Horse). Also, if you stand on the bar you then the awesome opportunity to have ice thrown at you. *Pro tip: Hold onto one of the walls, so you don't fall. \n\n- It ain't up to code, but all of the beer sits in a bathtub full of ice behind the bar, and their selection varies every night. Bring cash because they don't take credit card. *Note: The convenient store on the corner has an ATM. \n\n- I saw my boy Scottie grind with the bartender. He asked for her pink jean jacket, so she sexily took it off, rubbed it in between her cooch, and handed it to him between her legs. He then put it on and looked mighty fly. They then danced together, and he looked so happy because the sista was stacked. She's pregnant now. \n\n- The bathroom has one magazine (ESPN), and it's from 2005. The cover page features ex-NFL running back Cedric Benson and words that read, \"I'M NOT RICKY.\" I don't think anyone has touched it since that year, too. \n\n- A random happy birthday sign ran across the room, and the bartender cut down just for Scotty.\n\n- Slam a beer for only six bucks. \n\n- For about ten minutes, everyone left the bar to practice hula hooping out on the sidewalk.\n\n- There was a dude hugging a Taylor Swift cardboard cutout and taking selfies with it. lol. \n\nSure, I may have contracted some sort of venereal disease or skin infection that night, but I would relive it all over again. The Black Horse welcomed me to its cozy, bacteria infested little home, and I can't wait to return see my weird family. And I wouldn't want it any other way.  \n\nWear shoes you don't love there.

And I'm not just saying that because, thanks to 1-4-24,* I've almost always walked out of this bar with more money than I walked in with. \n\nIt's really more like hanging out at a friend's place than a bar. It's tiny, just like all my friend's apartments. \n\nJames is less like a bartender and more like my buddy who's just standing closer to the bathtub of beers, so he hands me one when I'm in need. I do have to pay him (and tip him) for those beers, but just like most of my friends, he's tossing them back too. Occasionally he'll just shotgun one because sipping is too slow. \n\nAnd just like most of my friends' places, we all want to leave when Ruggy shows up. \n\nBeer and cash only.\n____________\n\n*This is literally the only game I have ever been lucky at.

The Black Horse London Pub is another oddity I check off my list of strange-yet-cool places I've visited in San Francisco. \n\nThe size is what makes it unique and is also their selling point. The tiny bar can seat maybe eight people max. When sitting, your back is practically up against the wall. Your knees bump the bar. The stools are uncomfortable. The beer is literally a few canned selections served out of a bathtub. \n\nIf all this sounds horrible, it's not. It's what makes this place fun. You can actually get to know your neighbors without shoving your way through crowds or getting mean mugged. It's small enough that the bartender will stop and talk to you. And on a good night, like the Tuesday I visited, they might even have a couple drunk dudes crammed in the back corner playing guitar.", "author": "Alex L."}

Listened to two patrons play guitar in the back of the bar\n5. Exited the bar\n\nMy advice, is to experience this place ASAP.

And while the Chargers didn't deliver, as they were wont to do this season, the Black Horse did.\n\nRealize that the place is tiny.  The Village Pub in Carlsbad can accommodate 18 people comfortably, and maybe 30 in a United Airlines level of comfort.  Black Horse accommodates half that.  But it's the friendly half.\n\nBartender (owner?) James had 8 types of bottled beer available, all chilling in an old-house porcelain bathtub.  I went for a Kloster Andechs, a German abbey lager I'd never hear of before, and kept coming back for more.  The other 8 seats were periodically filled with locals and tourists, and my adorable Pit/Lab pup, The Wee Baby Ava, pulled up a spot in the doorway and greeted everyone who came in.\n\nBut we're not just talking dog-friendly here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-20", "description": "This is the best bar in San Francisco. Hell it might be my favorite bar in the country. The Black Horse London Pub (or B-Ho as my friends and I call it) located in the Marina district. I first came here with my buddies (and regulars at the bar) Stefan and Stephen. I was visiting the Bay Area for WWDC and Stefan told me I had to come to this place before I left. Best advice ever. Now that I live in the city I stop there whenever I get the chance.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've been to the Black Horse more times than i can count. A lot of times I'm there once a week but on a good week it's twice.\n\nFOOD: They don't serve any. If you're hungry then stop somewhere else beforehand but make sure to come back for some drinks, you won't regret it.\n\nDRINK: The Black Horse only serves beer so if you aren't a beer fan this place might not be your favorite. But the atmosphere is amazing so read on before you decide not to go just because there's only beer. You can order a PBR for $4 (and shotgun with the bartender if you so dare) and most other beers are around ~$6. The beers are served out of a tub and the selection changes pretty regularly. The selection always seems to have a good variety of beer styles.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This is the smallest bar in SF. Honestly would believe that it's the smallest bar in the country. You are either sitting at the bar of squeezed one to two rows of people behind the bar stools. This place does not fit a lot of people. They will make you sit up for women (as they should) to sit. There's one TV but what I love about this place is the social aspect. James the owner is always there drinking with the regulars. Either he or a patron may pull out a guitar and sing later on into the night. I always meet and talk to new people here. If you aren't outgoing you might not enjoy the Black Horse because you don't really get personal space in there. There is a ton of cool memorabilia on the wall that lends to the atmosphere. Watch out, this place is so small you could walk or drive right by it without realizing. The bar does close at midnight though so make sure to watch the clock and get your drinks in. Don't worry though, there are bars around the corner to move on to.\n\nSTAFF: The staff is amazing. They are a lot of fun to drink with and won't hesitate to call you on your shit. Like I said, I've shotgunned with them, chugged with them, sang with them, and always have a great time with them. You're missing out by not meeting these people.\n\nPAYMENT: The Black Horse is cash only but there is an ATM at the corner store right next to the bar.\n\nI started with it and I'll end with it. This is the best bar in SF. The atmosphere it great, the staff is great, and the patrons are great. I've never had a bad time here and I doubt I ever will. I tell everyone they should stop by this bar at least once and give it a try. I know I'll be there again relatively soon. Most likely tonight.", "author": "Christopher D."}

The interior is as madcap a collection of conversation pieces as one could hope for, and last (but by no means least) James is just plain cool as shit.

The only reason I don't give the Black Horse 5 stars is because it is not for everyone - as evidenced by the occasional bad rating (though I can't figure out how someone who has never been inside has the nerve to rate a place).  Small, cozy, tiny, or any other similar adjective will barely fit in the door.  When we lived in the area, this was a regular stop for us.  Now that we live out in \"San Ramote\", we only get here about once a month.  It is well worth the stop when we are in the City.\n\nJames (the owner) is great and the place is friendly.  The beer selection is as small as the pub, but high quality.  There is usually a Chimay or two on the list, another beer from Germany, Austria, or other beer making country.  Sometimes he has another selection such as a hard cider on the list.  There is also a cask ale on tap, something you should at least try (not carbonated, solid taste).  And he has the proper glassware for each type of beer.  Chimay should not be consumed out of your standard wedge shaped pint glass that most places use.\n\nThe cheese plates are top notch.  Yes, they are served on paper plates - but you don't eat the plate.  For your money you will get two high quality cheeses (love the English Cheddar), a tasty meat (usually salami), some great bread, a healthy serving of chutney, some onions, and a sliced apple.  Order the large plate and share, you may meet a new acquaintance.\n\nIf you want wine, go to Amalie or The Wine Bar on Polk.  If you want hard liquor, go back up Union street to any number of places.  If you are looking for a place to be seen by the in crowd, go to Vessal. But if you want a friendly place where you can hang and have a conversation while sipping some quality beer, this is your place.  Stop here on the way to the other places, you may never make it to where you were originally going.\n\nSo Dee C., next time you walk by why don't you pop in.  You might actually meet some real people and have fun talking to them.  And given that you are female, you will always get a seat.

Besides, if you're going to stand that close to one another and drink, it's probably hard not to be like family. Plus you get built-in entertainment with a house dice game called 24. Pretty much everyone pitches in a dollar to the pot to play and it actually gets pretty intense (in a nice way). I'm definitely bringing this game back to Cleveland. \n\nOh, and I saved the best part for last. I was sitting at this tiny bar, enjoying the close-knit feeling, sipping on a delish cider and wondering why I felt so at home. Welp, turns out the owner is actually from Cleveland! Ahhhhhh, a little taste of CLE all the way out in Cali. Priceless.", "author": "Cara L."}

Its not the size of the ship it's the motion of the ocean and in terms of coolness the Black Horse popped several Viagras. \n\nThe max capacity is about 20 people, and they only serve beer and wine that is kept cold via bathtub behind the bar. It really kind of resembles a college dorm room converted into a saloon. \n\nThe greatest part about hanging here is the fact that you get to know everyone in the place. You can't help, but strike up a conversation when sitting inches from the next barfly. \n\nThe bartender (I'm assuming owner) is super chill and will play dice with the patrons, but watch out he's got a hot hand. \n\nCertainly not the type of place to hit up if you want to rage against the machine, but if a chill couple of beers is your tone for the night this place is right up your alley.", "author": "Danny W."}

What? Don't look at me like that. I know I can't be the only one who had this experience growing up. Words won't prepare you for how small this place is. You wouldn't believe me, so I won't belabor the point. Suffice it to say, it's small. Real small. But that's the appeal.\n\nThere are all sorts of domestic and imported beers. While there, I drank an Australian beer (IPA; light) and some Eastern European beer (Czech? I can't remember; it was dark in color like a stout but it wasn't as heavy as a stout). Wow. I am overwhelmed by the usefulness of this review. Apologies. In any case, the beers are all in a bathtub full of ice behind the bar. Awesome. The owner/barkeep can give you great details about all the brews, but still. Bathtub. Full of ice. Win.\n\nSpending an hour and a half or so here made me feel like a bona fide San Franciscan. It was a terrific re-introduction to the city by the bay. I didn't see a Black Horse. I might have seen a cherry tree. Woo hoo. I definitely saw a Londoner. And, I was in a pub. So, I guess the name of the bar makes sense -- which is more than I am doing now. What am I saying? Uh, come here to drink beer out of bathtub and battle claustrophobia.

After wandering around Union Street for a while, my husband and I wanted to get off our feet and relax with a beer. When we walked in and saw how tiny it was, and how there seemed to be no seats available, we almost left. But we were coaxed in an almost surrealistic way, \"Come in, come in, there's always room.\" Two people gave up their seats for us, which we felt bad accepting... but then after more people came in, we learned that that's the tradition: give up your seat for new people entering (especially women, which as a women made me feel slightly uncomfortable). Everyone seemed like good friends, but after being invited into the conversations, we found that most people had only met there. We stayed for 1-2 hours, talked to so many different people (including the bartender, who was amazingly nice), and had so much fun. Seriously - we're living in the Mission right now and are considering a move next year to a different part of the city, and the location of Black Horse London Pub may affect our decision. Best bar experience ever.\n\n(Btw, I noticed other reviewers saying claustrophobics shouldn't come here... I am claustrophobic and did freak out slightly when I saw the place. But I made sure to sit close to the door and was perfectly fine. Although, I was there on a Saturday afternoon and not an evening, so I don't know how crowded it gets later on.

Bush's 19% approval rating in 2008\n\nHopefully by now, you have an idea of what I'm talking about. The Black Horse is officially the smallest bar on the West Coast, and the owner suspects it's actually the \"Smallest bar west of the Mississippi.\" That term gets tossed around with more regularity than a Tiger Woods one night stand, but in this instance, I think it could be accurate. At capacity, the joint holds 22 people, and according to James, the owner of Black Horse, the most they've ever had inside at any given point was 25. That may sound like an extremely small amount of people, but to call this place diminutive is an understatement.\n\nIt's been said previously, but if you're a shut-in who hates people, it'd be a smart move to avoid this place at all costs. Due to the lack of square footage and available seating, you're forced to become BFFs with the other bar patrons real fast. For those lonely nights when a dark corner and a stiff drink are the only thing that'll suffice, go elsewhere - trust me.\n\nThey only serve beer (out of a bath tub) and they enforce their bar rules with the heavy hand of a supreme court judge. By no means will you be sentenced to execution for violating the laws of this itty-bitty London Pub, but you'll be politely asked to avoid using your cell phone and you'll have to prove that chivalry is not dead by vacating your seat if women outnumber men inside the bar. So if you're the kind of guy that has no manners, and you can't resist checking Twitter from your Crackberry for more than 15 minutes at a time, you might be better off trekking a few more blocks to get tipsy in the Marina. As guilty as I might be in regards to being a slave to my iPhone, it's a relief to suspend day-to-day activities and reliance on technology to enjoy a few good brews with strangers (A.K.A., friends you just haven't met yet), in a truly remarkable setting.\n\nIf you're checking out the place for the first time, like any bar in the city, do your best to venture out on a weekday. Weekends can be an absolute disaster, and this isn't the kind of place that has a high turnover rate for bar goers. Once folks get comfy, they're usually in for the long haul.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

I am from Canada, but my family lived in San Fran for a long while before I was born, and I've been back a number of times with them. I was so eager to explore the city on my own and had a list a mile long of things my family said I should see and do. \n\nWell, then I found the Black Horse London Pub and the majority of those plans got put on hold. I was yelping around our apartment and it popped up with some intruiging reviews. We walked by and it was empty. My husband, who is also Canadian but from a fairly British family line, was quickly enamoured by this tiny hole-in-the-wall pub that actually seemed, well, like a pub. (None of this So-And-So's Public Eatery crap for him). \n\nWe did it. We walked it. Immediately James treated us like family and not for one second did we feel like everyone knew we were tourists. James, the owner, learned our names off the bat and him and the female bartender introduced us to everyone who came through the door. We stayed until closing playing the dice game and watching soccer and even went out with James and some of the more die-hard regulars after closing. \n\nSO all our plans for big dinners out turned in to ordering pizza to this bar. We loved it. I would live in it if I could. As you've probably already read, the beer is in a bathtub and James picks up more as it starts to run out. James also makes food as needed for people to enjoy. And he had a good laugh when I though he put out peanut butter and crackers and ended up with a mouthful of mustard. It seats maybe 8 and perhaps another 10 standing, which just adds to the already huge amounts of charm. It's perfect. \n\nThey will take you in and welcome you like you've probably never been welcomed. And I am from Canadian - by and far considered to be uber polite - and I was blown away by the hospitality. \n\nJames - we don't stop telling people about your pub.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-29", "description": "When people try to describe how small a place is, they are sometimes given to saying, \"There's not enough room to swing a cat.\" With the Black Horse London Pub, such a remark would not be an exaggeration. This hole in the wall pub/deli on Union Street near Van Ness Avenue can comfortably seat about eight people but frequently holds many more. The record, according to the owner, is 53 people stuffed into this tiny beer room. Even with as few as a dozen drinkers, you find yourself becoming physically intimate with your neighbors, and any journey to the restroom invariably involves making new friends along the way.\nThis scenario could go horribly wrong in so many ways if it wasn't for the genteel and sociable clientele and the bonhomie of the good-natured bartenders and owner, James King, who welcomes every new arrival as if they were a long-lost friend. If King or the bartender somehow misses greeting you, there's a good chance that one of the other patrons will extend a warm welcome. We began this crawl at Tommy's Joynt, which proclaims \"Welcome strangers,\" but Black Horse is in a different league altogether. \nBlack Horse isn't so much a pub as it is a cool rec room, with a flat screen television perched at a neck-straining angle at the corner of the ceiling; a dart board on the wall hanging precariously close to the rest room; and a bathtub full of ice and beer behind the bar. The wall is decorated with pictures of Prohibition-era beer protesters (\"We want beer\") and soccer scarves. Since the Blackhorse is, after all, a London Pub, it can perhaps be forgiven for prominently displaying a blue Chelsea scarf.\nOn one recent visit during March Madness and right after St. Patrick's Day, the white porcelain, claw-footed beer tub was full of Guinness, Smithwicks, Harp and Corona. Also nestled in the ice were some lovely bottles of Chimay Reserve, which matched the vibe perfectly. \nAfter an hour or so, beer reinforcements arrived in the person of Marin Brewing Company Head Brewer Arne Johnson, who brought along a keg of his excellent cask conditioned IPA, which King generously poured into a large mug. Between popping open bathtub bottles and pouring Marin IPA, King was busy preparing cheese platters to nosh on with the beer.\nBlack Horse might not have the biggest beer selection, but that's not the point of this unique \"snug.\" At the Black Horse, it's all about the vibe and the camaraderie, with beer serving as a vital social lubricant. Even the injunction against cell phones seems designed to encourage real social interaction with your fellow revelers.\nCow Hollow is full of pretentious pubs and bars that attempt to create a friendly drinking atmosphere. Most of them fail miserably, and it all comes across as phony and artificial. James King could give them a master's class on the technique of a being proper publican; when you're in the Black Horse, you're in his house and, at least for the evening, part of the family. All in all, Black Horse London Pub is a delightful exercise in social interaction at its finest and one that must be experienced at least once as part of the city's vibrant, eclectic pub scene.", "author": "chuck l."}

I prefer to drop by after a walk with my Pupkins - What I love about this place is they let the Pupkins come in and hang out with their mom while their mom throws a few back.  The beer selection is fantastic (my favorite ~ Chimay BLUE - which they were out of this past Sunday; the shame of it all considering this bar is the only bar in SF that has the biggest account with Chimay).  \n\nAnd as mentioned by others, because of the tightness in space, folks are friendly and are happy to engage in conversation.  And yes, there appears to be an unspoken rule; men do offer their seats to the ladies.  Ahh, chivalry is not dead - a refreshing reminder of that men can and will be gentlemen despite the social pressures of living in a small metropolis where the standard is brawling and fighting amongst one another for the most ridiculous of things.  Folks here do not lack virtue or politeness.  \n\nSo if you're one of those people who are awkwardly social, grumpy and confrontational (and doesn't like Dogs), this place is NOT for you.\n  \nIf you are a person who appreciates meeting strangers and engaging conversation, and don't mind being courteous to others, this place IS for you.", "author": "Cris B."}

Words fail to describe the eccentricity and magic of this one-of-a-kind surreal bar experience.  \n\nFirst of all there's the mythology and cult appeal -- James, originally from Cleveland (who he describes is a good place to \"be from\" but not \"be at\") bought the place (originally a deli shop, and still is by the books) almost 20 years ago and has been running the unusual shotgun establishment since.  From the moment he says hey you'll love the guy.  Well, unless he's kicking you out for being on your cellphone -- no phones allowed!  (Texting is ok though).  Due to the zoning \"as a deli\" he's forced to close at 12pm and can only serve beer.  Not that he'd like it any other way, I'm sure.  James is the man.\n\nThe venue reminds me of the 7 1/2th floor in Being John Malkovich.  It is wedged between businesses like an earthquake or large construction vehicle played an unfortunate fate to its size.  Yet it adds so much to its appeal.  To stand in the Black Horse is an experience in an of itself.  Once inside you'll see that there's a vintage bathtub housing a keg of Caske Ale (1 of 2 only places that serve it) through a ghetto-rigged hose on a hand pump tap.  The rest of the tub serves as a colorful odorous trash bin for beer bottles.  What a sight!   \n\nThe rumor is if the barstools were removed 50 people can fit inside the place at once.  Even with only 20 or so patrons the bar seems impenetrable and intimidating for the shy passerby.  You will be bumping people, rubbing against them, apologizing, greeting, laughing, and partying with everyone in there like it or not.  There's also the matter of quirky dice games, outsourced food logistics (order a pizza to be brought here, no problem!), and the mythical cheese plater.  It has its own black board.  You will soon understand.\n\nSo what makes this place a 5-star Yelp \"good as it gets\" spot? \n\nThe people.\n\nThe Black Horse London Pub is effective in autonomously repelling the kind of people that wouldn't have a good time there, so you'll be treated to some of the friendliest outgoing people that San Francisco has to offer. You cannot move past someone without getting to know them, and you'll be glad you did.  \n\nThe forced circumstances ensures great times, guaranteed conversation, bewilderment, and a warm and fuzzy sense of spontaneous stranger togetherness that you've perhaps only seen on television.  Maybe only the mythical Cheers tops this experience.\n\nCome to The Black Horse and come often.  We will know your name.", "author": "niero g."}

It was packed, elbow-to-elbow, and there were only 5 people inside.  He assures me to just keep pushing, and sure enough, in the way back, there was room for us.  I will say, whether planned or not, the confined space was an excellent excuse for body contact.\n\nOnce in back, we hear that someone has bought a round for the bar, so we score free drinks and someone offers me a stool to sit on.  As we're drinking, a dice game is going on, and ends.  We can play in the next game for only a $1 buy-in (conveniently I had two bucks in my wallet).  \n\nHere's where it gets even better (I know, unbelievable!).  My pal takes the shaker, rolls, and loses.  The shaker is passed to me, and after three rolls, I've WON the entire game (which might have been called One Four Twenty-Four??).  How much did I win, you ask?  A whole $14!!!  So now I'm drinking free beer and up $12!!\n\nNow for the best part!  There is a nudie calendar of everyone who works there, complete with bios.  It was only in draft stages during my January visit, but I'm pretty sure the final version can only be better.\n\nAdditional Pros: The beers are recycled into a claw-foot bathtub behind the bar; everyone in that place is talkative and friendly; prices are super cheap.", "author": "Lindsay W."}

If you're claustrophobic, that's ok - you too can enjoy this fabulous establishment!  Just come during daylight hours - as I've heard it doesn't draw as much of a crowd.  The bartender (and co-owner) James was sweet as can be - and introduces himself to all of his customers, making it a point to remember their names for future visits.  But the *best* part?!  One of the house rules is that men must offer up their seats to ladies.  LOVE IT!  Too many men show a serious lack of chivalry... and while many should have learned this a long time ago, James proves that it's never too late to educate on proper etiquette.  \n\nAnd for all of you guys who aren't so pleased with having to offer up your seat, think of if this way:  it's a fantastic way to strike up a conversation with the dashing brunette across the bar.

They have a very small selection of beers but their choices are FANTASTIC. They have excellent taste in beers, and they're not only British beers, but also Austrian and German beers. They also had fun games, one being an electrocution one. It's great fun when you're drunk. The bartenders are super nice, they'd have to be cause this place seriously has only room for maybe 20-30 people MAX  (I think even 30 is pushing it).  They always have food because they're a food and beer/wine establishment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-04", "description": "Let me just get this out of the way to begin with. Yes gentleman, size matters! If you have heard that it doesn't please check your references again. They may be faulty. There are only a couple reasons why a woman would say that to you: 1. You have been with this girl for some time, possibly dating/ possibly marriage. She is not saying that because she is trying to make you feel better about yourself, although if she is nice she is sparing your feelings. It is quite the opposite, she is saying it because she is making herself feel better that she has stuck with a guy of your stature for this long. (*wink) 2. You are hooking up and in order for her to avoid your pitiful inadequacies, self esteem issues, or a night of hugging her pillow as she listens to you in the fetal position sobbing like a 4 yr old school boy in the corner, she says it doesn't matter. 3. Or lastly, regardless of what happened between the two of you, she is going to tease you to no end, behind your back and to your co-workers, once you are no longer intimate. \n\nIn the Know: Now with that said, take everything I just said and disregard it (for a moment). At the Blackhorse it is all about size, and trust me when I say, the smaller the better! I can count the maximum occupancy on my 'lil fingers and toes, and that includes standing room. The bar divides the space in half, roughly 2-3ish feet on either side. Behind the bar is a small (do I even need to say that if the whole thing is small?) service station, a place to make a delicious cheese platter and/or a samich (sandwich for all those properly edumakated folks), and of course an old school bath tub filled with cans or a keg. The decor is what you would expect to find at any local London pub, including but not limited to pictures of London, beer posters, hanging steins and my personal favorite \"Rules of Behavior.\" Now I feel as though these rules should just be common knowledge for any bar but apparently the good ol' days of male chivalry (you must give your seat to a lady if she doesn't have one) and female courtesy (ladies no one wants to hear what you have to say on your cell phone, especially about the guy you met outside your apartment at 3 in the morning and now you regret letting him know where you live because at any second he could turn into a stalker so you have to constantly keep your eye out every time you walk around your hood) have completely been ignored. Blackhorse, way to make us face our issues with claustrophobia and behavioural patterns all in one swoop. That is why we (the 'we' refers to me and my other personality) totally heart you! \n\nBehind the Bar: My favorite thing about going to certain bars is having a friend be a bartender. On top of receiving cheap to free drinks all night, they always give me the honest, inside scoop on what works and what makes them secretly want to burn the establishment down. More often than not they want to do the later but that generally goes hand-and-and with hating the owners of the place or knowing that they are working for people that are dumber than they are and resent them or the bar even more. (*not that that has ever happened to me...um....ya....) I am very happy to report that neither of those are an issue at this place. My friend loves the owner and loves the small space he works in. So really there are no negatives for this section. (might actually be a first!) *I should mention that the one thing quite literally behind the bar is the Black Horse calendar. People, if for nothing else, please take a gander at this. It could possibly be the hottest thing I have ever seen. \n\nWho is Who: This bar might be considered located in the Marina, but it is far from a Marina crowd. (Thank god!) The couple times I have been there the patrons are nothing but laid back people that just want to enjoy a cozy spot with some friends. I might go as far as to say this could be one of the best bars in the city. I wouldn't do that though because I am a cynical and selfish. I mean if you can only fit 20ish people in this bar, why the heck would I want to tell the masses to go there?", "author": "Sheyna G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-26", "description": "Countless times I have walked past the Black Horse Pub, the smallest bar in San Francisco- sometimes during the day, and sometimes at night when I see just how crowded and intimate it can get. And countless times I've said to myself, I should really check it out- yet I never did....until tonight. And thank god I did otherwise I would be missing out on one of the city's best kept secrets- a gem of a bar with friendly staff and a jovial ambiance. People are friendly, and due to the close proximity of you and your beer drinking neighbors, you can be sure you'll strike up a conversation with a stranger at some point during the evening. I had the Belgian Chimay, served in a glass fit for an ice cream sundae. The bartender reached into a bathtub filled with beer bottles- note they don't serve from a tap- to fish out the desired brew. The beer was served cold, and although it was colder than possible outside (this is San Francisco summer for you) the nearly claustrophobic nature of this establishment kept me warm. And claustrophobic isn't necessarily a bad thing here either. It's just pleasantly packed (and with friendly people, no doubt). Yes pleasantly packed, not packed like you find on the 30 or 45 buses going past Chinatown, but I digress. I had the feeling I had entered someones home (completely with pizza and laundry service, no kidding!) as charming knick knacks lined the walls. Even the bathroom was kept incredibly orderly for such a bustling pub. All in all, this is a wonderful and warm environment in which to enjoy a variety of beers. I highly recommend it over the more traditional Marina establishments.", "author": "Kate A."}

Jaimie was the bartender that night and made me feel right at home.  Met many locals which is what I was looking for.  Made friends with James who gave me the first tri-tip sandwich he made (some guy made it and brought it by to share!) which I thought was a kind gesture since I was a guest.  Someone also came by with a cup of what I think was an English stew of some sort.  I felt like I was part of the family!  Before I left I asked for a water and it was poured in a Radeberger Pilsner mug which was so cool looking I asked if I could buy it for my bar glass collection and as a souvenir of the place.

Perhaps I went on the wrong night, but after reading all these reviews I was under the impression that everyone talked to everyone, were eager to meet new people, etc. so I waltzed in by myself. Turned out, everyone inside knew each other (not sure if a large group of people went there together or what) and kind of just looked at me like I was a weirdo for going by myself. I felt very uncomfortable and awkward. Also, one of the bar's \"rules\" is to not butt in on others' conversations unless invited, so I didn't want to just jump in and start laughing along out of nowhere with people. I decided to stick it out for a second beer thinking that maybe I just needed to give it a chance but I just wanted to get out of there the whole time. I'm a social, nice guy so it's not like I was just some freak or some douche walking in. Again, no fault of the bartender or the bar itself, maybe the people on that particular night just sucked. The beer selection wasn't anything outstanding, but it was decent. I did like the atmosphere though and I could totally see how it could be a fun place.
