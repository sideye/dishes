When one day, I was passing through this area, I saw that there is one closer to my apartment. So I had dinner here with my friend about a couple of weeks ago which was delicious. Service was pretty good except for toward the end where they forgot to give us our ice cream, but they were pretty busy. My friend had covered the check so I didn't know that they charged the tip to it. I thought tip is only charged automatically if it's a group of 5 or more, but they charge for for smaller parties too?\n\nParking wasn't that hard as I found parking on the side residential street nearby.", "author": "Amy C."}

Though the food was ok, I am rating their service a ZERO, if it was ever an option!\n\nFelt very disrespected by server Brenda.  I enjoy eating Shabu broth with a blend of soy sauce. So I asked if they offer soy sauce. She happily said yes.  I also enjoy my rice with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, so I asked, the same girl. This time she responded with a mean disrespectful tone of voice, asking me back with a Southeast Asian accent \"is there anything else?\" When I calmly and respectful said \"no, thank you,\" she rushed off making a sound what seemed like a pout. I did not feel welcome there at all, worse service restaurant experience for me. I even ask to speak to their manager and they said there managers weren't available. Didn't really want to waist my time with this, just wanted to finish my food and get the hell out of there.\n\nI've had Shabu Shabu at restaurants own and operate by Koreans and Japanese and never had a single bad experience. These people still have a lot to learn when it comes to servicing their customer properly! \n\nIn writing this review, I'm also addressing to the owner and manager of this restaurant. You need to train your staff on how to be professional, polite and respectful to your customer. After all, your customers are the reason your business exist.\n\nBy the way, 15% service charge was automatically charged to my bill. We were a party of 2 people.

It's a busy store, people lining up for at least 30 mins, I know, and even it's super busy, the staff still greet us with a smile and being professional at work.\n\nUntil today.\n\nMy faith for Shabu House, after coming here for 4.5 years, has splattered into pieces. \n\nWe are a group of 4 and it happened that we all wanted to get Chicken Ginger Broth. Little did we know, Shabu House automatically offered one pot if 2 people requested the same broth. However, we'd love to have split pot even we are getting the same broth. Our server, a girl with ash blond high ponytail, gave us 2 pots without the divided pot, so we asked her if we can get the divided pot and we pointed to the table next to us since they had the divided pot. Our server repeated \"like that pot?\" and took the pots back. When she returned, she gave us 2 divided pots with different broth. We approached her again and told we wanted the same broth but with the divided pots. \n\nShe made a face and looked unhappy. Turned off the heat and made a sound when closing the cap. Took the pots away. Gave us the new pot. I said \"Thank you\" when she put the pot down. She didn't say anything and left with the unpleasant face. \n\nSure. \n\nI admitted there was miscommunication. Maybe we should have confirmed with her that we want \"the same broth with divided pot\". Or maybe she could ask us too, I don't know. Or maybe she was too busy at work so she was annoyed by us. But honestly, I don't think we deserved a face like that.\n\nHoney, 15% gratitude was added to the bill automatically. Maybe you can show us some patience. We weren't yelling at you for changing a pot. Or maybe you could respond with a plain tone of \"sure' or \"yeah\" or \"no problem\" or \"uh-huh\" when I said \"thank you\". \n\nTalking about being professional at work, our assorted veggies were forgotten for the longest time. Had to wait until the servers done taking shots with their friends at the bar and tried to holla to get our veggies. Other than that, the food was great as usual.

It was the closest hotspot place from where I stayed, Westwood Park. I made a reservation on a weekday but it wasn't really necessary because the restaurant was crowded but not full. \n\nAs soon as I seated, I was satisfied by the dipping sauces on the table. There were peanut and plain soy sauce that you could add more condiments/toppings to it. I added seasame oil, scallions, red pepper immediately! \n\nThe menu was simple as there were only 3 options of meat available: Beef, lamb and pork. Honestly, I prefer simple menu when eating hot pot. I don't really like the meatballs and miscellaneous stuff that other AYCE hotpots offer. The meat was so on point. We tested lamb and beef platters at first, then decided to only go with beef after. We as a party of 3 could only eat 5 rounds of meat until we were too full to walk home. The portion in 1 dish was very generous as they had 4 layers of beef in each dish. The Kobe beef was of top quality. It was so juicy, tender and didn't have too much fat. We had the spicy miso and ginger kitchen broths - both were not spicy at all. Both broths were sweet and weren't salty! \nShabu House also gave a dish of assorted veggies and udon to every person in our party. you could also order rice here! I really liked the rice here because it was sticky and soft (almost watery because it was cooked with lots of water). \n\nShabu House concluded my 5-day food journey to San Francisco. I had so many good food here and Shabu House didn't disappoint me.

We were hungry (but not starving) and wanted to share one order of meat, so we ordered some extra sides to meet the min spending requirement. \n\nWe ended up ordering a combination of Kobe beef and kurobuta pork with sides of two eggs and kabocha pumpkin. Each order of meat comes with a platter of veggies and udon, a bowl of rice (but we substituted with more udon), and ice cream for dessert. We thoroughly enjoyed both meats and all of our veggies; everything was very fresh and well prepared.\n\nIt was a good amount of food and we were both stuffed at the end (in fact, we couldn't finish all the udon), so it was kinda surprising to us how one person could finish a whole portion of meat + veggies on their own. Highly recommend splitting one meat order if both individuals in your party have an average appetite like us.\n\nAs far as sauces go, they have a sweet sesame-based sauce and a ponzu sauce along with typical shabu sauce ingredients such as minced garlic, green onions, etc. They give you an empty bowl so  you can mix and match sauces and other ingredients. Since I'm not a big fan of ponzu sauce, I mostly stuck to mixing garlic with the sesame sauce.\n\nAfter hot pot/shabu I always like to try the broth since it's been infused with all of the yummy flavors of the meats and veggies from the meal. When I tried the broth here, I was absolutely blown away by how sweet it was. I could not stop drinking it. I was already stuffed, but still I somehow found the room to drink up most of the broth. There was barely anything left in the pot by the time I was done; I liked it that much! \n\nMy mom also really enjoyed the taste and speculated that there might have been some msg in the broth to give it that umami flavor, but I did not get thirsty at all throughout the rest of the night, so that's a pretty good sign the taste was completely natural.\n\nThe whole meal only set us back $35 after tax and tip...I consider that really great value, especially for this type of food! Please note they add an automatic 15% service charge to your bill.", "author": "Dianna H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-26", "description": "For those that want to treat themselves to a simple and delicious meal, Shabu House exemplifies the notion that sometimes less is more.\n\nCame here on a wintry Friday night around 7 and waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3. First thing I noticed was how compact the restaurant was. I've been to the other Shabu Houses before, both spots in Richmond and the one in Burlingame, as well as other shabu joints in the city and this might be one of the smallest ones. This meant most people waiting had to do it outside. To avoid the cold, I noticed people cramming in the middle of busy service where the waitresses had to bring out hot bowls of broth and other ingredients. I must commend the staff here, not only were they understanding and kind, they were also very attentive and made sure (double and tripled checked) we had everything.\n\nWe chose the AYCE option to celebrate a friend's birthday. All the things came out quickly, and to my surprise, they gave each of use our own fully lined large plate of meat. All other places I've been to bring out communal plates which meant we had to reorder constantly. The meats were beautifully marbled and folded so it was easy to grab without ruining the structure of each slice. The broth (spicy miso) had a nice kick but isn't as flavorful as its hot pot counterpart. I believe this is because they want the emphasis on the quality of the meat. The veggies were also a nice change of pace in a meat focused meal.\n\nOverall, it was really delicious but I think their AYCE option is the wrong way to do shabu. I noticed that I wasn't enjoying each bite of meat and just trying to get my money's worth. For 41-ish after tips and tax, it felt like a challenge more than what it really was, a simple and delicious meal. Next time I come, I'll take the less is more approach with the single order so I can enjoy the amazingly marbled meats.", "author": "Philip W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-08", "description": "When the weather is cold and/or rainy, there are few things better than AYCE shabu to get you all warmed up.  And when it's hot outside?  AYCE shabu is still the answer!  I mean, they offer AYCD for a reason right?  Plus, if you're going to sweat, might as well make them meat sweats!  Mmm...meat sweats.\n\nWhile there are plenty of shabu and hot pot restaurants sprouting up these days, Shabu House has long stood as one of SF's best options for either.  Yes, shabu and hot pot aren't the same, yet competitors from either category can't offer the same combination of taste, quality, and overall value (save for Hot Pot Garden, if/when they ever reopen again).  Granted, $33 per person for AYCE (or $23 for vegetarian) may not seem like much of a value (it's $11 to add on AYCD), but it is when what you get is just so good!\n\nBeyond the shabu, the menu also offers a mix of starters and rice bowls (single entrees), but I can't say I've tried any of them (since they'd only stop me from hitting the AYCE that much harder!).  Of the handful of broths (Traditional Water, Spicy Miso, and Ginger Chicken) and meats (American Style Kobe Beef, Lamb, and Kurobuta Pork) to choose from, the Spicy Miso with Lamb and Kobe Beef is my go-to combo.\n\nAlthough the broth doesn't quite live up to its \"spicy\" name, it actually has the perfect level of heat and packs a tasty punch (especially as it gets cooked down with everything else).  The basket of veggies, udon, and tofu (which are always really fresh) do a good job of soaking up all that miso flavor.  As for the meats, the lamb isn't very gamy and nicely complements the broth while the Kobe Beef is usually well marbled and very tender.  The pork is great as well, but the other two hold up to the shabu a little better.\n\nIf there was one potential knock to be said, it'd be with how service can drag at times, especially when it's busy.  However, it's not significantly worse than any other shabu/hot pot joint and the workers are all really friendly.  Plus, parking is a lot easier, the lines are much shorter, and the food is just as good, which makes this Shabu House just as awesome, if not more so, than the original one on Geary!\n\nAnd BTW, if meat sweats really aren't your thing, don't worry...the free scoop of ice cream at the end of the meal will help cool you down!", "author": "Mike L."}

Yup, swish and swash all over the place and for only about 33 bucks! They only offer about 3 types of protein from what I remember. Pork, beef and lamb. To be honest though, I can't really tell one from the other after the meat sweats starts. What I will say is that the meat appears to be of good quality, fresh and plentiful. There isn't a huge sauce bar so you can't get too creative but the basics are there. Ponzu, sesame, chili, scallions and garlic if you've carried mints for the night. Our servers were pretty attentive in refilling our meat and vegetables. She also made sure we knew about ice cream being part of the meal!

We just saw it on the menu and knew it had to be done. $33 per person is a bit steep but hey, it had to be done. It had to be done.\n\nThe eats here were delicious. It's all you can eat, so you already know your stomach is gonna be satisfied. But would the tastebuds be happy too? Yes, yes my tastebuds were super happy and jumping for joy with first bite to about 80% through the meal. We kinda hit a bit of a wall around plate 5 and struggled and crawled our way to completing 6 plates of meat. We definitely ate our moneys worth here. We had two types of soup base, spicy miso and traditional water. The spicy miso was my personal favorite. Not spicy at all and it gave the meat a nice and simple hit of flavor. The traditional water tasted a little bit too much like the sea for me, but it definitely wasn't bad at all.\n\nThe meat itself was amazingly tender, obviously. Thin meat better not be tough. They give you a few sauces to dip your meat into and a cup of rice as well. Also there's a plate of veggies if you wanna pretend this meal is sorta healthy. Our servers were pretty good about refilling our soup base and getting us more plates of meat.\n\nHonestly, I'd go back here again.

Understood that this may have been a fluke and things may happen. Alerted the waitress right away and she sent me a replacement vegetable tray. \n\nSecond and third: the appetizer and meat (essentially the core of the meal) came out 20 minutes after the broth and veggies. By then, we had finished eating half of our veggies. \n\nThirdly (and that's went I threw in the towel): Ate halfway through the meat to find another piece of hair! Immediately brought this up with the waitress. I asked her what had happened as we have been there several times before. She later came back to tell me that she told the person cutting the meat to be more careful. Also that this has happened in the past. I asked to speak to a manager in which she said there was no manager onsite and that she has tried to mention incidents like this to the manager before. She offered to send out another meat dish, but I was more so offended than hungry. I just lost my appetite...how are you going to force more food in front of me?! Seeing how the rest of my family sat in an awkward silence all looking at their food and questioning the quality of their food, I ask that there needs to be some sort of adjustment to the bill. She understood the nature of the incident and agree that an adjustment was necessary.  \n\nI understand running a restaurant can get overwhelming. But 4 stars for this place makes no sense.

They offered Dalena multiple shots and she did not hesitate to take them. \n\nIt made me curious to why would one be drinking while on the job and it was fairly busy, and to see her coworkers running back and forth to attend to all customers made me think that was unfair.\n\nAs we were almost done with our 1st meat plates, we ordered again because we knew it might take awhile for it to come out. 2nd order was just 1 plate of kobe beef (to share), 1/2 a plate of spinach, 1 rice for the bf, and a water refill for him as well. Dalena took this order with a smile. \n\nAs I watched her walk back to the cash register, her friends were leaving, the 3 girls came up to her behind the counter to hug and say goodbye to her. \n\nAt this point we were done with our plates and were patiently waiting, our wait turned to 20 minutes and thats when I thought to myself that it seemed as if maybe she might have forgotten to punch in our order in the system. I watched the other servers coming out with multiple meat plates for other tables. I mention this to my bf and he says no lets just wait. So we do for about 10 more minutes. Our broth that was boiling for this long started to evaporate (see picture attached). We see Dalena walking back and forth not really doing anything but just walking and seem to look over our way but ignore us. \n\nUntil it came to a point her coworker, the other server with braids, purple and blonde hair notices that it looks as if we were done eating, comes up to us and ask if we needed anything else. This is when my boyfriends face lit up and had the WDF face. Mind you he is patient and doesnt get pissed off easily. So I was like \"ooooooh!\" He and I both at the same time said, \"No we been waiting for our order.\" She asks us what we ordered and we told her, \"a plate of beef, spinach, 1 rice and a refill for water.\" She quickly arranged this for us and asked if we needed anything else, thats when I said \"i guess we now need more broth too (sarcastically) but i really did appreciated that she intercepted this table from Dalena. \n\nWhat I can say was worse about this experience is not her drinking, or forgetting our order, its the fact that we seen her looking at our table multiple times, AND her coworker taking over but she never bothered to come back to assist or even say anything to us. Why? Maybe because she realized she messed up, but why not come up and apologize, she completely ignored us and at the end did not even give us the ice cream/check, it literally was turned over to her coworker and her coworker noticed we were mad/pissed or maybe felt bad having us wait so she gave us 15% off.

My expectations were high, especially since I previously had enjoyed the food in their Geary location. On this evening, my fianc\u00e9e Santi and I were fortunate to beat the dinner crowd by arriving early. The clean, vertical interior included a narrow walkway that divided a long counter and good numbers of booths and tables stationed along the walls. The atmosphere on this particular evening was calm and quiet. \n\nThe regular size two meat combo Shabu Shabu ($20.49) arrived with our choice of spicy miso broth, meat, assorted veggies, udon, rice, and dessert. I ordered the lamb/beef and for Santi the lamb/pork combo that were thinly sliced with good fat and lean meat ratio. We also ordered a side of Kabocha Pumpkin ($3.50) and Enoki Mushroom ($4).\n\nPortion size was excellent. The spicy miso broth tasted complex, smooth, and delicious once the meat and veggie flavors were well integrated. The meat were easy to cook and did not dry out quickly; and the number of veggie options were topnotch, including the side orders. In addition to the Kabucha Pumpkin and Enoki, I enjoyed the tofu, udon, spinach, and shitake mushrooms. \n\nOur dinner also included a scoop of green tea and azuki ice cream. The flavors were striking and not just another filler to finish to meal. The sharp green tea flavor had an deepening effect, and the azuki ice cream tasted rich and concentrated. They were equally excellent.\n\nService was attentive and friendly. Our water was constantly refilled and our server occasionally came to check on the shabu pot. Overall, their prices, portion size, quality, and service were consistent with my experiences at their Geary location. I hope to visit their restaurants in Burlingame and Milpitas.", "author": "Daniel L."}

That being said, all of it is HIGH quality. Because this is shabu shabu and technically not hot pot-- they only offered a couple flavours of soup, the most flavourful of which is a spicy miso. However, be aware that the chicken ginger broth is easily overwhelmed by the lamb, and your broth will end up tasting like lamb ginger lol. We found the spicy miso to taste the best (not too spicy! Kinda sour, like kimchi with miso, but super bomb) and helped cook everything along. The AYCE i includes udon noodles as well as a wide assortment of vegetables. If you are looking for variety, this may not be the place. However, if you want quality at a decent price, this place might be to your liking. Just come during dinner because the prices feel more justified lol (it was like $36 for AYCE!) \n\nService was also a little slow (maybe because it was almost closing time) as it took them 15-20 mins with a reminder to shave our second servings of lamb and beef, so that's why a star is dinged off.", "author": "Christa Lei S."}

Shabu shabu has always been my lesser-liked cousin of Taiwanese hot pot, which I adore (especially on a cold SF night). The shabu shabu at Shabu House, however, is my favorite Shabu Shabu I have EVER had. \n\nWe ordered 1/2 the Garlic Chicken broth and 1/2 the Spicy Miso. Both broths had a nice flavor and was a nice addition instead of just the hot water traditional Shabu Shabu cooks in. Both broths also were nice to drink some of (not the traditional way, I know). Of the two, I preferred the Spicy Miso as it was just a little more interesting a flavor, but would happily recommend both. \n\nIn terms of things to dip/cook, we opted for $33 AYCE (all you can eat). There's also a $44 AYCE and AYCD (all you can drink) option, but it was a school night, so we stuck with waters. One of our party is vegetarian so she got the AYCE vegetarian option for cheaper ($23 perhaps?). To get AYCE, everyone at the table must opt in for that option. The quality of the foods to dip was excellent. There is a noticeable difference between the kobe beef (super soft and marbled) and the regular beef. Both were very thinly sliced (delicious) and cooked perfectly in the broth. The lamb was also tasty and the pork was a nice change up from the red meats. With the meat AYCE, you get a plate of veggies too that has tofu, noodles, carrots, mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, spinach, and lettuce...all in plentiful amounts. And since it's AYCE, you can ask for more of anything you liked. I enjoyed most the kobe beef, spinach, enoki mushrooms, regular mushrooms, and the big noodles. Everything was super fresh, well-cut, clean, and delicious.\n\nWait staff is very friendly and helpful.

Since there's a sharing fee if everyone doesn't order something over $5, we added an order of agedashi tofu and unagi over rice to avoid additional fees. \n\nAfter we finished, we were brought out ice cream for dessert. We had the choice of red bean or green tea. You can even ask to get a scoop of each flavor, which we all opted to do. They even serve Maeda-en ice cream!\n\nWhen we left the restaurant, there was a crowd of people at the door and outside waiting to get seated. The restaurant itself isn't that big with table seating and counter/bar seating. \n\nGoing out for shabu is always fun and a different eating experience.

Havent been here in a while and my cousin decided to take me out in celebration of getting accepted into CSUSacramento :D.\n\nCame for dinner and it was a semi-packed house. Since most of the two-people tables were occupied, we decided on the counter. The counter's pretty nice if you want your own pot. It's clean, wide, and right by the flat screen TV. Although, the area where the pot goes in is kinda far, so you actually have to stretch your arm a bit to grab food from your pot. \n\nSince I typically came here for lunch, dinner was a different experience for me. The prices are more heavier $31 fpr AYCE shabu ($17.99 for a regular plate of shabu meat, $20 for a large). \n\nThe pot has three types of broth:\n- Plain water, Ginger chicken, and Spicy miso.\nThere are 4 options for meats:\n- American Kobe Beef, Lamb, Kurobuta pork, or a mix of two meats.\n* there is also the vegetarian option for $14.99\n\nI opted for American Kobe beef with ginger chicken broth. Every shabu comes with optional bowl of rice, a platter of veggies(lettuce, spinach, enoki mushrooms, a huge ass mushroom cap, tofu squares, and carrots), two sauces; the sesame sauce and a soy sauce/vinegar mix, and udon noodles. You also get the option of ice cream (green tea or red bean) afterwards.\n\nOverall: the meat is nicely sliced into thin cuts that make it easier and faster to get cooked. The broth does take a while to get warm but eventually it does. When you add your veggies, do be careful because it actually gets really hot. I was surprised however, by the sudden decrease of veggies on my plate. Last time i came, there was lots of tofu squares and even squash slices. But tonight, i only had 4 tofu cubes and nowhere did i see the squash slices. :/ \n\nThe sesame sauce is my favorite, it actually helps give flavor not only to the meat, but to the veggies as well. The ice cream flavors are always the same, but their green tea and red bean ice creams are both creamy in texture and full of its respecrable flavor.\n\nThe workers here are very attentive, despite how hectic it can get in here. Thankfully we came when there wasnt a line! You are definitely paying your money's worth here, you can always conclude that you come in starving and come out full as hell.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

I know they also have an AYCE and AYCE&Drink but i've never tried it! I think i'm a pretty big eater for my size and the regular fills me up fine, so I never really thought about it.\n\nI always get the spicy miso (it's not that spicy, but has a nice kick!) with regular american style kobe beef. The meat is always good quality and it's fun watching them carve it through the glass while you're waiting!!! One order comes with a plate of veggies, including napa cabbage, spinach, udon noodles, tofu, mushrooms, carrots, and enoki. I really like the veggies here except when I get alllll the big stems for the cabbage (am I just being picky..? probably). OH and the dipping sauces!!! Omg the sesame/peanut sauce (creamy beige one) is so good, and so is the ponzu! I like how you can customize it with the green onions, garlic, and cilantro too.\n\nOh! And at the end they give you free ice cream!!

My first time here was about 2 years ago with my buddy Peter.  Thanks to him for introducing me to Shabu House!\n\nThe price is $32/person for the AYCE option.  You can do the regular a la carte dinner as well, but if you know you can eat a good amount of meat, I'd recommend just going with the AYCE...because it just makes sense.  I came here with my family, 2 brothers and two nephews.  I called in to have a table reserved for 7 of us.  When we arrived, we waited about 15-20 minutes before the previous group left before we were able to get a table.\n\nThe table they gave us was probably made to seat 5 adults comfortably.  So, squeezing 7 people into a 5-seater was quite uncomfortable to say the least.  But we did get our table, so we can't complain too much.  \n\nWe ordered 2 plates of the Kobe beef, 1 plate of lamb and 1 plate of pork to start off our meal and I think everyone pretty much killed that off within the first 10 minutes of our meal.  We asked for two types of broth, the spicy miso, which is my personal favorite, and the ginger chicken which the kids liked.  They also gave us 4 plates of veggies, which took us a little longer to kill than the meat.  Having 3 men and 3 growing boys at the dinner table is definitely a challenge because you have to fight for your food if you want to eat.  Of course, we ordered more meat...lol\n\nThey all said that they enjoyed the meal.  The meats were good, both broths were tasty and the veggies were fresh.  Service was a little slow, but bearable.\n\nAt the end of our meal, they gave us a choice of a scoop of red bean or green tea ice cream.  I asked for a half scoop of both flavors because I like them both equally.  When the bill came, I was shocked because they gave us the wrong bill of $35.98, which I told the waitress I would be more than happy to pay.  Lol\n\nBut I told her that there must be a mistake since there are 7 of us so it's quite impossible to be so cheap.  Our real bill came out to just below $300 after tax and tip.  Although it was pricey, but it's not everyday that we go out and enjoy a great meal together.

Upon closer examination, it was a tiny piece of blue rubber band! Shocked, I quickly flagged down one of the servers to show her what we found.

I had a sinking feeling that I had probably already ingested some.\n\nWhen I told the server that I found more pieces, she dug through the green onion container and found even more. I advised her to alert the kitchen staff that this happened so that they can be more careful, because I felt this was highly unsafe, with my thoughts wandering to the gastric acid melting rubber in my stomach. The server told me it was probably from chopping the onions and offered a 15% discount. Again, all of this in a nonchalant tone of voice.\n\nHoping for a more concerned response from another server, I flagged another one down and explained the situation. I explained again my thoughts on how dangerous this could be... I'm certain digesting plastic is NOT good for people.

Granted, there are times when this place is packed (i.e weekends), but other times when it isn't so busy, we would wait for a long period of time to get a refill on water after flagging them down TWICE. I would suggest to order and ask for everything the moment you order, even if it means ordering a second cup of water, since you won't see your server again until you ask for the check. \n\nThe food itself is decent, and I haven't done the AYCE option for $32/person since I am stuffed by the large plate. I usually do a combo with the selection of lamb and Kobe beef. Yum! The small plate/appetizers are good as well and the sauces that go with the food for them vary on the day you go - it's been different each time I've ordered! I really enjoy the lamb and the miso soup is the perfect balance for me. However, I only come to this location now if I am too lazy to drive out all the way to Clement for Shabu Club because of their service.", "author": "Victoria K."}

My friend loves this location, probably because it is close to his home.\n\nI didn't know what to expect. I didn't even know what to order. He gave me a run down of what to order: a large combo meat plate ($20) lamb and beef with spicy miso soup. As with all shabu, it comes with a plate of veggies, udon, and rice with a complimentary ice cream for dessert. They also provide ponzu and peanut sauce.\n\nDownside is that they don't have ramen if you prefer ramen over udon. And they don't have that fancy split pot, but then again, they only have 3 different soups for you to choose from (plain, spicy miso, and ginger chicken). Another downside is they don't offer a good variety of broths.\n\nWe didn't get AYCE because knowing me a large plate is definitely enough to fill me up.\n\nWhat's nice about Shabu House is that they also offer happy hour, 15% off your entire bill from 5-6pm. They also offer all you can drink too in addition to AYCE shabu for about $40. AYCE shabu is about $30. Prices are average, the same as other shabu places.\n\nThe meat was marbled very nicely making the meat flavorful and tender when cooked. The spicy miso was also flavorful.\n\nService was pretty good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-19", "description": "I LOVE SHABU HOUSE ON GEARY! This new location? Ehhhh, not so much...\n\nThe newest of the three Shabu Houses to open in the SF Peninsula Area in the old Kasumi (Izakaya restaurant) space, I was ecstatic when I heard about this new location on Ocean Avenue. Yay, I can get my soul-warming shabu fix close to home. However, after my experience last night, I rather trek across the city and deal with nightmare parking issues in the Outer Richmond or deal with the rowdy drunktards greedily taking advantage of the AYCD at the Burlingame location. Let me explain why. \n\n1. FOOD QUALITY IS MEDIOCRE\n\n*The kobe beef was dull in color, not very marbled or very tender; it was actually a bit tough. My friend had the lamb which crumbled into pieces. Don't bother ordering the chicken karaage. It was all batter and the chicken was dry. \n\n*The sesame sauce was too thick and gloppy. It was also bland and lacked a rich nuttiness. The ponzu sauce was so salty to the point it numb my tongue.  \n\n*The broth (choice of water, spicy miso and ginger chicken broth) is filled with MSG not flavor. I'm sensitive to MSG but never had a problem with the broths in the other locations. However, during dinner last night I felt my heart racing from the copious amounts of MSG they put in the Spicy Miso broth and was up all night from cotton ball mouth syndrome. \n\n2. SERVICE  IS  SLOW AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE VERY INEXPERIENCED \n\nThough friendly, the employees really lack time management skills and need to learn how to streamline their processes.  \n\nWhen there's a crowd of people waiting to be seated, why are you fumbling with sauces in the back (there's an open window to the prep area)? And more importantly, why are there two people doing that without anyone in the front of the house? They have a busboy to clear off and clean the tables yet the waitresses are helping the busboys while customers are frustrated wanting to be seated and/or  wondering where their orders are.  \n\n3. THE SMALLEST LOCATION OF THE THREE (not their fault)\n\nThere's a ~45 person capacity with one large table in the back. If you have a large party, the Burlingame location is your best bet.  Parking is very easy here though. \n\nI wouldn't come running back to this Shabu House location unless they work out their kinks. For their sake, I hope they do because this is a very convenient location outside of SF's \"New Chinatown\" in Richmond. Until then, I'm sticking to their Geary Boulevard location or Gcube in the Sunset when in need of a Shabu Fix. \n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Shabu Lunch/Dinner Sets comes with Udon, Rice, Veggies (tofu, cabbage, spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushroom and carrots) and ice cream. \n*AYCE is $31 and AYCE & AYCD is $41 (prices have increased).\n*2 hour limit for AYCE & AYCD.\n*Reservations accepted.\n*For some reason, they use old school credit card carbon copy slips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buv-wKDpSL6Iy4_PM1LyMw?select=g3iFxjic1L6vhzxGg2eVFw I hope they destroy copies after reconciling their sales.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Being the foodies we are and the craving for anything soupy in this cold weather, my friend and I finally made our way here last night.\n\nWAITING/SEATING:\nWe walked in and told the waitress table for two.  She said it would be just a couple of minutes (even though there was plenty of empty seats).  We stood there for 5+ minutes while she set up our table by placing napkins, chopsticks, and our sauce dishes on the table.  Why couldn't we just sit while she did all that?  \n\nAPPETIZERS:\n*Chicken Kaarage - Pass.  The chicken was cut up and deep fried in small pieces so what you tasted was mainly batter.\n*Gyoza - Good.  The veggie pork filling was delicious while the outer shell remained crispy.\n\nSHABU:\n*Broth: Choice of miso, spicy miso, or chicken\n*Shabu by plate or all you can eat ($31 for all you can eat or $41 for all you can eat/drink, 2 hr limit)\n*Veggies (mushrooms, lettuce, spinach, carrots) & udon noodles included\n*Ponzu and sesame sauces\n\nEverything here tastes...different.  I ordered the Kobe beef and lamb combo and noticed that the quality of the meat was not the same compared to the other two Shabu Houses.  The lamb was fattier and the beef...well, it just didn't taste as good.  The spicy miso broth was lighter and lacked the flavorful depth I'm use to.  Although the ponzu sauce tasted similar, the sesame sauce seemed watered down.\n\nNOTE: You may want to think twice about doing the all you can eat.  You're limited to two hours and the waitresses make that clear.  I watched a couple come in and was told that they were going to wait on seating them because their two hours would start as soon as they sit down.  Service is slow and I watched the guy at the table next to us wait almost 10 minutes before he got another plate of beef.\n\nSERVICE:\nSLOW!!!  I'm use to quick and efficient service when I visit the other two Shabu Houses and I wish they would've sent over some of those employees to \"train\" ones at this location.  The waitresses often looked lost and followed each other around.  They never smiled and I find it odd that they were bussing tables since we saw a bus boy working there.  \n\nPARKING:\nMetered street parking which is easier to find than the other two locations.\n\nBased on service and food quality, I doubt I'd be back...", "author": "Nicole S."}

The portion was bigger than usual, so I was pretty happy about that. It also came with standard veggies, tofu and udon. The nice additional plus was that they serve free ice cream at the end of the meal.\n\nThe reason for 3 stars is mainly because I've had better/more tender meat at other shabu places. I also didn't like how you are forced to choose only one broth even if you have two people ordering two meal sets. This is the first time I've experienced this. We got the spicy miso and it was good, but I would've also liked to try one of their other broths. \n\nOverall I would come back since I love shabu shabu but this place probably wouldn't be one of my top picks.\n\nTip: You get 15% off your meal if you go before 6 pm!

I dont know how long this location has been open but everything looks fairly new and modern. \n\nThe food was so gooood. We came here after a gym sesh ready for an all you can eat meat night! For only $31.00, you get a choice of American Style Kobe Beef, American Kurobuta Pork, or Lamb with a choice of broth: Traditional Water, Spicy Miso, or Ginger Chicken Broth. Served with the typical sesame and ponzu sauce that you can customize with onions, garlic, daikon, and hot sauce. We chose the Spicy Miso & with the first order we got American Kobe Beef & Lamb. That was JUST the beginning as we continued with another order of all 3 meats on the menu. Finally we proceeded to order 2 more plates of American Kobe Beef. \n\nWith a grand total of 7 plates of meat, a plate of veggies & udon each, and a bowl of rice each between 2 people, pretty sure the couple sitting at the table next to us [that had 1 plate of meat each] thought we were monsters that had bottomless pits for stomachs. We definitely ate our money's worth. The quality of meat was amazing with a good enough thickness and a generous quantity per plate. The pieces were not so thin that they fall apart when you pick it up like some shabu places.\n\nI did notice the quality of meat slightly decreased on our 6th and 7th plate but its quite understandable at that point. Also our soup was so drenched in meat juices at the end of our meal that it did look pretty nasty. Maybe they could consider having a slotted spoon so that those who order a lot of meat could clean it out a little & refresh with some more broth.  Either way it was delicious to the end. Even got a free scoop of yummy green tea ice cream !\n\nService was great, sometimes a little hard to get their attention but they are all very sweet and patient. \n\nHighly recommend this place for AYCE shabu!", "author": "Denise W."}

I always think that I can eat more than my weight, but I always end up not returning for seconds and spending more money than I should..... This is why I absolutely love shabu house.\n\nShabu house is definitely my go-to place for shabu, and it should be everyone else's as well. Service is fast and friendly - people think that since you cook your own food, you shouldn't tip as much. That's the case with some places, but at shabu house, you can clearly see that the waitresses try their best to make your shabu experience a good one. \n\nOkay, back to my AYCE rant.. Their AYCE is about $20-$30 a person (don't remember) but I usually don't go for it. I think it's mostly because I don't like getting two plates of veggies. It takes up a lot of room on the table. \n\nWhat I strongly advise is this: get a regular sized plate with your choice of meat (I prefer the beef & lamb), and then add on regular plates of additional meat. We usually get about two or three additional plates of meat and our bill comes to be about $40 which I think is a lot more worth than the AYCE.\nAlso, get the spicy miso broth and add a bunch of garlic. Then add green onions in your ponzu sauce. Sooooo goood!\n\nThe best part is the ice cream at the end. Without it, I'd probably be spending more money elsewhere on dessert!

I glanced at the check (for a party of two), and there is a 15% service charge. I've never seen that before. The main reason I come during their \"Happy Hour\" is to get the 15% discount (which I eventually pass on for the tip's amount). I asked one of the friendly wait staff about it, and she said it's the tip. Hmmm. So they automatically charge a tip for a party of two? I'm used to seeing that for a large group, but never for a party of two. I later learned that even if you dine alone, they charge 15% for party of five or less. C'mon, I'm cooking the goods myself!\n\nWhile it doesn't affect me since I usually pay a 15% tip from the 15% discount anyways, I could have easily, and not knowingly paid twice for the tip! I'd say that's some shady business shenanigans! They are forcing their customers to pay a tip, regardless of what their individual experience was really like.

I really liked this Shabu House until recently, when I realized how the new waitresses don't know how to seat people. We visited on a weekend night, a little after they opened and the waitresses were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. There were reservations and walk-ins (WOW SO complicated), and it seemed to be a little too much for them because they didn't know what to do. Three parties of walk-ins actually confronted one waitress about the seating issue, asking the most BASIC question---why don't they just seat people inbetween reservations? I agreed with them because we have all been waiting for so long and they would just leave tables empty! Is it really that hard to figure out the seating arrangement? I've been to busier restaurants than this and this is by far the most unprofessional one. And, on top of everything, the waitresses weren't even efficient! Many tables were waiting for their food, waiting to be served, waiting to pay...I really do think the waitresses need to be better trained. The old staff was a lot smarter than the current one. \n\nWe ended up waiting over two hours just to be seated..and that only happened AFTER that one waitress was confronted.

They have happy hour from 5-6 for dinner but if you really want to make sure you get the discount (15% off) you should come before 5:30. \n\nIf you've never been to shabu, you pick your choice of broth, size of meat, and then you wait for the servers to bring your broth and wait for it to boil. Then you throw in all your meats and veggies and cook them to perfection. Just a tip for new timers. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT throw all your meat into the pot at once. You should cook it piece by piece. ( sorry it bugs me when my guy friends throw it all in the pot. Such a waste of good meat) Anyway, this place also offers Ayce shabu for 31 bucks but I can't eat enough to make it worth 31 so I usually stick with a regular, and if I'm really hungry I'll order a large. \n\nThe quality of the Kobe beef meat is top notch.

Sauce is better\n2. Broth is better (spicy miso...for life)\n3. Beef is better (more tender, huge portion)\n4. Inside is clean, environment is inviting, and service is awesome\n5. To avoid the 1+ hour wait, MAKE A RESERVATION. Even when you're a little late, they're still accommodating.\n6. Huge portion of veggies\n\nThe plate of beef for $20 is enough for me.  I am delightfully full afterwards and the green tea ice cream is literally icing on the cake.\n\nAn addiction I don't plan to kick any time soon.", "author": "Adele Z."}

I don't know if that's sad or not because there's a lot of fancy nice places to eat in San Francisco.. Anyway, the reason why I like this place so much is because the Kobe beef is soooo tender. I've eaten a lot of hot pot in my life and they're all good..\n\nBut trust me, the meat here is the highest quality! I've always gotten the spicy miso soup which is just the right amount of salty and spicy. Although maybe I can be adventurous and try the chicken soup..hehehe. They give you a lot of veggies and that delicious udon noodles with rice. I usually substitute the rice with..more udon noodles! And the waitresses there are pretty nice and do so with no questions asked. Some places will place a surcharge because I guess noodles are more expensive than rice. -_- *grumble grumble*\n\nAnyway the only gripes I have about shabu house would be... It's kinda expensive.. Maybe not for a shabu place in sf, but definitely compared to other places *cough LA cough cough*. It's a price I'm willing to pay though because the beef is thaaaat good. No other places can compare meat wise. Another thing I wish they had are glass noodles. I love glass noodles in my hot pot!!! I would prefer them over the udon noodles they give you..even though the udon is delicious too. \n\nOh yea they have all you can eat here! Which I've done once..sooo good. I wanna do ayce again! Hehe. And they give you some ice cream (green tea or red bean) as dessert if you're not already stuffed by all the hot pot.

If we had came at a later time, we would have waited much longer since this place isnt big. Of course we got the ayce option when we got seated to our table which cost about $35 per person, thats if you dont get any drinks. Got the spicy miso broth. And got couple rounds of lamb and beef and vegetables. Whenever i come, their foods were always good but it was only  alright when i came few days ago. But the broth usually always have flavor from the meat and vegetables. The ice cream always give a nice touch after the end of your meal.

For $10 more you can also do the AYCD option. It was really tempting but I opted out for that because I rather be filling myself up with meat!\n\nI'm from out of town and AYCE shabu doesn't exist where I'm from. I'm used to only having several slices of meat but that's not the case here. Meat heaven. There's three types of meat choices. American Style Kobe Beef, American Kurobuta Pork, and Lamb. My favorite is the beef. The quality of the beef was great. It has good marbling with not too much fat. The lamb comes in second with the last place going to the pork. The portion sizes are very big too. I took me a while to plow through each plate of meat. Good job for them, I didn't have to bother them for refills.\n\nThere are three broth options, Traditional Water, Spicy Miso, or Ginger Chicken Broth. The spicy miso was my favorite. The goma sauce was lacking for me. Not the best I had maybe just average. The ponzu was fine, you can't really mess that up.\n\nThe service was not that great at all here. I received my food but had not even got my drinks. I really had to wave them down. Once you do get their attention, they're pretty quick about getting refills on meats and veggies. The wait here was pretty long but luckily I had made reservation and I also came before the crowd really picked up. \n\nOverall, come hungry for the AYCE but you would probably be pretty satisfied with the regular or large. I barely ate the veggies and rice with the AYCE option and I was stuffed.", "author": "Michael C."}

I've been to the Shabu house in Burlingame and it is a much bigger location. This place has a bar that seats 4 and about 10 tables. I can imagine waiting a long time if you come here for the AYCE because you have a limit of 2 hours. I'm sure most people will get full before the 2 hour limit but incase everyone intended to stay the whole time, you will likely be waiting a while for a table. By the way, the AYCE is well worth the money. \n\nMy girl and I had the Spicy Miso soup. It can tend to lose flavor after a while but still probably the best flavored soup. You get a choice of 3 different meats: beef, pork and lamb. All three of the meats were good. The beef was marbled and left a buttery taste. It was really good. You can also order rice, vegetables, udon, tofu, and mushrooms. They also offer vegetarian style Shabu. \n\nThe only drawback here is a full stomach and long wait times.

Me and my friends just came from a strenuous work out, but some of the lightweights weren't up for paying 30 bucks for all you can eat. If you want all you can eat, everyone in your party must order it.\n\nMe and my friend are both big eaters, but we settled for just a large plate of the kobe beef. We were skeptical of our order filling us up, but we were sure surprised by the end of the meal. We took our time eating, spacing out each bite of meet between bites of veggies. Our side of the table got rice since we are no carb conscious. You gotta have rice with meat, they compliment each other so well.\n\nYou get 3 choices of broth to dip your meat and veggies in. Traditional water (sounds like hetch hetchy water to me), chicken ginger broth, and spicy miso. We were afraid the first two would not impart our meat with enough flavor so we picked the latter. Some might go with the traditional water to preserve the pure flavor of meat, but flavored broth is good to drink on its own or to drizzle on rice.\n\nThe veggies were clean and looked good, but it would have been nice to get something a little fancier. Napa cabbage is pretty much cheap filler, but tastes good nonetheless. The udon is good and goes well with everything.\n\nWith your meal, there are two dipping sauces. One is a vinegary soy sauce and the other was a sesame seed sauce (imagine peanut butter but with sesame). \n\nAt the very end, you get your choice of green tea or red bean ice cream. Both were good, everyone has their own preference so pick what you feel like.\n\nI would like to try their all you can eat/drink meal next time, but if you want to save money, you will be happy with a single order of meat. You will just need to pace your time and let everything set in.", "author": "David C."}

It was actually a cool, breezy afternoon during lunchtime and, never having tried their original Geary Blvd. location, this was my lunch choice. The restaurant configuration, modernly designed, is interesting as there is no greeting area and the cashier's area is about halfway inside the restaurant.  Noticing that most of the main dining room tables were occupied on a Friday, we chose to sit by the entrance, a wise choice since there was a particularly boisterous (read LOUD) diner already eating there; it is also a lot brighter in front during the day.\nChoosing the spicy miso soup base (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buv-wKDpSL6Iy4_PM1LyMw?select=96xqzeCkWgtqEcvnx6EcgQ), I ordered the large Combination Lamb and Kobe Beef (ten and seven thinly sliced pieces respectively) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buv-wKDpSL6Iy4_PM1LyMw?select=Niy1lMbyNebgaQ1wnYa4rA) on the lunch menu ($14.49); it included one plate of the mentioned meats and another one comprising of Napa cabbage, cubed firm tofu, spinach, two baby carrots, one fresh shiitake mushroom, and a handful of udon noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buv-wKDpSL6Iy4_PM1LyMw?select=gCAUw6KMrifbd-2cEP9qZA); I accepted their optional bowl of white rice too.  Then comes the swoosh swooshing, the accompanying sound one makes in wading those meats in the bubbling broth, before flavoring them further with your premixed soy vinegar dipping sauce (mashed garlic, scallions, and reddish ponzu condiment jars to mix in) or peanut sauce.  After this hearty meal, I topped it off with a complimentary scoop of red bean ice cream (green tea ice cream is the other option).\nThe restaurant is kept very clean, not an easy feat given that the cooking is done in the dining room.  The wait staff were friendly and regularly checked to make sure our needs were met.  How did I like my meal?  The five stars say it all, as well as another two trips in the ensuing two weeks.

The line out the door is indicative of what you'll find here, so be a good adult; make a reservation and arrive on time! \n\nLike me. With a reservation on the books and in the door by 6pm, I was in full popular restaurant mode. Sadly, the rest of my party was not. Having underestimated Golden Gate traffic by approximately 40 minutes, I was absorbing high-octane stink-eye glances and vulture-like expressions from the poor saps waiting at the door. After 10 minutes, myself (and the staff) couldn't take it any longer, so I sacrificed the two empty seats next to me at the bar. That said, the staff was super accommodating despite the absence of my party. I was offered drinks and appetizers, and I was able to keep my seat at the bar. It was a fantastic aspect of their customer service that I really appreciated. \n\nAfter my stragglers arrived, we were offered a table quick-smart. The food was excellent - obviously fresh and prepared with care. I had never tried Shabu before, so a short instruction would have been appreciated, but I guess the idea is simple enough! Along with the meat, you receive a heaping platter of veggies, tofu, and noodles. Something about having the raw ingredients in front of you, and just nuking them in broth for a few seconds makes for a fresh, straight up \"real food\" meal. You know exactly what you're eating, and it feels good. \n\nHere's to more Shabu adventures!", "author": "Chelsea B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-29", "description": "Having this place so close to where I live has been such a waste. I've known about it forever now, but never gave it a shot. First, I just never craved shabu or any sort of hot pot. And second, I never realized how misguided I was in thinking that shabu just wasn't my thing. My experience at Shabu House flipped my world upside down on that one!\n\nWe came here on a Friday night at around 630pm-ish on recommendation from a friend who, at one point, got Shabu House once every week for like 5 weeks. I trusted her as a hot pot guru and still kind of hesitantly agreed to go as my other friend wanted to try. I'm really glad we did though! It was just so good/fun!\n\nThe spot was pretty bumpin', and as a party of 2, we were able to snag the last table in the house. Lucky! There's a decent amount of seating, but it fills up quick! So be aware! There are multiple locations too, but the Ocean one was most convenient for us. Just a testament to how popular Shabu House is around here. We were not disappointed!\n\nThere were a good amount of options here for all-you-can-eat, we didn't really think of doing anything else. We went with the $31/person all-you-can-eat option. If we were trying to get our drank on, for $42/person, they offer all-you-can-drink too, which I think would've been a sweet deal! Maybe next time.\n\nSpicy Miso broth is what we decided on. Shabu House doesn't have those pots with the dividers (like at Little Sheep Hot Pot), so we couldn't do a half regular, half spicy broth kinda thing just to try the other broths. We both like spicy, so that wasn't much of a downer. Broth was great! Not too spicy of a base, but you can throw in chili flakes/oil to your heart's content if you're into that! \n\nAs for the meats/vegetables, they have pork, beef, and lamb. I was the biggest fan of the beef, I thought it as nice and juice/fatty the way I like it and I just could not stop eating. However, it depends on the cut you get, as the first round we had was the best. The follow up plates were more lean (not a bad thing), but still very delicious. The lamb and pork was also tasty, but it probably boils (haha) down to personal preference on that one! As for the plates of veggies (spinach, mushrooms, tofu, other hotpot veggie essentials, etc.), they were kind of what you expect when it comes to Shabu (I would think).\n\nDipping sauces. I was in love with the peanut-y sauce they have. I thought it went really well with the beef and all the other meats. It was wonderful. They also had a soy sauce/vinegar kind of dipping sauce that was nice too! \n\nShabu House was great, it brings a fun vibe and isn't too bad in terms of price for all-you-can-eat! I like the individual pots at each table and attentive waitresses there too! Oh, and they give you a choice of red bean/green tea ice cream to end your meal. We both went with green tea and it was a nice touch! Definitely recommend Shabu House for great hot pot in SF!", "author": "Jason T."}

Three stars for the food but no more due to the experience. \n\nThe most recent visit, there were three of us. It was pretty busy and when they called our names to be seated, they told us we were going to be seated at a two-seater even thought there were three of us (1 man and 2 women). I asked if this was our only option and they said yes. So would they not serve us if we asked for a larger table? That seems to have been the implication even though we waited over an hour for a table. The other female and I sat on the cushioned side of the table; good thing we are moderately small. The technique of getting food from the hot pot was a bit of a game if arm \"twister\" though. It also wasn't nice that the ac above one of the seats kept driving water. \n\nWe ordered a large beef to share. Later we ordered a second plate. We were not aware that there is a splitting fee of $5 a person and the waitress did not educate us on their rules until our second round. We've been here plenty if times but never knew this rule. Since there were three of us, we we're suppose to order three plates. I am currently pregnant in my first trimester and unable to eat full meals still because of regularly getting sick. Shabu sits well with my stomach but I don't eat a full adult portion size. It was so disappointing to find out we would be charged extra just because I decided to come out to dinner and didn't want a plate of my own. How do they manage having families with children dine in? We could have just ordered three regulars instead and had more veggies!!!\n\nThe waitresses were nice but the experience was not fun. I would suggest that there be a better plan for when three people decide to dine together as well as better communication from the waitresses when extra fees are included in style of dining. \n\nAdvice: If you want to come on a busy night, apparently they accept reservations.", "author": "Andy M."}

Only thing during my visit was that the wait staff was quite young and I thought they could have been a bit more professional with how they acted in the restaurant/presented themselves to customers.

I've been a loving patron of the Geary location for a while because simply put, their sauces are so on point and their ayce is fantastic quality at an excellent price. Other places will have beef that literally disintegrates upon cooking, slices that are too thin, or freezer burned/old beef BUT NOT HERE! Seriously, gotta get the beef plate.\n\nI'm so happy that my little sister introduced me to this location, which is both newer than the Geary store AND less crowded.

Came here last week for happy hour and ordered the all you can eat because it's shabu, it's the only way to go. It makes absolutely no sense to just get one large plate and veggies..........or so I thought. The meat came out in a huge plate and there were like 40 pieces in a plate. It took me forever just to finish that one plate and I thought I was going to give up but my pride wouldn't let me just tap out so I ordered another plate. The second plate was just equally as big. \"Why did I just do that? I'm so stupid\". I thought to myself. Once again it took me forever just to kill that one plate and then the waitress came by and asked \"more meat\"?. I was so full and I couldn't possibly eat another piece of meat let alone an entire plate so I looked up at the waitress and said \"yes please\".  What is wrong with me?!? I was so full that I literally confused myself and stupidly ordered another plate. I killed the 3rd plate with ease actually so it wasn't too bad.\n\nThe meat is great quality, one of the best meat I've had eating Shabu. The broth was OK and just had enough flavor but people just dip their meat into their sauce anyways so it didn't matter. The sauce was normal, just like any other shabu place. I also loved the decor of the place. It looks welcoming and they stuck to a theme which was really nice. Will definitely come back here .", "author": "Will C."}

(Friday night)\n\nA combination of the patrons, service, price and food quantity and quality (or lack of) leaves more to be desired.\n\nThis place caters to the younger folks (college kids or ragers who like happy hour/alcohol) so it is very loud. With that said, we placed our names on the waiting list and sat patiently for about 30 minutes. No worries here.  The wait and crowd gave me the impression that this place was pretty good. \n\nThey seated us next to a couple. The girlfriend was mugging me the whole time while the guy was mad-dogging my roommate. We were like, wth? Oh well, kids.....you know how they get when you plow them with some alcohol.\n\nIn reviewing the menu, I saw there were numbers by the portions.  I thought it denoted ounces but it turned out to be number of pieces. Instantly, I was skeptical thinking \"It doesn't say how large the pieces are.\" We both ordered the large.\n\nMy roommate wanted the spicy miso broth but I wanted the traditional kombu. Since they don't do 50/50, we settled on the kombu. Also, the kombu will allow us to taste the food where the miso will mask any issues.\n\nThe meat was OK, not kobe-level good, and expensive.  Shabu Way Angus (their cheapest cut) was waaaaay better than SH's Kobe (which is their entry level cut). Their veggie portions are tiny too.\n\nImagine our disappointment with the food while the table next to us was staring us down the entire time. We would have moved tables but we couldn't get the waitress' to unfocus her attention from the party table of drunk guys (and one girl) five feet away. Oh boy. SOB. FSOB. Damn. I had to get up and stand in front of our waitress to pay the bill!! If they didn't want us to pay, they should have told us so.\n\nAll in all, we paid about $50 for dinner without alcohol or accompaniments and got Jack-in-the-Box on the way home.", "author": "Chibi F."}

When we get there, our table with ice water, dipping sauces, and all the utensil settings were ready and waiting for us.  That impressed me.  Haven't came across too many restaurants recently still doing that.\n\nWe started our meal with ample portion of veggies, lot of tofu, mushrooms and udon (round rice noodle).  Our initial meal order was 2 orders of beef, 1 order of pork and half an order of lamb.  It was a nice start.  The meats took a while to come but they were thinly sliced and delicious.\n\nWords of caution, the art of eating Shabu is that only cook the amount of meat that you are going to eat immediately. I only cook one piece of meat at a time. They get cooked fast, within seconds.  Don't over cook for best tasting.\n\nAmong the dipping sauces, both the sesame and the ponzu (light soy sauce and vinegar like) were great, easy in adding the minced garlic which was very powerful and the odor/taste lingered.\n\nMy favorite broth was the ginger chicken in comparing to the spicy miso.   We ordered both in a split pot which was a good idea so we can sample both.\n\nThe only other suggestion that I have is that if you are in a hurry, order your additional meats in advance because they come relatively slow compare to others.\n\nThe Red Bean Ice Cream which came with the All You Can Eat is a pleasant delight.\n\nOverall, the whole \"Shabu\" experience was great and satisfying.

As far as I'm aware, the best way to do it is mix a dollop of peanut sauce and a dash of the sweet soy stuff into a small bowl of the broth, and then transfer the cooked veggies and meat into that bowl before eating them. Despite sharing an entree (the large is a lot of food, so I'm not sure if they really expect one person to eat it all) they gave us each a bowl of rice and a scoop of ice cream to finish off the meal! We almost turned the ice cream down because we were so full, but the waitress pointed out that it's included/free so we tried it - one scoop red bean flavor, one scoop green tea. They were both interesting to try, but not my favorite.\n\nWe were seated quickly after arriving at 5:30, and by the time we left at 6:30 it was packed with a big line, so like anywhere good, definitely come early if you don't want to wait!\n\nGood service, great food, good prices, great experience.", "author": "Chris M."}

This place pretty big and seems to be more spacious, and they have lots of tables for large groups. \n\nOf all the Shabu places I've tried so far, I think Shabu House gives you the most food and highest quality for your money. Also, the waitress told me that they're happy to switch out certain things (say, if you don't like cabbage but want more spinach), which I never would have thought to ask for. It was very sweet of her to notice our preferences and make recommendations for next time.\n\nI highly recommend that spicy miso broth and kobe beef. Also, the green tea ice cream is really delicious! Overall, great food, great staff, but it was pretty busy even on a Thursday so be prepared for a wait!", "author": "Rachel A."}

I normally go to the location in Burlingame but I decided to give this new location a chance.  Wow, this place is tiny.  It's smaller than my garage.  In fact, it's probably smaller than a one car garage.  I went with a party of six and we called ahead of time but the lady on the phone said that reservations were booked but they were still taking walk-ins.  She informed us that the our best bet was to come around 8 because there would be no wait around that time.  So my group took her advice, stayed in the house a bit longer and played Dance Central 2 like sober squares on a Friday night, because that's how I roll!  \n\n8PM comes and we all head out to the spot.  It was pretty packed, we signed our name and was told it was going to be a 30 minute wait.  \n\n...2 hours later, we were seated.  You are reading this and probably thinking, why wait two hours?  You should have gone somewhere else.  Well, the birthday girl has been talking about trying this new location all week and we didn't want to ruin her birthday dinner.  Plus, if you know this location, you know that there aren't any good restaurants close by.  The closest worthy restaurant is probably a 10 minute drive down super busy 19th avenue.  We all know that traffic down 19th is a pain.\n\nAll in all the food is the same as the Burlingame location (obviously).  The service was amazing.  The manager was nice enough to give us 2 free appetizers for our long wait.  Most of us were blasted by the time we left since all my group did was take sake shots during out 2 hour wait.  By the time it was time to eat, one person in our group was already falling asleep like an embarrassing slob in the middle of eating.  DAVID, I'm calling you out!\n\nHonestly, I prefer driving to Burlingame, it's worth the drive.  There's no wait and it is a lot bigger.  I'll probably go here after shopping at Stonestown if the wait isn't that bad.  \n\n\nOh yeah, if you haven't tried Shabu House before.  Order the regular kobe with spicy miso broth.

It wasn't really appetizing eating so much fat so I stopped there but needless to say, the more plates that you order, the amount of fat in the slices also increases. Maybe it's just me but the quality of the meat here is worse than the other ones, maybe it was because the slices were on the thicker side due to how it was cut.

That is until I went to Shabu House! The first time I shabu-ed (?d) was at Shabuway in San Mateo and I left hungry because I lost my veggies, meat, and noodles in the pot. The result? Overcooked everything! At that point, I was like \"never again!\" My friend wanted to go to Shabu House and she promised to teach me, so I agreed. Parking wasn't difficult at all! My friend was able to find a spot right in front of Shabu House and I was able to find one on the opposite side. Downside? It's metered before 6pm and the meter maids check that area often so be careful.\n\nImmediately upon entering, I was somewhat confused because there is no hostess to greet you. I noticed how close the seats tables were to each other which could potentially make you uncomfortable if you don't like listening to other people's conversations. My friend and I ordered the regular and large Kobe Beef with the diluted spicy broth as suggested by the waitress. My friend ordered extra udon noodles, too.\n\nThe regular kobe beef was perfect for me since I don't like to eat a lot however, if you have a large appetite, I recommend going for the large Kobe beef plate. The vegetable plate comes with mushrooms, mushroom shoots, lettuce, spinach, and udon noodles. It also came with your choice of green tea or red bean ice cream, which was nice. After finally learning how to shabu, I want to go back again! The total for two people was $40 something which is a little pricy for dinner, but it's nice to indulge once in a while. My only complaint, other than the seating, is that the waitresses never refilled our cups for water and the wait for our bill took FOREVER. Although it was clear that we were finished, I asked where we should pay and they told us to \"just leave it there\" I told them that we were paying with debit card and they finally took our bill, which was a bit of a hassle.

Wanted to take the gf to some shabu shabu since she was craving it.   Overall it wasn't bad but not great either. \n\nService:  Pretty good, the waitresses were very attentive and polite.  I really liked how quick they were to serve us when needed as well. 5 stars\n\nQuality:  I think this is where you have to decide for yourself quantity vs quality.  I'll admit they give a lot of veggies and meat, but I've definitely had better quality meat at other shabu shabu places.  But hey, if you think meat tastes like meat then this might be great for you!  Couple things I did have an issue with hence why I think this place is just alright:  the broth and sauce.  The broth was lackluster (we had the spicy miso).  It was really watered down and I could hardly taste miso.  I think the worst item was the sauce.  We were given 2 sauces; a ponzu type and a sesame/miso (which I never use no matter where I go).  Now what I love about ponzu is that great citrus taste you get.  However, I could tell that they used vinegar instead, which I think is disappointing.  2 stars\n\nPrice: We ordered the AYCE for $31.  Looking back, I think we should have ordered a large order ($20) instead.  I was really forcing myself to eat which was pretty gross.  Unless you're really hungry and up for it, I would suggest just getting a large plate.  Overall most shabu shabu places are essentially the same price. 3 stars\n\nOverall, I would say this is a place where if you're really hungry then its great.  If you're looking for some great tasting shabu shabu then maybe you should try somewhere else.  Oh and I forgot to mention, one thing that I was also disappointed with was that we had to share a burner, which meant we couldn't have ordered separate broths.

I like the adzuki better, though.\n\nThe agedashi tofu was more than good with a delicately light coating on five cubes of soft silken tofu snowed in with a decent amount of bonito flakes and nori strips. Was it worth it for approximately $1.10 per cube? Maybe not every time but the flavor surely delivered.\n\nThe place gets packed (as any of their branches) even before 6:30 so try to get there early. They only take reservation of party of four and more. Noise level can get on some people's nerves but remember that you eat here for the food not for the ambiance.\nAll in all, good value for money.

Mind you, it's not true \"kobe\" beef and can barely qualify for American Kobe beef. The first two plates of beef were pretty good, but when we got the third plate, it was fairly tough and seemingly hard. The meat might not have been as well marbled and I don't know if it was coincidence that our third order came out this way or if they started bringing out the cheap stuff as we ate more. The lamb and pork are nothing to complain about, but I'd definitely go lamb over pork any day.\n\nThe vegetables are vegetables, you can't go wrong there. \n\nThe service was pretty good and the waitresses were very attentive.

There meat is pretty good. It it sliced thin and has nice marbling. Sometimes though it might need a little bit more defrosting. The main reason why I come here is because of there sesame sauce which they make in house. They grind there own sesame and it's so good. I always tell them to give me a lot a of sesame sauce and I can just eat that all day with rice. I've been to many other Shabu restaurants and there sesame sauce is never as good. There spicy miso broth is also very delicious. It's not too spicy or mild. Service can be spotty sometimes. I would have to ask them to refill my water or give me more rice.

The Burlingame location is huge and the Geary location has the benefit of the upstairs room and a larger bar. Speaking of the bar, it's extra small at this location, seats maybe 4? The rest are tables. Now I always prefer bar seating at Shabu house since that means I don't need to share a pot with my fellow guest and easier access to my waitress should I need something, so if you're like me, this may be an issue.\n\nOther than that, same old good Shabu, just a different location.", "author": "Peter W."}

My mother and I were guests of my brother and my dear sister-in-law.  We decided to go with the \"all you can eat meat\" option ($31/person). The concept is not meant for someone who cannot finish at least four plates of meat.  Note that if one orders all you can eat, each member in the party is required to do the same, even if one's appetite is not all there. \n\nThe non meat platter contained a sampling of spinach, cabbage, enoki mushrooms, flower mushrooms, cubed tofu and udon noodles (my favorite).  I would have asked for a second plate, but that was not what I was there for.  This platter along with a half plate of meat was enough for my 87 year old mother.\n\nThe choice of meats, thinly sliced (for ease of cooking), included high grade beef, lamb and pork.  The meat was excellent.  Needless to say, this is where I made up for the price.  I had four and a half plates of meat (I ate the portion of beef my mother could not finish).  If I had been my son's age the plate count would have been doubled (possibly more).\n\nOne had to ask for rice, but again, that wasn't what I was there for.  \n\nAt the end, right before I ordered the last plate of meat (because I had a last minute yearning for the second plate of lamb), I was served a scoop of red bean ice cream - great way to end the meal.  I wanted to ask where I could get a gallon of the stuff, but afterall I do have to watch my weight.....[uh huh].\n\nIf you want good service, go early.....no waiting and the staff is gracious and rearing to serve up a great meal.  Order the all you can eat only if you are hungry.  I'd say the price should have been no more than $20 or $25 for the meat option and $15 for the vegetable option.....Afterall, this is not a Brazilian Steak House.", "author": "Glenn N."}

Like there are tons of open tables that could seat four.  But we took the table thinking it was a bit strange.  As a few more people arrived around 6 we heard her say, sorry those tables are reserved, that was more than half the tables in the restaurant.  By the time we left, around 7:00 ish, the whole place was packed and there were four to a table for two.  There was about 6 other people waiting for a table.  Next time we'll make reservations for sure.  \n\nThe price was reasonable, with the Shabu Shabu, we ordered 2 large beef, but since the waitress didn't bring a ordering pad with her or paper, she brought us two regular size.  They already came with veggies, so there really isn't any need to order additional veggies.  I also got a Tempura Soft Shell Crab Salad, that was ok, but the crab wasn't very big and there was tons of vinegar dressing on the bottom which wilted some of the salad on the very bottom.\n\nThis is a fun place to come eat, but keep in mind, you're all sharing the same soup pot.

I tried the Shabu House on Geary and it was pretty good so I decided to give this one on Ocean a chance.  Location is new, and the furnishing is clean and tidy.\n\nFor Shabu, the most important things are the quality of the meat and the dipping sauces.  On both of these accounts, places like Mums and Shabuway are superior.  The \"American Kobe\" was well marbled, and decent, the meat was frozen pretty stiff and came to the table that way.  The sesame/peanut sauce is a bit dry and hard.  The dashi/soy-based sauce was too salty.  I had the chicken stock as a soup base and it was a bit bland.  Nothing came together very well.  I was glad that I did not order the \"all-you-can-eat\" as it didn't taste good enough for me to eat beyond the first plate.\n\nThe waitress packs the rice down super hard so instead of fluffy grains of rice, you get this hard mass of starch which cannot be separated easily.  Waitress was not rude, but was in a bit of a rush and did not dispense with any pleasantries.  Service was much better elsewhere, such as Mum's.  Shabuway usually is pretty busy and the service is not that great either, but I would rank my experience here at this particular Shabu House lower.  \n\nOverall, this place is \"ok\" but all of the other Shabu places I've tried are better.  I would probably not come back to this location again unless a buddy specifically requests it for some reason.  Stick with Mum's over at Japantowns or Shabuway down the penninsula.

The plates of meat are fresh, not frozen, and they're easy to pick up and don't clump together like many other similar places. I feel this is a five star restaurant but it just has slow service. Every single plate of meat, vegetable, water and broth refill had to be requested twice. The waitresses are so quick to move around and don't take their time to notice the empty plates and cups.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-23", "description": "This is the best shabu place in the area. I come here almost every other week on average for the past 6 months. I think being a regular here might be why I don't seem to get the same reviews as the ones posted previously though, I have encountered some occasions where the meat and service wasn't completely up to par.\n\nThe spicy miso soup base is really what makes this place exceptional. I've tried Shabuway and G-Cube before and no spicy miso soup is as flavorful and tasty as Shabu House. You don't even need to cook the meat in the broth and the soup is good. My friend and I sometimes just drink it while it boils. Most places are bland and taste close to water before you add in the flavors of the meat. ShabuWay's tasted like water and chilli peppers. I do not recall any miso flavor in the soup.\n\nThe meat has its inconsistencies, especially if you order AYCE. Sometimes the meat is not as good as the first round. (Less fatty or the cut is not as good.) There were times where I think my meat was sliced near the bone and there were small strips of bone in it. I just pick it out and continue eating. Sometimes, the meat can be a little frozen. For the most part though, the meat is still fresh and tender. The more marble looking it is, the better it is.\n\nI also really like their side of veggies. It offers way more veggies and sides than ShabuWay and G-Cube. (G Cube probably had like three pieces of spinach and four pieces of cabbage.) They are also flexible with their side dishe if you ask nicely... e.g. replace everything with just enoki mushrooms or only cabbage instead of spinach.)\n\nService is excellent at this place in my opinion. I can see why a lot of people do not like the service but most of the time, they are busy. The waitresses usually recognize me and when they find out I don't have a reservation and it is a busy night, they always ask why I don't call them to make a reservation. Once, they didn't charge us for the three beers we drank while we were waiting. (Of course I ended up tipping 25%.) Another time they gave us free sodas. They never offer or tell me (probably because they don't want other people to know, but we receive our bill without it. They have also asked a party of two to move over to a smaller table so it would open up a bigger table for my party of four. They are slow sometimes and they might not catch your attention but most of the times, I see the girls running around the restaurant trying to tend to people. The restaurant is also awkwardly shaped like a hallway so sometimes, it is easy for them to neglect the booths on the outside while they tend to the tables in the inside. \n\nOverall, I love this place. I keep coming back and I am still not tired from eating there after 6 months. My go-to pick is the Kobe Beef set!", "author": "Jenny L."}

WHAT?!  how can you mess that up.  he called and they said they would refund it but after a week he still didnt see the money.  he checked in like any normal person who isnt rich and the manager again was horribly rude and wasnt the least bit understanding.  she said she did the refund and now it was no longer her problem?  really?  \n\nsense then when ever we go in is the manager is working we get incredibly poor service, almost like she tells who ever is helping us to treat us unfairly.  we never get waters, we always have to grab the waitresses for help instead of them checking on us, and once the manager even tried at all cost not to sit us a 4 person table even though it was slow because of the disagrement we had.  she eventually did anyway.  \n\nlong story short; good food, ok service sometime...
