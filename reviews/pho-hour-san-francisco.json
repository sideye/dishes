Stopped in for some pho and would say the flavor is some of the best I've had in SF! \n\nI'm a regular for #32 pho w/beef flank and an order of imperial/egg rolls. There can be some variation on flavor and quality/cut/thickness of meat, but overall its pretty solid. In particular, the cut of flank is pretty tender, has some tendon, and the soup has a really good flavor to it. \n\nThe place is a bit of a hole in the wall, and everything is pretty dated. Service can be hit or miss since there are only two people that can take your order. Sometimes I come on Saturday at opening, and have to sit there for 15-20 min because owners are stuck in traffic and running late. When they do arrive tho, they are very attentive and quick to get food out. Overall I'm a fan, and I've been hitting this place up weekly!", "author": "James S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-11", "description": "On 3/30/2018 while I was arrived in the city of San Francisco, CA, I headed to this local Vietnamese restaurant right at the South of Market neighborhood called, \"Pho Hour.\" Formerly named as \"Sunrise Cafe,\" Pho Hour serves the customers of all ages to taste their authentic Vietnamese cuisines every year from pho to banh mi right at your comfort zone. The atmosphere is much active and ongoing as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to your local cafe in the U.S. although it's much spacious and wide filled with basic designs and classic 20th Century flare across the whole interior room.\n\nThe employees here from servers, counters and cookers are doing a great job for making the customers like me a tremendous service during in a busier lunch hour environment. No cons.\n\nNow onto the food! I ordered one of my favorite Vietnamese cuisines called, \"Pho Tai\" aka Rare Steak Vermicelli Noodle Soup. As I ate it, that pho tasted very good! The broth was perfectly rich and bold thanks to the aroma of spices and seasonings. The rest of the toppings from onions, scallions, and rare steak were perfectly fresh and elegant which I'm very enjoying it. The steak did boiled and cooked perfectly on a hot broth and it was perfectly eatable to chew my teeth properly. Not a bad pho at all on a lunch break in SF.\n\nParking at Pho Hour can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Pho Hour is a fine and well maintained local Vietnamese restaurant that I've ever discovered for the first time in San Francisco. Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering. Well visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

Certainly not because the place looked like a culinary hotbed for audaciously prepared poultry. It looked more like a courthouse lunchroom furnished with overstock from the Office Depot (photo: http://bit.ly/2r7KnKx).

It was slightly oily and had a good beefy flavor along with other spices. The meats were plentiful, flavorful and tender.  Minor ding for slightly overcooked noodles.  \n\nWhile the pho are \"typically priced\" at $7-8, the banh mi are in the $4-5 range. I got a Banh Mi Thit Nuong (grilled pork, $4.50) to-go to see what you get for almost double what you can find at places like Saigon Sandwich.\n\nThis was not your usual crispy toasted baguette, but other than that things looked on the up & up with the meat, pickled diakon and carrots, slices of cucumber and jalepeno, and a smear of mayo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunrise-cafe-san-francisco-2?select=N2CWJNOgGJditNujmKrEzw#N2CWJNOgGJditNujmKrEzw)\n\nThere was plenty of tender, lean pork and mostly carrots. Definitely more fillings than your typical $2.50 banh mi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunrise-cafe-san-francisco-2?select=N2CWJNOgGJditNujmKrEzw#Pf-ubggBFwIi-fxJMRNuhA). The roll wasn't doing it for me. It was dense and chewy and got in the way of my banh mi enjoyment.

They were deep fried and the wrapping bubbled up like pork rinds.  They were chewy and crunchy at the same time, pretty sure there was left over crud in the deep fryer that stuck to my rolls.

Lunch time is sometimes the hour when I get the most work done because everyone else has gone and it's quiet.  \n\nOne day last week, I managed to take a full hour for lunch.  That's an incredible feat!  It's as if the planets lined up.  Anyways.  It was not too warm and Erica came with me.  We walked the few blocks to this location, talking about boys the whole time.    It was worth the few minutes of walking, the day was fine, and I was in a good mood.\n\nThe food here was much better than the place around the corner from work.  The benefit of the place around the corner is that it's literally around the corner.  But when you walk just a few blocks away, this food is much better.  It's the same price and it doesn't cost another dollar to add the egg roll.  This bun came with 2 egg rolls.  Erica and I shared the chicken bun.  The chicken was juicy and tender and flavorful.  The serving was huge.  Heaping mound.  \n\nThe sh*t thing was that the waitress bringing me my food dripped the fish sauce on my new ivory jacket.

At $6-7, I can afford to eat here regularly during my lunch hour. Unfortunately, I have to give their sandwiches and Vietnamese coffee ***. Thus, the 4 star average. Pass on the coffee, and you'll have a 5 star lunch.", "author": "margie c."}

The choices were very limited but everything was pretty good, expecially their BBQ items. Their Pho was prety good also.  As for the prices, it's actually not that expensive compared to the Tenderloin district, which I am very surprised about.  I thought it would be much more expensive being out in the middle of nowhere.  I would prefer to come here instead of Tenderloin becuase it's much easier to find parking here.", "author": "Raymond Y."}

Let me preface my review by saying I work near Sunrise Cafe, and it's proximity to my workplace is the only reason I continue to go there. I can't comment on any of the meat dishes as I am vegetarian, but the salads I've had there have been decent. You can order almost anything you want there as there is an Asian menu packed with various Pho options, and an American menu featuring dishes like hamburgers and sandwiches. Although I've never eaten in Sunrise Cafe, the dining area is relatively large so you're not sitting on a stranger's lap like other places. The service has always been fast, even when I popped in instead of pre-ordering by phone. The little man who seems to always be working is very pleasant and makes me feel appreciated for my business. In that area of SOMA, there are relatively few options, so I will continue to frequent Sunrise Cafe until something better comes along.", "author": "Breanna L."}
