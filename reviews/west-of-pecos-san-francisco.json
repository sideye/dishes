The food is always superb and the employees are attentive and knowledgeable. I generally sit at the bar and Martine and Pedro are super kind! Coming from someone who works in the industry, I really value quality customer service. Lately I've been opting for the cushioned booths in the bar area. So this review is based mainly on our server Johnny.. he was sweet and made our experience so much better.... if that's even possible.\n\nNormally I order the queso but decided to branch out this time. My friend and I ended up ordering the flautas and the Mac n cheese. We weren't too thrilled with the Mac n cheese, it happened to be a little too sweet for our liking. We told our server and he offered to exchange it for something else. We ended up doubling down on the flautas because of how yummy they were. PLEASE ORDER THESE IF YOU COME HERE!!! \n\nOverall:\nMajor thanks to Johnny for making our experience one of the best we've had here (try to sit in his section) and order the flautas. If you can't or don't sit in his section, ask for Martine or Pedro at the bar, still 11/10!!\n\nWest of Pecos really does have the best staff and some of the best food. Quality for sure!!", "author": "Alexandra S."}

I was intrigued by what a puffy taco was, and after having tried it, I think I will stick to regular tacos. The flavor profile was good, and the meat and toppings were overflowing to the point that you can't really close the taco -- fork and knife is the best way to eat it (not a bad thing, but FYI).\n\nThe fried chicken and churros was pretty bad IMO. The fried chicken lacked flavor; it's just chicken fried in really bland batter. The churros were lacking -- texture was quite hard. I think this dish was supposed to mimic the concept of fried chicken and waffles, and I personally thought it wasn't a great combination.\n\nI really want to try their dinner menu, but I'm a huge NO on their brunch.", "author": "Lillian T."}

We were put on the waitlist and were told that she would text him when our table is ready. 45 minutes passed, and we were only supposed to wait for 30 minutes. My bf confronted the hostess about this, and she said she texted him, but he didn't respond, so she gave our table away. That's fine if that was the case, but he NEVER received the text!\nHis cell phone service was working just fine, and they had the correct phone number because the automatic texts were sent earlier informing us that they would text us when the table was ready. He was receiving texts from other people and notifications, but he never got the text from the hostess. This was so frustrating, because she KNEW that we were waiting for our table at the bar. She could've briefly stopped by the bar to tell us our table was ready. Instead, she blamed it on him that he didn't get the text because of his cell service (which was clearly NOT the case!). She did not even try to get us the next indoor table immediately, but shrugged it off.\nSince we didn't have our table anymore, we ended up just having dinner at the bar, and it took forever for our food to come out. Because of the whole table fiasco, we ended up not having dinner until 1 hour and 15 minutes after we arrived. \n\nAs for the food...\nBrisket puffy taco: my bf had one and he liked it. (5/5)\n\nDuck puffy taco: it was a bit too sweet for me. The taco shell was already kind of sweet to begin with, but the duck was sweet as well, so the whole thing tasted like a sugar bomb. (2/5)\n\nShrimp fajitas: I really liked this. Such warm and soft flour tortillas, and the skillet was piping hot. Lots of bell peppers, onions, and good amount of shrimp. Comes with a heap of guac and rice and beans. (5/5)\n\nCocktails were pretty good too. We would've had a much better experience if the hostess admitted her mistake and made the effort to fix it. If you come here, make sure you ask about your table to the host or hostess near the end of your supposed wait time (or else you'll just be waiting endlessly for nothing), and hopefully they will seat you right away even if he/she forgets to text you.", "author": "Christina W."}

The drink was hot pink to begin with which was super attractive and pretty. It was literally the most ordered drink in the bar from what I've observed. But the taste was what blew me away the most. Spicy from the serrano peppers yet strong, sweet, and citrusy from the fruit and alcohol. The drink was really good! Besides that, I also ordered the La Flama Verde which is similar to to the prickly pear in that it has a spicy kick! Made with tequila, lime, cucumber, genepy, and jalapeno, the drink was spicy and refreshing. Both margaritas were $12 each. My bf, on the other hand, got two Shot (tequila) and Beer combo for $12 each! sucha steal since a shot is already $11. \n\nAs for food, we tried their guac, mac&cheese, and steak fajitas. The guac ($11) and mac&cheese ($10) were really yummy. Chunky fresh pieces of avocados mixed with tomatoes. I really liked the mixture of tomatoes actually. Gave more flavor to the guac. The mac&cheese is my ultimate favorite of the night. It's probably the best mac and cheese I've ever tried (forreal). SUPER creamy, cheesy, and delicious. The cast iron kept the mac&cheese hot and creamy throughout the whole meal. MUST TRY! the Steak Fajitas ($22), on the other hand, was a total bust. The meat was very tough and hard to chew- tad bit overcooked. I told the server about the hard steak and they accommodated us. Super nice of them, thus the 4 star instead of 3. \n\nOverall, drinks were great, ambiance is nice and cool to look at (they had these dangling lights with chilis!), food was good, and service was so-so. Waited a bit for our waitress to pop up when we were done and ready for the check but she was nowhere to be seen so my bf had to go up to the hostess to ask for it. Don't think we saw her after our food arrived and she checked in on us once. But she was nice when she did take our order and she also recommended me La Flama Verde. \n\nWill definitely return to try the other food and margaritas!", "author": "Anissa D."}

To be honest I don't eat a lot of Tex Mex food but this place was really awesome! We had the infamous puffy tacos and the guacamole and chips which were both awesome. The guacamole and chips was around $11 each and I ordered the BBQ braised beef puffy taco and the crispy carnitas puffy taco ($7 each). The menu has an extensive selection of alcoholic beverages! They have around 6 pages on the menu dedicated to drinks and 2 pages to just good.\n\nI loved the BBQ braised beef one it was so good with some kind of savory mayonnaise sauce and a bit of sliced pickles on top to add some sourness and acidity. The carnitas was also pretty good, but instead of being crispy it kind of felt just touch and not cooked that well, so that one wasn't \"crispy\" but kind of like dry and tough?\n\nIf I didn't have the braised beef taco I probably wouldn't come back, but that taco is so great, it gives me hope that other things are super good. I heard the Queso is good and would love to come back and try it out.\n\nThe service was pretty good, everybody was super polite and the environment is quiet and dim but can get loud sometimes because people are consuming alochol.", "author": "Christopher L."}

The place is decorated with a Tex-Mex sort of atmosphere-- the lights from the ceiling are dangling rows of chiles intertwined with red Christmas lights, there are street signs on the walls, and long wooden tables.\n\nI shared the buttermilk fried chicken. The biggest thing for me about this place is that the chicken came out HOT. Not lukewarm, or pretty hot, but HOT. The skin was crispy but not too thick, salted perfectly, and slightly crumbled when you bit into it. I'm not normally a huge fan of fried chicken, but this really stood out to me. The meat was flavorful and moist. 4.25/5.\n\nThe creamed corn side was delightful. Creamy, perfect comfort food with just the right amount of sweet and salt. 4/5.\n\nThe spinach was garlicky and oiled up without being too overcooked. It's always great when a restaurant includes some veggies that are well cooked! 4/5.\n\nMashed potatoes were fairly standard, but who doesn't love mashed potatoes? 3.5/5.\n--\n\nFriday is cheat day at work, and today was enchilada day! The cilantro cabbage slaw had just the right amount of sour to stimulate the appetite, and was clearly fresh given the crunch. The black beans were fairly standard / not goopy.\n\nI got to check out an assortment of enchiladas (pork, beef, and chicken). The pork enchilada was melt in your mouth tender (almost mashed) on the inside, which I was a fan of since I'm lazy and like baby food-like consistencies. The wrapper was a bit more firm than I would've liked, but I think that is how it is supposed to be.  The chicken had some chicken flavor that was good, same consistency as the pork. Beef, same consistency. \n\nThe churro was a fried crisp, covered in sugar. Heart attack as a stick. I personally like my churros more chewy, but tomato tomahtoh.\n\n3.25/5 on delivery, but I think that's the nature of delivery.", "author": "Nicole H."}

West of Pecos has become a favorite spot of ours since a friend casually introduced me to their happy hour a couple years ago. We've since been back for more HH margaritas, formal dinners, brunches with friends, and most recently a Mother's Day brunch. I can now say with absolute certainty that you cannot go wrong at West of Pecos. The food, drinks, service and vibe are all wonderful, and we'll undoubtedly continue coming here to work our way through the menu. \n\nSome tips for success: Make a reservation if you're coming on a weekday for brunch or on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner. If you have a choice, sit outside in the mornings - they have a heat lamp and small fireplaces outside that will keep you comfortable on a breezy SF morning. In the evening, the tall tables near the bar are a bit more fun than the dining room, depending on the evening you're going for. \n\nGo big: Order anything that looks good, which is everything. The leftovers are great (even day-old soggy churros and chicken), and you'll want to try more than just your entree. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food ($12-$15/entree on avg.). The Chicken & Churros are not to be missed, along with the Guacamole and Sopapillas. \n\nIgnore your 'diet': This is not your kale-salad cafe. This is food that warms your soul, so let your hair down and get that second (or third) margarita. The SF area is suffering a severe drought of Tex-Mex restaurants, so appreciate what you've got! \n\nThis place even gets two thumbs up from my El Paso-raised madre. They even do rice right, which is a big deal. Huge kudos to the guys in the back, who keep this place worth coming back to again and again. \n\nAlready looking forward to our next visit!", "author": "Laura B."}

But frankly West of Pecos let me down.\n\nAMBIENCE: I actually really like the vibe of this place. There are lit up red chili decorations (v southwestern ) and bulls and snakeskin and cowboy figurines and basically any other Texan thing you can imagine.\n\nFOOD: My dining companion and I split the sopapillas with honey to start. It was OK. The sopapillas are very fluffy, but too bready for my liking. I also wish they had made it a savory sopapilla since it's an appetizer.\n\nThe veggie chile relle\u00f1o had fairly high reviews on Yelp, so I gave that a go. The chile itself was slightly bland. It was fried in the same batter as (or at least one similar to) was used for the sopapillas, so that was pretty flavorless. The filling was quite mild compared to the chile relle\u00f1os I've had in other places. The sides were also pretty flavorless, and I didn't particularly like the salsa that came with the chile relle\u00f1o. In summary, not my favorite dish.\n\nMy dining companion got a green chile queso burger. He said it was decent, though it was quite mild for a green chile burger.\n\nOverall I'd say West of Pecos is just average.

The margaritas are fresh though and not a store bought mix, which is always an instant plus in my book. \n\nWe all shared the chips and guac as an appetizer, the guac was chunky and nice, you could tell it was freshly made. They give a decent amount. The chips are thick enough so that your chip won't break when you go to grab guac. I ordered the green chile burger for lunch, it was very very good.

There is ample seating and fun decor. Walked in a Saturday at 6:30pm and got seated right away. Loved the summer squash enchilada which was drenched in sauce, minced tomatoes, and soft garlic pieces. I shared this dish with a friend and we were quickly filled. Flavors were dynamic, cheese in the enchilada was chewy and delicious. Could have used more squash though. Beans were okay (not refried) and rice was okay (dry and lightly flavored). I probably shouldn't have added that to the order (+$3) as I was more than full with my half portion of enchilada. The queso deluxe was thick but a little too rich and sweet for me. Overall a pleasant experience with relatively fast and good service. Felt a bit rushed to leave though as they wanted to take all the plates off at once (was working on cleaning the queso plate!).", "author": "Lydia Z."}

I've visited a couple of times, and I've generally enjoyed most of the food and drinks I've tried. The prickly pear margarita is sweet and refreshing, and I really like the la flama verde margarita as well if you are feeling something spicy. The queso is an absolute must (although I get it without chorizo). \n\nEntree wise, my favorite is the puffy impossible taco. It's flavorful and unique with a tasty doughy base. I didn't really enjoy the enchiladas I had last time, it seemed that they were missing some flavor and lacking the unique tastes that define this sort of southwestern cuisine. \n\nService is generally decent, although once we had to wait over 30 minutes for someone to come take our order, and the server seemed really low energy and unhappy to be there. Another time, our server was friendly, attentive, and kept our chips refilled the entire time. So it can be a hit or a miss, but it seems that most employees are nice.

What a scene. I don't care though. I'm getting brunch no matter what on the weekends. It combines two out of my three favorite meals and has been known to come with bottomless champagne. It's not wrong. \n\nFeeling as though standing outside Mission Beach Cafe for 45 minutes might cause me to implode with hanger, we went looking for a place to have a quick drink and stumbled upon West of Pecos. I ordered your standard mimosa, and it was anything but. The orange juice was fresh and delicious, and you could squeeze two drinks out of one order, as they give you the little bottle of champagne along with their own little bottle of orange juice. \n\nWe were so impressed we decided to come the next week for actual brunch. I ordered the breakfast tostada bowl with bacon. My friend ordered the chile rellenos Benedict with pork belly and a puffy squash taco. \n\nI'm going to need to come back and just get tacos, because that taco was out of control good. My dish was lovely and, although it had the potential to be heavy, had a nice combination of delicious, light ingredients. Oh yeah, and you can eat the bowl of fried flour tortilla goodness. The Benedict was good too, but I think it would have worked better with sausage. The presentation of both dishes was lovely and colorful. \n\nYou're going to want to order their signature prickly pear margaritas. They're pink. Delicious. $44 a pitcher. You can get about 3 each from the pitcher. Yummmmm! \n\nDrawbacks? They're newer, and the service is a little slow. It's starting to catch on as a good brunch spot, so get there early and now before they start with the ubiquitous 45 minute brunch waiting time. Over all, very good.

We came in on a Thursday, and while it seemed pretty full, we were seated immediately. We were looking for a lowkey, fun date night spot, but as we were getting seated, I worried out loud if perhaps this was not the vibe we were looking for. The restaurant has a (barely) more upscale Chevy's vibe, complete with the table of women next to us getting drunk on margaritas and a table of screaming children and apathetic parents on our other side. Mind you, I completely understand that it's out of the restaurant's hands how people choose to behave themselves. However, it definitely didn't help. \n\nOur server was friendly and answered a few questions that we had about the menu. We figured out what we wanted to order fairly quickly: \n- Queso deluxe: chorizo, guac, sour cream and corn atop a large skillet of queso. Probably my favorite dish, but chips were only ok. \n- Campfire cornbread skillet: pretty straightforward and tasty\n- Squash blossom puffy taco: by far my least favorite item that we ordered. All you could taste was fried-ness. All of the other flavors (goat cheese, black beans, romesco sauce) were completely hidden. I took one bite and was done. \n- Dungeness crab enchilada: This dish was fine; portion of crab was generous but the dish was a little all over the place in terms of taste. \n\nI also ordered the green michelada which just tasted like celery juice with a splash of beer. Definitely not great, but I was warned that it was far different from a traditional michelada. My husband got a mezcal cocktail and enjoyed it. \n\nWe asked for hot sauce twice during our meal, and our server completely forgot to order it. We had also ordered a side of rice and beans, which never came. It ended up being fine because I got pretty full on the chips and queso alone.

I have absolutely no clue when this restaurant opened, but I went there with a date tonight and I really enjoyed it! We ordered the queso to start, which is a MASSIVE quantity of cheese dip served in a little iron skillet (the part of me that misses Texas LOVED that detail). This is enough for three people, and verging on too much for two. They'll bring out plenty of chips-- we must've had at least three baskets between us, and there was STILL queso left when our entr\u00e9es came.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian chili relleno, which had a delightfully crispy coating and was served with salsa, whole black beans, rice, and some creamed corn. My only complaint is that the beans were slightly bland, but I mixed the remaining queso with the beans and rice and it was kind of perfect. The servings are extremely generous, and the staff is very polite and helpful. I really liked the dried chili pepper light fixtures and the rest of the decor! I'd totally come back sometime.\n\nP.S.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-17", "description": "As a West Texan ex-pat living in the Bay Area, I was conflicted about checking out West of Pecos. In the four years I've lived in Berkeley every \"Tex-Mex\" place that I have tried here has been a disappointing simulacrum of the real thing. I had no expectations that West of Texas would be any better than those places. Nevertheless, even the most remote possibility of a wonderful Tex-Mex meal was enough to entice me to give this place a try. \n\nWhen I think of food west of Pecos, I picture: warm, crispy tortilla chips served with spicy salsa, refreshing margaritas with fresh lime juice, a (visibly and audibly) sizzling skillet with well-seasoned fajita meat, grilled onions and peppers, refried beans, rice, and sweet puffy sopapillas with honey. Sounds amazing right? In fact, you are probably looking at flights to El Paso after reading this. Anyway, the SF West of Pecos, wasn't able to live up to those lofty standards. However, their attempt at Southwestern cooking is nothing to scoff at.\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived at the restaurant around 6 pm on a Friday night. The place was packed, so we put our names on the waiting list. I like that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. After a 15 minute wait at the bar, we were seated.\n\nI was excited to see that West of Pecos carries Shiner Bock, a beer that is a staple of any decent establishment. We each ordered a bottle ($4) as well as chips and guacamole ($10). \nThat's a pretty high price for guac considering that the portion was deceptively small. They stacked chips under the serving bowl, so it would seem like there was more guac than there actually was. What seemed like a deep bowl, was actually a shallow dish. In terms of taste, the guac was fine, but nothing special.\n\nI should note that they do not offer complimentary chips and salsa, which is a crime in most parts of Texas. They also up-charge for beans and rice for entrees which is also illegal throughout the state. I'm being facetious, but seriously, your restaurant wouldn't last longer than a month in Texas if you did either of these things. \n\nFortunately, the main dishes really redeemed the restaurant. I ordered the flank steak fajitas ($21), and while my skillet was not sizzling as it was brought to me (it's a simple trick to do; just Google it) the steak was nicely seasoned, and the array a sauteed peppers and onions was exceptionally tasty. I liked the corn tortillas too. Overall, it was a satisfying fajita plate. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Hatch green chile burger with bacon ($15). The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The Hatch peppers had a nice smoky taste, but didn't bring any noticeable amount of heat to the burger. That's a shame, because it would have been balanced well by the rich garlic mayo sauce. The fries, which were more of potato wedges, were just fine. \n\nOur service was good up until we had finished our meal. After that our server disappeared for a while, and we waited about 20 minutes before receiving the check. She seemed to be cognizant of this though, and she surprised us by comping our beers, which was really nice of her to do. \n\nIn the end, I was actually pretty impressed with the food and service at West of Pecos. It's not on the level of the food back home, but it is definitely the best Tex-Mex that I have had in the Bay.", "author": "Ravi S."}

A fun play on the cocktail, with tequila as the main liquor. I really wanted to try one of their tequila drinks, but I wanted the flavors of something dark and smokey. This did the trick! My gf liked her cocktail as well. I had a sip and while it was light and refreshing, it definitely had a spicy kick!\n\nSince we were taking up a table, we ordered the Queso & chips: house-made chorizo ($10). Cheesy and oh so flavorful! Gooey cheese and chorizo are one of my favorite combinations. This one dish was so much better than the meal we were trying to forget.\n\nMy gf and I were having so much fun, we ended up talking and getting two rounds of drinks. I love the vibe of this place.

I sat down and just adored all the artwork and paintings.\n\nAs for the menu, only 2/6 of the menu is food. The rest are drinks! Cocktails on the front, beer on the back, spirits on the 2nd to the last. Food is on the 2&3 page. I can't believe I can drink some good ol Shiner Bock! And it's only $3 during Happy Hour! I will have to come back for that.\n\nI ordered the RoadRunner, which is a Mezcal cocktail. Very smokey with a hint of spice. A great drink to sip on.\nAs for food, there are a ton of vegetarian options, and vegan food can be made with a bit of modification.\nI ordered the taco, without any cheese or cream. It is a crispy taco topped with sauteed mushrooms, beans, and pomegranate. This was really good, though a bit pricey at $5 for 1 taco and no sides or garnishes.\nI also ordered the side of Maple roasted Brussel Sprouts. These were my favorite here! Crispy brussel sprouts that is sweet and salty. It is so good to just pop these into your mouth or top my taco with it.\n\nIn terms of prices, it is a bit high. $13 and I ate 1 taco and a small plate of brussel sprouts. I was just full enough, but felt like I could've eaten a little more. \nMaybe this place is worth it during Happy Hour.\n\nBut the food is well prepared and full of flavor. \n\nTex-Mex food at Cali prices.

Not enough restaurants have the audacity to just put a cup of goddamn cheese on the menu.\n\nThe other day we ordered a side of broccoli just to be a little bit healthy.  And it was delicious!  Why would a restaurant bother to make a side of broccoli taste good?  You know we'll eat it no matter how bad it tastes.  But for some reason, West of Pecos gave us a pretty tasty and interesting side of broccoli.\n\nAlso, because it's on Valencia and has a bar and whatnot, and because Yelp says \"Good for Kids: No\", you'd think this restaurant would not be kid-friendly.  But you would be wrong!  And frankly you should stop being so judgmental.

They dust their chips with paprika or some other spice that makes them awesome, and they're generous with refills. Their queso is the BEST queso I've had outside of Texas (my hometown) in quite some time. \n\nI ordered fruit and the puffy mushroom & squash taco, which might be seasonal since the online menu had a different variation of this. It was delicious, but a bit on the small side. I think you'd have to order 2-3 puffy tacos to be full.\n\nMy friend's kale tostada bowl looked really good and healthy!

It's undeniable that Tex-Mex restaurants are the best places to celebrate Happy Hour, but I firmly believe this is the best one out here in the city.\n\nI've been obsessed with Aqui Cal-Mex down in San Jose for their \"Swirls\" which is frozen house margarita mixed with their sangria. Now their swirls are no joke as it can easily get you on \"another level\". But honestly who has the time to travel 45 minutes south just to drink? Now when I discovered that West of Pecos sold their own version of the Swirl called \"Sangre del Toro\", I knew I had to try it. It was amazing just like Aqui Cal-Mex. Much smaller size but sure got the job done. Their drinks were fairly priced and of course their Management and Staff were so nice even if my friends and I were a little tipsy.\n\nUnfortunately I can't say too much about their food as I only had their guacamole and chips.

If you're planning to have fajitas, you'll get some guac though... so I'd probably skip on the app then.\n-Cast Iron Fajitas/Chicken:  I am used to monstrous portions of fajitas, so we thought we'd split them between two.  Not a good idea.  Not really enough to split, but still on the large size for one person to eat.  Definitely tasty!  I would eat these again.\n-Green Chile Mac & Cheese:  Not impressed.  I think I was expecting the entire top to be covered in cornbread crumbles, and it wasn't.  The green chile was not as prominent as I expected it to be.\n-Churrrrros:  Delicious!  One order can be shared by two for sure... unless you're like me and want them all to yourself.\n\nOK drinks.  Pitchers on pitchers right?  Each one serves about 5 of those cups they give you.  My personal fave was the Infamous El Guapo.  Unfortunately, no tajin rimmed glass if you get the pitcher... I'm sure that would've made it even better.  The La Casa on the rocks was good too... pretty standard margarita.  Probably would've been really tasty as a frozen one though.  Not too impressed by the La Flama Verde.  We did order the Cactus Bowl which is meant for 2 people, but can easily be shared by at least 4.  Very very smokey taste to it.  It takes a certain type of palette to appreciate.\n\nService was significantly slow when we went.  We had apologetic servers for the most part, but there were times we seriously were wondering what was going on.  Sometimes it was to the point where we were waiting for a while just to get some more flour tortillas that our chicken fajitas were getting cold. :(  Kind of a bummer... but I don't think it was intentional.  They were pretty busy.  Rezzie recommended for sure!", "author": "Reena P."}

That combo is the way to go!\n\nBrown Sugar Buttermilk Organic Fried Chicken w/ Mashed Potatoes, Braised Collard Greens and Creamed Corn -- http://bit.ly/1zfrdwN\nThe Chicken was really good!  It's very similar to the fried chicken at Hops & Hominy, but it's about $5 cheaper.  Very crispy skin and the meat was very juicy and flavorful.  You get the whole half chicken and all the goodies that go well with it.  This is probably one of the best Fried Chicken entrees I've had in SF.  Rivaling Little Skillet's Fried Chicken by just a under a hair.\n\nHatch Green Chile Mac & Cheese --  http://bit.ly/1DWG2Mw\nI liked their Mac & Cheese!  Had a nice cheesy consistency and the Green Chiles gave it a good spicy kick.  It was a great side dish pairing with the Fried Chicken.\n\nI like the restaurant's atmosphere as it's very cozy, though it can be pretty loud.  Service was pretty good but the I felt drinks I had were a little weak, which for me since I'm not much of a drinker, isn't such a bad thing.  But if you go with a bunch of drinking buddies, it's something to take note of.\n\nI heard West of Pecos has a very good brunch so that's one thing I'll be coming back to try.

In short: West of Pecos is a low-key but nice Latin American restaurant with flavorful, beautifully plated food.\n\nMy favorites:\n\n-Fish tacos: a plate comes with 3 tacos. You can also ask for smaller portions as well--we got 1 extra so we could split evenly. The batter is crispy and light but well-defined, and the fillings are a crunchy slaw and tangy sauce, which complement the fish very well. (Pro tip: eat them fast or the corn tortillas will start to lose structural integrity from the slaw)\n\n-Maple brussel sprouts: I could eat these all day. I don't know what they put in this dish, but it is so comforting to eat. It is sweet yet rounded out nicely with a slightly salty/buttery flavor. Texture-wise, the sprouts are soft and minimally crispy.\n\n-Churros: this dish comes with 3 churros and 2 sauces. All I need is that caramel/dulce de leche sauce, though. Churros were crispy outside and soft inside, but a couple of time started imploding in my fingers. No worries though, because that caramel sauce is amazing.\n\nWorth checking out if you're looking for good food with a clean, rustic environment.

We dropped by a week before without a reservation and realized quickly that the wait was not worth it. This was our second attempt.\n\nTIP: Reserve in advance.... I think??\n\nI question the value of making reservations at this place since our group waited about 25 minutes AFTER our reservation time before we were seated. The estimated wait time without a reservation is around 30-40 minutes, so I don't know if the five minutes I saved was worth it. \n\nSERVICE: Mediocre\n\nThe person at the check-in table was great at letting us know how long it would take for us to get seated despite the unusually long wait. Once seated, our waiter rarely dropped by to check-in on us. I had to use the \"stare until they notice\" technique on several occasions to get his attention. We asked for only hot sauce and he brought that PLUS their house salsa which they ended up charging us for. Once we finished our meal it took way too long for him to realize that we were ready. I used the stare tactic again and had to flag him down to give us our bill. Mind you many people were waiting for a table, so I presumed the staff would be eager to wrap things up. Maybe he was having an off day, but the reality of service-based jobs is that one person's actions can cascade into the entire night's efforts.\n\nFOOD: Solid, but not memorable. \n\nThe puffy tacos are great and filling at $6 each. I tried the carnitas and BBQ pork which were both slightly sweet tasting, but still tasty. The BBQ pork was better IMO. I'm a hardcore carnitas fan, but the meat was a bit dry. Ask for a few slices of lime. That will surely elevate things. The fried chicken entree has delicious sides like creamed corn, creamy mashed potatoes, and wilted garlic spinach that truly outshine the chicken. For $16, you get 4 pieces of chicken (2 thigh/breast, 1 wing, 1 drumstick) which is A TON. Share this with someone else. \nI haven't had the drinks, but keep in mind they are a bit pricey and range between $11-14/each. \n\nSad to say this, but I don't think I'll be back!", "author": "Manisha S."}

Good booze, amazing in house juices and garnish to knowledgeable bartenders that know their stuff and know what you might like. If you get a brain freeze from drinking the frozen margarita too fast the nice host might even tell you a secrete to get rid of the brain freeze stat! \n\nI highly recommend this establishment for happy hour, or whatever hour it is. To all the reviewers that wrote it was crappy over priced Mexican food then you clearly have never A ate Mexican food that you should have known right away that it clearly states it is Tex-Mex and B if the name doesn't end in the suffix \"eria\" 9 times out of 10 then you should expect to pay above $10 per plate of food, and C if its on Valencia street in the Mission that seats more than 20 people at a time expect to be able to pay for the service along with tipping the staff kindly. I honestly don't know what people expect when going out to dinner sometimes.  \n\nSo if you want to try this place out expect to pay moderate prices, go in with the idea to share some small plates or get an appetizer and a large portion each and one drink and it shouldn't break the bank and fully satiate you.", "author": "Kate D."}

We started off with some guacamole, which was real fresh with pretty hefty chunks of avocado. I ordered two of the puffy tacos, carnitas and brisket. The meat was so tender and mouth watering. Extremely well crafted. The puffy taco shell was also uniquely delicious. Great texture and great flavor to go with the taco fixens.  I also sampled the fried chicken that my brother ordered, it is surely a highlight of the menu. I've heard that the queso is incredible here, and I'll certainly be back to try it!", "author": "Alex E."}

I was more than happy to stay once I arrived. The place has a great vibe - with the bushels of chili peppers hanging from the ceiling and the friendly staff - I enjoyed my time there. \n\nThe brunch menu takes classic American brunch and gives it a bit of a Mexican spin. First off I tried the bloody mary, which I was a bit apprehensive about (made with interesting ingredients). However, the combination they came up with (which I cannot remember) tasted just great! To eat, we had the pecos eggs benny (comes with a side salad and home fries) and the pork belly breakfast tacos (no side). Both were delicious! \n\nWest of Pecos does not have outdoor seating, but there are tables by the windows, which is almost as good.

Here's a quick summary of my preferences:\n\nThe Not So Good: green chile mac n cheese, side of rice and beans, chicken enchilada mole\nThe Good: West of Pecos fish tacos with the sauce, chopped harvest salad with chicken, fried green tomatoes\n\nThe green chile mac n' cheese smelled so good when it first came to the table, but the disappointment started at the first bite. It is extremely bland. Since the restaurant is labelled on Yelp as Tex-Mex, I had particular expectations for the rice and beans. The rice was green and the black beans had an off taste. Altogether, it was a bit bland too. The chicken mole was unexciting.\n\nNow for the good dishes I tried, they were REALLY GOOD. The West of Pecos fish tacos were loaded with lots of fried fish and the sauce added a nice tangy flavor. The tacos were delicious with my Modelo. The fried green tomatoes were crispy and paired nicely with the lemon aioli. Lastly, the chopped harvest salad with chicken was absolutely amazing. If there's anything I'd come back for, it would most definitely be for this salad! There was just a great balance with the crunchy jicama, soft lettuce, smooth avocado, and slight bitterness from the queso fresco. \n\nCustomer service was great and the outside seating with the heat lamp was perfect for a chilly night when I was there.", "author": "Jane P."}

I was able to secure a table on Saturday night within 24 hours of my booking. It worked like a charm!\n\nThough West of Pecos was simply just alright. We arrived early and sat at the bar for a cocktail. I had the Roadrunner margarita consisting of Mescal, thyme, mandarin, and lime. It seemed a little off balance, too much smoke and not enough citrus to cut it. I have had drinks here before and they were great, but this time around the cocktails were prepared in a rush and didn't have the love they deserve.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered the queso and chips, which arrived room temperature and if you know queso than you know it cools off very quickly. It's better to serve it on the hotter side than cooler and by 2 1/2 chips in, it was already cold and not tasty. \n\nThe lobster enchiladas were excellent. Big pieces of lobster in a nice creamy- green sauce. And only $16, which seems like steal for lobster and quality entree such as this one! \n\nI'd give this place another try though next time just for cocktails and some apps.", "author": "Melissa P."}

For example, now that I've checked out West of Pecos, I probably wouldn't return again. While it was good, it certainly wasn't great, which I'm surprised by since California is way closer to both Texas and Mexico than my home on the east coast is... and we've definitely got more delicious places than Pecos.\n\nOne of my personal issues with the place was the seating arrangement. Because we had a large group, we were sat at a dining table that was pushed up against a wall. Meaning the only other \"head\" seat put that person - me in this instance - in the middle of most waiters path. My chairs was kicked by everyone that walked by, and both my purse and coat were constantly being jostled off the back of my seat. It was just a super unpleasant experience.\n\nThe blood orange margarita was lovely (I appreciated the enormous wedge of fruit that came with it) - they definitely pour a strong drink here, because the taste of tequila overpowered the blood orangeyness. Not that this is the end of the world, but one drink was plenty for me since I'm not a huge tequila fan to begin with.\n\nI tried the guacamole and chips for appetizer - again, good, but certainly nothing revolutionary or memorable. It was pretty generic guac, though I do agree with my dinner mates - it was incredibly salty (then again - and maybe this is my paranoid speaking - maybe that was the plan; I've seen Jon Taffer's \"Bar Rescue\" enough to know that salty foods make people drink more. I'm on to you, WoP).\n\nThe vegetarian options weren't as plentiful as I would have liked, so I ended up settling on the tried and true stuffed chile rellano. It was the spiciest pepper I've ever had - again, intentional? Or just the work of novice chefs who didn't remove either the seeds or spine of the pepper? I also found the entire thing to be entirely dry and begging for more queso. I hate not finishing food, but in this case I just couldn't do it.\n\nThank goodness for all the snacks waiting for me back in my hotel!", "author": "Steff D."}

Was home all day with the roomie working from home and watching Millionaire Matchmaker so we decided to catch a $5 uber to get some dinner. \n\nHe had just been here a week before but gladly came with me again! I ordered the shot and beer to start with. Waitress was a bit confused when I asked her what the beer and shot was since it literally says on the menu that its rotating and how else would I know what it was but it was their cider and a shot of mescal. I would honestly skip this and the way she answered made it sound like its not really \"rotating.\" I choked down the cider and made my roommate drink the rest of my shot. It was not happening. The bar had lost my order so the waitress gave it to me on the house for the extra wait and I honestly did not even notice the wait. Super nice! Otherwise its $9. Would stick to the sangria. \n\nI wasn't that hungry but I got the lobster enchiladas and was soooo full after. Stupid brain! Asked if I wanted rice and beans (extra $) but the waitress said the enchiladas are so rich they don't need the sides so I opted out. There is a ton of sauce though so I ate it with the chips. Huge pieces of lobster! \n\nThe chips and salsa might actually be the best part of the meal to be honest. Chips are so bomb! I would only come back for their happy hour otherwise. So many better food and drink options on the block! Oh and my roommate said the restaurant was too dark and I said it was too loud. I loved how dark it was and he didn't even notice it was loud.

All quite welcome experiences to soothe our longing for Austin Tex-Mex (my gf was born and raise in Austin, I lived there about 10 years off and on). \n\nHOWEVER - the queso was really really disappointing.  The 4 stars are for everything but the queso, which was definitely a 1 star affair - I'd happily go to my grave never seeing this glop again, let alone eating it. \n\nTorchy's queso in Austin approaches the Platonic ideal for queso, everyone knows this is true. We asked for the chorizo to be omitted, so in fairness it might be a little better for carnivores, but it was:\n\n1) nowhere near hot enough\n2) wrong texture - goopy and sticky even when hot (probably not enough sour cream -- is there even sour cream in it?)\n3) bland - it should have salsa in it, or be served with salsa so that diners can adjust to taste\n4) the chips are dusted with some kind of chile powder or paprika that is unpleasantly bitter\n\nSeriously, West of Pecos - you have something pretty great going, please please take a quick trip to Austin, eat Torchy's queso every day you are there, come back and do your best to rip them off. If you hack together a passable Torchy's style queso we'd come back again and again to satisfy our regular queso cravings.", "author": "Sebastian H."}

The restaurant was packed with people as it was Dia de los Muertos weekend. It was a little cramped in the bar area but we were able to eventually squeeze in our party of 7 at the long bar. \n\nThe cocktail menu primarily focused on tequilas and bourbons. I tried both the classic and prickly pear MARGARITAS. They both tasted fine but not exceptional. I wanted my prickly pear margarita to have a more spicy kick to it since it had 'serrano peppers' in the description. The PIMM'S PUNCH was served in a rustic, metal cup but  the alcohol was rather strong and overwhelming. I enjoyed the sweeter, fruitier taste of the LAYLA cocktail (and so did my guy friends!). Overall the cocktails were simply A-OK for the price and you can probably find better drinks elsewhere in the Mission.\n\nThe atmosphere proved to be great for conversation between our large group. Although I think this will be an ideal place for medium-sized group gatherings (5 ppl or less) due to its smaller seating areas. \n\nFrom fancier drinks to full screen TV's for football viewing, West of Pecos is a perfect combo of classy and casual in the Mission.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-21", "description": "I'm almost hesitant to review West of Pecos for brunch because it means the secret will be out about how AWESOME it is. Here's why:\n\n1) No wait. None. For 6 people, at 11:30am on a Sunday? Unheard of! We could've shown up at 12pm or 1pm - same. There may appear to be no tables available when you reserve online, but if you email they're very prompt. I didn't even need to do that in the end!\n\n2) VERY cost-effective. Every dish was well under $15, most were around $10 - and of course it was all really tasty as well as vegetarian-friendly.\n\n3) Excellent service. We were very well-attended to (they were often coming around, we asked for hot water which was a little unusual and they made sure to refill those too, they saw I was cold and closed the doors that were previously propped open) and made sure to tip extra because they deserved it. \n\nSNACKS\n* Carrot Cake French Toast (cream cheese frosting. $8) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#svuomVWB8Ah0oXe5zH6nIw\ncross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#_BQfDZu70GRK8ILfo9r9DA\nHow can you NOT order this? Two of my favorite things in the world in one, and they make it work. The texture was more dense like carrot cake, but the edges of the bread were crisped like French Toast. The cream cheese frosting, raspberries, maple syrup, and glazed pecans were awesome, awesome, awesome together.\n\n* Biscuit & Strawberry Jam ($3) - 3.5 stars\nThe jam is great - light, a little tart. The biscuit was soft and fluffy on the inside, with a thick shell, but was a bit dry.\n\nBRUNCH\n* Two Pork Belly Austin Breakfast Tacos (scrambled eggs, maple-glazed pork belly, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, flour tortillas, avocado, chipotle aioli. $10) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#5HwcWC73YaajuKoDOXn6kA\nup close: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#_islhVp7CmGvwdkVGn1IMw\nThe tortillas were amazing! Thick, freshly made, that texture that's soft yet holds well, that crackles just a little bit when you pick it up and bend it around the toppings. This was a huge standout for me in the meal. Most of the taco is filled with eggs, which are big, light, fluffy. There is a giant slab of pork belly on top, and a big slice of avocado. While all the ingredients were great, it was a little imbalanced with mostly eggs. Also, the avocados & pork belly on top - while it looked great - made it hard to eat because they were such big pieces placed neatly on top of the eggs.\n\n* Polenta con Chorizo (aged cheddar, eggs, smoked cream, corn, veggies, home fries. $13) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#pAaa-FiwmUn4ZxrXGhAhKw\ncross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#nSiXZgRDqW_VzQ669qFFxQ\nThis was a very uniquely made! I was expecting a thick soup-like polenta on the bottom of the bowl, but they actually fry the polenta into two slabs. I liked that! A big of crunch, a chance to break open the poached egg and let the yolk run over it. There wasn't as much meat as I'd hoped in the soup, maybe 2 big chunks, but it was soft super tasty. \n\nLUNCHY\n* Pair of Baby Kale Tostadas (black beans, guacamole, tomato vinaigrette. $9) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/west-of-pecos-san-francisco?select=zf8-3MnDpltyc0uGAwR6mQ#W5jfn0H-6XwolV6i_s155g\nI tried a bite of this and it was great!

The pork tasted like reconstituted meat, and they forgot to add a pork flavored bouillon.  The beef only had a splash of queso--real Texans would pour it on.  The cornbread was nice and buttery but misplaced.  Y'all won't find such a thing at a Tex-Mex place in Texas.  Maybe at bbq place but that's an entirely different genre.

Many yelp reviews speak of the green chile mac & cheese, crispy brussels sprouts, chile relleno, etc. These items are only served during dinner hours. \n\nYet, I happened into here for a weekend brunch. Around 1pm on Sunday afternoon, we were looking for a place to eat- decent prices, sit down, no crazy long wait, and can sit a group of 4. We came across West of Pecos when walking down Valencia, so decided to give it a try. I like how it's good for groups, the tables are big, and there's outdoor seating. During the day time, this place is well lit due to the open doors and natural lighting. \n\nSERVICE: \nService is friendly, and they constantly refilled our water.  I asked the waitress for recommendations, and she said the pork belly tacos and cuban sandwich. I'm always in favor of trying foods I usually don't make at home, so I went with the breakfast tacos. Dat pork belly can draw you in. \n\nFOOD: \nTwo pork belly Austin breakfast tacos: scrambled eggs, maple-glazed pork belly, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, avocado, and chipotle aioli on a flour tortillas ($10)\n\nI like the different flavors. The maple syrup added a touch a sweetness to balance the savoriness. The porkbelly was crispy and tasty. The taco could have used more pico de gallo. (I like sauces, so it seemed a bit dry) The chipotle aioli was good. I asked for the aioli on the side, but it still came on the taco. The flour tortillas were about 6-8 inches; I asked for corn tortillas but they didn't have them. Nevertheless, I still cleaned house and took these tacos to the dome.\n\nThe ultimate question: \"Would I come here again?\" \nUm...sure. But with so many other good Mission restaurants, this place doesn't necessarily stand out. But there's decent prices compared to some of the cray cray stuff out there.

YEEEE HAWWW!!!!\n\nBrought to you by the man behind Woodhouse Fish Co., comes West of Pecos, a Tex-Mex restaurant serving Southern Comfort fare. All plates are meant for sharing which is perfect for groups as West of Pecos has a  ~100 person capacity with a bar area and two dining rooms. \n\nOn my quest to try all of the \"Hot New Businesses\" on Yelp, I needed to figure a way to convince a special someone to come along with me. I saw West of Pecos had avocado on the menu so I sent Mr. Avocado Lover, a link to the menu and said, \"Look, they have an Avocado & Lobster Salad on the menu...your favorite!\" SOLD! Yes, I'm a conniving biatch. *Muahaahaaa*\n\nF O O D\nSince summer is just around the corner we wanted to keep it healthy. The items we ordered are not what I would have normally ordered. Y'all know I would have gone for those messy Texas ribs. MmMm...\n\n*SCORCHED CORN ON THE COB w/ Sweet Chili Crema & Dried Lime ($6) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ReeiGTEamR1ScmzAdH7s4A?select=QGXs0fEg9Ug3PutqRd45yw\nA rendition of the elote (Mexican corn), the melding of the sweet corn, salty cojita cheese, sweet chili cream and lime was like a fiesta in my mouth; however, the corn needed more char to fit its title of \"scorched\" corn. \n\n*AVOCADO & MAINE LOBSTER SALAD w/ Watercress, Romaine Lettuce & Whole Grain Mustard Dressing ($18) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ReeiGTEamR1ScmzAdH7s4A?select=ydJNK4GGZPgRHlIxTJ2dwQ\nKnowing how much Mr. Avocado Lover loves his avocados, I didn't want to fork his dish. He said he liked (tossing) his salad and it was overall a \"4\". He's a seasoned veteran in the salad tossing department so I'll take his word for it. \n\n*WHOLE FISH FAJITAS w/ Curtido & Plancha Sauteed Green Onions ($22) - 4.5 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ReeiGTEamR1ScmzAdH7s4A?select=OS5i4CgAE7NDvRt_1Seliw\nThe whole fish fajitas were ridiculously good. The fish was perfectly grilled then stuffed with coleslaw and served with curtido (pickled cabbage). The skin was crisp and the flesh tender. Paired along with the crisp, tangy coleslaw, spicy aioli and a squeeze of lime, it was a dish PACKED with flavor! I opted for the flour tortillas because I hate the rubber band texture of corn tortillas. I wasn't keen on the flour tortillas though because they were unusually thick like naan. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ReeiGTEamR1ScmzAdH7s4A?select=9ovMgUxH80pNfMYXNSuqcA Nonetheless, this dish proved that healthy can STILL be good!\n\nDo NOT forget to order one of their artisan tequila cocktails. THEY'RE A MUST! The Mezcal Mule w/ Ginger Beer & Fresh Lime Juice ($9) was deliciously refreshing from the tinge of ginger beer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ReeiGTEamR1ScmzAdH7s4A?select=LNIugsiO4XegtE9o6ogG4Q I can drink most guys under the table but just half sent me to a giddy stage so it's definitely a bang for your buck. \n\nS E R V I C E\nSuper friendly, down-to-earth, and attentive, the entire staff is doing a wonderful job considering they've only been open for less than 2 weeks. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nWest of Pecos will have you wanting to throw on your cowboy boots and chaps with its Wild Wild West theme: country wooden furnishings and flooring, the large Texas longhorn skull adorning the wall and a painted bull skull in the bar area. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ReeiGTEamR1ScmzAdH7s4A?select=0IMhM2RJ7KhxuLtMHnLWjg NO bare-booty leather chaps please!\n\nWith a large dining area, West of Pecos is good for large groups. \n\nP A R K I N G\nDifficult street parking. Take a cab or public transit because there's no nearby parking lots. \n\nWelcome to The Mission, West of Pecos!

Kept adding lime juice and salt to no avail. Corn should not be in guac!!  It is a cheap filler and those two flavors don't work together. \n\nThe tacos were just as bad. The brisket was smothered in some kind of syrupy BBq sauce. You could have put leather in the taco and it would not have made a difference. The fluffy shell was not my thing either.

The large windows gave us a good view of people milling around the mission in costume so we were really excited about that. The ambiance is on the rustic side. \n\nI chose this place because I really wanted a prickly pear margarita. When I got my margarita it was strong. Don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nAlthough I like the quality and flavor of the food I find that the portions are either too small or large. I ordered the pork enchilada and it came nice and hot on a small cast iron skillet. The portion was too small for me and I would say I eat normal portions when I go out. So, I wasn't thrilled with my entree. However, my husband's entree the ribs came with slaw and baked beans. His portion was much larger so much that he couldn't finish it and he usually eats large portions. The only portion that seem to hit a nice medium is our friend's Fish Tacos.

Naturally, we were hungry so we made our way to West of Pecos... BEST DECISION everrr\n\nAMBIANCE: we walked into this very \"OC\" reminiscent Mexican food spot, meaning it was super clean and \"fancier\" than the average City spot. it was pretty large and open but we sat closer to the bar. it was a long booth with small round tables along side it. the decor was a mix of dessert icons, wooden chairs and tables, chilli peppers hanging from the ceiling, cattle skulls and horns, rot iron candle chandelier, and leather skins as portrait. i felt like i wanted to buy some cowboy boots from Wasteland so i can wear them here even though it's casual and no specific attire :)  \n\nFOOD:  SO GOOD. seriously. I'm from San Diego and i'm very critical of Mexican food and dont really care for classic mexican food but this spot has it on point! i got the DUNGENOUS CRAB BREAKFAST CHIMICHUNGA, my cousins got the BREAKFAST PORK BELLY TACOS, and HUEVOS RANCHEROS. i would rank the goodness in that order too. the crab chimichunga was so light and flakey on the outside and contained collared greens, bacon, scrambled eggs, mascarpone, and green chillies. i enjoyed every bite! oh and it was also larger than the plate in length. The maple glazed pork belly tacos melted in our mouths. the scrambled eggs def gave it a breakfast touch to differentiate it from regular tacos. for dessert we got a side of CHURROs that came with mexican chocolate dipping sauce. deeee-freakin-licious. the BLOODY MARY was also nice and spicy :)\n\nPRICE:  average per plate is $12, but you get what you pay for!\n\nSERVICE: the waiter we had was sooo nice and accommodating. we asked if we could get a side of Churros since we saw there is a dish of Fried Chicken and Churros and he was more than happy to accommodate.\n\nPARKING: street parking in the mission, well you know how that goes.", "author": "Veronica E."}

The menu has changed quite a bit  since their initial opening, and there are some things that I really enjoy on the current one and some things I miss from the original; one being the Maine lobster salad for example. But all things aside, I am a big fan of this place. The ambience is very much in keeping with its Tex Mex cuisine, down to the steer horns and poncho-like blankets adorning the walls. \n\nIf you have time, come for the Happy hour (5pm-6:30pm): $5 Sangria and frozen margs, $5 starters, and $3 for an order (of two) tacos!\n\nThe current dinner menu satisfies. I've had the BBQ chicken (huge portion and juicy all around), flank steak, and the chile relleno. All of the above have left me pleased. The green chile mac was good, but definitely under seasoned. A few dashes of hot sauce fixed that issue and added a nice kick. \n\nA go-to drink for me has been the Pecos Punch (not sure if it is still on the drink menu) but it is a blend of rum and other good libations. Definitely on the sweet side, but comes in a glass carafe - meant for sharing... unless you're trying to get after it that evening. \n\nOverall, great restaurant. If you're looking for a cute and trendy but unpretentious restaurant in the mission that has a playful menu, this place is your spot. I took my, very particular father here and he could not have enjoyed himself more. That alone ensures this spot is a winner.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

Granted, we didn't order any of their main dishes (just several sides and starters) but we felt most of our dishes needed to be injected flavor.

It must have been this particular night, but it was sooooooo super salty, that with the salt from the chips was more than enough. Everything else about it, texture and taste was there.

It has been growing over the past decade and now has a big restaurant scene. Most restaurants have nice interiors with clever menus. I always walk by these new restaurants when I am on Valencia always wanting to try them. Today I walked by this one and decided to try it. The interior was dimly lit and dark. The menu had American food staples like fish and chips, kobe beef hamburger, fried chicken, pork chop, and ribs. The prices were average, but definitely not cheap. I got a coffee-rubbed barbecue brisket sandwich that came with fries and slaw. It was $14. I enjoyed it. I also got a \"Do It Yourself Arnie Palmer.\" I got this at Woodhouse FIsh Co. I guess it's a new trend to have \"Do It Yourself\" lemonade and Arnold Palmer. I would come back here again, but first I must try some more new restaurants on Valencia.", "author": "Denise C."}

The service was great (and they were very accommodating of our strollers), the food better and the drinks best of all.  And it wasn't too expensive? We'll definitely be coming back.  Some highlights:\n\n1.  The queso dip was spot-on.  We're veggie so we skipped the chorizo (they were happy to leave it out), and the dip was exactly, perfectly what I wanted from a queso dip, with the right amount of spice and a great consistency.  Should have ordered two.\n\n2.   The guacamole was also the bomb, with big chunks of avocado and a great hand on the seasoning.  Really well done.\n\n3.   The Micheladas!  I've never had a green Michelada, but it was deliciously spicy and tangy, with a smoky-salty rim that added to the flavor.  Even better was the red Michelada, which was one of the best I've ever had.  Whoever's working the bar needs a raise.\n\n4.   Fish tacos.  I'm not usually a fan of breaded and fried fish tacos, but the red pickled cabbage provided the right amount of acid, and the sauce was really delicious.  Still might rather have grilled fish, but I'd eat these tacos again.  Be warned: they bring you three hulking tacos, could have easily split the dish between two people.\n\n5.  Kale Caesar Tostadas.  This dish was a bit of an innovation, with black bean and avocado tostadas covered in a kale caesar salad.  It ended up being heavier than I'd expected, but it was a great salad, and it seemed to last forever.\n\n6.  Chopped Salad, with fried garbanzos.  A+ on this one, a excellent mexican version of a chopped salad with jicama and garbanzos for texture.  I might get the dressing on the side next time (they gave me too much ), but a really great choice for anyone looking to reduce their waistline (like me).\n\nI'm also quite fond of the look of the place, and of the open-air vibe.  If I had one suggestion, it would be to change up the music!  I love classic rock, but when I'm in a cantina I should be listening to Willie Nelson and the like.", "author": "Cody V."}

The menu contains interesting sounding, modernized Tex-Mex dishes which fall short in the areas of execution, flavor, and quality of ingredients. \n\nOf all the things I tried, the only thing I would actually pay for again are things with pork shoulder and the mac n cheese. Come for the drinks (happy hour M-F), not for the food.\n\nFOOD \n* GREEN CHILE MAC N CHEESE ($6): This was good, but didn't really taste special. It was probably one of the better things we ordered, good value, and a good side to share.\n\n* BRAISED PORK SHOULDER ($11): Tasty, flavorful, and fork tender. I would get this again although the portion was very small. \n\n* GRILLED CORN ($8): $8 for 1 cob of corn? Wow, that just seems kind of ridiculous. Plus, the corn was not particularly fresh, very heavily covered in honey, so it tasted a bit rubbery and artificial. \n\n* ANCHO AND APRICOT PORK RIBS ($16): Good flavor, but kind of tough.\n\n* FLAT IRON STEAK ($19): Really tasty! Unfortunately, it was also too chewy.\n\n* MARGARET's PORKCHOP ($17): Unevenly cooked, very dry at parts, unmemorable, a bit small, and pales in comparison to Nopa or Seven Hills.\n\n* WOODHOUSE GRILLED ARTICHOKE ($17): Typically, I am not a big artichoke fan and didn't like anything about this dish. I thought this was boring, overpriced, needed sauce or flavor, and fresher seafood.\n\nDRINKS: (5-6:30PM HAPPY HOUR)\n* MEZCAL MULE ($9): Smoky and comes in a cute little camping style cup!\n\n* PRICKLY PECOS MARGARITA ($9): Spicy, fruity, you can't go wrong.

Friends and I had dinner there on a busy Saturday evening. As usual, the Mission was lively (although that made for difficult parking). Thanks to our friends who had made reservations though!\n\nWOP has a great wood decor with dim lighting and an open kitchen. It was pretty packed with people both in the main dining room and on the bar side. They even have two tables outside the giant double doors that are next to mini fireplaces and have heat lamps overhead. \n\nThere's a nice cocktail menu for those who like their spirits and libations. I'm not a tequila girl and bourbon isn't too much up my alley, so I went with the Goldrush which had sparkling wine in it. Liked very much and probably could have had a few more of those, but behaved myself. \n\nOur group started off with some queso and chips. Just something to snack on before dinner....good for what it was. For the main event, I went with the Lavender & Chipotle Duck Breast. The duck was plentiful and cooked perfectly. The lavender flavor was very unique and I'm pretty much a fan of floral accents so it was a hit for me. The duck was also accompanied by a warm arugula salad candied pecans. Yum-o! Bf got the Flat Iron Steak. It was cooked exactly as he ordered it. That came with a stack of onion rings. The onion rings were thinly sliced with just enough batter. Another friend ordered the same.

The Arkansas applesauce is tasty and that was what made the pork good. Not crazy about the turnips that had a plastic taste. Baby carrots were roasted.\n\n*Cast Iron Burger: the beef patty is thick and cooked medium rare but a bit dry. The cheddar cheese didn't look or taste like cheddar. Came with greens and french fries.

Best possible hangover food, and would totally order it up sans hangover, too. Same goes for the Bloody Mary. So money.\n\nI also scored a few bites of my neighbor's french toast, and it was excellent - thick, just the right texture (soft, with a little crisp around the edges), and flavor to the bread itself, so it was good even without the syrup. It also came with fresh fruit, so every bite got a nice cool pop of freshness.\n\nWe had (hung over) people arriving at all different times, and West of Pecos was super nice about accommodating everyone, taking and bringing out orders as people arrived, and letting us keep our party together even when like half the table had already eaten and were just hanging out.\n\nThey were a great spot for a big group, but there were lots of people eating there in twos and fours as well, so I feel like I can safely recommend for whatever you've got going on.

It's smokey, moderately spicy and sweet - a combo that sounds like a recipe for disaster but is actually quite the opposite. \n\nAnd the Queso dip with chorizo is quite possibly one of the best items you could have after a night of drinking-related debauchery. Thus, it's the perfect complement to the Mezcal Mule. The pork carnitas and duck tacos are a close second. \n\nSo the next time, you're on a bar-hopping spree in the Mission or just want a bar to catch up with friends in, consider West of Pecos. \n\nHappy drinking, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Unfortunately it wasn't as great as the first time.\n\nMy husband ordered the Eggs Benny and he liked it very much, I ordered the harvest salad with grilled chicken and it was just okay. In all honestly it was definitely not worth $16.\n\nThe butter lettuce with a dash of sweet corn and 1/4 of avocado with a few measly bits of roasted garbanzo beans were $10 and then the dry chicken to top it off was $6.\n\nIf I'm going to pay that much for a salad it have better be great and this was subpar.

I had asked for some balsamic vinaigrette and it never made it to my table.\n\nOverall my whole experience this time around kinda left me thinking that I'm not sure if I'd make my way back here again. \n\nIn a nutshell this joint is just average all the way around and if I can get better food and service somewhere else then I will.  \n\nFor now I'm leaving West of Pecos 3 stars and if I visit again I hope things improve.", "author": "V W."}

Came here with a friend who also grew up in Texas, and my girlfriend who lived there as a child, and we all agreed that while the concept of each dish was spot on, the execution just wasn't there.  Like so many other places in San Francisco, the flavors are far too muted and bland.  Items that should have been spicy weren't, and I can't count how many times the word \"bland\" was used during our dinner.  The queso was also watery and pales in comparison to the queso at Tacolicious which is much more authentic.  \n\nIf you own this place and are reading this, I really dig what you're going for here.  Good Texan and southwestern cuisine are really needed in San Francisco.  I also know that if you properly season/spice food in this town, you'll have more than a few complaints from locals who insist on everything being bland.  That being said, take a cue from Mission Chinese Food and actually start seasoning your food the way it's meant to be seasoned.  Sure, you will get a few complaints, but you'll also acquire a devoted group of customers who grew up with these flavors and miss them.", "author": "Joshua W."}

And definitely with a Mission / southern feel.\n\nThis place definitely has a good hot kick of each and every dish and drink.\n\nOpening night the full menu was pretty impressive, from cocktails of tequila, Mezcal and Whiskey to liquors just on their own, to beers, and flip over the page you will find a good list of wines. Definitely a taste of Mission style drinks and I had the Pecos Margarita which was quite good with strong alcohol without being too sugary.\n\nThe appetizer griddled goat cheese (circular cake look) with arugula, sun dried tomatoes and dried pear was vibrant looking and a good starter and not too strong cheese taste.\n\nThe lamb albondigas (meatball style) was with chorizo, spicy tomato and green chile broth and corn. It had some fiery hot taste to the broth. The light broth texture (rich taste) was not something I have seen too often. The flavors were bursting and solid full.\n\nIt is not a full meal until you have desserts. They have one and only 1 dessert for the opening evening - the 3 scopes of different ice cream tastes from Tara's in Berkeley. The sweet corn was with great corn chewy; the lavender was floral but not overwhelming. But my favorite was the chipotle chocolate. O-M-G it had the best kick on the tongue. The dish accompanied with 3 house made cookies too. They served (only) dripped Peets coffee.\n\nWhile it took over 30 mins to get the appetizer then another 10 for main course on their first quite packed evening, the service was excellent as the server kept coming by checking on the drinks and water. As soon as I finished the appetizer and they took the utensils away, they were immediately replaced with another set. This very seasoned without stress looking service easily earned an applause.\n\nThey currently opened about half of the restaurant and in a couple weeks will have the other half open mostly for larger and / or private parties. The bar area features big comfy seats while the main dining area can easily put tables together and welcomes bigger groups.\n\nThis place fits right in the Mission and perfectly on trendy Valencia with its colorful and up a notch of deliciousness without breaking the wallet.", "author": "T L."}

What is that seasoning???\n\n2) Pitcher of Margaritas...I now have 3 go-to Margarita places in the city. Velvet Cantina, Tacolicious, and West of Pecos. I'll need to do a side by side taste comparison to stack rank them...but we found ourselves another winner.\n\n3) DONT DO THIS. DONT ORDER THE HARVEST SALAD.

No way.\n\nSo I perused and was annoyed and ordered and wondered how many identical twins of one of my most annoying supervisors could work in the same place.  The answer:  Three.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to my proprietary, super-secret way of deciding which business to Yelp next:  I had a heart.  No, having a heart isn't like sleeping with someone because you feel sorry for her, and no, I've never done that, and any person who has done that should be ashamed of herself--and yes, it's usually shes who do this and then wonder why poor guys they feel sorry for can't get the hint.  Having a heart in this case means being generous in the truest, noblest sense of that word.\n\nNormally, it would annoy me that a place in San Francisco doesn't have many vegetarian options, but this time, I sucked it up and ordered one of the two (or maybe there was only one), and it was good.  Not delicious, but very good.  So West of Pecos is solid in an underwhelming way.\n\nAnd although they looked like the infamous JBL, all of his twins were very kind and not passive-aggressively so, the way the real JBL was and most definitely still is.  Unless he had a life-changing experience.  Or maybe he went back to Russia.  But if he did go back to Russia, I'm sure the returning JBL would be twice as intolerable, because if there's one thing about JBL, it's that he likes to make it seem as if his myriad experiences are unique.  They may very well be unique, but he talks as if he's the only person who has ever been interested in anything, and while he is interested, he's not committed, and that's sad.  If you're good at a lot of things, you're usually not very good at anything.  I think that sums up West of Pecos, but the people are nice.\n\nIt's too cold in here, and the seating is arranged in a weird way.

We asked the hostess if we needed to put ourselves on the list for a table if we wanted to sit in the bar area for a bite and a couple of drinks even though we had been there many times and just went straight to the bar area. It seemed to be a little busier than usual. She said we didn't, it was first come first serve and even handed us a menu to start looking at it while we waited for an open table. Once we spotted one and sat down the bartender came and told us we needed to move because all tables were reserved for people on the waiting list.  Went back to the hostess and she literally walked away from us as we approached. She then started taking to another staff member while we were waiting at the hostess podium. We decided to leave and go down the street to Tacolicious.  Had a great time there and never coming back to this place.", "author": "Paula A."}

If you want good Tex Mex don't' settle for Chevy's when you could be here.\n\nThe ambiance is super Texas-y and southwestern; I loved the lights in the chili bunches and the big cow skull. I remember saying I liked every song that came on the radio (alt/rock, some Foo Fighters, Arctic Monkeys, Cold War Kids) so that's a HUGE plus.\n\nWe got the corn on the cob and mac and cheese to share, the BF got the burger and I got the kale tostadas. I'm not really a fan of kale but this was baby kale, which actually makes a difference I guess! It tasted more like arugula and it mshed well with the rest of the tostada. The mac and cheese was milder than I expected, and the corn satisfied my craving for grilled corn (om nom chili butter.) My bf got a little sick the night after we went, but I think it's because he has a weak stomach sometimes with spicy stuff :S  He enjoyed the burger, although was perplexed by the bun.

The service is really friendly, and they have mastered the balance of checking in with you enough so you don't feel forgotten, but infrequently so you don't feel bothered or rushed.  The restaurant is large and has a steakhouse vibe, which is great for getting a last-minute table (we made a reservation a few hours in advance, but I don't think the wait would be too long without one), yet it still doesn't feel like a chain.\n\nThey have a nice beer selection - I had the Wanderer IPA - and I hear their cocktails are great, although I didn't try one last night.  My friend and I ordered 3 plates to share: the enormous guacamole, crispy brussels sprouts, and the pork trio.  The guacamole was bland, and the chips were nothing special either (Casa Sanchez brand is better!).  It got better from there, however, with deliciously fried brussels sprouts up next.  The mayonnaise-y aoli was a bit heavy, but it came on the side so no harm done.  The main course, the pork trio, was awesome.  The confit and braised shoulder were flavorful, and the plantains were plantains (which is the highest form of praise considering how I feel about plantains).

Being from Texas, it's taken me awhile to make it back, but I said I would give it another go to try the new menu items and recipe adjustments and I like to keep my word.  \n\nWe went on a Thursday night and were seated in the bar area right away. They are now serving an amuse-bouche of radish, jicama and something else tossed with chili powder. . . I'm not sure. It was strange and I was concerned the dinner was not going to go well. Luckily the night went up from there. \n\nWe tried the queso again and it was much improved. The thickness was more like typical queso and it now comes with chorizo, green onions and red jalape\u00f1os which was a nice touch in my opinion. And the chips were great. Yay for real queso!\n\nI ordered the Coffee Rubbed Brisket Sandwich, which was pretty good. The meat was tender and it came with pearl onions on texas toast. It came some absolutely huge potato wedges (steak fries on the menu) which were pretty great and a side of slaw which was decently tasty. My date ordered the American Kobe Beef Bacon Burger, which comes on an English muffin. We both thought that was super strange, and not Tex-Mex-y, but I heard no complaints as it was being devoured. \n\nThe sopapillas are still missing the cinnamon sugar part, but they were still pretty tasty with the honey served on the side. I didn't get a chance to try the cocktails, so perhaps that's an excuse to return and try more of the improved menu. \n\nOverall, I am very impressed with the improvements made by West of Pecos. Oh, and the service was very much improved also. Our wait staff was on top of it and very friendly which always helps a dining experience. I still wouldn't consider West of Pecos real Tex-Mex, but whatever it is, I'm happy to say it was quite good this time around! \n\nOriginal Review:\nBeing from Texas I know good Mexican, Tex-Mex and BBQ. West of Pecos excelled at none of those things. \n\nThe do it yourself lemonade was terrible, the Goldrush adult beverage I ordered was mostly ice, the BBQ sauce for the ribs was not good, the hearth roasted pork carnitas was very bland and only half the plate was even tender meat, the roasted corn cherry tomato avocado cotija cheese salsa was basically mashed avocado with some cheese bits on top - no corn or tomato in sight. Unless you count the quarter piece of tomato that had stowed away amongst my pork.\n\n Oh, the queso was super runny so barely any stayed on the burnt tasting chips and who makes sopapillas without cinnamon sugar? At least they still tasted decent with some honey drizzled on too. \n\nLastly, our waitress was pretty MIA which never makes for a good experience. Needless to say, we will not be returning to West of Pecos.\n\nOriginal rating: 1/5", "author": "Emma A."}

Valencia St. was hopping at 10:30 at night and when we spotted the open outdoor table near the fireplace we headed in. Not so fast, pardner! The hostess was nice enough at first when she thought we were coming in for food but then dismissed our desire to sit outside. When we were similarly ignored at the bar we just went ahead and occupied the outdoor table. Our buddy took our drink orders and brought them back to our table himself. Okay, cocktails were good. I had a mezcal shot and it came with a little glass of sangrita (spicy and good) and a slice of orange. No coarse salt, like in Oaxaca, but decent. My friends had beers. Nothing to rave or complain about.\n\nSo why the two stars you might ask? It reflects the restaurant as a whole. It is a stunning example of \"fakeness\", ersatz, imitation, non-genuine fakeness of a Tex-Mex experience. The whole dang place. I might expect this type of staged, easy theme, blingy restaurant in, say, Kansas City or Cincinnatti, or yep, an airport! But on Valencia Street in the heart of The Mission? In a city known for artisinal, bespoke, GENUINE cuisine and decor? Frankly, we were horrified from the cheesy gas chiminayas to the crummy toilet paper holders made out of fake branding irons. Are you kidding me? Is this what we can now expect to happen all over the Mission? \n\nI am a big fan of The Woodhouse Fish Co. Which I have learned is behind West of Pecos. I am surprised.

Also, the service is fantastic (if not overattentive)!\n\nMy friend and I strolled in on a Tuesday evening -- easy-peasy to get seated immediately. We were placed in the bar section on a tiny table with high stools, not exactly ideal for eating. When I asked if we could move, the staff were extremely apologetic about not being able to accommodate my request, as the other tables were all occupied. Totally fine, I mean we hadn't set a reservation or anything.\n\nWe shared 3 appetizers:\n- Chips and guacamole = The chips were thick and crunchy, and the guac was chunky, creamy and at times sour. Seriously the opposite of boring.\n- Green chile mac & cheese = This was a no-brainer. I'm obsessed with mac & cheese; to add green chile to it seemed like a brilliant idea. And it didn't disappoint! Rich, creamy and a bit spicy, I was in heaven.\n- Kale tostada salad = We ordered this dish upon the recommendation of our waitress (bless you, lady!). It's now one of my new favorite salads in SF. Besides delicious kale and crispy tostada, there's black beans, cotija cheese, salsa and tomato vinagrette. Mmmmm.\n\nAlso ordered two margaritas each -- sour and perfectly made, though a bit pricey (made up the bulk of our bill). Definitely worth it though.\n\nTo top everything off, the manager sent over a slice of pumpkin pie (to apologize for not being able to move us earlier). So thoughtful and completely unnecessary, I have to admit I was touched! I'm not a dessert girl and I was full beyond belief, but I had a few bites and it was absolutely mindblowing. The crust tasted like it'd been glazed or something. Unbelievable.\n\nHad a wonderful evening here and would absolutely come back. I've already raved about the kale tostada salad to a few friends.

I've tasted their ribs too, which were great and very flavorful. \n\nIt has a great ambiance, so I'd recommend going for drinks (their margaritas are kind of strong) and snacks (I absolutely love their chips and queso and guac)!", "author": "Kim S."}

When I heard there was going to be a Southwestern restaurant opening, perhaps even focusing on New Mexico style food, I was really excited. I dearly love the green chile things they do down there, and was psyched to be able to get some locally.\n\nUnfortunately, this is most certainly not that. The only thing with green chile on the menu is the mac & cheese (?!), and it has barely any.  Sigh.\nOur grilled corn on the cob was tough and chewy. The ribs were also on the tough side.\n\nTheir cocktail menu has gone through quite a few changes since they opened, and I'm glad to say it's improved dramatically.

Whatever, it was great.\n\nThe food is just plain good. My wife had the flat iron steak and I had Margaret's pork chop. The steak wasn't as good as she remembers from a few months ago; either they changed how they prepared everything or (more likely) it's a completely different menu item.

I thought the food was good- the  cornbread was amazing!\nBut the service was awesome. You don't see a lot places like that in SF where they take ownership of bad experiences and fix it. Would recommend for that alone- Very large space- good for groups- we will be back :)", "author": "Nicole S."}

I'm ashamed to say that while I use Yelp on a daily basis this is my first review. (sorry!) \n\nFirst, I didn't expect this place to be authentic Mexican food at all. (I know my favorite burritos, tacos and salsa in town and would have headed there without a second thought.) My girlfriend and I were feeling nostalgic and were really aiming for basic tex-mex/american style food that we had growing up in the Midwest. The bar was low, guys. Long before I had real Mexican food, I grew up eating Chi-Chis, Chevy's, Don Pablos and Taco Johns. \n\nAll four of those places are better than West of Pecos. The service was terrible. The place was maybe half full and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Okay, that's fine, we'll wait. After being seated and being given menus our server asked immediately if we were ready to order. We asked for a few minutes to decide. Apparently that was a big mistake. We didn't see her for another 15 minutes to get our drink order. By then we were ready to order our drinks, appetizers and our meals. \n\nWe ordered margaritas, chips and guac/salsa, the steak fajitas, a salad and vegetable sides. Then the wait began. Literally nothing for 20 minutes. No drinks, no appetizers, no \"this will be out shortly\". Nothing. 20 minutes later they brought the margaritas, the chips, the guac, the salsa, the entrees and the sides all at the same time. The tiny table for two was completely full and the server was knocking things off trying to shove everything on us at once. \n\nAs for the food:\n-Nothing was seasoned. No salt on anything. \n-The steak sucked. We asked for medium rare and got rare on one end and medium well on the other. Completely flavorless. \n-Portions were tiny. For $21 the steak fajitas consisted of 4 slices of steak and a few pepper slices. They couldn't even bother to include onions. I'm used to overpaying for things in the Bay Area but come on.\n-Salsa was terrible. We asked for the mild and the \"spicy\". I couldn't tell which one was supposed to be spicy... I asked for hot sauce or a side of jalapenos as well. Anything with some heat. They brought me 5 slices of pickled jalapenos that were also bland. \n-The elotes was $7 for an ear of corn that tasted completely like sour cream. Thanks for cutting it into 4 pieces--that's not a hot mess at all. \n-The guac was flavorless (salt seems to be a crime here) and consisted of large (1/4 of an avocado) sized chunks of under ripe avocados. \n\nFinally we gave up and tried to waive down the check (took another 10 minutes). We knew that we were stuck with overpriced and bland food but couldn't believe the extra charges on the bill. Our $10 chips and guacamole included a $2 up charge because we asked for salsa. Really? That was annoying considering all of it tasted bland/the same but the best was that they charged us $4 for three tortillas. There was really nothing to do but laugh at what a joke this place is.\n\nOh and then when we went to pay for all of this crap, the server disappeared and my girlfriend had to go and find her. Because of course. \n\nTL;DR Overpriced, bland food with terrible service. Chevy's and Taco Bell are lovely compared to this place.", "author": "Chelsea P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-12", "description": "Worthy of a Pulitzer Prize for eloquence in short-form menu writing, the creators of West of Pecos clearly are aiming very high with this sleek, sprawling spot in a bustling part of the Mission.  Ultimately, the food satisfies but doesn't excel, and the mouth-watering menu sounds a good measure better than the results coming from the kitchen.  \n\nOf the range of items we tried, the scorched corn on the cob with sweet chile crema was the best, a take on traditional elote with a pleasantly balanced sweet and smoky feel.  We also enjoyed the grilled asparagus with ancho chile hollandaise and bacon, though the hollandaise overwhelmed the asparagus a bit, and I tend to think that the best asparagus dishes don't need so much jazzing up.\n\nOur carnitas were \"hearth roasted\", not pan-fried and crispy as with other versions, and the result was a less flavorful but more moist dish.  The generous portion of avocado/tomato/cotija \"salsa\" on the side was intriguing but lacked much punch.  The homemade corn tortillas on the side?  To die for.\n\nWe were less impressed with the green chile macaroni and cheese, a good concept with a startling lack of flavor.  We added salt to make it somewhat interesting.  Even with a plethora of intriguing ingredients, the Terraza Tostada Salad had too much going on and didn't really work.  What was advertised as creamy chive dressing ended up being, mostly, an awkward blob of sour cream underneath the salad.  \n\nI appreciate what this place is trying to do, and I may well go back, minding my own caveats - there were a lot of other tasty looking dishes on the menu, and in the hands of servers passing us by.  I just won't expect to be blown away, and I'm sure I'll leave with a smile.", "author": "Derek W."}

My friend said that he can't stand Mac and Cheese when it is too rich.  Needless to say, the green chili was what you tasted first, and the cheese second.  The Sopaipillias were amazing.  Just the right combination of sweet and flakey, we each at ours with only a few bites.  You have to order the Sopaipillias with your meal.  \n\nFor our big dishes we were told that the Ribs and Carnitas were the best things on the menu.  My Amigo got the carnitas, and ate every last bite.  The ribs are wonderful.  I have never had a pork rib that was individually prepared before now, and it made me question my cooking style.  Each rib was like a candied barbeque pork lollypop, or some nonsense like that. Seriously, they were super delicious.  \n\nThe biggest treat was dessert.  The Sopaipillia with ice cream and caramel was so good it disappeared in one bite.  The flourless chocolate cake was also very tasty, but as I am not gluten free it wasn't my favorite of the two treats that we enjoyed.  Each dessert was garnished with some fresh raspberries that were the perfect way to end the meal.  \n\nI never got to try any of their drinks as I was driving, but looking at what was on the menu I have got to return.  Great place, great service, wonderful atmosphere, delicious food, I am assuming great drinks, and we got out of there for about 30 bucks a piece.  Five stars, all the way.", "author": "Allen W."}

I got the Texas Ribs which had an ancho pepper/apricot sauce that was very nice, not too hot and not too sweet (the slaw on the side was sloppy but I was really only interested in the ribs anyway). Husband got the Green Chile Cheeseburger and he loved it, said it was cooked perfectly but the fries that came along with it weren't all that great. \n\nI guess when it comes down to it, their main dish is well executed and interesting but their sides need a bit of work. \n\nWith all the restaurants on Valencia, there are probably better options than West of Pecos if you're any bit of a food snob.", "author": "Littany W."}

Super crispy and sweet-and-savory at the same time.\n--Corn tortillas: Really good, clearly handmade. Perfect accompaniment to the albondigas.\n--Corn on the cob: Novel and flavorful, really good but not mindblowing.\n--Mac and cheese: I loved the cheese mixture in this, but thought it could be more well-seasoned.

I really like woodhouse and go there often (it's near my place) so I figured I'd like West of Pecos. Also, when I tried to go there a few times, it was really hard to get a reservation so I assumed the place was great. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.\n\nI went today and things started off well. My boyfriend and I got a huge margarita and chips with queso. The queso had chorizo in it and was wonderfully spicy. The margarita was light and really refreshing, but the serving size was a little deceptive. It came in this huge glass with 2 straws so it looked huge enough for the two of us, but was filled with large pieces of ice so it went really fast.\n\nNext up, we got the green chile mac and cheese and the duck flautas. Both were pretty under-seasoned. The mac and cheese was good, but would have been incredible with more salt. The duck was pretty underwhelming. It tasted like it had no spice in it. The best part of the flautas was the fire roasted tomato on the side, which was perfect.\n\nNext we got the lamb albondigas. These had the opposite problem. There was so much paprika and chilli in it that we found ourselves coughing with every other bite (and we're South-Asian, so we're used to smokiness and heat!). We only had one each and packed the rest to go, figuring we could put them over rice at home to tone them down.\n\nDessert was the tres leches flan. It was decent, but again could have benefited from a little bit of salt to bring out the flavors.\n\nOn another plus side, the staff was excellent. Our waitress was really friendly and had great recommendations and the bussers were fantastic.\n\nAgain, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's walkable from my apartment and I love tex-mex. But I feel really let down, and I'm not sure I would recommend it.", "author": "Saad A."}

It happened to be during Pride weekend and most places in the Mission were crowded and overwhelmed.  I had never heard of West of Pecos but it looked a little more relaxed, so we thought we'd give it a try.  There was a large bar area, and even though all the seats were taken, it didn't take long for some to open up.  The drink menu had a good selection, and the food smelled great.\n\nI ordered a shirley temple for my friend who wasn't drinking alcohol, and was shocked that the bartender said they didn't have any grenadine.  I don't know if they were out or if they don't stock it, but the bartender got creative and made a shirley temple with prickly pear juice...it actually tasted pretty good, and we loved the ingenuity.  \n\nI ordered the prickly pecos margarita at the bartender's recommendation, and couldn't believe how disgustingly sour it was.  Every sip I took, I literally couldn't stop myself from making the \"wow that's sour\" face.  The serrano pepper in the drink was actually a good flavor compared to the sour, and I don't normally like spicy.  I definitely wouldn't order this drink again, but it just wasn't for me.\n\nInstead, I wish I had gotten the mezcal mule, which I saw someone drinking after I ordered.  That seems to be the specialty of this restaurant, and it comes in a metal cup which just seems different.  Next time I will get that, and stay for dinner too!  It's always nice to see a new restaurant, especially when they're trying something new for the area.  I hope they do well, and look forward to coming back!", "author": "Gabrielle L."}

WofP also gave us a 45 minute estimate but the hostess told us that bar seating may be open. We got a nice cocktail table by the window and settled down to eat.\n\nDecor: I really love the theme and large open space. The place wasn't too dark (maybe because we were sitting by the window) and there was plenty of room to walk around. I really appreciate restrooms with sinks that don't require me to touch any part of the basin or faucet when I'm washing my hands.\n\nService: When she finally got around to us service was excellent. Food came out quite fast and water was always refilled.\n\nFood: Eugene and I ordered four small plates. \n\nStuffed artichoke ceviche: Great smoky flavor and decent portion size. Comes with a small salad with a vinaigrette that packs a tiny kick. We were a little unsure about how to eat this but the dish was delicious.\n\nGreen chile mac and cheese: Not too cheesy but the dish lacked flavor. I would suggest more salt and some hot chili flakes to spice the dish up.\n\nPotatoe wedges: For some reason I thought these were mashed potatoes. The dish comes with a sausage cheese sauce but this also needed salt and some kick. The wedges themselves were seasoned well with parmesan and sea salt.\n\nRibs: Ribs were very good. They were not the best ribs I've ever had (that title goes to Phil's in SD) but the dish was quite enjoyable. Just the right bit of tangyness but I would have like more wood smoked flavor.\n\nWest of Pecos is a nice place to bring your friends but be prepared to shell out some $ if you want to get full.

Service was friendly and prompt with pre-dinner cocktails & appetizers. And then our main courses never made it to the table. There were two servers attending us; one great, the other hopeless. Wires were obviously crossed, and when the good server finally got back to our table, she said our dinner order had never been put in. She apologized profusely & offered another round of drinks while we waited for our meals to be prepared. Very nice offer, but we were charged for these \"another 15 minute wait on top of an already 20 minute wait\" cocktails. Our main dishes were good; nothing stellar. Some portions were small; others were not. Most food items were overpriced; especially the slow-roasted pork enchilada with virtually no meat in the very, very small enchiladas. And they charged extra for rice & beans to accompany this already miniscule \"dinner!\" Will some restaurateurs never understand the importance of consistently good service & food before they have to close their doors forever?

I've tried around 10 dishes so far and they are ALL near perfection. The seasoning and concoctions are pretty amazing. I love menus that think outside the dining box and this place certainly does that! The drinks are also so interesting and worth a try. I'm not big on drinking beer/cocktails unless they're really sweet (it's my tastebud's fault I promise!) but my friends who have tried their bar menu have all really enjoyed tasting each drink. The bartenders have all been great to order from as well.\n\nThe staff is always exceptional. Smiles, greeting, checking in on their tables, able to accommodate their customers. Their text-reservation system is GREAT. We walked in on a busy Saturday night and was told their was at least a 45 min wait, we put down our name and headed over to Blondie's for a drink. We \"pardners\" (hah!) were texted 20 mins later with an open spot! Really good and new kind of system. \n\nThe decor is one of my favorite aspects here. I'm a sucker for chic interior decoration and this place rides that fine line most country western/tex-mex restaurants fail to find. There's no cheesiness here. Except...for maybe the security cameras that have little cowboy hats on...and if you don't think that's hilarious than you have no soul haha. Always something new to look at. \n\nThe average restaurant-goer here are 30's and uber professional. A group next to us were discussing their upcoming trip to Sundance for example. Each table and party I've witnessed in the background have all been polite and respectful. I have yet to see any young trashy college party-ers here like a previous reviewer mentioned. \n\nThe only negative aspects that I could find from my own personal experiences were that the fries and ketchup together were too spicy (to enjoy the actual flavor) and when on a romantic date next to the fires in the available outdoor spots out front, we encountered \"the Mission.\" Being pandered for money, a rude hipster walked up to our table, stood between us and our waiter, grabbed our table candle, and lit his joint, smell of urine, ciggy smoke, crazy people, drunks, etc. This of course is at NO fault of the restaurant. But we definitely know for the future to dine inside. \n\nGreat service. Different menu. Chic western decor. Interesting drinks. Easy location to get to. And pure yumminess!", "author": "Aura O."}

The mac & cheese was fine but nothing spectacular other than a scoop of green chile that my friends carefully avoided after their first unexpected bite of fiery heat.\n\nLikewise, the green chile burger was not what I expected.  Burger patty with a big piece of green chile covered in a tortilla (instead of a bun).  Didn't mind the unusual take of the burger but I just thought the patty was dry and the chile wasn't that impressive.\n\nBut to end on a good note, I did have a bite of the sopaipilla (puff pastry sprinkled with honey) with ice cream, which was delicious and brought back memories of my time in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.", "author": "F.

It was a surprisingly warm summer type evening in November and all the restaurants along Valencia were packed with people in shorts and t-shirts enjoying cocktails. Our original destination (Tacolicious) was something like a 2 hour wait, so we worked our way back towards the car looking for another place. I think both of us had Mexican food on the brain, so we gravitated towards West of Pecos which looked like it had some room at the bar. \n\nAt first, I was a little hesitant to eat at West of Pecos because it looked a little bit like a chain restaurant with its instant TexMex deocrations. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that in a necessarily bad way. The place is very nicely decorated and clean and inviting, but I kind of like eating off the beaten path a little when I'm in the Mission. Anyway, I couldn't have been more wrong. We sat at the bar and both of us ordered the carnitas. The dinner came with a very generous serving of roasted pork in a delicious barbecue red sauce with a side of avocado and freshly made tortillas. The whole thing was really delicious and my friend who is a bit of a restaurant snob even gave it a resounding thumbs up. \n\nOur waiter was really efficient and nice and kept our drinks filled.

Keep that in mind and you'll enjoy the food more.\n\nWest of Pecos is in a double storefront, making at a huge space by mission standards, and they needed the space; on a Friday night it was really busy including a party of 20.

I like the service uniform of Tshirts and/or western shirts and jeans.  \n\nTequila selection was very impressive; no Patron, no Cuervo-owned labels, and a couple of Tequilas I hadn't heard of before (amazing, considering the amount of tequila I've drunk).  Order it straight up!\n\nFood was mostly quite good.  Pluses and minuses:\n\nGood:\n* Chips + Guacamole: avocados mashed to order.

I like it.\n\nNot-so-good:\n* \"Caesar\" salad: Southwested up with pepitas and stuff, more wierd than good.\n* Chile Relleno: unmistakeable leathery texture of reheating destroyed any other flavors.   Flavorless, mushy batter.\n* Spice: nothing on the menu was at all spicy.  Yes, you want and need mild options for folks like my sweetie.  However, you should also have OMG hot stuff on the menu for me ... or at least offer housemade hot sauce.\n* Dessert: the 3 desserts on offer had zero to do with Mexico, Texas or New Mexico.  Where's the Flan?  Tres Leches Cake?  Sopapillas?  Or even ice cream?\n* Noise: LOUD!!  Open kitchen, huge restaurant, 100% plaster and hard surfaces.\n\nThen came the main drawback: a light meal for 2 people, including a couple drinks but no dessert, came to $90 with tip.  That puts them firmly in \"fancy restaurant\" prices.\n\nAnyway, a good start on a new cuisine for SF and the Mission.

I could barely hear what she was saying & she had no life in her whatsoever.  We ordered chips & guac, which was good however our server disappeared after we received the order for at least 15-20 minutes.  We had not even ordered our food yet & she was nowhere to be found!  Then, she finally came back around to us and took our order, all of which I needed to make sure had NO CHEESE in them.  She immediately verified that they did not, but then told us the flatbread could not be made without cheese-Disappointment #1.  Then 10 minutes later she comes back and tells me they JUST started putting cheese in the Flautas, so she asked if we still wanted them.  Well, considering I told you I cannot have ANY dairy/cheese, the answer would be No.  Then our order came.  The tuna tacos had absolutely no flavor at all.  The sliders were delicious, however they were so soggy it seemed that they had been sitting around for way too long after being made.  The Peppers which I was so excited for were so bitter I could not even palate them & when I told our waitress about this she said \"oh yeah, sometimes they get that way\" (which is weird because I ordered 2 orders of these at Beso last week and NOT ONE was bitter!)  The brussel sprouts we ordered were good, but not great, although they were my second favorite thing we ordered.\n\nWe could have eaten more, but were not very excited about the experience so decided to end the meal there and call it a night.

We got a salad, green chile mac n cheese and the lavender duck breast to go along with a few margaritas and I was ready to rave about the place. The salad rocked, the mac n cheese was dangerously good and the duck was perfectly cooked. \n\nI went back two nights ago and we had an heirloom tomato salad, mac n cheese and the pollo al carbon. The salad was light and fresh but the mac n cheese wasn't as good. It was too mushy and needed to be cooked a bit longer. The chicken looked mouth-watering but was more ok than awesome. \n\nThere's a lot of thought put into the food here, or at least there was in the menu and I really appreciate that. The New Mexican food has its own style and I think this place could become special. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure the execution is there every night yet and for the prices they're charging, it has to be. On the plus side, you and a date could easily split one of the main plates and a few appetizers and be satisfied because the portion sizes are really generous. \n\nGood stuff but could be better.

What a pretentious place and an embarrassment for the neighborhood. The place  was packed when we arrived . It was a Friday night around nine so, we expected to have to wait for a table - not a big deal. We figured we would wait in the bar. Since it was my turn for the next round I went to the bar to order my drinks. I found a spot to wait to order my drinks and I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited ..... There were two bartenders behind the bar. Not one looked up to say \"hey, be right with you\". As I was standing there for over twenty minutes , my two friends managed to order our drinks from a waiter . As I continued to stand at the bar a customer sitting at the bar said to me \"been waiting for while , huh\". I said \"I guess I don't have blonde hair and big tits\" now that got  the asshole bartenders attention. He looked up and said \"take it somewhere else\". Mean while the guy that took our drinks forgot and walked by us at least five times and ignored us. We were like \"what the hell\".  We finally flagged him down asked if he had forgotten our order. He just said \"I'm busy\" so why take our order then. I spoke to the manager , clearly inexperienced , and had no idea how to handle it. Sorry doesn't help - fix the service problem. That's what you do . \n\nWill never go there again and will make sure my friends in the foodie blog world write about what an embarrassment to the SF food culture West of Pecos is.", "author": "Rob M."}

It isn't overly spicy and has a great flavor, the kicker, it's burnt orange in color. I've never had a burnt orange hot sauce but I like this one. This place from top to bottom is just great. They have a wide variety of seating options: two outdoor tables with little fires by each, private dining room seating and a good sized bar with huge windows that look on the street. We were lucky enough to get one of the tables outside, the little fire kept us at just the right temperature and increased the ambiance by volumes. \nThe specialty cocktail list is really nice. They have a selection of 4 hand crafted margaritas as well as 5 other speciality cocktails. Combined my group had almost one of each and every single person was more than happy with each drink. Our server was nice enough to recommend different drinks for us and each time she picked just right. The service was friendly and efficient!\nWe had the queso and guac as starters and each was devoured in no time. I had the fish tacos and was pleasantly surprised, this is when the hot sauce really won me over. We also tried the green chile cheese burger and the artichokes, everyone was very content. The portions are good sized, I recommend sharing if you aren't super hungry. \nI really recommend this place for a Tex-Mex dinner. There's a great variety that exists here that allows the diner to set the mood of their experience. I rarely see this type of flexibility in one location. I recommend it for parties under 10 or for casual dates. If you're waiting for a table one of the bartenders will happily make you a drink while you wait.\nThe only con for me was in the men's bathroom their was a rattle snake skin that had an alligator head sewn on it.

I ordered the fish tacos, and he ordered the roasted artichoke, stuffed with crab and shrimp.\nThe artichoke was good, nicely cooked and flavorful...the crab was tasty.  The shrimp could have used a little work, as there were pieces of the tails on some of the shrimp still.  Other than that, the artichoke was good.  My fish tacos were delicious!  The fish was good, although I may have liked a breaded and baked fish instead of deep fried.  The cabbage on the tacos was pickled and added a nice flavor, as did the chipotle sauce.  I did have one suggestion for the tacos would be to use something other than lime wedges to hold up the two end tacos.  There were three tacos on the plate, and the two at the end were held in place by lime wedges.  When I got to the last taco on the end, as I picked it up the tortilla fell apart because it had become soaked in lime juice.  So, it made for a sloppy last taco, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  Food was great, service was prompt and friendly.

We invented the cocktail. When one travels abroad to say Europe or Canada, one realizes that bars must pour very weak 50 ML measured pours, resulting in shitty weak drinks. Perhaps this is why the English stick to beer. At any rate, West of Pecos subscribes to the penny pinching measured pour method with their Margaritas resulting in you guessed it; a shitty, weak Margarita. I'll cut to the chase... We spent 68 fucking dollars on 2 pitchers of the stuff. When we politely told the very courteous waitress that the Margarita was weak, we were told that we had to purchase an extra shot for 7 more dollars.. This resulted in over 70$ worth of Margarita. This is totally unacceptable. One door down at Puerto Allegre, one never complains of a weak Margarita.

Ok, not a problem as it was busy and that's a normal wait. The hostess took my bf's cell # and we were told that he would receive a text when our table was ready. We went across the street to get drinks.....an hour and a half later, we still had not received a text.\nA little tipsy and extremely hungry we went back in to find out why we never received a text. The restaurant was now half as full. The manager apologized that we never received our text and sat us immediately. He even sent over complimentary guacamole and chips.\nI'm not a guacamole person, so I asked if we could get salsa. I was told they don't have salsa. WHAT?! This is a TexMex restaurant, right? I have family in Texas and have eaten at various restaurants in the South West and never have I come across a place that did not serve salsa. No bueno!\nSo finally we order and our food arrives. My boyfriend ordered a burger, done medium well and I ordered the ribs. \nMy ribs were dry but the sauce was good, so I ate it. The portions are not that great for the price and definitely would not pass in Texas.\nMy boyfriend's burger on the other hand was basically raw, to the point that it crumbled when he bit into it. He was so grossed out by it, that he lost his appetite and did not want another in exchange.\nOnce again the staff was extremely nice and the manager took it off the order. \nFinally we get our bill and are ready to blow that popsicle stand. Except that our bill came out to $58 and some change! \nMind you, the bill should have listed 1 entree and 2 bottles of beer. This was the last straw! We took it back over to the manager and he was super apologetic, removed the excess drinks that showed up and handed us a card for $25 to apply to our next visit.\n\nThe card is still in my wallet.

You can't come here without ordering this!), mango/avocado salad (very good; delicious avocado spread), bacon wrapped shrimp on a skewer (this was good, large shrimp and crispy bacon), cornbread skillet (soooo good. One of the best cornbreads I've had and came with a maple syrup), and the artichoke with crab (this is the one thing that I would probably skip next time.

By the time the three of us were ready, it was almost 230pm on Cinco de Mayo sunday. I wasn't optimistic, but they said they would fit us in with just a 20 minute wait.. That's better than i was expecting! But then after only about five minutes, they had a table for us, so, great! Service was very good the whole time. I also liked the tall backed chairs and  loved the southwestern decor. We shared the skilled cornbread to start. It had chile butter and you pour molasses over the top, which is the first time i'd done that. We all liked it, but not as much as I've seen people raving about. It was good, but not stand-out. I had the stuffed poblano chile (I usually get sweets for brunch but theirs didn't look too interesting). It was good, with a subtle smoky taste, but not too overpowering. I didn't realize I was very hungry, but this did not fill me up. My friends both got the dungeoness crab frittata. It looked small, but they both said it was more filling than it looked. I tried a couple bites since I was still hungry. The crab part was very good, the frittata part was fine, we all agreed, nothing special. We ordered drinks, which didn't come out til after the food was served. They had some interesting tasty drinks on the menu. My friend got the mezcal mary, which was really pretty. It wasn't super thick and foody like some bloody marys. I tried a sip and it was way too smoky for me, but I don''t generally like bloody marys. He does, and he enjoyed it. My other friend and I got another drink i don't remember the name of, and is not on their menu on their website right now, but it had egg white and was very fruity and pillowy, and slightly soda-y. It was pretty thirst quenching and not overpowering at all. I wouldn't even realize i was drinking alcohol vs a regular drink, so we both enjoyed it. My friend said that was his favorite part of the meal. I think mine would be my chilie, if there had been more to it. Overall, a nice dining experience, we all agreed that while we liked it well enough, it was nothing special and with all the great brunch places around, we'll not likely be back.

I had the stuffed poblano; a fire roasted pepper stuffed with eggs and some cheese served with a crema and fire roasted beans.  This was so delicious and the textures were perfect together.  I'd definitely order it again.  I loved the variety of cocktails that they offer with brunch.  They have savory and spicy cocktails too, beyond bloody mary's, which I prefer to sweet drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-14", "description": "Let me first start by saying that I really like this place. I come here at least twice a week for either happy hour or brunch. Unfortunately, my latest experience here could not be more disappointing.  Four of us showed up at 6 pm on a Friday evening.  We had been wanting to try one of their cactus bowls for some time and this was the perfect opportunity.  When we arrive we notice the main room in the restaurant was half full and the bar area was almost at capacity.  The tables inside the bar area were almost all filled except for one.  This table however has had a sign saying that you had to be seated by the hostess.  In my experience most bar tables are first come first serve.  I speak with the hostess and tell her that the four of us would like to sit there.  She proceeds to tell me that it is a full service table and that we would need to order food to sit there.  I respond asking well what if we are going to buy a $65 cactus bowl.  She said she would have to see what she could do.  So I go back to my friends in the bar and tell them what's going on.  Meanwhile a group of four people who were actually there ahead of us and wanting to do the same thing left.  We get the attention of a server working in the bar area and tell her we would like to sit there.  She says she is going to talk with the hostess and see what's going on.  When she comes back she tells us she can't seat us because it is policy on Friday and Saturday to have these seats for groups who are going to eat food.  First off, I get it.  It's not beneficial to their business to have a single person come into the bar, sit at a table and sip on a few drinks over the next few hours.  In this case though you gotta be kidding me.  You had one group just walk out, we are there saying we want to spend money, and your restaurant side is only half full.  Policy or not, if I'm running this place I make sure you are seated.  I seriously haven't been this disappointed since the Warriors lost games two and three to the Cavs in the finals.  The waitress then says we can sit at the bar.  The only problem with that is there are only two seats there.  Obviously ordering a large cactus bowl is not going to work.  There were a few more exchanges and when it became apparent that she was not going to budge we went on our way.  That is two groups of people they lost.  I wonder how many people came in after us and did the same thing?  I really want to keep going here because they have great drinks, happy hour, and brunch.  Sad to say I will be thinking twice next time.  When your \"policies\" turn away regular customers something needs to give.  In this case it looks like we will need to find somewhere more accommodating.", "author": "Brian B."}

Loved this!\n-- pozole, $8: as much as I love my female bff's homemade version, WoP's lighter rendition made me eternally happy; no visible fat bubbles floating in the broth-yay!

Loved the sweet chili cream. Cut in smaller pieces, so as not to get your face all messy. \n--grilled pacific prawns, $15: three humongous prawns, topped w/ tomato & avocado on three mini tortilla rounds. Awesome cucumber salsa. Get this! \n-- carnitas, $14: bf couldn't decide between this & the steak. I don't eat a lot of pork, but this lean pulled pork looked appetizing & 'safe.' (Those who know my crazy meat issues know what I mean.) I loaded up a tortilla w/ it & the avocado/corn/cherry tomato salad & was a very happy girl! So much flavor! \n\nThe three desserts did not tickle our fancies, so we passed. However, we will be back to try the steak, chile relleno, cornbread & ribs.

We tried a pitcher of the La Flama Verde margarita, which is a cucumber/ jalape\u00f1o margarita. It was pretty yummy!! We also ordered the chips and guacamole... OMG!! By far the best guacamole I have ever had!! In fact we ended up with a second order. I had the Lobster enchiladas, and was disappointed. It's supposed to be dinner, but no rice and beans... All I got was 2 very small enchiladas. My friend ordered the St Louis Ribs, and she got a whopping 3 very small ribs and that's it!! My other friend ended ordering the fried chicken. This plate came with mashed potatoes, collard greens and 3 pieces of chicken, but she was disappointed also. The chicken was dry and the greens weren't very tasty.

It's huge, so it can accommodate dates of 2 people, or bigger parties of 6-8 that I occasionally find myself in.  \n\nI love the bar.  The bartenders are top notch and it ranks as one of the best Old Fashioned's in the city, which is the drink I use to rate bars since it's so variable how people make it.  They also serve beer in these HUGE iced goblets which I think is awesome.  The bar is large enough and with enough standing space that I don't feel the need to go elsewhere while waiting for my table.  (it's usually a bit of a wait, they've been packed since they opened).\n\nFood. I love it.  I like the Maple Turkey Flautas and Guacamole for starters.  The Flat Iron Steak and the Carnitas were excellent main dishes, and I'm a huge fan of their new margaritas.  It's the kind of food that is tasty, but not so off the edge that it becomes a once-every-six-months type of place.  A bunch of the other great spots in the Mission kind of fall in that category for me, either because of the food-type or the price. Is it Tex-Mex? No.  I lived in Texas for 4 years, and this place definitely has Texan roots but with a California edge. But then, with all the mexican food in the mission, I'm guessing I really enjoy this place because it's not a typical taqueria, and I can sit down and have an nice meal, and still feel like going back.\n\nThe owner is always floating around and is super-duper friendly.

I'm a big fan of a small plates, so I thought the food came in the right proportion and not so overwhelmingly large as you'd get in the Midwest or the East Coast. Duck tacos were quite a nice size and tasty. I am not a connoisseur of southwestern cuisine, so I liked this induction by my dinner companion. My dinner companion ordered margarita with prickly pear, the color of the drink was a bit pink and pretty unusual, and it tasted good. I don't generally drink California wine and they didn't have any old world red, but they did have one red from New Mexico which I thought was interesting, as I never had it.

Much of my review, however, is not centered on anything that has to do with being a vegetarian, if any of it.\n\nMy friend is not a vegetarian and is the one who wanted to go here. They held my resie for 30 minutes after the time because I made sure to keep them informed of the horrid traffic on 101 and the amazing lack of parking in the Mission (to unusual levels) that evening. Because of my courtesy, they reciprocated, which was very very kind and professional of them. \nThey were very packed for a Thurs early eve time, but we got a cute seat near the kitchen area. The decor was odd and sparse, but in a rustic way that kind of worked. \nThe service all around was friendly and helpful, but sparse and had huge gaps in between when service was actually needed. Service was not consistent and there seemed to be limited communication between servers. Just to pay, took about 25 minutes to even find someone to give us the bill. /\nI do not like cocktails that are not sweet, fruity, sourish..... I am a total chick like that. I asked the waitress if there even was such a cocktail on their limited cocktail menu that could possibly fit my need and she suggested the Mezcal Mule. She said it had \"kick\" and was sourish. She also said it had a slight smokey flavor and she loved it. I was intrigued and decided to try. Please note: I have never ever sent any cocktail back in my entire life (I am 34) and was even willing to just give it to my friend who has never rejected a cocktail in his life. I take the first sip and thought I might spit it up. He tried it and his face went dead. He said \"Okay, try not smelling it as you sip it\". Right then I knew I was not going to be able to even drink half. I tried two more time, however, because I was finding it hard to believe that they'd serve a completely undrinkable drink, but YUP! They do! It tasted like this (and I am not trying to be remotely over dramatic nor funny): The essence of burnt rubber, tar, and about 90% turpentine. It tasted and smelled precisely like that and was the most horrendously, putrid and vile drink of the planet! My friend motioned over for the waitress and had her replace it with something consumable. \nI got a iced tea'lemonade thing and the waitress offered to put some rum in it. I said ok and waited and about 15 minutes later some guy came over with a shot of rum and starts walking  away. I stopped him and ask where the rest of the drink it, he looked bewildered and took it away to go find it's counterpart. 10 more minutes go by and some other dude comes over and sets the same class of rum down and I stop him and say \"Ok, this is what happened 1o minutes ago. I did not order just rum. The waitress said she's put this in my iced tea and lemonade mixture.\" He said \"I will look into it\" as if there was anything to \"look into\". Finally they get it right and my drink was at least palatable.\n\nAs for the food: we had ordered the grilled asparagus right away and it took a good 30 minutes just to get it,. Thank god we had ordered gauc and chips before, or we would had been famished! The guac was the only worthy thing we got. It was killer and worth getting to go, \nOther than that, I go the veggie skillet which was not an entree, though on the entree section. It was small and appetizer sized. The only reason I even got filled was due to the tortillas. My friend got the lobster salad and said it was average. We would had order dessert, but they really don't have a real dessert menu. 3 things and two of them are so below average for a dessert menu that they can't even be considered dessert. \n\nIf you love faux cowboys screaming in opposing rooms at the tv like wild animals, grotesquely horrendous cocktails, below average food...then this is the place for you!!!!!!", "author": "Unicorn U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-07", "description": "Finally got to try out this newish outpost by the folks who bring us Woodhouse Fish Co. last night.  Some friends took me there for my birthday and it was one of the best gifts ever.\n3 of our group (out of 6) arrived about 1/2 an hour before our reservation, because we had heard good things about the cocktails and wanted to check it out.  At the early hour of 5:30, there was 1 bartender and 4 or 5 customers at the bar.  He was extremely attentive and charming, knowledgeable, and very patient in answering all of our questions about the unique cocktails and their ingredients.  All 3 of us chose the \"Vagabond\" based on the menu description and his explanation.  We all agreed it was one of the best and most unique cocktails we ever had.  When our 4th party member arrived, she ordered the Mule, which I tasted and also loved.  I can really see this refreshing fizzy blend of Pisco, ginger beer, and citrus served in a metal chuck-wagon cup as a perfect concoction on a warm afternoon.  Boutique cocktails are all the rage in SF right now, and the competition is stiff.  So are the drinks at West of Pecos, and at $9.00 ea. or so, a real bargain.\n\nBAR:  Product: *****   Service: *****  Vibe:*****\n\nWhen the rest of our party arrived, we were seated at a prime table at the back of the dining space.  Why was a back table prime?  We were about 12 feet from the open kitchen, so the 3 of us facing it had the extra pleasure of watching the chef, cooks, and staff work in perfect unison (and apparent happy mood, given the many smiles) to produce our food.  A grand pizza-style flaming oven (furnace?) stood at the far left of the line in which were cooking fresh house-made-to-order tortillas using a sort of peel to insert and remove them. We were watching a smooth and shiny kitchen staff having fun.  Word spread quickly around my table that very good things might be in store.\nA big plus about a group of foodie friends trying out a new SF restaurant is sharing tastes. Everybody gets to sample a lot more of the menu on the 1st visit.  Such was my good lot.  Even though carnivores, vegetarians, and allergic concerns were  among our party,we had no problem at all selecting a bunch of dishes that would give all a chance to share and explore.  How San Francisco is that? \nHere is what we ordered, and how we rated each dish.  Rating is *to*****, * being pretty bad, and ***** being amazing.\n\nAPPETIZERS:*****\n\nDUCK TACOS: ***** \nBeyond amazing.  We only ordered 1 order (3 tacos) with the aps.  nearly caused a riot at the table. Order one taco for every duck-eating member should be the rule.\n\nHOMEMADE QUESO AND CHIPS: ***** \nI doubt the chips are house-made (will ask next time), but they are really fresh and delicious and probably local.  The Queso dip obviously is, though, and a revelation for anyone who has secretly loved jarred or movie theater \"cheese\" sauce.  My table insisted on cleaning the bowl with their fingers before letting it leave the table. \n\nCRISPY PEPPERS:  ******\nAlthough this was nobody's favorite ap at my table, that had nothing to do with the quality or preparation.  The peppers were really tasty and great with the dip, IF YOU LIKE A BUNCH OF HEAT.  After the first one, unseeded, set my taste buds afire, I took the time to rid the rest of the peppers I ate of their seeds with my thumb before dipping and eating them and I loved them.  A little honest warning would allow the few heat addicts at my party to have a great experience without denying other palates equal opportunity to enjoy the dish.\n\nENTREES and SIDES: ****\n\nSPARE RIBS W/BOURBON-PEACH BBQ SAUCE:*****\nWithout a doubt the biggest of many hits at the table among the carnivores. A pretty sweet sauce, but balanced nicely with enough tang and heat to avoid being cloying. This successful balance of disparate taste elements was something we found in most of WOP's dishes.  The rib meat was perfectly moist and tender.  Added bonus: generous portion for the price!  Oh, and the side of mustard slaw rocked.\n\n1/2 ROASTED CHICKEN: *****\nI am going entirely on hearsay here,as the non-red meat-eating member of our party grew silent as soon as this dish was delivered to her, and happily shoveled it down while the rest of us tasted and traded dishes.  When I finally thought to ask her about it, she said it was as good a chicken dish as she had ever had.  Good enough for me.\n\nCARNITAS****\n2 people at our table ordered these.  They had great flavor and the salsa and fresh tortillas were exceptional.  I thought the meat was a bit drier and less tender than ideal, thus the withholding of a star.\n\nFLAT IRON STEAK*****\nThis was steakhouse worthy, but much more interesting.  Perfectly cooked with a great char and well seasoned.  Tender, juicy, delicious meat.\n\nThese folks know what they're doing.  Check it ou", "author": "Gary N."}

She ordered the Pecos Punch, which annoyingly came in a tin campfire cup and that I thought was carrying the motif a little far. \nThe food menu isn't too large and I have to say that I settled on the pork ribs, failing to be very excited about anything else. Said to be prepared with apricots, I didn't taste any. Came with a very dull tin bowl of brown beans. Ordered a side of cornbread baked with molasses that satisfied as comfort food. My lady ordered the flat-iron steak, cooked a touch rare, which spoke of attentive preparation and that ranged somewhere between okay and pretty good. \nThe bar television was showing 'The Three Amigos', albeit muted. The two of us had so far managed never to see this, and we watched intermittently while drinking and between chatting. Was a bit like cooking and eating at home, and this is perhaps where the comparison to Chevy's strikes true.

The ice tea is already $4, more than most places, and now you want to charge for refills?  Not happy about this, may have to rethink next time we go out for brunch.", "author": "Andrew L."}

It's actually surprisingly easy to get there for brunch; the hours for that are perfect, and the commute (if you take Van Ness to 16th) is quick and mostly painless!

The staff was friendly and cordial. The restaurant itself is on the larger side and while it was loud, you could hear yourself talking. My wife and I are vegetarians and ordered the puffy taco with plantains and kale, the kale enchiladas and the chile relleno. The puffy taco was fantastic -- the shell was flaky and the filling was flavorful. The enchiladas were delicious. Often times when we get enchiladas at restaurants we can't help but feel that we could replicate it at home. In this case, we didn't as the red sauce was comforting, full of depth (but not too bold), the kale filling was perfectly tender yet not too crisp or steamed and the whole dish came together quite well without relying on mounds of cheese to make it good. The only negative in the meal was the chile relleno which was a fire roasted pepper stuffed with assorted veggies (sweet potato, corn, etc) served with a side of bland beans and rice. We wouldn't get this again. Our friends ordered the mac and cheese which was spicy and had a nice kick. We would definitely come back here and got the sense it's a nice place for a mixed crowd of vegetarians and non vegetarians. Thus far, it was one of our better mexican dining experiences in SF.", "author": "T K."}

Needless to say, we should've left it at that.  We went back a couple weeks later with some friends and had the most awful experience. We went on a Saturday evening, and yes Valencia St is busy and we understand there's a wait time, places are crowded, etc. Once we were actually seated, we were so excited... that excitement slowly dissipated as we ended up sitting at our table for about 45 min before our order was even taken - had we not flagged down our server it may have been longer. Once we ordered (along with another round of drinks) we waited for another 40 min! Meanwhile, the restaurant is slowly clearing out and all the tables around us are getting their food. One of our friends actually got up to check on our orders, since our server - Megan - was nowhere to be found. The manager of the evening came by our table to apologize, stating that our order had gotten \"lost\" and our food was getting plated. Once we actually got our food, my order was wrong, but at this point I didn't even care because I was so hungry. Someone else in our party pointed it out however, and my dish was comped and I got a new (and correct) dish in a matter of minutes. Mind you, still no Megan. Everyone was less than impressed with the food and the experience overall, and we were ready to hit the road. Meanwhile, we finally see Megan check on her other tables around us and she completely ignores us. Once our plates are cleared we wait about another 15-20 min to get our check and AGAIN have to flag someone down for it. TERRIBLE! Seriously, worst service, and the food is OK.

If you're looking for a monster beer in an ice cold chalice you'll love this place.  My wife and I stopped by on a week night for a meal and some after work drinks.  The bar is huge and easy to get a drink.  If you're interested in tequila you won't be disappointed.\n\nMy wife wasn't so interested in chill-in at the bar so we were quickly seated for dinner.  We split the ribs, flat iron steak with a side of green chile mac and cheese.  As you can imagine the mac & cheese was tasty and the green chiles were definitely a welcome addition.  The ribs were the best part of the meal and one dish we'll be back for.\n\nBeing a mission regular, I look for the restaurants that are clean, good vibe, and great drinks.  I'll be back.  Maybe without the wife.", "author": "Todd W."}

Were warmly greeted at the door by Tyler and Dylan, who welcomed us and let us know that they save tables for walk-ins.\n\nGot a great table in the middle section of the very clean, modern and interesting space.  The place is popular with a trendy, young crowd, so it gets noisy by around 7pm.  It is a great place to talk with a friend over an early dinner.\n\nService was excellent and non-intrusive.  Our server, Mallory, was very helpful and knew the menu.\n\nMy friend does not eat red meat, so we tried some things I wouldn't usually order.  All the food was really good, and there were a couple of things that were memorable.  Also, my prickly pear margarita was excellent and had a spicy kick to it.\n\nSkillet corn bread w/molasses on the side is a must-have.  I'm not really a starch person, but I will order this every time that I'm there.\n\nCeviche stuffed artichoke - another memorable dish.  The same people own Woodhouse Fish Company and I order that version of this dish whenever I am there.  I enjoyed this one even more.  The aoli and salad dressing had a great spicy kick and the ceviche, including the octopus, was very tender.\n\nThe lavender duck, drunken beans and goat cheese salad were also very good.  Though when I return I look forward to trying some of their meat dishes.\n\nHappy to have this place in the neighborhood.", "author": "Megami F."}

I thought maybe he was just busy at first because he had about 5 server tickets he was tending to, but we felt like he could at least have let us know he saw us and say he'd be right with us but nope.  For about 10 minutes he just kept his head down and ignored us.  He only had two other folks at the bar and the restaurant really was pretty slow when we went in.\nWe finally decided to sit at a table in the bar area, hoping we'd give service quicker that way and a busser quickly brought us water and menus.  A server did come over and say she'd be right with us, so I was hopeful!  But another 10 minutes passed and... she still hadn't come back.  \nSo we decided 20 minutes was a little too long to wait for a drink in an almost empty bar... and went ahead and left.\nThe place was cute though, wish I would say we'd be back to give it another shot but that most likely won't happen.", "author": "M S."}

The food, while artfully described, was uniformly... underwhelming. Guacamole that seemed to consist of nothing more than chunked avocados, utterly bland posole with watery, defeated hominy; leathery, greasy flautas; a shrimp appetizer featuring mealy shrimp of extremely dubious freshness; a heap of carnitas that begged for some sort of flavor, but could only turn to an empty \"red sauce\" for assistance. Alll this eaten in the context of Navajo-style rugs, hokey beaded cow skulls and faux adobe. When you walk out, you're shocked to rediscover that you're right in the heart of San Francisco, not in a giant parking lot off an interstate exchange.  What a waste of a giant space in a prime location.", "author": "nicky c."}

The ribs were so spicy I could barely eat them and they were served with beans soaked in what looked/tasted like watery ketchup.  Someone at our table had to send their food back, as the pork chop that was served was a horrible cut of fat and literally had no meat.  How it even left the kitchen in the first place is beyond me.

Unfortunately we didn't have a reservation (which I highly recommend because they are usually quite busy) (happy for them) so we waited, and waited and waited. We were ready to leave when we saw the manager outside. (His name is Tyler and he is amazing!) He saw the disappointed look on our faces and immediately sprang into action (He has so much energy!) in attempt to remedy the situation. He asked us to please come back and allow him the opportunity to make things right. He went above and beyond! He immediately got us a table with appetizers awaiting us then brought out a pitcher of margaritas, he actually went even further and picked up the check for the entire meal. I am so overwhelmed by not just his generosity but his desire to keep his customers happy, ensuring they will return. I will return and I will tell everyone I know because I think it is so important to support local businesses especially when they care so much for their customers.  Thank You Tyler!

For drinks we had the mezcule mule and a strawberry like margarita. Don't order them if you don't like spicy cocktails. I typically don't but they were still pretty fresh tasting and tart. We ordered off the bar menu cause there weren't any seats left in the restaurant area. It was a full house for a Tuesday night surprisingly. Bar menu was nice because most items were actually under 10 bucks including the drinks. I ordered the burger, mac and cheese, and potatoes. No need to order the potatoes if you're ordering the burger as it comes with it already. The burger was bun-less and was wrapped in a warm tortilla with cheese and green chili. The burger meat was a bit too thick and a bit dry for my taste but the green chili was a nice touch and added that special twist to make the dish stand out. The potatoes that came with the burger were delicious. They were almost more like a crispy home fry, which is a good thing in my book. The mac and cheese was amazing here! A bit wet and runny but still very hot and crispy at the top. The cheese had a certain spice to it which made the dish feel unique. The servers and host were really nice and attentive. I asked for my burger to be cut in half and they brought it out on two separate dishes which was nice and unexpected. The decor of the place is very comfy and modern, way more swank than a Chevy's could ever be. It does feel kinda box like inside but I probably should just have another drink and stop staring at the ceiling. Would really love to check out this place again.", "author": "Charlie L."}

I love the atmosphere, the service and the friendly wait staff. The menu continues to evolve, but the cornbread served in a mini skillet and the green chile mac and cheese have delivered since the start and its tough to resist ordering those as appetizers whenever I'm there. I eat mostly veggie fare, and the veggie skillet is fresh and always cooked to perfection for me - and it's plenty of food to fill you up. They also do brunch now, which. I've started waking up salivating on Saturday mornings thinking about West of Huevos, which is there version of Huevos Rancheros. The red chile sauce is what makes it.

In my entire 20 year history of living in San Francisco, I have never had a margarita as bad and distasteful as the one I had here.  While waiting for our table to be ready next door at Puerta, we decided to pop into West of Pecos and try a margarita.  Worst mistake of my life.  At first we thought that $8 for a margarita was a bit pricey when compared to next door.  There was three of us and we all ordered margaritas.  When it arrived at our table, we were completely shocked as to the size of the glass.  The size was ridiculous.  It must have been about the size of a training cup for a small child!!!  No kidding.  Next, at least 85% of the glass was filled with large cubes of ice...!!! The next 14% was some awful sour mix and then just a hint of tequila..!!! None of us were happy with this so called margarita and one of us expressed his opinion with the bartender who didn't seem to care take the feedback seriously.
