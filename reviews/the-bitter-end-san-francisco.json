It was my first time and I loved it! I loved the bar environment, it was very inviting and social while still having a slightly-divey feel to it, which I really enjoy. There were no seats at the bar so we seated ourselves at one of the tall tables, of which there was plenty. We ordered a couple rounds of drinks - me with my usual G&Ts and my boyfriend got whiskey gingers. All our drinks were well-made, fairly strong (which we appreciated!) and reasonably priced. I think maybe $8 per drink which considering we were in SF is a pretty good deal to me. Also the bartender on Friday evening, who I believe is also the owner, is wonderful and very friendly, which makes the experience that much better. \n\nWe did order some bar bites since we had skipped dinner, which were pretty basic and tasted like food from any other bar, but not bad by any means! I'm sure we'll be coming back here lots - it's my new favorite bar in the Inner Richmond for sure!", "author": "Abi R."}

This was our fourth and final stop, thank goodness. I was totally wasted but was still able to enjoy and observe what I love about this bar... the upstairs area. My friends and I grabbed our beers and headed upstairs where there were a few tables and no one else. Everyone was enjoying the game on the TVs downstairs.\n\nThis is a super divey and inexpensive location, which I appreciate. Not somewhere I'd opt to order cocktails unless it was a simple well drink. The beer selection is acceptable. There's even food! I probably should have ordered some of that. Definitely a hot spot to watch the game and hang out with your buddies. This isn't really my first-choice pub, but I'm glad I was able to check it out!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I remember going there during the late 90s/early 2000s and it's good to see that they are still around. It still had that cozy, slightly-divey feel to it, that I like so much. There were plenty of open tables and I was glad.  It was a Saturday night and I wasn't in the mood to be in a standing room only joint shouting in my friend's ear to converse.\n\nThe key elements of a good neighborhood bar: bartender who isn't stingy with alcohol, good music, a regular crowd (no hipsters/no gangstaz/no techies).  This is the kind of bar to drink, chew the fat and be merry.  I've been to hipster bars, gangster bars and techie bars.  They're fine, but I've always been more comfortable in dive bars.  Anyway, this bar fills the bill.  I had a pint of Stella and the lady had a cocktail.  I took sip of hers and the alcohol was nice.  We spent a couple of hours there, and I could've stayed there longer but didn't want to be out too late on the Thanksgiving weekend (maximum enforcement period for the Po-Po).  I saw a few patrol cars drive by and even stop right in front of the bar to have a converation with a rowdy bunch outside.\n\nI don't go to bars nearly as much as I used to, but still love a places like this.  If you're looking for a pub that has a good selection of booze and just quiet (or not noisy) enough to carry on a converation.  This is a good chill spot if you're in the area", "author": "Rich H."}

I don't have anything negative to say about The Bitter End.  At the same time, if someone asked me where to go grab food in the Inner Richmond, I wouldn't recommend that they make it a priority to visit.  \n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of any place where you can sit at the bar, grab a beer or a cocktail, watch some TV and order some food.  This is your place.  You can come for either Pub Food or for Brunch.  They have a solid selection of tap beer.  It's not quite an all on Sports Bar, but you can get a good look at TV's if that's your plan.  I've done the Burger here a couple of times and it's unexceptional, but not too pricey.  Likewise, I'd say the same of the Brunch.  I'm not saying anything overtly negative, but it didn't give me reason to be proactively positive.  I would definitely give the nod to nearby Richmond Republic Draught House in terms of food.  (Hearsay Food Review - I know someone who really seems to like the Sheppard's Pie)\n\nBar-wise, it's got some good things working in it's favor.  Full bar.  Laid back clientele.  Cool activities area upstairs with a couple of pool tables and darts.  The service seems friendly enough.  I've never found it to be overly crowded or loud.  The prices aren't too bad, either.  In short, you can certainly do a lot worse.  \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way, but this is an easy spot to grab a low key meal and a drink out on Clement Street.

But I guess \"The Safe, Pleasant End\" doesn't have much of a ring to it.\n\nWe were able to walk in without difficulty with like eight to ten people on a Monday night between 8 and 9. We got a nice row of tables downstairs and pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. This is a great thing for a neighborhood bar. The bartender was nice, if I remember correctly, and I think I had one or two Racer 5 IPAs. The beer selection was decent, though I thought 540 Club's was better.\n\nI also ate dinner here, choosing, for whatever reason, the grilled salmon with salsa. My friends gave me shit about ordering salmon at a pub when there were so many pubby items on the menu, but I must've been in the mood for some healthy-ass grilled fish? I don't know. I enjoyed it in any case. Not the kind of entree you'd come to The Bitter End to consume, but a moderate $12.50 and was perfectly serviceable. It came with some kind of a vegetable medley and a choice of garlic mashed potatoes or french fries.

It was always crowded but never felt like a truly engaged community. The Bitter End reminded me of my favorite local Irish pub back in Seattle and I immediately fell into its shabby-chic embrace. \n\nFrom the outside, it looks like your standard issue Irish pub but it's surprisingly spacious with two floors of seating. There's ample booth space so showing up at 8 pm for a 9 pm trivia (Tuesday evenings), I had my Goldilocks' choice of places to sit. The waitresses have friendly Irish lilts and flit about at just the right time to re-fill pitchers and clear away plates. The food is nothing to sneeze at (think curry fries that tasted a bit like gravy, Shepherd's Pie, etc) but the beers on tap are a plenty!\n\nNow for the trivia format: never underestimate how much time is saved by having another team grade your answers. We're all grown-ups here; (most) of us wouldn't cheat. The team name with the most crowd-whooping reaction (usually as un-PC as possible) gets a round of shots on the house with the top three places receiving cash monies ranging from $10 to $30. There was a healthy mix of topics covered from presidents to history to music and pop culture. Bonus: a live musician decided to pump up the trivia goers with some sing-alongs, just for kicks and giggles. Camaraderie? It's here in spades!", "author": "Faith Y."}

He then asks me what my birthday is and what my address is to verify that it's my ID. Then he starts to hand it back and bends the hell out of it and says that it feels flimsy, implying that he doesn't believe it's real. Maybe because I still have the old style of California ID and perhaps it's thinner than the new ones, but if you're going to hardcore accuse someone of having a fake ID, at least know what all current state IDs look and feel like that are in circulation. I can't be the only person without the newest version of the California ID. \n\nMy point isn't to make a complaint about being carded, though. I really don't mind being carded because I know it's the bar's responsibility to keep underage people out so I'm not disappointed with that. But the bar tender's accusatory tone/attitude and the fact that he seemed SO determined to prove that my ID was fake were completely unnecessary and really rude. It's really possible to be firm, but still respectful, but this bar tender definitely wasn't the latter.

It's not a place to \"be seen.\" Sure, you might run into some attractive patrons, but nobody gets dolled up to go to the Bitter.

Here, the drinks are fast, cheap, good and the well liquors are premium. They serve food beginning at 5p.m. and the menu ranges from pub grub and beyond. I ate the curry chicken fries, and have been jonesing for them ever since.  Freshly prepared French fries, smothered in gravy like curry sauce and small bits of chicken laced throughout. On the other end of the spectrum, my boyfriend had salmon and steamed veggies.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is the best of what dive bars represents; a medieval knight hanging from the ceiling, dust bunnies trailing from his mask, deer heads with Medusa like snakes coming out, televisions, pool tables, a juke box and walls buried under kitschy memorabilia and a collection of taxidermied things.This bar is well worth the journey.

Very helpful and friendly staff.\n\nMake your way upstairs and you'll find a pool table that was missing a que ball, an apparently broken pinball machine, and an area with two dart boards. The positive aspect of the upstairs is their high-quality darts, a rare find in my opinion. The downside is the lighting--it's downright terrible.

We didn't realize it starts at 9PM and we arrived at 7:30. By then, the bar was pretty packed, with only a few seats and tables open. \n\nThe waitresses here are very friendly and helpful. We asked about Trivia Night and one of them gave us a pretty detailed description about how it works. Because it was still Happy Hour, we decided to try all 3 different flavors of cider. I've never had cider before, but it's really just like sparkling cider with a hint of alcohol. Out of all three flavors (pear, apple, and raspberry), I prefered the pear. At only $3/glass during HH, that was a pretty good deal in my mind. \n\nExpect an extremely loud environment. I guess that's the bar-scene but I'm not quite used to it.

The bartenders are extremely friendly with awesome Irish accents. The beer is nice and cold, and the ambience of the place is great. There are two levels, with the bar being on the first, and two pool tables on the second. It's nice to go with friends for a quick drink at night, and to play some pool.\n\nOnly thing I'd have to complain about is the fact that the pool tables are really close to the walls. You'll have to struggle a little to hit without scratching the game, because you'll literally have to tilt your stick at a 45-degree angle to avoid the wall.", "author": "Jason T."}

Don't take this to mean I do not have strong feelings about this place, I do.\n\nFirst off, the bar itself.  No Smithwicks so not going to be my favorite Irish bar, but on cold nights in the Richmond, the little fireplace is a nice touch.  A rickety pool table is also good to pass the time.  I actually like the place to come in and grab a calm drink.  Would have given it 4 stars based on that, except for: \n\nTriva night.\n\nMy hat goes off to Tim for running one of the best ones I've been to.  The pace and his humor running it were spot on.  Really a ton of fun.\n\nEXCEPT FOR THE RACIST CROWD\n\nI don't mean one or two little crowds of insecure fratboys, but rather, the whole crowd on Tuesday August 29th.  Here is why:\n\nAs you all know, you have to have a clever (and likely off color) name to be a successful pub quiz team.  It is a fine line.  For example \"You, Me, Dupree and this Empty Bottle of Percoset\" is perfect.  \"Owen Wilson is almost as Dead as His Career,\" not quite as funny.  \n\n\"Gone-Gone-Gonzales\" references a current event, should garner a good cheer in liberal San Francisco, but ultimately not all that clever (but still a good name). A team name like \"Your doing a heck of a job Gonnie\" would have been funnier in my opinion (referencing Mike Brown former head of FEMA and bush crony).\n\nHere is what is NOT funny. \n\n\"Now Alberto Gonzales can tile my bathroom for $2 an hour.\"\n\nWe all understand what this means, and I really don't have to go into it. But, whenever this team name was mentioned, there was the loudest cheer from the crowd. By far. raucous cheering. \n\nI know what you are thinking, people are happy that he was gone.  There were other team names that referenced his departure, but this is the only one that employed a racist stereotype.  Even after Tim pointed out that the cheers were making SF look less tolerant than Texas, people still cheered.  F'in clueless.   \n\nI am Chicano, and the first generation not to be a migrant farmworker.  I am proud of my family's history, and think that the work is honerable.   That means that I think that the guys that stand on the corner looking to \"tile your bathroom\" deserve your respect. To all you spoiled little USF students in the bar, the people picking up trash, cleaning your classrooms, and keeping your pristeen little campus manicured deserve your respect.  And they deserve more than $2 an hour. \n\nI am no fan of Alberto Gonzales, and understand better than most why he was so problematic.  I don't think he deserves respect, and I'm glad he is gone.  But that does not give license to denigrate a whole people through racist stereotyping.             \n\nTo the previous poster who thought that there wasn't racism in this bar, think again. Obviously more than a few Yelpers have noticed this. When a whole bar cheers for something like this, there are problems.", "author": "Nicholas E."}

As another Yelper mentioned, make sure you sit near the speakers or around the bar as their PA system isn't very loud.

The only downside is if you want a table during trivia make sure you get there early.  I took the advice of fellow Yelpers to get there early, which I arrived at 8 since trivia starts at 9 and there were no tables.  An hour before trivia every single table was taken.  Just be prepared to stand if you get to the pub close to 9.\n\nDrinks were cheap too!  I think they had some beers on tap for like $3 as their drink special for the night.

So I'm talking about that. \n\nBack to the coffee. I can only describe it as mud. Thick, opaque, and heavy on the Bitter End. Cream and sugar didn't help. We were pretty much the only people in the place and I didn't want to be rude to our very friendly server, so I closed my eyes and downed most of it through a straw. She probably caught on since I refused about five of her offers to refill my cup.\n\nAnd yeah, bad coffee is an indicator. As if the emptiness wasn't enough of a canary-in-a-coalmine, we should have taken the coffee as huge slabs of rock falling from the ceiling. We waited forever for our food (I didn't mind that, as they were just opening), which came out as 1) a runny gray-ish mess-of-an-omelet filled to the brim with watery tomatoes, day old avocados and a greasy glop of cheese and 2) an overcooked extra fatty steak. It may have been the most unappetizing food of my life.\n\nI wouldn't let this deter you from either trivia night, which I hear is a blast, or the shepherd's pie, which I hear is quite good.

Green walls, balcony, fireplace, spacious yet cozy thanks to the extensive front room, with 4 kinds of cider on tap and a lot of classic rock being played too loud to ignore, but not too loud to talk over.  The customers are a unique and eclectic mix, quirky yet too real and unaffected to be either Marina or Mission--do I detect a bit of USF at work?  At any rate, they're the kind of peeps whose faces actually seem to brighten when Mick Jagger kicks in with \"may the good Lord shine a light on you\".

OK, I have a good sense of humor, and am pretty laid back.. That being said, some things get to be overwhelming.. and I am a strong woman.. so there! One team name in specific was the start of my \"I will never go to trivia at the Bitter End again\" Team name was, \"Winning trivia is almost as hard as convincing my girlfriend to get her third abortion\" Seriously?! Im sure this guy doesn't actually get laid... and not only that, I do believe this name won... NOT COOL \n    3. They never can get the music round right.. problems with the songs, problems with the volume, overall lack of care from everyone there\n\nHowever on a Friday night its a good dive bar to hang out at if you don't feel like leaving the Richmond.. I like the dart boards upstairs.. but there is always a lack of chalk (usually because people are drawing penises with the chalk on the walls) \n\nSo Bitter End..

That said, here's my review...\n\nI've never been to Dublin, I've never been to Chicago or Sydney or Auckland.  I've never been to Glasgow, London, Philly, or Paris.  But one recurring image I have from whatever media I've taken in over the years is The Bar.  Bar with a capital B.  Back in the early nineties when Friends debuted was the only time in history it was viable to believe that a bunch of people in their mid- to late-twenties spent the majority of their out-of-the-apartment time at a Coffee Shop rather than a bar.  The Bar is where you go to drink alone or to meet up with your friends.  It's where you start the night and where you end it.  It's where you meet the girl of your dreams or learn to seriously calibrate the beer goggles.  The Bar has every drink you can think of and quite a few select brews on tap.  The Bar also has food - but food you get when you're making a clear decision to eat at The Bar rather than go to an establishment that actually specializes in making food.  The Bar is where you see old friends from high school and sing along with songs written and performed by hip youngsters back before they were 55 and writing songs for Ford commercials.  The Bar is where you treat the bartender well but God knows he treats you better.  The Bar is where you spend your last night before you leave for war or college or the great unknown and the first night when you come back.  The Bar is where you create and leave your memories, which only seem accessible once you've made it back into The Bar.\n\nAll apologies to Alpha Bar, but that's not a Bar, that's a bar.\n\nThe Bitter End is a Bar.", "author": "Tim K."}

Fantastic again: fresh, flaky, none-too-greasy. Our waitress was charming, explaining the menu choices in great detail, and telling us how she was a former customer-turned employee. Very cool and laid back vibe, And yes, they pull very respectable pints of Guinness and Harp-  along with some nice can choices like Boddington's.\nA bonus is this is just a few doors down from the salt-water aquarium shop on Clement - one of the most fascinating stores in the city to wander around, imo.", "author": "David C."}

He won't even make eye contact with me!  There are times where he's not even serving someone else - he's just putting glasses away - and he still refuses to acknowledge my presence.

He picks fights with everybody (including a particularly nasty brawl with nomadic father), he's seething with anger, and he often yells.  For whatever reason, the Bitter End has brought out Bob more than any other bar in the world.  Which is strange, because this is a great place and I love going there!\nNot too long ago I took myself there for a couple of pints.  I sat at a booth by the window for some people watching, and feeling quite calm and peaceful I sipped my beer.  Before I could even say \"She's dead, wrapped in plastic!\" *another homage*, Bob had come out.  For the second time in my life I bit a pint glass, chewed up the shards, and with a bloody mouth I walked out of there.  The minute I walked out, Bob disappeared.  WTF?!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-06", "description": "i enjoy coming here because the drinks are cheap and it's easy to find a place to sit near the bar.  the crowd for the most part is pretty chill aside from some random people who got too drunk.  there are also pool tables and darts upstairs so it's a cool place to go hang out.", "author": "Molly C."}

An Irish bar but not an Irish crowd, more students..  Really good vibe to this place....", "author": "Gary J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-08", "description": "First impressions, crowded, music was way too loud, selection of alcohol was decent, then i saw the \"special\" PBR and Jaeger? WTF?? i can see PBR and any whiskey but Jaeger? NO thanks, it took forever to get a drink, and the crowd seemed like as a previous poster put it, High School, yeah i agree on that one one hundred percent, the pour was decent, and after i dropped a fiver for a tip, the bartender suddenly became very interested, he cleaned the swill from in front of us (there had been stacks of dirty glasses napkins and other detrius) and gave us cocktail napkins, hmm OK, so then the large group of what i can only describe as college-jock-valley-dumbF**** began to sing along to the music, I can only handle so much of certain classic rock bands, but NO they had to play them all back to back, that was enough for me, so as we headed out, the bartender stopped us and apologized for the stupidity and the long wait. So maybe i'll come back during the week but absolutely never on the weekend.", "author": "Cooper M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-06-20", "description": "dear friends, tread carefully at this quiz night. definitely the best quiz night i've ever been to--the questions challenging but answerable, the organization superb, the MC not overly annoying, and completely entertaining. the caveat, then, is not in the daunting task of claiming a table at which to play pub quiz at, it's the fact that your friends will probably rip each other's heads off in the game. on the same team. if any trace of competition is present, and there are 4 or more players, your friendship may not survive. luckily, the drink prices are good so you can shoot all the bad juju away.", "author": "Shannon V."}

It's nice and cozy - a real neighborhood bar you feel good about going to over and over again. definitely not a bitter end to a great night.", "author": "Karva S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-11-10", "description": "Not sure what happened the last time we went there, but I'll give this place another shot.  Usually, the food is pretty solid (for a bar), but my friend's salad wouldn't exactly be described as 'fresh'.  More importantly, a few of our drinks tasted flat, including my Guiness, which is a tragedy.  Perhaps they needed to just clean their lines, but it's not cool going to watch a football game at a pub and feeling afterwards that you just wasted money on bad beer.", "author": "Larry M."}

Then, I realized that regular people don't usually get drunk playing trivia on Tuesday nights and I stopped going so frequently. Still a great spot to grab a pitcher with some friends, and the food is fine for bar fare. Just don't expect Bobby Flay (or some other chef of equal reputation) in the kitchen.", "author": "Ben C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-18", "description": "trivia nights, a pool table, and a freaking fireplace - i'm sold. the bar staff can either be personable and chat up a storm with you, or leave your group to be if you're interested in catching up with them. standard beer prices, and a fairly decent bathroom too. i love the ambiance and wood decor too - it sort of makes me feel like i'm in a snow resort hotel bar people forgot about.", "author": "Jenz y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-05", "description": "This is a good local beer bar.  Went on a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded but they weren't properly staffed.  We had a server get us beers at the table and then the server ended up behind the bar.  We waited a long time for our bill and then finally I went to the bar and asked for it and they told me they would be right there, finally, we ended up just leaving money on the table.  It is pretty bad when you are asking to pay and they can't even tell you how much you owe.  They are lucky we are honest and paid rather than just walking out.  I would go back but not for the service.", "author": "Marie N."}

The upstairs is cool too, with its pool tables and darts. Crowd consists mostly of locals, and the bartenders are pretty cool. Good conversation bar before the crowds on the weekend.", "author": "Jeremy J."}
