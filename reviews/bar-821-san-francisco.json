I also asked for a glass of water and they gave me a glass that held about a cup of water.\n\nThe most annoying thing was that the music was obnoxiously loud.

We walked in on Friday, August 10th around 10:30 pm. Our party of four easily found a table along the wall.\n\n*Manhattan 821: kentucky bourbon, meletti amaro & bitters ($11)\n*Amaro Blood & Sand: islay sgl malt, ramazzotti amaro, tuve fernet amaro & orange juice ($11)\n*Mexican Alps: aromatic walnut tonic, ramazzotti amaro, chile tequila & lemon ($11)\n\nI got the manhattan. I actually don't remember the cocktail much, but it I believe it was nicely balanced. Easy to sip on. I'm more into spirit forward, so if it was on the stiffer side, I probably would have remembered. I liked the vibe of the bar. Chill and laid back. It also has a beautiful ceiling. At night, it's gorgeous with the colorfully lite wall of liquor.\n\nNow why am I giving this spot two stars? The restroom. There was only one toilet (for both men and women) and it was sooo nasty! It was as if the toilet had exploded. There was something unidentifiable around the toilet. The floor was flooded. And the smell?! A urinal from the depths of hell comes to mind. Thinking about it makes me sick. That stench was indescribable. Plus, the door lock was faulty, so the two times we went to the restroom, we walked in on someone.\n\nFun bar. Reasonably priced cocktails. But that bathroom. Only go if you don't plan on peeing.

It's a cozy little spot for those who appreciate good spirits and craft cocktails. \n\nWhat impressed me the most was their extensive selection and focus on Amaro and Fernet. They have every liquor imaginable, but judging from the two large boards on the wall detailing their selection of these two items, I'd say this is their bread and butter. I am sort of a fernet novice but have been slowly tasting my way through all the brands. Fernet Branca seems to be an across-the-board favorite and I've really grown to love the drier Fernet Francisco.

Yeah, so apparently they're Italian herbal liquors with digestive properties. Think bitters and vermouth. Suggested serving is on ice with sparkling water. It's not cheap so if you don't know if you like it, you can spend even more money to try a \"flight\" of them. My friend commented that it seemed like they were trying to make this absurdity a cool trend. \n\nWe just happened to be in the area and it looked nice inside. It was only 5:11 PM on a Saturday so they'd just opened. The place was freezing and the metal seats felt like a slab of ice under my ass. I shivered while looking at the menu and we finally decided on one drink of the day (a $5 happy hour special) and one other cocktail ($11). They looked nearly the same with a cinnamon stick and orange peel. Hers tasted like sour orange juice, mine tasted like strong liquor with bitters. \n\nThe bartender was wonderful. Helpful, sweet, fun to watch making the drinks, attentive. He asked us how the drinks were and the best we could say is \"interesting.\" Three more couples filtered in while were there so maybe this place is doing alright.

In short, they lost my credit card, poured out half our drinks when we were upset about them losing our card.  They seemed liked they could care less when they lost my card.  They then blamed me when they found it because they mixed up my name.  \n\nDetails:  We ordered cocktails, and the bartender asked if we wanted to keep the bar tab open.  I said yes, and he took my credit card.  The drinks were just ok, so we decided to go elsewhere. When they brought the bill and credit card receipt, we realized they ran someone else's credit card.  I went to bar to tell them that it was the wrong card.  They then asked for my last name.  They came back and said they couldn't find my card even though it was only 10 minutes after I gave him my card. He kept looking for my card.  He asked me my name again. I told him my first and last name.  He said he couldn't find it.  He never said he was sorry.  He just kept saying that he didn't have it.  He then asked me to see if a charge showed up in my account. I had to go online to see.  Nothing was charged.  He said he didn't have the card but he clearly didn't seem to care.  We then asked why he never said he was sorry.  Then they took our glasses, which still had half of the drinks left, and emptied them into the sink.  \n\nWe kept saying it was a red Wells Fargo card, and he would rudely say he knows what the card looks like.  Three minutes later, he asked me my name again.  He then found it.  He then seemed to blame me because he didn't understand my name.  He then charged me full price for the drinks (even though they dumped half of them) and he charged my credit card.  He took no responsibility for his actions.  I hope he took the charge off of the other person's card!\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, they were not very welcoming.  The vibe is snobby hipster, and they seem disinterested when they thought they lost the card.  Be careful with these very careless bartenders.  I'd stay away.

They gave us the wrong credit card when we closed our tab- they ran someone else's card with our bill and gave us that person's card. That was extremely careless, to say the least. When we noticed and told the bartender, he then told us he couldn't find our card after a brief look around his area. He didn't seem apologetic or concerned. We asked him to keep looking, since losing and replacing a debit card is a serious thing. He again briefly looked then leaned on the bar and said it wasn't there. After a bit of back and forth, we started the process of canceling the card he lost- during which time they cleared our half full drinks and threw them out.  We AGAIN described what the card looked like and said the name on it for the fourth time. He didn't seem interested in finding the card he admitted he lost and didn't even offer an apology. Luckily, the waiter happened to see the card sitting right by the bartender's cash register- at which point the bartender charged us for our drinks even though they threw them out while half full. \n\nIt was quite possibly the worst service I've ever gotten at a bar. I understand that things get misplaced, but his lack of concern and lack of even a cursory apology was shocking. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be going there again.

It was happy hour - beers are $5 at most places. \n\nI loved the old Bar 821.  With the change to an Amaro Bar, I've still given it a college try and wanted to support.

We agreed to get the different drinks since he kept insisting on us trying it and when we got the check saw that he had upsold us on top shelf versions of what we wanted (bourbon and fernet). Know that it's our fault for ordering but would be nice if he told us \"oh and it's also 3 time as expensive as what you initially wanted\". if $$$$$$$$ ain't a thing for you, then order away, but if you're like most people, don't let the bartender upsell you", "author": "Derrick W."}

It's part of the Dajani Group, who also owns Nihon Whiskey Lounge on Folsom which is awesome.\n \nSaturday night was the second time I've been out to Bar 821. As tradition goes, my friend sets off for San Diego mid June, so I try to squeeze every last hang time out of the month of May that I can. So we had a nice light dinner and wine at my place, then cabbed it over to NoPa for a change of scenery. \n\nThe place is very cute and upscaley feeling without upscaley prices. We both had specialty soju cocktails: she had the Lychee Mermaid and I had some kind of \"Gin\" Negroni. Her drink was sweet and subtle, mine tasted like earwax. Yes, I know what earwax tastes like, judge away. Surely it's difficult to mask soju in a gin flavor. And, real-talk, I didn't know it was soju until after I ordered. \n\nAround $8 a cocktail and a very ncie ambiance, I can't complain too much. OR CAN I? One bartender for the whole place? Really? It's NoPa. A ton of people head this direction for a similar purpose as my friend and I. Also, just want to say, it's misleading when a bar back looms around behind the bartender and sips water.", "author": "Crystal C."}

The bartender (Davide) was attentive, kind, and the best kind of bartender you'd want to be making your drinks. He took care of us; we didn't feel pressured to order more and he asked about our drinks at the right moments. He misheard one of our orders and thought we ordered a beer, and immediately told us not to worry and that the beer was on the house.

I told her I was looking for a chill place with a full bar that would be quiet enough for conversation on a Friday night. 821 fit the bill on those criteria, but where it fell far short was in the condescension of the man-bun sporting bartender. As we approached the seemingly well-stocked bar, I searched the shelves for their vodka selection, only to find out that vodka is d\u00e9class\u00e9 in this hipster paradise. \n\"Do you have Grey Goose?\" says I, with a winning smile. \n\"THIS is the only vodka we serve...\" says man-bun, pulling a sad bottle out of the well. \n\"...Oh... Um, is it any good? Why are you hiding it under the bar?\"\n\"I guess it's fine. This is all we have, LOSER.\" (I added the 'loser' part, but just barely)\n\"Oooookay, I guess I'll try it, for $12. Thanks ever so much.\"\nWe took our trailer-trash vodka drinks and slunk away from the bar, popping our Hubba Bubba, slapping our flip flops on the polished concrete, and hiking up our acid-wash dungarees tied with rope, hoping only to drown our shame in off-brand booze. \nIf you're going to have a bar, or any business, for that matter, try not to make your patrons feel like they don't deserve to grace your door.

I had three Lychee Mermaids (they were THAT good) and it all ended up being 9 bucks not including tip.  The Korean Special was quite delicious as well.\n\nThe only thing that I have a problem with the fact that they only take cash and you can't keep a tab.  That's pretty annoying and although I understand this during a busy time, we were the only ones in that bar that day.  \n\nOther than that, it's quite a delightful place!", "author": "Meena N."}

But then the bar only serves wine, champagne sake and beers. Something about the license?... I guess some people might be put down by that, but for me it's not a problem too. I had two different champagne drinks, and I liked them a lot. And the tap Chimay was great. The beer selection looked great to me, and good prices too. I can't tell of any food, didn't try it. Bathroom was fine.\n\nA game was on TV, but it didn't seem anyone was there to watch it. I saw _some_  people there, mostly friends and couples talking, it seems. Anyway, I was liking the place a lot. The music was really really good, lots of soul and funk... But then, they had to close at 11pm. That's just crazy. Is it something about the license too??\n\nSo everything about the place looks great. But it made me go home earlier, and I have to take a star for that. And it looked like it was much emptier than it could be _just_  because of that. So because this problem seems to be really hurting the place indeed, I must take a second star.\n\nBest place to go if you want to have some good time on a place where it will be really easy to sit and to get your orders.

The next time, I brought my friend Michael and we had a grand time shooting the shit and enjoying the $3 Happy Hour cocktails.\n\nThat's right, 5-7pm Happy Hour = $3 for everything.  You be hard-pressed to find a better deal than that.  \n\nI prefer the Champagne cocktails to the soju drinks, although my friend liked the Apple Mojito a lot.  For the champagne cocktails, I would recommend the Ginger one or the Lychee.  There is also a Chocolate/strawberry one that I would love to try when strawberries are in season.  As for my beloved Black Velvet, it will have to remain but a memory, as this lovely concoction is now off of the menu. \n\nLighting is low (good for dates) and seating is relatively comfy  (bench seats and padded chairs, or bar stools) - and the bathroom has these amazing walls that you just have to see for yourself. \n\nIt's a simple bar with a good atmosphere and very friendly service - a place where you can relax with friends in a chill neighborhood environment.\n\nNote:  Cash only.  (At Happy Hour, you can get 6 drinks for $18! Yeah!)", "author": "Liz S."}

The night before we had drank and ate and spent too much, therefore we had promised ourselves a nice quiet Friday night. We arrived at 5:15 and ended up stumbling home at 2:30 in the morning... Our ship crashed upon the rocky shores of intoxication after hearing the Syren song of good cheap drinks. Happy Hour is that good here. Technically it lasts two hours, but during those two hours everything is three dollars. Granted they don't have a full bar but they do have great beers, wine, champagne and soju cocktails. \n\nWe drink our way through happy hour and then went  around the corner for some sushi. We eat and drink our way through dinner and evidently we lost track of time because the waitress asked if we would like to finish our bottle of sake at Bar 821. Bar 821 is owned by the same people that own Nihon and Tsunami, where we were eating at the time. For the inconvenience they gave us each a free drink at the bar. Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in...\n\nWe walked back in to a much more crowded bar, but they had put us at a reserved table with our drinks waiting on us. The sun had dropped during dinner and the bar wasn't near as bright and looked much better. Do you know of any bar that looks better during the day? That's not to say the bar isn't pretty because it is. It is very tastefully decorated. Throughout out the night service was top notch and I am sure we will be coming back in the near future. Hopefully, next time my internal fortitude will be a bit stronger and I will be able to call it a day after Happy Hour ends...", "author": "Bucky K."}

Everyone there was smiling and polite. None of that meat market mentality here. Also, there was an oasis of sexy accents there that night - British, particularly. Rowr.

Cocktails are $4, Champagne cocktails $5, and they have a nice one-page list of wines as well. It's all there in the handy laminated menus they leave out on the tables.

Now granted, two years ago, this would have been a legitimate complaint because I would have been 20 and thus technically too young to be at bars. Thankfully, when I was 20, I was at UVA. And when you're 20 and at bars at UVA, you're more akin to a senior citizen than a fresh fish. \n\nHowever, apparently being 22 and at Bar 821 on a Wednesday night, I'm too young. The time that elapsed between me walking in the door and the bartender's unprovoked issuing of this statement was roughly 26.5 seconds. He then proceeded, completely unwarranted I might mind you, to assault my 22 year old friend with the belligerent denunciation that his taste in women was limited to drunk, blonde sorority girls. This may or may not be true. \n\nNow, I really, really wanted to like this bar. Prior to my 26th second in this bar, I quickly fell in love with the low slung leather lounging couches studded with low rising circular tables, the easily manageable (un)crowd, the relaxing lighting and the $3.50 Coronas. But it's difficult to love a bar when the snarky bartender picks out your lil-bit buzzed and slow-on-the-draw friend as a target in his lame attempt to impress girls with his supposedly witty repartee. I wholly understand he was trying to impress the girls to our right. But c'mon, you're the bartender, if you're so desperate to impress them, give them a damn shot.", "author": "Tom C."}

GREAT happy hour beers on tap and friendly staff. Did I mention they have Chimay on tap!?! That's good enough for 3 stars right there! They also have Sangria and Sake, but that seems to be par for the course in NOPA these days.\n\nThere was a very interesting mix of hipster regulars, 40 somethings, and a few \"just got off work and need a drink\" 30 somethings. Music wasn't too loud and they were running old Popeye episodes on the tele.\n\nOverall a good experience and would definitely hit it up for happy hour again.

We don't like plastic bags so we have now outlawed those. We don't like the war and at least once a week we make that known with some protest. That is cool, I am all for getting out on a Friday at 10pm, carrying my 40 in a brown paper bag (as it should be) and lets face it, a war would really put a damper on my Friday plans. So, if we can take the time to speak up about these things why cant we let the people of these neighborhoods know that we want a few more bars that serve hard alcohol!! I mean, I am unsure that serving beer and wine is going to save us from anyone who wants to be drunk and unruly. Newsflash, they can still get drunk and unruly on beer, I swear, and if the liquor store on the corner carries Jack you are not keeping it from them prohibition style or anything. You can serve alcohol in a lower proof form in a bar, out of anything you want, to people on bikes who hate war, but if they drink and want to get drunk they will!!! Can we please have some bars that afford us the luxury of doing this on our own terms!!??\n\nBar 821, its not your fault. You work with that permit well.

Just go there after work, or whatever you do during the day, and unwind with that special one, or whomever. This place won't let you down.", "author": "Ruchita P."}

Bar 821, is one of those rare spots in the city that doesn't treat their mixed drinks as means to make up their substantially expensive rent payment. Meaning, they make a mean drink for little, well not a lot. It has the SOMA atmosphere, without the crowd and attention to loud music. The place had a distinctive air of cool matched only by their mixologists. Keep an eye out for their specials, last time we went all champagne cocktails were only $6 for the whole night. You won't see veuve (this isn't SOMA), but do expect fresh squeezed juices splashed inside your bubbles.", "author": "Michelle K."}

On my second visit, the one in which I tried the champagne cocktails, I wasn't crazy about the bartender. I'm going to cut him some slack though, since it was St. Patrick's Day and he was the only one behind the bar. \nOverall, I enjoy this bar, and it's a place I will go again. \nIt should be noted, that this bar doesn't serve hard liquor, but the  selection of soju cocktails, wine, and champagne is enough to keep me content.", "author": "Natalie M."}

But it was way worth the trip and there are plenty of late-night alternatives nearby.  Bar 821 is a pleasurable little secret... but it didn't come from me : )", "author": "Tara G."}

Always on the list of \"oh, we need to drop in there this weekend\" but never happened. Finally on a Friday night  we dropped in and had a great time! Our bartender was super-fun and quite the character (even though that comment about Alan Parsons Project made me feel OLD I won't hold it against him). If I could give bonus stars for atmosphere I would. The drinks were yummy and the prices were average for the city. Oddly enough, despite the modern decor, Bar 821 had the feel of a true Irish pub. Good drinks, food brought in from elsewhere, fun bartender, small neighborhood feel and the obligatory TV showing a sports game.  Love it!", "author": "Sarcastic T."}

Completely cold and careless and hostile and rude. Ignored me for a long time then rudely took my order and threw the beer on the bar. The foam went over the top for a while, leaving me with a sticky filthy glass covered with beer in a puddle of beer. Very nice. Music sucked and was way too loud. Stupid flat screen TV on the wall. Why the fuck would someone want to go to a bar to watch a screen that they can't hear? It's stupid. Get rid of it. There's enough bloody TV all over the place these days. And, on a freezing cold pre-winter night, they left the front and back doors open, so one had to totally freeze and could not try to enjoy being there. Incredibly loud.

But the real draw is the champagne cocktails, my fave being the sparkling ginger. For $5 ($3 if you get there before 7), you get a tasty, bubbly gingery concoction. And once you've had a few too many of those, you have the option to switch to a nice pint or a glass of wine. The ambiance is totally chill- candlelit with some comfy benches (although the accompanying chairs totally blow- good excuse to sit next to your honey for better hand-on-thigh action). In addition, there's always a classic cult movie playing on the TV (muted) with the bartender's ipod at work (he plays good stuff).
