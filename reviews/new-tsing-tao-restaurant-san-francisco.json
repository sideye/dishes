A lot of SF Chinese restaurants have stopped serving tea as soon as you sit down.)\n\n We were surprised at how much BBQ pork we received as an appetizer!\nThe serving sizes were very generous.  The quality of the pork was very good.  Our server dropped off hot mustard to go with the BBQ pork.\nNot to forget--- the pot stickers were good too.  Crispy and moist at the same time--nice.\n\nOur favorite were the pan fried Hong Kong crispy noodles.  We asked for a combo and it came with seafood, chicken, pork and beef.\nIt was excellent.  I love it when some of the noodles remain crisp while others are completely saturated with a tasty sauce.\n\nThe chicken with black bean sauce and white rice was excellent as well.  I originally ordered chicken and broccoli but they misunderstood and brought me this dish instead.  We decided to keep it because it was amazing.  So glad we kept it.  (They offered to replace it.)\n\nAgain, the serving sizes were large!  Service was great.  It's a hop, skip and a jump from the West Portal Muni station.\n\nClap! Clap! Clap!", "author": "Thomas D."}

My colleague raved about the Mongolian Beef (Hot), Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, House Special Chow Mein, and House Special Fried Rice.  \n\nSo today, I drove all the way up from Belmont and met friends who took BART from the East Bay and then MUNI to West Portal to try the place on Ulloa that my colleague raved about, and ordered what my colleague said to try.  Friends of mine, who came from the East Bay, and myself agree that the food had no taste, bland and very salty.\n\nOnly good thing about the restaurant is the customer service.  Wait Staff are very attentive, and came around to see how things are.  When they saw that we did not eat our food, they asked us why and we told them it was very salty and we could not eat it.\n\nIt is ranked 2 stars because of the customer service.  If it did not have good customer service, I would have given the rank 1 star.\n\nFriends from East Bay, and I were very disappointed because we have had better Chinese food than this place.

Even on that basis it was pretty disappointing, though. The Lemon Chicken was overly breaded and sweet, with the lemon itself being almost undetectable. The crab Rangoon was basically just deep fried cream cheese. The pork was overly fatty, and the veggie pot stickers were tasteless. To top it off, the vinegar sauce had no bite. The only decent condiment was the chili oil. The food was also lukewarm by the time it was delivered, so that didn't help anything.\n\nGranted, it's no worse than I've had in plenty of places around the US, but in SF this is pretty sad.\n\nOh Wok Shop Cafe, I so miss you.", "author": "Nathan P."}

Unfortunately the potstickers we ordered we're just okay with the flavor a little bit off and then the two entrees, lemon chicken and Hunan beef we're really completely off in terms of flavor and the texture was even worse.\n\nI can only speculate that the chef is deviating from normal recipes.

Almost impossibly quickly. \n\nAnd I think I know why.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThis was the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten.  And I've eaten Chinese food on the West Coast, the East Coast, many capital cities in Europe.... not to mention Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.  Even my Dad makes better Chinese food than this place, and he is British.  (I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I'm pretty confident he is not active on social media).\n\nThe wor wonton soup had no flavor.  The wontons mostly consisted of dough, and what little filling there was lacked flavor.  The broth was disgusting, and the other ingredients were clearly added in layers.  Note to the chef - you may benefit from an advanced cooking technique - it's called stirring.\n\nThe pot stickers were nasty.  I imagine that they were they output of a Chopped Junior stylee show, where the chef was challenged to create a dish from actual pot and a couple of sheets of stickers.\n\nAfter that I kind of gave up, but the combination fried rice was particularly nasty.  Spoiler alert- it's basically a combination of identical looking (I would say tasting, but that would imply flavor) brown meat.  My guess is that it is intended to look like beef, but it doesn't taste like beef.  I know it couldn't have been dog, so I am at a loss.\n\nI will yield my last words to Jason M who reported here on this restaurant five days ago...\n\n\"If I am about to die from hunger and this is the only place that serves food, I would rather die than eat their disgusting and filthy good. The food that they serve is horribly disgusting. The food was raw uncooked cold and smelled awful.

We started with egg blossom soup--like egg drop but with small piece of tofu, mushroom, and peas.  It was piping hot and had a light and tangy flavor.  Our entrees were chow mein, which Nora created on her own, with tomato, white meat chicken, and extra sauce.  It was great, and William was happy to accomodate Nora's taste preference.  The moo shu chicken was delicious and perfect.  \n\nI told Nora that I felt like we were eating at William and Helen's home.  I would definitely come back.

I looked up Chinese food on Grub Hub and decided to try out New Tsing Tao. I got Crab Rangoon and Shrimp with Fresh Vegetables. The food arrived 30 minutes faster than Grub Hub said it would. It was delicious. I am from Back East where Crab Rangoon originated, and so the ones I've had in SF have been terrible. Theirs was quite decent, actually - I would get it again knowing I don't have access to Boston Crab Rangoon anytime soon. The stir fry was light but filling and delicious - not greasy at all. (Even the Rangoon, a deep-fried dish, was not heavy or greasy!)\nMy only two issues:\n-Rice does not come with your dish, so make sure to order separately if you need it.\n-I made a note through Grub Hub that they shouldn't ring the bell but call my phone due to tiny people sleeping in my house.

It's been in the W. Portal neighborhood since the early 90's. My first question was if they had rice noodles in their soups. Our waiter nicely asked right away if I was allergic to wheat.. he kindly, easily offered wonton soup without the wontons and asked what kind of vegetables I would like to be added. Delightfully light wonton soup with fresh meats (without the wontons) and fresh not overcooked vegetables. My husband had the lunch version of pork chops....wasn't on the lunch menu but our waiter knew the regular pork chops would be too much for lunch, so they again offered to work off menu to our satisfaction. Everything was tasty, not over salted, great home-style cooking. The staff there talked a bit with us about gluten free and other ideas for alternative noodles. Some restaurants are offended with special diet needs. We will return soon, looking forward to it!! Will be able to be clear about more stars when we return for another try.", "author": "Betsy A."}

She took it away instantly, no attitude, and brought a nice fresh looking one. I like that. Their Won Ton soup is good too. I also like that some of the chicken dishes use white meat.

It's been a great take out choice for the family for years but something's changed. First of all Christina answering the phone when I have called in for take out. Like last week. You simply call to place an order and she hangs up on you. You call back and she hangs up again. The 3rd time she says, \"This is a fax line so I can't hear you when you call..\" Like, did I do something wrong? What kind of a response is that? Not even, an apology. So snotty and uppity. Then tonight I order BBQ pork fried rice, broccoli beef and snow peas and prawns. I need to tell her she got the order wrong the last time and to please make sure the BBQ pork not the shredded pork gets into the order. MORE arguing with the customer! I haven't even finished placing my order. At that point I should have just hung up but I had two starving teenagers in the car. When I arrive Lucinda who is very professional opens my carton of BBQ pork fried rice and apologizes that Christina got it wrong the last time. She was very king and all smiles which made up for her co-worker who is rude and obviously doesn't like working in this place. Our food was piping hot and fresh. Over the years we know the best items to order such as tonight's choices. I also recommend the Wonton Soup, Pot Stickers and Chow Fun. You also can't go wrong with these.", "author": "Elizabeth R."}

We ordered the egg roll, $6.25 (4 pieces cut in 1/2, came with dipping sauce), small hot/sour soup, $6.50 (enough for 3 bowls) - the soups do come in S, M, L sizes; one of the specials of the day - Chinese broccoli & chicken, $9.50; and Sizzling beef, $9.95.  Tea, rice, fortune cookies/sliced orange came w/the meal too.\n\nI liked the crispy egg rolls, not so much the dipping sauce.  The broccoli/chicken and hot/sour soup were good.  Didn't like the sizzling beef.  It didn't come sizzling either.  It had too much catsup in it and reminded me of tomato beef over rice.

It's kind of pricey for Chinese, but the quality of the food produced is noticeably better than other establishments.  There's no MSG, the food tastes like it was cooked with quality oil (not too much of it either), and each dish i've ordered has the right proportion of ingredients.\n\nRecently, i've been calling in orders for pick up during my lunch break.  This is how I discovered the 'lunch menu.'  For an average of 8 dollars after tax, they give you quite a meal.  Unlike the normal menu, the lunch items include sides like rice and an egg roll; soup too if you eat at the restaurant.\n\nI should also mention that my take out orders have ALWAYS included utensils. a napkin, soy sauce (and other sauces when appropriate), and either a fortune cookie or a slice of orange.  As hard as it is to believe, this consistency is rare.  There have been too many times when i've ordered food requiring a utensil to consume, and open the bag to find just the food and nothing else.  It seriously ruins my lunch break.  Had I ordered during dinner hours, I can understand, as most would just take the food home to eat.  But during lunch hours?  Almost nobody goes home for lunch.  It doesn't take a genius to figure that out.\n\nAnyways, the man and woman who I assume are the owners (i've never been there without seeing at least one of them) are very friendly.  Not overly chipper, but more of a 'down to earth' type friendliness that's genuine.  In other words, they're not putting on a performance to milk you for a larger tip.\n\nAll things considered, this is the best Chinese restaurant in the area.  Despite being more costly than others, the customer service and attention to detail more than makes up for the premium.", "author": "Alex S."}

VERY good.  Shockingly good.  Deliciously good.

Some favs: dry garlic green beans, cashew chicken, crispy noodles beef.  William (the waiter) and Helen (the owner and hostess) are very friendly.

We had the spicy crispy chicken which was like Sweet & Sour Chicken except better. You make the determination if you try the dish... We also had the Broccoli Beef. Both dishes were great. Usually when you fry chicken pieces you get the dregs of the chicken. You know ass meat, gizzards and the back fat with a little meat. Not here, they were Breast pieces which turned out tender, surprised! Also when you crispy fry chicken pieces and drown it in sauce it turns the crispy to sog heaven but not here. It stayed crispy and was very delectable. The Broccoli Beef was very tender and the Broccoli not over cooked. Very good and the price was decent averaging $10.00 per dish but the portions were good.

The place is celean with friendly service in a casual atmosphere; serving some of the best Mandarin, Szechwan, & Hunan cuisine.  The pot stickers were probably some of the best we had with thin crispy golden warappers & a wonderful ground pork, cabbage, & ginger filling with a lite broth & perfect with soy vinigre drizzled over them.  The spicy dishes were good but not spicy which is why I took off a star; the orange beef was tender with garlic, orange peal, & chili pepper in a wonderful brown sauce but they needed to kick it up with the chili peppers; the same with the sizzling prawns which a couple bites were spicy but the prawns suculent with fresh zuchini, carrots, onions, & green peppers in a brown sauce.  The prawn chow mein was very flavorful with suculent prawns, fresh vegetables, & wonderfully seasoned cnoodles.  The brown rice was firm not soggy & nutty.  Round it all off with a couple Tsing Taos & you will not be disappointed.

Chinese cooking doesn't seem to require much heed when prepping meat versus non-meat dishes - a little chicken broth here, some fish sauce there, and a sprinkle of what-part-of-the-animal-do-you-desire amongst everything...just because. \n\nWell, at New Tsing Tao, the awesome waiter in the tuxedo, who is ALWAYS there, asks if you want egg in your dish, knows explicitly what dishes are prepped with chicken stock, and even remembers you as the vegetarian in the group. He is so cool - just ask him his story - he has been a chinese restaurant waiter for over 30 years! The vegetable mushu is one of the finest dishes in Chinese cuisine.. it is basically a fried vegetable chinese burrito (withi hoison sauce).. the waiter wraps the veggies with the pancakes before your very eyes. \n\nThe prices? I think average price is like $6. The service? priceless. The food? Fresh, delicious, flavorful, hot, and big portions. The atmosphere? Quiet, homestyle ambience. veggie options? LOTS. My favorite dish? Mushu vegetables. My second favorite dish? Fried bean curd with broccoli. What to do when you're done?
