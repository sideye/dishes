We arrived early, around 4:30 p.m., with the hope the fifteen of us, could get the back room. Score!\n\nChris, the owner, took great care of us. Over the course of our stay, he continually carted a wide array of pub grub to our makeshift buffet table. I believe every small plate offering was ordered and everything I tried was tasty. \n\nAs the spirits flowed, our crowd became merrier by the pint. We learned we all pretty much suck at darts, and even though we had some real tossers in our group, darts were not their forte. But we could be heard in the Outer Richmond when by sheer luck the occasionally tossed dart hit its mark.\n\nNext time you're in the Inner Richmond, stop by The Pig & Whistle and say cheers to Chris.

However, after a blatantly racist and hostile encounter with the staff there, we will not be back.\n\nLast night, I met my three friends before trivia. One at a time, we went to the bar to grab drinks and order food. Me and my two white friends were not ID'd, which is very usual. I have not been ID'd since my first time at the place.\n\nThen my (black) friend went to the bar to grab a drink with the free drink tickets we had from a previous trivia night. She was ID'd, and realized at the bar that she had left her wallet at work. She was turned down and came to the back room to hang out with us.\n\nI grabbed a beer at the bar and handed it to her in the back room. I'll admit I should not have done this, but our entire group was years beyond 21 and I really did not think that it would be an issue that my friend forgot her wallet. She had come with us before, and it's not as if anybody had bothered to check for my ID. I could have just as easily not had one.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, the server walked up to our table and took away my friend's drink and told us that there was a huge fine and the bar could be shut down for serving people without ID. We apologized and thought things would end there.\n\nLess than a minute passed, and the owner showed up at our table and yelled at my friend to leave. Without arguing, she started to put on her coat and gather her belongings. While she was doing so, the owner continued to yell at her about how he could lose his license, etc. She apologized, and he screamed \"You're not sorry you did it, you're sorry you got caught.\" He did not yell at anyone else at the table, although it was obvious that one of us had to have bought the beer for her. My friend continued to apologize, and tried to explain that she was 26 and had left her wallet at work. He continued to stand over her and scream even after it was clear she was going to leave and then escorted her to the door. Keep in mind, my friend was nothing but compliant, and at 5'3\" and 110 pounds soaking wet, she is hardly a threat to any authority figure. She could have walked herself out.\n\nI walked out after her, and we spoke briefly before I went back in to close out my tab and leave with my friends. The owner continued to watch us through the window as we talked on the sidewalk about what a terrible and racialized interaction we just had.\n\nI have never felt so much hostility, even when I was an underage and over-served co-ed nightmare. We were a group of sober adults that all the staff knew, and there was no reason for our small indiscretion to be met with such an aggressive response. From the beginning of the night, my friend was targeted for being black, starting with \"checking her papers\" and ending with being escorted out like a criminal. I'm sad that we'll need to find a new Wednesday ritual, but there's no way I can continue to support Pig and Whistle after last night. :(", "author": "Evelyn R."}

This is not it. Now to be fair, I'm vegetarian, so maybe the meat is incredible I can't speak to that. But here's what I'll tell you. A traditional English breakfast usually comprises fried eggs, fried mushrooms, fried tomatoes, baked beans, toast/English muffin, and some sort of meats. The vast majority of pubs in England now carry veggie sausages for people like myself. But I don't fault them for not doing that, I fault them for not including mushrooms or tomatoes or fried eggs. They have scrambled eggs only and when I asked if they could do them fried she says no so I can only assume they're pre-separated pourable eggs. Baked beans were pretty mediocre. And that was it. They kindly offered to add veggies for us which was cool of them and is why I gave the second star but the veggies were like broccoli and carrots so it didn't go with anything and most certainly did not recreate an English breakfast experience. Also got two terrible bloody Mary's. Extremely disappointing.", "author": "Marie H."}

Food is really good (fish and chips are perfectly crisp without being greasy) and not entirely greasy for a pub. You can even state into the back to see the cooks working. The clientele is also pretty friendly without being too rowdy for a bunch of drunkards. Seating is also easy because of how much space there is, and there's so much parking around because you're in between two districts. Pints are $5, but during happy hour, draught beers are $3.50. Can't argue with that, and the bartenders are very nice.\n\nFood is pretty solid. Fish and chips come with 2 large pieces of fish and a fairly large serving of fries. They even give you brown sauce to go with it (I tried it, and brown sauce doesn't work with this dish despite its deliciousness, so don't do that). The fish is just perfectly fried and has no briny flavor. It's good enough on its own without any lemon or tartar sauce. Their tartar sauce is also good as it's a little more tart than other I've tried, which works perfectly for me. The curry fries are tasty, but definitely need more curry on top of those bad boys.", "author": "Danny C."}

The $300 minimum bar tab to get it wasn't terrible, but at the same time, I don't think the bar lost much business due to us taking up the space either since the front of the bar never seemed to get that busy.  In any case, we ended up ordering more than the minimum anyways, so it didn't make a difference.  The workers were all pretty friendly, but the best part are the drink prices - so cheap!  We ended up getting more rounds than we would have at other bars, so can't complain about getting more bang for your buck!  \n\nSadly, despite how great I think the bar itself is, the food here really fell short.  Such a shame too since I had some high hopes for their Fish and Chips - while the pieces of fish were big, the batter was weak and I didn't care much for the flavor.  My friend's Bangers and Mash that I tried was mediocre - sausage was generic (like what you can get at a store) and the mash was bland.  Similarly, the mashed potatoes on my other friend's Shepherd's Pie was the same, but at least she had the meat underneath to give it some taste.  I haven't had many Shepherd's Pies in my life, but she said it reminded her of a frozen version in a way.  The Pork Loin Chop that my other friend got was probably the best of the bunch, but even then it was just average.\n\nSince I know people mostly come here for the drinks first and food second, I only took off a star instead of averaging them like how I usually do.

I enjoyed the atmosphere (of course being walking distance from where I was staying helped) but I really did enjoy the place enough to have made it a regular stop if I was a local.\n\nI once went to New Zealand and visited a local pub (back before my \"Christian\" wife dumped me like the scum bag piece of trash no good atheist monster that I am, that Jesus guy sure has hateful followers, but I digress, f, this is a bar review, oh, well, it's relevant now that the Christians have disowned me, I spent more time with decent people drinking in pubs)....\n\nAnyway, the New Zealand pub had this thing called \"The Quiz\" it was cool as can be and so I showed up, I guess randomly, on the night they do the trivia thing here at The Pig & Whistle.\n\nSide bar:  I opened Sound Hound and cheated like crazy on the \"name that tune round\".....my team mates missed a couple on purpose just to disguise the fact that we sucked, no worries, we had no chance to win.\n\nAnyway, in New Zealand the picture round had a bunch of cows and you had to identify the type of cow, yeah, like \"that's a Jersey\" and so forth, here in the city they had pictures of Hollywood people and a couple politicos, so it was a bit easier.\n\nGood fun all around.\n\nOk, the fish and chips weren't quite so good, I had fish and chips in Northern Ireland and so I know what they are supposed to taste like.  Oh, I had them in New Zealand too, but they sucked, everything there tastes like it was fried in sheep.\n\nSo my suggestion is that the oil probably needs to be hotter (too greasy) and for the chips, here's the deal:  read Anthony Bourdain's book on how to cook fries, it has to do with tempering them first I think, or something like that, um, cooking them before you cook them.\n\nAnyway, those couple suggestions and people will be raving about the fish and chips and since the beer selection was good, the staff very friendly and all that, the place would be five stars and always crowded with beautiful coeds, and that, my friend, sells some beer.\n\nUnless you're in England, where they don't like chicks in the pub, but this ain't the case.", "author": "Michael B."}

While we were waiting for our food we watched the Giants game so we weren't really paying attendion to when the food was arriving but after 20 minutes and seeing other people getting their food before us when they came in after us, my husband went over to the bar to check on our food.  \nThey came back and said that the ticket was lost and appologized.  They told us our food was being made right away and appologized again for the wait.  After our food came out they refunded our money so our entire dinner was FREE.   The staff kept applogizing and when my husband ordered another beer they gave it to him on the house.  The staff are very pleasant and personable.  \n\nAnyway, onto the review of the food.  I ordered the Sheperd's Pie, my son ordered the Cornish Pastie and my husband ordered the fish n chips.  I'll start by saying the flaovrs of the food was absolutely delicious.  The Sheperd's Pie was amazing with tons of flavor and veges.  The peas were not soft or mushy and the mash on top was slightly crispy.  My son's Cornish Pastie was flavorful and the pastry was nice and flaky like it should be.  \nThe fried fish from my husband's fish n chips was nice and flaky inside and crispy on the outside, not burnt or greasy like a lot of places make it.  \nThis place knows how to cook the typical pub food from England.  \nI've been to many British pubs and I think the food here is my favorite.  Even though I haven't tired any of their other items on the menu I can tell they'll be good by what I ate.  \n\nOne last note.

Their pub food is pretty standard - I'd skip the fries and fried mushrooms, but the onion rings are really good - and fairly inexpensive.\n\nThere are two drawbacks: trivia night is PACKED, so it takes forever to tally up scores, and trivia night is PACKED, so you have to get there an hour early if you want a table.  \n\nOn second thought, maybe you shouldn't go at all.  Maybe you should stay home.  Yeah... that's it.", "author": "Jennie K."}

They engaged in conversations without making it appear as though they were blessing you with the pearls of wisdom that fell from their mouths.  Chill.\n\nThe \"booth\" we sat in was terrific.  The side against the wall was cushioned with green velvet.  And there were little arm rests that delineated where the next section was.  I had my own little throne, that I had to share with Erica.  \n\nThe food came and was pretty good.  The fried stuff was all about the same color of well done.  I think it's a british thing because every pub I've been to has done the same violence to fried foods.  It's like the time was set to \"make sure there's nothing left alive.\"\n\nMy wings were seasoned to perfection and fried to a crisp.  It came with 3 dipping sauces.  I like dipping.

After moving to SF three years ago from the UK, I was searching for ages for a decent pub that had nice pub food and good atmosphere. I found exactly this in the Pig and Whistle. They have a lovely selection of British/Irish/European beers -- including Old Speckled Hen ale (yum yum). Lots of pub food including full English Breakfast, Steak and Ale pie (with beans and chips...so authentic!!), Fish and Chips (the best I've had in SF) and bar snacks like curry chips and breaded mushrooms. And well stocked in HP sauce and British malt vinegar (yum yum).\n\nAlso, the atmosphere is really great. Lots of regulars go, it has a pool table and darts, and there are often themed nights that quiz night (lots of fun...pretty challenging questions!) and things like that. The dukebox has loads of British classics...The Beatles, Oasis, Blur, Maniacs, Pulp, you name it....\n\nBasically, it's a top home-from-home for expats, and a little British experience for Americans!

During grad school my roommates and I would watch Jeopardy and try to shout out the answers first.   We became a bit obsessed with Ken Jennings.  I think that's why my team last night thought I might be autistic.   So my complaints:\n\n-- The quiz takes a long time.   Not that it's filled with questions mind you.   There are long, long waits in between rounds.  I was able to take time to go outside and read tomorrow's East Coast newspapers on my iPhone while waiting for the next set of questions to begin.  Also the rounds are only 8 questions long, no multi-point questions. \n\n-- The quizmaster forgot to say our score when announcing the standings.  This is fright inducing  because you're immediately faced with the chance that you've wasted your time due to a clerical error, and when you're trying to get the quizmaster's attention to rectify the problem the bar staff looks at you like a potential terrorist. \n\n-- The last round was wayyyyy too easy.  Every team in the bar got all, or all save one, right.  Consider that these people have been drinking for three hours that is absurd.  This should be the toughest round.\n\n-- Finally, before the last round the quizmaster asks a few \"extra tough\" questions and gives a prize to the person who get it right.  The last question was \"What was the breed of dog shown in 'The Thin Man' series?\"   I know this.  I saw the movies as a kid (they are based in SF).  I even HAD A DOG OF THIS BREED as a kid.   I raise my hand and give the answer, \"Fox Terrier.\"\n\n\"Wrong\" says the quizmaster. \n\nWhat?  What?!?!?!?!?!?\n\nHe then gives the prize to some one who says \"Schnauzer.\"  During the next interminably long break I look up wikipedia on my iPhone.  To confirm.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asta\n\nI take my iPhone up to the quizmaster with as little drunken defiant rage as I can muster and he says \"Yes, I gave the wrong answer\" then turns away.  No reason why.  Lord knows how many other mistakes he makes correcting answers or tabulating scores. \n\nAnnoying.  Where's Alex Trebeck when you need him?", "author": "Beau G."}

The inside looks like what I expected from a pub - wood interior, including the furniture, paintings/pictures all over the wall, a bar, and tv's. Some of the staff even complemented the ambiance of the pub with their British accent.  \n\nFor our first time to a place like this, we had to order the fish and chips. Out comes this plate with HUGE pieces of fried fish and chips=fries. This had to be the biggest (and cheapest) order of fish and chips I have ever seen! We also ordered the buffalo wings, which were different than what I'm used to. Instead of the sauce being on the wings, you get the cooked wings served with 3 types of sauces. Others in my group also ordered food and were happy with their selections.\n\nThere was a good crowd there for Quiz Night. Some had to be regulars! What you do is get into groups of however many people you want, and form teams. There are many different rounds which involve a variety of topics such as current events, geography, a celebrity picture round, or music. It was fun to see what kinds of random facts people know! Basically which ever group can answer the most questions correctly wins a prize. That night it was $30 cash. Although I don't drink, the rest of my group surely does, so the pitchers kept coming.

And because the owner Steve is hugely accommodating and a nice guy,  and the bartenders are great, as long as you don't ask for a blender drink or something with ingredients you shouldn't ask for in a pub.   One reason you won't go to the Pig is to get laid, as the place just isn't like that, and as long as you know and accept that then bottoms up. So to speak. \n\nI love the English breakfast--bacon, ham, beans, eggs, potatoes, and toast-to the point of craving it sometimes.  Not sure why.  The other food is very decent, and the drinks are cheap enough.  I like the free pool on Sundays, in theory, but I've only taken advantage once.  I like the happy hour every day.

She also claimed that it was 2:10 am at the time that she was yelling at us but by the time we got in a cab after this confrontation it was 2:02 am.

The food is the real deal - Cornish Pasty, Sausage Rolls, Bangers and Mash, Steak and Mushroom or Shepherds Pie, and outstanding Fish and Chips, two lightly battered filets of Icelandic cod served with wedge cut fries and a salad. Breakfast, served until 3:00pm, is exactly what my London friend Gerald has served on many a Sunday morning - scrambled eggs, bangers, Irish bacon, black pudding, baked beans, home fries, and toast, a meal that generally sticks to my ribs until Monday afternoon. The bartenders have been taught the fine art of pouring a Guinness - fill a 20-ounce glass two-thirds, allow the stout to sit, then top it with a white creamy head that floats just above the rim. British ales on tap include Bass, Boddingtons, and Newcastle Brown, and they also stock Blackthorn Premium Cider.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-07", "description": "This place is literally 700 feet from my house, needless to say I frequent it.  Now I essentially live @ work and school, so i don't come as often as I'd like, and I don't have as good a grasp on this bar as say the Dogpatch or Mission Bars. But let me tell you about this little gem.\n \nGreat food (fish and chips can be a bit bland but shepherds pie = god)\nAmple free pool & less ample free darts (save your quarters for laundry!)\nPitchers of plentiful beer selection.\nNeat mixed crowd, lots of folk. Make no mistake, this is a scots bar!\n\nSo as you can see, this is a great freaking bar. Now let me regale you with why I decided to yelp it now, after attending quite a few times.  With Bars I like to have a real story before I yelp them, unless they really stand out or I might be the first to yelp em.  Often also I go home and drunk yelp the place only to find that i never actually submitted my review and just forgot about it entirely. This was not the case with PNW, this was...\n\nSo I had just gotten off a long shoot (where we totally nailed the product shot, only to see that the Heineken bottle was out of focus, so much for an A on that film project). Rode the bus home, showered, and ba-dum-sum-cha my buddy Dave is at my door with a 12-pack of Newcastle.  We crack em open, let the dogs run out back and start talking about school.  Shortly after my friend (and now yelp friend) George M. shows up as well.  A few more beers later we mosey to the Pig and Whistle to meet an actor from our school + girlfriend, Dave's girlfriend Jill and her two co-workers, Later to be met by friend Kent. This is where the night turned bad.  Now Dave is as solid as a brick wall, but he acts crazy. Most people would think him pulling his knife on me three times was why it went bad, you'd be wrong (and if you thought that, you wouldn't be friends with Dave). Now Jill is always a hoot-n-a-half so no problems there. Kent is an awesome guy and George has quite a few markings of \"coolest mother on the planet.\" So we've eliminated them, which leaves us with, Jill's co-workers.  OK, they were really nice for awhile - kinda dull, but that's more than ignorable with pitcher after pitcher of beer and a group of 9 people. But it all goes downhill when you start proclaiming that this is such a nice Irish bar. It's Scottish, I don't expect you to know that, but I'm Irish and I'm sensitive about that stuff. Of course it's a small mistake, all is forgiven. Then the new tidbit of insight from a blonde's head was that my friend \"looked like marina boys.\"  That's a bad move, he doesn't like the Marina, and he lives close enough to catch shit for it regularly.\n\nHere's the similarities between my group and yours, we don't live in the Marina.\nHere's the differences, my group doesn't think it's a compliment to be called Marina-esqe. \n\nSo please young woman, if you are so hateful about living in the Sunset (understandable) then move out, go to the Marina! If there's anything more sad than a Marina mom it's a Marina wannabe. But that was really just more funny than anything else as my friend decided to push the issue, \"What about me makes you think Marina, seriously I'm not going to hold it against you, I want to know so I can rid myself of it, what makes you think Marina?\" Her back peddle and eventual excuse was hilarious. More importantly the other friend (after a solid four hours of drinking), pulls a half eaten burrito from her purse and begins munching on it. It wasn't wrapped well in the foil, I'm sure there are rice and beans all over her purse. I proceed to ask her with awe \"where'd you get that?!\" I'm meaning, why was it in your purse, she's a bit more literal and states some place in union sqaure. She didn't know the name. She goes there twice a week. What, is wrong, with her?\n\nShe should know the place's name, she shouldn't have left it in her purse, and for god sakes \"real San Franciscans don't eat Mexican food anywhere but the mission. Not even in Mexico!\" (Sally K.)\n\nanyway, called em a cab and went to bed -- just another night in laurel heights -- and a vote for why you met girls at the bar, and don't bring them with you.\n\nProximity to the Bridge Theater (currently playing Grindhouse) is a huge plus and bumps it up to the 5th star!", "author": "Tyler W."}

My friend and I sat and talked to her the other night for a couple of hours - one of the best conversations I've had in a while.  When she finished her second drink, she asked the bartender (possibly the owner, but I'm not sure) to call her a cab.  It took a while for the cab to arrive, so the bartender called again, and repeatedly looked outside to check for the cab.  Finally, while out having a smoke, my friend hailed a cab and kept him there while the bartender and I helped Kay out of the bar with her walker.  Now, Kay is of the generation that still believes that $1.00 is a sufficient tip to give to the nice young man who helped her to her seat and brought her drinks to her.  Unfortunately, a lot of bartenders wouldn't be so helpful and nice to Kay, but this bartender (I wish I could remember his name!) was.  He gets my four stars.  \n\nBesides the very nice staff, Pig & Whistle has a good beer selection and pretty good Irish pub food.

The cash is nice, but it usually equates to less than the \"round\" of drinks you win for second place.  Not quite as fun as it used to be, but still a pretty fun dive.", "author": "dustin c."}

I used to live down the street and my roommates and I would be sure to go and test our knowledge. Get there early though as tables fill up! Come here any other night though and its just like any pub...", "author": "Annie L."}

I just got a car again so I spun over to have some bangers and mash or maybe the shepards pie. Oh shit! they must have changed ownership! The food had no lard content and was somewhat flavorfull. Look,... basic British (or welsh irish or scotch) food has little or no flavor. Thats the rules. Those folks either boil things in sheeps blood or alcohol, and fry or bake eveything else to tastless bland death. The food is being made by someone else now and it tastes ok even when sober. I love beer that could pass for liquified bread, boddingtons, newcastle, guiness,... bring it on. Good jukebox still, (anyone remember 'lost in the supermarket' by the clash?) and I threw some darts too. I also got a couple a free ones simply by virtue of my pasty complexion and the hue of my hair. Sorry but I dont have a lick of Irish in me. Ok so I had to abandond my newly aquired car until the next day, it was worth it.", "author": "dave p."}
