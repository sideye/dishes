With its cast of charismatic, colorful & off-colored loyal clientele of mostly SF natives and locals, it could become one of those iconic hang out spots like the Central Perk Caf\u00e9, Cheers Bar, Clary's Caf\u00e9, or Monk's Caf\u00e9! I have literally, on MORE THAN ONE occasion, during broad DAYLIGHT and amongst SOBER people, witnessed a patient coming in for breakfast on a Sunday morning after JUST being released from the ER for having a crazy, drunken Saturday night; an entire bar play musical chairs with no music; people forming alliances with strangers to play pranks on others within minutes of meeting each other; and not 1, not 2, but 3 separate people putting on a mask that they randomly happened to have with them, NOT during Halloween. Again, during broad daylight and while sober!\n\nOk, now about the food/drinks:\nI don't know anything about beer, but they've got a LOT of it. Just remember, \"When in doubt... grab a STOUT!\" Guinness, of course!! \n\nOn cold, rainy days, the Shepard's Pie or the  Guinness Beef Stew hits the spot with tender, juicy meat, rich gravy, and fluffy mashed potatoes. \nSave room for dessert!

Lots of chunks of beef and veggies with the gravy and mashed potatoes. It was all tender and cooked just right.

They have multiple TVs and even a large projector (although billiard players may be in the way).   Our fairly large group was able to get table(s) when arriving around 430 on a Friday.  \nTheir food is good, nothing to write home about.

The fried calamari, while not on the menu, was good. Other places that I order fried calamari includes a marinara type sauce which I think would make this dish better.  Wings were very good (but it's hard to screw up wings).  The entrees we ordered (fish and chips and shepherds pie) were alright.  The fish and chips were on the soggy side, but still was good.  The shepherds pie tasted like shepherds pie and was very heavy on the gravy taste (which isnt necessarily a bad thing).  the garlic fries were cheesy and garlicy....best of all THEY HAVE PORTLAND KETCHUP (by far the best ketchup i've ever tasted).\nOur order also had many pitchers.

We also had, and I kid you not, some of the best Spicy Buffalo Wings ($5 for 5) I've had in a while. They were very hot tempurature-wise, and slightly spicy with a really solid *crunch*. I had to stop myself from eating the whole plate before my friend got to taste their glory. Normally they're $6.95 for 5 but at happy hour it's $5 for a basket of 5, so we got two orders.

The staff here are very friendly and solicitous in making sure you have a good experience. They all seem to have an Irish accent too!  Love it!  \n\nThe food here is typical pub food with some Irish goodness.  My bf and I love that Shepard's Pie.  We also had the Caesar salad which came in a large generous portion.  \n\nThe establishment itself has some good humored signs on the wall appropriate for an Irish pub and bar.  There is a pool table in the back which is in service when UFC is not playing.  Wherever you sit, you'll be able to see the screens with ease.\n\nAnother great point about this bar are the patrons.  People are so friendly and cool.  It's easy to start up a conversation with someone adjacent to you. The crowd is mostly 30 something, quite diverse and just well behaved.

Since we were thirsty, well we just had to have a quick drink.\n\nBeing a lover of Rum, I had the punch. They had some citrus and strawberry flavors mixed in and it was delightfully refreshing. I would love to have a little neighborhood corner irish pub like this here in so cal. The corniced ceilings, wood paneling, mirrors, windows galore, I mean it was a great lil hot spot (arent all the corner bars in SF???). They were very busy here and it shows with quick efficient service with a smile. Rather peculiar for the Bay, but not too hard to believe in the mission.\n\nThe seats were comfy, and they had a sit down area further back with lots of tables to house the grub part of their service.\n\nWhat was really crazy, was that this is an Irish bar, kinda obvious by its name. However due to the Carnival theme they tailored drinks to it in addition to playing some swanky latin music that easily made you sway to the rythem of the day. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this lil joint!

Small and intimate and we were so pleasantly surprised to see that our waitress as well as many patrons were actually Irish! My friend and I split the Disco Fries (a sort of poutine dish), the entree-sized mac and cheese and the chicken pot pie.\n\nEverything was very tasty but some of it wasn't exactly what I expected. Pot pie didn't have a lot of gravy and was VERY heavy on the potato, there was more chunks of that than peas, chicken, etc and not enough broth to properly soak everything up. On top was a MASSIVE puff pastry but the dish just wasn't juicy enough to warrant needing the bread; it just integrated with the potato to make it too starchy and thick. \n\nThe mac and cheese was good but needed to be a bit creamier, would've liked some gooeyness while eating it. It had a great flavor though, and you can add things like bacon or tomato to it.\n\nGenerous portions, very attentive and friendly waitstaff, nice atmosphere.

Not sure if it's a problem with the lines or the CO2 or what, but they pour bad tasting brew. Also frequently warm. Unacceptable for a pub...completely. \n\nThis place really lost me when I stopped in one day and ordered a Racer 5 and a shot. I already new they were subpar but I was in a hurry headed to bart. When I walked in I heard the owner behind the bar discussing with patrons and workers how some lines had become crossed and certain beers were not pouring with the corresponding tap. When I got my Racer it was immediately obvious it wasn't a Racer, so I let the owner know but said I'll drink it anyway because I'm in a rush. She actually argued with me that she definitely knew it was a Racer (it wasn't).  Not only was the beer warm with low carbonation tasting horrid, but she sold me a heferveisen and insisted it was a solid IPA. Ridiculous. \n\nAgain, the bartenders are very nice. I also like the owner, despite this experience. Danielle is hot. However avoid this place if your heart is set on an ice cold, crisp, fresh tasting brew of exceptional quality.", "author": "don h."}

The front of the bar can get really crowded and when it's cold, the draft from the door can wreck you.\n\nTables are reserved for food-ordering folks but there are bar stools around the bar where you can down your Guinness.

Definitely exceeded what I expected to get for an order of wings and fries. Delicious! \n\nThe service?! HORRIBLE!! I would give our \"SERVER #2\" (as the receipt showed) a big FAT 0. Just a super bad experience. She either seemed too comfortable with her type of service or just didn't care. We walked in, got sat by her. As soon as we got sat, she asked us what we wanted to drink but as though it was a bother for her to ask. Both my friend and I ordered a Bloody Mary (delicious by the way). Once our Bloody Mary's were brought to us by SERVER #2, she asks us if we are ready to order and we say yes. She then says, \"Ok. What do you want?\" Ummm...last I know, NO server asks anyone in that way. Are you kidding me?! We order and immediately walks away as soon as we are finished speaking. Did you like have to use the restroom or something that it was necessary to walk away so fast as soon as we were done ordering?! Our food comes out about 10 minutes later but someone else other than her brings it out. We take a few bites and are need of more napkins and want another BM. Where is our server?! A table of 4 gets sat next to us. Immediately she re-appears again and goes over to them, takes their drink order. Ummm...hello?! As soon as I see she is done taking their drink order and is about to walk away I say \"Excuse me, can we please get some napkins and 2 more BM's please?\" And she says, \"Yep!\" and AGAIN zooms away. Again....okaaaay? 5 minutes later brings us the BM's but this time, SLAMS them on the table and goes to the table next to us to take their order. That to me just did it. I was mad, upset, and ready to finish eating to get out of there. Never, EVER have I had THAT horrible of service!! So never asked us how the food tasted, never checked on us to see if we needed anything, and never asked if we were ready for the tab. WE had to ask for it. We ask and brings it immediately. As soon as we put the cards out, she was quick to come and get them from us. Brought our cards back with the receipts. I never, ever leave $0, but I was soooo tempted to. We ended up leaving her $4 so she knew her service was not appreciated one bit along with a little note of advice. I never complain but this time, I truly felt it was needed!

I came here with a couple of friends who decided to go bar hopping in mission district. We stumbled upon this place after passing on a couple of other bars that were either cash only or had cover. Once we walked in we could feel the nice vibe of the place, everyone was having a jolly time chatting it up and the bartenders were busy serving up drinks to everyone. So my friends and I started off with AMF's for everyone and that was when we started to get into this random conversation with these two hilarious Irishmen. As soon as they heard it was my birthday they wanted me to get a shot of whiskey. Me, feeling bad that it was just me taking a shot decided to buy a shot for everyone. And that's how the night started to get rolling. 3 more shots and a Long Island later I am starting to brown out. That's when the conversations started to get much more deep on a personal level. That's when I realized that we were actually in an Irish pub and that Irish people are freaking hilarious. They would clown on you so hard but got the vibes going up. Yeah I don't remember anything else after that except a faint memory of throwing up right outside the pub. That's how you know this place is cracking lackin.", "author": "Joe Z."}

That's right, on a Caesar. the second time I was there drinking and my friend insisted on eating-I warned her, tbut my attempt was futile. a quesadilla. literally the kind you make at home when you are wasted-two torillas grilled with shredded american in the middle. that's it. oh and a ramekin of sour cream. i watched another friend ruin his night by ordering pork chops-about a centimeter thick and dry as my mouth after a four foot bong rip. you have been warned...", "author": "Chaka K."}

They have the best Effing Fish & Chips in San Francisco though the great ingredients in their burgrers could do w/ a bit more temperature to give a slight crusty-ness to the patties. \n\nThat said, the crowd is usually great, the staff a hell of a lot of fun if a bit distracted at times, & the pints good & chilly.\n\nMake sure to stop in on Saturday days when 'The Meanest...and Most Fun' Bartender in San Francisco is working.  The locals all seem to have an outrageous time giving her a load of Sh%#t while she dishes it right back!  They call her something like, 'The Lorn Beast', or 'Haggy'.  Note exactly politically correct, but what she doesn't seem to care.  People show up just for the abuse as it's apparently something of a weekend ritual amongst the regulars and a great bit of fun for the unsuspecting sod who wanders in.  The odd surburban droid might not get it unfortunately.  Then urbanites don't get them either.\n\nThe only real down side is that it is usually something of a Sausage Party.  Especially on the weekend days with the American Footbal crap.  That said, 'Cherry' (?) is the sweetest thing this side of Honolulu and everybody seems to be hot for the blonde one they call 'The Teacher'.", "author": "Neil S."}

My experiences are limited to Wednesdays, so this review will be based on my Wednesday visits.\n\nWhy Wednesday, you ask? The Napper Tandy runs a little thing called A Pub Quiz. As such, they are heavily staffed by a large number of Irish folk who happen to be among the nicest pub workers in the world, albeit heavily understaffed. In addition to being patient and kind, they make tasty chicken fingers and finger-licking good chocolate martinis.\n\nI wish I could say the same about pub quiz attendees. RAMPANT cheating.

Bad Marina-style karaoke on the weekends spills out onto the sidewalk.  Last night, however, all I had in mind was a beer and a game of pool.  And Napper Tandy could not deliver.  The doorguy was literally passed out on his stool-and it was 8:00.  The bartender was MIA, then she was on the phone, then she was smoking.  On my 4th visit (still no beer) I let her know that the cue ball was stuck.  She tried to shoo me away; I had to beg for my beer.  And it was a crappy beer.  And she told me one price and charged me another.  Anyway, it's confirmed.  This place blows.  Thankfully, moved onto Bar Mission at 23rd and had an EXCELLENT experience.", "author": "rachel h."}

I come here about once a week to watch Giants' games because it's on my way home from the BART station.  Bartenders are mildly friendly and the beer is beer (not a bad selection, but nothing prolific either).  The food however, is incredibly bland.  Had fish and chips last night ($12 I think) and didnt taste anything other than the tartar sauce I ended up having to use to make the fish have any flavor.  If they don't care about the food, that's fine, but i think the prices should reflect that.  Don't mind coming here for a beer while watching the game, but won't miss the place when I move to the Richmond next month.", "author": "Dareyn S."}

Its a big menu they do everything from hamburgers and Irish breakfasts to Quesadillas and pulled pork sandwiches the food is moderately priced but I dont mind paying if its worth it. They also have lots of beers on tap and I noticed three different bottles of tequila (which I hate but I guess I am in the Mission) There is a pool table in the back of the bar which always seems to be accepting quarters and the regulars do be lining up to take on the table champ.
