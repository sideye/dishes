The happy hour menu is changed from what I saw online. I'm guessing they were down someone but it was so slow. We ordered a few other rolls after about 15 mins because we weren't sure how long it would take. After we ordered it took 35 mins to get our few sashimi items and a 4 piece Cali roll. There was only about 8 other people in the restaurant, but we didn't get our rolls for another 25 mins. But watched others get their rolls and checks in front of us. The waitress had to ask us if we ordered more when we were waiting around for our last pieces of sashimi. \nThe some of the salmon sashimi pieces were frozen and I had to stop eating them for them to thaw so I can enjoy them and the perfect temperature. The other rolls we had were pretty good! We had the Chaotic and Dragon rolls and the shrimp tempura we very full. \nThe food was good but I gave 2 stars because I will not be back. The wait time and frozen salmon was a huge turn off for me. Come with patience!", "author": "Megan M."}

I've been a regular at Marina Sushi Bar for the past 5 years and it's a wonderful place to get your weekly sushi fix. Of the 50+ times I've eaten here, the fish is always consistent and the owners are always super friendly. It's mostly known to get a bit rowdy at night but, I'm a huge believer in their happy hour. \n\nThe happy hour menu just expanded so, much to my surprise on Monday I was able to order more things than I used to. Nigiri is $1.50 a piece (which is a steal in SF), basic rolls (kappa/tekka maki) are $3, and beer/saki are %50 off. It goes from 5-7 on weekdays so you have plenty of time to make it in after work. I usually sit at the bar and hammer the maguro, spicey hotate, albacore, tobiko, etc. Like I mentioned before, the fish is great and they are generous with their portions. \n\nIf you happen to find yourself on the north side of town and don't have happy hour plans, then come check this place out. It's dimly lit, generally pretty quiet and a great option on your way home from work. I'll surely be back next week for my \"fix\" and if you wanna join me...well, you're welcome!", "author": "Benjamin F."}

Think Avis \"We Try Harder.\"\n\nCase in point. This place is always my second place if I forget to call Zushi for a resv and they can't take me. I've been many, many times and while it's not the best sushi in town or in the neighborhood, it's always been a pleasant and yummy experience (though skip their miso, it's very sweet). The sushi is fresh, they have a good selection of rolls, sashimi, nigiri and other traditional dishes and the service is lovely but at times slow. All good though. \n\nLast night there was a \"rice issue\" and one of my rolls arrived quite late while my dinner partner was chowing down.

We got there at 6pm\n\nEveryone ended up ordering their food, and ate except for us 4 who were still waiting for our food. We started getting a little impatient but then another 20 minutes went by and noticed a couple, sitting at the bar, got their food and they been seated probably 30 minutes after us.\n\nWhen I approached the server about our food, he didn't say sorry but tried defending himself and the chef. Not okay. \n\nIt's about 830 now. We still haven't received our food and all we want is for the bill to come so we can leave. At this point, we weren't even hungry anymore. All we wanted to do was go home. When I approached him again to see how much longer it would be, he said the chef hasn't started making it yet and it would be another 15-20 minutes. \n\nSo a few of my friends had to step in and plead with them. Still no sorry, no bill, nothing. We finally got 1 roll to go and the server still had the audacity to try and charge me for it.

On our most recent visit, 5 of us walked in late on a Saturday night when there were zero customers dining.  We were told they were getting ready for a large late party and to be patient.  Fair enough, we waited a few minutes and we were seated. We all opted for the all you can drink special and we proceeded to order several rounds of beer and sake.  About 20 minutes after sitting down, we were told we could no longer sit at that table and were forced to move to the sushi bar, this was strange because the restaurant was not even half full at this point.  We were having fun, so we didnt think too much of it.  About 10 minutes after our food came, we were told by the staff to move again.  We protested, but staff was literally grabbing cups and plates and moving them for us - mid meal. Annoyed, we moved to our 3rd table.  The rest of the night was fine as we stayed until they were closing up.  When they brought the bill, it seemed outrageously high and when we investigated, we were charged the $20/person fee for all you can drink, and also charged for 20+ individual drinks amongst our group of 5.  Upon protest, the staff said the all you can drink ended at 10pm which was  never made clear to us at the beginning of the night, nor when they started charging for drinks at 10pm.  We refused to pay the extra charge for the drinks and two of the staff started screaming at us to pay now.  As the reader, your first guess may be that we were drunk and obnoxious which is not the case.  We were polite throughout the whole ordeal, including being moved twice for no reason and had our bill doubled for unjust alcohol charges.  I wouldnt recommend visiting this restaurant.", "author": "Tony S."}

I might be reading too much into the encounter, but the employee we talked to at Zushi Puzzle didn't make me feel like he actually wanted our patronage.  It felt as if, because we had the gall to walk in without a reservation on a Thursday night, we were a nuisance that he felt should not have been there.\n\nIn contrast, the Marina Sushi Bar was almost empty, so we strolled right in and were greeted by a waiter who showed us to our table.  The service was prompt and fairly attentive, and I really liked the atmosphere inside the restaurant.  The decor is nice and it feels very cozy and welcoming.  And because there were only a few other people there, we got to overhear some very interesting conversations at other tables.  They added some welcome entertainment to our meal.  (I try not to eavesdrop, but sometimes you just can't help it.)\n\nMy sushi was quite good.  It tasted very fresh and for the most part had a very nice soft consistency.  Each order of nigiri was served with a thing slice of lemon on the side.  I'm not sure how I feel about this... it added a slight lemony flavor to the first bite of each piece.  It wasn't bad, but it was unusual, and I'm undecided as to whether I liked it.  At any rate, I'm sure you could ask for no lemon slices if you don't want any.\n\nThe rest of my meal was good, too.  I really liked their salad dressing, and the miso soup was just right.  Other reviewers seemed to have found it a bit bland, but I thought it was perfect; I don't like it when my miso soup is so salty that one bowl puts me over the recommended daily limit for sodium intake.  (That's an exaggeration, obviously, but my point is that if you prefer your miso soup to be a little less salty, you'll like the miso here.)\n\nI'm just visiting SF so I can't honestly say that I know how Marina compares to the many other sushi restaurants in the area.  However, I've eaten a lot of sushi in other cities, and I really enjoyed my meal at Marina.  It definitely gets a thumbs up from me.", "author": "Mitch L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-06", "description": "It seems like their main source of customers are the spillover from zushi puzzle and mas sake, the two more popular sushi bars on either side of the place.  The people who were going to Mas Sake might not notice a difference in quality (I mean, they were going to Mas Sake) but if Zushi Puzzle has too long a wait for then Marina Sushi Bar will be a large let down.\n\nThe miso soup was a bit watered down. The salmon sashimi appetizer came out really cold in quite small slices. It wasn't that bad, but it compared badly to the sashimi you can get from nijaya supermarket.\n\nThe marina sushi bar roll was actually quite good. It was baked salmon on top of a crab and avocado roll. I don't think they told us the salmon was cooked on the menu, but considering the quality of their sashimi it was a good choice.\n\nAt this point the gf was refilling her soy sauce and a fly came out of the tea cup. They were very apologetic, and they explained  \"Oh, that happens because we leave the soy sauce holders next to these plants.\"  It's probably a sign that they should get fake plants. \n\nAnother roll involved tuna, shrimp and crab. That's basically what it said on the menu, they failed to add that they doused in garlic sauce.  That's fine if I'm feeling like garlic, but garlic isn't something I'm interested in when I'm getting sushi. It is possible that there was something wrong with the tuna which caused them to do this because my gf couldn't even bring herself to finish the spicy tuna handroll she ordered. My spicy scallop handroll tasted okay, but it was made so the bottom was a little soggy which was weird.\n\nI actually liked the other roll which had unagi and crab inside with some type of roe and a dash of hot sauce on top.\n\nThe service was quite decent, but without consistent quality food backing it up it is hard for that to add up to much. It would also be nice if the menu added more descriptions of what actually went into the rolls beyond the fish inside. If they want to give the customers the option of taking a flier on their chef's creativity they should add the option for omakase rolls.", "author": "Jeff L."}

Given their predeliction for quality ingredients, you really can't go wrong with that.\n\nNote that they have a \"VIP Club\" that entitles you to 30% off their already quite reasonable prices.

I was surprised that the sushi was such good quality!!! Now don't get me wrong, they can't afford to have huge slices of sushi at that price, but still, it is such good quality that you are getting more than your money's worth. Also the service is great! The sushi chefs and waitresses are the best!!! Now I live close to sushi puzzle, an amazing restaurant, but I have to say the service is sub-par, and for the price it's not all that.

And we noticed that most of the sushi rolls read like this, \"__, __, cucumber and avocado.\"  The rolls were all the same. We settled on  spicy tuna, muni, and the one with mango. Meh, nothing excited me and even though i was hungry I didn't want to eat my food.  What annoyed me the most was that the rice on the roll was warm.  I even saw steam come off the rolls when the sushi chef was preparing them.  The service was all over the place and they didn't seem very organized although they were freindly.

You won't regret it) like it was going out of style, with few girlfriends, and we decided  that a late-night sushi dinner was the perfect way to rekindle our relaxation after spending 2 1/2 hours in bumper-to-bumper Marin traffic.\n\nAs we approached Zushi Puzzle with our stomachs grumbling like a thousand tiny earthquakes, we stopped dead in our tracks as we noticed the line out the door!

It looks black. Do you think I should eat it? Maybe it's gone bad. Nah, that's just the blacklight making it look inedible.\"\n\nThe prices were what you'd expect from a wannabe-Manhattan sushi bar and the service was definitely shady.

Miso soup on the other hand seemed mellow.  It's possible that the intense sweetness of the seaweed salad just threw my taste buds out of kilter.  For sushi, I went exclusively with nigiri.  After reading the other reviews, I realize this probably wasn't the way to go.  The rolls seem to be the main attraction here, and there's quite a selection of both your standards (like rock 'n roll, 49er roll) and unique house rolls.     \n\nSo I ordered bigeye tuna, scallop, and and salmon nigiri.  None of them blew me away.  In fact, the tuna was downright disappointing.  It had a very tough texture, so much so that  biting the piece of fish in half was considerably harder than it should have been.  I'm perplexed that the sushi chef even recommended it.  Moving on to the scallop, it was fine though forgettable.  The best of the lot was the salmon.  It tasted fresh, had soft texture and sprinkle of lemon for flavor. \n\nAs inconsistent as the fish was, the supporting elements were strong.  I really liked the firmness and slightly sweet flavor of the sushi rice, and the wasabi/ginger were bolder than your typical sushi bar offerings.\n\nOverall, the price tag just wasn't worth it.  My solo meal, with tip, came out to $32 (I drank tap water).  If ever back, I'll opt for the creative looking rolls.\n\n2.5 STARS", "author": "Leon R."}

My order: 1 Seaweed Salad.  1 49er roll.  I kept my order simple in lieu of the big group we had, but that didn't help much.  By the time\nI got my roll, I had already managed to order 3 regular tacos, 1 empanada, 1 beefy cheesy burrito, 1 crunch wrap, and 1 parfait for one side of the table at Taco Bell down the street (which, after this review, I will be finding and giving them 5 stars; they truly stuck to their 3 minute serving time! Pure awesomeness).  After finishing up a taco outside with a few friends, I felt it was time to go back in and give my roll a chance.  Unfortunately, I was \"welcomed back\" with a lifeless tasteless roll which I tried getting others to eat. ::sigh::  \n\nDon't get me started on the service...\n\nWithin the 2 hour wait period, our waitress managed to make herself comfortable at one end of the table.  She started chopping it up with us, like she wasn't working.  At this point I caught on that she had a little more sake than a waitress should have...yes, that's right, she had more than none.  She honestly was not reading our dismayed and hungry faces right because she went into how customer service is typically ok...\n\nAs we were trying to leave, she even got a bottle of sake for the birthday girl and started pouring it out.  She kept asking where the birthday girl was.  A little annoyed, I sarcastically asked 'Is it your birthday too?'  Response: \"Everyday's my birthday\"  which leads me to believe I won't be coming here again.\n\nRestaurant Tip: Have a non fruity option for plain water enthusiasts.  Thx!\n\nFYI:  I'm typically passive if my service and food are not so great...but this went wayyyy past my comfort zone.  Cheers Marina!", "author": "Abby A."}

Tom, the head sushi chef speaks Mandarin so we love sitting at the bar and chatting it up with him. He trained for years in Japan and, IMHO, his skills are legit. We find ourselves going back every time we have friends/family in town. Tom and his crew treat us like family, so why wouldn't we go back? Not only does the sushi come out presented artfully, but the cuts are generous w/ just the right ratio of rice and they always hook us up there!

What they lack in an unimaginative business name, they make up for in their creative rolls.  \n\nThe sushi chefs are chatty, so much so, that I think it was affecting their work, as they were falling behind on their orders; it took awhile for ours, and a customer became upset when she found herself waiting longer than stated for her takeout.  But I did find our server to go out of her way in making sure we were satisfied with our meals, including offering free dessert when my friend had an issue with one of his rolls.\n\nThe menu is always limited for me at a Japanese restaurant, but I'm happy if they have more than 2-3 types of veg rolls, which they do here, not to mention their salads and tempura.

The sushi bar takes up a moderate portion of the restaurant and offers a nice place to watch your sushi get prepared by the excellent chefs.\n\nThe sushi itself was fresh each time I ate here. As usual, I'd recommend the spicy tuna and spider rolls for first timers. Like other reviews, I've noticed small issues with the service.

There are not many things I hate more than Marina crowd on a Friday night.  (Pete Carrol and the USC Condoms come to mind.)  Since we did not want to wait for over an hour in Ace Wasabi smelling people who smelled and looked like French hookers (and that was just the dudes) we walked over to Marina Sushi Bar for a less striped shirt and olfactory offending meal.  \n\nWe got a table right away.  There is a tremendous selection of rolls here.  We had a tough time selecting, but we managed to get it down to five selections.  We ordered and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...and wait...and wait...and wait...  I think I saw Rome being built on the other side of Lombard while we waited.  \n\nThe food came out so sporadically we lost track of what we ordered.  The edamame and seaweed salad were good.  The seaweed salad came in a more generous portion than most other places.  Plus.  The Moriawase sashimi was very good and very fresh.  Plus.  The Raider Roll was excellent.  Plus.  The Kit's Roll was super excellent but fell apart too easily.  Still a plus.  The Super Dynamite really stood out for me.  Plus, plus.\n\nHowever, it took over two hours for us to get out of there!!!  The service was miserable.  I noticed that all the servers would wander into the back empty handed, usually together, and come back out several minutes later still empty handed.  I kept asking what the hell was going on back there.  The worst of the bunch was a little tramp who was dressed in what amounted to a white napkin wrapped around her.  She really sucked.  She spent all her attention on a couple of guys at the bar and a large group of guys sitting at one table.  Here's a little hint missy, don't piss off all the other customers because your working a group of dudes hard for a large tip.  Those guys are not going to date you and whisk you away from your miserable existence.  They will maybe sleep with you once and throw you away.  \n\nAfter waving at the \"help\" for about 15 minutes we finally got the one of them to get us our bill.  The little tramp then brought it back, and she over charged us by 20 bucks!!!  There was a couple sitting next to us who looked longingly at our table.  Not because of the food we had finished, but because we had managed to get our bill.  \n\nThe food was excellent but little miss thang and the rest of the staff was horrible.  Don't go here if there is a large group of dudes there.  You'll be instantly forgotten.  I really hope the owners read this because I will never go back here.

So if you are going for a drunken, party scene like the one at Mas Sake - this is probably not your place.  But if you actually care about what you are eating - then make the trip!!\n\nMSB is amazing - I have sampled some amazing sushi and MSB is right up there.  It by far out weighs any of the \"so-called\" competition in the Marina.  Ace Wasabis, Red Fish and Mas Sake can definitely learn from the head chef and owner Eric.  Eric is always in a great mood, remembers regular guests and keeps the sake flowing!  The weight staff is chill, always friendly and on point.  \n\nAnd for the food - the fish is great quality and large cuts.  Some of my personal favorites....the spicy scallop is out of this world!!!! It is different from the run of the mill spicy scallop with excess mayo - but has an amazing flavor with just the right amount of spice!  Follow that up with a Cooper handroll, which includes crab salad, tempura shrimp, avocado, lettuce, spicy special sauce..all wrapped up in a soy wrapper....AWESOME!  After having several pieces of Nigri, plus these little treats - finish up with an Eric's special!!  This is something that is unique - and might not be a first pick on the menu....but pay attention long enough and you will see how many of these rolls Eric turns out....simple roll with tempura shrimp, crab salad, cilantro wrapped in a soy wrapper and then.....drum role please......deep fried!!!  Eric tops it off with his special sauce and it seriously blows your mind!!!!\n\nGo to MSB - enjoy the Food....enjoy sake bombs....and then go to a spot that is \"trendy\" - dont waste it on your meal though!!", "author": "Katharine H."}

But the place has got character!  The decor - or lack thereof - combined with the crazy techno beats drives just enough people away that you never have to wait for a table.  If you can get over - or even learn to appreciate - the setting, you will enjoy some of the best sushi in San Francisco.  The sashimi is always super-fresh, the wait staff is very friendly and they have a long list of very creative rolls.  If you go, try the Kit's Roll - its deeeee-lish!", "author": "Erica G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-14", "description": "Pretty good!  But not the best, and not particularly inexpensive at that.  Overall, pretty good value, though.  Some beefs with this fish:  our Tuna looked redder and more gorgeous than any maguro nigiri I've ever laid eyes on, then was tough and grainy in our mouths.  Also, I don't mind unexciting ambience if the food rocks, but it was only good, not great.  Blaring loud trance music is a mistake, especially since no one listens to trance anymore.", "author": "Jes H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-05", "description": "To be honest, I was a bit skeptical upon first entering this restaurant for the sole reason that it wasn't crowded enough. After researching sushi restaurants in the area before leaving, then finding the places we had as Plan A and B were closed, Marina Sushi was our third choice for sushi on a Sunday night. Apparently, lots of sushi places are closed on Sundays!\n\nTo be honest, yet again, and a good thing for a restaurant review, too, I haven't had sushi since....oh I can't even remember. When was it? Last October? September? Back when I decided to go vegan... and then three months or so later, I missed cheese too much and went to just being vegetarian. Well, Sunday night I ate fish. Does that mean I'm a pescetarian now? No, I don't think so. Because sushi is a rare occasion for me because I'm not the kind of sushi lover to pick it up as a quick lunch from some questionable shop. No, I love to make eating sushi a grand experience, complete with the tea, the sake, tempura veggies, edamame, pot stickers, rolls upon rolls that foreshadow what my belly will look like, and nigiri, oh bring it on! So yes, I like my sushi to be an event. I like it to waltz into the room and dance on my table, do a pirouette into my wasabi soy sauce and dive into my mouth in one great mouthful. \n\nThis night was a little bit more laid back. No outlandish dancing slices of fish, but rather dipping of toes into a black pond of saltiness and re-experiencing the delicacy that  good sushi can be. I was slightly nervous at the quality of the fish when I first entered the restaurant. There wasn't even a chef behind the bar. Curious. There were two other tables occupied. Quiet and somber. Foreboding, even. And yet, the tuna and salmon practically melted in my mouth. The California roll was...it was the first time I noticed the cucumber crunching in my teeth! \n\nThe highlights of my night involved the buttery white tuna, the interesting flavor of the fried banana and sweet potato roll, miso soup at the end, and basically the entire enlightening re-encounter with raw fish. Not to mention a really fantastic dinner partner. Would try this again, but I'm always hesitant to say that since there are so many other places to try!", "author": "Kimberly C."}

Zushi Puzzle is great too, but the bar is tiny.", "author": "Myra M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-01-18", "description": "Not a solid 2, more like a 2.5\nI thought the Sonny's delight was a really great roll (shrimp tempura roll with lots of fresh crab on top) - the other rolls we got, I was not too impressed with.  I felt like there was a lot of teriyaki sauce or something on the roll which masked the taste of the fish.  We got the maui roll (mango and tuna) and I decided just to eat the tuna out of the roll and it wasn't that fresh.  We also got the soft shell crab roll - and I thought the soft shell crab was pretty good but the roll itself also had teriyaki sauce in it too.  Truth be told, the night started off poorly with our endamame order - it was way overcooked - and not warm, it was like it had been sitting out for an hour or so.\nThe service was a little dismal - it was like we were constantly looking for our waitress and never managed to track her down when we needed her.\nThe things I really liked about this place was it is a nice atmosphere - not crazy loud like Ace Wasabi's -- and the prices are really good, this place is not pretentious and it feels like a neighborhood mom and pop kind of establishment which is also a nice change from the other restaurants in the marina.", "author": "Katie P."}

The one thing that does set them apart from other sushi spots is the rolls for sure!! They're extremely creative with the rolls and every bite is an explosion of flavor. I actually like how understated it is inside -who says sushi spots have to be trendy and chic people. You are there for the sushi right? If you want that ...bring in your own decor and hook this spot up! Other than that please try the delicious Dragon, Sunrise or Erik's special rolls~", "author": "flo t."}

I went to Marina Sushi Bar last night and was officially traumatized. We were skeptical when we walked in because the restaurant was almost empty, we initially wanted to eat at Mas Sake but it was packed so we settled on MSB. It took about 20 minutes for each individual roll to come out, most of which were different then what was specified on the menu. Spicy rolls were not spicy, cooked scallop rolls were raw.. it was gross.  As the rolls slowly came out we asked what each one was and several times the waitress has no clue what she was serving. One of the rolls being the MSB roll which apparently is the their own signature roll. On top of the food being less then amazing the service was also terrible..
