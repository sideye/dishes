Once a week for five years makes this a neighborhood staple.  \n\nThey also get major props for the salsa bar although none of the options available are particularly spicy.

We both each got a chicken burrito ba\u00f1ado, and he also got horchata. \n\nFirst issue: they charge extra to pay with cards instead of cash. That's fine, and that's their right, but there was no sign about this policy and the woman who took our order didn't mention it. We only noticed when we looked at our receipt. If we had known we would have paid cash, no question. \n\nThen the food came. The horchata was well-done, but the burritos were absolutely inedible. We each took a few bites and left the rest. We were unable to identify the meat as chicken, as it was rather gummy. We probably should have complained to the staff, but we got the impression from the hidden credit card surcharge and the woman's attitude that they would be unsympathetic to our criticism and refuse to refund us. \n\nThis was the culinary lowlight of our week in California, and a shame to end our trip on such a low note.", "author": "Jo O."}

I recommend this taco shop over any in the area for their above average taste, customer service, cleanliness, and and menu options. There is way more to try here than the standard Mexican food, and none of it is run of the mill in taste. Even their salsa bar is on point, everything is housemade daily instead of the canned stuff you get from other taco places. The difference is in the taste, and also the quality of their meat. You can tell when you are being served quality carne asada in your tacos, and this place has the good stuff. \nOk. Let me talk about the orange salsa for 10 minutes: holy hell, this was so good that the first time I tried it I went up to the counter and complimented them to no end, and also begged for the recipe. The orange salsa is NOT something you see at a typical taco shop, it's just one they want to offer and thank God they do because I'd drink this stuff out of a cup if they let me. It's that just right kind of spice that you feel the heat but can continue eating it anyway. The best way to quench your thirst in between eating this salsa, which is a perfect compliment to their freshly made chips, is to sip some of their horchata. I order carne asada tacos just for this salsa, and their cucumber salsa, and their chismol, and literally eat more orange salsa than anything. \nI've brought several friends here and they all have raved about the salsa bar as well, but this place is more than a taco shop. So let's be clear, they have a huge menu of every kind of delicious Mexican dish you can think of. So if you are in the mood for Mexican like it's from your comadre's kitchen you can still come here and be happy with the choices. I'll update more later with taco photos and of course salsas.", "author": "Mona L."}

Until today! The way you changed your Carne Asada plate is terrible. Meat is overfried and almost burned, it's way too dry for beef, which used to be tender and juicy before. Moreover, you're clearly saving on rice and pico de gallo, and keep bringing plastic cutlery most of the times, when reusable forks and knives are available. FYI, we don't order take outs because single use plastics are trashing our planet. Considering all above, there's no point for me to even come back to your place. I'm very dissapointed that you treat your customers this way. We always leave you tips and clean after ourselves, and we don't deserve crappy food.

This is one of the few places to get lengua west of the Mission and it's very good here, perhaps the best meat choice.\n\nI have gripes, though:  (1). They surcharge credit cards but there is no signage advising of that.  The surcharge is greater than my credit card's cash back percentage, so I pay cash here.\n\n(2).  I am getting tired of paying for extras and not getting them.  I usually get food to go and when I have gotten home, on two or three occasions, I  found that my super burritos didn't have the guacamole and sour cream.  Tonight, I paid extra for cheese on my tacos, but there was no cheese on any of them.  I have mentioned being shorted to the cashiers on subsequent visits after being shorted and none has even expressed an interest, let alone offered to make things right. \n\n(3).

Their tacos have super generous portions and they have a great little salsa bar with three or four salsas to choose from. The real star of their offerings is hands down the carnitas. Crispy on the outside, even after being in a burrito, while being tender and flavorful, not to mention consistently good visit after visit, is worth the stop alone. They also do an amazing California style burrito with waffle fries.", "author": "Chris B."}

What we've tried:\n\n- Super Burrito (I forget which meat)\n- Super Quesadilla (Carnitas)\n- Carne Asada Waffle Fries\n\nAll were really good and if my boyfriend and I get two items, we normally have enough leftovers for one more serving. My boyfriend really enjoyed the carnitas and the waffle fries are just a good change from the normal nachos. Crazy to think that this place, probably more catered to the SF State students that live near by, is really good but it is! We'll keep coming back. \n\nAlso, they give some free chips (feels like you get more free chips when you do take out than when you dine in), a few little containers for salsa, restroom for customers, and free water for dining in. Also, I think everything is really reasonably priced. The portions are big! That's basically all that I could ask for in a Mexican restaurant.", "author": "Amanda L."}

For the size of the burrito, the price sounds about right.  You must spend $6.50 to get free chips.

I cut into the relleno and the cheese was a solidified block. No creamy gooeyness at all and the egg white shell on the outside taste as if it had been sitting it for a while. The enchilada was good, but wasn't the saving grace of the dish. Rice and beans were standard fare. The prices are a little high.

We were starving after a long day of work and decided to grab some tacos before the packing and moving commenced. We were so glad we did. \n\nThis is such a hidden gem. Hands down best tacos I've had in San Francisco. I ordered the Lengua and the Asada. The lengua is a go to taco for me. It makes or breaks my experience. Dos Charros went above and beyond my expectation. It's cooked enough where the meat is tender and you don't notice the texture of the tongue and packs a lot of flavor. \n\nSalt on the table. You know a taqueria is legit when they trust the flavor of their meat enough that they don't give you salsa to mask the taste. Great tacos should be enjoyed with salt and lime and their salsa bar is stacked with limes for that reason. Also, the radish here was distinctively good. Surprising because its just radish and it really only serves to cleanse your pallet, but it was fresh, cool, and incredibly crisp.\n\nHighly recommend this place, I was disappointed when it was already closed when I went back to return the uhaul because I was ready for round 2.", "author": "Cody M."}

There were about 2 people eating when we went in. Guy at the cashier was nice. Ordered our burrito and it came about 5 mins after it was ordered. We tried their different sauces which were all good on its own. I was excited to try their burrito due to the good reviews on yelp. The carne asada was tender, the pico de gallo was fresh. I enjoyed each bite until I felt a string as I take my 4th bite. I looked at my burrito and found a hair dangling. I stopped chewing and we called the cashier guy that took our order. I pointed at my burrito. He watched as I pulled out a string of hair out of my burrito. He didnt know what to do for a second. Calmly, He told me nobody has long hair. I told him, you just saw me pull that out of the burrito. He then asked me if I want them to make a new one. At this point I just lost my apetite. I was enjoying my burrito until I found that hair. I said no.  He asked if I wanted to see a manager. I said, yes. He started talking to a guy behind us in Spanish. I don't understand Spanish fluently but I do understand a little. From what I made out of the conversation, the manager didnt seem to believe that there was hair. Claiming nobody has long hair. And the cashier guy told him that we just pulled it out right in front of him. Cashier guy came back to our table, told us he can make me a new one again or just give my money back. I nodded to the latter one. He came back with the money and apologized again and left. I took a picture of the hair and then we left. The manager never went to our table to even apologize. Maybe the food is really good here, the cashier guy did his job and treated us fairly from beginning to end, but to hear the manager talk about you as you are leaving and not even show his face for an apology was absolutely unacceptable. 2 stars for the cashier guy.", "author": "Jerick M."}

This may be off the beaten path, but if your looking for good restaurants, with a casual clean dine in, amazing food, this is the place.", "author": "Hanna Y."}

My go to is the carnitas burrito with black beans. Delicious! The house made salsa are fantastic as well. While I have my \"go to\" spots for Mexican food, this place is a welcome addition closer to my home.", "author": "Brad D."}

I want a good tortilla, quality meat and a nice distribution of ingredients throughout the burrito. I ordered a prawn super burrito and it was awesome. I can't believe how many shrimp were in the burrito and they were cooked perfectly (not over cooked like many places tend to do). Chips were great too. Husband got a carne asada super burrito and his was legit too.", "author": "Brooke G."}

I enjoyed the carne asada taco, it was pretty standard.  The veggie taco was pretty stuffed so I ate the toppings off the tortilla, it was kinda like of a mini burrito bowl.  I did not like the al pastor taco, the pork had a different taste to it, and I did not like it.  Also, the chips they provide are very hard as if they were made very early in the morning or even the day before.  This place is pretty standard mexican fast food.  All in all, the food was an affordable price, I recommend the carne asada tacos with the green salsa.", "author": "Linda C."}
