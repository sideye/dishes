We were looking to kick back and enjoy some beers after eating, and Liquid Gold did just that for us. The parking situation isn't ideal since it's located on a busy big street, so do your best to find street parking nearby on the cross street or a few blocks away...or you can always take public transportation or Lyft! \n\nThe beer selection is very diverse and expansive. We both went with the tasters because there were too many beers for us to take our picks in pints. There are a bit of everything--barrel-aged, sours, stouts, pilsners, New England ales--you name it they practically had it! Our beertender was going solo that afternoon, but service was still courteous and he got the job done. Thanks good sir. I enjoyed how he was not judgmental about the selection of my beers, and he so graciously allowed me to sample the beers I were unsure about before committing to some tasters. Quality man, thank you!\n\nAmbiance has got a cool and relaxed lounge vibe without the loud and trashy music. There's a edgy rocker spirit to Liquid Gold, probably because of the cool overhead gold lamps and the suave bar stools. There are other seating arrangements at the entryway and one bigger table at the end of the bar near the restroom. There is also a fridge stocked full of beers if you're in the mood to take some solid burrs home after a visit in this taproom. 100% will highly recommend coming here for beer snobs and newbs.", "author": "Jodi H."}

I'll tell you why. \n\nFor the first time in years, I managed to get my hands on a CASE of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. I've tried looking for it in Chicago, I've tried looking for it around the city and I've never been lucky enough though maybe I haven't tried hard enough shrug. Oh, I've had it on taps during beer week etc. but never actual bottles! I saw the boxes against the wall behind me and asked the bartender and he casually said yeah, the boxes are full.

No. Not okay. \n\nOkay, I can proceed to my actual review. \n\nThe beer they have there is a great mix of local and non-local brews, and the bartenders are extremely knowledgeable and willing to share their knowledge with you. I did a couple rounds of tasting flights, and he was willing to create a flight for me based on my tastes and preferences. All of the beers he picked were delicious. The next time I came I just picked my own, but it's nice to have such great folks who can help you on your way if you are a little lost or overwhelmed by the selection.\n\nInsert old-lady comment here: I love how the electronic menu is easily changed and updated, but it's a little hard to see from all places in the bar. Maybe a chalkboard? Some cheap paper menus they can print easily?", "author": "Kristy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-31", "description": "After being spoiled by bomb breweries in San Diego for the past two years, I went on a quest to find good beer in SF. While this isn't a brewery, the fact that they served beer flights instantly appealed to me. It's a pretty small bar located in a quieter part of lower Nob Hill, not too far from the Tenderloin, so I could definitely see myself pregaming with beer here before heading down to bars on Polk. It wasn't packed when my friend and I arrived around 845 on a Friday night but more people came in later on - I liked that it never got overcrowded though. Pretty cool that they have a giant fridge of bottled beer (to be purchased?), a self-serve water station with glass cups, and Jenga! \n\nWe both got flights of beer, which are $3/5oz for however many pours you want; certain beers are pricier as noted on the menu. Easily our favorite beer of the night was a Russian Imperial Stout from Half Moon Bay, which was a little thick with a rich chocolate/coffee flavor. I think it was on par with stouts I've sampled from Ballast Point in SD, and apparently very popular among other customers as well because they ran out by 10pm! I also liked the Belching Beaver peanut butter milk stout, another SD beer, which didn't have excessive peanut butter flavor. Every other drink we tried was pretty standard, nothing too special about them. The only one I didn't like was the Thirsty Bear Devil's Milkshake, which had a weird strawberry flavor, as if the sweetness had been watered down a lot. BUT the beers on tap are constantly changing so it's great that you can sample new beers at such a low price.\n\nThe storefront isn't very bright or recognizable but I guess that allows them to stay lowkey. Parking doesn't appear to be too difficult if you come early enough, but I would recommend uber/lyft/busing to stay on the safe side :) The bartenders are all super friendly and even struck up a conversation with us when he saw us playing pokemon LOL. I wish they served food (or bar snacks at least) but this is definitely the place to be if you wanna have a chill night or try out beers from a variety of breweries!", "author": "KC W."}

More please.\n\nMeh:\n- Dogfish Head black and blue: way too funk / sharp for me.\n- Almanac Farmer's reserve strawberry: not much taste other than overwhelming sourness - kind of like kombucha\n- Altamont berry white: just OK, not a good balance of berry\n- Berryessa Propaganda Pils\n- Stillwater Stateside: Hoegaarden-y\n- Evil Twin Soft dk:  it supposedly had vanilla but we mostly tasted the high alcohol content - 10.4% in an \"imperial\" stout.\n\nOh right, about that boo-boo: the beer I was most excited about - the faction chocolate milk stout - was listed on the online menu.

The bartenders, Brandon and Janelle, are helpful and friendly. The selection of beer has something for everyone.

The owner, Tim Lee greeted me warmly.  He was with a sales rep introducing selected wines from a winery in Paso Robles.  Being one of a few patrons in the bar (door just opened), Tim asked if I would like to participate in doing some tasting of the wines the sales rep brought.  An offer I cannot refuse! I love wine!! I got to taste one of their rare Chardonnay they sell on tap, a Cabernet and Sangiovese.  All delicious and tasty!  I hope Liquid Gold will be serving these wines in the future.\n\n3rd visit, Friday night, me and a couple of girlfriends came here to have a few beers and wine before dinner.  They each had 2 beer flights.  A tasting of 4 different beers suggested by the knowledgeable staff depending on your taste.  I had their Cellars 33 Chardonnay on tap.  Loved it!  They even had a bubbly on the menu that night.  All tasty and delicious.  \n\nI love the comfort of the bar.  Although I prefer the bar seats, they also offer a cozy couch and a long table with bench seating for bigger groups.

I have not been to Texas and tried places like the Salt Lick or other highly rated Q places, but this must be as good. Everything was cooked absolutely perfect. You can taste the vinegar, sugar and whatever else is used in just the perfect amounts in each bite. Not too sweet, not too sour, just amazing. I had ribs, chicken, brisket, beans and collard greens. Even the greens had bits of meat in it which must be something you only see in the South because I've never seen it here.

I am beyond happy that I decided to go, I fell in love at first sight. Located right opposite Trader Joes, it may be a little hard to miss as it is tucked away between store fronts. The Gold signage should catch your eye along with their large windows. \n\nHere are many reasons why I love this spot: \n1) The owners are AMAZING, they are so nice and friendly.. they make this place what it is. Tim is so nice and we were able to have several conversations with him about the business. They made my friends and I feel so special and welcome, and always remember us! Perfect example of how bars should be. \n2) Beverages: They have beer and Wines from all over the Bay Area, the Bartenders can recommend beers that you may like. The first time I asked for the beer tasting of 4 beers and told them to choose for me.  They also have beer and wine for purchasing at the back, just like a store - genius. \n3) Snacks and bar food: When we first started coming here, they would give our free popcorn, chocolates, and trail mix.. not sure about now but boy, that was a treat. They have bar food from the Chinese restaurant next door, i HIGHLY recommend the salt & pepper wings. Because of Liquid Gold, I eat at the Chinese restaurant often. \n4)Crowd - Everyone wears plaid here, so i recommend investing in a plaid shirt and popping in. Great crowd, very laid back. \n\nThey also have TV's here, great place to watch the game. I watched the World Series here and they gave everyone free champagne after the big win. \n\nYesterday (2/12) they had a food pop-up, they were selling bread pudding (YUM), pork noodles, beef jerky, and another item. \n\nAs you can tell, YOU have to check out to this place.

When I first went to Mikkeller bar, just after it opened, I was incensed at the frou frou glasses beer was served in.  Beer in wine glases...   Age teaches you many things (if you're willing to learn, or else you become one of those horrid old men walking down the street cursing the world, aloud) and one of them is to recognize an Issue, and when to simply accept that something isn't going away.  Frou frou beer glasses aren't going away.  I'm not even going to waste time on the idea.  Liquid Gold is one of those new beer bars with Frou Frou glasses.\n\nLots of beer to choose from, from several taps behind the bar---although they don't produce any of their own, and I didn't notice any cask capacity, and didn't think to inquire.  I confined myself to IPAs, amazed to discover the range available just in that one style---and one I thought I knew!  The staff, one of which was the owner, was quite friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to.  And it turned out that one of our bar stool neighbors was an employee of Drakes, and so even more beer knowledge was available for the asking.   All in all a very fine afternoon, and then, as we left, around five, the bar began to fill up.\n\nIt's a long, narrow space with high ceilings, bar on one side, bathroom and cooler in the rear.  It's all done in a battle ship gray paint, with a vinyl coated wood bar that looks gray as well.  The cooler is amply stocked with bottles of beer, not limited to that which is on tap...\n\nAnd that is the one gripe I have with this bar.\n\nWine is available ONLY by the bottle.  And if you buy wine, or beer by the bottle,  you have to pay a corkage fee as well.  Now why is this?   Corkage fees exist to allow businesses to make some money off of those who insist on bringing their own wine to a restaurant, and to discourage customers from doing so, especially this close to wine country.  Why is a bar that is selling beer, and wine by the bottle, with its own mark-up, also adding a corkage fee?  I don't understand, and I DON'T like it.  I'd take away a star if there wasn't so much beer available on tap, such that I don't see any need to buy a bottle.   If this wasn't a Beer Bar, I'd also be miffed that I can't order wine by the glass, but it is a Beer Bar so expecting wine is something like eschewing Rum at a tiki bar.\n\nSo, all is well and I wish this bar good success and hope to make it one of my haunts.", "author": "Paul T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-30", "description": "Liquid Gold is a great neighborhood beer bar and shop, located on Hyde. Our crowd of 4 people found an easy spot to settle for a nightcap. The space is basically long and narrow-- the bar itself runs along a majority of the right wall, with a majority of seats along the bar. I don't know if this would be the best spot for a large group-- we were there on a Thursday evening, so the crowd situation was very easy to manage. However, I couldn't imagine a group of 6+ people being able to sit comfortably and converse as a group.\n\nAs you would guess, they have a great selection of beers on tap, as well as an extensive fridge of bottled beer. A digital menu shows their offerings, although I found it a bit difficult to read (Perhaps I'm getting old). \n\nWe only stayed for one drink, and \"last call\" was announced around 10:30, so this isn't a late-night spot, but more of a post-dinner spot.  I didn't take tons of time to peruse, but the bottled beer selection was extensive. I can imagine that it serves the Nob/Russian hill clientele very well-- especially after shopping at Trader Joe's across the street.", "author": "Bryan B."}

Obviously my expectations were high, but fortunately for me this place met - nay - EXCEEDED them.\n\nLiquid Gold not only has excellent selection of local beers on tap, but they have several fridges of tall boys to buy and carry out OR enjoy right there at the bar (with corkage fees of course). Many of the beers I saw in the fridges I have never seen elsewhere too, which gives this place some serious points.\n\nIf you like City Beer Store, then you'll enjoy this place as well. CBS may have a larger selection of purchasable beers, but Liquid Gold has a better draft line in my opinion. Also, pound for pound (drop for drop?) I think LG has a better selection of beer given their space.\n\nFinally, the owner, Tim, seems like a very genuine guy. He's always been exceedingly friendly, helpful and very willing to bring in beer that you want to see on his shelves. He's a local boy, too, so you know he's got his finger on the pulse of the beer industry of the area.\n\nFinal word: Liquid Gold is exactly what this neighborhood needed!", "author": "Brendan B."}

Great selection of choice local brews, friendly, conversational staff and solid layout. For that, I really want to give five stars but kept it at three due to being priced higher than it should. \n\nBasically all pours are 12 oz. (believe there may be a couple that are 10 oz.). Totally get that--some beers, whether due to rarity, high ABV, ingredients etc. are going to be different prices and different size pours. The issue here is the brews that are more widely produced (and retail for $8 a six-pack) should be a $5 or $6 16 oz. pint and instead are a $7 or $8 12 oz. pour. \n\nEnd of the world? Absolutely not; especially considering some of the great beers they bring in. But in general, it's priced too high for me to be able to go as much as I do other places of its ilk. Being a brand new place, there's a chance those prices dip down once they establish themselves and build revenue.\n\nAt any rate, a very nice addition to the neighborhood and worth checking out.", "author": "Steve B."}
