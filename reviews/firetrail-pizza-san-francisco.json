Hoenstly, if I could order all my pizza crusts like this I would because the flavor was distinct but not too drastic, so I paired well with any toppings.\n\nI ordered the mushroom and sausage and it was cooked perfectly. I have to say the sauce really made the pizza as delicious as it was. It was super tomatoey and tasted like pur\u00e9ed fresh tomatoes cooked right on the pan, not like canned pizza sauce.

Why pay restaurant prices with no seating and no porcelain throne?\n\nFor the love of our furbaby, that's why.\n\nSoMa StrEat Food Park has become our weekend rotation because they're super dog friendly. While we grub, Tater Tot sniffs butts. A win-win situation!\n\nI had a hankering for Asian food but all the Asian food trucks used MSG. I yelped Firetrail Pizza and they had solid ratings so I decided to give them a shot. That particular Saturday, they only had three types of 10-11 inch Neapolitan pizzas available: Cheese ($10), Pepperoni ($11), and Pesto ($12). I'm not sure why some people are complaining about the price because pizzas of this size and caliber are usually $13-$18. CC's accepted. \n\nPizzas are cooked in their mobile wood-fired oven, and are ready in less than 5 minutes. They also offer delivery but Neapolitan pizzas are always best, hot out-of-the-oven. \n\nMr. NSS wanted a meat pie so I ordered the Pepperoni for us to share: http://bit.ly/1ErF2yI. The leopard spotted crust was flavorful with a great, toothsome chew. The bottom crust had a subtle char giving it a nice smoky nuance (foldable and not soggy). The tomato sauce was bright and tangy.

Even more who would have thought these pizzas would be as good as some brick oven pizza joints? Top it off with offering a gluten free crust that doesn't taste like it's made of cardboard and you have something truly special. Their crust is really thin and crispy with a good flavor. \n\nOne thing about the gluten free crust they'll be sure to tell you is if you're really sensitive or allergic it's not for you. When I asked they said because of \"how it's made.\" Reading other reviews and thinking about it, I can see why. The gluten free pizza shares the same cooking surface, cutting board, and utensils as the regular pizzas. Fortunately it's not a problem for me but if you have allergies or celiac you will probably want to avoid eating here. \n\nThey are a pretty common vendor at the SOMA Street Eats food truck park (just look for the truck with a brick oven on the back). They usually have a selection of four to six selections, but you can add other toppings if you like. \n\nI've been a few times, but one visit stands out. I ordered a pizza that was all veggies and I decided to add some pepperoni. They told me to come back in five to ten minutes and my pizza would be ready. I came back and there was a pizza on a plate. The lady working the counter told me they had realized they forgot to put my pepperoni on my pizza. Before I could ask if this was going to be an issue or how they were going to resolve it, she said we'll give you this pizza and we've got another one in oven being made that's got everything including your pepperoni for you to take with you. I was pleasantly surprised by how far they went to make it right!!! She could have probably slapped some cold pepperoni on my pizza and called it done. It wouldn't be as good and I probably wouldn't have known why. In the age of dying customer service, I figure that alone is worth a shout out.\n\nThere's one other thing that I feel is worth mentioning. To me it's more of a positive than a negative and I feel it's typical of a lot of brick oven pizzas I've had. If you insist on perfectly consistently cooked pizza brick oven pizza may not be for you. I understand that brick oven pizzas cook at such a high temperature that a minute can be the difference between a pizza that's perfectly cooked and one that's burnt. Personally I don't mind a little char and that adds some of what makes brick oven pizza, well, brick oven pizza. There's a little bit of a craft required to made good brick oven pizza and I thought they did a great job. \n\nIf you see them and you're in the mood for good, thin crust brick over pizza, then this is the place for you.

Maybe it's considered good by all the gluten free eaters out here. If you want good pizza and are not worrying about being health conscious, there are so many places in the city that are WAY better (Tonys, Carmel Pizza Company, Delfina, Golden Boy, etc.).

The crust was also a lot better, with an actual bite to it. To fix the salad they added tomatoes, red bell peppers, onions, and provided the dressing. I appreciate Jed reaching out to make things right, after being unsatisfied. I give this place 4/5 for the customer service and for the yummy pizza, as many restaurants don't try to reach out of take suggestions to make things better. :)", "author": "Nicole L."}

Mine happened to be charred more than I'd like mine to be that day. This was my second visit to Firetrail and besides the extra char this time, my pizza was consistent with my first visit. \n\nBut I want to note their \"service\" is terrible. We came by to order and we might as well ordered with a robot. No greeting, no smile. The only time I heard her voice was when she told me the price being charged to my card. Somehow, I still gave a 15% tip for the same exchange that I could have had with a vending machine but that's on me. No, I don't expect small talk about current events or the weather but welcoming a paying customer with a greeting is customary, no? \n\nI found a table near the truck while I waited so she can see me. Every few minutes i'd look her way and see her fiddling on her phone and after 10 minutes of waiting goes by I start to wonder if my order was ready. Perhaps I was supposed to stand there staring at her the entire time? Mind you, no other patrons ordered after me so my order was the only one they were preparing. I thought she would motion for me or yell that my order was ready since she never told me when to check back in for the finished pizza or any mention of what to expect. The last time I ordered from them they walked my pizza over to me (which I realize is an exception and not what they normally do) because they had to remake my pizza. So I go up and see my pizza was just sitting at the pick up window and it looks as though it had slightly cooled off. Again, no words when I went back to pick it up. I realize I should have asked when i should come back but I don't think it's too far fetched to be told what to expect upon ordering. \n\nSo anyway she wordlessly handed me the plate, no \"thank you\" from her (I still managed to say \"thanks\") and then she resumed fiddling away on her phone. I don't believe she is an owner, perhaps hired help because it was very clear to me she did not care how customers perceive Firetrail.

They all worked cohesively as a team and knew exactly how to manage food prep, service, and clean-up.

Recently, I had a small mistake on one of my orders and the owner Jed personally called me to take care of it. What else can someone ask for? So many place these days do not appreciate their customers or underestimate the power of word of mouth. If you want the best wood fire pizza in SF from business owners that care look no further! Thank you Firetrail Pizza and thank you Jed! Best truck at SoMa park:-)", "author": "Jeff M."}

An interesting combination that proved to be a very memorable day. The pizza was amazing - the salmon on the first one was fresh caught by one of the partners just the day before and it melted in your mouth and made that pizza into an unforgettable treat. My other favorite was a carmelized onion pizza that was so simple, but the flavors were so wonderful together. And all the pizzas really worked well with the wine we were drinking. Outside on a deck in the wine country, does it get any better?\n\nKari & her team were great, personable, full of interesting tidbits about the food and preparation and also a lot of fun.\n\nI would definitely have Firetrail cater an event. The variety of pizzas they do can fit any style event and they are very professional as well as having an amazing product.", "author": "Lisa H."}

We found out your operation hours from your website.  Made plans to meet there to try you out after work before suffering through the Bay Bridge traffic.  We were there at 5:15. You set out the menu board and left your drink cooler in front of your trailer. We waited and waited for you to open.  But you never came back.  We couldn't wait any longer.  We were starved and couldn't wait any longer.  We went to Chairman and Melt instead.  Perhaps you could have put a sign on the menu board or on the trailer, letting customers know when you would return to open.  Can't say we weren't bummed.", "author": "Kai N."}

Kari jumped right in and started helping to design a menu, she offered to organize the linens and plates and suggested creating a Tuscan theme night.  She met with the church organizer where the dinner was planned and drove over on her own time to scope out the site.  In the end, she created a beautiful setting with candles, flowers and tuscan style table clothes and dinnerware.  The church reception hall was turned into an intimate Italian restaurant.\n\nAnd then there was the pizza.  The pizza was amazing!  Our guests couldn't get enough!!  They were made with fresh ingredients and she offered a variety of unique flavors.  She also had fresh salads and homemade cupcakes.  \n\nBut what made the experience really memorable with Kari's personal touch.  She was easy to work with, she devoted her time to making my party her priority and she wanted to know things about us and our families to help tailor the experience to us.  I would recommend Kari and Firetrail to anyone looking for incredible food and a fun experience!", "author": "Adrian S."}

I was a little nervous to try it because the other pizza truck there was a huge disappointment when I tried it a couple months back. However, we were intrigued and decided to give it a try. We ordered the margarita with the fresh greens on top. Th crust was nice and chewy and the sauce was so so good. We loved it so much that we decided to go back and order another. We ordered the sausage. I didn't try it since I am a vegetarian, but my sister-in-law and daughter loved it! I am not sure why so many other people choose that other pizza truck, it is total crap compared to this delicious pizza. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I personally like a crispy, crunchy crust. However, if you like your crust chewy you will give this 5 stars. Try it you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Melissa J."}

The problem I see with this company is that they need a pizza parlor, and fast.  The usual, run of the mill, generic, cheese/pepperoni will not do anymore.  Thin tasty crust, creative combinations and, get this, dessert pizzas will be what they will require from this day forward.  No more cardboard for these little guys and I can't say that I blame them.  Awesome people running an awesome mobile, wood-fired pizza oven.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-05", "description": "I went to a private party catered by Firetrail Pizza last Friday evening. The Firetrail Pizza folks have a new wood-fired mobile \"pizza wagon.\"  The hand-built pizzas are constructed before your eyes and then popped into the oven, from which they emerge -- crispy, sizzling, bubbling and delectable -- about 90 seconds later. The pizzas were coming out of the oven in fast and furious fashion and being devoured within seconds. The operators--gorgeous Kari and athletic Jed--are lots of fun. While the pizza was supposed to be the food at the party, the Firetrails pizza oven became the centerpiece of the entire party. After people ate their fill, Kari and Jed served \"s'more pizzas\" -- melted chocolate-and-marshmallow atop crispy pizza crust. \n\nI'm planning to hire Firetrail Pizza for my next big bash.", "author": "George F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-06", "description": "I am a pizza snob. In my pizza world, the texture of crust is critical, the flavor of the sauce can make or break the whole experience, and the quality of cheese and toppings reveals the integrity of the chefs. My one visit (of many to come) to a roving Firetrail Pizza location was my most satisfying pizza indulgence since the last time I was in New York City. The crust! Perfect thickness and lightness! It was only in the wood-fired oven for a couple minutes, it seemed. How'd they do that? The sauce had a subtle sweetness to it which again reminded me of NYC pizza. I tried several tasty toppings... all organic, I'm pretty sure. The pizzas are fairly small for a guy my size so I did lots of sampling. And they aren't heavy and greasy like so many pies around here. As you can tell, I am a big fan. I hope they put up a website so I can track down their oven-on-wheels whenever I'm dying for great pizza.", "author": "geoff v."}
