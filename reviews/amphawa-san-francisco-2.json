I've never heard of it nor tried and it easily became one of my favorite desserts and I'm pretty simple when it comes to desserts; more so on the less-sweet sorta spectrum. Here's my description on it: flat, flaky, buttery, croissant-like crust, with a slightly chewy dough, which couldn't have paired any better with ice-cream (I actually asked for the condensed milk on the side, I feel like that was a good call).  GAH, it was so good, and I'd visit SF again just for the Roti. I also hear there's so many variations to eating it. Ah, so much to learn about this delicious pancake!\n\nOk! The food! I just discovered after reading other reviews that the dish I got was a super authentic Thai noodle, ya know the exclusive--which always turns to be those awesome dishes, and it was! I got (#94) Guai Jubb which is a pork themed noodle dish: pork broth (house special broth), pork entrails (innards), egg, crispy pork belly and square rolled up noodles! It was so yummy and fun to eat. My friend got a pretty simple dish, crispy pork belly stir fry with Chinese broccoli and side of rice--smelled AMAZING and tasted great. \n\nWould def recommend this casual place and would come again (mostly for roti). I can't stop thinking about it...", "author": "Polina S."}

Honestly, why does this always happen when I want to try new things? I ordered a delivery and they called me after telling me they didn't have one of the items in stock and that I would have to go through delivery.com to get a refund. It was such a hassle having to call them and being put on hold for 10 minutes to get a refund. Super disappointing. Then the delivery came over TWO HOURS later. Won't order from here again. \n\nI saw that the delivery time would be 45-75 minutes and I waited and waited more than 75 minutes. I called the restaurant after waiting an hour and a half and they said it would be 15 MORE minutes. \n\nKeep in mind, this was on a Tuesday night and I only live 1.5 miles away! I've never had to wait this long for a delivery. Shame. \n\nEXTREMELY Poor Service from the restaurant saying they would call the driver and get back to me but never did.\n\nUpdate: The food came cold, leaked in the bag, and was unedible. I called to get a refund and they said I had to go through delivery.com. Called delivery.com and they told me to call the restaurant. After another 10 minute hold, I called the restaurant and they told that in order to receive the refund, I had to return the food. I returned the food back to the delivery driver and he had the audacity to yell at me and screamed why I didn't say anything about the order when I received it. I calmly replied that it was 10:30PM and it's dark outside so I'm unable to see through a completely opaque white bag. I had realized the food was completely spilled when I got back inside my house. After this entire ordeal, and just wanting to eat some Thai food, I still haven't received a refund yet.", "author": "Angel D."}

My first impression was that the tables were somewhat too closed to one another, but its okay because my friend and I wanted to try out their Thai food. \n\nWe sit down and we had to wait a while for the waitress to come stop by our table to take our order. It's disappointing to say the least because we were sitting literally next to the cash register and I'm pretty sure one of the waitress saw our glances. Nonetheless, the service was a bit lacking.\n\nWe ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp and the Rad Na with Chicken (Noodles with the gravy sauce. Portions are definitely big, but there was quite a lot of oil in it. In addition, the Pad Thai had an odd aftertaste to it. \n\nOverall, we paid around $25 for the two dishes without tax.

I did not know this when I visited -  but heads up to any unsuspecting Thai food lover out there! \n\nI came here on a Saturday night at 10:00pm. I called ahead at 9:50pm to see if we could make a reservation. The person on the phone was a little brisk, and firmly notified me that they close at 11pm, but that they had seating available. That didn't seem like a problem as we were super close by and really craving Thai food. However, I should have taken that phone call of a sign of the abysmal customer service we were about to receive. \n\nWe arrived to a pretty much empty restaurant.. except for a group of 5-6 employees sitting down and eating. We were quickly shown to a table, and placed our orders. Menu was pretty diverse and they had a lot of different drinks at great prices. Our waitress was super curt, anxious, and honestly seemed like she wanted us to leave ASAP. I know the struggle of customer service but when your restaurant is an HOUR away from closing (again.. they close at 11pm) there really isn't an excuse. \n\nFood was OK. Certainly not worth the rave reviews on yelp. The Pad Kee Mao appeared almost white and the noodles were cut up really short, which was strange. \n\nShe quickly brought us the bill at 10:30pm. As we were still finishing up our food and chatting, she returned at 10:35pm and pushed our bills closer to us (LOL). I honestly couldn't believe what was happening. We were out of the restaurant by 10:40pm.. a full 20 minutes before they closed! \n\nA word to management: If your employees are so eager to close the restaurant at 10pm.. by all means change your closing time to 10pm or hire different employees for the night shift.", "author": "Natalie F."}

It was my first time eating here and to be honest I did not even know this place existed. It was one of my co-workers the one who told me about it. We did not have much time so we ordered our food right away. We got a salad with mango, red onions, grated coconut and shrimp. We both liked it a lot and I am sure whenever I come back I'll be getting it again. The other entree was a dish with rice, beef, cucumbers and peanut sauce. In my opinion it was totally bland, and not even the powerful sauce was enough to make the dish more appealing. My co-worker was happy with it and he ate most of it.

It's generally very easy to get a table when doing a walk-in, the food is reasonably priced, and the quality of the food is pretty decent. The menu here is quite large, but I pretty much stick to the things I know. \n\nThis past week I visited the restaurant with a friend and we ordered the crispy calamari which came with the house sweet and sour sauce. This item is definitely one of my favorites, however I did notice that they've gone down in portion size. It somewhat looked like somebody tried a couple pieces in the back and then brought them to our table. Then we had the Tom Yum prawn soup, which was very flavorful and had very many prawns to my surprise. We also ordered a very simple chicken fried rice, which is extremely good. The rice is always fresh, with little bits of egg and a whole lot of chicken pieces. Then we had the saut\u00e9ed tofu with mixed veggies, which was full of flavor. The veggies were crunchy and the tofu was saut\u00e9ed to perfection. Lastly we tried a new dish, which I believe was called grilled barbecued beef steak. This meat dish came with a side of some incredibly delicious sourish sauce. I'm not sure what it was, however, paired with the barbecued meet, it was spectacular. The flavor was out of this world and I would've been up to ordering a second order of it. \n\nDefinitely a restaurant I'd recommend for anyone who loves a good Thai meal. It's very much authentic based on what I've seen. The servers are also very kind and helpful, but they do tend to do their own thing at times and it becomes hard to get their attention. Because I love their food, I don't really focus in on that too much, but for some it may be annoying.", "author": "Julia K."}

My grandma and I were on our way to Dragon Beaux however wanted to mix it up and stopped in. It is a relatively small restaurant that seems family-owned and has very high quality of food; I think they take great care in preparing their dishes. We had the shrimp pineapple red curry and instead of rice we asked for thick flat rice noodles which was amazing, and also another curry noodle soup with flat rice noodles. So many complex flavors! We heard the table next to us talking about how he comes here and orders something different every time and is not disappointed and I could believe that. Will come back.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

A bit plain as well in terms of the ingredients and only 3 pieces of shrimp. \n\nPad Thai shrimp - 4\nStandard pad Thai; good noodles and sauce on this one.\n\nPumpkin curry with beef - 3.5\nSeems like a popular one according to Yelp and its featured on their website. It was good, particularly the chunks of pumpkin, but I wouldn't say amazing. \n\nSteamed chicken with garlic rice - 4.5\nThis was our surprising favorite. The garlic rice was delicious, with loads of garlic and the rice a perfect balance of steamed and sticky. Aromatic. The chicken was a good complement and reminded us of a Vietnamese dish that involves steam chicken, rice, and sauces. \n\nRepeater.", "author": "Will H."}

The place is clean and looks nice. \n\nSecond, most of the food is delicious. The curries are good, but I really recommend their pad sa ew. I also really like their Guai Jubb, which is a soup with pork belly, entrails, and pork blood. I know some people are turned off by that, but I personally love it. The soup is delicious and it comes with rolled up, thick, rice noodles. A few of my friends actually think the noodles are too hard or seem uncooked, but I like them! I guess you'll just have to try it to see! :) \n\nLastly, the reason why I am giving 3 stars is because of the service. Although all the servers were quite nice, I wasn't fully happy because our waitress was quite pushy. She seemed very impatient when we were ordering. I understand it can be frustrating being a server, especially if it's busy, but it just seemed like she was annoyed all night. When we were given the tab, she kept coming back and asking if we needed more boxes. While I was putting my food away into containers, she grabbed the containers from me and said, \"I help you!\" and kept doing that until all our food was packed away. It just seemed kind of rude. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I will update this review if the service seems to improve. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place because the food is good, but I did not appreciate the service we received.", "author": "Christina C."}

This district is home to what I consider to be the best area for Dim Sum in the whole city, but it's also an underratted place for great for Thai food. Amphawa is the perfect example of that, as they truly execute on flavor and service. Not to say they don't have their kinks, as service can be slow on a busy days, but there's no denying they know what they're doing in the kitchen. Quick side note: these guys have quite possibly the best Thai iced tea I've ever had, as well as some of the best hot tea I've ever had. That good.\n\nOn my recent visit, I had an order of the chicken satay (with the best damn peanut sauce on earth), the pad-see-ew with veggies and red curry with chicken. What can I say? I may be a hardcore Thai fanatic, but that's also something that makes me a tough critic since I look for only the best. I can definitely put Amphawa in my top 5 list for Thai food. Other than the absolutely delicious food, thier ambiance is just awesome. It's a very small place, cozy and welcoming. I'll be the first to admit that the staff who work here are hit and miss, as some days the pressure of a packed place can get to them, but they are always incredibly friendly people. Pro tip: the best way not to hit the dinner rush and get perfect service is going there at 5pm. Enjoy :)", "author": "Alex B."}

The food is authentic Thai, and they are not afraid to season the food properly. The coconut soup is outrageously good, and the service is consistently first rate. The waitress that served us had a great sense of humor as well! They have an open kitchen and you can see that everything is cooked from fresh ingredients, none of the frozen pre prepared food you get from some Thai restaurants. An open kitchen is always a good sign. Also their bathroom is clean and the tables are clean. The only thing that distracts from the experience is the blaring TV.

Then I remembered why - I keep going!  Hard to finish a review when I keep trying more dishes.  Then again, even more reason to do it now, before I end up going back again...\n\nWhile Lers Ros and Kin Khao are my top Thai restaurants in SF, Amphawa has been my go-to spot for years.  It's the epitome of convenient for me - never a wait for a table, parking is easy, an extensive menu, fair prices, and, most importantly, really good food.  Service can be hit or miss (see below), but it's fine for the most part.\n\n-- HOY TOD - Mussel Pancake with Bean Sprouts & Secret Sauce...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#Y6NiGlu7X3dl4bNdIVwB3g)\nIt was listed on a separate menu page, but don't miss it.  The crunchy exterior and soft interior were great, but I loved all that mussel flavor!\n\n-- #9 ANGEL WINGS - Fried Chicken Wings with Chili Garlic Sauce & Crispy Basil...$8.95\nFirst time - (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#x5FB63WQTq6RMexjOy_lYQ)\nSecond time - (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#RlJxTi1eW6adSVKngCPv4w)\nMarnee Thai's are more well known, but these CAN be just as good.  They just aren't consistent; the wings are juicy and crispy, but the second time, the sauce wasn't as good (or plentiful).\n\n-- #14 ROTI WITH CURRY - Thai Pancake with Choice of Curry (Green Curry Sauce)...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#3myHxY4DiH1NooPVi2SuXg)\nPretty simple, but pretty darn good.  The roti had the perfect consistency and I liked the sauce, even though It could have been a little thicker to help it stick to the roti.\n\n-- #48 KAO KA-PROW MOO KROB - Sauteed Crispy Pork Belly with Chili, Onions, Bell Peppers, and Basil over Rice...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#FWBdUHFgev8be6VHkyADQw)\nAs a pork belly fanatic, this was easy for me to enjoy.  Every piece was so juicy and I loved how flavorful the sauce was.  Slightly sweet with just a touch of spice.\n\n-- #102 CRISPY CHICKEN & FRIED RICE served with Sweet & Sour Sauce...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#D-iaGL2nrYWN8-ELzg7U0A)\nThe chicken wasn't bad (a little dry, very crispy), but they gave me white rice instead of fried rice.  What's worse, when I told our server, she tried to argue that's how it's served, despite the menu saying otherwise.\n\n-- #70 CHAN PAD POO - Stir Fried Spicy Thai Noodles with Dungeness Crab, Egg, and Green Onions...$12.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#Nj4pE-SxbUn9M51mZ_4bSw)\nOne of my favorite Thai dishes, and it's pretty awesome here.  The portion is deceptively large and has the perfect spiciness.  Plus, there's so much crab!\n\n-- #41 KAO MOO KROB - Crispy Pork Belly & Chinese Sausage Topped with Secret Gravy Sauce...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#NQ8MfrLnJv8UDmo75aj9NA)\nIt felt more Chinese than Thai, but decent nonetheless.  The pork belly's skin was really crispy and the sausage was so juicy.\n\n-- #50 KOR MOO YANG - Grilled Pork Shoulder with Chili Sauce...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#OgTID8EG6Uzpznbp53bftw)\nIt's served a la carte, so I added a side of brown rice for $2.  Some pieces were a little fatty, but the dish as a whole was really tender and flavorful.\n\n-- #13 KEAW TOD - Fried Shrimp and Pork Wonton served with Sweet and Sour Sauce...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#613AHUVN8M70rkvxC72_kQ)\nThe wontons were a bit dark (couldn't tell if it tasted overcooked or if the oil was old), but the filling was pretty tasty.\n\n-- #77 AMPHAWA NOODLES - Flat Rice Noodles topped with Ground Chicken, Green Bean, Onions, & Bell Peppers...$9.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#E18eA3UzZ7KxKaQ4wyhMnA)\nWe subbed out the chicken for beef, but either would've been good.  The noodles were soft and feathery and the dish was well seasoned.  Really good!\n\n-- #108 PRA RAM - Choice of Meat (Chicken) & Mixed Vegetables with Peanut Sauce...$11.95 (a la carte)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#dlFG4WbMfDkVvxF6WPkHvw)\nIt wasn't bad, but I wasn't a fan.  It was certainly better than the last version I had, but I think I just prefer not having my veggies and chicken covered in peanut sauce.\n\n-- ROTI & ICE CREAM...$5.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amphawa-san-francisco-2#O6wff5PTAozXVj6i84wpIw)\nThis roti had the prefect texture as well, and the ice cream was terrific!  There could have been a little more condensed milk, but that's always true.\n\nWhileI love Amphawa, I'm regrettably rounding down from FOUR AND A HALF.  Most of what I've had has been better than solid, but it's hard to overlook the few dishes that were just okay.  Not that I won't be coming back, especially since I haven't seen that one worker.  That alone might be enough to bump them to five sooner rather than later.", "author": "Mike L."}

I recall the food being excellent so when I saw that the restaurant was now called Amphawa (not sure when this change happened), I wanted to visit again. Based on my most recent visits, two within a week and a half, I assume the owners must be the same because the food is delicious! So far I've had: \n\n* Por-Pier Sod (under apps): I wanted to try this dish because of the sweet and sour tamarind sauce (I love tamarind). The rolls were tasty and not too heavy but the sauce wasn't as exciting as I hoped.\n\n* Som Tum Poo & Thai (under salads): This is the papaya salad with salted crab. I traveled to Thailand last year and eating papaya salads there has changed my life. I never craved papaya salads before but because of how good they were in Thailand, I ate a papaya salad with every meal. I love that they combine sour, salty, and spicy flavors with so much crunch and Amphawa made one that brought me back to Thailand. We ordered the salad medium spicy and it was perfect. During my second visit to Amphawa, I also had the som tum thai, papaya salad with dried shrimps, and unfortunately, the acidity level wasn't as perfect as when I had the som tum poo. \n\n* Kor Moo Yang (under favs): The grilled marinated pork was so flavorful and tender. It was a bit on the fatty side. \n\n* Kao Na Ped Pa-Lo (under favs): Like the grilled pork, the duck was tender and flavorful. It sat in a wet sauce, served with another thicker savory sauce, and it's five spice flavor came through. \n\n* Guai-Tiew Gai Koor (under stir-fried noodles): I was really surprised by how good this dish was - it's pan-fried flat rice noodles with chicken, egg, squid, bean sprouts, green onions and ground peanuts. I usually like thai noodles with a brighter herbaceous flavor (such as pad kee mao) but the eggy-ness of these noodles was so delicious and comforting. I also liked the addition of squid. \n\n* Pad Kee Mao (under stir-fried noodles): I tried the pad kee mao during my second visit and the noodles were so fresh and all of the flavors were right. Another stellar dish.\n\nAmphawa gets busy, especially during dinner time but service has always been friendly. I'll definitely be frequenting the restaurant and hope to try their noodle soup next time.", "author": "Maya S."}

The shrimp is stretched out like a piece of tempura and wrapped with an egg roll. Cute, simple and delicious with sweet plum sauce. \n\nToong Egern: minced chicken and vegetable wrapped in a pouch served with cucumber salad. Not a big fan of this. The chicken and vegetables are made into this curry filling, seems like there are potatoes in it too. The flavor is bland but presentation was nice. They're wrapped and tied together like a little bag of treats. \n\nMy main dish was the Kao Soy with egg noodles topped with yellow curry chicken, pickled green mustard and red onions. It was listed under noodle soup and it was far from soup! The  noodles are mixed in a rich, thick curry that you really can't drink with a spoon. It was more suacey than soupy.

Good, not great.\n\nYum Pla Muk (Squid Salad) - For me, I had never seen squid cut the way they did, but I was told it's normal for asian restaurants. It looked like the trunk of palm trees, nevertheless this was a really good salad. The dressing paired with the squid and mixed veggies was tasty.\n\nAngel Wings (Chicken Wings) - These are solid/no nonsense friend chicken wings with a sweet glaze. Personally I didn't think they were angelic, but not devilish either (har har har). Great choice for the less adventurous eater.\n\nAs originally stated, these aren't actual entrees, so it's hard to give a thorough assessment. I will be back, til next Thai-mm (time? bad joke, moving on) Amphawa...", "author": "Aaron C."}

Being Thai myself and having been to Thailand three times, I've found that you look at who is cooking the food and who is eating at the restaurant. At Amphawa, the cook was Thai and there were Thai people eating at the restaurant. Authenticity verified.\n\nAnother strong measure is the menu itself. At Amphawa, there are over 100 items on the menu with regional specialities of Thailand like the Northern Thai kao soi (noodles with a yellow curry) and sai ooua (smoked sausage spiced with curry and lemongrass). I was drawn particularly to the hoi tawd (a crispy mussel pancake/fritter) which is hard to find since most Thai restaurants don't make this dish because it's time consuming. It was so good that I ordered two plates of it. Out of our six dishes, yum kor moo yang (grilled pork shoulder salad) was amazing - succulent pork shoulder tossed in an authentic Thai sauce of lime juice, fish sauce, chilies, and palm sugar. \n\nYou might find another place for your favorite pad thai or pad see ewe but Amphawa should be on your list of Thai restaurants to get a real taste of Thailand beyond the norm. This Thai guy gives Amphawa five stars and a must try if you are in the area.", "author": "Pari P."}

If I didn't live so far away, I would definitely be a regular here. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and homey and the staff is always really friendly and accommodating. The food is fresh, has a clean taste and has high quality. I'm a pork lover and I especially love all the pork dishes here and they serve a variety like stewed pork leg, crispy pork belly, minced pork, grilled pork...I can go on and on!\n\nUsually when I go eat Thai, I just stick to my 2 main favorites, pad thai and pad kee mao, because they're standard and most places make them right. But when I come to Amphawa, I'm always excited to try new things because honestly, all of their dishes look good. I'm always on the look out for good crispy pork belly and this place does not disappoint. \n\nSo far, my favorite dishes are the crispy pork belly with Chinese broccoli and pork stew noodle soup. Both always hit the spot. \n\nIf you're looking for a great Thai restaurant with high quality food then Amphawa is the place to be!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

I asked for lime and they gave me plenty to add to the curry noodle soup.

This place does Thai food right. What really makes me dig this spot is the consistency they have with all their dishes. For example: The Khao pad Boo (crab fried rice) I had there 5+ years ago is as delicious now as it was then. I have not been disappointed with any dish I've ever ordered from Amphawa. Truthfully the only reason I don't rock this spot more often is that I live frikin far from it. Something I also appreciate is that they try new things. They introduce new Thai dishes, and by doing so that shows me they're pushing their skills more & more. They don't just sit back & chill. They innovate, create & keep on pushing to make better & better Thai food. If your a fan of Thai food give this place a shot & remember to experiment with different dishes. Don't just go once. Go a few times before you pass judgement. I'd say Amp has at least 20 really strong, notable dishes. This place will have a few that you'll like.", "author": "Gilbey G."}

I've only started exploring this neighborhood this year (part of my new year food resolution), and really could not comment on the comings and goings of the ethnic food scene here, other than there seems to be a lot of restaurants in the neighborhood and parking is not as hard as I once thought to be. He sighed that evening. \"I really miss their soup. Too bad it's gone.\" \n\nFast forward a few weeks later. We were heading to Geary to run some errands. It was close to 3 PM when I was all of sudden snappy. One could tell because I became a raging bxxxx and I snap at the most trivial things.  \"You need food.\" He said. \"No I don't. I am fine.\" I was getting testy. He stopped in front of Amphawa, and said \"We are going in.\" \"No I'm not hungry.\" I insisted but he grabbed my arms and practically dragged me inside.\n\nThe wait staff was very friendly. There was a TV mounted on the wall, the screen was filled with photos of varies dishes served here. Travel channel was on the other TV. I asked for the larb salad and he went for a beef special. At that point, I all of sudden realized that I was starving. Food arrived swiftly and the dishes looked beautiful, clean and flavored just right. I inhaled the food. And wished there was another stomach that I could use to pack additional food. Alas, I was no camel.  \n\nAs I was feeling more like myself again, he all of sudden excitedly announced to me, \"I found my chef. She's the one who used to cook at that Thai restaurant before it was Tea Papa. She cooks here now.

Just a touch sweet, and the meats were incredible. I also opted for the yellow egg noodle, which I highly recommend - a perfect combo!\n94. Guai Jubb Noodle Soup - interesting.

Amazing, mouthwatering food? Check. I've been here numerous times and every dish has been worth ordering again. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Deep fried fish cakes served with cucumber salad and ground peanut ($7.95): arrived piping hot and juicy. I've had my fair share of hockey-puck dry fish cakes and these were definitely not that. It was delicious.\n\n- Crispy fried calamari served with sweet and sour sauce ($8.95): ooooohhh yeah, these were good. The coating on the calamari is different than those used in mainstream chain restaurants. It's lighter in color and taste; it's more of a pale yellow than dark brown color. The calamari to coating ratio was 3:1 instead of 1:1.\n\n- Chicken satay ($7.95): pretty standard but they done it right. Again, I had my fair share of dry chicken satay but they cooked these perfectly. I couldn't get enough of the peanut sauce! I dipped the crispy calamari into the sauce because it's THAT good.\n\nCurries:\n- Boneless duck in red curry with tomatoes, pineapple, and basil ($12.95): who doesn't like duck? It goes well in this curry; I can't imagine duck in a yellow or green curry. Forewarning: it's a bit spicy!\n\n- Pumpkin curry with beef in medium red curry sauce with bell pepper and basil ($11.95): MY FAVORITE DISH. I don't know what it is but the pumpkin curry is magical. It's not too sweet nor spicy - it's just... I don't know, I'm at a lost of words. You just have to try it for yourself.\n\nStir-fried/entrees:\n- Pad Thai ($10.95): Self-explanatory if you already know what pad thai is. My friends think that every pad thai taste the same but na-uh, that's where they're wrong. I think Amphawa has the best pad thai in all of SF.\n\n- Pad Kee-Mao - flat rice noodles with beef, onions, chili, chinese broccoli, and basil ($9.95): a bit on the sweeter side. It can be a bit oily but hey, it's a stir-fried dish. It needs a little bit of oil to combine and coax all of the ingredients into one cohesive dish.\n\n- Fried chicken over rice with sweet and sour sauce ($9.95): another self-explanatory dish. Their coating is lighter but somehow it makes the coating crunchier! I ain't complaining.\n\n- Steamed chicken over garlic rice ($9.95): a healthy option does exist! The chicken is soft and has a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. My favorite part of this dish is the garlic rice though. After everyone was done sampling a piece of the steamed chicken, there was a mount of garlic rice left. I scooped some up and ate it with the curry dishes - tastes just as good.\n\nDesserts:\n- Panna cotta with mango sauce - oh lawd, have mercy!\n- Sweet sticky rice with vanilla ice cream - mango isn't in season so we settled for ice cream. Still, it was a perfect way to end a wonderful meal.", "author": "Annie S."}

The thin vermicelli noodles (mi fun in Chinese cooking), was a bit disappointing because I was expecting traditional thin rice noodles in Thai soups. It was an interesting dish, sweet, VERY sour from the lemongrass, and topped with a variety of meats. I wouldn't get it again but would be open to trying some of their other noodle dishes. \n\nCrispy Pork with Basil over Rice - It's better than Lers Ros crispy pork! Lers Ros is so deep fried and hard you could break a tooth. While it's good, it was on the oily side and I felt there was too much fat and too little meat. Favorite rice plate at Amphawa is still the amazing pork leg stew that is perfectly savory, sweet, and tender.\n\nCalamari with Salted Yolk - The sauce is made with crack. Don't know what's going on here, but it was so delicious, I hope it becomes a part of the regular menu. A bit pricey for lunch ($12.95) but the portion is pretty generous.

In the same way, one Thai restaurant's energies devoted to a creating a stunning pad thai often leaves behind a struggling, bland panang curry, while another Thai restaurant down the block has the opposite focus.\n \nWith that being said, Amphawa is the best-rounded Thai restaurant in the neighborhood, promoting delicious lesser-known creations without forsaking flavorful foundational dishes we have come to expect and love.\n \nThe Kao Ka Moo is a pile of shredded pork leg stew tender beyond comprehension. Each sliver is soaked thoroughly by rich drippings, needs to be accompanied by the tangy and revitalizing sauce, and can be paired with slightly sour greens that are far above ornamental. A transformative bite is instantly created when the juicy meat is set atop a spoonful of Garlic Rice that is fluffy enough to evoke wild wishes to commission beds and sweaters made from it.\n \nThe Gai Ga Prow, on the other hand, is a lurking mountain lion camouflaged in dull, overlooked colors that is ready to pounce upon unsuspecting taste buds with its unrestrained flavor and heat. Every scoop of finely minced chicken is sauce-laden and well-seasoned, carrying unrelenting spiciness that causes desperate glances towards the quickly emptying water glass. Although painful sounding, the spontaneous sweat beads are worth bearing for the rewarding flavor boldness.\n \nThe Gang Panang Nuer is decidedly creamy, smooth, and inhabited by a dense population of tender beef and sweet bell peppers, making it the perfect embodiment of Thai curry.\n \nAttentive service and an enormous bathroom only further enrich Amphawa's experience.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I even had reservations.  \n\nWe ordered the pad thai and the crispy pork belly with chinese broccoli.  The pad thai was good, though I wish it came with more.  The crispy pork belly flavored the vegetables well, but itself is super fried and not really the nice pork belly consistency that you'd expect.

There was no place to sit and wait, so we were waiting in the doorway.  When we were seated, they had pulled apart a 4-person table to make two 2-person tables, but there's not really any extra space to do this, so there was probably about 3 inches of space between our two tables.  Unfortunately, this meant that I had to get out of my seat so that someone from the other table could go to the bathroom, and the waitress had to lean through our table to serve them.  It was kind of uncomfortable, but I guess they seated us that way so wouldn't have to wait longer for another table.  \n\nThe prices were definitely cheap for SF-- which is a huge plus!  I can't remember the exact price, but I do know that we got two non-alcoholic drinks, an appetizer, and three entrees for about $45.  Awesome for the area.  \n\nThe food, however, was kind of reflected in the price.  It wasn't great quality Thai food, especially for what can be found in the city.  There was also one dish with pork that we thought the texture was very strange in and didn't like at all.  The entrees came out before the appetizer, which was frustrating.  It turns out they accidentally served our appetizer to another table.  But the portions were big.\n\nOverall, we probably won't be going there to eat again, but it would be a good place to get take-out from, especially due to the price and location.", "author": "Jess B."}

I've gotten delivery/take-out a few times here and have always been impressed with my order. My favorite dishes that I can recommend off the top of my head:\n\n1) Yum woonsen: silver noodle salad with minced pork, shrimp, black fungus, and a lemon-chili dressing. I order this to be \"healthy\" but it's not really a salad, just a lot of silver noodles with some lettuce leaves. I'm not really sure what to do with the lettuce leaves.. sometimes I clumsily wrap the noodles in it. The dish is very flavorful and not too heavy. Don't make the mistake of ordering it medium spicy like I did one time because it was way too spicy and I could hardly enjoy it. Order it mild unless you have a very good tolerance.\n\n2) Kao pad goon-chiang: one of the best fried rice dishes I've had! The portions are definitely generous so you could split this into 2 meals or more if you order a couple other dishes. The sausage is super juicy and flavorful.\n\nI've had a couple other dishes here that I can't remember, but I've never had anything that I disliked.

I would say that Amphawa did make a valiant effort to transport their curry seamlessly but could still be improved. The red curry was in half of the tray and the other portion was rice separated by a divider and closed with a lid. Then the package was sealed with saran wrap. I think the curry may have went into the packaging when it was too warm because the flavor was slightly reminiscent of the plastic packing but this could also just be my paranoia.

I loved their decor and seatings, the dining area is a little small but it has a very relaxing, comfy and romantic vibe which I LOVE. *Perfect for those casual dinners and even date night (if you're trying to get laid!!)\n\nI couldn't figure out what to order bc everything on the menu sounded amazing. *They have cocktails for only $5!! Oh damn they're winning!!* \nI decided on their Lychee Tini *I LOVE lychee and this cocktail was AWESOMELY addicting and amazing!! With every sip I was craving more and more and did I mention I was buzzing off of one cocktail?? Yea I'm a cheap date, what can I say?? Under the advisement of my yelp buddy, he suggested the Lychee Iced Tea! *Once again I was on my Lychee faze so here I was again having another lychee drink but a non alcoholic one and WOW it was simply amazing!! Sweet lychee taste that leaves your tongue craving for more after the first sip!!\n\nFor our entrees we decided on..\n-  Chicken Larb (mild); A simple yet great dish. Ground chicken combined with red bell peppers, basil and thai chili peppers to make this dish a HOT one. \n- Pumpkin Curry (mild); I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin unless we're having pumpkin pie for Turkey Day but today was different. I've tried pumpkin curry at other Thai spots and enjoyed it all the time so I was hoping this place wouldn't fail me and it surely didn't!! The sweet and spicy taste of their redish yellow curry with bite size pumpkin pieces, bell peppers, basil and tender chicken made this dish to die for. It was heaven on top of my rice :)\n\nIt was simply an amazing dinner from beginning to end. Cocktails, non alcoholic drinks, great atmosphere, sweet and attentive waitresses/waiters and delicious food made this spot my newest addiction when it comes to Thai food :)", "author": "Anonymous P."}

I think most of the dishes are anywhere between $6 to $14. \n2.Food gets to the table fast. I have been here a dozen of times and I can't recall waiting more than 5-6 minutes to get my meal. This is great especially during lunch.\n3. Hours. They are open every day until 11 pm. This can be a life saver!\n4.Food quality. This is the most important one. The food is excellent, and that's not something minor when the most I have spent is $12 or $13 for my main course. I can't think of another restaurant that has great food and they charge the same prices other restaurants charge for mediocre food.\nThere are a few dishes I like a lot. The fried calamari is classic and comes with a sweet sauce that makes the dish unique. Forget the classic aioli and cocktail sauce other restaurants serve with this dish.\nIf you like calamari, the calamari salad is even better. The calamari is not fried or not breaded, and the salad is very good too.\nThere are other salads I have tried and they offer the flavors of real thai cuisine. I like the mango salad a lot, it's spice, if you can't handle spicy you should avoid the dish because once I requested it mild and it is not the same thing. Not even close to the spicy one.\nThe noodle salad is good too. Comes with plenty of assorted mushrooms and it's ideal when I am really hungry, the size portion is quite generous and unlike other salads this is enough for main course. I also like the sweet beef salad, it has a very unique taste and I can't remember finding dishes like that at other places.\nOverall this is one of my favorite places, the quality of the food, the hours and the prices make this restaurant to be my top option when it comes to Thai food.", "author": "Sylvester C."}

Delivery was quick and the food was good. We got the Pad Thai, Tom Yum Goong soup, and Pumpkin Curry.

We decided to try different things this time. We got the Pad Lew Raa?, the Tom Yum Gai soup, and another stir fry pork dish (forgot the name). The Pad Lew was a little on the oily side, the soup was spectacular, and the pork dish was too spicy. Overall, the flavor was there.

When we walked in at 6pm, the staff greeted us warmly and we were promptly seated. \n\nI was with an expert on Thai food so I left it up to her to decide what we'd eat. First was the Som Tum Poo, a salad made from shredded green papaya and salted crab. I should mention that this is very spicy and I consider myself a veteran of hot flavors. In between choking back tears from the heat and trying to calm the fire in my mouth with big gulps of Thai iced tea, I remember noting that the green (unripened) papaya wasn't anything like the intensely sweet, tropical (ripe) papaya when we think of the fruit. The combination of cool crunchy shredded fruit with spices reminded me a little bit of kimchi. Interestingly, when eating this dish in Thailand, the salted crab should not be eaten because of the questionable waters they're caught in.\n\nThe Crying Tiger is a barbecued beef dish accompanied with a cilantro chili sauce and it tastes delicious! Pretty much like any barbecued beef dish should. It had good flavor and char, definitely a must get. Not sure I understand the name... maybe Crying Cow would've been more appropriate?\n\nThe Tom Yum soup was my first time trying it (I know, I've been missing out) and it was pretty good. I ordered it extra spicy like a noob, thinking I could handle it. Did I finish it? Yes. Was it painful? Like delicious heavenly torture. I also got to try some of another soup (sorry, I can't remember the name...update is coming) and it was really good, like pho broth with hints of five spice and hoisin sauce if I had to describe the flavor. It wasn't as sour as the Tom Yum, but it nice mellow taste. Apparently the real stuff is supposed to have pork blood.\n\nI left stuffed. The portions were generous and the noodle dishes were huge, probably shareable. It's been six hours and I'm still full. The service was fantastic.

Apparently the owners are the same, just a chef change.\n\nI tried the Kra Prow Moo Krob, pork belly sauteed with basil which Lers Ros helped popularize. Amphawa's version uses pork belly that is cooked down even further, almost too crispy, and the meat on the small pieces is a bit too dry. However, the flavor is good, cooked into the ingredients, without much sauce. I liked that it came with plenty of onions, carrots, bell peppers, and jalapenos.\n\nI also tried another Thai favorite, Koh Moo Yang, grilled pork \"shoulder\", but really pork neck. Their version is pretty standard, comes with a similar sauce as LR, but with some cabbage to munch on.\n\nMy favorite dish was Tom Luad Moo, pork entrails, blood, and housemade peppery meatballs, in a delicious garlicky broth. It had intestines, spleen, cubes of pork blood which all flavored the broth a bit more, along with lettuce, cilantro and a bit of scallion. \n\nThey have a few other innard based soups that I'm curious about, as well as Kao Soi, which another yelper said was really good. \n\n4 stars for now, but they definitely have potential.", "author": "Derrick V."}

Yay, was I happy that I did, since that day, Amphawa has been my new Thai-Delivery-Spot.\n\nThe one good thing about a delivery-minimum fee is that you are obligated to order quite a lot of food, which gives you the opportunity to try different kind of dishes. \n\nThe fried rice (I've had both the regular one and the pineapple fried rice) is very tasty.\nThe Roti with Curry is a good snack/appetizer. Pumpkin Curry (my go-to Thai dish) is very tasty. Can't ever go wrong with Pad-See Ew. And the Tofu Prig King (Green Beans with Chili paste & basil) is nice and crunchy.\n\nIt may be slightly more expensive, but the portions are huge.\n\nIf you like spicy (Thai) food this is definitely a good place.

My friend finished their dish and mine wasn't out yet so we asked to get it taken off of the bill. They were super apologetic, took it off the bill and then insisted I take it home with me.

Amphawa is one of the few exceptions. They have dishes here you won't find elsewhere. The Khao Ka Mu (a kind of stewed pork leg) is about as authentic as you will get outside of Thailand. Likewise the Sai Ooua (Chiang Mai sausage) is hard to find in Bangkok, let alone San Fran, is solid, though not what you would get in Chiang Mai. The food here is authentic, the people are nice and the prices are low, what more do you want? Strongly recommend.", "author": "Eric R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-19", "description": "First, I must say that I am disappointed with Thai, Korean and Vietnamese food in San Francisco, compared to Southern California.  I have been to Thailand a few times.\n\nMy wife likes Thai food and we noticed the new restaurant, so wanted to give it a try.  We were driving by and there was parking right in front!  If I read the recent Yelp reviews first, I might not have given it a try.  \n\nThey have photos of the dishes in front on the entrance, but not inside, so we didn't know what to order.  The waitress, probably owner, went out with my wife to help select the dishes. Her accent was very thick, so we thought we ordered frog legs, but it came out pork bacon.  My mom, wife and 2 kids we with me.\n\nSteam/Baked Pork Bacon\nThis dish was 10 times better than the pork bacon dishes you get at Cantonese restaurant!  After you scrap off the fat, the skin and meat are \"fall off the bone\" tender.\n\nChicken and Squid Pad Thai\nI always order this, at Thai restaurants, as it is the only thing I know on the menus.  None before this has been memorable.  The noodles were well cooked (I dislike Al Dente pasta) and had a buttery, melt in your mouth taste, but there was no oil residue at the bottom of the bowl.  The chicken was not overcooked and my daughter ate all the squid.  I think there were prawns, but my wife must of scooped those up fast, if there were.\n\nStir Fry Mix Vegetables\nA little spicy, too spicy for my mom and kids.  I liked it though.\n\nSoyu Pad Thai\nExpecting the Pad Thai to be too much for our kids, we ordered is dish, which is not on the menu.  My wife and the owner lady went back and forth to discuss what should go into this dish, as it was not on the menu.\n\nSteam Broccolli\nAfter finding that the Mixed Veggies were too spicy, we ordered is dish, which is not on the menu.  For some reason they wouldn't saute the broccoli in garlic and salt because we wanted only a little amount for the kids, but owner lady was very gracious about it.\n\nFried Chicken in Sweet and Sour Sauce.\nI liked the crispiness of the batter, the chicken was a little over cooked and the sauce was bland.  It might be because of all the other tasty dishes masked the taste of the sauce.\n\n$50 for the above, no drinks.  While not cheap, we finished most of the food.\n\nThe service was great.  There was only another table occupied at the time, 5 pm.  Sometimes you go to Chinese restaurants that are empty and the service still sucks.  Not so here.  We had the waitress and the owner waitress attending to us throughout.  When we were talking among ourselves, they appeared concerned that we were talking to them, as they awaited instructions.", "author": "Anthony T."}

Their roti is devine, their pad kee mao delicious, and the mango salad was a pleasant surprise. It was not too sweet, and refreshingly tangy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-10-24", "description": "This restaurant calls itself a noodle house.  In my experience, when a restaurant calls itself a noodle house, its noodle dishes are supposed to be good, or if not good, at least decent.  Out of our party of five that ate here, four of us ordered a noodle dish (three noodle soups and one stir-fried noodles).  The noodle soups were downright gross.  I had the tom-yum noodle soup.  The moment my dish came, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  First of all, the color of the tom-yum soup was completely off.  It was more of a yellow-ish color than the usual orange-reddish color.  The soup tasted very bland with a hint of sour and some weird flavor that kinda made me want to throw up.  The quality of ingredients they used was cheap.  I had pork balls in my dish, and they were mushy, not firm with a nice bounce with each chew.  And it wasn't just my dish that was bad.  I tried the soup from the hot and sour noodle soup dish, and that also tasted bland (not hot or sour).  \n\nGranted, not everything was terrible.  The stir-fried noodles were okay.  Nothing special.  It was edible.  We also had the rice plate with stir-fried ground pork and basil and chili.  That was the best dish, surprisingly.  \n\nLastly, a WARNING:  This restaurant tacks on an automatic 20% GRATUITY to your bill for a party of FIVE or more (can you say underhanded and rip-off?).  First of all, this is your average-joe neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Second of all, we're talking about a TWENTY percent tip for FIVE people when most higher end restaurants add 18% to your check for a party of 6-8 or more.  \n\nDon't come here; the food is bad and they overcharge you.", "author": "K H."}

If the wait is going to be doubled they really need to call and warn the customer.    \n1.5 hours for cold Thai food when I am only 14 blocks away is pretty bad.  \n\nThis would be an ideal opportunity for the business to respond to me personally.  \n\nOtherwise I think there food is pretty good.  The best in the Outer Richmond (park Presidio being the cut-off in this case).      Pineapple fried rice is weirdly bland as they don't use any curry powder like other places do.  They have many similar items to Lers Ros.", "author": "howard t."}

Man, definitely the food is much better in here than New York, overall. Found this gem by accident, everything that we ordered were flavorful. Although I would say, the salmon curry was too watery. They should thicken little bit and less water. It looked like the ingredients swimming in the curry. Taste wise still very good. The mango salad is so yummy, not too salty like other places nor too sour. The garlic shrimp w rice also very good, wished bigger portion, lol. I will return soon. Waitress is friendly. TIPS: I don't like the pineapple fried rice!!!", "author": "Clemencia S."}

I opened the top to my panang and it's like I was in Thailand momentarily. The spices were perfect & the ingredients fresh!  Shockingly, it's the best Thai place I've had in the Richmond District. King of Thai Noodle is like the McDonald's of Thai in comparison.  Only rec- add more chicken.", "author": "meesh m."}

For dessert, we had the fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  The fried bananas were perfect.  The batter was light and crispy.  The banana was ripe and very sweet.  The servers are extremely friendly and attentive.", "author": "Sherry C."}

I'm so glad i gave it a try.", "author": "yayoi s."}

Very spicy pumpkin curry. It was almost too spicy to eat because my mouth was on fire.  Great pad thai. The noodles were perfect and fresh.  I also tried the mint lemonade and it needed more mint and less ice.  Refreshing, but I probably wouldn't get it again.  If I would go back here again, I would probably not eat there.  The place is tiny and the flies are very bothersome.  The staff are attentive and nice though.", "author": "k h."}

If you have ever been to Thailand, you may have tried their famous iced coffee. The one that they have here at Amphawa tastes almost the same! It is amazing. I definitely recommend to whoever that decides to go here, GET THE THAI ICED COFFEE! The costumer service is honestly great. They are Thai and extremely nice. One time, my friend left her phone in there and the waitress ran after her to get it! This restaurant is very classy - it's not like a cheap look like King Of Thai. Amphawa gives you a great atmosphere with cheap prices for food. I have to say, you MUST try their angel wings! So delicious. I love this place.", "author": "Amy C."}

They were super friendly and everything was a bit chaotic as could be expected.   They had the first night jitters but the food was fresh and delicious.  We are definitely going back and delighted to have a new addition to the neighborhood.  I think they can only improve as they work through the learning curve of any start up restaurant.  They had some interesting dishes on the menu that I have not seen at other Thai restaurants and eagerly anticipate some culinary exploration.", "author": "L C."}

An appetizer of \"Keaw Tod\" $6.50 - marinated pork stuffed fried wonton. I didn't taste or notice any shrimp even though the menu stated it was included, however was still good. Ordered the beef Pad Se-Ew for $7.95  it was decent but was greasy. Presentation was excellent with great portions for the price. Total around $20 plus tip, great deal for a cocktail, appetizer, and entree.", "author": "Trev D."}

The space has been updated and is now more modern.  The menu has also been updated and has dishes you don't find at every other Thai restaurant in town.  I have visted the restaurant several times and have enjoyed every meal.  The service is quick and friendly and the food is delicious. I enjoy trying dishes that I have not seen at other places and every time have been happy with my choice at Amphawa.  I am sure to be a regular customer there.", "author": "David P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-18", "description": "I've been looking for somewhat great taste and authentic thai restaurant for 6 months since I've just moved to San Francisco. So far, Amphawa is the best one. The closest taste compare to the food I had in Thailand. They offer many dishes that Hardly find in other Thai restaurant, such as Koa Ka moo (Pork Stews over rice), Koa soi ( Noodle and Chicken in curry soup), Kung ob Woon sen (Marinated shrimps and glass noodle in a hot pot). That's all I have so far. The location is easy to find. The parking might be a little problem but not too bad. The restaurant itself is really small but cozy. Seems like a homemade style restaurant. Overall, I would like to recommend people who want to try some real authentic thai food, give it a shot. I'll have some other friends try this restaurant again soon and see if my comment is justified.", "author": "Ns G."}
