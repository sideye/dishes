I agree with another reviewer here who says it's not a snobby wine bar--many of them in SF are, so it was really nice to hang out in a down-to-earth atmosphere. We were there between 5:30-7:30 on a Friday night and it was quiet enough to have nice conversation without being deathly silent. The place was nicely decorated, very homey. They had a decent selection of wines and we were given good advice on what to pick. I also had the mixed green salad and hummus/avocado bruschetta and was very satisfied with both. \n\nI will definitely be coming back!", "author": "Melissa M."}

They have the perfect table for a large group of 10-12 people. It was easy to make a reservation too.\n\nThe food was delicious. Had the cauliflower, brussel sprouts, avocado and hummus bruschetta, and hummus and pita bread. All of them were amazing. The veggies were perfectly seasoned. The bruschetta came with 4 pieces that could be cut in half for extra sharing. The pita bread that came with the hummus was soft and fresh.\n\nI docked a star for the service. Our server/bartender this particular evening started off by telling me that it would be better if each person came up to the bar to order individually since we were going to go separate tabs. Okay, I said, no problem at all. Then he proceeded to tell me that because he has to walk ALL the way around the bar it would really help him out and save him some time and energy. Plus, he said, if it gets really busy he just won't have time to take our order. Okay dude, it's all good... Don't stress when your shift has just started. (There literally were 2 other people at the bar who already had their drinks.) I told him I'll let my group know. Even after I informed them he made a point to tell them again.\n\nI asked him for some lemon for the water. He came back to tell me they don't have wedges, just juice. \"So, uh, you'll be okay going without right?\" he asked. Then he walked away.\n\nWhen I went to pay the bill, he told me some more about how much walking he has to do for his job. This place isn't that big. I totally understand that he's operating as both bartender and server and that it could get hairy if it were really busy. (Btw, the same 2 people were at the bar and just 2 other women at another table the entire time.) All the other tables were empty. I had no problem going up to the bar to order, but please save me the sob story about how busy and stressful your job is. A cheerful smile and friendly service goes much farther.", "author": "Susan G."}

The prices here are restaurant-level, but at least you have the opportunity to try things by the glass here before committing to a full bottle on site or seeking it out on your own.\n\nIn addition to the libations, they also have a modest food selection.

The interior was pretty dark. There was only one staff on duty who's helpful introducing us to the menu. Because of the whole ambient and I guess also because it's a wine bar, it's not very noisy making it a pretty suitable place for a date night.\n\n* * * FOOD * * *\nBrussels Sprouts and Corns: A-\nI like that it wasn't too oily or salty. I could still taste the freshness of the Brussels Sprouts. The portion was perfect for two people.\n\nMargherita Flatbread: B+\nNothing surprising but it tasted pretty good. I ate something before dinner already, the flatbread was perfect as the crust was very thin and cheese smelled really nice.\n\nSince it's a wine bar, I will also give some brief notes about the wine there. They do half glass here, so my friend and I each ordered two half glasses of white + two half glasses of red. For all the four whites they tasted pretty good, with interesting + a bit complex flavor and good finish. But we were both pretty disappointed on the reds... imagine all four fell short to our expectation, we think the chances for that would be low but indeed that was true. Perhaps they change menu once in a while and we were just unlucky to get some mediocre red selection, but I would definitely suggest to go for the whites and skip the reds.\n\nOverall I like this place especially its ambience, I live close by so I will perhaps come back often!", "author": "Simon C."}

Internos is becoming my go to place because it is on my way home, parking is ample as well as being on the 38 muni, and amazingly, they always seem to have space or make space.  (the last two are so rare these days!)\n\nAbout Internos, its lighting is wonderfully flattering and the bar is beautiful marble (if memory serves).  I generally prefer to have a chair back so I find the bar here more comfortable than the tables (which have cute wooden chairs - no back).   \n\nThe wine list is interesting wines here and the prices are reasonable.   I'd like to speak with the buyer to get his/her methodology because its not a common list but its bound to please just about any wine lover.   The bar bites are fine - I'm not sure if they have a full kitchen but the menu is limited to bites (bruschetta, flat breads, ...).  We have had the meat plate and the bruschettas look good.   Just don't go in thinking there is a full dinner menu available.   \n\nI have never had bad service here.   Frankly, I really appreciate the effort.

You can social with some friends comfortably with some small bites and a glass in hand. The place is very dimly lit with some interesting light fixtures, and filled with some modern decor. Lots of black and white photo canvas on the wall, it seems like they are really into art. The whole place is painted in dark color so it gives off the intimate and relaxing atmosphere. I like how it's not crowded at all, so you can have a nice conversation without screaming over the music.\n\nThe server was also very friendly, and made some good suggestions when asked about what to drink. They only serve wine and beer so don't come here if you're planning to pound some shots, this is not that kind of place.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

(Okay, I'm 22, so my repertoire isn't that huge, but anyways...)\n\nCopain Les Voisins Pinot Noir. Oh my word. At $7.50 for a half glass, and $15 for a full glass, it was the pricier pick from the pinot list. However, the gal waiting on us recommended it when my group was deciding on what to get for round #2.\n\nIt was absolutely divine. I only had a half glass and wish I'd splurged on a full one. I thought about that wine for at least two days afterwards, and made plans the following week to come back and order it again. Unfortunately, they sold out of it really fast. You can't really find it anywhere except directly from the winemaker.\n\nI do have to say that if you're a college student and don't have an appreciation for wine, you may find the menu to be a tad pricey. Glasses are $9-12 on average, I'd say. However, they have a really eclectic selection with wines from all around the world. I saw lots of picks from Spain, Italy, Argentina and Chile. \n\nTheir menu is nice as well. On our second visit, we ordered the charcuterie plate, which came with a really nice salad on the side. For $13, it was well worth it. \n\nI've since moved across the bay, but I will definitely be back!", "author": "Ellen M."}

Mom & Pop this place is not, but you were part of the charm I love(d) about Internos...can we get a night or am I missing it?\nI love Internos!  It seems every time I go it's because I've just started, ended or am about to begin a new job.  LMAO!  So, it's been about every year since 2009 and the same year they opened, which is the funny and not so funny part.  Truthfully, I've been many times to catch up with friends, celebrate other occasions and last night I was there on a date.  Internos is perfect for a date with several comfortable four tops...easily made into a two top...leaving plenty of room for wine, beer and these amazing flatbread(s), olives, pistachio nuts and other items like bruschetta (4+ kinds if I recall) and a take on a classic Caprese salad that's just delicious.  \nI love the fact this place has made it in San Francisco! It was no easy task for Adnan, his wife Quinn and their chocolate lab puppy,  Moose (? - can't be sure), who would sleep behind the bar.  I heard many stories and watched; they were clearly ready to open, but didn't and then when they did I watched them grow and grow and grow.  What an honor.  Adnan ran around offering spills of an exciting new red he'd brought in from some near or distant place.  Quinn tended bar, which made it fun to sit and enjoy watching as they worked together to make it happen...their trusted pup sleeping nearby.  \nI hate it things cannot stay the same and this is a totally selfish review only because I'm about to be in a similar boat.  Do you dedicate every night of your life to a restaurant?  Or do you find the right employees to dedicate their lives? Or do you partner with several, extremely talented people who can share and separate responsibility, offer excellent hospitality and go above and beyond...offering spills of new wines and sending out complimentary olives and nuts (which are priced on the menu)?  I know it's a question every restauranteur asks during their infancy and well into the teenage years I'm sure.  What's the answer?\nPlease, I miss you guys and what your presence brought to Internos.  The place just isn't the same and i actually had to read the wine list last night instead of asking Adnan a bunch of questions, checking out the food and saying \"okay, whatever you'd like Adnan.\"  That was service and hospitality and I loved it.  \nThe last time, which I did not review, the bar and service staff clearly needed supervision and training.  This seems to be taken care of as of last night, but there were still multiple times I had to ask a busser/runner for our server or get up and get her myself.  It's not as bad as Plough & Stars, but not a fair compare!  The service wasn't bad...it just wasn't great.  When we did get the attention it was prompt and thorough.  So, if nothing else this is just a \"we can do better, right!\" email.  I accepted the wine recommended. My date had a couple of Belgian beers, in a matching Belgian label beer glass that was cold with one beer poured at the bar and one poured at the table.  Would y'all tell the nice young lady it's 'cold glass on the table, cold beer poured into it (to show off that it is a cold glass and the beer matches the labeled glass) then a NEW cold glass, the 2nd beer bottle with the same service method?!  To a lot of people it doesn't matter, but it really does.  Someone will say...oh, c'mon...nobody notices that shit.  But, we do...especially the people in Laurel Heights, Presidio Heights and the Inner Richmond. If the service isn't spot on I hate to think what will happen to business because the food can be mediocre, the wine list can continue to grow, but if the service is sub-par guests will not return.  It's not okay to not say anything, so I'm just sayin'...the server needs a little training or a reminder course real quick to hone those skills that separate a fine establishment from a plain establishment.\nThe food was great...flavorful, exactly as described in the menu, presented well and it wasn't over-developed.  The food service, mainly supported by a back waiter and/or busser (I think) or maybe it was the a busser and food runner, I don't know..I wasn't paying attention.  Ha! He was great and was present when we needed something else, if we were ready for our plates to be cleared and he cleared glasses without asking anything.  He saw we had full glasses of water, beer and wine on the table so he took the empties without a word.  That's intuitive thinking and that's quality.  I have to give the credit to the Hispanic gentleman in the dark shirt.  He really was present (like when Adnan and Quinn were present) is all parts of the package last night.  Nice job, kid.\nI'm not gonna harp.  I've said enough.  I hope you guys are having babies, living on a beach somewhere or in that second, beautiful Laurel Heights apartment you told me about. I hope the business is doing well.  We'll be back.  I hope you will.  We got spoiled.  I like spoiled.  Cheers!!", "author": "Sean M."}

I had an Outer Richmond evening recently which included dinner at Morph, ice cream at Joe's, and finished with a drink at Internos Wine Cafe. It was the perfect end to an evening with friends. Internos is understatedly sophisticated and cozy. We chose to sit at the bar, which had comfortable seats (with backs!) over sharing the rustic long table in the center of the bar with another group. (We also glanced enviously over at the group sitting in a comfortable looking leather couch in the window). \n\nI'm no wine connoisseur--I can safely differentiate between red and white, but that's about it--but, for what it's worth, I was impressed by the selection. Since my drinking tastes (and tolerance) are pretty much that of a sixteen year old girl, I was pleased with the dessert wine list. I had a lovely sweet rose and then a complimentary glass of really excellent sherry given to me by the owner. Love that guy--extra star! My more wine knowledgeable friends also enjoyed their wine. \n\nOverall, a great  neighborhood wine bar. The dog napping behind the bar adds to the cozy, neighborhood feel.", "author": "Susan S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-28", "description": "Relaxed, low-lit, friendly, and maybe even a bit sexy, Internos made for a great Friday night for a friend and myself.  \n\nSurprisingly uncrowded and inviting, the noise level wasn't too high and that made it perfect for my friend and I to chat while we imbibed.  A gentleman who introduced himself as Adnan greeted us as we sat down on the couch and helped us pick our glasses of wine by offering very helpful answers to our questions about various selections.  He also brought us complimentary pistachios and olives to munch on with our drinks...very thoughtful and cool, although I'm allergic to pistachios and can't stand olives!!  Luckily, my friend is a fan of both :)\n\nI noted that the per-glass prices of wines were very reasonable by current San Francisco wine-bar standards.  \n\nAnd one detail sets Internos apart from other such bars I've been to as VERY cool:  they offer half-glasses of wines for exactly half the price of a full glass!  That's fantastic for those of us who want to try multiple wines without getting too drunk to drive home, or who want a little bit more after we finish a glass, but don't think we could handle another full pour.  Every wine bar should have this option!!!\n\nWhile we didn't order any food, they DO offer it, and I noticed from another table nearby that the portions are quite healthy.  That's nice, because so often I go to wine bars and they offer a rather measely portion for a lot of money.  For me, I don't want to drink on an empty stomach, and I think it's ridiculous to pay $15 for a tiny sliver of cheese with two crackers.  That doesn't seem to be the problem at Internos, another big points winner in my book!\n\nNo one bothered us or badgered us to order more than what we wanted, and no one pressured us with a bill until we were ready to pay and take our leave.  Very classy.  Good service is hard to find sometimes in San Francisco, but Internos definitely provides it!!\n\nI will definitely go back here and bring more friends.

So, we emailed the owners and let them know we'd be by. We got a very immediate, professional response.\n\nWe were pretty much treated like gold from the  minute we walked in.

They rotate their list every two weeks so you can be sure there is always something new to try. The menu is incredible for a wine cafe; we ordered the hummus/avocado bruschetta, salami mozzerella pannini and caprese salad.

After a little more than half an hour, I decided to head to the bar to order a drink, since I had not realized complimentary wine had already been provided by the hosts of this event. My friend's boyfriend ordered a drink at the same time I did without incident. \n\nWhen I got to the bar to order, I told the male bartender, \"I'd like to order a Riesling.\" \n\nTo which he did not reply, \"Coming right up.\" \n\nInstead he asked, \"Are you part of this group?\" \n\n\"Isn't everyone here 'part of this group',\" I asked.\n\nBartender shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I don't know.\" \n\n\"Isn't this a private party,\" I asked, \"aren't you closed to the public?\" \n\nAgain he shrugged his shoulders and told me he didn't know whether or not it was a private gathering. Never mind the fact that he had obviously been scheduled that evening specifically to serve at this event, and had been bringing out food for the last half an hour that I'd been there. \n\nSo let's get this straight.

My friend and her boyfriend found it to be an odd line of  questioning, and so did the one other friend I told. \n\nIt's a rare occasion that I resort to calling someone a name, like ignoramus, but I felt a little bit small in that moment because of his ignorance.

The frequency by which I consume alcohol is roughly one glass per 2-3 months, and only on special occasions. That said, it was joining a group of friends to celebrate a birthday that brought me to Internos.\n\nIt's a quaint neighbourhood shop nicely appointed by rich, dark colours and weighty woods that evoke thoughts of chocolate and warmth; especially inviting this time of year, but the wall-mounted plasma showing off a football game felt strangely out of place.\n\nA rainy Sunday evening along with a party reservation meant the place was never uncomfortably crowded, though the acoustics left something to be desired. With a total of only 5 people (including us) as we waited for the remainder of our group to arrive, the pals chatting it up with the bartender already had the place in such a roar that I could swear it was like listening to a raucous sports stadium through the business end of a hair dryer.\n\nThankfully, the gal working was cordial and helpful in both inviting us and newcomers to our group and helping choose a starter from the menu. Not a long menu, but as a non-drinker, having a wide selection was of little concern, though everyone else seemed more than satisfied. The food menu was also a bit short and even simple appetisers took a surprising amount of time to hit the table despite a low population to serve, but the bruschetta and meat & cheese plate were quite good. Prices seemed a little on the high side across the board, but as a place clearly intending to lean on the fancy side, it didn't seem out of line.\n\nWhile the initial greeting was nice, the service and attention to our party fell off dramatically soon after. If anyone wanted a refill or to order food, they'd have to excuse themselves from the table and go to the bar. I was disappointed to hear that they wouldn't offer individual tabs because people were coming and going throughout the evening, making it difficult and even a little unfair to those stuck with the bill at the end of the night. I also found it odd that one of the employees spent considerable effort trying to convince our party's host who she was and why she was there. Even after being corrected a few times, his incredulity refused to concede that in fact she had a grasp on her identity and our party's purpose. I nearly dared him to question my name.\n\nBottom line: a cute little wine spot in Inner Richmond that isn't overly pretentious, but carries some of the service snobbery. It suffices at serving a short but quality menu, but is not for those hoping to carry on conversations, unless you're good at one of these things: sign language/charades, lip reading, txt message, or ancient long-distance throat yodelling.", "author": "Aaron H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-30", "description": "This is a review for hosting an event at Internos Wine Cafe. I don't recall the last time I experienced such negligence and arrogance from one business. I usually never post bad reviews, but I had a horrifying experience at Internos.\n\nBasically, I reserved a table to host an event at the bar for 30 guests and, like many events, the event did not get nearly the turnout that I expected (as an event planner, I know the drill). As a result, one of the owners, Quinn, pulled me aside for a scolding, including the accusation that I was \"squatting in her business\" and that \"I should be lucky\" Internos didn't charge me for the booking. Regardless of attendance, nothing I did justifies that level of rudeness and disrespect from a business owner.\n\nWhole story: Last week, I called Internos to ask if it's possible to reserve a table to host a launch event to showcase my jewelry line. The employee I spoke with assured me that it was fine and booked me for a Friday evening. About a week after the reservation was confirmed and I'd begun planning the event, the employee calls back to say that she hadn't checked with her managers before making the reservation and they were \"not comfortable\" with hosting a vendor at their venue. That's understandable, but a) why was there no communication with the managers before confirming the reservation, and b) why did she call me back only a few days before the reservation to say they wanted me to cancel? To rectify the situation, the employee explained that the owners wanted me  to cancel the event or buyout the venue for the night if I wanted to host my party. I explained that I already had the event in the works, press had gone out about it, and I had 30 people on my guest list. Therefore, it wasn't fair to ask me to cancel or pay to solve the problem of the venue's internal miscommunication. As a result, they agreed that I could host the event (without having to do a buyout) with the agreement that I'd have 30 guests. Note that we did not agree on a bar minimum for my party.\n\nA few days later on a Friday evening, the event arrived...but the turnout was terrible. Although I got press in a huge local publication (7x7 Magazine), I invited tons of guests and over 30 of them were confirmed, only 5 people showed up. Even worse, no one ordered any drinks or food (except me). Yikes.\n\nTowards the end of the evening, Quinn approached my small group with menus. In an aggressive and annoyed tone, she asked if anyone wanted to buy drinks or food, while glaring at me. Understanding her frustration as the business owner, I strongly encouraged my guests to buy, as well. When none of them expressed interest, Quinn tossed the menus on the table and stormed away.\n\nNot long after that incident, Quinn asked to speak with me in private when I had a moment. Once I explained some questions about my jewelry line to my guests, I walked over to where Quinn was standing by the bar. Then her nasty rant ensued.\n\nAs of result of low turnout and low orders from the bar (something I had very little control over), Quinn called me \"disrespectful\", \"unprofessional\", and a \"squatter\" in her business. Amongst other rude comments, I remember she said that I'm \"lucky\" she didn't charge me a couple hundred dollars to cover the expense. She also complained that she was \"unhappy\" and \"very disappointed\" because she asked my guests to buy food/drink, but they looked at her like she \"had six heads\" (maybe because everything at Internos is overpriced?). She concluded her tongue lashing by asking me to pack up and leave within 15 minutes. Seriously??\n\nI understand her huge disappointment with low orders because the bar needs to make money. However, considering I had no prior agreement with the establishment for a bar minimum, her comments were completely inappropriate, rude, and offensive. I'm very surprised she called ME unprofessional...we probably wouldn't have had the conflict if Quinn had trained her employees properly in the first place, or at least taken more accountability for the lack thereof.\n\nNever in my life have I felt so unwelcomed and belittled by a business. What a regretful experience at Internos courtesy of the poor management. If customer service is important to you, I would look elsewhere for hosting your next event.", "author": "Courtney P."}

That's what these reviews are supposed to be about, right?  \"Real People, Real Reviews.\" not \"Real Previews.\"\n\nAnyway, Internos was a perfect place to kill an hour on a rainy Monday evening.  The interior is clean and well designed, if a little sparse.  The art on the walls gives me a headache, but other than that, the place looks great, with dark wood, candles, interesting light fixtures and a dark marble bar.\n\nThe bartender was jovial and kept bringing us little nibbles and unsolicited top-offs.  It's worth checking out the place now while they are eager to woo you. I really appreciated the way he almost insisted that I try everything I ordered before pouring me a full glass, including the house brew, which is a light, hoppy beer that they have brewed specially for the shop.  It's a nice touch.\n\nThey said that the TV is on it's way, which worries me, since I'm not a television in the bar kind of guy, but if they keep the sound off or play old movies, I wouldn't object. \n\nInternos is a fantastic new spot and despite the location, it's worth the trek.", "author": "Quinn S."}

The chairs (stools) at the tables are pretty uncomfortable, but the stools at the bar are more comfortable. We appreciated the little snacks (nuts and olives), but we had 4 glasses of wine between the 2 of us and only one was even borderline remarkable -- the other 3 were only so-so. For $50 I was a little disappointed. \n\nFrankly, I also think that starting $10+ a glass at a wine bar (especially, let's face it, in The Richmond) is a little steep. The entry-level prices for a glass of vino at other SF wine bars (like California Wine Merchant in the Marina, Arlequin in Hayes Valley, and Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant) are much cheaper and I've always enjoyed what I've been served in each of these places.\n\nThe other reviews for Internos have convinced me that I need to revisit, and I hope to have tastier wines the second time around.", "author": "J C."}

Now we have options besides heading to the Irish bars or RoHan's.\n\nWent there this past weekend with my husband to have pre-dinner drinks.  Love the ambiance and decor, although it was a very crowded night with two large boisterous crowds in there and it was so hard to hear my husband talk when he was just sitting next to me at the bar.  It seems like they need to install some sound abosrbing panels because with a large crowd in there...it was deafening.\n\nWine list was okay. I was thinking since it was a wine bar, they would have more exciting wines on their list to try, such as more from South America or other regions besides California.  They only had two types of sparkling wines on their \"by the glass\" list and only two additional by bottles.  I also would expect a wine bar to have tasting flights, but instead they only had two prices on their wine menu which was \"Glass or Bottle\" price.  Also our wine person at the counter, was paying more attention to his group of friends who came in then to us or other people at the wine bar.  Not a good impression.\n\nPrice was a bit high for a glass of Cuvaison Pinot Noir we were charged $18.00.  I know a bottle is approximately $30.00 retail at BevMo, so I understand they need to make their profit, but perhaps if it was a different type of Pinot Noir from a wine maker you cannot find at Bev Mo I would have gladly paid $18.00.\n\nThe wine person (not the owner) did mention that they were going to be revamping their wine offerings as well as extending their menu more.

I watched him go back to the order screen, print out an order ticket, and bring it back to the kitchen, so it was obvious he had never turned the order in in the first place.

Adnan and Quinn were very helpful in the planning - including how much food to order, what works well, etc. and they let me bring in my own bday pies -no cutting fee either. :) \nAll of my friends liked how easy it was to find and how easy to find parking - bonus for friends from the North and South Bay as anywhere downtown is a nightmare but this bar is so close to 19th ave - it's very accessible. The wine and beer selections were a hit too! A definite place to look at for when you're planning your next get together, party, etc.", "author": "n s."}

I am a regular patron of Internos and was in the bar myself and witnessed what happened, not to mention, I too am gay and don't recall EVER hearing the word faggot at Internos. \n\nTwo men walked into the bar, did not order a drink, they sat by the window and then proceeded to think it was their own bedroom. A makeout session promptly ensued and one gentleman started to reach down the other's pants. That's when the owner POLITELY asked the men to leave. If you weren't there, don't dramatize the situation or make statements that aren't true. It is shameless for you people to go on an write yelp reviews when none of you have even set foot in this wine bar. \n\nIf you had actually gone up to the bar and ordered a drink and not tried to get down your friends pants, you would have realized this is a more than welcoming establishment who has hosted many Tuesday evenings for the gay crowd.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

So many wine bars can come across as pretentious or intimidating, but this one had a very comfortable vibe to it. Only criticism is that I wish they had a little more seating, but the place is very small. I came here for a private birthday party and all the seats were filled rather quickly. I love animals but I don't really dig people bringing them into nice establishments. But if you're down for that they are too. But other than that they have decent wine prices/specials and I enjoyed the light fare they offered. The fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and basil bruschetta was particularly delicious.

I am not a regular at any bar, but always think of heading over here for the wine, even though I live in the Castro. I am more comfortable here and have made more conversations with people at the bar, than any other place I can think of. I just don't agree. The entire crowd was friendly and chatty, so I just have a real problem with anyone saying anything about this place being homophobic in any way.\nThe wines here are superb, the owner knows his stuff, and the friend I brought with me a couple times, keeps asking me why it is so inexpensive?

This is a situation to be dealt with by any witnessing patrons, the parties involved, and management. To come to Yelp of all places, post 1 star, and then convey your thoughts as though you were there and have all of the facts is truly reckless. Treating Yelp, or in a greater sense the Internet in general as your personal microphone and doing so by posting fact-less 3rd, 4th, and 5th hand accounts is awful.

Matthew S. must've been one of the two other customers at the bar when I came in; the place was really dead.  I hope it doesn't stay that way.  Fair, it was Monday, and folks are broke and it was raining, but what a great, easily accessible spot to grab a great glass of wine.  I really like the space, and was much happier once they closed the door and I could get a little cozy.  The gentleman behind the bar was very nice; he let us try our wine selections before committing to a full glass and served us olives and almonds, though I'd guess there may typically be a charge for them.  Wines by the glass are on the more expensive end ($10 - $17), but we liked both wines that we had (a cab and a cote du rhone).  The appetizer list was hefty - featuring snacks, cheese plates, charcuterie, salads and bruschetta.  Everything you could want to snack on with wine basically.  Well, except chocolate maybe.\nSecretly nestled into a nondescript spot on a nondescript block, you might miss it if you weren't looking for it.  I highly recommend you look for it.

While I enjoyed the ambiance and the company, the most important part of the wine bar - the wine - was not so great. I don't have the most developed palate in the world but I didn't love either of the two glasses I had. The wines by the glass was a pretty short list, with multiple selections (at least 6) covered by little red stickers due to unavailability. Wine unavailable at a wine bar struck me as kind of odd. Either they need to reprint the menu or restock because that just seemed tacky. Also they had a selection of specialty beers as listed on a chalkboard under a T.V playing sports (still wondering about the sports at a wine bar thing). The beer seemed like somewhat of an afterthought and possibly a result of their skimpy by the glass selection? While the pours were quite generous I think they need to step it up in the by the glass offerings.", "author": "Vanessa M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-13", "description": "Great wine bar with friendly unassuming staff. International wine selections and some reasonably priced values. If you are in the mood to splurge there are some beauties in the 13 dollar range. Nothing over 20 dollars. And there are always a couple glasses in the 8 dollar range. I have never considered it a pricey place to go for what you get. I consider my habit of drinking wine in restaurants a pricey one, but most wine worth drinking is expensive. Great happy hour from 4 to 8 with 2 dollars off all wine by the glass and 3 dollar draft beers. Cozy up to the bar, enjoy some friendly conversation, and the free bar nuts ( yummy). Also, the meat and cheese plate is great with 2 large portions of cheese and huge piles of prosciutto and another cured meat for a great deal! My boyfriend and I love this place and go here all the time.", "author": "Heather H."}

Internos is right around the corner from my apartment, yet last week was my first trip there after a former colleague's recommendation. Adnan set us up with two wonderful wines and a full plate of nuts, olives and chocolates to go with it. It capped off a perfect night for entertaining an out of town guest.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-23", "description": "Our second time to Internos and it was just as outstanding as our first visit. A quiet Sunday evening, a group of four, and some great wine from off the beaten track - we sampled wines from Spain, Greece, and Argentina, as well as more familiar regions of the US, France, and Australia. Totally unpretentious, great/friendly/knowledgeable service.  Highly recommended!", "author": "Walter A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-04", "description": "Let's think about this...  Adnan is an entrepreneur / business owner.   He works just like the rest of us to make a living.  I don't know Adnan very well, but I really enjoy his bar, wines, food, atmosphere, and service, and I would bet that his business plan is to create a warm and pleasant environment for his customer so he can benefit from repeat business and make the bar profitable - pretty simple math.  With that said, no business owner would turn down business, or create adverse publicity around their business unless it was for a just cause.  I appreciate that Adnan did not want to subject his paying customers to viewing another couple takeing their clothes off in the middle of his establishment.  This is not a discriminatory issue, it's simple business acumen.  I really enjoy Internos, it's a hip, fun, and relaxed place to drink fantastic wines any day after work - I hope to enjoy a glass with everyone next time I'm there!", "author": "Chalene C."}

I went here for drinks on a Saturday.  We got a table and it was busy but not crowded.  I enjoyed it and thought the wine list was pretty decent.  I am looking forward to going back.", "author": "Marie N."}

Nicely crafted wine list, with some eclectic, fun selections.  It's not an overwhelmingly long list, which I like.  Friendly, welcoming staff.  We sampled a few small plates and everything was tasty.  Be prepared for the noise when it's full.  Lots of hard surfaces and high ceilings = hard to hear your date when it's crowded.  We are looking forward to returning in the late afternoon when it's not so full.", "author": "A W."}
