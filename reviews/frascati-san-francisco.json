We made last-minute reservations here, low expectations, and we were immediately thrilled to find ourselves in a sweet, old-school (think in the sense of \"friendly\" rather than \"fusty\"), romantic place.  It's narrow and tall, with nooks and a mezzanine, and small attention to detail that make you feel like you're in a friend's home.  The maitre d' was charming and paid us attention; the waiter was equally so.  \n\nI like wine, so we brought a bottle, but it turns out their list (which I didn't see on line) is pretty magnificent.  There's a good mix of the cult and the more mainstream, and everything is really reasonably priced. \n\nOur meal was great -- a burrata appetizer and a mushroom bisque, steak and a beef bolognese pasta.  Everything was seasoned perfectly, with lingering flavors and great textures and it's, y'know, pricey not insanely expensive.  Go here with someone you love and when you leave you'll still be in love but you'll also love this place.", "author": "George G."}

Sadly, this was the high point of the experience for our group. \n\nOur server was oddly fascinated with the two couples at the table behind us. They seemed neither particularly challenging nor unusual, yet he watched them most of the time he was attending to our table. When he brought our wine, he opened it with his back to us while he chatted with the other customers. That was a first in my experience. Was it because we passed on the bottled water? Perhaps we were less handsome? We may never know, but now we have something to talk about for a while to come. \n\nIt didn't get better. Subsequent visits from our server were an off-putting mix of faux chumminess and complete disinterest. When we tried to order appetizers, his response was a clipped, \"Chef prefers to receive the appetizer and entr\u00e9e orders at the same time\" followed immediately by an about-face and speedy exit. This fellow was absolutely not interested in any reaction we may have had to his curt announcement. By the time we realized he had actually declined to take our order, he was on the other side of the room. \n\nWhen he did deign to take our order, he'd belt out a rehearsed line with too much volume and zest (\"Just to let you know, gentlemen, my favorite is the gnocchi!\") while his face and mannerisms conveyed a different message (\"get me away from these tap-water-drinking rubes.\")\n\nOne member of our party dared to point out that his entr\u00e9e, the duck breast on spaetzle, as well as the plate on which it sat, was cool, he got a pursed-lipped seminar on how duck often is not warm in the center. Fascinating lecture, but the customer was right -- interior, exterior, side elements and plate all had the temperature of a plate left sitting away from the warmer too long while other entrees were completed. Our server warned -- yes, this happened -- that reheating the food would result in it becoming overcooked. The customer patiently explained that other chefs manage to achieve medium-rare duck breast that is not cold to the touch, and that the choice being presented did not seem in keeping with the reputation of Frascati.\n\nHowever pained he looked to do it, he whisked the plate away. When he returned with the reassembled elements, the impossible had been achieved -- still-rare duck warm on the exterior and spaetzle at an edible temperature. It seems he under-estimated his chef. \n\nI could go on and on. Heaven knows we did when we decided to pass on dessert (\"The cheesecake is my favorite!!!\") and make an early exit from a place we'd hoped would be excellent. \n\nIt was far from excellent. The pastas and appetizers were adequate, but nowhere near good enough to erase the effect of genuinely peculiar service. The steak tartare, by the way, tastes like a plate of beets. The beef is 100 percent MIA from the tasting experience. \n\nSo, i'm putting this down as a bit of bad luck -- hitting a good place on a bad night, or just getting a server who is a seriously weak link the the business. Either way, there is no thought of returning.", "author": "Michael H."}

Parking is NOT good and the restaurant recommends you park at Polk & Broadway in a lot next to Walgreens. It's about 4 blocks away so not too bad, but the walk is uphill and I was hoping to find something closer. We left at 7:35 for an 8pm reservation and spent about 15 minutes looking for parking. Not Frascati's fault that parking is bad, just something to be weary of. \n\nService: \nI felt bad we were 15 mins late to our reservation, but Frascati sat us immediately at a nice table for two in the back of the restaurant. Staff was friendly and our waitress was so sweet. The kitchen had leftover gnocchi so they graciously gave us a free plate of it! Great way to start the meal as we were stressed from parking situation and being late to the restaurant. Our waitress was very attentive and their customer service was great. \n\nFood:\nI've been here several times and am a huge fan of the food here and this time did not disappoint! The cheese plate was delicious with 4 different cheeses and condiments such as almonds/walnuts, marmalade, apples, and fresh bread. It was surprisingly delicious and I enjoyed all the cheeses. Great variety of flavors. I had the duck, which was incredible and cooked perfectly. The maple sauce with the duck is amazing. My boyfriend had the lamb pappardelle and loved it. Very meaty - almost like pulled pork consistency and not short on lamb at all. Pasta was homemade and cooked al dente. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the experience. Was so glad I chose to eat here again! \n\nLove the restaurant and the neighborhood - Russian Hill is so cute and quiet. A definite must for anyone visiting the city!", "author": "Katie R."}

I really liked the sweet corn added to the dish--add some flavor and texture contrast.\n\nFor the second course, we ordered the octopus salad. This was probably my least favorite dish among the ones we have tried. It was okay but wish the octopus could be more crunchy and the salad could be more well seasoned & flavored. I have had much better octopus salad in other Italian/Mediterranean restaurants.\n\nFor the entrees, we ordered Grilled Pork Chop & Maple Leaf Duck Breast (5/5 for both). The pork chop was probably the best I have had for a while in the city. It's super tender and super juicy and super flavorful. Love the sauce accompanied the pork chop! And for the duck, I am always a big fan for duck. Yum!\n\nFor dessert, our waiter recommended the bread pudding. My friend and I weren't expecting that much. I am personally not a big fan for bread pudding but since the waiter has made pretty good recommendations so far, we trusted him. However, when we had our first bite, we couldn't stop. This was not a standard bread pudding. It was kinda chewy, crunchy at the same time and the topped ice cream had a vanillay & coffeey taste.

My husband liked it and it's more his style than mine.  For dinner I ordered the  fresh pappardelle with pork sugo.  Excellent!  I asked for a touch of the spiciness and didn't notice this at all so they may have omitted it altogether.  The sauce was chunky, noodles cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.  My husband had the alaskan halibut and was very happy with it. I thought at first it was not going to be filling enough and too delicate and simple for him...he's a steak and potatoes /braciole/risotto/lasagna/cream sauce kind of guy, but he loved it. I think he liked it's delicacy and loves peas so he enjoyed the spring vegetable ragout.\n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert so had to pass.

My bf had the halibut entree and I had the duck breast.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and presented beautifully. I loved the sauce for my duck (wish I had more).   My only complaint about my dish was that half the duck was cooked perfectly rare and half was overdone.  It was more of an execution thing bc the rest of the dish was lovely.  We had the famous bread pudding for dessert.  It was very tasty but I don't like super sweet desserts so it's not really for me.

We made reservations through yelp at 8:30pm and we got there 30 minutes early but was seated right away which was nice. The host gave us the menu right away and we looked through the menu. \n\nWe started off the night with some yummy sparkling wine. The prosecco was deliciously sweet and had some citrus taste which went well with all of our dishes. For starters we had steak tartare (definitely a recommendation!!) and two salads: octopus salad and strawberry salad. Steak tartare was super duper delicious and they give you four pieces of toasted bread and you eat it like a brushetta with some salad. *If you're not a fan of eating raw beef then you might want to skip on that.* After that our salads came. My favorite was the strawberry salad. The octopus salad was good with the oranges,olives and vinaigrette but I still preferred the sweetness of the strawberry salad with smoked duck breast meat instead. The strawberry salad definitely got my attention lol. For our main course, my boyfriend ordered the pan seared filet mignon and for myself I had the king salmon. Both were super delicious and tasty. For my boyfriend's filet mignon he had it medium rare which was perfectly cooked. My salmon also had perfect seasoning and some veggies on the side.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a vanilla-bean panna cotta. It was super good and not too sweet. They had some toffee pieces on top and it was just out of this world. I also secretly asked the waitress to put a candle for my boyfriend lol and she was totally cool with it. \n\nService and food is definitely 5/5! Will be back again! :)", "author": "Monica W."}

The russet potato gnocchi came with wild mushroom, butternut squash, sage, parmesan, and white truffle oil. The gnocchi was delicious! \nFor entrees we ordered the pork chop and lamb. My lamb was so good! Definitely the star of the show. My boyfriend loved his pork chops. We ordered their apple cobbler for dessert that came with vanilla bean ice cream.

The outside of the restaurant is pretty plain and simple, but I prefer it that way. It's right on the corner which makes it pretty easy to find. The customer service throughout the night was fantastic from the moment they sat us to our goodbyes. The ambience inside is romantic and dark, perfect for my occasion, however the place is pretty small so not ideal for large parties IMO. Now for the food.\n\nThe appetizers were fantastic. We started with the Potato Gnocchi and Beef Tartar. The gnocchi was amazing, perfectly made and the white truffle oil made it that much better. This was one of my first times eating beef tartar and I will highly recommend this one and keep eating it from now on if they all taste like this! The accompanying sauce suited it well and the meat was very fresh and savory.\n\nThe highlight of the night was the Octopus Salad, YOU HAVE TO GET THE OCTOPUS SALAD. I cannot stress it enough it was that darn good. The octopus was cooked to perfection and the size of the pieces were just perfect (the amount of octopus was very generous)The salad also came with chorizo (what?!?) that was my reaction to it but wow did it suit it well. These meaty flavors were balanced with the apricots and fresh greens in the salad and mild dressing. I wish I could eat this every night, a must have if you are eating dinner at Frascati!\n\nMy entree was good, but a bit under whelming following my appetizers. I ordered the pappardelle which came with pork Sugo, tomatoes, chilies, spinach and pecorino Romano. The flavor was good but I regret getting this as an entree as it did not pack the wow factor the appetizers did for me. The pappardelle itself was difficult to pull apart and got stuck together quickly which made it a bit more difficult to eat, nonetheless I finished it all, but next time I will definitely go with the duck breast or a different option.\n\nOverall I would recommend Frascati and I will be back again very soon to try some different entrees and get more of that octopus salad!", "author": "Josue V."}

We never really got the sense that we were really welcome. However the ambience was very pleasant. By the time we were ready to order at 8pm the place was starting to get packed.\nFor appetizer we ordered the tartare. Took about 20 minutes for the tartare to arrive. Admittedly this was a bit too adventurous for us and we didn't like it much. Tasted like a undercooked burger patty. I realize it is raw beef. But nothing memorable about it at all.\n\nFor entrees we had ordered the king salmon and the pappardelle.  There was a period of waiting for our food of nearly 30 minutes and our server never once checked on us. There was a large group opposite of us that seemed to get all the attention. We truly felt like back burner customers. When the food arrived it looked gorgeous. The pappardelle however was so bland. It tasted like canned tomatoes and not much else. The salmon was also pretty bland. The only thing I could taste was the overly charred sides where they \"seared\" it.\n \nIn hind sight we should have sent our entrees back and cut our losses of the evening. We were never asked how the meal was the entire time.\nWe wanted to get outta there so we asked for our check which was provided promptly. 10 minutes had gone by and several attempts to get the attention of our server failed. Again, all eyes were on the large group. We finally got the waiter after someone from said large group pointed the server our way since they noticed our waving.\nWe are relatively experienced diners and generally not too picky. We were here in SF on vacation and everywhere was amazing. This was literally the only thing we experienced in SF that was poor. Based on the average reviews of Frascata it sounds like we ordered the wrong things and got unlucky with our service. 100+ dollars dinner for 2 we expected so much more.

Unfortunately, bad planning led to last minute dinner plans which led to a crazy long wait time.... everywhere. \n\nWe wandered into this area because there was a 2hr wait at all the other places where we usually dine. (I'm lookin' at you Lord Stanley, 1760 and Stone's Throw)\n\nWithin minutes, we were seated and ready to order.\n\nWine\n- Decent cab, but I was too hungry to care about the booze haha.\n\nFood\n- Smoked Salmon Bruschetta: YUM. Only two pieces but the flavor was there! When we ordered, I imagined more of a lox and schmear kinda deal, but nope, what we were served was infinitely better!\n- Octopus Salad: Heavy heavy heavy salad. Nice chunks of octopus balanced out with the bite from the arugula and salinity from the olives. There was a bit too much potato for me and I ended up not having room to order an entree for myself. \n- Roasted Half Chicken: He is obsessed with chicken and I'm glad (for once) that he is! This chicken was so juicy and delicious with an amazing crispy skin. Wow.\n\nThe only hitch was the service. Our server was so brusque and a little curt. It wasn't even close to closing (7pm) in a half empty restaurant and he already seemed like he wanted us to leave as fast as possible.", "author": "Crystal Z."}

Cute place ran by the owners. The owners wife bakes much of the dessert menu on her own. Food was amazing, however, portions were on the smaller side. For 3 people we got 3 appetizers and each got an entree. The appetizers we got were the burrata, grilled bread salad,  and the potato gnocchi. All 3 were amazing. I got the eggplant risotto which seemed interesting to me since I never had something like it. The eggplant was shredded into the mixture and every blended perfectly and I was very satisfied with my selection.

From walking down the quaint neighborhood to entering your small, charming little place.. when I think of the SF dining experience, you will always come to mind.\n\nWe got there hoping against hope that the wait won't be too long. Took a while to find parking as this little neighborhood was very busy. Went up and down those notorious vertical hills, got to see alcatraz in the distance while circling around. Nice bonus.\n\nOnce we got to you, one of your men basically told us, he would hook us up and find a seat for us despite it being pretty packed despite a lack of reservation. And so you did. So you did. Got seated pretty quickly. Bonus points. The atmosphere here is great, and the service was bar none.\n\nAnd the food. I already knew which dishes I wanted to try (thanks yelp!). Debating between the Maple Duck, the Pork Chop or the Chicken. Went with Maple Duck (because it looks so pretty) and the Chicken (bc only a top notch restaurant does chicken really well). We waited. We got. We ate. We cried. oh so good.\n\n(somewhere in between I took picture of the food like a good yelp addict)\n\nDang Frascati. You nailed the chicken. it was as juicy as people said it was. I rarely order chicken unless I am at a really good restaurant and have high expectations and you nailed it. Very good. The Duck was good as well. Love the mix of flavors.\n\nOverall it was a sweet time. Ambiance + Good Food + Good Service + Good Neighborhood + Good Time = 5 stars.\n\nEnjoy it. You deserve it.\n\nI will be back to try other dishes.... so be ready.", "author": "Paul L."}

The octopus was plump and tender. The burrata didn't taste quite fresh. The duck was decent, but for $30, I expected something more refined.

They should really throw out the ones that have turned blackish.\n\nWe got seated upstairs, with a view to the dining room. The service was swift and friendly.

It was so good that it turned my cooter into the Fountains of Bellagio, with music playing and all.

I scarfed down my portion and wanted more.\n\nThe pappardelle with beef sugo, caprese salad and lamb appetizer were also excellent. Actually, I have a feeling that everything on the menu is delicious. I did try the much raved about black and white bread pudding for dessert though, and thought it was just okay.

Expect to spend $100 for two.\n\nOrdered:\n1. Russet Potato Gnocchi w/ Butternut Squash\n2.  Octopus Salad\n3.  Fresh Pappardelle\n4. Maple Leaf Duck Breast.\n\n---\n\n1.  Gnocchi was cooked to perfection.  It was served with Mushrooms and Sage, though they are cut so fine that you won't get a spoonful of just mushrooms.  I myself am not a big fan of mushrooms, but the way the chef prepared this dish made it tasteful, without getting a huge portion of mushroom per bite.  \n\n2.  My favorite was the Octopus Salad.  The Champagne vinaigrette that is served with this salad is very sharp, yet is a great compliment to the Feta, white beans, and cucumbers.  If you are looking to go w/ just one starter, I'd recommend this.  The portion is good sized for two, and a very tasteful starter.  I would have liked to have a little more octopus in the salad (As I am a big octopus fan), but the salad overall was great.\n\n3.  My least favorite of our choices.  While still tasteful, the pappardelle stuck together over time, but came apart without pulling up other pieces.  The pork ragout that is served with is has a very strong flavor but really paired well.  Overall, the flavor I was impressed.\n\n4.  They serve the duck medium rare so you'll have to tell the waiter/waitress how you want it cook, if you want it cooked differently.  I normally each meat medium rare so this was perfect.  Not a single big of duck remained, as it was a great dish.  The duck breast is lean, with little to no fat, and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Mustard greens are served with this dish, which I was a little hesitant about, but the chef prepared a nice proportion.  Not too much, and not too little.  There are enough on the side to taste, but it's not overdone so it drowns out the natural taste of the duck.  From the entree perspective, I'd highly recommend and would eat again!", "author": "Jared N."}

To say that we were satisfied is an understatement. The staff was wonderful, especially the bartender, with whom we interacted the most. Very helpful, knowledgeable, and accommodating. We decided to each have a salad and share an entree so that we could leave room for dessert. The salads are very generous and filling. Unlike a lot of other restaurants, it's not all greens with a few tidbits thrown in. I highly recommend the Grilled Bread Salad, which I plan to replicate some time soon. My wife enjoyed the Roasted Persimmon Salad a great deal. And we shared an ample portion of the Braised Short Ribs, which literally melts in your mouth. The accompaniments were also perfectly prepared; we loved the horseradish potato puree so much, we will be replicating that this week!\n\nSo yes, we saved room for dessert, and so glad we did. We usually don't get dessert because we end up eating too much beforehand, but we were so happy to enjoy the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta, so light and delicious, and the caramelized banana was a most perfect addition. \n\nIn short, this was the best meal we had in San Francisco and we are so glad we saved the best for last. I highly recommend Frascati, just make sure to make a reservation, which you can do right at their Web site. This is truly a five-star restaurant.\n\nIncidentally, to clarify on my survey answers, I indicated that I'm not sure this place is good for groups because it really is small and intimate, though I suppose if you make a reservation for a large group well enough in advance, they could probably accommodate. Also, I personally don't think Frascati is suitable for children unless they are well-behaved and have mature palates. And yes, the attire is casual, but be aware that this is an upscale restaurant, so leave the ball caps and cutoff shorts behind.", "author": "Ralph M."}

We were seated upstairs, and it was blazing hot due to the small kitchen just below. We were seated a few minutes early and out waiter was very attentive throughout the meal. My sister and I can be a bit of a pain sometimes when dining out, but he rolled with the punches with an experienced hand by mixing humor and keeping it real. Our food came out very well timed, with good pauses so I could mingle with my guests.\n\nThe food was beyond everyone's expectations, which were already high. The bread, focaccia and regular, was fresh and light. I started with a grilled bread salad, which had a perfectly light champaign dressing, goat cheese, white beans, cucumbers and olives a all over it. I don't even like salad, but me and my mom loved this one. My sister shared some faux gras, which I wasn't too pleased with but did have a try (not my thing). My best friend had some burrata (cheese on toasts) that she really enjoyed. My brother in law enjoyed his fresh corn bisque soup.\n\nFor main courses, several of us had the best chicken ever. It wasn't overly sophisticated, but was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor. I enjoyed the crispy chicken skin (normally not my thing), along with the lovely artichoke, potatoes and onion accompanying it. One of my friends had the risotto and the other gnocchi, but we'd have enjoyed another vegetarian option. Another friend had the duck and it was sumptuous.

We found it to be a quiet, spacious, two storey restaurant with unique food and a pleasant staff. It is a great date spot. It feels very European; elegant and stylish. The food was really interesting; from appetizers to the main course to the dessert we had. The grilled bread salad was huge and the duck breast and lemon chicken were well prepared and seasoned just right. Our service was excellent, we really felt that our waitress was personal and polite, not rushing us or pushing us to order anything we did not want. Very nice experience.", "author": "Jennifer E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-02", "description": "We came here for NYE dinner. They have a 3-4 course pre-fixe menu for the night ($90 for 3 courses and $100 for 4). The hubby and I shared 2 appetizers, 1 salad, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the veal tartar and scallops. The veal tartar was so so -- the meat was tender, but I thought the fixings were lacking. There was no small dices of cornichons/red onions, which I think is very necessary to add texture and zing. Also no quail egg on top, either. The scallops were very good. The morsels were well seared and caramelized on the outside and tender on the inside, in a word, perfectly prepared.It sat on a little bed of sauce that was yummy, too. I wish there were more than three scallops, and the scallops were on the small side, too.\n\nThe pear salad had one piece of roasted butternut squash and 2 dabs of blue cheese. The arugula was fresh and the dressing was super good. It had a depth of flavor that makes me think they reduced the vinegar a bit. I'm not a big salad person and this was pretty good, although unremarkable.\n\nThe surf and turf entree was the star of the evening. The lobster claw is delicate and sweet and so fresh. The steak was just the way we wanted, medium rare. The meat was very tender and had a nice char crust. The lobster sat on a small pile of noodles in a seafood-y cream sauce. The lamb shanks were a bit dry on the outside. It was properly cooked and fall off the bone, but it needed more sauce. I think when they reheated the shank for service, that's when it dried out a bit.\n\nThe dessert was an apple crumble. We were beyond full at the point now. The apple crisp was simple and no crazy seasonings. I thought it was OK.\n\nAltogether, I thought the food was probably 3.5 stars and the service 4.5. We had a table of 10 and the servers were attentive and didn't get any orders wrong, which is pretty remarkable for NYE. And the space was tight and no one knocked anything over. I thought it was a bit overpriced at $150 per head (also shared 3 bottles of wine that was on the pricy side). I don't feel like the food was good enough for me to go back to, though.", "author": "Alice W."}

Warm spinach with perfectly prepared duck, small crumbles of blue cheese, cranberries with a warm balsamic. Heaven, and the softer Bordeaux wine went perfectly. I am craving the salad as I recount it. \n\nThe pork chop followed - juicy and cooked throughout without being dry, an achievement for a thick pork-chop. The cabbage was unremarkable, but the apple compote with the olive oil potatoes were well done. Hard to follow the perfect salad, but overall I was extremely pleased with my choices. \n\nWe decided to forgo desert. \n\nI would definitely recommend.

But reading the reviews we were looking for epic as far as food and were disappointed. Two appetizers and an entree and for all three we felt the food was good... But not great. Flavors not really matching up... Like when you cook a meal at home and have a 'missed moment' in the bringing together of the dish. \n\nI should add the drink issue. I had one of the the cocktails they offer (not rating on this... But thought I would mention). It was quite awful... And poor quality. I didn't drink it and it sat untouched on the table the entire meal, dessert, and pay process. And... No mention about this from the waiter. It was obvious I was unhappy yet nothing. Now yes... Me disliking a drink is not the restaurant's fault and it should not be. BUT... In a place as 'nice' as this, it should at least be brought up. Kind of weird to be honest. \n\nOh the good you ask?

All the above dishes have been described so well by my fellow yelpers, but few have described this dessert with the same depth. Some claim it's the best dessert in the city and that they come here just for this dessert. Not so sure I would agree with that. It was good, but does not live up to the reviews. Here's why:\nI like my bread pudding on the softer side, almost \"custardy.\" This bread pudding has been reported as dense, which is true because it is denser than what you would expect for bread pudding, but it is not dense like a fudge brownie or flowerless cake). In fact, if you look closely at the bread pudding, you can appreciate that the texture looks just like the white part of bread.\n\nTaste: The center was pretty dry because it didn't absorb the melted ice cream. The dessert was still tasty, but not worth spending calories for. I have such a terrible sweet tooth that my husband could not believe I left the dessert unfinished. It was definitely reheated too, because the center was cooler than the outsides. \n\nPresentation: I don't really know why the word \"white\" is in this dessert. Aside from the obvious white ice cream, the bread pudding only has a few specks of white chocolate--this bread pudding is 99% brown. \n\nOverall: I regret ordering the dessert because it didn't live up to my expectations, but if I hadn't ordered it then I would still be wondering if I missed out. Despite my disappointment with this dessert, this restaurant still deserves a 5 star for how well everything else tasted. \n\nI would still come back here and recommend this place to friends and family, but I'd think twice before ordering dessert.", "author": "Logan N."}

I'm ready to take some responsibility for what I ordered and the resulting texture issues.\nI'm happy for any restaurant that appears to be doing well, but to describe the atmosphere as intimate or romantic is a stretch.

The broth with vegetables was delicious and the gnocchi was moist and succulent. The lamb ragu pappardelle was very good but I craved parmesan not the feta it came with. I felt the parmesan would have given the dish more depth but that's a totally personal taste. Now the lemon pudding was fantastic - I don't often do dessert but I can't forgo a lemon cake. This was a denser lemon cake and I loved it with the berry sauce and a wonderful dollop of sweet cream on top. I really wanted seconds but my pants were telling me no!

Dessert and coffee (the panna cotta was delicate and the chocolate chip cheesecake was not too heavy or too sweet), were worthy compliments to the starters and the entrees. \n\nThe service. Our waiter was... odd. He wasn't outright rude, he was cold and unfriendly.\n\nHe did the weirdest thing: My cell phone was on the table, and when he came to ready the table for the food, he picked it up and put it on my bread plate. Like that was the best place he could think of to put it, OR, he was was trying to scold me for having my phone on the table. Weird.\n\nHe was not engaging. When we sat down and he came over I said we were here for my husband's birthday, he sort of blew that off. I was hoping for a candle or something on his dessert, nothing. I wasn't expecting a routine a la Friday's, but something to acknowledge the occasion would have been appropriate.\n\nOur dessert was brought by the host/maitre d, and his smile and warm tone was such a nice change from the pinched, uncomfortable episodes with our waiter. Why our dessert/coffee were served by the host is a mystery to me. Again, he wasn't terrible, it was \"serviceable\" service. He was fine. I tipped over 20% (because the reality of the experience didn't hit me until I got home, and the food was great.).

He said everything served with the chicken tasted good, though.    \nHalibut - So disappointing, especially since our waitress said it was the best thing on the menu.  The halibut was cooked perfectly, but the dish had no flavor.  I had a couple bites with pancetta that were OK, but for the most part it was bland.

For a little neighborhood place like this, with such great rating, I expected so much more, but the overall experience was mediocre at best.\n\nThe salads were weird: I had the grilled bread salad, which I thought would be a nice panzanella, but it was mainly a bunch of greens with some cruttons, which weren't anything special, and some sparse other ingredients.  I almost thought there was no onion, but then I founds some.  The octopus salad wasn't much better, with very little octopus, and it was kind of flavorless.\n\nThe swordfish special we had was reallly weird.  It was supposed to be served with grilled radicchio, but had maitake mushrooms instead.  The pork chop was a little over-cooked and not very tasty.\n\nDessert was pretty unimpressive too.  As was our server, who just seemed to have no time or patience to help us out with wine choices...maybe he lacked the knowledge to really engage, I don't know.  We ordered a glass of sparkling each before the menus even came, and were ready to drink to celebrate, but we ended up with just some glass pours because he didn't give me the confidence to committ to a bottle.\n\nMaybe this place is coasting on an old reputation?

Maybe it was an off night. Maybe it was that our expectations were too high. Maybe it just really isn't four stars. Maybe it really just is...A-OK.\n\nBoyfriend wanted to make it a special date night, but knows almost nothing about the Bay Area. His usual is go to Yelp, find highest rated, oh look there it is! Okay let's go here. I tried to explain that sometimes that just isn't how it works, but he insisted and so I let him. That and we couldn't get reservations to The Palace so this was next on our list. We were able to get a 9:30p reservation on a Saturday night.\n\nParking is a nightmare. No heels lest you want a reason to use that deductible on your newly-mandated health insurance or you're an experienced drag queen.\n\nThe wine was good. Came out quick enough. We ordered two starters; burrata and the wild mushroom bruschetta. We watched hopefully as a table of four was seated 10 minutes after us...receive their starters about 15 minutes before we did. Maybe it was 20. The point is that we waited for about 25 minutes for our starter. To their defense the staff were apologetic, but I cannot believe that a restaurant would take 25 minutes to plate a simple starter or two during a time when most of the patrons were drinking their last sips of wine and signing the check.\n\nThe dinner itself was good - the quail risotto was fantastic, actually. The pomegranate seeds would burst as you chewed into it, making this complex flavor pairings amongst the butternut squash and creamy risotto. The filet mignon was equally delicious, but I can't comment much because that wasn't my dish.\n\nThe crowning disappointment of the meal, of course, was dessert. Their piece de resistance, the black and white chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream is touted as \"amazing\" \"omg\" and \"nomnomnom.\" To me it was dense, dry, and completely underwhelming. The hazelnut ice cream was good but absolutely not measured to the critical acclaim as it is shown in fellow reviews. Did we get an off piece of cake? Was the pastry chef out of town and they let their intern make it? I'm saddened because my love for chocolate knows no bounds, and yet there I was...not touching the cake.\n\nThe service was good, albeit slow. On a Saturday night. At 10p. Which is fine, I guess...until you look at the bill. Then it's not so great.\n\nMaybe we'll come back, but not before we explore the rest of the city first.", "author": "Jaime L."}

The ambiance is really warm and romantic, and you can sit downstairs where it's more boisterous or upstairs where you have a view of the place and a little more quiet. \n\nThe food was solid, but I think the ambiance and the service wins over (hence my rounding up to 4 stars). I'd come back and try some different dishes.\n\n* Russet Potato Gnocchi - 3.5 stars\n(with Melted Leeks, Mushrooms, English Peas, Baby Carrots, Parmesan and White Truffle Oil $10)\nReally nice truffle oil flavor. The gnocchi was soft & chewy but got hard kind of quickly. The veggies in the dish seemed misplaced. \n\n* Foie Gras Torchon - 2.5 stars\n(with apple-currant compote, sauterne gastrique and toasted brioche $14)\nThe foie gras tasted like canned pate. It was extremely salty as well. Not a dish worth ordering.\n\n* Grilled Pork Chop -\n(with Smashed Potato, Pancetta-Grilled Scallion Vinaigrette, Cipollini Jus and Tomato-Olive Compote $27)\nMy friend got this and enjoyed it.. I didn't get to try a bite =(.\n\n* Maple Leaf Duck Breast - 3.5 stars\n(with Herb Spaetzle, Hearts of Palm, Mushrooms, Scallions, Grilled Radicchio and Huckleberry Sauce $26)\nReally nice & tender duck breast. There were a lot of flavors and textures that went together pretty well, bu the huckleberry sauce was a little too tart and overpowering.\n\n* Warm black and white chocolate bread pudding - 4.5 stars\n(hazelnut ice cream, caramel and chocolate sauce $8)\nREALLY nice. This is more of an intense and moist dark chocolate brownie. Just wish the ice cream wasn't as sweet.. something like vanilla bean would have paired perfectly with this.\n\n* Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta - 4 stars\n(Caramelized Bananas and Almond Roc)\nAlso very nice. The panna cotta was a little on the soft side; I like a little more rigidness to my panna cotta (so there is a little more resistence when you slice your spoon through it. Not to the point that it's like Jello. I just like having a balance to the texture).", "author": "Ziyan C."}

We've been twice, and have had excellent experiences both times. For entrees, the two dishes that stood out in my opinion were 1) the rabbitt and 2) the roasted chicken. I know what you're thinking - chicken? Why would you order chicken, are you nuts? But oh, this chicken will change your mind about ordering chicken out. It was the juiciest, best tasting chicken I've ever tasted. Also, typically my husband and I are not into dessert, but the warm chocolate cake was calling out to us from the menu, screaming \"eat me!!\" So glad we caved! What a delicious ending to such a great meal!\"\n\nThe service here is also stellar. The perfect amount of attention where they're there when you need a refill on your wine, but not too much such that they feel like they are hovering over you all the time. Both times, we had excellent servers, and everyone else in the restaurant that we spoke with were also very accommodating and friendly.\n\nI highly recommend you take someone special...or even a group of girlfriends...out for a nice meal at this cozy little restaurant.

It came served with some pieces of crostini and crispy shallots.  There was a large amount of tartare and even after heaping it onto the crostini I had some left.  The flavor of it was awesome as it had some acidity (mushroom vinaigrette) that cut through the meat and helped make the taste even better.  For my dinner entree I decided to go with the duck which was served with mushrooms, spaetzle, hearts of palm and a huckleberry sauce.  The duck was a bit under seasoned although tasted exquisite whenever I got some well seasoned bites.  Everything underneath the duck sort of reminded me of a good stuffing and while I enjoyed the Huckleberry sauce at the beginning, I was getting tired of it near the end of my meal.

It's such a wonderful setting especially for a dinner around the holidays because you have the lights adorning the trees on the streets and the cable car running by. It just feels so San Francisco, so home. \n\nNow on to business. I had a reservation here at 5:45 with two friends and was seated promptly. To start, I ordered a Cabernet, but unfortunately I can't tell you what kind it was because I'm not much of a wine drinker. I just know that I like Cabernet! This was definitely the best wine I ever had in my life, which probably isn't saying much, but then again this is coming from someone who doesn't like wine!  At this point I'm having high hopes for the meal.\n\nThe nice waitress we had gave us plenty of time to decide on our food and answered any questions we had. We decided on the following:\n\n(1) russet potato gnocchi -- 3 stars. the gnocchi seemed bland and doughy. nothing special.\n\n(2) octopus salad -- 3 stars. for an octopus salad to receive 5 stars, it better have some super fresh octopus and greens, the ingredients in this salad were pretty mediocre.\n\n(3) grilled pork chop -- 4 stars. very well-made, great taste, tender. a solid piece of pork shop. but i wouldn't come here again for the pork chop.\n\n(4) roasted half chicken -- 5 stars. well-seasoned, moist throughout, and downright delicious!! this is honestly the best roasted chicken i ever had in my life. ironically, my friends and i were skeptical about this dish because we were like, \"how good can chicken be? it's always dry at the breast.\" but this chicken completely shocked us because it was not dry whatsoever. i would definitely return to frascati for the chicken and the chicken alone, and it's 90% of the reason why i gave frascati an overall rating of 5 stars (the other 10% was for the wine and service). if a restaurant can do one dish so well that it'll redefine the way i think about, in this case, chicken, it deserves 5 stars. well-done, frascati!\n\n(5) warm black & white chocolate bread pudding -- 3.5 stars. the bread pudding was not warm because the ice cream made it cold. it was also dense, chewy, and boring in flavor. i don't see what the hype is all about.\n\n(6) pumpkin pie -- 2.5 stars. cold but edible. didn't have much pumpkin flavor either.\n\nIn sum, i would come here again but next time i would skip all the small talk and cut to the chase--two roasted half chickens and one glass of that awesome cabernet all to myself!", "author": "Katherine Y."}

We got an awesome table on the upper level right by a window overlooking the street. Similar to many Russian hill spots this place has a charming, cozy.....dare I say, Romantic feel. We started with the gnocchi and burratta and split the shrimp/scallop main. The food was excellent, though so may say small portions, we thought they were perfect. Usually I want to roll over and die after eating gnocchi, this was just the right amount to share. We brought our own bottle of wine. Interesting corkage pricing: first bottle $20, second $25, third $30 (3 bottle max). Still $20 corkage is reasonable to say the least. Our server was very nice, attentive and polite (shocking for SF I know, her mom taught her well) \n\nForgot to mention we had the cheese plate for dessert which was awesome.

Having been a while since my dinner experience here, forgive me for any misinformation, or lack there of. The main takeaway is that the food here was quite tasty, so, never mind the particulars and give it a shot!\n\nComing in for dinner with my dad several months back, we ordered (I believe) a blood orange tuna carpaccio, flat-iron steak, roasted half chicken, and chocolate bread pudding. While the carpaccio wasn't particularly interesting to me, one must consider I'm not a huge fan of raw fish - that said, it was still a bit too sweet, and the slices were still a bit too thick to captivate me. And while my dad's steak was enjoyable, the chicken was where the meal truly shined: moist, tender, flavorful, and just overall amazing. By the time we got around to dessert, I was already painfully full, so it was a _little_ unfortunate that the dessert was as hefty as it was. But, that said, it was pretty tasty, and surprisingly, not as horrifically sweet as I had feared it would be.\n\nI can't remember what the bill came out to, but I believe it was roughly $90 or so after tax. A bit hefty at first glance, but, not so bad once you consider that we ate enough to feed three (or possibly four). Decor was a little bit more upscale than I was expecting, so I was taken aback a little, but Frascati would certainly make for a nice dinner date. Just be prepared, because trying to find street parking here is ridiculous - we eventually settled for a garage, after almost 20 minutes of circling the area.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Everything they did was done very well and there was no sense of them trying to stretch beyond that, which is refreshing in a city where a lot of restaurants try to be more than they are.\n\nFirst off, we were running late for our reservation. We called and asked if we could move it back half an hour and they made it work, no problem. They have a beer and wine only menu, but their wine menu was quite good. They had quite a range of prices, from $40-$150. There were California, French, and Italian sections along with \"interesting\" red and white sections that didn't fit into those categories. The waitress was not only knowledgeable about the entire list, but also was able to communicate it in a simple and understandable manner.\n\nThe steak tartare was quite good. The beef was more finely cut than most places, and the crispy shallots gave it a very unique and savory flavor. Also, the ratio of steak to toast was absolutely optimal. When they brought the appetizers, one person got something other than what they ordered. However, they expedited the correct one and it was on the table with two minutes. The waitress also came over, said it was her mistake and apologized. Very nicely handled.\n\nAll the entree portions were large and very tasty, everyone enjoyed their meals.

There were 6 of us so I was a little worried about portion sizes - but these were appropriately sized for sharing. The gnocchi was excellent! Really knocked it out of the park. The tomato salad was a bit blah. Don't get me wrong, it was good - but where was the wow? The fig salad was also very good although the balsamic was a tad overwhelming. We started with Sancerre (similar to a sauvignon blanc) which was deliciously light and refreshing. One of the things I loved about Frascati is that every single server we spoke with was more than willing and able to provide a wine recommendation. \n\nMy mom and I shared the flank steak and the sausage risotto. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium) and was very tender. I thought the flavors were good. The parsnips that came with it seemed a little droopy though. The risotto was just ok - nothing to write home about. There wasn't much sausage in it. Others at the table ordered the duck and the halibut and everyone seemed to agree they were pretty good. With our main course we had a Pinot Noir (from Washington maybe?) that our waiter suggested which was excellent. \n\nWe had a fruit tart waiting at home so unfortunately we didn't get to try anything off their dessert menu.

First time was to celebrate the bf and my 1 year anniversary and second time was to celebrate Father's Day... appropriate for both occasions! \n\nFood was YUMMMM!!! These are some of the items I've tried.\n\nAppetizers:\nMushroom Bruschetta (3.5 stars): Personally I'm not a huge mushroom fan, but I did like the combination of mushrooms they were using, flavor wasn't too mushroomy, 'shrooms had good texture... Probably would be 4-5 stars if you are a mushroom lover!\n\nSteak Tartare (3 stars): Also not bad, but to be honest, I'm more partial towards Vietnamese steak carpaccio because I think it has simpler, yet richer flavors.\n\nEntrees:\nMaple Leaf Duck (5 stars): OMGeeees... love. Maybe I'm being racist, but duck at \"American\" places usually disappoints me because I'm Chinese... so usually I compare all types of duck to Chinese Roast Duck because Chinese people really have their recipe for super flavorful (yet oily) and tender duck DOWN. But this one DID NOT disappoint! Duck was so tender, and I loved all the combinations of ingredients they added to this dish... the spaetzle (kinda pasta-y/cheesy consistency), heart of palm, and other things that I naturally had to google to find out what it was.\n\nGrilled Pork Chop (5 stars): Also super delicious. Pork is a tricky one sometimes because people tend to overcook it for fear of having rare pork... but this one was cooked just right, and it was one of the most tenderest porks I've ever had.\n\nDessert:\nChocolate Bread Pudding (10 million stars plz): This dessert was AMAZING. Wow wow wow. Wow? It's kinda like a sweet, semi-thick chocolate cake with some bombass hazelnut ice cream that perfectly balances and complements the whole thing. I would go back to this restaurant JUST FOR THIS. Probably big enough for 2-4 ppl depending on how hungry you are, but I can probably eat one of these on my own and so can the bf just because it's so delicious. They sometimes run out near the end of the night, so ask your waiter to save you one!\n\nI forgot what fish my mom had, but she said that was also really delicious.

I'd go through and describe each one but best for you to go there and be happily surprised.  \n\nA small place with an upstairs loft that gets really hot, even in the winter, so if you're always cold request an upstairs table.  The entire restaurant is very warm so dress lightly.  \n\nThe sommelier will help pick out a fantastic wine to go with your meal. They focus on smaller boutique wineries rather than the big box, high output vintners so you're likely to find a new favorite.", "author": "Dena M."}

The service at face value was great. Our server was attentive and very nice.  The low rating is due to the wine recommendation from the server.  My boyfriend and I asked for a good Italian red wine because we did not know any of the wines on the list.  And yes, potentially using the word \"good\" was our downfall, but the three recommendations were for wines with prices ranging from $90 - $135.  With a wine list that has a bottle of wine for $36, recommending only the top shelf wines seems kind of bizarre.  Or at least if you are going to recommend the $135 bottle of wine, point it out on the wine list so the customer knows what they will be paying.  Our server gave us the description of the wine and did not reference the list at all, so we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into until the bill arrived and we had managed to order the $135 bottle.  \n\nI definitely learned my lesson on requesting a recommendation on wine, but shame on the server for padding the bill with an expensive bottle of wine without full disclosure to the customer.", "author": "Katie T."}

It took everything we had to stop from scoffing these starters down. Next we had the pork chop and tagliatelle with pork fennel sausage - my friend had the pasta and she was speechless.

The gnocchi was good. It was served with a truffle oil sauce with asparagus, peas and tomatoes. The server told us it was one of his favorite appetizers in the restaurant.

The Spaetzle that was served with the duck was delicious. \n\nTo add onto our food coma, we ordered the chocolate warm bread pudding.

Of all the dishes we tried among the table, I'd say the pork chop was the best. Also, the black and white bread pudding was good but definitely overhyped.

It appears they did not have a bus staff --- so he was running around trying to do everything at once and therefore was not very chatty.

August 1st is a very special day in our lives and I wanted it to be perfect.   We were visiting from Portland and after a lot of research, Frascati was our choice for this important night.  After all the great reviews on Yelp and after the best dinner of my life at Cafe Claude the evening before, I was somewhat disappointed in Frascati.  \n\nI reserved a table a month in advance through Open Table.  I specifically requested their best table and attached a note explaining that we were in town for a very special day.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated immediately, which was nice.  However, I would consider the table one of the worst in the restaurant as it was right next to the bread sideboard, where the wait staff was constantly cutting bread.  The best table was in front of the windows, far away from where we were sitting.  \n\nOur waiter, Michael?, was very knowledgeable and happy to give details about the food and wine (nice wine list and generous pours).  We started with the Foie Gras Torchon ($14) with Apple-Currant Compote, Sauterne Gastrique and Toast Points.  This was our first time having Foie Gras and it was pretty good, although I don't have anything to base it on.  It came with two toast points, four would have been appreciated.  \n\nMy husband had a wonderful watermelon salad ($8) with toasted pistachios, ricotta salata, balsamic vinaigrette, black sea salt and mint.  It was so original and easily the best dish of the entire meal.  I had the heirloom tomato salad ($10) with ricotta salata, micro basil, olive oil and black sea salt.  It was good, but I wish I would have ordered the watermelon!\n\nThe entrees were nice portions and presented very well.  I had the Grilled Pork Chop ($27) with grilled white peach, frisee, mizuna, spiced plums and cipollioni jus.  It was quite good.  Hubby had a grilled strip steak ($27), which he says is the best steak he has ever had.

If I craved New American cuisine, I would hope for Gary Danko and settle for Marlowe. I'm so happy my friend CN reintroduced Frascati earlier this month because it was simply marvelous this time around.\n\nSteak tartare wasn't on the menu that night, so we decided to share the octopus salad. This was the most incredible octopus salad I've had in my life--it was so balanced, clean, and nuanced in flavors. I just loved the big chunks of fresh octopus. You know a dish is successful when it leaves you wanting... Just. One. More. Bite.\n\nFor our main courses, I had the scallops with lobster ragout and CN had the duck breast with mascarpone polenta. The four jumbo, perfectly cooked scallops were plump and tasty. I didn't care for the lobster ragout because I couldn't see or taste the lobster. I also enjoyed the savory duck alongside the creamy polenta, but the skin could've been crispier. Much crispier. Like the $13 roast duck in Chinatown.\n\nFor dessert we had the warm black and white chocolate bread pudding. It was neither too sweet nor too rich. Although not the best I've ever had, it was definitely a sweet ending. Frascati will never be Gary Danko, but it doesn't try to be.

Overall quality and presentation was adequate? If you have been to Nopa, Frascati is not quite as good if that makes any sense. For apps, we ordered the Bruscheta, Soup, Duck Confit salad and Octopus salad. Our mains were the Pork Chop, Duck Breast, Filet Mignon and fresh Papperdalle. The salads stood out. Of the mains, i would recommend the Filet and duck breast. As you can see from all the photos uploaded, the Duck breast entree is very popular but the plating/presentation could be much improved. Good food but maybe not somewhere id go again for a while with all the choises in SF.", "author": "Denny C."}

We ordered the ahi tuna tartare appetizer which tasted very fresh, albeit a bit salty  Then I had the capellini puttanesca, which I enjoyed, with a nice blend of olive and anchovies, and my friend had the maple leaf duck breast.  He really liked the spaetzel with the duck, and thought the duck was good if not a bit salty as well.   We finished it off with the yummy peach blueberry cobbler (they do not skimp on dessert sizes).  I ordered a viognier but would choose differently next time.  Overall, the food was excellent albeit salty.  The service was well intentioned but spotty - our server forgot to bring bread, and then was slow to give us utensils, but the manager or owner was regularly circulating and very helpful. \n\nDefinitely a cute/romantic restaurant.  i can see why it's so popular.  I think the ground level was nicer than the upstairs area, which was more intimate but had a weird layout.   (I also was surprised to hear that there was only one bathroom that was co-ed).

We shared the steak tartare appetizer and enjoyed the duck breast and fresh papardelle pasta with steak. The steak tartare was my favorite dish out of the three. The steak sugo in the pappardelle pasta was a little salty to my taste but I also tend to prefer less salt in general so in this case I think it's probably a preference thing. The duck breast dish was tasty, even the lentils in the dish was perfectly prepared. Nice wine by the glass list and a friendly waiter. My one complaint is tables are quite close and a little claustrophobic and there's a lot of commotion since the restaurant is small. In some ways I guess it's nice to have the bustling because it feels homier and cozier. Otherwise, I'd recommend the place to anyone looking for a nice family dinner or a solid date spot.

I hope to go back again now that I could eat more than a couple things off the menu (there was not many options for vegetarians).\nI'll add that while Frascati is totally San Francisco/Californian, my parents and I are rooted in New England traditions and I think that Frascati pulls off some of this conservative, respectful, humble, and elegant pride.

I had heard wonderful things about Frascati so I was really happy when they had a table immediately available for us walk-ins. \n\nWe started off with a bottle of wine, which they immediately brought over after we ordered it. The bread they give you unfortunately has a stale taste to it but the olive oil bottle they provide is pretty cute. For the starters, I got to try the gnocchi and the foie gras torchon. Both were very delicious. I loved the truffle oil and the mushrooms on the gnocchi dish. Everything blended well together. The foie gras was wonderful - rich and creamy, its flavors perfectly pairing with the apples and raisins accompanying the dish. The portions were also perfect - not too large but not too small. For the entrees, I sampled the halibut and the pork chop. Both were just ok - cooked perfectly but the favors were missing a \"wow factor\" for me. The way the menu described the halibut dish had me expecting a cream sauce for the fish but it was unfortunately a tomato-based sauce. The pork chop was tender but I couldn't really taste any flavors in the sauce. Both dishes came with potatoes that didn't really flow with the dish, in my opinion. For dessert we shared the chocolate bread pudding. It was good but nothing compared to Chaya's croissant bread pudding. \n\nOverall, I thought the food was just ok for the price you pay.

The ambiance is fairly relaxed, though at my next visit, I will probably wear something a bit nicer.

While it got off to a stiff and awkward, it slowly got better and ended on a nice note. \n\nFrascati is a cute little neighborhood restaurant in Nob Hill.  And on a nice evening, they offer the option of sitting curb side.  It was chilly this past Saturday evening, so we sat inside.  Being such a small restaurant, spacing can be a bit cramped throughout the restaurant.  \n\nBut there is also a very nice upstairs \"loft\" dining area overlooking the main dining room.  We had a table upstairs overlooking the sidewalk next to a double-window. \n\nOur dinner reservation was made for 9:15pm, and even being a bit later, the place was still quite packed.  Service definitely got off to a very slow start, with our server took a long time take our order.  Furthermore, he wasn't very friendly and definitely rushed us throughout ordering.  \n\nHowever, when we did have questions about various items, he was quite knowledgeable.  Another small annoying side note about our server was the fact that he also had some bad-ass breath!  I was hoping he wouldn't bend down or lean in as it spoke to us.  Luckily, it only happened twice throughout the night. Haha.  \n\nAppetizers: We started off with the Artisanial Cheese Plate which consisted of 4 Cheeses ($14.00)  However, after ordering our server informed us that they were out of one of the cheeses and only had 3, so they were going to charge us $10.00 instead.  I was quite disappointed about this because of the fact that the Cheese plate was definitely quite highlighted at the top of the menu.  But we made due with the 3 cheeses instead.  \n\nThe cheeses were a great way to start dinner. bit quite small portions.  I would've liked them to compensate with larger pieces of cheese to make up for the 4 type of cheese.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=o02hEw0e299JQ9AU4THxuw\n\nWe also ordered the Roasted Eggplant-Tomato Soup with Creme Fraiche, and the Duck Confit Salad with Baby Spinach, Red Onions, Dried Cherries, Gorgonzola Cheese with a Balsamic dressing.  \n\nThe Eggplant Tomato Soup was bland and boring, I couldn't make out much of the tomato flavor in combination with the eggplant, and it also had a bad \"burnt\" taste to it.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=2gFO8g2k427P71HRvv8YoA\n\nA favorite of mine, and definitely something I'd order again is the Duck Confit Salad.  What an awesome salad to start off with, and quite unlike anything I've ever had before.  The salad wasn't chilled like normal salads, but instead, the spinach was lightly cooked and flavorful.  The duck was also perfectly cooked and crispy in certain parts.  I also love the combination of the sweet dried cherries and the gorgonzola cheese.  Everything in the salad paired together perfectly.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=ovMLhmGuyEoRygfJGoniRQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xdAgbLBQcffIxI8mYgjT1Q?select=Tlgg-eDwy_KX4mx09CwQIw \n\nFor entree's, mom ordered the Maple Leaf Duck Breast and I ordered the Pan Seared Filet Mignon.\n\nMy Filet Mignon was a bit undercooked for my preference as I ordered it Medium, but came out a bit more rare.  The overall feel of the dish didn't knock my socks off, as the demi glace sauce had a bit too much wine flavor. A side of Potato Cauliflower Gratin, and Baby Root Veggies were also provided. \n\nThe Duck Breast was was cooked to perfection and the sauce was sweet and flavorful.  Presentation-wise, but the Filet and the Duck had the same plating.  \n\nAs for dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with Almond Roca and Caramelized Bananas.  The Panna Cotta had great Vanilla Bean flavor, but texture was way too pudding-ish in my opinion.  I loved the almond roca on top and the few caramelized banana's were cooked perfectly.  \n\nWhile our server started off unfriendly and rushy, he never failed to be very attentive to our needs...i.e refilling waters and complimentary bread, and he even attempted to sing Happy Birthday to me when my dessert came out.  Very sweet of him.  Overall, I will give him the benefit of the doubt in that, after the crowds died down, he became much better and calmer.  \n\nFrascati is cute neighborhood spot with a cozy dining room.  I would recommend sitting in the loft seating area as it was a bit quieter and intimate with smaller 2 person tables, as opposed to the main dining area.  \n\nOverall of the 3 appetizers we started off with the Duck Confit Salad was my favorite.  And while entree's while flavorful, they seemed quite similar to one another.   But not bad! \n\nAn enjoyable dinner.", "author": "Cass J."}

Their service was not even up to par to begin with but what really pissed us off was their attitude when we questioned about the bill.  When I made the reservation I specifically asked the person (owner) if they'd do anything special for the birthday person and his response was \"Yes, we have a special dessert for birthday.\"  So when we finished our dinner, one of my friend asked the waiter about the birthday special and the waiter recommended the peach cobbler & chocolate bread pudding from the regular menu for the two birthday people.  My birthday friend was so happy and thanked the waiter for the desserts on the house but he didn't seem to hear him.  We finally found out why his lack of acknowledgement when we saw the check, because the desserts were on the bill!!! Since I was the one who confirmed about the special, I asked the person who brought us the bill about the charges.  I told him about what I was told when I made the reservation and he gave me a look of disgust and said \"No! WE don't give anything for birthday!\" then turned around before I could say anything!!!  That attitude there was not even it!  Another staff came by and started telling us that they never offered anything for birthday for as long as they were open and looked at me as I was lying to him, he might as well call me a liar then!!!  My friends and I love to try new places and have been to many Michelin Star restaurants and we can tell you this place is not Michelin Star level but they probably think they are and thought we were there to trick them in to giving us free desserts!  We had wanted to go to Swensen for dessert but stayed because we were told about the \"special\" dessert!  Their food was OK but with that service I certainly will never go back and highly recommended that everyone not to go.  For your well-being, DO NOT GO!!!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA day after the review I made (above) I got a voicemail from the owner.  He started off by saying that he's the one who took my reservation and remembering me mentioned about two birthday people; and he recalled that he told me that he'd make a note of that but never said that he'd buy us dessert.  He stressed again that \"we don't do that!\"  Then reluctantly he apologized for the miscommunication.  That was the first time anyone from that restaurant said an apology!!!  Yesterday they were all snooty and readily accusing us for lying!  It didn't cross their mind at all that it could be some kind of miscommunication and just apologize for that last night.  I don't know why they were so obessess about their dessert and kept thinking that we were upset because we couldn't get them free!!!  Like I said from the beginning what pissed us off was their ATTITUDE!!!  This phone call had the same ridiculous attitude; the owner did not hesitate to end the call by saying that I was being UNFAIR with my review and that's his opinion!

After finding this place on yelp and looking over the menu, we were pretty excited to spend our last night of our wedding anniversary weekend here. And they did not disappoint. I had the lamb and wife had the risotto, and we shared a great bottle of wine, two of the four cheeses on the menu, and the gnocchi starter dish. I don't think I've ever had all the dishes we ordered in one sitting melt in my mouth like each one of those did. And our server was so friendly and upbeat! They got pretty busy after we were sat, but she attended to us like nothing (not that we needed her to since we were enjoying our food and the cute place and each other's company in conversation). I can't wait to go back, hopefully with more people so they can enjoy this great place as much as we did. I now have a goal to try everything they put on their menu. \n\nONE MORE THING.. We were sat upstairs and got to watch the kitchen at work from up above. Magic I tell you!", "author": "Jeremy P."}

The ambiance is perfect for both occasions and pretty much any other occasion on the table... quintessential San Francisco meets Italian Cuisine. The seating by the windows are perfect for getting that traditional SF-flare, watching the trolleys go by while enjoying a meal. \n\nHere's what I've tried: \n\nPotato Gnocchi (3.5 stars):\nThis appetizer was very light and filled with an interesting mix of peas, tomatoes and mushrooms. I'm not sure how well the peas went the rest of the dish but it was good nonetheless. \n\nArtisanal Cheese Plate (5 stars): \nNow anyone who knows me knows that I love a good cheese plate. And this cheese plate satisfied me in every way. Perfect blend of sheep, cow and goat milk while encompassing nutty, robust, sweet, salty and other sharp flavors. Pair it with a glass of Pinot or Chardonnay and you've hit foodie galore. \n\nNettle Risotto (3.5 stars - 4 stars): \nPerfect amount of creaminess but I wish it had more of a mushroom-flavor. I prefer Isa's Truffle risotto over this one because of the overpowering flavor of the mushrooms. This one is great for those who want the sole focus to be on the cheese. The melted leeks brings in some interesting texture as well. \n\nWarm Black and White Chocolate Bread Pudding (5 stars): \nI don't even like bread puddings but the waitress recommended this as their signature dessert. And if someone picks out one dish as their signature dish, you've simply got to try it! So glad I did because it was absolutely divine! A cross between a molten chocolate cake, white chocolate pudding and some bread chunks.\n\nOne little tidbit - make reservations at least a week in advance because they tend to book up really easily! I had to make them 2 weeks in advance to ensure seating for 3.\n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Very intimate and romantic. \n\nTo start we got the mushroom bruschetta which was delicious! It was relatively simple, but everything came together so well and it might have been the highlight of the meal for me. We then split the filet mignon and the bass. The filet was fantastic and the sides were delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the bass. The portions were small and the service was pretty lackluster. I felt that our whole meal was rushed.

The place was very hot and smokey so the windows next to us were open which helped the air. \n\nThe food:  We ordered:\n\ncrab salad:  Bland and salty.  What a disappointment.  The avocado cream thing they had on the side of it helped a little with the saltiness of the dish but would definitely not order this again.\n\nBiratta and tomato jam, arugula salad:  Very good.  The tomato jam was sweet and tasted a little like sun dried tomato with sugar.  Definitely the better appetizer.\n\nMain course:\n\nHalibut:  Kind of bland, but well cooked/tender.  The sauce tasted like carrots with cream.  Came with zucchini and beans.  The zucchini was bitter, not good, and the beans was just kinda strange. It was okay/would not recommend ordering this.\n\nFlat iron steak: Very well seasoned and flavorful.

We had reservations at 8pm on a Tuesday night and it took us at least 30-40 minutes just to find parking. The staff at the restaurant recommended parking in the parking lot on Broadway and Polk, we drove around but couldn't locate the lot and eventually parked 10 minutes away. \n\nService: service was subpar. Complimentary bread was not offered until we asked for some. At least offer us some bread to keep our minds off of the terrible parking situation! We literally sat there for an hour waiting for the last person in our party to find parking. I don't remember our server's name but she was ok, nothing extraordinary. Some of the things she said could have been reworded so it's not offensive to some but it was nothing major. Lastly, there's a cake cutting fee which is absolutely ridiculous. At almost $4 per person, it can add up! \n\nFood: we ordered 3 appetizers and 4 entrees among 4 people. We ordered the russet potato gnocchi, monterey bay sardines and the cauliflower bisque as our starters. They were all delicious but if I had to recommend one, I'd say go for the gnocchi. For entrees, my friends ordered the roasted half chicken (very moist and tender), grilled pork porterhouse (good flavor) and the prawn risotto (good but can be heavy for some), while I ordered the maple leaf duck breast. I decided on the duck breast based on the recommendations here on yelp but I was disappointed. I tried all the entrees and the duck was my least favorite.

Both were cooked to perfection and the Octopus was more tender than any I have had before.  The bread pudding was also amazing.\n\nThe OK:\n\nThe porkchop was very good and tender.  The potatoes and bacon pieces on the side were delicious but the sauce it was served with was a little too sweet.  Luckily It was covering the plate and not poured over the pork chop so I just avoided.  Still it would have been nice not to have something as strong.\n\nThe service was a little rude at first but once they calmed down and realized I was a foodie they were amiable.

Although the menu signaled tired tried and true dishes, the real negative began w. the olive oil: brought to the table in an unattractive bottle with a cork for pete's sake! greasy to the touch, you have to pull out the cork (why not a pouring spout?? a bottle with handles??) and pour. I smelled before the pour and knew it was not a good oil by that alone. The taste confirmed it and it was downhill from there. Bread nothing to write home about in a city with GREAT sourdough all over the place. I ordered the cheese plate to start. When it got put down in front of me it was totally unappealing in color. The server made a point of saying that on the side here, \"are some candied apricots\"!! what a total JOKE! they were ordinary dried apricots, dry being the operative word. I could see this, I did not have to taste it but I confirmed this by taste. There were some green apple slices, (sour) the top one had some core left on it. Under that was this red stuff that was a slightly bitter jam, perhaps a tomato chutney but I could not figure it out. Some walnuts some almonds, the cheeses were ordinary and small. I left most of this dish. I ate the cheese but longed to combine it with some sweet as should have been on the plate. Then I had the duck breast salad.  Truly I could have eaten something better off the salad bar at Whole Foods. The duck was dry, chewy and old tasting, the dressing was a standard affair. There is another duck entree on the menu and I am sure they are recycling what they don't use on any one day into this insipid salad. The desert was good, the only thing of all our courses that was. My husband had the chicken and I was surprised how bland the taste was, tough, stringy and dry. He left a lot of it. The prices for the level of food here were ridiculous only adding insult to injury. Even the servers in my opinion, 'get' this. This place is just racking in the money and do not care a jot about their customers. I felt embarrassed for them and could not even look our server in the eye by the end of the meal. Plus they check went down on our table WHILE we were eating desert! What UP? there was not a big crowd waiting to get in or anything.

A low key and relatively posh neighborhood, there are some impressive fancy-ish joints.  A \"Mediterranean style bistro,\" Frascati seems to use that loose definition to serve what Yelpers would call \"American (New)\".  Perfect for those modestly sized portions of meat paired with a healthy doses of fresh vegetables and a side of class.  Worth the cab/trolly trip up the big hill if want something more sophisticated than North Beach, but not a destination place if coming from further away.\n\nRusset Potato Gnocchi: White truffle oil paired with any sort of tuber is a win in my book.  The gnocchis were soft with a slight pan sear on the outside and starchy goodness on the inside.  Liked the fresh pairing of the peas and asparagus which helps cut the heaviness.\n\nWild Mushroom Bruschetta: Fondue is a bit of an overstatement for the goat cheese on top.  It's more of a partially melted, mostly solid topping.  The crostini, goat cheese and mushrooms all tasted good individually, but were pretty mild as an aggregate.  Needs some pizazz.\n\nRoasted Half Chicken: Apparently a neighborhood favorite here.  Perfect for those who love a mish mash of flavors!  The skin is crusted with potent spices and salt.  The meat is moist and oozing aromas of herbs.  The side veggies would have been lackluster, but absorbed all the chicken drippings to have some personality.\n\nGrilled Pork Chop: Had I not just had the Food Network famous pork chop from Tee Off Bar & Grill, I might have been kinder.  Frascati said this was brined for 24 hours, but I really didn't taste much flavor seeping deep into the meat.  The sear on the outside was ok, but could have been crispier.

Well, it finally happened. The special occasion was my mother being in town from Los Angeles. \n\nThe restaurant is surprisingly big given the neighborhood how small it looks from the outside. Who knew it would have a 2nd floor for seating?\n\nThe place itself is very cozy and from walking by I could always tell I was not leaving this place without spending a serious amount of cash on dinner. \n\nI was lucky that my mother doesn't eat a lot so we shared some dishes. \n\nThe biggest hits were the halibut and the panna cotta. \n\nAs our entree the panna cotta was excellent. Whatever veggies came with it were very tasty and at the mid $20 price was not as outrageous as I thought it would be. \n\nI also tried the pear salad which I enjoyed and the gnocchi which I thought was excellent though you only get about 6 pieces of gnocchi which was disappointing. \n\nI will generalize and say that portions were consistently on the small side. Were it not for this I would probably give Frascati 5 stars. The relationship between value, quality and portion sizes is important to me. \n\nI can't say I was too thrilled about our waiter. He was definitely nice enough. Perhaps because we were speaking Spanish the whole time he felt we wouldn't understand what he was saying to us. A plus was the gorgeous Brazilian / Nicaraguan staff person who stopped by to say hello as she set the table. She was genuinely warm and friendly and my mother appreciated someone chatting with us in what I am sure she (my mom) thought was a place where nobody outside the kitchen spoke Spanish. Big props to the busboy for also chatting with us in Spanish for second and being very helpful in bringing us water and bread. I think he picked up on my mom's monolingual-ness and talked to us more than he normally would to other patrons. \n\nAll in all - I enjoyed Frascati. We shared most of our food and left with a $60 tab (drank water, no wine). \n\nI recommend it for a lively date place. It's right on Hyde street so you can cable car there or take the 45 Union. It's a cute neighborhood with plenty of trees and spots to visit afterward for a post-dinner drink. \n\nPS: DO NOT DRIVE HERE. PARKING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. \n\nOkay, that was my parking PSA.", "author": "Carlos A."}

We arrived at 6:30pm on a Monday with only 3 tables seated.  Within 30 minutes the entire restaurant was full.\n\nWe began with wine by the glass and a cheese board.  The cheese board featured 4 cheeses, each paired with honey, nuts, apple, etc.  Each pairing was genius and created a combination better than the sum of the parts.\n\nBetween the 3 of us, we had a Sangiovese, Cabernet, and Zinfindel by the glass.  I found all 3 to be really average.  I would personally reccommend bringing a bottle from home and eating the corkage fee.  Additionally their wine menu seems to center around $40-$50 bottles, with the next step up being $100.  I'd like to see more options at more pricepoints.\n\nFor our second course, I had the bread salad and mushroom soup.  The bread salad was surprisingly tasty, but could have been a smaller portion.  The mushroom soup had a great mushroom flavor, but could have used a second dimension (truffles, etc.).\n\nFor the third course I had the gnocchi which was homemade in a beautifully naughty butter sauce.  My wife had the sweet corn risotto.  Both were total homeruns!  The cheese plates and the entrees are what made this so special.\n\nNow for service, I am disappointed.  We put in the reservation that it was my birthday.  My mother-in-law also mentioned it to the waitress while I was in the bathroom - and they didn't even say happy birthday.  Kind of lame.  I am a grown man, but it would have been nice for at least some recognition - after all we dropped well over $200 on the tab.  \n\nFood - 5/5\nAmbiance - 4/5\nService - 4/5 (I will give them the benefit of the doubt)\nValue - 3.5/5", "author": "Brian K."}

We shared the foie gras, the octopus salad, the duck confit salad, and the carrot bisque.  The foie gras was good, but can you really mess that up?  The octopus salad was just ok in my opinion, but take that with a grain of salt too since I don't care for seafood.  The duck confit was a little too overwhelming with the blue cheese and the cherries and the spinach, and the duck.  Good, but a little too much.\n\nI ordered the duck breast and it was cooked perfectly.  It came with spaetzle, which was a little too much and just kind of overtook the plate.  Maybe cut down on the spaetzle a little bit guys?  Just a teeny tiny bit?  My friend also felt the same, as he ordered the same dish. The boyfriend ordered the risotto...it was good, but nothing amazing, and our other friend ordered the pork and she seemed to enjoy it as well.  I also disagreed with the wine pairing that was given to me.  I had said I like spicy, and wanted a pinot to go with my duck...I've had fabulous luck in the past with such pairings.  The waiter insisted that I go with the zin instead.  It was lacking and I was not impressed and wished that I hadn't let him pick my wine for me.  Blah.\n\nDessert consisted of the sorbet and bread pudding.  We were given extra dessert because the waiter forgot to bring out a side we had ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-18", "description": "I'll break this into two reviews that I can sum up as follows:  Food: very good, Service: Not so much\n\nFirst, the service:  We had an early reservation at 5:45.  I understand that restaurants have a limited number of seats and need to turn their tables, but our waitress was just rude.  She was smarmy and bordered on annoying.  (long dark hair, older and dark thick black glasses).  We no sooner glanced at the menu, when she came over to take our orders.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt and hoped she was just being friendly.  3 minutes later the same thing.  When we finally are ready, she is obnoxious.  I ask her to tell me more about a dish and instead of describing it she looks at me and says \"what do you want to know?\"  I want to know what it tastes like!  That's why I asked.  You work here, and part of your job is to help me enjoy my visit by answering any questions I may have.  That's how you earn tips.  \n\nThe first course was served while my wife was in the bathroom; no-good.  The main came about 3 minutes after they cleared the plates from the first course.  We no sooner finished our mains than she was hocking us about our desert order.  The spoon hit the table and our check was in front of us.  I've never had a server do such a great job at ruining a meal with her terrible attitude and desire to kick us out the door.  1 star for service\n\nSecond, the food:  The wife started with a fig appetizer that was outstanding - baked figs stuffed with maytag bleu cheese, served w/ prosciutto balsamic glaze over bread.  This was a well thought out dish that was perfectly executed.  I had the foie gras torchon--another solid A+.  Main courses were also quite good.  I had duck served over spaetzle; the duck was cooked to perfection, and the setup was great.  The wife doesn't usually like duck that much and loved it.  She had a branzino that was good, but not my favorite.  It wasn't bad, but something in their tasted a little odd.  She didn't love it either.  For dessert we had chocolate bread pudding w vanilla ice  cream.  I'm not sure if it was bread pudding or just warm chocolate cake, but it was divine.  All in all, I'd give the food a solid 4 stars, maybe even 4.5.  \n\nDear Frescati:  Keep the chef, replace the waitress.", "author": "Chad K."}

There are only so many weekends, and going out to a nice dinner is my favorite way to spend a Saturday night.\n\nThat being said, I rarely leave my own reviews, but am offering nothing but honesty with this one because it had to be said.  So, if you are like me, reading this review and deciding where to dine:  Choose somewhere other than Frascati.\n\nIs it an intimate and cozy setting?  Yes.  Is the food good?  Yes.  HOWEVER ... bad service can ruin your meal.\n\nMy husband and I had TERRIBLE service at Frascati last night during our dinner.  We were rushed, treated as though we were not welcome and then essentially ignored by our waitress.  We are polite, clean, nice people, who had spent $100 on wine and appetizers within the first five minutes of sitting down.  But because it was a Saturday night our waitress wanted us to order everything else at once, or not at all, and we weren't sure what we wanted for our entrees yet, so just wanted to eat another appetizer while deciding.  Apparently, not allowed.  There were open tables and it didn't look that busy.  While this doesn't seem like a big deal, it was shocking to be told what you MUST do by a waitress while dining out.  She sent someone else over to our table who tried to rush us along as well.  When we asked for the manager, he was just the same -- dismissive and rushed, saying the kitchen prefers complete orders only.  Because of this, we decided to ask for our check and leave before getting entrees.  Who wants to sit at a restaurant where you are made to feel unwelcome, which is apparently a policy confirmed by management.  \n\nWith thousands of places to eat in San Francisco, and many good options within the Russian Hill neighborhood, don't waste a night on a place where people have reported bad service because it could happen to you.", "author": "Ashley P."}

I would definitely recommend Frascati to couples celebrating a birthday or anniversary. \n\nFor our appetizer we had the Russet Potato Gnocchi, which was so good we used all of our bread to mop up the leftover sauce from the dish. For my entree I had the Half Roasted Chicken, which was absolutely perfect. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was flavorful, but not heavy. My mom had the Pork chop, which had to be sent back because it was quite raw in the center. Regardless, when the dish was brought back it was delicious and we ate every bite. \n\nI would go back to Frascati for a romantic evening with a special person.", "author": "Leah P."}

The cable car stops right there which makes a great start on the SanFrancisco experience and ambience. We had the best service during the whole night. The cheese platter had Epoisses on it, my favorite cheese in the world, so I had to order it. The Sardines were not great so my husband was at first disappointed. But then the main course came and the Maple Leaf Duck Breast was incredible and so was the Pan Seared Bass they had that day. We found a very good bottle of wine as well.

While the pork chop was decent (though under cooked) the putanesca was horrendous. The sauce tasted like it had come out of a can and the pasta was overdone.

It's horrendous trying to look for parking around the area. My friend booked this place, so we came. We got seated upstairs in the corner right where you come up the stairs. Sitting up there sort of reminded me of ron weasley's house. I was ready to bolt if I heard something squeak. Of course it didn't.\n\nI started off with the figs wrapped with prosciutto. It wasn't as ripe as I thought it would be biting into it. It didn't give off that sweetness. I also got to taste the gnocchi with mushrooms, which was pretty tasty. Pretty salty. Next round included pork chops, duck breast, and roasted chicken. As everyone has said, the pork chops is pretty good. I could tell it's been in a brine ... a bit salty. The duck and chicken were cooked really well, but also pretty salty. The meat was tender and juicy though.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

I'm happy to say it was the best meal I've had in the two years since I moved to SF.  I'm a big fan of tuna tartare and it was delicious here.  The serrano chilis were a perfect touch.   For a main, I ordered some type of skillet steak dish served over an heirloom salad.  It was amazing and I was blown away.  I had to force myself to slow down and enjoy it.  I tried the duck and pork chop too and both were excellent.\n\nWe had to try to bread pudding too.  It was very good, but I was expecting a little better after reading the reviews here.

Called Saturday around 3pm and easily booked a reservation for that night.  Were immediately seated by a very friendly gentleman upon our arrival, and were invited to choose upstairs or downstairs for our table for three.  We chose upstairs, which was very cozy and quiet. Frascati's overall ambiance is romantic and relaxed, with dim lighting and close tables. Nothing to go crazy for, but definitely pleasant and comfortable. \n\nBUT THE FOOD! I honestly cannot remember the last time I had this good of a meal. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive, and provided some helpful advice that led us to order the mushroom bruschetta, two orders of the pork chop, a swordfish, a side of brussels sprouts, and to top it off a vanilla bean panna cotta with carmel and bananas. INCREDIBLE! Everything just kept getting better and better (hence my eventual food coma). The mushroom bruschetta was great, overloaded with toppings including goat cheese and pancetta, but not too messy. It did only come with two pieces though, so I would recommend to share between two people, cutting them for three was a little awkward. The side of brussels sprouts was a great twist on the vegetable--an addition of capers gave it a little something special. I don't like fish so I didn't get to personally try the swordfish (though my Dad loved it) but hands down the best pork chop I've had in my life, or at least since I can remember.  The sauce made it absolutely mouthwatering, and the side yukon gold potatoes with bacon vinaigrette provided the perfect complement. I couldn't take a bite without talking about how great it was! The other items on the menu also sounded great, but I really don't think I could ever order any other entree after experiencing this pork chop! The night was complete with the most delicious dessert- a perfectly sized panna cotta with a side drizzle of carmel and sliced bananas. Again, just amazing! They even brought it out with a candle since it was my birthday!\n\nI could not have left this place happier, or more stuffed full of deliciousness, and would hands down recommend this restaurant for any occasion.", "author": "Julia P."}

Simply put...I do this because Frascati was VERY serious with me.\n\nFirst, as per usual for me, the wine list. Stunning, though not massive, selection of wines. From their California highlights...to the REAL deal French reds, this is a wine list perfectly suited to the simple and elegant fare on offer here.\n\nOn my first visit, we chose a lovely '06 Cotes du Rhone from the famed producers of legendary Chateauneuf offerings, Rayas. Perfect.\n\nPerfect with what?\n\nStarters: heirloom tomatoes with burrata (simple, perfectly plated, beautiful to see), beef carpaccio (nice size with the most amazingly appropriate crunch capers).\n\nThe bottle lasted (somehow...) through the main course...and both of us chose the roasted chicken. Heavenly (and simply) served with potatoes and a bit of spinach. Grabbed a side of perfectly charred brussel sprouts...and all was right with the world.\n\nThe ambiance is as simple (and perfect) as the food. It didn't help that my companion was brilliant and drove great conversation...next, I'll head back to see if a silent two hours adds or takes away from the amazingly straight-forward and perfectly prepared food at Frascati.\n\nBe prepared for a little sticker shock...and if you aren't ready to pay for this level of perfection...then don't seek it.", "author": "Bo S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-03", "description": "Let me tell you about this little restaurant, Frascati. \nYou barely squeeze your way through this tiny, congested doorway as parties are trying to exit at the same time. It is jam packed, dim, and fairly loud for such a tiny place; a fire hazard for sure. You can't even focus on what you're doing as you're trying to take in everything that's going on around you all at once. Then, suddenly, in slow motion all the noise and bustling of people dissipate as a PHAT, fully loaded, grilled pork chop passes right in front of you, trailing behind it's sweet succulent aroma of red meat with a hint of apple and bacon. Just from the smell alone you can tell how juicy and tender the chop is. As you warp back to reality all that's on your mind is pork chop, pork chop, pork chop.\n\nGood thing we had reservations because we got seated fairly quickly. To start, we had the veal carpaccio. Words cannot describe how melt in your mouth, finger licking, delicious this appetizer was. For being my first time having carpaccio, I am fairly certain this place has destroyed my chances of enjoying any other carpaccio dish elsewhere. It has spoiled my taste buds forever.\n\nFor my main dish, I obviously had the grilled pork chop, and of course it was the best I ever had. Surpassed my expectations with flying colors. So good there is no such thing as hyping it up. My friend had the fresh fettuccini with shrimp, clams, mussels, and calamari in an amazing basil pesto and citrus gremolata. I had a couple bites and it was to die for. Secretly I wanted to steal it and eat it all, but some how managed to keep my composure and control myself. Had to be dainty and lady like, you know? This was a nice restaurant!\n\nAfter all that and a nice bottle of Malbec, we had no room for dessert. Everybody there was kind and helpful. Even with the place so unbelievably busy, the service was excellent. They knew when to come to our aid and when to give us some space. ..Or maybe I was a bit too tipsy to even have cared o.O\n\nI will forever rave about this place and plan on coming again and again (well maybe not too often since it is quite expensive). I love it!!", "author": "Jeanne K."}

We had heard great things from friends who also live in the area, and we knew we needed to try it since we're moving soon and wanted to determine whether it's worth the trip. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think we'll be back. We had a reservation for four on a Friday, and the table they gave us was next to the stairs and close to the bathrooms - which I could smell during the entire meal! Not bad bathroom smell, but bathroom smell nonetheless. It was very uncomfortable.\n\nWhile the food was decent (we had two orders of the chicken, and two orders of the fish dish, as well as some uneventful appetizers), the service put a real damper on things. First we waited a good fifteen minutes for someone to even take our drink order. After waiting another ten minutes, only half the drinks arrived. We still hadn't had a chance to ask questions about the menu, and had no bread or butter to pick at.\n\nThe waitress may have been overextended that night, but she gave us really icky attitude - sort of a cross between passive-aggressive and phony niceness. We felt rushed, ignored, and frustrated until the entrees arrived (we were entertaining guests from England). The meal was very expensive, mainly because of the alcohol (total of five glasses, plus one beer).\n\nDespite the horrible service (which was really, really horrible), the food was ok, so I would recommend this place perhaps on a weeknight, if no other place is available, and you make sure not to sit near the bathroom.", "author": "Cynthia S."}

I selected this place because it was so highly reviewed on yelp.\n\nThe food was AMAZING.  We had almost all of the starters but the ones I liked most were the fig bruschetta dish (don't remember exactly what it was called) and the burrata caprese (although, I've never met a burrata I didn't like).  Oh, wait, I can't forget the cheese plate.  I've eaten many cheese plates but this one introduced me to new pairings - I was impressed.\n\nThe entrees were just as delicious.  We ordered the duck, the chicken, the flat iron steak and the pork sugo pasta.  They were all super delicious but the two that stand out were the roasted chicken (which was SO tender and flavorful) and the pasta, which I asked for HOT (and was pleasantly surprised to find it so).  The pork sugo was just as tender and plentiful as the half chicken dish and was complemented with fresh pasta ribbons.  The fresh pasta was nice, but I'd have eaten the pork on toast.  haha!\n\nWe brought our own dessert (as it was my birthday) so I can't say anything about their sweets.  I'm sure they're just as mouthwatering as the rest of their menu, though.\n\nI DID NOT GIVE THEM 5 STARS because they sat us in the loft, directly above the kitchen/stove.  The restaurant is basically a house converted into a restaurant, which is fine if you're seated on the bottom level (or maybe even in the upstairs back room).  Our table was NOT and so within a half hour of our arrival, we were all developing a nice shiny glow to our skin (mostly apparent in our reddening faces).  We took our time with our food and were probably there for 3 hours (maybe 3.5 hrs).  By the end of the evening, we had sweated out of our clothes and smelled like we had dined in a fish & chips joint - no shit.

Well I'm so happy we found Frascati on yelp :)\n\nMaybe I'm biased because we got to reunited with old friends- but this was my favorite part of our whole trip. Tucked away in the Russian Hilll this restaurant was nothing but charm. We had the most wonderful dinner with our friends. Our table was in my opinion, the best in the house- tucked into the window nook with a great view of the trolley coming up and down the hill. We were informed that Jennifer Aniston once ate in that exact spot. not that this is really important to me- but good to know?\n\nOur waitress was friendly and helpful in picking dishes- you got the impression that she has eaten everything on the menu- which i think is important. She also was helpful in selecting wines to match our dishes. By the way, the wines by the glass selection was great! The food was simple yet delicious, well executed dishes.

Strung with pretty lights, there a few tables are located outside and are up against the resturaunts large window front so you can peak inside while still enjoying the fresh air. The place is small, i guess it was originally house so it almost feels like you are eating at your own home but with cute tables and great ambiance. \n\nWe were seated upstairs right next to a large window that overlooked the streets. I am so glad that we sat near the window because it was SO HOT upstairs. The upstairs section is located right above the kitchen so it got extremely warm.\n\nFood: We ordered a bottle of red Lambrusco which was delicious and was a great price.

Cute little restaurant with a really cozy atmosphere-not too prestigious. Great wine selections. Our server Gabby was really awesome and an asset to the restaurant. We started off with the cheese plate. I'm celiac so that means super allergic to anything containing wheat/ barley. Asked if they had any gluten free bread or crackers. They didn't but I asked for extra apple slices and they were glad to accommodate and Gabby also made a note on our order so the kitchen knew of my allergy. The cheese plate was a generous size with some dried apricots and figs and almonds and honey too. Really delicious. Next we split the butter lettuce salad but subbed vinaigrette for the creamy dressing that normally comes on it. So good! For our main course I got the filet mignon and my bf got the pork chop. My steak was cooked perfectly and everything was served piping hot. Both dishes were generous portions, packed with flavor and delicious. The prices in general were really reasonable for the city. Gabby brought out some house made ice cream with a candle for my bday. The ice cream was some of the best I've ever had, no joke. Shoutout to our server Gabby and Frascati for giving us such a wonderful experience. We will definitely be recommending the place to our friends and we will be back!", "author": "Lil M."}

Duck salad not as delicious but good. Burrata appetizer delcious. Mushroom bruscetta was yummy in a made at home kind of way - but it is bruscetta so that's expected.\nNote to non meat eaters - there are meat products in a number of things that at a glance appear meat free so if you are concerned read closely and ask.\nLots of different dishes at the table all general quite good and sufficient quantity.\nSadly they were out of panna cotta. Wah!\nNow - about parking - it is horrible so leave 30 minutes and hope if you are coming on any evening.

Such was my experience at Frascati.  \n\nOn an ordinary Sunday evening, I began surfing the web for restaurants to try on a whim.  I stumbled across Frascati, which sounded interesting, so I thought, why not give it a try?  After all, it was a beautiful evening in the city, and I decided that I might as well make the most of it before diving into a new work week.  Little did I know I was about to discover one of my favorite restaurants.\n\nFrascati is located in Russian Hill in a quaint and picturesque neighborhood, which merely adds to its charm.  The inside of the restaurant is small and warm, and has two levels for seating.  I was fortunate to be seated on the top level near the railing, giving us a view of the restaurant below and the street outside, where a traditional San Francisco trolley would occasionally roll down the street.\n\nShortly after being seated, our waiter stopped by our table I asked for suggestions on a glass of wine to start.  I was looking for a buttery Chardonnay, and the waiter recommended what turned out to be an excellent, creamy, buttery, and smooth glass of wine.  The dinner was off to a good start.  Next I had the Grilled Bread Salad.  The salad was large, full of fresh ingredients, delicious feta cheese, and was covered in a delicate champagne vinaigrette.  For my main dish I ordered the rack of lamb and I think that this is the best rack of lamb that I have ever had.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly (and was also nicely complemented by my second glass of wine, again recommended by the waiter).  Finally, for dessert I had the bread pudding.  And this was one of the best bread puddings that I have ever had - so warm, buttery and comforting...I wish that I was eating it right now.\n\nSo while not every impulsive decision is rewarding, this one was, and I highly recommend Frascati.\n\nDisclaimer:  This review is based on my experience at Frascati about 18 months ago.  I presume that the quality has not changed.", "author": "David S."}

Now, I know the description says it's not good for groups, but we wanted our families there. I made reservations 2 weeks before and it was the Golden Gate's 75th Anniversary date, so I expected it to be difficult for them to accommodate a GROUP OF EIGHTEEN PEOPLE!!!! But they did it NO PROBLEM. They didn't give us attitude, they sat us promptly, they had everything ready, and made the night really special. The ambiance is intimate and small. It's classy and upscale. The server was very attentive and had excellent manners. This is a classic SF restaurant in a classic SF neighborhood. We took a cab up to the restaurant, it is extremely difficult to find parking though, and it is almost impossible to walk to it because of the steep roads. The cable car rides right past the Restaurant too. I will say though that their bathroom is extremely small, beware all who are claustrophobic! But all in all great place.\n\n I had the duck and the cheese platter and they were to die for! They were beautifully presented and had nice garnashings.

This is a top ten in San Francisco place.\n\nThe food is excellent.  Certain perennial menu favorites rightfully endure and yet there's always something fresh as well.  Service is among the very best in the city, polite, efficient, unobtrusive and knowledgeable.  The portions are not 'american' huge and are beautifully presented but not three dimensional food which has to be disassembled to be eaten pretentious.  The place is a bit loud when crowded, but I'm more noise sensitive than most.  At it most crowded its never too loud to carry on a conversation.  It is also an absolutely beautiful, aesthetic, charming little neighborhood restaurant.  They do not cater to the tourist trade.  This is a locals only place.\n\nThis is one of those places that I only rarely told anyone about for years.   Its, that, good.\n\nIf you're not a drinker, two people can get out of here for $50-$60.  The wine list is compact, diverse, and if you know some of the local wines, there are, or at least used to be, some genuine bargains.\n\nYou can, and I have brought out-of-towners here via a cable car, which runs right in front of the place on Hyde, and hop off twenty feet from the front door.   It makes for a very memorable San Francisco experience, particularly on a foggy night.  Even if you cab it, highly advisable, whoever you bring here will remember the place.  Its right on Hyde in Russian Hill proper.  Parking, even by San Francisco standards is in a word, a nightmare.\n\nMy mother, the foodie still talks about this place, not Gary Danko, not La Folie, not Massa's, this place and Boulevard is what she talks about.

This was one of the best salads I've had.\n\nMaple Leaf Duck Breast with Herb Spaetzle, Hearts of Palm Salad, Wild Arugula, Scallions and Huckleberry Sauce - the duck was a bit overcooked, but the herb spaetzle was to die for.  Terrific sauce and combination of flavors.  If the duck were cooked better, it would have been outstanding.\n\nI also ordered the halibut, but I can't remember everything in the dish and it wasn't listed on their website.  I remember it was supposed to have parsnip puree.  This dish was definitely lacking and bland.  I cook halibut at home and there's a lot of potential with this fish - unfortunately, they didn't deliver.  Hopefully they'll mix up this recipe and swap it for something else.\n\nWe ordered the chocolate bread pudding b/c we heard so much fuss about it.  It was just ok and we didn't flip over it.  Maybe it was b/c there was coconut in it and neither of us are coconut fans.

I also had the misfortune of not being part of the SF wealthy elite.... So I didn't get to eat here as often as I would have liked (um - every day).  That is not to say that it is extremely expensive, but for my budget it was a 'special occasion' restaurant.  In our last several years in the City, my wife and I would go here for almost all of our celebratory meals, raises, promotions, anniversaries, holidays, Thursdays...  Occasionally we would be overcome with a need to try one of the many other places the City had to offer... sure enough - next occasion... back to Frascati!!\n\nI ate here many, many times over the years and never had a bad meal.  In fact it was almost always a perfect dining experience.  Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, courteous staff.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Fantastic food.\n\nFrascati is located on Russian Hill along a very quaint stretch of Hyde Street, with the cable car running by... it is a cozy place that is relaxed, but also elegant.  Great for date night or dinner with friends or family.  There is also a nice loft area upstairs that offers additional seating from the main floor dining area, and overlooks the main cooking area.  One of the two tables in the front windows is a great place to sit if you can manage to get one.\n\nThe staff makes you feel welcome from the moment you call to make a reservation.  (This is a place that actually calls you back if you leave a message during the day to make a reservation.)  Once you arrive, the excellent service continues throughout your evening.  They are very attentive without hovering.  There have been times where we had three or four different individuals stop by the table just to make sure everything was OK, and see how we were enjoying everything.  The waiters are very knowledgeable when asked about various items on the menu, and also very adept at recommending quality wines (not just the most expensive) from their wine list.  We often would take our own bottle of wine, and we never received the attitude that you sometimes get when bringing your own bottle.  They were happy to open and often decant our wine for us.\n\nThe food... Well, I don't have the time or the writing expertise to properly relay how glorious the food is.  You've seen several reviews mentioning the gnocchi... they are not to be missed!  Everything here is fabulous!  Typical meal:  Appetizer, salad, entr\u00e9e, and finish with the cheese course... Unfortunately, this usually means we are too stuffed to try the desserts - but on the occasions where I've managed... they have also been great.\n\nRisotto, Pork Chops, and Duck Breast - Oh my!

Mochi loved his black cod crusted with almond main, and I was raving within my first bite into the delicious pork chop. It was pretty much the best pork chop I've had in the last few years. (First runner-up: Clinton St. Bakery's [NYC] ain't got nothing on this chop!!)\n\nFor dessert, the apple cobber with vanilla bean ice cream really, I mean REALLY hit the spot and ended the meal with a nice sweet finish. A warm, crispy, crusty, crunchy, mildly toasted bread crumb top, with a gooey apple-filled interior - paired with the cold refreshing taste of vanilla.

It was actually really fun to people watch from here. We tried the burrata toast, and the gnocchi for appetizers, and ordered a bottle of rose'. All super.

The skin is cripy and the meat is perfectly moist. I wish I would of saved room for dessert but between half a chicken and the gourmet appetizers I was STUFFED. If you're looking for a fancy neighborhood restaurant with incredible food, and you haven't tried this place yet, just do it already. You won't regret it. Oh yeah I forgot to mention, the service was great. My hubby and I were really impressed how each staff members takes on different roles depending on the situation. If the food runner brings out your entrees, but notices you are out of water, then they will go refill your glasses. If the host/hostess steps out for a minute and notices you have dropped your fork, they'll go in and get you a new one.

It was my sister's 30th birthday, and unlike our adventures to dive brunch spots in the 'loin (http://www.yelp.com/biz/munch-haven-san-francisco#hrid:B3P4yLnEaqlM4LykoNPHAw), this called for something a little more upscale. Long on our shared list (great minds think alike), Frascati it was.\n\nYou enter into a bustling and warm atmosphere, and the sound of cable cars rolling by adds to the ambiance. Service was prompt and knowledgeable, though the tone seemed a bit scripted.\n\nStarters featured a very good fruit bruschetta (the peaches were divine), and a not as good watermelon salad (you are paying way too much for just a few slices of watermelon). For mains I was very impressed with sis' pork tenderloin, she offered a bite, I could have had five. Good but not as great was my half chicken. Too much skin, not enough artichoke and spinach complements. The chicken itself was great, but you are paying for the whole package.\n\nOur close, a blackberry sorbet, was amazing.\n\nOverall, not bad, though I've been more impressed elsewhere for less money. Frascati was missing that signature - in design, in food or in service - to warrant a fourth star.", "author": "Jason B."}

I had never heard of the place so I was a bit skeptical when his surprise led us to Frascati -- but i loved it. Good job bb!!\n\nDecor, etc, is fairly nice but food is definitely what sets Frascati apart from the 1000's other great places in SF.\n\nWe ordered:\n--Cheese Plate ($14) -- 3 types of cheeses, paired with an assortment of fresh and preserved fruits and nuts.  Great to snack on as you start on the wine.  Side note: Great wine selection here too.\n--Grilled Flat Iron Steak ($27) -- So well marinated. Super garlicy -- a bit too salty, but meat is tender and cooked perfectly.  The polenta is gooey and creamy.  \n-- Branzino (~$26) -- European seabss, seared 'til the filet has the perfect crispy crust. Fish very flavorful and tastes of the ocean -- which I'm usually not a fan of...I usually prefer a buttery Chilean bass, but boy, this was superb.  Bed of wild mushrooms made the perfect compliment.\n--Chocolate Bread Pudding ($8) -- More molten chocolate cake than bread pudding -- but i have no complaints.

Nothing really appealed to me on their menu, so I asked about having the gnocchi for an entree instead of an appetizer. They said they would go ahead and double the order for me. I got 20 undercooked gnocchi delivered to me in a mediocre, kinda flavorless sauce. Definitely not what I was expecting when most pasta dished are usually quite large and plentiful.\n\nMy husband's mushroom risotto was just OK. It was very creamy and way heavy. I don't know how you could finish a whole bowl of it.\n\nThe one good part was the artesianal cheese plate, which I would recommend. There were 4 different kinds of cheese with smaller items to complement the cheeses, such as figs and a sort of cranberry compote. It was tasty, but in my opinion, a bit overpriced for what you got.\n\nWe didn't have dessert, so I can't speak on that, but I had heard they were good.

Wild California Salmon (it was a little undercooked, but good flavor)\n5.

The gnocchi was seared after it was cooked, giving it a wonderful taste and the combination of brown butter, favas, and asparagus was so nice.  Great texture and flavor. Others in our party had the burrata, stone fruit bruschetta, and balsamic fig bruschetta. All were very good (especially the burrata) but the gnocchi was the best. \nMy entree was the roasted chicken, served with fingerling potatoes, artichokes, and baby onions.

Others had the fresh tagliatelle (excellent fresh sauce and good bite with the sausage), pan seared bass (it was better than decent, but nothing super special), and grilled pork chop (tasty, but my friend remarked \"it used to be much bigger\").

It is located at the corner of Hyde/Green in the Russian Hill area.  There are several other restaurants in the area.  Parking is very difficult and we were lucky to find parking a couple of blocks away.  The cable car runs right by the restaurant.\n\nWe got there at 5:30 and had a nice table by the wall.  It is a small place serving Mediterranean style meals.  Apparently the menus change every week.  We started off with some salads -  a roasted pear salad with acorn squash, butter lettuce, goat cheese, spiced pecans and creamy tarragon vinaigrette ($10).  It was well presented and very tasty.  The dressing was flavorful without being overpowering.  The other salad was a duck confit salad with baby spinach, red onions, dried cherries, gorgonzola cheese and a light balsamic dressing ($11).  It was also very well presented, tasty, and not overpowering.  \n\nFrench bread was provided along with a glassware of olive oil for dipping the bread.  The olive oil had a pleasant flavor and it might have been lemon. \n\nFor our entree, we chose a side of spaghetti squash, seafood fettucine, and a seabass plate.  The prices of the entrees were in the mid $20s.  I can't remember what the items were officially called as I don't have a copy of their menu that week.  My fettucine had mussels, clams, shrimp, drenched in a creamy chopped basil sauce similar to a pesto sauce.  The only downside might be that it was too salty and may have been due to the mussels and clams.  Other than that it was delicious.\n\nThe seabass plate was a fillet that was browned and laying on a bed of assorted mushrooms.  The plate was very well presented and was scrumptous. The spaghetti squash looked liked spaghetti and it was my first time eating it.  I liked it. \n\nAfterwards they brought out a scoop of their homemade coconut sorbet with a little candle on it.  Like everything else in the place, the dessert was excellent.\n\nFor special occasions, this is a great place to go and we plan on coming back again.", "author": "Robert J."}

I absolutely love the food here and there is usually little to critique.  This is the reason why my SO and I return time after time (four, so far).  Here's where they lost me on our last visit (last night):\n\n- made reservations with a special request to be seated by the window.  I've made this request on a separate occasion as well.  It feels that both times, they've failed to acknowledge my request.  Each time we walk in, they have a table ready for us somewhere in the middle of the restaurant.  It's not until I mention that it was noted on the reservation that a table by the window is preferred, that they give us other options.  On neither occasion did they apologize or even acknowledge that they were not able to fill our request.  It was like this request was lost and the host had not even seen this noted on the reservation.\n\n- the ambiance has drastically changed.  There used to be a romantic feel to this place.  It was dimly lit and gave off the mood of dinner by candlelight.  This is no longer the case.  It has lost it's flare with its lighting and is sterile in comparison.\n\n- now to the closet sized bathroom that I mentioned in my last review.  I had said that it was small with little wiggle room.  You figure with a space that tiny the bathroom will be immaculate.  This was not the case, at least not when I went in.  Maybe it was because my visit was at the end of the night when everything was winding down.  But this should be no excuse.\n\nBut I must say, in other cases, all these offenses would be stacked against the restaurant.  In this case, I give them a little leeway since their food is a dream.  I am absolutely in love with the maple leaf duck.  The waitress we had last night was amazing.  She had a number of wine suggestions to go with our meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-16", "description": "To surmise, Frascati is simply an excellent establishment and offers a top notch dinning experience. I had never been there before, yet I chose it for a special family outing and none of us were disappointed. On the contrary, we all had fantastic meals. My mom, dad, sister and I all ordered different starters, and all were delicious. I veered away from having a salad (as I already have one every day) and instead chose a comforting and flavorful tomato, eggplant soup, something which I thought was very much elevated by the subtle presence of the latter ingredient. I enjoyed it very much, yet my sister was totally enamored by the prosciutto and figs with bleu cheese; she said the preparation of the figs and the balsamic syrup-glaze that came with them was perfect,  and to me it looked as though she had never tasted anything better. \nFor my entr\u00e9e I had the pork chop, and I could not have been more satisfied with the dish. Occasionally pork chops can be finicky and at times it is difficult to cook them until they are just right, yet here it has been perfected. It was tender, moist, flavorful, and I have never tasted one which was better prepared. It came with a wonderfully complex compote on top and more sauce below, and it was simply fantastic. Polenta was served with is as well, and it too was delicious, but it's true purpose was to enhance the meat, a job it did excellently. It was the kind of dish which makes going to restaurants such fun; it's something that you just can't really have at home even if you are a very experienced cook (I asked the chef what the secret was to the pork chop, and he explained that brining it a day in advance does the trick. That is something I will definitely be trying).\nTo finish the meal I had a white and dark chocolate breading pudding with walnuts, caramel sauce, and hazel nut ice cream. It was out of this world. In addition, there is plenty to share, and it might even be a bit much for two people (even in my family of four I ended up eating almost two thirds of it. It was soooo good though).\nHowever, what is so important to me in determining the quality of a restaurant is not only the food, but the overall atmosphere. To me, an excellent environment is an ingredient which can't go un added in a truly great dinning out experience. In the case of Frascati, I'm glad to say it's a very pleasant place to be in. It has a great tucked away location and just getting there is very nice. The restaurant itself is a very intimate space with low, yet warm lighting and an open kitchen which is very much a part of the dinning area. The close tables combined with all the people create and  but pleasing din, and the multiple rooms and layers make for a cozy feel. The very small but well decorated restroom is accessed by going down a peculiar set of stairs beside the kitchen, and although it sounds strange using the facilities is a pleasant experience. The close quarters, bustling people, and charming d\u00e9cor really makes a person feel as though they are part of the restaurant when inside, and that is a feeling I truly enjoyed.\nFrascati is well serviced and the pricing is truly very reasonable for such high quality food; I don't remember seeing an entr\u00e9e over thirty dollars. Although there is no bar, if you're looking for a great dinner to remember, I highly recommend you try it here.

We were not disappointed! The food was excellent, and the ambiance was warm and unpretentious. The service was very quick and attentive. \nWe had:\n- Steak tartare - delicious, well seasoned. \n- Duck confit salad - highly recommend! One of the best bites of the night: sweet and tart dried cherries with perfectly crispy duck.\n- Filet mignon - meat was perfectly cooked, the side (root veg hash) was nothing sensational.\n- Roasted half chicken - highly recommend! This was totally the dark horse of the meal. I don't usually order chicken when I'm out (doesn't seem fancy enough?), but I'm so glad I did. This was the best chicken I've ever had. Super juicy, super crispy, with a nice bright sauce/jus. People of yelp, other things on the menu may sound more exotic and difficult to prepare, but get this chicken. It is so good. \n- Black and white chocolate bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream - the ice cream was good, nice chunks of hazelnut; the bread pudding was not too sweet.", "author": "jane c."}

Greeted nicely by the host who led us upstairs.  Our waitress Angela was amazing!!!  She really made our night that much better - great personality, advice, and just genuine warmth and friendliness.   Angela, you ROCK.\n\nAPPS:  We started with the grilled pear salad....little gems (of grilled pear), grilled acorn squash, dried cranberries, goat cheese, spiced pecans, all drizzled in a mouthwatering tarragon vinaigrette.  We loved it so much we ordered another after we pretty much licked our first plate clean in a matter of 2 minutes.\n\nENTREES:  My boyfriend ordered the pork chop and O.M.G....heaven on a plate!  The chop was grilled to perfection and the flavors were exceptional.  He had the winning dish for sure!  I ordered the filet mignon, which was great quality, but lacking a bit of flavor as compared to the pork chop.  Great veggies and potatoes served on the side.  But don't mess around, seriously...just GET THE FREAKIN PORK CHOP!!!\n\nDESSERT:  The chocolate bread pudding is amazing, we have had it before, but this time we were pretty full after inhaling our food.  Of course I have a sweet tooth, so I still wanted to order dessert regardless of being so full.  But the bf isn't much of a dessert guy, and I couldn't do it alone, so we (sadly) told Angela we would pass.  Of course, minutes later, Angela brings us a scoop of their homemade (and delicious obviously) chocolate ice cream with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday.  She said she couldn't let us leave without something sweet...again, she was the best.\n\nBummed they are already booked for Valentine's day this year...because we wanna go back as soon as we have another excuse for a nice dinner!", "author": "Sandra M."}

Tables are placed very close together and the room gets noisy when full. Try to get one of the 2 window tables (one for 4 and one for 2) which provide a quieter and more intimate setting. \n\nFood was good but not great; inconsistent flavors and seasoning. The potato gnochi was recommended for an appetizer. It was ok but had an overly strong garlic flavor. On the other hand, the red pepper soup lacked flavor and seasoning; could hardly taste any red pepper at all. The deboned roast chicken, which was also recommended, was juicy and tender but the dish was too salty. So, not that impressed w/the food.   Service was good; plates delivered and picked up promptly and water glasses refilled w/o asking.\n\nStreet parking in the area (if you know it) is virtually impossible to find. Valet parking is not offered, but there is a private garage available about 1/2 up the block.   \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but, if you're in the area or can take the cable car or Muni there, it's a nice place to eat.  Don't think it deserves the 4-5 star reviews that other people have posted but you should have an acceptable meal here nonetheless.\n\nIf it's open, make sure to stop at Swenson's for an ice cream cone at the corner of Union and Hyde.  It's the \"original\" Swensons and has been at this location for over 60 years.  I use to climb up the hill from Helen Wills Playground (at Broadway & Larkin) in the summer to eat ice cream there as a kid and it was great stopping there for some ice cream again last night.", "author": "Martin C."}

The only knock is the difficult street parking (not unusual in SF!, but more challenging than a lot of areas, I would say).\n\nThe style is California cuisine-ish. However, I must mention that what is not California cuisine-ish are the portion sizes. Often I feel that the serving sizes at some chi-chi places are a little chintzy. NOT so at Frascati. You get a good serving size of whatever you are ordering, from starters to dessert, and particularly, the entrees. \n\nI enjoyed the mushroom bruschetta (give me more!), and the fresh pasta (I forgot the Italian name of the pasta form) in cream sauce. Very tasty. Someone else had another pasta (different sauce) and that was very good as well. Others enjoyed their duck breast and pork chop. \n\nThe dessert of chocolate bread pudding was okay, a little dry for my taste. But the apple cobbler was very good. \n\nThe service was great and attentive, very helpful answering menu questions. \n\nPrices are typical for this type of restaurant and well worth it: mostly mid- to upper-20s for entrees and low teens for starters.

The pork chop was delicious but my date expected a more traditional, high quality, bread pudding with some chocolate but got bowled over by the intense chocolate and couldn't eat it.  They did remove it from the bill and were very nice and concerned about it.\n\nSince they seemed so concerned so I brought up the pork chop issue.  The lady I spoke with was genuinely pleased that so many people came for their great pork chops but didn't seem to realize that a lot of the popularity was from the rave reviews on Yelp!   It's an interesting trap to be in.  They certainly don't want to become a \"one dish\" restaurant but more newbies than not are likely to order the pork chop and bread pudding after reading these Yelp*reviews.  I'll admit, I'll be hard pressed to not order the chop next time but I'm sure it's not the only thing that's good there.  Read all the reviews.\n\nLocation was interesting.  Atmosphere was very nice.  Prices matched the venue.\n\nFor desert I had a Swenson's licorice ice cream at the other end of the block up the hill.  Fabulously good.  (Warning!

The second time was New Year's Eve 2014/2015 with my new boyfriend and the menu was fixed, and it was delicious and wonderful. The only issue was that I ordered the steak and he ordered the salmon, but we ordered the exact same appetizers and I got larger portions of lobster, etc on my plate. I think it was just dumb luck, but my boyfriend was put-off and assumed it was a conspiracy by the chef because he thought the chef assumed a man would order the steak, and thus sent ME the larger portions. I think that the waiter obviously would hand us the plates at random, and it was luck that my lobster salad had 1.5x as much lobster in it. So yeah the consistency was off but it didn't bother me!

The texture is mousse like and I love how the sweetness of the compote compliments the flavor of the foie gras.  The waiter also suggested sweet wine with our foie gras and that definitely added to the party in the mouth.  After we polished off the Brioche I just started spreading it on my table bread.

I finished about half of it before I was completely stuffed. The risotto rice is larger than i'm use to.  I also thought it was a bit on the saltier side.

My husband ordered the tomato bisque and I ordered a seafood and pasta dish. The fresh baked bread was very good. I also had the bread salad, which was very good (would recommend). My husband's tomato bisque tasted like Campbell's tomato soup out of the can. It was absolutely horrible, especially for $10. My seafood entree was very good (would recommend). We did not have dessert. On my next visit to SF, I will try some other places.", "author": "C J."}

You can't blame me for having such high expectations considering it was my SO's birthday who is none other than the bangin' hot Randy T.\n\nWe booked reservations through Open Table and specified that it was a birthday dinner. They kindly seated us in a cozy and intimate corner situated away from the dining crowd. How thoughtful.\n\nWe both enjoyed our appetizers but I honestly would have preferred his octopus salad over my salty foie gras. I had to ask for more bread to balance out the saltiness of the foie gras. My duck entree came with 2 pieces. One piece was cooked just perfectly, tender and medium rare. The other piece however, was more of a medium thus I spent most of the time trying to chew it into a digestible form. Docked a star for inconsistency. The SO wasn't blown away by this halibut either.\n\nMy panna cotta dessert was meh. I was excited for the caramelized bananas but they could have taken the dessert to new heights had they given me a whole banana flambe. The other dessert, warm black and white chocolate bread pudding, was amazing! Yes, you heard right, a CHOCOLATE bread pudding with HAZELNUT ice cream to boot! The pudding had bits of nuts and other ingredients I couldn't quite pin point that added well to its texture. \n\nThey were nice enough to stick a candle in Randy's dessert which was a good excuse for me to sing him the \"Happy Birthday\" song AGAIN (yes, I spoil him).  I couldn't help but wonder if we didn't order dessert, would they have still offered us a birthday treat? Nonetheless, Randy was irked that his dessert wasn't complimentary. Can't really blame them for that, after all, we are fine dining in an economic slump. \n\nNo major complaints from me except that I value consistency. Maybe next time they'll get the duck right.", "author": "Nancy L."}

Inside, the old candy shop is very quaint and welcoming. \n\nI've been twice with no reservations so we just sat at the bar and ate. The service there was great and very attentive. The asparagus and waldorf salads are both incredible, great flavors and perfectly prepared. \n\nFor entrees we got the ribeye and chicken. The ribeye was good, but the chicken is the restaurants signature dish. The meat was very juicy and flavorful. The wine selection was of good quality, but not extensive. The pours were generous too. \n\nThe first time we went, we skipped dessert and went to nearby Swenson's for ice cream. Although that place is delicious, the second time we stayed for the bread pudding and were glad we did. Definitely enough for two people and quite delicious.\n\nThe bar is a great place to eat, but I'd recommend reservations, this place is packed every weekend night.", "author": "Jeff O."}

We had so much attention and they didn't even know it was my birthday. Upon recommendation of the sommelier, we started with a bottle of Campion Pinot Noir 2005. It was an excellent choice.\n\nI had the foie gras appetizer served with small toasts. It melted in my mouth and was very delicious. My husband had the calamari that was equally good. For our entrees, he ordered the flank steak and I got the Artic Char (fish). We were pleased with both choices. We had to have dessert even though by that time, we were pretty full. My husband had the cobbler and I had the bread puddling with hazelnut ice cream. I can't say that I've been a huge fan of bread pudding in the past, but this was truly exceptional. They make their own ice cream and it was really good. \n\nOverall our experience was absolutely fabulous.

It's only Wednesday but I've already been to Frascati this week...twice. \n\nIt's not entirely my fault. I've had friends in town, which means it's my duty to show off the local cuisine. And Frascati is a mere three block walk from my apartment so...can you really blame me?? \n\nAt least I didn't order the same meal twice. Trust me, it wasn't easy. I am completely and utterly obsessed with Frascati's duck with spaetzle and huckleberry sauce. Normally I'm more of a seafood entr\u00e9e person, but I don't even glance at the other menu items. The second time around, however, I opted for the lighter two appetizer route: a savory mushroom and goat cheese bruschetta followed by a deliciously crisp pear and gorgonzola salad. And wine, obviously. \n\nBut the REAL reason I drag my poor (lucky) friends to Frascati time and time again is the dessert. If you know me at all, I'm sure I've already evangelized the Frascati warm black & white chocolate bread pudding, but bear with me. If a molten chocolate lava cake and bread pudding mated, this would be their offspring. (Not sure that dessert sex is an appetizing concept but, oh well.)\n\nAll in all, I've been to Frascati about four times in the last month. But it has to stop, mainly because...I was caught. On trip #2 this week the host gave me a weird look and started to say \"Waaaaait weren't you here...\" until he was stopped short by my searing glance.

It's moist, it's delicious, it's like a cross between a fudgy brownie and a real bread pudding... all I can think of is that it must have taken some serious soaking in some serious chocolate for it to achieve that kind of textured cake consistency....because hello it did start as BREAD! The hazelnut ice cream is the crowning glory, oh and the slice is huge, so even if you are a greedy bitch like me, you will still not mind sharing.\n\nEsp if you sampled the rest of this menu like you should have. Get an appetizer, get a salad or their soup, and a big fat entree. Their portions are pretty darn big. The smoked salmon bruschetta was very good. The black figs with bleu cheese, genius. I wouldn't have ordered it but I am glad my husband did since I ate half of his. The mushroom soup was not my favorite, it needed more flavor in my opinion, but everyone else loved it. Rib-eye with bleu cheese and heirloom tomato salad, big winner, loved the garlic seasoning it came with...not too overpowering so you don't feel like you are leaving smelling like a Dracula-repellent, but just enough to add real flavor. Sampled the rest of the table's pork chop and salads, yum.\n\nService was excellent, very friendly, brought out my sister's dessert with a lit candle for her birthday, and the waitress even went and asked the chef when we wanted her to explain the difference between capers and caper berries (you know the giant ones that look like olives!).

We were only in SF for one night, and researched frantically just days prior, trying to find a place that would not disappoint. \n\nIt is a quaint little place that is charming and welcoming. It can be romantic, but is not stuffy or pretentious. You can dress casual or a little more formal, and you will fit right in.\n\nI ate in three courses, starting with an italian sausage risotto which was amazing (maybe slightly over salted, but tons of flavor). Then I had a mushroom bisque which was smooth and flavorful. My main course was a rigatoni dish with a rabbit meat rague sauce. Also amazing.\n\nWe finished off with the black and white (a chocolate bread pudding we read about in other reviews). We were not let down.\n\nPrices were moderate. We each had three courses, dessert, and an $80 bottle of wine, and after tip still got out of there under $200.\n\nService was great, and with a seat right by the front window, we got to watch the trolley's cruise by all evening long.", "author": "T S."}

The wine menu covered a lot of different wine regions but I thought it was lacking in the Cab department. \n\nThe pork chop was tender, moist and with a perfect crust. Easily the best pork chop I have had at a restaurants. My dads double cut brined and stuffed pork chops are still number 1.  The potatoes that came along with it were OK and had some type of vinegar on them. I am not a vinegar fan so they didn't really appeal to me. \n\nThe desserts were absolutely amazing.  By far some of the best I have had in the City. The bread pudding was more a chocolate brownie sundae than actual bread pudding. And the apple crisp was on point. Another surprise was how large the size of the deserts were. We laughed at the sized and told the waiter that we should have order 3. He told us that he wouldn't have let us order three. Sad thing is that we ate every last bite and could have had more since it was so delicious.\n\nMy only complaint of the restaurant was the  pear salad.

It's a cute cozy place, although immediately after walking in, it seemed a bit chaotic as far as the staff went, and that feeling unfortunately continued. We were seated immediately, our waitress stopped to take our water order, then a few minutes later the host came by to take our water order. We gave it again. Then our waitress didn't come back for a while longer. I had a few questions on the menu, so when she finally came back, I needed a minute to think, which I'm sure my husband was thrilled about since it would probably be another 10 minutes until she was back.\n\nRegardless, it wasn't that bad, she was helpful with the menu. After reading the good reviews for the octopus salad, I was debating between that and the duck confit salad, she steered me to the octopus, and it was good. The octopus was cooked perfectly and had a good mix of flavors with the other salad toppings. I can't remember what my husband got to start, perhaps a special, as he was eying the gnocchi, but after the poor reviews for that, I think he considered something else.\n\nFor our mains, he went with the pork chop and I went with the paparadelle. Both were good enough, but nothing memorable and we were both just like, 'eh'. Nothing to complain about, but nothing we'd come back for. We decided to skip dessert there as nothing sounded good, and we headed next door to Swensen's for a scoop - their ice cream is sooo good!", "author": "Lauren M."}

We had a few different plates and a bottle of wine on there at the same time and there really was not enough room for it all. I'm just being picky, though.\n\nThe apps, the entrees, and the desert ... all outstanding. And this place is not too pricey at all either. It's is a quaint little restaurant in a quaint little neighborhood. And if you're into wine bars, head across the street after dinner to the smallest bar I've ever seen, a place called \"Bacchus\".

Pork chop great but commonly over brined and raw near bone. No one seems to know how the octopus salad is made but they could always do better with fresh octopus rather than needing to poach it, marinade it and then fire it. Pass. The pappardelle is great. More sausage to noodles would be great. I find their pairings to be very sharp in contrast. Take the duck salad. Where you may want to see a nice lemon balance with a duck salad, they put maytag blue on it. It's like throwing a hand grenade into the whole dish muting the subtle warm rich tones of confit duck.

We had the apple cobbler and warm chocolate bread pudding with homemade hazelnut ice cream which were both delicious.\n\nService was good; I found the restaurant a bit too crowded with its small interior with too many tables crammed together.  As a result, it was a little difficult to hear at times when the room was full.", "author": "Bowdoin S."}

All the way in the back- too dark to read the menus, completely isolated from the restaurant alluring atmosphere that is seen from the window.\n\n2. A very icy waiter.

The food was plated better than it tasted. \nAppetizers: Heirloom salad- which was a very bland three hunks of tomatoes for $10. Gnocchi- creamy but no taste whatsoever- disappointing.  Figs- ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. A very nice balance of savory and sweet with a bit of crunch.\n\nMain Course:\nI would suggest the chicken. My only complaint, is that it had too many unbaked breadcrumbs that made the dish very salty.  Still, it was good.\n\nAll in all. I won't be returning. I am glad I tried it.

It wasn't as good as the first time.....\n\nOur server was just odd.  He wasn't mean or rude, but just had a bunch of oddities.  He kept giving my guy the check and the wine list and I wondered if it was a subconscious \"you're the white dude, with all Koreans, you must be the responsible one\".  When he brought out the dessert he giggled it before he set it down.  Why?\n\nAnyway, with that said, the food wasn't as spectacular as I remembered.  The gnocci was pretty good and I believe the duck was as good as before, but the rest of the dishes also had oddities about them.  The pork was cooked well, but my man felt it was too sweet.  My girlfriend's risotto was off the hook, until I tasted some sand, which most likely came from unwashed mushrooms,which makes sense because you're not supposed to run them under water, but crunching on sand is an awful experience.  Then the risotto had a weird floral after-taste that didn't taste bad but tripped me the heck out.  Finally my fish dish was cooked okay but very bland.  (NOPA's halibut still rocks the roof.)\n\nThe restaurant still gets 4 stars for their desserts.  The pana cotta was still divine regardless from its giggly intro, and the chocolate ice cream was smoothly delicious.\n\nHonestly, I know I wanted to be a regular there, but I've changed my mind.  But I know I'll be going back for the pana cotta.", "author": "Susan C."}

He's relatively new to the area, so I gave him an authentic SF experience by leading him on a death march up Mason St. from Union Square, then over Russian Hill to this little restaurant on the corner of Green and Hyde.  \n\nHe was not amused by the march, but his mood improved when the wine arrived.  We shared a salad and appetizer - mixed green salad, and mushroom gnocchi.  \n\nThe gnocchi were a revelation, light and fluffy in a rich and complex mushroom sauce.  The salad had some interesting peppery greens in it, and the dressing was good, but I felt a restaurant of this caliber could have done something more original than adding dried cranberries, apples, and goat cheese.  May I suggest trying figs, pistachios, and gorgonzola?\n\nThe entrees arrived, with more wine.  I had the scallops, and he had the chicken.  By this time, all his annoyance over the surprise aerobic work-out had disappeared, as he groaned with pleasure at every bite of chicken.  The chicken had a beautiful sauce, potatoes, and young artichokes.  My scallops were equally delicious, seared on the outside and tender inside, accompanied by carrot puree and shredded cabbage.\n\nRegarding desert, I would have to agree with other Yelp reviewers - our apple cobbler was huge  - too big even for two people, and much too sweet.  Let's go for something a bit more sophisticated next time.  \n\nThe service was friendly, efficient, and unpretentious.  The nice waitress came running after us with a forgotten bag as we walked out towards the street.  The setting is just like that Sinatra song, with little cable cars climbing halfway to the stars.

This place is, hands down, my favorite San Francisco dining spot. And I know of what I speak. I spent 3 years reviewing restaurants for radio, television and print. It is all at once upscale and your neighborhood joint. \n\nIt is always packed, so make reservations. Once I wanted a space at the bar and they were so busy, they gave me a glass of bubbles while I waited on someones stairs. I brought my chef boyfriend in from Sweden and he didn't stop talking about the place for two weeks. They invite me in with jeans, and make me feel like a queen when I am dressed up. The servers make you feel like family, and so does Jon, the owner. \n\nYou must have the gnocchi starter, and any one of their seasonal soups. I love the grilled bread salad, and duck breast entree. I have never had a bad dish here, nor a bad experience. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go here.

We got there a little late but it wasn't that bad.  I suggest you make time for parking since it can be a bit challenging.\n\nWe were greeted by warm smiles immediately as we walked in.  One thing nice was that Frascati had a prix fixe dinner that night which helped eliminate my indecisiveness (it's a Libra thing).\n\nFirst course - Steak Tartare.  Absolutely delicious.  The olive oil, spices, and capers really made this first course dish stand out.  I'm usually not a fan of raw meat but this was super tasty with a crostini.  He had the scallops.  Even though I am allergic to shellfish I will eat this stuff.  These were cooked just right.  Soft, sweet, yet fresh.\n\nSecond course- Eggs and Bacon.  Don't let the name fool you but this was definitely unique.  It was a small plate of field greens with thick diced pieces of yummy fried bacon along with an over-easy duck egg.  The duck egg is what made this dish interesting.  As I pierced the yolk it oozed over the bed of greens.  It was yummy.  I enjoyed this dish very much so.  He had Lobster Bisque.  I had to take a couple of spoonfuls of this wonderful soup.  Too bad i'm allergic but I made sure i didn't overdose.\n\nThird course - some type of sea bass.  I wish i remembered the exact name of this dish.  That's what I get for not paying attention (i blame it on the pinot noir which totally complimented my meal). The sea bass was lightly fried w/skin and was also accompanied by wild mushrooms and a creamy polenta. The dish was very good.  He had the lamb.  I'm very picky when it comes to lamb and the way how it's cooked.  This was executed well.  No gamey like taste.  I could totally eat this!\n\nOur server was so nice.  Food and wine was excellent.  A very small yet romantic restaurant.  Atmosphere is more on the quiet side.  No loud boisterous noises here.  Definitely a restaurant to check out in this neighborhood.  I also love how the cable cars pass by.  It's cool watching the tourists peek in through the window watching us wine and dine.", "author": "Ro C."}

Reminiscent of something you might see in North Beach. Warm, romantic interior. TINY restroom...get ready to bump your head on the door. :D \nOrdered:  Starters: Russett Potato Gnocchi and Foie Gras Torchon.  Main entrees: Grilled Pork Chop and Fresh Seafood Fettuccine.  Dessert: Artisinal Cheese Platter.\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$120\n\nI really wanted to love this place!  The reviews seemed impressive and the menu sounded delish.  However, Frascati fell a bit shy of my expectations.  Our reservations were rather late for a Saturday night so we were seated promptly amidst a bustling restaurant.  Our server was slow to greet us, didn't introduce himself, and was mildly attentive.  Disappointing.  I thought the busboy did a better job at being attentive!  \n\nOnto the food.  Appetizers: The foie gras torchon was quite tasty.  It arrived with two pieces of toasted brioche.  The brioche was TDF. I asked for a few more.  After eating five of them, I discovered they were battered in butter.  No wonder those little devils were so good.  :X  The apple currant compote paired nicely with the foie gras.  I had a nibble of the gnocchi however was not impressed.  It was different and packed a lot of flavor although I am not a fan of gnocchi.  The main entrees were good.  My pork chop was seasoned, succulent, and served with all the right ingredients - eggplant puree, cipollini jus, and red onion marmalade.  Good portion.  Not overly small nor overly large.  The fresh seafood fettuccine was just that...fresh!  I could tell the noodle was made in house because it was fine and \"eggy\".  The seafood in the fettuccine was plentiful and also very fresh.  The pesto was quite inviting.  Of course having a cheese plate on the menu, I had to complete my meal with an order of that.  I love trying new cheeses, they're always so delightful.  My cheese plate included a p'tit basque (sheeps milk), buenalba (goats milk cheese infused with red wine), tallegio (washed cows milk), and maytag bleu cheese.  I enjoyed all of them however my favorites would have ben the p'tit basque and the maytag bleu.  Both very acerbic however the flavors were eased up by the nuts they were served with.\n\nI'm torn.  I would rate this place a 4 for the food, yet 3 for their service.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and round up.  Guess our server was having an off-night.

I was thinking, uh oh, we will have to wait... nope, the waiter said there was a table waiting for us, he even gave us a choice.  we picked the balcony.  A tiny little space that was both cute and romantic... the lighting was perfect.\n\nOn to the food... we got three appetizer, a cheese plate, gnocci and \"bacon\" (its pork belly).  the pork belly.... divine, it been roasted, the skin was still chewy.  the cheese plate, was wonderful... great way to start a meal.  the gnocci was fresh.\n\nI ordered the ribeye.  to my surprise, it was a pretty big size... cant go wrong with a ribeye, and I was right.  The steak came with a bread salad, heirloom tomatoes and best of all a lot of blue cheese.  The blue cheese went so well with the steak, I would have never thought.  \n\nMy friend ordered the pasta.  It was spicy and had a very strong olive flavor.  I cant really figure out how they did it, since I didnt see that many olives in the dish.  \n\nAnd now, the best part.... the dessert.... I dont think ive had such good dessert at a restaurant in a long time.  we ordered the  bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream, panna cotta and one scope of the chocolate peanut butter ice cream.  To my surprise, i think I liked the chocolate PB ice cream the most.  Since they use PB in the ice cream, the ice cream was so rich, creamy and think, it was not really like ice cream at all.  The bread pudding was a chocolate flavor bread pudding, and it was delicious, went so well with the hazelnut ice cream.  the panna cotta was light and but you can really taste the vanilla.\n\nAnyways... loved it.. loved it loved it....  i wanna go back.. again and again...", "author": "Janet S."}

We enjoyed the Ciopinni, Stone Fruit Bruschetta, and Grilled Bread salad as apps for 4 people. Decent portions and we didn't finish it all. 2 of our guests were not seafood lovers and they enjoyed the Ciopinni very much.\n\nFor dinner we had the chicken, halibut and ribsteak. All well prepared and well enjoyed.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Chocolate bread pudding, while none of us cared for the bread pudding (it was more of a brownie taste/texture) the ice cream topping was divine.\n\nThey have loft style seating that overlooks the kitchen, best to try and reserve this during your reservation.

I tried a friend's lamb, which was also so tender and delicious.\n\nOur finale was the black and white bread pudding, which I envisioned as delicious, but this was the only point at which the meal fell down. The hazelnut ice cream was very good, but the pudding was dry...really disappointing.\n\nThe only other imperfect note is service-oriented.

The first time I came here I had dessert and drinks at the bar, which was a lot of fun. My friend and I made conversation with some of the other patrons at the bar, and the bartender was very outgoing and talkative. I have also come here in a larger group and sat in the dining room for a late night graduation dinner. Everything was amazing except we did feel rushed by our waiter to leave. We had reservations for  9:30 (can't remember exactly) and after sitting down and ordering wine and appetizers we were told we needed to order by 10pm because the kitchen was closing. At this point we had already built up a $200 + tab and we were a little miffed that 30 min after sitting down we were starting to feel rushed. Believe me I waited tables and bartended for 6 years, so I know how frustrating it is when you have a lingering table. However, if you have a large party that has taken the last reservation for the night you just prepare yourself for a late night and hope your gratuity reflects the good service you give and the inconvenience of having to stay late.

Delicious!\n\n*Our personable, with-it waiter suggested a wonderful Gewurztraminer to pair with my meal and a superb Pinot Noir for the chop. It's repetitive, yes, but they were perfect matches. \n\n*I had the affogato for dessert (espresso with vanilla bean ice cream & chantilly cream - tastes even better than it reads) and he had the baked apple cobbler a la mode. \n\nThe cobbler was such a hit that as she was exiting, a sweet little old lady who looked to be about 90 years old and weighed maybe 90 lbs. as well, stopped at our table, pointed at the cobbler and said \"Isn't that delicious?

A week later, this place stands out, both for the service and for the amazing food.\n\nThe restaurant is everything that's great about San Francisco: fresh foods, personal service, and the feeling that you're having a warm and unique dining experience.\n\nIf you go, you must get the figs. And the brussel sprouts. (I thought I hated brussel sprouts but it turns out that my nine-year-old self does not agree with my present-day self about this important issue.) Oh, and you must also try the honey glazed duck. The sad part (maybe) is that they change their menu frequently, so these dishes may not be available for you. I don't do regular desserts anymore, so they made a delicious fruit cup of figs (yum, a repeat) and some other fruits.\n\nMany thanks to the wine-buyer and our waitress for a truly memorable evening. Be sure to try the table upstairs with the view of the kitchen.", "author": "Ellie P."}

The restaurant itself is super cute and in a great location (Hyde at Green).  (Can I just say how much I wish I lived in Russian Hill?  I love how the restaurants are all tucked away on cute corners...I try to live in the neighborhood every time I move, but it never works out...anyways, I digress...)\n\nWe were seated upstairs and I immediately noticed how many couples were on dates.  The atmosphere is very romantic (warm, good lighting, etc.).  We started with the cheese plate, which was beautifully plated and incredibly delish!  I ordered the duck that I had read so much about and fiance ordered the pesto pasta.  The duck was good (juicy and tender), but I have to say the pesto pasta was way way better -- I will be ordering tht next time.  We shared the gynormous bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream (which was awesome and tasted like chocolate cake -- you MUST order this!).  \n\nSome of the reviews mention that the place is overpriced -- I disagree.  Yes, it may be more pricey than some restaurants, but the price is commensurate with the level of service and dining.  Our bill came out to $100 (without tip) for 1 app, 1 dessert, 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine, which was actually lower than I expected.  The service was perfect, by the way.  I think I found my new favorite spot!", "author": "Mitzi C."}

One order supplies five chops. I couldn't finish my dinner so I asked for a box. So did my halibut girlfriend and my pork chop girlfriend. \n\nHalibut and Pork Chop got their boxes right away. When I inquired about my to go box, I was told that it was waiting for me at the door. A few moments later one of the service staff came over and said, \"I asked you if you wanted a box and you said, 'No.'\" I was shocked because Halibut had asked for a box for both of us and when the service staff took my plate I said that I wanted a box. Perhaps he heard what he wanted to hear. \n\nHe did not apologize. He said that it was MY FAULT for him hearing that I said that I didn't want a box. He basically called me out in front of the whole restaurant saying that I was making up the fact that I wanted /didn't want a box. I had TWO LAMB CHOPS and 75% of my ratatouille left on my plate. I arranged it to look pretty on my plate. WHO WOULD THROW AWAY $20 leftovers??? Obviously he would.\n\nI was shaking mad and asked to talk to the manager. The manager came over and said that he regretted the situation and offered to make a PASTA dish or a BREAD PUDDING dessert for me to take home. YEAH RIGHT. Like a $5 dish will make up for my bruised ego and $50 dinner. \n\nHe did not once apologize for the situation and he did not once offer to have the service staff come over to apologize for me. \n\nThe only consolation that I have for tonight is that I was with ten girlfriends who will no doubt spread the bad news of Frascati far and wide. \n\nBelow is a review of the food that we ordered:\n\nThe duck trio was okay. You need to eat a lot of bread to get it all down.\n\nThe risotto was tender but needed seasoning.\n\nThe gnocchi was lovely with all the beans and veges.\n\nThe seared ahi tuna definitely needed the olive condiment to make it work.\n\nThe rack of lamb was slightly over cooked; I asked for medium rare. The ratatouille was tasty and tender. \n\nThe pork chop was a little too sweet.\n\nThe steak was a little tough. \n\nThe halibut was just right. The vegetables were a perfect complement to the fish. \n\nThe pasta was bland yet al dente. \n\nThe chocolate bread pudding had a nice caramel chew to it; however, bread pudding is supposed to be soft; like pudding. \n...........................................................................................................................\n\nToday is 7/28/07. One day after my majorly unpleasant experience at Frascati, Pork Chop girl got a call back from the restaurant manager. He left a message apologizing for last night, said that he spoke to the employee who made me feel awful about my non-lamb, and asked that we come back so that he can change our opinion about Frascati.\n\nHm.\n\nThanks for the message, but I really don't feel like going back anytime soon. \n\nYou get one legit star for the fact that you left a message and told us that you spoke to the employee about his impolite behavior.", "author": "Jacquee P."}

(And so you wonder--all damn week--whether last night's spinach is still stuck in your teeth; whether your deodorant has stopped your pits from reeking; whether your skirt has been perpetually stuck in your pantyhose...)\r\n\r\nI went to Frascati on the tail end of a week of bad service, hoping to bring it to an end.  That didn't happen.  Our server was mostly absent; irritatingly chatty when table-side; and slowwwwww.  Not slow in the lazy bistro way--slow in that the-dining-room-is-overcrowded-and-I'm-too-busy-to-refill-your-water way.  I mean, we spent $200--a little attention would've been nice.\r\n\r\nBut I'm four-starring this place nonetheless.  Let's review why.\r\n\r\nFirst, I didn't order the cheese plate, but it included two of my all-time favorites:  Humboldt Fog & St. Andre.  Plus 10 bazillionjillion for Frascati.  \r\n\r\nWe did order two other appetizers:  the fig-prosciutto-blue cheese salad & the heirloom tomato-couscous-feta salad.  Although both were good, the fig salad far outshone its companion:  The figs were juicy & meaty, dripping with balsamic vinegar & wrapped in generous cuts of a thin, salty prosciutto that neither overtook the figs nor was lost in the acidity of the balsamic.  Really well-done.\r\n\r\nFor my entree, I chose a crusted halibut (also generously portioned!) set atop fava beans and topped off with a \"mushroom salsa.\"  Although I found the beans unremarkable, that mushroom salsa had me at hello--it was a sweet, rich chop-chop of multiple mushrooms that just dissolved in my mouth.  \r\n\r\nAs for dessert, I first tasted the \"pavlova,\" which actually was just a cookie-like meringue topped with powdered sugar, mixed berries, and fresh whipped cream.  If you know what real pavlova is (a SOFT-baked meringue, not a meringue cookie! UGH!), don't bother with Frascati's version.  \r\n\r\nBut then I tasted the famed chocolate bread pudding.

Though their pork comes on and off the menu, the gnocchi stays on there for a good amount of time.

Just strolled in the other night with no reservations and was seated immediately - at a cute little table right in the window to watch the cable cars roll by.  \n\nThe food, wine and service especially rivaled anywhere I have eaten in the city.  The pinot they have by the glass is amazing and our server kept offering us tastes of all the wines to make sure we had the glass we liked best.\n\nThe bread salad was incredible.  I would go back just for this.  Also amazing were the charcuterie plate, the cheese platter (love Humboldt fog), and the special of fillet over risotto.  \n\nParking may be a bitch - so take the cable car or a cab.

A great date place and friendly, reliable place I could trust for important business dinners as well.\n\nI made my reservation, asked for a specific waiter and table; \"fine we'll see you then.\"\n\nI showed up on time exactly,  not knowing it had been recently sold, I still saw a lot of familiar faces when I walked in and felt Ok, but the waiter wasn't working there on Fridays anymore (how can that be?), the reservation upstairs - expressly asking for a table upstairs - was not available (was I in the right place?), no hospitality was offerred for our 30 minute wait - I never waited for more than 5 minutes before under same circumstances, and if I did one of the fine folks working there would offer  a taste of wine for the wait. I decided to go across the street for a glass of wine to wait for 30 minutes, 25 minutes later just as I am paying my bill across the street  I get a phone call, \"Are you coming back?\" with a little tiny atttitude. \n\nIt was 9:00 now and the place was thinning out a bit. I still did not get the table I wanted, bread took 10 minutes to find its way to us at least, no friendly looks, the FEEL was very different. The wait staff regulars were going about the business of serving and the mechanics of ordering and so forth was average. The menu was different (no more short ribs sadly) but the choices were interesting ,our selection was cooked perfectly and the presentation was great. I had Cod and my guest had the lamb chops -  exellent too. Bread pudding, my favorite, was a little too crispy in some places, but still very good. Food = good, above average for sure. The wine list looked smaller, not sure but it had good choices as normal.\n\nSo in my humble opinion but also as someone who has eaten at Frascati over 3 years and maybe 30 times the food was good and the service was fine. You need more than good food and service in this class, you need great service. I don't go out of my way in SF to find good food, its easy. I do, and will in the future, for service. \n\nIts a very GOOD neighborhood place with class. I probably won't go out of my way to go again.

Again - the flavors were great and everything was fresh and pretty, we just wished there had been more.\n- For entrees, we each ordered the maple leaf duck breast. It really was fantastic. If you don't like your meat rare - be forewarned that this comes juicy! The flavoring on the skin itself was wonderful and the consistency was perfect!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-09-08", "description": "Located in Russian Hill right next to a cable car stop, Frascati is the quintessential San Francisco experience.  As soon as you walk in, the warm yellow walls, intimate neighborhood atmosphere, subtle jazz music playing in the background and bustling open kitchen immediately arouse your senses to acknowledge, \"I know I'm gonna have a good time tonight,\" and that's even before trying the food!\n\nRecommendations to start:\n\nThe gnocchi with white truffle oil is simply the best.  The texture has a very, very slight bite to it which is exactly how I love my gnocchi rather than the overdone \"why-couldn't-they-take-this-out-a-minute-or-two-sooner\" feel offered at other places.  It's typically served with sweet corn mixed with seasonal veggies such as fava beans, morel mushrooms, asparagus or summer squash.  \n\nGrilled asparagus -- how great can grilled asparagus be, right?  Well Frascati somehow found the perfect confection by tossing it with olive oil, a mushroom cous cous and parmesan cheese.  Very light and satisfying.\n\nThe bread salad is good, again very light but flavorful with the feta cheese and kalamata olives, but I also like the regular mixed green salad mainly because they toss it with fresh strawberries (and pistachios) and I was pleasantly surprised how the sweet yet sometimes bitterness of the fruit livened up what could have been a plain salad.  I've never seen strawberries on salads so they deserve my kudos for coming up with something original.\n\nMain dishes: \n\nTheir pork dishes are truly the best.  Having grown up not eating pork, I always ordered halibut, chicken or steak (which are excellent as well) but after taking occassional bites off my boyfriend's plate and building up to practically eating the entire dish, I finally resolved to ordering my own and have never gone back.  Their rigatoni with pork sugo has the perfect yin and yan balance -- light yet rich, firm yet tender, sweet yet salty.  Being carb conscious I usually never order pasta as a main but this is worth the extra 30 minutes on the eliptical.\n\nThe pork tenderloin with sausage, roasted peppers and basil farro (a grain similar to barley) and pork chop with figs and pancetta are also wonderful.  My family, who also is pork adverse, are now fans of these dishes.\n\nSweet treats:\n\nBread pudding with hazelnut ice cream is a must, as is the dish with the basil ice cream served with a nectarine tart.\n\nLast but not least, the staff:\n\nWonderful, wonderful people.  Jon Radar, the owner/manager, truly understands that you, the customer, is why Frascati exists so will accommodate you in any way he can (of course this is within reason!).  He always comes by the table to be sure we are comfortable, waves, or even comes out from inside the restaurant, when we're walking by on Hyde street, or listens to critical feedback with an open mind (I assure you there isn't much to say here).  \n\nThe rest of the staff -- Tony, Suzanne, Baselio, Scott -- are charming, engaging, knowledgeable and very entertaining!  I've brought my sisters here and my brother-in-law (who travels internationally and is admittedly a food and wine snob) and all were impressed by the food but mainly the staff.  They remembered details that were said earlier in the evening, offered to prepare something off the menu for my picky niece, and asked questions about their personal lives, creating a \"I care to get to know ya\" feeling.\n\nIn summation, every time I have something to celebrate, have friends in town, want to make an impression, or simply want good food, Frascati is the only reliable restaurant in the city I go to.", "author": "E Y."}

I finally made it on Sunday night.  I can't believe I haven't been sooner.\n\nThis is a great date place!  Very charming interior - both upstairs and downstairs.  The food was great - my halibut was good, but a bit mild/bland, but my friend's pork was really great - tender with some sweet grains (though he thought the waiter said \"brains\" which led to some amusing confusion).  The wine list was also very extensive with lots of good, reasonably priced bottles.\n\nThe absolute highlight of the meal was my dessert - chocolate bread pudding with vanilla ice cream.  I don't know where my recent obsession with bread pudding has come from, but I do know I have always loved chocolate.  The two combined = little slice of Sunday heaven.

The food I ordered was good but not great (not sure I'd give it the high zagat rating it has) but everyone else at the table loved theirs, so I'm thinking maybe if I ordered another entree I'd feel differently.\n\nTo start with, Russian Hill's a bit hard to get to from the peninsula/south bay but I loved the neighborhood feel of the restaurant. It was just so quaint and comfortable, yet nice. I like the downstairs, small wine bar, and little upstairs area as well. We got a great table at the window. It was fun to watch a cable car come by every once in a while. ;-)\n\nThe service was good and unpretentious--I really liked our waitress and all of the staff we interacted with.\n\nNow, the food. Here's what we got as a table:\n- Sausage risotto: sausage flavor without huge bits of sausage. I actually couldn't see the sausage but I could taste it. Very yummy\n- Gnocchi: seared which interested me, as I've never had it prepared that way. Tender pieces and nice addition of little butternut squash squares and that bit of white truffle oil. \n- Scallops: my dish. Was just ok--it could be cooked just a wee bit less for my taste to give it more of a delicate taste. Also the sauce was just a tad too vinegary if I got a piece that was soaking in it.\n- Short ribs: very generous portion and great flavor\n- Duck: my dad liked it a lot, I thought it was fine and had a good sauce\n- Chicken: pretty much a whole half of a chicken: breast, thigh, wing, etc. I thought it tasted kind of of boring but my mom raved about it. She said it was perfectly cooked and one of the best roast chicken she's ever had. \n- Bread pudding: bit dry on it's own but fantastic hazelnut caramel ice cream!\n\nAs a side note, I didn't like the scary steep stairs going down to the super small bathroom. It doesn't affect me patronizing the place, but was a bit odd.\n\nOnly other note that I'd take as a con is it was noted it was my bday on the reservation and they didn't even say happy birthday--I like it when they do that. :-( Guess I was spoiled by other restaurants going all out when they know it's a special day but I do like that attention to detail--makes you feel like they care about you as a customer. Since the people were so great there, I wasn't upset but would have been nice.\n\nAll in all, nice place and I would consider going back. My faves were the pasta appetizers and I hear you can get full portions of those for an entree so if returned, I'd do that.", "author": "Eve K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-04", "description": "Came here to ring in 2008 a day before the official NYE madness. We reserved a table a few weeks ahead, requesting one in the small upstairs balcony area since it seemed a little more quiet and cozy. Apart from the occasional loud comments coming from the 4-top table of tipsy cougars-in-training, it was very intimate atmosphere. \n\nTo do our best sampling, we agreed to split a few starter courses, an entre and dessert. We chose the steak tartare and gnocchi to start, which was presented beautifully and tasted great. The gnocchi was simple, cooked with olive oil, rosemary, sage, butternut squash, and maybe some spinach...or other leafy green vegetable that blended nicely into the mix. The tartare was uncooked to perfection, and came with garlic crostini on the side. \n\nFor our second course, the boy had the mixed green salad and I tried the mushroom bisque with truffle oil. While the salad was a bit overly dressed with vinaigrette for my taste, the soup was excellent. I asked for more bread to sop up every last drop. \n\nWe shared the \"Earth and Ocean\" which was Frascati's version of surf and turf (but with a better and more exotic name.) The \"Earth\" was a fillet mignon medallion atop creamy polenta, cooked rare (they didn't actually ask us how we liked our steak cooked, but guessed correctly; our order of steak tartare could have given away our preference.) The \"Ocean\" portion was mouth-watering butter-drenched lobster atop basil angel hair pasta. I'd have to say the Ocean ruled all, and was my favorite part of the entire meal. \n\nOur dessert was practically selected for us--once we saw our neighbors chocolate bread pudding come out, we knew we wanted the same. The bread pudding was like a mix between velvety chocolate cake and a soft rich brownie. There may have been some ice cream involved but I was too distracted by the chocolate portion. The serving was practically big enough for 4 people to split, but the two of us made sure we didn't have to take a doggy bag. To confirm our choice, the buzzed cougars nearby vocally expressed (several times) how they regretted getting the apple cobbler to the bread pudding based on how decadent it looked. Unfortunately for them, they could only dream of the taste.\n\nService was impeccable; instead of having one server assigned to our table, the entire staff worked together to go around and make sure every table had what they needed. It was a nice team effort and we never felt rushed or in need of anything. Price wise, it was definitely a splurge, but for 5 courses (1 main), dessert, a couple glasses of wine and a beer, for $120 it was worth it. \n\nIn addition to the excellent food, service and intimate atmosphere, I enjoyed the classiness and humor displayed within the details of the menu. Not every drink menu you find will have a table of contents at the beginning to help guide you through the contents, nor will it list the place of origin for every beverage, including \"Bud Light, St. Louis\". Gently reminding patrons it's rude to be on your cell phone in a restaurant, they note at the bottom of the food menu, \"Cell phones will be confiscated and made into soup.\" Nothing beats a Cingular soup de jour.", "author": "Kelly R."}

The food is solid, admittedly, but you pay the price.

Food was fine, but nothing I would rave about to any of my friends. For better Italian food for similar prices, i would recommend Perbacco or Quince. Among our party, we had the bread salad (do not order if you've tried the bread & chicken combo at Zuni Cafe!), sea scallops, soft shell crab, halibut, lamb, & pasta. Nothing stood out, although nothing was horrible. However, for the price and the culinary options available in SF, save your $$.", "author": "Carolyn F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-17", "description": "Frascati is a great date restaurant.  I wouldn't call it a destination restaurant.  But if you live in Russian Hill, this could easily become a twice a week place for you.  The restaurant feels small and intimate with soft lighting.  The service was fast and attentive.  The bartender recommended a French wine that I enjoyed very much.  While our server's recommendations were good, he comically repeated an identical description of his favorites to the table next to us, word for word.  \n\nThe food here is excellent especially for the price.  Frascati is not cheap.  But, the quality is very high and I generally find myself paying a lot more for comparable quality.  We started our meal with two types of crostini and brussel sprouts.  I am not normally a fan of brussel sprouts, but they were perfectly tender and sweet.  One of the crostini was topped with a reduction of figs and melted cheese.  The other was topped with stone fruit.  Both were excellent although I could have used a touch more salt.\n\nMy main course was a skate wing over some wilted greens.  It was perfectly seasoned.  Soft, tender.  Perfectly cooked.  Delicious.  I traded halfway through the meal with my girlfriend, who ordered the pork chop.  Her dish was also good.  But, if they have the skate on the menu, you should definitely order it.  The pork chop was well-cooked and a little rare near the bone.  But, the sauce did not compliment the pork very well.  It was like a hoisin glaze.  The flavor was a little sweet and it seemed overly reduced.  I could have done with a milder sauce and more of it.  But, the accompanying sides were very good and almost made up for the tasty but forgettable pork chop.  Our friends had the halibut over a tomato soup with shellfish and a half chicken.  The chicken was great.  The halibut was a little under-seasoned and could have used a little aioli or other fat to tie the dish together.  \n\nWe finished the meal with two desserts.  First, we had a bread pudding that was topped with a very flavorful hazelnut ice cream.  It was a little dense, but the flavor was nice.  The second dessert was a berry crumble topped with vanilla ice cream.  i was skeptical when it was ordered, but next to the skate, it was the highlight of the meal.  the flavor was very bright and deep.  The crumble topping was perfectly sweet and salty accenting the flavor of the berries.  the ice creams were great.  They are all house-made and had very delicate textures.  \n\nIn all, for the three courses, we paid $50 each.  It was totally worth it.  The food was delicious, the setting was lovely and the service was excellent.", "author": "Andrew W."}

I promise you there was a lot of butter, but this was amazing. It was a tad salty for my palate so I had to eat some bread to neutralize my tongue, but this was a solid dish despite this!\n- Pan Seared Branzino: At first, i thought this was lighter than the duck breast, but by the end, I wasn't so sure. The fish was perfectly cooked (soft) with small mushrooms on top and a cream sauce. There was some form of delicious mashed potatoes or polenta on the bottom.

The waiter tried VERY hard to push chicken on us, as if our party of 3 were at the Legionaires conference in Boca Raton and they were all out of the lasagna. I would never eat chicken at a restaurant, or pasta, the easiest things to make at home.\n\nThen we proceeded to wait for our food, and waited, and waited, and waited and waited. Meanwhile we sat in front of the drafty and cold entrance, and despite the fact that the restaurant was empty they wouldn't let us to move.I wore my my wool coat and scarf over my very inadequate dress and panty hosed legs, and my boyfriend's gallant pleading failed to persuade them to let us switch to one of the open tables. My mother was equally uncomfortable.\n\nThere is one tiny restroon here and it is perched in the middle of a flight of stairs that descend to the kitchen. A cook zipped in ahead of me, so I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally the cook left the bathroom and I went in. No toilet paper and no paper towels. Trying to banish from my head the memory of that Seinfeld episode where Seinfeld refused to eat because the cook arranges his crotch but doesn't wash his hands after he goes to the bathroom,  I went on a little hunt. No spare roll in the bathroom, not even in the little box on top of the toilet. None in the disgusting little closet down the stairs that holds the mop bucket. \n\nAnd we waited, and waited and waited, in the freezing cold, mostly empty restaurant. Finally our food came. Two of the plates were burning hot, as though they sat under the heat lamps too long. The lamb chop plate was stone cold.  So two overdone dinners and one pair of raw lamb chops, all slabs of unaccompanied, unadorned meat on plates.   \n\n\nAll in all, a very high price to pay for a thoroughly unpleasant experience.  The place was still empty when we left, so maybe this is the effect of a change of ownership. I would give zero stars if it were an option, and we will never, ever, go back.", "author": "jen n."}

Let me just start by saying my date was cutting her filet with her fork.  No, she doesn't lack etiquette; she's nothing but class.  She was merely making a point.  After I told her about the best tasting and softest filet mignon I ate at Citronelle in DC (where you could cut it with a butter knife), she proceeded to demonstrate the perfection at Frascati.\n\nThe service was top rate.  They're attentive but discrete.  We arrived 2 hours early since our previous plans fell through, so we killed time at Bacchus up the street based on the recommendation of our host.  Once he called to inform me of the table I requested was available (how many top tier restaurants offer such personalized service), we were promptly seated.\n\nThe food was good, even though my stomach was a little upset later in the night.  Wasn't sure if it was the duck; but if the volume of food we ate after we filled up on the cheese plate at Bacchus is a reflection of the quality of food at Frascati, then the food was outstanding.  Of course, we didn't eat dessert.  I mean, we're not gluttons.", "author": "Edward K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-21", "description": "Upon a recent recommendation from a client of my wife's, we tried Frascati for the first time this past Saturday evening (3/17). Of course, it didn't occur to me, for some strange reason, that it was St/ Patty's Day so getting a cab proved somewhat challenging. However, as has been stated in at least one other review, there was absolutely no problem with us arriving a few minutes late for our reservation (also made on OpenTable).\n\nBefore getting down to the food, I should mention that the Frascati is just a great place; it has a wonderful feel with the way it's laid out and decorated and, well, you just can't beat the area it's in on a nice day. Further, I should also mention that the service at Frascati was excellent.\n\nOK, now on to the food ... we started with the steak tar-tare, which was very good. I do not see it listed on the current menu that's on the website, so hopefully (for our collective sake) the site is simply a little out-of-date. Second, our server suggested we might want a salad in between our appetizer and entrees, so we decided to have the mixed green salad. In the incarnation we had, this included kumquats and a pomegranate vinaigrette; this was simply delicious and also an excellent palate cleanser before our mains.\n\nLastly, for our mains, I went with the duck which, at the time, included mushrooms and huckleberry. Now, I'm not always a huge duck fan; it can be overly rich and fatty (in my humble opinion). However, this not only did not give me this impression, but overall it was an incredibly well balanced dish; I would not hesitate to order the duck here again on a return visit. My wife went with the capellini with prawns which was also very good and had a tomato-based sauce with just the right amount of spice.\n\nIn summary, our experience at Frascati was great and I'm certain we will be back. I can simply say; Wow, another great restaurant around the Hyde-Union area (Zarzuella, 1550 Hyde, Luella to name a few)!", "author": "Matthew S."}

Although there's not much point in spelling out the appetizer and entree that managed to knock my socks off since the menu changes seasonally, I'll do it anyway in the spirit of full disclosure.  \n\nThe appetizer was delicious duck rillette and balsamic vinegared onion served on crostini.  I did not take exception to the fact that there is nothing Italian about this dish (it's a French pate-styled spread).\n\nThe entree was the most tender roasted half chicken served on a bed of fingerling potatoes and vegetables - so tender and moist that the white meat actually tasted like a normal chicken's dark meat (aside from being an Italian food hater, I am also a white meat hater so serving up a white meat dish that I actually enjoy is a feat).  While enjoying my food I was briefly toying with the idea that the chicken was somewhat a mutant - there's no way a normal free range chicken could taste that good, have such a tender texture, and be so freakishly small. \n\nOne additional extra star for accommodating the six of us with less than 2 hours advanced notice.", "author": "Ange L."}

Shared the gnocchi with corn, peas, peppers, and fava beans to start.  I probably could have eaten a bucket of it, yum.  For entrees, we got the duck and the pork chop.  Both were excellent.  What I really liked about the entire menu was that it was lacking all of the dishes that you so typically see these days -- no wild salmon, no ahi (Husband had a hard time dealing with that one), no filet mignon -- yet everything sounded good (and from our vantage point, seeing all the dishes come out of the kitchen, it all looked amazing).

They thought we had ordered the chicken but they were nice to take it back and rush order the duck for us. The sea bass was alright and a bit spicy because of the sauce. The fish was kind of dry but that's not the dish that they are popular for. The lamb was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good and I usually do not eat lamb. It had this salty spice to it and it did not taste gamey.

The service is great; all the servers who even passed by our table (including Brian, the manager) made us feel at home and completely relaxed.\nThe food is upscale, but not to the point of pretension. The amount is not considered elf food nor is it massive; it's just enough to fill your tummy...and fill your tummy with warm soothing foods that appeal to all the senses. There were no odd ingredients from far away lands, just good old familiar ingredients utilized to their greatest capabilities.\nAppetizers:\nFirst time: the gnocchi is delicious. Basilio, our served, suggested it. I just wish there was more of it.\n\nSecond time: foie gras torchon. I'm not going to lie, this was my first time trying foie gras. If you let it sit on your toast for a little bit, it becomes this nice warm buttery texture that definitely screams \"screw being refined, eat me!\"\nMain courses:\nFirst time: I had the porkchop at the suggestion of Basilio again. He was right in saying that this was there most popular dish. It was an added plus that he said it's his favorite dish on the menu. It's nice and juicy on the inside, with a nice outer crispiness. Mmm, lip smacking good. (Sorry, I can't remember what the bf had, I'll have to ask)\n\nSecond time: Pan-seared dayboat scallops was amazing! Basilio was our server again; he said that for guys it's usually not enough, but for girls like me, it should be just right. Three perfectly cooked scallops atop spinach mashed potatoes.

And, we did get in on a Friday night at 8pm with no reservation and no wait. But, I agree, it is over-hyped as the entire meal amongst our group of four was very inconsistent.\n\nI will say that the appetizers were all good. We ordered the burata cheese/tomato appetizer which was nothing too special (I've had more awesome and creamier burata). Then we got the duck confit salad which was very flavorful and great. \n\nFor entrees, we got the pork chop, quail risotto, ribeye, and halibut. The best one out of the group was surprisingly the risotto (very flavorful and creamy). The pork chop was way too dry. The halibut was also dry. Can't remember much about the ribeye so it must have been neither amazing or horrible...just in the middle.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the mixed berry dessert, and it was still FROZEN. Like, wtf? Ice cream should be melting in your mouth. It was just weird and awkward. \n\nI wouldn't come back here again. I'm actually very surprised about the 4.5 overall rating.

It is such a great restaurant to have in the neighborhood but also worth traveling for.\n\nI haven't been to Frascati in quite some time but was happy to see all my favorites still on the menu with some excellent additions. I always start off with the bread salad. My bf said, \"Why don't all places make croutons like this?\" The bread in the bread salad is soft grilled bread. You don't get that hard crunch but that soft bready texture with the rest of the salad. It's one of my fave salads in the city. They offered a lobster appetizer atop a portebello mushroom. The lobster was sweet and tender.  Entrees include something for everyone - lamb, duck breast, steak, fish, risotto. I always get the duck so I decided to try something new and went with the lamb. I was definitely very happy with my dish. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and thick and tender. The steak was also full of flavor and juicy. Portion sizes are great. \n\nNow for the best thing on the menu - the black and white bread pudding. OMG...not only the BEST bread pudding ever but probably one of the best desserts I have ever had. It was warm, chocolatey and luscious. The homemade hazelnut ice cream paired superbly with the chocolate. I think I could come back just for this!", "author": "Josephine H."}

We had a table near the window so we got to see the \"cable-car outside the window\" view that they advertise on their website.  And the food was really good!\n\nWe started with the grilled bread salad and the gnocchi.  When the bread salad came -- we ordered it without olives, and they mistakenly brought out a salad with olives, but they quickly fixed the problem -- it looked more like a caesar salad with lots of croutons.  However, when we ate it, the bread was grilled very nicely and the flavors were very good.  The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and very tasty too, although I wish the gnocchi-to-vegetable ratio was a little bit better!\n\nFor entrees, we had the grilled duck breast and the pork chop.  The duck breast came with a nice duck hash and the piece of duck with crispy skin on it was very good, but the breast piece was a little bit underseasoned.  It came with a very good blackberry sauce but a little bit more salt or spice in the duck itself would have been nice.  The pork chop, however, was awesome.  It was a pretty thick piece of meat, but it was suprisingly moist throughout.  The polenta underneath the chop was very tasty and their apple-slaw-ish thing that accompanied the pork was very complimentary.  \n\nWe ended with the bread pudding, which was SOOO good.  Even though I had no room in my stomach to eat it, we almost finished it.  It was very chocolately and the bread had a very good consistency.  It wasn't too mushy and bread, ice cream, and sauces all worked very well together.  \n\nWhen I go back -- and I will be going back -- I would probably have the bread salad and pork chop again, and then give some other good-looking things on the menu a try.  Highly recommended.", "author": "Pilan C."}

The pork chop was definitely disappointing.  It was dry and tough to cut.  I also thought the demi glace that came with it was nasty.  The \"smashed potatoes\" were homemade hash browns.  If you want a good pork chop try NOPA or even Hillstone.  The pork chop here was disgusting.  My sexy woman ordered the seafood risotto.  It was delicious.  Definitely the best dish of the night.

The location, the windows, the reviews, the neighborhoody feel- all of these components seemed like part of a perfect recipe for a new date spot and a out-of-towners restaurant recommendation, but last night, my hopes were just that: hopes. \n\nWe were 2 couples, with one of the couples being out-of-towners, so we thought a cozy nook like this where they can see the street car go by would be perfect. We were seated upstairs in the back, which would have been great if we wanted a quiet romantic dinner, but as a group we felt isolated from the action and could not see the hustle and bustle of the street. \n\nThe service was about average- attentive and informative, what you would expect.\n\nWe started with the gnocchi- one of the recommendations from server. The aromas and colors were tantalizing- but there was no flavor in the perfectly cooked gnocchi. Maybe some garlic, salt, pepper- something was missing in the sauce and I felt like continuing to eat this dish was basically a waste of stomach space. The boys also shared the appetizer special for the evening- the pork terrine. Neither raved about it. \n\nI had the Roasted Chicken- juicy on the inside, crispy skin on the outside, served with fingerling potatoes, onions, and artichokes. It was yummy and large portions, but I kept thinking to myself that I could pay $8 at Whole Foods or the Farmers Market to get this same chicken (rotisserie-yum!) versus this $26 chicken. So, although my stomach was satisfied, my conscious was not. The other entrees ordered included the pork chop and steak. The presentation of the pork chop was spectacular with the perfect grill marks. However, the tomato-y sauce served with it was an odd combination. \n\nThe two perks of the experience was the wine list and dessert- our Apple Cobbler was warm and gooey served with a large vanilla scoop of ice cream- I guess I could have had just wine and dessert and would have been a happy camper! \n\nOur total bill was well over $300 (3 apps, 4 entrees, 2 bottles of wine, 2 after dinner drinks)- and although still a pleasant evening, I don't think I would go back to Frescati, no matter how much I wanted to love it.", "author": "Rena Z."}

The staff was super-attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and winelist.  We took our waiter's recommendations on everything and couldn't have been happier with the results.  \n\nWe started with the gnocchi and bread salad and both were great. I highly recommend the gnocchi.  It's not smothered in cream sauce like a lot of places and is perfect.  The porkchops with the apple salsa were awesome and the potatoes were top notch.  My wife had the duck which was also very good.  Although I thought my chops were much better.  We ended up just getting wine by the glass, but the house wines were all very good.  I didn't spend much time looking at the entire winelist, but they seem to have a decent selection.\n\nAll said and done, Frascati was a great choice.  It's casual and elegant at the same time, and has that nice cozy feel of a Russian Hill neighborhod bistro.  Definitely good for a romantic date, or dinner for 4...I wouldn't go over that number as this is not a good place for a group dinner.  The one downside is parking, so save yourself the trouble and cab it.", "author": "Bryan B."}

Since I was ordering the lamb, our waiter suggested the gnocchi appetizer would make the perfect setup. I took his advice, and at the last second requested chef to use only a little truffle oil. Boy! Was I glad I made that request! Past experience has show that truffle oil can overpower EVERYTHING. And when I walked in the restaurant, that was the 1st smell to hit my nose.\n\nThe gnocchi were perfect! Tender little pillows of potato pasta with a perfect assortment of garden veggies (fava beans, spring peas, leeks, tomatoes, chervil, garlic) combined with the lightest touch of truffle oil was amazing. We did lick the plate clean!\n\nFor our mains: Hers was the blue-nose sea bass with clams, mussels, shrimp and Spanish chorizo.

My complaint is for the service. This is not the place to go to celebrate a special occasion, as they do not take notice or don't have time to accommodate special requests or occasions. Wonderful food (my husband's favorite meal in the city), service so-so, special occasion location=definitely NOT.\nThe first time my husband and I ate here it was fabulous but it was for our wedding anniversary and I had asked them for a quiet, romantic table. Coming from a food service background (10+ years) I understand that accommodating special requests isn't always possible, but should be taken into account. So when we were promptly seated (in the empty restaurant at 6:30pm on a Friday) in the very center of the room...I was a bit perturbed. No mention of celebration. Loved the food so decided that even with the lack of concern for guests' wishes or requests on very special occasions, we would return. \nLast week was my birthday. My husband made reservations at Frascati well in advance (noting the special occasion again in the reservation). Again, food was wonderful (especially the clams, the duck and the steak), but no mention of the special occasion. Two strikes doesn't make this place a desirable location for a special celebratory meal...maybe we'll try for a third, but next time we won't be hoping any sort of special treatment.\nGo, and enjoy the food, it is wonderful.", "author": "Katie R."}

A friend of mine has lived on Russian Hill for eons, and one day she mentioned to me this great new restaurant that she has discovered around the corner.  Basically, every time I go into the city to see her, we go to Frascati.  Occasionally we break out of our rut and try someplace else, but in the end we always return.  I've probably eaten there over 20 times since whenever it opened, and only once was the experience not perfection, and that was when they refused to serve us mashed potatoes despite all our begging and whining because \"they did not have enough potatoes.\"  (!)  But we forgave them.  Frascati serves delicious, hearty, comforting food cooked to perfection that does not overwhelm you with quantity and grease.  I eat very little red meat, but when some is on the menu at Frascati, it's got my name on it.  When they actually prepare mashed potatoes, they are heavenly.  My friend and I usually split a chocolate bread pudding after we've stuffed ourselves with the main course (generally taking home half of the meat) and by then we are so done you could stick a fork in us.  Frascati is a wonderful, cozy little North Beach/Russian Hill neighborhood bistro, and I highly recommend it.  It's also good for out of town visitors because the surrounding neighborhood is as charming as it gets.", "author": "Lira K."}

The combination is a success in my book.\n\nMy plan to surprise my husband with a romantic dinner at Frascati's was a 100% success!  We enjoyed the location, atmosphere, and service.  Located right across a cable car stop, its a charming way to arrive to your dinner.  Close by is a wine bar where you can enjoy a glass of wine, sake, etc. before your reservations.  The venue itself is intimate, with two levels.  For family dinner, chose the lower level.  The upstairs is small, overlooking the kitchen and lower level tables, making your dinner a unique experience.  Our waiter was from our hometown!!!! Small world...\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I agree potato gnocchi is delicious but what stands out for us was the duck confit salad, roasted chicken and porkchop entrees.  Let the wait staff pair your meal with your wine, they do a great job!  Although my husband says 'try', I would skip the bread pudding and hazelnut ice cream pairing.  Maybe venture out and try another desert on the menu?  I felt the night we were there, chocolate pudding was overpowering the gentle hint of hazelnut in our ice cream.\n\nTake a walk around the neighborhood after your meal.

Gnocchi is amazing, perfect little pillows with slight hints of truffle. The bread salad is good, but nothing to write home about...wasn't what I expected. It's basically a Greek salad with softer fresh \"croutons\" mixed in. It's good, but nothing outrageously special.  We had the duck and the pork chop. The duck had crispy skin and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The spaetzle was an interesting side that we don't see often with duck and was quite good. The pork chop is perfect. The marinade really soaks into the meat. It's tender and flavorful. Top 3 pork chops I've had. The chocolate bread pudding with their homemade chocolate peanut butter ice cream was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-19", "description": "UPDATE - 4 STARS\n2007\n\nSo, one year later, my lady and I returned to the scene of the crime to celebrate her 23rd birthday.  Aside from a few minor menu changes, Frascati was pretty much the same as we'd left it one year earlier.  This time, however, was slightly lackluster compared to the wonderful experience we had on our first trip.  \nFor appetizers we ordered the duck trio and the seared ahi with spicy fennel salad.  The duck trio was a dish we both remembered very fondly from our first visit, but this time around it completely underwhelmed.  The duck roulettes (a dish we craved for weeks after the first time around) was a bit dry, stringy and quite bland.  The seared ahi was tasty because ahi is always delicious and the fish was great quality, but the preparation lacked flavor and cohesion...the spicy fennel salad tasted like poorly made kim chee or bad cole slaw.  Both dishes we could have lived without.   \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the bass and my beautiful woman ordered the steak.  The blue nose bass came in a delicious saffron-tomato sauce with clams, mussels, shrimp and spanish chorizo.  This was definitely the stand out dish of the night.  The bass was cooked to perfection, with a crisp, tasty outside and a tender, meaty center.  The flat iron steak had a great taste, but was served incredibly rare (the supposed medium-rare preparation was basically just seared on the outside and completely raw in the center).  We asked to have it remade, cooked to medium this time, which they were more than happy to do for us with no trouble.  When it returned, however, it seemed to be cooked exactly the same as the first time.  Not wanting to return the dish a second time (and figuring that was just the way the chef intended), we stuck with it.  Aside from the chewiness of the raw beef in the center, the all around taste was great, we only wished that we could have gotten it prepared to our taste a little more.  \nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate bread pudding which was yummy, but not much more spectacular than the chocolate lava cakes I get from Trader Joe's for a fraction of the cost.  \nAll around, we had a great time at Frascati the second time around regardless of the few shortcomings.  Fair warning though, if you're slightly \"alternative\" looking or a race other than the standard white or asian that usually traverses the wealthy neighborhoods of San Francisco, expect to get stared at a fair amount by snobby diners who probably think you're invading their turf.  Not everyone that dines at Frascati is that way, but don't be surprised if you feel you have to tell some old white lady that you're going to have to start charging a fee if she continues to oggle you.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - 5 STARS \n2006\nJuly 31st was my wonderful girlfriend's birthday.  Unfortunately, as things go, we ended up having a really big fight that day.  When i say it was a big fight, I really mean that it was BIG...really bad.  So bad, in fact, that it's hard to imagine that we could have carried on after it, but nonetheless, that night I took her to Frascati, as I'd had planned to for several weeks before hand and regardless of all the negativity, we had an amazing time.  The food was perfect!  \nI don't know whether this review is a testament to our incredible relationship or the amazing food at Frascati, but I know that this restaurant will always have a special place in my heart because of that night.  I honestly can't think of a single thing I would have changed about the dinner we had.  It was absolutely perfect.", "author": "c o."}

We walked in a full half hour before our reservation on a busy Saturday night expecting to have a glass of wine at the bar while we waited, only to be seated immediately in a lovely window seat. The service was prompt without being rushed, and our server was incredibly helpful when it came to ordering. We started with the gnocchi with butternut squash and leeks which was incredible, and the steak tartare, which also didn't disappoint. Then I had the duck breast with herb spaetzle and huckleberry sauce - phenomenal - and the man had a bass dish which he thoroughly enjoyed. We weren't going to get dessert since we were so full, but we stayed to digest over another glass of wine. Of course after the fourth glass of the evening, I brilliantly decided that I wanted to blow out a birthday candle. So I ordered the famous chocolate bread pudding which came with a healthy scoop of hazelnut ice cream. Man, I totally understand the hype now. It was so f-ing delicious that despite being completely stuffed, we pretty much licked the plate clean. It was totally worth the wait, but now that it's my new favorite restaurant, you better believe I'll be there often.", "author": "Victoria L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-15", "description": "I've had my eye on Frascati for quite a few months now, as I've heard wonderful things about this little Russian Hill gem. And being in the heart of the adorable restaurant row on Hyde street, there was only so long I could wait...\nSo I planned ahead (this place is popular, call in advance if you want a table on the weekend) making a reservation for my family for Father's Day. We arrived at 6:30, and were immediately seated at an upstairs table on the edge of the balcony. Although the space was relatively small, the noise level was not terribly deafening (I recently read an article in the Chronicle as to the atrocious noise level often found in SF restaurants) and we were able to carry on a normal conversation without shouting. Digesting the menu is a task in itself- so many delightful sounding choices! We decided on sharing the corn and morel risotto garnished with mache as an appetizer, my mom having the roasted half chicken with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and onions, the father having Alaskan halibut, and me going for the lentil soup and gnocchi with fava beans and peas for dinner. The service was incredibly slow- I don't know if it was just our particular waitress (although she was perfectly friendly when she actually showed up at the table) or the restaurant in general. This is my only complaint for the dining experience. We probably didn't get served for about an hour after seating, which was mitigated by the copious amounts of levain and french baguettes they provided during the wait.\nAnd now for the culinary experience: the risotto was tasty- not the creamiest risotto I've had, but definitely flavorful and light. The corn was incredibly sweet, even though it is not full blown corn season just yet. The morels were earthy and intense, and the rice was not completely mushy, so a slight crunchy texture was evident. The gnocci was also a treat- fava beans are a definite springtime favorite, and they definitely starred in this particular dish. The potato dumplings were the perfect consistency, slightly chewy and melt-in-your mouth delicious. The roasted chicken was seasoned well with rosemary and lemon, the skin crisp, and the meat tender. The artichokes and fingerling potatoes were a great accompaniment. As you may know, I don't eat fish, so I cannot comment on the halibut, but my dad did lick his plate clean, if that counts for anything. Portions here are not huge, so we had room for dessert, a definite must if you find yourself at Frascati. We ordered the black and white chocolate bread pudding, which our waitress assured would be enough for the three of us to share. Maybe she didn't know how much we love chocolate. Or bread pudding. Oh my god, this pudding was amazing. Not as custardy as some, but intensely chocolatey  with crisp bits on the outside and gooey chocolate seeping from the inside. Chunks of white chocolate were interspersed throughout the concoction. A huge scoop of home made vanilla bean ice cream garnished the dish, which was subsequently drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauces. Pure heaven. We wolfed down the entire dessert in under a minute, all of us wishing we had ordered two. But enough is enough, and since I at least, hadn't done my ritual 6 mile morning run, figured it was best to stop. In summary, Frascati is a charming upscale restaurant with delicious five star food and a five star neighborhood. However because the service was so slow, I must remove on of the stars...but don't let that stop you from checking this place out, I am sure you'll enjoy it as much as we did.", "author": "Kate A."}

We ordered \"Sauteed Brussel Sprouts\" for appetizer, carrot-orange bisque and double the size of the Gnocchi for the Entree....both the Entree and the Appetizer portions were decent but neither of them had enough salt - I have definitely eaten better Gnocchi elsewhere.

Lovely risotto with wild rice that really gave it extra texture\n - Grilled pork chop: Great flavor, huge pork chop\n - Fresh parpadelle: Parpadelle was perfectly cooked\n - Alaskan halibut livornese: Butter good, great sauce\n - Vanilla bean pana cotta: Amazing, wonderful creamy texture, great flavor, MUST ORDER FOR DESSERT\n - Affogato: Lots of espresso on the side, tasted great with the gelato\n\nOverall, food was FANTASTIC.

The waiter had some great back-stories to the cheeses, the locations they are from, etc.  Served with delicious sides (almonds, dried apricots, figs).  The sommelier came right over to our table with suggestions and prompty brought our drinks (key element on a Friday night after a long week at work!).  I couldn't decide what entree to get and the waiter steered me in the direction of the pork chop, while my boyfriend got the lamb shank.  Both were DELICIOUS.  Cooked to perfection, served on the perfect amount of polenta & mashed potatoes, with delectible sides of brocollini and tomatoes.  I've never wanted to eat so slowly so I could savor each bite longer!   We had heard from here that the bread pudding was mandatory and we weren't disappointed.

I was not disappointed by any part of my dining experience at Frascati--an intimate place in the Nob Hill/Russian Hill area..  I recommend reservations.  The sound of cable cars rumbling added to a great SFO dining experience!  The first floor seating area is shared with an open kitchen--which made me that much more hungry from the delicious aromas; additional seating is available upstairs and the bathroom is about the size of an airplane restroom and is in the basement.  The wait staff was so pleasant and friendly!  The water and wine were never low in the glass(Red Zin, Neal Family '09).  The food was prepared quickly and WELL!.  I started off with the Bay Sardines appetizer--these are large and not the small ones I was expecting; however, no complaints!  I thoroughly enjoyed the Duck Confit Salad as the dried cherries were a surprise & absolutely paired well!  My first impression of the entree--Frutti di Mare Risotto-- with Prawns, Mussels, Clams, was that it was a small serving.  Wrong, very filling and amazingly succulent with all the flavors and textures blending yet each splendidly distinct!  Absolutely Delicious!  I ordered the sorbet and found it to be heavy and overly sweet for a sorbet..I did not finish it because it was too sweet.  This did NOT detract from my enjoyment of Frascati.

And doing so up and down hills is no fun. Our reservation was at 6:30 pm but we were held up in traffic and John, the host and, as we later found out, the owner, was gracious and reserved our table until we came. The place is quite lovely and quaint on a corner. The weather was just perfect and some people were seated outside. I noticed those who were not dressed as formally were seated outside but i'm not sure if this is always the case. The upstairs was not open yet, but from the looks of it it would've been lovely and even more romantic to sit there. Overall, the ambiance was pleasing, the server was attentive but not overly so, and the food was served in a timely manner. We ordered the Russet Potato Gnocchi (pronounced NO-KEY) and it was by far the best thing we had there. My boyfriend and I shared the Maple Leaf Duck Breast and the Grilled Pork Chop. We both agreed my Duck with the crisp salad on the side was a 4-4.5/5, but the Pork Chop is more of a 3/5 because of it's lack or flavor and dryness.

It was a spur of the moment decision and we walked in with no reservation fully expecting to be turned away. We let the man at the door (I think he was the owner) know that we didn't have a reservation and we were totally fine with being turned away but he was totally accommodating and asked us to give him a few minutes to check to see if he could squeeze us in. That was the beginning of the impeccable service for the rest of the night. He mentioned that another couple was really late and he was going to give them a call to see if they were going to make it and if not that we could have their table. I was really surprised that a restaurant wouldn't just give the tardy couple's table away but just then they walked in and we were prepared to be disappointed. However the host managed to squeeze us into another small table upstairs which was very generous of them since they were obviously packed and had many more reservations on the books. \nNow to the food, the food was incredible. It was everything we'd hoped for and more. We started with the tiger prawn risotto and a torchon of foie gras with a sauterne gastrique and some sauteed apples. The risotto was the most perfectly cooked risotto I'd ever had, the rice was creamy without being too heavy and dense and the cheese did not overpower the freshness of the tomato and spinach that was mixed in with the risotto. The foie gras was delicious, rich and buttery served with excellent toast points and the gastrique was the perfect counterpoint to the richness providing a light, sweet note to the dish. Both dishes were superb. Then for our main course we had the duck breast with herbed spaetzle and huckleberry sauce, hearts of palm and mushrooms, and the seared day boat scallops with crispy parsnips and a potato puree. My fiancee said the scallops were quite good and my duck breast was cooked perfectly medium rare with crispy skin. The huckleberry sauce went really well with the duck as it was sweet and tart at the same time cutting the richness of the duck. Lastly we had the white and dark chocolate bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream for dessert and it was incredibly decadent and delicious, even though I was stuffed I ate the whole thing. \nThroughout the whole night service was great and it really felt like the staff enjoyed working there and took pride in the food and you could really tell.

I booked the reservations on opentable and the only available time showed 5:30pm. This was a little early but I thought that I would plan a day in the city and stopping off at 5:30pm seemed reasonable. In the comments box, I noted that it was my bf's bday.\n\nAt around 2pm on the day of, we were at Fisherman's Wharf when Brian from Frascati politely called to confirm reservations. When we arrived to the restaurant at 5:30pm, it was completely empty so we thought we would walk around a bit and go back a little later since we were still full from lunch. We walked in at  around 5:40pm and the 2 tables by the window were taken. We met Brian who was deligihtful and wished J a happy birthday. We were seated in the upstairs balcony overlooking the kitchen and the dining area. I think this is the best seat in the house.\n\nFor starters, we had the veal sweetbreads and the cauliflower soup, both of which were very good. For our main course, I had the duck breast and J had the pork chop. I thought the duck was good but J really enjoyed his pork chop.\n\nNow, for dessert, we went for the chocolate bread pudding. Initially, I was a little disappointed because I was hoping that they would put a candle on the dessert but they didn't- oh well, no big deal. However, when Brian came upstairs to talk to one of the waiters he must have noticed that we didn't get a candle and he ran downstairs and immediately brought up a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a candle! He wished J a happy birthday and said \"... in case the bread pudding isn't enough...\" We thought this was wonderful of him and it's gestures like these that leave a lasting impression and distinguish a 5-star restaurant from all the rest. The vanilla ice cream, by the way, was absolutely delicious! Many other reviews have mentioned it, but the wait staff here really is excellent. I have been to other restaurants where the food was great but the service was stuffy and boring- you won't get that at Frascati.\n\nThanks to everyone at Frascati for making it a special day.", "author": "Vitamin C."}

We sat upstairs literally next to the wall and stairs in our own little place. It was perfect. I looked at the reviews and I believe the people who did not like the place did not order the correct dishes.\n\nAppetizer: Grilled Asparugus with Poached Duck Egg\nMmmmmmmmmmm... I never knew poached duck eggs were so delicious and the asparagus were cooked really well (usually places cook them too soft for me). \n\nMain Courses: Pork chop with Grilled white peaches and Flat Iron Steak.\nHands down the best steak I have ever had at a restaurant (and I love my steak). It wasn't marinaded in something gross but seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper and came with a delicious panzanella salad. However, the PORK CHOP was the best thing I may have ever tasted. They somehow cooked it so that it was so moist and flavorful. I could eat it every day of my life. \n\nDessert: Peach and Blueberry Crumble (?) with Vanilla Ice Cream.\nDelicious! It tasted so fresh. It was the perfect size to share.\n\nIf you are still debating whether or not to go....GO!!!!!\n\nBe careful: Parking is a b!

All dishes generally are expertly prepared variations of the standard protein (usually lamb or chicken) on carbs (pasta, lentils or rice) plating. A dish to recommend would be the bass (if they offer it).\n\nIf your tastes run on the milder side (ie you're more of a meat and potatoes person), then these may be your ticket. However, if you are looking for real foodiness, you will probably be disappointed.\n\nAlso, smaller point, but I did find the service to be a tad bit rushed for a romantic dinner place (my wife barely finished her salad and appetizer before the plate was cleared out and entree brought in). Normally, speedy is good, here its bad, as you're partially paying for table time.\n\nIn sum, great place for first dates, dinner out with mom/dad  visiting from the midwest, etc  that calls for good locale and an easily predictable fine dining menu.", "author": "Deuce B."}

It was served to me raw on the inside. Cool to the touch and raw. It looked like uncooked chicken on the inside and really grossed me out. Do people eat rare pork? And even if they do---shouldn't I have been asked how I wanted it cooked? I would not have chosen rare. I was embarrassed to send it back (my fault-which is why I still give it 3 stars) but now I really wish I had because I think I would have liked it. Instead I just ate around the edges...I could tell it had potential. We also got a wild boar parpadelle that was very good. We were seated right by the front door which kept opening and letting a very cool draft it. I would probably have a totally different opinion of this place had my pork been cooked and we were seated upstairs overlooking the kitchen. \n\n\nI would like to give it another shot but there are just so many good restaurants in this city I'm not sure I'll ever get around to it.", "author": "Sara S."}

A very cute restaurant with so much charm and a family run feel. We brought a bottle of fabulous wine and that was also a blast to drink. In terms of food, we had:\nHubby: Bread Salad-very good, but with more greens than I would have thought. Rack of lamb entree, he loved it, cooked perfectly, medium rare. Everything on the plate was superb.\n\nMe:Octopus Salad-delicious, I'd never had octopus but decided to try it and it was soooo good. I had the gnocchi appetizer made into an entree, and it was phenomenal. Usually gnocchi have a cream sauce but this was a very light parsley, truffle oil, and I believe lemon sauce. It was so good, I ate every last one because it wasn't as heavy as most gnocchi. Delicious!\n\nFor dessert we had the bread pudding which was good, but the real star was the peanut butter ice cream...unbelievable!! Go now, don't wait! Its also reasonably priced for what you get, I was beyond happy when we left and so was my husband. Can't wait to go back!!", "author": "Kristin L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-13", "description": "If you're in the mood for an intimate Mediterranean style dinner I would definitely recommend Frascati. I've been there three times now and have been very pleased every time. The service was outstanding and very accomodating. On my first visit we walked in around 9PM after a seating debacle at Cortez and although the place was packed they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is very small so seating might be an issue if you don't make a reservation. It can get a little loud, but the overall ambiance is very intimate. This is a great place to take a date. The food was not out of this world but it was certainly up there. I would certainly recommend this place especially if you're bringing a date.\n\n\n\n*Update*\n\nJust went here tonight again. I'd have to give this place a solid 4 stars as opposed to 5. Zagat rates their food as a 26 (quite high) but I'd honestly have to say they're more around the 24 range. Honestly it was a monday night so there were no 'specials' and some of the food may have been less then fresh. For example, I had the rack of lamb dish that they were currently serving and the spinach tasted as if it was a little over the hill (it was rather tough and chewy). The lamb itself was excellent but a bit gamey for my taste (they did not trim it too well). Granted I can sometimes be a bit picky with lamb... The appetizer was quite good (had the russet potato gnocchi). They did a rather good job not over doing the truffle oil as many places often over-do it. The dessert was nothing special but still quite good. The service was very attentive and polite. They started off serving our dishes rather fast so I requested to slow things down a bit and they were more than willing to do so. \n\nI've been to this place 4 times in my last 3 years in SF and chose to go here as my final restaurant (I move back to Boston tomorrow). I was pleased, but not particularly impressed. Nothing really stood out despite the fact that the food was very solid in regards to its quality overall. This is certainly a place worth stopping in if you enjoy food with a Mediterranean influence. It seems as if things may have gone a little downhill since the first or second time I've been there, but I would still certainly recommend them. The atmosphere is great as is the food. \n\nIt's important to note that when I review I do it far more subjectively in regards to the particular cuisine/restaurant. I may give a hole in the wall sushi restaurant 5 stars and give a location such as this 4. That is not to say that one is better than the other... rather when compared to other restaurants that hold themselves out in a particular manner 'this' particular restaurant rates somewhere around 'here.'\n\nGreat place. Certainly worth giving it a try. I've been happier, but still most certainly very satisfied with my dinner there tonight.", "author": "Jonathan Z."}

I was most impressed though by the way our waiter (Jesse) made up for forgetting our salad. He was straight-up and said he screwed up, apologized sincerely, and then promptly came back and said \"save some room for dessert, I'm going to bring you something great and chocolate.\"\n\nI've been given free \"apology desserts\" before but you know... sometimes they don't tell you they're bringing it for a while... or sometimes you feel like you have to check the bill and see if they charged you... the responsiveness and warmth we felt here was like being at a friend's place.

Wine to start was way to hot for a red (mine) and my wife's was like it just came out of the freezer.  It peeves me when you pay for a nice glass of wine but it's so cold you can't taste it.  Then the hamachi tartare - good quality tuna but too many onions (or scallions?) drowned out the flavor.  Second appetizer was this fig dish with some blue cheese, balsamic glaze and prosciutto - very creative and equally delicious.  For the entrees we went with duck and pork; both were really special.  I don't think I've ever tasted such a perfectly cooked, tender and well seasoned pork chop.  The duck breast was also fantastic, and the bed of treats under it had me polishing the plate.  For desert the black and white chocolate bread pudding is very worthy and plenty sizable for two.  Definitely recommend and will likely return for the cuisine and good service.", "author": "Matt C."}

We had a reservation for 4 on a Friday night at 6pm and we were seated right away.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and very attentive.  We had four different starters, all of which were outstanding.  I had the duck confit salad which was fantastic.  My dining companions raved about their mushroom bruschetta, smoked salmon salad, and the waldorf salad.  For our main courses, we had one fish dish which was good but not extraordinary, the duck entree, a fresh pasta special with pulled pork and papardelle, and the short ribs.  The pasta was the highlight of the entrees - perfectly seasoned and piping hot.  Large portion too.  The short ribs were the lowlight.  Too fatty to eat.  My mom had ordered this dish after raving about her mushroom bruschetta and couldn't eat the fatty meat.  The waiter took it away and insisted on bringing her another dish on the house so a few minutes later, he appeared with a gnocchi dish which was delicious.  They also didn't charge for the short ribs - super classy.  For dessert, we all shared the chocolate bread pudding with hazelnut ice cream and it was a dream!  Large enough for sharing and rich and delicious.  Atmosphere is nice and cozy, but a touch noisy.  Great place to take my parents from out of town.

We live in the neighborhood and eat out 3 or 4 times a week - well after three tries at Frascati they are out.  The food was fairly nice, not bad not great but oddly enough even after having returned three times in a short period of time we were still being treated as if they were doing a favor by letting us eat there. The waiters were without an exception condescending and finally when we stopped by to confirm a reservation while on a walk we were treated to a waiter who decided that it was more important to talk to a favored customer than even deign to acknoledge our presence while we waited in the door - sorry three strikes you're out - we're off to Luella's across the street where the food is much better and the staff very professional.", "author": "RJ M."}

The starters were great--had the gnocchi and brussel sprouts, both of which were very flavorful and yummy (the gnocchi is pretty heavy on the garlic).   Upon the waiter's suggestion, I went with the sea bass special (instead of the ahi--prolly a good thing for me b/c I'm not a huge fennel fan).  The sea bass was lightly pan fried, and served above a light mix of greens and barley, which were in a broth of clams, calamari, and sausage.  It was good, but not spectacular.  I was super excited about the much toted bread pudding...again, it was good, but both my dining companion and I thought it seemed more like a warm brownie...the hazelnut ice cream was delicious, though.  I liked Bix's chocolate bread pudding better.  Finally, service...well, it really wasn't there.  I'm okay with not-so-attentive waitstaff, but I do appreciate a good demeanor when they do approach you...I just didn't feel that here.  And, the hostess had to come clear our plates b/c she saw them sitting there for so long...anyway, decent restaurant, but didn't live up to the hype (for me).", "author": "Joyce L."}

The waitress would not stop raving about it and I wasn't in the mood for meat or fish and my 2 friends were already ordering the pork chops. So I went for it and it was SO tasty!! Good pick Miss Waitress. But first, the apps - we had the cheese plate and gnocchi. The gnocchi is a signature dish and it did not disappoint. It was perfectly rich with sweet corn, peas and a touch of truffle oil. The cheese plate was good, but I wish they were a little more generous with their portions. My 2 favorites cheeses were the Idiazaba,l a spanish sheeps milk,  and the Roaring 40's, a bleu cheese. For the entrees we had the chicken and pork chops. Like I said, the chicken was a huge hit. A bunch of other pple in the restaurant were raving about it too. The baked garlic peels were lovely. I smeared them on bread, on my potatoes, on my chicken! I sampled the pork chops too and can't wait to go back so I can order it as my entree. They do something with it for like 24 hours...marinate? pan roast? I can't remember, but they definitely take very good care of it. And for dessert, the chocolate bread pudding. I love bread pudding and this was one of my favorites. My only complaint - not every bite was rich & moist, there were a few bites in there that were a little stale/hardened. Overall, lovely russian hill spot.

Well, the place was a lot smaller than I expected, that didn't matter much, but just wanted to point that out. To the food, we ordered the Salmon Bruschetta for an appetizer. I didn't know the salmon was raw... a few bites out of the raw salmon made my stomach hurt. I don't what the hell that green pasty stuff was, but it made Olive Garden and Red Lobster's bruschetta taste so much better. Then onto our meal, we both ordered the Pork Chops, because that was the only thing on the menu that appealed to us and exactly what we've been craving for. It looked delicious! Eh, it was okay. The only thing that I can say was bomb was their chocolate cake a la mode with hazelnuts and caramel. SO GOOD! Other than that, though, won't be returning.", "author": "Elle C."}

Rather than go with an easy default that I had been to before I always love to try new restaurants (new to me at least). The easy middle point between her hotel and my pad would be Russian Hill where there is a plethora of good eats. I have heard for a while now about Frascati on the corner of Hyde and Green. When the weather is warm and the Indian Summer is in effect Hyde street is not a bad place to waste some time. This is definitely a restaurant you set foot in and say to yourself, \"ahh, San Francisco\". Just the way it is put together, the cable car track steps outside the door, the camaraderie of the patrons and the small loft upstairs was uniquely San Franciscan. As I walked up to our table of six on the second story I over heard a man say, \"this is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.\" Normally I would dismiss this as bystander banter but this man had a sport coat . . .  with elbow pads and we all know nothing says dining connoisseur like elbow pads. Not only was the food excellent from top to bottom but our waiter was the perfect complement to a good meal. They must send their staff to adjective camp because this guy could have been describing mud and I might have ordered it. No Pinot Gregio? Ah well, lets just get the one the waiter recommends, damn that was good. I had the Pork Chop and was not disappointed one bit. Decent size and excellent (I think I need to go to that camp) taste. The salient menu item of the night though was the bread pudding for dessert. You know when you bite into something and it tastes so good that your jaw locks for a half second? I think that is the eating equivalent of casino bells and whistles going off. Basically the restaurant was  saying, \"Congrats Mr. Papageorgio, you are the winner tonight.\" Seriously one of the best desserts I have ever had. Lets put it this way, it would take a very rare restaurant to get me to Tivo Game 7 of the ALCS and not be paranoid all night about the score.

Ordered a great bottle of Pinot which one of the waiters picked out which was very good, not extravagant though.  We had the Asparagus which was cooked nice, but nothing special on the flavor.  I had the mussels which were in a broth with sausage.  I found it to be not that hot so I felt I had to eat it quickly because by the end it was getting cold.  Overall, a good dish though and the mussels were very fresh.  The main dishes came too quickly.  Probably only a few minutes after we finished our apps so part of my 3 star rating is because of that.  I had the Halibut.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  The fish was the best part of the dish.  The sauce was great but not enough to go with the fish.  The salad below it didn't make too much sense.  It didn't really go well with the fish and the octopus was a little tough and chewy.

What a charming street with the patently SF architecture and cable car tracks with street-lining trees and a nice mix of quiet and Saturday gentle nightlife buzz. Set on the corner of Green, this little enclave is a joy to step into. It's a really warm, quaint, cozy feel with a nice vibe to it. The small wine bar and open-air kitchen give it a streak of modernity/trendiness I liked. Got there a little early but were seated nevertheless on the balcony overlooking the main dining area and kitchen. A fine spot to look around, enjoy the food and chat. Thanks to a very nice host.\n\nFood: I think the real critics would call this a \"well-appointed menu.\"  I consider the menu to be a awesome variety of entrees and clever assortment of appetizers and soup/salads. To wit: the entr\u00e9e list contained one of each type of animal (is that crass?). One steak dish, one venison, one chicken, one duck, one sea bass, one halibut, one vegetarian (sorry, folks), etc. Sure I missed a couple of 'animals.' I love this variety and I understand it changes as the website says so and its menu is different than the one currently in use. For apps and salad, went with the gnocchi platter and grilled bread salad. Normally I'm not a gnocchi fan but had a craving and found Frascati's to be in the upper echelon. And with truffle oil drizzled on it, what doesn't taste good? For entrees, went with the unique dish in the venison (double checked with our waiter and got the affirmative \"it's excellent) and partook in the rib eye steak of my companion.  Both were very tasty, reasonably-sized in their portions, and comprised of quality ingredients. I won't go delve into the taste details Iron Chef style as I just can't. Dessert: none.\n\nWine: Like the menu, the (by the glass) wine list is a good variety of types of wine. Well-selected. Like the food, wine critique is a shortcoming of mine, but the four different glasses of red wine we had and the remarks by our waiter were very good.\n\nService: I just can't believe these guys' timing. I was looking around for a little table cam they use. Drink order requested as soon as we were ready. Appetizers ditto. Entrees ditto ditto. Water, wine and bread refills done on point. Plates cleared and dessert menu placement swift swift.  Jesse was our main water and found him to be friendly, not intrusive, and very attentive. Good wine knowledge to boot. These guys work together well, are pretty cool, and have this meal service thing down pat.\n\nAfter this fine meal, which was a fair amount of food between every course, we were still able to make it down to Harlot and spend the rest of the night in comfort.

Every part of the meal we ordered seemed to have potatoes with it and that is what we continually oohed and aahed over.  The pan fried gnocchi was hands down the best I have ever had.  My husband had the duck for his entree and it was prepared in a way that made us really question if it was duck.  I don't know how to explain it, it wasn't bad, just different.  My husband adored the spaetzle that came with it and I think he would come back just for that.  It's been awhile since we were there, but I think I ordered the filet, which was great but pretty standard.  The potatoes that came with it were also excellent and very different from the other two we had tried.   For dessert we had the Warm Black and White Chocolate Bread Pudding but we got it with the vanilla ice cream because my husband doesn't like nuts in desserts.  It was a satisfying end to the meal.  \n\nWe went to this restaurant to celebrate our first anniversary in CA.  We were not disappointed.  I told the host when I called that day to make the reservation and he gave us the one table that sits next to the window so we could clearly see the cable car coming and going.  The neighborhood is cute and we enjoyed riding the cable car to and from the restaurant.  The wine list seemed reasonably priced and we were able to find a wonderful Ch\u00e2teauneuf Du Pape in our price range.  The place is small so I recommend reservations, but I don't think they are hard to come by.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Called Allegro but was shot down, we were gonna maybe just do  a few apps and drinks at the hotel bar when I decided to try Frascati at around 6pm, they said they were booked but we could come down and give it a shot but  they stop seating @ 9:45.  After a nap and a couple in room cocktails we realized we were starving and decide to try to make it there by 9:45, taxi only took like five minutes but when we rolled up the host first told us they were done for the evening, (it was almost 10)  I was  glad to see that the restaurant was actually full, I then noticed a couple leaving a cute table upstairs, he must've have seen me notice cause he then said \"you know what, if you can order kinda quick we can take you\" . They cleared it quickly and sat us with urgency but we never felt rushed or pressured at all. \n    We had immediate service picked an app and two entrees on the fly.\nWe had the bison carpaccio which was awesome, so tender it literally melted, seriously like changed sizes, couldn't really taste the white chocolate flakes but all the other flavor was amazing. After we finished the gf summed it up by saying \"Can I get  a stack of about a hundred of those?!\"\n   My girl went with the seafood fettuccine and I had the venison. Both were awesome! I hate pesto, yet I kept grabbing bite after bite of her fettuccine and every bite had several pieces of calamari, so much she even left some. My venison suggested rare to medium rare and was absolutely flawless. I'm so glad I didn't notice on the menu that it came with garbanzo beans cause I'm not usually a fan but the beans were even amazing. For dessert we had the white chocolate bread pudding cause I heard it mentioned on this site and it was  so good.\n One of the best meals I've had in along time accompanied by really friendly and helpful staff.  Went to a highly recommended restaurant in Napa the next night and felt so disappointed. We both agreed later that there was nothing really wrong with the place it just wasn't Frascati!", "author": "Derek S."}

No it was not a date night as i went 'solo' and would recommend going alone also if ur new in town.", "author": "jigi s."}

The only thing that was memorable was the cold lobster bisque with no lobster in it because I truly couldn't believe they would serve that.    How about a complimentary glass of champagne on such an occasion when charging 95 a head?", "author": "emily g."}

I have eaten here a few times and the food and service are both excellent.  We went here for my birthday last year and every staff person wished me a happy birthday (in addition to the candle on the dessert).  Last time we ate at the bar where, at some restaurants, service takes a dive, but again we had an excellent experience.  I appreciate the good wines by the glass as well. Highly recommended. \nA word to people who complain about parking -- I know that some places are difficult to park near and, after a bad experience outside the restaurant it may be hard to wind down and enjoy the meal, but you need to toughen up or stay out of the city.  Maybe you had to feed the meter every 20 minutes and for that reason wiil never go back, but don't make that a reflection of the restaurant itself.  Be an adult and pay for valet parking or a garage, or leave the house early and wear comfortable walking shoes. Thank you.", "author": "Kryss A."}

This restaurant dabbles in all these categories.  My dad happened to be in town on business and decided to drop by and take me to dinner.  We ate at Frascati, an excellent choice!  The ambiance was very comfortable, intimate, a good mood setting in order to get to know your fellow diner.  A great place for my dad and I to catch up.  I started with the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta...AMAZING!!!!  The salmon practially melted in my mouth.  The bread was grilled, the outside perfectly crunchy with an exquisite avocado spread.  The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, perfection!!!!  The salmon was smoked perfectly and had a creamy white sauce on top.  I cleaned my place to say the least!  I followed with an asparagus salad, it was good.  Nothing special or memorable about it.  I would go with something else.  My main course was the Halibut.  Perfectly seared and perfectly seasoned!!!!  It is served with beans and green beans, they compliment the fish amazingly!!!  I once again cleaned my plate, if it weren't for the other diners I would have been licking my plate clean!!!!!  We finished with the bread pudding.  Born and raised in the South I know my bread puddings and this one is one of the best I have ever tasted.  The hazelnut ice cream it is served with has great texture and to die for taste!!!  The chocolate bread pudding has a hint of coffee or espresso in it and really does the pudding good!!!!  Try this dessert because you will not regret it!!!!!  All in all Frascati is a place I will go back to time and time again to catch up with old friends and enjoy romantic dinners.", "author": "Katii S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-14", "description": "Went here for an anniversary after reading the Yelp reviews. We probably won't be going back. The manager was great, checking on us and making recommendations. The waiter was a bit pretentious, though I'm sure his french accent didn't help. We had foie gras to start (with chenin blanc), it tasted like pate, cold on the inside, unremarkable. A mixed green salad, bitter greens and stinky cheese, good, but nothing special. We had a bottle of zin which we were a bit disappointed in, but we didn't ask for recommendations (since I was sure he'd try to sell us something expensive), so it wasn't their fault. Then lamb shank, very tender, but dry at the edges and quite fatty, with a flavorless sauce, and duck breast, too burnt on the skin side, with delicious spaetzle. Affogato for dessert was good. Ambience was fine, sat by the window, watched the cable cars roll by. After tip, $185 for two people. If I'm gonna be spending that kind of scratch, I want better.", "author": "Matt G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-05-03", "description": "We have always loved, loved this restaurant for years but we recently had a notably bad experience, in service.  We have our daughter's birthday celebration dinner and we brought a little cake.  Our waitress offered to cut the cake and add ice cream to serve.  I expected that we would be charge for the ice cream and some nominal serving charge.  We were charged $9 per person for the service charge PLUS the scoop of ice cream at $4 person.  For six people, we were charged app $90 for serving of the ice cream!  I mean buying separate individual desserts for 6 people would of been less costly.  I mentioned this to the manager, that we had been patrons of the restaurant for years, and I thought the charge was a little over the top, considering this was a small cake, just for six people to celebrate our 8 yr old daughter's birthday dinner.  He basically admonished me for not knowing the BRING YOU OWN CAKE policy!!!  I told him that this was a little last minute request of our 8 yr old daughter and basically, he was not accommodating at all.  I told him that this entire process left a bad taste in my mouth, especially considering that I had told him when I made the reservation that Frascati is one of our favorite places where we often have dinners there to celebrate big milestones in our family.", "author": "L J K."}

They reserve the front 2 tables for walk-ins and there is bar seating. The host was friendly - ran out the door as we were leaving to wish us a good night. The waiter was friendly and attentive as well. I'm not sure if the menu changes daily/weekly. We ordered the Risotto with Italian Sausage and it was excellent to start as an appetizer. We both ordered a salad to start off - mixed greens with goat cheese and persimmons. Perfect portion and the persimmons were a nice touch. We got the rack of lamb - cooked to perfection and the cod, which was buttery and creamy. For dessert we ordered the chocolate bread pudding - it was to die for. It came out gooey and warm with a nice crust on top and some hazelnut ice cream. Can't wait to go back. Would recommend getting a reservation to avoid the wait on a weekend.", "author": "Renee C."}
