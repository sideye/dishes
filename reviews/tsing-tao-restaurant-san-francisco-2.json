On top of all of this, they are using a false name on UberEATS to attract unwitting customers. They're calling themselves \"Japanese Curry House\". No such business exists in the city.

Sure, it's nothing fancy, but it definitely gets the job done, and I've always really loved that they do each dish well, not to mention offer brown rice as an option.\n\nWhy did I suddenly feel the need to offer a review?  Well, I just received AWESOME service from this location!!\n\nAs a nice Jewish girl, I recently celebrated a very important date on the Jewish calendar:  Chinese Food and a Move Day!!  That's right, every December 25th, my mouth waters at the idea of \"Kosher\" pork chow mein and honey walnut shrimp...and this year was no different!\n\nBecause I'm fairly anal-retentive and was planning to have a bunch of fellow celebrants over for the occasion, I decided to try and place an advance order through their online ordering.  I selected for my order to arrive at 3:30 pm on Christmas Day.  At 3:28 pm exactly, my phone rang from the callbox at the front of my building, and a delivery guy announced his arrival...Wow, talk about prompt!!!\n\nThe delivery guy was super-polite, friendly, and went out of his way to thank me for the tip!\n\nEverything in my order was there, and still hot!!  There were ample napkins and chopsticks and sauces included, and everything was packed well so that nothing had spilled!\n\nSince everything smelled and looked so delicious, I couldn't resist nibbling one of the fried crab pockets (their version of crab rangoon) before my guests arrived...DEEELISH!!!\n\nIt should also be noted that the restaurant allowed me to order off-menu:  Even though they do not include Shrimp With Lobster Sauce on their menu, I requested it via my online order.  An employee called me to verify that I still wanted it, and confirmed that they'd happily make it...WIN!!!!\n\nWhen it comes to Chinese food delivery, Tsing Tao cannot be beat!  While I've definitely tried my share of other restaurants over the years, there's a reason I continue to order from Tsing Tao after 10 years...They do what they do exceedingly well!!!  I highly recommend this restaurant!\n\nAlso, seriously?  Try the crab pockets.", "author": "Amy L."}

I hate when I order Chinese food and get 90 percent veggies and 10 percent meat.  Not here.  It is a ton of chicken and maybe 3 pieces of broccoli.  The chicken actually tastes like chicken and you can actually see that it is chicken.  So many places have their meat overly fried to where you can't tell what is inside.  This is probably enough chicken for 6 people.  I also ordered a small brown rice: they packed the rice to the brim and it was fresh.  I ordered steamed pork buns: it comes with 2 pork buns and they are very large.  I have only had these maybe twice before so I really can't judge too much, but they tasted good to me!\n\nI ordered a 2nd time and this time we had the orange chicken and Mongolian beef.   The food came before the expected time and piping hot.  The chicken was again, lots of chicken.  The Mongolian beef was extremely delicious and had a good amount of spice to it, but the pieces were really small so they seemed hidden in the veggies.\n\nI would definitely order from here again!  So far, my favorite things to order are the pork buns and the Mongolian beef.", "author": "M M."}

Now, that wouldn't be a big deal except that I have yet to see ONE employee wash their hands after returning from their umpteenth cigarette of the day... they just go right back into the kitchen and handle food.\n\nIn an average hour during an average day, you can count no less than 10 smoke breaks being made by the small crew of employees here. Don't believe it? Go ahead a stake out a spot across the street and see for yourself.\n\nThe kicker is that they stand in the doorway of the laundromat next door and do this, sometimes in groups of 2 or 3. Even when the laundromat door is closed the stench of smoke gets trapped under the awning and lingers forever, added to by the incredible frequency of smoking these folks engage in. \n\nNow, even if you're a smoker, you probably understand that having smoke saturate your newly-cleaned clothes is not cool. \n\nWhen I first started politely asking them to relocate just a little farther away and not under the awning, I got responses ranging from total non-comprehension to out-and-out confrontational rudeness. Now I just tell them that SF law prohibits smoking within 15 feet of a doorway and that I'd be happy ask the SFPD next door to come over and enforce the statute... then they just scowl and comply, but only for a little while and then it's back to cancertown.\n\nIn conjunction with the reports of roaches in the food (!) it should be a no-brainer that this place and its employees are not clean. Do not patronize them.\n\nPS: Whoever marked that they're \"good for groups\" has obviously never seen the place: there's about 25 square feet of floor space and a counter. Without exaggerating you'd be lucky to get 6 people standing up in here at the same time. Again though, go see for yourself if you doubt what I'm saying.", "author": "Ronzlo L."}

The grease and breading actually made it kinda tasty, but this was not without it's consequences (I'll return to this part later.)  Lastly, I had BBQ pork fried rice.

The combination Wonton soup isn't that bad, although the pork is a little dry, but minus that, it's average.

The taste of oil was so overwhelming that the sauce did not matter.They added a few red chillies to make it 'spicy'. Could not taste the chillies as the oily taste took over. Avoid the spare ribs at all cost. The meat was gamy and looked old. I took one bite and chucked the rest.\nOn top of that they use really cheap plastic delivery containers that WILL let out toxins if hot food is added to them and plastic containers were literally tearing apart when i recieved my order. \nAvoid this place at all costs.

I told him that I didn't order anything and I hung up.  He kept calling over and over again and I picked up again and said I ordered food and received it and signed for it already and that I didn't order anything else.  He kept saying that he had a delivery for me and I had no idea what he was talking about.  So I went downstairs and basically, they had given me the wrong order.  Instead of orange chicken they gave me something else (possibly sesame chicken?).  So he had orange chicken for me!  I felt really bad because I was kind of rude to this delivery guy over the phone.  I couldn't understand him and I assumed that they had made a mistake-and thought I had ordered twice or something.

I ordered the pork pot stickers, and they told me I'd have to wait 15-20 minutes because of it, which of course means they were made to order. That made all the difference; the pot stickers were excellent - and I'm the biggest dumpling snob out there - freshly steamed, and then slightly pan-fried while they were still soft.
