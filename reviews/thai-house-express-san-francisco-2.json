I've never been to thier restaurant so this review is just for the food delivered. Lets start with the plus. Their curry both the yellow chicken and pumpkin curries are good. The seafood pad kee Mao is pretty good too. All their dishes are a very good generous amount. Some places only give you 30% less than what you see in the picture. Plus their delivery came on time. \n\nNow for the negatives. The pad see ew was very disssapointing. First I ordered beef but got chicken which isn't a big deal. The problem was the flavor. It was so bland. Ive never had pad see ew that bland before. I had the noodles broken but at lease the taste was there. Previous review had also commented on the same issue but I like to taste it myself before judging. They definitely need to enhance the flavor more. \n\nThe pad thai and papaya salad was ok nothing wow. Definitely had better. Overall my experience was ok. Would I order again? Sure! I mean their curries are good and the seafood noodle plus for the amount you pay, they do give a good amount of food.", "author": "Christy V."}

In fact, I even referred to Jamie anonymously as \"my dining companion\" in that review, which shows you how long it's been. What may have caused the lengthy sabbatical was a piece of twine that he found in his dish. I was so nice back then that I still gave the proprietors four stars, even though I recounted the incident in painstaking detail. Nowadays I'm not so nice. I'm more interested in being fair which is why I felt a need to share our recent marginally disappointing experience.\n\nJamie was surprisingly the one who suggested our spontaneous return visit. Service felt rushed and indifferent the moment we arrived. We were seated near the window crowded between two tables for two, all four of whom were already quite settled into their meals. I tried to squeeze myself onto the banquette without incident, but it was a chore that only heightened the nervous energy of the server. Once settled in, we shared an appetizer, the $6.95 Corn Cakes which were OK but nothing more in flavor or texture with a dipping sauce of sorts made up of cucumber slices, ground peanuts and red onion (photo: http://bit.ly/1P1rMWf).\n\nWe then shared Jamie's favorite Thai dish, the $7.95 Pad Mee Kao (Drunken Noodles) with chicken, onions, carrots, chili, Chinese broccoli and basil, and I have to admit it was rather on the soupy side. No twine but no definable texture either, just a soppy affair that fell short of satisfying either of our palates (photo: http://bit.ly/1CA6b0E). Better was the $9.95 Pineapple Fried Rice just because it was comfort food of the lowest order as it was mixed with eggs, cashews, raisins, onions, carrots and chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/1CT6gOl). It was good but so was my dad's SPAM fried rice and he didn't charge me ten bucks for a heaping plate of it. There were no strings attached with this visit.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...Thai food with little commitment for providing distinctive flavors\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...crowding us in a corner didn't endear us to the surroundings\nSERVICE - 2 stars...quite hurried and below average when it came to being responsive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...close call but I'll leave it at three stars for a restaurant on a discernible decline", "author": "Ed U."}

They have more \"authentic\" flavor than Thai Chef on 18th Street, which has a overwhelming inclination on putting lots of sugar in their food.\n\n*Tom kha gai:  Coconut milk and lime juice seasoned with ginger root and cayenne pepper create a spicy broth for this Thai-inspired soup with strips of white chicken, cilantro and mushroom. Overall it's good but could be a bit less watery.\n\n*Yellow curry:  usually good, flavorful and spicy. My friend complained that his edition in that evening was bland and tasteless.\n\n*Thai beef: tender and barbequed to medium, beef was marinated well. Be aware of that green chili sauce, it's hotter than wasabi.\n\n*Gai ka prow:  Stir-fry chicken with basil. Along with Pad Thai, this is a staple of the Thai meal. Order it mild if your stomach doesn't agree with spicy food. I go for medium. Basil flavor is very opulent. Perfect to eat with jasmine rice. \n\nThe hot tea is the same herbal tea used in Thai iced tea minus the carnation milk and sugar. It's good for mitigating the flamey tongue!\n\nService is alright but could be more attentive. My gai ka prow didn't come with everyone else's food so I was poking at my friends' dishes.

Had I reviewed it last summer after several visits with friends in town, I would've gladly given it 5 stars back then.  But the wait staff has changed AND something peculiar is apparently happening in the kitchen too.  \n\nOn Jan 2 with a friend, ordered full dinners, including soup, appetizers and wine.  Appetizers were satisfactory.  However, dinner (Pad Kee Mao) was spiced as if meant for waking the dead -- or killing the living.  Clearly the new wait staff's limited command of English played a part here.  Unlike in the past, where the wait staff as well as the owner were keen on helping customers with \"Thai hot\" \"Thai medium\" vs \"American hot\" \"American medium\" etc, the guy we got only had stock phrases at his command.  So for safety's sake (I was not in the mood to walk out of that place with \"ass fire\"), we ordered \"mild\"...and in return we got HOT.  OK, I could survive that -- I had wine and water to wash it down.  Plus anyone can make a mistake, and neither me nor my friend were in the mood to make a stink.  We ate what we could.\n\nThen the bill came.  I paid, and left a decent (approx 22%) tip.  We still had half full glasses of wine, so we took a bit of time to finish our drinks over pleasant chat, as we hadn't seen each other in months.  And it's at THIS point that Thai House REALLY fell, from a former 5-star to 2:  Not five minutes had passed following my giving the waiter back his check tray with the ample tip, when he came up to us -- this with our wine glasses still filled 1/3 -- \"You done? Need table for other party!\" he blurted.  I stood up and said, \"YEAH, WE'RE DONE -- AND WON'T BE COMING BACK.  Let me give you some advice, bud, since you're CLEARLY new at waiting tables: you DO NOT rush your customers out if you plan on having them come back, AND you don't embarrass them in front of other customers\"  We got up and left.\n\nI have no idea if he understood any of what I had just said to him, but on his way back to the kitchen he grumbled and mumbled in Cantonese (yes, I do know Cantonese enunciation vs. Thai) -- no slam against Chinese waiters, btw -- I've had many delightful ones in SF.  My criticism of this young-ish guy was in his final manner toward us -- clearly unprofessional and inappropriate.  Thai House would do well to keep their eyes on this chap for corrective action, lest he costs them even more business.  Pretty sad, really.", "author": "Gabe K."}

The staff were also quick to seat me, as well as to take my order. Unfortunately I was more impressed with the mellow atmosphere than with my dish.\n\nI ended up ordering the salmon dish with vegetables and red curry sauce. I asked the waiter if the fish was grilled. He assured me that it was. He also said that he'd put less sauce on the fish. I was a little disappointed when the dish came out and the salmon had some sort of fried batter on it and the dish was swimming in the sauce. I tried to remove the some of the batter off and eat it - but I wasn't all that impressed with the actual quality of the salmon. Since I was in a rush, I decided it was a sign that I was supposed to eat light, and I just stuck to the vegetables. I have to admit that the red curry sauce was very flavorful (though to tell you the truth  - I've never had a Thai curry sauce that I didn't like) The staff were prompt at bringing the bill, but they didn't seem too concerned that the main portion of my dish was primarily left untouched. \n\nJudging by the sauce in my dish, and seeing what other tables' ordered looked like - I am sure that Thai House Express has some superb dishes.

Then, he apologized and gave me a fake smile. What have we done to this bitch?! The horror didn't stop from there, then he sent the bill to our table even without us asking for it. This is hours before they close. Still, I gave him a good tip.

I ordered mine with thin rice noodles. The broth was a real beef broth, one that you know they made in and cooked for hours; it was that flavorful.

Perfectly lemony and there's hardly ever any of that sediment debris at the bottom ruining the last sips of broth. The som tom salad is also delightful. They even add little shrimps to the top of the papaya slivers. We asked for spicy, but I think they think we can't handle it so it was more like medium. The service was great and they were super attentive and the place is sparkling clean and everything is white. The Pad Sew yew noodles were FUCKING COOKED PERFECT, but the sauce needed a little something extra. Now for the fun part.\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to break up with someone in a public place. For one, you'll enjoy your meal, and for two the soundtrack will be epic. They play the most horrendous music by female artists of the late 90's. And not the good kind, or even the popular run of the mill Shawn Colvin or Meredith Brooks variety either.

I am surprised to read yelp reviews that grumble about the service (except for the party that arrived five minutes before closing -- the place should have turned the party away and the waiter was wrong to blame the party when it was the restaurant who had the power to turn them away. The waiter should have directed his anger at the restaurant, not the customers).  We ate there around 7 p.m. on a Friday.

It's not pushed into all the hubbub of the Castro, and it might be something you miss. \n\nI came here with 3 other girl friends on a spontaneous dinner trip. As we walked in, it was confusing whether we were to seat ourselves or not, but a waiter from behind a counter bluntly asked us how many were in our party and waved us to a vague area. \n\nMy first and last impression of this waiter was that he was rude and annoyed, like he didn't want to be at work at all.  When I received a plate that was slightly dirty, he picked it up and rudely asked what was wrong with it, annoyed that I had asked at all. \n\nThere was another waiter though, who was much more likable. He was friendly and enthusiastic, and came to refill our water very often. \n\nThe ambiance was a little cold, with white walls and windows all around showing the fog, but it was warm and comfortable inside. There is half-booth seating parallel to the wall, a large wooden table for a large group, and smaller tables that litter the back area. The restrooms are placed in the back, up some stairs, but is very clean, I was impressed.\n\nThe food was amazing, but that could have been because we were hungry/starving. The portions, though were ENORMOUS, about 1.5 x more than I would have eaten. (Then again, the three of us all shared three large plates, so they might have been generous because they knew we were sharing.) \n\nAnyways, we ordered a beef Pad See Ew, a Pad Thai (noted as the best Pad Thai in town by the Bay Guardian), and a Gow Se-mee. \nThe beef Pad See Ew was good, but it looked like there was more beef and broccoli than anything else. The Pad Thai was delicious, and the Gow Se-Mee was my favorite. The gravy wasn't too thick or viscous, and I loved the texture of the noodles. \n\nIn addition, my friends ordered Thai ice teas, which they slurped down with gusto. They would've ordered more if it was less expensive for a cup. \n\nFor dessert, there are a lot of choices, including Fried Banana, but we ordered one that was on a flier in the restaurant: Sweet Rice with Mango. I was expecting some sweet rice with mango pudding or sauce on top, but they came out with a plate with actual mango pieces, which was good. The sweet rice had some coconut sauce on top, which we asked for more of (which was probably a mistake, because the extra sauce wasn't milky and sweet like the original). \n\nThe prices were as follows: Pad See Ew, $7.95; Pad Thai, $8.95; and Gow Se-Mee, $7.95, which was pretty affordable. The Thai ice teas were $3 each, and the dessert was about $6.25. The whole dinner came out to be ~$40, which was pretty good, and we had a whole box of leftovers.\n\nOverall, the food is great, but the service could be improved.", "author": "Vivian L."}

I've been a regular for a few years now and I love everything on the menu (well, everything that isn't fried-- a boy has to watch his figure!).\n\nAll the curry dishes here are fantastic, and an \"a la carte\" order with a side of rice is enough to satisfy a small elephant.  So couples, bicker over something else and agree on any one item on their menu if you don't want three nights of leftovers.  Besides, this strategy usually feeds two for less than $15!\n\nThe silver medalist here is their yellow chicken curry with extra potatoes, and the grand prize winner is (drumroll please....) pra ram with extra peanut sauce!  The most recent data shows that, upon first bite, this dish saves 3 of 4 couples from domestic disputes and tweens from severe bouts of depression.  No, but seriously, it's fantastic.\n\nIf you want great Thai food and decent service without Osha Thai prices, hop on over to Thai House Express!", "author": "Brendan S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-19", "description": "I came here for the first time this passed Friday with my partner and a group of friends. The atmosphere was pretty nice. The restaurant itself is outfitted on the bottom floor of an older San Francisco home in the Castro, thus, it's a bit on the narrower side and the tables are small. Luckily there was a table big enough for our party of 5, but anything more than that would've been an issue. The restaurant itself is modern with beautiful hardwood floors and large windows that let in lots of natural light. Despite being located in the Castro, the ambience was on the quieter-end. Our group was able to hold dinner conversation with no problems with noise or volume.\n\nThe servers were friendly enough, although, they didn't seem particularly attentive. For example, when one of the servers came to refill water, he noticeably missed a few of the glasses despite the fact that they were half-empty. Also, it took several attempts for us to get their attention even though we were seated right in front of the register.\n\nI'm not an expert on the authenticity of Thai cuisine. My partner and I ordered a Pad Se Ew and a Thai Fried Rice with Dungeness Crab as well as a Fried Tofu and a Fried Calamari. The Pad Se Ew was pretty good. It wasn't overly sweet. The Fried Rice was also fairly standard. The good part about the Fried Rice came from the generous helping of crab meat that came with it--a pretty good deal given that most Thai restaurants tend to skimp on the crab. The Fried Tofu and Fried Calamari were lightly fried and crispy, not overly greasy. Portion sizes for our entrees and our tofu were generous although the Fried Calamari was on the smaller-side.\n\nOverall, Thai House Express was good, but it didn't stand out any more than the average Thai restaurant.", "author": "Jeffrey P."}

The last time was this past May. Both times I was drawn for one dish: the crab pad Thai.\n\nWhat is great about this place is that it is clean, it is busy but never completely packed, and the servers are very fast, very accurate, and just very good. You don't wait for anything here.\n\nThe ambiance and decor fits, too. It has sort of clean, whitewashed feel to it, which works for its express character. You're having table service, but it is speedy and minimal, which is the intent. Nothing is overdone.\n\nThe food portions are generous. What I like about the crab pad Thai is its inventiveness. It is tender, savory, and the flavors work so well. It is one of must-haves for me when we visit the Castro.\n\nThe only drawback, and it is a very minor one, is the beer selection. There are only two that I recall. Perhaps that is in keeping the minimalist and speedy approach. Perhaps they could add one or two and still be fine. Either way, it's the only thing close to a drawback.\n\nThis is definitely one of the delights in the Castro. In an area were service has gone down hill, think of Harvey's just down the hill and how bad their servers have gotten, this place is an example of what fast, inexpensive dining should be. It's good, very good, and it does everything well.\n\nJust add a few more beers. That's all I want.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.", "author": "Mike H."}

It's tempting not to order 2 of these!\n\nThe pad thai is really great.

Someone suggested Thai food as it is both tasty and veggie-friendly, and so we made the minuscule mosey over to Thai House Express.\n\nThai House Express is a trendy looking place.  The decor is rather bare-bones, though the hip-looking people in their skinny-looking jeans and chunky-looking glasses tend to provide most of the visual stimulation.  And we had a lot of time to look around, as the wait for a table was surprisingly long.  We were given menus and were able to order ahead of time, which was nice.  But another group of the same size was seated first, even though they arrived after us, which was a little less nice.\n\nThe menu was extensive, and very vegetarian-friendly.  Pretty much anything can be made with tofu, and my friends ended up with piles of various vegetables on top of brown rice.  They looked (and, I'm told, were) super good.  We also got spring rolls and, perhaps to compensate for being so darn healthy, the corn cakes.  Not being one to pass up curry, I got the gang koor goong: shrimp in red curry, pineapples, tomatoes, and basil.  The spring rolls were deliciously average, the corn cake was deliciously fried (and a refreshing change of pace!), and the curry held its own quite well.  It was creamy with a little heat as I was anticipating, but I was a little disappointed by the amount of delightful chunky bits in my curry - it looked a bit more like soup, though it did taste excellent over the rice.\n\nThe service was really quite alright once we were seated, and I'm mostly content with the prices - Thai House Express could charge for ambiance if it wanted to, but they don't and I appreciate that very much.  If I'm in the Castro, I'll likely show up again and try some of the other dishes.  It's legit and it's tasty, but it's no reason to make a pilgrimage across the city.

This also means my palette is well adjusted to hone in on specific aromas and taste for Pad Kee Mao...whatever the hell that means.  \n\nAnyway, the Pad Kee Mao was very delicious!  Being left-handed, I ate with a spoon on my right hand and a fork on my left, as suggested to me by this Thai lady at another restaurant (seems to be the standard way of eating for the Thai folks, apparently).  Supposedly, you bring the spoon to the mount (or mouth, whatever) and never the fork...the spoon should have more droplets of Thai sauces/spices per area than a fork can ever have.  Ending result:  Not sure if it was the method, but damn the food was delicious!  Very flavorful.  The basil was done right (not black and overcooked like some places).  However,  I didn't like how it was hardly spicy at all (and I asked the kind waitress to make it as spicy as possible!).  I've tasted spicier things in...fish and grits than I do in this Pad Kee Mao dish...\n\nI snatched a few noodles from a Pad Thai dish my friend ordered when she wasn't looking, and I gotta say...that Pad Thai dish is as good as they say it is! ... or maybe it just taste better when you have to work for it. =P  \n\nRegardless, I recommend this place for a decent meal.

The food's preparation is authentic, but it often lacks spice and flavor.\n\nThe preparation is fairly authentic. As an example, I can always tell an Americanized Thai restaurant from an authentic Thai restaurant by their preparation of chicken kaprow, or stir-fried chicken with basil. Good (or not so good) Thai restaurants will use whole chicken breasts and cover them in basil and sauce. Better Thai restaurants will grind the meat into small pieces, and then cook. Rare is the restaurant that actually takes the time and effort at this extra step. Thai House Express is one of the few Thai restaurants in San Francisco that I've found that do this: so they automatically get some love.\n\nBut I cannot give this place many more accolades because I cannot, despite having eaten here at least 10 times, figure out how to ask them to make the food spicy.

But goddamn if it isn't perfect in every other way.\n\nFor starters, it's the single closest restaurant to my house, sitting right on the corner of 19th and Castro.  Now this may not seem like something generally relevant to the Yelp population, seeing as how proximity to my house in the Castro does not translate to proximity to your house in Pacific Heights.  But first of all, fuck you and your $5mm mansion.  Second of all, if you think about it, $P(\\textrm{you're near my house} | \\textrm{you're reading this review}) \\gt\\gt P(\\textrm{you're near my house})$.  Either you're looking for a place to eat in the Castro or you're reading my reviews through my social graph.  Either way, it's pretty clear that you proximity to MY house is pretty much YOUR #1 priority in picking a restaurant.\n\nSecond of all, it's open till 10:30 PM.  As you probably deduced from my little conditional probability reasoning, I'm an engineer.  This means I'm getting home from work after 10 quite often. \n\nThird of all, the menu's massive, but not in that intimidating 150-things-that-are-all-the-same stereotypical Thai place way.  I've had a few soups, which were pleasant to a fault -- of all faults to have, a decent one.  I've had some curries, which are a personal Thai favorite and have a good amount of range.  I'd recommend, though, the Thai House Specials: the Kao Ka Moo (stewed pork) and Kao Rad Na Gai Ha-yak (sauteed chicken) both featured very tender meat in a sauce that wasn't just your run-of-the-mill coconut milk + chiles.\n\nMost important of all: price.  $7 (soup or \"over rice\" curry) and you get a delicious meal.  $9 (\"a la carte\": no rice, double the curry), and  -- if you can manage the difficulty of turning on a rice cooker for 20 minutes -- you have yourself a delicious meal plus delicious leftovers for lunch.  Either way, near my house (don't forget your #1 priority), that's a bargain.  In fact, my girlfriend and I split the leftover curry for lunch this afternoon.

So I figured it was time to try to move beyond the stereotypes and get to know the Castro as just another (admittedly gentrified) nabe, via its everyday restaurants.  First stop: Thai House Express.\n\nTurns out the spirit of Lime may be more pervasive around here than I thought.  Modern, white-n-black decor, suspiciously well-dressed & well-coiffed waitstaff...you get the idea.  What surprised me even more, though, are the dirt-cheap prices.  $6.95 for a hefty dinner entree over rice?  Not too shabby.  Tofu Pad King was pretty standard, but the Gai Ga-Prow (intensely spicy ground chicken) was altogether new to my palate, and delicious to boot.  Good job on the Thai Iced Tea too--very dark and deep taste that doesn't get lost in the sweetness.

In addition to views of Castro Street, there were tasteful paintings on the wall and low lighting.  \n\nFood:\nPortion sizes were good.  Sticky rice came in large, exceptionally sticky quantities and as a harsh critic of sticky rice, I give this order a 4.5 out of 5 (5 is reserved for the sticky rice at SEA restaurant in Brooklyn, the sweetest and stickies of all).\nEverything was made veggie for us with none of the awkwardness that sometimes follows ordering a full veggie meal.  There was a corn fritter appetizer on the menu which was of large proportions and quite tasty.\nThe Tom Yum soup was good, not great.  About average and not spicy enough.  The Tofu and veggies were good and fresh, not too greasy, a definite plus.\n***READ IF YOU ARE VEGGIE*** The curries are made with fish sauce, even the ones listed on the Vegetarian section of the menu.  I don't know why they did this but I am glad I asked.\n\nPrice:\nAverage for Thai in a cool neighborhood.

But your food is lackluster and your service is downright dismal. Take for example last night when my friend and I came over to have a three-way with you. The front of the restaurant was already crowded and you refused to open up the back *ahem*. You sat us at a table for two right in front of the counter, in the thick of the dining orgy, than proceeded to treat us as if we were invisible for fifteen minutes. No water, no drink orders, not even a reach around. How rude!\n\nWhen one of your waiters finally came over he was surly-- like he was coming off a bender or had gotten a little too much abuse that evening. We ordered up Garden Rolls, Pad Thai, Basil Chicken and Sticky Rice. It surprised me that he could even take our order considering he barely listened to anything we said. \n\nWhen our Garden Rolls came to the table, they were carried by a different server-- this one completely listless. He obviously didn't have the strength, or maybe just didn't have the desire, to place the platter all the way on our table. Now, it's been many years since I've waited a table but I'm pretty sure there's some unwritten rule about putting a platter all the way on the table, instead of letting half of it hang off the edge. Because, wonder of wonders, as soon as he took his hand off the platter, gravity kicked in, and it went crashing down to the floor. Not one of the other waiters came over to help clean it up. So it took our listless server a good three minutes to get everything up off the floor-- with nary an apology mind you.\n\nImagine our surprise when a new platter came out only thirty-seconds after the broken platter had been taken away. This time it was placed three-quarters of the way on our table. I can't be sure if you just reused the same garden rolls that were on the floor but I have a suspicion you did. BTW- the rolls were so dry we choked, and we're gay so choking is something we rarely do. Thai House Express on Castro-- if you're going to pre-make \"fresh\" garden rolls, the least you can do is drape them with damp paper toweling so they don't dry out. That's my Martha Stewart Good Thing(tm) tip to you-- you're welcome in advance.\n\nCan you answer me a question? When did your Pad Thai become synonymous with fish flavored candy? After our first bite both my friend and I became diabetic. And the Basil Chicken-- EESHK! It was so salty even the other people in the restaurant who didn't eat it will be retaining water for the next month. I will admit that the Sticky Rice came out alright-- which surprised me since you seemed to eff everything else up.\n\nThai House Express on Castro-- we won't see each other any more. I am not going to mall dodge you, instead when I pass by your front or side I'll flip you off because I'm hurt and I don't feel the need to curtail any impulses.", "author": "Eric B."}

So when it comes to choosing a place to eat, Thai is never on my list.\n\nFortunate for me, 3 of the 5 most recent dinner dates have insisted on their favorite Thai restaurants. I know, I have the best luck. Last night was Thai House Express (THX) on Castro.\n\nSo I was standing on the corner of 19th & Castro waiting for my date to arrive and thinking of the nearest pizza slice, when a Yellow Cab arrived and the most amazing legs stepped out of the car and took my hand. I quickly went dumb and forgot everything I learned in fourth grade. The night chill had started to roll in so we retreated inside THX for warmth and food. We were seated immediately. I like that kind of service. \n\nThe decor was simple yet nice... the crowd was mostly men but not intimidating... and sitting across from me were a pair of beautiful blue eyes and a gorgeous smile... My overall impression, Warm and Safe.\n\nAfter several attempts from our server we finally decided on \"Something-something Basil with Chicken\", \"Blah blah Blah Red Curry with Beef\", and brown rice. Did I get the Thai Iced Tea? Of course I had the ice tea. It is the only thing I anticipate from a Thai eatery! I have a bit of a sweet tooth.\n\nOur food arrived in typical white bowls found in every contemporary Asian-Style restaurant. The presentation was great! I was all about it, even though I had to find my own chop sticks. The \"Something-something Basil\" was good. Through my recent Thai experiences, I've discovered the one Thai dish that won't make me vomit. \n\nBut Oh that \"Blah blah Blah Red Curry!\" It was amazing and I hate curry! I had to stop myself from picking up the dish and drinking the sauce directly from the bowl. Although I did pour the sauce all over my \"Something-something Basil\" which turned into a lovely combo in my mouth. \nI'll consider myself a fan of  THX especially when it comes to \"Blah blah Blah Red Curry\". I mean, this stuff was really good and on top of that, my date ended well. \nI even got a little tongue action before heading to the Mission to meet the boys at the bar.", "author": "Tobias W."}

I am so used to SF restaurants being expensive so I was really happy looking at the prices on the menu.  The portions are really great for family-style eating (for like, 3 people or so), and my two friends and I split three entrees (that coconut milk soup (forgot the name), red chicken curry, and pad kee mao) and one appetizer (veggie spring rolls).  \n\nThe food around us smelled delicious and when we got the food, it definitely lived up to the wonderful aromas.  Each dish was soooo flavorful and especially the soup was a surprisingly tasty treat (whodda thunk that coconut could be savory??) \n\nBecause the prices were great, I wasn't expecting the presentation to be nice or the portions to be huge, however they were very nicely presented on pretty white plating worthy of more expensive restaurants.  \n\nI guess the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the decor is a little cheesy.  I do like the bar-height table for a larger group, however the white plastic decor is just a little early-90's-ikea (which was super cool in its day!).  \n\nAnyway, the food was delicious, bottom line.

I was originally thinking the place over on Sanchez and Market, but on a whim checked Yelp one last time to see if there was a better place.  And...here it was.\n\nThe food was pretty tasty, the menu standard quick Thai, with a few extras that you won't find anywhere else - to be sure, I ordered something I had never heard of before, and certainly can't remember the name of now.  However, what was kind of scary was the speed at which the food arrived...try less than five minutes.  What?  Either their kitchen is ridiculously fast, or there's a hot table somewhere that I didn't notice.\n\nPerhaps one of the more unique things that I liked about Thai House Express on Castro is their decor.  The place isn't standard cheapie Thai, with either dark woods or some strange sense of green and tropical scenes.  The ambiance is decidedly modern, with stark white walls, dim but \"harsh\" lighting, and modern art photos on the walls.  In addition, the plating utilizes more modern dishware, lending a sense of updatedness to everything.  But the food remains stoically Thai, and does it well.\n\nOh, and the prices are certainly comparable to more cheapie Thai places...dinner for three of us and a Thai iced tea for me, tax/tip included, came out to just under $30!\n\nI'll have to head back a few more times and give the menu more of a going over, but considering I ran into another friend while there who is a fan, it probably won't be much of a problem.", "author": "Mark C."}

I discovered this tastiest of tasty salads in Thailand years ago and I've never forgotten that first plate. I have many a good papaya salad since, but Thai House Express has it nailed. They even have the extra spicy, \"I won't survive this meal\" version which I usually need to have them tone down a bit.\n\nPad Thai is the other perennial favorite of Thai lovers that must be done right or all the curry goodness in the world can't make up for it. This place has it! While I have enjoyed Osha Thai for years (long before their chain-like explosion) and our endless supply of others, Thai House Express still takes the bean cake for me. Properly sized noodles - not thin, round, or too flat and wide. Great sauce that doesn't have too much fish sauce or too little either. No piles of cauliflower for us vegetarians - just the same shrimp version without the shrimp.\n\nAnother favortie is the Tofu pad ga prow - onions, peppers, fried tofu, stir-fried with basil and a sweetly spiced garlic sauce over rice. This is one of my favorite meals. Get this and a glass of water and you're out the door for $9 after tip. Not a bad at all.\n\nAlso, try out the corn cakes to start - really more like a corn fritter - with a little  cucumber/onion/peanut in simply syrup for a topping. My favorite way to start a meal.\n\nThe fifth star is reserved for the day time staff. Come in after 6pm on a weekday or late evening on the weekends and you'll have a great time.

The stuffing of their signature appetizer - chicken & veggie pouch - also dry (I was looking for some dipping sauce, in vain).  One could think that their kitchen struck by famine...

The chicken  in the yellow curry was the same...the meat was not fresh.......the sauce was good but didn't make up for the old tasting meat.\nThe beef balls in my beef noodle soup were hard and did not taste fresh either. \n      \nThe person who greeted us at the door  tried to lead us to the table next to  the door.  We asked to sit toward the back because it was cold, and he refused saying the back was closed...but there were other people there.      I noticed that one of the reviews for this restaurant stated that the staff treated asians  poor compared to other patrons....  I don't like to bring race into this .but I'm asian and they wouldn't seat me where I asked...yet the worker seated a group of all white patrons in the back that came in after me.   \n       There are plenty of  Thai restaurants that are good in the city....avoid this one!!!!

The men's bathroom has some wavy mirror right next to the toilet which adds a new dimension to \"taking a leak.\" There is just something amusing about watching a stream of tinkle in a wavy mirror. Not to mention, it would probably be even more amusing under the influence. Call me perverted and disgusting, but I bet you'll take my advice next time you are in Thai House Express and walk out of the bathroom pleasantly surprised.\n\nFOOD\n----------\n\nNow onto the food ...\n\nThai House Express was our de facto Thai restaurant when we lived on Upper Market. We just didn't like the others in the area after eating around. After moving to the Mission, we still go back. The food is cheap. The food is good. And their menu is enormous! Really, it doesn't get much better than that. \n\nNow, if you go to Thai House, you HAVE TO GET the Okie Ducky. Hands down, it is the best dish I have ever had at Thai House. So good that I get it every single time. And here's a little tip. Take the leftovers and throw it into a bowl of Mac n' Cheese the next day for a culinary orgasm. Truly, it is the most baller Mac n' Cheese you'll ever eat. That is, unless you are me since I prefer shaved truffles on mine.\n\nAll in all, I have only been let down once when I went here and asked the waiter for his recommendation between the two dishes. I took his advice and I didn't really like my dish. Other than that, I haven't had a bad dish yet. The portions are huge and the price is right. You can't really beat that combination. \n\nBest Dish List\n-------------------\n1. Okie Ducky\n2. Moo Tod (# 81)\n3. Pad Kee Mao", "author": "Bathrooms Only .."}

I like authentic Thai food a lot, and, occasionally, you'd get a good cook (or the cook was having a good day) and the food would be fantastic. Most of the time, it was okay. Unfortunately, the quality of the food has declined significantly. I've been eating there less and less frequently. However, last night was the first time I have ever actually returned take out food. Each of the five dishes we ordered was way below acceptable and two of the dishes were just flat-out disgusting; they had even forgotten several of the ingredients in some of the dishes. After a couple of bites, I was scared to eat any of it other than the sticky rice. \n\nWhen I called to complain, they explained that they were very busy that evening (I suppose the five Tuesday night diners must have all ordered at once), and that that could explain why the food was so poor. I guess that means that if they are busy, you take your chances... \n\nI, however, will not be taking any chances here again.\n\nFollow up - I've been asked for examples. One example: The Som Tam (green papaya salad) did not have any chilis, dried shrimp or garlic in it, and if it had lime, I certainly couldn't taste it - these are all essential, and approximately half of the, ingredients to som tam. What it did have, and in large quantities, was undisolved sugar and fish sauce - without those ingredients and with the overabundance of sugar, it all just tasted like a sickeningly-sweet, syrupy, slightly rancid (from the fish sauce) apple salad with fine sand in it.", "author": "Peter S."}

Still unsure if they are related or just have the same name, I was very pleased with their food.  The decor is really nice and the place is clean.  We ordered the most typical dishes - pad thai and tom yum soup.  I think you can pretty much judge how good they are if they can master the basic dishes.

I'm convinced it is not what it used to be. Could it be there was a change in chef? They admit to adding MSG to their food, which in my opinion is not the Thai way of cooking. Plus, when I went there to have a nice bowl of noodle soup, I got a way scaled down version of what it used to be, all cramped into a small square bowl. There were a lot of bean sprouts and a measly pinch of noodles that didn't fill me up. It sure did have a lot of flavor though, but I suspect it was thanks to MSG. Unfortunate that things have changed and I try not to support restaurants that use  MSG in their cooking so I likely will not be back. It's harmful to some, like me, and there is no need for it if the cook knows how to season properly. As for service, my waiter was nicer than the usual bunch that is there and a lot more attentive.

As a girl that grew up enjoying Peking Duck, suckling pigs, things wrapped in bacon, and well marbled steaks, I knew I would love this dish the moment I laid eyes on the rich fatty bits, pork skin, and soft braised meat of the kao ka moo! I wouldn't recommend powering through this on your own though, definitely a dish to share. Loved the spicy tangy sauce that came on the side and the crisp emerald green gai lain (Chinese Broccoli) hiding underneath the tender pork soaking up the yumminess.\r\nPad kee mao was also very good. Crisp veggies, fresh basil, pan fried rice noodles, and a spice level (we requested it spicy, even though it already had the chili notation on the menu) that was kickin'! Yeah, this was right at the threshold of excellent spicy flavor and an intense, fiery burning. I think it may be more pleasant to stick to the regular spicy level at T.H.E. b/c they are not messing around with the heat. If you like it spicy, get over there soon.\r\nNice modern space, friendly servers, water refilled regularly, and, even if the food wasn't as savory as it was, I would still love them b/c they're open late, til midnight or 1am on the weekend and 10 or 1030 during the week.

It was an amateurish culinary error.\n\nThe cucumber salad, a staple of Thai cuisine had dressing that was overly sweet.  Somehow the kitchen got the balance between the sweet and the acid all wrong.  Again, this is a basic thing that any Thai kitchen worth its salt should nail.\n\nMy main course was Pad Ma Keur (sauteed eggplant and chicken).  It was significantly overcooked, resulting in tough chicken and mushy eggplant.  One of my favorite Thai dishes, I was only able to get half of it down.\n\nLunch came with an appetizer called \"Toons Gern Yueng\"  - diced chicken fried in a pocket of springroll dough.  It was bland and dry...lacking much flavor and sporting a \"fried wet sawdust\" texture.  I deemed this inedible and only downed one bite.\n\nThe underlying theme here is lack of consistency.

As for the atmosphere, the place was decorated in a simple, modern style, and you can't beat a walk along Castro Street after your meal, the neighbourhood has such a personality!  Only word of advice: we ordered the foursome and sate appetizers, and were disappointed at the tiny amount of food they were for their $8 price tag.  Just order entrees straight away; for the same price range, you get a much larger amount of food.", "author": "Canadian A."}

Thai food is known for being spicy, and Thai house express makes its food SPICY...Whenever I go into a restaurant and ask for extra spicy, the waiters seem to ignore my request; however, Thai house express makes its food so spicy, that I have to dip my tongue in a glass of water to ease the pain. THe only thing I order here is Pad ga prow. It is the best I have ever eaten, and I've eaten at quite a few thai places. It is flavorful yet not over salty. My girlfriend ordered the pad se ew and she thought it was good. Overall, if you are a spicy eater, i recommend this place. You will not regret it.", "author": "huy P."}

DAMN IT WAS HOT. steam started coming up at me out of nowhere and my hand was scalded from just a seconds exposure. that shit pissed me off. plus i got water all over the front of my khaki pants. i go back to the table and ask for the check the first chance i get. some other waitress brings it to me and, of course, the beer i ordered is on there. i feel some sympathy for the waiter because i can see that he is very busy with to-go orders on the phone and plenty of other tables. it's just inexcusable when they just don't pay attention. don't charge people for drinks you don't bring. it took me a little while to get it worked out, because i needed change and had to wait for a new check. i left with the best taste in my mouth, and the worst, not to mention my hand had red marks on it for a day.", "author": "oskar p."}

At my first visit several weeks ago I had AMAZING food and a nice server.  I was excited to go back.  Unfortunately, because of the rudeness of the person who sat us tonight - a tall gentleman wearing a vest and a hat - I left without ordering.  When we came in the gentleman in the vest greeted us and offered us one of two tables by the front door.  I asked for another table - without requesting a specific one - explaining that it's cold tonight and I didn't have a jacket (also, my boyfriend gets cold easily).  My boyfriend asked about a booth in the middle of the restaurant, and was told that it was only for parties of four.  There were many empty tables (it was after 8:00 p.m.), but fair enough.  I understand they need to maximize seating options.  We then suggested one of the tables in the back, up a few steps; he took us back there while rolling his eyes and acting annoyed.  When I thanked him for seating us, he barely acknowledged me.  I felt slighted and very unwelcome in the restaurant.  But still, I wanted to stay for the yummy food and cute decor.  I can't even remember the last time I left a restaurant.  As my boyfriend and I were discussing what to do, we noticed the gentlemen in the vest lingering behind us, ostensibly pouring water, but actually giving us dirty looks.  His behavior was completely unacceptable.  Our request to be seated away from the door was made politely and was not unreasonable.  There were plenty of free tables and we were the only ones waiting to be seated.  We left before we ordered and I won't be back.  Instead, we had a lovely meal at Brandy Ho's.  Our server was very nice and we left her a 33% tip.  If I were the owner/manager of Thai House Express on Castro, I would be very concerned about the gentleman in the vest's poor attitude.  Customer service is what keeps diners coming back, and everyone thinks carefully about where (s)he spends money during a recession.", "author": "Steven W."}

The food here is really some great Thai. It's a rare event when I get something that's off, maybe salty, or maybe I shouldn't have tried to be so adventurous. Overall, the food is consistently great. The rice plates are enough for a satisfying meal, and are a great option at a great price for many of their dishes. If I'm feeling ravenous the entree + rice is satiating. The Money Bags appetizer is my favorite. All their curries are good....with exception to the Panang Curry w/ Beef. It breaks my heart that this dish isn't (in my opinion) good. I LOVE Panang Curry. The Thai House Beef dish is mouth watering, and that spicy green dipping sauce with citrus and garlic will stick with you as a constant reminder of how good it was. It's the best place for takeout, I just wish they would hop on board with online & app based ordering. I can order my food, walk out the door and by the time I'm there it's waiting for me.", "author": "Mike P."}

What's really upsetting is the staff, who pretend to nod their head and say yes yes yes, they end up never putting in my order correctly. Every time I bring my food home, it's wrong.  I just don't understand what's so hard about granting a customer their request on how they like the dish to be made, and honestly, It's the easiest request...\"cook the meat well done for me please.\" IT'S RAWISH EVERY TIME! On top of that, the little guy who sits at the desk wearing make up gives you attitude left and right. I am very polite, smile, be extra sweet, yet they still won't put in my order correctly.

I've always thought the food was pretty good and, even though the crowd was thick and the men were A&F plastic, I wanted to go back to support the local business.  And then I went on a week night and was cheated on my bill.  The waiter was young and muscled and acted very dumb. When the bill arrived, it seemed excessively high, but we only had a stub to go on....  After insisting, he brought our bill all written in Thai after about 5 minute.  But he had used white out to try to cover a charge that was sitting on our bill.  We asked him what it was and he kept saying it was for drinks (that we didn't have).  I guess his business was slow that night so he thought it was OK to charge extra and we wouldn't notice.   I would give Thai House Express the lowest rating (no stars if possible).

Sure it tasted good, but I ended up with the worst migraine I have had in months. The food did arrive promptly after ordering. When I asked for the chili, sugar, lemon combo that often accompanies Pad Thai, I waited ten minutes and then had to walk up to the waiter and ask him to bring it.
