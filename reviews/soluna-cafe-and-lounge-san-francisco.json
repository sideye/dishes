They kept saying they never received my card info for the reservation. They finally found it the day before we were supposed to eat there. \n\nThey wouldn't let us be seated early. The reservation was for 12:30. By 11:15 we were done at City Hall. They said they couldn't seat us until 12:30  because of the contract we signed. Then they wouldn't let is order drinks at the bar. If anyone ordered drinks before 12:30, it was going to be on a separate tab. Mind you, we had to reach a $1000 minimum. We were at $930. \nWhen it finally came time to being seated, they said we couldn't order until 12:30.

We are so glad we chose this spot for dinner, though. Yes, it is very convenient to the Orpheum for a pre-show dinner, but that was actually not the deciding factor in our dinner choice. After looking at many menus in the area, the sample food and drink menus that Soluna offers on their website seemed like the kind of food and drink we would enjoy. So we went despite the terrible current reviews, and despite the fact that the menu online is only a sample and not an actual current menu.\n\nOur experience was wonderful, thankfully. We had reservations and were seated at a nice little table immediately. Drinks were ordered and received promptly, and I do love a good creative cocktail! My husband and I shared the mac and cheese to start and it was very tasty, no complaints there. I had the spring vegetable risotto and my husband had the pork ragu for our entrees. Both were delicious, and I the risotto was enough to take half home for later. We also indulged in vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse for dessert, again, both treats were delicious. \n\nWe have absolutely no complaints about the quality of the food, the cocktails, or the staff. We felt everything was friendly, polite, well paced, and tasty. And a 6pm reservation was the right time for an 8pm show at the Orpheum considering we wanted a leisurely 3 course meal. We also noticed that this place was well attended. Not overly crowded busy, but most tables full and enjoying themselves.

The bartender could have been snobby about it, but he was super gracious and genuinely nice and funny about helping us pick a cocktail.  They were delicious too!  You are good at what you do, so thanks for that, Mr. Bartender, who is tall, with black hair and thick/dark rimmed glasses. \n\nWe also ordered some fries but they were a huge disappointment. \n\nThis one dish told me everything I needed to know about this establishment and maybe management or an owner should take note:   Your kitchen staff does NOT care about food it is sending out of your kitchen.   If they do care and it was just a major error, then perhaps more quality control is needed as dishes leave the kitchen.  Seriously. I would have been embarrassed to serve these to my family. let alone paying customers. \n\nWhat came out of the kitchen was an admittedly generous sized bowl of fries for $7; however we were given the serious dregs of the batch. They were mostly the little tiny pieces left at the bottom of the fryer.  On top of that, they were not AT ALL fresh and had obviously been sitting around for awhile, barely even lukewarm.   I'm not being snowflake picky, this was egregious.   These were not fit to serve guests, they should have gone straight in the garbage. Kitchen staff that cared or took pride in their work would have taken a minute to make a fresh batch.  \n\nWe each only ate a couple bites and left them because it wasn't worth the calories to eat the stale, bottom of the barrel leftovers. \n\nThe tables were bused behind us and in front of us, but we were ignored.  It would have been nice if someone checked on us to ask if we wanted another drink or asked if everything was OK since we obviously left 99% of the fries.   \n\nThe bright side is that at least it was happy hour and so it wasn't an expensive disappointment.

Instead of greeting us properly, he turned to us from the table adjacent to ours and said \"since I'm over here, did you want to order something?\" It was evident that this place was a mess so we quickly put our food in. It took another 5-10 minutes for our server to bring us a drink menu, and probably another 10 minutes after that for my husband to receive his beer.

For $23, I expect more food. \n\nEveryone around us was irritated and having a similar experience. There was a lot of eye contact happening between our table and other customers.

After rattling off a number of places to try, my friend suggested Soluna mainly because of the happy hour burger special is considered a good deal: $18 for what they call a \"Civic Burger\" along with a side of fries (or arugula salad), a huge pilsner sized draft beer and a shot of bourbon. It's a good deal and well worth the price. Judging by previous reviews and other articles I've looked at, it looks like that 18 dollars is an increase in price from just a few years ago. But I digress, you get what you pay for I suppose.\n\nI have to admit, I get jaded by burgers living here in the Bay Area after all we are the food capitol of the world, yes that includes gourmet hamburgers as well! But for some reason I thought the Civic Burger at Soluna Cafe tasted amazing! In hindsight, I know why this was true: it was topped with triple cream brie cheese! It tasted like something that I've never had before. (Which on a burger, I hadn't!) That combined the house-ground all-natural beef with arugula, crispy onions, black garlic aioli served on brioche bun all the more tantalizing. I couldn't believe it myself!\n\nThe fries were adequate, the ale beer was fine, oh and the bourbon shot went down very very slowly! But that burger was a true revelation! And if you check in on your yelp app you get a \"Check In Drink\" for only five dollars! For that Thursday it was a combination of tropical flavors with a tinge of beer. I don't exactly know the name of that drink (because on my receipt, it only says Check In), but I have to admit it it tasted really vibrant and actually quenched my thirst! (More than the beer and the bourbon did, but hey that's just me) \n\nNow is Soluna the best place to dine in the Tenderloin/ Civic Center area? Probably not, but it was an affordable and tasty option within walking distance to our theater and my friend and I were both pleased with the meal we ordered and the bill we paid.

I respect that bartenders work to create their art, but the response was a bit over the top. The drinks we ended up with were fine, but none of us ordered a 2nd drink (which is highly unusual for this group). Strike two.\nI ordered the ahi tuna and I ate it. It was room temperature. It was fine -- but not great. The greens on top had sat there too long and had soaked up the tuna taste making them unappetizing.

The tomato soup was forgettable, but the burger was delicious. You don't want the burger anything other than medium - nice and juicy that way. One thing I would change about the Civic Burger is to opt out of having brie in the burger unless it's your favorite cheese.

This place has on more than one occurrence served my needs for alcoholic beverages (as one might expect; lawyers drink). But each time I can remember getting food here, I have had horrendous experiences. \n\nI only give this place 2 stars because I have had good experiences with the bartenders and waiters before, who are usually very courteous. The drinks are usually pretty satisfactory, although seemingly a little steep for the tenderloin. This is SF after all.\n\nI recall two particularly terrible experiences ordering food here. \n\nDuring my first week of law school back in 2012, I remember getting a chicken salad (it wasn't Caesar, I cannot recall the exact salad) with the students in my legal writing class and our academic advisor.  This salad was horrible. I felt nauseous and wanted to puke right there in front of my classmates. Nervous and ashamed, I said nothing, but couldn't hide my revolt from my other peers. They asked me what was wrong and finally they got me to admit what was bothering me. With their help, I managed to send it back and get a replacement order. I felt horribly embarrassed and did not return there except to meet for drinks after a class. \n\nAnother time, which I had hoped would prompt my friend to write a review (he is also an avid Yelp reviewer), was particularly memorable. On the last Pride of this year, 2015, my friend and I, faced with no reasonable alternative, happened upon this place near my school. I recommended this place because I thought others in my school liked it, and I had forgotten my previous experience at this time. We went in and fortunately got a seat. My friend ordered a chicken burger and I do not remember what I ordered. My friend had to send his order back because for one reason or another the chef had ignored specific requests (it was something less picky than \"no pickles please\"). \n\nThe chef then sent back the order partially RAW. Fortunately this was discovered before consumption. My friend and his female companion cut the sandwich in half to discover that it had been not fully cooked. He sent it back, understandably disgusted. In this moment, I had uncovered the repressed memory of the salad.  To this day he gives me flack for having poor taste (for that, I blame the inflated review status on yelp). But I digress. \n\nIf ever given a choice, I would much prefer Lalita's down the street. They have really great bar food and places to sit and talk. \n\nIn any case, I strongly do not recommend ever ordering food here if you must come here.", "author": "Robert M."}

I used to go here somewhat often, like once every other week.   Matt and Carlos were amazing but they have since moved onto their next amazing adventure which is actually delicious and great.  In their wake, sadly, lies Solana.   I've gone 3 times to Solana since my dudes moved on, and each time it's been the same issue.   To begin, I order their great deal, the burger bourbon and beer combo.  I sit at the bar, waiting for a server to order,  today I waited 10 minutes,  then I wait to get my drink, today I waited 30 minutes, as I tried to get the serves attention, I get a wonderfully curt, just a second,  before he disappears for five minutes.   Finally he comes by and before I can ask for my beer he tells me, your burger is on the way.   Great, but I'm still waiting for my beer.   As for time, I ordered my food before my friends go there, they were able to order and drink their drinks before I even got my first one, I tried to signal to someone to get it but no.   Finally I have to basically reorder it, and he sees he didn't snag my beer and says looks like I already poured it, here ya go.  I said no, I don't want stale beer I want fresh beer please pour me another.  He does so, I eat my food and that's that.  \n\nHere's the essence of why I'm mad,  not once in the two hours I was there did the guy apologize for delays.   I used to work behind the bar, and I knew when I messed up, I owned up to it, and it usually led to getting a decent tip.  Maybe I'm a hard ass but my rule is no apology, no effort, no tip.  The only time he came to talk to me after I ate was to see why I didn't sign my check.   I wanted to, but it was taken before I could.   So I wrote be better, didn't tip and left.  I got home and a friend text me saying I'm banned. I'm not sure why, but honestly, I'm fine with that because I'm so done with this place.   Service is literally the worst I've ever seen.

We had been walking around for a couple of hours looking to get a couple of drinks and kind of chill for a while. When we walked in we weren't greeted at all but still came in and sat at bar area. Still no greeting. We were discussing what kind of drinks we would have and it wasn't until then the bartender (middle aged, dark hair) chimed in and told us this was not a bar and they served cocktails and if we were looking for shots we should find a bar. Kind of rude but whatever ignored it.\n\n We ordered 2 Easy Breezy's since 2 of the 4 of us aren't really drinkers and wanted to test it out before they actually ordered one. Turns out my partner really liked it so we ordered an additional one. The bartender asked to give him a second as he was in the middle of making a drink. Totally understandable. First come, first serve... but then a gentleman comes and sit at the bar and he GREETS him and asks him if he would like to order. He then makes the guy drink serves him and makes another ( not an Easy Breezy) and THEN makes our drink. .. Hmm. He does ask if I would like another drink, I decline, take care of the tab and we make our way out. We left a $5 Tip since our drinks were good and got OK service. \n\nWe come back the next with a few more people than the day before. This time we're looking to eat since we missed out on breakfast trying to catch the Parade. This time it's a lot more busy and a lot more crowded. We order our food at the bar and found a table. We're sitting at the table and a waitress walks up (dark brown hair, red lips, fair skin) to tell us we can't sit here since we ordered for take out at the bar and would have to have a card on file if we wanted to sit there. Never heard of it. I instantly picked up this snotty vibe from her.

Our waitress does not check on us. Not once. So I walk up to the bar area to politely ask a waiter (about 5\"11, dark hair, brown skin, glasses) if he could check our order for us. His reply,\" I didn't take your order.\" ... Really? Like... I'm fed up at this point. Before I could get a word out a woman asks what my order was (I believe her name was Allison). I told her she said it wasn't ready yet. When it was ready she did bring it out to our table and asked if we needed anything else and even offered to put our food on plates and give us silverware. We declined because we were trying to make it an in and out thing. For the rest of our visit we were ignored and our waitress just looks our direction and rolls her eyes. Definitely did not leave a tip. We weren't serviced at all. \n\nWorst service ever. I will never come back here. Definitely need work on their customer service skills.

It was very good! \n\nThe server gave a great recommendation for a nice Kentucky bourbon and interacted well with our group of 7. The bar had a few patrons watching the baseball game but other than that, we were the only ones in the dining area. I don't know if Soluna just does most of their business on weekdays with the Civic Center crowd or was having an off night. \n\nThe bottom line is that it was a nice spot, not super overpriced like some other places in the area (see Absinthe) and it can accommodate large groups or intimate meals.

Before going to a show one night, my bf and I were in a pickle, because we hadn't had dinner yet. We decided that because Soluna was so close by to the concert venue that we would give it a try.\n\nMonday night they had some excellent happy hour specials. $1 off glasses of wine, and a burger, shot of burbon, and a pint of beer for $15. The burger was pretty darn good. I was so happy that when I ordered it \"medium\" and it actually came out cooked \"medium\" (no bloody ooze.) My bf ordered the mac and cheese minus the bacon, since he's vegetarian, and I would say it was only OK. I\"m sure it is much better with the bacon.\n\nThe reason Soluna gets 3 stars instead of 4 or 5, is because of the weird service. Our waiter/bartender, who looked like he was also the owner, was super nice to us. While he was nice to us, he wasn't nice to everyone else that walked in the door. I will cut him some slack, since he looked like he was the only one working there that night, aside from the kitchen staff, but he did give some of the people walking in some serious attitude. He even told a couple of ladies he wasn't serving food anymore, even though it was only 6 p.m. and he had given them the bar food menu. If you aren't serving food, you don't hand people the food menu when they walk in. The way he told them he wasn't serving food was also pretty rude.\n\nOverall, I'll probably be back here the next time I go to a show at the Bill Graham, but will need to arrive super early in order to avoid not being able to get a seat, or order food.", "author": "Mona H."}

There were only 3 or 4 other parties during our time there so it was really slow.  I'd like to see how the energy is like during dinner service.  \n\nWe sat the booth-like area where the seats were couches, which gave a homey feel - but they were stained.  Points deducted for that.\n\nOur server Roberto was really great.  He was friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes we asked about.  He even gave us a tip on a recipe my husband is eager to try.\n\nMy husband had the Civic Burger - really, really tasty.  The bun so was so light, the meat was juicy and the picked red onions added just enough saltiness.  It was presented on a little cutting board, which I thought was cute.  I had the mac & cheese, of course I opted to add panchetta.  It was OK.  We shared the truffle fries, which we enjoyed.  I thought the preserved lemon aioli was awesome and the ketchup with jalapenos and cilantro was pretty tasty.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the White Chocolate Bread Pudding.  Roberto (addressed us by our names after he learned what they were - nice touch) warned us that the bread pudding takes the longest to make of all the desserts.  We weren't in a rush so we didn't mind.  Honestly, the wait didn't seem to be long at all.  Probably because after we took our first bite, we got so lost in the bread pudding that we weren't thinking about anything else.  The bread pudding was accompanied by a scoop of homemade vanilla bourbon ice cream - creamy, not too sweet, and the bourbon was not strong at all.  The bread pudding itself was awesome.

We called the waitress over and as I was explaining what I saw the mouse popped back up and ran across to another booth.  The staff acted as if it was not a big deal and appeared annoyed that we did not want to sit there.  They said sometimes they open the back door and the mouse may have come in that way (the back door was closed at the time).  They then offered to seat us in the booth that the mouse had just jumped down into.  They said they would talk to the manager and we insisted we sit up front at a high top, not a booth where the mouse could hide.  (Yes, we probably should have left).  Once seated up front, no one made any comment about the mouse, the manager never came over.  Again, staff was not apologetic and rude when we had to ask for new waters and bread that we left at our initial table.\n\nAside from the mouse, the service was poor and the food was mediocre.

The civic burger comes topped with triple creme brie. I thought the brie would get lost on a burger but I was wrong... it was heaven. Added a nice subtle flavor and nice mouth feel. My husband loved the fries but couldn't eat them all because the burger filled him up. The polenta was grainier than I usually like but I didn't mind. The agave gave it a hint of sweet which was a nice surprise and went well with the onion garnish. The brussel sprouts were caramelized just right - with slightly charred bottoms. Together the brussel sprouts and polenta were so rich that I couldn't finish them all. To finish, we had the fresh peach sorbet. It was refreshing with a hint of peach.

But - delicious nonetheless.  The brussel sprouts and the celery root puree were especially spectacular and definitely worth ordering.  We did not order any items with meat or fish, so I can not comment on those.  \n\nThe cocktail I ordered was small and underpowered - supposedly contained a habanero tincture, but it was mostly absent in what was otherwise a pleasant but not very exciting drink.  \n\nWe visited on a super warm evening - let's even say it was *hot* in SF that day - and this restaurant offered no respite at all.  No fans, no nothing.  I am a small, slender-bodied person and I am almost always cold and thus enjoy when places are a little on the warm side...but this was straight up uncomfortable, even for me.  I get that it's hard to ventilate a place like this though, so I mention it only in hopes that the proprietors might take it into consideration. \n\nThe service was earnest, but hurried, and maybe a little overzealous.  All of us agreed we felt a weird sense of urgency from our server right from the start, who came back to take drink orders we were not yet ready to place at three times in a roughly five minute period.  Over the course of the meal, the continued service was pleasant, but a little intrusive.  Without hand-wringing too much over more small details, I will simply suggest that the waitstaff could use a little re-education on the art of observing customers from afar, and facilitating a great dining experience and moving things along without being pushy.  And don't get me wrong, everyone was pleasant and respectful.  \n\nBut - for the location, the menu pricing, the style of cuisine and the overall vibe, we all came away from our meal feeling generally \"meh.\"  Would be willing to give this place another shot, but I'm not banging the door down, you know?

Restaurant called me; I told them to split the difference for 6PM, but with unpredictable traffic unsure as we are coming from Walnut Creek. Was told they would hold our table.  I called from the Bridge at 6PM; accident - be there asap.  Arrived at 6:18PM.  Seated at 6:20PM.  Took 20 minutes for the server to come back to tell us our drinks should be here soon.  Told him we had theatre tickets and needed to be out within an hour.  He took our order then.  Still no drinks after another  10 minutes,  so got up to alert Server. Apparently, drink ticket didn't go in - we got drinks in another 10 mins. (40 mins for drinks to arrive.) Sidenote: We asked for bread in the meantime - 4 adults/2 teenagers, sitting at a table for 40 mins with only water is unacceptable.  We got 1 small board of bread- gone in 3 secs.  10 mins more, still no food.  Server peeks at us, but doesn't offer 1 thing to keep us comfortable during the wait.  More bread? Soda refills for teenagers? Dinner arrives 60 mins from time we arrived. We have 5 mins to eat now. 3 of liked our food - except the teenagers: they said their burgers were still mooing and bleeding, (but no time to send back, and they were starving so they ate them anyway) and my Cod smelled like old fish.  We talk to manager.  He said that we should have made our reservation on time.  Really???!! He offers to comp dessert. No more time. Manager sends over a round of comp drinks.  He leaves out a drink for my husband.  (The guy who is paying the check. Hello?)

First of all, I am not a vegetarian, I love a good beef burger, but I feel that veggie burgers are an amazing opportunity for a kitchen to get creative and think outside of the Boca box. Soluna's veggie burger is made of a combination of chickpeas, mushrooms and other tasty ingredients. My tip is to order the veggie burger, but ask for it served as the \"civic\" burger. That way you get the crispy onions, arugula, brie and black garlic aioli. Seriously, I dream about this burger.\n\nI'd like to say I've tried many other dishes at Soluna, considering it has become a go to spot for me and my colleagues when we decide we want to sit down and get served for lunch. The truth is, once I tried the burger, I've never gone back. My colleagues rave about the Thai Chicken Salad and the grilled cheese.\n\nHighly recommend Soluna Caf\u00e9 for a nice, reasonably priced lunch during the workday.

Our table had the fried chicken and it was reported to be delicious, as was the Filet served with mashed potatoes and topped with mushrooms and peppers.

We ordered the crab pumpkin fritters and manila clams to start, both very creative and delicious. The broth in the clams was so good we kept ordering bread to soak up the love! DANG! Chorizo topped the clams and made for a very innovative dish, never had anything like this ever. Clams are normally just white wine and garlic broth, but their take on this appetizer was truly something to write about! The fritters are a treat, too, light and puffy little fried goodness, very tasty, crab is delicious and not local. Our entr\u00e9es were the black cod with polenta and the mushroom risotto with grilled chicken, very hearty Fall selections for a crisp, cool weather evening. Loved it and the atmosphere is lively and cozy inside this little caf\u00e9. Service was attentive and very friendly even though they were pretty busy.

We where then asked to wait for 20 mins when the entire place was empty but we wanted a nice sit down dinner so we waited.... Fast forward to and hour and a half later we are finally sitting at our table and our food was still not delivered. Our waitress was also very standoffish and every other table who got there before and after us where getting the best service, drinks, bread etc. I really wanted to just pay for my drink and leave but I was with friends so I couldn't just leave them. Finally after hours I went up to the manager and told him all of my problems with this establishment and his response was sorry we are understaffed and it will be right out. My problem was that we all ordered simple items like Mac  and cheese and salads and it took and hour and a half to get served in the mean time during that hour we where never attended. To top it off my friends SALAD took and extra 10 mins after we all got our food! Seriously tho it's a simple salad. Oh and after we where done with our meal we finally received bread! Come on! To top it off my party of five received a gratuity charge for THE WORST SERVICE OF MY LIFE and on their menu the charged is advertised as 18% charge but in reality we received a 20% charge.I even signed up to yelp right now to leave this bad review. Oh and the cherry on top was a charge for splitting our checks. WOW! For a \"high\" end restaurant the service was the lowest of the lowest!

We were not welcomed at the door for such a long time that I was suggesting we just hang our own coats, choose a table and seat ourselves. We ordered glasses of wine as soon as we were seated, and we waited, and waited. Eventually the waitress came back and took our food order and we reminded her about the wine, and asked if maybe we could get some bread. She said the bread was in the oven and would take a few minutes - I imagined that they made it themselves. We waited and waited. Dinner came, and the food was very good, but we were still not complete. We again asked for the wine. Keep in mind that the place was not busy. After a while I was weighing whether I should just get up and go pour a few glasses at the bar... no one would notice except the other patrons, and they might all be in the same boat. Finally, the bread came... it was one piece each, and looked and tasted like a roll that you'd pick up at a no-frills corner store... mystery solved... someone must have been at the store looking for bread. About a third of the way into our meal, two glasses of wine came to our table. The one handed to me was correct, but the other was not. The people at the next table spoke up and said that it was their order. The wine given to me was taken out of my hand and handed to the woman next to me. Fine. It was wine they'd been waiting for for ages, they had ordered before we ever sat down, and they were nearly done with their meal. Unfortunately, the staff did not go back to the bar and bring us the wine we'd been asking for all along. It took another 5-10 minutes for our wine to come. We asked the busboy for more bread, and were plainly told, \"No. We're out.\" How in the world can a restaurant in a city known for the quality, variety and availability of its bread run out for the early dinner crowd on a Saturday night? \n\nThe food is really good, but the place is so poorly managed that it became the focus of our entire dinner conversation, and we will never be back.", "author": "Erica B."}

With Soluna it wasn't really that bad. Our server was attentive and very friendly and we were seated fairly promptly.\n\nThe prices for the New Year prix fixe were probably standard for SF, though the menu does seem a little pricey for what it is. We both had the orange-soy glazed king coho salmon, with brown sugar roasted brussel sprouts and the butternut squash, applewood-smoked bacon and caramelized shallot hash. We also had the nicoise salad with ahi tuna, which was quite good, though I'm not really much of a fan of ahi tuna (I wanted the greens).\n\nSoluna deserves five stars for what we had of the entrees. The salmon we requested medium rare, an option that I would encourage others to get if they hate their salmon dry and overcooked the way it sometimes tends to be in some restaurants. It was nicely done, tender and juicy with the slight umami sweetness of the glaze complementing the salmon perfectly, and perhaps the first order of salmon I've had here that managed to make my standard in terms of how well done it was. What really made the meal outstanding was the addition of the butternut squash hash and the brussel sprouts. While it's not the recommended combo it's well worth the try just to taste the salmon combined with the warm, earthy flavors of the bacon and sweet squash, and the brussel sprouts were excellent, though a bit too oily. Delicious.\n\nMy only complaint was that my salmon was served somewhat lukewarm. There was some confusion with the bf's order of hash which had been mistakenly switched to the chips, though he did manage to get a little of the hash which they'd run out of at that point. Our orders also took quite a long wait to get there, but once the food started arriving it wasn't so bad.", "author": "Kit A."}

No problem getting sat at our time because the place was almost empty (should have been a clue).  Decor - There is nothing chic about the restaurant; it's a little dark to notice much.  The bathroom was old, but clean.  Seating - Just long rows of tables, which meant we couldn't converse with anyone except the people next to us.  Libations - No draft beer that night because the taps weren't working - on a Saturday night?  Food - Five of us had the halibut.  It was an extremely small serving (4 ounces, maybe) on polenta.  The halibut was dry until the very center and I learned that polenta is just a fancy word for corn meal mush - no flavor whatsoever - $26.  Two people chose the fried chicken; yep, greasy fried chicken was the only chicken choice.  My husband had the chicken and gave me a leg, which I ate because I was still hungry after having the halibut.  There were three pieces of chicken, but the potatoes served with it amounted to a two-tablespoon serving with a small hard biscuit.  My husband said it tasted like a Bisquick biscuit - $25.  Two people had the ceasar salad and I didn't ask them about it, but there wasn't even an option of adding chicken to it.  Dessert - The two people I sat next to ordered vanilla ice cream.  One asked for a chocolate topping, which they didn't have.  I will be generous and say that the serving size was 3 ounces for $6.  Service - Just okay, but I waited an hour for a glass of water.  \n\nFirst, let me explain that I included the prices because you need to know how much we paid for food that in no way met our expectations.  It was edible and that's the best comment I can make about the food.\n\nSecond, we were there to celebrate an 80th birthday.  Normally, I would have returned the food, but I didn't want to detract from the purpose or embarrass the person who had chosen the venue.  It is so unlike me to not speak up.  I was a waitress for ten years before becoming a teacher.  I give restaurants and waiters a lot of slack and still leave an above average tip.\n\nThird, I gave it one star because I will never go back.

I came for a business meeting at 5:00 PM and had reserved a table because we wanted to have a quiet conversation instead of being at the bar. Please note, there is nothing on Open Table or on their website that says that reservations can only be made if you are planning to order dinner. My colleague and I sat down at the table, ordered drinks and when asked by the waiter if we were going to order food, we said no, we'd probably just be ordering drinks. The waiter gave us a weird look and seconds later, a VERY haughty manager of some sort came over to us, literally looking down his nose at us and said \"I am sorry, you are going to have to move to the bar. The dining room is only for guests who are ordering dinner.\" Then, as we moved to the bar he said \"Yes, we are really busy all the time, so we'll really need that table\".  Also, just FYI, we had moved the napkins and touched the silverware already, and the manager instructed the waiter to just rearrange the stuff we had touched instead of putting down fresh napkins and silverware. So, whoever sat at that table next, hope you enjoyed my finger germs all over your spoon! We then sat at a high boy table in the bar area and were brought our drinks. We asked for water, and this very odd man with a beard (I honestly cannot tell if he was a bartender or what) came over, slowly placed the water on our table and then stared at us as he dramatically slid them towards us. Super weird. Then, over the course of our meeting, we were asked about 12 times if we wanted anything else, like they were trying to hustle us out of there. By the time we left, it was 6:30 PM and I made a point to look in the dining area. LO AND BEHOLD, it was EMPTY! Looks like they really needed our table.

I had a friend who had a bday dinner here. Apparently this is big with the law crowd as it's not far from Hastings and there were a good sized amount of attorneys in the fold. We were in a pretty large group and thought the dinner was going well. Drinks were flowing, people were dancing. All around a good time. \n\nI thought it was a bit on the warm side but when I went to the restroom it was heat stroke inducing! Holy cow. Turns out it was so warm one of the girls in the group had a fainting spell. We took her outside, got her some air and things were ok again. However the door man decided that we were a \"liability\" and decided to repeatedly tell us to leave. In fact he kept coming after me (for some f'd reason) and told me I had to get our group out of there. Wow. I've never been treated that way ever. It's crazy how one ass can basically ruin the night for one group. To top it off, after all this drama, we got to the parking garage a few mins after it was closed, with my car being locked there until the next morning. Arghh. That's a whole 'nother story altogether. \n\nAnyways, what started out as a really good time turned to crap.

She tried to call for reservations.  After being put on hold for 15+ minutes, she had to hang up and call back 1/2 an hour later to make our dinner reservations for 4.  When she finally got through and told them what happened, there was no apology, just a curt \"we were busy\".\n\nI arrived first and the bar was 3/4 full with an after-work crowd.  I waited at the abandoned hostess station for about 5 minutes, but nobody came to greet me.  So I walked to the end of the bar to try and catch someone's attention near the server's station.  I told the bartender  I had dinner reservations.  He smiled graciously, and said \"someone will be right with you\".  \n\nWhile I waited, servers bustled around me, looking harried. A bar hostess, and 2 other wait staff elbowed past me seven separate times with menus, food, drinks and dirty dishes, but no one stopped to ask if I needed help.  I got a couple of dirty looks from the hostess for standing in her way.  Meanwhile, a movie was showing on a large screen over my head.  It was already frenetic enough.  And no one was watching it. This was definitely not Foreign Cinema.  Not even close.\n\nIt was 6:05, before showtime at both the symphony and the ballet, but the dining room was empty.  Not a good sign.  After another eight minutes, the manager finally emerged from the kitchen, looking slightly disheveled.  I snagged him, saying we had 6:00 PM dinner reservations.  He asked if I wanted to wait at the bar, but I had already waited 15 minutes just waiting to talk to him.  I asked to be shown to our table - we had the ballet at 8:00.  Honestly - 15 minutes to just get seated in an empty dining room?!\n\nHe took me to the worst table in the house, next to the kitchen door.  I asked if we could have a banquette instead.  He quickly set that up and seated me.  Presented with menus, I asked if they still had their prix fixe.  He brusquely replied that it's been a while, but no.  Too bad - this used to be a shabby chic, but full dining experience for the pre-show crowd, famous for their satisfying prix fixe menu.  (I had been craving their famous root beer float dessert.)\n\nOur waitress was prompt. The cocktail menu looked impressive so I had a \"Beet It\", infused with ginger and beet juice - fragrant and delicate.  While waiting for my friends to arrive, I saw that the menu had completely changed - it was clearly a bar menu, not intended for a fine dining pre- show crowd. Many items were prepared ahead of time and only needed to be warmed and served. Unfortunately, they had kept the fine dining prices.\n\nAfter we were all assembled, we ordered the Kennebunk fries with house-made aoili and catsup, green salad, clams, butternut squash risotto, mac 'n cheese, and an ahi tuna salad.  My friends ordered drinks, but the beverages straggled to the table. \n\nThe food also arrived out of sync, so we couldn't really eat \"together\".  The fries were slightly soggy - cooked in oil not hot enough to make this appetizer work.  The aoili was bland, but catsup was ok. 1/3 of the clams were missing their insides, but the sauce was tasty - too bad you can't eat the shells.  The salad was uninspired, despite the slab of morbier -  blah presentation and a nothing dressing.  The risotto could have had more flavor and the texture was gummy as opposed to creamy.  Clearly, it had been sitting around for a while.  They used to be good at this - what a shame.  The ahi tuna salad what passable.  At least the sashimi was fresh.  But they completely forgot our mac 'n cheese.  By the time it came, my vegetarian friend was rushing to finish eating to make our showtime.\n\nThe manager graciously comped us their house - made truffles to make up for the computer glitch that lost half our order.  Too bad it was so late that we couldn't eat it at the table.  We ate one on the run and packed the rest to go.  It would have been nice to savor it leisurely, as these may well have been the best thing served that evening.  Sorry, but I will never eat there again.

When we tried to get her attention she rolled her eyes and came over and yet again did not say anything after she took down our order (no confirmation that she understood our order or anything). \n\nWhen our 2 other friends joined in we had to walk to the counter to grab water glasses (they are just standing there, not sure if it's self-service). But even when she saw us get up for the water glasses she didn't come to our table to take their order. When we finally flagged her down she took half of our order and again just walked away. When she came back with their order the rest of the table ordered their drinks and she rolled her eyes again (probably because she was annoyed that she had to walk twice, but had she payed attention at first she could have taken the entire tables order at once). \n\nThe burger from one of my friends came really fast (scary fast actually but that's a different subject), yet the burger from my other friend took a very long time and so did the chicken wings. After we had all our food she again never came and checked on us, eventhough we were standing on dry for awhile now. Mind you, the restaurant was NOT busy at all, besides our table of 6 there may have been 2 tops of 4 at this time and some single customers at the bar (and 2 servers). \n\nWe decided to pay (had she actually done her job \"being a waitress\" she could have doubled the bill, but since no one waited on our table, we didn't order anything anymore). During this process she had at least rolled her eyes twice in front of us and once to her coworker when obviously talking about us (as she was pointing). Then she had the balls to walk up to our table (before we tipped) and say \"just FYI I didn't add the gratuity, which we usually do\" (her tone of voice was as if she was doing us a favor). Obviously this was the straw and by her saying that we decided to not leave her a good tip (we still tipped, which we shouldn't have).\n\nOn top of all this bad customer service one of us saw a MOUSE running through the dining area and was kindly enough to (quietly) tell our server Lea this. When she did, Lea just said \"I'll let the people who take care of these things know,\" no apologies or \"thank you\" what-so-ever. I'm sorry but if customers see a mouse in your restaurant you should apologize and thank them for pointing it out. An actual good restaurant who cares about their reputation would have even offered to take some things off the bill if not everything, but at this point we obviously did not expect anyone in this restaurant to care. Later on we saw the mouse again. Yes, this place has MICE.\n\nThe sad part about our server's customer service (or lack of it) is that she dealt with a group of all hospitality industry folks, who on one side have more patience and understanding of servers as we know how it is to be on that side, but on the other hand, we also know how service SHOULD and COULD be and this was not nearly close.\n\nI will not come back to this place ever again as long as Ms. Lea is still working here (& they still have mice).", "author": "Helen D."}

We finally sat ourselves and waited awhile before a snobby hipster waiter brought us menus, which seemed to greatly inconvenience him. A friendly but fairly incompetent second waiter took our order, which he messed up. His exuberant manner did not make up for waiting nearly an hour for a simple appetizer of olives and peanuts (we reminded him a few different times). The best part of the whole experience was a busser who actually remembered to bring us water when we asked.

Came here with 2 girlfriends for lunch and drinks this past weekend (pride weekend on Sunday).  We were actually excited to find this place...a place to sit down, have a few drinks in the midst of pride.  First come first serve seating so we grab a seat once one frees up.  Our waitress comes over...her name is MAYA... and from the jump I can sense a snotty attitude but didn't mention it until my friend said the same.  She tells us we need to put up a credit card to hold the table.  Kind of overboard (we are not in Vegas at night in an upscale lounge) but  we understood simply due to the fact that it's pride and I'm sure they don't want to take the risk that any drunks will bail on the billl.  Next up she tells us that the water bottles that all 3 of us have (again, its pride...we are hot and staying hydrated) and it truly was water need to go.  Either she can \"confiscate\" them or they need to be put away and not taken out....again comical...\"confiscated\"??  Sweetie you are a waitress not security.... but okkkkk.  We order drinks, appetizers and food.  Our appetizer comes out (wings) and I can tell we will need more napkins.  I ask up front \"can we get more napkins please?\"  Her response - \"I brought napkins\".  She brought 3.  One for each of us with wings?  Not gonna cut it.  Again, her attitude is crap...why not just \"sure\" or go get them....They are NAPKINS!  The food was actually pretty good, and the drinks were not bad either.  Here is the icing on the cake though....as we are finishing up our food the table next to us (with the same server MAYA) gets told (by MAYA) that if they are done and not going to be ordering any more food that they would need to leave since they need the table.  It was downright rude to paying customers.  It's not like they has been sitting there all day.  The experience would have actually been fine had it not been for the wanna be pin up model waitress who think she works in an upscale lounge in Vegas.  We were planning on letting her know she was garbage with her tip...but don't you know it we get the bill and gratuity was already included (for 3 people?) wow.  She did not earn that $13.00 tip she got.,  The other staff seemed ok and seemed to be treating their guests ok..including the waiter we asked for an extra plate since we didn't wanna bother our waitress.....I think we just ended up with a biotch who ruined our experience.  Do yourself a favor and get rid of Maya....I think she's making up policies as she goes and is ruining the customers experience.

Actually, my GF and I were supposed to just have Happy Hour at Soluna.  But the girl went, \"Um, I want dinner now.\"  Sure, why not?.....\n\nDATE:  September 10, 2009 @ 6pm, Girl-bonding dinner with Rebecca after work.\n\nRECOMMEND:\nSoluna is a decent, convenient but pricey dinner option before seeing the Broadway Show \"Wicked\" at the Orpheum which is a skip-hop away. \n\nVENUE/AMBIANCE:  \nPlain outside but the restaurant is impressive when you walk in. The dining area is classy and nicely decorated in  burgundy-dark walls,  heavy velvet curtains and Renaissance-like hanging lamps.  Dark, cozy and romantic. Booths for intimate dining.  \nTHE SCENE:  \nMostly more \"mature\" crowd like people in their 50s and 60s. 40 something  Civic Center professionals in powersuits. Theatre-goers in velvet/silk dresses.  And the likes of me and my GF. :)\n\nFOOD AND DRINKS:\nGF:  BEER ($6) and ARUGULA SALAD ($13) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LsblUPwDEs9EruHSjPmiGg?select=_kgSfPgTuYm0QKI7xxNpeQ\nFresh Arugula, Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese, Figs, Candied Walnuts,\nBosc Pears, Bacon, Red Wine-Pear Vinaigrette: \n*How could I have forgotten that my gf eats like a bird and dinner for her meant a tiny plate or salad?!)  \n\nMe:  BLACK PEPPERCORN COCKTAIL  ($12) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LsblUPwDEs9EruHSjPmiGg?select=flodaXReIRBS7zp4nuYgbQ\n*Interesting drink with bits of peppercorn floating but on the weak side.

She's never had Macapuno ice cream before which is a traditional ice cream flavor in the Philippines. Macapuno is a very tender coconut. Our spoons were happily digging into this dish.\n\nTAB:  $60 something dollars including tax and tip.\n\nOVERALL:  I feel ripped-off! If you're really going to  look at what we ordered, all the dishes were equivalent to just one person's meal:  1 salad, 1 main, dish,  1 beer, 1 cocktail and 1 dessert.  Luckily, my friend eats like a little bird. Otherwise, our tab probably would have been close to double ($100++)!\n\nI think the dishes were pricey for the small portions and for the calibre of the restaurant.  The dishes were forgettable.  I will skip dinner here and stick to their Happy Hour next time!\n\nDespite everything, it was fun girl-bonding with GF Rebecca once again!!!", "author": "Leah E."}

To my surprise, the ketchup was actually quite appreciated. It wasn't as spicy as it might sound, but it did have a little bit of a kick.

Drive by this place on my commute home from work all the time but never bothered to stop in to check out the place. The decor is great, the restaurant and bar area were very clean, they have some great artwork on the walls. I was undecided btw the tuna melt and the burger, I asked the server for his opinion an he suggested the burger. Let me tell you one of the best burgers I've had period, and this is coming from a person who loves to eat!!!! I def recommend coming here and trying it for yourself! Had the white chocolate banana bread for desert and that was pretty delicious as well!

Last week most of the Restaurants around Washington Square and along Columbus Ave. were still closed up at noon.  Yesterday, bright and sunny, walking along Van Ness, someone came out the door of Tommy's Joynt and looking in we were surprised to see the place almost empty as well.    Same for Soluna---three of us in the entire place at noon, and right on the Civic Center at that.  \n\nHmmm.  Well, the food at Soluna was worth it.  I've eaten here before, had cocktails on a couple of other occasions.  It's not a great restaurant, not a culinary wonder, but it's good.   The burger I had yesterday was one of the best I've had in a long time.  The Partner ordered the Thai Chicken salad and it smelled as delicious as he said it turned out to be.   I had the Big Guy Red wine, which was decent, and the french fries, while the softest I've had---reminiscent of those at In N Out (In N Out's weakest link, in my opinion are their fries)--were none the less very flavorful, I liked them.  It's hard to call them fries though as they're hardly crunchy at all, one would almost think they were steamed (they were not soggy, I must hasten to add).\n\nI must say that the town's cooks really need to brush up on what constitutes Rare meat.  I expressed concern that the last two burgers I'd ordered (at other restaurants) came raw, and despite that, my burger was more on the raw than rare side.   More cooked than the other two, but still a bit too much hot meat, not cooked meat.  The waitress didn't think to ask how it came out until the Partner did, but I was too hungry to let anyone get between me and my dead cow.\n\nI will say this, if anyone at Soluna is reading:  The winter sun shone brightly through the tall windows, exposing every facet of Soluna's decor, and it's not a pretty sight.  The exotic, somewhat Middle Eastern looking color scheme was showing its age.   The tented ceiling looked like it was getting dark from hanging too long without laundering;  the paints looked faded and the light colored wood floor was substantially marked up by the bar stools.  The worst of it though were the banquettes whose velvety fabric was over-worn and dark spotted and looked  bad.   Perhaps acceptable for a bar, but a restaurant?  The feel was that of an old movie theater once the bright lights come up...  Maintenance would have been nice, now more is necessary to revive this decor.\n\nStill, if you're in the Civic Center and don't want an expensive meal, or one at a chain, I'd think you'd be happy to eat lunch at Soluna.", "author": "Paul T."}

The bar area was a little bit busy because of their happy hour, but we wanted to sit down and eat dinner anyways.  The dinner area had maybe two tables full at the time - one was a table of 6 and another table of two.  \n\nWe asked the waitress for a table, and she immediately responded with \"Do you have a reservation?\"\n\n\"Um.. No\"\n\n*pause* \"OK. Well, let me see what I can do.\" \n\nAnd here we're thinking, I hope they can get us in! We're starving at this point.  We'd all just gotten off work and drove straight to SF.  She came back to us about 10 minutes later, and said \"OK, I had to do some moving around, but we can get you a sea\"\n\nExcellent! Amazing! Five stars!!!\n\nNo.  Not really. \n\nThe service was AWFUL.  It took the waitress over 30 minutes to take our order and was it because the restaurant got busy? No.  The place stayed pretty much half empty the entire time we were there.   We actually had to get up, and tap our waitress on the shoulder, and ask her to come take our order.\n\nIt then took another hour and half for our food to come out.  The kitchen got slammed, she said, should be another 10 minutes.   30 minutes later, we're still waiting.  We've only been sitting here for an hour, sure put all the happy hour people ahead of us.  We don't mind.  We're only STARVING and about to eat a napkin or pass out. \n\nWhen the food finally came.. Big fat disappointment.  My friend ordered a steak that he polished off in about 3 bites.  He looked like he wanted to cry or kill someone.  The burger with the supposed bacon in the patty, did not taste like it and was really meh.  I've had better burgers at St. Johns in Sunnyvale.  The bleu cheese was really overpowering, and it just didn't balance right.\n\nThe only thing that was amazingly good was the french fries.  But its not enough for me to give them two stars.\n\nI really don't ever want to come back here.  Super over priced, horrible service, and food is just blah. Oh! And because we were a party of 6 they automatically charged us 18%! For what?  Seriously inattentive, horrible service?  If it was up to me, I would've tipped nothing.", "author": "Pamada K."}

That seemed a bit meager so we asked the waitress what she recommended and she that what we ordered was a good amount and to see how we felt after we ate. That was a bit of a surprise to me because I really expected her to take advantage of us and prompt us to order more. We were glad that she suggested so because we were stuffed. \n\nThe waitress was pretty attentive until the end of our meal, which wasn't really an issue; we were not in a hurry to leave.

We asked a few other servers and bartenders, who all acted snotty and giggled to each other, as if we were being super demanding. The story from the kitchen was that they were still plating. Antipasto doesn't even require cooking! But they couldn't even get that out to us. \n\nAfter all of that and the rude responses, we canceled our order, and asked for the check.

I made her aware that we have a show to catch at 8 pm. Our main entrees came first. It was 730 pm and we asked again for the fries and she said the kitchen forgot it again and she said that it will be on the house this time. Cool, right?\n\nBut after a few mins, she came up to us for the 3rd time and told us that the kitchen forgot the fries AGAIN! And she will give us dessert on the house instead. How can the kitchen forget an order for the THIRD time???!!! Crazy!!!

I then asked if I could please see the menu, and she returned and tossed it on our table and walked away.  At this point she deserved a good slap in the face!

Law students from Hastings come here, theatre-goers waiting for their shows come here and tourists out for a stroll by city hall come here.  This bar/lounge feels very light and airy.  Red walls are offset by the blond wood and the light fixtures are eye-catching.\n\nWe hung out here for a couple of hours waiting for our show to start.  Speaking of which, when you order a dinner entree and tell them you are seeing a show, your dessert will be free.\n\nWe had the savory clams (with chorizo, cherry tomatoes and garlic-herb broth), which I highly recommend!  I assumed that since this was an appetizer that it would be small, so I was shocked at the large bowl  that came out.  The clams were perfect and the flavor, wow.  It comes with grilled ciabatta so you can sop up the broth.  We also had the fries with parmesan and white truffle oil.  The fries are good, but not spectacular.  The aioli dipping sauce is fine, but try dipping it in some of that garlic-herb broth you still have left over.\n\nWe also tried the mango creme brulee (vanilla bean custard, mango, turbinado sugar and toasted coconut).  It's not a dessert I'd recommend.  They only call this a mango dessert because of the few chunks sitting on top.  Plus, it comes out cold, so it's pre-made.  Have you had warm creme brulee before?  It's the only way to go.\n\nFor drinks, my friend ordered the Sweet Heat (house infused jalapeno tequila, cilantro syrup, passionfruit, fresh cilantro and soda) and I had the Abbey Road (house infused cucumber gin, basil syrup, meyer lemon, fresh basil and soda).  The spiciness of the Sweet Heat was overwhelmed by the passionfruit, so they need to up the tequila (but who doesn't want more liquor in their drink?).  The Abbey Road was much better and a refreshing drink for the summer.\n\nWe sat at the bar and the service was pretty poor.  The bartender looked like she was crazed, but it wasn't even crowded.

There was an open table by the bar and we waited a good 20 minutes before we were even helped. Once we finally got someone to help us, the waiter obviously could not have cared less about what we wanted. The drinks (2 beers) took a long time to get out to us. As I got my ticket to pay, I noticed they added some food on there and we had not eaten. When I talked to the girl at the register, she checked my table as if I had been lying. I guess I can understand that part but why was the food on there in the first place?  There were a lot of people but not super packed. We figured they might have been overwhelmed and it was just bad timing for us. After the concert we decided to meet some friends there and try our luck again. We figured most of the people were gone so service would have improved. Oh no! It was just as bad if not worse. The hipster bartender was too cool for school and was so rude.

I really enjoyed the food we ordered but again, I felt they were so busy and didn't have time to get us out of there before our show. This is the best location for dining pre Orpheum, so I keep coming back. \n\nLet me break it down - First, my friend had called ahead to reserve tables at the bar for a large (I think 10 or so person) group. We arrived to no tables being saved - awkward. No problem... they let us sit in the restaurant and order off the happy hour menu, which ended up being perfect. Still a little annoying that they had a note to reserve the tables and somehow we slipped between the cracks. \n\nThe small issue occurred when we wanted to pay. We wanted the bill just split in half (1/2 table on one ticket and 1/2 on the other) so it would be easier to pay as a large group and they were unable to do that without us going through the itemized bill and telling them what each person had to eat and drink for the last 2 hours, which wasn't realistic. The servers were really nice, but it was still a little frustrating. :/ \n\nWith that said the food was very good. I was impressed by the burger on the happy hour menu and the delicious crisp fries that came with it. I also had a wonderful Mojito made fresh by the bartender (yum!). Also the Happy Hour menu prices are very reasonable and a good excuse to come back.

Ambiance was lovely, food was better than solid, service was pleasant and nice--and unfortunately slow.  Even drinks from the bar took a very long time to arrive on a Thursday during an early time.  I would recommend getting the comfort food; it was delish.  My daughter's burger was fab--and they were able to make it kids' version (i.e., plain).  Their Mac n' Cheese app was great--with a number of different cheeses in it.  Part of me wishes that it was also offered as a main dish.

Located in the Tenderloin made me a bit apprehensive, but Soluna has been here for years. Time is a good test, right?  \n\nI was greeted quickly & pleasantly -- not b/c there was a lack of clientele, but quite the contrary as this place was relatively crowded for a Sat evening & no city/federal employees or law school faculty/staff! The scene was lively although the lots next door is vacant and the interior had little natural light. The bartender was friendly, and the handcrafted cocktail menu reflected creativity synonymous with the City by the Bay. I echo the 'chill, relax and unpretentious bar (as well as) a cozy and romantic dining area' comments. Great job managing both! \n\nDRINKS - $10/ea & on par for San Francisco.

It was recommended to me by one of my co-workers I finally gave in and decided to try it. \n\nI ordered their house made veggie burger and truffle fries. The garden burger had mushrooms, blue cheese, tomato, greens, and a red wine mustard sauce. Not a bad garden burger, but I've definitely had better. The mushrooms were cooked fine and the veggies were fresh, but the cheese was slightly over powering the whole burger. I could barely make out the red wine mustard on the sandwich. Also, it came on a poppy seed bun which was not indicated on the menu. Not a big fan of it, but this just my personal take. I would have much preferred a regular bun or another kind of some sort. The truffle fries, to my surprise were pretty good. They had a nice little kick to them thanks to the hint of  horseradish aioli (big fan). Seasoning was pretty spot on too. Not much to complain about with the fries. Definitely give them a go.\n\nThe service seemed to be very friendly and timely when I arrived as well. The inside decor is pretty interesting too. The exterior of the building may fool you to think this is just another ordinary cafe/lounge. It's surprisingly roomy with a very chic approach. All in all, not a bad place to try out.

We had tickets to see Wicked at the Orpheum at 8pm and the staff at Soluna insisted we needed to get there at 5:30 to make the show and they gave us a pre-fixe menu - one salad, two entree choices, and one dessert.  \n\nTwo people were running late and the staff made the group wait to order until the whole group was present.  The last two arrived at 6pm.  The waiter didn't take our order for dinner until 6:20.  Drinks were slow and we had to ask several times for  bread.  The salad (no choice for this, could have been prepared in advance) didn't arrive until 7:00pm!  Bread didn't arrive until after the salads.  So a group of 15, including several small children, have been sitting with not a single bit of food for 90 minutes!\n\nAt this point, several people have \"waited\" on us and insist that there's no problem, we'll get to the show on time, not to worry.

I had reservations for about 5 other places till finally deciding on Soluna to eat at, for several different reasons.\n1.The prefix wasn't OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced by any means compared to several other places i inquired with.(36$ compared to a 75$ per person)\n\n2.The atmosphere was said to be romantic and a cozier feeling, which meant to me that it wasnt so big that it felt cold, and the ambiance shown from the pictures looked dim lit and very romantic to me at least.\n\n3.Lastly I was searching for a place that would have great atmosphere and amazing food but didnt want something  too elite that my boyfriend was forced to wear a jacket. Soluna was described as casual elegant, therefore i could dress up without looking overdressed, and he could do the same..(aka he wore his vans with dress pants...so sexy haha)\n\nUpon arriving, we were asked to wait at the bar for a few minutes, although we had a reservation for 7:45, but didnt bother us at all. The atmosphere was very romantic, lighting was dim, it was NOT LOUD at all, but more of a murmur of whispers, which was a little sexy to me. The music played also added to the ambience which was a lounge type, zero 7ish style.\n\n We were seated quickly after being placed at the bar to a table that was slightly close to the others, but wasn't invasive.We actually had several different waitresses from the time we were seated till the end, which was kidnof expected due to the 'holiday'. \n\nFrom the Prefixe menu, my boyfriend ordered the mac n cheese for the first course, and the New York Strip for the main entree. I ordered the caesar salad and the crab stuffed ravioli. We also ordered the bread and olive oil 'on request'. \n\nMy caesar salad was ABSOLUTELY delicous, very crisp, sort of iceberg style, where you cut your own bite sized pieces. Jareds mac n cheese, was an explosion of delicious cheese's combined, which came in a small plate, but was very filling. The bread came out a little late, but didnt bother us much.\n\nMy main course was probably one of the best meals I had in a while. 4 large raviolis stuffed with crab in this creamy seafood sauce, which I WISH i knew what was in it, because it was absolutely delicious. Jared's steak was good, but was infatuated with the vegetables served in this soy sauce, and the potatoes, which were like a fried potato puff, with creamy mash potatoes in the middle, There was also a wasabi like collored drizzle served with them. All tasted delicious and complimented eachother beautifully.\n\nLastly even though we were stuffed, we had our eyes on peoples desserts the second we walked in, and wanted the chocolate cake with chocolate covered strawberries on top. However, they ran out right before us so instead got the chocolate covered strawberries, alone. We didnt realize we both got a dessert, so we had 6 huge chocolate covered strawberries to share. Needless to say we left absolutely STUFFED!!\n\n\nWe asked the waitress, who served us for the majority of the end of our meal (whom was an absolute doll) if we should call a cab, or hail one,  and they said they would call one for us. \n\nWe were walking out to leave when the owner, Ed Ivey came up to us on the phone saying he was trying to get us a cab, but it may be a few minutes due to the night. With no answer on the other end, Ed hung up the phone asked us where we were staying, and said if you don't mind riding in his car he would love to take us AND DROVE US BACK TO OUR HOTEL!!!!!!! saved us 10 bucks and TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! It was an already absolutely enjoyable meal, and that was the icing on our already eaten dessert, (cake).\n\nIf your in the mood for a romantic, delicious and gourmet meal & dessert with exceptional customer service, eat at Soluna you wont regret it! :)\n\nand if your reading:\n THANKS ED AGAIN, YOUR HOSPITALITY BLEW US OUT OF THE WATER, AND YOUR RESTAURANT HAD US COMING BACK FOR MORE, WE\"LL SEE YOU SOON FOR LUNCH!!\n:)", "author": "Kai N."}

My friend and I ordered a salad (forgot the name) but it was very interesting. Had huge lettuce leaves and some bacon crisps on it. Seemed pretty light and tasted good. Also got the oysters which were very fresh and tasty, and ended with the mac n cheese, which was very hot and cheesy, but didn't taste too rich. All three dishes were appetizers, but we weren't too hungry and wanted to try a bit of everything, so they were definitely good choices. \n\nFinally we had dessert and picked the chocolate pretzels. I never heard of them before, so wanted to give them a try. They were definitely interesting. I expected them to be shaped like a pretzel, but it was just a little bun with chocolate inside. It was very warm, and came with extra chocolate sauce and also their special honey peanut butter sauce, which i LOVED.

And maybe a gigantic grinder of black PEPPER.  With instructions.  Maybe even a video.\n\nThe food here is WOEFULLY under seasoned, and in some cases the flavor combinations are ill conceived.   \n\nFor example, I tried the lamb shanks last night, which were served with baby vegetables and an orange gremolata over blue cheese mashed potatoes.  With all the ingredients in the gremolata, the only thing I could taste was ORANGE--overpowerlingly so, and there was absolutely no hint of the blue cheese in the potatoes.  \n\nThe lamb at least tasted a bit like lamb, but the whole thing suffered from a lack of salt and pepper in preparation.  If you don't season as you go with dishes that have as many ingredients and layers of flavor as this one, there is no way you can add enough salt and pepper later to salvage the dish.  Sadly, the lamb shanks themselves were rather unappetizingly prepared, with a lot of the stringy, greyish connective tissue still attached.\n\nThe result was a plate full of food with literally dozens of ingredients, each one of which should bring some flavor to the party, but what I ended up with was a mess of a plate with no flavor at all.\n\nIt was just as bad last night on IQ's side of the table.  His fried chicken breast was crispy and the breading was not burnt, but again, the dish completely lacked flavor, both in the chicken's flesh and in the otherwise decently textured breading.  The mashed potatoes under this plank of chicken were similarly underseasoned, and the watermelon relish on the side was bland, watery, and unappetizing.\n\nThe only item on our table last night that was an unqualified success was the delicately seasoned, flaky and tender biscuit.  Of course, a biscuit is born to hold butter, and nary a pat was found on our table.\n\nService is indifferent here, too.  We had an hour to finish our meal before the opera, something we made clear to the restaurant when we made our reservations and again when we arrived, but there was a bit too much time before we could order, and once the food arrived, the checkback came late.  I needed a steak knife for my meat, and when you have to wait for someone to troll by to get one, it's an extra aggravation.\n\nWe go to the opera or the symphony with a reasonable amount of frequency and it would be great if this was a reliable choice for a good supper before hand--especially when you're larding up for a 3 1/2 hour marathan like last night's performance of Idomeneo at the opera---but sadly I don't think Soluna fits the bill for us.", "author": "Kevin S."}

The two side vegetables (zucchini & potatoes) that came with the meal were also excellent.\n\nMy friend had the Civic Burger - really, really tasty.  The bun so was so light, the meat was juicy and the picked red onions added just enough saltiness.  However, she said the fries were so-so.\n\nSome tips, you need to ask the waitress for bread which we did and the bread came promptly. If you show your waitress your show tickets, the restaurant will comp you one free dessert.  Comping the dessert itself is worth 2 stars as described below.\n\nFor dessert, we ask the waitress what she recommends and she said the White Chocolate Bread Pudding is outstanding. The bread pudding portion was large enough for two people to share. The bread pudding was accompanied by a scoop of homemade vanilla bourbon ice cream - creamy, not too sweet, and the bourbon was not strong at all.  The bread pudding itself was awesome.

I like the manager and the owner, and I've found the wait staff to be friendly.   \n\nDo you sense a but?  But  . . .  .  But . . . .  Generally, we (my office) tried to be promoters (have office lunches there, parties, drinks), and yet there have been some issues.  \n\nOne, no half price drinks at the tables?  We were regulars, and I raced in to have my one drink half price (before starting to pay full) and talked about it audibly in front of our server, and I was charged full price (as were my friends).  The restaurant was empty.  They said it was okay to sit at the table, and not word one about the \"no half price\" even though we were regulars. That was not cool.   \n\nTwo, I had a party there:  talked about it in advance with the owner, thought I had it all worked out.  Went a day or two before to work out the menu details, and somehow, it hadn't gotten on the calendar (apparently, it was not communicated to the manager).  No big deal, these things happen, but they were all quite snippy about it .  I understand that they were stressed, but it was not my fault, and life is too short not to try to take stuff in stride.   Then, when we arrived for the party?  No party for us in sight.   Hastings students everywhere.  Fine, but they could have moved them up front.   Or told me.  There was a very uncomfortable feeling that it was our fault.  Not cool.  Waited a good half hour b/f everything settled in, and then it was fine.\n\nI still like the concept, but I will say that we have moved elsewhere most nights for drinks.   We used to go only to Soluna, and now we crawl the Tenderloin.  Which has been good for expanding my horizons and my enthusiasm for the TL, which has a lot to offer.  I still go to Soluna for the occasional lunch and the occasional drink, but my enthusiasm (our enthusiasm) (meaning my office's) is dashed.  In fairness, I think the people are nice, but it really wasn't a good feeling.   There were a few other more subtle dis experiences like this, too.  So the bloom's off the Soluna.

RUDE!  At every step the waiter brought more bread, more food, and never balked at trying to improve a 'bad' experience this couple had fabricated.  So kudos to the staff for excellent service even for those who don't deserve it.\n\nThere was nothing about my dining experience that required complaining about.

The ambiance is nice, plush red booths in the back of the restaurant and a nicer feel than it gives off on the outside. Once in, I decided to go for the salmon burger and Mac and cheese. Priced at $12/each, the portions and quality were definitely subpar. The sandwich was dry and bland, the Mac and cheese was good but a pretty small portion for the price. Since I was using the deal I wasn't too concerned with the price, but had i paid full price i would have been much more disappointed. To top it off, they included 18% gratuity for a party of 1 (apparently part of the scoutmob deal although I've never had to pre-tip when I've used it before) and then they ALSO taxed the gratuity...wait, isn't that illegal?! I'm preeetty sure it is. When I asked the server about it she just said a lot of ppl ask the same question but she doesn't know. \n\nAt the end of the meal my bill racked up to about $20 which is more than I usually spend on a Monday afternoon, but more importantly, I just didn't enjoy my meal.

The website had about 12 suggestions and each restaurant offered \"come to our restaurant and we'll give you a free a) drink b) appetizer 3) dessert when you show us your ticket stub\". UM AWESOME. So, we did. I looked at all 12 and ended up choosing Soluna. I am sooo glad I did for the following reasons: \n\n1) Did I say it's only 2 blocks from the theatre? No more \"re-parking\" and paying another $20 to park at another garage. \n\n2) Wine list is to die for \n\n3) The waitress took our coats and hung them in the back so they didn't get wrinkled. \n\n4) The menu is small which is awesome so you don't have to think too hard about what you want to eat. \n\n5) Ordered the crab stuffed Sole.

We didn't have a reservation so they offered my partner and I a seat at on of the tables in the bar area. Those tables have those high bar stools. My partner sat down and mentioned that this would be quite uncomfortable for a whole meal (she's about 5' tall and I'm a couple inches shorter so our feet dangle a great deal). The host overheard me suggest that we go somewhere else and quickly offered us a regular table with the condition that we complete our meal by 6:30pm for a reservation they were expecting. This wasn't a problem to us but the entire place was empty so I wasn't sure why it was necessary. \n\nI told the waiter that I wanted the prixe fix menu (one starter, one entree, one dessert) and that made him anxious due to the time constraint. Again, the place was empty, so why wouldn't they have time for this? We understood the time issue and we weren't intending to dilly dally or to give the wait staff a hard time. They seated a table of 4 right next to us who also didn't have a reservation. Our waiter was extra nice to them -- a table of 4 older people (one with a loud Hawaiin-style shirt with the Golden Gate Bridge all over it), emphasizing that they can take their time and even chatting it up with them. He showed a completely different personality with them. He treated us like we were a burden. \n\nAs for the food, I liked 2 of the 3 tunas (served 3 ways: ceviche, poke and, my least favorite, peppercorn crusted). The peppercorn crusted was served with bland haricot verts and the ahi tuna was lacking flavor and overrun with pepper.The lamb was awesome and the risotto and veggies were pretty good. The bacon wrapped halibut was good but still felt like it was missing something. My partner really liked the baby spinach and pear salad. \n\nOur time was now 6pm (a half hour before our promised time to exit) so I decided to take my dessert to go. I was full, anyway. The waiter gave us dessert menus and emphasized \"to go, right?\" several times, like he was rushing us out. There were still several open tables at this time. I got the strawberry shortcake (delicious vanilla gelato and strawberries, topped with a cookie so bland that I threw it out). It took them a while to get us the bill and now at 6:30pm, there were still open tables. I was looking for the couple with the reservation that were to take over our table and there weren't any. They didn't have reason to rush us at all. \n\nWe felt judged and mistreated, concluded that it was because we looked ordinary and didn't display any reason for them to kiss our ass. Overall I was uncomfortable and most of the food was lacking and overpriced. It was a depressing first impression.

I asked the waitress about the temperature of the roast turkey sandwich and she said the meat was \"room temperature\"... I explained that I am pregnant and food has to be served hot for food poisioning concerns, then through lots of round and round she said yes it was cooked in the oven at the time of serving (earlier she said the turkey is roasted in the morning then sits out throughout the day and is sliced at serving time, which seems against food code).  Well I get the sandwich (which was over half dark meat on the sandwich, maybe that is to be expected but it shocked me) and she was correct, the meat was ROOM TEMPERATURE.  So I flagged someone else down (our waitress never once returned to our table) and asked that they heat up the sandwich and explained I do need the meat hot.  That took over 10 minutes.  When I got the sandwich at a temperature I could actually eat there was no extra flavor, just plain turkey and bland cheese.  They must have forgot the dijon sauce, or just put so little on it didn't have flavor.  I was so hungry I ate half and put the other half aside, when the manager asked how it was I explained I have to take it home to add flavor to it and I had flagged down another waiter to get a cup of soup.  Well over 10 minutes later 2 cups of soup come... the manager offered to box up my sandwich and said the $3.50 soup was complimentary, which I guess was a better option to them than the $12 sandwich that I didn't like, but I could tell they wouldn't take it off the bill so I might as well get a few dollars worth of the sandwich with some Hidden Valley Ranch dressing.... or ANYTHING really.  Then the bill comes, they had double charged the soup... after 7 minutes they came to pick up the credit cards and I explained so they took the second soup off the bill.  I will say the carrot ginger soup was quite good.  But it wasn't worth the $16.00 bill and hour and 15 minutes.

Definitely one of the better options in you're in the Civic Center area.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAhhh...dining in the TL. I wanted to like Soluna, I really did. It's one of the only decent lunch spots around my office building, so I had high hopes. Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I was totally disappointed. I had the Mediterranean Salad, which was really lacking in flavor. Just a few olives, iceberg lettuce (which I hate), a little feta, and some pine nuts. It was supposed to be accompanied by warm pita bread, but instead came with a couple of pieces of stale bread. My dining companion's Nicoise salad looked a hell of a lot better. Service was great though, so maybe I'll be back...I'll just be sure to order something different.", "author": "Brianne K."}

I was kind of cautious after the mixed reviews here...but I have to say we were very happy with our experience. We had reservations for 6:30 but we got there at 6 hoping to be sat a little earlier so we wouldn't be rushing to get to the 8 o'clock show and they sat us right away. \n\nWe had to do the Prix Fixe Menu so I ordered the Arugula salad and the New York Strip and my boyfriend ordered the Caesar salad and the New York Strip. My salad was pretty good, but the Caesar salad was VERY good. Our steaks came with \"crisp potato puffs\" that were unlike any form of potato I've had before and were just to die for. For dessert, I had the Creme Brulee which was amazing and my bf had the bread pudding which he enjoyed very much. \n\nWe didn't have to wait long for our food, but the girl that was bringing out the food to the tables didn't seem to know where the food went. She gave our salads to the table next to us and almost gave our steaks to them as well. And then after we had finished our steaks she brought the entrees of the table next to us to our table. It wasn't a big deal, just a little annoyance. As for the decor, I didn't have any problems with it whatsoever.\n\nWe were out of there by 7:30 and walked to the theatre with time to spare.", "author": "Adrienne M."}

The hostess said that we can be seated whenever we wanted and so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. First the bartender ignored us for a good 5 minutes (we were the only ones sitting at the bar). Second, he avoided eye contact at all cost for another 5 minutes while he took the orders of two ladies that came up after us. (I promise I showered and smelled rather nice if I don't say so myself).  He finally acknowledge us and said he would be right with us, didn't hand us a drink or wine menu (that would have taken him 1/2 a second to place in our hands). The \"be right with you\" took another few minutes to materialize. \n\nWe finally got our glasses of wine and we're ready to move to our table, we flagged down the hostess and she brushed us off with \"I'll be right with you\" ....forgetting that we already had a reservation. She disappeared for a sometime before coming up to us apologizing that she  totally forgot about us. (figured)\n\nAh, we finally get seated and the waitress was great. The food was really delicious and that made everything else in the service department a littler more tolerable. \n\nAnother odd thing though, it was barely 8PM and it looked they were getting ready to close up. Amidst our dessert eating they started turning out lights in the back area of the dinning room (which we were right next to), they started lowering a screen right above our table for projecting a film or some sort. We had asked them what they were doing and the waitress said they rarely use the tables in the back after 8PM and they often show films on the lowered screen - which is fine but it was kinda odd to do all of this right above us and around us as were eating. They literally could have waited 5 minutes and we would have been out of there. \n\nAnyways, go there for the food. Don't expect much in the way of real service except for your waitress maybe but, I think we got lucky and had like the best-est one in the house.", "author": "Kristina A."}

As we had been there before and didn't remember anything unpleasant we thought we'd go again.\nFirst off we had no reservations so we had to sit at the bar section as there was a party coming in soon.  The service was mediocre up to the point the party started to arrive.  Then it became almost inexistent.  Although the staff was friendly when we saw them they were never there.  Guess they were following the tips from the big party.\nWe ordered from a very limited menu.  I had the fried chicken and my date the pork loin.  The loin was ok and really no complaints.  However the chicken was served in four pieces.  A leg, thigh, wing, and what looked like a chicken strip (or tender).  All the chicken was very undercooked with red around the bones.  That is all except the strip.  That was ok, however, like I said it was skinless (like a chicken tender) and had a completely different taste to the batter.  Since it tasted like a buffalo wing I suspect it came from the bar appetizer menu.  How it made it to my plate I will never know.  In addition to the chicken the menu stated I was to get a biscuit.  Looked high and low, no biscuit.\nI was going to give the place two stars and one last thing came to mind.  Fruit flies were everywhere.  We were constantly waving them away from our faces and our plates.  That tells me something somewhere is not being attended to.  Maybe I should post this to the Board of Health.\nAll and all, the location is good if you need something close before attending the theater but you may want to explore a short cab ride to a better place.", "author": "Tod S."}

The food is very good. Our party had the butternut squash risotto, the Arctic char, the fried chicken and the rib eye steak. Everyone loved their main course! Unfortunately it went downhill from there. One in our party wanted dessert but actually had to get up to go find someone to bring us dessert menus. We ordered one dessert, two coffees and one tea. The dessert (two scoops of interesting apple ice cream) took 15 minutes, the coffees arrived after the dessert was gone and the tea arrived 5 minutes after that. The waitress sort of apologized and said that we wouldn't be charged for the coffees but they were on the final bill. We asked her to remove them, which she did, but in splitting the bill among three credit cards, she charged $65 to one, $130 to another and $195 to the third, not exactly even. When we asked for a correction, that took another 5 minutes. It was harder to take given that a 20% gratuity was automatically entered for our party of six.

Perfect location, 5 minute walk. 4 if it's super cold.\n\nDidn't make reservations - (long story) so did a walk in (6:15) and sat at the bar tables.  Nice interior, needs a curtain at the door to block freezing breeze that blows on all the people at the front bar/bar tables.\n\nDespite the air temp, the restaurant has a warm, neighborhood feel.  No pretention or a \"trying-too-hard\" vibe.\n\nGLASSES DO NOT RUNNETH OVER:  Funny, but I barely remember how the service was.  I guess it's because the staff didn't really pay too much attention to us.  Host was pleasant.  Our waiter was nice.  Friendly validation of what I ordered. Nice touch.  However, let our water glasses run dry. \n\nMARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB and AN ORANGE:  The menu is simple.  Not too many choices, however; too many can worry me.  I had nicely cooked lamb served on top of blue cheese mashed potatoes. (really? blue cheese, couldn't taste that element but tasty nevertheless)  But with many bites, i did taste something...couldn't put my finger on it.  I guess I was tasting the orange...too much. Overpowered many bites of the lamb, but it was perfectly cooked !!\n\nBrussell sprouts, and side of peas and carrots alll not cooked enough for my liking.  A bit too raw. (my dining companion liked them that way though...)  They needed a little salt and pepper too.\n\nMr. C had the steak which was also cooked perfectly with green bean sides.  He enjoyed it.  They left the fat on which is always nice to see.  keeps in the juice/flavor of the meat.\n\nPortions were just right.  (had the parmesean fries before at a soiree along with mini-cheeseburgers.  both were great!)\n\nLIBATIONS:  Very simple wine list.  Not many choices.  Good mixed drink list.   My reisling was chilled just perfectly.  A rarity these days.  Friend had an after-dinner scotch.  \n\nTHE PRICE IS RIGHT:  All the main dishes were around $25.  Affordable prices as compared to other places downtown. \n\nIT'S SHOW TIME:  With a drink each,  1 course and good conversation, we were out in 1 hour and 20 minutes.  (anything additionally ordered may have cause a bit of a time crunch.)  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  It's a no bells and whistles menu, service or atmosphere package, but unbeatable location for any nearby production.

Got seated at 6:45, thinking we had a relaxing hour to eat.  When the waitress came to take drink orders, we said, \"we'd like to get our meal orders in now too, as we have an 8 p.m. show to catch.\"  So we ordered.  Two of us requested hamburgers; one of us salmon.  The orders were place before 6:55.  Time went by and the food didn't come.  At about 7:15 the waitress told us she'd checked with the kitchen and that our order was coming right up.  At 7:20, she came by and advised that she now had an \"ETA from the kitchen. It was going to be 8-10 more minutes.  The reason things were taking so long was because the hamburger eaters had requested that the meat be cooked well done.\"  Really?  The need to cook the burgers a few extra minutes was the cause of an exceptionally long wait?  Well, whatever.  Also, at this point she offered to bring us bread for the first time (it appeared that bread was brought to all of the other tables out of the gate).  More time passed.  At 7:33, I got rude.  \"We ordered two burgers and a hunk of fish!  What's the deal??\"  The waitress disappeared into the kitchen and did not return until 7:38, our food in hand.  So, we literally gobbled it down, in under 10 minutes, and rushed out.  Nothing was cut off the bill despite a wait that would have been unreasonable even if the restaurant didn't know we had a show to make (it did), and even though it acknowledged the exceptional wait for food and knew we were upset.  And, to top things off, the hamburgers--which, according to the restaurant, caused substantial delay by virtue of us requesting that they be cooked well--were medium rare in the middle! \n\nAny, slow, slow service.  Don't trust this place if you're in a rush, or even if you've given yourself what normally should be sufficient time, but you do have an important appointment following. \n\nFinally, I should say that the waitress was polite throughout.

The bartenders attitude left a little to be desired (but could have been that I only ordered sparkling water).  Then in walked a bunch of free loading politicos (SFWPC).  They basically set up shop and spent very little money (poor manager/owner).\n\nSo my two friends arrived and we made our way to our table.  Our server Jennifer (I think) was helpful (truthful in her suggestions) and on top of our every need.\n\nWe were given an amose bouch that was very tasty.... wish I could recall all that was in it.\n\nApps - we shared the following\nHeirloom Tomato Salad - It was wonderful the tomatoes were like they were just plucked from the vine.\nCeviche - SO FREAKING GOOD! Wish there would have been more... lol, but still enough for us to share.\nSpinach Soup - Also really well done and not too heavy (enough for three of us to share).\n\nEntrees - \nBoth my friends ordered the Grilled Wagyu Ranchera Steak - This rocked.  Great flavor and a generous portion.  Tho they don't ask how you'd like the steak cooked and it was a little rare for all of us, but so good we didn't care.\nI ordered the Albacore Tuna.  Here is where they really shined in my opinion.  The tuna that was brought out was not to my taste  I knew in one bite that I would not enjoy the dish.  I told Jennifer that the fish didn't taste right to me and she immediately offered to get me another attempt at the same dish or another dish all together.  I opted for another dish.  I asked to have either the risotto or the steak (which my friends were enjoying) whichever would be done first.\n\nJennifer returned moments later to let me know I'd be having the risotto and to give me a side plate of the quinoa 'salad' to hold me over (and allow me something to eat while my friends were eating) until my entree arrived.\n\n\n\nThe risotto was by far the star of the entrees.  So well done that I didn't want to share any with my friends (tho I did)\n\nThat alone would have me coming back.  Amazing customer service through and through.\n\nWe finished with the following Desserts -\nZeppoles - very good\nWhite Chocolate Bread Pudding (huge portion and by far one of the best bread puddings I've ever had).\nPeach Baked Alaska (also a generous portion) and so good... and I'm not a fan of peaches.\n\nI for one will be returning and telling all my friends etc. to go here.\n\nIt's my understanding that they have at some point changed ownership (don't quote me on this) which might be why the service seems better then the previous reviews.", "author": "redd n."}

We were seated promptly and our drinks were good (1 Civic Cooler - very refreshing and the cardamom was a nice touch, 1 Iced Tea - peachy/fruity, no sweetener needed).  Our food came after a short wait (the cafe started to fill up quickly at this point) and was excellent.  I had the Asiago Salad (Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese is wonderfully tangy, mild, and smooth) with added Florida Rock Shrimp = all ingredients were deliciously fresh. We also had a cup of tomato bisque (Fresh and acidic, rounded out by some nice olive oil) and some mac & cheese... WOW, decadent is the only way to describe that sumptuous, molten, sinfully smooth and creamy delight! It wasn't even my dish and I ate half of it! I even tried to get the recipe (*darn!!! No luck*) so that I wouldn't have to catch BART every time I want that dish from now on.  Seriously - it's the best tasting mac & cheese I've had yet (though I've yet to go on a mac & cheese mission yet ^_~).\n\nI'd have given 5-Stars if our waitress hadn't seemed to be running the whole cafe -- she was everywhere and seemed to be doing a good job, but since she was everywhere, she wasn't as accessible for refills or our bill).

So, loyal Yelp reader, why is this so? BECAUSE THEY NEVER BROUGHT US OUR FOOD. We sauntered in last night for a quick meal before I was dragged to see Phantom of the Opera at the Orpheum. Actually we did not saunter. Only cowboys can saunter. I am not a cowboy. I guess I waddled in. (Disclaimer, I needed to mention the show because it factors into the atrocious service we experienced. I would rather clean my ears with sandpaper than ever have to sit through that audio vomit ever again.) \n\nWe were seated quickly at the bar. That was last time anything happened quickly or efficiently. It took the bartender about 10 minutes to ask us for our drink orders. Call me wacky and demanding, but when you are sitting at the BAR, shouldn't this be a priority. (I know, I'm a jerk for being so demanding.) When my Old Fashioned landed in front of me I was shocked to find out that Old Fashioneds were mostly soda water and only a splash of bourbon. What's that you say? Old Fashioneds are mostly bourbon and a splash of soda water? Don't tell LISA the bartender at Soluna that. She'll probably disagree with you. Because she feels the need to make cocktails with as little alcohol as possible. \n\nWe then ordered some food. And waited, and waited, and waited. I saw plenty of food coming out of the kitchen...and all of it went to other people, including a couple who sat down and ordered AFTER us. After 30 minutes, we asked Lisa about our food. You would think that the steamed clams we ordered as an appetizer would have come out. (We're talking about a fairly idiot proof procedure here: put a little bit of water in a boiler, heat it up, add clams.) If you cannot get an appetizer in front of a patron in 30 minutes, there is something seriously wrong with you. It was then that we began to wonder if Lisa the non-alcohol serving barmaid had even placed our order. We asked about the status of our order. She told us that the kitchen was really backed up because of all the people who were there to go to the opera. Then she brought us our water. The water we asked for 30 minutes ago. The Water Resource Board would like to personally thank Lisa for her water conservation efforts. By ignoring requests for water, she is saving one of our most precious resources. \n\nAt no point did Lisa offer an apology or say that she would try to speed things along. My fiance asked me if I wanted to order another drink. I declined because I did not want to be charged for another glass of soda water with some bourbon for color. At 45 minutes we had to pull the plug. We realized that we were never going to get our food. My friend had to literally wave at Lisa to get her attention. WE THEN APOLOGIZED TO HER and said we had to cancel our order because of time constraints. Lisa gave us the bill and walked away. She never offered a single word in apology for the absolutely crappy service she had graced us with. Not wanting to feel like a total cad, I left her a tip anyway. The more I think about it, I want that $5 back. I will need it to buy some TP, because Lisa from Soluna crapped all over us.", "author": "Chris I."}

I should have known something was wrong when I tried to call the day before to add one more person to my party.\n\nI called at 11:28am, not realizing that the restaurant didn't open until 11:30am. But the phone was picked up, and no one said a greeting. I said \"hello,\" phone was still off-hook, and then was promptly hung up. Okay. Maybe they didn't realize someone was on the other end.\n\n2 hours later the restaurant called me to confirm the reservation. I added an extra person to my party and then asked if there was a fixed menu only for New Year's Eve. The hostess said I could order whatever I liked from the menu. She did not say that yes, there was a fixed menu, nor said what the price would be. I assumed what was on the website was correct. She was about to hang up on me when I stopped her to ask if there was a vegetarian option. I can't remember if she put me on hold or not, but did say that yes, there was a vegetarian option.\nImagine my surprise when on New Year's Eve, I go back to the website to find out the type of food being served to notice that the 3-course fixed prix is now $60, same menu as before, but is labeled as a 4-course, when there is no 4 courses. \nI still go to the restaurant with my party to find out what the true story is, only to find out that the $60 is correct. And that there is not a vegetarian restaurant. The hostess was told by her manager to say that there was, and that they would create something on the spot for any vegetarians. No thank you!

The menu looked great, and we tried a wide range of items (thanks to many small plates).  Everything was good, but not great.  Something seemed to be wrong with each item, even though nothing was bad.  For drinks, they assembled a Westland martini as ordered (vodka with Bombay Sapphine instead of vermouth).  Plenty of good wines by the glass, too.  The first item was a mixed-green salad, which was a bunch of fresh but undistinguished leaves drenched in vinegar.  No oil detected.  Strange, but we were 3/4 of the way through it before we really figured out what was wrong (too focused on the conversation).  The garlic and truffle fries WERE good, though.  Hot, crispy, flavorful, light on actual truffle spirit but simply good no matter what they're called.  There was an aioli afterthought on the plate, too, which didn't get much attention.  Next was tuna three ways--ceviche, crudo, and seared ahi sashimi.  The first two ways were great, the last...almost but not quite.  Something about the seasoning made the sashimi strangely bitter, in a Lagunitas IPA sort of way.  But, yeah, OK.  Last was lamb chops, medium rare.  The chops were oddly tiny, but the meat was good, there was little fat to trim off, and the preparation was perfect.  A side of green garlic and asparagus risotto had wonderful flavor, but odd texture (why the clumps of unseasoned rice in the middle of the mix?).  Also odd, but good for me, was the vast plate of cooked vegetables that flanked the tiny lamb bits.  4 whole cooked carrots.  A pile of tasty brussels sprouts.  4 long sprigs of broccolini.  All coated in a wonderful sauce and cooked to the right texture.  But why did they chill the plate?  The plate rim was well below room temperature when I first touched it, and the food quickly chilled as well.  Yeah, odd.  Dessert was a strawberry shortcake with vanilla ice cream.  The shortcake was baked with a hard outer shell, and the top of the crust was sliced off and used to cap the whole assembly--but it was hard, dry, and seemed a little stale.  Yeah.  Great fruit and ice cream, though.  \n\nPrices were not outrageous, the atmosphere was pleasant, and the service was warm, friendly, helpful, and efficient.

I had dinner at Soluna with 2 friends last night before seeing Wicked at 8 and our server, Tony (?), was absolutely wonderful. He helped my friend, Nicky, choose her Manila clam appetizer (which she loooved), made jokes, kept our glasses filled and even made me aware of the pork in the mac and cheese that I ordered because (I'm assuming) he overheard my conversation with my friend about why I, as a Jew, can't eat clams. I ordered the prix fixe dinner ($36 +3 for steak) with the mac and cheese (minus the pancetta), NY strip with broccoli and potato puffs, and white chocolate bread pudding with cinnamon gelato. It was amazing:) Especially the dessert. Mac and cheese was a little bland...I'm guessing it would have been awesome with the pork. Steak was very tasty, as were the broccoli and onions. Potato puffs tasted a little strange...like there was cinnamon in them. My friends had the Manila clams, lamb shank with baby carrots and blue cheese risotto and huckleberry creme brulee (Nicky), as well as the Goat cheese and spinach salad, Ahi tuna and trio of sorbets (Desiree). Both loved their meals, although the sorbets weren't that impressive to D. The clams were spicy and plentiful and the lamb was cooked to perfection and awesome with the tangy blue cheese risotto. Desiree raved about the Tuna, as well. The food was definitely about 4 stars, but the service pushed it to 5. \n\nEspecially when you factor in the fact that I had initially made reservations for 515, but called to say I was late due to parking (at 520) and the hostess pushed my reservation to 530 to accommodate me.

We were looking for somewhere close to the Orpheum for a special dinner. This fit the bill.  The incredible service started 2 weeks before our reservation when the owner called to inform me that a party had booked the front of the restaurant for a private event. We were still welcome but he wanted to make sure it wouldn't be too noisy. I told him that we had theater tickets for that night and decided to keep the reservation. He offered us a bottle of champagne to make up for it. When we arrived the hostess wished us a happy anniversary and escorted us to a plush velvet booth in the back corner where a bottle of champagne was waiting on ice for us. I don't remember all the things we ate, but I do remember that they were all amazing, including 3 or 4 small dishes that we didn't even order but the chef sent out for us to try. By the time they brought out the 3 home-made sorbets we were completely stuffed. Every single person working that night stopped by over the course of the evening to wish us a happy anniversary, including the owner. It was truly a magical meal. With the free champagne and several free dishes, the bill ended up being quite reasonable as well. As we left for the theater, Myshelle told me she felt like a queen. Exactly how my girl deserves to feel on our anniversary. Thanks Soluna for an unforgettable anniversary!! We look forward to sharing another one with you next year.", "author": "Aaron M."}

There are not many restaurants near the theater or in walking distance, which was the main reason we came here. Soluna gets pretty crazy from 6pm on as the theater crown fills the restaurant. We were seated a half an hour late. As we waited at the bar, we were not acknowledged once other than the one time the bartender took our order. When we were finally seated, the servers were curt and hardly gave us the time we deserved. Plus, the tables are so close together that my elbows were practically touching the diners on either side of me. Once we got our food - in reasonable time - we didn't see the server again until we had to flag her down for more water and the bill. Our entire dinner, we didn't get a water refill and we didn't get checked on. We were asked if we were going to the theater, thinking they had intentions of making sure we made it out in time, but they practically ignored us. The food was mediocre, I probably would have liked it better if I wasn't in such an unfriendly atmosphere. Also, fairly unrelated, but still a first impression - not only were the servers curt and overall not warm, they all had very little pride in their appearance, most with uncombed and wild hair - I felt uneasy that there was a very good chance that I would find hair in my food.

I just went on their website which makes the place look really romantic and all - and \"romantic\" was NOT my memory of it. I remember just a kind of lunch bistro -- no cloths on the tables or anything.   Has it changed a lot recently or -- am I not remembering correctly?

Recent reviews complaining of poor, slow service made me wary that my BFF and I might be hungry (and late) to see \"Wicked\" at the Orpheum Theater last night, even though this place is right around the corner.  We decided to walk by and check it out, and ended up at a cute little table for two in the bar.  Our server appeared right away, took drink orders, then had my lemon drop remade after I discovered a salty, instead of sweet, rim on my drink.  We both had delicious, fresh spinach salads with grilled chicken.  We shared a tasty Pot du Creme for dessert.  My only complaint is that the \"warm ciabatta\" they offer on request turned out to be a luke-warm roll without much flavor.\n\nThe decor was warm and upscale, the service was friendly.  The price of the meal came in a little high for what we got, but given its proximity to the theater I'm okay with that.  As we were leaving, a gentleman offered to call us a cab if we needed one.  We didn't, but it was a nice touch.", "author": "Paige L."}

We were dining pre-performance and had a hard time finding a resv, so based on Opentable reviews, we thought the restaurant sounded like a good option.  My experience at Soluna was so bad I wanted to warn other people not to waste their time. Unfortunately my review was removed from Opentable - perhaps the star rating was too low.  Some of the dishes were inedible, the service was terrible.  I couldn't eat the gluelike potatoes which were so overcooked they dripped through the fork, and I skipped the other veggie which wasn't appetizing, eating only the salmon on my plate.  Despite having very few tables it took 10-15 minutes to receive our drinks each time we placed an order.  The bathrooms were grimy - yuck.  They seated us with a view to the outdoor garbage cans - really - in an almost empty restaurant?

(Soluna advertises a complimentary dessert if you show your ticket stubs for Wicked). When we returned after the show was over, Soluna was closed so the option for dessert did not happen.

The Louis consisted of a small piece of toast adorned with a tiny ice cream scoop-size serving of what looked like hospital cafeteria tuna salad. It was a mushy mass that tasted mainly of lemon juice with no hint of the advertised crab and shrimp. The total amount of \"crab\" would have been about enough to cover a couple of Ritz Crackers. On the plus side however there were a few capers. If I hadn't been feeling weak after a recent bout with the flu, I would have sent it back for something else but I just didn't have the energy.
