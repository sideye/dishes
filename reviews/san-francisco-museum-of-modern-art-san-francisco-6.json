I easily spent close to 5 hours here. I was so thankful that they held on to my backpack as I explored the museum. Not knowing what I signed up for, falling into the foray of Magritte, I completely lost track of everything. This was a timed event and on top of that I was also part of the docent group.\n\nOne of the most intense pieces I saw while I was there was Jeff Koons' Michael Jackson and Bubbles. I have never really thought much of it until I saw it in person. It was just intense. They had a good Twombly collection which made me appreciate the Cy Twombly gallery in Houston. I was confused thinking that I was looking at Warhol and somehow the floor transitioned from Warhol to Roy Lichtenstein and I was just bitten. Then I got to be on 13th PbFe Triangle and I had a whole new level of appreciation for Carl Andre. And I learned about Sigmar Polke. \n\nIf you're in the area, a visit to SF MOMA is a must!", "author": "Zain R."}

If you've had formal training in art or not, there are always things to learn and experience in a well-developed museum with an excellent and inclusive collection of work. Not to mention, that in-person experience with an art piece doesn't compare to the experiences you've had through books or pictures online. \n\nFor me, since I do have a personal relationship to certain works of art, I found that the collection at SF MOMA contained multiple works that I was able to really appreciate spending time with. Certain areas of this museum tend to be more sparse with guests, so the experience can be enjoyable. Other sections (such as special collections) tend to be packed, and not quite as enjoyable and even stressful. However, this is a relatively typical situation for any museum.\n\nI'm huge on K-12 arts education. It's an often overlooked subject in school, and it tends to be rare for young children to even be able to step inside a museum for one reason or another. SF MOMA appears to have an incredibly well-developed student-education program for youngsters. They also host docent tours for adults, but I was more impressed by the ability of these educators to engage such young students in work that is typically inaccessible to any individual without much of a background of knowledge. It seemed like the youth-educators were museum staff or volunteers, but it is possible that they were trained K-12 teachers as well. \n\nIt was so refreshing to watch an educator explain abstract art to a group of young children. The docent seemed to be able to explain the topics in such a simplistic way, that all the students seemed engaged and were able to ask some pretty smart questions. Other groups of students were plopped down in front of a work of art on a mat with museum-approved art tools. Kiddos were encouraged to replicate their own interpretation of a piece of work. \n\nIn addition to the great collection and student programming, it was lovely to see that they kept Mathew Barney's \"Drawing Restraint 14\" still sketched on the wall after their renovation. I am a huge Barney fan, and it would have been quite the bummer to see this piece covered up.\n\nPlease note that works of art in any museum may not be the same every time you attend.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Well for me, that's the story of my life.\n\nBecause of my anxiety, I'll rarely spend money on something if I don't deem it to be absolutely worthwhile. And since it's nearly impossible to tell whether something will be \"worthwhile\" until I give it a shot, I miss out on a lot of opportunities. \n\nThe San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SF MOMA) serves as a perfect example. Since hearing about the SF MOMA many years ago, I've always wanted to check it out. However, the cost seemed too expensive and plenty of \"yah buts...\" kept preventing me from going. \n\nWell last weekend, I took a leap of faith and decided to visit the SF MOMA with my girlfriend. I can't believe I'm saying this but the museum was worth every penny I paid! I'm so glad I went because the galleries were beautiful, the space was ginormous, and best of all I actually didn't end up emptying my entire wallet!\n\nFounded in 1935, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art houses one of the world's largest collections of masterpieces made during the 1860s-late 1960s. In the museum, there are 7 giant floors filled with gorgeous, powerful artworks from geniuses such as Jeff Koons. It was a journey for my girlfriend and me to be able to conquer every inch of this museum while also learning a thing or two. \n\nTo truly describe my \"worthwhile\" adventure in a meaningful way, I have to break it into 7 parts - each one representing a floor inside the SF MOMA: \n\n-- PART 0, FLOOR 0: THE PREPARATION --\nBefore every journey comes the planning. For us, we wisely decided to BART from the East Bay. Since traffic around this area SUCKED and the closest parking lot (along Minna Street) charged $4/half hour, why not do yourself a favor and walk? It's only a few blocks from Montgomery BART. Furthermore, we had bought tickets ahead of time online to avoid waiting at the booth. Omg, admission was more affordable than I had thought - $25 for adults, $22 for seniors, and $19 for those ages 19-24. I'm 24!\n\n-- PART 1, FLOOR 1: TRANQUIL BEGINNINGS -- \nOur adventure began with the gift shop, where we spent a bit of time perusing through various items that were on sale. Unlike at most museums, this store had a bunch of neat things ranging from bike accessories to cookbooks! Before making our way to the next stage, we deposited our belongings at the check-in. NOTE: They do allow you to bring bags, but you have to wear your bag in front.\n\n-- PART 2, FLOOR 2: A PROVOCATIVE CLIMB --\nIt started with a bang, as we were faced with very creative and thought provoking pieces. Even now I can't get the image of Michael Duchamp's \"Fountain\" out of my head. \n\n-- PART 3, FLOOR 3: A LOST HISTORY --\nComing in, I had no idea how impactful the art on this floor would be. But after experiencing \"The Train - RFK's Last Journey\" firsthand, I understood. The masterpieces here depicted people's experiences while witnessing the funeral train of Robert F. Kennedy - yep, the actual blood brother of JFK.\n\n-- PART 4, FLOOR 4: A MUDDY MUSE --\nAfter realizing that RFK was murdered just two months after the death of MLK, I left the third floor with a sinking feeling in my stomach. Yet, that pain turned into inspiration when we gazed intently at Robert Rauschenberg's \"Mud Muse.\" If mud could be considered art, I can do anything!\n\n-- PART 5, FLOOR 5: THE CHILLING CLIMAX -- \nMost adventures have an obstacle. For me, it was overcoming my fear of heights and spiders. First we mustered enough strength to cross the Oculus Bridge, a porous pathway on which one could see into hell. Then, we raced through Louise Bourgeois' \"Spiders\", a creepy exhibit filled with \"artistic\" spiders.  \n\n-- PART 6, FLOOR 6: A STUMBLE TO THE END --\nHaving spent most of our energy braving the challenges of floor 5, my girlfriend and I were exhausted. How much was left? We wanted to turn back, but we knew the finish line was near. What kept us motivated was the \"Designed in California\" gallery, a room filled with cool tech such as the first Apple computer.\n\n-- PART 7, FLOOR 7: UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN --\nAt last, we made it to the top! Our effort was well-rewarded, since this floor had an incredible view, a theater room with THREE SEPARATE SCREENS, an archaic printer that continually spat out present-day news, and a FREE POSTER! Capping off a happy ending, we enjoyed a nice elevator-ride back down to the first floor. \n\nAll in all, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art was definitely one heck of an activity that I'm so thankful to have experienced. I can ramble on about the SF MOMA but the Yelp gods will cut me off - and I haven't even begun to describe how aesthetically pleasing the interior of the museum was. For now, I'll just say that the SF MOMA was worthy of an \"Omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating. Please check it out if you can!\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

It is very much possible that I just don't understand modern art but a certain feeling of hypocrisy was gripping me for most of my visit.

In a city so forcefully impacted by poverty, homelessness, and income divides, his artwork takes up a massive amount of room inside a huge building in the middle of downtown. I can't help but think that this space could be better used to make spaces for those who have so little so that they don't have to spend their nights out on the streets. I have a huge appreciation for artists - especially those who attempt to bring attention to those who are less fortunate - but I really believe that this is completely the opposite of what Rauschenberg would have wanted for this exhibit.\n\nSomeone did bring up to me that this could be the exhibit working exactly as hoped since I was honestly disgusted with the situation and thinking much more critically about the injustices of society... but I have a hard time believing that. I'll be doing more research on the exhibit, as well as the artist, but for the time being, I think I'll stick to appreciating the beauty of nature and history.", "author": "Simon L."}

The new Fisher galleries, from the founders of Gap, feature many compelling and relatable works from artists such as Diebenkorn, Calder, Lichtenstein, Kelly, Richter, Warhol, de Kooning, and more.\n\nThe architecture itself is also noteworthy, whether the original building and its prominent, circular, angled atrium, or the new building that's simultaneously edgy and curvy. \n\nTickets are timed here, so it's best to reserve ahead of time online. They might be a bit spendy, but this is a museum well worth supporting. Plan to set aside at least half a day for exploring everything on offer here.", "author": "Vincent L."}

And no I'm not certain that it's worth it. There are a couple ways to get free or discounted admission, but it's a little hard to come by (google is your friend). But if you can afford it, do come. This is one of the largest museums in SF, and it really holds an amazing assortment of pieces. \n\nIf you do make it in, I would HIGHLY recommend going up to the 7th floor where they house their larger scale exhibits. \n\nAlso, if they have them while you visit, the little activity corners are great for all ages. \n\nOverall, I come here pretty often, and honestly I love the SF MOMA.", "author": "Sophie W."}

Unless I'm traveling for an exhibit, that's a whole other story. I have been known to travel to Seattle and LA for specific shows. \n\nThis time I was traveling to SF for a concert. I did do some research on museums and noticed that SFMOMA had only one of my favorites, Louise Bourgeois presenting her iconic Spiders!! I find these larger than life spider sculptures absolutely irresistible. There was no way I was going to miss these and I didn't. \n\nAfter a long day of hitting up my must see to do list. I made it to the museum. I'm so happy it was during the work week and I was able to enjoy the art without too many people.\n\nI didn't go straight to spiders. I enjoyed the Frida Kahlo piece, the Marches Duchamp \"R.Mutt urinal\", the photographs from Walker Evans, the gigantic Lichtenstein and Warhol pieces. And the finally the cherry on top was the spiders. They were breathtaking as usual! They were laid out in the unusual manner, crawling on walls and scattered around. I was more than happy. \n\nThis museum is a definite must visit while in San Francisco! I will be making sure to continue to pay a visit in every visit. \n\nThe staff was helpful and knowledgeable, especially Erin.

Thankfully, this past November, I had the opportunity/chance to visit the museum with my family.\n\nThe museum was just mesmerizing honestly.  One could spend several hours, or perhaps all day, exploring the exhibitions, paintings, sculptures, and open spaces of the MOMA.  However, with that being said, as with all my other museum reviews, I will try to keep this simple and short.  I'll briefly mention a few highlights of my visit:\n\n1.  The entrance/atrium on the first floor is enormous and provides the visitor of an idea of the enormity of the vast space they are about to walk through.\n\n2.  Robert Serra's \"Sequence\", or the MAZE as my brother and sister-in-law call it, is a massive sculpture in the Roberts Family Gallery.  And a word of advice to future visitors:  there are various signs advising \"no touching\" as though the sculpture make look sturdy, it is far from it.  Please be careful.  Needless to say, it was fun to wander thru the curves and passages of \"Sequence\".\n\n3.  Louise Bourgeois' spiders.  Various spiders of shapes and sizes are spread across the fifth floor exhibition area.  According to the museum website, the artist viewed these creatures as fierce and fragile, seemingly doubling as both protector and predator.  Although some look menacing, other spiders just looked peaceful or just needing to be left alone.  And others were so tall that one could stand beneath them (though one really shouldn't as there are museum attendants present).\n\n4.  Bill Fontana sonic shadows.  Exhibition utilizing the fifth floor oculus bridge, transforming the sounds of footsteps into acoustics blending with recording of other real-time sounds.  To be brutally honest, I mainly wanted to step across the bridge and didn't really notice the sounds or blending of sounds.  The view is scenic from the pedestrian bridge though, a cool vantage point.\n\n5.  Photography exhibit by Walker Evans.  Two sections spanning areas of the third floor.  Though I was not familiar with the works/photos of Mr. Evans, I truly admired his candid photos from the depression.  The photos allow visitors to view the disparity facing the American population at that point in history.  And for some reason, unbeknownst to me, I felt captivated by the many photos of various storefronts, and the many candids of people on NYC subway and \"people watching\" around NYC.\n\n6.  \"The Visitors\" by Ragnar Kjartansson.  Amazing, amazing musical interactive exhibition.  This was incredible!!  Make sure to visit the seventh floor!\n\n7.  The sculpture garden and terrace areas were lovely spaces were one could take a break from the inside crowds.  Just an fyi, the sculpture garden on the fifth floor is much larger than that on the third floor, plus its located adjacent to the Cafe 5 restaurant.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nA very memorable and mesmerizing visit at the SF MOMA.  People of all ages will truly enjoy all the exhibits, art, and sculptures at this museum.", "author": "Michael C."}

If that doesn't satisfy your cultural urges, there are sculptures and pop art galore, as well as a collection of mid-century activist paraphernalia that's nothing if not a fitting tribute to San Francisco's counterculture heritage.\n\nAre certain exhibits more immersive than others? Certainly. As many reviewers have noted, \"The Visitors\" by Ragnar Kjartansson steals the show on the seventh floor, and the sense of post-WWII dread is palpable in Anselm Kiefer's large scale masterpieces, which dominate the exhibit on German art.\n\nEven the building itself, all modern lines and progressive architecture, serves as its own form of art, although some of the outdoor sculpture areas were regrettably closed during my visit.

I was drawn in by the music and once inside, the immersive nature and overwhelming sadness buoyed by hope in the melody led to be crying uncontrollably.

SF MOMA brings various of visitors near and far to explore their collections of greatest artworks and sculptures from the past to the present every 365 days a year! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most modern arts museums has across the world (i.e. Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, CA), and as for the SF MOMA, it's pretty spacious and humongously wide covering 7 stories (aka. floors) tall in a huge, big rectangular building!\n\nThe employees here are doing a great job for accommodating the customers like me a tremendous and well received service! No cons.\n\nNow onto the experience! Since I purchased a GA entry for $25 per person inside, I explored the floors entirely from various of artists and creators. I really loved how this museum has some good collections of Andy Warhol's pop art paintings from Elvis Presley to Marilyn Monroe as well as his self-portrait painting back in 1986 too. Additionally, the Rebecca Horn's \"Seufzer der Steine (Translation: \"The Sights of Stones)\" was extraordinarily by playing the violins eerie and wicked right directly in a mechanical turning machine. Gorgeous. The Hans Haacke's \"News\" is simply spellbounding to me by printing various of latest news articles from local to the world using the late 1980s style printer. I did read some articles after it was printed originally, and these latest recent events can be dramatic or sometimes, it can be fun to read! Cool concept for that display! Finally, in the sculpture area, both Dan Flavin and Sol LeWitts masterpieces are breathtaking! Dan's two illuminating lights display are lit up wonderfully by showcasing the displays on modern artwork of fluorescent lights and Sol's \"Wall Grid\" is simply not that bad showing every cubes on different formats of openings and bendable angles. Yes, I did spent around 3 hours inside the museum entirely, and it was an unbelievable visit covering every aspects in the building. An experience it remember!\n\nTaking a break is an easy thing to do cause they have a coffee shop on the 3rd floor as well as the rooftop outdoor and indoor dining area too located at the next few floors upwards. On every Thursday, they have good amounts of nightlife events as well as various of artwork and displays special exhibitions too every two or three months of the year. Finally, there's a museum store inside the museum where you can shop endless of artwork related materials, books, and accessories.\n\nParking at SF MOMA can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nBottom line, the SF MOMA is the most incredible and outstanding modern arts museum that I've ever visited for the very first time!

There is a great bank of elevators that you can use to jet up & down between the levels.  We just wanted the work out, and sometimes it seemed pretty rediculous to use the elevator to just go up or down one level.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, airy and very very well lighted.

I've been to other Modern Art Museums, and this one unfortunately falls near the bottom.\n\nI would also not recommend purchasing tickets ahead of time online - if your flight gets cancelled and you need to adjust the date it is a bit of a headache with them. I would say wait until you are in person to get the tickets and if you can't get tickets it's not a huge loss.", "author": "Mary P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-25", "description": "I LOVE this place! So much so, I decided to get the annual membership. Let me start from the beginning. \n\nMy friend saw some pictures on Instagram, and said \"let's go\" to me. And me, always up for an adventure said \"sure. Let's go thursday because they're open late on Thursday.\" Best decision EVER. I've been hesitant to come up until now because I've always heard that it was super busy during the weekends, and I work during the regular work week. So the fact that they are open on a Thursday until 9 pm, just because (and not a special event night to draw bigger crowds), is a big plus. So if you ever want to go through a museum without the large crowds, Thursday night is your night. And its a nice way to break up your work week. \n\nIf you can do it, take the stairs. It's part of the experience having the artwork reveal itself as you walk up to it. It's like having the curtains drawn at the theater. \n\nAlso, don't touch any of the art. Some pieces are more inviting for a touch, but don't touch, the staff and security gets very angry (they scolded another patron). This also includes the sculpture bases. It may look like an anchor for the artwork, but its also part of the art. Also, don't get so close that you breathe on the art (eww). Only touch and breathe on what has a clear sign that you can touch. Keep an eye out for them, or ask if you can beforehand. There are several pieces that they invite touching. \n\nMy friends and I walked up the first two floors, but decided to skip to the top floor and make our way down. There are eight floors of artwork to go through. I appreciate that there are outdoor balconies on every level so you can get some fresh air in between the exhibits/floors to avoid information overload. And there are a lot of pieces to go through. \n\nI really love sculpture pieces because of what the artist may or maynot name the piece. and the detail that they show in their work. And they're pretty amazing for instragrammable moments. \n\nWhen I look at paintings and photographs, I like to look at it up close, and from far away, and at different angles. The galleries here give me the space to do this. \n\nCost: It's $25 for an adult for every visit. But they let you apply up to two general admission tickets to be applied to an annual membership. So I grabbed my friend's ticket, and applied it to my annual membership. I got the lowest tier at $100 for me and a guest, for as many times as I can come in a year. So as long as I come back two more times in the next year, I'll have come out ahead, not just financially, but also culturally. \n\nPro-tip: if you're not sure you're going to like this place, get the general admission ticket for $25, and make your decision about the annual membership at the end of your trip. \n\nPro-tip: Don't look at the art and say, I know a 5 year old can do better. It's ok to say you don't understand that artist's intention, and you won't always understand or know what the intention was. Also, look at the painting from several angles, and depths. Or you can make up a story about what you think was going through that artist's mind too.", "author": "Vicky L."}

The artists represented here in this museum boggle the mind: Warhol, De Kooning, Lichtenstein, Matisse, Richter, Calder, Klee, Miro, Picasso, Rothko, Dali, Duchamp... the list goes on and on. I was excited to hear that Edvard Munch's works were on display for their special exhibit (Sans The Scream). Special exhibits will be an extra charge and will have to be scheduled for a certain time but you can browse through the general admission section of the museum at any time. You can reserve your time in person or online.\n\nI was only really familiar with Munch's The Scream so it was fascinating to see the progression of his painting style from early to later days. I was also surprised to see that The Scream is actually one of his earlier pieces since it was one of his most famous paintings. \n\nFor some of the most well known artists they only have one or two of their pieces for exhibit but I do like the variety of styles this museum represents. I could have spent hours examining each piece in person. We went to 6 of the 7 floors and focused mainly on the artists I was familiar with and spent 2-3 hours but if you really want to look at each piece available it can easily be a half day to a full day of soaking in so much talent in one building.\n\nI had a great time and would love to go back next time I'm in San Francisco.", "author": "Karen W."}

However, there are 6 floors full of art pieces that are thought provoking and beautiful. A true art lover or even an amateur one will be awed by how much there is to see.\n\nTwo tips I read on yelp were to buy the tickets online to skip the line and to start on the 7th floor and work your way down to avoid getting tired from the gruesome stairs.

Personally, I liked the overall structure and presentation abilities at that facility better. There was something very grand about that building. It's still there, it's just used for something else. But, the great art exhibits have continued since it has moved to this newer location.  \n\nThere are a few things to take into consideration before you come to see an exhibit here. What is perhaps the  main problem, which is very commonly the case all over  San Francisco, is that parking can be a bit of a problem. Yes, they have some lots and some street parking around the area, but it is not easy. And, let me spell easy with a E. :-) \n\nThis being said, there are very few museums in Northern California or all of the Western United States for that matter that come anywhere close to the grand level of ever-changing and ongoing art exhibits that the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presents. Thus, it is one of the must see art museums in California.", "author": "Scott S."}

Open daily til 5 pm (closed Wednesdays), Thursdays til 9 pm. Adults $25 - Youths 18 and under are ALWAYS free.  \n\nThe iconic, wavy design/build was created by Norwegian architectural firm Sn\u00f8hetta, known for its art spaces. Now featuring nearly 3x the art display space, the new SFMOMA replaced the previous museum building, which stood a scant 28 years before falling to the wrecking ball. Art buffs may remember the original SFMOMA, which opened on Van Ness Ave. in 1935 as the first modern art museum on the west coast.\n\nVisitors may pre-select their arrival times online. Yes, admission is steep at $25 - but movie tickets for two are approaching $30+ and Imax is $40, attending an NBA game will set you back $200+ and golf for two at Spyglass is $400+. And, how much did you pay for those sunglasses ya lost after wearing 'em a month? C'mon! And kids are always free!\n\nParking is available a the adjacent garage or try your Best Parking app for nearby parking availability.  For your best experience, shoot for weekday visits; allow 3 hours so you may casually explore the ten floors of works.\n\nWe arrived 30 minutes before our scheduled time and were surprised to find the entry process easy and well organized. The museum offers self guided, interactive tours which allow you to go at your own pace and wander freely.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 is one of the best we've seen in a public venue. We were delighted, and surprised, to be offered free refills of our capuccinos - who does that?  On another note, my daughter spotted \"Where's Waldo?\" on the SF skyline while strolling the caf\u00e9 patio. Can you find him?\n\nNotably, SFMOMA offered a free admission night in December '16, following the tragic Oakland rave warehouse fire. Class move.\n\nFrom March 11 - May 29, 2017, California artist Richard Diebenkorn will be featured alongside iconic Henri Matisse works.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-19", "description": "I want to give a higher review for this place - it's such a revered and gargantuan SF institution, after all. But 3 stars is all I can muster. Like most museums, it's just meh. Or blah. It's just not all that cool or interesting. 7 floors open to the public, and they still can't manage to put anything that good in there. It seems a little dated, and most of the art seems more appropriate for a small regional museum with a much lower admission fee. For while, the new SFMOMA was $30, but it looks like it's recently been lowered to $25. Better, but still steep for such an average place. At least it's lower than the Academy of Science's whopping $40 entrance fee - as of now, when I just checked their site. Now that's really not worth it. SF museum admission fees have been going through the roof these days - reflecting the ridiculously overpriced cost of living in this city. \n\nMuseums these days seem heavy on the airiness and feel, and less focused on actual art, or science, or whatever the museum is about. That's the same with Cal Academy, too - so much less science-oriented than the old museum. \n\nThe least unmemorable part of the museum for me were actually those protest posters on Floor 3. I was showing an out-of-town friend everything about those angry marches, tenant rallies, strikes, and Black Panther stuff. He wasn't familiar with this SF/Berkeley brand of angry, overwrought activism, so that's why talking about those posters stood out in my mind. I remember seeing a similar collection of angry protest posters at that Berkeley museum - the BAMFPA, which no one knows about, for good reason. \n\nThere's a trendy Sightglass coffee bar smack in the middle of one of the  levels. It's odd the cafe is just right there, in the middle of the floor, instead of having an obvious separation, like a separate room. The cafe has a similar feel to the previous SFMOMA cafe - a little dated, smacking of the late 2000s, upscale but edgy and chic. This is what it says on the SFMOMA site: \"The coffee bar is located adjacent to the Photography Interpretive Gallery, combining coffee with contemplation.\" Pretentious, like everything related to SFMOMA and modern art museums. \n\nOn one of the higher levels, there was a couple of wooden \"man\" sculptures, maybe like a very tame version of Burning Man. Those bland sculptures reflect everything else about the museum - just boring and uninteresting, nothing new or fresh. Maybe Calder is a big name in sculptures, but I find his abstract mobile-like \"sculptures\" unbearably unappealing. \n\nThere's some fairly lame spidery sculptures on a top floor, with that little bridge with the slot floor than lets you look down into the abyss below. It's not that interesting - we remember something very similar from the old SFMOMA. \n\nI don't know if it's just me, but it seems the beauty and passion of the old SFMOMA is missing from the new one. Same with the old and new Academy of Sciences. I remember some of the art so fondly at the old SFMOMA - the Wayne Thiebaud, Diebenkorn, Eva Hesse, Michael Jackson & Bubbles, Ellsworth Kelly, and Roy De Forest. But this new SFMOMA, even probably with some of the same art - just seems so underwhelming.", "author": "Valle H."}

One of the curators at the front told me to start from the 7th floor and work my way down and that was really good advice.\n\nIt's my first time coming to such a museum and I didn't really have any expectations. The abstract and minimalist exhibits really hit me. I've usually heard people bash on these saying, \"oh I can do that, it's so easy.\" Well, seeing it in person and seeing how big some of these pieces are you really just get lost in them and see it for what it is. The ability of the artist to translate and evoke emotion, translating it onto a canvas through brush strokes, colors, and light is a humbling experience. \n\nThe Sublime Seas exhibit where they have three screens simultaneously playing videos and sound was a real trip, in a good way. It made me feel small and insignificant in the world of wonder and beauty. It does send also a powerful message as well, but I don't want to spoil that here. I highly recommend seeing it. \n\nTickets are not cheap $25 for adults, but who would not want to support a musuem like this? There is a parking structure in which part of the money paid goes to supporting MoMA. It's off of 3rd and Minna, literally at the side of the museum. Maybe hard to squeeze your way into this side street if you're not familiar with the city as the bus/taxi only lane may throw you off. Google map and street view it in prep for finding this parking garage. \n\nThey are very strict about beverages including water bottles of any kind in any of the exhibits. If you're holding a bag they prefer you keep it in front of you so you don't accidentally back it up to something. Some exhbitis you can interact with and some are only allowed to be 18 inches away only.  So read the signs, and when in doubt ask. \n\nDate spot? Yes definitely! Would I go back?

As a young adult under 24, the ticket was only $19! They give you a hardcopy ticket and once you get it scanned, the ticket actually turns into a sticker that you have to wear around the place.

It's only a small portion of the floor but I enjoyed how the artist made maps based on various photos he took of the area. \n\n- Cloud Cities Exhibit - I think this is one of the newer ones, but it was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-26", "description": "GREAT ARTISTS ARE HISTORIANS\n\nSeveral years ago I majored in art history at UC Berkeley. My emphasis was on mainly on French Impressionism. When I was a junior in college I enrolled in an art history course - American contemporary art from the 1960s and onwards. One of the assignments of that class was writing a 10-page paper a single piece of painting at the old SF MOMA. I don't recall the name of the painter however I remember the name of the painting \"White\". That painting had different variations of white with visible brushstrokes. Just imaging writing a 10-page paper on this painting? Yeah it was that difficult especially since I'm not a fan of contemporary art. There was something intriguing about SF MOMA when I was at college. However when I went to the old SF MOMA I felt the layout of museum was dated and unorganized as some of the galleries didn't highlight the exhibition or artwork. Maybe that was why I did like contemporary art. The last time I went to the SF MOMA before it was renovated was in 2007 to see the exhibition \"Pablo Picasso in American Art\". This was best modern art exhibition I have ever seen because it not only showed Picasso's art but also other American artists that he had influence on.\n\nWhen the SF MOMA opened after its renovation I wanted to go here especially since the museum is about less than a 10-minute walk from my work. I admit when it comes to visiting a museum it is due to the exhibition. During the Memorial Day Weekend there were two exhibitions that were on the day after Memorial Day - \"Monet: The Early Years\" at the Legion of Honor and \"Matisse/ Diebenkorn\" at the SF MOMA. Claude Monet is my favorite painter of all time. I do believe in order expand my repertoire of art appreciation I needed to go to the SF MOMA for that exhibition. Before I decided to go I did some research. I heard about Henri Matisse but not Richard Diebenkorn. I discovered he graduated from Stanford in 1949. That is the reason why I decided to go to the exhibition because as a novice art historian who graduated from Cal I wanted to see works from an artist who graduated from Stanford. I was very glad that I decided to go to the SF MOMA that weekend. From looking at the Diekenborn's paintings you progressions from throughout the works. Even though he graduated from Stanford you see his paintings from his Berkeley series how he interprets the layout of the city. What I liked about this exhibition is you see a painting from Matisse side by side of a painting from Diebenkorn. Even though the paintings are not exact you see how Diebenkorn referred to Matisse when it came to shades of color. The similarities of the paintings would involve the same subject matter however each artist interpreted differently the subject matter such as Henri Matisse's \"Woman with a Hat\", a painting of Matisse's wife, or Diebenkorn's painting of his wife. Going to the SF MOMA for this exhibition challenged me and I was glad for it.\n\nWorking in the Financial District in SF I would pass by the Academy of Art and sometimes noticed some of the artworks. I felt these students would try to become like Picasso with his cubist style. Well to understand how Picasso became Picasso you have to understand what was his influences. If artists who aspire to become Picasso then have to study Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, who Picasso studied a lot from to incorporate his works. For aspiring artists the SF MOMA is a great access as it is downtown SF and is close to Bart. In the future if there are other exhibitions like \"Pablo Picasso in American Art\" or \"Matisse/ Diebenkorn\" I say it is a prerequisite for aspiring artists who want to progress because history is influential in art.", "author": "Gerald R."}

The admission is pretty steep at $25 per person and there wasn't any discounts online that we found either :(\n\nHowever we still really enjoyed the entire museum! There's 7 floors so we started on the top! We took our time with each floor and it was so awesome ! My favorite was the exhibit on the 6th floor with these black wire & mirror pieces. \n\nEven though we're not very museum people, the bf & I really enjoyed all of the exhibits and we were entertained for hours here !! There's also a cute cafe on the third floor which had delicious coffee & cookies if you want to stop by. They also had the \"motion lab\" on the same floor which was cool to check out.\n\nDefinitely something to do at least once while in SF!!", "author": "Isabel L."}

Just to make sure we were paying attention, they painted the restroom on the first floor a very bright orange! \n\nThe Munch exhibit was terrific (but don't come looking for \"The Scream\") but don't expect it to be uplifting.

When I first walked in, I recognized the high ceiling and the multi-level layout. But then looking around, I noticed a lot of empty space in the foyer. There was plenty of room to display more art on the first floor.\n\nWe were going to bypass the long line for the elevator and take the stairs, but then we noticed those were for exit only. The line for the elevator was also where they scan your ticket. Once we had our tickets scanned, they let us make a beeline for the stairs.\n\nThis museum runs the gamut of modern art. Photographs, paintings, sculptures, media. There is something for everyone, but I am sure you will find things you do not like and/or do not consider art. \n\nI especially liked the works by Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Henri Matisse, as well as the Ansel Adams photos. The Nigel Calder sculptures were cool, especially when a breeze permeated the room. I was amused by Mike Mandel's baseball cards. If they were for sale at the gift shop, I would have bought some. \n\nThe special exhibition features works by Edvard Munch, famous for The Scream. Admission is timed here, and yes, they are scrutinizing your ticket time.\n\nMy only complaint was that so many areas in the museum were closed to set up their next exhibition.

It felt very intimate. Even though each musician was recorded on video, it felt like we were standing on the stage of a live concert. The music itself was very moody but felt comforting.\n\nMy second favorite exhibition was a statue of wire segments pieced together in a shape of a human. It was something that you would see at Burning Man! I had lots of fun taking photos with it. \n\nMy third favorite exhibition was a reddish-brown installation that reminded me of Antelope Canyon.

However, after my first visit in June with my friend (when we had a time crunch of 1.5 hours to zip through the museum before closing- it was obvious a membership was necessary for me to come back and enjoy the art). And indeed, I did come back several more times already to wander with various friends to admire all the modern art starting from Level 7 all the way to the ground floor.  I'm not going to spoil each floor for you, but I've always enjoyed Floor 7 and most recently, Tom\u00e1s Saraceno's \"Stillness in Motion -- Cloud Cities\". \n\nSince it is fairly popular, I recommend coming on a weekday with a pair of comfy sneakers. I made the mistake of coming on a rainy weekend and it was super crowded. Also, depending on fast you walk, it will take approximately 2.5-3 hours to look at the entire museum. If you are a SF- Bay Area resident, I recommend buying a membership so you can come back and enjoy the museum in small chunks and go back to exhibits you might have missed the first time around.

The exhibits contain a nice mix of canvas work, sculpture, photography, and displays in alternative media. We were lucky to see a special exhibition when we were there called sound waves which, like you'd expect, was an exhibition on art involving sounds. My favorite was one room where they had videos of people playing instruments by themselves, but the music each person was playing worked in concert with what the other people were playing. It was really beautiful and such a cool idea! And of course they have a nice selection of pieces by Pollack, Lichtenstein, and other big names in modern art as well which are really fun to see. We approached our day by taking the elevator to the top floor and then working our way down by taking the stairs.

I don't know if they were trying to compensate for the cold outside, but it was horrible. The lines to get tickets, even in the membership line, were also long and slow. \n\nA couple of the exhibits themselves were interesting, but I thought it was lame that they are rotating political posters in phases (please, come spend more money so you can see the other ones!). Most of the exhibits were just OK, and none were really interactive. Needless to say, this is NOT a kid-friendly museum. \n\nFinally,  the cafe was absurdly overpriced.

Y'see, I'm just not deep a person. In fact, I kept wondering why they felt a need to expand a perfectly respectable museum within a very constrained space around the W Hotel. However, when Jamie W. bought memberships for us, we got to have a preview look last weekend. I was startled at how impressive the results of the renovation are.\n\nIt felt like this was the original intention all along, 170,000 square feet of exhibition space that seamlessly weds Mario Botta's original  brick-laden building with the white Nordic crinkles of the Norwegian design firm Snohetta (photo: http://bit.ly/228JSuO). Another entrance has been built on Howard Street where you start on the second floor with a sweeping view of Richard Serra's massively elliptical sculpture, \"Sequence\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1sngZz9). We started on the seventh floor where multi-media artworks are on display (photo: http://bit.ly/23QET18). There's a narrow sculpture balcony that overlooks much of SoMa (photo: http://bit.ly/1Xav6D5).\n\nWalking down to the sixth floor, we saw a lot of graphic design and contemporary German art. The familiar starts to show up on the fifth floor where Roy Lichtenstein's pop-comic art is given its space as well as Andy Warhol's \"Triple Elvis\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1Or4goq) and \"Double Dolly\" (photo: http://bit.ly/1snhkSl). You can now walk over a bridge to Cafe 5 where the Blue Bottle Cafe used to be, and the sculpture patio has thankfully been left intact (photo: http://bit.ly/1TdwTlY). The fourth floor focuses on abstract works and pieces from less familiar artists, while the Alexander Calder mobiles show up on the third floor.\n\nThere's also an adjacent outdoor space featuring a living wall and a lot more sculptures (photo: http://bit.ly/1Otuf9F), as well as a Sightglass coffee area to rest your feet from all that stair climbing (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZRe0cu). The second floor is where they made the restrooms a vivid red  and placed many of the modern paintings I've missed for the past three years. Yes, I know you think I'm an art ignoramus, but yes, I remembered those pieces fondly like...uhhh...ummm.

I have been to many museums, and this one is now a monster with galleries on seven floors taking up a large section of the block. Several of the new galleries have some really avant garde art including multimedia experiences that really stretch the viewers mind and views of art. With such a large collection and travelling exhibits, it is hard to describe the installations since they may change when you read this review.\n\nThe museum itself was designed as art. The old entrance now takes you directly upstairs for ticketing and the main entrance. Electronic ticketing is available and recommended. A lot of people head to the elevators to go up to the top and slowly work down, but I kept bumping into people working their way up, so there is no official plan. The museum is now just too big to attempt in one session, so I recommend planning several visits to fully explore the collections.\n\nNestled amongst the exhibits are several food and drink options including a caf\u00e9 and coffee bar. There are also several patios and a great vertical garden continuing the experience in good weather. Expect the place to be crowded for some time as locals and tourists rediscover the exhibits.\n\nAdmission is pretty pricy making an annual membership potentially the better bargain. Crowds will be a fixture for a while, but people watching is part of the fun! Who knows, maybe you can meet that special someone looking at the same painted urinal?", "author": "Kristian D."}

While I will miss the charm of the classic SFMoma it's still there and I can come visit that side often enough. The new side of SFMoma offers visitors more gallery space and contemporary design. It's breathtaking. It really fresh, its totally worth the price of admission to go check it out. \n\nSan Francisco is fortunate to have such a wonderful space for modern art. \nThe new entrance and design seem to fit seamlessly into the surrounding neighborhood, as I pass bye I feel like I could be in any world class gallery in any other major city in the world.

We showed up around 11:15 am and their first available slot for entrance was anytime after 12:45 pm which was great because we would have time to eat at Vitrine next door and then pop on over.  \n\nThe place was crowded when we entered.  There's a total of 7 floors with each floor having a theme. We started on the 7th floor which was the \"The Campaign for Art\" exhibition and featured modern and contemporary art. It was very crowded on this floor on the day we went but overall had some cool art pieces. \n\nAfter this, we trekked on to the the German After 1960 floor and it was one of my fave exhibits.  This floor was very calming.  I loved the piece by Gerhard Richter which is a beautiful picture of the ocean.   Taken from SFMOMA's website, this exhibit is \"German artists emerging after 1960 explored the postwar landscape--situated between recent disaster and emerging prosperity--with a combination of skepticism, uncertainty, and excitement to begin anew. Drawn from the Doris and Donald Fisher Collection, this exhibition features single-artist galleries devoted to leading German artists such as Georg Baselitz, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Anselm Kiefer, Sigmar Polke, and Gerhard Richter.\" \n\nAnother fave of mine was the California and the West exhibit. I was raised in San Francisco so I loved all the pics of CA and the many different pieces in this exhibit.  My friends loved this exhibit as well.  \n\nWe checked out the cafe but the line was out the door so we didn't get to try anything. \nWe spent about an hour and a half at the museum before running over to our appointment at Remede spa next door so we didn't have time to check out the entire museum.

With that said, my friends and I had a blast interpreting the pieces. It took us about 4.5 hours to walk through all floors, at a leisurely pace with several breaks in-between. My favorite was the California exhibit, as they showcased vintage photographs of San Francisco. It was also interesting that every floor's restroom was painted a different color. This is a great place to easily gain 10,000 steps for those of you attached to your Fitbits/activity trackers! :p\n\nI advise purchasing tickets online ahead of time. You don't get to line up at the elevators until your allotted time. Therefore, it's not too necessary to arrive 30 minutes beforehand unless you wanted to do coat check, and even then the lines shouldn't be too terrible. Definitely choose an earlier time slot. The place got horribly crowded between 1pm and 4pm while we were there on a Saturday. Take public transportation as SF MOMA is only a short walk away from Bart or Muni.

It's about the employees who work there. I was at an interactive exhibit and I saw a child wearing and holding headphones near the exhibit like everyone else. She wasn't getting to close or anything and she kept holding the headphones to her head because she was afraid to drop them. She looked about 3 or 4. One of the employees came over and grabbed her by her arm and yanked her away from the exhibit. First of all, you do not grab someone's child like that and second you don't yank them so hard, enough to break her arm. Anyway, the kid wasn't standing so close to the structure (even in comparison to the adults) and she was holding her headphone cautiously. So, what happened was that the parents came over. And tried to explain to them that their child wasn't doing anything, which since I saw the whole thing, is the truth. The man first said she was standing too close, which more people came by and stood closer and touched the exhibit in front of him as he was shouting at the parents. Then he looked at the people around him staring, and he shouted at the kid that she was going to break the headphones, which was impossible because she didn't really walk and had too hands holding onto them trying hard not to drop them. Plus, the parents were standing close, watching her movements. First you hurt a child, then you lie. I'm incredibly disappointed! I DO NOT WANT MY MONEY TO GO TOWARDS THIS KIND OF PERSONNEL! Later in the museum, I was looking for a restroom and was separated from my partner who had the map, and. So I asked someone. She rolled her eyes and told. Me to just look at my map. Seriously? If I had a map I would have looked at it instead of asking you. Conclusion? She didn't answer me and ignored my question and walked away. Oh! That is NOT the end of it! There was a high-schooler (not confident of age) holding a DSLR and walking past an exhibit. So, usually people meander slowly in front of the painting at a snail's pace, but she wasn't walking very fast, it was around a slower than normal pace, but definitely looking for someone. And the personnel didn't just say \"hey, slow down.\" No, instead he grabbed the strap of her camera, and it almost fell to the ground. Really? What was she doing wrong? There wasn't even an interactive exhibit to run into in the area. Just because you work at MOMA doesn't mean you have to be so pompous! Did I mention? During an exhibit, there was a pair of two employees pointing around at random visitors who walked by commenting on how they look and gossiping about how bad they look. Yes, I noticed. Remember me?

Word to the wise, make sure you allocate a full day at the MOMA because there is A LOT of art to be seen! Upon entrance, the greeting staff had recommended starting on the top floor and working our way down. So we took the silver elevators all the way to the Floor 7 and began our art viewing. \n\nAs no art expert, I found the whole experience still very enjoyable. We spent probably 2 hours on the first three floors before taking a break at the appropriately named indoor/outdoor Cafe 5 on Floor 5. Here, you can get unlimited spa water or order anywhere from lunch to small desserts, coffee, lemonade, wine and more! \n\nSome of our favorite pieces were Charles Ray's sleeping woman, typeface to interface exhibit on Floor 6 (which I believe is a temporary exhibit and perfect for all who are interested in digital/graphic design and computers and stuff), Gerard Richter's photo paintings, the chair exhibit, and the lush living wall. By the end of the day, about 4 hours after we had entered, we got a little tired so we called it quits without some of seeing some of the galleries on Floors 2 and 3 - an excuse to return! \n\nPro-tip: be sure to come early and wear comfortable shoes because there will be lots of walking!", "author": "Sarah N."}

Had to pay even more to see the Edvard Munch exhibit. $87 for 2 adults & 1 student. Just to get in the door.  Gift shop was really just a book store with some overpriced jewelry thrown in. Yawn. The best part of our day was a tip we received from one of the employees. He told us the bathrooms are all painted a different color on every floor. So of course, we had to visit every bathroom & take a pic. That was super fun. The 7th floor sound exhibit was incredible. By far, the best exhibits in the museum. Fun, interactive, thought provoking. It's a nice museum, but the museums in So Cal are much better. (Getty, Getty Villa, Norton Simon, etc...)", "author": "ZenMama C."}

Not gonna lie, I was pretty tired by the end of our visit. Plan to stay more than an hour. My favorite were the Roy Lichtenstein pieces and the one sculpture of the cop that I hadn't even noticed was a sculpture at first. I noticed there were a few stuff I saw at The Broad here too. There's just so much in there you have to find something you like.\n\nI like that the museum incorporated outdoor areas - Living wall terrace (wall of plants), area outside on the top floor with a nice skyline (look for the painted Waldos! Yes, there's more than one hehe), and the cafe/restaurant. There's also a cafe inside too on one of the floors. \n\nMy friend also mentioned that with purchase of membership you can take friends in for free.

It's conveniently located within walking distance of Union Square and rivals even the NY MOMA, in my opinion. We specifically visited the Matisse/Diebenkorn exhibit, which was at the museum between March through May 2017.  I'd seen Matisse pieces previously, but it was nice to see the work of Diebenkorn, who was a 20th century artist and whose works were heavily influenced by Matisse.  Though Matisse's works were distinguishable (and, in my opinion, more appealing), I thought the exhibit was artfully and thoughtfully done and we enjoyed it.  We also enjoyed viewing Matisse's works in the permanent collection, as well as the works of Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe, James Rosenquist, Rihard Tuttle, Adaline Kent, etc.  They have an impressive permanent collection and very interesting visiting exhibits.

This is where my boyfriend and I went on our third date and where my heart began to feel a flutter for him.  \n\nIt began with a piece located outside on the second floor that simply looked like 2 zig-zag shaped walls made of metal.  \"What do you feel when you walk through it?\" my date asked after I walked through. \"Nothing.\" I respond, \"I don't get it.\"  \n\n\"There's no right or wrong answer.\" he says \"It's about YOUR interaction with the art and how it makes you feel.  When I walk through, I feel a sense of claustrophobia.  The way the walls are shaped would trap me into a tiny space if they were to close in on me.\" \n\nI look along the outside, and see that the 2 metal walls are shaped so that they would create small, boxed rooms - only large enough to fit a standing person each - if they were to close in on each other.  I also notice that they are clearly bolted in place to the ground so that won't happen.  \n\n\"Doesn't the bolts detract from that feeling?\" I ask.  My date just shrugs.  I wish I could experience it from his point of view but was having difficulty.  \"Hold on!  Let me run through it again to see if I can see what you're seeing.\" I say before racing back in.  \n\n\"So what did you feel?\" he asked again, once I was out.  I wished I could say something profound but it just wasn't in me so I answer back honestly:  \"Like I'm reaching.\" \n\nI am not artsy by any means and I don't usually think to go to a museum. But this museum has something for everyone and is, at the very least, thought provoking and emotion inducing.  \n\nAt first, some of the things just might seem stupid.  A urinal fastened to a wall will always look like a urinal to me.  I mean - I read the explanation and I guess I get it (the thought provoking nature and the sexual suggestiveness of a urinal) but I just didn't buy it (why would that urinal be worth more than any other).  \n\n\"So how do YOU value art?\" My date asked as I expressed my annoyance with the urinal.  \"By how aesthetically pleasing it is and whether it matches my decor.  I like stuff I'd hang on my wall.\"  I answer.  \n\n\"Let me ask you,\" he says while pulling me back towards a photo I was walking away from \"would you hang this on your wall?\"  I look at the photo of a drag queen with her lips pursed in an \"o.\"  \n\n\"No,\" I whisper back, embarrassed \"it reminds me of a blowjob.\"  I say, as I envision the photo being hung over the urinal instead and being used accordingly.\n\n\"It gave me that impression too.\" He responded.  I'm pleased with his response.  Maybe I'm getting it more than I think I am.  \n\nAbstract art is only a small part of SFMOMA.  There is something for everyone here.  Other art wasn't so hard-reaching for me and I ooohed over the skill and medium used in some pieces and surprised myself with the intense emotion triggered by others.  \n\nSFMOMA is an experience.  It's an opportunity to step back and look at seemingly ordinary things in a new light or extraordinary things in an extraordinary light.

Because I was.\n\nWell, the positives are that there are some good things here in terms of art.   It offers a nice cross section of modern art.   Also, the new addition is very pretty to look at.\n\nNow on the negatives:\n\n- Price:   $33 to see everything and no student discount (isn't SF already bleeding people dry enough?!?!)\n\n- Rain:   Want to see that fabulous living wall?   Well, I did, and if it is raining don't bother.   Despite the fact that there is a giant overhang outdoors where the living wall resides, and is completely dry, they had a \"closed due to rain\" sign in front of the door.   Apparently, when you walk through the doors of the MOMA, rain makes you melt or something\n\n-Layout:   The building itself is very difficult to navigate.   Nothing is intuitive.  It is difficult to find the stairs.   The elevators take forever.\n\n- Curators:   no one seems to know what is going on here.   They are very quick to tell you to not carry your backpack on your back, but when you need directions somewhere, they look at you like a deer in the headlights.   Also, many of them had VERY heavy accents that I wasn't able to understand.\n\n- Crowds:   This place does NOT know how to handle crowds.   Upon walking in, it was confusing which lines were for what, and there weren't any employees to clarify.   People kept asking us what line we were in because they didn't know either.\n\n- Lines:   We waited in line for 30 minutes to get our ticket, and then there was another 30 minute long line to wait in to get up to the next floor.   Again, everyone kept coming up to us, asking what line we were in because there was no rhyme or reason to it.   There was no employees telling people where to go.   Once we get to the bottom of the steps there was ONE person checking people's tickets, which is why the line was stretching all the way to Montana.  Once we got up to the fourth floor, there was yet another long ass line to wait in to get into the special exhibit.   There was one employee checking our ticket at the beginning of the line, and then another employee at the end of the line before we were let in doing the same exact thing.   Wouldn't it make more sense to NOT have two people doing the same exact thing when there was a massive need for bodies down on the first floor to deal with the chaos of the crowds??\n\n- Confusion:   The gentleman at the bottom of the steps in the lobby ( you know, the ONE person letting everyone in?) told us that we need to wear our backpack on our front or carry it ONLY in the special exhibit, however, once we got up to the second floor, some gentleman came up to us and told us that we needed to have the backpack in front or carried by hand in the entire museum.   I explained to him that that is not what the gentleman down below told us and that they were not all on the same page as to what the rules were.   Had we known that we were going to have to awkwardly carry a heavy bag with us the entire 3 hours we were there, we would have checked the bag in.   There was also ZERO signage in the lobby stating that \"backpacks are not allowed to be carried on the back in the museum\" like there are at most other museums....if they were, we sure didn't see them.   The man harassing us about our backpack told us that we were welcome to go back downstairs and check our bag, however that would involve waiting in that atrocious line again to get back into the museum.   Also, we entered an elevator from the second floor to get up to the 4th floor where the special exhibit was, and when we got up to 4th floor, they had all of the elevators blocked.   Apparently they didn't want people coming up THAT way.   Again, a simple \"please use the other elevators to get to special exhibit\" sign in front of the elevators BEFORE we entered would have been helpful.\n\nAs for the special exhibit, there were two artists featured:   Matisse and Deibenkorn.   It was presented in such a way that was supposed to show the influence that Matisse had on Deibenkorn, however, the correlations were a real stretch in most circumstances, and when, I left the exhibit, all I could think was, \"ok, so Deibenkorn was a total hack that had no ideas of his own??\".   It was weird.\n\n\nBasically, I am bitching because, out of the 12 or so museums I have been to in the last 5 months, this is by far the most expensive and the most disorganized.   I also felt like the staff only existed to reprimand people and not to actually be helpful to the customers who paid to be there.\n\nGet your shit together MOMA!", "author": "Christian C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-10", "description": "I absolutely loved visiting the revamped SF MoMA this past weekend, but I am actually super thankful that the 7th floor is currently closed for installation because my husband and I could barely make it through floors 2-6 in time for our energy to just burn out completely.\n\nThere are a TON of things to see with loads of nooks and crannies to explore, so if you're simply a casual art enthusiast who can only take in a small handful of exhibits I might recommend you skip the MoMA and go to a gallery elsewhere instead, or perhaps just consider tackling one or two floors here. I'm not sure if that will justify the price to everyone, though - while we were happy to pay the general $25 each since my husband and I are both \"over 25\" (an interesting question to be asked though I hope you get a discount if you're under 25!), that price may not be right for most who only plan to spend a limited amount of time looking around.\n\nIt was amazing to get to see the works of Susan O'Malley, Ellsworth Kelly, and even Andy Warhol in person, though I am not particularly a huge fan of the latter. There was a comprehensive number of different artists on display for each movement in every exhibit, which caused everything to become almost too overwhelming. Our plan of attack was to start on the 6th floor and work our way down, but by the 3rd floor we were in sprint mode, and after exiting the building my husband was ready to leave the city altogether. We certainly plan to come back, and now that we've been here once, we might have more wits about us to tackle it all another way.\n\nHaving this resource to view amazing art in San Francisco is, quite honestly, a blessing. Maybe I'm more inclined to look on the bright side than I ever was before, especially after how heartbreaking and trying this week has been, but I'm certainly glad we made it here this past Sunday because if taking in masterpieces from a variety of movements soothes you like it does me, this will be like therapy - and trust me, I know therapy.", "author": "Emily S."}

Yes, it is much more of an experience than the grand dame MOMA in NYC. Having recently visited both, I can compare directly. MOMA may have more super-expensive paintings, but the galleries are just much less than at SFMOMA. What is especially wacky at MOMA is how much square footage comprises areas not open to museum visitors. A huge pavilion there is an \"Education\" wing. Which makes no sense, since, unlike the Art Institute in Chicago, MOMA does not run an art college. \n\nNow for a direct comparison. At SFMOMA, I spent about 5 hours, until I was dead tired, and saw maybe 35% of the galleries. At MOMA, I spent 3.5 hours, and saw every single thing that I thought might be worth seeing. Yes, I did skip stuff that I knew had no interest to me, but still the contrast is huge. There's maybe 4 times as much art to see at SFMOMA, as at MOMA. (In fairness, MOMA is currently--2017--putting on another addition. But I don't have high hopes for this, since they went through a similar hoopla when they opened the Education wing, and that proved to be a zero for the public.). Unlike at MOMA, at SFMOMA, you never get the idea \"well they have a lot of space, too bad I can't go in there.\"\n\nIt also should be pointed out that the SFMOMA architecture does make efforts to be artistic. You might say, Well, shouldn't any art museum? No, consider MOMA: the building could be the headquarters of a detergent manufacturer. The original, small building had some modest elegance, but it became engulfed by completely anonymous corporate office complex type of spaces. \n\nMy only reservation with regards to SFMOMA has to do with the food service. Originally, they had a lovely cafe on the ground floor which was an excellent place to grab a good, nutritious lunch. Well, in the expansion it got replaced by one of those Napa Valley restaurants where if you have to ask what something costs, you can't afford it. Crazy high prices, intended for folks who want to have a place where to exhibit their affluence.

The 5th and 3rd floor cafes are only accessible by ticket holders, while the Level 1 restaurant is not.\n\nWe brought a backpack along which was not a great idea. They require us to carry the backpack in front or holding it in our hands, my guess was that they wanted to ensure we are not turning and hitting into artwork when it is on our back.\n\nOverall, a really enjoyable museum. Highly recommended activity to do! Look forward to visit again when they have new work :)", "author": "Cindee T."}

First, there's a lot of abstract, weird and fun arts. Every section of the room has one open art where you can get very close to the art- even close as 2 millimeters or if you dare go for one, but no touchy touchy~! It's very tempting, but you guys should know we respect these creative modern arts and plus there are securities everywhere, so it's best to behave =p \n\nAlso, on Thursdays there are open to public until 9pm !

This, however, happened to be my first one featuring modern art and it was freshly reopened after a massive expansion. \n\nTwo pieces of advice that enhanced my experience:\n- Take the elevator to the top then make your way down SEVEN FLOORS of exhibits. Everyone is moving in the opposite direction and climbing seven steps of stairs may be a great pain to some.\n- Allot yourself two hours or more to explore this place because it is HUGE! Two hours isn't even enough to take everything in if I'm being honest\n\nTicketing/Parking Logistics:\nTicket process works so that you buy for a certain time slot so that they don't overcrowd the museum (there are TONS of people). Teens and under get in for free while adults have to pay. You can do this online and definitely in advanced, earlier in the day. Parking can be crazy since it's in the busy Powell area. We decided on just parking at the Metreon and walking a few blocks.\n\nSome of my favorite pieces/exhibits:\n- Their LIVING WALL. A huge and beautiful plant wall projected to be the largest of its kind in SF\n- Andy Warhol section: loved National Velvet featuring Elizabeth Taylor\n- Oculus Bridge: my knees wobbled just seeing down through the grates at the floors below\n- Neon Lights exhibit: especially this piece by Dan Flavin that gave me Hotline Bling vibes haha. They also had these blinking neon light signs, including the inverted America sign I've seen on Instagram before\n- Pop Art exhibit: includes a really cool Lichtenstein and is where you'll find the Warhol section\n- Alexander Calder Motion Lab: a room full of beautiful mobiles and intricate pieces\n\nThere's plenty to discover here for everyone since it encompasses painting, photography, sculpture, performance art, film that it even warrants multiple trips! For instance, I walked into this place blind about what it included and found out later that I missed a work by Frida Kahlo, one of my all time favorite artists.

I've loved the museum ever since! I went a few more times before the remodel and fondly remember enjoying a slice of the famed (though no longer available) Piet Mondrian cake. I finally went back in May to see the newly reopened MOMA (thanks to Michelle N. for the member's freebie!). It did not disappoint! Being a coffee shop bopper, I also love the addition of Sightglass Coffee, but do miss Blue Bottle's rooftop outpost. \n\nThe Snohetta designed entry is a fitting welcome to the museum. Don't miss the walkway to get a view from the top. Love the outdoor spaces as well. When I visited, they had a Calder exhibit which is fantastic. You will see lots of great work, from Matisse, Rothko, Van Gogh, Kahlo, a wide-ranging photography exhibit and even a room dedicated to UC Davis art faculty contributions (go Aggies! go Wayne Thiebaud!). I recommend dedicating a few hours of your day to take it all in and fully explore. It's also very social media friendly, which is apparent when you check out the #newsfmoma tag on IG.

Impressive collection of art. .\n\nMOMA is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. Spanning over 7 levels, this is a whole day venture and worth the entry price. To save time at the door, order your tickets online to get in fast. \n\nStart your way from the top to the bottom. It works easier as there are lines waiting to get into the elevators. Go with the flow of the building leading you from the unusual to more contemporary pieces. \n\nIf you want to see the fame like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, you will find it here. Love the UC Davis & Chuck Close pieces. All very well laid out and chosen to compliment eachother as you walk through the levels. Very well curated. \n\nBut what captures my attention are pieces by lesser known artists and experimental mediums. In particular, there was an exhibit that displayed a large metallic 3D silver ball on the 7th floor. You walk into a small room with a strobe and you are confronted with what looks like a lucid metallic ball. You can walk around it and watch the ripples move as if you dipped your finger in a glass of water. It was fascinating and not like anything I have seen before. By far my favourite in the museum. So much so, my partner and I went back a couple of times to see it again. My only regret is that I did not take note of the artist name. So much talent! Very much the future of art. \n\nI did also love the living green wall. What a beautiful idea! I would love that on the side of my home.

And when you don't understand a piece at all, it's totally acceptable to poke fun at it if you're there with a sarcastic friend. But keep an open mind!\n\nThe architecture of the renovated SFMOMA is spectacular, designed by Sn\u00f8hetta (the company that designed the 9/11 Memorial in New York as well as the Times Square reconstruction). A pure, layered angled-cruiseship look that is out of the ordinary but still so pleasing to the eye. My favorite exhibit was Alexander Calder's hanging mobile structures. Simple, beautiful, balanced pieces. Don't miss it! \n\nVast wall pieces make for great photo ops, and there's even a living wall outside on the 3rd floor. There are outdoor patios on a few of the floors, with a Sightglass coffee on 3rd, which makes for a nice break from the long hours of standing and shuffling. \n\nTip #1: Be prepared for at least 3 hours at SFMOMA if you want to see everything. I spent 2+ hours there and there were still 2 floors I barely explored. Don't be afraid to take a break (or two, or many)! Cafe 5 is the best place to relax. \n\nTip #2: Check out the museum shop!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-08", "description": "I can skip to this museum from my home/office in ten minutes flat, so I've adopted it as my extended living room and personal cathedral for inspiration. You can make art without inspiration, and a good artist must learn this. But it's also possible to live in a state of constant creative arousal. SFMOMA can help. It makes a difference to do your writing while sitting beside an 8-foot expressionist painting. It just does.\n\nHere's how to write while sitting near art in a museum gallery:\n1. Check as much of your stuff--purse, coat, etc.--as possible so you can be light and free-handed. A notebook and pen is really all you need.\n2. Sit and contemplate the art.\n3. Sketch the art.\n4. Describe the art.\n5. How does the art make you feel? Write about this.\n6. Does the art remind you of anything? Write it out, the whole story.\n\nIn my previous review of SFMOMA, I offered thorough instructions for the wandering writer, including writing tips for both cafes, what to do if you didn't bring writing materials, and several pieces of art close enough to a bench for you to sit and write within glance-shot in the galleries.\n\nBut reading back, I'm ashamed to note that in the review I failed to feature even one piece of art created by a woman. I was inattentive, proving to myself that even if you're a feminist, even if the art museum is modern, the default is always men.\n\nSo, for Women's History Month, I give you 8 inspiring women artists with work located near benches on which to write or sketch at SFMOMA:\n\nSecond floor:\nLook for Mathilde Vollmoeller-Purrmann's \"Still Life with Fruit\" near the red elevators. The placard says Vollmoeller-Purrmann's friends described her as \"deadly serious\" and said she \"worked at a white heat.\" \n\nContinue to the bench in the \"North and South of the Border\" gallery, where you can admire Frida Kahlo's \"Wedding Portrait,\" Georgia O'Keefe's \"Black Place I,\" and Dorothea Tanning's \"Self Portrait.\" This is a sedate, contemplative, and visually luxurious room in which to write.\n\nThe room with the Rothko has a fine bench facing his famous and impressive painting, but if you sit on the short end of the bench, you can write instead under the influence of Joan Mitchell, facing the large-format \"Untitled\" textured knot of rich blues and reds or glancing right for the smaller canvas by the door, perhaps a more pleasing distance for viewing her chaotic tangles of color. \n\nThird floor:\nNow through 4/30/17, you can see the spectacular Diane Arbus exhibition. There are benches in these galleries, but they are all too far away from the small photographs to really be able to sit and write and glance up now and then for inspiration.\n\nBut take a walk through this show, even if you're here to write. If you feel like sitting down with the photos for some writing, follow the galleries to the very last room, where there's a nice big table with the several copies of the show catalog for your reference.\n\nFourth floor: \nHead down the long hallway to the farthest-back room, where you'll find the Agnes Martins. It's audacious for these paintings to hang in a museum, at least that's what museum goer reactions tell you. \"It's just a grid,\" I hear people whispering to each other while I write in this room. But I love writing surrounded by these paintings.  \n\nSixth floor: \nSit down on one of the hallway benches, where you can write in the shadow of Beverly Pepper's \"Tarquinia Cone Column.\" Made of iron, it looks like a big rusty pen--the very picture of a focused writer.\n\nHere's the thing. You are a beautiful genius. You have stories to tell and points to make, but all that stuff inside you needs lubricant if it's going to move out of you and into the world with ease and pleasure. Inspiration makes good lubrication, so exposing yourself to art while you create your own art will make writing easier and more natural.", "author": "Kristy L."}

However, we lost our parking ticket and had to pay $29 anyways (that's after spending 30 minutes driving in circles trying to look for parking)- what a damper.\n\nBest decision to go to the top and work our way down. We found the pieces at the top to be more engaging and fun than the ones at the bottom- but maybe because we were super tired and hungry by then. The museum strategically places a restaurant and cafe after some few floors but the lines seemed way too long for us to want to bear standing in.\n\nEach floor is huuuge... it was a little confusing to figure out the best route to traverse through each floor since the weekends was way crowded with people going in all different directions. Every time we thought we were done with a floor there seemed to be another turn. Not a bad thing though because I love looking at art- however wasn't impressed with some of the pieces (but what do I know anyways). And I somehow missed the wooden maze circles? Tbh after a few floors I was just hungry and tired of walking... but had to push through due to hourly parking and the promise of food at the end.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place to all the art hoes out there.

You knew him when, saw him through the awkward years, watched him grow into a shy young man, then suddenly he's abloom with confidence, a king of the world.  If you failed to visit MOMA when it was located at the Civic Center or prior to its closure a few years ago you have no idea of the significance of this transformation.  You'll just be drinking in the beauty that is now the largest modern art museum in America, appreciating the fact that there's more than enough here to keep you enthralled for more than one visit.  \n\nThe rest of us though?  We'll be marveling at this, certainly, but also at the cultural significance of San Francisco becoming a destination-worthy museum city.  That's a novel twist and a distinction we've not previously enjoyed.  What it says, I'll leave for cultural anthropologists and historians to discern but if I were to put it into my own words it would be something like this:  San Francisco has arrived.\n\nAnd that's from someone who has long believed that San Francisco led the pack in so many, many categories.  \n\nThanks to the vast expansion and the inclusion of an ongoing, significant portion of the Fisher Collection (of Gap fame and $$$), the new MOMA is now being spoken of in the same breath as NYC's MOMA and London's Tate Modern.  The Fishers lobbied hard to keep their collection in San Francisco, hoping for a dedicated museum within the Presidio.  When that plan failed other cities were eager to compete for the opportunity to house this collection leaving San Francisco politicos scrambling.  The new MOMA is the result of this scrambling and it might restore your faith in city government.  \n\nThe new MOMA is 7 floors of art (2.5 times its previous size) and 2 museum shops.  It's a couple of cafes, one with outdoor seating and Sightglass coffee served in Heath ceramics.  It's a restaurant (coming in June) overseen by a chef with 3-Michelin star credentials.  It's also home to the world's largest living wall in the U.S.  It's oh so many things but it's really about the art, this collection, in this gorgeous, mostly new space.  \n\nVisiting the museum has half inspired me to pen a thank you letter to the departed Fishers and the San Franciscans who saw a way then made it happen.  Let this suffice.  If you enjoy art and museums don't miss the rebirth/reincarnation of San Francisco's newest baby.  \n\nAnd to think, I knew him when...", "author": "Tracey A."}

Prices were surprisingly reasonable.\nMake sure you take a few minutes to check out the verdant moss garden growing on the museum walls (I believe it's on the 3rd floor).

Unfortunately, the app is only available on iOS so if you don't have an Apple device you have to purchase the audio tour, which is basically the app on an iPod, for $6. There are many cool features of the app like being able to take pictures and email the timeline of your MOMA experience to yourself; I think it's definitely worth it. The device battery doesn't last very long though but you can trade it in when it dies. If you're using the timeline be sure to email yourself before it dies because otherwise all your memories will be lost!\n\nI did almost all the guided walks on the app and my favourites are: \"I don't get it\" and the one about Germany. I didn't really like the ESPN one but I'm not that into sports. The second floor had my favourite exhibits. I also had an oatmeal cherry cookie from the cafe on the 3rd floor and it was quite yummy.\nWe spent 5 hours here and still didn't even make it to the 7th (top) floor! I would come on Thursday if you can since they're open for an extra 4 hours. \n\nAlso if you're 19-24 you are considered a \"young adult\" and tickets are $6 less than the regular adult price. Admission is free for teens and children. The tickets do have a time you're allowed to enter if you buy them online but I'm not sure how strict they are about it.\n\nOverall, I had a great day at SFMOMA and will have to come back to see the rest!", "author": "Jenny L."}

If you live in the city, the membership fee is also MOST DEFINITELY worth it as you can bring a friend for free (or if you're like me, and have a significant other-- you can bring two other people for free. If your partner somehow can't make it, you can go solo and bring THREE people with your membership,) and KIDS UNDER 18 ARE FREE! I don't really know anyone with kids or anyone who's under 18, but that's a pretty good deal. (I wonder if I can still pass as under 18.....)\n\nThere are 7 overwhelmingly large floors of art, and because it's been closed for three or four years at this point, our visits were crowded and kind of exhausting, to be frank. That may have ruined the experience of modern art for us. However, they do have a Sightglass on the 3rd floor, as well as a cafe/more casual eatery on the 5th adjacent to the Sculpture Garden, which is a little more affordably priced than In Situ, on the first floor (I'll write about that in a separate review though.) They have lots of space and cool exhibitions-- I can see this serving as a pretty nice place to study a bit too, as they have tables and couches around everywhere. \n\nThe more 'fun' exhibits were the interactive ones-- like the HUGE giant sculptures such as Serra's Sequence which dominates the ground floor. There's also lots of public space to sit and relax amongst the art. \n\nSFMOMA has an extensive collection of works-- though not what I expected-- this is definitely worth the membership for the interactive people spaces.

I was wondering if the pieces of red gum stuck inside the pipe are part of the artists intent or was some kid so upset that the best exhibit in the place was some hanging rusty pipes  therefore stuck his chewing gum all over it.   A sentence with an incomplete set of quotation marks leaves you wondering if this was an intentional  mistake, and again with modern art you just never know.

What I can say is that it is a beautiful space that is filled with light and easy to navigate around.\n\nEach of the floors has one or two exhibits so you never feel like there are too many things you're trying to look at in a space. Some museums seem to cram as much art as possible into a room and you're stuck with huge crowds all competing to look at the art. Here, everything is grouped thematically with usually just one or two artists work in a room. The space gives viewers the opportunity to stand and actually absorb a painting or sculpture, and look at it from different angles without jostling through a huge crowd.\n\nThere are some pieces that are clearly designed for the room they are in, Richard Sera has several that feel so organically part of the space that you couldn't imagine other things crowding into the same area. \n\nThe collection itself seems to contain at least one piece from almost all of the modern masters, but as mentioned, it usually isn't their most famous piece, but is instead a work in the same style. This is actually a positive in my mind. We've become so familiar with the art of Matisse, Picasso, Klee, and others that it is nice to see works that we don't feel like we already \"know.\" I think it invites us to look at them more carefully and to want to explore the artists changing style.\n\nLike any great museum, I'd prefer to visit a floor or a wing at a time, to give each work the appropriate consideration. If I lived in San Francisco, this would be a museum that the year membership would be well worth it for repeated visits.

Another favorite part of the museum is the Sculpture Terrace on the third floor, featuring the Living Wall.

What signage there is -- is sadly tiny letters on obscure walls. Elevator lights are recessed so you don't know which of the 4 is the next one unless you stand back 10 feet. The hubris of a sign which says \"use the silver elevators\" when the silver elevators are not visible at all from where you are standing AND they are not silver, just a washed out gray. Restroom male/female visual signs are too small to be seen from across the open space so, once again you have to ask.

They are from Marylin Ave School in Livermore which is a low income mostly minority group of kids who probably have never and would never go to an art museum in their lives. I'm a public school teacher who happens to teach Art so I was hoping they'd have a memorable time. Instead, the tour guide ruined the visit by her attitude, delivery and conduct. Their sweet teacher was in a tour guided by a MOMA docent named Mary Ann who treated the teacher with disdain and an attitude of snobbery. She also spoke to the kids like they were idiots, with no humor, over-annunciation and rushed them from place to place. She insisted that my husband/ chaperone hold a bag for her of art supplies for the entire tour. She skipped at least 3 spots other groups got to see so that she could be \"first\" back to the classroom. When there was an Art activity, the teacher asked if she could do it too and Mary Ann said \"No, it's only for the kids,\" despite having extra supplies. The group was hurried back to the classroom where they waited for the other groups to arrive for 10-15 mins instead of looking at art. It was a huge disappointment for everyone In her group and I heard all about it from my daughter, husband and her teacher separately because of what a horribly ill-suited docent Mary Ann is for groups of folks for whom the tour is their first impression of modern art and an art museum experience.", "author": "Christina C."}

We go to the entrance to the line for the exhibit and the lady checks our tickets and we start maneuvering through the line.

Modern art is pretty easy to absorb, so if you don't have much time you'll still enjoy popping in. It seemed like I liked every other floor (i.e. 7th was better than the 6th & the 5th was cooler than the 4th). Parts of the collection were from artists that I easily recognized like Andy Warhol. Some of the other names were more obscure and everything was well put together. I literally laughed out loud when we passed a Palm Pilot that was actually part of an exhibit.

There is an exceptionally hilarious floor (I think it's the 7th) where you get to view live video footage of the whole building. It makes for a great way to spend some time and spy on other museum patrons. It's about $25 to walk around for a day and spend time downtown. You could do worse.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-24", "description": "VERY disappointed with my FIRST viewing of the MOMA. This is as an artist who has not only visited museums in Paris (the Louvre), to opening receptions in New York and even here in California, so viewing fine and modern art alike in a public space is nothing new to me. Being openly embarrassed in a setting such as this, however, is very new, and not one that I will stand for.\n\nAfter taking an hour trip and spending the $20 to attend Family Day with a few friends at MOMA, I was greeted by relatively pleasant 'receptionists' who were eager to answer questions I had. After waiting in line and trying to find entrance, I wandered momentarily off the side before abruptly and loudly being told 'The entrance is over THERE!' by a greeter and directed to the right place. ...Alright. While I do not like the idea of appearances playing a role, keep in mind that I am a 20 year old, 5'11 black male who wore a black zip-up jacket (with a hood), khaki pants, black shoes etc. \n\nA sign of things to come, the 'policies' here seem sharked/enforced by the guards who I had the utmost unpleasant experience with ex; I do NOT like the feeling of being watched and hawked, and nearly every moment I had glanced over at a guard, they were staring directly at me (which had occurred on all 7 floors). Not only do I feel discriminated against, but profiled as well. \n\nIn addition to that, while viewing artwork on the 5th floor, I noticed a chair in a hallway inbetween exhibitions and decided to sit on it (it's just a random chair). There was no sign saying otherwise that sitting was not permitted... and lo and behold, a few seconds after sitting, I was approached by a guard who very loudly told me that I could 'go sit on the bench over there', away from the artwork, and that I 'could not sit there'. There was no reasoning provided. While getting up from the chair, the guard grabbed hold of the chair and snatched it out of my grip.. all while onlookers watched and the guests I were with remarked on his behavior. His response was a laugh and shake of the head. Disgusting.\n\n I felt completely humiliated in that situation and overall feel that the environment did not represent what the MOMA should feel as. While there was a lot of artwork to view and appreciate, I could not do so feeling like I had to constantly look over my shoulder. If these 'policies' are enforced in a way such as this, I don't think it's an environment suitable even for kids with that being said.", "author": "Justin J."}

I was really worried about how the new building would fit into the MOMA I know and love and was so happy that my experience exceeded expectations. (Side note: I've been going to SF MOMA since I was a teenager when it was still on Van Ness - it was my first art museum and where I discovered that I really love modern art.)\n\nThe best way to view the museum is to start at the top and go down. The museum guide handout is more than a map - it highlights the best from each floor and is a great way to plan what you want to see. The first two floors (7th and 6th) are the new building. The opening installations are highlighting the art donated by the Fisher family. Their collection has amazing depth and the installations highlight specific artists and/or movements. When you get to the 5th floor, this is where the old and new building intersect and you have even more gallery space. I think they did a great job of making transitions from the two buildings seem natural. It will take several hours to see everything so be prepared to do some walking.\n\nThere are cafes on the 5th and 3rd floors - the 5th floor cafe has an outdoor seating area so if the weather is nice, this is good spot for a break.\n\nPro-tips: for the best wow moment view, walk through Yerba Buena Garden and cross the street. Public areas are open an hour before the museum opens so if you want some alone time with the Richard Serra installation, get there between 9-9.30 am.", "author": "Lyn P."}

The museum is huge with 7 floors and 3 places to eat. A cafe with coffee and pastries. An outdoor cafe on 5 and a restaurant on the ground floor where prices were more in the $20 range and the menu sounded more appropriate for dinner than lunch.  \nIt took us easily 3 hrs to walk thru. The gift shop is large. Mostly books. I did buy a regular sized postcard of the museum for $1.50 which is overpriced. \nThe museum is pretty and room monitors are everywhere. Don't bring a backpack. They make you carry it in front of your body. There were not that many sculptures where your pack would hit if you made a quick turn but they make you take it off your back.

Tickets are on the pricey side, but luckily I was able to go in for free since I was still 18.\n\nThere are 7 spacious floors, each one starkly contrasting the last with what they have on exhibit, and everything is clean, clearly detailed, and easy to get lost in with all the winding corridors. While most of the walls seemed barren and too spaced out to me, I enjoyed the beautiful architecture of the building and the outside pieces as it was tranquil and less hectic than indoors.\n\nI will say that the elevators are regularly crowded, so what we did was rode it all the way up once to start at the top and let gravity do the work as we descend down each floor via stairs. The stairs themselves however are pretty narrow and steep, making it hard to traverse when everyone is bustling through. My other negative is that the employees are constantly on you, making it hard to enjoy each piece without feeling eyes on you assuming you're going to do something wrong. \n\nWas it worth seeing? Yes. Did it live up to the hype everyone was lauding it to be? Not really for my taste. If you're a huge fan of modern art and all things positively weird and interpretive, this place is for you! I'm personally more a fan of the de Young and the Legion of Honor, however, it was good to check this out while it was still newly opened, even if it was crowded and loud. \n\nEasily accessible from BART and you get Yerba Buena Gardens right across from it.

Art is subjective, is what I always say.  \n\nParked in the SFMOMA lot behind the museum at a pricey $26, but that's SF for ya.  The museum is beautiful inside, light, bright and open.  There are some lovely pieces, cool photography and sculptures, and some stuff that I could do better, and I'm not an artist.  Example:  Two urinals painted white.  OK, whatever.  Kermit on the cross a la Jesus.  That's just blasphemous.  No way could they get away with depictions of any other religion's beliefs, there would be a public outcry!\n\nDefinitely start at the 7th floor, and take the stairs down.  Even on a Monday the museum gets crowded, and the lines for the elevators can get long.  Also, don't bring backpack purses.  I learned my lesson from the Legion of Honor, and left my purse at home.

I got an offer for a membership and had been a member before--I waited about 2 months to get my card-- the cheque was cashed a few weeks after I sent it.  I had to work hard to get it-- a good customer experience is that you don't have to get something that you have paid for.  \n\nThe museums collections are large--the Fischer collection is divided out of the general collection which means you will see Ellsworth Kelly on a few floors as well as Gerhard Richter.  I think the collection should be unified for maximum viewer impact.  I am not sure it is philanthropy when long after the person who gave this Donald Fischer is in a way dictating where each of the collections should reside.  \n\nThe staff can be of the very appreciated and super friendly kind or the other kind is the not so very nice kind.  As example one staff member told me to place my small camera bag a certain way--I pointed out that I had been through a majority of the museum and I wasn't sure the reason why I also pointed out people with larger bags, backpacks, shopping bags did what they liked.  Very unprofessional and rude staff member.\n\nI was very hungry and hoped to eat something but the food offerings is superbly limited and hence only had a beverage--the Tate Britain is a great role model - several levels of food service offerings.\n\nThe overall space is well designed and I think the Botta (original structure) was way too small even when it first opened -- not easy to get around especially with the tiny staircase.  Now Sn\u00f8hetta fully optimised and made the space more accessible and logical.  Some of the angles in the staircase are very interesting--a bit too angled especially if a taller person is nearest the wall.  Glad to see SF MoMA reopened.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

The architects did an almost seamless job combining Mario Botta's building with their (much larger) new one.  There is now plenty of space for the extensive collection of both modern and contemporary art.\n\nSince what you enjoy about the collection is up to you, I am not going to highlight which portions I liked the best.  I will let you know that I enjoyed the multimedia works on the 7th floor which are not always appreciated by everyone. \n\nWhy do I give it three stars?\n\n1.  The audio guide is a disaster.  While it is trying to do unique things - allow groups to collaboratively enjoy the same content, use position information to tailor contents and provide walking tours, it doesn't work.  I traveled with a group of four.  During the course of our visit, each of our devices froze or crashed at least once.  In one case, it crashed three times.  The battery life was inadequate for a 2-1/2 hour visit.  We had to go downstairs back to the lobby to have it restarted with a pin.  We eventually found toothpicks in the cafe upstairs which allowed us to restart our audio guides.  Of course, each time it crashes, you lose your \"association\" with the people you are grouped with as well as your images and other personalization information.\n\nThe feature which provides \"nearby\" content when you walk into a gallery is too slow.  It is often a room behind.  I found myself walking into a gallery and then staring at it for 20-60 seconds while it updated.  In some cases it updated to a room I wasn't in.  I would have been perfectly happy with an old fashioned audio guide in which I punch a number into a device which is on a small sign next to a work of art.   It would have been quicker and probably would have worked.\n\n2.  Food service was a mess.  It is not sized for the crowds.  Waits are too long.  When I was there (on a Sunday afternoon) they were out of most pastry and snack items.  The outdoor stand which was set up had a really strange configuration which assured that there would be long waits.  Pastries were in cabinets which required the staff to literally get on their hands and knees to pull them out.  It was impossibly slow and there was no way for them to know what they had in stock so each customer had to play question and answer with the staff to settle on something that they wanted and was in the cabinet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-14", "description": "Because I'm too lazy to walk upstairs, I took the elevator to the top floor and walked down. It's probably not how the museum imagined visitors to see the collection because it's experienced (for-the-most-part) chronologically backwards, but it meant seeing the newest stuff, first. Considering SFMOMA has been very active with acquisitions, the most exciting new pieces (like by Mark Bradford and Lesley Vance) were on the top floors.\n\nThe 2016 expansion added plenty of galleries and the paintings have generous open space around them. This not only reduced crowding by other visitors that block the view, but created a better background for the art. Although there was more space for presenting art, there was more space allotted to less important things like gift shops and eateries.\n\nI incorrectly assumed the top floor would be structurally different that the other floors, but it wasn't. Top museum floors often have higher ceilings to hold huge works, louvered skylights to allow natural light into the gallery, or skyline views with an outdoor sculpture garden. The new building had none of these. With only two sculptures, the outdoor Sculpture Terrace on the seventh floor wasn't noteworthy. Thankfully, the old sculpture garden across the skywalk and next to the caf\u00e9 was still there and continues to be my favorite space of the building.\n\nThe old museum building wasn't outstanding and the new building isn't either. Considering how much they ripped through the old building, I'm puzzled why they didn't just start over from scratch instead of expanding with an addition that is wedged between other buildings like a book on a stuffed bookshelf.\n\nThe building's entrance has not moved and remains on Third Street. Don't use the new doors on Howard Street where the giant Richard Serra sculpture sits. Since the first floor is mostly dead space, go to the second floor to find ticketing and the entrance to the galleries. Allow at least 2 hours to visit.", "author": "Brian U."}

If not out of the museum, then at least behind a screen with a warning of some sort.\n\nConsider that I'm walking through the museum with my daughter, age 6, and we just happen to walk into the photo.  Brooke was 10, and her mother signed over rights to a photographer so that he could take a nude photo of young Brooke, in a soapy tub, wearing makeup, with the intention of the photo appearing a Playboy-produced photo book.  It's disturbing to say the least.\n\nNow consider that Brooke Shields has since litigated to regain the rights to the photo (so that she could remove the image of her nude 10-year-old self from the world's gaze), but lost that lawsuit on grounds that her mother then had the legal power to sign them away.\n\nSo here I am with my 6-year-old daughter, both of us faced with this shameful photo, one that Brooke herself has long sought to subvert, and the SFMOMA is thrusting it at us without any warning whatsoever.  It's in the middle of the room, eye level, couldn't miss it if you tried.\n\nI get the artistic implications of the photo and what it represents.  But knowing that Brooke Shields doesn't want it there, and knowing that no parent wants their child splayed naked for the world to see is too much to bear.  I honor and appreciate everything that the MOMA does, but that photo needs to come down, or at least be put behind a screen that says BEHIND THIS SCREEN IS A NUDE PHOTO OF A 10-YO GIRL, REPRODUCED HERE AGAINST HER EXPRESS WISHES.  If you choose to go in and see it, that's on you.\n\nStep up, MOMA.  There's art, and then there's exploitation.

I would recommend reading the signs that accompany the art as they are really insightful and not just a name and a date. I would set aside several hours so you can watch and absorb in order to process the artwork. If you go earlier than we did you can beat the crowds.

Otherwise, I probably would've been too drained to fully appreciate the upper floors. \n\nAs for the art itself, there's a great variety of mediums, subject matter and artists, and (I think) something for everyone to connect to, appreciate, or just feel SOME kind of emotion from. \n\nOther notes:\n-Free bag check\n-I don't remember if they're on every floor, but good number of restrooms and water fountains\n-If you do have a backpack, they'll make you carry it in front of you so it won't accidentally knock into anything", "author": "Connie C."}

Volunteers and staff seem a little overwhelmed by the vast numbers of visitors.  Just today, I had to wait a full five minutes to leave my back-pack. Surely self-check lockers (which are common in most European and Japanese museums) would save time, money and frustration. Then another wait to have my home-printed ticket scanned. One would think that at the epicenter of the digital technology world we could build an auto-scanner (as supermarkets and other stores have had for years) which could speed up this process.  Once inside, I still encountered vast empty spaces and empty walls, just as at the \"grand opening\" a year ago - one wonders how long it will take the curators and other staff to learn to utilize the beautiful new building. In 1995, when the old \"new\" building opened, it was only a matter of months before the building started to feel \"lived in\", and easily navigable for new visitors and members alike.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "Oh  how disappointing.  This review is for the remodeled space.  Why did MOMA not hire the original architect Mario Botto?  The remodel is a catastrophe!  The designers took a beautiful building and degraded the original beauty and integrity.  First off,  they painted over the lovely wood in the foyer with a cheap ugly paint.  They removed the original stairs which were interesting and replaced it with a boring staircase. Then, they used a different type of wood throughout the remodel with no continuity.  The remodel is tacky and pedestrian.  Everything feels cold and looks  institutionalized.  The permanent collection looks terrible and being off an entry way feels like an afterthought.  Visually from the outside the addition does not look at all like \"sand and fog\"- it looks like a big blob of an office building with shuttered windows.  Really bad.  The outdoor area with living garden is claustrophobic and so poorly designed it is embarrassing.  Water is dripping mid way and the over hang of the building is low and chops the space in half.  It feels like an after thought, as does much in the remodel.  It is unfortunate.  I don't think this addition will stand the test of time.  Perhaps this is what one gets when one hires a group rather than an individual.  The collective ideas combine to create a mess.  In a city where so much uninspired architecture is being built I expected MOMA to hire innovative forward thinking architects and build something creative and awe-inspiring.  The museum is already looking worn.  There was litter on the ground and paint chipping in areas.  I have been a member of MOMA for years and am saddened by this addition.  Fortunately,  there is much beautiful and innovative artwork to be displayed there,  still giving good reason to visit.", "author": "T H."}

Great Museum Store.  Here are my issues:\n\n1) NO seating!  I am disabled, bad hip---there was NO PLACE TO SIT!  This is ridiculous!!!\nI tried to get coffee and dessert, but they ran out of desserts by 2:00.  Can you believe this?  There were long lines and NOTHING TO EAT!!!  Amazing.  The toilets in the bathroom are so low---very hard for me to use.  This is a state-of-art museum...couldn't they make it more elderly/disabled friendly?  Or is this too much to ask of SFMOMA?\n\n2) Definitely don't eat at their restaurant.  I had a lousy Caesar Salad...it was awful!  I will never eat there again.  It took over 30 minutes for my friend to get her awful salad as well.  For a 1st class museum--this was a major disappointment.  Go outside and get lunch--lots of nice, inexpensive places to eat.\n\n3) Earphones...too high tech for me; had to constantly get help, could not get my photos...too much techie stuff, guess I'm too old for this.  SIGNAGE--it was impossible to know where an exhibit began or ended?  Is it asking too much for proper signage?

Everything is fairly traditional/conservative - nothing too political or risque here, save for a video installation or two, so you can feel comfortable dragging along grandma or the kids...\n\nFirst entry was worth hauling oneself out of bed early to beat the crowds; by lunchtime, even this capacious museum (apparently the largest art museum in the country, post-remodel!) was starting to feel packed.

Have always loved Matisse and had no idea that Deibenkorn was such a fan of Matisse. Quite interesting because Diebenkorn's early work comes across as more cold and calculating, without connection to nature. Every picture is numbered. Ocean Park #78, Ocean Park #127, etc. Matisse's work is warm, sensual, and in touch with nature. Yet, Diebenkorn collected books about Matisse's work, started to do figure studies, and over time even used several of the same decorative elements. Some of the museum exhibit writings really were a stretch, especially the one comparison of Matisse's Pink Nude to that of Deibenkorn's painting with a large orange rectangle insinuating a parallel.

I felt almost insulted from the amateur art that was on display. Amateur as in a five year old could do it and please don't give anyone the \"you just don't understand speech\", because people understand..we understand it's garbage and not creative. There was a urinal next to an old blanket with two teddy bears? That's not art, it's garbage. What left me with a bad taste in my mouth were the pictures of General Sherman's campaign in Georgia. For all the non history buffs..the march was one of genius and controversy, it was full of action and destruction. The pictures posted on the wall showed none of this..I didn't understand why those pictures were up? After I looked at each one I realized that anyone who was interested in learning about his campaign through pictures would now become dumber on the subject.  The pictures depicted nothing of the campaign or showed the real torment it put people and soldiers through. \n\nThere was a positive side to the experience, the art on the 2nd floor was amazing and it was easy for someone who isn't an artist to understand and appreciate. This art took time, dedication and talent to complete. Sadly, this floor wasn't able to make up for the hour and a half of utter non sense that was on display on almost every other floor.\n\nBest advice I can give is to find another place to visit that has real art on display that can depict history and it also displays a real show of talent in the drawings.", "author": "John L."}

I came to see the new building and to commune with the art alone and as a meditation, as I usually do. While I love the space and the collections, the hostility of the members of security totally ruined the experience for me. I completely  understand and respect that art needs to be protected, and that security is there to this end, and I make every effort to obey the rules and respect the art, since what I am after is a peaceful and meditative experience. On this occasion, I had a backpack with me, and the backpack is constructed in such a way that it covers my face if I wear it forward-facing (which is a requirement if you're wearing a backpack at the MOMA) so I carried the pack sideways (the only way other than backwards-facing that I could carry it). Three times members of security talked to me about it and I explained the predicament - the first one super polite and understanding, and the other two on power trips. Again, I understand the importance of protecting the art, but why is it necessarily to berate, belittle and scream at the patrons who pay their paychecks and support the museum without provocation? Interacting with some of the security guards felt like interacting with prison guards. The irony of the authoritarian and oppressive nature of these interactions given the setting made me wonder if I was being punked. Of course I'll be back to the MOMA (without a backpack or anything remotely resembling one) but I'm pretty bummed out about today's experience.", "author": "J S."}

Slow elevators (one out of order on a busy Friday ?). Ticket counter agents were uninformed, slow and just not happy to be there. Exhibit itself was cramped into a badly designed maze. Hard to see anything because there was an uneasy flow to the movement of people. Ticket checkers at the lines were unprofessional and also uninformed. In Situ restaurant was also disappointing and unimpressive. I asked the waitress what was the soup and her exact response was: \"If you want soup and salad type of lunch you should go to 5 th floor, we don't have soup here\". This was wrong in so many levels: 1- she assumed what I was going to have, also wrongfully assuming we are not spending money there. 2- she was rude  and unprofessional. Building and architecture looks impressive, but nothing else there was worth seeing. It is now designed for retired people to go spend all day, so they have something to do. It is NOT by my account designed and made for promotion and education of the arts. I have visited museums all over the world, and none have been as terrible as SF MOMA.

For starters, they opted to keep the 90s-esque black tile entrance, which now feels out of place and dated vs the aesthetic on the upper levels.  The addition and changes to the layout make the whole museum feel disjointed and poorly planned.  They seem to have designed the experience around the elevators. Because there's generally a wait and then the ride is overcrowded, I usually take the stairs.  But when taking the stairs, they dump you in the middle of each floor.  Which way do I go? I eventually have to retrace my steps to get back to the stairs. With seemingly bad flow throughout, I consistently wonder if I'm missing something. I've been back half a dozen times or so and see things I hadn't come across previously. Maybe this meandering experience is intentional? In the spirit of discovery? The ground level restaurant used to be decent, but we had a thoroughly unimpressive and extremely expensive lunch there. If we're dropping a hundred bucks on lunch, in a city that is packed to the brim with amazing restaurants, I don't want to feel disappointed and chapped. In hindsight the built in 20% gratuity is very telling. Also miss the Blue Bottle cafe at the rooftop deck. The spot they picked for Sightglass feels claustrophobic when packed with people, as it generally is. Lastly, the museum was filthy the last time we were there. We had a friend visiting from out of town and we all kept noticing giant dust bunnies everywhere- all over the floors and covering the Richard Serra installation, etc. They must have blown the budget on construction and can't afford a decent cleaning service.

She technically destroyed my day at the end of visiting museum. You know what? It's shame to have people who doesn't know customer service, who doesn't know how to speak to customers at museums. Such a low level of manner and lack of intelligence to see proper way to deal with, it's her own fault that she has job she hates! I really hope she get fired. You don't deserve to work at the places like museums when you don't know what is proper attitude and you can't wear professional attitude. I won't go back this museum ever again.", "author": "Micky F."}

This is definitely one of the best modern art museums in the U.S., as good or better than MOMA and the Whitney in NYC. If you love modern art and are in SF - and have at least a couple of hours to spare - don't miss this museum.

However, the only reason I'm giving this place three stars is because of the jerkoff worker that my boyfriend and I had encountered. \nWe came late to the Museum so were already on a time crunch, we managed to reach the 7th floor with about 10/15 minutes to spare. As we were looking around and reached the end of the gallery, there was the \"America\" sign that I REALLY wanted to get a photo of me and my boyfriend with since we didn't get any other photos to commemorate our visit to the museum. And right as were about to take our photo, these two workers (one apparently looked like he was training the other on how to start closing up the museum) turned off the light of the sign. I looked at him and asked him sincerely if he could turn it on real quick so I could just get ONE photo. (Keep in mind it literally is a switch that takes .2 seconds to turn on). And one of the workers (trainee) was about to go turn it on for us and the other worker (trainer) rudely said \"no sorry\" without even batting a eye in our direction. \nYou see, I would've understood if it was past closing time, but we still had about 5/10 minutes left. My question is, why put a certain closing time if you're just going to close earlier than said. I had planned out my trip so that the last 5/10s I could go up there and take that photo. SO to the rude worker, thank you for ruining my trip for me!", "author": "Jamie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-15", "description": "I like the new building on the outside. It looks like a cruise ship meets divinity fudge. The inside isn't very inviting, and it doesn't lead you from room to room. But that's not very different from the previous incarnation of the SFMOMA. It houses a nice collection of Art, and from an Art History perspective, it hits all of the landmarks, from the beginnings of Modern Art, through Dada, Abstract Expressionism to the California Figurative Movement, to the Conceptual Movement, Minimalism, Pop Art, Op Art, all the way up to Post Modernism and Conceptual and Video Art today. It goes chronologically, and as you move through the different floors and the different eras you really learn a lot about our culture. There wasn't enough time to see everything. And I did feel that a bit too much emphasis was placed on Koonz and his sculptures for my taste, but that's just me and many other people love his stuff. I'm more of a Post WWII mid-century fan myself, and as I got towards the top floors I got a bit less interested and excited. But I think it's a decent collection, and they did a pretty good job of housing it. I did feel bad for one very harried security guard whose job was to keep people from walking around a wrestling mat. There was TV in the corner of a small room, and the only way you could see it was to walk around the wrestling mat. It was an impossible situation, and I could see that he was going to be end up with an aneuryism by the end of the day.\n\nOne huge criticism is how they built a brand new museum, and yet completely failed to keep in mind how they were going to move people through it. So instead of building it with that in mind, they now have stanchions and people in t-shirts that have to herd guests around. During busy days, I can imagine those t-shirt wearing people get very harried trying to keep the visitors in line. Apparently when they hand out degrees in museum design it's not for people herding, it's only for the looks of the thing.", "author": "Abigail F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-31", "description": "This was a wonderful outing. Buying tickets online was very easy. We thought it would be blocked out, due to popularity, but over Memorial Day weekend, almost all slots were open when we looked at the beginning of the weekend. You could buy tickets easily a day in advance, or even same day. The building is beautiful, with tons of natural light and light woodwork throughout. It was full, but the galleries didn't seem too crowded (no jostling). You could easily look at any piece in any gallery for as long as you wished without waiting or feeling like you were blocking someone. Each exhibit is coherent, though there isn't, in my opinion, much coherent flow between the galleries throughout (e.g. how NY MOMA is chronological). My favorite pieces were huge color photographs (wall-sized), of a dollar store, a Pyongyang political rally, and the Chicago mercantile exchange) and the lobby's massive curved metal sculpture, which you could walk through. The international crowd was large, bustling, but very civil. I bought a one-day non-member ticket, which I thought was a bit pricey ($25), but it was worth it, and I'll probably not visit more than once a year. The exhibits, though not spectacular, masterpiece-wise, were laid out well; each exhibit is thought-provoking. Well done, SF.", "author": "Ice Cream Truck I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-09", "description": "SFMOMA should really be reviewed in two categories -- architecture and art. It nails the first category but falls slightly short in the curating of the second. Since this is a \"user review,\" not a formal critique, I'll stick to just the practical information and suggestions. (Besides, some of the curating issues are the fault of that MajorBenefactorFamily the Fishers. But that is a discussion for another day and place.)\n\nFirst, the new SFMOMA is enormous, so plan to be there half a day. Because the vast, new building sits on and envelops the previous one, the layout of the galleries can be confusing, and you can easily miss rooms if you aren't paying close attention. (Although evertything is well signed and easy to navigate, the signage is in small, subtle typeface.) I found the easiest way to approach this architectural behemoth is to take the elevator straight to the top floor (7th), and work your way down, using the stairs between floors. Be sure to allot some minutes to taking breaks on the sculpture terraces, to admire both the art and the city views (and the much-promoted \"living wall\" of lush greenery). I stopped for a coffee at the little cafe on (I believe) the third floor, where there was an audiovisual display showing interviews with artists featured in the galleries -- a nice detail. It was a good place to rest my feet for a few minutes.\n\nThe galleries are high-ceilinged and roomy, thankfully. I never felt overwhelmed by humans even though it was fairly crowded by mid-day (albeit on a weekday). Unfortunately, the ventilation system seems to be a work in progress, and some of the rooms felt airless and too warm, while the photography gallery was uncomfortably frigid. \n\nI saved the oh-so-famous Richard Serra spiral sculpture on the ground floor for last. There is some magical time warp or something happening in that gallery, which makes walking through the enormous, steel coil feel like a much longer journey thsn it is. Fascinating and not to be missed. Try to get there during a quieter time when kids aren't running through.\n\nParking is a luxury in the city, and is priced accordingly. I paid more for parking in the Minna Street garage ($26), for around four hours, than I did for my museum admission. Cheaper parking is almost always available at the 5th Street garage, if you don't mind a little walk. Better yet, if you are traveling in from the outer provinces to the south (like me), park at a BART station outside of SF and tske BART to the Montgomery Station, just a few short blocks away from SFMOMA. \n\nFinally, if the weather is fine, plan to spend some time across the street in the YBCA gardens. It's an absolutely lovely way to cap off your visit.\n\n(Even though the timed tickets purchased online cannot be refunded or exchanged if your plans change, it is still worthwhile buying them that way: you can walk right in, line up at the elevators to have your ticket scanned and get your sticker, and you are on your way. The museum should encourage visitors to use this method by offering a small discount. After all, it saves them money in man hours and supplies.\n\nAnother BIG shortcoming that should be addressed: there are no recycling bins at the doors for used maps. How can this be in a city that was an early adopter of curbside recycling?)", "author": "No N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-01", "description": "I don't think I have ever felt less welcome at a museum. My backpack was the issue. I got through the front door (past a docent and a worker) bought a ticket (where there were a whole bunch of workers, and managed to get through all of the second and third floor galleries. On the fourth floor one of the docents told me my backpack wasn't allowed, that I either had to carry it in my hand or wear in on my chest (and she suggested that with a straight face) or they had a free bag check down on the first floor. I'm traveling right now and I like to hold on to my bag (in which I keep all my worldly possessions at the moment), but I probably would have just checked the damn thing if someone had said anything when I got there. At that point I didn't want to go all the way down and then come back up to find where I'd left off in the gallery so I just started carrying my bag. After a bit of that I put it back on and kept walking around-- the whole thing seemed real silly because there were ladies with big purses and guys with satchels all over the place. I figured it wasn't a big deal, but then another worker came up and told me to wear my backpack on my chest (for reals) but this guy also said it was okay if I just wore my bag with one strap, which makes sense (right?). So I started just one strapping it. At that point I was bit annoyed but still really enjoying the art. It was when I again got accosted by a worker who told me that I couldn't have my bag on my side like that- the only way I could have it was on my chest (I actually laughed at that one) or I could go check it. I left. I wish I'd asked for money back because I did not have a good experience. If you're going to make dumb rules, like banning bags with two straps (which I guess is the policy because, again, plenty of other people with bags around) maybe at least let people know what your policies are before they come in. It's pretty damn frustrating to be treated like a miscreant just for having a backpack, but it's really even more frustrating to have a nice museum experience ruined. I'll just find pictures of thief collection online and next time I want to spend my money I'll just catch a marvel movie-- that would have been easier.", "author": "Sean S."}

I remember when the REALLY paltry collection was house in the veteran's war memorial building. I guess that dates me... anyhoo - They have a nice collection of Agnes Martin, alas, it's housed in a very brightly lit room, and a small room at that. I felt the pieces, which are kind of quiet and contemplative, are way too close together. It's IMPOSSIBLE to view one without viewing the two adjacent to the piece you are trying to contemplate. What a miserable experience! And you have to traipse through room upon room of Ellsworth Kelly to get there.....Do I sound like an Agnes Martin fanatic? I\"m not --- but I do hate Ellsworth Kelly. Important btw - did they finally get rid of the horrid roomful of Clifford Still? They (the Fisher's) have a nice selection of Chuck Close. The Richard Serra HUGE piece on the first floor is kind of wonderful - you walk into it. I think the motley SFMMA permanent collection has its own little area ---- it's a meager selection, dwarfed by the room upon room of Fisher collection. How the heck did they make so much money???? This is NOT a world class collection. It's a collection selected by these rich people - it's nice work, and it is a BETTER collection than the one poor SFMMA has been able to cobble together over all these years and years.
