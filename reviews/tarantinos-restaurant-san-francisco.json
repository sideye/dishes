But Tarantino's is my favorite.  They seem to be the best at maintaining a great balance of tradition, food quality and service, a drop-dead gorgeous view and location, at such a welcoming establishment.  And as you get older (sorry to confess) you realize there is SO much more you want from a restaurant than just great food.  I am fortunate to be in a position where price is not a factor.  But as a plus Tarantino's is moderately priced.\n\nTarantino's is right on the water with a view overlooking the private \"fishing fleet\" and hub-bub surrounding Fisherman's Wharf. It has recently changed ownership but the same server (Siobhan, pronounced \"Shuh-Bon\" ... rhymes with \"gone\") that took my orders 25 years ago is still there today and just as sweet and concerned for our satisfaction as ever. And even though I only get back there once every couple years, she still remembers our names and what we like and how we like it. You don't find that at many places these days.\n\nThe restaurant is starting to show its age but I am certain the new owner will upgrade a few things (like the carpet).  But I hope he keeps most everything else ... especially the wonderful menu and incredible window seating ... as traditional and good as it was 60 years ago and still is today. And the views you get there might only be seen from their restaurant!\n\nI love their Sourdough Bread Bowl Clam Chowder. A real San Francisco Sourdough Bread Bowl! And if you haven't had REAL SF sourdough bread there is nothing that compares to it. Most of the traditional bakeries are gone but a few (like Boudin's ... which you should also go to) continue to use their \"starter mix\" that they started over a hundred years ago.  And you will get as much of that great bread at Tarantino's you want.  You might even be tempted to just have wine and that bread they both pair so well ....\n\nMy wife loves the Crab Meat Louie Salad with the sauces on the side. Make sure to request your sauces on the side so you can decide how much you want or not have any at all. Their Crab is SO delicious. But as a general rule of thumb, most SF-natives will tell you that crab is best in months with Rs in them. So it is best enjoy to them from September through April, staying away from May through August.\n\nThat said, my wife had to have her Dungeness Cracked Crab in July and it was still incredible. I think Tarantino's knows where to source the best crabs ....\n\nMake sure to have seafood. It is always fresh at Tarantino's. And whether you enjoy your meal with a Chardonnay or watch the Sun set boil into the Pacific Ocean behind the Golden Gate Bridge (also visible from your window-side table) while you are enjoying a Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigo ... you will love you meal. Any questions about what to order, new specials, or wines ... ask Siobhan. With 25 years experience at Tarantino's she will do right by you.\n\nThe bar it is quite traditional, albeit maybe a bit small and not trendy. And the restrooms? They are kind of like what you would expect at a long standing restaurant in New York City. A bit tight, minimal, but they do the job and wear their years well.\n\nAnd that view.... You will be dining at a place that has more than a bit of San Francisco tradition at a restaurant that serves up more than just great food. I can't wait to go back ....", "author": "William L."}

They've got it down to perfection, and I don't know how they cook their potatoes or what kind they use, but Tarantino's nailed it; creamy, yet light, and velvety-smooth, not crumbly like most canned soups tend to have.  3) No sandy bits or grit in my teeth as I ate.

But I got lucky with Mary Anne in a dream, and I got lucky dining at Tarantino's in the City!!\n\nI was a little hesitant about eating here. I do really enjoy Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill (Gogo Yubari.... mmmm, yummy) and Django Unchained, But the filmmaker dude with same name as the restaurant has gotten enough of my money. Plus, he seems rather a twerp. Luckily, no affiliation exists, so I can dine without worrying about my karma.\n\nThis is a place we happened upon while meandering around Fisherman's Wharf. Looked enticing, in a great location, and the thought of some cioppino suddenly invaded my mind like Napoleon crossing into Russia. Well, maybe more like Alexander's campaign against the Achaemenid Empire, since the cioppino swiftly conquered me. When that uncontrollable urge for cioppino hits.... it must be sated!!! (That's usually my line for calzone, but works well here, too.)\n\nMy expectations weren't high, being in such a highly dense tourist area, knowing all that entails. But, I found the service friendly and professional, and quite helpful; making several suggestions for a complimentary wine for our meal. Was of course Italian! Was of course red! Like vino is meant to be!! I had the.... duh!! Cioppino!! Was pretty tasty. Wasn't spectacular, but overall it was a great dining experience. \n\nThe view is bitchin', if I can revert back to the 80's vernacular of my youth. (Yes, I'm old.) A solid 4 Star experience.

There were only a few other people in the dining area when we arrived at 6:15pm.  The waiter was quick to seat my family by the window looking out over the harbor for a nice view.  We ordered our food and when it came out we were happy for the most part.  I ordered the whole crab which was steamed and cooked like it should have been.  My wife ordered the crab salad sandwich which she said was \"OK\".  My kids ordered the fish and chips along with the fried prawns.  I had a bite of the kids fish and it had an odd mixed flavor of old / burnt cooking oil and frozen fish.  I wasn't too happy with the kids fish.  The prawns had a better taste to them, not the odd flavor that the fish had with the oil.  The wife ordered a Lemon Drop from the bar which was mixed well and had a good taste to it. \n\nAs for the decor of the place, it REALLY needs to be updated a little bit.

But when our plan A wasn't open yet, we looked for a plan B. When I saw their big board of lunch specials, read about their view of the Golden Gate Bridge from upstairs, and the view of the marina, we had to try it out. The staff warmly welcomed us in as they were opening their doors. We were on a food mission and Tarantino's did a great job of fulfilling our cravings!\n\nMy son wanted fish and chips, my daughter is a fan of fried shrimp and I was going to talk them into a calamari appetizer. Instead, we got an amazing basket of warm San Francisco sourdough bread and butter (my weakness) so I translated my calamari craving into an entree. All of our food was crispy but not greasy - battered in ways that best suited the food they encased while still preserving the flavor of the seafood. \n\nOur three-thumb review is three thumbs up!  My tween daughter loved not only the size of her shrimp, but the flavor. The individual shrimp were good size but also the overall kid-size portion. She also loved playing \"I Spy\" with the many names of boats and stores she saw in the marina. My teen son wolfed down his fish and chips! He is one of the few people that doesn't use tarter sauce nor malt vinegar in his fish and chips. He too couldn't stop raving about the flavor of the cod. He also got a kick out of the birds gathering to escape the rain. One seagull was silently willing my son to throw him food (but of course he can't). I personally loved the feel of going to a more up-scale restaurant with my kids and the bill was the most reasonable we'd had all weekend due to the specials. Plus we loved the view of the bridge in the fog and the sea life just outside the window. \n\nAfterwards we went for a walk planning to head towards Pier 39 though we didn't make it that far. \n\nCan't wait for the next time we are in town so we can drop by again!\n\n#MarinaView #GoldenGateBridge #Seafood\n#Blogger #MakesMeWander", "author": "Sarah H."}

We walked by Tarantino's and their menu seemed reasonable. Our child was in a stroller and we walked around the whole bottom floor looking for an elevator to no avail. This place was definitely not \"accessible.\" The whole downstairs area was vacant and not a single worker was to be found. We decided to carry our stroller upstairs to their main dining area. We were greeted by a host wearing a Nike workout black t-shirt with some sort of motivational statement printed on the front (not professional at all). The food was terrible (chicken badly over cooked/rubbery and the fish and chips tasted like it came out of fish sticks in the freezer). The service was terrible and we were never even offered refills on our drinks. The restrooms were dated, extremely small, not handicapped accessible, and no family changing station. Their HVAC vents were caked in dust and the carpets were worn/stained as if they had been there since the 70s. Best of all, a drink on their menu was advertised as a Cadillac Margarita at $10.50...yet the bill reflected the drink as $11.75.

I was pleasantly surprised, as we had already been waiting at the nearby Alioto's for nearly 30 minutes and got fed up with the wait. I figured any seafood restaurant in the area would have similar quality, so we headed here instead and luckily there was no wait. In fact, there were quite empty, which lent to a quiet and more upscale atmosphere in the dining area. \n\nI loved our server, he was always very perceptive and came at the right time to take our order, bring us boxes and the check, etc. He also had a sense of humor and joked around with our table as we were ordering, which I appreciated.\n\nI started off with the clam chowder ($7.50 for a cup). As far as clam chowders go, this was a very thick and creamy one with really good flavor. The portion was much bigger than I expected too, especially for just a cup. By the time I finished my soup, I was already feeling kind of full. All the complimentary sourdough bread I ate with the soup didn't help either...I was initially disappointed they didn't offer the chowder in a bread bowl here, but in retrospect that was probably for the better as I would've been absolutely stuffed trying to finish the soup and bread.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the beef ravioli in kind of meaty (bolognese?) sauce ($15.95). I don't like cheese, so I appreciated that the ravioli didn't have cheese inside like a lot of places tend to make them. If I remember correctly, this dish came with 6 giant pieces of ravioli. It was really good, especially with the generous heaping of meat sauce piled on top, but I was so full at this point I could only manage maybe half the dish. I really enjoyed this dish as well, as the beef filling inside the ravioli was well flavored and didn't rely on the sauce to provide all the flavor.\n\nMy friend ordered one of their crab cakes, which I tried a piece of. I've had crab cakes many times before, but the ones here were extra garlicky (and hence delicious!). My friend liked it so much she said it was her favorite meal eaten throughout her whole trip to SF.\n\nI also liked the atmosphere of the restaurant.

Passing countless Clam Chowder kiosks, I wiped away my Pavlovian response to the olfactory dinner bell and followed my nose down a side street until we espied the drink special signs standing in Tarantino's entranceway from which the tantalizing aroma of tomato, Italian spices, and freshly-baked bread wafted.  We grabbed a Happy Hour drink and a seat on the near-deserted second level of the restaurant with a lovely view of the bay.  Seeing as how we were in San Francisco, the actual the birthplace of Cioppino, I had to have a bowl of that delicious tomato and wine-based fisherman's fish and shellfish stew!  Our server was welcoming and refilled our glasses when necessary but for the most part, he left us alone to enjoy the view and crack into the succulent crab legs perched like a crown atop our humongous bowl of stew. \n\nBrimming with Dungeness Crab, large shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops and cuts of firm white fish (I couldn't readily identify it-- maybe halibut or sea bass?), the Cioppino did not disappoint!  It was a huge serving that I couldn't possibly finish and I indulged far past sating my hunger, devouring the crab, mussels and clams with no thought of Miss Emily Post or her pesky finger-bowls, and sopping up way too much of the amazingly delicious broth with chunks of bread I tore from the loaf of warm, crusty bread accompanying my enormous bowl of yum.  Miraculously (still don't know quite how) I didn't end up wearing any red sauce on my light-colored outfit.  After sampling a couple options, we chose a Zinfandel from the happy hour drink list and were surprised at its elegance (for a HH special wine we expected big jam nose, over-oaked and high alcohol content) and were pleasantly surprised at how well it paired with the dish and did not have a high-enough alcohol content to set fire to the pepper!  Specifically, the dark berry flavors were complex and complemented the bright tomato of the sauce while the smooth soft cocoa finish married with the red pepper spice and surprisingly did not overwhelm the lovely morsels of crab, white fish and shellfish (Note to self for future:  lesser-oaked, lesser-alcohol, full body Zin is a decent pairing for tomato-based seafood stew and offers an alternative to Sangiovese, Valpolicella, or Dolcetto)  Sooooooooo.....three glasses of the happy-hour wine, a West Coast sunset, and most of a seemingly gallon-sized vessel of Cioppino later, we left warm, happy, full to the gills, and ready to make the most of our last night in San Francisco.    \n\nThe only reasons I'm not giving 5 stars are the \"tourist-geared\" focus of the restaurant and the fact that I only tried one thing on the menu--which, even though they hit it out of the park with the Cioppino, I can't attest to their other offerings.", "author": "Rebecca M."}

Good service and low wait time. Better than other Wharf eateries, yet lacks high quality.\n\nAn affair between clam chowder and a loaf sourdough bread can't get any more scandalous than at Tarantino's, where the first dish on the appetizer section of the menu is a MUST. Even a cup will suffice the dazed and confused. \nQuestioning fate and your place in the universe? Clam chowder can meet your fixings and desire to savor life in all forms, especially when whipped up at a restaurant overlooking the Bay of San Francisco and the Golden Gate. \nThe restaurant before restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf's left side, Tarantino's is perched above a first floor and provides large windows worthy of a face-press on the glass. What I will concede is that the whole building is in need of a major renovation due to decades of putting food before housekeeping. If you're a stickler for what your feet are on instead of what goes in your mouth, be careful.\nBesides location, the ambience in the restaurant is all San Francisco: classy, but not the extent of making one feel underdressed or without proper etiquette. Tarantino's is most definitely, in my personal opinion, a place for a family or couple seeking deep nourishment.\nFrom lobster rolls to fish & chips to crab cakes, the options besides the sacred chowder are plentiful and delicious. I haven't tried the cioppino and have no say on its quality. Overall, the food is moderate in quality, except for specialty meals that require more attention. Don't come here for the vegetables.\nSure, the Wharf's residents all serve the same style of food as Tarantino's, but this place does seafood better than the stands reminding you of their existence. \nMaybe I'm harsh to the competition. Still, my fellow consumers deserve better than the struggle of scrutinizing in person. \nHopefully this review can can save you some trouble. \nEnjoy, buen provecho, and treat yourself some chowder soon!", "author": "Richard C."}

That's why!\n\nSince we were here on a rainy, gloomy, and freezing day, we didn't want to end up at a spot that you had to sit outdoors. So, we found Tarantino's and seated inside with a nice window view of the wharf. We ordered calamari and fried prawns for our appetizer and a clam chowder in a bread bowl each.\n\nI loved how crunchy the fried prawns came out and the size of the calamari was pretty big. The calamari sauce goes well with the prawns and the other sauce (not quite sure what it is) goes well with the calamari.\n\nI loved the clam chowder in a bread bowl. I love that they don't take off the sourdough bread from the lid. I was able to have a piece of bread with each scoop of clam chowder. \n\nOur service was amazing. I found a piece of calamari skin? I think thats what our server said it was (kind of a plastic feel) in one of my bites of calamari. I told our server about it as just a notification and to warn the chef. He ended up helping us out and giving us a discount on our food. Great lunch spot with a great view. Definitely must try.", "author": "Susan J."}

When you enter the resultant looks like it has not been set-up. We had reservations for 6:00 pm. First impression host is not friendly and welcoming at all. Finally 5mins later he sits us down. He brings us manus but no wine list, which is almost non existent. They only had one Cab on the list and they were out of it. We asked to change our table to be closer to the window, the host said he can't because that table is reserved, but few mins later they sat someone there who did not have reservations and just walked in. Now we have been sitting there for 20-25 min no waiter. Finally he comes we order our appetizers and wine. He brings the wine glasses they are dirty, he just pours the wine and disappears for another 20 min. Finally he comes back and says while our staters are getting ready if we would like to order. We place our dinner order. My husband ordered the Salmon dish, I ordered the vegetarian linguini, and my son order the seafood pasta. Few minutes later waiter comes back and says that they are out of Salmon ( really it's a father's day weekend and you won't plan for it to have enough fish in your restaurant) at this point it already have been an hour and we still have not gotten our appetizers. So my husband asked to replace it with halibut. One hour and 15 min later our appetizers come. The clam dish was cold un appetizing, my salad was wilted and they gave it a bath in the dressing. We are not even done eating our horrible appetizers they brought our food with in 5 min. The halibut was horrible, so brittle that if try to lifted with your fork it fell apart. My dish was so horrible that I didn't even eat it. Light marinara sauce was like thinned out tomato sauce, no flavor, veggies were, 2 huge pieces of broccoli and cauliflowers, artichoke-hearts and mushrooms were no where on the plate. Food was again cold and un appetizing. All this time not once our waiter came by to the table to see if we had our food or if we needed any thing else.  I could not eat my food it was disgusting. Finally the food runner asked if we wanted our bill. We told her how disappointed we were she was kind enough to remove my dish and my husbands dish off the bill. We paid our bill and left.

Everything on the menu is as you would expect from a seafood restaurant from various fish options like fish and chips, salmon dishes to pasta with clams, appetizer oysters, clams in wine sauce etc etc. I had the crab cakes which were interesting. Tasted great, but they were flat with a mango chutney on top. The mango was unnecessary but the cakes were surprisingly flavorful, but I would prefer the plump cakes as it packs more taste and adds more delicate features to the dish. \n\nThey also have a short list of wine.

This review is going to be strictly based on the Stand experience.  If you walk around the 7 vendors on this strip, you can see some variation in recipes and in freshness. \n\nI will admit, Tarantino's is a visual paradox.  On he Wharf side, it is a beautiful dockside restaurant with a much shallower footprint than Nick's, Sabella and La Torre, Alito's, et al...  On the Stand side, it is not the prettiest of the bunch.  Visually I'm not a fan of the Crab/Shrimp-salad on a piece of lettuce over sourdough.  The Calamari sometimes looks really good.\n\nHere's what's good:  Chowder.  And, I'll tell you, this is my favorite Clam Chowder from the stands.  And, it's right next to the best and most convenient spot to eat chowder.  Here are the details:\n\n1.  This is sort of around the corner from the main-strip of the Crab Stands at the end of Taylor Street.  So, it feels a little different.\n2.  It is right next to the \"Official\" spot that is considered Fisherman's Wharf, which in my mind is Jones to Taylor, right along the water, looking out towards the boats.\n3.  They have three unique Crab Stand dining features which set it apart,  One, street side tables on Jefferson.  Two, a little deck area right by the Fishing/Charter Boats.  (BTW - I think I had a drink down here with a future Gilligan)  Three, and most impressively, you can take outside food inside if you buy it from their stand.  They have a whole area set up.  I almost hate to tell people it's here, because it will get busy.  \n4.  The area I mentioned above is facing an amazing view of fishing boats.  And believe me, this part of town is as pretty as anywhere on a clear night at sunset.\n\nBTW - As of 1.5.16, I have not been upstairs to eat or drink at the bar.  But, I did see that the bar has some Warriors adornments.  I wouldn't have expected a bar with a sports-vibe in a dining room right here.  Intriguing....", "author": "Adam S."}

Being so near to the bay, we were excited to get some fresh, local seafood.\n\nWhen we first got the restaurant, we realized that we needed to walk up the stairs to access the main restaurant. There is a to-go restaurant located just outside and the bottom level is available for seating.\n\nWe were quoted a 30 minute wait time, even though the restaurant was not full, so we settled down at the bar to wait. \n\nOnce we were seated, we decided to order off the lunch menu. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. The food was ok, but really nothing to rave about. \n\nOur table overlooked the bay, which was cool. It was a little warm being near the window with the sun shining, but they had sunshades which was great. \n\nThe service was awful.

I ate at a restaurant and not the \"market\".\n\nWhen you crave seafood and you want fresh this seems like a decent place at first. It's more formal than most places and the prices are about equal in the area.   But what's wrong? I ate inside and not at the stand. \n\nFirst the upstairs dining area has almost a convention or wedding setting to it. Just large open area that seems it is better suited to be rented out for special occasions. \n\nNext was the food.... Now this was not all bad. The chowder was good. Not the best I have ever had but it was a solid 6.5 out of 10. For the main course I ordered the seafood fettuccini with baby shrimp and baby scallops. Some of the scallops were over cooked to the point of ruining their texture. The white sauce was bland and relied more on the seafood to give it flavor. \n\nWife ordered the mushroom and shrimp pasta that she enjoyed but could not finish. I complained to her that it had way to much mushroom kick to it but she liked it.  So if you love mushrooms that is the plate for you. \n\nMy youngest got the fried seafood platter. And wow... This was not chips sized. Huge basket of food. Though she only got one scallop and prawn it was huge among of calamari and fish. \n\nI know in the future I will not eat in the restaurant again...

He made himself available, yet did not seem intrusive at all.\n\nFood:\n- Crab Cakes - Served with remoulade, mango salsa, potatoes, and vegetables. The mango salsa was slightly sweet and fruity. It was a nice change of pace, since crab cakes are usually only served with savory sauces. I liked that they still gave a cup of remoulade, in case you prefer the more traditional sauce to compliment the crab cakes. The crab cakes themselves were not bad. The crab was finely shredded with some breading.\n- Crab Sandwich - On Italian country bread. This was more of a crab salad sandwich, which I wish I would have known before ordering it.

The seemingly harried and unkempt manager asking the bartender to take a party of twelve, they looked like they had been seated twenty minutes already, and had NO drinks, even water.\n2. No paper towels in the bathrooms.\n3. Being the only couple waiting, with five empty tables minimum, almost twenty minutes to be seated.\n4. Waiting twenty minutes for two waters and a glass of red zin, without ordering, not by choice.\n5. Seeing only 3 wait staff including the busser.\n6. Waiting 40 + minutes order, only to find out they were out of calamari, salmon, table bread and something else that I forget.\n7. Our waiter saying \" I'll be right back\" no less than six times, with twenty minutes in between.\n8.The table behind us waiting even longer to order-and receiving their food twenty minutes after us. I'm fairly certain they had only 3 chowders and a ravioli. Estimated wait for them, approx 1 hour, 10 min.\n9. The drink order for the table to our left coming out wrong, twice, 2 diet cokes, a tea and a Shirley Temple, even I knew their order. Right after this, we received room temperature clam chowder resembling gravy with potatoes, I located one clam, and it may have been a potato.\n10. 85 minutes in, our food arrives.

The staff seemed very unorganized and not professional at all. If there was a manager, it wasn't apparent. The decor is very dated and the place needs a serious make-over. The carpet was actually dirty. It took a long time to get our meal ordered and of course, it took the same amount of time just to get water. We order their Cioppino and after a very long wait, we shared it between two of us ($32.75). Rather than bringing bread out ahead of time, the waiter brought it out when he brought out our meal. The bread was cold so I asked if it could be warmed up. 15 minutes later, still no bread. When the waiter came by again, he acted surprised that no-one brought our bread back out although it would have been his job. The small dish of cioppino was very disappointing. The pieces of the fish were tiny and so were the mussels and clams. Their cioppino does not come with pasta so the dish is not filling at all. Once we finished the ciopinno, the bread was finally brought out to our table. The waiter said someone stole our bread so he had to get more warmed up for us. One likes to think that San Francisco is a good place to get seafood but I think that since there are so many customers who come here without knowing, Tarantino's doesn't really care how good their food, service or appearance is, since the customers will come anyways.

And location was the docks overlooking the bay. \n\nThe menu was fully pedestrian, Italian, with moments of seafood.\n\nI ordered the shrimp cocktail (for lack of anything better on the menu), followed by grilled scallops with shitakes.  The shrimp cocktail consisted of a bed of tiny shrimp stuffed into a cocktail glass with some cocktail sauce and wilted lettuce.  Like eating larvae or maggots.  It tasted good, technically, but the visual, and the texture of tiny shrimps on the tongue, bordered on the disgusting.\n\nThe scallops were much better but the shitakes were ruined by a thick, salty cream sauce, probably meant to satisfy any biscuits and sausage gravy lovin', heart attack victim in the making.

When we ordered, she cut me off midway through as I was telling her what I wanted (the seafood linguine) and did the same to my boyfriend(the crab salad sandwich)..after hastily writing down our orders she just left. She never asked if we wanted anything else(appetizers, drinks etc) which we did (my boyfriend had wanted to order the garlic bread but we were so rushed we never got to). \n\nWhen we received our food, I won't lie, I was disappointed in the size of the shrimp. They where tiny (like salad shrimp)! Taking a look through other reviews and photos from guests that ordered the same thing, I saw a variation in the size of the shrimp..some got tiny shrimp like I did, while other photos show full size shrimp?? Not sure how this is the case, the size should be standard(the larger shrimp) especially when paying $18+ for a lunch item. The scallops where also small however they where cooked perfectly so no trouble there. I did enjoy the sauce on my pasta as well. The crab salad sandwich my boyfriend got was very bland and tasted mostly of mayonnaise, not really worth the $18+ he paid for it. \n\nWhile we were eating, our waitress began clearing the table of the girls who were sitting next to us. While taking their plates, she also took a bowl of Parmesan cheese she had left with them. After clearing their plates, she proceeded to take this USED bowl of Parmesan cheese and place it on another customers table for their use! Completely unsanitary! This almost made me stop eating, wondering if the Parmesan she had previously sprinkled on my pasta was also taken from someone else's table..\n\nFinally, after finishing my pasta, I found what looked like a piece of wax paper or thin plastic in my sauce..? That was a great vote of confidence after finishing a dish..\n\nAfter waiting a good 15 minutes for our bill after asking for it, I was ready to leave. Again our waitress seemed hurried as she quickly dropped off our bill and left without a word. We left and not a single employee thanked us for coming or even really acknowledged we where there. Not the kind of service you'd expect at a nice restaurant after dropping a good deal of money on lunch. \n\nWhile overall the food wasn't terrible (not really rave-worthy either) this review gets its low rating mainly due to the service. We won't be coming back and would not recommend this place. There are plenty of better restaurants to try on the warf.", "author": "Alicia W."}

The chowder was tasty!  A couple of beers and a sit at a sidewalk table watching SF tourists go by.

It's romantic and cute. However, the service isn't the best.\n\nLong Review:\nI was visiting Fisherman's Wharf with my fiance, and this place came up as something that could fit our budget.\n\nThings were a bit weird, at first. We were looking at a menu downstairs before deciding whether or not to go upstairs to a table, and some dude in all black started talking to us. We couldn't hear anything he was saying, and he was just...weird and rude when we tried to tell him that we couldn't hear him. We eventually just ignored him and went upstairs. Turns out he works there as a waiter! Additionally, he was the only waiter that didn't have his shirt tucked in and had stains on his shirt. Just saying. Hope he shapes up or gets let go. \n\nAfter we were seated (by a different, nicer waiter), things got a lot better. We got a table by the big windows looking out onto the water, and the view was lovely. Each table also had flowers in little white vases, which was a nice touch.\n\nI ordered half of a Dungeness crab, and my fiance ordered the Sopa di Pesce. I think that literally means \"fish soup\". My crab came with a small cup of clam chowder, and it was SO TASTY! It was so good that my fiance immediately ordered a cup for himself! I only wish that for $8, they'd give you a bigger cup, but oh well. It would probably be better to pay a couple dollars more for a bread bowl if you want to get full off of this chowder.\n\nThe crab was very, very, very delicious, but smaller than I thought. The waiter wasn't helpful in letting me know how big my food would be when I asked before ordering, so I went with the half when I should have gotten a whole crab. Get a whole crab. DO IT--unless you eat like a bird.\n\nMy fiance's Sopa di Pesce was enormous, though. He is a big eater, but he couldn't finish it on his own. I highly recommend it. It's essentially fish and clams in marinara sauce, but god is it DELICIOUS!! They're also REALLY gratuitous with the salmon in this soup. Perfect for a salmon lover like me! :)\n\nAt this point, the service started to suffer. The waiter didn't really come around to refill our water for a good hour. The reason we hung around so long was due to our dessert--which took a while to bring out--and the fact that they took forever to bring us a check. We shared a key lime pie that was heavenly, but after getting so full, both of us just wanted to leave. It took the servers at least 30 minutes to get us our check, and I really wasn't a fan of that. This was especially disappointing, given the fact that the restaurant was fairly empty. I would be more understanding if the place was busy.\n\nWhile I am a fan of the food and the gorgeous view, the service here needs some improvement. However, it was an overall great experience! I would come back again.", "author": "Jaimie C."}

All of these restaurants walk the fine line between classic and tourist trap. One in doubt, stick to the basics. The San Francisco dish cioppino is great here. Awesome flavor, loaded with tons of seafood (including crab and tons of bay scallops), and accompanied by a very delicious sourdough garlic bread. Have no doubt, this is the dish to order here. \n\nI also tried the seafood platter which was good. Props to the service for allowing us to change the tilapia for cod. It was a great choice. The garlicky vegetables on the side were surprisingly tasty. Their clam chowder is not bad either. \n\nThe one disappointing dish was the pan-fried scallops. It just was not right. They didn't have a nice sear, were somewhat gummy, and the sauce did not help. We should have stuck with the basics. Props to the restaurant for taking them off our bill once we pointed out that the dish was disappointing (especially when compared to the other great dishes). \n\nService was good and the cioppino was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-06", "description": "There are two kinds of people in this world: those that treat the sourdough bread bowl as a mere vestibule for the clam chowder and those that give the bowl the reverence it deserves by slurping down the chowder and then stuffing the soup-soaked bread hunks in their maws while showering their neighbors with chowder flecks. I don't trust people who refuse to even at least give the task of consuming the bowl a good old college try. The bread is honestly the best part. Whenever I see a waiter carrying back uneaten bowls from the table, a part of me always feels the same way that I do when leaving the pound - I want to give all the bread, I mean, dogs, a loving home. \n\nAnyway, the clam chowder here is excellent, made even more so by the healthy view of the Bush man terrorizing people down below. Tarantino's is one of the many restaurants dotting Fisherman's wharf, where a waiter parked outside tries to beckon in the stray tourist that had managed to escape the black hole of Boudin's sourdough crocodile. I didn't love the heck out of my bay shrimp and avocado salad but it was my fault for ordering a salad at a seafood restaurant. \n\nAlso ... I was with a dear family friend who I knew would create the world's largest scene if I paid for the meal, so I did that sneaky thing by trying to give my credit card to the waitress while he was in the bathroom. Only our waitress was nowhere to be found, so I flagged down the server who had pulled us in from the street. I saw him point out my table to the newly reappeared waitress, who rolled her eyes and threw up her hands. It's 90-10 that when a customer wants to speak to you, it's not good. But there's that 10% chance that I just want to pay for the order now. She hurried over, all sunshine and rainbows, and I turned back to my bread bowl. \n\nAnd all was right in the world but I think I'll try Boudin's next.", "author": "Joy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "Large restaurant, bright and clean fine-dining area, and fairly spacious seating, which was a welcome change from many other restaurants, both in Vancouver and San Francisco.\n\nAfter sampling a tasty creamy-thick \"award winning\" clam chowder at Fog Harbor, I was mildly disappointed to hear that Tarantino's didn't have award winning chowder, though the server said they had won in the past.\n\nAfter my experience at Boudin with too much bread, I should have passed on the bread and instead gone to yet another clam chowder experience, but I was also curious to try out the chowder-with-bread eating strategy I came up with.\n\nBoston Clam Chowder ($8.50, or $8.75 in sourdough bowl)\n- Sourdough here was less crusty/hard than Boudin's. Had a thinner, chewier crust.\n- The cap of the sourdough is not completely removed from the whole bun. Combined with the chewy crust and bun-bowl full of chowder, this can make it tricky to tear off unless you do it carefully.\n- A more soupy/watery chowder, similar to Boudin's, but rich and... buttery? I prefer thicker chowders like Fog Harbor's, but the taste here made up for it.\n- Definitely taste the chowder separately from any bread to get the full flavour experience. It is very easily overshadowed by the sourdough, especially the crust.\n\nOnce again, having the sourdough turned out to be a net disadvantage -- too much bread, competing taste, and leftover bread cap.\nIf you are dining with someone, maybe two persons can share the one bread bowl. Not sure if you can get the bread bowl \"on the side\" but you can at least tear off portions between the two of you.\n\nVarious parts of the service were disappointing, so unfortunately I have to take points off for that. I am honestly tempted to rate them a 3/5 except that the chowder really was very decent and despite the service the servers were polite to an underdressed tourist at their fine dining establishment. Even if they deliberately understaffed the slow afternoons and it is not the server's fault, it is still the responsibility of the establishment.\n- At the time I dined at around 1 PM, the (very large) dining room was still quite empty. No idea then why they sat a large family right next to me, though it may possibly have been a special request on their part for a specific window seat -- though unlikely because there were numerous window tables with great views.\n- No water to start and it never appeared until after I asked for it, and basically AFTER I was nearly completely done with my meal (down to the last bites, pretty much).\n- When I asked for water, two servers were right next to me preparing a table. I honestly didn't think it would take very long for them to do it, so I told the server there was no hurry with the water. Turns out it took them several minutes to prepare the table. By then I was almost finished with my meal.\n- Maybe this is expecting too much, but I think the waiter should have noticed that I was almost finished with my clam chowder and been a bit more available or a busser should have come to clear the table. Instead I think I waited about five minutes before I was able to even spot someone to flag down and wrap up my time there.\n\nAlso annoying was the amazingly small men's bathroom. We're talking about barely being able to close the stall door and maybe a meter between the sink and the urinal. At least it was worth a laugh between me and the other gentleman in the bathroom that this had to be the smallest bathroom we'd ever been in.", "author": "Simon S."}

When we walked in, no one was there to greet us.  There was a sign stating to walk up the 2 flights of stairs to enter the restaurant.  When we got to the top, there still wasn't anyone to greet us and there wasn't a host stand either.  The place was pretty dead with just a few tables occupied.  After a few minutes, we were approached and seated at a nice table by the windows with a great view.  The table wasn't set, however.\n\nWe were surprised at the menu prices, especially based upon the almost bare bones decor of the place.  We decided to give it a try since we were there. The waiter was curt and although he tried to cover up his disappointment with us, he wasn't successful.  My friend wasn't very hungry and ordered spaghetti with pesto.  The waiter condescendingly explained to my friend what pesto is when my friend had a brain fart and asked what it was because he wasn't sure.  I ordered seafood linguine with a soda.  The servings were small and each entree was over $20.  There were a total of 5 shrimp in my pasta and they were the tiny shrimp, not even the regular sized.  The couple of scallops were also very small, and the sauce wasn't very good, lacking flavor and spices.  I was eating the dried, hard bread that had been served, dipping it in the bland sauce, simply because I was hungry, not because I wanted the bread. The bartender didn't make my Roy Rogers very well either; it tasted more like Diet Coke with one squirt of grenadine. The waiter didn't refill our waters nor my soda, and he removed my bowl before I was finished eating!  He didn't even ask!  Then he brought the check without asking if he wanted anything else, and he never checked on us.  Incredible.\n\nI don't know how they are in business.  They are wasting this perfect location.\n\nThe interior design of the restaurant needs a major overhaul.  Plain green carpet from 1970 with zero pictures, no centerpieces, and not the best silverware added to the bad experience.\n\nWe were both still hungry when we left!

The lunch did include a couple of tiny potatoes and a few veggies, but in SF, I'm expecting the seafood, especially at a nice restaurant, to be at least decent.\n\nIf you want good, well-priced seafood, stop at one of the wharf stands. Don't pay double the price for worse food. If you want to hang out inside and enjoy the view, stop here, but don't order the crab cakes. Stick with the clam chowder and free bread.", "author": "Olivia B."}

No one taking charge on customer lines to direct you where to order, pay, pick up food, etc. I saw people ordering on the right and left side so, I stood in the left line. When the folks in front of me finished paying and receiving their food,  the cashier just walked away and never came back. I ended up having to move to the right line and stood behind even more people who arrived 10 minutes after me and the closer I got to the front the more I realized the stuff I wanted to order was finished and it would be more then a 10 minute wait for another batch. \n\n2. My husband got there 20 minutes before me and ordered crab. The guy forgot to put the order in so about 30 minutes of waiting we finally received it. The crab was nasty with no flavor. I'm guessing they boiled the crab instead of steaming it because it was bland and had no trace of being from the sea. \n\nI ended up throwing the crab in the garbage and we will NEVER eat here again.

He kept forgetting what we ordered, got the dressing messed up on our salad, and barely came to our table.  Our waters were empty and he didn't refill them till we asked.  This restaurant seems like they want to be classy, but its not quite there.  It's stuck in the limbo between being classy and inelegant.\n\nNot a great experience.  I would rather have just ordered the food outside on the sidewalk and enjoyed my SF experience there.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

Thankfully, we stumbled on Tarantino's.  Its around the corner from the main wharf, so it doesn't get as busy, but you still get the same yummy Fisherman's Wharf grub.\n\nBoth of my trips out here involved early dinners (well, around 6pm on a Saturday night) so I've been lucky enough to grab their dinner special.  On my most recent trip (early birthday celebration for me, yay!) the dinner special was a dungeness crab plus soup for like $20 something?  Awesome!\n\nThe service was excellent, our server was extremely attentive but not overbearing.  She made sure our glasses were always filled and our \"garbage bowl\" was always empty.   She was extremely sweet :)\n\nMy favorite part of eating at Tarantino's though, is the view!  Most of the restaurant is located next to floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the SF Bay.  We got to watch some of the sea lions playing in the water as well.\n\nDefinitely a spot to check out if you have time for a sit-down meal in the Fisherman's Wharf area.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-25", "description": "I considered the rating I gave one of the other restaurants on the Wharf in making this review. Fact is, the entire area is touristy and therefore overpriced, but I think you need to take that into account when you eat here. This particular iteration of the Wharf theme I found particularly pleasant. The service itself was spectacular, actually - not because the waitress was perfect, because she had a teensy problem catching our orders and splitting our checks (which was admittedly our fault because we didn't ask before we ordered) - but because she was so freaking nice. I actually remarked to my tablemates that hers was the kind of service you get and then think to yourself, \"oh yeah, THIS is what good service is supposed to be like.\"\n\nAnyway, the food. I split a caesar salad with my brother and we agreed it was definitely the cheesiest caesar salad we'd ever eaten. That's not a bad thing, mind you. It was good, just different. The pasta, though, wasn't quite up to standard. Essentially, my husband and I each ordered a different pasta dish. Both of us felt that there perhaps wasn't quite enough seafood to justify the $25 price, but by far the worse offense was that it was undersalted. All fresh seafood and pasta really need are enough salt and a touch of acidity to be fantastic. The pasta needed pretty much the entire dish of Parmesan cheese the waitress kindly left at the table and the lemon from my brother's plate to be good - but then it most definitely WAS good.\n\nI also got to try the clam chowder and crab sandwich - both good - and having classic good sourdough bread with salted butter before the meal (okay and after the meal) always puts me in a good mood.\n\nAmbiance was nice, pleasant, decent view. The only real problem was that the bright light from the lamp on the dock outside was distracting, but that wasn't the fault of the restaurant. High prices aside, I really think this could be a five-star place if the seasoning of the dishes was correct.", "author": "Amanda P."}

The second floor view overlooks the docks and the street, and the interior decor is by no means shabby at all, so I thought it would be a pretty safe choice. \n\nFood is average to above average depending on what you order. I spent $26 on grilled petrale served over rice pilaf. It actually tasted pretty decent. Considering that the street vendors downstairs will charge you $8-12 on one item easily, it's not too far of a reach to spend $26 on anything on the wharf. \n\nWhat I didn't expect was how bad the service was. The service simply did not match the restaurant environment, the food it served, or the prices they wanted. We had an older lady as our server, and she would just disappear for long periods of time. We spent about a combined hour waiting for her to take our orders and serve the food. Good thing we're tourists and not short on time at all. \n\nWhen the bill came, she was bold enough to do the math for us and figure out what  the 17% gratuity was for our party of six. She even went as far as drawing one of the most awkward looking happy faces on the receipt that I have ever seen in my life. Even though the service was pretty poor, we felt bad for her and just gave her the 17%. \n\nIf you pay a visit here, I hope your server isn't her.", "author": "Warren C."}

However, today was the worst experience ever. We were seated after waiting30 minutes--even though the restaurant we nowhere near full. But, okay...it was a holiday night (even though we arrived at about 8 pm). Next, we sat at our table without any waters or acknowledgement from any of the servers for a good 15 minutes. Luckily I made eye contact with the a busboy who came over to ask if I had any questions. I told him that we were hungry and ready to order. He went to let our server know and he promptly arrived. He informed us that they were out of all the fish, except for halibut. They were also out of chicken. Okay...but it would have been nice to know before the long wait. Anyhow, we ended up ordering an appetizer, 2 clam chowder bowls, and entree and a child's meal. We got the child's meal soon after the bread. Great! Since it takes our little guy a long time to eat and he was super hungry. Then comes the second long wait if the night...and boy, did we wait and wait and wait. Our kid was all done before we saw our fish and chips arrive. That was followed by the soups. Okay, at this point might as well forget the appetizer. The clam chowder was lukewarm at best. No crushed pepper was offered. The fish and chips...greasy and flavorless.  The fish consisted of three small pieces--about half the size you normally get at other establishments. The fries were almost burnt. The veggies bland.  Honestly, the best part of the meal was the cold complimentary bread and the spaghetti my son ordered. Oh, and never mind the wait for the check...that's another story.  But, in all fairness, I must point out that the waiter was very nice.", "author": "Rubi C."}

He said he would put us by the window, which I told him i was hoping we could get (my dad is ALL about the view) Great!! Things are looking good. \nSaturday we get to the restaurant about 10 minutes before our reservation. The bottom floor is empty so we go upstairs. We get to the top of the stairs and see the reception stand. No one is there. We stood there for a good 5 minutes (you are standing in the middle of the restaurant, so hard to miss people waiting. Through our whole lunch, i noticed parties come  standing there for long periods not sure what they were supposed to do and were ignored also.) I noticed every window table was full. Waiters and waitresses passed by multiple times. No one acknowledged us. Finally Eric the Bartender comes out. Told him we have a reservation (and PS-we were the ONLY reservation!) and he says \"oh yea, we have your table all ready by the window.\" Except he goes to seat us, and they seated someone in our table. LOVELY. He was going to try to squeeze 2 tables in to get the 6 of us by the window, but we just decided to bag it and sit up top. He tried, but who wants to be squished in between other tables.  The restaurant was not even half full. The only tables that were occupied, were the window seats.  We sat at our table and waited and waited. No waiter, no drinks, nothing. About 15 minutes in, we were getting ready to leave, and Luis showed up as our waiter. Not sure if he was a having a bad day or what. But he was irritated, and seemed bothered that we were there. He took our drink order and left. He came back a little while later and took our lunch order. Once our food came, we never saw him again. Luckily we were close to the bar. Twice I had to go to the bar and get another round of both the cocktails and soda refills. Both times I went up to order, Eric brought all of the drinks to the table since Luis was MIA pretty much the whole time. Our food was nothing to write home about. There was nothing bad, but nothing that stood out as great. I hate to say this, but we have had had better service and food at Hard Rock and Bubba Gumps-both total tourists traps on Pier 39. We expected a lot more from a restaurant that has been in business so many years. With a $350 lunch tab. I would expect a little better service, especially when they weren't busy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-07", "description": "I've been here a few times because I love their Clam Chowder. It's been almost a year since my last visit so this past weekend I decided to go back and get some good food. \n\nI believe the owner was there, an older gentlemen wearing a vest. He was very nice and attentive and seated us (my girlfriend and I) in the corner window with a great view. Knowing what we wanted already we didn't even have to look at the menu. After a few minutes, our waiter showed up. He didn't bother asking if we'd like anything to drink or whether or not we had any questions. He just stood there (granted he was smiling) and waited. So I ordered. I clearly said \"Two clam chowder specials in the sourdough bowl, a prawns and calamari deep-fried, a light beer (I forgot the name), and a rum and coke\". He wrote down our orders and asked if we wanted the calamari first or everything together, to which I said to bring it first.\n\nOur drinks came first. So I was sipping on my rum and coke while waiting for food. When our appetizer came, it was the wrong dish. It was the Calamari Fritti and not the Prawns and Calamari I had ordered. I didn't realize it until the waiter had walked away. So I waited for him to come back or look so I could gesture him over. He never came back or looked. So I waited. And waited. After a few minutes, another waiter came by with water for us so I let him know that it was the wrong order. He said he would go find our waiter and correct it. So we waited again. After a few minutes, I didn't see anyone come by, but luckily, our waiter happened to be near so I waved him down and let him know about the dish.\n\nWithout hesitation, he says to me \"You ordered the Calamari\". I was still in a good mood so I laughed and said \"I actually ordered the Prawns and Calamari\" then apologized for the inconvenience. He took our order back. After a few minutes he came back with our same exact dish and four prawns. I'm not entirely sure why he had to take our dish back for four prawns when he could've just brought out the prawns. It was delicious, either way. We ate it and enjoyed our drinks while chatting.\n\nI started noticing a few new customers getting seated and getting their orders taken. I realized it had been awhile since we've ordered and yet we still haven't gotten our food. So I waited for my waiter to come by. He walked right by us four times and spent two of those times making small talk with another table. Not once did he stop to ask how we were doing or to update us on our order. Then I saw that the people who sat way after us, had already received their food: a few sandwiches, some soup, and other entrees. \n\nOn his fifth (or sixth, I lost track after the first couple times) around us, I was able to wave him down. I asked him \"How much longer will it be for our food?\" to which he replied that it was coming. I told him that it's been a long time for chowder and instead of trying to alleviate the situation, he just says \"would you like to cancel? I cancel if you want but it's done. Would you like to cancel?\" \n\nThe ONLY thing he could think of doing was offer to cancel my meal. I was outraged! He didn't even bother to stall by saying \"Let me go check.\" Then he added that it was due to my sending back the calamari dish which delayed my chowder bowls. I was appalled that he was blaming the customer. I'm not saying as a customer I should have been treated as royalty, but to say it was my fault for my food being delayed, that was just completely insulting. I was super pissed. I just told him to bring my food.\n\nHe quickly hopped into the kitchen and all of a sudden it was there. He dropped it off on our table and walked off without saying anything. He came back with black pepper then disappeared again. After we were done, he quickly came by with my check and dropped it off. Luckily I was already ready to leave. So I paid it, grabbed my things, and walked off. I passed him on my way out and he didn't even bother to say anything. No \"thank you for coming\" as a gesture since he was a representative of the restaurant.

We had a 1:30 lunch reservation and requested a table by the window with a view of the bay. We were told that wouldn't be a problem. When we arrived they had customers but they weren't super busy. We were told we were the only ones with a reservation however, all of the walk-ins were given the window seats and there weren't any available. They sat us up on a second level, still a good view, but not what we asked for. We were seated and waited a good 15-20 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. Finally Eric the bartender came over and hooked us up with drinks. He actually gave us better service than our waiter.

Service was a bit abrupt and sloppy, but efficient so I'll overlook it, but if you're here on vacation or trying to impress someone my guess is that you'd be unimpressed.  The bf ordered the half crab and cup of clam chowder while I ordered the sand dabs. Each entree was $15 which seemed decent given the tourist trap location.\n\nClam chowder cup was small but the flavor was decent in my book. I wouldn't be surprised if it was can-based though.  It lacked the chunkiness and hot temperature that desire from my clam chowder. I'm allergic to crab so I can't really review that but the bf said it was decent - not bad, but nothing to write home about either - for $15 it's a wash.\n\nThe sand dabs were pretty good. It was my first time eating them and I enjoyed them a decent amount. They came with some nice and buttery roasted yukon gold potatoes and some really mediocre over-buttered and over-boiled green beans, broccoli and carrots. I was disappointed to receive a plate of fried sand dabs instead of lightly grilled like the menu promised but the sauce was tasty and fattening enough to make me say \"Eff it, when on the wharf eat like you're on vacation\" and overlook the friedness. There were some bones but I wasn't expecting perfection from the place.\n\nAll in all, not a terrible experience but also not one that I want to replicate ever again.", "author": "Krystle S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-28", "description": "My experience at Tarantino's was incredible (which you can't spell without edible). My rating is based on a combination- lunch + entertainment. First, the lunch:\n\nI was craving crab cakes, while my friend was craving a clam chowder bread bowl. Tarantino's had both; each was on special this fine day. We wanted a view of the water, but most of the window seats were taken. We decided on a window seat that was above the sidewalk, but still offered a good view.\n\nWith your drinks the waiter give's you some cold bread, and even colder butter, which is virtually impossible to spread. But that was easily overlooked once the meal was served. For $12.50 I got two crab cakes (maybe 2 oz each) with a mango salsa, a small salad with house dressing, and a cup of chowder.\n\nThe crab cakes were scrumptious. The sauce that they were served with was very complimentary. The mango salsa was pretty good as well. The house dressing on the mixed greens was very tasty. The clam chowder was one of the best that I have had. In all fairness, Im not a huge clam chowder fan, and dont normally order it, but I was glad I did this time. For the price, this was an incredible deal.\n\nNow for the entertainment:\n\nI happened to stumble upon Tarantino's in passing by, I did not yelp it.  So I was unaware of the possibility of watching the bush man at work. We walked passed him from behind on the way to the restaurant. At first I thought he was making something out of the bushes?? I didn't know what his deal was, I had never heard of him.\n\nLucky for us we had constant amusement from this guy. It never got old. We forgot that there was also a beautiful view of the harbor and Alcatraz there as well. Who needs that, when you can witness masses of mid-westerners urinating their trousers in public? It was priceless. Unfortunately the Bush Man left just as we were getting our check, so I was unable to go down and tip him. This was one of my greatest restaurant experiences. \n\nJust a note, Karma got me later in the day. \n\nThe Bush Mans nemesis (a  former partner and fellow frightener, I learned after researching) scared me a few hours later. But in my defense, this guy kind of cheats. The brilliance of The Bush Man was that he just slightly thrusts the shrubbery at his targets to scare them. This knock-off, jumps up and yells right in your face, so of course you are going to be caught off guard. \n\nThats why I jumped and screamed like a little girl... And the fact that my parents were murdered by a bullying brier when I was a young lad. \n\nIf you see The Bush Man at work and you are hungry, rush to the second floor of Tarantino's and grab a window seat.", "author": "Chris G."}

We entered Tarantino's after seeing it had good reviews on Yelp and were invited to sit at a nice table over looking some boats on the pier.  There was a faint musky/moldy smell that a lot of ocean-side places seem to manifest so I ignored it.   As soon as we saw the daily specials menu was laminated we probably should have left (catch-of-the-day places usually have paper menus that are printed out that morning with whatever was obtained for sale), but I wanted to give them a chance so we stayed and spoke with our waitress.  I asked her about several of the menu items, and to each she replied that they were frozen. In a last ditch effort I inquired about the crab, whose price was listed only as \"market price\", which I assumed was the fresh crab price of the day -- I was wrong and I felt the menu was misleading.  I was informed that their crab was 3-weeks frozen.\n\nI thanked the waitress for her time, tipped her 5 dollars and we left.", "author": "Nate D."}

Unfortunately, this place was terrible. We walked around the Wharf reviewing menus before selecting this restaurant. Tarantino's has been around since I was a small girl visiting SF in the 70's, so we decided to give it a try again. I really wanted oysters, since we live in Phoenix, AZ and never get fresh fish there. The oysters were awful. Two oysters had nothing in them. Just a membrane. The others were so small, it barely seemed like oysters. Our tilapia dinners were just okay. Nothing outstanding, like the price would suggest. Actually, we've had better in Phoenix, AZ. \n\nAfter several hours, I began feeling sick. I dismissed it as being overtired, but soon I was vomiting and feeling faint. Once back in our hotel, I became even sicker. My husband wasn't sick, so we determined that it must be the oysters I had earlier. I was the only person who ate the oysters. I had food positioning from those awful oysters. Overall, our fish dinner was a complete disappointment.

We had to see Fisherman's Wharf before we left!\n\nOut of all the loud looking, touristy neon-d out spots we passed, this one seemed more calm and inviting. \n\nIt was a weeknight and not very crowded at all. Which is good, seeing it means a more quiet dinner and hopefully more attentive service. \nIt was funny because as we were walking in there was a couple leaving and the girl was saying something like \"it's too fancy, let's go somewhere else\". LOL, it's not fancy. Matter of fact, it looks like the place has probably been the same way for at least 15yrs.. and I mean that in a good nostalgic way. Just for the classic old school family feel this restaurant has going on, I give it a star :) \n\nService was friendly and not in an overbearing way. We were promptly seated and within a minute we had a bread basket and our drink orders were taken. \n\nThe bread was nothing special.. at all. It was actually pretty dry.. oh well.\n\nI wasn't very hungry so I just ordered a glass of pinot grigio and the clam chowder. The wine was good enough and luckily didn't taste like it had been opened very long, as some wines by the glass can. The clam chowder was tasty, but could have been thicker. There were plenty of clams in it and luckily not too many potatoes, and the chowder gave the table bread a use, seeing it didn't come with crackers. \n\nMy daughter ordered the clams and it was quite a huge serving. She's really picky, so seeing she had a fairly large amount of empty shells by the end of her meal I'm guessing it was really good.\n\nMy friend got their \"specialty\" which is whole dungeness crab. While he finished it, the process of cracking the shells and getting the meat out took for-ev-er and I'm sure he was tired and over it by meals end. He said it was very good tho. I only eat lump or split crab legs myself, because I don't have the patience to do all that cracking and picking.. blah! \n\nThe view is really pretty from the restaurant. We were seated right by the windows and it's a lovely view of the harbor and at the right time of day the sunset is gorgeous! \n\nIf I found myself in Fisherman's Wharf again, I would probably try out Tarantino's a second time. Hopefully, I'd have a bigger appetite next time so I could try out more of their food and maybe something from their cocktail menu. It wasn't anything fancy, but it was a comfy laid back spot with tasty food and friendly service..can't frown on that :)\n\nOh, if you find yourself there...

There were five of us.  The greeter at the bottom of the stairs was very inviting, friendly, and ultimately, helped make our decision to go upstairs and have lunch.  Prices ranged from reasonable (about $15 for in-season crab) to ridiculous ($24 for salmon.  really.), but we figured we could all find something on the menu.\n\nWe arrived upstairs, and the host was nowhere, and of course, no sign to indicate seating directions.  He appeared, looked at us like we were trash, and was about to leave, when one in the group asked, \"Do we seat ourselves?\"  He responded, \"No,\" and then snarled at us.  He did not ask for our party count or a name, I pretty much had to force it upon him.  The wait was short, between 5-10 minutes, and we blew his attitude off, because the place smelled fantastic.\n\nAs the host sat us, I thanked him, and his response was to stare at me and snarl again.  RUDE.  The table was designed for 6, but only had 4 bread plates and 2 butter knives.  We had to ask for knives, we were given just 1 more, so 3 knives for 5 people.  A 5th plate never showed  up.\n\nStill, we were optimistic.  The menu looked great.  Two in our party split calamari, and said it was great, aside from the tentacle pieces being included.  The two that had the clam chowder said it was great as well.\n\nThen our meals came.  I had Fettuccine Carbonara and a friend had Seafood Fettuccine.  Both looked great, but the sauce on each had no taste whatsoever.  Salt and pepper (which we also had to ask for) did not help.  I ate the pasta for substance, and left the extra sauce, without even considering dipping bread in it.  Another friend ordered shrimp cocktail, and instead of the jumbo shrimp draped over the side of a glass of cocktail sauce, it was a mountain of baby bay shrimp, quality similar to that you find at Walmart (maybe worse).  The kitchen was so bad at flavoring food that even the Chicken Parmesan sandwich had no taste.  The friend who had clam chowder and salad was lucky, as almost no one can mess up greens.  \n\nOur waiter was nice, but not good at his job.  At all.  He visited our table 3 times, came and filled up one water glass and never returned to fill the other 4.  We sat, finished, for 10 minutes, before I had to ask him to bring the check.  He then shorted one of us (prob. not on purpose, to be fair) with her change.  He needed a course of Serving 101.\n\nIf this was the last place to eat on Earth, I would rather die.

With much cheaper prices. For eg the crab was $11 per pound for the outdoor menu, but in the restaurant it was $30 for a whole crab which was def smaller than usual. \n\nThe food was meh. Portions are way small. Bread was tough like a rock. Crab was below average - it tasted like crab, but there was no wow factor. Ravioli was a really small bowl. Clam chowder was not good. Fish and chips consisted of a handful of small fries and three small pieces of fish. \n\nIf you're looking for crab, don't come here. I've had way better crab at cheaper prices. There was a pretty okay view of the pier but that's about it.", "author": "Annette L."}

Felt like we (40-somethings) were the youngest couple around at 12:30....The service was awful (as in we left a less than 15% tip), the food less than stunning, and somewhat spendy, though maybe that's the deal for the Wharf.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "Sex with a tourist is said to have (not that I know from experience) the potential to be the best sex there is. It's simple human nature to \"hold back\" in fear of judgment. BUT if you're never going to see that person again, one may go \"balls to the walls\" (not sure if I need the quotations) for that one night, and one night only. It may give a person a chance to try the wilder, more passionate, maybe even more hardcore elements that could amount to pleasure. It's like if you knew you only had one more night to live, you would do all the things that would cause you pure Ecstasy but never had the guts to try. \n\nOR.... (not that I know) the guy may just pass out 8 minutes later and your lucky if he will wake up again at all... and your left wondering if you have a dead body on your hands, trying to remember if he was on anything other than booze, wondering if women too get conjugal visits and whether or not his family would ship his body back to his home country or just have him cremated. \n\nTourist restaurants are like the latter. They are not trying to overly please a single person but themselves. I mean they don't want to go out of business or anything but they are really not trying too hard. They know you will never be back anyway. The hardest part (in both scenarios) is already over once you're hungry (or drunk) and in the door. Unfortunately, just like a man's looks, the view from a restaurant makes other things bearable, if not unnoticeable. A lot of the reviews for this place are tourists raving about the food. I get it but I don't trust it. You would have to be a major bitch to be sitting at a bay side restaurant on the coast of California, miles and miles away from the farm, and be complaining about the place. \n\nSo why, having lived in San Francisco for 5 years, would I come to a tourist restaurant knowing the food won't be that great? I'm not really at liberty to say, but I went. I will admit the view was quite enjoyable to look at; this place was definitely not a grenade. \n\nI ordered the \"Bay Shrimp and Avocado Salad\". The waiter came back informing me they were out of avocado. He did not really offer me anything else, it was just more like a \"hey just to let you know, there will not be any\". I was a bit disappointed. Let me make it clear that this was not a bay shrimp salad WITH avocado, it clearly said \"AND\". It implied both equal parts shrimp and avocado. I was looking forward to the avocado. I love avocado. I was still polite. \n\nWhen he came back I asked, nicely, if since my (16 dollar) bay shrimp and avocado salad does not have the avocado could I get beer? I wasn't asking for a new meal, or a discount on what was surely to be a disappointment, just a beer. The waiter told me and I quote \"uhh, hold on let me ask the bartender, he's the boss\". I smile politely. \n\nThe waiter came back after some time. Substantially longer than what it would take to ask the question during what appeared to be an extremely slow dining hour. \n\nWaiter: Yes. He said that would be fine.... a bottled beer. \n\nhmmm. A bottled beer. Sure. Cheap, but sure. One time my friend was at a bar and a guy asked to buy her a drink. She accepted and he ordered their drinks. Then he turned to her after fumbling with his money and asked her for 2 dollars... and still tried chatting her up. This bottled beer gesture was somehow worse. Maybe not as desperate, but definitely more pathetic.\n\nSo, I guess you can try your luck here if you're single and it's tourist season.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

Sure it's touristy and yes, the tables are so close together you can smell the food (and/or body odor) of the people sitting next to you, but where else can you eat while watching the homeless \"bush man\" scare the shit out of people as they walk by?  That's a huge plus.  Especially if you hate your company.  Which I did not.  She reads these.  : )\n\nAnyways, the lunch specials are pretty reasonable.

They have a stand that sells their clam chowder, fried shrimp, chips and stuff but i like going inside the restaurant because the Fishermans Wharf tends to get very crowded and its hard to find a place to sit and enjoy our food. They give you complimentary sourdough bread with butter, a nice view of the pier, the most delicious clam chowder i've ever eaten and if you're lucky you get to see Bush Man in action! I would opt for a regular bowl because they dont really dig the bread bowl too deep so you don't get enough clam chowder. I have tired their crab and i think its mediocre, nothing too special to rave about. They validate your parking for up to 2 hours so even though it may be a few bucks cheaper to just eat clam chowder out at one of the stands, it beats paying the $12 parking. =)", "author": "Trang T."}

The cups of chowder were small but REALLY good, i loved the fresh thyme flavor, not too many potatoes and big tender chunks of clams. The salad was good, nothing to write home about, wasn't crazy about the dressing it came with (an emulsified vinaigrette). The fish portion was small, 3 small pieces but they were good, light crispy coating, well seasoned. These are my qualms: the coke was low on syrup so it was mostly soda water and there's no free refills, and secondly my stepdad got the bread bowl of chowder and it was filled almost an inch shy of the top of the smallish bread bowl with soup. I felt like telling the server to have another ladle put in. I really wish I had actually.

I guess I'll do this one pros/cons style:\n\nPros:\n\n- Pretty good panoramic view of the wharf from second floor. The closest things are a lot of boats and restaurants, yes, but it's still a scenic view. It was quiet too.\n- Good dungeness crab sandwich. This was my time eating a crab sandwich anywhere, and I really liked it. The crab flavor really comes through, There is not too much sauce, the ciabatta bread complements with its ubiquitous flavor and with a crunchy texture, and the lettuce and tomatoes are nice. I felt that there was plenty of crab to eat too.\n- Pretty good shoestring french fries. Not great, but pretty good.\n- According to one member of the party, the burger with cheese was good.\n\n\"Meh\"s:\n\n- Sourdough bread (served immediately), shrimp salad w/ clam chowder, and greek salad with calamari steak were kinda average.\n- I had to take care to avoid tainting the crab flavor with the fries. I don't think fries are something you want to have in your mouth while you're enjoying the crab. The fries were truly a side dish, not a complimentary accompaniment.\n\nCons:\n\n- Pricey. $15 or so for the sandwich, about $10 for each of the other dishes that we had. And judging from a quick glance at the right-hand side of the menu, if you want some pure seafood helpings, your pocketbook will take a licking.\n- I was not entirely happy with how long it took for the food to arrive. We were strapped for time with the parking garage, and it must've taken at least 15 minutes. Yes, it was somewhat busy because it was a holiday, and I may be biased, but this was my impression.\n- Speaking of parking, I really was not happy that they advertised validation for parking but then told us that they only validated for a different parking garage than the one at which we parked. We were at that one that starts with an \"A\" (forgot the name) and had to drop by Starbucks later to buy something for validation. This was actually because one of the Tarantino's employees was nice enough to suggest it, so I guess I won't hold this against them too much.\n- Men's bathroom was cramped and was certainly not on par with the restaurant's decor, but at least it didn't look filthy or smell unclean.\n\nBasically giving it 3 stars because I liked my crab sandwich experience and the atmosphere.

So with a hearty \"whatever\" I agreed to try out Tarantino's with some friends for a catch up on life meal.\n\nLocated along the waterfront, the dining room upstairs has a fantastic quintessential San Francisco view of the docks and if the fog cooperates, the Golden Gate bridge. The atmosphere in the dining room is casual enough to get away with jeans but not if you're pulling a People of Walmart look. The service was ok, nothing spectacular but not notably bad either. During the day out front I recall that they do sidewalk seating and serve all the standards that Fisherman's Wharf is known for (clam chowder in a bread bowl, crab, shrimp or crab salad sandwiches, calamari, you get the drill).\n\nBut back to dinner, I had shrimp and scallop alfredo that was rich in texture but honestly, lacking in flavor. The shrimp in the dish were ok but not great. The scallops were small but sweet. The sauce just tasted heavy which was fine because I needed a comfort food moment but nothing I would crave or have a longing for. One friend ordered a plain casaer salad (I don't know why) and the other ordered calamari. Both said their meals were fine but no one was raving about their dishes.

Yes, the setting was nice, as well as the server, but unfortunately the service was not up to par.  For example, we had to ask for refills (which took much longer than it should have) and ask for our check (after waiting at least 10 minutes when it was clear we were ready to leave).  I'm also fairly certain my fish 'n chips came from a frozen bag of salt.  Some of the worst fish I've ever had before.  The clam chowder was flavorful but too thick for my liking.  Other people in my party ordered the seafood platter (apparently the scallops were very good, but nothing else from this dish), fresh oysters on the half shell (very mediocre at best),  sandabs (good), trout (\"bland\"), and seafood pasta (shrimp was rubbery and overcooked).  This place was also very expensive and not worth it at all.  We were all very disappointed.  :-(", "author": "Nikolette C."}

We had half a crab for $20, split an order of mussels (without pasta in a tomato sauce - very tasty) and enjoyed the wine and the view. \nTarantino's is an old San Francisco restaurant frequented by a lot of old San Franciscans who prefer exceptional, classic seafood to the modern out of the box formulaic concrete walled hot spots with lots of kale. \nThe seafood is so good because they have their own fishing fleets. The room is dated enough to be nearly back in style, the chairs are comfortable and the view is spectacular. Small but good wine list, classic drinks.  I have read the service is bad - ours was chaotic two days after Christmas and delightful The busboy apologized that more bread would take four minutes, then brought it almost immediately.  (which is fine, because that is what it is). Let's say it's informal.  \nA caution: Tarantino's does not subscribe to Open Table (they don't need it, as you will see from your reserved window seat, while fifteen or so walk ins wait hopefully  for your table, which they won't get because it's reserved - smart you) so clicking on the link  driving people to Open table will bring up only suggestions for restaurants which do subscribe.

I was slightly concerned by the smell of musty carpeting on my way up to the dining room, but stayed to enjoy the view. \n\nA very small wine list and slightly overpriced menu were offset by the fresh and briney oysters on the half shell that started our meal (which, with a dash of cocktail and Worcestershire sauce, and a bit of horseradish, were the perfect, if not traditional, amuse bouche). \n\nThe rainbow trout was a bit bland, but the shrimp and avocado salad was delightfully light yet satisfying. The chowder looked delicious, but being lactose intolerant, I indulged in only a decadent whiff of the creamy blend.\n\nOverall, considering the attentive service and food, I would definitely consider going back... the food was good, but not unique in any way. Definitely a solid experience, though!", "author": "Doris P."}

Among our orders were 4 surf-and-turf dinners, 1 NY steak, 1 Ravioli, and two Rainbow Trout.  \n\nFor the 5 steaks, we ordered 4 medium and 1 medium rare.  When they arrived, they were all well done.  We told the waiter (who we had to call over as he never checked on us after the meals were served, nor did he ask about drink refills at all during our time there til nearly the end).\n\nThe steaks were sent back and replaced..... and while they were SOMEWHAT cooked more to order, they were still a bit over cooked and very bland.  We didn't eat them.\n\nThe trout was good.  The ravioli was good.  The lobster portion of the surf and turf meals was excellent.\n\nI spoke to the Manager about our experience, and the saving grace of the evening - so to speak - was that he comped us our surf-and-turf meals.  More than I anticipated in compensation for the steak fiasco.\n\nI'd be willing to give Tarantino's another chance just on the manager's actions alone.  Maybe it was a bad night for the chef?  I don't know.  Other tables we observed sent back items like cold soup and such.\n\nRecommendations - more attentive wait staff (especially when the dining area only is 1/3 full) and a chef who doesn't overcook a steak.\n\nMany thanks to the Manager for understanding and doing right by us on the bill.

The flavor was distinct and the texture was perfect.   The fish and chips, on the other hand, was horrible.  The chips tasted of fish in a bad way.  It's obvious both are fried in the same grease, and the result is fish tinged fries. While they pair wonderfully, one should not taste of the other, in my humble opinion.  The fish filet was huge, and the meat was tender, however the crust, as I will call it, as it is not worthy of being called batter, was overly cooked, too thin, and lacked any rich flavor.  The best way to describe it would be a  large filet of fish from McDonalds. Gross.  \n\nPrice: The price point was spot on. I felt like I was stealing the clam chowder, due to its quality.  However, you couldn't pay me to eat the fish again.  \n\nInsider Tip: They serve draft beer, curbside.  Pretty cool.

Our server was really nice and friendly (no 'tude).  For apps, we had fried calamari and shrimp, and crabcakes.  The calamari and shrimp was plain good fried fun.  I didn't try the crabcakes, but my uncle was all over it.  For my main, I had the pan seared scallops.  It was served with rice and fresh steamed veggies.  The scallops were drenched in butter and mushrooms.  I prefer my scallops served \"clean\" if you know what I mean.  Let the scallop shine, not be covered up by sauces, etc.  Portions were pretty hefty.  For dessert I had the carrot cake, which was a bit cold, but still very good.  \n\nOverall, I thought this restaurant was pretty good.  Nice ambiance, and they valedate parking, btw.", "author": "Sarah F."}

The mussels and angel hair were delicious (and it came with about a million mussels, which was great and unexpected). The view was nice, and the restaurant was not at all crowded for its location.

This restaurant was chosen based on three important factors:  \na) proximity to when we became ravenous\nb) need to escape the now crowded streets near Fisherman's Wharf \nc) low prices that could allow us to later support various other parts of the tourist industry in SF    \n\nThe hostess seemed unfazed by our touristy uniforms.  We were clad in running pants, sneakers, and hoodies, and had camera slung over our necks, ready to capture some Kodak moments.  I thought she might hide us in a corner, as not to scare off any other customers, but instead, we were seated upstairs and had a beautiful view of the harbor.  Feeling frugal, we all ordered off the lunch special's menu, and had either fish and chips or the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl (both for under $10).  Apparently the clam chowder was excellent.  My fish and chips were minimally edible.  The \"fish\" was encased in a nearly bulletproof shell of thick enamel fracturing breading.  Years of regular dentist checkups and regular masseter exercises did not suffice in allowing me to break through, so I took cues from nearby seagulls.  I simply brought the fish up to the roof and dropped in onto the pavement far below, careful to avoid any tourists or homeless people.  Once it was cracked open, I was able to \"enjoy\" the meaty innards.  The effort was for naught, as the inside was dry and flaky and somewhat malodorous.  Against any good judgment, I took a bite, and one was all I could stomach.\n\nFood aside, the service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable (especially from the lunch menu).  The view here is beautiful and if you get the right seat, you can have a behind the scenes look at the bush man scaring tourists.  Just be careful you are not eating soup or drinking during this time, as you might get your neighbor's Alcatraz sweatshirt wet.", "author": "Heather F."}

The ravioli appetizer is delish with aldentae skin and a perfect cheese filling.  The crab appetizer is to die for with big pieces of meat and a little lemon sprinkled over.  The seafood feticini Tarantino is what my cousin and I both decided on with big succulent prawns, baby scallops, garlic, cream, and a little Parmesan over aldentae noodles.

A bunch of friends and I had been there for lunch a year ago and Siobhan was our waitress.  She was funny, helpful and truly professional.  We all chatted quit a bit and thoroughly enjoyed having her as our waitress.  A year later, my friends and I did our yearly trip to San Francisco and once again went to Tarantino's.  As luck would have it, we got Siobhan again.  We never expected her to remember us, we were just glad and nostalgic that we got the same waitress.  We were totally surprised that she not only remembered our names but alot of what our conversation had been the previous year.  We were blown away.  Thank you Siobhan for your great service, wonderful personality and delightful accent.  We'll be back next year.    (Oh and the food was great too!)", "author": "Maria Aida C."}

Was invited by friends for what ended up being a very tasty meal with a server who was fun, attentive and kept us good company (we just missed the dinner rush with a 9PM start). \n\nHighlights were the cioppino, which we are still was thinking about two days later. It came in a way yummy base and with seafood that was well-prepared to match (they were out of mussels, and the extra clams to compensate were just fine). Also, I had to try the calamari steak, which I can't remember how I ordered (server's recommendation, whatever it was). It had a great texture and flavor, served up with vegetables. A very good meal, all in all. Sure, it's Fisherman's Wharf, so expect to pay some money for this (I would say this is a \"3-$\" spot, not 2, and almost rated this a three based soley on the prices, but it's about the food for me, overall. Perhaps it's cheaper for lunch?)\n\nLet me close by saying the boston clam chowder -- while not of the heartier consistency I affiliate with \"good\" chowder -- was freaking fantastic! Only a ordered a cup and wish it'd been a bowl. I ordered it in a non-bread bowl, too, which I guess is for the best given the other bread bowl reviews I've been reading. Next time I'm in the hood, I plan to stop by for a bowl to go at the very least.\n\nWe also all shared this decadent chocolate-caramel cake dessert that was good and gooey. \n\nGood times.", "author": "Mark P."}

Tarantino's met the bill.  Actually, I'm not a big clam chowder fan, but this was one of the best chowders I've ever had -- rich and creamy, with definite bay and thyme flavors, and large pieces of clam and potato.  (My experience with clam chowder tends to run to milky glop with a fishy taste and lumps of unidentifiable chewy stuff, so my standards may not be too high)  \n\nThe prices inside the restaurant were a little higher -- $8 or so for the same bread and chowder you could buy at their sidewalk stand for $5, but it came with a small side salad of mixed greens and tomatoes.  After hiking all morning at Alcatraz, it was worth an extra $3 to sit down in a relaxing place and have someone to refill your drink.\n\nService was a little slow -- especially at lunch you think they'd want to turn the tables over a little more quickly.  But nice view -- overall I'd recommend it if you're in the area.", "author": "Stacey M."}

The edges of the oysters were dried and water was used in attempts to rehydrate the oysters. Also, the shucker did not losen up the oyster to make it easier on the customer to eat it. \n(b) Calamari - I ordered this based on yelp reviews, I was disappointed. The calamari was completely overcooked, it was rubbery, way too rubbery. Also, the batter around the calamari looked like it was some type of KFC recipe, the batter was thick, heavy and held in all the oil used to deep fry them. Also, it appeared that some of the calamari looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp for an hour or so because it looked dried out (even w/ all that oil). \n(c) Pertole - this meal started out strong, meaning, it looked good. It came with the fish, deep fried, fingerling potatoes and veggies. The only thing on this plate that was decent were the veggies only because all they had to do was \"steam\" them. The problem w/ the fish was the fact that when you added the cream sauce, it completely ruined the entire texture of the deep fried fish. The chefs do not understand food like a chef should, rather they seem like complete amateurs, not only because of this but the terrible sauce that accompanied the fish. The sauce was some type of thin and bland cream sauce, by itself, it tasted like warm cream w/ (very little) salt. The chef attempted to use capers to bridge the saltiness that was needed in the sauce but you don't rely on a caper to make a good sauce for something that will, overall, ruin the quality/texture of the main entree. The fingerling potatoes were extremely STALE - again, this tasted like it was under a heat lap for hours.", "author": "alex l."}

The Belevedere Martini was wonderful, the jumbo prawn cocktail was excellent as well, but $15.00.  The 2 lobster tail dinner was under cooked, and very expensive but alas, even though it is in desperate need of remodeling, and very expensive, location location location.

We went early in the evening to this restaurant just to have a nice appetizer and watch the sunset. It was great. The crab was succulent and the view of the ocean and the boats during the sunset was very nice. The service was good as well.", "author": "Erin S."}

By the time the main courses are brought out. We just wanted to eat our dishes and got out. I ordered the Salmon, and my date ordered the Calamari Steak.  The Calamari Steak is suck.

Many many Moons ago, in a San Francisco far far away, when the Haight was just revving up, and we still dove under our school desks to protect ourselves from Nuclear Attacks,  some decent hard working folks, (my parents) took their smart ass jackass kid, (me), and their angelic daughter (my sister) to Fisherman's Wharf for the day for some family fun.  When it came time to Eat my parents insisted we go to Tarantino's.  I was really pissed, because I wanted a Hamburger.  Anyway, we went, sat down and ordered.  I wanted a Hamburger, however, my mother, (bless her soul), decided I was going to have Salmon.  We argued, the chef overheard and came out.  He promised me that if I tried his salmon, and did not like it, I could have a hamburger.  Such a deal!!  He sent out the salmon lunch.  It was the best food I had ever had.  (Sorry Mom)!!  Even now in Alaska, I remember that salmon, and prepare mine the same way.  I was hooked on Tarantino's from that point on.  Fast Forward many many Moons.  First Mom passed, then Dad.  They wanted to be returned to their \"city\".  As you can read Neptune Society helped us accomplish this.  My sister and I thought we would have a memorial dinner for them, before the scattering and placement of the ashes.  We notified their friends here in Alaska, and low and behold 20 couples showed up.  Anyway, for the dinner we decided would be held at Tarantino's.  I called their management, and explained the situation to them, the amount of people, and what we needed.  The night of the dinner when we arrived at Tarantino's, one would of thought we were all royalty.  Tarantino's pulled out all the stops.  The dinner, the wines, the attention to detail, impeccable.  God Bless Tarantino's.  Go try it everybody.  It is worth every penny.  My recommendation....The salmon.", "author": "John P."}

We were afraid of the wharf restaurants, cuz they can be super expensive or super cheezy and we didn't want to smell the seals nearby as we were eating our food, besides it was a little chilly and we were wearing shorts. \nWe noticed Tarantino's and really were a little nervous as we walked upstairs to a beautiful view of the wharf with the golden gate bridge in the background.  It looked expensive, but noticed that the lunch meal of the day was affordable to us (we are usually cheapskates!), but the clam chower in a sourdough bowl along with salad with bay shimp on the side was simply a dish we couldn't pass up (price was 8.98).\nWe sat at a window view table and was greeted by \"Bella\" a very nice and friendly waitress who made us feel comfortable and sat us at a great table. \nOur eyes looked onward toward the view of the wharf and the bridge and the birds flying by, we were treated with great kindness and were served promptly. The food was delicious!\nWe will definately check this place out in the near future, and will most likely save our pennies for the dinner dishes!", "author": "Rick B."}
