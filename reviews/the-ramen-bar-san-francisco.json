The restaurant is \"fast casual\" as you wait in line to order, take a number, and they bring your food to wherever you're seated. \n\nThe menu is fairly small and is nothing extravagant but covers all the bases for your ramen cravings. I had the taitan, pork and chicken broth based, served with pork, bamboo, and soft boiled egg. The broth had good flavor, but probably could've also been richer. I was really wanting that richness you find in tonkotsu ramen. My biggest complaint that the broth was also only warm, could've been hotter. \n\nOverall, decent place for lunch, but would be on the search if you're wanting something more authentic.", "author": "Lynn C."}

I came here in the past out of convenience and got forgettable ramen. The next time I came I got the karaage happy hour appetizer for $7, which only came with 4 TINY pieces of chicken. It'd be one thing if they were 4 normal sized karaage pieces but they were the size of popcorn chicken! It even tasted like the popcorn chicken you'd get from a Quickly's. In fact, I probably would have preferred Quickly's over this. \n\nIt was pretty laughable and I honestly thought I might have offended the waitress somehow to warrant such a small amount. \n\nWhatever the case, this place is a rip-off and exploiting their convenient location and the Michael Mina brand.", "author": "Danielle C."}

I've definitely had my fair share of ramen and overall, this spot was okay for taste but pretty expensive as well. We decided on Ramen Bar since it was close to the office and my friend was really craving some soup. \n\nThe base price for the ramen was $14 and you could add additional toppings for an additional charge. The pork chashu was tender for the 2-3 small pieces that you get. The egg was actually cooked surprisingly well and had the soft inside that you look for. The bamboo was actually a bit odd for me since it was far softer than usual and actually a bit sweet. Usually i like the menma (bamboo shoots) to have more of a bite instead of dissolving in your mouth. The noodles were pretty standard and the broth was average as well. Essentially an average bowl of ramen with no frills or fireworks. \n\nProbably won't go again since the price point was a bit high for an okay bowl of ramen.", "author": "Eric L."}

The best way I can describe this meal is...this would be the type of ramen I would make at home if I threw random things in together.\n\nMeh, I've had better. I got the Hokkaido ramen and the soup base was alright, thick, slightly spicy, but nothing spectacular. They give you a LOT of noodles, but not much else, but I guess that's how ramen tends to be. Noodles were kind of soft. This was paired with arugula-- an interesting choice, although the arugula lacked its usual spicy freshness and was a strange pairing with the ramen. It just wilted in the soup and didn't add anything to it. The bamboo shoots were tender. The chashu was heavy in pork flavor, but not cha siu sauce. The only redeeming thing here was the slow egg, which had a good soy sauce flavor. Yolk could have been a tad more runny. Corn was on the firm side and didn't complement the dish. 2/5.\n\nThe yuzu topped vanilla panna cotta with crunch, on the other hand, is something I would get again. Then again, I'm a fan of yuzu-flavored items. I though the two paired each other quite well. The other dessert I've had from here (can't recall what) was also tasty! 3/5.\n--\n\nEdit: I came back for the poke bowl, and you know, it wasn't half bad. There weren't any options for sauce, so when it arrived, a marinated, somewhat spicy bowl looked me in the face. The salmon was pretty buttery, but I think the taste was masked by the spiciness. The daikon's crispiness was a perfect balance to the oiliness of the salmon. The sumumono was less vinegary than I've had (I like this sorta style too) and the seaweed salad felt more upscale somehow (which is to be expected at a place like this). The nutty brown rice reminded me of the rice at Blue Hawaii. Not a bad poke choice, though I do prefer my fish virgin :P. 3.5/5.", "author": "Nicole H."}

I enjoyed that the noodles were nice and chewy and added plenty of bamboo. I felt that the broth was on the salty side, but that could just be me. For $15 it was a decently priced/filling lunch option in the area. Service is friendly here as well. Even if you order to-go you can sit at one of the tables and they'll still clean your stuff for you. \n\nMy other friends had some of the rolls/poke bowls which they thoroughly enjoyed. Not sure if i'll be a regular here since I can get cheaper & larger portioned alternatives in FiDi, but it's solid for a quick meal.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

I've gotten the shoyu tonkotsu both times and my other friends have had the mushroom&soy and the Hokkaido.

I don't think I'd call it a must when you come here, but it was definitely interesting to try. The Matcha milk wasn't anything extraordinary either.\n\nNevertheless, the food was fairly good overall. A decent bowl of ramen is pretty difficult to come by in the City, so I give extra points to Ramen Bar for doing it better than the others in the area. Plus, it's suuuuper close to the Embarcadero station.", "author": "Sara C."}

Decent for business lunch - though hard to find a seat sometimes:\n\nWhat I've tried:\n- Ginger chicken ramen (~$14): good portions, flavorful broth though could be served a bit more hot.\n- Kale chicken caesar ($13.95): super tasty with the bonito shreds for flavor, the quinoa for a crispy crunch and the thinly sliced kale for the extra healthy mental plus \n- Chicken avocado bowl (~$13): ALSO great, and served with a ton of brown rice. good scoop of avocado and enjoyed the mushrooms\n- Sunomono: acutally a bit more vinegar heavy than other places and IMO not marinated long enough so they're super soft, sweet and crunchy\n\nThe killer combo is mixing the kale chicken caesar with the chicken avocado bowl. It's a money combo. They've also got pearl milk teas if that's your thing, and online ordering.\n\nTLDR: healthy options including grilled chicken breast, salmon, brown rice.

Oh, I'm sure it's organic this and non GMO that but please have some more actual fish in the poke bowl. I mean, it's advertised as a trio and I got it because I wanted the full experience but was severely disappointed.  In terms of taste, my meal was bland because the spicy mayo wasn't spicy.

Average.\n\nGiven its Michael Mina pedigree, you would assume that this would be great. It was great, but just not exactly something to write home about.\n\nThe Ramen Bar is your classy and modern yet hipster-y in vibe ramen shop jam packed in one of the busier districts of San Francisco. You'll see a line out the door filled with men in suits, iPhones out everywhere, and prices through the roof: exactly what you'd expect in any poppin' SF lunch joint.\n\nWith the Michael Mina name, it had high expectations to live up to. I ordered the Hokkaido Ramen and an Earl Grey milk tea, and my only conclusion is that it's really painfully average. No wow factor, besides the fact that it's a decently average bowl of ramen you can grab for slightly above average price in SF.\n\nNot to say I won't be back, but it's a bit pricy for what it is, and it's not exactly the best ramen I've ever had. I'm not going to try to compare it to Japan, but even within the Bay Area, you can get better elsewhere in the bay for a much more affordable price.\n\nIf you're looking for something with a bit more pizazz, I'd recommend heading over to Ramen Shop in Oakland.\n\nI will however note that it's non-ramen options look fantastic, and I've got to give those a chance.\n\nTIP: Skip the milk tea.

For 5:45pm, it wasn't busy. For FIDI, of course it wasn't. My ramen came out about 10 minutes or so. \n\nI wasn't enthusiastic for their presentation. Peep at my picture for reference. I didn't admire how bulky the mizuna made my bowl look. Mizuna are the greens you see in the picture. I love veggies, but was not a fan of how much space it took. Now on to their broth. AGAIN, it was on the sweeter side. I'm more used to that fatty and umami flavor that I was taken by surprise how sweet it was. Of course, this was soy based so it was expected. However, it should NOT be an excuse for their Shoyu Tonkotsu to be like that, too!!! Lastly, I was disappointed with their noodles. It was overcooked and so it felt like eating somewhat soggy and limp noodles. The great thing was that there were more noodles than anything else. \n\nThere's so many dislikes of this bowl that I was left dissatisfied. On to the more happier side of things. I LOVED the mushrooms to this bowl. There were two kinds, one left as is and the other fried. That fried stuff hit the spot. Great texture and enough flavor which made it easily the star of the bowl. \n\nUpon finishing my meal, I have decided that Ramen Bar is not worth my visit. Like other reviewers, there are tons of better ramen but Ramen Bar is smart in attracting business during lunch hours. And extra smarts for being open in the evening. Although the ramen was sad to eat, the friendly service from the staff made it better. \n\nFinal words from Fifi: It's worth a visit ... just to say you've been. But that's about it.

I decided to go with the Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen  (to-go order) which came with pork belly, cabbage, and a sake soft boiled egg.

Tasted quite average for such a fancy and hip establishment in FIDI. \n\n-Minus one star for the long wait for the food (~10 mins). I did not hear my name being called, but I heard my other coworkers' name. I would advise you to stand close to the counter or your soup will get cold! :(\n\n-Minus another one star for the cost.

For my folks downtown SF trying to find a modern and cozy joint for Happy Hour and you're craving ramen, this will hit the spot.\n\nThe location of The Ramen Bar was so convenient to walk to from my office. My friend and I arrived at 5:15pm on a Friday, and there were only a few other customers there. I ordered the shoyu tonkatsu, which is your generic bowl of yellow noodles, pork shoulder, a piece of seaweed, some bamboo, and the most delicious soy-cured egg. You can add on other toppings for a charge, as well- I'll probably add on extra eggs next time. For $14, the bowl of ramen felt overpriced compared to places I've eaten at in Japantown which is why I rated 3 instead of 4 stars. This place also serves boba and cocktails- I sucked down my delicious chai milk tea (can't ever get enough of those tapioca pearls!).\n\nThe ambiance here is pretty cozy and lively compared to other ramen bars. It was pretty warm inside so my Minnesota blood opted to sit outside. The server brought us free appetizers that are part of their happy hour menus. The steamed pork gyoza (normally $3 on their HH menu) tasted like the frozen potstickers from Trader Joe's, which I enjoy - this might not come as a surprise since I already admitted I like instant ramen noodles.\n\nOverall, The Ramen Bar is a convenient and satisfying experience when you want to grab a bowl of ramen and cocktails with friends after work.

So plans have been changed and I haut went with the regular menu, and they are:\n\nWAKAME SALAD - $4\nA tiny portion of seaweed salad thT is placed lovely on a dish with a nice lemon slice garnish.  It's really your typical standard salad that I found quite tasty...nothing to complain about! I don't recommend sharing unless you order another appetizer and have your own main entree :P\n\nCRAB WONTON - $7\nThis appetizer comes with 3 tony fried wonton that is filled with little carb meat, some corn that gave it a sweet fun texture, and just a bit aioli that I barely tasted.  I guess I was hoping for more of a creamy filling...but the wonton part was crispy and not greasy.  It's pricy for what you get and I don't recommend it at all.  It tasted okay.\n\nRAMEN - CHASU MISO-BUTTER HOKKAIDO - $14\nbraised pork, garlic, sweet corn, soy-cured egg (richer, bolder flavor).\nI as happy to see that this bowl had 2 halves of the cured egg...which I thought was perfect! There was plenty of chopped green onions, but I barely saw any corn...which was fine to me.  The chasu pork was ok--it had a black pepper flavor (you can see it rubbed into to the meat) which gave it more of a western flavor in my opinion.  You get one big thick slice.  The north is thick and creamy and the overall bowl was not bad.  It was old but not the best to me because for the price of $14 with the name Michael Minna slapped on it, I guess I set myself up for higher expectations.  I didn't finish it, but had the rest to go, which came in this really cute container with a seal on it.\n\nGREEN TEA PARFAIT - $6\nHuckleberry sake jam, white chocolate green tea mousse, green tea cookie.\nI enjoyed this! My only minor complaint was that the huckleberry jam was too sweet...but if you get the right amount of that with a spoonful of the green tea mouse and a piece of the cookie, it's perfect!  I never had anything like this and I am really glad dessert was ordered!\n\nThe service here is over the top great.  The staff checked on us many times, in addition to the 45 minute span I had to wait for my friend to arrive.  My only complain is that parking isn't great (not that I expect it considering its location), but you can easily bart and walk to. The restaurant is cold and it's probably because the door is always left open.  I had to ask them to close it but it ends up being open again.  Would I come back? Probably not.  I came to give it a try and I am pleased I did.", "author": "Tu-Anh N."}

The cod fritters were good, could have been a little less fried, and could have been more of them for the price ($15 for 4 small pieces). \n\nThe veggie ramen was insanely delicious, many great veggies in the dish; but they don't come with typical ramen noodles, more buckwheat type, so I will request that next time I go, fyi.

I've had bugs in my ramen twice now. Once is bad enough, though excusable as a simple mistake, twice is just irritating.\n\nThe first time this happened to me, I ate inside the restaurant; my ramen was brought to me, everything was fine and dandy while eating, until I went for another bite of noodles and found a dead fly (small, not housefly size, but a fly nonetheless) on top of the greens. I immediately put my chopsticks down, flagged down my waitress, and really quietly told her that there was a dead fly in my soup. She looked extremely embarrassed and took my bowl away, then went over to the chefs and looked very unhappy while pointing out what was in my bowl.\n\nI felt bad for a fraction of a moment because I didn't want to embarrass them all, but finding dead flies in your bowl really isn't cool. They comped my entire meal as an apology for what happened while also getting me another bowl of ramen to-go, so I didn't write about what happened because of how apologetic they were and how they rectified the situation (though I didn't feel like they had to comp my entire meal, I was very grateful that they did). This incident was about three months ago.\n\nToday, I got a bowl of ramen to-go, opened it up, and before I even got to pour my broth there was a live bug this time, crawling along my greens.\n\nThe explanation I got for what happened the first time was that The Ramen Bar wants to keep things organic, so I guess part of being organic is finding something dead in your food (or in today's case, still alive) that would normally have been eradicated through pesticides. But honestly, don't they wash their greens? I can't find any reason why rinsing greens off with water would be offensive to hardcore organic-lovers (I dunno though, correct me if I'm wrong), so why I'm finding bugs in my food (not to mention dirt, the last time I got take-out) I don't know.\n\nI couldn't care less about organic - there, I said it, sorry I'm not sorry - so I'm really not buying the whole, \"We try and be organic so you may or may not find something crawling around or dead in your food\" excuse passable at this point.\n\nKirimachi is right down the street - haven't found anything weird in my bowl there yet!", "author": "Angela M."}

It seems a new joint pops up all the time with even better ramen than the last. One of my coworkers once told me about this place a few blocks away from work. It served some pretty awesome ramen, so one day we decided to try this place out for lunch. Since then, I've been back two other times. \n\nWhen you walk in, you'll notice a really modern space for ramen. Concrete floors, exposed air ducts and dark wooden tables really help create this vibe. If the inside fills up, no worries. There's an outside seating area for your party. For lunch, you walk up to the hostess stand, order, take your seat and they bring  you your food when it's ready. During dinner times, you're sat down and waited on. During my multiple visits, I was fortunate enough to try a couple of dishes. Here's what I had: \n\n-Tokyo Style ramen for $12.00. Kurobuta pork, wakame, soy-cured egg, spinach and broth. The broth was lighter side and was more of your traditional broth. The soy cured egg was by far the best part of the dish! PERFECTLY cooked and flavored.The pork was nicely marbleized and packed with flavor. I thought they added a little too much spinach as it seemed to take over the entire bowl. Other than that, this was on point!\n\n-Chasu Miso-Butter Hokkaido for $14.00. Braised pork, garlic, sweet corn, coy-cured egg. WOW, this was definitely richer than your average ramen. The broth was super buttery and had a lot of the miso flavor. It's great, a lot seemed to turn me off. I did like the crunchy sweet corn and the pork was marbleized nicely. Once again, I thought the star of the dish was the soy-cured egg. I could have that by itself and call it an evening. \n\nTalk about a ramen joint with lots of complex flavors. You've definitely gotta try this place out for yourself. Try the soy-cured egg and be prepared to be blown away. If you're in the area, get your butt down there!", "author": "Rockne H."}

I totally didn't even know ramen existed outside of microwavable packages until like 3 years ago... but I've been spooning my way through my 20s and 30s on a diet almost exclusively of the stuff, so I've definitely learned a thing or two along the way.\n\nThis ramen isn't like any other ramen I've had before, but that's not a terrible thing - just not what I'd expected. \n\nThe average bowl will run you anywhere from $11 for the mushroom soy, to $17 for the shrimp and crab dumpling and you can get add-ons like pork belly, hen's egg, buttered corn, crispy tofu, extra noodles, and more, for $2 each extra. \n\nI was here for a work dinner so I kept within budget with the $11 mushroom soy ramen. Just kidding again! Work is paying for this? I'll throw in the buttered corn, crispy tofu, and hen's egg, son! Which, in the end, was still actually cheaper than any of my colleagues bowls so I didn't actually shred the gnar too hard. \n\nFor appetizers we got edamame, duck wings, and crab and shrimp dumplings. My colleagues didn't seem too crazy in to the duck wings but the edamame was A-Ok and I loved the crab and shrimp dumplings. I totally could've devoured several orders of those on my own. \n\nThe bowl was absolutely enough for two meals - mine even stretched to being two meals and an appetizer for me over the next few days. The broth was pretty creamy for what I'm used to and I would've liked to see more seaweed sheets as an add-on option on the menu, though I'm sure if I'd have asked they would've gladly forked them over. \n\nNoodles were plentiful, the hen's eggs could have been a little less cooked, but it was still good, but I thought for even just $2 that there could have been more than 6-ish little tofu cubes in there. \n\nI really liked that they had the chili paste out on the table because I basically can't live without heaping spoonfuls of that in my ramen, and the house-made togarashi didn't disappoint either. \n\nOh, and also worth mentioning is their beer selection - not huge, but well selected for the cuisine and great with the price point, plus you can get the draft stuff in pitchers if you're really in the mood. \n\nDefinitely don't leave without dessert. I'd go back specifically for the coffee jelly dessert, but the rest of the dessert selection (perfect for individual dining) is mighty tempting as well.", "author": "Candice G."}

I had a great meal here and think you should too. \n\nMichael Mina is a well known chef who creates some killer restaurant concepts. While his ramen may not be the homey, old fashioned stuff you're used to, it's delicious! \n\nThe menu isn't anything crazy. When going to a place called The Ramen Bar for the first time, it seems silly to not give their namesake dish a try. I tried the shrimp and crab dumpling kind and it was awesome. Others around me jazzed up their ramen with an egg, pork belly and tofu but I just tried it regular. As a spicy food fiend, I tossed in a couple heaps of chili paste and was in BUSINESS. \n\nTo start, we also tried the edamame, pork buns, duck wings and crab and shrimp dumplings (I swear there were a lot of us). The winners here were undoubtedly the pork buns and dumplings.

I got the yuzu bars which were like the sophisticated cousin of a moist lemon bar. It was the perfect ending to this kind of meal. \n\nI caught on from SF locals that this ramen costs a bit more than some other places.

While the gyoza was average I'm really glad we ordered the duck wings because it was the saving grace of the meal. They were unique and tasty, albeit a bit dry. The dryness actually worked for it though because of how crispy and delicious the skin was.\n\nI ordered the spicy miso butter ramen and it was underwhelming. The broth was too thin for my tastes which in turn let the butter take over the miso too much. The char siu was average and the pork belly which I added was disappointing as well. I did like the slow cooked egg that I added which was basically a poached egg that let you add some yolkiness to the broth, but it was not enough to save the dish.\n\nOverall, this is not even a contender for good ramen destinations in SF.

Yes, a second dinner but that's how they roll in Japan after an izakaya meal. Heffer status justified. =)\n\nWalking into Ramen Bar, we were confused with the seating and ordering system. Apparently for dine-in orders, you have to wait to be seated while for to-go orders, you stand in line under the \"order here\" sign. \n\nWe opted for counter seats at the window so we could be creepers and people watch. There's otherwise plenty of two-tops, several communal tables, and outdoor seating in their courtyard. There's a glass enclosed open kitchen and lots of wooden furnishings like their adjoining sister restaurant, Pabu. \n\nM E N U:\n*Ramen: Tokyo Roasted Chicken ($12), Braised Pork Belly ($12), Shrimp & Crab Dumpling ($16) and Mushroom & Tofu ($11)\n--Toppings ($2 each): Buttered corn, braised pork belly, soy cured hen egg, and extra noodles \n--Gluten-free noodles available\n--Sadly, no tonkotsu broth available because according to an Inside Scoop SF article, Chef and Mina's Partner, Ken Tominaga (Hana, Rohnert Park) doesn't like tonkotsu. Ehhh, that's like opening a taqueria and not having carnitas on the menu. \n*Donburi ($12 each): Pork, Chicken, Short Rib, and Salmon\n*Salads ($12 each): Salmon, Chicken, Beef Tataki, and Mushroom & Tofu \n\nThere's also 3 desserts on the menu ($3 each): Coffee jelly, Sake roll cake, and Pabu chocolate. \n\nBeer and Junmai are available. \n\nRamen Bar is definitely ramen made for the masses where the focus seems to be to produce as many ramen bowls as possible to feed as many FiDiers as possible. Understandably so, it's the FiDi after all. \n\nPortions are small and it doesn't seem like you're getting a full bowl of ramen (broth filled 1/3rds of the bowl, scant amount of noodles and toppings). For a filling meal, you may want to consider adding extra protein and extra noodles which will bring your total to over $20 including tax and tip. Pricey for a bowl of ramen but not very surprising given the prime real estate location. \n\nSince we just ate dinner at Pabu, we shared the Braised Pork Belly Ramen w/ extra pork belly and buttered corn ($12 + $2 + $2) which quickly came out within 4 minutes of ordering: http://bit.ly/1j2J5Kd.\n\nThe quintessential components of a solid bowl of ramen are the broth and the noodles, both of which Ramen Bar were severely lacking execution in. Opening kinks I hope. \n\nWhile I appreciate that Ramen Bar doesn't use msg in their broth, it seems like they tried to compensate by adding more soy and/or salt. The lukewarm shoyu broth was incredibly salty and one-dimensional with no depth of flavor. No umami whatsoever. I'm not trying to be a sarcastic beeeatch but I'm shocked that some reviewers found the broth to be \"light\". Maybe if I was slurping \"light soy sauce\" then yes, it's \"light\". \n\nThe spaghetti-like noodles were nicely al-dente which is great except I'm not eating at a Italian restaurant. The noodles lacked a springy, toothsome chew that good ramen noodles should have. \n\nWhile the broth and noodles left little to be desired, the chasu pork belly was very tender but you're only given two minuscule slivers for a regular order. Other ramen places usually give you two palm-sized slices. \n\nWe added \"buttered corn\" which wasn't buttered but added a sweet crisp to help make the very salty broth somewhat bearable. \n\nThe best component of the ramen bowl was the \"soy cured\" hen egg which had a perfect lava yolk consistency except it wasn't a \"soy cured\" egg as advertised on the menu. The surface didn't take on a tawny brown color and didn't have a mild, savory sweet flavor. It tasted like a plain, soft boiled egg. They should update their menu to reflect that because that's false advertising. \n\nRamen Bar offers typical condiments like togarashi and white pepper but it was a huge turn off to see the togarashi chilling at each table in an uncovered saucer. Who knows where Joe Schmo's fingers been right?\n\nFor dessert, I did enjoy their Sake Roll Cake ($3) which was light, fluffy, and delicately sweet with fresh berries; just like how Asian cakes should be: http://bit.ly/1qUWYKm.\n\nService was very upbeat, friendly, and fast so kudos for that and rounding up to 3 stars as a result. \n\nIf I still worked in the area, Ramen Underground would be my choice for a much more satisfying bowl of ramen at a fraction of the cost.

I had the hokkaido miso ramen and it tasted more like a plain bowl of noodle in soup rather than a good bowl of Japanese ramen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-17", "description": "Ramen Bar is underrated.\n\nHaving a famous chef creates alot of hype, which is why I think expectations were high and ratings were low. Ramen Bar may have long lines but it moves QUICK, and I love their gluten free options and premium ingredients (mmm mushrooms). For a heartier bowl of ramen in downtown I still prefer Ramen Underground or Katanaya but Ramen Bar offers convenience, speed and a unique take on ramen that would keep me coming back more frequently than all the others. \n\nPro-tips for first timers:\n1. This is an order/pay, get a number, type of restaurant. Arrive with your full party, come early to avoid the lines, but lines move fast.\n2. Everything is tasty, fresh and it's a unique take on ramen. Don't expect Ramen Dojo or Santouka.\n3. Favorite items: chicken and salmon (incredibly moist), gluten free noodles, shimeji mushrooms, duck appetizer, spicy miso broth, coffee jelly dessert. \n4. Least favorite items: Seared beef tataki, milk teas.\n5. You can order in advance online.\n\n* \"HOKKAIDO\" MISO-BUTTER CHASHU RAMEN ($14) - 3.5 STARS:\nNice, rich buttery broth but I felt it was missing something. The chasu a bit too thin for my liking but they provide a generous amount of corn and the egg is cooked to perfection.\n\n* SPICY MISO CHICKEN RAMEN ($14) - 4.5 STARS:\nMy favorite ramen of all the flavors. Rich and spicy and the chicken in general here is moist and tender.\n\n* SHRIMP & CRAB DUMPLING RAMEN ($16) - 3.5 STARS:\nInteresting, flavorful but light broth. The crab dumpling had an odd texture, a bit mushy and pasty. \n\n* MILK TEAS (~$3.50) - 2 STARS:\nThe milk teas are premixed and could use some work on many fronts (far too sweet, low quality milk tea flavor). They offer a chai milk, regular milk tea, and matcha milk tea, with a fee you can spike it with alcohol. The tapioca balls are the saving grace and are cooked perfectly. They also give you a pretty large cup.\n\n* COFFEE JELLY ($3.95) - 5 STARS:\nsoy-caramel pudding, coffee jelly, sesame. This did not taste like soy, it was rich creamy and luscious with just the right amount of sweetness. It's topped with a coffee flavored jelly and an amazing crumble. \n\n* SAKE ROLL CAKE ($3.95) - 4.5 STARS:\nwhipped cream, berries. I don't taste the sake, it tastes like strawberry shortcake with fresh berries and a light whipped cream. I could eat this all day. \n\n* GREEN TEA PARFAIT ($3.95) - 2 STARS:\nwhite chocolate-green tea mousse, plum-sake jam. Super smooth but too sweet for me.", "author": "Jess C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-22", "description": "Ah, The Ramen Bar. Similar to my experience with Pabu, I can see the INSANELY long line that starts around 11am right out my window, and for the last two weeks, I've asked myself, do I really want to stand for that long?  Having had a lackluster experience at Pabu, I delayed my visit until a friend of mine wanted to try it and needed a person to go with.\n\nNaturally, we got in line when it was about 20 minutes deep.  Accept this fact; you will have to wait if you want to eat here. After debating on what to order, my friend and I decided to go halfsies on the Hokkaido Miso Butter Chashu Ramen and the Beef Short Rib Kare Donburi. Ordering was easy, but the wait was equally long as the line leading up to ordering.\n\nThe ramen was...meh. The soup was surprisingly very tasty (maybe even a little salty, and I never met a sodium molecule I didn't like) and was SPICY!  The noodles were a little too chewy for me, and the thing I really enjoyed? The egg.  The Beef Short Rib Kare was also spicy, so the two dishes combined made me feel like my mouth got a huge kick in the ass. Not a bad thing, but you've been warned.  I loved the crispy shallots that were served on top of the rice, but wasn't a huge fan of the mostly raw potatoes and carrots that came with the curry. The pickled onions and ginger on the dish were also delicious, despite the fact that the curry itself wasn't anything special (or anything you couldn't make yourself or find at Nijiya).\n\nSo, after all of this, my conclusion is similar to how I felt about Pabu - it's a halfway decent place when you aren't the one paying for it.  Paying $15 for ramen and $12 for a rice bowl seems silly in mind, but most definitely OK if work's telling me to spend skrilla on lunch. So, to sum everything up, here's how I'm feeling:\n\n- Do I think there are better options for ramen? In the FiDi, not really.\n- Was what I ate worth $30? No, I could probably find better ways to spend that.\n- Am I going to come back? Eh, maybe, but only for special occasions.", "author": "Lisa I."}

It's serviceable, for the FiDi crowd, but honestly, nothing they do here should be cause for concern for my San Mateo benchmarks of Santa Ramen and Ramen Dojo. It's not bad, but it's not great. In fact, since Kirimachi opened up at Embarcadero 3, I haven't been back to Ramen Bar. There's something about paying upwards of $17/$18 for meh ramen.\n\nIt's well run, and I wouldn't say it's bad here, just nothing particularly special. If it was the only game in this part of town, I'd probably still go, maybe once a month, for those times mid-week when I just had to have ramen. With Kirimachi on the scene though, I likely won't be back to this place.\n\nIf you come for lunch (as I imagine most people do, vs. dinnertime), best to show up sometime around 11:30, to ensure you get a table).

That means... don't walk through the door expecting a bowl of noodles like it's straight out of Japan because you'll be very disappointed. I was actually in Japan about a month ago and that ramen was amazing. Ramen Bar, however, does hold its own. \n\nI can't compare Ramen Bar with places like Katana-Ya, Orenchi, etc. because.. Like any Mina restaurant.. Ramen Bar wants to be unique.. And it is!\n\nThe biggest difference between traditional ramen and the stuff served here, to me, is the broth. The broth does't taste as rich but rather more refined, with a slight \"West Coast style\" as they say. When I eat a good bowl of traditional ramen, it's more like \"punch in the mouth\" flavor and hits me with one spoonful. Ramen Bar's broth is more like a ballet- complex but elegant. \n\nFood: The Tonkatsu ($14) is a little one off.. Made with pork belly, shoyu Tate, soft boiled egg, benishoga and cabbage.\n\nDrinks: Does not offer a full bar and can't order drinks from Pabu BUT I did try their Boozy Boba ($7) which is vodka, green tea and honey with honey boba. The drink was pretty boring (or rather highlighted the boba?) and the boba was some of the best I've ever had, even topping several places in Taiwan.\n\nService: Excellent, as usual! The server was very attentive and stopped by several times to ensure our meal was going well. \n\nThis place is definitely a 5 star establishment, especially if you're not a drinker, but I'm pretty disappointed I can't order actual cocktails when Pabu is down the hall. Next time, I'm going to sneak in a small bottle of Yamazaki and ask for sparkling water for a DIY Highball.", "author": "Chris W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-28", "description": "I write this to give some constructive criticism, especially to the manager.  I work in the building, I order the poke bowl(s) mostly, at least once a week, and everything is usually fresh and delicious (except for once)-BUT, every time I order the poke bowl, the ingredients are different.  A few times lately, I have gotten back to my desk with a poke bowl that has rice, a small amount of salmon, a few little cucumbers and zero greens--most of the time, the poke bowl has some nicely dressed mizuna type greens included (and there is a menu option to pay $1 extra for \"greens only\").  Today, I noticed before I left that my bowl had no greens at all.  The woman who took my order said that was a mistake (which I knew from my past orders), but the manager insisted that greens are never part of the poke bowl--huh? So, he huffed off, and threw some dry greens on top.  The woman ahead of me ordered half greens, and half rice (so she clearly thought greens were part of the poke bowl).  She said she always has some problem there as well (we both waited almost 20 minutes, and it was 11:45 and not busy yet-they had clearly forgotten my order--I was nice about it).  Anyway, Ramen Bar could be so much better if it were consistent with the ingredients, and as others have said, a tiny bit more generous when you are paying $14-$16 for a bowl.  If the bowl now has no greens (as the manager indicated), I won't go back--it is not tasty or substantial enough without them.  In addition, as others have mentioned, friendlier service would go a long way.  The manager is busy and efficient, but he is gruff with everyone and never smiles.

For lunch on the Friday before a holiday weekend, there was absolutely no line. The Tokyo Ramen + Thai tea with boba came out to about $23 -- a bit on the pricey side for lunch. When the ramen was delivered, I knew I was in for a good time. The broth was rich, tasty and not too salty. The bitter greens were portioned perfectly, and did a great job cutting the fat of the four pork slices. I added just a touch of sichimi powder to bring up the spicy level -- really complimented the flavor. \nI quite enjoyed the experience and will be back. The happy hour also looks like a great deal!\nP.S. - There is a small poster near the exit door that describes a special deal: if you bring in and donate a fully functional (all the pieces, nothing broken/missing/torn/destroyed) board game and talk with the manager, apparently you get a bowl of ramen for free. If you're interested in trying this place and (assuming this special is still happening) you can probably end up financially ahead if you find an old/used/intact board game at Goodwill or a garage sale or something and trade it in for a free ramen.", "author": "Paul L."}

It has a cool look to it, but I was disappointed in most of their ramen broths.\n\nIt's a strange blend of a Japanese Ramen Bar and a Wolfgang Puck Express, in particular the Wolfgang Puck Express at Chicago Ohare International Airport. The layout and approach is almost identical. The only difference is at Chicago Ohare, you are in airport captivity and Wolfgang's is the best of the less than ideal fast food options inside security. This is why I have eaten at this Wolfgang Puck's a zillion times. The Ramen Bar on the other hand, has to compete with all the other great food options in San Francisco.\n\nJust like Wolfgang's there's the fridge to the right as you stand in line, and the relatively limited menu to keep the kitchen simple.\n\nThe problem is the food, I tried 3 of the broths and only really liked one of them, the Hokkaido Miso-Butter Chashu Ramen. The rest were just too plain or salty with no depth.\n\nThat said I did enjoy the Hokkaido Miso-Butter Chashu Ramen with the extra pork belly. The cured eggs that come with the ramen are quite good. I also liked the coffee jelly on soy-caramel mousse dessert.\n\nThe staff was friendly, but the wait of 10 to 15 mins was longer than I expected if you are doing take out. My takeout noodles were overcooked even though they were packed separately from the soup. I'm not sure they have the takeout formula optimized yet. I'd recommend calling ahead or ordering on-line to save time.\n\nA good local fast food option, but it did not quite live up to my earlier hopes of a Japanese Ramen Bar like the one in the J\u00fbz\u00f4 Itami' classic movie, \"Tanpopo\".", "author": "David T."}

The duck wings are amazing, but they're only available on the evening menu.  The gyudon bowl was absolutely delicious.  For those who like beef and rice, I strongly suggest trying it.

It's right in the middle of the financial district, and as hustle-n-bustle as that area is, the patio is incredibly relaxing because there are plenty of beautiful plants, people, and buildings to look at while eating.  It's also a block away from Bart so it's very easy to get to from across town.\n\nThe restaurant was very clean.  The servers have always been polite.

This is a big deal.  Partly because I love ramen/noodle soup so much I have written it a sonnet my life-time.  Also, because artisan ramen had an all time peak in popularity in 2014.  More importantly, this is one of the unique times in my over 500 reviews I am pretty confident I can do a very apples-to-apples comparison.   Being the over analytic person I am, this is exciting.  Lastly, because less face it, I want to do something more exciting than my regular reviews. \n\nIn case you were wondering about my ramen-eating qualifications, I have reviewed 13 ramen places so far on yelp (http://www.yelp.com/list/2-ramen-eating-san-francisco).  I have eaten at way more places than I have reviewed.  Also, if I made an \"asian noodle soup\" list, nobody would read it because it would be over 50 restaurants long...\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE/WAIT TIMES:\nDining In- At ramen bar, you wait in a reasonably fast moving line at 12:00pm (longer at 12:30pm) to order at a register.  You get a number and your ramen and wine are delivered VERY quickly.  There is surprisingly ample seating despite the line even on a Thursday at 12:00pm (see how I went on Thursday at 12:00pm both days for even more accurate comparison?!)\nTake Out-  I think this would be great take out, just like Kirimachi.  I'd call in my order and pick it up.  \n\nTHE FOOD:\nThere were two ramen types that were the most similar between the restaurants.  I enlisted my cousin to help me try both at the same time at each location.\n\n1) Miso Ramen (Kirimachi) $13-Dashi based broth, chashu pork, baby arugula, corn, green onion, soy marinated soft boiled egg.\nVS\nSpicy Chasu Miso Butter Ramen (Ramen Bar) $14- braised pork, garlic, sweet corn, soy cured egg.  (To see the detailed review, go to the sister review)\n\n\n2) Shoyu Ramen (Kirimachi) $13- lighter pork broth, chashu, Tokyo scallion, memma, soy marinated soft boiled egg\nVS\nTokyo Style Ramen (Ramen Bar) $12- Kurobuta pork, wakame, soy cured egg. (To see the detailed review, go to the sister review).\n\nTHE COMPARISON:\nRamen Bar Tokyo Style Ramen was better than their Chasu Miso Butter Ramen.  We felt that the broth was much better.  The spicy miso broth was too concentrated and almost too salty for me (and I seriously eat pure salt for the taste/fun).  The heat was there but did not fix the problem or have a distinct flavor.  The Shoyu broth was a better balance and was much more pleasant to eat.   The Ramen Bar noodles were smoother and even thinner than Kirimachi.  They had chew but somehow, it was not quite right.  The soft cooked egg was perfection, you get both halves of the egg (this is a big plus!) and they packed in a whole lot of excellent flavor into the cured egg.  This egg is a superstar.  Go egg go!  I thought the corn was kind of dissappointing because it was obviously canned and lacked the crispness and flavor of the fresh or good quality frozen corn.  I thought the greens in the Ramen Bar ramen were classic, plentiful, and good.  I loved the portion and quality of the wakame, spinach, large piece of nori, green onion, and bamboo shoots.  Lastly, loved the chasu meat at Ramen bar because it was soft, fatty, and juicy.  I could have eaten more than one slice for sure! My cousin said he prefers leaner cuts of meat.\n\n\nThe portion sizes here are a heavy lunch portion.  Not quite enough to take half home unless you eat like a tiny bird, but not enough to feed that person you know who can never get enough food.  I thought it felt quite decadent eating the whole thing. I could have left about 1/4 of it...but who does that?!  It was a good temperature and came out lightening fast.  \n\nKirimachi's Miso was better than Ramen Bar's Chasu Miso Butter Ramen\n(See Sister Review for more detail http://www.yelp.com/biz/kirimachi-ramen-san-francisco-2?hrid=PMFs0y56fxg8lI4rd8mFAA)\n\nKirimachi's Shoyu was not as good as Ramen Bar's Tokyo Style Ramen\n(See Sister Review for more detail http://www.yelp.com/biz/kirimachi-ramen-san-francisco-2?hrid=PMFs0y56fxg8lI4rd8mFAA)\n\nTHE OVERALL WINNERS:\nNoodles-- Kirimachi (Susan and Cousin Agree)\nBroth--Miso Better at Kirimachi, Shoyu Better at Ramen Bar (Susan and Cousin Agree)\nMeat--Chasu better at Ramen Bar (Susan-who likes more fat on pork) Chasu better at Kirimachi (Cousin who likes leaner pork).\nEgg--Better at Ramen Bar (Susan and Cousin Agree)\nCorn--Better at Kirimachi (Susan and Cousin Agree)\nGreens-- Better at Ramen Bar (Susan and Cousin Agree)\n\nP.S. I hate that my \"as you type\" spell check red-line thinks that Ramen is misspelled.  This whole review is covered in red.\n\nP.P.S. The $6 tiny glass of crappy wine is barely worth the money.", "author": "Susan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-28", "description": "I love ramen. It's comforting, delicious, filling, tasty, full of healthy food, you can pick what you want and don't want in it. San Francisco has many options for ramen in it and some are better than others. With the popularity of ramen, more and more places are popping up and we try them out when we can. Sometimes though, it's hard to justify the cost of what is essentially noodle soup. \n\nThe other day I decided to order from Ramen Bar through their online tool. I went through the menu and found their online ordering tool, and picked out what I wanted (mushroom and soy ramen with no extras included since I wanted my first order to be just the default soup). I ordered for pickup since it was literally one block over, as ramen shouldn't be allowed to sit and soak in its broth or given a chance to cool down much.\n\nI walked over and picked up my order as soon as I placed it, and despite the really heavy line up out the door, was able to skip all the way to the front and get my food right away. I headed back to the office and pulled my containers out in the kitchen only to be really annoyed/frustrated over the set up: everything is divided up in separate containers, which is great, but without having a large bowl to put everything in, I had to rely on the containers they gave me to put everything in, essentially a large, tall upright skinny container. Not exactly the best option, but something to keep in mind for future take outs.\n\nOnce I managed to get everything put together, I dipped into the hot soup. It's extremely mushroomy and flavourful, but I wasn't much of a fan of the taste once I got into it. Now, this is personal preference so I can't complain there, but on the flip side, ramen noodles should feel slightly undercooked, chewy, with a solid bite to them. These weren't overcooked but they weren't the solid al dente style noodles I expected. After sitting in the soup a bit longer, they became soft and a lot more meh, totally not what I wanted in ramen. \n\nI got through about half of my soup before I was just bored and done with it. I was disappointed and let down, like I'd gone on a mediocre date after being so excited for it. In a city that has such amazing, awesome food and can serve up some beautiful ramen, there's no reason to settle for \"just adequate\".", "author": "Cassandra J."}

The interior architecture may have been the only highlight of my lunches here; the decor reveals the concrete structure, and that juxtaposes against the wood counters and tables really well.  I like the tall exposed ceilings and the way the counter wraps around the restaurant, leaving the chefs visible to the restaurant goers. However, along with high ceilings comes really accentuated acoustics.  The place is loud, almost difficult to have a comfortable conversation over a meal when it is crowded, and like I said, I was eating there when the restaurant was not at max capacity.  Luckily, from my experience, the cashier service and the serving process was efficient and quick; I did not have to wait long for my meal. \n\nBoth times I came for lunch, I was ravenous.  I don't have a preference for traditional vs non-traditional ramen, I am pretty open minded to the ingredients and seasonings for noodles in general.  I didn't expect it to be so hard to find a good ramen fix in the diverse city of San Francisco, but with the co-branded hype, this fell short for me at each visit.\n\n1st visit - \nHokkaido 3/5: The sweet corn in this dish was probably the most unique part, and highlight, of my meal. The pork tasted a bit washed out and plain, as though the fat in the meat was the only part that brought out any taste at all.  The broth was light and buttery as described without being too oily which I appreciated.  On a rainy day, this was a decent place to stop in for a late lunch.\n\n2nd visit-\nTonkatsu 2/5:  The noodles were firm and chewy with a smooth slurp-able texture which is what I prefer, however, it was a bit tasteless.  The soup tried to compensate for the lack of flavor in the noodles by being ridiculously heavy and salty.  Each scoop of soup dehydrated me further, and each of the ingredients were fresh as advertised, but added very little flavor.  I did enjoy the pork and how it was seasoned, but there was literally 1 small diced up thin sheet of pork that topped my soup, and seemed like a rip-off considering I had paid a $3 premium for their \"special\" Tonkatsu dish.  The soft boiled egg was bland as well, but tasted better when seasoned with some of the black pepper they offered at the tables. \n\nOverall,  The ramen flavor I've come to love and expect is lackluster, and the portion size is medium at best.  I rarely finish a meal without feeling absolutely stuffed, but after my lunch here, I still felt a pang of hunger as I left. With the ramen priced at $12-14, I can't say that I'll likely be back when there are more flavorful options around for the same price point.\n\nI suggest Ramen Underground for better ramen at the same price, and Ajisen ramen for slightly cheaper ok ramen if you don't mind eating in a food court.", "author": "Kathy T."}

They do good food in a fun environment that should make everyone feel welcome. We came with a large group and were able to be seated and accommodated easily with our large party. We ordered up some pitchers of Kirin and settled in for a relaxed night. \n\nWe started with edamame, steamed pork buns, and crispy miso duck wings. The pork buns are steamed to tender and delicious puffiness. The duck wings weren't really a huge hit with the table, but if you like duck, they're worth a try. \n\nBut let's talk ramen. The main event. I ordered the shrimp and crab dumpling ramen with ginger miso broth and sweet corn. And because I believe in going big, I threw a soy cured egg in that bad boy. The broth is light and flavorful. The crab is tender. The sweet corn really kicks the whole meal into a higher level in both texture and flavor. The sweetness balances the light, meaty flavors of the broth, and the plump and tender crunch adds a nicely interesting pop to the slurpy noodle goodness. The egg is definitely a game changer, but y'all know I'm Team Egg in and on all things. It's a great protein shot that satisfies in this dish. \n\nThe house made chile paste and sweet and salty spice mix kicked the flavor profile up in a melodic symphony of complementary tastes. This bowl takes all of my favorite flavors and stirs them together so every bite hits the salty, sweet, meaty, umami soaked high that I crave. \n\nDo I have room for dessert? No. But I order it anyway. Our amazing server brought out a tray to show off the imaginative and creative sweets The Ramen Bar showcases. I was tempted by the uzu dessert and the peanut butter toffee brittle. I asked our waiter which he recommended, and he said hands down the uzu, which he described as a cross between a lemon bar and a shortbread, \"but like way better.\" Sold. It's so light and refreshing while still being substantial enough to satiate my sweet tooth. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend The Ramen Bar. It's the perfect spot to have a loud, group meal and be taken care of attentively. The service is above and beyond, and most importantly, the food satisfies. This whimsical and fun take on comfort food should please any lighthearted food lover. Enjoy your slurp.", "author": "Lindsay R."}

The portions were really small, they only give you one piece of meat, an egg that's been bathing in soy sauce, and some seaweed and bamboo shoots.

No! And they're not trying to be. Consider this gourmet ramen with a funky edge.\n\nOne of the many great things about TRB is that the line moves fast! Order at the counter, grab a drink/dessert and get a number. That seriously cuts down on the long wait that many other ramen places suffer from.\n\nI tried the seafood dumplings and was pleased with the flavor.

I actually really enjoyed this ramen. There was a generous serving of tonkotsu, perfectly soft boiled egg and the broth was flavorful and creamy. They have the spicy powder on the side so I could make it spicy to my liking. There was also a generous serving of noodles. I could barely finish my bowl!

It was like a scene from the Hunger Games. Literally. Post Street was packed with desperate people waiting 2-3 hours for small bowls. Ramen is apparently the new black. Actually it's the old black. Lukewarm, however, appears to be the new black because the heat is what was missing on the two occasions I've dined here. Also the paucity of noodles was rather disappointing. Where is David Chang's gluttonous approach when we need it so badly in this city? Probably among the most unlikely chefs to open a ramen house, Michael Mina has partnered with chef Ken Tominaga of Rohnert Park's Hana to unleash a casual spot targeted to softer FiDi palates.\n\nI have to say I'm a bit mixed on the results. On the upside and indicative of Mina's usually immaculate style, the ingredients in the bowls are fresh and tasty. However, I was bummed on my first visit not to see a tonkotsu selection on the menu. When I asked, I was informed that lunch customers are not usually looking for something that heavy, so they made a conscious decision not to offer it. Say what? If I want a milky broth made of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen, I think I should have it, don't you? Alas, I was left to try the $12 Tokyo-Style Kurobuta Pork Ramen with wakame, soy-cured egg and spinach. For an extra $2, I ordered the Braised Pork Belly since I'm usually not satisfied with the amount of chashu I get. I was right.\n\nWhat got me was that it cost me yet another $2 for buttered corn kernels (photo: http://bit.ly/1pJOaoD). In hindsight, I kinda wonder if I should have spent the last $2 on extra noodles since they were a bit skimpy compared to any bowl you'd find at Yamadaya or Men Oh Tokushima. It was still quite good because it's Mina-endorsed after all, but the $16 price tag gave me pause. I did save room for the $3.96 Coffee Jelly, a more fanciful version than you'd find in a J-Town grocery fridge but still in a disposable plastic cup. It was anchored by a mousse-like soy-caramel pudding and topped with sweet sesame croutons (photo: http://bit.ly/UpBglZ). To the manager's credit, she sought my feedback to which I directly responded that I missed a tonkotsu option and wished the broth was warmer.\n\nOn my return visit a week later, she remembered me and recommended the new addition to the menu, the $14 \"Hokkaido\" Miso-Butter Chashu Ramen. Ah, better. It was even billed as a \"heavier style\" with the sweet corn already thrown in with the egg as well as garlic (photo: http://bit.ly/1pe9iC5). This time, I ordered neither the extra pork nor the noodles, and the bowl was a bit lacking in quantity for dinner at least. Temperature was still an issue, and I'm not sure why since it wasn't as crowded as it was at lunch. Lines, however moved pretty quickly on both visits as did the ramen, so kudos to them for conquering the phobia I was clearly feeling at the festival last weekend. I did notice Mina in the kitchen on the second visit, so he's definitely not phoning this shop in while focusing on the more upscale Pabu next door. Good for him as I wait and see if they get into the right mojo here.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...fresh ingredients but temperature and noodle quantity was lacking...ramen takes time to perfect, bring me the tonkotsu please\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...pretty good space. not too challenging to get a table even at lunch (photo: http://bit.ly/1A9Jkbh)\nSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive and kudos to the manager for taking my (and everyone else's) feedback seriously\nTOTAL - 3.5 stars...could move up to a 4 if they turn up the heat on the stove and add a few more Sun noodles to the mix", "author": "Ed U."}

Yeah, deal with it.\n\nWhile I myself do love the milky white viscous broth that is so prominently associated with ramen, I am happy that a fresh lighter yet flavorful take on ramen broth is being served here.  In fact the first bowl of ramen I ordered here on opening day was the Tokyo Roast Chicken.  The chicken was perfect, the egg was perfect and the broth was a welcome surprise.  It was the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had.\n\nI've been back several times and noticed that the ramen and donburi options change slightly on each visit.  This is going to be fun!\n\nOther items I've ordered are the short rib kare, seated beef tataki salad and finally today I went full pork with the Tokyo kurobata pork ramen with buttered corn added.  The short rib kare had tender beef and a savory curry.  The seared beef tataki was refreshing with fresh veggies, bright ginger, punchy yuzu and wonderful seared beef.  I really liked the pork ramen, with a broth that wasn't going to leave me feeling bloated or ready for a nap when I got back to the office.  And I do need to mention how great the cured eggs are! At every visit, but today, they were beautifully soft boiled and have a wonderfully pronounced flavor.  My egg today was overdone but still tasted great.\n\nI've also had a couple sweets in the form of their milk bread and the green tea parfait.  The milk bread was light and served with butter and house made fruit compotes.  The green tea parfait was very rich and needs the plum sauce at the bottom to balance out the mousse on top.\n\nI'm looking forward to coming back and seeing what new variations of ramen and donburi make it on their menu.", "author": "Luis M."}

So I've left most of my first review below as it's pretty much the same. Seating was a little easier and the broth was a little better. This time around ordering took a long time as they never seemed to have cashiers at both registers. It would help if they had someone working the line to give suggestions and answer question so there is less hemming and hawing from people when they finally get to the counter. We all spent enough time in line to figure out what to order. I just think some people unfamiliar with the format could use a little help and they could provide someone to do that. Similar to what in and out does by having someone working their drive through when it's really long. \n\nMy one big change with my opinion with the food is charging for a side of kimchi. It's a large side that for even two people is too much. They'd be better of giving out complimentary sides of it like a lot of places do. Other than that the ramen experience is the same as you'll read below. \n\nI'll admit I was drawn in by the hype. In the end it's all it is. My friend and I got in line around 1 and it was a quick wait as the cashiers ripped through 15 people.  Problem is you have to fend for yourself with seating.  I'd prefer assistance from staff at this point as it's possible in my eyes that you could end up getting your bowl before sitting down.  Maybe they're watching for it but I'd prefer organization in that respect.  \n\nThe ramen came out efficiently. Noodles were made well but the flavor of both of our broths was not very deep in flavor. We had the Tokyo Style and the Hokkaido Miso Butter.  Definitely needed help from the spicy paste and the togarashi at the table. The pork was a bit firm and not as fatty as I'd like.  If I worked in the area I could see being a regular as a ramen fan simply because they have 0 competition aside from Ramen Underground which is tiny and the occasional appearance by Hapa Ramen. I can see how people will like it and it will be a nice addition to the area.  In the end it's just not for me nor was it for my lunch partner. I'd give it a 2.5 if I could give half stars.", "author": "Joco F."}

They've got a large number of staff, and they move things efficiently. Not your typical ramen sit-down joint, but more like a \"fast casual\" ramen shop.\n\nAs for the ramen itself, it's quite good. I wasn't expecting much since Michael Mina isn't traditionally known for Asian cuisine, but hey, him and his chef got a good thing going here.\n\nThe typical American \"ramen lover\" seems to only know tonkotsu (and if I see you spelling it, \"tonkAtsu\", I'm going to discredit you immediately). If the broth ain't porky and milky, then they assume that the ramen sucks. Well, tonkotsu is only one  in a large array of ramen styles, and for this particular style (Tokyo-style, shoyu-style, whatever you wanna call it), this was legitimately good. Good broth, tender meat, and solid noodles.\n\nSo why not 5-stars?\n...portion size.\n\nFor $12, I was still a bit hungry.

Don't go into here looking for *authentic* Japanese ramen. You're best off going to South Bay. To me, I would consider it still a good bowl.\n2. Consider where you are eating, SF's Financial District. OF COURSE everything is going to be pricey. If you're not willing to spend the money then don't eat here.\n---\nVENUE: It's a 5-10 minute walk off Embarcadero BART located right next to Pabu. There's outdoor and indoor dining with bar space perfect for eating solo. \n\nIf you go during peak lunch hours expect there will be a line. When I went on Friday ~noon, line was present but it was around 12 minutes from the time I fell in line to placing my order. Should you not want to wait there are 3 different ways of placing your order, but keep in mind that you can only do this for TO GO orders.\n1. http://www.theramenbar.com\n2. Facebook\n3. App for iOS and Android.\n\nSERVICE: Quite attentive. During both times I went the people brought your food items with a smile and they regularly kept on asking me if I wanted anything taken away. This was still true even during Friday lunch hour.\n\nWhen I go I like to sit where I can watch my ramen bowl being made. There's an assembly line with the more experienced chefs towards the entrance handling the two most important parts of a good bowl: cooking and distributing the noodles and controlling the proportion of miso to broth. The rest of the chefs have an easier job of placing the rest of the ingredients and making sure the bowl looks aesthetically pleasing. \n\nDespite being called the RAMEN bar they also have a decent selection of non-ramen items. In particular I would like to try the donburis on my visit and this would be a convincing reason to bring the No1DP, who lives in the land of ramen... but doesn't like ramen all too much. There's a different menu for dinner but it's only slight changes. \n\nI had the opportunity to try the two most popular ramen, their \"Hokkaido\" Miso-Butter Chashu and the Spicy Miso Chicken ($14). Both are on the heavier side per the miso broth.\n-Both bowls looked quite pleasing when served.\n-Both bowls had their noodles al dente. This is a must in a good ramen bowl, the ramen should have the consistency of al dente pasta.\n-The main difference between the miso bowls aside from the meat is that the meat imparts a different flavor to the broth. The pork really gives a feeling of \"stick-to-the-ribs\" comfort food and I enjoyed sipping the broth until my bowl was empty. I didn't get that feeling for the chicken, partly because I was rushed for time but also the chicken is less heavier than the pork.\n-I really don't get the sweet corn. To me it just adds unnecessary starch. No1DP tells me that corn is actually a common topping in ramen in Japan.\n-The soy-cured egg tastes somewhat sweet, I'm thinking this is soaked in mirin. The egg has a consistency that I love, one that has the yolk mostly done (not runny!) but still soft. \n-There's a decent amount of greens.\n-The chashu is soft and tender and like I said before, the flavor really improves the broth. The chicken on the second bowl was tender for the most part but there were some chewy pieces that suggest that maybe the chicken wasn't cut up enough.\n-There are sides that can spice up your bowl. I noticed there is shichimi powder and a spicy paste. I did this to my miso-butter chashu bowl and I ruined the taste by making it more spicy. Note to myself: next time don't do this.\n-The spicy miso bowl needed more spicy. Note to myself: Next time add the spices.\n\nI also had the ramen bowls with their milk teas, the Hong Kong and Masala Chai ($3.50 each). It's good for a milk tea drink that doesn't have too much powdery consistency.\n\nConsidering location and cost I can't be here too often but I look forward to creating more opportunities to do so.", "author": "Isabella B."}

I'm always looking for new lunch spots.  My coworker and I headed over what we thought could be early enough to avoid a long wait.  We were wrong, already a big line out the door when we got there around 11:25.  We waited probably about 15ish minutes in line, and around 15 minutes for our food.  It gave us time though to enjoy the decor, see the waitstaff's smiling faces and see Michael Mina.   We both ordered the Pork Belly Ramen ($12) and ordered them to go since our office isn't too far.\n\nWe finally got to dig in and the soup and dry ingredients (separated) were piping hot.  Portion did look a little on the smaller side, but still filled me up.  There were three small pieces of tender delicious pork...meaty enough but still had some of the fat for flavor.  The broth was a mix of pork and chicken dashi.  Also in the bowl was some seaweed, spinach, bamboo shoots, a few sprouts and a soy cured egg.  I'm thinking if I ate at the restaurant, the egg yolk would have been runny.  It was still gelatinous but didn't run when I ate it, one of the better eggs though I must say.  Noodle had the perfect bite to it too.  The broth could have used a little more flavor and was a little on the watery side.  Bamboo shoots were done right, as many places don't cook them for long enough.  Broth doesn't contain MSG and didn't make us thirsty.  \n\nHonestly, I hope that they add more broths to their ramen menu as the Pork Belly one is the only one that interested me.  I don't like how the chicken ramen is combined with a seafood and chicken broth, and the shrimp and crab ramen sounds good, but it comes with a clam broth, and clams aren't my thing.  Definitely a bootycall ramen place, as it's pretty much the only ramen place in FiDI.  In fact, when one FiDi working friend and I really crave ramen for lunch, we would bus it to Katana-ya.  For the price, I'd prefer Katana-ya's signature ramen dish with all their goodies in it, even though they aren't on my top ramen list either.  If I'm seriously craving ramen in the FiDi, I'd probably come back for the same ramen as today, or I would possibly try one of their noodle salads or donburi (both also $12).  I asked one of the employees when they will expect their online ordering to be up, they said at least a week to work through the kinks and high demand.  The Ramen Bar is really a 3.5 and I was tempted to round down, but because everything really was cooked right it deserves a round up to the 4, just the broth and price/portion kind of made it more of a 3.", "author": "Cat C."}

Their take on ramen departs a little from traditional styles while still screaming ramen.\n\nI stopped by on opening night and to my surprise there was plenty of room for me and my party of 6. The staff was super friendly and helpful and made us feel at home. If you come during the day, you would order at the counter and bring your number to your table. The interior of the restaurant is very trendy and classy, but casual. If I had a ramen restaurant, this is how I would picture it.\n\nAll the ramen choices sounded delicious as well as their donburi selection, but I opted for the Tokyo Roast Chicken Ramen with yuzu kosho while others got the Pork Belly Ramen. Our bowls came out steamy hot shortly after. It wasn't scalding hot like I like my broth, but definitely better than luke warm ramen at other places.\n\nI first tasted the chicken broth. I didn't know what to make of the first sip other than it was rich in flavor. It is not as strong as a bowl of tonkotsu (my favorite) or spicy miso broth, but the flavors of the sea were very prominent. You could really taste the dashi flavor from the kombu (kelp) and the smokey bonito flakes. The more sips I took, the more the flavors began to unfold. I began to takes the citrus notes from the yuzu kosho. The flavors well rounded. I took a sip of my cousin's bowl of the braised pork belly ramen which had a nice rich lip smacking flavor.\n\nThe toppings were first class. The bamboo shoots were tender and marinated very well and the egg was heavenly. One of the best ramen egg I've had. The outside had a lovely sweet flavor and the yolk inside was creamy and silky smooth. A big plus was that it wasn't colder like other ramen joints.\n\nThe noodles, however, I felt like could use a little more snap to them. The flavor was there but it didn't have that bite to them that alkaline noodles should have. They mentioned on the menu that they use Chinese style egg and wheat noodles. While ramen noodles originate from China, both the original and contemporary ramen noodles do not contain eggs. They get their yellow color for the alkaline water (probably more information than you need to know). \n\nOverall I really like this place. Even though this was their opening day, it felt like they have been serving bowls of ramen for years. I am looking forward to seeing this place more often and seeing what is to come.\n\nP.S. There is a lot of hate that they do not serve tonkotsu broth. I love tonkotsu broth for its fatty and overwhelming richness and mouth feel, but there is also beauty in shoyu or shio based broths that are often overlooked.

Then i realized how many people walked in and out of that place in the time that i was casually having lunch with our group and thought wow.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-18", "description": "I was a bit perplexed after finding out that Michael Mina had a restaurant opened in Japanese Ramen, as his expertise is in New American/Steakhouse fine luxurious dining.  Ramen is no where close to being in his genre and by far the complete opposite of what he's good at doing!  It got me worried that he was just jumping into the ramen craze band wagon that's been steadily growing more and more popular over this decade.  There use to be 2 ramen shops that I knew of way back in the days and they were in San Mateo (Santa Ramen and Ramen Club).  But now, there are so many more options for ramen and each has it's own distinct stamp on broth and noodles.  So, with a famous restaurateur, like M.Mina putting his designer name onto ramen, it was a must MUST try for me.\n\nAs we enter the rustic feeling Ramen Bar, it is quite spacious!  The walls are lined with neatly stacked jugs of soy sauce, hot sauce and all types of Asian ingredients.  They really wanted to make sure Japan stood out in this wooden box of noodle decor.  I liked the options of sitting at the open kitchen bar, wooden tables inside or bench seating outdoors.  Options are nice!\n\nIt was dinner time and we strolled right in and was seated immediately.  Our waiter, whom was friendly, was attentive and immediately begins educating us on the broth and how there's no popular tonkatsu broth available.  We already knew there was no tonkatsu but was ready to hear his recommendations.  Here's what our waiter recommended and we both ordered:\n\n;-)  Bottled Shochu Hai ($10) - this was a nice grapfruit juice drink.  We didn't taste any sake but it did give us a light buzz on, which is all we ask for.  Next time, we'll try to get in during happy hour for this one, as $5 is more our liking.  - 3.5 STARS\n\n;-)  Hokkadai Noodles with an extra topping of braised pork belly ($12 + $2) - First off, the noodles were really, really spectacular.  It was smooth, thin, al-dente and made great slurping noises.  Cooked to perfection and one of the best tasting ramen I've had.  The broth, which we were expecting to be a lighter version of tonkatsu was actually delightful with it's lightness.  I actually did NOT mind it was light because it still had enough fragrant to keep the flavors on my tongue happy.  The cha-sui was decent but I've had better.  The corn was immaculately freshly cut and so sweet!  Now, the waiter sold us on the braise pork belly as being the most tender fatty thing he put in his mouth, we beg to differ.  It was good but it was not the melt in your mouth pork belly that we were accustomed to.  Go to Santa Ramen and you'll understand why Ramen Bar's version was not up to par.  - 4 STARS Ramen & 2.5 STARS Braised Pork Belly\n\n;-)  Sake Roll Cake with whipped cream and berries ($3.95) - It came out in a tacky plastic container.  At least take it out and put it on a dish!  At any rate, this sponge cake was a tad stale that night but the whip cream and berries were very light and airy.  It was good but we've had better...way better, especially the sponge cake.  -- 3 STARS\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed their bowl of noodles.  I came in ready to be a hater because of a bad experience I had in Oakland's Ramen Shop (cost more, bad service, bad broth) and plus all the negative reviews I read on Yelp.  Now, to reconfirm that Ramen Bar has good ramen...go home and eat instant Top Ramen bought from a CVS store, then come back here and eat their freshly made noodles, delicious/light no-MSG broth and superior toppings, then you'll realize, damn, that's a really good bowl of Ramen.", "author": "Jenny T."}

There's always a line but it moves quick and your food comes out just as fast. First time I was here I tried the pork belly ramen. SO GOOD! The broth was very light and flavorful.. I hear they do a 24 hour \"brew\" to make it! And it wasn't salty or fatty. I also liked how it was a perfect temperature to eat right away. I like to order mine with light noodles, extra broth and extra braised oh so tender and delicious pork belly. \n\nToday I tried the roasted chicken ramen bowl. Also very good! The chicken was tender and I really enjoyed all the added greens it came with. \n\nOther points of awesomeness:\n1. You get a whole egg of perfection, vs the half egg at other places. \n2. Yummy spices to add on table\n3. MANY DESSERT OPTIONS!! I've tried the brittle, green tea madelines, sake roll cake, and the miso cookies.

Actually, I was expecting to have a horrible experience. Since I came in with such low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there are some things that need improvement, but it was actually an alright bowl of ramen. (Well, if you don't take into account the actual ramen. We'll get to that a little later.)\n\nWhen you enter Ramen bar, you place your order with the cashier. You're given a number and then you find your seat. Shortly after, a server brings by your bowl and the slurping begins!\n\nI opted for the \"Hokkaido\" miso-butter chashu ramen ($14) which comes with braised pork, sweet corn and a soy-cured egg. I added Braised pork belly which was an additional $2. The bowl was nice and hot when it arrived. There isn't much chashu in the bowl so I'm glad I added the pork belly. Even though I got 2 small slices, it added enough extra protein for my hungry belly. The menu describes the broth as a \"richer, bolder flavor\", which I guess it was for miso broth. But I'm a huge fan of tonkotsu, so it was on the lighter side for me. The soy-cured egg however was cooked perfectly! The yolk had a nice consistency. My only issue with the ramen were the noodles. They were on the smaller side in terms of thickness (think spaghetti like noodles), so they didn't have that nice chewy consistency I love in ramen noodles. I'm not a big noodle eater anyways, but I normally have a couple of bites. I basically left almost all of my noodles in the bowl this time.\n\nService was fast and efficient. The server delivered my bowl of ramen with a smile and asked if I needed anything else. The cashier also made a point to tell me to keep the receipt until I got my food, so make sure to hang on to it until you get your ramen.\n\nMaybe if I'm in the area again, I'll drop by to try their other ramens. But if I'm craving a nice comforting bowl of ramen (without the pretentiousness and high price tag), I'd probably hit another spot.", "author": "Elena N."}

I ordered the Pork Belly Ramen. The noodles were like spaghetti, the broth was so damn boring and nasty - literally tasted like the beef flavored Top Ramen broth. I had to pour on some spicy powder to give it something. BLAH. Don't waste your time or money SF friends. Thank GOD I was first in line and didn't have to wait for this mediocre dish. \n\nMoreover, I was highly disappointed in the price to portion. I understand a Michael Mina restaurant is going to be expensive because you're paying for \"quality,\" but come on. I ordered the pork belly WITH EXTRA $2.00 pork belly and I received two VERY THIN slices of pork belly. If you've been to Ramen Underground and have ordered the pork belly there, think about 1/2 of once piece of pork belly and that's what you get for the bowl plus $2.00 for extra pork belly. I'm really hoping they just forgot to add the extra that I paid for - which is still just as annoying. The egg was good though (1 star extra). \n\nAlso, please tell your staff that if they are going to run around like chickens with their heads cut off, then they should watch out for peoples belongings. My purse was knocked off of my chair twice and the second time, the guy grabbed it and tossed it under my table. Are you kidding me? This is a very expensive LV purse.

As many have noticed with the massive crowd in Japantown for the Ramen Festival, nobody should mess around with ramen. It's serious business in the Bay Area. I've been wanting to try this place about a year ago, before all those constructions have started, before the ramen bar instagram was flooded with posts. I heard of the restaurant concept from friend of mine who is in the restaurant business. My god, I was so hyped up, I would round up any friends who were interested to countdown with me. \n\nAnyway, this is a casual spot. Service is mediocre, the place is spacious, casually modern atmosphere. You have a to go line up front and dine in eaters can be seated at tables outside, tables inside, bar seats on the inside. They have a few different types of ramen to choose from with some bold/flavorful broth and light broth, few types of donburi add ons for your ramen, alcohol and desserts. Pretty small menu in my opinion, they could have added some small dishes or appetizers. The regular sized ramen was arguably enough for one, its definitely enough if you finish the soup. \n\nAnyway, I went here with two others, we ordered a Hokkaido ramen, a spicy miso chicken, and a short rib donburi. None of us were impressed. Presentation was quite deceiving; as promising as the ramen had looked, taste was lacking. I thought they used food coloring in my broth. Maybe it was a certain style, but our broth was not as bold and flavorful as the menu had promised. Not even shichimi could save it. For mine, at least the buttered corn was plump and filled with the aroma of melted butter. My ramen smelled better than tasted. The noodles were daily chewy, probably the best part of it. I was expecting the meat to be a bit more soft and tender, perhaps its just too lean if not overcooked. I tasted a piece of the beef from the donburi, it's just all sad, too tough and too overwhelmed by the sauce. The ramen had better presentation that the donburi. \n\nWith my personal preferences on thick broth, I would save my money to go to Yamadaya for a bit cheaper and more flavorful.\n\nI'm so sorry, TRB, maybe I'll return when there's major improvements.", "author": "Connie C."}

The wife ordered the mushroom ramen. Being from Seattle, we've had a lot of good ramen, and we expect there to be one star of any ramen show: the noodles. Unfortunately, those were a huge disappointment. \n\nMy shoyu broth was great. It was savory, meaty, and balanced, with a nice layer of fat on top. The pork belly was tender and delicious, and the soy-marinated egg was pretty decent. My wife's miso mushroom broth was bland and watery. It was pretty one-dimensional, and I had a hard time tasting the miso. Additionally, some of the mushrooms in her bowl were mush, and the spicy tofu she added was not spicy at all. She has no tolerance for spicy food, and even she thought it lacked heat. \n\nThe cocktail appeared to be their Japanese twist on a Manhattan. It was whiskey, bitters, Okinawan sugar, and a yuzu rind twist. That got a staggered \"meh\". It was an interesting idea, but it really wasn't anything special without the herbal taste of sweet vermouth. It was just overly sweet. \n\nSigh... let's talk noodles. To be totally frank, these were the worst noodles I have ever had in a ramen house. They had no tooth to them. They were mushy and floury. It was like slurping paste.

I choked mine down in order to get to the broth, but my wife never finished hers.

They got it to me from the Financial District to Pier 39 in about 40 mins, still warm and fresh.\n\nBUT HOLY SALT BOMB:\nThe broth was not about subtle flavors of shoyu, miso or--as advertised--ginger/clam. Instead it was stunningly, overwhelmingly salty. Seriously, my grandchildren are gonna have high blood pressure just based on that one lunch. Local deer started following me around, treating me like a salt lick. If I added chicken and a couple carrots to my bath that night it would have turned into soup ... and salty soup at that.\n\nWORSE:\nThe ramen itself seemed to be the packaged kind. C'mon ...\n\nON THE OTHER HAND:\nThe ingredients were pretty good. The seafood was fresh and abundant, veggies were crisp and the soy-flavored egg I added was very creamy and tasty. And (through trycaviar.com) I got a yummy fruit tea with the lunch.\n\nIN BRIEF:\nI love Japanese food in general, and this joint gets pretty good reviews.

Since I work pretty near here and needed to grab lunch, this was a natural choice. The set up of this place is different from most ramen places that I've been to. You order at the counter and then grab a number and hope to find a seat. I was lucky and got a seat because I went before the lunch rush, but this place does get packed pretty quickly and my seat was poached really shortly after I left so there's definitely a crowd here.\n\nI wasn't really sure what to order so I went with the recommendation of the cashier and got the ginger braised chicken. I was worried that the flavor might be too ginger strong and I'm not a ginger fan, but I was feeling a little ill so I really wanted a lighter broth and I was told that chicken was the way to go.\n\nFood came out pretty quickly. Also self service water. I got my food in maybe less than 5 minutes or so? My take. I thought that the noodles here were really fantastic. They are on the firmer side but still very chewy. I do think they could be a bit more flavorful, but at the same time with a chicken soup, it may be harder to get he flavor into the noodles. They aren't thick noodles but I think are on the thicker side so I personally liked that. Soup is meh. Didn't really love it, but could have just been a pallet mismatch. I did think it was light which is what I wanted, which is good. But I do think the ginger overpowers the chicken flavor. I could barely taste the chicken and like I said, I don't love ginger. It wasn't overwhelming and i did think it was tolerable. The chicken was definitely on the dry side. The egg was really solid though, really want to call that out. The egg was perfectly flavored and you could tell it has definitely been marinated in something so that was awesome. Great texture and flavor so I loved that.\n\nAll in all, I love that the ramen here is unique and nontraditional, but it doesn't quite hit the spot for me.\n\ntldr; decent nontraditional ramen. great noodles and egg. popular place for lunch, so get here early to avoid crowd and find seats!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

I met a friend at 11:45 for lunch and we only waited about 15 minutes in line. The interior of the restaurant is really chic and I like the outdoor seating. It was pretty crowded so we sat inside. Once we sat down our order arrived within 5 minutes, which was a nice surprise. I ordered the spicy miso chicken ramen and my friend ordered the seared beef tataki salad. My friend's salad looked really good and she enjoyed it. There was a ton of rare beef and fresh greens. \n\nI really enjoyed my ramen. I thought it was a big portion and had a LOT of stuff on it: tons of chicken, corn, and bamboo. And the egg was so good. I did, however, leave thinking \"pretty good ramen\" instead of the \"WOW RAMEN\" experience I hoping for. The broth and noodles were satisfying, but it definitely wasn't spicy, and could have used more flavor (salt/MSG/soy sauce?). My ramen came to about $15.50 with tax, which is a lot more than I typically spend on lunch. But I do understand that it's an upscale place catering to FiDi business-people who can probably eat out every day for around $20. \n\nI'm not sure I would go back, but it's definitely worth checking out!", "author": "Regina L."}

No big deal, I love me some leafy greens. \n\nWhen it arrived, it looked beautiful. Lots of vibrant color on top. Once I started to dig in, I noticed that it was completely soaked in dressing. All of the pieces on the bottom were wilted. I could only eat about half. The tofu on top was pretty tasty, but I wanted more than three pieces, especially to make up for the poor quality of the greenery.\n\nI left feeling hungry and very displeased.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-30", "description": "All wrong. This is not how ramen should be sold, prepared, consumed and the price you pay for it is not even worth the visit. \n\nThe noodles were overcooked and too small of portions. The kurobata pork had no flavor for the extra price point. The shoyu base was bland, it needed salt...and it's shoyu based....which translate to English, SOY SAUCE. $2 to add corn was ridiculous. The Chasu bowl was marginally better, but overcooked noodle pretty much ruined it. The tables were too small to hunker down and use your elbows to consume your bowl, with a giant storage box of napkins, chopsticks and wonton spoons taking over the space. \n\nAt least they had Kirin on tap. And copious amounts of hot sauce. Our waiter was also very on point, friendly.\n\nI've lived in Japan for almost a year and consumed some of the greatest bowls of ramen you can come by and have found many close to good rivals in the Bay Area. Ramen is not meant to be a high-end luxury experience. It's ramen. You go and sit down in a tiny spot, cram yourself in a chair, post up your elbows, get broth all over your face, sweat because there is no air-conditioning and the kitchen steam for noodle overpowers, let your nose run and slurp in happiness. \n\nNone of this happens at Ramen Bar. If you're really craving ramen for lunch and you work in the area, get it to go and build your own ramen-ya experience at your work desk if you must. Otherwise, save it for San Mateo, Japantown or any other hole-in-the-wall in the area you can stumble upon.", "author": "Alita M."}

My first time here was not too good, but it has gotten better. On my 3rd time (yesterday) it was with my work team to for lunch. I made a reservation for 8 people at 12pm and when I arrived to tell the host, he said we were 30 minutes late for a party of 10 that was reserved at 11:30am - they clearly had some misunderstanding on their end, but they were accommodating enough to create a table for us. I had the Hokkaido ramen and the matcha boba - the Hokkaido ramen is a little spicy and has the choice of pork or chicken, I opted in for pork. The pork was too thick and fatty, but it was flavorful. The arugula in the ramen is not the traditional way, but it didn't bother me too much. I always love the extra chili powder on my ramen for extra taste, and if your broth needs more flavor, they have the spicy paste too. My matcha boba was better on my 2nd try here, but this 3rd time it was very diluted and doesn't taste like authentic matcha.

The ginger chicken ramen, should be renamed lemon chicken ramen, is a clear thumbs down.\nOn the upside, the place has a nice layout and ambiance with outdoor seating.", "author": "Liz H."}

Once was when the company I was working for at the time, ordered TRB for our weekly lunches. It was ok, but honestly, everyone's tastebuds were probably off since it was the day right after our holiday party. I decided to give it another shot when I was craving ramen for lunch. Anyway, despite being famished, I did not find TRB's ramen to be particularly good. Is it because I'm Asian and grew up eating various ramen/noodles my whole life? I don't know. But all I know is that what I ordered was not worth $15. The broth wasn't anything special and the texture of the noodles were a bit off. Honestly, there's way better ramen places in SF/the Bay Area. I think the best part of the experience was funny/flirtatious staff. I've never heard someone attempt this \"joke\" before, but the cashier that day asked if I had an aunt, when I responded yes, he continued by saying \"Does your aunt go around saying, 'This is my niece, Denise?' \" Haha, good try, thanks for the chuckle. \n\nBefore I forget-- I must add that I did catch a glimpse of something interesting, I think I saw the words \"alcoholic boba\" at the bar area.

Locals stand waiting for a nice hot bowl of their ramen early in the morning before heading to work.  There are no seats to a small bar top table but everyone seems comfortable slurping up their ramen while standing on the curbside.  Broth so light yet brings so much depth you can taste the flavors of their ingredients that must've been brewed over fire for many hours.  The Japanese, pride principle and discipline, is intertwined with everything they do and can be felt through their craft.\n\nIf I were to compare most of the ramen joints in the bay area to my experiences in Japan, they would all get 2 or less stars.  Only a few good ones come to mind around this part of the world.  Like a glass of wine or scotch, everyone has their own preference.  So in this review I think it would be unfair to rate The Ramen Bar based on experiences from a land where the sun rises.  I won't even compare it with any ramen spots around here either since I feel that The Ramen Bar is something different.  It's kind of like that kid that didn't fit in at school but doesn't make it any less special in its own way.\n\nWhen it comes to ramen, everyone is an expert... at least that's what it seems.  I'm not claiming to be an expert but there are certain things I personally look for.  I firmly believe that a good ramen to me depends highly on the chemistry between 2 parts, the soup and the noodles.  \n\nThe soup can be any flavor... as long as there is depth from its ingredients.  My parents and grandparents always stressed that a good soup base needs to be sitting over the fire throughout the night to get flavors deeply infused into the soup... basically it takes hours.  Growing up in a Chinese family, I've grown accustomed to that method of making soup.  I can tell if a soup has been on low boil for hours or not with a quick taste.  The soup here doesn't remind me of my grandmother, my childhood, or anything I've had in my recent years in Japan.  \n\nI had the Hokkaido ramen.  Although it was quite flavorful, it was rather sharp and strong, lacking that depth and finesse that would have brought tears to my eyes with memories of my grandmother while she was still around.  The butter created a little too much oil for my likes and the chashu was a bit dry and tough.\n\nDifferent people prefer different textures and types of ramen so it's hard to say if there really is a right or wrong way these days especially if we are not going to compare directly with some I've had in Japan.  At the Ramen Bar, the noodles are gluten free... hmmmm... that makes it real hard to compare to anything for that matter so we won't.  For a gluten free type of ramen it's pretty good.  It has a denser bite and more of a chew than what I'm use to but it totally works!\n\nMost their other ingredients are good including their perfectly cooked egg with a beautiful creamy yolk.  Chashu wasn't so great as I described previously.\n\nThe Ramen Bar isn't as bad as what people make it seem though.  It doesn't help that their process of making your order looks something like the Chipotle of Ramen that showcases no special mastery.  Makes it look cheap and lack of attention to fine detail.  At the end of the day a great bowl of ramen is just using simple ingredients and make them work well together like everything else.  This place is above average so far for my first experience.  Service was attentive as well.\n\nIf I was nearby on a random night and felt like ramen I'd come here for a quick one.  As for the Japanese experience, I will be constantly reminded by the fancy decor, bustling happy hour crowd, bells of the cable cars, and the ramen I'm slurping that I'm definitely not in Japan.\n\n3.5 stars rounded up to 4", "author": "Colin M."}

I would be disappointed by this dish if it were from some hole-in-the-wall - from a Michael Mina restaurant it's just wrong.The broth was extremely oily and lacked flavor/complexity. Additionally, each ingredient was quite bland and lacking flavor. This was not a \"back to the elements\" kind of dish. It was poorly constructed and either was prepared in a rush or needs to be reworked. \n\nI work on the same block as Ramen Bar, and I always see a line out the door around lunch time.

I thought the Tokyo Style Kurobuta Ramen tasted like Japanese food. \n\nIt might be possible that the portions, sizes of each toppings, and broth fluctuate in time. When I went in about a moth ago with two of my Ramen peeps. the portion was not as small as other people described in their reviews. Maybe they increased the portion size after hearing people complained? \n\nAnd pork was very thick, and big, and drippy oily as pork should be, but not like other reviews say \"small.\" The pork in my bowl was big and thick. Egg was nice but a bit too sweet for me; perhaps accommodating to sweet pellets of Americans? Noodle was good, not overcooked and just right. Broth was okay but not great. With that price, broth could have been better. Not enough \"Dashi\" (the essence of taste extracted from stuff being cooked long hours). Now I know why Japanese (in Japan) ramen shops are small because one can cook only so much broth to serve to so many people. \n\nI also tried curry over rice. I would go to Curry House (San Francisco does not have Curry House yet) or Indian restaurant for curry. - Just not hot enough for me, and overpriced for that little bowl of rice and curry.\n\nOver-pricing: Is it because of the \"location\"? or in the name of \"Michael Mina\"? I don't know. I take one star off because of the over-pricing of food and drink. I guess only powerful restaurant group can set up the large restaurant like that in the prime location like that, and prices go up by necessity, I guess? A small cup of sweetened milk tea for $4.25 and extra 50 cents for adding boba to iced tea sound crazy to me. I suppose it's sorta typical of \"trendy\" FiDi place, but it may not fit to my wallet. \n\nI enjoyed the dining there with friends, and my Ramen peeps approve the raman in this place. It was a special outing as one of them was visiting from the other side of the continent, but if I go to the area alone for shopping or other errands, I don't know if I want to spend $30 + just for raman, appetizer, drink, and tip and spend extra time on the long line. I would rather go for more convenient and filling food that costs me less than half of this place. But I am glad I got to try this place.", "author": "Momoko S."}

Finally, I convinced Boyfriend to come with me for lunch.\n\nOrdering ahead and picking up might be the smartest option in order to avoid the lines, but the lines do move rather quickly. However, I don't like that they don't seem to really look around to determine if they have any seating available before agreeing to a diner choosing the \"for here\" option when buying food (though I guess that's kind of on the customer as well).\n\nBoyfriend and I both ordered the \"Hokkaido\" Miso-Butter Chashu ramen. However, I didn't expect that the ramen was going to be so spicy! In the menu description  of the item -- \"braised pork, garlic, sweet corn, soy-cured egg (richer, bolder flavor)\" -- nothing is said about spice! It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish eating, but it caught me off guard and was definitely more than just a hint of heat. I'm sensitive to spice, so I wish I had known, but maybe that's what they meant by \"richer, bolder flavor\"? Or maybe I'm just sensitive. Boyfriend noticed the spice in his ramen, too, and it made his nose run and he's not quite as sensitive as me. So who knows.\n\nOverall, I felt that they were pretty decent. Better than Ramen Underground on Kearny plus less of a trek to get to. They're a touch overpriced in my opinion, but if ramen is what you're in the mood for and you're stuck working in the FiDi, then I recommend coming here and trying them out.", "author": "Anna W."}

The soft boiled egg was seasoned well and balances the sweetness outside with the umami flavor seasoning and the creamy golden center. This is quite the rarity.\n\nThe meat was nice and tender, but the portions were rather small. Imagine half dollar sized pork belly and (3) 2\" discs of pork shoulder. Unfortunately, the noodles in my bowl were also very overcooked.

But I went to two Michael Mina restaurants and they were both good. This place is a lot better than I expected.\n\nThe Ramen Bar is located in the corner of a plaza. There's indoor and outdoor seating for about 60 or more. I even saw Michael Mina sitting and talking with another chef outside. The interior mostly succeeds as a high end fast food restaurant posing as faux low-end Japanese ramen shop. They have folding chairs, disposable chopsticks, and stock shelving; however, take a look at the kitchen, bathroom, and staff and you'll know what kind of place this is.\n\nThe menu is straightforward: Tokyo-style ramen, donburi, salads, and drinks. I think they have takeout items to go as well, including desserts. I ordered the shrimp and crab dumpling ramen. The wait is typical for ramen, about 6-8 minutes. I really enjoyed the ginger-clam broth even though I couldn't really taste the ginger. The noodles are good, the shrimp is good, the dumplings are good. The flavors are super clean and tasty. No faults here. I tried some of their homemade hot paste. I wished I hadn't used so much because it's quite potent.\n\nThe only thing I had a problem with is the portion size. For $16 w/o tax this is a little cray. The bowl consists of two shrimp, two dumplings, mizuna (like arugula), roasted seaweed, and sweet corn. To be honest when I eat ramen I want to be really really full. If you want additional items like extra noodles or egg, it'll cost you $2 more. Really? $2 for more noodles?? After half an hour I was hungry again. But I cannot fault the quality of the ramen. Just more please or at least more affordable additions. I assume they're aiming at the local wealthy patrons' pocketbooks.\n\nService is very nice. The women always had really big disturbing smiles on their faces and the guys were friendly enough. No problems with the staff.\n\n____\n\nI recommend this place but I would say it's a little pricey for what you get.

Did she even bother to read the order?  She does apologize, has no real excuse, then puts me on hold.   I'm guessing she's trying to find a manager.   Then a guy gets on the phone, I hear rumbling in the background, he tells me that \"they\" are extremely busy right now and cannot help me, that I need to call back, the he, LITERALLY, hangs up on me.... nice, thanks.\n\nSo to sum it up, if you don't want anything you ordered, want it late, want to deal with a RUDE counter staff and receive luke warm, not so great ramen, then by ALL means... definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed... \n\nWay to go The Ramen Bar.", "author": "Cindi C."}

I'm more forgiving towards Ramen Shop because their rotating menu is truly experimental and interesting, which I can't say for Ramen Bar.\n\nThere is some strange take-out and order ahead scheme going on here, but I've never quite figured it out.

I was aware that Ken, the chef, does not like tonkatsu broth and the noodles are Chinese-style wheat and egg noodles. I had an open mind coming here to try something different. \n\nThe first experience I had was pretty good. I ordered the braised pork belly. The service was great... yet semi uncomfortable. There was a waiter who kept coming by to chat, he was just overly-friendly. The broth was light, like I had expected. The eggs were freaking awesome. The noodles were different, but I had that expectation. It was overall a good bowl of ramen, not exactly what I expected, but decent and dare I say, delicious. \n\nToday, I returned to try something different on the menu to give it another shot. They already added a new Hokkaido (sp?) ramen to the menu, which includes corn, chashu, garlic. It was not garlicky at all... I didn't even remember tasting it in the broth. The noodles were the same, and the toppings were whatever. But isn't it the broth that makes the ramen? I don't understand. It was light as I was previously warned about... but it was just not great. \n\nI have decided this style of ramen isn't for me. The bowls come lukewarm to the table and I find myself adding a ridiculous amount of pepper and togarashi into my broth, isn't that a clue there's a problem. Thinking back to my first bowl, I did the same. Maybe my low expectations just made my first bowl \"good\".  \n\nMany might be yelling \"it's a light broth!\" but I never agreed to a bland one. Maybe it's the lack of MSG, maybe it's the fact that other ramens are just more flavorful, maybe this just falls flat... maybe it's this, maybe it's that... but the one definite I have, is that I don't plan on coming back.

I purchased the Braised Pork Belly ramen, which is prepared with a soy-based broth. The broth was rich and not too salty. The menu stated that the broth is prepared sans MSG (always, a good thing). While The Ramen Bar's broth was tasty, it wasn't rare or spectacular, in fact, the broth lacked the complex flavors found in the broth at Hapa Ramen. I would say the same is also true when compared to Waraku's broth (Must try Waraku's tonkotsu ramen!).  In my opinion, broth is the #1 disguishing factor when comparing ramen soup. A rich-bold flavored broth will keep customers coming back for more and more ramen soup! However, in all fairness, I'd like to try The Ramen Bar's miso based soup before I come to any final conclusions. With respect to the pork belly, it was not as tender or as sweet as the pork belly at the Ramen Underground but it was still pretty tasty and I would say it rivals the pork belly at Waraku. However, the soy-marinated egg, used by the Ramen Bar, does not compare to the smoked soft boiled egg at Waraku (Yum!

Like a steak house with bad steak. \n\n I might try it again but I wanted a place to make me stop hiking up to Katana-Ya (who doesn't even try tonkotsu). I don't think this is the place.

The first thing I see was a long line out to the huge sign outside. Ok, I didn't have any meetings, so I didn't have to worry about that. Stand in line, grab the menu, second thing that jumps out at me. Ohh, Michael Mina, nice. Wait, what does he know about ramen? Then, I see that it looks like he hired some Japanese guy to craft the meals. That sounds a bit better, but at this point I'm still skeptical. As I scan the menu, the next thing that catches me off guard are the prices. I know it's FiDi, but come on, this better be some damn good ramen to cost 12-16 dollars a bowl. I only know of 1 or 2 places with 20 dollar bowls, but they only make like 20 servings a day. Even the places in Japan, LA or SF bay area that I've been do not charge that much unless you add a ton of extras. It's ramen for crying out loud.\n\nThe Place:\nNice place, modern. I guess you would have to expect that much if Mina is involved. Free for all seating.\n\nFood:\nWhile in line, I grabbed the Yuzu Bars. These were good. You can't go wrong with some lemon bars made with yuzu instead. For the ramen, I ordered the Tokyo style kurobuta pork ramen, which was shoyu based broth with the typical fixings of marinated soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, fresh seaweed, a piece of nori, and some pork belly/chasu. Let's just say my rating is mainly based on the ramen itself. Full disclosure: I admit that I usually don't get the soy sauce based broth, since that's the most boring ramen broth imo. I'm a richer broth kinda guy, so shio/miso/tonkatsu are my usual broths. But this shoyu broth is blaaaannnnd. It might as well have been water. I can't remember that last time I've tried a shoyu broth that was this flavorless. The ramen noodles themselves are also not interesting either. Egg, although marinated, tastes like the pure white soft boiled eggs I make at home, bland. So that brings me to the chasu, which you can guess by now, is also a flavorless chunk of meat. That was one thing I would have expected to have been properly spiced and cooked. All these key elements of a bowl of ramen are really boring. Just \"plain\" bleh.\n\nAs a side note, I did try my friend's miso broth \n\nDrink:\nOrdered a Royal Milk Tea. 4.25?! that was the worse milk tea I've had in a while. Maybe I'm just not into the overly floral flavor of it. But still, 4.25?!\n\nMaybe I will give the donburi a try if I ever go back. Perhaps they got those right.\n\nBottom line. This is just another place opened up by a famous name and trying to ride the wave of ramen joints. There are way better ramen around the area for much more reasonable prices.", "author": "Will Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-15", "description": "Still a mixed bag -- maybe a work in progress.  Needs Improvement. \n\nThere have been a few changes since the Ramen Bar opened a few months ago; some additional soups on the menu. It also seems that they are tinkering with the flavors. I'd have to say that the jury is still out as I continue to have mixed experiences. The Ramen Bar is located close to my office, so I will likely keep tabs on it.\n\nIt's a tough act to enter at the high end price point of the market; Ramen Bar is the priciest ramen joint in town (but perhaps falling a bit short of Rockridge's Ramen Shop). At the high end, you better have a good product. Luckily for the Ramen Bar, the competition in SF is mostly not too strong (unlike further down the Peninsula). \n\nOn some early lunch visits, I found the ramen to be interesting. The broth was unique and unexpected. However, it was a bit too sweet for my taste. The noodles and contents were respectable. Portion size was small and looked funny in the bowl; which seemed too empty.  I tried a donburi once; maybe unique but pretty bad ... I can't recommend a dry donburi. Stick to the ramen.  Lunch is usually crowded and counter order; but the wait is not too long and they started opening room in Pabu next door for the overflow.  Deserts are a high point.  I keep meaning to try breakfast pastries; they coffee is good (if you ask for the expert who can make a proper cappuccino). \n\nDinner is table service; the menu is similar with a few additions. The Ramen Bar is not crowded in the evenings. The table service does not do anything to add to the ambiance and is therefor unnecessary. The decor is nice enough for a counter order place. A big sin is lack of a real ramen bar (given the name). Don't go expecting the feel of a Japanese place.\n\nService is also mixed. Some of the staff is earnest and friendly. The staff can also be poorly trained which degrades the experience. On a recent dinner visit, I found the ramen to be changed; more typical and still tasty (so that's an improvement). However, there were a series of unfortunate events; staff was slow to bring menus, the newly hired waitress was not able to answer questions about the items on the menu, the food server spilled soup on our belongings and placed the wrong orders in front of the diners, the restaurant ran out of the beer on tap that we ordered so after a delay could only bring a partial glass.  Each a little thing (the stained items being the most annoying), but adds up to a, \"needs improvement\".\n\nThe way the staff dealt with mishaps was friendly enough, but also a bit odd. In particular, they charged me full price for a partially full $6 beer and then offered a no-charge glass of the $4 draft in addition. Seems like the thing to do would have been to comp the partially full first beer and then let me order my choice if/when I want more.  \n\nA generous 3 stars at this point.\n\nKen Ken is probably still the best ramen in SF, if you can put up with the long wait and loud bar-like atmosphere. Or, head over to Ramen Shop for the high priced, not quite Japanese experience.", "author": "Jice E."}

Not very flavorful,and if you're expecting a hearty, thick-ish tonkatsu broth that you're used to, you will not get that. In fact, it tasted pretty bland. The broth is also extra oily.

There is also a glass so you can sort of see into the cooking area. I couldn't really get a good look of what was happening from where I sat. Just people cooks shuffling around. I was expecting that a Ramen Bar would have a noodle making station but I didn't see one. \n\nI really like our waitress. She was really helpful and checked in on us every so often and we never felt rushed. She was quick to help us with drinks. The Ramen Bar has soju on tap! Interesting, no?\n\nBetween my crew and I, we immediately noticed that the noodles are not fresh hand made noodles. I'm not sure why I assumed that the noodles here would be home made but it was a disappointment to me that they were supermarket noodles. I liked the soup and I wish it were warmer. It was a cold evening! I ordered the Chicken Ramen and I have to say that the meat wasn't very good. It wasn't terrible but I was hoping for better. The egg, veggies, bamboo, etc. were really good. \n\nSo, basically this place has three stars in my book because I think this place is cute, the service is good, they have soju on tap and I like the soup and veggies in the ramen.

I actually used the app to pre-order in an effort to avoid the line and save some time. Unfortunately, after walking one block with our lunch, the bag broke and pork ramen spilled all over my coworker's jacket. Since we were starving and didn't want to wait in another FIDI lunch line, we decided to go back and explain what happened. The GM Natalie handled the situation amazingly. She sincerely apologized for the accident and inconvenience. She immediately offered to remake our entire lunch and while we waited, she made us complimentary Boba Tea-Tails. She even offered to cover the cost of dry-cleaning my co-worker pork ramen saturated jacket. What started off as a frustrating and disappointing situation, ended so well. Natalie truly understands what great customer service is and I would be happy to go back for more delicous ramen again.", "author": "Michele V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-28", "description": "With the ramen hype going cray, competition for top ramen is fierce throughout the Bay Area from Orenchi to Dojo and the newcomers. The Ramen Bar is a more casual restaurant than you would consider when it comes to the Michael Mina name. You order at the counter and wait for food to be brought to you in a semi self-serve format. The ramen is not bad but lacks the touch you get at some of the smaller family spots. There are some creative options on the menu but seems overly sophisticated without the best execution. Calling this a Michael Mina restaurant would be putting lipstick on a pig. On the plus side, they have a great selection of desserts made next door which are Japanese fusion inspired.", "author": "Ed L."}

There was nothing special about their broth, which is really a distinguishing factor for ramen bars. The chicken in my ginger-braised chicken was dry at best.\n\nWhen I came here with some coworkers, the waitress wasn't even wearing anything that distinguished her as having worked there, so it was very confusing when she just came up to our table while we waited for our food and handed us napkins & chopsticks and didn't say anything! My coworkers and I all literally thought she was some rando stranger! At least have the courtesy to greet us if you're going to serve our table?!\n\nAs many others have mentioned, the $14 price tag was a huge rip-off.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-22", "description": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I AM NOT A RAMEN EXPERT! \n\nIn my endless quest for lunch in the Financial District (5 years), I was thrilled when I saw that Ramen Bar had opened up. Something new and different! I don't have much time for lunch usually so I opted to order ahead. You can order ahead through their website or you can download the app and order through your mobile. You can even specify the time you want to pick up your food! I've ordered lunch from here three times and haven't had any issues with the payment system or my order being wrong. It's easy and convenient and you don't have to wait in line with all the other schmucks. \n\nFor my first time I ordered the Tokyo Style Kurobuta Pork ramen ($12). I loved the fixings. The wakame and egg and the pork. That pork was delicious and had a great texture. I think that because I was in a hurry, the noodles didn't get enough time in the broth before I tried eating them and I wasn't a fan. They were sort of chewy and the broth didn't really get soaked up in them. Personally, this broth was too light for me. It had a good umami flavor but it was sort of one dimensional. It could have used a dash or salt or something. \n\nMy second visit I had the Beef Kare don buri (rice plate, $12) and I added an egg ($2). This is a curry dish and it's great. It's spicy and savory and filling. I was completely satisfied with that lunch. \n\nMy latest order was the Shrimp & Crab Dumpling ramen ($16). Man, that is a winner lunch right there. I felt that the broth was a little more flavorful than the Tokyo ramen one. The lady that gave me my order also recommended the chef's special spicy sauce so I tried it. It was perfect. The ramen dish had a southern feel to it with the shrimp and corn and spicy sauce. I love those flavors. This time I also ate the fixings first and let the ramen soak longer in the broth. I must also add that the takeout spoon provided has an excellent design. The edge is squared off but at an angle and it's perfect for cutting the noodles a bit. I know it's somewhat taboo to cut your noodles but when you're eating this at your desk, you don't want to be slurping noodles so this utensil is fantastic. Thank you, spoon gods! When I finally got to the noodles, they were nearly perfect. The broth had absorbed some extra flavor from the spicy sauce and it was quite wonderful. \n\nI must say that I'm a little more of a pho person and I'm partial to the rice noodles. There is just something about these noodles that I am not completely thrilled about. Maybe it's because when I order take out they keep the broth separate and the noodles don't soak up the broth long enough but, I mean how long must they soak before I like them? \n\nI'll be back and check out some more menu items. If you're coming here for lunch, order ahead. I don't want to hear you complaining if you show up at noon and you have to wait in line. Order ahead or get over it.", "author": "Daisy S."}

Went yesterday for lunch and I have not one complaint - it was flawless and so yummy! To address some common themes from recent reviews:\n\n- portion size: I'm sorry, but these portion sizes are not too small. Unless you typically eat a 5-course meal for lunch and that's your benchmark, it's plenty of food. I had the roasted chicken ramen with no extras, and I couldn't even finish the broth I was so full. Also, there was a nice amount of chicken, a whole egg and lots of yummy greens. \n\n- price: $12 for a huge bowl of delicious ramen. In FiDi. Brought to you by Michael Mina. What's the issue here? \n\n- taste: other reviews complain about the broth being either bland or too salty. My chicken broth and my husband's pork broth were neither. They were both extremely flavorful yet delicate. We both added some of the spicy paste and it added just the right amount of kick. Yum. \n\n- service/seating: there was a long line but it went fast. We went at 1pm so it was the height of the lunch rush. But by the time we ordered, there were 3 spots inside to choose from to sit. Food came out about 10 min later.

Yes it is is Michael Mina restaurant and that's part of the reason why.  His flagship is very good but I don't see him and ramen going together even if he hired an expert.\n\nThis area of California st. is not an area I venture to but since it was a meeting and the restaurant was close by we decided to try it out.  We ordered a few things to share; cha shu ramen with an extra side of pork belly, chicken donburi and the salmon salad.  The salmon salad was decently made.  Cold noodles on the bottom with greens that didn't have too much dressing makes for a good summer dish.  The ramen on the other hand was not that great (not saying disappointing because I didn't have much expectations).  I can't pin point what is wrong with the noodles but the texture and the taste just didn't feel right.  The pork flavor soup tasted and looked more like soy sauce flavor.  The pork belly were teeny tiny pieces so if you are looking for meat order the cha shu which is a larger piece of meat but was way too tough.  They did get one thing right in the ramen and that was the egg.  The chicken donburi came with diced up chicken breast meat, fried chicken and chicken meat balls.  They should turn this into a fried chicken bowl because that's really the only piece of meat that was good.  I'm really not interested in paying $12 for diced up chicken meat that was covered in what seemed to be teriyaki sauce.  The fried chicken was good enough for us to ask if we can do a side order which they were kind enough to do.  I could also have done without the chicken meatball which tasted more like a beef meatball.\n\nService was good, friendly as they allowed us to do a side order of the fried chicken and when we asked questions they were happy to answer.  The manager (I think) also asked for our feedback.  They aren't familiar with their products though as we asked them about the candy they were selling to go (looks like pate de fruits) and they told us the flavors were yuzu, orange and I think raspberry.  I've only had the white one and the orange one and the flavors were coconut and mango.  Just an fyi, the confectioneries are properly priced and are good to eat when you want something sweet so pick up one or two.\n\nIt's California street in Financial District so you're bound to be paying a few dollars more for ramen, donburi and other stuff but if I'm paying more I would like to see better quality and a little more quantity as well.", "author": "Pierre L."}

He also subbed gluten free noodles. Royal milk tea that we ordered had a cardamom flavor to it, which was good but not expected. Matcha milk tea was also good. Both might have had a little too much ice in them but it was still good tea. \n\nThe actual bowls of ramen were underwhelming. I had a taste of his broth--it was porky and sweet but had a fairly thick layer of oil on top. His gluten free noodles were more slippery feeling and chewier then the regular noodles--they are a great sub for regular ramen noodles if you have celiac (We asked and they are made in house).\n\nMy bowl of miso ramen was fairly bland despite the \"heavier style\" it is noted to have on the menu. It had little miso flavor with a slight bit of heat from some peppers as a finish. I had to doctor up the broth with a little togarishi spice and soy sauce but it still tasted bland. Noodles and egg were cooked well but the egg had a very delicate soy flavor. I wouldn't have minded if it had been flavored more strongly. The chasu was good but I have had more tender versions. The pork belly are not the cubes of soy braised meat you are used to from other place, it is actually thinly sliced and without any skin. There was little difference in taste between the pork belly and the chasu as they had the same flavor--just one has more fat. \n\nThe service from the wait staff was actually really good, but the ramen is a miss.", "author": "Crystal L."}

So when I realized the Ramen Bar had opened, I had my husband BART into the city so we could have lunch. We had a late lunch (2pm) and the outside tables were all full so we stood near them until one opened up. It's been beautiful weather lately; simply could not sit inside.\n\nI had the Tokyo Style Kurobuta Pork ramen ($12) and a glass of on-tap cold sake and my husband had the Shrimp and Crab dumpling ramen ($16) and a glass of on-tap Kirin beer. The service was prompt and he explained the condiments on the table. \n\nMy overall impression is that I think the Pho restaurant in Embarcadero 3 provides better value and I love adding fresh bean sprouts, cilantro and a squeeze of lime to the soup. The toppings on the ramen here were scant and the broth was really oily. Not sure why; I did not taste sesame so it wasn't added as a flavor. I thought it might have b/c the 2 pork slices in my soup had some fat in them but my husband's broth was oily too (his had 2 shrimps and 2 crab dumplings which looked suspiciously like fake crab was used). \n\nThe waitperson did inquire how everything was and I mentioned that, to which he responded that the broth did look more oily than usual and thanks for the feedback. But mostly, it seems like a noodle lunch, even with a whole egg in each dish. May try again to see if the salads or Donburi are better; it may not turn out to be my favorite soup place but perhaps there are redeeming dishes.

I've had ramen in Japan, NY, and around the Bay Area, and this place was a clear miss. \n\nMy bf ordered the regular tokyo-style pork ramen and I ordered their beef tataki ramen salad. \n\nFirst off, the ramen broth had a slightly sweet flavor and lacked depth and balance. Perhaps the sweetness was added to suit American taste buds, because we Americans like everything sweet, salty, or buttery!  Also the portions were skimpy, and I was very disappointed with the limited add-ons and incongruous ramen condiments. \n\nMy \"salad\" was bland and it wasn't until after I had already eaten that I was told they may have forgotten to add the dressing to the actual salad! I ended up eating some the noodles tsukemen style by dipping it in my bf's leftover ramen broth. \n\nOn a positive note, the service and the eggs were great. The eggs were soft boiled to perfection, which I appreciate. \n\nI realize that this place is new and is still probably working out a bunch of kinks. That said, I am willing to give it another try, but I will not be returning with nearly the same amount of enthusiasm as my first visit.", "author": "Cathy C."}

First off, the service was attentive and surroundings neat, clean, and orderly. I wanted to try it out due to the Michael Mina connection which in my mind = quality, flavorful, refined food. While the noodles in the Hokkaido ramen were al dente, the broth lacked depth and the chasu pork lacked punch and moisture. The pork buns were deconstructed al la' David Chang, but didn't standout. I'm half Japanese, have spent quite a bit of time in Japan, and have been to my fair share of noodle shops both authentic and experimental. Ramen Bar didn't deliver on either account and I'm not gravitating towards a repeat journey unless I hear they've improved on what should be their signature dish. I can get better a better, more flavorful bowl of noodles in Narita airport.", "author": "Lawrence S."}

So far I've tried the mushroom and soy, Chasu Miso-Butter Hokkaido and the Tokyo Style Kurobuta Pork. The Tokyo style was especially fantastic, and no surprise that's Chef Tominaga's preferred style. The broth is light yet still completely packed with flavor. What other reviewers call \"bland\" I call perfectly balanced. The broth is flavorful but does not oversaturate the other flavors in the bowl. The noodles had a good, firm texture and the soft-boiled egg tasted like it was marinated in some sort of magic sauce. So good! Very highly recommended. Oh, and get a pitcher of Kirin to (hopefully) share, nothing like a crisp lager to complement this broth.", "author": "Darren K."}

It just goes to show that a fancy venue and the name of a well know chef does not equal ramen success.  I got the miso broth which tasted terrible.  The noodles felt like they dumped spaghetti noodles from a box in the bowl and there were no green onions.  I also felt that for $15 I should have gotten a lot more and be able to choose what goes in my ramen.  Ramen Bar you you should take notes from Ramen Underground.  Their place is nothing fancy but they have really perfected the most amazing ramen and they didn't need the name of a big chef to do so.", "author": "Athena P."}

The presentation was great, but the broth was very plain and nondescript and the meat portions were pitiful (one bit of pork belly in the pork belly ramen?!?). The cured eggs were very well done, as were the noodles which were well textured and flavorful. Hopefully they expand the ramen menu in the future to include a tonkotsu because their shoyu tasted more like a weak shio. Overall I can't help but feel that they focused more on the appearance of the ramen than the flavor. Also for the price you'd expect a larger portion overall, but given their location and higher end decor it fits the bill. I was hoping for this spot to take over the ramen scene downtown but it's not going to knock the socks off of anyone who has had ramen from any of the top Bay Area spots.", "author": "Sebastian A."}

Knowing is our first time, she explains the menus choices thoroughly and she recommends the Hokkido ramen.  I have ordered that and everything is live up to expectations.

People working in the front taking orders are very friendly.
