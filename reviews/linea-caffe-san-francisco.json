The espresso was very bright, almost too forward--similar to that of a lime. The body had been pretty faint, leading straight to the finish. The end was more dark, dark chocolate--comparative to eating 85% cocoa, with a smoky after taste. I had a cappuccino to led after to see how it would hold up, the flavors had become a lot more complex being dispersed through with milk. A lot more balanced and pleasing. \n\nI was told by a friend their drip was better than their espresso? I'll have to come by again and see if he holds true with his statements.

They roast micro-batches of coffee several time every week sourced mostly from Brazil, Guatamala, Columbia and Ethiopia, which are often award winning and reserve lots.  They also feature great espresso (using their own espresso blend) - one of the best I've tried and always have their freshly brewed coffee of the day.  My favorite for making my own pour overs is from their Brazilian beans - grown by several organic and sustainable farms in Brazil.  Linea Caffe was launched by Andrew Barnett, considered by some to be a third wave legend.  Among other things, he has been a Judge at the World Barista Championship and Cup of Excellence Awards.  While they only have one location in San Francisco, they will ship freshly roasted coffee directly to you the day it is roasted.  Yum!", "author": "Eric J."}

What I hadn't immediately realised is that this wee spot actually serves food as well.  My inability to 'read' the place could be that when I visited, the kitchen was already closed and there was nary a diner in sight.  As I've never eaten at Linea, this review focuses on the espresso counter. \n\nOn my first visit some weeks ago, I ordered my go-to bev at new-to-me joints: cappuccino.  The drink was creamy, balanced & had a slightly nutty taste.  Also important: it wasn't exceedingly hot.  The kid behind the coffee counter was nice, indulged my questions about the cafe, gave good eye contact and, again, made a damn fine drink.  \n\nCoffee aside, the other half of the joint is dedicated to food prep/service.  The kitchen closes, during the week, at 15.00.  Not being hungry, I barely gave it a glance, to be honest.  However, I did spy some greens.  Based on signage, waffles would appear to be the food du jour.\n\nThis corner spot is tiny and seating is tight with one bench inside, one outside & a decent no. of outside tables--I'd say 5, or so--to boot.  I took a 'lean' at the open window with a nice view of the passersby.\n\nYesterday's second visit had a bit of a 'beardy' vibe.  The interaction was a tad more cut and dried with a no-nonsense demeanor from the other side of the counter.  This time the capp, while good, was much hotter which rather masks the flavors of the bean.  -still fine, still glad I visited. \n\nLinea's roastery is off-site elsewhere in the city.  12oz. bags of beans, different varieties, are sold at the cafe.  Prices range from 15 to 18 bucks.\n\nBonus: although it isn't listed, one can order a flat white.\n\nOnly open about a year and a half, I hope that Linea continues to do well!\n\n9.20.16--no more food prepped/served on premises save a few pastries.", "author": "Bea B."}

Yes those round tables were meant to bring happy waffle eaters together!\n\nI had the churro waffle while my friend had the bacon and egg waffle. The churro waffle didn't taste significantly like a churro but the similarities came from the cinnamon powder and cane sugar that was sprinkled on top. The chocolate icing on top made it a nice and sweet combination. The waffle itself was very light with a bit of crunch.

Amazingly friendly staff and owners, and the place feels warm. Stopped by a few weeks back on a drizzly morning and it just felt right. It was easy and only offering a few things, but that focus allows them to be the best.\n\nThe place is small, and doesn't have a bathroom, or crazy art, or books and CDs for sale, or a wall of pre-made garbage food, and there's no free wi-fi, and bla bla bla... It's minimalist. And since when do any of those things play a part in the crafting of excellent coffee? (NEVER.)\n\nTo ME, all of those things I mentioned that are everywhere else speak to the fact that you need to be distracted from the garbage in your cup. Not to say that there aren't decent coffeehouses around, in which one can camp out and \"work on their screenplay,\" but that's not what Linea is trying to do.\n\nThey are focusing on quality and they are delivering. One of the best coffee tasters/roasters/palate's IN THE WORLD (Andrew Barnett) is behind the scenes (and probably lurking around the shop), and there is serious talent going into every element of their product. From the sourcing to the roasting to the pouring to the serving to the design to the packaging. This is a crack team of people who genuinely care about, and love what they're doing... And they do it well.\n\nThe waffles are different for many folks, but again, they're not trying to replicate what comes out of your freezer and goes into your toaster, or serve you pancake batter cooked with a grid. They are taking it one step further with creative offerings; both sweet and savory. Anthony Myint is (again) bringing something new to the neighborhood. And there's definitely room for his innovations.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Pony up the extra dollar for the quality of the coffee, and another to tip the staff. It's worth it. And you deserve it.", "author": "kainoa r."}

His previous venture was at reputed Ecco Caffe which later merged with Intelligentsia. Plus, he also, judged the World Barista Championship. At this European-style caf\u00e9, the beans range from the super-sustainable (the Bob-o-Link coffee cooperative), to award-winning (the Fazenda Rainha was a seven-time Cup of Excellence winner), to throwback (Linea's Northern Italian-influenced espresso blend). This standing-room-only coffee bar focuses on espresso-based drinks, made from Linea-brand beans roasted in the East Bay and served in cheery red cups made by Cali's Heath Ceramics. Plus it's a bonus, that this cafe doubles as a waffle shop and salad bar run by one of the Mission Chinese dudes - cult-favorite chef/restaurateur -Anthony Myint. At most cafes, food is often an afterthought. Not here! The menu here seems to be meticulously curated which includes Brussels-style yeasted waffles with coconut jam, Gianduja, and macadamia nuts or egg souffl\u00e9 waffles with ch\u00e8vre and fresh herbs alongside tossed-to-order salads. \nDrink this: Brazil FAF Bob-o-Link Reserve makes a thick syrupy coffee with notes of sugarcane, honey, and cocoa nibs.", "author": "Rhea B."}

Steer clear!  We got off to a great start - the atmosphere is bright, clean, pleasant and oozes that cool, casual Mission vibe most of us love.  The barista was also very friendly, engaging and helpful with suggestions.  We ordered a cappuccino, an americano and two of the Belgian waffles - one waffle breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon, and one with yogurt and poached pear.  \n\nThen, the food arrived.   My partner's $9 waffle \"sandwich\" had 1 very small fried egg, maybe 1/2 a piece of bacon broken into even smaller pieces and a tiny bit of mustard sauce.  My equally expensive waffle had maybe 2 tablespoons of yogurt, a bit of poached pear pieces and an even smaller sprinkle of pomegranates.  We were taken aback by the paltry portions given the price, but the taste was good - a light fluffy waffle with the right crunch is not easy to come by.  However, the lack of topping left us each with more than 1/2 a waffle with NOTHING to put on it - dry, bare, nada!  My husband had 1/2 his waffle left with no egg or bacon or sauce on it at all.   We thought maybe a bit of maple syrup and butter might help us enjoy the rest of our overpriced breakfast.  I went in and asked the cook if we could have a bit of maple syrup and she said \"Sure!\" but that she \"had to charge $1 for syrup.\"  What?  We just spent $25 for two coffees (the cappuccino was $4, also the most expensive I've yet seen in our neighborhood), and two waffles.  \n\nSTINGY. EXPENSIVE. Not right!  Those waffles should have been $6.50, maybe $7 or if not, then served properly - two eggs, a slice or two of bacon and a side of the mustard sauce, a portion of yogurt and fruit that allowed the waffle to have bits of topping on most bites.  I expressed surprise to the chef for the upcharge, and also told her we would not be returning.

Not a bad waffle egg sandwich, but considering it's literally about four bites of food, there's better things to be done with $8. Same goes with the $3 coffee served in an artisan one-inch thick mug that leaves about 3 ounces of space for the contents. Be careful cutting your waffles on the flimsy tables outside, because your coffee will spill and the chair may collapse. Friendly service, though. Also like the paperless receipt.", "author": "Ben R."}

It's a small place so be prepared to snipe a table or stand at the little window counter thing. Pleasant service, cozy atmosphere.", "author": "yoon p."}
