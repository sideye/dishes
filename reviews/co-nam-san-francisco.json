TLDR; good atmosphere, food was ok \n\nIn terms of apps, the roti was good though the garlic sauce was quite strong (careful not to scoop too much as I generally do with dipping sauces), the chicken skewer was actually very good, but the buns were disappointing. Papaya salad was not what I expected... was very dry and lacked much flavor. \n\nAs for entrees, well the pho was... pho. Can't say it had much going for it, but it was inoffensive. The combination stir fry was about as good as a regular Chinese takeout, which certainly isn't bad but probably not worth the price tag here.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor is quite nice, and probably the best part of the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-27", "description": "This is decent Vietnamese food and certainly a cute spot with respect to size / decor, but I would definitely treat this as a \"neighborhood spot\" - come here if you live around here, but don't travel out of your way for it.\n\nLast night, two of us split the roti with curry sauce, wicked buns, garlic herb noodles, a special sausage appetizer (not on the online menu), and the basa fish claypot.  There was an attempt to also have the crispy rolls, but the waiter sort of messed that up, per the below...  All of the food was fine to good.  The roti was really tasty, though the curry sauce was sort of too sweet and grainy (not sure why re: texture).  The wicked buns were OK, but they could have used some mayo or spice to balance out the sweet glaze on the meat, and the buns themselves were a bit stale / hard.  The garlic noodles were also on the sweet side, and not terribly garlic-y.  They were also lukewarm, at best.  The sausage was....again...kind of sweet and generally fairly bland, and it was served with an even sweeter sauce that neither of us liked.  Finally, the claypot was ALSO sweet, but at least in this case I was expecting that.  \n\nMan, looking back now....this was a very \"sweet\" dinner.  I think everything could have used more spice or something umami, like more fish sauce?  But it was all edible, just not amazing.  I think the fish was the best part and it seems to be their most popular dish, so if I did go back, I'd probably order that again.\n\nService was....not amazing.  At around 8:30pm on a Wednesday, the service was overly-harried given how (not) busy they were.  The restaurant was about half full and I didn't see any type of to-go / delivery orders being sent out, so I'm not sure why the staff was so neglectful of their tables.  The person who took our order not only messed it up (he apparently put in our full order, but then decided that he had gotten it wrong....even though he had not...and sent one of our items back to the kitchen???), but he also never came back to help us ever again.  We were waited on, for the rest of the evening, by a quasi waiter / quasi host that seemed completely overwhelmed...and his version of waiting on us was purely dropping off food.  No one asked us how we were, did we want another round of drinks, etc.  I probably would have ordered a second glass of wine if I were able to flag someone down.  As it was, we didn't get any place settings / utensils until after our first dish had arrived.\n\nI will say that they have a pretty impressively broad wine/beer/sake selection for a restaurant this small and they've laid their wine list out in an interesting way, though I wasn't blown away by any particular wine option.\n\nAgain, this is certainly a step above a lot of processed, Americanized Vietnamese food that you can find, and a cute neighborhood spot for dinner....but not worth a special trip.  Maybe not worth a trip, at all, if you prefer spicy food...", "author": "Tay H."}

Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, March 9th around 12:30pm.\n\nI got their Pho: Your choice of beef or chicken with vietnamese rice noodle soup, scallions, white onions, and cilantro ($15.50). I'm a #1 kind of girl, so I got the beef version. The broth had a good amount of meaty flavor, but the portion was tiny. And for $15+, I would have expected at least twice the amount of noodles given. If you are actually hungry, this will leave you wanting more. Like a second bowl of pho. I did ask for extra limes, jalapenos, and hot sauce. I got the limes and hot sauce as I don't think they serve jalapenos with this dish. The hot sauce provided was a small portion, so I was glad I have a huge bottle of sriracha at my desk.\n\nFlavor wise, I enjoyed the soup. But for the price, I would expect a bigger bowl of pho.

We love their rice bowls and the crispy rolls are amazing.\n\nI had their angus burger yesterday and was pleasantly surprised at how amazing it was. The burger itself was seasoned perfectly. It was a little too medium for my taste. Medium here is probably a tad bit more rare so next time I'll probably ask for it well done. This bun was buttery with the right amount of crunch to it and the umami sauce was yum!!!! \n\nThe truffle fries are never a disappointment, I just wish you got more! \n\nPricing is a bit steep in my opinion. $26 including tip for a burger, fries, and drink (no refills) is a bit much. The soft drinks are very watery with very little fizz so I'd probably stick with an iced tea or sparkling water.  Service is so-so.  Once you get your food no one checks in to make sure everything is okay or to see if you want refills, napkins, etc.\n\nWhy the low stars if the food is good?  For one, service needs a little work.  If it is too busy for one person to work the floor, get some extra help.  Also, when I checked my bank account on Sunday I noticed my card was charged twice.  I reached out to Co Nam twice to get more information and to make sure the extra charge was cancelled and each time I was told the Manager would give me a call. By Wednesday, the extra charge was removed but I never received such call from the Manager, which in my opinion just shows poor customer service.\n\nI won't be back!", "author": "Sabrina J."}

I asked for no toppings (no onion, scallion, bean sprouts,etc.) and extra noodles.  They said okay and came back saying it would be an additional $5.00 charge for the few extra noodles.  Okay, that's fine.  I'll do it because sometimes it's not enough.  \n\nI got my soup and there were no extra noodles (or enough extra noodles for what I imagined for $5.00).

I didn't take a picture of what it usually looks like, but I did of what it looked like today.  \n\nI called the restaurant because I believed they forgot my extra noodles, but still charged me.

I also looked to make sure there were extra noodles so I don't know how many noodles you were expecting.\"  Okay, thank you, but I wasn't asking you to defend yourself or be so condescending.... and please don't call me Dear to make it seem like I'm your child.

No gamey or weird after taste. \n\nBONE MARROW: At anytime I see roasted bone marrow on anyone's menu, I get it. This was a bit of a downer because there wasn't enough marrow for the amount of baguettes that came with it. Hardly worth the price. \n\nENOKI MUSHROOMS: Who doesn't like anything bacon wrapped?! If you're a mushroom fiend, get this! Delicious! \n\nCRISPY PIG EAR: It really lives up to its description. They are thinly sliced, thinly battered and deep fried. Seasoning was perfect and it wasn't greasy at all. And that CRISP! It went really well with my beer! \n\nBEEF WRAP: Not too impressed with this one.

Finally, a minute before we were going to walk out, they brought us our food. But they didn't even get the orders right - they made the non-vegetarian version of a dish for someone who ordered the vegetarian version, and they brought us a dish that was meant to go to another table! They tried to make up for their misses by giving us the tiniest possible appetizer, which was definitely not enough for 5 people. I think the service at this place is best summarized by the words that were on the back of our waiter's t-shirt: \"I'm not listening.\" This was the worst service I have ever experienced, and the food was not especially good either.

I wouldn't mind the slices being so thick and large, IF the meat was tender enough to bite through. I felt like I was playing tug-of-war with a beef tongue.  Also, they only provided one small piece of the pig's ankle, which is a staple for the dish.

This will never stop me from going here, because Co Nam is great, but I think they can do a wee bit of work on their table service.", "author": "Meredith R."}

The draft beers selection is among the best. La Fin du Monde, Monk's Cafe, Allagash Curieux....shall I keep going..these are craft beers, among the best. They also have an amazing bloody mary that will make you wanting another. They wine selections, red and white awesome. I've even see several sake brands that are also premium.\n\nThe app menu is wicked, hearts, liver, squid, mushrooms, all prepared in a tasty flamed method. The breakfast, I know is great because I can hear everyone talking, eating and laughing it up. I absolutely love their noodle bowls. It comes with either chicken, beef or pork. It is so yummy, and addicting and delicious that you'll be craving it soon enough.\n\nThe service and servers are wonderfully kind, knowledgeable and super approachable. They personally cater to each and every guest regardless of age, gender or drunkness (kidding about the last one). I always feel so VIP when I drop in every Saturdays.

I really wanted to like it, but I've experienced better.\n\nService:\nThe service was friendly, but painfully slow. We had to ask for water. We had to ask for refills. We had to ask about our food.We had to ask for our check... twice! It felt like we had to check-in on the status of everything. In short, the service was friendly, but not attentive or proactive.\n\nFood:\nThey have a full menu and then a \"street food\" menu that they recommended for quicker eats. To start I ordered the \"shishito peppers\" but found out they were all out. The server recommended we try the veggies, so we got that. When they came out my first reaction was \"is this it?\" to which the server said yes. I wish I took a picture because it was the saddest display of veggies ever. Imagine having 2 green beans cut into a few pieces and then maybe 1 piece of asparagus. Then it was placed on a skewer. It tasted amazing... which I'll give them, but the portion was TERRIBLE for a price of around $4 for the item. If they revamped the menu to lower the price OR increase the portion this would be better. The taste was awesome, but you don't get a good value in portion size.\n\nFor my entree I opted to get a vermicelli bowl with pork and added the fried egg and egg roll. I was a little surprised that the fried egg and egg roll didn't come with the bowl, especially since the price of the bowl was around $16 -- the egg roll and fried egg were about $2 extra (each). The pork was seasoned really well and tasty, but overall I thought the bowl lacked enough lettuce. The presentation was nice, but for the price I think they should include an egg roll and fried egg with the meal.\n\n\nDrinks:\nI didn't order any cocktails, but did have to ask for water, and our first two refills. I also ordered a coke, but didn't realize refills weren't free. I'm not sure if they're using a mexican coke, but the glass is super small. The server was very nice and let me know that normally refills were charged the full price of another drink, but since I didn't know he wouldn't charge me for the 2nd one. I appreciated this... but think if they're going to charge for each glass they should just bring the bottle/can to you so you know you're getting the entire thing. I don't feel like the glass they gave me was a full 12 oz beverage.\n\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this place (off of this first time visit), nor would I return here. I kept wanting to like the restaurant, but felt like they were failing big time... and it wasn't even packed! Since I was out of town visiting, I'm not sure if this was just an off night, which every place can have, or if this was their typical routine. Some of the flavors in their food were awesome, so I don't think the food is the problem... but they should definitely work on ironing out the other kinks.", "author": "Ishea B."}

We unanimously decided on Vietnamese and out came the various review apps. Simultaneously we decided on Co Nam (which was also still a hike away, and with many intriguing spots, but we were dead set).\n\nWe arrive a little after one and the place is dead, but the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, pointing out that while they were still in brunch mode (served until 3, and offers bottomless mimosas), lunch was an option as well.\n\nBoth menus were very impressive and a group could go with small plates and get a lot of variety (pork crispy rolls, shrimp crispy rolls, shrimp fresh rolls, etc.). And with all the variety - we all got noodle and rice bowls.\n\nFor what it is worth, I really enjoyed the pork belly rice bowl. The pork belly was incredibly tender, easy to break into smaller pieces with chopsticks, but YOU MUST pour that pork belly sauce on it. Wow, was that full of flavor (and most likely delicious fat). And you can add a crispy roll ($2) or an egg ($1), which isn't too bad and well worth it.\n\nRetouching on variety is the drink menu. While they had an impressive tap and bottle selection for beers (including some of the less common Asian beers), after all the walking a beer didn't sound all that great. But a mojito did, and they had a selection of those as well. Had to go with the passion fruit and it was worth it (although the bar tender mentioned he wasn't the normal bar tender, he did an excellent job). My friends also enjoyed their bowls - the vegetarian got the brussel sprout chips for his and said they made the bowl even better.\n\nAlso worth mentioning: the living wall behind the bar, the great views you get when walking past the kitchen to the restroom (I wanted to grab the pork belly, it was right there) and the sweet faucet in the bathroom. Hey, sometimes things catch your eye.\n\nI would like to return here for either a more traditional brunch or dinner.", "author": "Michael C."}

The new guy (I'm assuming) claimed that we could only have raspberry mimosas since that was the first one we ordered but she came up and asked if we wanted raspberry, orange or grapefruit, grapefruit being the best. Lastly, Right before the time ran out for bottomless mimosas, she came up and informed us that it was ending and I, being slight buzzed at this point, mentioned for her to surprise us with the flavor of our last carafe, which she made a mango mimosa!

Having read the fairly harsh reviews from my fellow Yelpers I was quite concerned I had booked a reservation on Opentable. There were highlights and lowlights but from an upscale Vietnamese restaurant perspective I thought it was tasty.\n\n* BRAISED PORK BELLY ($ 8) - 4 STARS:\nServed with a cashew nut garnish. It was tender, fatty and flavorful - I just wish there was more.\n\n* CRISPY SPRING ROLLS ($ 8) - 3.5 STARS: \nChicken, shrimp, wood-ear mushroom, glass noodle, carrot, jicama, nuoc cham. I'm not sure I tasted any of the ingredients listed, but I did notice that the spring roll was fresh out of the fryer, perfectly crispy and piping hot. This was a great way to start the meal.\n\n* BEEF CARPACCIO ($ 14) - 2 STARS:\nFilet mignon, rau ram, mint, crispy shallot, red onion, cashew, nuoc cham. The preparation from the menu description sounded on point, but unfortunately the odd text of the extra thick cut raw beef was not appetizing to me. The extra ingredients were not enough to counteract the feeling that I was biting straight into a live cow. Not my cup of tea.\n\n* BASA FISH CLAYPOT ($14) - 4 STARS:\nBraised basa fish, carmelized with black pepper, Thai bird chili and scallion. Basa is a hearty white fish which stands up well against the very flavorful, slightly sweet and thickened Thai/Viet style sauce. I liked that it was hearty, yet not dry. They have a version with chicken.\n\n* SHAKEN BEEF ($21) - 4 STARS:\nFilet mignon cubes, green onions, sauteed in garlic pepper sauce, organic baby watercress, lemongrass viniagrette, salt and pepper lime dipping sauce. Super tender, flavorful but a bit on the expensive side. I'm happy with Bodega Bistro's which is just as good and cheaper.\n\nI'm generally not one to gravitate towards the upscale Vietnamese restaurants since they are on the expensive side and don't always serve something unique or worthwhile. I still love Tin for their Bun Bo Hue and Pho, and Slanted Door for their crab vermicelli, but I really enjoyed Co Nam for the Basa Claypot.

And there's quite a sink in the men's room. It's a huge stone rectangle with multiple layers in the basin. Bold shades of blue, green and teal on each layer (photo: http://bit.ly/1b8cX29). I remember washing my hands thinking maybe it's meant to evoke the rice terraces in North Vietnam since the painting on the back wall picks up the same patterns. Or maybe there was a sale on really ugly sinks at Home Depot. But that's the kind of design decision that informs this hipster-heavy Vietnamese spot on Polk. It's not that far from Little Saigon, but it might as well be in another dimension for all it has to do with those family-run places.\n\nNo, Co Nam is brought to you from owner Kiet Truong who owns Unicorn (pretty good - my review: http://bit.ly/1e4VBEu) and Region (pretty dismal - my review: http://bit.ly/1g3eCDU). Co Nam is somewhere in between food-wise but definitely in the same family as the other two when it comes to slightly overdone, swank decor. I mean, just look at that sink.  The menu is described as rustic Vietnamese (photo: http://bit.ly/1g3e68Z), but I'm not sure what that means when everything is so impeccably presented on small plates. I decided to try two appetizers instead of an entree just to experience more culinary variety. First up was the $8 Garlic Herb Noodle which was stir-fried in Parmesan cheese and fried shallots (photo: http://bit.ly/18WkKtM). It was no match for Perilla, something tells me the Parmesan cheese is not an authentic touch.\n\nMy second dish was the $8 Braised Pork Belly with Cashew Nut Garnish (photo: http://bit.ly/1g3dMHb). You don't have to twist my arm to eat pork belly, but five slices seemed a bit on the skimpy side, and frankly the ground cashews were an unnecessary touch. I made room for dessert, and the $7 Mango Sticky Rice was topped with chopped fresh mango and cashews and accompanied by a shot of coconut creme (photo: http://bit.ly/1b8dlOd). I liked it, but there wasn't nearly enough of it to satisfy, so I completed the meal with a soothing $7 pot of the Dragon Pearl Jasmine Tea (photo: http://bit.ly/14HuNHh). That did the trick. The service, by the way, was quite attentive without being intrusive. Maybe another visit would make me swoon over the place, or maybe I'll just hang out in the men's room.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Vietnamese fare targeted to a hipper crowd\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...that sink!\nSERVICE - 4 stars...here is where they excel\nTOTAL - 3 stars...but the food does not\n\nP.S...Subsequent to my review, the current owner pointed out to me that Co Nam is under new management and no longer associated with Kiet Truong.", "author": "Ed U."}

The food was excellent, with each dish having very distinctive flavors, nothing over-powering other dishes. We had a combo of what they call \"Street Food\", which is basically small bites/tapas, papaya salad and entrees. The street food we had included shrimp lollipop (very flavorful), enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon (yummy) and roti (a bit greasy, not the best I've had). The entrees we had included shaking beef (very tender and juicy) and lemongrass chicken (very flavorful), the latter of which was served on a bed of white rice. \n\nThe portions are on the small side for everything, except for the lemongrass chicken entree, which was why the two of us had to order so much food to feel satisfied. Each shrimp lollipop was one ball, so we had to double the order for each, i.e., 4 total. The bill came to just under $90 for the two of us without drinks, so definitely not a cheap eat. However, there are cheaper menu options, if you want to spend less than we did. Our server was very attentive, filling our water glasses very frequently, and another staff member promptly took care of an error on the bill. We liked the ambience a lot, too.

This included some pork spring rolls and some Vietnamese street food. Holy fucking shit the spring rolls were fantastic. They were incredibly fresh tasting and balanced with this dipping sauce that was equally fantastic. The street food was several meats and some green onions skewered and cooked up. Pork, chicken heart, something wrapped in bacon, and green onions. Another fantastic treat.\n\nBoth my homegirl and I decided upon vermicelli bowls. She got the chicken. I got the BBQ pork. Neither of us made the wiser decision as they both absolutely tremendous. Super flavorful, and incredibly fresh tasting ingredients. It looked as good as it tasted, so much so the table next to us saw what we were eating, asked what it was, and ordered the exact same thing.\n\nWe also ordered some cocktails while there, the spicy ginger one, the mojito, and I forgot the other two now. I think I got one that was elderberry. A different waiter said the top three drinks on the menu were the most OG drinks on the menu. The cocktails were pretty good, but something is always lost in translation across the use of sake/soju instead of classic liquors.\n\nThis was probably the best dining experience I've had since living in the city. I hesitate to say you'll find a better experience nearby, if at all.", "author": "Jim B."}

And then, once we saw the dessert menu, we had to get the fried banana with ice cream and the mango sticky rice  along with a couple of hot Vietnamese coffees -- we loved both these desserts!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-29", "description": "We came here during a recent trip to San Francisco since we were in the area and it was one of the few places open around Christmas that had pretty good reviews. We took note of some of the negative reviews and so we came in with slightly lowered expectations. Unfortunately, we'd still have to give this place only 2 stars.\n\nService: The staff was friendly enough and welcoming (as is the case with most San Francisco establishments), however, the service was incredibly slow and inefficient. Perhaps they were understaffed for the holidays, but the waiter/host took a little under 10 minutes to seat us in 1 of several open tables. He chose to spend a lot of time taking the orders of other customers who clearly were not yet ready instead of taking a mere 10 seconds to seat us. We also had to ask for water 3 times before someone brought us our glasses and a few more times in order to get refills. They were also quite inefficient in that each server could only seem to do 1 thing at a time (for example, instead of taking away empty appetizer plates along with serving the main course, they went back and forth multiple times to do each task separately).\n\nFood: The portions were relatively large for the price. My fish pot was okay. It was a little too salty but had a good amount of spice and flavor. The pho that my girlfriend ordered, however was definitely not authentic. It tasted as if it were made with artificially flavored powder packages (similar to what you'd find in ready to eat cup noodles). It was definitely a disappointment and not something I'd recommend off the menu.\n\nAmbiance: The place was very clean and the decor was pretty contemporary, which contrasted with the old cutout photos and magazine pages of Vietnamese culture taped along the main wall of the restaurant. \n\nOverall, I can't recommend this restaurant as there are several other places around the area with Viet cuisine. Just make sure that those other places are open.", "author": "Russell M."}

My bf and I were intrigued by the sign that said \"Rustic Vietnamese food\". It was still happy hour (4-6 PM) when we walked in so we ordered some drinks and skewers off of the Vietnamese Street Food menu. That menu alone is quite unique and something I have not seen before. The skewers had about 5-6 pieces of meat on them and ranged from $3-5. The calamari was cooked perfectly and not overly chewy. The chicken hearts were BOMB! For those that might be scared to try them, they taste nothing like liver or other organs but have a milder flavor more reminiscent of the dark meat of a chicken. Must try! I also ordered the ginger cocktail ($2 off during HH) and it was refreshingly spicy and citrusy but also strong as hell.

I showed up at 7:45pm and the woman near the entrance told me to wait at the bar because my food was not ready yet. I waited for 15-20 minutes and she finally gave me my food. I took it home and the broth was luke warm and did not cook the raw beef in the soup, making it inedible. I called the restaurant and spoke to Henry and he said I would need to go through the app to receive a refund. When I did, the app's customer service rep said they contacted the restaurant and they would not be refunding me. I called Henry back and was yelled at by him saying that he did not remember seeing anyone waiting and the food was ready at 7:40pm so it is not his fault that it was cold.

Chaos is the only way I can describe how the restaurant was managed - people next to us got their order messed up so they waited another 20 minutes to have it fixed.  The other table waited at least 10 minutes before the lone waiter brought them the menu and that's only because the patrons asked.  People were seated out of sequence.. the food was taking a long time for every table but we knew something was wrong when people who were seated at least 25 minutes after us got their appetizer.  \n\nWhen we called the waiter over to check on our order, and his answer was \"so what are you waiting for?\" Really?!  After we told him to go check the computer and that's when he told us that the order was never entered.  Granted he said he will bump our order to the top of the line, but given that the next table waited for 20 minutes to have the correct food delivered,  we know that top of the line doesn't mean very much and left.\n\nThe waiter's excuse is that they got busy.

We were first a group of 6 which became a group of 10. \n\nAll the tables were occupied already with the exception of a couple that had the \"reserved\" sign on it.  We said we had no reservation but they didn't turn us away. I was immediately impressed. He took a few minutes to review his reservations for the night and ended accommodating us! \n\nWe all enjoyed our orders.  Lots of yums going around the table.  I personally had the beef carpaccio & garlic and herb noodles.\n\nBeef carpaccio: surprisingly good.  Beef seemed \"fresh\" with the correct carpaccio texture. Good balance of acid, sweet and savory. My husband agreed it was very good and he's not huge on raw beef.\n\nHerb garlic noodle: very tasty. Not too garlicky. Good flavor.  Good chewy noodle texture. Very satisfying. \n\nOthers had noodle bowls (some had beef, chicken, and veggie).. All said good. All bowls empty.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention the drinks... I had the elderflower martini. Made with soju and sake. Very light and refreshing. Strong enough to do its job :). Now one of my favorite drinks.", "author": "kate w."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-22", "description": "Super Average. The rating is actually a 2.5. Let me break it down.\n\nDecor: Starting with the best here. The decor is very nice. A perfect blend of Vietnamese decorations with a modern decor. Simple yet comfortable seating.\n\nBar: Good effort. Didn't try the cocktails. But the beer selection is a wide range. But that's really yet. If you are serious about your beer, you know this is probably not the place to come to. They have a selection, but any beer connoisseur would quickly dismiss it as mediocre. They're IPA's especially are weak. \n\nService: Again, good effort. Very friendly service and happy to help and make you feel welcomed. But, don't expect great service. To give you an example, if you order two dishes which are pretty much the same, don't expect them to point it out. To give you another example, if you order a dish such as veggie chips, don't expect them to point it out while ordering that it indeed has fish sauce. There's definitely potential here for great service. It's just not there yet. \n\nFood: This department was unfortunately the least impressive. I like fusion, when in fact there is really some fusion. Here is it basically vietnamese food taken down a notch in flavors, spice etc. I would say its vietnamese Americanized rather than any Vietnamese fusion. Some of the dishes we ordered tasted pretty much the same served differently. The whole heart and soul of vietnamese food was missing. Also, don't order the iced coffee expecting the nice little drip. This iced coffee is more...think Iced mocha at Starbucks. Literally the only dish that tasted good, actually great were the chicken wings which luckily was the first one at the table. So that made the evening not so bad. It was all downhill after that and came crashing down when we got the bill. ~$30 per person for which we could have eaten three meals at a great vietnamese restaurant. \n\nIn summary, i'll definitely come back when maybe someone tells me its changed drastically or if somehow I become the kind of person who wants to eat vietnamese food but scared to go to some place in the outer richmond or little saigon. But not for now.", "author": "Karthick S."}

According to elite Yelper friend Peter L who has the better knowledge of the cuisine, he stated the food was authentic and home style as we were enjoying the dinner.\n\nQuick note on the name. It's actually Co Nam but Yelp has it spelled as Conam.Was not able to find the restaurant directly on Open Table but the link from Yelp was correct. So take note if you try to make a reservation.\n\nBeef carpaccio was crisp and refreshing with very thinly sliced chilled and very red beef, laid out beautifully like a piece of art with scallions, and strips of mint leaves.\n\nThe claypot fish was excellent, a Vietnamese signature dish well made.\n\nSweet and sour soup was not the Chinese style. It had more of a sour taste that kicks up your appetite and was actually a clear soup.\n\nThe green beans, spring rolls and sauteed beef were all tasty and tasted very home style cooking..\n\nThe alcoholic drinks here were on the slightly sweet side but you can definitely still taste the alcohol.\n\nThe dessert soup was more of rice pudding with taro cubes mixed in it. It was a very warm dish and was very tasty without being too sweet. Definitely a great highlight.\n\nThey also served house made Vietnamese yogurt with raspberry as well as blueberries. Each was chilled in a concealed container. It tasted more like a Greek yogurt, as Peter has suggested.\n\nThe hot banana cakes was warm and delicious. Of course a Vietnamese meal is not one without a Vietnamese style coffee. And it definitely was a good drink to keep me wired for the rest of the evening out!\n\nService was very nice and our server was very humorous and tried to answer any questions we had, especially on the restaurant name.", "author": "T L."}

You had to mix some sauce with salt and pro it over and even then it's still confusing and why would you want to stir fry filet mignon till it's grey?\n\nI had an interesting experience in the bathroom where they had a sink hole strain/drainer that was plugged up and caused standing water in the sink.  The drainer looked like someone had puked in it so I had to let the manager know about that.\n\nThey seemed to have spruced up the decor compared to the previous Moroccan restaurant that was there but you can see it was a minimal investment.  \n\nLook, will this place stay in business? I think it will, at least longer than the previous two restaurants at that location.  What bugs me is that it's just mediocre food at jacked up prices in a hip decor so it will attract a young Polk Street crowd.  I'd be off elsewhere before I come back here to again.", "author": "Favoloso M."}

AMIRITE?\n\nI battled with what rating to give this place, but ended at a 2.\n\nThe food and decor was nice enough, but a fundamental service error really took over the whole experience.\n\nA group of us ordered the 'selection of rolls' entr\u00e9e and my friend confirmed when ordered, and when placed on the table that they didn't contain shellfish as he is allergic. I was in another conversation and saw him eating the crispy rolls that I remember on the menu saying they had shrimp in them.\n\nThere was obviously a bit of concern at this point, as a shellfish allergy isn't like a headache, it leads to hours of vomiting. We told the next waiter who came over about the error, and he said sorry it is her first night. (Which didn't actually seem to be true because she knew the menu back to front and took our oder for 7 people without writing anything down). He then asked if we wanted to order something else (LOL). They made no compensation for a pretty massive error. \n\nIt's important to note this wasn't a picky SF eater - we weren't requesting kale grown while having nursery songs played to it, its a stock standard allergy and something restaurants should really be competent at dealing with!", "author": "Mitchell S."}

The very first thing she uttered on clearing the doorway of Co Nam was truly high praise:  \"This place has the best look of any restaurant I have seen in this city.\"   \n\nThe look was composed of several distinct features: a lush, deep brown wood slat wall on one side; a beautiful three-dimensional (living?) green wall in the back that was cut into a pattern resembling the aerial view of Vietnamese rice terraces; and a diagonal array of old portrait and landscape postcards on the wall behind the tables.  Even the sink in the bathroom was unique, as the bowl was carved into the shape and painted the colors of rice terraces.  I have a special fondness for rice terraces.  One of my companions thought the sink was impractical:  Oh well, it worked for me, putting form over function.\n\nThe food here is solid as well, offering pleasantly divergent renditions of classic Vietnamese cuisine.  Take the cool and fresh spring rolls packed with shrimp that had been grilled on sugarcane, a truly sublime preparation that I make a bee-line for each time I go Vietnamese.  We loved our bun, a large bowl of rice noodles buried under a plentiful portion of grilled pork and topped generously with the requisite julienne of carrots and cucumber and crushed peanuts, all doused in nuoc cham.  \nOur second entree, a chicken and green bean stir fry with ginger and coconut, had great promise but underwhelmed us due to the insufficiently aromatic sauce.  \n\nOther menu items that looked good but didn't make the cut on our first visit included the grilled mussels and the banh mi.

My girlfriend and I popped in here for a quick brunch. With the restaurant less than half filled, we were promptly seated and waited to quite attentively. We ordered the beignets and Vietnamese iced coffee which were quite good. Things quickly went downhill after this however. \n\nWe ordered the Bun Bo Hue and the chicken rice bowl with a crispy roll on top. They ran out of Bun Bo Hue -- no big deal, we substituted with a banh mi. After about 30 minutes of no food, we started noticing that guests who were seated after us were being served. It was then that the waiter informed us, unapologetically, that the kitchen lost our ticket and to reconfirm our order. That's it. No \"I'm sorry for keeping you waiting\" or anything. \n\nAnyways, at this point we're still trying to be understanding. Things happen, we'll just be patient. Our food finally came out after an additional 30 minutes and our patience (and hunger) was just about to give out. Again, fine; things happen we just wanted to eat and get out and on with our day at this point. However, the chicken rice bowl with crispy roll on top that was given to us was neither a rice bowl (had vermicelli) nor did it have a crispy roll. You would think with an hour plus to get the food out you would at least check to see if the order was correct. \n\nI'm just frustrated at this point and try to grab the attention of the waiter, who takes his sweet time getting here. I explain that hey, the order was wrong, it's been an hour plus since we got here and I just want to pay for the beignets and leave. Again, the waiter was very unapologetic and gave excuses that the kitchen staff has language barriers and that brunch was very busy -- it was less than half full when we got there!! I'm just so livid at this point I have lost all appetite completely. We left without even touching the food, the only small redeeming portion of this experience was that we were given a comp on the coffee and beignets. \n\nI'm very frustrated because all the other reviews indicate great service and food, and the food really did look delicious!

The bartender was knowledgeable about their cocktails (and every liquor/spirit/sake they carried) and was quick to produce them. \nBut then...oh boy, my food came :) Smelled just as I was imagining it to be.

We had the shaken beef and the lemongrass chicken. My main food gripe was that my shaken beef was room temp by the time it got to me. Normally I would have sent something like this back to the kitchen but that would have meant I would be left wondering if I would ever get my dish back. Service was horrendous and I really don't know what was the cause of it. Lack of anticipation of how busy it was going to be? Staffing issues? The poor lone waitress and lone bartender were busting their butts and serving the entire restaurant. It's not a huge establishment but we waited forever to place our order. And to get our drinks. And to get our food. I asked for the bill right away not knowing when I'd be able to flag the waitress down. No one ever checked on us during our meal. The hubI would have gladly ordered more drinks. The waitress was obviously very stressed and short with each interaction she had with us. \n\nOh, and if you have kids, leave them at home. The place isn't very kid friendly. In other words, no high chairs.

The food we had was just good (the bun bo hue) and OK (the basa claypot,taste was fine but fish was too soft and gooey), but the price would suggest better than good vietnamese. $15 for a bowl of bb hue, when i can get a bowl that's just as good at Pho Vietnam just down the street for about half that. So you know, we eat Vietnamese frequently and last year went to the source. So we know street vs upper end, etc. The issue with Co Nam now is it's caught in the middle. If they want to nail the mid-scale then the food needs to be both better than and more creative than the very high quality traditional (and cheaper)  fare you can get at Pagolac, Pho Vietnam (esp the soups), and Golden Star (killer 5-spice chicken, etc). \n\nTo calibrate, if the price was cheaper and the food the same, they'd get 3 stars.", "author": "Eric T."}

The pan seared Basa turned out to be a deep fried piece of fish covered with a thick tomato and onion topping that had the flavor of frank and beans.  The pork spring roll starter - meh - nothing out of the ordinary except the lettuce hanging out and the scarcity of meat. I've had better at the fast food joint on 4th street. The rice crepe starter had a piece of thick, rubbery, and nearly flavorless pork that had the consistency of Spam in it. Disappointing.\n\nThe desert - banana cake - was pretty awful.  It was bland, stringy, with almost no banana flavor.  Our waitress attempted to warn us, but we didn't quite pick up on her discrete & professional subtlety.\n\nEven the rice was lacking. What saved our meal was a surprising side of bok choy and mushrooms.\n\nHonestly, Conam seemed like an attempt at western influenced Vietnamese gone wrong.  I am sure the owners will disagree and suggest this is truly authentic. \n\nMy wife and I eat a lot of \"ese\" with a preference for Vietnamese. We frequent the best in the Tenderloin and seek out great Vietnamese in Sacramento and San Jose whenever we pass through.\n\nSan Francisco is blessed an abundance of great Vietnamese restaurants. Even the cheap eat Vietnamese restaurants blow this one away.\n\nTry the lemon grass chicken here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/my-canh-san-francisco\n\nTry the clay pot seafood here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-vung-tau-san-francisco\n\nTry the shaking beef here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/sais-restaurant-san-francisco\n\nTry the 7 kinds of beef here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/anh-hong-restaurant-san-francisco\n\nTry the crab rolls here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/bodega-bistro-san-francisco-2\n\nTry the banh hoi here:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/pagolac-san-francisco\n\nYou can taste the authentic family-style skill at these restaurants.

Initially, I was a bit skeptical about the restaurant because of the prices and the seemingly pretentious food concepts since I've had amazing Vietnamese food for much cheaper at many other establishments. However, my friends and I still decided to give this place a chance after reading some of the wonderful reviews on Yelp. The place was already so packed around 6pm, but we still managed to get a table since we only had 3 people.\n\nLoved the contemporary interior design and artistic touches. The modernized decor, dark walls, and dim lighting evoked this sexy, relaxing atmosphere. It made me want to make out with the food & stuff....just kidding. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n- Grilled Pork Spring Rolls $8\n- Sauteed Filet Mignon $16\n- Braised Basa Fish Claypot $14\n- Grilled Pork Noodle Bowl $13\n\nI enjoyed all the dishes very much. Although different, I was able to taste the creativity and authenticity in each dish. The tantalizing, unique flavors, tastes, and spices incorporated into each selected entree & appetizer greatly appealed to us. I assure you that you'll enjoy almost every bite here. I must say that my favorite of the night was the Grilled Pork Noodle Bowl. I liked everything else very much, but I was craving noodles for the longest time, and this truly pleased me.\n\nService was simply awesome!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-27", "description": "This is the third restaurant that's appeared in this location in as many years. I liked each of the other two quite a lot, but for some reason I guess they couldn't make it work. I guess it's kind of a tough location, since it's not quite by all the dive bars on Lower Polk, but neither is it near all the trendy bars on Upper Polk.\n\nWhatever the case, when I saw the sign for \"Rustic Vietnamese\" food go up, I was excited to try it out.\n\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- My pulled pork vermicelli was, overall, quite delicious. I'd get it again, but the menu had enough intriguing stuff on it that I'd probably explore further the next time I come here.\n\n- Following up on the previous point: I'd come here again.\n\n- Classy ambiance. Quiet enough to talk. Would be a great place for small groups to dine.\n\n- Service was very attentive and, honestly, kind of adorable. And as I type that, I realize just how condescending it sounds, so let me explain. I'm just saying that it was kind of clear that this place opened really recently and the staff was still getting the hang of things--in a totally forgivable and friendly kind of way.\n\n- Seriously, I was totally rooting for my waiter. Again, I know, with the condescension. Sorry. Sorry sorry sorry.\n\n\nTHE LESS GOOD\n\n- I can't call it bad, because I liked it well enough to finish it, but the dessert soup is probably not something I would get again. That said, I have never had a dessert soup before, and therefore have nothing against which to judge it. It's entirely possible that I just don't like dessert soup. It was interesting. And in fact, I take back what I said earlier. If I were in the right mood, I could see myself getting it again.\n\n- My pulled pork was not, as far as I could tell, pulled. This may be a culinary misapprehension on my part. But it seemed like more or less regular pork to me. The point is somewhat moot because It tasted great, but it was a surprise.\n\n- Also, one of the pieces of pork was pretty tough.\n\n- The price is not quite right. My meal (pulled pork vermicelli entree and dessert soup) came up to $25 (including tip). I would have been happier with something closer to $20. (Admittedly, my entree was one of the more expensive ones.)\n\n- Try to sit away from the entrance. Otherwise, if it's a chilly night (i.e., every night in SF), you're gonna get at least one or two unpleasant blasts.\n\n\nIN SUMMARY\n\nSolid stuff.

That being said, it didn't feel to be trying to hard or pretentious; it was just comfortable. \n\nWe came in after 9pm on a Friday, and the place was almost at capacity. We were offered a table or the bar and chose the bar. My only gripe about the entire experience is at the bar, there was a strong residual beer smell, but we got used to it. (Some candles would probably help!)\n\nCocktails, all made with soju, were carefully and cleverly crafted. Over the course of the meal, we tried the Street Peddler and the Cucumber Martini (worked well together: heat and cooling), and the Elderflower Martini (sweet... We had it for dessert).\n\nWe had the poached shrimp spring rolls (there is something magical in that peanut sauce, and I don't even care if it's just sugar), the poached calamari salad (a little vinegary, but appropriate for the dish), a street daily selection of calamari, shishito peppers, beans, green onions, and ponzu sauce (just... Yum), and finally, the basil lemongrass chicken (simple but powerful flavors). They missed our order for the spring rolls, but when they realized, promptly comped them and had the plate out in minutes.\n\nThat would have been enough... it was truly a delightful experience... and then we were brought beignets to sample.

I have dined here a few times and though I never felt rushed, your service staff should be more on the ball about reading when a patron is ready to go (please bring the check) vs. they want to stick around and enjoy the ambiance a bit more, allow themselves to digest so recommend a nice after dinner cocktail, port, drink...whatever.  Bring them more water as they sit.  This is especially important if the restaurant is not busy.

I'm a fan of nuanced, light, fresh Southeast Asian food and Conam delivers. The portions are small, but the flavors are manifold and delightful - case in point is the Omely wrap. You get about six lettuce cups, savory fish paste (was this anchovy?), and a selection of other fillings (dried shrimp, ginger, chili bird pepper, among the things I remember) that you put together - the lettuce cups are small and soon gone, but each bite is hauntingly salty, spicy, slightly sweet, with textural contrast provided by the smooth paste on the crispy lettuce.\n\nThe entrees are equally strong, with the house special one day (I think it was seafood soup with vermicelli noodles) making a strong aromatic entrance before it reached our table, causing us to salivate before we dug into the rich, meaty, hearty stew. I've also enjoyed the braised basa clay pot, finding the balance of caramelized sauce and thick chunks of basa to be a nice foil for rice or your other starch of choice.\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the desserts here, not ever having gotten onto the dessert soup train, even as a young girl in Beijing where such a thing is de rigueur. Conam also offered a banana-based dessert that looked tasty, as well as an organic yogurt with blueberries option, so the dessert here may be fabulous. For me, it wasn't ideal, so I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars.\n\nI urge you to try this place and form your own opinion - the ambiance is calming, the house music is usually house music, and the decor is evocative of Vietnam.

Cordon Bleu has lost a little in terms of quality over the past few years. I'm not the only one thinking this, several of my friends thought so, too. Pho Vietnam is good if you want a quick bowl of pho or some OK bun, but it's just basic (spartan) dining. \n\nSo when Co Nam opened their doors I was really excited to have something \"nicer\" (but not froo-froo) in the hood without walking all the way down to Aux Delices. The food here definitely could give Aux Delices a run for their money if Co Nam's dishes were priced a little more modestly. Don't get me wrong, I like this place. The food is good, but it's not on the level of Slanted Door.....so we shouldn't be paying Slanted Door prices.\n\nThat said, the shrimp ball appetizers and 5 spice chicken are both really good. The GF gets the clay pot entree every time so it's gotta be OK. I had the basa before and it reminded me of a weaker catfish courtbouillon. Not bad, but not as good as what I've had (and made at home).\n\nOverall, give this place a whirl.

A delicious unconventional way to start off a meal.\nPan-Seared Basa - incredibly tasty with a good amount of spicy peppers. Texture was almost pork-belly like, delicious. \nChicken Clay Pot - my entree, when I first saw it I was a little disappointed, it looked like a chicken pot pie without the crust and gravy. Once I dug in, I could really appreciate it, beautifully aromatic. Tasted like the whole dish had been steamed in a lemongrass mushroom broth. I will definitely order it again. Got especially delicious with the hot sauce that was served (the one without the chili flakes was my preference)\nFrench-Vietnamese Yogurt with raspberries - THE HIGHLIGHT - delicious, sweet, incredibly locious. I could have eaten ten servings, no joke.\n\nThe servers were very nice. The owner came by and asked us how we liked the meal, the server gave great recommendations and was very ... cheery. The drink, cucumber martini, was just okay. Out of 8 cocktails, they only had materials for two.\n\nThe place is a bit expensive, definitely for Vietnamese food.

Went to your restaurant this afternoon, before we went in realized you have a happy hour between 4pm to 6pm. Was there 3:55pm. Asked waitress about the happy hour cocktail, she said the bartender wouldn't  be in till 4pm, then she said just ordered food first, when he comes, you can order the drink. So ordered food. Food came,  taste good, bartender never showed up. So ordered beer. I would give this place at least three or four stars till we got the bill. We were charged full bill, no happy hour discount. The bill was $78.00. Asked the waiter (the waitress left), he said that we ordered on 3:56pm, so won't apply for happy hour. Even explained the reason we ordered , he basically showed no interesting to listen, just said I wasn't here. Don't know. We paid bill, left NO TIPS. This is the first time I ever left nothing for the service. You know, since he won't care, and didn't serve us, why should we left tips! San Francisco is the foodie city, there are tons of good places. The difference is good food and good customer service. The attitude of the serving stuff really could make or break the business.

But I should have picked another place!\nCo Nam is overpriced restaurant with bland food and terrible service. Another disadvantage- there is no private parking lot. We spent like 20 min looking for a street parking nearby. Oh well, this is San Francisco...\n\nWe came for lunch and ordered two dishes: Ban Bo Hue (15$) for me and a rice bowl with grilled five-spice chicken (13$) and an egg roll on the side (2$ extra) for my mom.\nIt took them quite a while to serve us (around 20-25 min), which is strange because the place was almost empty when we came (around 2:30-3pm). \nMy soup came first. I asked it spicy, and they brought me a bunch of red jalapenos on the side. The broth was pretty bland. Pieces of pork had way too much fat, and small amount of meat. I had to leave out the blood thing because it had absolutely NO FLAVOR. Why do you put something like this in the soup? \nThe culmination of my disappointment was my mother's rice bowl, which came with pork instead of chicken and a minute egg roll, literally pinky size. When I told them that we asked for a chicken rice bowl, the waiter told us they can grill chicken and bring it on the side. It took them another 10 min, obviously. The amount of chicken they brought was half of the amount of pork my mom had to take out of her rice bowl because she doesn't eat pork. I have to mention, this grilled chicken didn't have a flavor of chicken. I can't really explain what was missing, but something was definitely wrong.\nMy total was 35 $ (including tax and tips). \n\nI hate to say it, but dining in Co Nam was quite a miserable experience for us and I will never-ever come back to this place.", "author": "Natalia P."}

The room is very narrow room and they did a good job making it seem open and bigger.   The service was attentive and good overall.\nOur biggest disappointment was the food.   For the shared appetizers the crispy rolls (Imperial?) was presented plain and bland with out any traditional wraps or mint leaves.   The braised mussels were not a hit and only one out of the four in our group would eat it.  The braised silver fish was very unusual (fishy and salty over rice) and 2 out of 4 were ok with it the other 2 wouldn't touch it after the first bite.\nThe fish claypot was probably the strongest dish going very well with jasmine rice.   The lemon grass beef was ok but nothing special c/w a good clement street vietnamese at half the price.   The filet mignon over 'french fries' the weakest entree.   The amount of filet was small and worst of all it was stir fried to overcooked and topped over semi soggy fries.  Yuck.  \nToo bad.  Good location, space, service but they need to rethink the food quality.", "author": "John P."}

I hope Conam survives and thrives. My favorites: mussels on the half-shell appetizer and 5-spice chicken entree. Clay pots are fabulous. And the dessert soups are divine (get both and share them). Everything is fresh and perfectly seasoned. \n\nEverything about the space (down to the bathroom) is simple and beautiful.

Start with the beef carpaccio, trust me you will add a second order. The grilled sugar cane shrimp is yummy and the braised pork belly is to die for. You must complement anything you order with  the garlic herb noodle. I've tried just about everything on the menu. They always offer a few appetizer specials, primarily seafood.

I hate feeling like I'm wasting food, or feeling hungry afterwards. The staff is also great about describing how big a portion is, if you accidentally order something too big and they sense it. (I speak from experience).\n\nOKAY:\n - the menu selection is the largest, and the old familiars may not be there; however, of everything I've had so far it's been great\n - since the restaurant is new, they may not have worked this out, but it seems like there isn't a dedicated server, they all serve at the same time -- it's a little confusing.\n\nBAD:\n  - nothing yet, I'll update if I see something.. I guess you could say space but I like the layout and think it's a plus\n\n\nRECOMENDED FOR: \n - dinner dates, catching up with old friends\n - for a date, try eating by the bar, it's spacious, beautiful and I personally found it took the awkward interview feeling away\n\nNOT FOR:\n - families with children\n - people who prefer fast food to good/healthy food", "author": "Sanjeev D."}

We were both very impressed with the tasty, simple but well-balanced food.  \n\nThe food was well presented and service was attentive.  Portions were generous but manageable.  They went easy on the chilli but gave us sambal and chopped chilli peppers on the side to add according to our taste - and they were good strong chillis as I discovered when I poured a generous handful into the soup!\n\nOh and I'm a big fan of the delicious Genmaicha tea to wash it all down with, served in a beautiful cast iron teapot :)\n\nThings that just stopped it getting 5 stars (for now):\nAt $19 each plus tip, the food was a little pricey for a lunch (especially on a street with lots of cheap lunch deals).  However, I could appreciate that it was high quality food and I wouldn't mind paying that for dinner.  \nThe place was pretty quiet when we were in so not feeling the ambience, though it was a nice space and well decorated.

The menu looked interesting as did the decor, it's not the slanted door, but it looks interesting. We enjoyed the food and the friendly service but when the bill arrived we were very disappointed. I am not exaggerating, 75% of the items were priced more on our bill than on the menu! In each case we were charged one or two dollars more that the menu price. On top of that this the restaurant adds that annoying \"SF Health\" charge. I just don't understand the thinking of someone opening a new restaurant and engaging in this practice. Anyone who reads the paper knows that people hate this. I can't remember a visit to a restaurant where there wasn't a discussion of this after a bill arrived with a line item adding a charge for SF Health. A restaurant owner would have to be either an idiot or so arrogant that they didn't care that this angers their patrons. The fact is, we can walk to 500 restaurants from where we live. It doesn't take much to sway our decision on where to eat. As long as the quality doesn't slip, Delfina Pizzeria can get away with a healthy SF charge, we grumble but we pay it. But a new restaurant which charges more than the menu prices? No way.", "author": "Lee D."}

I was duly impressed by the aesthetics and the vibe of the place, and went in and talked to the young owner (male). I told him that I was interested in eating here, but not that particular day and could I grab some Paper Take Out menus to peruse, of which he graciously complied. I made it a \"must do\" thing for my next outing on Polk Street, and grabbed a friend and went there on saturday, the 30th of November. The menu offerings for an early afternoon brunch were numerous, and we settled on their version of the Thai Burger, which did not disappoint. It was so juicy and it had it's own sauce and was on some kind of a combo pretzel/potato style roll with cheese and fresh greens. Delicious! Since there were no accompaniments, we asked if we could order a side of fries, which we wanted to split. Amazingly, they split the order in the kitchen and gave us the one order on 2 separate plates. Now that is service! The fries were delicious and they had shreds of finely diced thai basil shredded over the top..Nice Touch. I asked for some salt and pepper, which the server graciously brought, but it was mixed together in one small dipping plate, which I thought a little odd, but interesting. All in all, it was a great experience and they truly (all the staff) went out of their way to make our dining experience truly memorable. I can't wait to come back and try the \"true\" artisan nouveau Vietnamese hand crafted plates.", "author": "Timothy L."}
