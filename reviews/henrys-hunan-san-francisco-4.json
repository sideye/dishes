Henry, who recently passed, after creating a classic San Francisco institution, would be mortified to see what THIS location of his family restaurant group has come to. \n\nUpon our arrival, the shabby waiter (as it turned out) was standing outside the front door, smoking. After flipping his cigarette into the street he came inside with us. (That's our waiter?!) We made some effort to have our order understood, in English, as he spoke nearly no English as far as we could discern. Not great for someone in a customer service position. After putting down our order we never saw him at our table-side again. Oh, ... except when I called him over and told him that one dish had been delivered nearly cold. \"No, ... hot.\" He told us, and set the dish back down on the table, and left.\n\nThis location, to which I have been many times in the past, is usually very busy at lunchtime. Yesterday, a week day, it was a ghost town. \nNow I know why. \n\nBesides terrible service, the food was abysmal. It makes me sad to say so, but it's true.They have NO dumplings (signature steamed 'pot stickers\") on the menu at all, how is that? One dish that I always order, because it's wonderful, was delivered to our table unrecognizable. I was dark and lifeless; I'm certain it had been previously cooked and reheated to serve. It was very sad.\n\nGreen beans were overly fried and blistered, which made them tough.\n\nDo yourself a favor and steer clear of this place and visit their OTHER location on Church Street @ Day Street if you want the original food Henry designed and was so proud of. There they still take pride in the legacy Henry left them. The manager there, Henry's grandson, Jeffrey, and his staff, deliver the home cooking of Hunan we know and love.", "author": "James G."}

This branch of Henry's was great up until a few years ago when the folks in charge there struck out on their own and started up branches in Noe Valley and the Excelsior, both of which are excellent (just so you know). A new team took over at this spot and it began to go downhill. \n\nNowadays, the staff here does not seem to give a flying fuck. \n\nI always ordered for takeout. Typically you expect a place to get your stuff ready in 15 minutes or so. I'd order 15-20 minutes in advance, then show up and have to wait another 15 minutes until they made the food. This was a repeated thing, not a \"hey we're busy today give us a break\" deal. After a bit the camel's back was broken by a straw and I swore the place off. \n\nAfter two years I buckled and ordered from them again and didn't get fucked over or anything. I ordered further in advance and that seemed to work. The food was inconsistent though, to the point where there was one instance that was pretty gross due to an excess of salt. I'm talking gag reflex. Cook must have been smoking crack. You'd think someone wouldn't go back after something like that but the food in this fucking area sucks. Henry's, even now, is better than most places (OK if you wanna spend $20+ on lunch each day there are options but I don't got that kind of money). I have, finally, stopped going to this place and I'll tell you why.\n\nRecently one of the regular guys set himself up a little nook at a table right behind/next to the cash register. He's got his laptop set up there and a bunch of other shit, like some people have at their desk at home. He's got a small papasan chair where he sits to play video games on the laptop during the lunch rush. I've seen him full on ASLEEP there, in full view, when picking up takeout. I figure dude lost his apartment in expensive-ass SF and this is his fall back. \n\nHere's what occurred to me though--you got this guy living in Henry's Hunan. Not in the back room or anything on a cot, but in the main dining room. He has his computer and home comforts there and is, I'm guessing, single. It stands to reason that this guy probably fucking jacks off to internet porno right at that spot next to the cash register.

On the other hand this place is not for everybody (as you can see from some of the reviews)... So I'm probably safe! \n\nDon't come here if:\n- you don't *love* spicy food\n- you like Americanized Chinese food more than authentic Chinese food\n- you expect the same experience as other Henry's Hunan chains\n- you are on a date (it really isn't even remotely romantic) \n\nThink twice if:\n- you are not comfortable in an all Chinese environment\n- you consider Sichuan food very spicy \n\nThis place is on a quiet street in SOMA. It has a very humble appearance (looks like it was converted from either a diner or taqueria) with cheap tables and chairs. But if you are an adventurous foodie and want to taste authentic Hunan food, give this place a try, it may just blow your mind.\n\nIt may used to be just another Henry's Hunan, but I think the owner has changed. It still has a regular English menu, but they also make authentic Chinese dishes on the side. They weren't used to be on any menu and you have to just know about them, now at least they are written down on a separate menu.\n\nIf you aren't Chinese, politely refuse the nicely bound English menu and insist on the handwritten Chinese menu on a small piece of paper. If you can't read Chinese, consider bringing a friend who can, or order from my list: \n\nSuper spicy:\n- \u5c0f\u7092\u8089/pork with peppers. I'm not sure what kind of pepper it is, but it sets my stomach on fire\n- \u9e21\u80d7/chicken gizzards. Chewy and nicely flavoured \n\nVery spicy:\n- \u732a\u624b/pig trotters. Good way to get some collagen! \n- \u7ea2\u70e7\u9c7c/steamed whole fish. Covered with chili peppers, but the fish meat is not very spicy without the juice. It's a combination of spicy and sour flavour (from pickled veggies) which I love. \n- \u5b5c\u7136\u6392\u9aa8/cumin pork ribs. Needs no explanation but probably one of the best you'd find in the city. \n- \u9ebb\u8fa3\u725b\u86d9/spicy bull frog. A little boney, but the meat is worth the work of spitting out bones. This is a very popular dish and it often run out. \n\nMild:\n- \u85d5\u7247/lotus root chips. Love the crispy texture. It's one of my fav dishes\n- \u624b\u6495\u5305\u83dc/hand peeled cabbage with chili pepper. Not that spicy but very flavourful (with a hint of vinegar too)\n\nI suggest that you order one from each category. If it gets too spicy, they also sell sweetened milk and it's the best way to overrule the burning feeling. \n\nOr, you can just look at what dishes your neighbours are getting and demand the same thing. \n\nThe manager (or owner?) Jason is very nice and accommodating. We made a reservation for a large group and placed the order ahead of time. When we got there the table and food were both ready!", "author": "Rachel Z."}

The price is cheap and the Chinese menu can get you some reasonably authentic home dishes (given that SF doesn't really have good Hunan restaurants).\n\nPros:\n1. Portion size is good for the price, especially so for SOMA\n2. Shiso-based Hunan dishes are a rare find in the U.S.\n3. For those searching exotic meat, there are frog legs & rabbit meat\n\nCons:\n1. Some pork slices tasted VERY off and not fresh. It's not unusual trying to hide poor quality meat within spicy dishes. For things such as stir fry pork w. pepper (\u519c\u5bb6\u5c0f\u7092\u8089), even though the chile peppers are supposed to be the star, the off-tasting pork/bacon was distracting and quite offensive. This is scary considering that this is the dish which almost every table orders (high turnover). Who knows what may be the case for dishes that are ordered less frequently.\n2. Food lacks complexity, even the supposedly Chinese dishes such as Stir Fry pork w. Pepper (\u519c\u5bb6\u5c0f\u7092\u8089) is quite bland. They use serrano, which is somewhat spicy, but not quite up there for authentic Hunan taste.

Easy to find as it is directly across from the Benz dealership.  Parking is reasonably easy to find; we went there during Friday rush hour at 530pm.  The place was fairly empty at that time so we were seated quickly and were able to put in our order in a fashion.\n\n2nd.  We ordered spare ribs, chicken gizzards, and \"bo cai.\"  All were tasty and delicious.  The pictures you see on Yelp are representative.  Some look very homemade but the taste is great.\n\nNow for the other aspects.\n\nThe owners have no idea how to run a restaurant.  I feel bad for the 2 older women cooks I saw in the kitchen.  They make a great meal.  I'll give them that but their kitchen is literally run like a home kitchen.  It's like when you were young and you shouted out to mom to cook up your favorite dishes for dinner and she did it.  These ladies have very little prep in the back as far as I could see when I stuck my head into the kitchen.  They are literally making everything from scratch as the orders come in.  THIS WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE VERY LONG WAIT TIMES that everyone has mentioned on Yelp.  They are literally working dishes one at a time.  Add to the fact that have of their food is stored / refrigerated outside the kitchen downstairs or in the front of house which has the cooks running back and forth...now you've got a recipe for ultimate time warp.  We literally waited 1 hour for our 3 dishes.  When asked why a larger group of guests who came after us received their food much sooner than us, the reason was because they called ahead to order.  (another Yelper had this happen to them as well)\n\nThe front of house.\n\nThe waitresses were fine.  Not rude.  They do their best.  Give them a break.  They are just study abroad students who do not really know the etiquette because they are not getting the guidance from their bosses.\n\nThe manager / boss / owner or whatever was there the whole time.  You could it was him because of his demeanor.  Plus he walked to the back of the restaurant and brought out some expensive looking Chinese rice wine to drink with his friends at a table behind us.  He makes no effort to ensure speed of execution.  No effort to acknowledge his customers and to see how they are doing.  He doesn't take any orders and doesn't seem to care that food service is happening today or the food is coming out tomorrow.\n\nAlthough the food is excellent, this place has many issues in terms of expediting and front of house.  And at ~$50 for those 3 dishes at dinner time with a wait time of ~1 hour...um, there are many other options in SF to satisfy your stomach.  These managers / owners need to realize \"So's\" is literally RIGHT NEXT DOOR.  If they can fix these issues, they will do well.  Otherwise, the rising rent of SF will do them in because in the almost 2 hours we spent there, I only saw ONE table get turned over from 5-7pm during almost peak dinner time on a Friday.  Mind you that when we left the restaurant, it was almost full with one long table of 16 being reserved no doubt for their called in pre-order group which would get precedence over any walk-in's later.  The capacity is ~50-60 people.\n\nIn conclusion, I really want to like this place.  I really want to sample more of their food.  But the wait time is absolutely ridiculous.  The guy at the next table literally ran out of laptop power, smart phone power, and resorted to good ole fashion magazine reading during his wait.  So if you literally have NOTHING to do and don't mind waiting an eternity, come here.  Bring your phone, bring your reading material...but not your appetite initially.  Make sure you give your stomach about 30-45 minutes of pre-hungry time before arriving...or else you might just forget you were hungry!\n\nSo I give it 2 stars...only because of the food.  If it were not for the taste, it would be well....use your imagination....", "author": "Cary L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-09", "description": "Okay, a bit of clarification for those that aren't in the know. There are many Henry's Hunan's throughout the City. I've eaten at all of them but the one in Noe Valley. This is not a chain. This is a family. One brother owns this one, another brother owns this one, this one is owned by an uncle - you get the gist. In fact, I was talking to the guy at the other SOMA location - the one on Natoma, which was closest to one of my last jobs - many years ago and he was telling me which family members owned which ones and how many other family members worked there. I didn't memorize it.\n\nAnother caveat: I had my rehearsal dinner at this location, on October 30, 1998. My mother picked up the tab, just as she had for my sister's rehearsal dinner. I told them how many people to expect, I ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu, I told them to add any other dishes they thought would be good, which they did, and the food was hot and ready when we showed up. My mom paid about a third that she paid for the chain restaurant for my sister's dinner, and we had leftovers. I said, it's nothing fancy, but everyone said oh-my-god-that-was-so-good.\n\nThe decor is not exquisite at any location, though I like the space at the one on Natoma. I worry about this particular location, because it never seems busy, although I think they do a considerable amount of takeout. My husband in conversation one time (we used to get lots of takeout when we lived South of Market) with one of the Giants fans who works there told my spouse that the clubhouse manager was always stopping by to get takeout before games. I hope that's still true.\n\nSo this last weekend we stopped in. It was a nearly empty restaurant on the first official Saturday of Chinese New Year. Our guy was limping as badly as my husband (they exchanged notes later). I was a little uncertain. But my three favorite dishes - Diana's special meat pie, the chicken salad, and Henry's special - were all still as good as I remembered. That's right. They tasted right, something that's difficult to do across so many restaurants across so many years in a picky-ass restaurant mecca like SF. Well, when you do something well... Our food tasted right, tasted good, and we were all happier people suddenly.\n\nThere was something monumentally satisfying about the whole experience. Since the whole unemployment-pregnancy-move-to-Oakland thing, I haven't been in a Henry's Hunan since some time in 2008. And the guy at this restaurant, the one with the limp, said to me: You used to go to the South of Market one at lunch, right? That's the one owned by my uncle. Uh, yeah - all the time. A couple of times a week, usually after 1 or 2. And I'd stop by in the early evening and get takeout. And he remembered?!!\n\nMaybe you can go home again.", "author": "Ingrid J."}

Henry's hasn't perfected the Chicken Chow Mein of my perfect world, but they've come pretty darn close.  With the version at Henry's (pictured) you'll find an occasional bean sprout, a tiny bit of shaved carrot, a single sliver of onion and a little green onion to go with a large portion of noodles and cubes of all white meat chicken.  If you like noodles and meat, you're going to like the chow mein at Henry's, and because it is a Hunan restaurant you can bet that your food will be effectively spicy.\n\nThat's another beautiful thing at Henry's Hunan.  If you can't handle the heat the kitchen will be more than happy to season your food to your preferred spicyness or mildness should that be the case.\n\nI often get carried away with ordering food and end up over-eating instead.  Seriously, one order of chow mein and a beverage will fill you up, but I had to try the Dumplings too.  My server was seated at a table folding these when I walked into the restaurant; one look at the ingredients was enough to convince me to try these.  They're just like potstickers with a lean pork filling with just a bit of cabbage and ginger, but instead of being pan-fried crisp on one side these are steamed then presented in a bowl with a light, spicy soy sauce and chopped scallions (also pictured).  The dumplings were very good.\n\nThe service was excellent, but I went there during an off-peak hour so I was the only diner there at the time.  Inexpensive and less than two blocks from my work, I wonder why I haven't eaten here more often.  In my perfect world I will.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It is a place of extremes and I think there are some lovable things and some mediocre things. So I give it 3 stars and here is why. \n\nIt isn't your average Americanized corner beef-and-broccoli shop. They market themselves as distinctly Hunan and spicy. \n\nMy favorite thing about Henry's is the menu. It has odd and personal dishes that have a bit more explanation than just a list of ingredients. The menu speaks to you. \n\nI tried a soup, dumplings, and a pork and cabbage dish. Pork is a big feature on the menu. \n\nIn the case of the main dish, it came out very greasy and the pork had been cooked at least twice...and perhaps at least once too many times. \n\nThe dumplings were steamed and in a spicy soy sauce. Pretty good. \n\nThe soup was solid but not special. \n\nThe people are nice enough but not so attentive. The space is plain but that doesn't matter for this kind of meal. \n\nThe do have a TV on the wall which is tacky and distracting to the staff and guests in a resturant. It is probably a symptom of this also being the living room of a bunch of people who spend all their waking hours in this resturant. \n\nI didn't make any particular requests about the spiciness level and they didn't ask. It came out mildly spicy. \n\nIn the end I would say if you are a big eater who likes rich food that is outside the the norm and you like homespun dining experiences then this is a good spot for you. Otherwise, there are a lot of nice Chinese food options in SF to choose from. \n\nIf you work in the area I could see this as a part of a regular rotation.", "author": "Erik F."}

It has spicy ground pork, lettuce, and some fried, crispy top and bottom. Please try it! \n\nNoodles: I'm not sure exactly what this dish is called, but I know it's noodles with spicy ground pork and lettuce?? It's one of my favorites, but then again, I'm a really big fan of noodles. \n\nMarty's special and Henry's special: I think one of them has scallops, chicken, and ham? All in a spicy sauce....which a delicious! And the other is ham and some veggies?? It's more smoky in flavor....both of these are pretty good. \n\nMy mom said Marty was another brother or son or some family member....my cousin made the general rule of thumb that if it's named after the restaurant it HAS to be good...and I feel like this is accurate! \n\nIf you're not a fan of spicy, don't come here...or ask for super super mild things.

I have been eating here for 18 years.  When Jeff was in charge, it was wonderful.  Food was served quickly and tasted great.  Jeff was always friendly and had a smile on his face.  \n\nI moved out of SF and can't make it back unless I am in town a lot but when I am, I always stop in to get takeout here to bring back home with me.  The last 4 occasions I actually ate at the restaurant and whomever is the server now is very rude.  He only serves his friends or chinese people and you have to basically go up to someone else at the facility to be served.  I didn't want to believe that someone was that obvious about discrimination so I convinced myself that the last 4 visits was just an oversight on his part and that he was just bad at his job.   I loved the food so I put up with the previous bad service.  However, this last visit, it was obvious what was going on and I now understand why every time I eat here there are only chinese people in the restaurant.  We walked in to be seated and he walked right passed us ignoring us, walked up to a chinese couple behind us and seated them while we grabbed our own seats.  He then gave them a menu, took their order and walked to the kitchen. \n\nWe sat waiting for menus as he continually walked back and forth greeting other chinese patrons.  He gave everyone else (again, either his friends or chinese patrons) menus and ignored us.  Finally, another woman brought us menus.  Tick Tock, Tick Tock...we waited over 25 minutes for two entrees and my spouse had already finished hers before i even got my order.  \n\nThe male server then goes outside and smokes with his friends and smoke is coming into the restaurant (Not real fun to eat while smelling smoke).  Then he comes back in, grabs the water pitcher to refill glasses on the tables and only fills the glasses of every chinese table and walks right by ours even though we made it quite clear that we wanted water by putting our glasses at the very end of the table so he could see them.  I finally went and grabbed the water pitcher and served our own water.  \n\nWe had enough and my spouse asked him why he is not serving us but taking care of everyone else in the restaurant.  He looked at her and as she was in mid sentence walked away saying nothing and glaring at us.  What a jerk!  Then after this happened, two guys walked in (not chinese) and he ignored them too.  They stood there for at least 5 minutes waiting to be greeted as he walked right passed them.  We mentioned our bad service to them and one of them said to us \"Glad we aren't the only ones that thought he wasn't serving us because we aren't chinese\".  Wow, how this place is still operating is beyond me.  \n\nIf they want to ignore paying customers because of race, then why don't they just become a private facility and not open to the general public.  Too bad, cause I love their food but this guy is toxic and I am choosing to spend my money elsewhere.", "author": "Amie G."}

Diana's Meat Pie, I know sounds odd and weird, but it's good. It's a chinese pizza/quesadilla type of thing. It's using chinese fried pancake for the top and bottom and the inside is lined with shredded lettuce and ground beef with sauce. that's all it is, so it's like a Chinese quesadilla. \n\nThe other item that we love is the Henry's special. This location is a hit-or-miss on this entree but overall still good. It's a mix of chicken, shrimp, scallop mixed with bell peppers with a hot spicy red sauce. Spoon that baby over white rice and you've got yourself a delicious meal! \n\nI wouldn't ever eat in here, it's a bit of a dive and parking is tough on Bryant street, so I just double park and run out to get the food.", "author": "Grace L."}

Two men taking care of a whole dining room. That being said, the room had the capacity for about 60 customers (20 tables), and there were about 5 people here, at 3 tables. Shouldn't have been a big deal, but they were running around as though they were completely overwhelmed, and the service I received certainly supported this observation.\n\nI sat down for almost ten minutes before I got up, walked to the counter, picked up a take-out menu from a plastic bin, and sat back down to read it, since I never got a menu. I then waited another five minutes until my order was taken. I ordered spring rolls and kung pao chicken. Keep it simple on my first visit, especially since it seemed like these two guys weren't really doing so well, running and yelling at each other (and into the phone when receiving phone orders).\n\nTook ten minutes for me to get my food. In that ten minutes, I overheard two of the other three tables complaining about the service. One guy had to ask for his check and then, as he was paying for his meal, the cashier started taking a phone order and ignored him mid-transaction. I heard the customer say \"It's $6.75. You owe me $5.25 back. I have to go, I'm late back to work... may I please just have my change please?\". Meanwhile, another table of two was waiting for their menus after sitting for five minutes. Really bad.\n\nMy food arrived. The sweet and sour soup was mediocre. Not bad. Not good. Just there. But the kung pao was quite nice. Flavorful, fresh, and large in quantity. Too much for me for lunch, really (not that that stopped me). The spring rolls didn't show up until I was done with lunch, but to their credit, they took them off of the bill and apologized. Took another five minutes to get another soda though.\n\nThe bill came and it was still $15 with tip, even sans eggrolls, for a lunch entree and a Diet Coke. Not particularly cheap.\n\n2.5 stars really. Horrible service though apologetic. Hole in the wall atmosphere. Lots of yelling in Mandarin between the employees. Not particularly cheap.

NO KIDDING.\n\nBeen going to this place for the last 8 years on a fairly regular basis, obviously liked the food and the kids seemed to want to do their best.  Even drove out to that place passing another Henry's Hunan that is closer to me, trying to help the kids kind of thing.  Referred many many people to their restaurant over the years and then lately things started changing.  About 8 months ago a friend of mine who works on 10th street ate there for lunch and got violently ill.  I figured it was a one off, unfortunately turns out it was not. I did start to notice a steep decline in the quality of the food, it was no longer made with fresh vegetables, they were now often wilted and bland.  The food became much more greasy and all of it started to taste the same.  The tables were often dirty and they just swept everything off on to the floor. They had always had good rice, now I started getting a different rice, smaller and gluey and frankly just disgusting.  I brought this to their attention but they just gave me some song and dance about it being a one off, something about having run out of the \"good rice\" but that it was only once.  Turns out it was not, the gluey small grain garbage starting appearing more often than not.\n\nConcurrent with this decline I witnessed a significant change of attitude as well.  The attention to the customer was gone, their standards seemed to have fallen off the face of the earth.  The restaurant became a place for the kids and their friends to hang out and they lost interest in the business, spending their time sitting at a large round table entertaining their friends even when they were not busy late in the day.  It was as if I was taking up their time and was bothering them by picking up food there and the kid running it was now seemingly above it all.  Then my family got very sick, violently sick from what was obviously food poisoning.  The hubris they exhibit is surely related to the health risk this place now poses for any one wandering in there.  I could probably overlook the lack of customer attention even the attitude but the food is now dangerous.  They have a lot to learn about dealing with the public but I intend to refer this place to the city's health inspectors as I don't think anything else will keep people from getting ill.\n\nThere are plenty of other good Chinese restaurants in the city with fresh food and no attitude; people who care about the business and not about using it as a playground for kids. Do yourself and your family a favor and avoid this place at all costs.  We will never go there again and I wish I had not referred so many people to them in the past.", "author": "Francis S."}

After being seated, it was about 5 minutes before we were offered menus and 10 minutes later before were finally able to flag down the waitress to order.  Ok, no big deal.  We ordered a few dishes, including hot and sour soup.  Meanwhile, the waitress kept shuffling back and forth, avoiding eye contact.  About 35 minutes later we flagged her down again and asked how much longer it would be.  She said there were still 4 or so tables in front of us.  Having observed that food had been coming out at a rate of one table every 5 minutes (apparently they only cook for one table at a time), we decided we weren't willing to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes for crappy Chinese food, and told the waitress we were leaving.  Instead of apologizing, she seemed relieved.  Come on, they've got to at least have a vat of hot and sour soup back in the kitchen. It shouldn't take an hour to bring out something as simple as that.", "author": "natilee r."}

Well, this fits that description.  Infact, they actually didn't completely take out the old kitchen when they \"remodeled\" and you can see the enormous satinless steel wall and hood of the old stove right in the dining room.  Gots to love tat.  \n\nAnyways, Jeffery (or Jeff) is a wonderful Chinese young man who works there constantly.  Seriously he's ALWAYS there.  I asked him about it and he says he NEVER gets a day off, holidays included as long as it's during the week.  He feels blessed that he doesn't have to work weekends because the place is closed, so he doesn't complain.  \nI look forward to discussing the Giants and A's with him.  He gets so excited by the prospect of baseball season and perhaps the Giants going all the way.  Unfortunately, the more excited he gets the less I understand, me being a white boy from CT.      ...and now that they've got Zito (yeah, I'm an A's freak) I can start rooting for the Gi's! \n\nSo say Hi to Jeffery and then go straignt on to order the Harvest Pork.

Both times I've come, I wasn't able to get back to work on time and had to go over my hour for lunch.  The servers are actually really busy, and I see them running around, so it's not for lack of trying.  It's just that they don't have enough people for soooo many customers at lunch.  I actually eat in about 15 minutes or less, so the rest of my lunch hour is spent walking there and back(10 minutes each way), waiting for the food(20 minutes) and ordering/paying for the bill(10 minutes).\n\nMy low rating isn't for the wait time or service though.  While the wait time is super long, it's because they're one of the only options for Chinese in the area, and they're super cheap (lunch specials run from $6 to $8).  The service is actually pretty decent.  The poor waiters are always scurrying around to try to help all of the customers.  The rating is for the food itself...I just feel that the ingredients seem to lack flavor.  I got the kung pao shrimp once, and the shrimp didn't have much taste besides the taste of the sauce.  Plus, it was chopped up rather than being whole pieces, which was a turn off.  It just tasted like the shrimp had been frozen for too long and lost all of it's natural flavor.  I also got the combination chow mein, and once again, the beef and chicken didn't have much taste, besides the flavor from the sauces.  Both dishes were mediocre, if not disappointing.  I do like that they provide a free hot and sour soup with the lunch though.", "author": "Tyler C."}

Do you remember eating orange Flintstones vitamins as a kid? If you forgot, orange chicken from Henry's Hunan tastes exactly like them! It was so unspeakably disgusting, I couldn't finish the only bite I took. I had the rest boxed up just so I could show my roommates how awful it was.\n\nMy coworker pitied me and shared some of his Hunan spare ribs with me, which tasted soapy, for lack of better words. When he ordered a Coke, he was handed a can and glass. Sure it was lunchtime, but this place was hardly busy. Would it have killed our waiter to fill the glass?

The chef from Natoma was working there for dinner.\n\nWe had the dumplings, Kung Pao Chicken, and Henry's Short Ribs (first time dish).  Dumplings were pleasant as usual. The Kung Pao Chicken was hella good and extra spicy.  We thought it was possibly the best Kung Pao Chicken we have had at any Henry's location.  The short ribs took some time to eat, but was definitely tasty.  \n\nWe survived back to back Henry outings in the same day with no problems.  I highly recommend it.  We didn't even need to use the sink faucet that hangs above one of the tables against the wall to shower off the sweat from the spice.\n\nSeems like this is very popular for takeout/delivery.  It was pretty quiet. Also, it is popular for slirkers to pop in and try to get free food.

BUUUUUTTTTTT it also has huge lines/waits and the food, while good, is no better than any other decent Chinese place in the neighborhood.  Only worth it if you have a giant group that won't fit elsewhere.", "author": "Jason S."}

Orange chicken would have been better if I had ordered spicy. I got mild and it was a bit bland for me.  The hot and sour soup is really good.  The decor is pretty basic but clean (for a Chinese restaurant).  I can see this place being a regular lunch spot. If only they would deliver . . .", "author": "Su K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-26", "description": "While I prefer the Minna and original Sansome locations, this place has the best family-run-business atmosphere.  Random location across from Bed Bath and Boring/Trader Joe's mall at Bryant and Ninth St.  Recommended dishes: hot/sour chicken; Henry's special; green beans without meat.  Only complaint is that rice is sometimes past its prime.  Dishes themselves are amazingly hot and fresh and truly as spicy as requested.  The other day my friend and I stopped for a late lunch here on the way to a movie downtown.  Easy on-street parking early afternoon on the weekend.  Even got free very spicy hot and sour soup with chicken stock which was a great appetizer.", "author": "Xander S."}

Its standard fare. Service is good. However, its quite oily (regardless of whether I request to cut the oil).", "author": "Rahul A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-18", "description": "Henry's Hunan is a small chain of restaurants at different locations throughout the city.  The food is consistent and the prices is reasonable!  Tonight, I ordered my favorite dish, Shrimp with String Beans and steamed rice.  The shrimp is tender and the green beans are cooked just right- with a bit of a snap, not soggy.  If you get a chance to dine at any one of their locations, I highly recommend this combination.  The serving was enough for two, so come with a hungry appetite and bring your friends.  Great food for a great price.", "author": "Denny L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-22", "description": "The first time I tried Henry's Hunan was in the FD about a year ago.  I wasn't very impressed at that time, even though my colleagues loved this place.  I thought the food tasted like Panda Express or \"Westernized\" Chinese Food.  I am pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food.  However, much to my surprise when I decided to give it another try, this time, at the SOMA location -- it was pretty damn tasty.  The place in SOMA on Bryant is still a hole in the wall but the Spicy Sole Filet and String Beans were cooked just right and delicious.  I will definately be ordering take-out from here again when I'm craving some greasy Chinese food.", "author": "Janny J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-05", "description": "My favorite dish here is the spicy fried cod.  Lots of black beans and very tasty.  The house made spiced ham is also great as well as the soups.  I like the spinach soup better than the hot and sour, though.  OK, I'm getting hungry just writing about it.\n\nYou will be hard pressed to find a more friendly server than Jeff, especially in a Chinese restaurant.  Good baseball fan.\n\nOnce you become a regular, you can get away with certain things.  For example, you may get  some of the entrees served over rice rather than having to order a whole entree.  That's great if you're dining alone or want to sample a dish without having to get the entire order.", "author": "Eddie C."}
