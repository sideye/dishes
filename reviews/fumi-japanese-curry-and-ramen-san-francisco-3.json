I am used to Non-Japanese owned Japanese restaurant by now but I really did not like their mediocre ramen (Don't ask me why but I visited Fumi for 3 times). I am almost sure it is not 100% house made (probably they use / add pre-made soup base).

The lighting is dim with a cozy ambiance. \n\nThe menu has lots of options. We got the Chicken Katsu with Spicy Curry, Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Curry and the Chicken Teriyaki. The curry dishes all come with lots of curry and not enough rice/protein. Definitely order more rice or an extra side of protein with your order because the plates are large and swimming in curry. In addition, each order comes with a side of salad. \n\nThe Katsu is fried nicely and does not give off that frozen chicken taste. The tempura was nothing special so I would not recommend ordering that with a curry dish. The Chicken Teriyaki was fresh and also not frozen. It was juicy and not dry.", "author": "Karen Y."}

The curry is good, but the pork katsu stayed consistently crispy even after the sauce was on it for so long! Normally it gets soggy at other places so quickly but this pork katsu held its own well  I wish it was a little more moist and tender tho. The curry itself usually tastes the same to me everywhere I go (if they're good) so this one didn't really differ too much from other good spots. This came on a sizzling platter which was cool! It's a little out of the way for me to travel to, but if I'm ever in the area I'll definitely come back! They have so many things on the menu I wanted to try! (Ramennnnn!)

There's most likely a line and the line may include people waiting in the back (there's a back room.)\n\nAll regular ramen bowls come with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms, sweet corn, spinach, and green onion. \n\nThe teppan curry ramen dishes came with different toppings according to which dish it was. I tried the chashu teppan curry ramen because I hadn't seen it at most ramen places in the Bay Area, but was also eyeing the chicken curry ramen. It came with roasted pork (yum! Not too fatty, which I like), bean sprouts, sweet corn, bamboo shoots, and an onion sunny-side egg. \n\nThe egg was delicious! Very runny. The broth was rich and warm, and noodles were just the right amount of chewy. \n\nIt was a good-sized portion for $14.95. I didn't finish the bowl and I was hungry from waiting to be seated for so long! (It was probably over half an hour, but it was after 8 soooo.) \n\nMy date gets the same meal each time he goes to Fumi: seafood with black curry omurice (Japanese omelette with curry and fried rice inside.) I tried some and it was really good, but beware--the black curry will stain your teeth! \n\nFumi also has lots of tea drinks, like crazy macha milk tea, sexy strawberry milk tea, creamy taro milk tea, beautiful Thai milk tea, and love fumi milk tea (you can add boba to all of them!) but I'm not a fan of having to pay $1 for hot brown rice tea. I think it should be included! \n\nThey have a pretty good dessert menu including green tea cheesecake, mango mousse, tiramisu, Mochi, and regular ice cream. \n\nIf you're in the Mission, check out Fumi for top-notch ramen and curry plates!", "author": "Lizzie S."}

I chose to add spice, which ended up not being spicy at all for those who enjoy spicy food. The plate came to the table boiling and hot, and the waitress poured the curry on top. It came with a ring of egg as well, and they gave a generous portion of katsu. I really enjoyed the fish katsu! It was very moist and the flaky crisp of the fish was perfectly fried.

It is a very small restaurant in the Mission. We were seated right away on a weekend but it varies on what time you arrive you may have to wait. For starters we ordered the Kakuni, garlic broccoli, fried squid legs and soft shell crab. The broccoli was made simple pretty much cooked in garlic with I believe sesame oil so really couldn't go wrong with a veggie dish but not sure how I feel paying $6 for a small plate of it. The Kakuni was alright as well, it was basically pork belly in soy sauce I wasn't too excited about it. I liked the fried squid legs, it was not too chewy or fishy tasting. The soft shell crab was too battered or fried so it was not to my liking. For our entrees we each ordered a teppan with curry as follows: steak rep-an, hamburger teppan, pork teppan and ground pro teppan ramen. The food came out pretty quick considering the waiter told us that the kitchen was a bit behind. All curries came out on a hot sizzling pan and you pour the curry onto it. I thought the curry was alright, I asked for mild spicy, while everyone else had ordered spicy and it was not as spicy as they thought.  Each teppan, came with an egg as well. All in all I thought the food was ok, I was not too excited about the curry even though its pretty popular here. I want to say service was great, I would recommend to try it at least once if you like it great if not, move on.

First off, I've been to many ramen joints and the broth is either too salty, too bland, or too \"porky\" (if that makes sense? lol). Additionally, I didn't wanna smell like curry when we go grab some dessert afterwards.But hey...I was looking for an adventure and I didn't mind trying something new.\n\nBoy, was I glad thst we tried it out. Appetizers were a hit or miss. Like the salad were ok. Tempura was good but nothing out of the ordinary. And the takoyaki were simple and prepared as they should be. Bottomline...the appetizers were ok.\n\nAs for the ramen........omg..............I didn't stop talking about how delicious it was. Bite after bite, I told my friend: This is realllllllyyyyy good. It was getting quite embarrassing as I couldn't stop saying it lol. I LOVE THE SOFT SHELL CRAB RAMEN!!!!! Please get it with the toasted garlic oil...it's worth the extra $1! So aromatic & so flavorful! Best ramen I've ever had!\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken katsu curry on a sizzling plate. It was a huge portion and was delcious as well! We kinda wished though that the server allowed us to pour how much sauce we wanted on the chicken. Make sure you request that to control how much sauce is placed on your entree.\n\nVerdict? I will come back. In fact, it's 80 degrees today in SF but wouldn't mind going there tonight for dinner. It's THAT GOOD....trust me:)", "author": "Ralph N."}

It'd be fine as a bowl of ramen where they don't really name the broth, but it is a letdown for the tonkotsu label.\n\nChicken Katsu: Perfectly crispy all around.  Thinly pounded meat to maximize fried surface area while still remaining moist.\n\nSpicy Curry Sauce: I paid $4 extra for this side just so I could soak up my chicken katsu in this delicious sauce.

When I order takeout I usually have a predictable, awesome experience and usually my food arrives earlier... but something happened yesterday that I found strange. \n\nI pre-ordered my usual before the store opened (ordered at 4:53, Fumi opened at 5). Placed my ordered via yelp that would be fulfilled by grubhub, said I would get it by 5:35 pm. Yay! I waited.\n\n5:45 rolls around and no phone call no nothing, so I call the restaurant and they my order was taken so I hang up and wait.\n\n6:18 rolls around and I'm hangry. I call the restaurant, they say it's been taken and I should call the driver so they gave me his information and I call him. He doesn't pick up. \n\n6:25, 50 minutes LATER than the estimated time of arrival (1 hour and 25 minutes after the restaurant opened) I received my food. The driver apologized, I asked what happened and he blamed the restaurant. I walk away starting to assume it was his fault and he used it as an excuse, but I take the food and go inside.\n\nI open my meal to see how fresh it was. The salad was soggy. I don't know what that cool vegetable thing they put on it, but it was soggy too. The chicken katsu was like warm but luckily the curry was still very warm. \n\nI have my suspicions of what happened. I don't know if it was the restaurant or the delivery guy's fault. I've never had a problem with Fumi delivery so if it WAS his fault, they should NOT use him anymore and is more than willing to throw a restaurant he works with under the bus.

It is that good.\n\nThe chicken katsu is perfectly fried and seasoned. Not too salty, not soggy at all, and the perfect thickness. The hamburger steak (Japanese style) has all the right flavors, is tender af, and will make you crave more. \n\nSome Japanese curry places are clearly from a base out of a box, which is not always bad.

If you are curious about black curry, this is the place to try it. A few years ago, there was a fad for black food in Japan: black burgers (including black buns), black spaghetti, and black curry, to name just three. All this blackness is courtesy of squid ink, which is plentiful in Japan, and lends a pleasing, mild flavor to savory dishes. I've tried the black curry at Fumi's and it is quite good, although it does impart a startling black hue to one's tongue. My favorite though, is the teppan shrimp curry. The curry rice option comes with deep fried prawns and lotus slice atop a hill of rice with a moat of raw egg, which quickly cooks into an omelet on the iron plate. The curry comes on the side, allowing you to pour as much as you wish. The egg noodle teppan option comes with boiled shrimp and a fried egg on the side. Again, the curry comes on the side.

For a city with a prominent food scene, SF is surprisingly scant in legit, worthy Japanese curry. Japantown is mediocre and tastes like box curry; Volcano is underwhelming and seems like a joint that would belong in a mall food court; Murraci's is just about the only decent place, but it is a very small and more of a hole-in-the-wall pit stop than a comfy sit-down dinner like Fumi.\n\nWe got the chicken katsu teppan curry, and it was outstanding--a cloud of smoke rose as the server poured the curry over the sizzling teppan plate. (Exciting! I suggest capturing a video to oneup your food porn) The housemade curry had excellent umami flavor, a tantalizing spice blend, and wasn't too salty. An equally impressive aspect was the heavenly interplay of textures. Not only was the rice perfectly charred like the bottom of clay pot rice or dolsot bibimbap; the egg was crisped as well. Together with the katsu featuring a crunchy panko exterior and juicy meaty interior, this was a very satisfying dish. The pictures of the curry rice plates do look a bit small, as other reviewers have pointed out, so I would recommend sticking to the more avant-garde teppan curry. \n\nThe ramen turned out to be just alright; it will do to satisfy ramen cravings but I do prefer Coco's in Bernal for the wow factor. The broth was attenuated in tonkotsu flavor, mildly creamy, and less salty (to our liking). The portion size was just sufficient, conveniently leaving space for dessert at Mitchell's afterwards P: Although it came with the basics of half an egg, 3 chashu slices, menma, kikurage, corn, and spinach, it could definitely use a larger quantity of each topping. My favorite part of my ramen was the soft-boiled egg, which was on point with its mastery of the liquid gold yolk. They also have more unique ramen options, such as the California ramen with avocado and soft shell crab ramen (The boo was interested in this, but I thought the soft shell crab looked creepy like it was about to walk out of the ramen bowl any moment.)\n\nDinner totaled to $24 pre-tip, very affordable for quality noms in SF. They also have happy hour 5-7pm with BOGO dranks but unfortunately we didn't notice until we left and saw the poster outside (and they have Asahi black!!). The ambiance is nice and relaxing, with traditional Japanese decor that is homey but not flashy and abstract like many Japanese places these days. (Plus, nothing can beat an ambiance of Totoro music in the background) Service is efficient and attentive, and the owner is very friendly.

Overall, I would say that the ramen is only 'okay' and would probably recommend getting a curry dish instead because that's what the seems like this place is known for. \n\nTLDR; Ramen was only okay, would come back to try their curry dishes. Good and fast service.", "author": "Jenny N."}

Reallly good. \n\nI'm a fan of stone cooked dishes like stone hot bibimbap. The heat from the plate below gave the bottom of the rice a crunchy burnt texture and mixed with the egg, curry, and shrimp. Just really great. It may not be authentic Japanese curry, but it's pretty delicious and definitely worth trying.\n\nAmbience-wise, the restaurant is small but not cramped nor overcrowded with people. It's a good place with to have dinner conversations since noise-level isn't bad at all.", "author": "Kim L."}

However, neither its curry nor ramen are that authentic, and the flavor profiles are a bit off.\n\nI've had the chicken katsu curry and tonkotsu ramen. The chicken katsu curry came out looking great, with a generous serving size and some mixed greens dressed with vinaigrette on the side. I asked for the extra spicy option. As I began eating, I noticed red streaks in the curry, and the curry tasting unusually sour. It dawned on me that they simply poured Tabasco sauce in the curry to accommodate \"extra spicy\". This was a pretty unfortunate discovery. If you're going to offer three different spice levels, it makes sense to make the different curries at those spice levels rather than just adding hot sauce. I could just do that myself.\n\nThe tonkotsu ramen looked great as well. However, the broth was overly salty and lacked the rich flavor emblematic of tonkotsu ramen. It was almost as if they felt the need to overcompensate with excessive salt to make up for the light-tasting broth. The chashu pork was a bit chewy and lacked the soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture that I look for in tonkotsu ramen.\n\nFumi is clean, well-managed, and a nice spot to grab a bite in Mission/Bernal. But based on their unusual flavor profiles of what are meant to be traditional classic dishes, I won't be returning on a regular basis.", "author": "Tim X."}

The chicken katsu was super crispy, and the ramen itself was amazing. I got the 'spicy' level, and it was enough to give the ramen a kick, but not mask all the delicious curry flavors. The base ramen doesn't come with a ton of toppings so you may wish to add you own, but I was still pretty satisfied. \nMy friend got the milder-looking tonkatsu ramen, which was reportedly also delicious.

I was craving something warm and spicy during this rainy week so I placed an order of CHICKEN KATSU CURRY (SPICY) through GRUBHUB. I didn't want to venture out in the rain and opted for delivery of food to my office.\n\nThe CHICKEN KATSU was breaded and fried perfectly. Chicken can be hit or miss in terms of texture and dryness, but this chicken breast was moist and the breading remained crispy, even in a delivery box. I enjoyed the spiciness of my CURRY--it really warmed me up on a rainy day! Fumi's curry also had an extra citrusy/vinegar flavor to it that went well with the chicken katsu and rice. This dish came with a side of green salad.\n\nThings to note for DELIVERY:\n\nI am unsure if the driver was from Fumi or Grubhub, but he did not follow my instructions for delivery. I work in a building with security so people have to be buzzed into the building. I was very specific in my instructions to call my cell phone upon arrival so I can come downstairs, OR give the security desk my extension so they can ping me. The driver buzzed himself in and just left my food on the counter. He didn't even provide the front desk with my name so they did not know who to call. Good thing I was keeping an eye out on the app so I knew when the food arrived and was able to run downstairs to get it in a timely manner.\n\nFor future visits, I think I'll pop into the Bernal Heights location and eat inside the restaurant.

It just feels more authentic to me that way like I'm living in a Yasujiro Ozu family drama where over a low-lying dinner table on a tatami, I'm scolded for not finding a proper wife at my advanced age. I was hoping there would be a bit of that feeling at Fumi since I considered it a good sign that it shares the name of my Okasan. Yep, my mom's name was Fumiye.

I felt it was essential I order the $10 Pork Katsu, even though it looked identical to all their curry plates in the photo menu.

I was also disappointed that a $2.50 Diet Coke amounted to one of those Lilliputian aluminum bottles because I usually finish those in ten seconds flat.

I like to fantasize about the day I can buy a house in the city where I was born and raised in for oh you know, a million or two. I figure if Mr. NSS and I both sell our kidneys in the black market, we would have just enough for one quarter of a house at Bernal Heights, the \"hottest neighborhood of 2014\".\n\nTell that to Andrew from MDLSF and he'll probably shudder. Can that guy be any more of a douche?\n\nTeam Roh! \n\nOk, some parts of Bernal Heights isn't exactly the nicest and the some of the streets are as tight as a virgin's whoohaaa but the neighborhood is cute and most people are very friendly. Plus, you can't beat the breathtaking, panoramic from Bernal Hill. One area that Bernal Heights is lacking in is solid Asian restaurants. Ichi doesn't count unless you have a daily food allowance of $80+.\n\nOpening a week and a half ago, Fumi Japanese Curry & Seafood took over the old Eagle Donuts space, next to Pizza Hacker. The space is tiny with seating for 20 and three counter seats. This is not a place for groups larger than 4 but they do take reservations for 6 or more people. \n\nOn the menu are Apps (popcorn shrimp, karaage, gyoza, spring rolls), Salads (Asian crab and ceasar), Soups (kabocha, miso, clam), Curry Rice, Curry Noodles, Teriyaki, Teppan Curry, and Whole Crab. Except for the crab and seafood dishes, everything is less than $12. Portions are filling for the price. They also have kid meals for $6-$7. Vegetarian and brown rice options available. No booze available. \n\nWe started with the Chicken Karaage ($8) which I would pass on: http://bit.ly/1Jfygip. The garlic and ginger flavor was there but I wasn't keen on the batter they used. Instead of using the traditional potato starch coating that produces a deliciously crunchy crust, the [wet] batter was doughy and on the softer side. \n\nThe Pork Katsu Curry Rice ($10) was surprisingly very solid...for Bernal Heights: http://bit.ly/1EAgyR6. The curry sauce is housemade and contains no msg.  I ordered it extra spicy, and it seems like they hiked up the spice levels per earlier Yelp reviews. The curry was nicely thick and fiery with a subtle sweetness. The spices could have been more developed but it was satisfying nonetheless. The katsu was perfectly fried. It was golden, crunchy, and very tender. Just as important was the rice to soak up all that curry, it had just the right amount of stickiness. I added an egg (+$2) which was overcooked. Next time, I would request it sunny side up for some egg yolk porn. Make sure to enjoy your curry with the fukujinzuke pickles that are hidden in a metal container next to the salt and pepper shakers.  \n\nAgainst my recommendation of sticking with the curry dishes, Mr. NSS ordered the Beef Teriyaki ($11): http://bit.ly/1MwhxIJ. He said it was kinda chewy but alright. I had a piece and it needed more of a sear at a higher temperature and more sauce. \n\nTo cool down the heat, we ordered the Mochi Ice Cream ($3 each) for dessert: http://bit.ly/1KtSFNf. It's just sliced and plated Mikawaya Mochi Ice Cream which I saw them pull from the freezer. The batch they got was old as the mochi was hard, and didn't have that chewy, toothsome chew. \n\nService was typical Asian service. Staff was cordial and timely when we asked for things though. We were the only ones there during dinner which was kinda awkward. I think if they offered delivery via Eat24, it may drive more business. I know I would order regularly if they did offer delivery. \n\nGood luck with parking. It can be a hair puller but we eat like old farts so we had no issues at 5 pm.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Having just recently moved to the city, I am blessed that Fumi is so close by. Actually it was the first restaurant my roommates and I first ate at once we were moved in! But other than having sentimental value, Fumi makes some bomb curry. \n\nI usually rotate between to pork katsu curry and the curry udon with chasu. The pork katsu and chasu are just alright to be honest. The best thing is very obviously the curry; I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT. It definitely has a unique taste to it that I haven't found in japanese curries elsewhere. And the best part is when you ask for spicy it is actually spicy! A+\n\nAppreciate the condiments that they leave at the table.

It was decent!\n\nWe ordered two entrees and I forgot what the other one was (those dranks really kicked in!) - but the hamburger teppan curry was AMAZEBALLS. It's pretty much a sizzling plate with rice topped with a hamburger patty and a bun. The curry sauce is poured upon being served. The sizzling sound is music to my ears :) UGHHH. SO FREAKIN GOOD. Why doesn't SF have more teppan places? The creaminess of the curry and rice and the running egg and the savory bite of the hamburger patty... HEART HEART HEART.

They are nice and they check if everything is great. \n\nI have tried the curry chashu ramen, tonkatsu chashu ramen, katsu teppan curry, and the chicken katsu curry plate. The pork in the ramen was soft and flavorful! It was like it just melted in your mouth. The broths were nicely flavored and not too salty or bland like other places I've been to. The chicen katsu comes with a nice portion of chicken, curry, rice, and has a side salad. Curry was full of flavor and the salad had some cute carrots cut into a flower/star shape. I liked the teppan curry. It's served in a sizzling plate with egg, rice, katsu, and the curry is poured in front of you for that sizzling presentation. The only thing about it....is that it was sizzling, i like to dive into my food when i get it...so  needless to say i burned my tongue haha. If you got the patience, then I highly recommend it!\n\nFor dessert we tried the iced thai tea and the green tea cheesecake. The thai tea is served in a nice little goblet type glass and a bendy straw!

I asked the waitress if they made their vegan chicken in house and I was also curious to know generally what was in this fake chicken. Before I could even ask about what was in it..she cut me off and told me \"I don't make the food so I don't know.\" And legit..somewhat ran away from me after giving me that terrible answer (and we went on a weekday when the restaurant wasn't very busy). ok....what if one of your customers had a severe allergy to something? To be clear, I don't but a lot of people do. Another waitress told me the curry was vegetarian but I'm not sure if I have that much confidence in anything they say now. I believe the wait staff should be familiar with the menu as well as the chefs.

I can be more specific if you'd like. First off, the only reason why my cousin and I chose to try this place was because the name of the restaurant on Yelp is \"Fumi Japanese Curry & Ramen.\" We found this to be misleading because the name outside the actual restaurant is \"Fumi Japanese Curry & Seafood.\" Anyway, we both ordered the Chicken Katsu Ramen, hers was spicy and mine was mild. The broth was so flavorless, we could (not) even finish half of it. It tasted like water. The chicken katsu was pretty bland and dry, too. It was also a little disappointing that some of the items that are normally standard at other ramen places, like the brown egg, are an additional charge at Fumi. Again, had we known that ramen is not a specialty at your restaurant, we wouldn't have ordered it. Hope this message is more thorough.\n\nCindy", "author": "Cindy O."}

The remodel wasn't bad, compared to what it used to look like. Anyway, onto the food.\n\nShared the chicken karage. The karage wasn't bad, was actually probably my favorite dish of the meal. Hot, moist, and flavorful... yum. Shared the pork katsu curry over rice, medium spicy. The curry wasn't flavorful, but it wasn't completely bland. It needed more curry to flavor everything, especially since you're eating it with rice. If you eat it with the rice, you lose the curry flavor. The pork katsu wasn't bad, crispy and was pretty flavorful. We also got the beef curry over noodles. The curry sauce was pretty bland with the noodles. It was pretty bland when I just slurped the curry sauce too. Some of the beef pieces were tender while others were chewy... I'm not sure how that happened. Both the spiciness levels need to be worked on too... there was no kick to it either. We even ordered a very spicy curry over rice for someone to go and they said the very spicy wasn't even spicy! So either they forgot to add the spice or they need to add more! Overall, the curry here was... average. Kind of runny, which probably explains why the sauce is bland. I'm probably happy with making curry at home out of a box. Maybe it was grand opening jitters... but I think they can definitely improve the flavor for the curry.

I've been in the restaurant industry my whole life and have managed multiple restaurants. I never leave 1 star reviews when it's not warranted. Here's the breakdown:\n\nLet's start with the good. Food: good.  If you are deciding to eat here based on the food, go for it! I honestly liked the quality and taste of the food. \n\nService: Good-bad..or gbad. \n\nLet's start with the good: Their attentiveness was great (we were one of two tables in the restaurant). \n\nThe bad: And this may not be their fault, but they apparently have no authority to replace wrong items. When ordering ramen you pick the soup base, ingredients, then order the spicy level. I ordered curry, pork, then spicy. The thing is they have 2 types of pork - Chashu or Pork katsu aka Tonkatsu pork. This may have been an oversight on my end by not specifying which one. However, the server did not ask clarification but rather assumed which one I wanted. Fair mistake on both our parts, fine. So out comes the order. As you can guess, it was the wrong pork. I politely said it was the incorrect one, can I please get the correct pork. The server responded that they could add the Chashu (for an additional charge). I said \"no, sorry, this is not what I wanted.\" They refused to replace the pork. I then asked to speak to a manager. Their response, \"We do not have a manager here.\" \nI replied \"Okayyy.. Can I speak to the owner?\" \n\"Sorry, the owner is on vacation.\"\n\nI seriously have never experienced this in my life. If a customer ever came to me and said, \"this is not what I ordered,\" I would immediately replace it, no questions asked. I have advised my staff to do this immediately if this were to happen to any customer. Sure, sometimes it's the customer's fault... SO WHAT!! You replace it!  You replace it to keep your customer happy so that they return!\n\nSo basically they refused to replace the pork, no manager or owner there to correct this or try to amend the issue, the servers have no authority (apparently) to correct this mistake, and really, this would have been the easiest thing to fix. \n\nThere's more details to the story but for the sake of not writing a novel, these were the cliffnotes. Honestly, please get a manager and have that manager present at the restaurant and/or properly train your staff to deal with these situations.", "author": "Ryan O."}

Our backgrounds are Asian American with ancestry in China and Japan, FWIW. I saw the softshell crab ramen on the menu and had to try. It is hard to find softshell crab, and it is a delicacy where I am from. Others in my group ordered curry rice and tonkotsu ramen. The restaurant is nicely appointed, modern trendy vibe, pan Asian, but not Japanese. Service was prompt and courteous. Dishes looked beautifully presented and in a manner that we usually see when we go to Japan (no piles of raw greens or veggies that don't historically exist in Asia such as tomato!). My softshell ramen seemed tasteless. The broth was soy sauce based ('shoyu ramen'). I couldn't quite figure out what was missing. It was salted well enough, but it was as though some ingredient were missing (MSG? kelp? No idea). the softshell crab was crispy, but also tasteless. I sampled a bit of everyone's fare, too. Curry rice was ok, with a hint of heat, but it tasted like the kind that comes out of the box--something I could easily whip up myself. For those with food allergies, the server did mention that the curry mix included peanut powder, so maybe those with peanut allergies should take heed. The tonkotsu ramen was also flavorless, even though the broth had the right milky consistency. The tonkatsu was served on the side, which is a good thing when they do that, because the tonkatsu (the fried pork cutlet, not to be confused with tonKOtsu, the pork broth in which the ramen is served) gets soggy if served on top of the ramen and the eater is slow. Oh, and I got the runs a few hours after I left, although my dining partenrs were fine, so I don't think I will be ordering the softshell again.", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "Really liked the chicken katsu, very crisp with good quality meat, and curry was yummy. Curried chicken was tasty. Kid's meal is a fantastic deal, with fruit, rice, protein, and salad. Curry fried rice was just ok, a little bland. Have to take down one star for service (fast and friendly, but server forgot things or they were out), but I'm hopeful that'll improve. Many restaurants have uneven service their first few weeks as they work out kinks in their processes. I've been twice and hope to go again soon.", "author": "Jen P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-31", "description": "The big question in my mind was, of course, how this would stack up to Muracci's. Not quite, but very close and close enough to nail four stars.\n\nOf course I had the curry. They have two vegetarian curries in addition to several with meat,  fish, or seafood. I ordered spicy, which I expected to be medium given the choices of mild, spicy, and extra spicy, and it was, about similar to Muracci's medium. The \"every green\" has tofu, carrots and broccoli. The default is fried tofu. I asked for un-fried and that's what they did and it was good. Nice they have a brown rice option, too. I'll be back to try the vegan chicken (gobo root). And curious about the curry noodles as well. Anyway, the curry sauce was good enough that I soaked up the generous portion with the remaining rice.\n\nThe one fish item was deep fried. It would be nice if they had a grilled option for the curry, though it looks like they have that in the teriyaki version. I'll ask next time.\n\nAlso got a side of steamed veggies, which was mostly broccoli and pleasantly al dente.\n\nThe print on the menu is small, so if you need reading glasses, bring 'em along. They also have a blown-up menu without pix in the front window before you enter.\n\nDo let them know if you want the curry sauce vegan if you're not getting the vegan curry.", "author": "Charles B."}

Never had Japanese curry before and it was surprisingly good. Not that I expected it to be bad, but in my mind curry is a little played out and is sometimes a miss. Fumi, on the other hand is worth a try! Their curry is rich and complex and the right amount of spicy. I ordered the curry with vegetables and tofu over noodles and it was the perfect solo dinner. The restaurant is warm and inviting and the service was efficient and polite.", "author": "Leslie H."}
