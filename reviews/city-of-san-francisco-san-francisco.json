It has flipped the seasons. It blossoms in the Winter. The City shines on the coldest days of the year. Yes, it is in the Summer when the City dresses itself into a long gray overcoat of cold fog and wind.  It follows its own meteorological path. Such a rebel. \n\nFog: Glorious. Enveloping. Transformative. \n\nEverywhere the fog touches becomes a mystery. A shivering blanket where every brief glimpse of blue sky is greeted with a joyful 'ooooh' and 'aaaaah'. These are Precious moments. Like fireworks or a jewel  viewed from below. \n\nDowntown is monolithic and slug like. Stained sidewalks and inching traffic. Vertical. Monochrome. The sky rises are fully occupied by drones during the day. At night all the inhabitants migrate to the tunes in the bars or the public transit and corporate busses to warmly lit homes or hovels. Buildings are empty like a hallow snail shell. A ghost town. A multi volume series waiting for its next daily episode. \n\nPeninsula magic. San Francisco is kissed and battered by the giant Pacific Ocean  to the West. The tides empty and refill the Bay every 6 hours or so. That power of nature under the Golden Gate is humbling. Commuters and travelers follow a similar cycle. They recycle and renew the city. Bringing riches in and taking riches away. Dynamic. A City in flux. It requires constant change to survive. Stop the flow and it will die. \n\n\n\"What to say\n     To the well dressed ambassadors\n     From death's truth\n     Pimplike, rich,\n     In the morning slick;\n     Or sad white caps\n     Of snowy sea men\n     In San Francisco\"\n\n- Jack Kerouac 'Book of Blues'", "author": "Brian B."}

Incredible restaurants, hotels, shopping, entertainment, history, arts, athletics, diversity, culture. Yes it's expensive but that's not the problem.

If you don't mind these same people walking around the streets like zombies or worse acting irrational thugs making you feel like you have to ready for attack or least protect your phone, wallet. If you don't mind witnessing car burglary as someone smashes a $400 side window to take an $8 car charger so that they can score more drugs...you'll love it.  \n\nSan Francisco needs understand that by tolerating this behavior she is diminishing her greatness and stunting her potential.", "author": "Barry M."}

After over 33 years working in Oakland, I needed a change in scenery for my sanity. San Francisco was the place to be for the remaining seven years of my career. I don't have any regrets for the move even though it meant more money coming out of my pocket for the daily commute and lunch. \n\nSan Francisco is the city known as the Queen of the Pacific according to an answer in a Trivial Pursuit question. Rightfully so, and San Francisco has the queens all right, and I can proudly say in the Castro District. The first place that comes to my mind is Hot Cookie and its manly shaped cookies. LOL.\n\nCivic Center, Asian Art Museum, Main Library were within walking distance close to my job. Chinatown, Macy's Union Square, Westfield Shopping Mall on Market were places I did some of my shopping and dining. Fisherman's Wharf/Pier 39 was occasionally a weekend outing during the summer. My daily commute from Alameda to San Francisco and return on the ferry boat was better than commuting by BART. Still at that time during my job career from January 2007 to March 2014, I felt there was more to San Francisco than the areas that were familiar territory to me. Then I wasn't ready or prepared to offer an opinion or a detailed experience of the City of San Francisco.\n\nA group of us from the Mastick Senior Center were on the Craig Smith bus tour of San Francisco and Treasure Island. The cost was $66, which included lunch at the Delancey Street Restaurant. Our first stop was the Ferry Building for a restroom break. Before boarding the bus, I stopped at Farm Fresh to You for a bag of chips and hard candy. Then it was a brief visit to the storefront of the ferry system for information/schedule. I love those canvas tote bags that they were selling. Browsing and eyeing the baked goods at Mariposa Baking almost had me spending more money than necessary. (Another time, another day for those croissants, muffins, scones, etc.) \n\nOn this tour my husband and I were able to see other parts of San Francisco that we have never been to - Trinity Place where the Venus statue is, Millennial Tower (it's leaning all right), beyond AT&T Park, the Dogpatch area and construction of the new Chase Center (future home of the Golden States Warriors). Our tour guide mentioned that ferry service would be available for Warriors fan coming from the East Bay side. That's a good thing to know, as there are ferry terminals in Alameda, Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond and Vallejo. Along the way the bus driver did a drive by so we could see the new police station, areas being developed around Pier 70 and the Esprit Park near the old Esprit de Corp building (a company ran by Susan Tompkins). There are areas yet to be developed, and I doubt if it will happen soon because of the toxic soil.\n\nThe tour of the City was truly enlightening and quite enjoyable for this lady from the Town. (For those who are not familiar with the City and the Town, City is San Francisco; Town is Oakland. I was given the nickname Oaktown Chong for a reason...lol.) Just as much as I love Oakland and Alameda for what they have to offer, I love San Francisco the same. Yes, I have the best in these three cities. I was born, raised and worked in Oakland; Alameda has been my home for almost 30 years; and San Francisco for the seven years of my job career and for the shopping, dining, museums, cultural events, farmer's market at the UN Plaza, Off the Grid at the Civic Center Plaza. Then I can't forget Stephen Curry Day back in 2013 at City Hall, an event that the late Mayor Ed Lee and his staff organized.\n\nFinally, one of my friends calls San Francisco \"Baghdad by the Bay\" for its shopping mecca, the different districts (multicultural and diverse) and a place where one can go on tours; be it by walking, by bus or car.", "author": "Carol C."}

I don't think I would ever want to live here, but it's a nice city to visit every once in a while.\n\nTransportation:\nYour best bet is to take public transportation everywhere. I prefer to walk as much as possible. Driving can be such a nightmare, especially when it comes to parking. I would not suggest renting a car. Uber and Lyft work quite well, but those rides can really add up.\n\nWeather:\nSuper cold, super windy. Summers are just as cold as winters, but less wet. Pack a coat and sturdy walking shoes! \n\nMy tourist-y recommendations:\n- Ferry Building Marketplace for culture and good food.\n- Crissy Field.\n- Golden Gate Bridge.\n- Dolores Park.\n- Fisherman's Wharf.\n- Lombard Street.\n- Alcatraz Island.\n- Coit Tower.\n- Chinatown.\n- Japantown.\n- Ghirardelli Square.\n...There's so much more to explore in this city, I know, but these are some of my favorites.\n\nWhat to Avoid:\nI'd suggest skipping Haight-Ashbury. I thought it would be like Venice Beach in Los Angeles, but it ended up being a huge, dirty disappointment. No worthwhile shops or attractions, anyway. My friend, a resident of San Fran, advised me several times to avoid Haight-Ashbury -- I decided to drag us there, anyway. Well, joke was on me.\n\nWord of Advice:\nKeep your wits about you, day and night. This is a relatively welcoming city, but not all of its residents are exceptionally friendly. During my walking adventures around San Francisco, I've passed plenty of sketchy areas. Watch where you step and don't flash your belongings around. This is true for all cities all over the world, sure, but definitely keep it in mind around here. Some parts are pretty rough. Oh, and everything is extra expensive in San Fran, too -- expect surcharges anywhere you buy or eat.", "author": "Kathy Z."}

The City is filled with newer generation businesses and residence (Gen X and Millennials).  \n\nThese businesses are unique & special since there are MORE small business owners in this area than anywhere else in the country.  Thus, they are NOT \"cookie-cutter\" businesses.  I feel this is due to the creative and passionate ideas of the newer generations along with those landlords who see the longevity in small business versus the Herculean large or medium businesses.\n\nThe diversity of areas in The City make San Francisco so unique in it's culture.  It's similar to New York, or Paris, or London, or Tokyo. But without everything opened for 24 hours. Once 6am, The City hustles and bustles till mid-night.

It's quite fitting for Margaret Cho of Yelp to review this stunning city I will always call home.  SF is indeed the \"Paris of the West\" - I don't wish to be anywhere else!  Who doesn't leave their heart in SF?  Not really a question.\n\nThe list would be too long if I listed all the things I used to do as a kid, and still miss 'til this day.  I grew up in the Outer Richmond district with all the Chinese and Russian kids; my best friend was a Russian girl named Victoria.  Long before Yelp, there was nothing out there by Ocean Beach, so we'd play along the beach & at the beach, Golden Gate Park, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9canique, Cliff House, Sutro Baths, Sutro Heights Park, Great Highway, etc.  \n\nPlayland-at-the-Beach had shut down by then.  We played hide and seek by the windmills near what's now the Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant.  There were only large pillars there and lots of RV's parked at the beach.  Now that I look back, I think most who parked their trailers out there were probably pedophiles, (this was the time missing kids were on milk cartons).  They didn't want to kidnap me, as they were probably looking for some blonde hair, blue-eyed kid.  Of all those times I played hide and seek outside their trailers, they were probably more annoyed of me than wanting to kill me.  Then again...I don't want to think about that, moving onto this great city.  Btw, kids played outside back then unlike now.  I had a great childhood besides almost drowning a few times at Ocean Beach. \n\nMy mom never wanted me to go to the other side of the city or other neighborhoods aka districts i.e., Mission, Bayview, Potrero, Excelsior, Bernal Heights, Haight, Marina, Portola, Hayes Valley, Noe Valley, Fisherman's Wharf, Visitation, TL, Silver, Glendale, Diamond Heights, Twin Peaks, Sunset, etc., but did I listen...nope!  As I grew up, I took Muni everywhere, then when I got my first car as a teen, I drove to Esprit Outlet over the railroad tracks, exactly where she told me not to ever go.  Ironically, mom would take me to Marine World Africa USA outside of city limits, shop at Levitz furniture store, and go to San Jose for the flea market WTH!  \n\nI loved every moment exploring this wonderful city, I mean it's such a small city.  I miss the days of bowling in Japantown, late night Denny's at Japantown, going to Cala's to get junk food after school and watch Thelma & Louise at a friend's house.  We would hit up Zim's, Doggie Diner, the old Cliff House (before the remodel), Kezar stadium where the 9ers played before Candlestick, the old Exploratorium, Coronet & Alexandria theaters, FAO Schwarz + Sanrio across the street, Tic Toc burgers, Tower Records, etc.  I loved running the streets of SF, still do! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fishermans-wharf-san-francisco-3?select=EB0CmVglwna27xVeKHsqTw&reviewid=j3piaXYVkAD__jy8g6OlcA   \n\nI still love the Presidio, remember when there was a Burger King with the best view.  We used to practice our JROTC drills in the Presidio on the weekends during my high school years; I sure miss the commissary & PX days.  We had epic parties at the Presidio Officers' Club...fond memories.https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/presidio-officers-club-san-francisco?select=r5uO9I7Vj6GMNyzlRr9jCw\n\nI miss all the Yet Wah's, still have a pic from when our dance troupe performed upstairs at the Clement location.  I miss Woolworth's and Emporium.  I miss Equinox the revolving restaurant on top of Embarcadero Hyatt.  Let's not forget Cow Palace, where the Warriors and San Jose Sharks once played, all the drive-in movies, the circus, concerts, rodeo, etc.  Those were the good 'ole days.  \n\nDid you know OJ Simpson is from SF, he went to Galileo High and played football there - we all try to forget that.  At least we can say Danny Glover is truly from SF!  So many more famous people from SF, the list is endless.  I miss how local attractions were free like Coit Tower, State Parks, less than $1 to drive across the GGB, museums were less costly, etc.  I also miss seeing the Brown twins in the streets of SF when shopping.  SF is truly a melting pot!  Besides Uber and Lyft drivers getting on my nerves who can't drive and don't know where they're going these days, SF will always be apart of me.  Times sure have changed, and we all have to embrace it.  Sometimes it's for the better, sometimes it's not.  SF has always been expensive, but now it's just ridiculous! \n\nI'm also ready for the next big earthquake, stocking up on all the necessities.  Where were you during Loma Prieta if you weren't attending World Series at Candlestick?  I was at home about to watch the Earthquake Series on TV and munching on a turkey Dutch Crunch roll before things started shaking and rolling, good times! LOL\n\nKeep on Yelpin' and stay classy SF!

I have such a deep appreciation for the city, its history, its weather, and all that has come from it. That being said, it wasn't until my recent visit that I realized how much big cities can be overwhelming! Being a Canadian from Calgary (one of the largest cities in Canada), I always think that I have experience in big cities but then I go to the States and realize that I know nothing in comparison to you folks down South.\n\nThe state of California has as many people as my entire country and the sheer amount of folks that are wandering around blows my mind. That being said, the levels of development, innovation, and absolute brilliance that come out of this state, and especially this city, are spectacular. I would love to come to San Francisco at some point to work or live and really get into studying the city. Additionally, if there are any visitors to the city who are looking to have a mentally expansive insider tour of the city, I highly recommend looking up Free SF Tour. They run out of Union Square and run their tours with lovely facts, awesome humour, and interesting stops along the way. Besides the tour, I also recommend spending a morning at the Ferry Terminal Farmers Market and, if you can, catching the sunrise whilst there. It's a lively, fun place with awesome vendors and views, and you can pick up some great artisan crafts along the way to or from the docks. The vendors line up all the way down the streets, starting from here!\n\nWhilst in San Francisco, I had the pleasure of working in the Financial District (thank you Yelp!!) and thus, got the opportunity to REALLY experience the city, with great work at a hip and innovative tech company included! To be completely honest, it made the stereotype that Canadians have of SF come entirely true! ;)\n\nI can't wait to go back and enjoy the fresh SF salmon, cheap healthy food, good weather, and lovely people that this city has to offer. See you (hopefully) very soon, California!", "author": "Simon L."}

SF has been an important part of my life in so many ways.  I chose UC Berkeley for grad school over Purdue and Northwestern largely because of the proximity to SF and its mild year-long weather.  My maternal grandparents live in SF, as do many uncles, aunts, cousins, and extended family.  I met my wife through a blind date, and yep it happened in SF.  Lastly, SF (along with the entire Bay Area) just seems like the best place to launch a career.  Companies like Twitter, AirBnB, Charles Schwab, Uber, Chevron, and Yelp all started in SF!\n\nSF is far from perfect like any other big city.   Housing is insanely expensive and many neighborhood and BART stations are dirty have lots of homeless.  Still, the good far outweigh the bad I think.  We still come to SF for good eats, great shows, and to experience the culture as local tourists.  Some of my favorite SF traditions are:\n\n1. Best Splurge Meals: 3-Michelin Benu and Quince\n2. Best Chicken: Dry-fried wings at San Tung, Chicken and Waffles at Bluestem Brasserie\n3. Best Museums: SFMOMA, Academy of Science, and Asian Art Museum\n4. Nice Walks: Golden Gate Park, Embarcadero\n5. Best Pork Chop: Prospect\n6. Cheap and good Chinese Food: Golden Horse\n7.  Best Seafood: Nomica\n8. Best Lamb: Kokkari Estiatorio\n9.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-06", "description": "My celebratory 600 review goes to one of my favorite places in the world, San Francisco, the city by the bay that never ceases to amaze me with its beauty, mystery and endless charm. It was love at first sight and since then I keep discovering it. This city has amazing views everywhere you go when you turn around a corner, endless activities, many neighborhoods to explore, a great restaurant scene, it's fun to walk it, easier to conquer since it's not that spread out.\n\nYou can spend here as much or little as you can, a weekend trip or a longer vacation. You won't see it all, but that's all good. Next time, right? Because you'll want a next time. You can do many day trips from here to Berkeley, Napa Valley, Sausalito, Monterey, up and down the coast. Or just explore SF. \n\nBring comfy shoes to brave the uphill and downhill areas and layers of clothes, no matter the time of the year you visit. I was never warm in SF, but that never stopped me to enjoy it.\n\nTheir transit system is great, easy to navigate, get a map and I advise you to get a Visitor Pass (1 day= $21, 3 Day=$32, 7 Day=$42). It includes cable car rides (one is $7), so it's worth it. You can rent a car, but parking is tough and you can walk a lot, so between walking and public transpo, you'll be good, it's easier and cheaper. Cab drivers are crazy, we were about to get killed one night, cable cars drivers and tram ones could be cranky, but it's SF, you'll joke about it later. Go to Union Square where they turn the cable cars around, it's a fun spectacle, you have to do that once! They have a free Cable Cars Museum, so check it out. \n\nSF has an array of great museums, if you love culture, you're in the lack: Legion of Honor (featured in \"Vertigo\") has classic artwork (Rodin), located on the verge of the ocean, De Young, more contemporary art, in the midst of Golden Gate Park, SF Museum of Modern Art (I still need to visit), the cool Asian Art Museum, Exploratorium, Musee Mecanique and the list goes on.\n\nAs long as your hotel has a good location - near Lombard st (the crookedest street), Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, North Beach, Russian Hill, you'll be able to walk to many attractions.\n\nYou have Lombard st., Hyde st. pier, Fisherman's Warf, Musee Mecanique, Pier 39 with the cute sea lions as main attractions. You can visit Ghirardelli Square near by, have an ice-cream, service isn't great, but might as well do it. The Ferry Building is cool and has great eateries inside.\n\nDon't forget Chinatown (great bakeries and cheaper restaurants), biggest on West Coast, North Beach with the Beat Museum and City Lights Bookstore, Nob Hill. I love Marina (with Palace of Fine Arts and Golden Gate Beach). The beaches are pretty, but not great for sunbathing. You should see the famous bridge up close. \n\nOn my next visits I started to dig deeper: Castro, Russian Hill, Filmore District, Haight-Ashbury (with the Painted Ladies included), Richmond district, Sutro Baths. So many areas to explore, revisit, dig deeper into. I have a list for next time, because I miss the city and there's more to explore. It's a fun city to explore anytime of the year.\n\nThere are great restaurants wherever you go, some pricey, some not so much, reasonable, look into, make a plan, the city is expensive, but you can spend very little money if you do your homework. The culinary scene represents every ethnicity that's out there and they do it well. \nCulture? Great vistas? Great food? Great wine? SF has it all. It's unique, fun, surprising, it never cease to amaze me, I feel like it's so much more left for me to discover. \n\nSo, what are you waiting for, put some flowers in your hair, SF is waiting for you!", "author": "Jo S."}

On a couple of occasions we saw hypodermic needles at Ghirardelli and Union Square\n4). Homeless people laying all over the sidewalks as soon as it gets dark\n5).

The politicians need to do a better job to address these issues and find the right balance between social welfare, laws and tourism as a major source of income for this city.\n\nI am not sure why such a popular family vacation destination would be allowed to deteriorate to such a deplorable state that it made me uncomfortable walking around town with my kids.", "author": "Kathy T."}

Shocked by my revelation, I purchased a special optical device which emits ultraviolet light to use during a portion of our classes at night: urine and feces fluoresce under ultraviolet light.  While filming, I noted the horrifying truth -- and documented it on camera.\n\nThe results are as sickening as they are revolting.\n\nEverywhere I looked, on sidewalks and streets, evidence of feces could be found.  Everywhere.  Taking this light into several popular coffee shops and fast-food restaurants was an education I'll not soon forget.  Everywhere I looked, I could find signs that human feces had been tracked into the store or restaurant.\n\nAccording to one report -- from Dr. Lee Riley, epidemiologist from UC Berkeley -- San Francisco has the worst public health problem from the contamination of human feces of any city in the United States.  Riley believes that parts of San Francisco have worse problems than many under-developed countries such as Africa, Brazil, and India.  Dried human feces often contains rotavirus, which, when inhaled, can spread an infection to the intestines which can be fatal to children, the elderly, and otherwise healthy people.  It's deadly, and it's everywhere.\n\nOther, bacterial infections such as E. Coli also pose significant public health issues: think about this when you eat at an open air restaurant in the city, or purchase food from an open air vendor.  An E.

That's what San Francisco was like for me. You see it in all these shows, movies, and Instagram posts- but there is nothing like being there in the flesh.\n\nLike any big city, there are pros/cons, extremes, and quirks that make it unique: lots of people, traffic, culture, impoverished areas, uppity areas, thriving work culture, tons and tons of food options, lots of entertainment, sights to see, stores everywhere and more.\n\nI enjoyed my time here, but by the end of my trip- I was ready to leave. I can appreciate the unique beauty of how compact this city is, but ultimately I prefer being somewhere more spacious.

I'll keep it simple...\n\nTOURIST SH*T \n-Golden Gate Bridge (Karl the Fog)\n-Waterfront/Alcatraz (smelly and cold)\n-Golden Gate Park (be ware of the homeless people sleeping)\n-Chinatown (first Chinatown in US and overrated food)\n-Lombard Street (get the facts straight, the most crooked street in the city is actually Vermont street) \n-Twin Peaks \n-Trolly rides/Union Square \n... just to name a few.\n\nFAVORITE STREET FESTIVALS (of many)\n-SantaCon SF\n-Bay to Breakers \n-Fleet Week\n-Fillmore Jazz Festival\n-How Weird Street Fair\n-Pride (no I'm not bakla but they sure know how to party)\n... I been to all festivals and these are my favorite cause I love getting festive and dressing up in costumes. \n\nSPORTS\n-SFGiants (baseball, my favorite team and sport)\n-49ers \n-Golden State Warriors\n- (Oakland A's and Raiders for those eastbay folks)\n... been to many games and all their parks and stadiums. Ballpark is my favorite hangout in SF. \n\nFOOD\nLog on Yelp (desktop view) to see my lists. (Still updating). \n\nNEIGHBORHOODS.\nThere's so many. And each has their own personality. I've lived in several neighborhoods. Born in Presidio and lived in Lower Pac Heights (divisidero & pine area). I've moved out of state several times but always found myself returning and relocating to Daly City (the mini Manila of America) next to SF. I don't know what it is. It I have a deep connection with my hood... BayArea/SF has my soul. Every time I'm away, I miss it. \n\nTHE HUSTLE.\nIf you ain't a techie... you may be out of place. Lol. Great place to chase your career goals - city is made of innovation. It's expensive to live there but the salaries are high. But trust me when I say this... this city is a hustle and bustle and work/life balance is not often given. Expect to work all the time. The pace is fast and your day goes by so quickly. It's all about the white collar hustle in SF/BayArea. What you do, what company you work for... has to be reputable. I had an amazing career working in a rare position with the top firms in the world. But the hustle can burn you out. Any techie can tell you that. You have been warned!", "author": "Jane A."}

I do not frequent it as much as San Diego due to it sitting six hours north of me. But a weekend excursion sometimes brings me here.\nThere is plenty to see and do in this metropolis. The suburbs of San Jose sit in an area dubbed the \"south bay.\" Not to be confused with LA's south bay, where I grew up. Berkeley and Oakland sit to the east of the bay, accessed from the downtown area via the Oakland Bay Bridge. North of the downtown area sits Marin County, and further up the cities of Napa and Sonoma. Getting there requires a drive through the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThe city is great to visit. I recommend staying at a hotel outside of the downtown area, and commuting from there.

I can half a day at Fisherman's Wharf and surrounding areas, and another half looking for coffee.  The GGB is also one of those things you just marvel at.  The best part is that you can walk back and forth on the bridge as much as you want (just dress warm).\n\nFrom Downtown Union Square, to the CA Academy of Science, to Lombard Street and the Golden Gate Bridge, the City of San Fransisco is a place that you MUST visit while in California!

With all the shady people walking around, it was made worse by the fact that your vehicle is not safe and the parking situation is ridiculous.

I check SFMTA website before parking and determined that parking restrictions were not being enforced and I got a street sweeping ticket anyway, when clearly there was no street sweeping occurring during the hours posted. There were still hypodermic needles all over the place. I ended up paying $73 for parking as a result. Hindsight.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-07", "description": "This city is an absolute disgrace in every aspect! If there was a way to rate it with negative stars, I defientely would!\n\nHaving visited California many times, but never making it to San Francisco, we were extremely excited to enjoy all of the history and entertainment that the city has to offer. However, we were so disappointed that we decided to leave after a mere 36 hours (two days ahead of schedule). \n\nEverything about this city is EXTREMELY expensive, epscially when it comes to prices controlled by the municipality. This not only relates to taxes, but to parking, which in many places is a whopping six dollars PER HOUR on WEEKENDS at PUBLIC meters! \n\nThe street signs/indicators painted on the pavement as well as those above ground (i.e. on poles and traffic light lines) are as ambiguous as can be. This makes sense, however, considering how ticket-happy the city is.\n\nWe were in town for 36 hours and received TWO parking tickets for $150 EACH. We received one for being three minutes late getting back to the car, parked along the road DIRECTLY in front of our hotel entrance, from checking in; talk about waiting eagerly to gouge visitors. \n\nThe second was one parking space slightly further back from the original one in which we received a ticket. It was for not moving the car in time for street cleaning. This was EXCEPTIONALLY interesting since there weren't any signs posted on either side of the street indicating that cars needed to be moved prior to a certain time for street cleaning on Saturday mornings. We even found a parking enforcement officer and asked him to show us the indicator, to which he replied \"there aren't any, you should know.\" Despite this, he refused to redact the citation - he told us to take it up with the city..\n\nUp and down every street there were homeless people, who were being ticketed and moved instead of helped! Although the issue of homelessness is seemingly more pervasive in San Francisco than in other major cities[i.e. homelessness GALORE], it should not be a care blanche to try to capitalize off of people who cannot afford a meal! Evidently, the city has no shame!\n\nOne would think that with such relentless/merciless financial impositions the city would at least invest in safe roads and infrastructure; sorry, this is not the case. The \"park\" at the Golden Gate Bridge, which was filled with families and a swarm of people who were participating in a marathon [thousands of people streaming through for over an hour] showed no signs of being a solidified park, as the signs indicated it was supposed to be. It was merely dirt/sand and gravel, giving the impression of a construction site, which aligned the bay. \n\nAt one point, it even lead those who were walking/running directly through the busy parking lot, and then it picked up on the other side of the lot! It seems that safety isn't an issue when the city is wealthy. Benches, recreational structures/facilities, and any sort of development was sparse there, if it existed at all.\n\nMost of the roads on which we travelled were broken and EXTREMELY bumpy, to the extent that they were almost throwing the car, and had extensive potholes[good thing we were driving a rented car].\n\nTolls were not always indicated, almost never had an attendant, and drivers were not able to pay their toll-by-plate fees to the collector[i.e. state or private company to whom the state outsources]! The \"deal\" which the bureaucrats worked out with the rental car companies is that if a rented car goes through a toll which is not attended, and often not even indicated, unless the person prepaid the tolls through the rental companiy, the toll PLUS a $25 fee PER TOLL is assessed to the renter through the rental car company for their own profit. Our company did not tell us about this \"program,\"  let alone offer it to us. Thus, all we could do was wait for the bill for every toll we didn't know we went through plus a $25 fee for EACH. \n\nOn top of that, nearly all attractions need to be booked WELL in davance - not a city which is conducive to planning even a couple of weeks in advance. When we inquired about getting on wait lists in case those who booked in advance didn't show up, attendants at just about every attration said that it wasn't an option, even if there was a last-minute opening, or they would just shrug us off. \n\nThis city ties the hands of those who attempt to experience and patronize it, furthermore gouging everyone at the turn of every corner. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go somewhere else - anywhere else. All of the \"third world\" countries to which we have travelled are more accommodating/hospitable, appreciative, and civilized - no exaggeration!

I then went to college in Washington State, and as fate would have it, I MARRIED a Californian who brought me back to Northern California in 1986 after she graduated from nursing school.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the marriage didn't last past 1990, but fortunately for me, I ended up finding my home in Sacramento (\"SacTown\") have been here since.\n\n\"THE CITY!\" \n\nBut ever since that time, I was always struck by single friends who would take me clubbing with them down to San Francisco, except they would say, \"Come with us to 'The City' to go dancing!\" (And this was ALWAYS said with enthusiasm since it meant leaving the central valley dust of Sacramento, even if for just a quick night's pop down there and back within the space of 7-8 hours).  \n\nI found this reference at first amusing since in point of reference, Sacramento WAS a \"City\" too - so I never fully understand why \"The City\" referred to San Francisco only.  But hey, \"When in Rome\" (another \"City\", by the way) I just accepted that as part of my local indoctrination for all things Californian.  \n\nSAN FRANCISCO - THE THINGS I LOVE\n\n\"The City\" has come to mean many fun things to me, and in no particular order, here's what I think of when I think \"San Francisco\":\n\n* The closest \"Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf\" locations to SacTown so that I have to coordinate a visit there before their 10:30pm closing time, when already down there for clubbing - to obtain one or two canisters of their AWESOME \"Fat Free / No Sugar Added Special Dutch Chocolate Powder\"\n\n* Where I first became aware of the Folsom Street Faire and the entire Fetish Culture (I STILL love going to \"Wicked Grounds\", the awesome Fetish-inspired coffee shop @ 8th & Folsom)\n\n* And speaking of 8th & Folsom, just around that corner is the Cat Club, the most amazing Dive Bar / Dance Club that has been the social mecca of my life now since 1998 (thank you Randy M. and Rachel S.), with a dozen or so different Club Event Nights - and double the number of promoters who have since become my friends (Damon, Tomas, Melting Girl, Joe Radio, Skip, Shindog, and many more).\n\n* Mary Catherine, Kat, Patty - the city where my last serious relationships & love life (post-divorce) have all seemed to sprung up.\n\n* The Warfield, Slim's, Bimbo's, The Filmore, The Regency, The Mezzadine, etc. etc., you get my drift?  Some of the most hap'nin venues to see live shows at anywhere in Northern California.\n\nTHE THINGS I \"HATE\"\n\nFull-disclosure is important here:\n\n* Parking SUCKS - it's either hard to find on the streets and/or the parking garages are very expensive.  However, they are possible to find - just requires some extra time to manage to make sure you factor that in when you go visit SF....but....\n\n* ...THAT can be a crap shoot any day OR any night of the week - the traffic from SacTown to SF, AND from SF back to SacTown is schizophrenic AT BEST.  With ideal road conditions, it can take 75-90 mins to get to SF.  You may think you are planning ahead on 2 hours to get down there, and *BAM!* a car accident or weekend traffic can take 4 hours.  By the same token, you plan on 4 hours next time and it only takes you 75 minutes.  SCHIZOPHRENIC.\n\n* BREAK-INS & TOWINGS - I've had my car broken into 4-5 times in the last 10 years, and even with the best precautions (ie. stowing things in the trunk), the back window is broken into, rear seat ripped forward, etc., and I've lost things as precious to me as a suitcase of favorite steampunk clothing, a new tablet-laptop, and a birth certificate.  And then, when you're getting your freak on with a new beautiful lady and, *damitol*, you forget to check the street signage near her home and you wake up to a towed vehicle:  the level of SUCK doesn't begin to describe the ordeal to get to the Justice Center at 7th & Bryant to break your vehicle out of car-jail. \n\n* HOUSING AFFORDABILITY?  That went out the window during the last Millennium. \n\nCAVEATS\n\nSorry.  I know I'll get a LOT of haters from this next point, but I really do NOT think San Francisco in this DAY & AGE is an ideal place to raise children.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nSo San Francisco is a mixed bag.

It was five years ago today on November 3rd, 2011 that I arrived at SFO, got on BART and emerged in The City as a resident.  I will have to confess, I was very happy to be here, but I would have been very surprised to think that I'd be sitting down to write a Yelp review five years to the day later.  But, here I am.  And, for as much as I have seen and done, I still feel like I have hardly scratched the surface.  \n\nSan Francisco is an amazing city.  It is The City.  I came for the first time back in 2009 for my first week of training at my current job.  I'll never forget coming up from the Powell Street Station and being on Market Street.  Walking up Powell Street to the hotel.  Going to dinner and sitting in the Starlight Room looking out over the buildings and the hills and the pink skies.  That first week was amazing.  Monday night on Haight Street, Tuesday night on Columbus Avenue, Wednesday night in Chinatown, Thursday night in The Castro.  They days were spent going around to many different parts of The City - now places I see every day.  San Francisco has this energy that is hard to equal - because it is both intense and positive.  And, it's just a beautiful environment.\n\nI could go on and on, but I had another idea...  A Top 10 List!  So, here you go - The Top 10 Things that Adam S. loves about SF:\n\n10.  You're in California.  California is the best of the 50 States.  That's just a fact.\n9.  Tons of tourists, many coming from distant places.  While it may be annoying to get stuck behind a Tourist Photo-Shoot or the group that walks 7-wide on a sidewalk, it is cool live in a global tourist destination.\n8.  POPOS.  What's a POPOS, you ask?  Privately Owned Public Open Spaces.  Did you know that a certain percentage of new downtown development has to be devoted to Public Space or Public Art?  Did you know there are roof top desks sprinkled through out downtown?\n7.  The San Francisco Giants.  Yeah, I got here five years ago so I was here for '12 and '14.  The Giants are the best.  Going to games is great - I love AT&T Park.  Watching the games on TV is great - I love Kruk and Kuip.  Mad Bum, Buster, Hunter...  Lou Seal is the best mascot ever (Sorry Dinger and Stomper... and those Sausages in Milwaukee).  And they get bonus points for Bruce Bochey's Amici's commercials.     \n6.  The Parks.  Actually, both Golden Gate Park and The Presidio could alone make this list.  Throw on such gems as Washington Square Park, Huntington Park, Lafayette Park, Alta Visa Park.  The Aquatic Park and everything over to the Golden Gate Bridge.  I barely go to Delores Park, but a lot of people love it.  This neglects the dozens and dozens of smaller spots that I love.\n5.  The Food.  And, since we're on Yelp you can do your own research on the quality of food offerings here.  But, remember, it's not just dining out.  There are also great shops and terrific Farmers Markets (like the Ferry Building Farmers Market, which could be an entry itself.)\n4.  The Neighborhoods.  It is so cool to be able to go to so many different areas that feel so unique.  Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square, The FiDi/SoMa, The Mission can conceivably be hit in about a two hour walk.  You see a lot along the way.  Of course there's The Marina, Cow Hollow, Pacific Hieight, Japantown, The Fillmore, The Haight, The Castro.  Inner and Outer Sunsets and Richmonds.  NoPa, Alamo Square and Hayes Valley.  Nob and Russian Hills!  The TL!!!  (There are more 'hoods, too) \n3.  The Natural Environment.  Bay, Ocean, Hills, Year-Round Spring Climate.  I know there are those who wish it were warmer...  Not Adam S.\n2.  Yelping.  OK, maybe I'm sucking up a little but I think of it this way:  Yelp is about exploring and seeking out the best cool experiences.  It is the explorer's best friend.  It's not surprising that Yelp was born here in SF.  There is always something to do.  Always.  You will never be bored in SF. \n1.   Lots of Smart People.  Everywhere I go I meet Smart, Interesting People.  People come from all over the world to live in SF.  To live here, you have to be pretty engaged, otherwise I'm not sure you would really enjoy being in the middle of this every day.  I love getting to hear the different stories and the amazing things that people have going on in their lives.\n\nHonorable Mentions:  Uber, Solid Public Transit, Crabs, Garlic Fries, Asian Food in general, Cable Cars, Beer, Bridges, Pro Sports that are located in nearby cities (particularly one that will be in SF soon!), Emperor Norton, Fisherman's Wharf, The Ferry Building, Art School, Rent Control, Golden Boy Pizza, SFPD and SFFD - Love you folks!, Asian Fusion, Barbary Coast Trail, Adult Slides, SF History, No Need to Drive, Chowder, Polk Gulch, ... etc. \n\nDraw-Backs: $$$x$$$=$$$$$ and rising, Big Time Homeless Problem, 10 cents for a Bag, It's loud.

I enjoy visiting this city for many reasons. There are so many places to see and do. For one thing, we come here to get away from the heat in the Valley but we visit the City to just enjoy the day here. We did the \"tourist\" thing and spent time at Pier 39. Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli Square and Hyde St Pier, drove down Lombard Street (the famous \"Crookedest Street\") and went to that 210-foot fire-nozzle shaped building called COIT Tower located atop Telegraph Hill (we didn't go to the top, though, we should have... next time!). We love historic sites and landmarks and explored the ruins at Sutro Baths, visited Fort Point and the U.S.S. Pampanito, \n\nWe've enjoyed afternoons at Crissy Field and Presidio, Golden Gate Park, Twin Peaks, Chinatown and Japantown, We've toured Alcatraz, rode the tram in Angel Island State Park and we even took an interesting tour at the SF Armory (shh...). We joined a whale watching CA coast Eco tour and sailed on a boat named \"Kitty Kat\", sailed the Red and White Fleet's Golden Gate Bay Cruise from Pier 43-1/2 and saw the Golden Gate Bridge at a whole new angle... from underneath!   \n\nWitnessed weddings at the General's Residence in Fort Mason and at Westin St. Francis Hotel. Visited the Old Mint Building and just recently we had a chance to visit the California Academy of Sciences. Although, I have not been inside the AT&T park to watch a ball game I did get a chance to walk around the perimeter and check out the place from the outside.\n\nWe've had some of our casual dining experiences here at Lou's Pier 47 Restaurant and Blue's Club, Pier Market Seafood Restaurant, and Fisherman's Grotto.#9, and Souffle Cafe on Powell St. We've seen many shows and musicals at the Curran and Orpheum Theaters and Golden Gate Theater. Although we've passed by the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge numerous times I have not caught the Bay Bridge all lit up (\"The Bay Lights\"). There's still so many places to visit and revisit!

But I have just envisioned to study abroad like my uncle had and imagined all the family members would look up with admiring at me. Also i pictured in my mind that my uncle would be my date because he was really handsome and had good manners every college girls fell in love with him as fast as the lightning from the sky. But, the time flied so fast and arriving the time my uncle leave, my heart sank to let him go. Even tears rolling down on my both cheeks as I hid in the attic attached to the kitchen, as if my flesh and bones had torn apart from my body. \n\nMy uncle gave me some perfumes and less valuable things which left of the presents he prepared from Canada. And he sent post card as he stopped once in San Francisco on the way home in Canada to show feeling guilty not good enough for me while he staying at my home. But I was really delighted as i got a post card my uncle sent me with TransAmerica building in it.\n\nTwenty years later, I visited San Francisco with my two kids. I directly went to the TransAmerica building after I disembarked from Korean Air at SFO. How nice it was. My two kid, 7 and 8, didn't understand as i explained how i felt. I roamed around the China Town few times to see the TransAmerica Building which I dreamed of seeing real one and a period of time I fantasied to marry to my uncle. \n\nFew weeks ago, I visited SF as one of my students invited me.

Daily I watched the wealthy stone faced privileged walk past the poor even stepping over them avoiding all eye contact as they entered chic stores. \nFive long weeks I became aquainted with working locals whom referenced the needy homeless and the mentally ill as \"zombies\" (they are human beings), these people didn't even have restrooms to use. There were elderly sleeping on the ice cold pavement in the rain wearing only socks on their feet, this experience hurt my heart beyond repair. This problem is huge and it's real, occurring in one of the wealthiest communities in California.\nI witnessed St. Patty's day which consisted of privileged drunks on floats partying as they passed by the starving whom were sitting on sidewalks being  waved and laughed at by the partying wealthy locals, such a shameful community. There is no beauty to see in city where quite literally people are dying right before your eyes yet the city officials turn a blind eye. \nI would not recommend tourist come here because it is not safe nor pleasant but rather it is vile, heartbreaking, and disturbing. Shame on the media for not reporting this dire situation to the world, shame on the Mayor, Governor, Community, shame on all of the tech companies here whom could make a difference yet choose to do nothing, how  ironic that the hypocrisy runs so deep in a city whom pretends to bleed compassion.

We visited the establishment on Friday, December 15, 2017 and on Saturday, December 16, 2017.  \n\nLeaving the restaurant on Saturday we saw a flyer on a telephone pole (looked like a garage sale sign or a missing puppy sign) which stated to beware of break-ins.  Well, a little late, as when we got back to our vehicle the back window had already been bashed in and we were robbed of our luggage.  The Federal agent who stopped by stated that four (4) other vehicles had already been broken into that morning so we were now the 5th and to call 311.  5 vehicles before Noon.  I shudder to think what the numbers were by late afternoon.\n\nThe Cliff House is obviously aware that robbery is prevalent in front of the business but don't want to put too many signs out.  Wouldn't be a good marketing tool - but it would seems like the responsible thing to do.  A security officer patroling up and down the walk and security surveillance cameras would be a thought.  This isn't rocket science.  This is common sense!\n\nI strongly discourage people to stay far from Cliff House.  Of course, unless you want your vehicle's windows bashed in and your possessions taken, then this is the place for you! The Cliff House will offer no assistance as prominent signage would most likely detract from business  and you wouldn't want that.  Clearly the management couldn't care less about much else than the bottom line at the end of the day.  \n\nThis behavior is a travesty and the passive demeanor demonstrated by the Cliff House to a very serious situation is, quite frankly, more than frightening.", "author": "Karen B."}

Coming here for a week, I loved being super close to the Embarcadero - the feeling of living close to water is amazing. In addition, I loved the hills here, although I won't really prefer to walk here. Everything is fairly close together, I walked to most of the famous attractions in one day at San Francisco. In addition, there's many options for travelling - e.g. taking the Caltrain, walking, Uber, Taxi, Lyft, bike, walking or the cable car. The San Francisco fog with the Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful, but so was the Palace of Fine Arts, Bay Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf and the Bay Bridge. \n\nHousing prices were very expensive though and because housing is so expensive, there's many people who are unable to find a place to live. This is extremely sad considering that the biggest tech offices are here, worth billions of dollars and that some money can't be donated to create a living space for some of these people and a clean bathroom for them to use. Instead, San Francisco rather spend X million dollars a year to clean up the feces on the floor. \n\nThe lack of rain, although makes the weather beautiful everyday, makes it really difficult to have green space here. There were a few spaces in the city reserved for green space, but coming from Canada, where we're a lot closer to Mother Nature than in big cities, it's nice to wake up and smell the scent of fresh air, not weed when you walk in the park. In addition looking at greenery is beautiful to the eyes, especially when you're stuck inside all day. \n\nDespite a few of the negatives, I do encourage people to visit San Francisco. It's definitely a beautiful place that everyone should at least try to visit once in their lives!", "author": "Kristy N."}

From the time I was dating to the times with my 2 very young kids.  It was much more fun without kids...no surprise there.  However, when I had just one kid in tow and unlimited public transit card, I took my 4 yr old everywhere just using public transit.  So much fun...if one had the leisure time and can deal with a whiny 4 yr old.\n\nAnyway, SF will always have a special place in my heart.  It is one of our favorite destinations for food and fun times.  But it is getting to the point where those times will be sparse to nonexistent.  A city of youth and riches that is at odd with our current average life of kids and family.  We don't want to drag the kids around a city that is so crowded, so expensive, so teeming with inequality.  There is no joy for the kids when the environment is so millennial and tech centric.  The restaurants don't feel kid friendly.  The city doesn't feel kid friendly.", "author": "Lan C."}

Buildings are getting taller, more buildings are being built, endless constructions, drilling everywhere.\n\nIf you are new to the City, you will learn quick not to say San Francisco or San Fran!  That's usually a tourist slang or for neighboring visitors sayings!  You will not get dock brownie points, or drop for 50, and there is no test at the end of this review because San Francisco, is all about everybody.  It is a city of inclusion, not exclusion.  It does not discriminate, instead, it embraces your individualism, and respects your space and in fact, nurtures your own growth.  That is what the city is all about.\n\nBesides having an awesome culinary experience, fantastic places to go and places to stay, this city is everybody's city.  Just look around you everywhere you turn.  You walk two blocks you're in Chinatown.  Take a left two blocks you're in North Beach.  Or walk a few blocks up the hill and Russian Hill welcomes you. And when you wan to get away from all that hustling and bustling, and all that city traffic and endless red signal lights and stop signs, the Ocean Beach is only a few miles away, to help you calm and sooth your way to rejuvenating your inner strength.\n\nWelcome to San Francisco, and welcome to the \"City!\"\n\nUntil then, Cheers! ~ :p", "author": "Edwin R."}

I came home today and it has taken me quite a bit to get over you. I'm still missing you greatly. Perhaps it's the hundreds of local pockets that make me feel at home. Maybe it's the food. It could be the endless opportunities of fun things to do. Being able to see the city and the thousands of homes on top or below any hill brings out a feeling of warmth and love in my heart. Driving into downtown gives me a little rush of butterflies in my stomach. Even the Facebook video of kids crying in happiness to the gift of receiving a puppy couldn't take me out of a rut of missing what great things you have to offer. Every visit makes me feel even more at home with you.\n\nBeing in the presence of my Yelp colleagues all across the world and building lifelong friendships doesn't help my cause of simply paying a visit to learn great things and coming home to my everyday routine.

It's a suspension killer! I've actually been to poorer countries in Africa with smoother roads! It seems as if though SF is trying to turn new vehicles into 'rattle boxes' and it's also the only city I know of that requires a full size 4 wheel drive SUV in a metropolis of this size, if you want a smooth ride at 25 mph! I think SF has to start spending tax dollars on it's roads as a project ALL taxpayers can benefit from!\n\nAnother major issue is no parking anywhere! There is no chance parking your vehicle anywhere near a shop you'd like to visit...and to make matters worse the city takes existing parking places out to create lanes that now flank trolly car stops, or put 'share ride' only parking spaces! Now that's coming from a city who encourages shopping at sole proprietorships owned by local people. So... how can I shop if I can't park! No parking = no shopping, plain and simple. So I go corporate owned stores in malls that invite me with an abundance of parking, so they may separate me from my cash!", "author": "James D."}

Tony Bennet wasn't the only one.\n\nThere are so many great cities in the U.S. and I love visiting them all.  This is one of my favorite if not my favorite.  California large cities have a California feel to them.  Not Frisco.  It truely has a East Coast feel.  The architecture gives you that feeling.  The tightness and hustle bustle of it adds to that feeling.  However, it has a western attitude, which, of course, is friendly; not the cold shoulder that you get on the east coast.\n\nOn top of that, no other city can compare to it's geography.  The climax is uniquely SF.  Cold mornings and nights.  Hot days with the ability to freeze your butt off if you're not prepared.  I always tell people to always carry a jacket; yet they always come back and tell me that they had to buy one because they didn't take my warning seriously.  Then the hills.  These aren't hills.  They are the steepest terrain you find any where in the middle of the city. Then the views.  Just inside the city is amazing, but surrounding the city is more amazing.  The bay and the ocean gives you an extremely scenic photo opportunity no matter which direction you look.  The city is filled with great stores and great restaurants as well.  There is so much to do here that no matter your length of stay, you will not have enough time to do it.\n\nI suggest you take the BART from either SF or Oakland airports, because they stop at those airports and have many stops inside the city.  Parking is impossible and very very expensive.\n\nI'm not going to mention all the spots you need to go to since many of the Yelpers do a great job in giving you recommendations.\n\nI can't wait to come back.

Are they mad 80% of their earnings go to rent money? \n\nPeople are more dickish in the city compared to Los Angeles, people are ruder on the road and seem to be entitled to honk at everything that slightly irritates them. The homeless people are nuts. I was at a Starbucks and a guy ripped a guys laptop out from in front of him, ran out the door and got away. This place is more harsh than Los Angeles, people don't give a shit about the next person, despite this supposedly being the most liberal place among the United States. Make up your mind San Francisco, you are either for the people, or self serving assholes. Maybe there is two sets of people in San Francisco, the haves and the have nots and the haves are looking at the have nots with a snotty look while the have nots are crapping in the street in broad daylight or mad about the gentrification. \n\nThe sights however, are beautiful, the parks are amazing, especially how well they blend in with the city. You can be in the city in one second and in two blocks it seems like you are miles away from civilization, I love that. \n\nThe costs of regular products can be much higher as well. You can pay 5 dollars for a peach at a grocery store and drive 2 miles to the Asian grocery stores or Foods Co and pay half of what you would in a normal market in Los Angeles. There are a lot of extremes in San Francisco compared to Los Angeles. The ghettos (EastBay) are more ghetto and violent, and the pricier areas are more pricy than Los Angeles. \n\nComparing San Francisco to Los Angeles in terms of square miles is not fair. It is more realistic to compare San Francisco + the Peninsula to Los Angeles. Because you can go from Pasadena to Malibu and be considered to be in Los Angeles the whole time, which is probably 40 or 50 miles apart. San Francisco is something like 7 miles by 7 miles wide, and that is the same as just the East Los Angeles and Downtown, Silver Lake type areas combined, not greater Los Angeles. \n\nThe money is in San Francisco. However, the women are in Los Angeles. More brains in San Francisco, more beauty in Los Angeles. San Francisco works better for me because I am in Finance and Tech, and more focused on my career, I have had my fill of sun and fun with the women in Los Angeles. \n\nI have been in San Francisco for about a month, but visited a handful of times previously. I have lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years. San Francisco is a bigger city type of place, harder to make it, like they say about New York, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. Well, if you can make it in San Francisco, you can make it anywhere else in California. So you can move back to Los Angeles, since you have finally made it because it's just a better standard of life. However, San Francisco is also a great place to be. Some say Los Angeles is the best place in the world, but that's probably because they haven't lived in the other best places in the world. \n\nComparing San Francisco to Los Angeles is like comparing Milk Chocolate to Dark Chocolate. Milk Chocolate tastes better, but Dark Chocolate is more concentrated, will deliver the benefits faster and it's better for you. San Francisco seems like the place to get stuff done. Looks and personality will get you further in Los Angeles, where Skills and productivity will get you further in San Franco than vice versa for each city. There are also more working professionals in San Francisco, and more kids and senior citizens in Los Angeles it seems. \n\nMy god I have never seen so many crazy people and unattractive women in such a short span of time. But I have also never seen such high wages for the same jobs you can get in Los Angeles. Don't get me started on the rent just yet. I don't miss Los Angeles really because I have looked under every rock there, however, I'm not crazy about some of the social changes in San Francisco. \n\nIf you want to blend in, just act annoyed and like you're better than everyone else.", "author": "David S."}

My recent trip to San Francisco definitively proves that I am not, in fact, an indiscriminant city-swooner.  And, I am without a doubt, much more Southern than I think.\n\nWhile the city of San Francisco itself is beautiful, with all the amenities of a large city that my current city lacks, I found most of the inhabitants to be vile, physically obtuse, and not friendly.  In my four day weekend there, my little Southern heart was broken numerous times by pushy people on buses, jerky door guys, nonchalant bartenders, and the rudest cab driver I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.\n\nNever have I ever experienced this phenomena, not in New York, Chicago, LA, or London.  The underlying aggression and/or apathy is so strong, that even someone as outgoing and courteous as myself started to retreat into the similar habits of the locals.  Then when encountering someone who was not a total jerk, I hardly knew how to switch back to my normal self.  What a nightmare.  \n\nIn addition, as a Southerner, I am totally addicted to sunlight.  Luckily on my first day in SF, the sun was out, and it was gorgeous.  And then three full days of overcast later, I want to kill myself.  Maybe that is why the people here are so vile?  But it's overcast all the time in Portland and people are really nice there.\n\nHere is the inclusive list of locals I met that were not total jerk-faces: the staff at Local Edition; Brandon who works at Tanguito; my server at Denny's; Tom who drives for Bauer's Intelligent Transportation; Miguel, my cab driver on the last night there who called me \"meja\" and said \"mucho gusto\" to me as I was exiting his cab; that one nice bartender at E&O Asian Kitchen; the bartender Rye; Mike, one of the captains for Hornblower Cruises & Events; all of the staff and vendors at all the Yelp parties I attended; the local and nearby Yelpers and Yelp staff; the Southwest airlines counter person when I was leaving who was just your average SWA-level of nice who almost made me cry he was so nice.  \n\nSo the city of San Francisco is not for me and that is good to learn.  It's as much of a quest as it is a process of elimination.  I would totally live or visit any of the adjacent towns (girls weekend in Sonoma?!?) but don't foresee ever living or visiting SF proper again.  There goes my short-lived dream of working at Yelp HQ. ;-)", "author": "Melissa A."}

It's a dazzler for sure, but what lies underneath is a bit less attractive. \n\nThe cost of living is more than just what you pay for your amenities & well being. I've seen educated people fall to less than glamorous jobs to scrape a living. I've seen brilliant minds cave under pressure & succumb to rampant drug use. I've met many people of whom are really awesome but are so burden down with work, they have little time to meet others or gain a moment of peace. \n\nUnless you have endless dollars flowing from mommie & daddy as a trust funded douche bag, or are already a lotto winner or independently wealthy, I wouldn't even bother. \n\nIf you are reading this from your rent-controlled apartment you started renting in the 80's, and you feel fairly secure there, I would challenge you to consider the 1000's of people whom lost their home by way of Ellis Act evictions, fire & water damage, or shifty landlords whom only want to make money and not provide a livable standard. It only takes one crack head & a small amount of gasoline and a match to make 50+ people homeless in a city built out of 100 year old red woods that used to be growing on the Marin Headlands. \n\nHaving moved no less than 45 times in the 17 years I've lived here, and some of those places I lived for 3+ years, I expect the best way to live is to just pack one bag, plan on buying your house wears at Ikea, and be ready to give it up in a moments notice. You never know when bed bugs will strike or a neighbor will test your resolve to stay where you are. \n\nAlso, as this is earthquake county, you may want to read the novel:\"1906\" by Dale Delasandro. It's part biography part fiction of the lead up to and through the fires that rocked The City over 100 years ago. Corrupt officials, greed & malice are all you folks have to look forward to should this peninsula look like a lit match stick again. Hey, it's happened 4 times before. What's to stop the fifth time?!\n\nI leave you SF with a resounding beliefs that you were never my City, but a way for me to grow & learn about the difference between wants & needs: I need a cocktail & want it to be less than $12. I need a home & want it to cost 1/5 my monthly income(not 4/5). I need a community & want it to be there for me when I need it.", "author": "Kai N."}

All fantastic and quintessentially San Francisco, but oh there is much much more. \n\nLiving in SF is always full of surprises. \n\nOne day you see a heavily drug induced person screaming at their own reflection in the window, the next you'll see a man standing in the middle of traffic on stilts doing street performances, the next you'll see a car on a flatbed tow with cameras circling around being filmed for a movie, and the next, you see the President and his entourage being ushered by secret services down the very same street. \n\nSome of the most interesting people and events take place here in San Francisco to say the least. Not to mention that Yelp headquarters dwells here! Uhh herro! \n\nWhat is undeniable is that there is so much inspiration to be drawn in its mere 49 square miles. \n\nBreathtaking views and hike trails to explore, influential museums, creative art exhibits, sporting events, Michelin star restaurants and equally passionate Mom and Pop crazed food vendors. The abundance of fresh produce from local farmers and sustainable food is remarkable. \n\nWhat I enjoy about SF is that you come as you are and build on who you want to become. Opportunities are endless here. \n\nOn another note, the cost of living is extremely high, but thankfully with public transit, BART, and Muni bus lines running mostly throughout the day and night, it helps to get you where you need to go if you commute into the city.\n\nHere in SF, there's something for everyone and it makes it easy to cultivate your hobbies, interests, and profession. \n\nI doubt I'll ever get bored here.\n\nOh and one thing that DOES suck is that if you're into wearing stilettos or heels like I am, it's a challenge walking up and down the hills and windy streets of SF.

If you ever get to experience this place, I would stay here for 5-7 days to really get the indepth experience. Got to all the niches like Japantown, Chinatown, Mission area, Little Italy, it will amaze you. If you are looking for fun things to do, you can always go to fisher man's wharf, go to alcatraz, and its like flipping through the pages of a history book.

I came to the Bay Area just a bit too late to make living there practical. \n\nI've done many of the tourist things in the past and more recently, even worked there briefly, and been to more than a few restaurants. It seems to get busier every time I visit (especially now at the peak of tourist season), and I'm no fan of crowds. Perhaps in winter it will be better. I really do like to walk around in the morning in less crowded spots though, and it's nice to contrast the restaurants with the East Bay. \n\nAs for the vegan food, the East Bay seems to have more dedicated spots, but maybe that's just bias. I've been to very few dedicated vegan restaurants in San Francisco. \n\nFinally, for beer, check out Ales Unlimited and Jamber.", "author": "Peter N."}

A place of art, culture, fine food, and interesting people, who live their lives without pretension, a last bastion of utopia. \nI wanted to be a tourist, ride the trolleys, explore Alcatraz, streak in the Castro, go to Napa buy some really delicate pinot noir, get drunk on same, and piss it off in the Fishermans Wharf. I wanted to participate in a \"Sit In,\" scrawl graffiti, and get arrested. I wanted to \"Fight the Power.\" Stand up to the \"Man.\" I wanted to chew gum and blow bubbles at the rest of the world.\nAll of these things are in my soul, they make up my very being.

And I think it was built on more then Rock-N-Roll. \n\nThis is my second favorite city behind Chicago. I was very lucky to consult in the tech sector for almost 20 years and because of this I was treated to way too many trips to San Francisco. \n\nI love all of the different areas of San Francisco.  My favorite area to hang is North Beach.  I love hitting the Italian restaurants. In fact, I'm a regular at Mona Lisa's #4 and the owner has no idea I live in Chicago.  He is always complaining that I do not visit all the time.  I have tried to explain but he's not hearing me. I love that I can walk up when they are packed and he will find me a table. I don't even get treated that well anywhere in Chicago. \n\nSpeaking of being a regular. I even have a local customer card for the lobby bar at the Hotel Adagio. It gives me 20% off of my food and drink. I really do feel comfortable when I come to this town.  I have even gotten to know the manager and we will hang and have a few drinks. I think I might be a honorary local. \n\nSo you can see why I love this city but there are so many more things to talk about. \n\nMy favorite tour is here.  The Alcatraz tour just rocks. I highly recommend you make reservations far in advance because this tour fills up.  The best thing about this tour is that you also get a boat ride out to the rock.  You can enjoy the views of the city on the bay. I love seeing a city from the water because it just looks magical. \n\nThe cable cars are really cool too. It is so much fun to be able to ride on a piece of history. I'm surprised more people do not get hurt jumping on and off these things. If you visit here you must go on a ride. \n\nDon't forget to see the golden gate bridge. It is very magestic to look at and incredible to drive across. The Wharf is also a must to check out. The city is small enough to walk around. In fact, I've done this many times. It's a very walkable city. Just watch out for shady areas near Market Street. There are many homeless and I've encountered some real aggressive ones. It's not fun. \n\nI also love hitting Chinatown for some Sunday dim sum. There is a lot of good food here.  \n\nRecently I discovered Brenda's French Soul Food.  Wow is this place good...if you go here be ready for a wait. It is well worth it. \n\nThe weather here is always perfect.  It's always cool and never hot. The fog can be a pain. I've been diverted from SFO to Oakland several times. It's not fun. I also must point out the American Airlines new terminal at SFO is so amazing. Very green and lots of great space with some amazing restaurants. \n\nI've also attended sporting events here too. I love how they tried to copy Wrigley Field and they were successful. The Giants stadium has gentrified the area.  One of my buddies lives near by and the neighborhood went from bad to good. I would like to point out that Garlic fries are not normal baseball food. I should remove a star but I will look the other way. Also Candlestick is terrible but it's very far from downtown, so I will just ignore it. Or maybe I'm just bitter becauseU I have seen my Bears get spanked by the 49ers in a playoff game here. Bears losses ruin my Monday. \n\nSan Francisco is also the place I met my wife. We met at Kells Irish Pub near North Beach. There was a fight over a cheese stick and the rest is history.  I was a perfect gentleman and I let her have it...the cheese stick I mean! That night was the start of a friendship that would become so much more over time.  Who knew?\n\nSo you can see why San Francisco is my second favorite city behind my hometown of Chicago. I've spent a lot of time here and I've always had an amazing time. There is so much to do.

It's not how I remember. \n\nI want to start by saying I'll give it credit for the usual (views,food, etc) but overall I find it seriously overrated this time around. \n\nThe architecture is bland, beige and boring. Sure there are a few nicer, more recent towers and some single family homes are nice but overall the city itself looks terrible up close. The few interesting structures that dot the landscape sparingly are literally covered in trash. This is the dirtiest city I can remember being to in a long time and I'd say it even gives NYC a run for its money.\n\nI've also found the neighborhoods fairly underwhelming. Everything that isn't a tourist trap or museum is placed fairly far apart. There's no natural flow from one neighborhood to the next, most of the city seems to be at this point, a wasteland devoid of anything interesting. That includes the people. Most seem normal enough but this city has a pandemic of basic bitch syndrome spreading faster than any wildfire I've ever seen on the news. But thank god for them because the alternative is a vapid tech worker poser or the ever present aggressive homeless/drug addicts wandering the streets everywhere. \n\nIdk it's decent enough but I for the life of me don't understand how anyone could justify the rent in this city for what you get. Seems like it relishes its past glory days and the quick influx of Silicon Valley cash has allowed it to lie to itself for much longer than would have been possible otherwise. Give it 3 days 2 nights max otherwise you're gonna start to get bored. Scale of 1 to 10 it's a blah\n\nRevision: okay after the last couple days of my trip things turned around.

I've heard Moscow & Seoul are now 2 of the most expensive cities today.\n\nParking tickets are given out as a policy solution for balancing the city budget.\n\nI loathe the mini cars you see in Europe but practically speaking, that's the only realistic option given the parking situation or a motorcycle.\n\nBicycle theft rings rampage every few months, so you're stuck lugging a $100 lock that weighs as much as a 25 lb dumbbell, going up and down hills if you opt for 2 wheels over 4.\n\nHaving worked in Silicon Valley for years, the one thing I learned at the endless meetings whether at Silicon Graphics, Nortel or HP is how much a scam the software and hardware products really are and yet corporations now government and the public pay big $$$ for them and get the bugs, patches, etc. after the purchase like the auto industry with the air bag or electrical problems.\n\nSan Francisco has become the hub of either the wannabee hipsters or the usual suspects (hippies, leftists, activists, LGBT community and computer related employees who refer to themselves as cubicle slaves) and if you're not within one of these categories, you are not welcome in the rainbow coalition.  Judgemental & prejudiced describe many San Franciscans despite their denials.\n\nThe male to female ratio isn't as bad as Anchorage, AK but a 8 hour drive down to Southern California will show you it's bad enough. The women in the SF bay area are aloof, distant, cold, unsmiling, unfriendly & have very high expectations even when they have little to offer. \n\nThis is a feminist haven and all that implies, so if you're not \"down\" with that, I recommend you avoid it, other than for a day trip or a weekend.\n\nIn short, if you're a straight masculine male expect confrontational, combative and occasionally bat s... crazy women in your life.\n\nPRO tip: In the last 20 years I've learned the hard way it's best to avoid dating white females in San Francisco, for some reason they are the worst people you'll ever encounter with rare exception.\n\n(Spend a weekend in San Diego for a quick comparison to see what I mean - Los Angeles women are way too flakey)\n\nIf you're a gay male, don't feel obligated to go to the Castro, the bay area is so gay friendly that there's plenty of events, bars or places to find other gay men without needing gaydar.\n\nI've discovered this city was more gay than advertised, in the sense that a large proportion of the men are bisexual or have or will be experimenting & a significant amount of the women living in the bay area like or prefer that. So if you're submissive, beta male then this is the place for you not for men like me. \n\n(FYI, this is truly one of the most anti-military cities in America and the only one someone tried to spit on me in uniform)", "author": "Jonah H."}

SF was polarized: we saw lots of tourists in union square, the homeless on market st and the tenderloin, literally **no one** save for an elderly Japanese woman on the street in Japan town, more flocks of tourists in the embarcadero/fishermans wharf area and only the joggers/bikers scrambling to get out of their garage and quickly secure the door in Pacific heights.  Around market street and areas of the tenderloin there is a noticeable smell of urine.  Its not like new york doesn't have homeless people--but there's so many people mixing on the street at one time, it doesn't stand out. Its german tourists mixed with a homeless guy mixed with the nypd mixed with jay-z mixed with an elementary school class on any given corner. (You get the idea.) SF was a little dead to me in the interior and then jam packed with tourists around the waterfront. \nAll that said...I did like it here and would definitely go back. The myths about SF are pretty false. Its pricey to visit? This was one of my least expensive trips ever. The hotel was $65 a night,  Chinatown was dirt cheap, most of my meals were pretty reasonable. The people are snooty?  Not in the least. Random strangers stopped and offered unsolicited directions / help when we looked lost. The hills? Haha, ok, that myth is totally true. Set the treadmill at 'I think I'm going to die' incline level before going. \nI really also liked the walkability of the city, the range of things to do, water on all sides, even the reported \"cold summer\" (I actually thought the temp here was perfect for walking 60 to 70 -- never too hot or too cold.)    \nBottom line: I'm kind of lukewarm on SF but overall think im in the minority-its either a city you'll love or hate.

Its a huge contradiction of amazing culture, a foodie haven, beautiful architecture, interesting people, huge possibilities, and a plethora of sociopolitical problems.\n\nSan Francisco is a beautiful place... from a far. Kind of like a porn star, she looks great in pictures and on film, however, once you get close up you begin to notice she's not so appealing after all. Used and abused, San Francisco has got some real issues. Not to be an asshole, but my biggest qualms begin with the horrendous homeless problem SF has built up in the last decade or so. Its really really bad. \n\nI've told many people this before, but the smell of urine actually reminds me of SF. Even while traveling in India (which is a cesspool of its own) , urine was associated with the city. Gross, right? \n\nI also don't appreciate walking down the street (even in the financial district) and being harangued by the homeless or the down right crazy people. Just last week I was leaving a meeting in the FD and encountered a naked screaming homeless man stumbling down Market St. No one batted an eye and just kept on moving. So sad. With such a liberal city its really fascinating how no one really gives a shit... doesn't make sense to me. \n\nI feel like I could go on for days, but SF is one helluva place. Beautiful and weird, it caters to the uber liberal and people who don't seem to really give a fuck, but claim they want to go out and save the world, blah blah blah. I don't know. Hopefully things will move in a different direction for SF and it'll get cleaned up a bit. Until then you can find me in the 'burbs.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

It used to have an amazing variety of people and culture but all that is gone.  There are 4 types of people remaining in the city.\nTech workers, gays, homeless and tourists. \nThat is all.\nEveryone else has been pushed out by the highest housing prices in the country.   You can get a 1 bedroom apartment in a nice neighborhood for $3000 a month.  Or you can buy it for $3 million.   \nIf you prefer to sleep in a bike locker on the street, you can save some money and rent one of those for $800/mo.\nThere is a uniform for all males in the city which must be worn at all times: \nLoafers or slippers(no socks)/ a purse / shorts which dont reach the knee/ (Entire knee must be visible) / a form fitting t-shirt with ironic message on it / and childrens sunglasses. \nAll of this can be worn with a very large beard or clean shaven.  If clean shaven, hair must be in a pompadour, or combed and slicked very heavily to one side but at an angle toward the back of head.\nPlease dont walk around the city without this outfit on. They will stare at you and make faces.\nAlso, homeless and tourists are exempt from this attire.  \n\nTourists are easy to spot, they are moving slowly and looking up at all times, at the many unique buildings and tourist attractions which line the city. \nEveryone else is moving very briskly and annoyed by the tourists, but welcome the homeless. (who they pushed out of their homes)\n\nThere are no black people in San Francisco. (except in a few neighborhoods which are 100% black and San Francisco whites and aisans would never dream of setting foot in)\nI have never seen a more segregated place.  I dont know if this is careful city planning or an accident.  \n(disclaimer. there was a black gentlemen at fishermans wharf. He was surrounded by 346 toursists. He was painted metallic gold from head to toe and doing creative dance moves while standing on top of a crate.  There was a basket on the ground where tourists were placing one dollar bills. By the end of the day, he will have the amount of money needed to eat lunch)\n\nThe food in the city is fantastic but you cant afford it.  There is a $100 city minimum imposed on a couple wishing to have lunch.  \nParking will be $38, but there will be no space available. \n Eventually you will park 16 blocks away and walk to the chosen eating establishment, which will include walking up and down two steep hills.                                                                  (Cars are heavily discouraged.  Any San Franciscan with any dignity rides a home made wind-powered contraption which they themselves made out of reclaimed scrap metal and can be folded up and placed in ones purse next to ones tablet or very small laptop.\nThis will not only avoid the parking fees and lack of parking, but has zero emissions and is easy to store. )\nWhen you get there the restaurant staff will be extremely busy and no one will greet you.     You will notice there are 4 tables total in the restaurant and none will be available during your visit, but you are welcome to eat your food standing on the sidewalk.  \nThere are frequent gusts of wind, each one containing an array of smells, including but not limited to: urine. seawater. amazing food. despair.\n\nThe total for lunch will be $54 for two.  You will receive a smaller portion of food than you  expected but it will taste so good that you will eat here again soon. \n\nThere will be various surcharges on the bill that you did not order and must pay, including:\nLibrary tax.\nWaiters should be paid more surcharge.\nCity workers early retirement tax.\nProfitable business punishment fee.\nBridge toll.\nAnd several other fees.\nThese charges will insure that your lunch totals the $100 city minimum. \n\nThe many city attractions have lost their luster in recent years as you have seen all of them on tv or online so many times, you are actually disappointed to find that the touched up video and photo versions are actually better than the real thing, and much easier to access. \n \nYou will always have  a love hate relationship with this city.   \nThree stars because the weather, the food and the views are so great, it overshadows the ridiculous people who are running the place into the ground. \nOur last visit was terrible and we cant wait to go back.", "author": "Gianna W."}

The City is in my heart and soul but it truly has been transformed in a very whitewashed manner by the latest wave of techies. When the hippies flooded in during the 60s, and the Beatniks before them, they were mostly white folks too but the difference back then was these folks were driven to contribute to the culture of the City -- the techies simply don't care...their drive is internally focused like the apps. they're so busily creating.\nWhen I was living in the Haight back in the 80s and was active in a local preservation group, many young folks were still arriving to live and experience the city's unique magic--like Peter The Hippy who had recently arrived from Maine because he wanted to meet Grace Slick and settled in a cheap Victorian unit up the street from me where he worked on his art and planned our next demonstration against the latest chain store invasion.\n\nMaybe to ease the heartache I look at massive transformations as being written into the City's DNA from the very beginning with The Gold Rush and the City's sudden transformation back then from a small western outpost to a glorious city modeled after a beautiful European capital. Or..perhaps SF was just too beautiful and perfect a place to live that it would eventually fall victim to it's own success.\n  \nWhatever the case is --it is no longer \"the City\" and I'm glad Herb Caen isn't still around to see what it's become.", "author": "Shaki S."}

It's a very different place than it was when I moved there in '97. Change is inevitable, I get it, but not all changes are good or acceptable simply for the sake of accepting the inevitability of change. By the time I moved away in 2015, SF had become a caricature of itself; the city rests on its laurels, marketing itself with its reputations from bygone eras that are far from the actual present day truth. I'm sure passing through as a tourist is just as fun as it ever was. The area is visually beautiful but the city of San Francisco itself is like a Monet painting- it's gorgeous when viewed from a distance, but when you get up close for a real good look at the details, she's a big 'ol mess. SF has always been expensive, but low and middle earners still had a decent chance at creating a good life not so long ago. Now, wealth gap and housing inequality is so morbidly grotesque that long established communities are hemorrhaging. Profiteering is rampant, corruption in City Hall, etc. Public policies are pandering more and more to the overprivileged all the time. The city is getting whiter and whiter all the time. In the last years before I moved away, I became increasingly embarrassed to have friends and family visit me there. The city got more and more filthy, conspicuously in step with the growing income disparity. There is human feces and other bodily fluids all over the sidewalks, and lots of litter including used hypodermic syringes. Strong smell of urine is common and so are cockroaches and rats out in the open in broad daylight. FILTHY. Not just in the Tenderloin, it's pretty much citywide in varying degrees.

I've lived in New York, I've spent my college days in the desert, I've been to LA,  the mountains of Montana and the great lakes of Michigan....but there is something captivating about SF. This city has something nobody else has; heart, health and happiness.\n\nThe people in San Francisco are friendly and helpful. I guess if you are from LA or NYC and are quite pretentious, you may think we don't have the most attractive people. I disagree- our people are beautiful as they have heart, intelligence and substance. Our people care about this planet and make an effort to conserve her. Our people help lost tourists on the street, as they know tourism supports our local economy. Our innovative people created Twitter and Dropbox, and countless other start-ups. San Franciscans are obsessed with love and sharing it (i.e Love fest, Bay to Breakers, and just about any other festival you partake in).\n\nThe people are what make this city fabulous.\n\nIf your preference is history and sightseeing, that's just fine too. Our landmarks and natural preservation outshine any other city's attempts. Every time I drive over the Golden Gate bridge, I can't help but smile. When I am feeling motivated (which should be more often), I can walk out my front door and climb the Lyon street steps- no gym required. I can sail in the bay. I can hike up to Coit Tower. I can go on a mini-park hunt city wide! Walk through the Presidio and take in the scent of eucalyptus. Leaving work on a sunny day? Jump on the cable car and take that home. Oh wait, it's REALLY sunny today- maybe I'll have fresh oysters for lunch at the Ferry Building...stay for dinner and watch the light show on the Bay Bridge. \n\nOn that note, when it is sunny in the city, us San Franciscans really appreciate its glory. We head straight for one of the dozen grassy parks, pop some champagne, whip out our Jambox and call it a lazy day. When it's foggy, it's really stunning- the fog rolls in quickly over the hills of 280, and the horn near the bridge sings you to sleep at night. \n\nI don't even need to go off about our produce and quality of food out here. I think that's well known and another review in itself.\n\nOverall, I love you San Francisco. Thank you for sharing your wealth and beauty with me, and giving me some of the best years of my life. I love you bay bay.", "author": "Meredith M."}

For me, it wasn't, and thus this rating is reflective of my personal experience here.  It very much embodies the \"great place to visit, wouldn't want to live there\" saying, in my mind: \n\n1) Serfs and (tech) oligarchs. See: stratification, class divide, wealth inequality, limited mobility. \n2) Lacking in racial, social, philosophical or cultural diversity: e.g. a black population less than half the national average. In general, a pompous neo-liberal insularity and intolerance toward diverging views and beliefs while fanning themselves for being \"a live and let live utopia of tolerance and respect.\" \n3) Vastly overpriced. More expensive than Manhattan. \n4) Insane competition for limited resources: apartments, jobs, parking spots, reservations at restaurants, etc.  E.g. when you want to \"get away\", clear your mind and hop across the Golden Gate to hike in Marin, rest assured that thousands of other people do as well, and expect to compete even for a sliver of leisurely escape.  Supply and demand here is totally out of wack. \n5) \"No Pet\" apartment policies  \n6) Rent control means newcomers are subsidizing entitled \"establishment\" San Franciscans. 35 year olds paying $1200 bucks for a room with a shared bathroom, living like they're 19, while people are making a killing on Air BnB with their rent-controlled apartment as an income source. \n7) Greedy (majority foreign) slumlord property owners\n8) Some of the worst traffic in the nation.  I've lived in Seattle, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and the Bay Area traffic is the worst I've experienced. \n9) The contemporary San Franciscan (Generalization): Shallow, decadent, status-obsessed, amoral and materialistic--way worse than what I experienced in Los Angeles. \n10) A culture of elitism, snobbery and false-superiority \n\nBetween careerist A-type yuppies who pretend to be California Cool with their yoga mats, self-aggrandizing hipsters and \"noblesse oblige\" liberals whose idea of human rights activism and liberation is the Pride Parade, it's harder to meet \"real\" people here than anywhere else I've ever lived or traveled to.  \n\nGood luck finding down to earth people who aren't caught up in their latest mobile app, coffee-shop Named After The Street Address or marketing their personal \"brand.\"\n\nThis is a great place to be if: \n\n1) You're a venture capitalist or real estate mogul \n2) You're already established in your career and are here on a promotion \n3) You're from here: e.g. part of the UC-Berkeley or Stanford legacy crowd, or a benefactor of generational wealth (i.e. your parents own property in the city) who can parlay connections into a stable life\n4) You work in tech\n\nNot the city of opportunity for the creative and immigrant classes anymore, unfortunately.  It's a VIP/Gold Members/Elite Status club now. \n\nPS Raised a blue-dog Democrat, I'll never support that party again after living amongst limousine liberals here for five years.", "author": "Vlad G."}

It is also the only world city in the US besides NYC. NYC was a sophisticated city until 911 then we got a new mayor who caters to transplants and not life long New Yorkers  and New York City was humanized (because of 911)  to those who would have never moved here other wise and people moved here and stripped it of it's essence.  NYC has always been a city of immigrants and transplants. What is different now is that these transplants bring their hilly billy ways with them and stripped the city of it's flavor. But San Fransisco is still San Fransisco. It has not gone down hill the way NYC has.\nI have not been to San Fransisco in a while and I have to say read this review of San Fransisco  by Mike V I learned a lot and it is the most useful review of San Fransisco that I read. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UQFE3BT1rsIYrcDvu_XVow\nNYC and San Fransisco used to be very similar and have a lot in common until the \"hipsters\" who are not hip at all  came in and ruined NYC. I did not think it could happen but it did. NYC lost so much of it's flavor and is dying a slow death. For more on that read Jeremiah's vanishing New York. http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/\nUnlike NYC San Fransisco is retaining it's flavor. Though Mike V says gentrification seems to be spoiling SF. SF is my favorite China Town in the country but I have even heard that China Town has changed. And yes I have been to Richmond. It isn't the same it is Hakka as to where the city China Town in SF used to be mostly Cantonese. They do not speak Cantonese for the most part in Richmond because they are not Cantonese but Hakka. http://www.san-francisco-travel-secrets.com/chinatown-san-francisco.html\nAbout San Fransisco's China Town. http://www.cityonahillpress.com/2012/03/14/chinatown-then-and-now/\nIMO San Fransisco has the best restaurants in the US. It has less restaurants than NY but what SF has is better quality than NY. And you know how LA is always compared to NY? That's ridiculous! San Fransisco is better all around than LA!\nThe only 2 down sides to San Fransisco are that it shuts down early (though not as early as LA) and it is cold. I was there one \"summer\" It was 70 degrees. It felt like our 40 degrees! I almost moved there. But I decided I couldn't take the cold and had to turn down the job!\n\n\"The coldest winter I ever saw was the summer I spent in San Francisco.\"\n\nMark Twain\n\nThe ghettos in San Fransisco aren't that bad compared to other areas in the country. It is a visually beautiful city. I know I have several albums of San Fransisco pictures  but can't find them I don't know what I labeled  them. But it is a visually beautiful city.\nThe mindset and ambiance of the city is off beat and quirky which I love. The thing I hate about the fact that NY is changing is it is becoming like any city USA loosing it's true essence. San Fransisco is still quirky. and that is a good thing!\n The San Fransisco mindset is laid back but not lazy, accepting of oddities and oddballs, always appreciating diamonds in the rough, resonates perfectly with some  people who are destined to be lifelong San Franciscans.\nThere are interesting neighborhoods all of which have their own flavor. It is ethnically diverse. San Fransisco is always listed as one of the healthiest cities in the US. http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/healthy.aspx\nhttp://blog.integrativenutrition.com/2012/02/healthy-living-guide-san-francisco/\nI love San Fransisco!", "author": "Pinky And The B."}

There's always a beautiful cafe or small cozy restaurant you'll stumble upon while waltzing through a new neighborhood. It's the mecca of tastes and indulgences, of pleasure and creativity.\n\n2) the homeless population / \"bad areas\". They elicit an insane amount of complaints from natives and tourists - but for better or worse, a city's hidden corridors exist, and we're not just skyscrapers and Barney's stores and Google buses passing panhandlers lying in rags. \n\n3) social norms are meh. You're free to talk to strangers, see nakeds in the Castro, be around various populations (the 71 Haight bus after 11 pm). We have a million festivals celebrating that diversity - from the tamer Cherry Blossom festival of Japantown to the bondage march of Folsom Street. I love assless chaps. Don't you?\n\n4) Landscapes. Where else will you find hills, ocean, forest, and the concrete jungle, all in one place? Golden Gate Park is 1.5 times the size of Central Park. It's amazing to me that you can be so embedded in a green space while in the midst of the city. And all the other beautiful, soul-changing spaces of Marin, Santa Cruz, and Northern CA are a short drive away.\n\nIn the interest of honesty, here are the cons which you will hear natives (or as they're called now, \"transplants\"...) rant about on a consistent basis (myself included):\n\n1) The incoming professional/tech crowd is negatively impacting\n - diversity\n- rent cost\n- nightlife crowds\n- the ability to ever get a reservation anywhere, less than four months in advance\n\n2) The inconsistent weather - if you wear a silk blouse, your lady bits will be broadcasting the cold to every Tom Dick and Harry; if you wear a coat, you'll be too warm; if you wait an hour, the temperature won't even be the same; and, for all my ethnic sisters, that moisture in the air giving me frizz? I could do without it.\n\n3) Cost of living. Aside from rent, we're talking restaurants, drinks, real estate. In all honesty, I don't think this is a huge deal. Find a couple affordable, quality spots you like. Go to the expensive ones on occasion. Rent, and then buy away from the Bay Area. Problem solved.\n\n4) Traffic. I don't think this is a huge one for me during the week, since I take public trans, but - if you're thinking of going to Marin on a sunny Saturday morning, pack a picnic for your car. You'll be there a while. When the sun is out here, there's some kind of hysteria where everyone collectively thinks (in a robot voice) MUST GET OUT. MUST GO SOMEWHERE PRETTY AND GREEN. MUST LEAVE THE CITY. Parking sucks, but I have the most insane fairy parking karma, so I won't mention it.\n\n5) (this is my own) The changing demographic of the Mission. I used to go to the Mission to escape the upscale onslaught of the inner city. Yes, there was still an assload of pretentiousness, but it was at least diverse, wild, fun, chaotic. Little by little, the crowd is becoming blonder, skinnier, and clothed and J. Crew. It's like dating a poet who got a job at a law firm and started starching his collars. I could cry.\n\n6) Me - us - the people who rant about how much it now sucks, taking away from the beauty and magic of what's left, dragging this city down with our \"it used to be so great\" monologues. Cities change, cultures change. Just gotta accept it, bro. For the people who love the boom in industry and tech - this is your town now.

SF is kind of becoming a mecca for business rather than people gathering together and having fun..plus in order to have fun in SF you need money....SAN FRANCISCO IS OVERRATED!!! ITS CERTAINLY NOT WORTH WHAT THEY PRICE IT TO BE...from my perspective they have turned San Francisco's old culture of hippies, smoking weed, having fun, creativity, and catching a thrill etc..and turned it into a dry business environment where everything is centered around money rather than fun..although there is a lot places here in SF..shopping places..food places..etc...most of them require money..not really to much things you can do here without money..if you have no money or drugs its really hard to think of something you can do...", "author": "A E."}

The Bay Area is a complete place! There's everything. The metro system works well with the Bart and Caltrain. There's bridges like the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge. There's hiking and forests in Marin, Peninsula, and East Bay. You can check out Santa Cruz beaches for surfing, you can go to Napa Valley for wineries, you can head to Lake Tahoe for skiing/snowboarding.

DC and LA combined have nothing on SF. I have been ticketed for the silliest things. This all, I assume, cause the city needs money so they extort it from the visitors, or even the residents. I am tired of it, and I will now avoid going to SF. To friends, if you have an event, as much as I would like to join you, it isn't worth the stress of the fines. To give you an idea, I was ticketed for pulling over, when having a coughing fit. I pulled over anywhere from 30-60 seconds, until I could wipe my eyes (cause it wasn't safe to move forward). Keep in mind I saw maybe 1 other car on the road at this time. I was fined $267 USD for \"parking in the bus zone\". After appeal, the magistrate even confessed that the city is \"hard on drivers recently\", took my $267 to hear my argument agreed with me, but told me he had to submit for a review. Then after review, they denied my claim, and then in the same note they inform me that for another $45 they can rehear my case. Just when you think the city wasn't shady enough They want to extort another $45 out of me. \nAfter that I was sent multiple violation notices for $31 for not paying a toll (which they are supposed to send you in the mail) I call in the day i receive the \"violation notices\". I don't mind paying the tolls, just send me what I owe. I feel that they are waiting until the violation date expires before sending me anything to be able to capitalize on the \"violation\". I found another today when i was calling to pay for another \"toll violation\". They have taken the voilation back a couple of times now and have apologized, but its not enough. This time there was a $79 toll violation they couldn't fix cause they already sent it to the DMV. Now i have to send in a letter to dispute. \nI am 100% convinced the city is trying to extort as much as possible out of me, and I am hearing the same from friends/colleagues. I have had enough, and as of right now I will actively avoid going to SF. To my friends that have events there, please don't be surprised if I decline your invitations. I feel I have made every effort to deal with the administrators of your city, and have gotten no where. I now feel that either you let your elected officials know what is going on, or I cannot consent to your cities policies. Keep in mind, I am lucky enough to be able to afford their ridiculous violations. Imagine someone that cannot. Imagine for a bit that, that violation may impede the lively-hood of that persons family or even education. \nPlease keep in mind I am not blaming the meter maids, or officers. They I understand have a job to do. I blame the ones that created this atmosphere. SF residents if you do not take control of this it will be beyond your control eventually. \nWithout this problem you are an absolute 5 stars, but this has gotten out of hand.

They came over from Wales to help my mom, when I was born here.  My grandfather was always a quiet and reserved man. Good natured and quick with the wit, but a man of few words. My mom always says, that the moment he stepped off the plane in San Francisco his face lit up - and remained glowing the whole time. He just couldn't stop laughing.\n\nAs I write this, my fingers keep on stalling, knowing that words can't capture what my heart does every time a cab revs up onto the peak of a large hill, and the cabbie and I both sigh in unison - as we take in the most perfect picture. I wish my eyes could take photographs with each blink. I would paste those city sighs around my wall - until no white showed.\n\nSan Francisco is breathtakingly beautiful in every way.

OK maybe even a little longer but I'm not telling you how much, haha.\n\nI was 16, on my first college spring break.  My friend Peggy talked me into hitchhiking from Boulder to SF.  She said it was the \"Paris of America\" and I absolutely had to see it. No one ever had to twist my arm very hard to get me on an adventure, I was always up for it.\nI realize now that my poor mother must have had many emotional heart attacks, I was such a wild child.\n\nBack in my young years, of course SF was the city where all the flower children wanted to be.  It was the coolest place in America next to Berkeley, haha.  So off I went with Peggy.  \nWould you believe we found our ride all the way to San Francisco by sticking out our thumbs on the outskirts of Boulder?  Haha, an Australian guy named Peter picked us up & drove us the entire distance to the Cali coast.  Looking back, I suspect he was worried for our safety.  So much for our big hitchhiking experience, we had a damn chaperon.......\nHe fed us, too.   \n\nWe ditched Peter upon arrival in SF, and got a room.  The Beresford Hotel was 6 bucks a night.  I even called them a few years ago and told them I had been a guest back in the day.  \n\nI remember me & Peggy exploring the city.  Oh it was so groovy back then.  No crime to speak of, because hippies had nothing much worth stealing.  City Lights Bookstore was one of our stops.  And we loved to wander through open doors on city streets, where there were visible flights of stairs leading up....just to see what was at the top.  We discovered pool halls aplenty, and sometimes places with great music.\n\nI remember running out into the Bay like a dumb tourist, and people telling me it was not for swimming.\n\nI remember my first sight of the Golden Gate Bridge.  And it never has lost its magic in my eyes, it never has stopped leaving me breathless, no matter how many times I see it. It's always as exciting as that first time.\n\nI remember me & Peggy went to a laundromat to dry our hair.  We were dolled-up hippies, kinda high-maintenance like Grace Slick......because we still set our long hair on rollers.  The SF laundromat had big professional dryers, like in a hair salon, where you put a dime in and dried your hair along with your laundry!  I told Peggy this must be even better than Paris, cuz I had never seen anything so cool.\n\nSo.....now that we looked gorgeous, and our bell-bottoms were all clean, there was only one thing to do:  pick up guys.  We found 3 in the Haight.  One for each of us, and a spare.  They were so cute....mine was named Jim.  We took them back to our room to hang out and drink wine.  Wine cost us 50 cents a gallon.  We also had just enough bread (that means money, haha) to buy tuna & peanut butter, which we passed around & ate out of the can/jar.  That's not all we passed around but don't tell my mother.\n\nSo....after a few nights of getting buzzed at the Beresford we piled in Peggy's guy's little car and headed down the coast to see Carmel/Monterrey.  That's where the story takes a turn for the worse.  We were at a beach, body-surfing and having fun all day into evening.....when the tide rolled in.  We had parked on sand, it was dark outside, & now we were stuck.  We let air out of the tires to get free.\nThat resulted in a blowout along a dangerous stretch of highway near Gilroy.  It was a notorious dead man's curve that has since been reconfigured because of all the many wrecks that happened there.\nThe Hillman hit a concrete bridge abutment, rolled down a gully and burned.  We were all thrown free before it went over the edge, but were all seriously injured.  One young man lost his leg.  My leg was crushed.  We all ended up in a Gilroy Hospital. \n\nThe amazing thing was this:  in the car, before the wreck, I had said aloud that we would not make it back to SF that night.  The others asked me why, but I didn't know.  Those words just came from nowhere, and I was surprised when I said them.  I remember it so clearly, all these years later.\nI was in hospital for months in traction.  I got a call one day from a friend back in Chicago, who reminded me of something she had told me almost a year previously. She had told me I would be in a car accident.  I had forgotten she'd said that until she reminded me, after the fact.\nThat, in addition to my own premonition of the wreck, changed me forever.  It was the beginning of my awareness of metaphysics.\n\nFast forward many years.  San Francisco has changed a lot in some ways, & not much at all in many other ways.  \nI'm the one who has changed.  I'm not a wide-eyed kid in search of adventure & a party & a cute guy.  In that order, haha.\nIn my old age, I'm happy with just the adventure.  \nMy son now lives in SF.\nMy mother, back in Chi, still worries.   I think I'll call her.", "author": "Joan S."}

A roost for extreme poverty and insanity, a din of screaming and cursing greets the casual stroller, interrupted only by the Leviathan-scale Muni buses with arcing currents and aching segments.\n\nAn unhelpful, dynastic politburo runs the city; meanwhile its supposedly liberal population demands in referenda that we arrest poor individuals for merely sitting on the street.\n\nGetting around is brutally hard.  It says much that the only reliable way to travel a few miles across town in a specific timeframe is a luxury car service.\n\nLiving here is, in short, an ordeal.  \n\nYet San Francisco shares with New York City that rare element of man-made beauty; it is an ornament upon fertile land.  When the temperature is just-so, the breeze full of freshly baked bread from Tartine, the panting of well-groomed dogs, when one notices that little architectural detail, hears the easy laugh of young, affluent, and sensitive people -- when one realizes there just aren't days like this very often, that tomorrow will be cold and gray -- when the fickle mistress pulls her veil back, if only for that instant, then you'll know why I love San Francisco.\n\nThe poverty does bother me.  I lived near Sixth Street for a few years.  But seeing it so directly has taught me that poverty is intolerable everywhere.  We are too quick to treat the poor on our streets like bugs in a glass jar; but they are people like you and I, often born into and trapped in a bad situation, escapable only with a large, sustained dose of education and human values.\n\nSeeing it has made me loathe the suburban mentality that poverty is worst when it is seen, that neighborhoods must be sectioned off into the desirable \"us\" and the reproachable \"them\"; and I know that is how most of America is.  \n\nThe rest of San Francisco's downsides are merely temporal.  \n\nThe city is not eternal, but it has a timeless quality that other places do not.

I'm proud to have been born and raised in this city, and I don't think I could ever bring myself to live anywhere else, because you have my heart and always will. Your beautiful hills, your fog, your diverse people, your ability to be all things to all people, yet be unconfined to any single category.\n\nPeople who cannot be themselves in their hometown will flock to you, and you welcome them with open arms. In fact, Oscar Wilde said it best in 1882: \"It's an odd thing, but anyone who disappears is said to be seen in San Francisco. It must be a delightful city and possess all the attractions of the next world.\"\n\nIt's hard to describe the \"feeling\" of San Francisco, but you know it when you feel it. Anyone who doesn't love you is either completely mad, or is unable to see beyond the rawness that comprises your beauty.\n\nWhat can I say, San Francisco? You are my first love.

Commitment, loyalty and beauty.  \n\nI recently went to Chi-town over the summer and although I thoroughly enjoyed getting caught in the thunderstorm, I didn't much like ruining my satin ballet flats or waiting out in Walgreens until I just grew impatient.  After all, I had  a plane to catch.\n\nI love New York, too.  Don't get me wrong.  I'd probably live in NY if San Francisco drops off into the Pacific Ocean.  But, those humid nights in NY are just so uncomfortable.  We get heat waves here in SF but, that off shore breeze helps cool us all down.  I gotta admit, though, the subways in NY are crackin' and their plethora of street wear in SOHO makes my panties wet.\n\nI've even been to Paris, Rome, London, Istanbul.. but, truthfully, they just don't have shit on San Francisco. \n\nI love everything San Francisco has to offer but, I'm most thankful for the multicultural elements that have been infused into the food, theater, art and music.  \n\nI love the roller skaters in Golden Gate Park on Sunday afternoons.  \nI love brunch at Zazie on any day of the week.\nI love watching \"A Christmas Carol\" every year at the ACT theatre.\nI love the Tea Garden, even though I've been there before.\nI love Prince v.

Pier 2 behind Gabbiano's crabbing and drinking as minors getting rolled up by SFPD and being asked to leave for ringing the bell where people parked their boats.  Watching my friends pick up a lady of the night then realizing she was a he! LMAO you know who you two are and what he did to you both!  So much dirt which cannot be disclosed but just a fond memory.  Mercy High School visits with the fellas my lip is zipped.  Burritos by Safeway on Mission Street which I swore were good but went there sober as an adult and wow they sucked!  Pier 39 wow so many memories there. Glden Gate Park, Sutro Baths, Cat's Eye by Ocean Beach, Baker Beach, China Beach, Crissy Field.  Golden Gate Bridge, Hawk Hill, Kirby Cove, Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, Broadway Tunnel, TransAmerica Pyramid, Fisherman's Wharf, Bon Fires on the beach, New Year's events, 4th of July's overlooking the bridges and city from afar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-16", "description": "Well, of course I'm going to dedicate #100 to my City by the Bay.  I guess this'll be my way of romancing the city, much like Herb Caen did. \n\nI was born and raised in the City.  To me, there is something very important about place, and how it affects who you are.  And San Francisco, with her neighborhoods, her always-interesting people and foods, her constant surprises, has been central in encouraging me to always see the world with fresh and happy eyes.\n\nI know her past intimately well, because I attended an assortment of her public and parochial schools, because I spent my younger formative years here.  For a kid growing up here, this City is loaded with colorful stimuli.  Nobody ever told me that my MUNI trips every day as a kid, getting lost in a fish market in Chinatown, or first learning about homosexuality at age six would shape who I am today, but hey, I guess it did.  Kids don't forget.  So, thanks, SF.\n\nI walk around this city a lot these days.  You probably already know it's a fantastic place to walk, this condensed 7x7 grid.  And when I walk, I recall her/my past.  It's these quiet moments, the ones you have in secret with yourself, that make me further appreciate this special relationship I have with this City.  \n\nAs I walk past Sephora on Powell, I remember how it used to be a McDonald's back in the day, and how I threw up a Filet O' Fish on a homeless man right by there when I was five.  It wasn't my fault; he pulled my hair.  I'm one of the few people who doesn't enjoy the new eco-friendly Academy of Sciences, in large part because I have perfect memories of the old place, which was truly an old-school natural history museum.  It's where I learned about science, something I still love and approach with childlike curiosity.  When I walk past Skechers on Powell, I always have a moment of sadness, tinged with anger and nostalgia, because my mom used to own her own little jewelry shop right in that location before the corporate gods swept in.  \n\nIn just those few moments, I have a personalized history of some of the City's most heated political issues - homelessness, greening, gentrification.  It doesn't get anymore personal than getting your hair pulled as a 5-year-old, or watching your mom retire early because of things we couldn't control.  That's life in the City.  Just gotta deal.\n\nAnd then there's this new City that I'm getting to know as a young adult - and it's exciting and never fails to surprise me.  The San Francisco that I knew from ages 0-18 is drastically different from the San Francisco that I know now.  Always something new to learn, even in just 47 square miles.  I stuck to the Richmond, the Sunset as a kid; that was my hood, and I was well-acquainted with the fog.  \n\nBut now?  Mission burritos.  SF nights and late night adventures.  Happy hours downtown.  Bi-Rite and all those organic things.  I'm all over that now.  Maybe I'm even part of the problem, the 20-somethings who spend weekends sunning themselves in Dolores Park while eating a burrito, talking about music and art, and complaining about the hipsters.  Very mockable, but who knows, maybe I'm that person sometimes too.  Whatever.  I can be critical at the same time (thank you, college) that I'm enjoying that burrito in the park.  We're all a lot of things all at once.  San Franciscans - a versatile bunch. \n\nI like all that now, but you never forget your roots, the days spent in the high school hallways with 2500 other San Francisco natives, talking about where we wanted to go to college, what we got on that test, how much Ms. Fuller sucks.  That's also San Francisco; it's not the one that people write Yelp reviews or romantic essays about but it's the one that I know too.  Lowell, Wash, Roosevelt, Presidio.  It ain't hip like the Mission or the Castro, but yeah, that's my San Francisco too - the tricky education system, the local issues (potholes, anyone?), the youth and the seniors.  It's all real and here and important.\n\nSo, I love this City.  She is the backdrop of my past, present, and hopefully future.  And really, it's not just the big events that are important to me, but the moments that catch you off guard - like the saxophone man who plays randomly on downtown streets during the holidays, or when you're walking at night and look up and suddenly you're greeted by a full view of the city skyline, or when a random eatery poofs like magic in front of you, lures you in, and satisfies you once again with a fantastic eat.  You can't prepare for these things, and San Francisco sure does surprise me quite a lot.  Every day, in fact.\n\nI told a friend once that I owe a lot to San Francisco because I truly believe that this City has made it easier for me to always be adventurous, to always be excited by the world, to always be in love with everyone and everything.  \n\nSo, cheers to you, San Francisco.  I will continue to always enjoy my time with you, and I look forward to growing up and old with you.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Drive from Fort Mason to the Main Library (using Hyde Street - it's a short drive) and you will see the drastic socioeconomic differences. \n\nTheir bus system (aka MUNI) makes absolutely no sense and I am fortunate I do not have to use it - and that when I have for the most part I have been with someone who knows it. Makes no sense at all, and thanks but I'd rather not die by being on it or hit by one. Bicyclists are rude as hell, to people in cars and those who are walking and have the right of way to walk.\n\nAnd the weather sucks.\n\n*ADDED* Not only do they suck, but since they are losing the 49ers to Santa Clara they want to hijack the Golden State Warriors from Oakland? You see the sense of entitlement and thievery the city of SF has? NO ONE will be coming all this way from Livermore, SJ and beyond to hit traffic with horrible people or packed bart trains! And when games end after ten, no one will stay to eat expensive food - they will be rushing to BART to catch one of only two trains back to the East Bay since after 7 there are ONLY TWO TRAINS OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE CITY (the Richmond train and Dublin/Pleasanton train). Then they will have to get off at one station to catch THEIR ACTUAL TRAIN. Ugh this makes me so angry. The coliseum is so convenient for everyone, and there is no convenience in SF since you will have to walk or take a bus from BART to the arena if you choose to come to a game via BART. I cannot even think about how driving will be. No way in Haides am I ever coming to a game in SF.\n\nFrom two stars to one.", "author": "Nzugu K."}

There is so much to see and do at practically any time of day within the 7x7.  Restaurants are EVERYWHERE; so much so that I end up spending triple the amount of time I used to deciding on a place to eat, or even just to grab a cup of coffee. \n\nObviously, some neighborhoods are cleaner and nicer than others, but in SF, that doesn't necessarily make them 'better', which I like.  People are, for the most part, pretty friendly and laid back.  The architecture is amazing, and parks are easily accessible.

I had no idea that San Francisco is actively cleansing the city of families by offering far fewer spaces in public schools that are needed, the unlucky families are told to pack up and leave. Unless you can drive your child to a school, which is over an hour away for most, called the Visitation Valley School, in a high crime area. \n\nAptos Middle School had over 90 kids waiting to get into Grade 6 this past September. This is especially shocking given that these kids could only chose to be on one wait list, for only one school. Families are forced to take theri chances, even though they would take ANY school placement at all in their area. Other schools had similar numbers and these numbers did not change at the end of the placement period. Don't believe SFUSD that you will get a place during the various selection rounds or wait pools later on. They will tell you that \"eventually\" you will get into a particular school, they are delusional. No one I know succeeded. \nThere is a reason why San Francisco has the lowest number of children per capita out of the entire USA. Families with children are forced to leave their homes and move. This should be illegal. At the school that my daughter was placed into, she was daily harassed and assaulted, but I was told that unless it is serious enough that the police are involved, the SFUSD will do nothing. We never received any of the requested mid-year transfer, there is no point trying. I knew that there was a space or two available, but I was I told that these are kept by SFUSD \"at their disposal\" - you make your own conclusions. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/san-francisco-unified-school-district-san-francisco?hrid=fJJkyWiKm5IgzzmH9DGdaQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Nk1TaFlXE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT39ch-PnK4&feature=youtu.be\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynQf03pCRF4&feature=youtu.be\nhttp://blog.sfgate.com/reyeschow/2011/10/21/three-reasons-san-francisco-public-schools-may-not-be-for-you/\n\nParents Turn to Homeschool Co-ops after Getting Shut Out of SFUSD School Lottery:\nhttp://www.theschoolboards.com/showthread.php/1770-Parents-Turn-to-Homeschool-Co-ops-after-Getting-Shut-Out-of-SFUSD-School-Lottery", "author": "J B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-30", "description": "I have a serious love-hate relationship with this city. I love it due to the shops, the experiences, the many restaurants and neighborhoods to visit. I hate it due to the people, plain and simple.\n\nFirst, what I loved. Chinatown was a blast, and exploring the city was also pretty fun to do for someone who hasn't been to SF since he was a little kid. I definitely enjoyed visiting the Westfeld Shopping Center, as I have never experienced a mall that big before, and the fact that many of the stores had multiple levels was just funny to me. Finding the right stores meant spending a while just shelf-shopping, and I left some stores with great purchases satisfied about my find.\n\nBut it was all overruled by the people, who just completely ruined my sense of the city for me. They were rude, self-entitled, smug, and irritating, a giant combination that led me to really despise everyone. I have never really been in a city where it was okay to shove into people without apologizing; it just struck me as odd that people were alright with not having any sense of manners. It was always a shock to me when I'd actually hear someone say thank you or excuse me, just because I was used to these things being expected back home. \n\nThe homeless problem is definitely a damper on this city, as it seems I was being harassed by homeless people everywhere I went. Some of them were nice when I would turn down giving them change, but others were just hostile and obnoxious about my decision not to. Being bothered in a Walgreens by a woman who was either schizophrenic or high was definitely the straw that broke the camel's back, and I developed a habit of ignoring them for the rest of my trip.\n\nIn addition, the city is just plain dirty. The backs of buses were covered with graffiti and the streets were always littered with trash. I think the saddest part came when I almost stepped on some smeared poop on a sidewalk and I had to question whether it was animal poop or human poop. As I had seen a man flat out urinating near a busy street corner, I do not put it past this city to have human waste on the streets. Indeed I always avoided puddles of liquid because I was never sure whether it was urine or not.\n\nAnd the pot smoke! Oh my lord it got severely irritating to deal with that almost wherever I went. I come from Oregon, where people are a little more lax towards marijuana use anyway, but this was just ridiculous. I could smell it nearly everywhere I went, and it was just frustrating after a while.\n\nAll in all, I really wanted to enjoy SF; I had memories of visiting when I was a little kid and was eager to be back once more. Instead I was just disappointed with my overall experience, as the general attitude of the city really rubbed off onto me and weighed me down. Although I did have some good experiences within the city, overall it definitely ruined the idea that I held regarding it and I am not planning to come back at any time in the near future.", "author": "Frank D."}

The weather is always unpredictable but I love it anyways. Today I drove to downtown to meet my sister after work. As I walked toward banana republic, I couldn't help feeling a brisk of contentment and happiness. It's rare to have such a beautiful day, where the sun is shining above us and just a slight of breeze of wind passing through. I smiled as I walked and I overheard a rather fat man singing opera loudly and many people were watching him sing. It was a prefect setting; clear skies, people walking, and music in the background, it was almost therapeutic. I smiled happily because I was enjoying my day. Many people think San Francisco is a rather boring place to live, but its not. There are many things to do and so much yet to explore. We never take the time to stand in the middle of the sidewalk and take a deep breath and realized we live in a perfect metropolitan place. I am grateful  to live in an area where I can go anywhere with the convenient of the bus and car. also, when I am down I can take a long walk down to the beach where I can have the dew of fresh fog is felt more strongly on my cheeks.\n\nTime and again, I find the view just over the cliff house, blanketed in an ethereal, gray vapor absolutely breathtaking. It's a great place to ponder life, love and whatever else is on my mind. One can't help but feel inspired. Days like these I cant help but end the day with a bowl of french vanilla icecream from cold stone bewery with my sister. \n\nI love San Francisco.", "author": "Carol Y."}

It was a love that continued to gnaw away at me and that finally convinced me to leave behind my happy, suburban Minnesota life and move in with you.\n\nSince then, my love for you has been severely tested.  I sold almost all of my worldly possessions.  Had to choose which pet I loved best (but then you killed said pet).  Said goodbye to my friends and family.  Nearly tripled my housing expenses.\n\nAt first, those sacrifices were OK.  You gave me regular doses of fabulous restaurants.  Delighted me with wonderful weather.  Gave me a job I loved.  Introduced me to new foods via the farmers' markets.  Regularly presented me with new experiences.\n\nLately, you've asked for more sacrifices.  I rarely see my sweetie during normal waking hours because you won't settle a lawsuit with his client.  I can now identify the difference between human poo on the sidewalk and dog poo (please tell me, who should have this skill??).  There are empty storefronts in my neighborhood because the board of supervisors won't allow a paint store to occupy a former paint store location.  There are used condoms and used needles discarded on the sidewalk, not to mention the discarded mattresses, couches, TVs, and baby equipment.  Homeless people sleep on my stoop, and every time I walk past one turning a blind eye a piece of my humanity dies.\n\nSan Francisco, I don't think you're committed to our relationship.  If you were, would you really keep trying to make me so unhappy?  If you loved me, would you really keep taking away things that are important to me?  Why is my soul and my happiness the cost of our love?\n\nA year ago, I would have given you five stars.  Six months ago, probably four stars (one star reduction for figuring out that I could differentiate between human poo and dog poo).  I still love you and probably always will, but this year you've really become an abusive partner - the kind that Dear Abby warns readers about.

Feel damn lucky you're reading from my journal, not because it's well written (it's horrible) but because I never show it to anyone.  Why am I embarrassing myself publicly like this?  Well, my milestone reviews have been following too neat a pattern, and what better way is there to destroy yourself emotionally and kick-start (or trash-heap) your writing than to put it out there in public before you've had a chance to really work at it?\n\nTwo things you should know:  First, pay attention to the blanks.  Those are the names of women, names I'm omitting for (hopefully) obvious reasons.  It's pretty funny how girl crazy I always used to be, even though most people who know me well don't know that.  Second, I wrote this after I had moved to the city but before I found an apartment.  It's actually the first entry I wrote after coming here, and I may have even written it at Simple Pleasures.  OK, that's enough of a buildup for the pure crap that will follow.\n\nJune 23, 2003\n1:52 p.m.\n\nWow, it's been a while.  I don't know how long, don't want to write in here anymore, but I will because I need to keep my sanity and to stop it, man.\n\nI'm still in love with ____, or at least, in love again.  We went to [restaurant name omitted because it would be identifiable to ____] and to the park, and she is acting like she used to with me.  It's like when we were in public while we were dating:  She thinks I'm funny and wants to do stupid stuff.  I would take her back or at least date her again in a second.  It's good she's way down in [city omitted because it would be identifiable to ____].  Oh yeah, did I tell you--who?--that I'm in San Francisco now?  Here to do another useless master's program.  This time, it's at USF.  ____ destroyed all hope I had in being completely able to move on, and I'm really happy about it.  I'm crazy whipped.\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing one of the apartments (rooms, really) for rent.  I am afraid it will be gone before I do, though, so I'm preparing myself for the inevitable letdown.  It's a place with five other people, and they're all around my age.  That's what I need right now--time with people out of college for a while.  I'm mostly interested in the girls, not for dating reasons but for a redo of the whole _____^ [a different woman] thing.  Maybe _____^ prevented me from writing.  Look at the pattern.  I'm trying to line things up so there's always something to do.  That way, I can't think about how bad things are.  That's why I am actually going to do the _____ ____* [yet another woman] thing.  It will be awkward but fun.\n\nYes, this is me writing in the present again.  (I told you it was bad.)  It's 2011, and I still don't know what I'm doing.  But what better place to be lost and confused and sometimes just on the verge of losing it than San Francisco?  It's not about the drugs or the partially familiar anonymity or the cloying emotional unavailability of so many people here, but it is about the fog and the Bay and the restaurants and the streets and the buses, especially the buses.  It's about political movements that hang around much longer than the young people who put so much effort into them, only to move on in two years or three and settle in to the suburban normalcy they seemed to work so hard to avoid.  But you know what?  Many of them are happy, and they're hardworking, so who am I to question their motives?\n\nI'm comfortable and even content sometimes.  I'm also unhappy, but the source of my unhappiness has nothing to do with this beautiful beautiful city, and I'm long past the age of rash decisions, or at least dramatic ones.  I used to think the city was overly dramatic, but at about the age of twenty-nine, I realized that I was the one who was overly dramatic.  The city is even-keeled, a lot more mature than it seems.  I'm not talking about the people who live here.  They're all drama queens, every last one of them.  The ones you see on the street who aren't drama queens?  Most of them don't live in the city.  They moved away a long time ago, and they have what they believe is the best of both worlds.  But the concrete and asphalt, the trees that somehow soldier on even though people cut them down because they \"ruin\" the sidewalks, the signs and public art, the amazing array of animals that actually live right here in the city, the parks and unwelcoming benches, they are San Francisco.\n\nYou can only miss what you remember, so missing the places and friendships I've lost in this city is actually comforting, immensely so.  I'm not being facetious.  The only thing I absolutely hate about the city are the hipsters, but their ubiquity is more than made up for by the proximate availability of good burritos.\n\nThank you, St. Francis.  Your namesake city probably wouldn't understand you, but they would accept you all the same.", "author": "John S."}

After three years of living within your borders, I know there's a lot to like about you. \n\nI love your ethnic food!  Burritos!  Chinese food!  Dim sum!  Sushi!  Yum.  Thank you!  When I first moved here, I knew I liked Chinese and Mexican the most, and this has since remained the best part of our relationship.\n\nI love your weather.  At times I miss spring and summer, but that's not so bad. My twisted mind would love to see snow in such a hilly city just for the wanton destruction, but the absence of winter is great.  Especially when I compare it to that scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and/or I venture east for the holidays.\n\nI love your tolerance of, and at times advocacy for, things that fall outside the mainstream of America.  It's a funny play on the agricultural exports of California, but it's pretty awesome one can call their adopted hometown \"the land of fruits and nuts\" and use it either as a compliment or a slur.  Moreover, that it's even a debate if a city should have public sex tents is amazing.\n\nI love that the Audio Engineering Society alternates between SF and NYC for its convention.  In a world that almost has an antagonism towards good sound, it's fantastic to see an entire neighborhood bathed in AES banners every other October.\n\nI love that people actually show up to see a local band rock a bar.  It's such a nice change from cities where bands play for \"the other bands and their girlfriends.\"  Moreover, I love Amoeba Records.  Hopefully that doesn't need an explanation.\n\nI love how compact you are.  I think it's a sick joke that an entire geographic region shoves all of its culture and nightlife into a 7x7 city, and then, all of that is concentrated in about a third of that area.  This is actually a very real problem with your suburbs concept of city planning, but this is totally to your advantage.\n\nI want to love you, San Francisco, but you keep doing things that boggle the mind. I'm a weirdo in this town in that I didn't move just so I could live with you.  I followed the traditional American value of going where the job was.  Maybe that's it.  But I still can't wrap my head around a few things.\n\nFirst, the stereotype of San Francisco is that it's filled with \"progressives\" and gays.  Why, then, are you so opposed to building new skyscrapers?  They're the most technologically progressive (and arguably environmentally friendly) way of building possible.  Moreover, they're large phalluses visible for miles and miles!  Do you really want me to believe Ayn Rand in that skyscrapers are a proxy for man's achievement and that your resentment of them is your disdain for life?  I know most of your residents would think that's wacky, but you're not stopping me from at least partially supporting that view.\n\nSecond, getting back to that food thing, you need to improve your understanding of Americana.  Embrace the grease!  I can't find a decent greasy spoon (or that many 24-hour joints) anywhere in you.  Here's a hint: biscuits and gravy shouldn't be sweet.  There's a very real chance for you, San Francisco.  I can get a better cheesesteak here than I ever could in DC, which makes no sense geographically.  Care to try a little harder?  And, no, I don't mean making things more upscale.\n\nSpeaking of upscale, San Francisco, where is your middle class?  You're a third world country! \n\nWhich reminds me, do something about your homeless situation.  If a city that's three times your size and four times dirtier, Philadelphia, can adequately deal with its homeless, so can you.\n\nSpeaking of dealing with real civic problems, your city government is a joke.  It's nice theater and good for entertainment value.  It'd be funny, but life is for real, and the government shouldn't be like this on this side of the television.  With all your very real problems, what do your supervisors spend their time doing?  Banning plastic bags, cat declawing, and trying to ban artificial light.  This is completely irresponsible.\n\nSpeaking of trying to ban light, you need to embrace energy a little more. Party beyond 1 AM!  Put down that wine glass and take a shot of whiskey!  Drive a fast car!  Turn off that jazz and listen to a loud rock band!  Something!\n\nFinally, is there anyone in your borders with a concept of self-reliance?  I can't tell you how many times I've been stopped near Duboce and Castro at 7 PM while carrying several full grocery bags and a clearly visible earbuds cord--by both tourists and locals.  You don't stop someone so obviously pre-occupied on their way home from work just to ask directions on a major street!\n\nWhat all this amounts to, San Francisco, is that you're feminine without being girly.  There's something to be said for that, but life is about balance.  I like you San Francisco, but sometimes I think you're like the long-term girlfriend it never quite works out with.  We'll see.  You know I'll still be trying.  You?", "author": "Jim S."}

I never knew much about this city beyond the time I came up here solo on a Greyhound bus (definitely don't ever do that) during Spring Break in college. I went straight to Haight and Ashbury because that was the only place I had ever really heard of and thought all there was to SF was patchouli, dream catchers and punk asses with safety pins in their clothes.\n\nWhen I would hear songs like Journey's \"When The Lights Go Down In The City\" or Tony Bennett crooning, \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco,\" I would just roll my eyes and chant Randy Newman's \"I Love LA!\" We love it, ya know!\n\nBut then I got the best job I've ever had working for Yelp and after laying the foundation for LA Yelp, I was asked to move up to SF to take on a bigger role. San Francisco? Really. The patchouli place? Hmmm. But after careful consideration in the form of numerous strong cocktails, I decided to go for it. I decided to leave my homeland of LA and brave this new world up North.\n\nAnd so I packed up my goods, cried my going away tears and moved up here to discover my next chapter and it reads a little something like this...\n\nMuch like the Jefferson's, I found a deluxe apartment in the sky and decorated it exactly how I wanted with the help of my good friends Michael and Audrey. I learned how to take the MUNI and have my public transportation sea legs. I still won't ride a bus (unless forced) and I never thought I would voluntarily walk places instead of just hopping a cab. I've spent afternoons lying in Dolores Park lazily watching cloud animals form and I've discovered the art of a true mixologist's cocktail. I don't get cold and shake like a newbie in nature anymore and I love the fact that I never have to blow dry my hair because the wind will do it for me. I've made out with cute boys and made cool new friends and I never seem to get sick of strolling the neighborhoods and taking in the architecture or the people.  \n\nThe reality is, I never, ever, thought it was possible to love a city as much as I love LA, but I do.

My iPod conveniently broke down before I left, so I had to abandon it. It was better this way, as I was forced to listen to the sounds of the city. \n\nI walked a few miles north to Fort Mason. It was starting to get dark, and thus city lights began to illuminate. One can see the numerous hills and towers of San Francisco from here. Further inside, a woman played with her dog in an open field. The sound of cars grew distant and foreign. The fresh breeze reminded me of home. It tastes different here. It tastes better.\n\nI walked through the Aquatic Park, and was blessed by the thunderous crash of waves against the shore. From a great distance I could see the lights of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge glowing with majestic brilliance. A giant barge creeped across the water as if it made no sound. \n\nI walked to Fishermans' Wharf and Pier 39. It started to rain harder. The tourists had their umbrellas open, but I didn't have one. Their only concern, however, was on what to eat for dinner. The simplest things are often the most meaningful and enjoyable. It doesn't even matter if the food is terrible and expensive. \n\nI walked to the Cable Car stop and boarded one back home. The conductor gracefully helped a woman on and off the car, while holding back traffic so she could disembark safely. There was another woman inside who didn't lack the shame of singing in public. Her voice warbled like a singer from the 1940s. I closed my eyes and took in the faint whisper of her floating tune.\n\nLike fitting the final puzzle piece, it just feels good.", "author": "Keane L."}

As I pondered where I would live as a grownup, I narrowed it to one of three places:  Hong Kong, Honolulu, or San Francisco.  All vibrant, English-speaking, 24-hour centers of civilization.  During the Summer of Love I was in Kansas, and I didn't actually immigrate to the City until 1979.  \n\nIt was San Francisco State University that brought me here (go Gators!).  Eight years and many earthquake rides later, I earned my bachelors degree.  I turned down a job offer in Torrance so I could earn my masters at the University of San Francisco (go Dons!).  \n\nWhile I was in school I lived in Ingleside, the Inner Richmond, Stonestown, and Merced Manor.  \n\nIn 1992 I took an excursion to Silicon Valley, and benefitted from the best professional training in the world (go Banana Slugs!).  Ultimately, I returned to the City in 1999, and I haven't left since.  \n\nThis time around, I've lived on the Embarcadero (one of the City's oldest neighborhoods) and in NOPA (a newly-named 130-year-old neighborhood).  \n\nWhat draws me to San Francisco, over and over again?  \n\nFirst, and most obvious, is the mild climate.  I forget there are seasons here.  Winter is only a news story or a ski trip opportunity.  Summer is a three-week heat wave in January.  It's 55 degrees all the time.  \n\nSecond, and also obvious, is the night club and restaurant scene.  We have more first-class restaurants standing shoulder to shoulder on one commercial street than whole towns have down in the Valley.  No matter what your age group or interest, you can go out and find similar people ready to party with you.  It's a 24-hour city.  I almost forgot, until Yelp! reviews reminded me that it's still true.  \n\nThird, the parkland is amazing!  I love the Presidio, Golden Gate Park, the beach, and all the hills and parks that dot the landscape.  We have great museums, lots of movie theaters, skating, bowling, bike trails, sailing, you name it.  When I took a helicopter tour, I rediscovered the vastness of this little 49-square-mile postage stamp of a City.  Yes, it's so small you can walk across it in a day when you are up for it, but it's also large enough to get lost in.  \n\nFourth, then, is the diversity of the neighborhoods.  They are always evolving.  Last year's information is obsolete.  3rd Street is no longer the place to avoid at all costs.  Yuppies (but we don't call them that anymore) are living on the T Line, where only gangsters and derelicts used to be.  The Marina is a rich playground, but it has always accommodated me.  The Mission, with its Miracle Mile, is a haven for Latin culture.  Downtown is becoming more residential, too.  Have you seen the condos going in on New Montgomery?  \n\nIt's provincial and it's cosmopolitan at the same time.  If I have to cross a bridge to get to work, that's too far.  If I have to dash over to Honolulu for some business, it's not a problem.  You can get anything here, if you know where to look.  Come on, I know where to get Branston Pickle!  \n\nI used to rent, but now I own a piece of San Francisco.  It's not impossible, and it has actually turned out to be fun!  I have always, always had off-street parking.  The pay for serious professionals is also pretty good.  So I'm very happy with this city.  I think I'll keep it!", "author": "David D."}

I can't say enough about this town.  It's one of the few real cities left in the U.S.  There is always something going on, whether it's a street fair, the Blue Angels are in town, or there's just something new to check out.  Where else can you find what appears to be 100 neighborhoods in a 7x7 mile area?  Where else can you find people so passionate about where, precisely, they live?  Great restaurants?  Friendly people?  Public transit?  You won't find a city anywhere in the States that brings all this to the table.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- there are downsides.  The weather, the parking, Chris Daly, the homeless problem, etc.  The people can be awfully selfish (if I hear another person describe himself as \"socially liberal but fiscally conservative\"....).  The crime, which is shifting from petty to violent.  But it's a small price to pay to live in what really is one of the finest cities in the world.

About when we got to Sacramento we realized we'd be hitting SF at rush hour, so we took the detour to Napa, drank some wine, then went straight (pun intended) to the coast to drive down to the city in the moonlight.  I am telling you - being in the cliff-side lane of Highway 1 on a dark night is not as fun as you'd think.  But I stopped at a turn out and got out of the car, on that warm July night (hard to believe, huh?) and looked at the moon shining down on the Pacific and I was pretty sure I was making the right move.  When we came down the incline and the Golden Gate Bridge and all the city lights came into view, I had no doubt.\n\nIn the years since, I've forsaken the City a couple of times.  I lived in Oakland for a year.  I lived in Berkeley for six months.

Just thinking about the fresh, cold air, gorgeous bay views, the impending fog, delicious restaurants, metropolitan city vibe, sea gulls squawking, the beautiful presidio and picturesque Golden Gate Bridge. What can I say, this is my hometown.  I was riding the cable cars for as long as I can remember. As a junior high school student, all the students would scramble for the outside standing areas, where we would all hang on to the poles laughing, and slapping our friends passing in the other direction as the cables pulled the trolley up and down the hills and rounded the corners. People walk a lot and also take the muni buses or cab it.  There are lots of one way streets, that you travel on again and again.  It's cold, people would always ask, aren't you cold?  And I really wasn't, the nip in the wind wakes me up and has me feeling all energetic.  This city was a great place to grow up, it's small enough so you always were in a familiar place. In San Fran, you always bump into someone that familiar, be it from years ago or from the club you went to last week.    \n\nIn the inner alleys of Union Square or Nob Hill, there are terrific gems of restaurants, salons and shops hidden away from the main streets.   A euro-seattle mixed vibe that is somewhat intimate and closed.  You have to be in the know and connected to get access to the exclusive clubs or cocktail parties. The locals are not into celebrities here, it's more about the local players, politicians, restaurateurs, and old money names.  Herb Caen, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist wrote for the two SF newspapers - Chronicle and Examiner.  Jack Kerouac, a writer who started a literary technique known for its stream of consciousness, or spontaneous prose.  Armistead Maupin, who wrote \"Tales of the City\" are a few of the names you will read about frequently. Once every two years, there is a huge fund raiser for the SF Symphony's music and education programs, the Black & White ball where all of the Civic Center streets is closed down.  City Hall, the Opera House, etc are opened to the patrons that dance, drink and roam the block party from building to building dressed in floor length ball gowns and tuxedos. The restaurants offer special menus, and are filled with all the fancy people.\n\nThe cute pockets of neighborhoods are just that.  All right next to each other, separated by a couple of minutes, they are distinct and have a certain flavor all of their own. Pacific Heights is just gorgeous, the huge mansions on the hills have panoramic views of the the entire city, the bay and of both the bridges.  The buildings are very close to each other, as real estate is prime here. Most of the office buildings in the financial district look out right into the windows of another office building. Halloween night in the Castro district is quite a scene with costumed people in the streets, in the balconies and windows, anywhere they can fit. It's a bit more interactive than the one in West Hollywood cause it is not as anonymous or large but just as flamboyant. The neighborhood street festivals are really great.  From Haight Street, Fillmore Street, Grant Avenue, Union Street, to Cherry Blossom in Jtown the locals are out in force enjoying the wine, food and crafts.  There is also a Golden Gate Park food festival where the top local restaurants have food stands.  The restaurants in the city have the best food you can find anywhere.  Crissy Field also major, where locals bike, jog and workout. The fireworks are also here during July 4th.    \n\nI can't really write or talk about SF or LA without mentioning the dating.  When I am in SF, I often feel like I should pair up.  Maybe it's the fog, or the twinkling night stars, or the cold nip in the air, but you feel like snuggling and having someone's arms around your shoulders.  Not so much, in LA cause there is too much to do!  Ok, I'm not going to say more than that, lol. The city closes down early, by 8 or 10, there are not that many options unless you are into clubs. About the cool, not the trendy - city folks are snobby about SF, why go to Palo Alto or San Jose or Berkeley when all the cool people live in The City??  Unlike LA, people balk at having to drive more than 15 minutes.  Anything further is \"too far,\" and it IS likely that this will deter plans for the evening. Yeah, parking does suck here, I use to keep an empty shoebox in the back of the car for those. Jefferson Starship and the Grateful Dead lived here way back when.  The hippie vibe is still seen in the Haight-Ashbury district; I saw Chris Issak play at the iBeam before he hit it big. It's gotten quite expensive to live here, rents are atrocious and there are slim pickings for good jobs. The overcast weather may be depressing to some.  For whatever reasons, New Yorkers like San Fran.  And yes, locals refer to SF as The City.  Here, you can be a big fish in a little pond - it's that kind of town.", "author": "Nancy Y."}

Plus, my sister already loved you.  So I let her convince me to move in with you.\n\nIt's been a year. I won't say it's been a great year because I don't do great. But it's been a growing year. I moved here not knowing what the h*ll I'm doing with my life, unemployed, and couch-surfing (well, day bed surfing) at my older sister's.  I still don't know what I'm doing with my life, but I am employed and live in my own (with roommates) apartment.  I know some great places to eat and how to get there by bus.\n\nI love how mercurial your weather is.  It's cold when I get up in the morning, hot when I take my lunch walk, warm when I go home. The guide book I bought when I first moved here said one sign of a true San Franciscan is the scarf peeking out of their bags even on the sunniest of days. Ah, how true that is.  Some days I want to scream at you, \"Turn on the d@mn sun!  I'm not a mushroom. I need light!\" But  your weeks of fog makes me that much more appreciative of the sun when it visits.\n\nI love your public transportation. I don't care what others say about you.   Your public transportation rocks. Maybe it's because I was smart enough to move to Castro where it's plentiful. I love not needing to drive and worry about plowing down pedestrians when I'm half awake at 6am.  I love looking at a map and being able to figure out how to get anywhere on you. You may be slow sometimes, but that allows me to read all the books I wouldn't otherwise have time for.\n\nI love your food.  I finally no longer miss my parents' cooking. Ok, maybe I still miss it, but it's easier now I have your streets and avenues of restaurants to fulfill any craving that hits me.

I now know the difference between good food and even better food. \n\nI know you see other people called tourists but that's fine.  Actually I love tourists simply because \"neener neener, I live here and you don't!\"  Tourists can be annoying but they're a constant reminder of why you're so awesome. And when those tourists are my friends, I have a great excuse to go places I won't see on my own. \n\nI know I don't go out with you as much as I should, but I promise to work on that in the upcoming year.\n\nLove,\nYanny", "author": "Yan E."}

Something about this city that is different yet so charming and lures you back each time. It's always fun, lots of excitement exploring new territories, new cities but I'm always glad and proud to be coming back to San Francisco! \n\nI visited SF for the first time in the late 90s and vowed to return and shortly there after, my job brought me back to the area and have been living here ever since. I'm not sure if I'm ready to trade this city for some place else, hmmm, ok maybe retiring in French Riviera, the Polynesian Islands or in Greece but ok realistically speaking, San Francisco boosts the sun, the fog, the ocean, the ski resort with a short drive away, wineries, melting pot of the West and the list goes on and on. Family, friends and relatives who have visited the area can attest to this and they vowed to be back and they keep coming back! :-)\n\nWith San Francisco, I discovered Yelp through a very good friend and with San Francisco, I've also met some really great people with tremendous hearts and that's including all Yelpers/Yelpettes (as Little Dragon X. would call the female Yelpers). I've also lured the love of my life to start his career and life here in San Francisco with me. hehehe....He loves it out here! :) He heard this song and had to be here!  http://www.sfheart.com/Songs/index.html (San Francisco by Scott McKenzie)\n\nTo all of you reading out there, new and old friends, family and loved ones, I love you all!

It is located on the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula and has traditionally been the focal point of the San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco is the second most densely populated major city (over 200,000 in population) in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, the Spanish became the first Europeans to settle in San Francisco, which they named for St. Francis. With the advent of the California gold rush in 1848, and the Comstock Lode and silver mines in 1859, the city entered a period of rapid growth. After being devastated by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt and is today one of the most recognizable cities in the world.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has a unique mix of physical characteristics, including its months-long episodes of fog, its steep rolling hills, its eclectic mix of architecture (including Victorian style houses and modern highrises), and being surrounded on three sides by the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. \r\n\r\nSan Francisco is the most beautiful city in the world!", "author": "A P."}

To combat my loneliness, I raced into a relationship which helped me to focus away from myself, my path and building a social net.\n\nBy the end of 2005, I found myself in a unhappy situation with her and escaped to new living quarters of 17th Ave in the Inner Sunset.  Through this new place, I had roommates such as Ryan the Great, Stan the Man, Jon the Cal Fan and Veronica the Party Animal....all individuals who helped me to turn around my life and regain my focus.  \n\nThrough my last two years in SF, I learned how to focus on building a social network and finding a core group of friends.  Softball was key, as I met Scott the Joker and his associates, who gave me plenty of opportunities to get out and sample the SF life....I still miss playing softball at Ft. Scott on Thursday nights and then heading to Final Final for drinks.\n\nI miss Stan the Man, the guy who first introduced me to Yelp.  While I only joined Yelp as I met a marvelous girl who was on yelp (but not that active), I found Yelp SF to be a godsend, as I found myself on September Saturday morning playing softball with a bunch of Yelpers who I had never met before- and they all came because I was willing to organize practice!\n\nOnce I got going with Yelp, I never turned back...it was (and is) a great distraction at work with the talk threads, and the different events always kept me entertained (checking out random movies at Red Vics in the Haight was an awesome Yelp event).\n\nSF is filled with both memories of highs and lows, but the last two years have been filled with great memories- spending lazy Sunday afternoons biking through Golden Gate Park, watching Cal games at our place, being  taken to a mock KISS concert by Stan, biking to Ocean Beach, working at UCSF, going to 22nd and Irving Grocery, playing softball at Ft. Scott, riding the N-Judah to Giants games, taking BART to see my Angels beat the A's, going to Live 105's summer/x-mas concerts, wandering downtown at christmas, watching sportscenter with Stan, going for drinks with Stan and Jon....\n\nAlas, my time ran out in May 2008 as I made the decision to go East to try out my life in grad school...and of course it was the right time for me to wipe the slate clean and start anew.....but I will always relish the memories and friends that I made.\n\nFinal tip-check out the Inner Sunset- I am really going to miss that area....having that great view of the ocean, the Marin Hills, and Golden Gate Park was always amazing.\n\n\nSo my lessons learned when moving to a new place- build a social net first, do things that you enjoy doing as there will always be chicks around to distract you....but building a social net first will give you friends that you can connect with. \n\nSF Yelp is amazing!!!!", "author": "Shaun O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-14", "description": "San Francisco is a poorly run, dilapidated, and dangerous city located at the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula.\n\nAfter coming to grips with  the beauty of the location, the first thing anybody will notice about San Francisco is the overwhelming population of vagrants. Often misidentified as \"homeless,\" the vagrants exist because of the perfect storm of permissive attitudes about drug enforcement (thanks to a romantic vision of the city in the 1960's and 1970's), vis-a-vis the numerous venues for free services, meals and health care.  San Francisco purposefully encourages vagrants to move to the city. Any suggestion about enforcing the laws to discourage vagrancy is termed, \"criminalizing the poor.\" This is a direct result of the powerful \"nonprofit industrial complex\" that take public money to service the vagrants, and then turn around and use that money to advocate against the very government that funds the programs. Public urination, defecation, drug dealing, and smash and grab crimes pervade the city. \n\nLet me put this in perspective.  I've had my car broken into eight (yes EIGHT) times.  I had my 2001 Jetta vandalized (kicked in trunk, roof jumped up and down on, windshield smashed, passanger side door kicked in.)  My car never really recovered from that.  I've had a surfboard - that I made myself - stolen off of my car, in front of my house.   I've had two bicycles stolen.  Both were locked.  One was in broad daylight in front of my job.  I had a fixed gear wheel stolen, within 45 minutes of being locked up (this was while I was volunteering to help out with a bicycle messenger union dispute).\n\nMuch of the responsibility for the corruption that allows vagrants to run rampant falls on the Board of Supervisors. Because San Francisco voters are overwhelmingly renters and people who get subsidized housing from the city, people who actually own property in the city are relentlessly victimized by the government. Along with the victimization is thrown in an attitude of contempt for \"the rich.\" \"Gentrification\" is a pejorative term in the city, unless one is talking about politically correct neighborhoods like The Castro. \n\nThe infrastructure of the city is falling a part.  Bicyclist must remain ever vigilant of the dangerous conditions of the streets.\n\nOtherwise, the city has good amenities and entertainment venues, although San Francisco is no New York.", "author": "M.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-22", "description": "This review will make you angry.  San Francisco is a dump.  What would one expect with a collapsing education system, busted city budgets, and sky-rocketing taxes coupled with a cost of living that is unrivaled in all of the Americas, save NYC. \n\nI ponder these issues as I trudge my way though the Mission District past the flowered memorials marking yet another round of daily murders.  I find temporary refuge in Noe Valley and the Castro.  My destination restaurant is closed for good, Bistro 24, a sign of the times.  Luckily a small italian place nearby , Lupa, saves me with a phenomenal smoked mozzarella and tortellini.  Time to catch my show, Wicked.  Enroute I'm offered something black in a tin-foil pouch while sitting at a red light.  I forcibly look away from the toothless seller.  We're late, it's after sunset in the tenderloin, and there is nowhere to park.  I nearly hit someone sitting on a curb, needle in hand.  Round and round and round the blocks... bingo, a spot.  I lock the doors and we dash for the theater, dodging the man shamelessly urinating in the middle of a crowded sidewalk.  What is that smell?\n\n'What a show' we tell each other with smiles as we casually wind our way back to our car.  This turned out to be a short lived euphoria as we stood, speechless, at the busted glass diamonds surrounding my bumper.  My wife's folding commuter bike missing from the cargo area.  A phone call to the police only produces a snide, 'What do you want us to do?' There's a man defecating in a dark corner of the sidewalk across the street.\n\nYou see, when the city has no money, it can no longer afford to prosecute small crimes.  Offenders are set free mere hours after incarceration. The police simply give up and focus on the big game: violent offenders, wealthy neighborhoods.  So begins the big decline.\n\nThis is not just one night; it's the daily pattern of life in SF.  Public transportation is an expensive hassle, as is parking, dinner reservations, cable installation, rent, etc etc.  Just ask any native about these issues and watch their eyes avert yours as they sheepishly defend their failing city.  The non-native locals, including myself, grasp for the good things... the food scene, the weather, pause, did I mention food?  Eventually conversation drifts towards their past cities.  They miss that little farmhouse in Healdsburg, their little Jersey deli, Colombian mountainsides, that kickin' texmex joint in Austin, or that jazzy historic bungalow they bought in downtown Mobile for $130K.  For a brief moment those 535 sushi joints in the bay area don't eclipse the 12 in all of Oklahoma City.\n\nSan Francisco has EVERYTHING... the ocean, snow skiing, mountain sports, culture, national parks, food.  Unfortunately only the wealthy can take true advantage of everything the bay offers.  Most are too busy trying to pay rent, keep up with bills, find another job, keep their current job, fix their burglarized vehicles, sit in endless traffic, communicate with their reclusive neighbors, and prep for the next $63/month increase in living expenses.

Fortunately, I found two incredible roommates on Craigslist, moved to the City on a Saturday and began work that Monday.\n\nIn the past 8 months, I have:\n-Auctioned myself as a Charity Date\n-Volunteered with Yelp friends at the Food Bank on Thanksgiving\n-Had a \"boot\" placed on my car\n-Been listed in Craigslist Missed Connections and had dinner with said admirer, who was surprisingly normal\n-Bumped into random people, ie: My sister's boyfriend's best friend from San Diego and an ex-boyfriend who wants to know what happened to me, because I'm more attractive now (ouch!)\n-Got a tattoo\n-Developed a fondness for food (and lessened food guilt)\n-Began reading poetry again\n-Become accustomed to saying, \"expense that!\"\n-Been Interviewed/photographed for a newspaper\n-Spent hours daydreaming how I should spend my 4 weeks of vacay\n-Met some amazing people, who have dramatically impacted my life \n-Reconnected with a high-school friend, who is now my urban hiking buddy, pastry chef extraordinaire, Valentine's Day Date, and bestest bud.\n-Realized that it's okay to be yourself, you don't have to do things because you feel pressured or like you'll be judged if you don't participate.  Everyone is different, so embrace that.\n\nI still can't believe what an amazing city we live in.  It's an incredible gift, and I am grateful for every day I'm able to spend here.\n\nSure, it's expensive, but isn't self-discovery worth paying a few extra bucks?\n\n\"Each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life.

As a young adult in the Midwest, I felt that there was more out there that I wanted to see, more that I wanted to do.  So I headed to NYC to get my masters. Despite the effects of the on-the-go, in-your-space lifestyle, I still loved that city.  I loved the culture. I loved the diversity. I saw myself living in NYC for the greater part of my adult life.\n\nBut then, life happens. A great professional opportunity arose for me: a one-year position in San Francisco that would give me freedom to apply to doctoral programs. My entire life, I had *never* considered living on the West Coast. Isn't that for really laid back people who say \"dude\" a lot? I had just begun to get settled in NYC, finally adjusted to the urban life, established relationships, had professional connections. In SF, I had two friends and zero relatives. But I decided to follow my gut and throw myself into a completely unpredictable year. \n\nI won't lie. The first five months or so, I had a strong disdain for SF. I made constant comparisons to NYC, and SF always came up short. I bemoaned the seeming necessity of a car. MUNI couldn't hold a candle to the MTA. Businesses close so early! The food is so fussy! Bourgie people with their organic produce and cage-free eggs! \n\nAs I got over the adjustment hump, I realized that I had been unfair and naive in comparing SF to NYC. It's like comparing Fujis with Navels. So, I stopped complaining and sought to embrace all the wonderful unique things that SF has to offer. This meant pushing myself to take risks and try things I had never considered before. I became active on Yelp, a robust community that could only flourish like it has in a city as open-minded as SF. I met and became friends with people from different walks of life, learning something new from each and every one of them. I reaped the culinary and cultural benefits living in a city with the largest Asian population in the US. I took in the wonders of Nature at Muir Woods, in wine country, and even just walking around Russian Hill. I acquainted myself with the many different neighborhoods, appreciating the character and cultural differences in each one (the Mission and the Richmond being my favorites). I learned that people don't just buy organic to be pretentious but to support the local agricultural industry...and that everything from the Farmer's Market really does look, smell, and taste better! I realized that business close early because people truly value quality of life! And maybe I wanted that too...a life where I am not struck with Seasonal Affective Disorder every year, a life where I actually get out and enjoy myself  instead of fighting the crushing of my soul.\n\nBefore I knew it, I had fallen in love with San Francisco and the Bay Area. Of course, like any city, it has its pros and cons. But, ironically, for a place I had never seen myself living in, I have never felt more like \"myself\"- a happier, more open-minded, easy-going, extroverted, nature-loving person that I had never even known possible. As I move on to this next phase of my life, I take a piece of SF with me in my heart. Yes, I am very sad to be away, but I take comfort in knowing that one day I will return to the city that my soul calls Home.", "author": "Steph P."}

The parking situation isn't very good, but I guess living in LA, it's not much better.  Hate the Gnats, umm, the Giants.

This city is awesome.  There are innumerable connections to the rest of the world, and innovation on every corner, in every dimension: from food to art to technology.  This city, and the SF area in general, eagerly welcomes the best products, talents, and ideas from the rest of the world and enthusiastically shares local innovation globally.\n\nVisiting SF?

Within double that, you can be in the other avant garde mecca: Los Angeles.\n\nWeather, people, food, culture, industry, education, scenery, action and rest: SF has it all.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-01-21", "description": "San Francisco is a city that most people get emotional, week in the knees just by the name.  But that is the lens of a visitor and if that the visitor has a good experience.  Recently, I had two guests visiting.  They rented a car at the airport and picked me so we could get to our dinner reseravations.  But as we were returning to my apartment we discovered that their luggage that was in the trunk was stolen.   The neighbourhood where we had dinner was a very safe or seemingly so area.   It was a pretty well trafficked street and if I had to pick a probability it would have been less than 1 in a 100.  It is just a horrible feeling to missing those things you need to wear for the remainder of your trip.  BUT if you had liquid medication which in our securitized world and if you are on a plane you are hasseled and instead of going through that hastle you check it in.  My friend had a specialized prescription that if she needed a refill that even in SF she may not get it readily.  And in her case she would have to go to the hospital when she had run out of medication.   So the need to return back to her home was needed.  We did everything possible; called police, completed report.  And this time of year there was concern of weather.   These visitors don't have the \"I left my heart in San Francisco....\" they will always think of their missing luggage and missed holiday.\n\nI had my bicycle stolen at the front door of Whole Foods Market on 4th Street on a bright midday Sunday.  I have to find humour in someone asking if I locked my bike....   \n\nI do find the City becoming a less liberal and more mean spirited.  The corporate upbuild of over-priced condos is the City's only priority.   The mid class is a becoming extinct and City Hall is fine with that.  I like when there are City sponsored below market value condos for sale; I do not know how any human being can qualify; how do you come up with a down payment and maintain high mortgage???  But how do you maintain the mortgage without a higher income than is officially allowed....  another thing to ponder.\n\nRudeness.   I am amazed how rude people are here.  There is almost no civility or decorum... this goes for public and working life.  I do not know how many times I am hit on the head on BART or my feet are trampled on.... and this is not when the train is most crowded.   And because it is BART that implicates rudeness is from all over the bay area.\n\nWhen the City is over-romanticized I immediately am grounded.   I do find that working in this City is to work with overly sensentive souls.   I know this is not New York but somehow people forget what happened yesterday because life is too busy.  And in this realty San Franciscans fester and ferment on the ills of yesterday and can't seem to move forward;  San Franciscans seemingly think that this is the center of the universe and are soon disappointed to find out that it is not.", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-08", "description": "This is my first review. This is not going to be about San Francisco. Or maybe in a way it will be. The kind of review I wanted to pop my cherry with does not fit in any category on yelp. So I decided to post it in San Francisco because it seems like anything fits in San Francisco. \nIt's 8.8.08 today. I'm supposed to feel lucky. The Olympics have started. I'm supposed to be mad about the Olympics. My parents are from Tibet. They left Tibet for India when the Chinese came over and didn't agree with the kind of lifestyle my parents were living. That resulted in my parents giving birth to me in India and I think it's fair to say I have been mad ever since. I moved to the US 10 yrs ago but that hasn't stopped me from being mad. So I don't think these people know what they're talking about when they say I should be mad because the international community has agreed to let China host the Olympics. I don't know if it's right for China to host the Olympics or not. I don't know if China hosting the Olympics is going to hurt me any worse, or if China not hosting the Olympics would have healed me any better. I think this is between China and whoever decides who gets to host the Olympics. The point is that I am mad. And I have been, for a long time, regardless of whether had China hosted the Olympics or not. So at this point, I want to say that I wish every athlete participating in the Olympics good luck, and hope that the best athlete wins. I am going to be mad regardless. It doesn't matter if the US men's basketball team again loses to some poor third world country with less than average resources. It doesn't matter if some fanatic East Turkistan organization hijacks a bus full of Japanese tourists thinking they're Chinese and demand all the gold medals of the Olympics in ransom. I am going to be mad regardless. \nMy parents think I'm going to write something phenomenal one day. Something about their history, something that will reconcile me to myself and finally make me un-mad. They think writing is my profession because that's what I spent all their tuition money on. Instead I wander from restaurant to restaurant picking up plates and clearing tables convincing myself all the time that I'm collecting materials, that I'm un-maddening myself. \nI did say in the beginning that this review may very well turn into a review about San Francisco. Whether it has or not, I will leave that up to you. If it has, good. If it hasn't, good. I am mad. Regardless.", "author": "Jay k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-02-15", "description": "If you don't want to read what I got to say, watch this, as it sums SF up nicely: http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1002/  \nalso, for kicks, watch the Family Guy episode.... \n\nA note to the reader... \ncall this piece facts interspersed with opinion. enjoy!..\n\nI came to SF when I was 8 from Colorado... and from the start, it wasn't for me. Back then the city was so much worse in-terms of development than it is now, but still, it retains a lot of its decrepit character, albeit, not as much. Along with that are the scores of homeless, which are still out in full force. SF, in fact boasts the most per capita in North America (that's a continent including the country of Mexico by the way..). \nAlso, the city is the second most densely populated after NYC. Ummm, I know how SF-cans like to compare themselves to NYC or whatever-- which is very cute by the way--but being behind NY in density is not good by any means. I mean, you wonder why the parking sucks! right? And that's another thing... transportation blows. Barts ok... but that's it. Muni?.. Whatever--Nuff' said. No good comprehensive freeway systems, a lot of a-hole drivers--and bad--I mean BAD!!!--ones at that. And while NYC is hellish to drive in compared to SF, then again, NY has a good public transportation system, which is more than I can say for SF... and that brings me to my other point (speaking of NYC).\nPeople in SF have an incessant need to compare themselves with such cities as NY, and almost always talk down on LA for what I interpret as being an inferiority complex (a famous quote: SF and LA are in a competition, but SF is the only one who really cares or knows about it), which is funny because in all the times I've been to LA, they always had nice things to say about SF, which is more than I could say about SF-cans, as they always have a need to trash LA). But as for NYC... besides being behind them in density though, and tourism--which doesn't say anything about quality of living--think *Vegas*--there's really nothing to compare. In fact, I find it ironic that so many in SF compare themselves to NY without ever having gone there (as they do with so many other areas of the world without ever having gone there). What's more is so many SF-cans brand the city as European (mind you with a 30% Chinese population--very European indeed), which makes no sense, as Europe is a freaking cultural continent made up of a mixture of countries, each different than the next. (Also, urine filled streets teemed with homeless aren't very European.)\nAnd calling SF the City?.. as if none other exists?.. Referring to most of America as backwards, red-neck, republican, ignorant, close-minded, racist, etc (sounds kind of backwards, ignorant, and close-minded--and hypocritical--above all else--to me)... with, again, never having really gone anywhere. And speaking of open mindedness, it's a city that lacks just that. For if it didn't, people whose views, beliefs and values that didn't match up to those of most other SF-cans would be accepted (or tolerated at the least)... but that's the exception, as it usually never is the case (so much for open-mindedness). \nOther than that, the obvious list of things (which, for some reason, everybody except SF-cans really seem to acknowledge -- call it some kind of denial)....\n\n1-The weather sucks. (Along with the beaches.) \n2-The women... (damn, I hate comparing other cities, but if all of America was like this in this department, America would truly suck). \nOh, on that point, the female-male ratio is one of the worst amongst most major US cities, besides SJ, with more guys than gals (take that to bed with you).\n3-Has the highest rates of mental illness per-capita than any other major US city. (No wonder there are so many weird-ass people here! And that's weird as in weird, not weird as in it adds to the diversity BS, etc.. a lame--and weird--ass argument that I've actually heard before.)\n\nIn all, SF is a nice, cute little west coast tourist town that's nice to visit (it's to LA what Boston is to NYC, if you will). That's all. Not really the most feasible, or best place to live.\n\nSorry. Truth hurts.", "author": "Mike S."}

And I'm up in the City a lot--but almost exclusively for the restaurants.  Nothing in the park is worth seeing twice, the museums suck, the beaches are gross and I don't go shopping for crap I don't need, so restaurants are all that's left.  But my, what restaurants.  Godzila, House, Le Colonial, Rubicon, San Tung, Dosa.  I realized this weekend, though, why I moved:  Disgust.  The whole city is just so damn dirty.  I always figured that's just the way it is when you're in a US city until I went to NY.  NY simply blew me away with how sanitary it was....the people, the streets, the sidewalks--everything!  SF is just knappy by comparison.

Almost without exception, all of the out-of-towners I know who've suckered themselves into going to Fisherman's Wharf or Pier 39 return with 'was accosted by a leper wanting a dollar to ride the bus stories.

SF .. wow, so much to say, yet so little time/space ...\n\nyea, i'm an LA girl at heart ... and will always be ... nothing can stop me in from being one, but it's crazy, even though i'm not from the midwest or the south, given that i'm STILL in the same state, there's a whole world of difference! \n\neven though i'm an LA girl, i have love for my HALOS (cough cough), not DODGERS, so no reason to hate! =D i think i went to more GIANTS games then DODGERS .. so there!\n\ni've lived in sf for a year now, and i have to say that it was probably the best decision i have ever made in my life ... where can you find a place with so much culture? looking back at my journey, i must say, it was one heck of a year filled with nutty festivities ... from a pillow fight, bay to breakers, sf lgbt parade, etc etc ...  great transportation too!  just because i'm from LA didn't mean i was going to be all princess-ed out, i DID take advantage of the BART, the MUNI, and my NEXT means of transpo: CABLE CAR ... just you wait, i shall do it soon ..\n\nfantastic gems of restaurants, salons and shops hidden away from the main streets, with a pocketful of glory in every corner you can possibly imagine! i love how one district is right by the other, so you pretty much hit like 3-4 in 1 ... i live in the marina, but you walk one way, you're in presidio, the other way, russian hill, or walk up south, and you're in pac heights ... it sounds far, but it's really not ... trust me, im from LA, where a car is needed at all costs, and i was able to walk from the marina to the AT&T park, all by walking one strip of the infamous embarcadero.\n\nfor a place that's 7x7, sf, you have given me such FOND memories ... lots of gorgeous landmarks, not to mention, my all time favorite, the Golden Gate Bridge, which i have walked across it at least 9-10x... \n\n-1 for the nasty foggy weather ... how do you SF-ers live through this fugly weather? it's depressing, and yet, has quite some character ... SF is like a girl .. she PMSes at the most random times ... one day, super sunny, another day, super foggy ... oh, and that fog horn! soo annoying! i might as well live in SMOG capital of the world, aka LA and not to mention, parking ... parking spaces, and how notorious these locals are when it comes to parking ... my car has been dinged wayy more than my own age ... :( i've been warned by a dear friend prior to my move, but i couldn't have believed it until it happened ... \n\nshiet, where else can you live and be \"proud\" to say you live freakin on a landfill, aka, the marina and be truly blessed to say you will be the first to go? lol.. bleh\n\nanyways, i've been extremely dedicated in writing my reviews religiously (for my own personal sake // sanity), and sf has given me a world of wonderous memories...\n\ni know i won't live in sf for the rest of my life, and i know this will be SO true when i leave SF one day, but i hate to say this, but i feel it already -- it's so true when they say, \"i left (will leave) my heart in sf\" OOPS! i meant, LA...\n\noh gawd, i feel that my sf chapter will soon come to a close, i just know it, i just feel it, i can see the future!! :)\n\nthank you, San Francisco, for the memories ...", "author": "Jennifer S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-01-23", "description": "I think SF either speaks to you or it doesn't.  I'm still listening, but not hearing much. Maybe it's because all those hideous webs of overhead electrical wiring are creating interference. Or maybe it's just hard to hear when there's a homeless guy hitting me up for a donation to his crack fund for the 11th time today.  \n\nSorry, but I really don't get the appeal of the City by the Bay at all. Yes, it has some nice scenery and lovely views. Yes, some of the restaurants are decent (though I've had much better food in NYC, Boston, DC and even - dare I say it? - LA). And yes, many of the people are interesting and relatively educated (albeit oftentimes gratingly self-righteous and smug about it). The downside is that the City is grungy, decrepit, overpriced, hugely inconvenient to get around, sorely lacking in amenities (no Target, for God's sake?), situated atop fault lines that may blow at any time, prone to damp/cold/gloomy weather and populated by what are surely the most physically unattractive specimens of any US urban area. It appears to me that the City seems to be a safe haven for everyone who is simply too friggin' weird to fit in anywhere else. (Sure, I realize that's probably part of its appeal for many people - but that doesn't necessarily make for a very comfortable or pleasant urban living experience on a practical, day-to-day basis.) \n\nBut don't try telling this to a San Francisco resident - they're more convinced of their city's absolute supremacy than George Bush is of the correctness of his Iraq strategy. Nowhere in the world - not even in NYC - are a city's denizens so zealously, fanatically obsessed with their locale, and so unwilling to hear a single negative word uttered against it. What is often most baffling about this (and perhaps even a little quaint) is that many, if not most, of the strongest defenders of SF I have encountered - who swear they would never be caught dead living anywhere else - are remarkably provincial souls have never even spent that much time outside the City. They'll trash LA mercilessly, then confess they only spent one weekend there 10 years ago. They'll bash NYC shamelessly, then turn around and admit they've yet to actually set foot in Manhattan. Their idea of exploring a world outside their own consists of little more than taking the BART over to Berkeley to buy some new Birkenstocks.\n\nWell, I'm sorry to break this to you all, but having lived in various cities across the country over the years, and extensively visited many of the world's great metropolises, I can honestly say that SF is the least of them in terms of vibrancy, quality of life and overall bang for the buck.\n\nOh, and I hate to the bearer of bad news, but Janis, Jimi and Jerry are all dead, and it hasn't been 1969 since... 1969. Step away from the drum circle, hose off the patchouli and move the f*&# on already.\n\nYes, I'm finished now (damn, that felt good...).", "author": "Rick A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-14", "description": "A world class city, Bagded by the bay, the city by the bay. San Francisco is all that and more. Sure, it is one of more expensive cities in the bay area and could be a more business friendly, but it is still a treasure at that. You have restaurants surfing food from all over the world (from dives to upscale,) bars and clubs that cater to every crowd in terms of sexual preference; age; and budget (everything from dives to upscale,) lots of attractions weather a tourist or local (pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, North Beach, Japantown, and so forth.) Every neighborhood has its own distinct feel and offerings (Chinese in Chinatown, Japanese in Japantown, Italian in North Beach, gay; lesbian; and transgender activity in the Castro with many good restaurants, restaurants ranging from cheep to moderate with a few expensive joints in the richmond and sunset, upscale eateries and shopping in Pacific Heights, modern and hippy type surroundings and merchandise in the Heit, trendy, upscale environment in SOMA, Mexican and Latin fare and services in the mission, and eclectic everything in NOPA/Western Addition.) It may be foggy and cool with a few rare hot days, but it doesn't stop this peninsula resident from coming in. You have shops and services for every taste, race, and budget, as well as auto dealers of every make and auto repair shops for every part of your car. It is only minutes from Oakland and Marin and not too far from the rest of the bay area. MUNI and BART can take you wherever you need to go. It is fun to visit Ocean Beach and watch the waves crash up on to the shore. There are a lot of parks with plenty of greenery and picnick tables, some on hills like Sunset Heights Park with breathtaking panoramic views of the city and bay area. I love Golden Gate Park as it has something for everyone (tennis, the marrygoround which I was addicted to as a child, boat rentals on Stowe Lake which is peaceful in and itself a nice break from city life without leaving the city, the Japanese tea garden with Japanese landscapes; bridges over the little pond; a tranquil waterfall, and a pagoda with little Japanese nibblies and the best tea, hiking, the arboretum, and plenty of space for football; socker; and baseball.) \n\nMayer Newsum needs to follow through on what he said in his state of the city address about bringing more jobs and business growth to the city. The supervisors need to be raned in with their fees for this and that and their overall zaney antics. Only then will San Francisco be the business friendly city it was and will be 100% back to normalHe is doing his best to tackle homelessness and other problems that you would expect any large city to have.  . But, I will say that Gavin is doing a wonderful job as Mayer and always wants to make things better which I know he will continue to do. San Francisco is in a class by itself with much diversity and a wide erray of shops, restaurants, and services, it truly has something for everyone.", "author": "Brian S."}

It's now May, so it's getting close to a year.  The first seven months or so, i was stuck back in Parkside, then I moved to Castro.  My first month or so, I was a little bit thinking, did i make the right choice?  But after i came to know this city, I LOVE IT!  The people - the people are so nice.  They are really friendly, and I don't know what people are talking about when they say sf people are stuck up.  People in SF are smart, but they dont brag about it.  In sf, it's not about what degree you have, or what special designer bag you have.  I've made so many more friends here already than when I lived back east...  And there's so much to do!  There's always this restaurant to try, this club to go to, this talk to listen to, this fair to check out...  Sometimes i feel overwhelmed at the sheer amount of fun things to occupy myself.  Sometimes i just want to hide in my house and relax!  Yes, never a bored moment...  Even the liberal spirit that exists, the naked people in the street, the protests, the absolute open gayness, you wont find things like these other places.   Of course, there are too many homeless people, and it can get quite expensive living here, but you cant expect anything to be perfect...  I would absolutely reccomend anyone to move here.
