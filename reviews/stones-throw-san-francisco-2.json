This was so basic, they should have just given it for free.\n\nperfect potatoes was pretty in pictures but was just basic when you ate it. It was basically a croquette with pur\u00e9ed cauliflower underneath.\n\nThe chicken liver mousse was a hard pass. It was super salty and the bread was so burnt it was black.\n\nThe squid ink pasta was super al dente the seafood was so tiny and so over cooked it was extra rubbery.\n\nThe uni carbonara was watery and was sitting in a puddle of water.\n\nFood presentation was awesome though and looks great for all of our Instagram photos. However the flavors just were very basic and it was not well done.\n\nThe worst part was no choco taco!!! It's the first picture on their Yelp and the one thing I was really looking forward too.\n\nIn comparison to other restaurants of this style, I'd have to say Frances is better.", "author": "Vi Y."}

We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening (and had a reservation, so we were seated immediately). We started off with the puffed potato and eggs, and firebrand bread. The puffed potato and eggs were to die for, absolutely delicious. The firebrand bread, was good, but it was bread. I typically like my bread pretty soft and this one was a bit more chewy, so wasn't a huge fan but I slathered a ton of butter on it which made it more than satisfactory. \n\nWe tried the heirloom melon and cucumber salad, hamachi crudo and squid ink conchiglie pasta from the starter section. The heirloom salad had \"burrata\" in the description so I anticipated it looking like a burrata dish. The pieces of burrata were so small that I almost missed them... the salad was good but be warned, it's really not a lot of burrata included in the dish. The starters were a little hard to split between 4 people just because they were so tiny. The hamachi crudo was good, I've had a lot better fish but it's always been at top tier sushi restaurants. The squid ink conchiglie pasta was absolutely fantastic, one of the highlights of the night for sure (besides the potato dish from earlier). \n\nThe pan-seared halibut and waygu were the mains that we ordered and came out last. I'm not a big halibut person so I'm probably the wrong person to review this dish, I thought it was just \"ok\", nothing special about it. The waygu steak was fantastic, significantly more up my alley than the fish was. \n\nQuick mention for our drinks, I ordered some kind of peach cocktail and expected it to be very fruity and sweet. I must have missed the part where it states it has jalepeno, so instead it was incredibly spicy... I'm not a big fan of spicy so I spent the whole meal delicately sipping this one. The desserts we ordered were the chocolate cake, peaches and cream and the peanut butter and jelly donuts. We were warned that the chocolate cake was rich, and boy, was the waitress right. I could only take a few bites of it before I had to switch to another dish because of the richness. The peach custard looked and tasted like mochi ice cream, it was tasty but I couldn't see it as anything special because it really just seemed like mochi ice cream to me. The peanut butter and jelly donuts were great. The donuts tasted and felt like beignets, with peanut butter and jelly to accompany them.\n\nThe restaurant was a bit expensive for what you get, but all in all, a good experience. Except the part where the waitress was cleaning the table and knocked over a wine glass, but she kindly refilled it and apologized, accidents happen :).", "author": "Katie Y."}

We tried literally every item on the menu except the tomato soup, risotto, and bread and almost every single item was a unique delight to the senses. I felt the pastas were the weak point in their menu (except the ravioli which had one of the best textures and fillings I've ever had in ravioli) and the burger could've been improved with a slightly coarser grind but these were minor complaints to an otherwise spectacular meal. I highly recommend the strawberry rhubarb non-alcoholic cocktail.", "author": "Andrew H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-23", "description": "Excellent Brunch. We've been looking for a place to get a good, reasonably priced brunch without chaos and hours waiting. Stone's Throw is definitely that place, only we'd say the brunch is much better than good. They take reservations which helps keep the atmosphere manageable.\n\nAtmosphere: relaxed casual, NOT loud but the place was full, trestle table in the center with a large centerpiece. Simple. The focus is on the food, but the atmosphere is quietly doing its part (and it has a very nice bar). Windows overlook Hyde street. Mostly banquette seating, but our neighbors were not unbearably close.\n\nService: Hi Neighbor has got the service down. Having visited their other restaurants one of their biggest pluses is the friendliness and knowledge-ability of the staff. But, the restaurant is also run with group service. So your glass is constantly being filled, dirty plates are whisked away, and you aren't trying to flag down YOUR waiter.  To add to the efficient service, the staff is very friendly and comfortable without being intrusive.\n\nFood: Amazing brunch, really. I can't say enough about the flavors (and none of them were the \"usual brunch\" favs). There's a prix fix $20 menu and some additional sides (add the potatoes stuffed with egg with a cauliflower puree--this is to die for. And I would eat that as my meal-but the other dishes are sooo . . . good). The meal starts with a bread basket, jam, ricotta and nut butter (you could also have cheddar, pate and pickles). This was the least amazing, not that it wasn't good, but save room for the mains. We especially like the sour dough bread (and the strawberry jam is literally like pure strawberry flavor).\n\nFor our second course, we had the fried chicken that is served with a sausage gravy and two beautifully poached eggs. Huge amount of food, but we ate almost the entire thing. Fried chicken has a very mild tarragon flavor that really sets it above other similar dishes. And getting a bite of the chicken with gravy and egg is a flavor sensation. And, we ordered the ham and cheese sandwich. We could not decide which we preferred and decided they were both great. The ham and cheese is on a brioche bun slathered with pimento cheese with just a hint of heat topped with a real slice of ham (not sliced ham) and an egg. And there is some kind of amazing relish underlying the whole shebang that puts this dish outside the league of most ham and cheese sandwiches. I am guessing some kind of sliced turnips though don't quote me on that, but it was such a great compliment to the sandwich.\n\nThe third course surprised me. I'm not a donut eater and the course was billed as peach donuts. But, it was not really a donut. It was more like a beignet (but not a beignet either). It's not light but it's not heavy. It's covered with a sugar glaze and nuts (I think I'd like it without the sugar glaze. For me, it distracted from the other flavors). It sits on a thick peach jam.\n\nThey also have a great wine and beer list organized around flavors not grapes. And offer a few cocktails like a mimosa and a Pimm's cup.\n\nLooking for a perfect foodie overnight in the city? Start at Trestle (another hi neighbor restaurant that's amazing) for dinner, then head to City Lights book store and soak up some San Francisco history (City Lights is 65 years old and has some of the best curated books around.)  Then head to Stones Throw for brunch the next day. That's the kind of twofer people dream about!", "author": "Vivek V."}

They actually write a little happy birthday card and offered us a complimentary birthday dessert. \n\nStones throw is a cute little restaurant that has a small but flavorful menu. For appetizers we got the potato and egg balls and the hamachi crudo. For mains we got the pasta with short rib sauce and the steak. Everything we had was good. The hamachi had fried onion crisps on top and served with avocado cream I believe?  It was fresh and tart and the fish was delicious. The potato and egg balls were interesting. Had great flavor and tasted like breakfast :). \n\nThe pasta was delicious. The sauce reminded me of a slow cooked bolognese and the short rib was pieces were tender and juicy.

I bet the guys at our party were still completely starving.\n\nOn to the food: The puffed potato and egg \"snack\" melts in your mouth. Very unexpected and sooo yummy. Shrimp ceviche was tasty too. Different than most ceviches. Mushroom ragu and pea risotto were both way too salty. My scallops were good but nothing spectacular. The dessert menu exceeded my expectations. Based off of childhood food memories... so cute. We ordered a few different items including their \"peanut butter and jelly donut\"--which are actually beignets with splashes of pb&j. Sooo yummy. Fresh, light and fluffy pillows of fried dough. The Fudgsicle was a treat to the eyes and tastebuds. Chocolate and kiwi bits with black sesame chunks. Very creative.

They're masters at the art of making one feel warm and welcome.  When I called less than 90 minutes before my 7 p.m. reservation, asking if they could take my party of four 30 minutes later than planned on a Saturday night, they couldn't have been more gracious with their response.  I didn't catch even a whiff of my request being unreasonable.  \n\nGive me more too, of that beautifully prepared food.  My party gamely tried to sample as many dishes as possible and we put quite a dent in the menu.  Alas though, this would not be Canteen (RIP), where we actually did once order the entire menu and still recall the experience with excitement.  Here, we found Stones Throw dishes to be lovely in presentation and tasty, each a little jewel box of delight.  \n\nPlease do give me more of the actual food though, particularly the starters and snacks.  I was saddened to have only a small bite of Citrus Poached Shrimp ($10) and Hamachi Crudo.  Perhaps the kitchen could up the price and quantity when they know that a dish will be shared amongst 4.  \n\nSo:  Stellar hospitality, beautiful presentation, and delicious food though maybe less than you desire.  What's a person to do?\n\nDa' Burger.  \n\nActually, Da' Burger and the desserts are a good way to ensure you leave here sated (but also, just because it's great, don't miss the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta, $17).  The kitchen quartered Da' Burger for our table and in addition to being fabulous, it provided the satisfying fullness I sought.  Get it.  \n\nCelebrating 3 birthdays mandated at least 3 desserts in addition to the already consumed cocktails and two bottles of wine.  We went big then went home.  The Rhubarb Cheesecake briefly looked too pretty to eat but proved not so.  Down the gullet; Great and wildly creative desserts.\n\nStones Throw is a delightful place to celebrate.  It doesn't look like anything much but the enthusiastic staff and the perfectly executed creations turn it into something quite sweet that'll leave you, as me, wanting more of it all.", "author": "Tracey A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-27", "description": "The food's fantastic, the ambiance is dark and engaging, and I'm definitely torn between 3 and 4 stars.\n\nSimply put, I felt that there's just not enough wow for how much effort you'll need to dine here. Reservations aren't too difficult, but they will call you the day before + text you the day of, which I understand is to make sure those who reserve actually show up; but it makes me feel like a lot of people no-show this place (despite the food... we'll get there.)\n\n(Parking is also notably tough here, so you'll either have to luck out or Lyft.)\n\nNow comes the speed... our party was fully present at 8:20 for an 8:15 reservation, and I'm pretty sure we started eating around 9pm. The servers were definitely very nice, but it's hard to enjoy even that when you're hangry after 40 minutes. There isn't any bread or anything like that, so it's just  the sporadic \"we'll be with you in a moment\" until they actually do come.\n\nAs for the food, the menu changes quarterly - and the potato puffs are definitely fantastic (definitely must-try). Everything else is probably pretty good honestly, though keep in mind that the portion is really small. Like if you wanted to eat heartily, you may want to consider getting 2-3 mains per person. If you're a big eater, maybe your own snack, your own starter, and 2 mains will be okay. \n\nThat being said, Stones Throw is a really good place to try something great if you're a local (since parking/Lyft is less of an issue). If you're entertaining folks of out town or want more bang for your buck, there are definitely many places that trump Stones Throw in both quality and quantity.", "author": "Greg G."}

Every bite was delicious and it kept the palate intrigued. The second stop was the seared beef with pickled vegetables. The beef was cooked perfect and the sourness from the vegetables added an extra pop to the dish. The last stop was fun and engaging; they ask you to write down your favorite childhood dessert- I hope mine makes a debut on their menu. The peaches and cream were delicious.

What a wonderful restaurant!\nI really have nothing but good things to say about Stones Throw.\n\nFOOD:\n- Puffed potato and eggs ($8): With cauliflower mousse, chives, and crispy chicken skin. I know this was just a starter/snack, but this was SO GOOD. It came with about four puffed potatoes served in a dish of cauliflower mousse, but I honestly could have eaten about then of those little magical potato puff creations and still be craving more. The potatoes are perfectly fluffy and the crispy chicken skin adds just the right amount of crunch and texture.\n\n- Duck Liver Mousse ($10): With walnut genoise, beet gelee, apples, and mustard greens. If you are a fan of duck liver mousse, you are going to loveeee the duck liver mousse at Stones Throw-- super creamy and rich.\n\n- Squid Ink Conchiglie ($17): With spicy capers, calms, mussels, shrimp, and tender greens. The conchiglie pasta looked more like fusilli pasta to me, but that didn't detract in the slightest from how much I enjoyed this dish. The flavor was spot on. My only complaint would be that I wish that the portion size was bigger.\n\n- American Wagyu Flank Steak ($29): With Beet spatzle, horseradish-chermoula, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. Super savory and tender. Another dish where I wish the portion size was bigger, but it was so so good! The steak was perfectly tender and quite savory. \n\n- Grasshopper dessert with chocolate lava, mint, and pretzel toffee ($9): I'm not normally a dessert person, but this was quite refreshing. The pretzel toffee was a nice addition.\n\nThe thing I like most about dessert at Stones Throw though is that they really encourage you to \"participate\" in creating their dessert menu. You have the option of writing own your favorite childhood dessert, and if they pick your selection as their inspiration for a new dessert, then you're invited back to Stones Throw to try the dessert creation for free!\n\nAmbiance was great, server was wonderful.

I can't even begin to describe how amazing the food to the service to the decor is.\n\nI've had the pleasure of dining here twice. Once because my friend is related to the head chef, the second time with my co-workers as a holiday celebration. Both times were marvelous.\n\nYou know the food is good when everyone's plate is wiped clean just moments after appetizers are placed on the table. The Duck Pate & Mousse, clearly the winner that we had to get another order. This was a light sweet and savory dish with complimenting soft pretzel. I felt like the mustard seeds added a great crunch. The Puffed Potato & Eggs and Crispy Soft Shell Crab were marvelous as well. The Braised Tomato with Bread was ok in comparison.\n\nOn to main courses. The Squid Ink Pasta is definitely my favorite go to!\n\nFor drinks I got the Pineapple Express, a delicious cocktail that makes you question whether it has any alcohol at all.\n\nDefinitely would come back.", "author": "Kathy L."}

Since we had a reservation, we were promptly taken to our table in the back and was served water as we waited for some of the rest of our party to arrive.\n\nOur menu was quite extensive and surely, I wish I had three hands so I could've taken photos of each dish, eat and drink with the others. \n\nSnacks: \nDuck Pate & Mousse with Cornichons and French's mustard served with soft pretzels - You can't go wrong with pate and carbs. The richness of the pate was through with the crunchy and acidic mustard. Major yum!\n\nSmoked Salmon Spread with bread - I thought the smoked salmon was great, super creamy and salmony without being too \"fishy\". It's possible. The bread was on the tougher side and definitely needed to be served with more bread as the portions left you with more spread than bread.\n\nPuffed Potato & Egg - I don't know what it is about this but it is all about comfort. The puffed potato with rich egg yolk was great with the cauliflower mousse. The chives brighten up the richness and the texture of crispy chicken skin was a great contrast to the soft texture.\n\nStarters:\nEscarole Salad with truffle pecorino and Asian pear - was a simple, yet refreshing way to start prior to starting our main dishes. Fresh, light, lovely!\n\nMains:\nCrispy-skinned trout with Celery Root and Roasted Brussels Sprouts - Probably one of my favorite dishes that came out. The trout came out perfectly cooked, lovely crispy skin, succulent flesh, and the celery root puree was smooth but rich to create a more rich and filling accompaniment to the fish.\n\nSquid Ink conchiglie pasta - I would have liked this if the sauce was a little less salty. I felt that the pasta texture was beautiful and not tough. I did not find a distinct squid ink flavor, but the color was impactful. The only downside was it was way too salty for my taste.\n\nBraised Beef Shortrib - really tender beef, comes with potato gratin. Definitely a well rounded and rich plate, but definitely satisfying.\n\nDesserts (chef's choice):\n\nPB & J Donuts - good, but not amazing. These donuts are more like beignets with the fillings of peanut butter and jelly on the side. Don't get me wrong, fried dough is delicious!\n\nTiramisu - little-cubed lady fingers soaked in espresso and alcohol (I'm guessing, rum?) topped with white chocolate twirls, dollops of coffee cream and vanilla ice cream quenelle on top.\n\nChocolate Tacos - these are a fun retro throwback, but with Stone's Throw's twist. Little chocolate tacos filled with vanilla ice cream and served with chocolate drops, toffee brittle, apple slices and jelly\n\nThe following are just a few items, I thought would be worth mentioning. Although, we had tasted a lot more, but were not entirely memorable. The only con is that although we had two of each item, it seemed a bit difficult for every person to have a bit of the dish as they were small in portion. It's understood as it is a tasting, but a little on the small side in terms of portions.\n\nService was phenomenal considering it was a full house. The servers were so attentive and informative about all the dishes. We also had a few allergy and dietary restrictions in our party and they were really great at providing dishes that everyone could eat without issue. Great little place, decent pricing for a tasting with many dishes and amazing service!", "author": "Janet N."}

They were also served in the perfect order, building upon the flavors. Cool decor and atmosphere, kind of forage-y. Good for a small group of friends or a nice date night.\n\nDishes: \n\nCrudo of steelhead trout - Light and fresh with the perfect amount of crunch and acid on top.\n\nCitrus poached shrimp - Wow! Whatever is in the butternut squash pur\u00e9e should be bottled and sold. Each layer of this dish just added more, from the soft pur\u00e9e to the crunch of the dried prosciutto. Perfect bite on the lavash. A must-order.\n\nDuck liver mousse - I never pass this up when it's on a menu and glad I didn't here either. Creamy and smooth, it was served on a cake-type base rather than with bread or crackers. The gelee on top added the perfect amount of sweetness.\n\nSquid ink pasta - Yum! I mean, creamy, salty, and acidic. The flavors don't get much better. The seafood was cooked perfectly - esp the super meaty shrimp. (Wish there was more of course!) And the pasta was al dente and hearty without being too dense. \n\nBonus dessert - pbj donuts. Somewhere between a donut, cake, and a beignet - awesome bite with the chocolates, peanut butter, and jelly all together. So light, yet so flavorful.\n\nGreat beer list! Smaller wine by the glass list. We sat at the bar, and our bartender/server was awesome! So nice and knowledgable, made sure we were taken care of and never had an empty water glass. \n\n5+ for flavor, creativity, and all around deliciousness. Pricing is interesting as some things seem nicely priced (mousse, shrimp), yet some things seemed overpriced. Can't speak for the mains. Either way, looking forward to going back. Toughest thing will be deciding whether to order the same things or try new ones.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

There's just a lot going on in all of the dishes, which make them fun to eat once but never has you craving them again.\n\nI wanted more of an intense peanut butter flavor in the PB&J donuts, all in all it was too sweet of a dish for me.

Ever since that visit, I've dreamed of coming back for the squid ink pasta, which felt like I put heaven in my mouth. I've compared every single restaurant I've been to as \"not as good,\" using ST as the ultimate standard. \n\nFast forward nearly 1.5 years now, my parents were in town visiting and I finally got my opportunity take my parents to my favorite restaurant! Clearly, this is no longer the case. Besides the shameless teeny tiny portions for the price, the service we received on our second visit was demeaning, leaving a bad taste in my mouth regardless of how the food was.\n\nOur waitress was Dawn. Dawn answered every single one of my questions with a judgmental look that made me feel very uncomfortable, and a tone of voice with choice was words that was extremely rude. For example, I asked her to explain what was the difference bet hamachi crudo and another starter. She replied, \"well hamachi is a fish, and that is not.\" ....did I look that stupid? I wanted to know how the dish was created and how they differed since the ingredients sounded similar. I tried to ask again and she was very hasty and arrogant in her tone of voice. I felt belittled and ashamed for even asking any questions. \n\nLater on during our meal, she came over and almost purposely asked if this was our first time here, if we are from here, if we live around this area. Very specific questions as if trying to point us out that we are foreign to here and don't know anything about food. Needless to say, ST is no longer my favorite restaurant! Sad since it left an epic impression the first time.", "author": "Acacia O."}

The menu isn't much more robust, until you turn to the beer list---which could almost call for one to eat the food on small plates just to work your way down to a beer you really want.  I didn't look at the wine list but asked for a nice big cab and we got two glasses of just that (I didn't even ask what it was) and a nice one too.\n\nWe started with the chicken liver pate and squid ink conchiglie and then both of us had the Bavette Steak.  I make a nice chicken liver pate at home, this was much better---the lovely muskiness of the liver but softer and quieter.  We had to ask for more bread on which to spread it as it couldn't be wasted.  The conchiglie was very good, black spirals of pasta in a dark creamy sauce with what was said to be clams, mussels and shrimp but I don't really remember any of that, just the sharp rich flavor of the clams and mussels, and the pasta.\n\nWhich brings us to the Bavette Steak, or flap meat.  Yes, another rendering of the lesser cuts of the cow which are as prevalent on menus as battleship gray is on all the buildings.  It was served with a pungent Moroccan chermoula sauce more traditionally reserved for fish and pan seared vegetables all of which came together delightfully.  \n\nWe finished with the Fudgesicle (the popsicle version apparently having been invented in San Francisco).  Oddly enough, the entire description of this dish is devoted to the history of the popsicle, and you have to go on the list of ingredients under the name: Kiwi compote; coconut jam; black sesame.  It seemed more like a mini cookie layer cake in macaron drag than anything remotely popsicle or fudgesicle, and of everything on the menu, this came closest to disappointment----had the cable car service not already taken that position.\n\nSadly, no tawny port, only ruby, and with that we finished.\n\nI'd go back although with the limited selection there isn't a lot of rush to do so.", "author": "Paul T."}

I've had it bookmarked for awhile because it was recommended to me by Emma H., and now I can see why she raved about it. A couple friends and I met for a 6:45 reservation and it didn't get crowded until around 7:30/8. One person from our party was running 20+ minutes late, but none of the staff seemed to mind which was nice. I never felt rushed.\n\nI ordered a pilsner to start and it was really good. Their beer list is extensive, as is the wine list, and I would love to come back with the hubby and order a bottle with dinner. We ended up ordering one snack (the duck pate and mouse), and one appetizer (the grilled octopus).  The former was delicious!! I've never had duck pate and was a little nervous to try it, but it basically tasted like creamy mustard because of the mustard seeds, which was amazing with the pretzels. Would definitely order this again, but I also want to try the egg puffs.  The octopus was solid and the fresh fruit on the plate complimented it well. It was super tender too. \n\nFor my main I had the gnudi and am seriously still fantasizing about it today! It was so light and fluffy and, just, perfect. My only complaint is I wish there was more. I seriously think I could have eaten two plates, and that's saying something because I typically eat like a bird. I can't see myself ordering any other entr\u00e9e next time.\n\nThe service was great and really friendly. The kitchen was a little backed up, but that's understandable since it was packed.

Bite-sized plates run $8 each, for example, with starters going for $12-18 each and entrees ranging from $25-30 each.\n\nA meaty duo of beef ribeye and braised shortrib, accompanied with Yukon Gold potatoes, charred cabbage, spring onion, and chimichurri, was quite decent, although not quite enough to satisfy an appetite I'd worked up - so I went right ahead and ordered some blackberry cobbler. The food was all certainly well-prepared and by no means bad, though.\n\nI think the real strong point of the establishment is its extensive beer and wine menus. There are at least 50 beers available, spanning many styles and crisscrossing the globe. Similarly, the wine list exceeds 50 and is somewhat more skewed towards local offerings, yet has a fair number of Old World names.\n\nIt's certainly a sophisticated venue for a date, or for an upscale meal alongside well-chosen beer or wine offerings. Not a bad place to try out if you're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I would pass\n+ Puffed Potato & Eggs: this was a really good snack. the little balls were delicious and perfect to share.\n- Chicken Liver Mousse: the mousse was good but the jam on top was way too sweet. would have preferred it with the jam on the side so we could add it ourselves if we wanted. the rye crisps were nice and our waiter gave us more without us needing to ask :)\n++ Melon & Cucumber Salad: we really liked this dish! so much that we wished we ordered two to share. super refreshing and tasty dish as a starter.\n++ Squid Ink Pasta: oh man, this dish doesn't look like much but it was SO delicious and flavorful. This is one of their signature dishes and definitely recommend.\n- Ricotta Ravioli: this dish was okay. nothing that stands out, maybe because the squid ink pasta was just that good and overshadowed it.\n-- Striped Bass: wow this main was the worst dish of the night. everyone agreed that there was an incredibly strong fishy flavor that ruined the entire dish. It was so bad that I did tell the waiter in case they were serving bad fish. They were very polite with the feedback and ended up comping us one of our desserts.\n+ Seared Wagyu: this main was good. perfectly cooked medium rare and super flavorful. \n\nWe saw other people order the burger w/ tater tots so I would try that dish next time. We asked if we could just get a side of tater tots but unfortunately they couldn't make extra so that was a bummer.\n\nDessert:\n+ Peaches & Cream: this was good! we almost licked the entire glass clean haha\n+ Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts: this was also good! it comes out like puff pastries and you dip it into the PB&J sauce on the side of the plate\n\nOverall I would recommend this place as a casual night out since reservations were easy to get and the vibe was good.

It was super good....like crazy good.\n\nCheeseburger with tater tots - the hamburger was very good, good flavor and the cheese was totally melted over the entire burger. The tots were not my favorite, and we thought they were more like hushpuppies versus tots. Maybe next time I'd substitute for a side salad? Not sure they do substitutions.\n\nHash - this was so good, two eggs on the top, over easy and the hash underneath. Very favorful, not too much potato (can't stand that), but the right amount. The meat was seasoned a little spicy, quite nice.\n\nSeating was on the tight/close side, thinking more NYC style, so the issue becomes that people are always trying to talk over everyone else. Then, it can become a general shout-fest. When exiting the bench seat, it was difficult to squeeze in between the tables, it was that close.\n\nOverall, I have to say the service was very friendly and I didn't feel rushed even though people were waiting inside and outside.

But the only restaurant I knew ahead of time was Stones Throw as a team dinner with some of the greatest humans to exist. What do you do when you are days away from eating at a place you know will be good? You look at the menu of course. I already had my eye out for things I wanted and things I was going to encourage other to order and share.\n\nUpon arrival, our menus were taken pretty quickly. Having not taken our order and finding out things had been preselected, I saw all of my hopes and dreams of culinary bliss starting to fade away. Until I realized that my boss basically got all of the deliciousness the menu had to offer. I won't be able to remember the details of everything, but I will certainly try.\n\nI was very excited about the pate. It was quite good. But as a lover of pate, I would have preferred to spread it on something that didn't cover the creamy flavor. The puff potato and egg was outstanding. I could have eaten ten of those. The other snack we had were good too... I mean there was nothing that was bad here. But these are the ones that stuck out the most to me.\n\nThe squid ink pasta was another one on my hit list and it did not disappoint. If I weren't such a big meat lover, this would have been by far my favorite. I mean it probably was still my favorite... but it just didn't win by a landslide.\n\nThe bass was very flavorful and good. But with \"crispy-skinned\" in the name, I expected to be a little more flavorful. The pork was also full of delicious flavor. But my favorite main was the ribeye and short rib. They complimented each other really well. And for having it preordered, the rareness that I look for was on point.\n\nGreat food, great service, great company = 5 stars.

Next thing I knew, they were snatching up our menus for as the organizer had pre-ordered a sampling menu. Ruh-roh Shaggy... I love a sampling menu, but I needed those items in my life too.\n\nThey brought out multiples of each dish to make sure everyone got a chance to nosh on everything. In total, I think we had thirteen different dishes with three of them being desserts. I definitely won't go into detail on everything as I can't even remember specifics about them all... it was a feast and things started to get blurry. With that many dishes, they wont all be favorites, but there was nothing I didn't care for.\n\nThe puffed potato and egg came out early and it was devoured quickly... definitely a winner among the table. As dishes came out one after the other, I became convinced that there would be no squid ink pasta and I began to sulk over my beer in defeat. Just at that moment, the pasta hit the table and I let out a sigh of relief. Everything I had built up in my head about it was true and the pasta had such a distinct flavor. It's not for everyone, but was definitely a table favorite as well. I could have definitely done another order just for myself.\n\nAfter tasting ninety percent of the menu in one sitting, I look forward to coming back for dinner and ordering on my own. You can be sure that squid ink pasta will be on the list. Other things to look forward to are the impressive beer list of which I was too full to do much sampling. I did throw a couple IPAs back though. The other thing worth noting was the service. We had a large party, and a few who didn't make it last minute.

My burger was definitely over cooked but I wasn't much in the mood to complain about it (the irony is that I spent 3 years of my life working at a burger joint, having faced the back end of complaints about patty temperatures). The salmon was also *just okay* (a recurring theme here).\n\nFor dessert, we shared the peanut butter jelly donuts. I was pleasantly surprised, the soft beignets and the pb&j really did complement each other well. I appreciate the concept of the dessert menu - upscale renditions of childhood favorites. It was fun to write my own down as an inspiration suggestion for the dessert chef. \n\nOverall, this is not a place I would choose to return to, based on the food quality alone. That, however, is barely an insult to any restaurant in SF considering the multitude of options we have here. Nevertheless, I can dig the vibe, service, drink menu, and space of the place. Worth a stop on the SF eater trail but don't have high expectations.", "author": "Liz C."}

One of the things that I tried here that I loved was the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta. It was something I haven't had before but it was worth a try! Didn't think I would be a fan of it but here I am, loving it to death! It didn't look too appetizing at first but it's delicious, unique and something I will be having again in the future.

Everyone has already written about the puffed potato and egg starter for good reason! It's so well executed and amazing! The dish I can't stop thinking about was the creamy gnudi, rich with ricotta flavor, but complimented by the butternut squash with a little crunch from the kale. We had the squid ink pasta, hamachi, braised beef short rib and the duck too, all beautifully composed, but I was sadly too stuffed to fully appreciate by then. Lastly, dessert included the adorable and tasty choco tacos, but the peanut butter and jelly donuts stole the show. I never would have ordered it, but you must!

I would recommend those three items. The duck pate was also solid but I wish it was accompanied by a different type of bread instead of a soft pretzel.

With Stones Throw, I just wanted to give an honest opinion to those that are curious or eager to try it (as we were, and I feel the glowing reviews left us very, very unsatisfied). \n\nFor starters - let's start with the positives. This is an artsy/pretty spot, nice decor and ambiance. We took a 5:45pm reservation as that's all that was  available, and again from the positive reviews, I was sure this would be a great meal and worth the ridiculously early reservation time. The drinks we ordered were creative - nothing amazing, but they had a unique flare, so in terms of ambiance and decor (and the drinks), I'd give this place a 4. \n\nFOOD. Simply put, out of the 3 dishes we ordered, we did not like any. Honest truth. We ordered the Hamachi Crudo which to our surprise (I went with my husband, we order crudo often), the fish was very very fishy/not fresh tasting at all. What? For $16 you do not even get freshly sliced crudo? It was apparent by the look and taste. Very disappointing. We are NOT the couple to send items back, but we left it untouched after trying 1 piece, and the bartender noticed we didn't touch it and sent our waiter over ( ** Really appreciated that the bartender noticed this and took care of it by telling our waiter). The waiter was kind about us not liking the dish, said he would talk to the chef, and took it off our bill. We really do appreciate that.\n\nEntrees - My husband ordered beef ($32) and I ordered Agnolotti. Apparently the $16 on the menu for agnolotti is for the appetizer portion - when asked if I wanted the appetizer or dinner size, I said the dinner size, not realizing that you are paying $25 for like 6 agnolotti (which was \"ok\") and a bunch of celery root. Really??? I was left VERY hungry still, so we had to go to another meal after this (nuts, I've never had to do that). My husband said his beef was \"just ok\" and disliked all the garnishes that came with it. I tried a bite and disliked it as well.\n\nAll in all prices are very very high for what you get, and we were  dissatisfied with our meal. We left, went to a wine bar and had to order cheese and meats as I was still starving (!). \n\nI regret the $100+ dollars we spent. Overall, no, I would not recommend this place or return again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-02", "description": "With so many top flight restaurants in SF it is difficult to find an unique place that is worth a try.  \nThe reviews and pictures of some of Stones Throw's dishes caught my eye as I was searching for a place to visit while in SF.\n\nThe parking let most places around Russian Hill is difficult and there is no valet parking.  If you can, I'd recommend taking the cable car or Uber; it'll save you 20 - 30 minutes of circling around for a parking spot.\n\nStones Throw is a casual eatery with some inventive dishes.  The service was very attentive and vibe of the patrons while hip is not pretentious.  As far as the food, it was quite decent and beautifully plated; but, it didn't really wow me as I would expect from a 4.5 start joint in SF.\n\nThe duck pate & mousse was mild in flavor and was overpowered by the mustard seeds; the pretzel was also not as moist and soft and I would like.  The Potato Puff and Egg was a very pretty dish and the soft-boiled egg in the center was a good contrast in texture; flavor was also on the mild side.\n\nThe squid ink conchiglie pasta was our favorite with bold and complex flavors with perfectly cooked handmade black shell pasta. The anh mi style pork belly indeed tasted like a deconstructed banh mi.  It was an inventive concept; I just wish the pork was a little more moist.\n\nThe duo of ribeye and short rib was quite tender.  Perhaps I am just expecting too much; but, I didn't find taste wise anything that differentiated it from the short rib dishes served in other run of the mill steak houses.  I think infusing either summer plum, winter kumquat, or any citrus to the braising process would really accentuate the flavor.\n\nThe 38 North duck breast was cooked to the perfect tenderness, which was a sign of a skilled chef.  Once again, other than the tartness of the rhubarb, there was not much texture or excitement to the flavors.\n\nAs for the desserts, the best part of the peach melba was the ice cream. The BP&J donuts was well done and was quite pleasing.\n\nAll in all, not a bad place and was reasonably priced.  I just expected a little more based on the Yelp rating.", "author": "Louis C."}

I also had an order of puffed potatoes, and I was able to try a few pieces of the kurobuta pork chop my friend ordered for himself.

I found out that same night that he was wanting to try this restaurant for some time, and he thought a \"last supper\" with the family was a good reason for an inaugural visit.\n\nAnd about that STONE being unturned, I guess in this case the STONE would be a metaphor for the menu.  My advice:  peruse the menu carefully as there are certainly many appetizing dishes to choose from.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy, yet elegant and simply decorated.  Though we were slightly early for our reservation, the host extended a warm welcome and showed our group of five to our table.\n\nSome of the group did their due diligence in researching (via Yelp) the more popular or well-known dishes.  However, their menu has many appetizers, entrees, etc. to choose from, as well as an extensive wine and spirits list.\n\nFOOD:  Thanks to some helpful recommendations via Yelp, our group chose a variety of appetizers to share, these included the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate & mousse, and the squid ink pasta.  \n\nFirstly, do order the puffed potato and eggs and the squid ink pasta.  All of the accolades from other yelpers are indeed true.  The potato and eggs are fluffy, light and delicious, while the pasta delivers bold flavors thanks to the seafood combination of calamari, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The duck pate and mousse was alright, and I'd recommend asking for more bread if needed.  \n\nMy dinner entree was the butternut squash ravioli.  It was simply divine.  Cheesey goodness is more like it actually.  Although the portion was smaller than I anticipated, the gnnochi was excellent.  The brussels sprout pesto, truffle, and sage complemented the ricotta gnudi splendidly.  In contrast, my mother ordered the trout, accompanied with brussels sprouts, celery root and beef jus.  She liked it every much, as evident by her finishing almost the entire portion.\n\nI think the entree our table was most in awe of was the burger, or \"DA BURGA\" as its aptly named on the menu.  This entree is of gargantuan proportions and is every bit as mouthwatering as it looks.....from what I was told by my two tablemates that ordered this behemoth burger.  The burger bun is equally just as thick as the meat that sits between the two pieces, which barely contained the melted cheddar cheese that slowly trickled onto the plate.  And its companion?  Not just your ordinary fries, but baked potato tator tots.  I was able to try a tator tot, and after doing so I began to doubt my original decision to order the gnnochi.  I suppose a second visit is in order on a future trip to the bay area.\n\nSWEET TREAT:  To end the meal, we all shared the peanut butter and jelly donuts.  For all my Hawaii friends and family on Yelp, this is basically the bay area's version of malasadas.  The generous portion of jelly within the donut was, of course, a fantastic combination with the peanut butter and truly brought back fond childhood memories.  A comfort food and dessert rolled into one.  \n\nSERVICE:  Outstanding.  Our server was a friendly and humorous woman who was extremely patient with our group, and took the time to answer all our questions to the best of her ability.  She kindly offered recommendations on appetizers, entrees, and cocktails.  She checked on us in a timely during the entire meal and provided excellent customer service.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  An incredible meal with wonderful friends and family.  I'll be back to try \"DA BURGA\" for sure!!  Those peanut butter and jelly donuts are awesome!", "author": "Michael C."}

I already love tater tots. Stones Throw then goes and stuffs them with baked potato toppings?! I'm in heaven! For my entree, I got the duck breast which was perfectly cooked! Crispy skin, tender meat. We all shared the puffed potato appetizer. I thought they were good, but they didn't exactly blow my mind. Maybe I needed to eat more than one to fully appreciate it?\n\nOne of my coworkers wanted the squid ink pasta, but it was listed under starters so she was afraid the portion would've been too small for a main.

Made reservations, should have mentioned that it was my birthday and arrived to celebrate that special occasion. \n\nMy group was late to the appointed time, as I expected and the hostess mentioned to me that they have a turnover time.  Both factors contributed to my dining experience mood.  It didn't help that the waitress didn't quite pair well with my taste buds on wine preference at that moment. She kept suggesting while my friend didn't have a clue.  I wanted French and smooth, clean taste while she said that French was of the opposite spectrum.  I became irritated at that point.  \n\nI was beginning to think that maybe it was anxiety.\n\nNonetheless, my party finally arrived and I got to get my munchies on.  Pate paired with my French wine, (Yes, I get what I want) was a teaser.  The pate was so minuscule and it didn't have much taste that I usually like in pate.  The Duck breast was savory and the nicely cooked Scallops, were succulent.  Ribeye was of the norm.\n\nThe Squid ink conchigile pasta was unique!  That caught my taste palate.  Finely creamy with texture and lovely ink flavor.  Decadent for the most part. \n\nContinued on with Pork ears and no desserts.

Who needs to wait two hours for brunch when places like Stones Throw exist? But seriously, it has been a long time since I actually stopped after my first bite of food at a restaurant just to marvel how good it tastes.\n\nWe started with the Puffed Potatoes and Egg with Cauliflower Mousse, Crispy Bacon. Amazing and would recommend anyone to visit Stones Throw just to try this dish. (For dinner, the bacon is actually replaced by crispy chicken skin.) The mousse is perfectly fluffy, and the flavor was not overshadowed by the bacon.\n\nOur experience with the Puffed Potatoes also made me appreciate their impressive service too. The waiter serving us at the bar was knowledgeable about the menu, and he actually described step-by-step how the potatoes were prepared when we asked! He told us about how the egg yolks are frozen, then the puffed potato is built around the egg yolk and frozen again. And when it's time to prepare the dish, five of the balls are fried, and one of them is split open as a test to make sure the rest of them are fully cooked. DANG. I need to ask my servers more often how these dishes are prepared!\n\nFor our entrees, we had the Duck Confit Hash and Spicy Tomato-Baked Eggs. The hash contained Poached Eggs, Summer Corn, Shishitos, Butter Biscuit, and Pepper Creme Fraiche. Perfect mix of flavors and textures. The pieces of cornbread on top of the hash was surprisingly my favorite part. On the second dish, eggs were baked into Creamy Polenta and Braised Pork Belly and served with a side of Avocado Toast. Also quite delicious. The polenta was not too creamy, and the sauce was not too tomato-y.\n\nAgain, the service was great. We were even asked about our food allergies after ordering our food. The decor is also gorgeous, with a giant plant thing in the middle of a restaurant that reaches up to the ceiling... and wooden boomerangs adorning the walls. Would highly recommend Stones Throw for the food, service, and overall experience. Solid five stars.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

The service is amazing. \n\nI came here a year ago for an office party and have been dreaming of the food ever since. I finally came back and everything was as perfect as I remembered.  I got the squid in pasta, pate, octopus, burger, and worms in dirt.\n\nFirst, the pate is the best thing you will ever eat. It's served with this warm pretzel bread. The pate is creamy and rich and delicious.  If I was dying tomorrow, this would be the last thing I'd want to eat. It's that good. \n\nThe squid ink pasta is the best dish I have ever eaten in my life. You cannot go wrong with this. I would be lying if I said I didn't seriously consider if it'd be appropriate to lick the bowl.  Pro tip: the squid ink pasta can be served as a full sized entree and you 10/10 want it as an entree.  You're welcome. \n\nThe octopus was phenomenal. It had a charred taste but didn't taste burnt. It was cooked perfectly not even a little chewy and overdone. \n\nThe burger... I have never seen meat that moist. It was amazing. There's this pickled carrot relish in it that really worked so well. And the sauce they served it with.. I was scared it would ruin the taste of the burger but no, like everything else it was amazing. \n\nWorms in dirt- this came with a green apple sorbet and brownies over a chocolate crumble and gelee worms.  I'm the kind of person that doesn't do sorbet- if I'm going to eat a frozen dessert I want a heavy creamy gelato.  But this sorbet changed my life. It was so refreshing I would actually crave this more than I do ice cream. \n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this place is that I will never be able to enjoy other food again because nothing would ever compare.", "author": "Ashley A."}

I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but here's the run-down:\n\nSoft pretzels + pate: the pretzels were warm and soft and the pate was deeeeelicious. Huge fan!\nSmoked fish and peas + tortilla chips: really delightful and fresh-tasting. My only wish is that there was more of it!\nCustard bread thing: I feel like a chump for not really remembering exactly what this was, but it was tasty.

A favorite amongst our table.\nFish: I had expected the skin to be a little crispier, but the fish itself was beautifully cooked and flavorful.\nSteak: PERFECTION. I could have eaten 6 plates of this.\nPB & J Beignets: Such a fun twist on dessert! The beignets were fluffy and delicious, and the pb & j sauces were lightened up and just a touch of additional sweetness.\nCherry poptart: Always fun to see homemade poptarts out at restaurants, and this had a delightful presentation.

Came here for the fancy dinner of a weekend bachelorette party in the city, and everyone had the best time. \n\nAMBIANCE:\n- Modern homey. Small and large tables available. Nice space for group in the back. \n- Open kitchen was cool where we could see the magic happen\n- Felt very young and creative, innovative\n\nSERVICE:\n- Food came out quick and seamlessly\n- Servers were very kind, and offered up perfect suggestions for a second bottle of wine to ease us through the remainder of our night\n\nFOOD: We had the $55 Prix Fixe, which was so delicious and included all of the below. \nSnacks:\n- Duck Pate & Mousse with french's mustard, cornichons, warm soft pretzel. This was amazing. It comes in the most beautiful rectangle of pate and mousse, topped with the mustard and cornichon shavings. The pretzel was soft and the perfect palate for the pate. The taste was rich, but not overwhelming. The texture was soft and buttery. Amazing.\n- Puffed Potato & Eggs with cauliflower mousse, chives, crispy chicken skin. This is one of the most famous starters from Stones Throw, and I can totally see why. Each puffed potato is filled with runny egg and flash fried (I think) leaving an incredible mix of textures in each bite. It's warm and rich.\n-Sturgeon Mousse with fried capers, dill, green apple shavings, and rye lavash. This was my favorite dish of the night! Totally unexpected, it blew me away. It wasn't fishy at all, and the texture of the mousse itself was not too thick. The flavors, with the crunchy capers and tart apple shavings, melded into perfection to bring out the exact right hints of sturgeon. I definitely snuck more than my fare share of this dish :)\n- Smoked Cheddar \"Fondue\" with Brussels Sprouts, Grilled Firebrand Bread. This dish was also delicious. I thought it was going to be normal...melted cheese, and bread (don't get me wrong, this is always a winning combo for me), but the roasted brussels sprouts and other toppings in the cheese made it inventive and unexpected. Texture is thinner than nacho cheese, almost like a coating rather than a dip.\n\nStarters: \n- Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with spicy capers, clams, calamari, shrimp, tender greens. This is another \"must have\" favorite dish of Stones Throw, and I totally can see why. The squid ink pasta is fresh and the perfect texture. The seafood mix is not overwhelming at all, and each bit was cooked to perfection -- no rubbery texture. You mix it all up at the start to get al the flavors to meld in the right way.\n- Salt Baked Beet & Fennel Salad with tempura broccolini, rye lavash, horseradish creme, lemon-dill vinaigrette. This was a lovely fall salad. There were persimmons added to ours as they're in full season right now. The beets were sweet but not overwhelming. \n- Seared Tombo Tuna with calamari, avocado, shishito Peppers, Jicama, Agua Chile. One of the most beautiful presentations of food, the tuna is tender and cooked for the exact right amount. It falls apart at the touch of your fork. The agua chile is light, but still flavorful, and is the perfect accompaniment to the fresh seafood and avocados. The shishito peppers are seared, which adds a great smokiness to the dish.\n\nMains:\n- Olive-oil Poached Salmon with Parsnip-Clam 'Chowder', Fall Root Vegetables, Crispy Salmon Skin. This was a delight as well. The perfect bite-sized portion of salmon, it was crispy skin and tender fish. The chowder was a nice base for the fish, adding a simple layer of moisture.\n- Roasted Berkshire Pork Loin with White Bean Cassoulet, Crispy Pig's Ears, Ham Hock Jus. This was my least favorite of the dishes in the tasting menu. It was tender, but there wasn't as much flavor as I would have liked from a pork loin. That said, it was still good.\n- Duo of beef ribeye and braised shortrib with Potato Pave, Creamed Kale, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Summer Truffle. This was my second favorite dish of the night. The beef was so juicy and tender, and was cooked perfectly. Again, all the flavors were a perfect harmony in each bite. \n\nDesserts:\n- Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts - this is their traditional American staple dessert, done fancy. Instead of donuts, there are fresh-fried beignets with real sugar instead of powdered. The peanut butter has real toasted peanuts and the grape jelly is smeared on the plate for dipping.\n-Toasted marshmallow, rice krispy treats, yuzu sorbet, pickled persimmons - a nice light dessert.\n- Quince gummy worms in dirt with green apple sorbet and fresh pomegranate seeds. Very rich and chocolatey. \n\nI would HIGHLY recommend the prix fixe meal for any group dining. It included so much of their amazing menu for such an affordable price. Food is timed well and executed to perfection. And there is SO MUCH FOOD. Portions are generous and everyone left food-coma full. We actually went back to our airBnB and took a 2 hour nap before going out for the night, because we were that stuffed! Great food, great atmosphere, great value!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

It proudly serves up Californian fusion cuisine in a creative and thoughtful manner in Russian Hill that attracts youngish, well to do diners. \n\nContradiction is intended. \n\nIn San Francisco, in particular, restaurants that serve high quality food are aplenty. It's very competitive, mind you, and if they were located elsewhere, say the middle of the America, everyone of them would simply rock your world, it's top notch. Plus Californian cuisine has that signature Asian influence or localvore micro greens element. It was coined by Alice Waters years ago, and it has taken the country by a storm via a food revolution ever since. Now everyone and their grandma are duplicating that success recipe. And I do mean EVERYONE: from Bangalore to Bali to Bergen to Santorini to Malaga to Berlin to Stockholm to Paris to Nice and London, and anything and everything in between.\n\nBut, you are in San Francisco, you kind of expect every meal to taste like this - Yes like you would expect in many parts of France. The standard is high. And therefore, by that standard, this food is  serviceable, but it's not unique. It's your typical bistro setting that serves up high quality Californian cuisine. Put a positive spin on it, it's a quintessential San Francisco experience. A great meal in a great neighborhood with spotless service. You can look out to the cable car, and hold the gaze of your lover, who lives in this neck of woods.  Since the beginning of the time (so you think), he's been madly in love with you, and you him. And tonight being a date night, you two shall gather in this familiar neighborhood and enjoy a nice meal, with wine to boot. That's what real, rare, therapist-approved, once a life time romance is all about. And how else can you express such love without the backdrop of one such restaurant? \n\nCue the watercolor painting: a fanciful, albeit understated meal (by San Franciscan standard), good wine, great companion, fantastic weather (again by San Francisco standard), the bell rings as the cable car approaches to a stop, and the fog horn is sounding, ever so faintly - the fog is about to roll in. \n\nDuck pate is good. Fish is always a winner. So is the duck. Order the Pinot.\n\nThink: when did San Francisco become Paris? If not in every aesthetics and every aspect, certainly in price.  And would this average bill of $120, dinner for 2 tab go up or down in the next five years? And should one feel guilty about it for having enjoyed, yet another, one such meal?\n\nDon't think.

I was a bit disappointed that they don't have hot chocolate. They only offer coffee, tea, and a bunch of alcoholic beverages. I would highly recommend them adding hot chocolate since people come here for brunch during the weekend and they have a section in their menu dedicated for sweet food items.\n\nPUFFED POTATO & EGGS ($8)\nCauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy\u00a0Chicken Skin\nThis was really good. Loved the combination of all of the ingredients. \n\nCINNAMON-SPICED MONKEY BREAD ($14)\nBananas, Caramel, Cream Cheese Frosting, Toasted Pecans\nI ordered this dish. So sweet! The bread was soft but the outside part was crispy.\n\nDUCK CONFIT HASH\u00a0($17)\nPoached Eggs, Butternut Squash, Brussels Sprouts, Toasted Foccacia\nMy boyfriend ordered this dish. I'm a fan of duck so this dish was really good. Everything was perfect. The ingredients went well together. \n\nI will definitely come here again for dinner next time. I hope they'll have hot chocolate added in their menu for brunch.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Ordered the squid ink pasta, potato egg puffs (so typical), short ribs, and scallops. Not only is the presentation beautiful, but the food is a time bomb in your mouth. When you bite into the potato puffs, you have to wait for a while for the cheesy egginess to sink into your tongue. I licked some of the sauce that came with the scallops off my fork, and it literally took a few seconds before I tasted the zing. \n\nThe service goes above and beyond. They left me a sweet handwritten birthday card, and I got to blow out candles on this adorable mini version of their peanut butter and jelly donuts dessert. Also, someone came by to wipe down our tables and replace cutlery after every dish. Our water glasses got filled before we even noticed they were empty. Bottomless water! Woohoo! Doesn't take magic to make it happen!\n\nI loved all the food, especially the potato puffs. I wish I could've had them all for myself! The squid ink pasta was a little on the salty side, but the sauce was interesting. The ribs were also a bit underwhelming. But the food is nevertheless delicious, and I've really only experienced this kind of service in a few places. A fun and colorful experience!", "author": "Sophie W."}

The octopus was great, grilled to perfection and so tender, this is an easy one to screw up.  The burger was juicy and very well done, could have had fries on the side instead of the tater tots though.  The ravioli was tender, yummy and rich.  The waiter asked if I liked them, loved them but it was too much for me. \n\nI'd love to have a few more things on the menu to choose from, maybe a foie would be great too and some veggies to mix things up.", "author": "Inga W."}

My order went as follows: \n\n1) Oysters-very fresh and such a great way to clean the palate. \n\n2) Summer cup drink- very refreshing and you can taste the jalape\u00f1o!\n\n3) Potato Balls- Such a yummy starter. Not sure how they get the yolk in there but it's so good! Especially with the cauliflower. \n\n4) Summer squash salad- not great, not something I'd order again.  The portion was pretty small even though it was a starter and it didn't stand out in flavor. \n\n5) Squid Ink Pasta- MY FAVORITE PART of the meal! This was everything and more. Really great flavor, the seafood (shrimp, squid) was not dry either and the only complaint is that the portion is too small for its greatness. \n\n6) Roasted duck breast- Very heavy but tender! The skin was crispy and the duck was cooked well. There was a small \"duck tamale\" in between which caught me by surprise. \n\n7) Peanut butter jelly donuts- Not bad, basically beignets with jelly and peanut butter dabs on the plate for you to dip. I could've done with just the beignets and ice cream. \n\nWill be back but probably not soon. The bill for everything listed above plus one more drink was about $198.

Potato puff - must. get. this. I could eat 10 of these (each app comes with 4 spread out over cauliflower mousse with bacon and chive shavings). It comes with runny egg yolk (which they actually make by combining with gelatin and freezing, and flash frying it for a few seconds) and is coated with some chicken skin crust. \n2. Donuts - such a lovely sweet treat that does not break the calorie bank. Seasonal so I've had some different ones each time.\n3. Duck confit hash - brunch only I believe. So delicious. In my opinion the best thing on the brunch menu.\n4. Squid ink spaghettini - Save yourself (and your party) the agony of only ordering one of these and having to share. Get your own! so so so so worth it. \n5. Pork belly - All the pork entrees I've had here have been phenomenal.

Not gonna lie to you, the dessert was my favorite part (this is nothing new if you follow my reviews and know about my intense sweet tooth!). Anywho, everyone seemed to be very impressed by all the food offerings. Service was solid throughout the entire meal. They even brought separate meat plates (that were cooked longer) out to our pregnant coworker so she could enjoy them too! I'd say the standouts were the donuts, pop tart, puffed potatoes, and chips and dip.

My girlfriend enjoyed the p\u00e2t\u00e9 more than I (she likes mustard more than I). But we both enjoyed the puffed potato, especially the cauliflower mousse that they were on top off.  \nNext we had the squid ink conchiglie pasta and the charred Spanish octopus.  The octopus was seared nicely without having that burnt flavor and it was still tender. The squid ink pasta was the best meal of the night!  We enjoyed it so much we ordered it again!  The pasta was al dente. The sauce had enough seafood and greens to complete the dish. It had a nice spicy kick to it as well. \nFor our main, we shared the pan-roasted steelhead trout.

They also give you 5% off if you take an Uber to the restaurant instead of driving since it's really difficult to find a parking space around there. I thought that was really considerate of them. Although 5% isn't a lot but it's enough to incentivize you to not bring your car. \n\nAs for the food - my favorites were the oysters (very garlicy sauce...love garlic!), potato and eggs (has some sour cream and onion in the sauce, the dish gave me an orgasm in my mouth), soft shell crab (also a perfect combo of crunchiness and smoothness of the avocado), and the key lime pie was to die for. \n\nMy only complaint about the place is that food isn't served efficiently. Between appetizer and small bites we had a wait of 15-20 min, and between small bites and entree was another 30-40.

The focus is on snacks and small plates, which are meant to be shared amongst good company. I love that concept because more effort is placed into the flavor of smaller bites. \n\nThere's a couple snacks and starters that are musts in my opinion. The puffed potato & eggs is exactly as it sounds - masterfully created runny egg within a puffed potato ball; its creation is still a mystery to me. My favorite dish of the night was actually the squid ink conchiglie pasta. From afar, the pasta looks like cockroaches, but don't let its appearance fool you. This seafood medley of clams, shrimp, and squid ink with spicy capers make for a delicious appetizer.  \n\nOther notable plates were the duck pate & mousse and the grilled octopus. The pretzels went great with the pate/mousse and I loved the meaty tenderness of the octopus. For mains, we split the burger, which was satisfying enough. Bonus points for bacon tator tots. \n\nDessert is done a little bit differently. Stones Throw invites guests for their input on their favorite childhood treats and puts a spin on that. We tried the peanut butter & jelly donuts. This deconstructed dessert combined beignets with Nutella, crushed peanuts, and Concord grape jelly.

The little pretzel buns it came with were warm, toasty and buttery and were the perfect vehicle for the spread.\nSausage Stuffed Quail - Quail was lean, juicy, not gamey at all and the barbecue rub was tasty. The melon and mint squares it was garnished were an interesting fresh compliment to the quail.\nCorn Soup - Velvety and sweet soup, rich but doesn't feel heavy in your stomach.\n\nOverall, it was a solid offering and slightly impressed at the subtle inventiveness of some of the dishes (3.5 rounded up for ambiance and service), but I expected more of the food because of how everyone raves about it.

Service was outstanding and food was impeccably creative. What makes this restaurant truly special is how all the decorative flares and sauces are added to each dish and makes it 3x better than having just the main feature of each item. The chef is so talented. \n\nLike a good Yelper, I searched up the most reviewed items and ordered the potato puffs and the squid ink pasta for starters. The potato puffs were heavenly -- half cooked watery egg yolk inside a potato puff! How do they do that! And the chicken bits and cauliflower pur\u00e9e around it made it even more excellent. This item lived up to the Yelp hype.  \n\nThe squid ink pasta for me was not as impressive as the potato puffs (though my boyfriend disagrees. He loved both.) The taste was definitely very unique, there were shrimp and squid pieces and some kind of homemade light sauce. There was some kind of pepper and that gave it a nice kick.\n\nWe shared the ribeye and braised short ribs as one of our entrees. The short ribs were AMAZING. Definitely my favorite! super tender, could eat with a spoon because the meat comes apart so easily. Side flares: small croquettes and fava bean mash. Get this!!\n\nWe also shared the duck breast that came with a tamale and the side flares were sweet corn and a few cherries. Duck was cooked medium rare and was also very tender. The chef definitely knows how to do meat! The only negative thing I can say about the restaurant was that I didn't like the tamale, I don't think it went with the duck that well. \n\nThe dessert part is cool -- they ask all customers to write down their favorite childhood dessert and that's how they make their dessert menu. If your item is selected they invite you to come back and try your dessert on the house! What a cute idea! We didn't order a dessert but since it was my boyfriend's birthday they gave us a free mini sized dessert -- peanut butter and jelly donut holes. It was okay, I personally wouldn't order the full size but I could see other people loving this dessert. \n\nAs if it wasn't apparent enough I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion, especially birthdays!

The service is Michelin-level quality; the staff are indeed genuine and caring and not over the top. The ambiance was great and there were many good tables. The food was excellent, but I may have mis-ordered a couple of dishes. I heard the menus are in a constant state of evolution for many dishes, so I definitely plan to return to try the more Mediterranean side of the menu rather than the comfort-food side, aka, more seafood, less fried stuff.", "author": "Brian J."}

The food selection was simple and straightforward while the drink selection was widely diverse. He went with the pizza port and I with a dessert wine to start the dinner. Upon seating, there was a card on the table which I thought was super sweet!\n\nThanks to our fellow Yelpers, we went with the puffed potato and eggs and squid ink pasta for starters and had no regrets. The former had an amazing texture and the flavors exploded in your mouth when you piece the dish together. The squid ink pasta is to die for - it's a must! The seafood flavor developed in the pasta is divine and so fresh. My BF and I agreed that we would order an entree side of this if we can.\n\nFor entrees, we went with the duck breast and ribeye / shortrib duo. Duck was cooked great and served on top of a bed of grains and ribeye / shortrib duo was tasty but for us, the highlight of the meal was the squid ink pasta hands down. We ended our dinner with complimentary pb&j beignets which was portioned so small we were craving more.\n\nWe walked here but I assume the parking situation is tough around the area.

When one of those friends was raving about his recent visit to Stones Throw I knew I had to check it out ASAP. My sister and I booked a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night, we were really surprised that there were reservations available just an hour before showing up! We were seated right when we walked through the door. The restaurant was dimly lit but still very casual with a small bar area with stools by the window.\n\nWe got a few items to share... \n\n[1] Puffed Potato & Egg - runny egg yolk within a creamy semi-mashed potato ball with a crispy chicken skin served with cauliflower mousse and chives. For a dish you would expect to be extremely heavy, it was surprisingly light and the perfect way to start off the meal. \n\n[2] Duck Pate & Mousse - the duck pate was very rich and light, served with french mustard and cornichons (sour French pickles) and two freshly baked pretzel rolls.\n\n[3] Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta - looked like conch shaped pasta with capers, clams, calamari, shrimp, and greens. This was one of my favorite dishes of the evening. The pasta had a great texture and good flavor.\n\n[4] Da Burga - Stones Throw house burger with cheddar cheese atop a beef patty with a brioche bun served with cheesy baked potato tater tots. The tater tots were bomb. com and the burger was pretty finger-licking good too. \n\nThey have a pretty substantial list of bottled beers with lots of imports and there is a solid wine list as well. The service was fantastic, attentive but not too attentive where it's annoying. They do a little fun game with the dessert menu where you note what your favorite childhood dessert was and the chef will choose the suggestion he likes, puts a spin on it, and adds it to the menu.

I will never bitch about duck, (unless you overcook it), but this was really nice.\n\nWe didn't have enough room for a full dessert which was disappointing, but they took care of us with a super small portion of one of their popular items, a take on PB and J donuts.

I have been waiting to come here for a while and the food and service did not disappoint.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entrees to share for the table. The apps were the eggs and potatoes and the pork belly. The eggs and potato is one of their signature dishes and it wowed. I'm still trying to figure out how they get egg yokes in the fried potato ball. My money is on them freezing the egg yoke and then encasing it in the potatoes before frying the little suckers. The puree of cauliflower perfectly complemented the subtle sweetness of the potatoes. Definitely order it!\n\nThe pork belly was also great. It was soft and you can actually taste the pork. It didn't taste oily or fatty, either. It was artfully presented and oh so yummy.\n\nMy entree was the duck. The heirloom carrots that came with it was almost as good as the duck. I ordered the dish medium rare and the chef delivered. It was almost slightly undercooked and a bit stringy. I also wish they crisped up the skin a bit more. The sauce was great, though.\n\nI also tried a bite of my friend's rib eye and it had intense flavor.

I tried just about everything on the menu and I kept exclaiming that it was the best thing I've ever had my life. Standouts were the truffled beef tartar, I don't know how they got such rich meaty flavor in raw meat, I think it was tossed in a jus which was incredible. The \"fully loaded tots\" we're a heavenly fried potato croquette sitting in an aioli which short rib all over the top. Just stop it! Amazing. The puffed potato and egg was awesome, it's one of their signature dishes and it's clear why, the potato ball is somehow crispy on the outside and fluffy and silky on the inside with so much flavor. The Duck Pate & Mousse tartine with grainy mustard and cornichons served with  warm soft pretzels...I can't get it out of my mind. The server brought more pretzels when we ran out without us even asking, but the dish didn't even need the pretzel! The pretzel was amazing though, don't get me wrong. One of my very very favorites was the Yellowtail & Scallop Ceviche with shrimp and coconut and jalape\u00f1os, it was tropical tasting and gorgeous. My favorite dish of the night was the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta\nwith spicy capers, clams, calamari, shrimp and some sort of greens, maybe pea shoots.  Uh-maze-ing. Silky, intense, fresh, beautiful. If I could eat a big bowl of that, I could die and be totally satisfied. The duck breast is awesome but the standout was the ribeye. The meat was perfectly cooked, I cut into it with a fork. But that bed of black rice man. Oh man. I don't know if it was just the juice from the meat or if they added additional jus but it was just incredible. We got three different desserts: some peanut and jelly donuts, deconstructed pineapple upside down cake, and a deconstructed German chocolate cake.

When the egg mixes with the Cauliflower its paradise. 5 Stars!\n\nSteak: The Tamarind Glazed Beef Ribeye wins the highlight of the night for me.

I already heard great things about them from fellow yelper reviews, so when I saw that they had a booth at the 2014 San Francisco Street Food Festival, it was a perfect opportunity to try their famous Puffed Potato & Egg (http://bit.ly/1mVorYv).  Luckily for me, they didn't have a line and after that first bite of their Puffed Potato & Egg, I was hooked and went back and ordered it again at least twice that day.  It was so good!  And with that, I knew I wanted to give their restaurant a try.  The timing for it was actually perfect since I took a huge gamble and decided to try Stones Throw as the venue for Janice C.'s birthday brunch party for a group of 15 folks.\n\nBefore we get to the food, first off, I want to say that communication was really great with Tai Ricci and their staff to help plan for the event.  Even though I had to call them several times to change the head count, they were very patient and accommodating.  Amazing customer service!  Like what all past reviews have stated, get a reservation!!  Even though we had one, the place got packed just a short while after opening.\n\nWhat was great about having a big group was that aside from their oysters and burger, we basically got to try the whole brunch menu in family style form.  Not a bad deal for $25 per guest (for groups of 8 or more it's the minimum before drinks, tax, and gratuity).\n\nFood Gallery:\n\nSmoked Salmon Mousse --  http://bit.ly/XjHVzM\nMilk Jam, Strawberry Compote, Balsamic\n\nVanilla-Sugar Doughnuts --  http://bit.ly/1D8jBSj\nBagel Chips, Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, Scallions\n\nPuffed Potato & Egg --  http://bit.ly/1D8jHZX\nCauliflower Mousse, Crispy Bacon\n\nButter-Fried Pancake --  http://bit.ly/1D8jK87\nEuropean-Style Butter, Vermont Maple Syrup\n\nBrioche Pain Perdu --  http://bit.ly/XjIyt1\nYellow Peaches, Vanilla Cream, Salted Almonds\n\nBrown Butter Crepes --  http://bit.ly/1D8jQwH\nNutella, Banana, Mascarpone, Shaved Hazelnuts\n\nBrokaw Avocado & Burrata Salad --  http://bit.ly/XjIJEF\nLa Quercia Prosciutto, Sungold Tomatos, Serpent Cucumbers\n\nRolled Chino Valley Farms Omelette --  http://bit.ly/XjIPMA\nOven-Dried Tomato, Button Mushroom, Herbed Goat Cheese, Brioche Crumble\n\nRoasted Corn & Duck Confit Hash --  http://bit.ly/XjIWYo\nPoached Eggs, Jimmy Nardello Peppers, Red Onion, Corn Bread\n\nIn all essence, everything we had was delicious and plated very nicely despite being served family style.  I think the favorites around the table were definitely the Smoked Salmon Mousse, Puffed Potato & Egg, the Avocado & Burrata Salad, and the Roasted Corn & Duck Confit Hash.\n\nI think the experience might have been a lot different with a small group since we probably would've ended up only trying a few menu items.  So to be able to try all that food for a low nominal price was quite a deal!\n\nSo in the end I'm really glad things went well.  The food was great and everyone had a great time, especially the birthday celebrant!  If you plan to have a big dinner or brunch party, I highly recommend Stones Throw!  I'm pretty sure I'll be returning for another brunch or to try them for dinner in the near future.  Gotta love that Puffed Potato & Egg!", "author": "Rodney H."}

I'm blessed, I'm loved, and I'm truly thankful. \n\nStones Throw never cease to amaze me with their simplistic menu, making it easy to order. Go heavy on the appetizer and do share to maximize your tasting experience. Here is why:\n\n1) You must get the PUFFED POTATO & EGGS. I'm telling you, it is that GOOD!!!\n\n2) Squid ink conchigile pasta to share is the way to go. \n\n3) Warm pork belly & crispy pig's ears. why not? Get in my tummy...\n\n4) Crispy Liberty Duck breast & rillette \"taquito\".  By now, you all should know how much I love duck meat. Do I not emphasize it enough on my profile?!?! Anyway, this dish is UH-AMAZING!!!\n\n5) Stone Fruit Clafoutis is hands down the most memorable dessert for this month. Something about the fresh fruits suspended in a thick waffle-like batter that make it so delectably tasty. Love. Love. Love.\n\n6) An extensive beer list that will get you to drinking for 2, 3,  or 4.... Beer me! Don't forget their great vino as well. \n\nOutstanding food. Attentive staff. Low-key vibe.

We parked about 2 blocks away. Yes, we had to walk uphill, but I expected worse (and an uber was ready to be called just in case). \n\nWe were about 15 min early for our reservation, but were promptly seated as soon as we arrived. We started with a lovely bottle of white wine recommended by the server, since the bottle we originally wanted was no longer available. Womp. But it was a\ngreat recommendation. \n\nBefore going to stones throw, I already knew what I was going to order based on the yelp reviews. We ordered the duck pate, potato puffs, and squid ink pasta to start. DELISHHHHH. The duck pate was incredibly rich and decadent, which paired perfect with the warm pretzel rolls. The potato puffs were little balls of fried heaven. And the squid ink pasta was a delight! Bf was thrown off by the caper taste, but still enjoyed it. \n\nI ordered the duck breast for an entree and bf ordered burger cooked medium well. Unfortunately, the burger came out more rare than medium, but he insisted that it was fine and ate the entire thing. Bf was incredibly apprehensive of being full after dining here. He's made it a point that all \"nice restaurants\" will leave him still hungry after the meal, due to their small portions and high price tags. But that burger was a good size portion that even he was stuffed! Recommended for those looking for more of a \"bang\" for their buck!\n\nI was able to snag a bite of the stuffed tator tots which I'm sure went along beautifully with the burger. The duck exceeded my expectations! I loved the sauce that came along side it \n\nFor dessert, we decided on the bananas foster. Please get this!! It was a party in my mouth. And the fact that it's a frozen banana milk shake INSIDE the chocolate dessert. How cool is that?! \n\nService was great! Super attentive and friendly.", "author": "Noelle H."}

I didn't realize it was a wine and beer only kind of restaurant, but it turned out to be a nice constraint. The food was amazing.\n\nWe started with the puffed potato and eggs, which were delicious, and I could have eaten three more orders of. Pro tip for the mixed marriages out there: my wife asked them to put the crispy chicken skin on the side (because she's a vegetarian), so I got a double-dose of that crunchy goodness.\n\nFor my proper appetizer, I had the grilled octopus with chorizo and white beans, which was truly excellent. The octopus was extremely tender, and all of the flavors were delicious together. For my main course, I had the duck breast with polenta and turnips. The duck was cooked perfectly, and was also very tender.\n\nIf there was a misstep in our evening, it was dessert. We ordered the pineapple upside-down cake, which ended up being the chef's re-interpretation of this (and other) classic desserts. A deconstructed cake is probably not worth calling a cake if it's broken up and strewn across the plate in various states of matter. I won't dwell on it because we also ordered a hard root beer to go with our dessert, and that ended up being one of the highlights of our night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-16", "description": "REVIEW #399--which is just a Stone's Throw away from #400 so I guess it counts as a special number for this special restaurant :)\n\nDespite my (under construction) facade as an elitist foodie, a $$$ restaurant still always scares me.  However, Stones Throw hits the right balance of sophisticated delicacies vs classic comfort food, with strikingly unique presentation that does not stray to the abstract and the bizarre.\n\nBecause the small dishes seemed to be the highlights, we ate tapas style without getting main courses, so it was uber fancy bar food that totaled to fancy restaurant prices.  Just like the majority of SF urbanites, we went by Yelp recommended items (and what looked good in photos) along with a dash of adventure, though I was not bold enough to try the pig ears.  Unfortunately they were out of the famous duck pate and mousse (if your objective is Instagram likes, this is a must), so this is what we ordered:\n\nPUFFED POTATO & EGGS, $8 (Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin): Imagine the renowned potato puffs from Gregoire's at Berkeley (If you don't know what I'm talking about, imagine creamy mashed potatoes with a golden crispy coating), with hearty and savory cauliflower flavors, a surprise runny yolk hidden inside, and  a bed of crispy chicken skin, marginally like your childhood happiness with KFC except better and fancier.  It's a bit of a hodgepodge and almost looks like something sitting on confetti, but in the combination of guilty pleasures synergistically promotes this musing into an acceptable high-end small dish.\n\nCLH SHRIMP COCKTAIL, $8 (Horseradish Panna Cotta, Tomato Water, Shaved Celery): Our waitress recommended this to replace the missing duck pate, and though it wasn't bad, I liked the other dishes more.  Perhaps because of my Asian upbringing, I was unimpressed with the neon-colored shrimp chips on the side; I am used to seeing these in abundance scattered on top of commonplace dishes.  Otherwise, the shrimp was fairly good and the horseradish panna cotta turned out to be the highlight.\n\nSQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA, $15 (Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens): I used to avoid squid ink for fear that it would stain my mouth black... but I jumped on the bandwagon and although I still can't pin down exactly what squid ink tastes like, it's pretty tasty, especially in slippery spinny congliglie pasta texture.  The white foamy blobs are some kind of wine sauce, much fancy and went well with the rest of the dish.\n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS & OKONOMIYAKI PANCAKE, $16 (Bacon Dashi, Spicy Turnips, Marinated Mushrooms): If you're a purist for authentic okonomiyaki, the pancake here may not be ideal; however, the grilled octopus is sensationally delicious.  Also, the presentation is unsurpassed--if you apply the right filters you can troll your friends into thinking it's $$$$ fine dining.\n\nSTONE FRUIT CLAFOUTIS, $8 (currently not on the seasonal menu): Please don't ask about the pronunciation of clafoutis, because we had no clue and neither did the server.  Regardless, I would highly recommend this dessert if it is available.  Many other of their desserts are renditions of childhood favorites.  Although I appreciate their effort in reaching out to customers and surveying their childhood desserts, there is only so far you can go, plus there is always Candybar if you want fancy spins on PB&J.  I like the clafoutis because it was novel and different, light but satisfying.  It also came out looking very artistic, though not as minimalist as I had expected (which is a good thing... less minimalist = more edible food).\n\nWith the exception of frustrating street parking in the area despite our reservation being a bit later (8:30 on Saturday), the dining experience overall was positive and memorable.  Our server was genuinely one of the most agreeable and attentive, and the ambiance was chic with subtle but noticeable touches of stoneware.", "author": "Edna C."}

The foie gras shavings basically melted into the beef tartare, making it super creamy and delicious.

The host was very nice and said they would do something for him. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were a bit early, so the host handed us a menu to get started with some drinks at the bar area. We ordered some wine and waited. About fifteen minutes after our reservation time, the host apologized for the wait and offered us a couple glasses of champagne to celebrate my bf's birthday. We obliged and 30 minutes later, we were seated and greeted with the duck pate appetizer right as we sat down! Even though they were running behind on their tables, the service was excellent and more than made up for the extra wait.\n\nFood: After doing our research on Yelp, we ordered the squid ink pasta and puffed potato & eggs to start, in addition to the duck pate. The squid ink pasta was very unique. It was infused with the seafood, so if you're not a fan of seafood, don't order it. Otherwise, get this and prepared to be amazed. The puffed potato & egg was really good. It almost reminded me of hash browns because of the crispy exterior, but the interior was soft and gooey. The duck pate was also quite tasty. The smallest addition of the mustard seeds made this dish amazing and the pretzel rolls are nice and soft. For our entrees, my bf ordered the duo of beef ribeye and braised short rib, which was nice and tender. I ordered the fish special with fresh veggies, which was also delicious. For dessert, we shared the PB&J donuts which were a great way to round out a great dinner.\n\nCost: This is definitely a special occasions restaurant, but it's totally worth it. \n\nThe service was excellent, the food was unique and delicious, and their beverage selection is impressive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-25", "description": "First thoughts when I walked in was that this was a pretty unique restaurant. There's a bar near the entrance of the restaurant and a tall table for people to stand around, grab a drink, and have a good time. The remaining part of the restaurant had a simple layout; tables that are kind of close to one another (which means that space is limited) and open kitchen (almost as if the chefs are cooking right in front of you). \n\nAs for the menu, our waitress told us that the reason for the small menu is due to the constant changes and additions that they want to add. However, there are still dishes that have been on the menu since the first day they opened. With that being said, we were surprised by their extensive alcohol menu, which was 2 pages long. \n\nThe food was overall incredibly delicious and worth trying. I'm not particularly a big fan of New American cuisine, but some of the dishes that were brought out; deconstructed pork belly banh mi, puffed potato and eggs, yellowtail and shrimp ceviche, duck pate and mousse, and 38 north duck breast .\n\nThe pork belly was cooked perfectly- just the right amount of crisp while maintaining that juiciness from the fat. When paired with the sauces and baguette, all the flavors just come together and what seems as a simple dish, becomes a sensation in your mouth.\n\nThe puffed potato and eggs melted in your mouth, but for me, I was unable to taste much of the crispy chicken skin. \n\nI would highly recommend to start off your meal with the yellowtail and shrimp ceviche because it'll be a refreshing teaser before you begin your meal. It's light, fun, and the yellowtail pairs very well with the acidity from the lime and is balanced by the sweetness from the coconut sauce.\n\nThe duck pate and mousse was also another unique dish for me as it was my first time trying pate. Order this if you want something a bit more heavy to start off with. Super thick and creamy and comes with two little pretzel rolls.\n\nFinally, the 38 north duck breast had only two options to be cooked, medium rare and medium. I didn't know that this was an option for bird meat at all, but the waitress told us that it couldn't be cooked well done because it would become rubbery and wouldn't taste good. Although, it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes, it is worth the recognition for the style of cooking. \n\nOverall, our experience was fantastic. We had an amazing waitress who was very helpful and demonstrated her 10 years of experience in the restaurant business exceptionally well. The food was an interesting experience for us; new flavors and the style of cooking.", "author": "Patricia N."}

Just had to throw that out there before I write anything about their food.\n\nStones Throw has become one of my new favorite restaurants in sf. The food is fun and imaginative, and the atmosphere is trendy without trying too hard.\n\nI'd say that the appetizers definitely outshine the entr\u00e9es. My favorite is the squid ink pasta appetizer. It is just absolutely delicious. The squid ink is in the pasta itself, and not the sauce, and it is topped with nice bits of clam and a flavorful foam sauce. It is sooo good. \n\nAnother good appetizer is the pork belly salad. Nice big pieces of pork belly with perfectly crisped skin. Yum.\n\nThe entrees that I've tried are a little less memorable. I've had the duck entr\u00e9e as well as a sea bass entr\u00e9e. Both were cooked perfectly, but the flavors were just less imaginative than the appetizers. Plus, the entr\u00e9es are on the more expensive side (about $30).\n\nThey do their desserts in just about the coolest way possible. They are the deconstructed versions of childhood favorites that are presented with a new and whimsical flair. For example, the pb&j donuts are beignets that come with homemade dollops of jelly and peanut sauce. Really different than a typical jelly donut, but retains its traditional flavors. My description really doesn't do their desserts justice. Just take my word on it - the desserts are really tasty and are also really fun to eat.", "author": "Rosanna K."}

Walk all the way into the restaurant to find that there is actually more room in the kitchen than the eye meets. There, you can sit and talk to each other using your \"indoor\" voice. It's such a pleasant ambiance, in my opinion, and it feels so much more relaxing and homey.\n\nAnd of course, the food! The puffed potatoes, which should be eaten in one bite or it bursts all over. These little hot pockets of creaminess are the perfect start to your meal. And then, share the squid ink pasta with the table and indulge in the strong but not too overpowering seafood taste. Succumb to more pasta as your entree, and enjoy the sinful, cheesy ricotta gnudi, ravioli and fresh cubes of butternut squash. Let's not forget about the lemon bar dessert, as you enjoy the tart creamy lemon squares and the crunch of the pistachios in the ice cream. YUM.", "author": "Julia N."}

A large group of coworkers and I took over the back area of the restaurant. We had set up a dinner with tastings of some of their greatest hits... and great they were! \n\nI think I liked pretty much everything I tasted, but here are some of the dishes that really stand out in my memory even a couple months later:\n- Crispy tomato cream wafers and a fava bean dip (a light and refreshing way to start the meal)\n- Pate and pretzel bread\n- Puffed potato and eggs (a bit rich but definitely the overall favorite)\n- Squid Ink Conchiglie pasta\n- Dungeoness crab salad\n- Seared Maine Day scallops (I think this was my favorite dish of the whole night)\n- Crispy duck breast and thigh (duck's not easy to get right in my opinion, but boy did they get this right)\n- Peanut butter and jelly donuts (a nice down to earth finish to a very gourmet meal)\n\nThere were tons of other things we tried that were also fabulous but start with those and you'll be happy, I promise. The service and cozy, romantic ambiance with great lighting are a perfect complement to the delicious food you'll eat. Go as soon as possible!!", "author": "Christina P."}

It's even better than 1760 and Verbana which I loved. TBD and Alta CA? Ummm, they don't even come close to the finesse of Stones Throw and in hindsight, I was too generous in my ratings. \n\nThe former Michael Mina chef has created a fantastically creative, New American menu that's small yet focused with 4 small bites, 5 apps and 5 entrees. \n\nI was a little concerned about the portion sizes from the earlier pics posted on Yelp but I had to doggy bag half my entree so it seems they have beefed up their portions. \n\nExpect to spend about $150 for dinner for two (including a glass of wine each, tax and tip).\n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Puffed Potato & Egg w/ Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin ($8) - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1gVqIiu\nThe most amazing first bite I've had, I'm still scratching my head as to how they got the yolk inside the crisp and fluffy potato and how it managed to stay deliciously oozy. So foodgasmic that this is an absolute must order. \n\n*Pork Belly & Crispy Pig Ear w/ Avocado, Citrus, Moresque Spice, Kale  ($14) - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1l6Zblp\nGreat textures and flavor profiles, the combo of the moist yet lean pork belly (with crispy skin), wisps of crunchy pig ears, buttery avocado, garlicky aioli, and burst of citrus worked incredibly well. Make sure to eat each component together. \n\n*\"Toad in the Hole\" Lasagna w/ Mushroom Duxelles, Asparagus, Green Garlic, Confit Egg Yolk ($22)- 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1ozv057\nI've been trying to eat less meat and I didn't miss it with this dish. The mushroom lasagna was hearty and you can never go wrong when it's topped with yolk porn. I think a drizzle of b\u00e9chamel on top would have elevated the lasagna and tied everything together. Just my two cents. \n\n*Olive-Marinated Leg of Lamb w/ Artichoke & Cucumber Panzanella Salad, Meyer Lemon, Castelvetrano Olives ($27) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/OAvwmK\nA stellar entr\u00e9e, Mr. NSS completely wiped his plate clean. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and was very tender. I usually despise olives but it was subtle enough that it seasoned the lamb well. If you're a carniwhore, get this!\n\n*Chocolate Bananas Foster w/ Chocolate Banana Shake & Warm Brownies ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/PTE2OH\nI'm not a chocolate person but Dave, our waiter sold us on this dessert with his enticing description. The picture doesn't do it justice as the brown sugar caramel soaked bananas were spooned over table-side so it altered the clean presentation. \n\nThe banana milkshake was INSIDE the brownie so it was like a lava cake except the milkshake was still cold. How did they do that?!?! Seriously impressive. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nThe staff was most excellent and everything you would want in a solid neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, attentive, and non-pretentious. Dave, our waiter made great recs and was able to get in another order of the potato puffs (yes, it was that good!) on the fly before our entrees arrived. The proactive manager, Thomas graciously took the time to check in with every single table to ensure dinner was going well. Always a nice touch.\n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nThe space has brightened up a lot from the former Luella space with the use of neutral colored tables and furnishings: http://bit.ly/1iGH6b1. There's about seating for 40 with additional seating at the bar. I appreciated that the restaurant absorbed sound well so we didn't have to scream across the table...when we did speak to each other.

The names and descriptions of each dish can be confusing and sometimes misleading; our server graciously translated menu item descriptions for us.  (don't be afraid to ask your server to do the same)\n\nWe ordered an array of small plates:\nPuffed potato and eggs-- I referred to these as \"bites of heaven\", the cauliflower mouse accompanying the puffed potato balls perfectly\n\nSquid ink conchiglie pasta--  The handmade ink-stained gnocchi-like pasta nuggets were nothing short of delightful.  The delicate pieces of clams and calamari finished this dish. \n\nFive peas in a pod--  This plate is Stones Throw's version of a salad.  This dish utilizes 5 different types of peas in diverse preparation techniques.  I was confused by the description of brioche, and therefore expected this dish to be served as a bruschetta.  Nonetheless, I was very pleased with it.  \n\nPork belly with grilled peaches--  Stone Throw slow cooks the pork belly and I certainly tasted it!  Grilled peaches and marmalade balanced the salty pork to create a lovely sweet-savory dish.  Watercress accents added just the right amount of zest.\n\nDessert:  Savory comte crepes-- This was one of the most savory desserts I've ever had; it could almost be ordered as an appetizer.  The crepe layers are very thin and smothered in creamy cheeses.  It is then sliced in very, very small portions and paired with actual slices of cheese.  (Being from Wisconsin I absolutely loved this but didn't feel as though it was \"desserty\")\n\nThe broad beer and wine menu was impressive.  I found it very amusing that the drink menu was roughly 4 times larger than the food menu.   I made a mental note to take my beer snobs here during their next visit.  I additionally noted that the menu we experienced last night is slightly different than the current menu online.  Apparently a few dishes change with the season to keep the menu fresh.  \n\nAlso, I'm very interested in the brunch menu!

Think mashed potatoes stuffed with a runny egg yolk, fried and service with fried chicken skin. How can you possibly go wrong?? \n\n-PORK BELLY & CRISPY PIG'S EAR: Avocado, Citrus, Moresque Spice, Kale ($14)\nFatty pork belly topped with crunchy fried goodness contrasted with the creamy avocado. Awesome dish, every bite was amazing.\n\n-SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA: Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens ($15)\nWho doesn't love squid ink pasta? The squid ink gives it, in additional to a cool color, a more al dente firm texture that I absolutely love. Clams and calamari give it a seafoody flavor that packs a punch!\n\n-GRILLED OCTOPUS: Chorizo, White Beans, Braised Radicchio ($16)\nPerfectly grilled. Most people don't like octopus because it's chewy and rubbery when not cooked right - not the case here. This octopus was tender and the char flavor only enhanced the octopus flavor. If you don't like the octopus here, you're not going to like it anywhere.\n\n-OLIVE-MARINATED LEG OF LAMB: Artichoke & Cucumber Panzanella Salad, Meyer Lemon, Castelvetrano Olives ($27)\nI had read that this was the real standout of the main courses and it was definitely good. Not too much lamby taste. Overall I was more a fan of the snacks and starters but it was nice to get a little more substantial dish to feed the bellies\n\n-'TOAD IN THE HOLE' LASAGNA: Mushroom Duxelles, Asparagus, Green Garlic, Confit Egg Yolk ($22)\nRaw egg? Hell yeah! The name \"lasagna\" might be a little misleading because the only thing that made it lasagny was the thin pasta on top. Lots of mushroom flavor and the raw egg gave it a luxurious creamy texture.\n\n-DUCK P\u00c2T\u00c9 & MOUSSE: French's Mustard, Cornichons, Warm Soft Pretzel ($8)\nThis was definitely good but not a super standout in my mind. The soft pretzel was an interesting way to load up on the mousse \n\nWith all these dishes and a bottle of wine our final bill for the group of 4 was just a little over $200 - not too shabby for such an amazing meal!

Their dishes can best be described as being a little fun, comforting, and totally delicious and fresh.\n\nWe started with the puffed potato and egg. The yolk center was a delicious little surprise. \n\nWe also got the panzanella. The tomatoes were perfectly sweet and ripe and even though it wasn't the most exciting dish, it was extremely well done and if you're into tomatoes, don't pass it up. \n\nFor the main entrees, we got the pork loin & grilled peaches and da burger. The flavors were more mild but worked together beautifully. I would have liked the pork loin to be a little more flavorful but appreciated that it was tender and juicy rather than dry. The burger, on the other hand, was super flavorful and I remember being blown away at how moist the meat was (IN A GOOD WAY!). The tater tots it comes with are also unreal. They are, I believe, stuffed with baked potato toppings. Super decadent and super good. \n\nWe were stuffed but couldn't pass up dessert. We got the PB & J beignets.

Proof can be seen in how packed it was when my friend Brittny and I showed up on a Thursday night.  Thank God for reservations!\n\nWe had a hard time figuring out where to stand while we were waiting for our table, and was invited to stand at their center table while we waited.  A little awkward, but hey, who doesn't like being front and center?  Once we got seated, our really friendly waiter came by and checked in with us.  It was then that we were informed about the items that were his favorites and what were the traditional picks.  After mulling over things, going through a session of girl talk, we ordered the following:\n\nAppetizers:\n-Dungeness Crab Salad\n-Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear\n\nMains:\n-Toad in the Hole Lasagna\n-Crispy 38 North Duck Breast & Thigh\n\nSo, a few things.  I'm not a huge dungeness crab person. I'm more of a shrimp girl, so ordering this dish was a risk on my part.  Pork belly, on the other hand, is usually my go-to item when I see it on a menu.  The result couldn't have been more surprising.  The crab salad really just nailed it.  That's not to say the pork belly wasn't good (loved the crispiness of that pork ear), but it paled in comparison to the crab salad.\n\nSecond item to discuss, I love duck. I love duck at fancy places (La Folie) and I love duck at casual places (1760).  And throughout my meal, I thought to myself, \"Wow. This is really great. Especially that crispy duck skin. gimme.\" And then it happened. Brittny kindly forked over a sample of the lasagna, and I knew right away one thing had happened: Eater's Remorse. My tastebuds got suckerpunched. I immediately had wished that I had gotten this, especially since it's a seasonal item and the likelihood of me having this again is somewhat unlikely. If you're around when they have this, do me a favor and order it. Kthxbye.\n\nFinally came dessert. I had managed to sneak off and tell the restaurant that my beautiful friend had just gotten engaged. Our waiter recommended to us the banana's foster, despite my friend's craving for their peanut butter & jelly beignets.  The banana's foster came accompanied with table-side serving of the super hot caramel sauce being poured over.  Amazing. And then, the beignets showed up with a nice little message that said \"Congratulations!\".\n\nOverall, I think Stone's Throw has serious potential.  If you're a beer freak, this place is for since it's beer list is long and respectable.  The food here speaks for itself, and the place really gives the neighborhood a nice cozy feel without the need to be pretentious.  I will absolutely be coming back here!", "author": "Lisa I."}

It's the poor Yelper who descends to South Park-esque pretensions of know-it-all-ness and gourmet expertise.  Best is to give an honest and productive appraisal, and to suppress the apostrophe-in-the-name complaints.  This is a very good restaurant that could still be much better with minor but resolute tweaking.\n\nVery nice ambiance.  Full stop.\n\nThe food was very good.  Both of our appetizers were excellent.  The salmon main course was fine but too little; not tiny, but too much like two tapas.  No dish in the $20s to $30s should leave my smallish guest hungry; doing so is presumptuous of a restaurateur.  The desserts are fun but a bit precious; offer one non-cloying, uncomplicated excellent item.\n\nWhile the drink menu is fantastic and extensive, it is so foolish to be out, for instance, of a draft beer without a similar replacement at 6:30 p.m. early in the week.  Think of how easy such a fix is; consider how 1995 that mistake is.  Also, do you need to be Thomas Keller to know that not every draft beer should be the latest, hoppiest, amber-est creation when you're offering seafood & other light fare?\n\nThe service is pleasant and conscientious but falls into that overwhelming San Francisco unprofessionalism:  pure good intent, but *far* too much interrupting, too much checking on how everything tastes, the classic amateurish removal of plates before one party is done, constant water filling after every sip, and way too much explanation and verbiage in delivering dishes.  Discretion.  That is the watchword of service for fine dining.  Pleasant, quick and efficient, *in the background*.  These ingredient-soliloquies should be relegated to the Young Adult section.  I was a bit embarrassed with my out-of-town guest.  Staff need to be trained differently if a $$$ restaurant wants to be a 5-star establishment.\n\nThe completely discretionary surcharge added as \"SF Mandates\" on the bill is bad.  Restaurants should stop doing this fraud.  It's purposely deceptive, shameful, and lacks integrity.\n\nHowever, in Stone's Throws defense, my beloved San Francisco also has to wisen up, become a little bit more sophisticated beyond just the food's ingredients, and respectfully urge a better overall delivery.", "author": "Steve F."}

I came here with my girlfriend tonight, wanting a special and romantic meal to mark our last day in California. We started off with the burrata appetizer with fried olives (hello, game changer!), it was the perfect size for two to share. Beautiful dish, amazing flavors and colors. We also requested something non-alcoholic, due to our ridiculously early departure the following day, and the bartender came up with something that tasted like a lemonade, a mojito and a piece of raw ginger had a love child. For our entrees my better half ordered the soup, which was creamy and crunchy and gorgeous. I went all in and ordered the lamb, and it was honestly the best lamb I have ever eaten at a restaurant. That should tell you something, coming from a Norwegian. I finished all of it, and I never ever finish anything. \n\nSomehow we managed to share the chocolate cake for dessert, and thank goodness we did, because it was heavenly. The only thing I didn't care for was the green tea I ordered, it had a funny taste to it that I didn't recognize.

I asked for bread and waiter/ faux master sommelier quipped they don't serve bread here. Pretzel bread = bread. Squid ink pasta was decent but overly seasoned. A glass of house cab was listed as $13 but was rang up as $12. Waiter was loud bc he had to speak over the decibels of others or he had a hearing problem. Table next to us ordered 2 steaks. 1 steak came split into 2 plates. So waiter combined one 1/2 with the other 1/2 to make a whole serving.

At the end of the day though, nothing blew me away to say that I would come back or to say that it's worth the money. The item I enjoyed the most was the dessert crepes. Although the main course of pork belly was tasty, something just wasn't quite right to warrant a 5 star rating. Again, maybe just my opinion. The squid pasta was also tasty, but not something I would make an effort to get again. I had the same feeling about everything on their menu. Service was excellent as expected.\n\nTo summarize Stone's Throw, everything was good and tasty, just not amazing and lacked the right combination of flavors to make it a place where I would return consistently. Oh, and no expresso?! Come on guys.\n\nReservations wise, it looks like a trend that despite making a reservations ahead of time, you will have to wait some time to get seated. Yes, they were very apologetic and nice for the 20+ minute wait, but it appears to be a trend and they need to do something fundamental to fix the issue.

Rather than getting full off of entrees, we focused a bit more on appetizers instead, ordering their:\n\n* Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta - Faaaaantastic dish, and easily our favorite part of the meal. With every bite you get massive in-your-face flavor goodness, which gets stronger the closer you get to the bottom of the bowl. If you don't make a point of stirring every now and then, it actually becomes a little too overwhelming, so, be sure to do so. The best way to describe the flavors of this dish? Pasta in a seafood chowder. But fancier.\n\n* Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear - I, admittedly, found my first two bites of this appetizer a bit boring and uninspired, until I made a point of eating the pork with a bit more sauce, and a bite of fruit, which suddenly made for this fantastic, balanced blend of contrasting flavors. As is often the case, all the ingredients are served together for a reason!\n\n* Crispy 38 North Duck Breast & Thigh - Not quite as tasty as our appetizers, especially given that we've had legit Beijing duck before, but, still enjoyable, albeit a bit salty. Could have definitely benefited from less heavy-handed saucing, or larger portions of the rice and pear.\n\n* Peanut Butter & Jelly Doughnuts - My reaction to this dessert started at wtf, and quickly shifted to resigned disappointment, as I wondered how we went from fantastic savory dishes to a lackluster dessert. To be fair, this platter of fluffy beignet doughnuts and fanciful condiments was not terrible, but, given the complexity and contrast of flavors in our previous dishes, the singularly sweet nature of this dessert fell disappointingly short.\n\nBut, despite our dinner ending on such a low note, I still have to give Stones Throw a solid 4, if not almost 4.5 stars. One of the more notable dinners I've had recently, and one I can see myself treating myself or someone special to again, if not just for that pasta dish alone.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Disregarding the excessively steep and numerous hills in the immediate vicinity of Stones Throw, which you may have to traverse depending on where you ultimately find parking, the venue itself is perfectly accessible, with a large, open floor plan.\n\nBathroom - Given how new Stones Throw is, it's not really a surprise that their restrooms were up to spec.", "author": "Johnny W."}

However, I think the ambiance created a different expectation for me. Even from their website, I was expecting rustic and simple. I love rustic and simple, but this was not that. \n\nDrinks: Huge wine selection. We got a couple bottles. Later on I did notice they had a small cocktail list but never did try any. \n\nAppetizers: Pork belly and pig ears were really good. Potato puffs were okay. Okonomiyaki and octopus were good. Squid ink pasta was REALLY good -- my fave of the night. \n\nEntrees: I got Da Burga -- pretty good, but felt like it could have been better. The tots were good. My husband got the lasagna -- umm, not what we expected... It was a different take on lasagna, which was interesting. But the portion was TINY. Even with all the appetizers we got, the portion was so tiny that he wasn't satisfied. \n\nDessert: We got Not your Grandma's Apple Pie. It was very loosely based in apple pie. It was a custard with a rolled wafer and some kind of frozen tart crystal over the top. Very different. Refreshing, and definitely not apple pie. It can throw you off if you were expecting apple pie. \n\nOverall: The style of the food (trendy) and the prices for the tiny portion sizes didn't match the ambiance for me. It would have been more appropriate for the ambiance to be closer to something like Hakkasan. I really was expecting something more rustic, traditional, simple with a twist or something.

Stones throw caught my eye with the stellar reviews, the pictures of the food, and to be honest, the name is pretty cool. The staff was definitely a plus here. The waiters and bartenders are tremendously helpful with great attitudes. They helped my boyfriend and I in selecting our cocktails and ordering. We ordered the appetizer cheddar fondue, and the much-anticipated squid ink pasta. Both dishes were delicious. Perhaps my favorite part was dessert- Stone's throw incorporates people's childhood favorite dishes into their menu, SO COOL, Right?? We had... get this... Peanut butter and Jelly doughnuts, and worms and dirt! This was the ultimate flashback. I could not believe I was at such a nice restaurant eating an elevated version of two of my childhood favorites! A+ Stones Throw!\n\n I have to say the only reason this place gets four stars is because Stone's Throw didn't particularly stand out amongst the other places my boyfriend and I visited.

We had a great server who has been at the restaurant since November 2013 when it opened and he gave us great advice on what to order.  \n\nFor starters, we had the sweet corn soup, which was light, sweet and tasted delicious, as well as the squid ink conchiglie pasta.  This was an excellent combination of flavors - including an awesome seafood flavor (there are tiny clams, shrimp and calamari), a spiciness that apparently comes from spicy capers, and perfectly al dente pasta.  For our entrees, we had the \"Da Burger\", which came in a brioche bun, with cheddar, thousand island dressing, and a side of cheesy tater tots.  We also had the Liberty Farms duck breast, which was cooked well, with black rice and just the right amount of jus.  I wasn't a big fan of the duck confit dolma, but otherwise enjoyed the dish.  We were so stuffed we couldn't even think about dessert.  \n\nThey didn't serve any hard liquor but had a number of good wines, beers, and a few cocktails.

The restaurant simply offers better items on the menu. The steak was probably the worst option of the night. We received a tiny piece of steak for the price on a bed of what was supposed to be crispy rice. When I think of crispy rice, I imagine the rice that's caked onto the side of the pot. What we got instead just felt like undercooked rice. \n\nDessert here is based around the idea of making a childhood favorite modern and classy, and the It's It we received certainly fit the bill in that respect. It was a gorgeous ice cream sandwich that our server then poured a cup of melted chocolate over. We also got a complimentary mini sized peanut butter and jelly donut dessert with congratulations written across the plate. I enjoyed both of our desserts. \n\nAll in all, this is an intimate modern restaurant with excellent service. We had some outstanding dishes and some that we'd probably pass on if we were to ever come back. It works as both a good special occasion meal, but also a nice spot to have a casual dinner with friends on a Friday night.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

It was phenomenal!\n\nThe menu is quite short (only about 12 or 15 items) but the three dishes we ordered were all very delicious. My boyfriend chose the baked eggs - they came in a lightly spiced tomato sauce. He was pleasantly surprised to realize that the sauce was full of large chunks of juicy pork belly (not pieces of tomato, as he originally thought). I ordered the duck confit hash. After one bite I was thoroughly blown away - the best dish I've eaten all year (and that includes great meals at a number of other SF restaurants). The duck was super flavorful, and complemented nicely by fresh spring peas, roasted potatoes, and an amazing herby creme fraiche sauce. The charred toast on the side was deliciously smokey and perfect to soak up the yolk of the dish's poached eggs. For dessert we shared the monkey bread - moist and cinnamony, with yummy cream cheese frosting and a strawberry rhubarb compote. A perfect sweet and sour flavor combination: quite the taste of spring. \n\nWe were equally impressed by Stones Throw's unique and innovative drink selection. My boyfriend, who works in the beer business, was intrigued by the extensive selection of beer, including a sour on tap and numerous types of hard cider. The restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, so they make vermouth and other libations in house. We ordered a pitcher of their Pimm's cup, a refreshing cocktail featuring their own juniper liquor, ginger beer, lime juice, and hibiscus. It was delicious! \n\nWe arrived at around 12:30 with no reservation, and were seated at the bar after about 10 minutes. The restaurant was crowded and quite loud when we first arrived, but started to clear out quickly - we definitely experienced the tail end of the brunch rush. The restaurant feels intimate, but also open from the high ceilings and a wall of windows. It was fun to sit at the bar, and the bartender was very congenial and accommodating. He answered all of our many questions about their drink selections, and even offered us samples of a few of their house made specialities. The rest of the staff was attentive, if a little reserved. \n\nBottom line: we definitely want to return to Stones Throw for dinner - and soon, I hope!", "author": "Hannah L."}

Drank 2 of those.. \n\nStarted w the pork belly appetizer which was delectable! Then we were surprised by Exec Chef Jason who was hosting the table next to us and he was so friendly stopped by our table and was chatting w us. We asked him for a recommendation on what to pair w the duck entree and he was excited to give us a good pair. \n\nThen sent out the duck pate/mousse starter which was absolutely amazing - paired w warm soft pretzel sticks. It was awesome.\n\nThen I decided to have the squid ink pasta appetizer and asparagus salad as an entree and my bf had the duck. The duck was huge, beautiful, crispy skin and the wild rice / duck confit on the side was incredible. \nCooked to perfection. I stole more than a few bites from him.\n\nNow my pasta was ... The best I've ever had. The shape gave it such a good texture. The sauce was out of this world and the little bites of sea food through out were so delicious. And the asparagus salad w the prosciutto and ricotta - yum. Loved all the different textures of asparagus.\n\nOk so then as I was bursting at the seams, dessert menu comes and the pb&j donuts were calling to me.... It was like homemade wonderbread bites with powdered sugar dipped in the creamiest PB and sweetest J. Dream come true. \n\nThen finally, chef Jason sends out the nilla banana something ... What better to pair w the PB ! So Ya needless to say We devoured them. The banana pudding was amazing and the crust was super flaky.\n\nThanks for one of the best dinners, Stones Throw!

For you teetotalers, there is a zero-alcohol Pimm's Cup derivative which will make you order three and you'll feel 100% sober, except slightly guilty, maybe.\n\nOn to the food - starters are amazing, don't skip the duck pat\u00e9, this was my go-to until foie became legal again.  Yes.  Foie.  Live with it.  Puffed potatoes are unstoppable, so why are you not ordering them.  Da Burga, definitely one of the best in town, it will sate the insatiable.  It has matured into perfection.\n\nChef Halverson is a pasta expert so always get a pasta course.  And if they have the Octopus Okonomiyaki, duh, get that!  Entrees are stunning and stuffing, fish dishes here i have had rock, but don't overlook the duck.  Halverson has webbed feet or something, which propels his duck cookery skills into flight mode.  \n\nDessert is a cute journey into nostalgia, and I'll leave that to surprise you.

As the area would dictate, parking is kind of crazy, but we were able to find a spot a couple of blocks away, so we walked in early, and already in a good mood.  We were warmly welcomed, and seated immediately.  When you have a toddler, quick service is kind of a big deal.  It's a pretty new spot, I think, so the high chairs were brand new, and our little guy didn't fuss much about sitting in the seat.  They don't have a kid's menu, but we asked if they could offer a kid's portion for some of the dishes, and they were accommodating with the pancake, which sounded pretty good to me and my husband.\n\nThey have an interesting and extensive beer list (not every beer, but it's well curated, and give a nice set of options for any flavor profile you'd want), and the cocktail I had was excellent.\n\nWe got 2 small plates to start. Their infamous potato and egg puffs, and the smoked salmon mousse. My toddler son went nuts for the salmon mousse. It's smokey, and had fresno chiles, avocado, fried capers, and pickled red onions on top with house made bagel chips.  We were pretty stoked about it as well.  He didn't go for the potato puffs, but he doesn't like eggs.  Me and my husband on the other hand were very happy with the puffs. Great texture, and great flavor. It would have been easy to eat a plate each.\n\n That said, the mains came pretty soon, and with it, my son's pancake, my duck hash, and his messy breakfast sandwich.  Everyone was happy with the food.  My son can be a bit of a picky eater, but breakfast is usually his favorite. He can polish off a normal pancake, or a square of waffle, but he had 3/4 of one of the butter-fried pancakes. He sat there, popping bites into his mouth, and asking for me to cut more over and over.  We thought he'd get through half, and he just kept going. These are not small pancakes!  It was about 3/4\" thick, and about 7\" wide.  He looked like a contestant who knew he was going to lose in an eating contest, but he had to keep going.\n\nThe hash was excellent. More than anything, the quality of their eggs were great.  The breakfast sandwich was even better than the hash.  The sausage patty was perfectly cooked, and the scale was perfectly balanced.\n\nWe are eager to go back and try dinner another time, and hopefully brunch again, with the whole family.", "author": "Erin O."}

I beg anyone to give me the name of a place that serves brunch of equal or greater deliciousness. \n\nYou can try but you probably won't find one.\n\nAs the smoked salmon mousse was the first dish that was served we couldn't help thinking \"wow this is really fresh and delicious. How refined, creative and yet affordable and voluminous.\" $8 for that is just a complete joke. Then the puffed potato came and we were like \"wow this place is freaking special\". Absolutely delicious. So elaborate yet flavorful. So many chefs intend complexity and fail. That meal was a mastery of flavor combined with creativity and detail. The potato itself is delicious and inventive with the egg inside. You top that with a bed of awesome cauliflower pur\u00e9e and thinly cut ingredients adding texture to an already amazing dish. Just incredible.\n\nThen came the French toast... I told my girlfriend \"eh, it's just ok\". She tried. And then acknowledged how hilarious I was as those French toasts were the best French toasts we had ever had by far. To be fair they were not really French toasts. Just like the rest they were just another magically flavorful and creative dish that blew us away.\n\nAt that point we had decided \" ok this place is ridiculous\".

The place was cute and decorated kinda modern with exposed brick. V-day dinner was prix fixe, and the choices were good - halibut or lamb for main course. My husband and I ordered both choices so we could taste more things and everything we had that evening was enjoyable. We also had enough space and didn't feel we were sitting in the laps of other diners- even on V-day, they didn't pack us in like sardines. The service was good, even on a busy night, and they did not rush us. We had a good experience here. I would recommend it, and I'd come back.", "author": "Ness S."}

We were lucky enough to get to try a plethora if items since we were eating family-style in our big group.

I salivate every time I think of this meal.\n\nBut, even better than the food was the service. It was flawless and even though several of us lingered over last glasses of wine (we don't see each other that often and were really enjoying catching up) nary an eye was blinked.\n\nStones Throw is definitely a fantastic dining destination for a date or a group and if you haven't been you should try it sooner rather than later.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

They have a great wine list as well. Love the idea that they encourage contribution for dessert (you're given the opportunity to make a recommendation that they could eventually add to the menu!). \n\nI've been here a couple of times for dinner. Portions are small but tasty - pretty much what you would expect in a restaurant of this caliber. What did disappoint was the service. I came with a group of girls to celebrate a birthday. We wound up ordering a couple entrees and some apps and starters to share. The waiter made it very clear that he thought we were being cheap. I understand that the hostess plans based on table tops, but I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for not ordering hundreds of dollars of food and wine. That should have been the waiter's job to communicate that to the hostess, not our fault for not ordering more. \n\nOn top of that we were celebrating a 30th birthday and he did not even offer a word of congratulations. I just felt overall he brushed us off as soon as he realized we wouldn't have an outrageous tab. \n\nLastly, as far as food goes, the squid ink pasta and duck are outrageously delicious. We also tried the potato balls, which were basically glorified hush puppies. They always recommend the peanut butter and jelly doughnuts but I've hated them both times I've had them. It's like dipping a sugared donut in peanut butter. Way too dry.\n\nNonetheless, I'll be back again, perhaps this time to check out brunch.", "author": "Venice P."}

The hopes were dashed by a combination of tiny portions, inappropriate substitutions and mains that were remarkable for their modest size and extraordinary mediocre quality. \nLet's start here: they lie about their menu. The Lamb Sugo with Pappardelle pasta illustrated the issues with this place. The serving size was tiny-if there was more than one tablespoon of lamb in the entire dish, we missed it. And what was there was greasy and lacking in flavor (which with lamb, you really have to work at). The pasta--which is why this dish was ordered-lacked the pasta named. When service was queried as to the change, she said, \"the chef did not have it and decided to use this.\" She could not even name the pasta (we informed her it was Tagliatele) and that was that. \nThe 48 hour slow braised lamb was medium rare--explain that one to me--loaded with fat, and what tasted like a weird BBQ sauce on top. If this was braised 48 hours, it was held under the armpit of the chef. Garbage. Complete. Total size: perhaps 5 oz including tomatoes and stuff. \nStarters were better. Octopus was quite good (although we don't get the croquet thing at all), halibut crudo was excellent if light on portion. Two glasses of the Italian white were good.\nWe brought our own wine, $20 corkage fee. Our bill was $150+. Totally outrageous-and we were starving after, we actually grabbed pair of slices at a pizza joint near out hotel after. Service very average.\nVerdict: this is a millennial place, for people who want to learn about food and wine, but don't yet. That includes management and kitchen.", "author": "Rich M."}

The outside is perfectly crispy and once you bite into the potato, you get a slightly running yolk inside. \n\nSquid ink conchiglie pasta -A perfectly balanced dish. There was enough flavor and salt to compliment the seafood, but not over power it. \n\n\"Da Burga\" - Very solid burger with a thick patty on a toasted brioche bread that did not get soggy even to the very last bite. There wasn't any faults in the burger, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best I've ever had. \n\n\"Toad in the Hole\" Lasagna - The dish looks small, but it's very hearty and you really can't say no to runny egg. The mushrooms layered in this lasagna are very earthy and rich. The greens on the dish helped with presentation, but I didn't particular think they add much to the dish in terms of taste\n\nChocolate Bananas Foster- DELICIOUS. Not too sweet even though we got a heavy hand of the caramelized banana and walnut topping. The brownies pieces are small but incredibly decadent.

The only really great thing is the duck must have been related to Mother Goose, it was so large and meaty. Not gamey at all.\n\nThe price is where it truly takes a few steps back in the stars.

Stones Throw is definitely my new and favorite restaurant! :)\n\nWe decided to be spontaneous and have dinner here on a random Tuesday night. We had a pretty late reservation (8:45PM) as all the other times were all filled up. Per the reviews, we gave ourselves enough time to find parking in the area. Man, parking was a pain! We circled for quite awhile and managed to find a spot on Lombard Street. A couple of blocks of walking was actually not too bad because the view was amazing at night. We could see Crooked Street (Lombard Street), the Bay Bridge, and the Coit Tower! :)\n\nAnyways, we sat down exactly at our reservation time. I was quite surprised that the whole restaurant was packed when we first sat down and when we left. It just shows how good Stones Throw is! We had already knew what we were gonna share/order:\n\nPuffed Potato & Eggs - Placed on top of cauliflower mousse, chives, and crispy chicken skin. This dish was pretty amazing. Inside the puffed potato leaked the yolky egg. The puffed potato was so fluffy, soft, and warm. I really liked how the breading of the puffed potato was just thin enough. It wasn't too heavy too!\n\nSquid Ink Conchiglie Pasta - Came with spicy capers, clams, calamari, and tender greens. Love love love this dish! A generous amount of seafood was provided. The pasta was cooked al dente and was very flavorful. It was actually a perfect portion size because if we were given more, I think it might have been a little bit too much. \n\nPork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear - Loved this dish as well. The pig's ears were so crispy that it reminded me of chips. The pork belly was lean and not too fatty. This dish was also served with avocado, citrus, moresque spice, and kale. It complemented the pork belly very well as it was refreshing. \n\nCrispy 38 North Duck Breast & Thigh - Came with black rice, asian pear, celery, and peking spiced jus. A very generous portion of the duck breast and thigh. Unfortunately, it was a bit overcooked, but it was still good. I enjoyed the thigh part more though. I thought the black rice was a bit interesting. It kind of reminded me of risotto. I usually don't like cooked fruits (pear), however, Stones Throw cooked it very well that I actually really enjoyed the cooked asian pear!\n\nSadly, we were stuffed from our meal and didn't get to order dessert. (Also, because we had ice cream at Swensen's before dinner.) However, I am absolutely sure we will be back to Stones Throw again. Overall, it was a delicious and affordable meal. Service was excellent and friendly. Everything was well executed and our water cups were never empty. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant 100%!

Instead of having to worry about parking, Uber it and show your receipt to your server, 5% will be taken off your bill.  Not only is that one great way to accommodate your customers, the hostess literally walked outside and welcomed us into the restaurant even before they were opened for service.  The staff all felt that it was too chilly to be outside so although they were still setting up some things, they wanted us to be indoors.  Totally a nice gesture on their part that will be ingrained in my head - we got to stay warm and preview the bar while looking through the menu.  If you are into beers, you will definitely appreciate their  extensive selection.  \n\nNot only was the front of the house super warm and welcoming, our server Danielle was amazing too!

She was very attentive all throughout our brunch, constantly filling our waters and checking if she could get us anything.\n\nSimplicity is the key to this successful eatery.  Their brunch menu is not too extensive, but they keep things simple by focusing on a few small bites, some savories, and a few sweets.  Thanks to the recommendations of Cherylynn N., we started with the Puffed Potato & Egg and boy, they were insanely delicious (thanks Cherylynn!).  I'm usually not a fan of egg yolks either, but the techniques in preparing this dish made us yearning for more!  The chefs not only managed to get the yolk oozy delicious, but the outer layer on the potato had the right amount of crispiness.  \n\nWe also ordered \"da burga\" with tater tots and the asparagus w/ duck confit hash which were both just a tasty.  The duck confit by itself was a bit on the saltier side, but once you mix the bite with a piece of the biscuit + the runny eggs, it was solid flavor combination in my mouth.  Da burga was cooked to perfection, we asked for it to be medium and that was def. what we received, one juicy well seasoned burger.  The tater tots accompanied with it is just as amazing!  Bacon, sour cream, and chives blended into each tater tot as if I was biting into a loaded potato.\n\nTo balance out the savories, we opted for the spiced pumpkin doughnuts with pumpkin butter as our dessert.  The doughnuts were light and fluffy and resembled a lot like beignets.  I'm nowhere close to being a pumpkin fan like my husband, but even I liked it.  It's not often that he finishes his dessert either but when he does, you know it's a great dessert.  The pumpkin butter was a nice touch, he only wished there was more of it and maybe have it filled inside each doughnut.   \n\nLook no further, stop by Stones Throw for either Sunday Brunch or a nice dinner, you will not be disappointed!", "author": "Janetto L."}

I definitely started my first Friday of 2014 right with a dinner at this spot.\n\nFirst things first: you're in Russian Hill, and you know parking will be horrendous.  Stones Throw is situated on a cable car line, but if you're feeling fancy or running late, an Uber ride will also get 5% off your bill.\n\nThe menu did not disappoint.  I arrived a bit late to share a final piece of a crunchy, crispy, and spicy chicharrone.  YOU MUST ORDER THIS - absolute flavor explosion.\n\nThe table had the puffed potato and eggs, pork belly and crispy pig's ear, and grilled octopus to share.  I especially enjoyed the puffed potato and eggs, as it take delicate skills to make a perfect runny yolk enveloped in the puff.  I hope this isn't one of the seasonal items and stays on the menu ALL THE TIME.\n\nI couldn't decide what to get for my main course, so I went with the pate and the pasta (diet will start...sometime in 2014?).  The pate came out looking gorgeous, almost dessert like in terms of color and presentation.  The flavor combination with the soft mustard pretzel was a match made in foodie heaven.\n\nI saved the best for last.  The squid ink conchiglie pasta was cooked al dente, and mixed with clams and calamari for texture on texture on texture.\n\nI know it's only been two months and there may still be kinks to work out - the main one for us being the lag time between courses - but this was all around a fantastic meal.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stones-throw-san-francisco-2?select=PR8mviAIS5h_XsxxeE5IoA#YnZGG-FolFp7mcatdnE5kw\n\nTotal damage for five: $270", "author": "Jenny L."}

Even if I try to lower my expectations by reminding myself that I'm in SF and not LA, our disappointment with the food at Stones Throw was further compounded by its rank in the top 3 of this particular neighborhood. We've wanted to try this place forever, based on the stellar reviews -- and we love the neighborhood -- but frankly just never got around to it. Well that changed last night ... and it will be our last time going there.\n\nTHIS is what we were expecting it to be like: a smaller, SF-sized version of Bestia in LA: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bestia-los-angeles?hrid=o51RA7n82tOz5QytHhxO4A\n\nPROS: Cool trendy vibe, impressively tasty (read: not overly sweet) drinks even in the absence of a full bar, main course beef was quite tasty (but overly salted like everything else) ... and that's about it.\n\nCONS: Snack plates: tried the pat\u00e9 -- it was tasty, but insultingly small; appetizers: ink squid pasta was ... ok ... nothing special, overly salted; pork belly was essentially inedible (all fat); all dishes insultingly, comically small -- and we don't even eat large portions. And once again, this being SF, even though the restaurant has a trendy, upscale atmosphere, with a price to match, NOBODY was dressed up -- not even slightly. Heck, there were people in there with hoodies and shorts, and of course all the guys were just wearing standard, boring button-down business shirts as if it were happy hour and they'd just come from work (really, fellas?), and obviously none of the girls except my fianc\u00e9e were wearing heels and dresses. And this was at 10pm; it was NOT right after work.\n\nAs I've said before, if all I cared about was great food, I'd just eat at home. We go out for the social scene, ambience, and for a little escape from reality.\n\nNope. Not going back. Ever. Very disappointed.\n\n(On a side note, THIS is a really good restaurant right next-door: http://www.yelp.com/biz/amarena-san-francisco)\n\nNB. We guess the only possible way people could rate this restaurant so high is either (a) they've never eaten in top restaurants in other cities in the world (i.e., stuck in an insular bubble); (b) they blindly love everything in SF; (c) they just have really bad taste.", "author": "Marc H."}

Stones Throw was everything we could have expected and more. We had their Sunday brunch filled with pancakes, hash, a tasty breakfast sandwich, and even a burger. The icing on the cake was the ginger infused donuts which were quite delightful. The staff was friendly, the drink menu was diverse and their wine options (for dinner) were vast. The ambiance was modern and chic and fits right into the Hyde Street vibe. \n\n5 stars could easily be given for the food, the drinks, and the ambiance but the service was phenomenal and that's where the 5 stars should really be the focus. The hostess was alert and eager to help with a drink order while we waited for our table.

I asked the waitress what it was and she told me \"chesnut blended with truffle oil.\"  Oh kaaayyyy, so where is the truffle?  I couldn't taste a damn thing.

It turns out many of the people from the Michael Mina group (Ryan, owner of Stones Throw, the ex Chef de Cuisine of Michael Mina, and our host Thommas) had jumped ships to this new American restaurant in Russian Hill. Thommas immediately gave us champagne while we were waiting for our table.\n\nHighlights:\n\n1) Duck Pate & Mousse with Pretzel - closest thing to foie gras you can get in this state! So good...pretzel was to die for too...it was super fresh and soft. Not your typical Auntie Anne's! \n\n2) Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with clams. PERFECT FOR ALL YOU SQUID INK PASTA LOVERS! The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente, with yummy seafood touch from the clams. Can't come here without ordering. My only complaint is that I wish it were an entree, rather than a pasta. Too small for someone's meal unless you really eat like a bird.\n\n3) Fish...which I believe was Halibut. They Sous-vide'd it, so it was cooked perfectly, very soft and pretty much a poached fish. They took this one off the menu though unfortunately, I couldn't find it! =(\n\n4) Lamb was ordered twice at our table. It was very good - I typically don't like lamb, but this was cooked in a way where it did not taste like lamb (the best). If you are a lamb lover, order this dish!\n\nAmbiance was young, loud, dark, fun, similar to Pesce. Food was phenomenal. However, parking was awful. My bf and I ended up hiking up the hill from Van Ness in the rain, not the best way to end your Saturday night! Do yourself a favor and allow 45 mins to find parking. If you get there early, treat yourself to a cocktail!\n\nCan't wait to return for a family member's birthday!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

The mushroom tempura (they had a slightly different and fancier name) was interesting and full of good mushroom umami.  Squid ink pasta had a great texture which went really well with the beautiful dark hue.  Grilled octopus was one of the best I've had.  Super tender.  Too bad the five of us had share one little tentacle.  My entree the duck had great flavors.  The currants, hazelnuts and greens all went really well together.  Also made awesome leftover and didn't  lose any flavor after I microwaved it. \n\nThe soup was too salty.

Looking at the menu + pictures, I decided I had to try it out.  I search on a table for Sunday morning and OMG, they have availability the upcoming weekend.  \n\nNo, I didn't have to schedule it weeks in advance and no I didn't have to go online at midnight to try to get a table for the next day block (30 or 60). \n\nApproximately an hour before our reservations I receive two text messages from them.  First one to double check if our situation had changed and whether or not we were still coming.  And the second one was a tip regarding parking.  They suggested we take an Uber and if we did, it would be 5% off our entire meal!  Woaaa that is sooo cool!  We opted not to take Uber, only because we had several errands we had to run that day.  We will definitely take them up on that offer when we have dinner there.  And trust me, after that brunch... we will have many dinners there.\n\nReservations were at a decent time, 11:30!!  We show up about 25 minutes early, because we're always early.  Luckily they have availability and seat us immediately.  We ordered:\n\n** PITCHER OF PIMM'S :: 4/5 stars :: for $20, it's a pretty good deal.  And normally I'd say a pitcher for $20 is a great deal, but the pitcher was FULL of ice and the glasses they brought to pour the PIMM'S in was also full of ice... so it was a bit deceptive.  But it was very refreshing and great compliment to brunch\n** SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE sans scallions :: 5/5 stars :: so much flavor!  mousse was extremely smooth and the pickled items they added complimented the mousse w/o overpowering it.  I think they also added fried capers, which I love!  It added another level of texture.  The bagel chips were a bit hard, I was worried about my teeth on a couple bites!  :D\n** DUCK CONFIT HASH :: 5/5 stars :: I don't even know where to begin. This was AHHHH-mazing!  I don't even want to describe it, I know I can't do it justice!  Only one other thing to note, I don't even like English peas, but they made me like it!\n** \"DA BURGA\" aka DA DISASTER :: 5/5 stars :: everything was perfect, from the great sauces all the way down to the ooey gooey of the cheese melting down the sides of the patty!  Probably my favorite burger in the city for now.\n\nStaff was friendly and perfectly attentive.  I love this place and can't wait to come back for dinner!  Happy eating!", "author": "Tina F."}

I never review service in my reviews because to me it just isn't that important to me, however when you get service that is as good as this you realize how every restaurant you spend your hard earned money in should have service this good.\nFood - I thought the food was divine. My mind was not blown, but I thought everything I tried was excellent. I had the egg puffs and duck pate to start. Both were quite nice. The house made pretzel rolls for the pate was a nice touch and everything worked quite well together. Alysha poured us perfect tastings for 4 different wines before we made our selection (gladly, I'll add, which again was foreign to me). I went with the Pinot, which was beautiful. \nWe shared the burrata salad. It was pretty good, but I didn't think it was amazing. For my main I had \"Da Burga\". It was pretty tasty.

Despite the love and loyalty I've had w/ Ben, Leila and the old Luella crew, I managed to go in w/ an open mind.\n\nAfter a round of Pimm's cocktail - my favorite w/ ginger beer, we decided to sample their snacks & starters from the seasonal menu and leave room for desserts.  We had SALT-ROASTED BEETS and DUNGENESS CRAB SALAD as snacks, and mistakenly thought the beets were compliments from the chef since it was not quite a snack order portion w/ tiny bits of beets to warrant a $8 price tag, guess I was wrong.   Unfortunately the dungeness crab salad came loaded w/ salt (and I'm a salt freak!), but I was more distracted by the shells I found in the crab salad.  It's a pet peeve of mine when I dine out thinking I would pay premium to leave the work for the pros so I can enjoy my favorite crab shell-free, guess not.  I have to say the artichoke chips accompaniment were mighty delicious and it's too bad for the shells since they got the portion right!\n\nWe ventured to have a few starters next.  SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA, WARM PORK BELLY SALAD and ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLE SALAD.  The pasta was so well-made, al dente and satisfying, it was too bad that the clams and calamari were so tiny that left me wanting for more of the seafood.  The pork belly could be a little crispier to contrast w/ the tender juiciness inside, but the pairings of the citrus and avocado really lighten things up and cut down on the fattiness for a perfectly executed salad.  My friend's roasted root vegetable salad came w/ such a generous selection of root veggies and pear, it was a feast for the eyes.\n\nI was eyeing our neighbor's PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY DONUTS, but decided to go w/ GRANDMA'S APPLE PIE....BUT NOT QUITE and LEMON MERINGUE PIE.  Let me just say if you left Stones Throw without trying their version of a deliciously deconstructed apple pie, you'll need to turn right back around and order that alone!  It's absolutely brilliant...I won't spoil the surpirse for you but you'll thank me for it :)  Lemon meringue was so light and not overwhelmingly 'lemony' but I'll still come right back to their apple pie!\n\nAll and all, the old Mina crew didn't disappoint on taste.

I wanted to just eat all of these, give up on the rest of my meal and die happy. Too bad I had to share with the bf. The waiter said he wouldn't tell anyone if I I didn't save my bf any while he went to the restroom. Funny guy! \n\nBurger with loaded tots: apparently they only make 20 burgers a day so if you love them, then get one. You can tell the patty is house made with quality ingredients. Loaded tots were pure fatty goodness. Creme fraiche, bacon, chives and cheddar. It was like a baked potato tater tot! \n\nCrispy Duck leg and thigh: crunchy, juicy, flavorful, literally mouth watering as I reminisce... I can't talk about it anymore. Just get it! \n\nPeanut butter and jelly donuts: plain and simple. Little donut balls with peanut butter and jelly swirls you dip into. \n\nGrandma apple pie: Panna cotta, maple ice, rolled wafer, apple pieces, and spices. This is not an apple pie but Apple pie inspired flavors. It was so unique, I absolutely loved it. The flavors and different temperature, different consistency all melded to a whoaaa what did I just put in my mouth? (in a good way) ;-)\n\nPlus lots of good wines and beers to choose from! \n\nService: was friendly, a bit slow, but expected for a crowded Friday night at 7. Definitely make reservations. \n\nDecor: loved the repossessed wood look, with cute little bird motifs. Comfy and cozy. I want my kitchen to look like this place! \n\nParking: arrive at least 30 min early. Or park farther and get Uber to drop you off. The restaurant worked some deal with them.

We first went for my wife's birthday, when they certainly pulled out all the stops. We shared a couple of dishes which were all very good, the standout being the Da Burga. The slaw that they use on it complements the richness of the cheese and meat perfectly. The Everything Tots that come with it are an experience themselves as well. Little balls of cheesy salty goodness.\n\nNeedless to say, we have returned a few times to relive the experience of Da Burga. Once was when my wife was pregnant and thus couldn't eat the burger at their usual medium rare serving. When they brought out the meal the waiter actually waited for my wife to cut into it to see if it was cooked enough. Before she even thought about it, he was taking it back to the kitchen so that they could cook it just a little bit longer. Literally, three people swung by to make sure that it was okay the second time around. We weren't upset, we didn't make any big commotion, but it was SO NICE, to know that they genuinely cared. That made the experience even better! Kudos to the staff of Stones Throw!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-12", "description": "This was our second time eating at Stones Throw - the first time was for my wife's birthday and there was a little confusion with the wait staff that resulted in our table being over attended to and gave the feeling of being rushed.  When one of the owners, Ryan, found out about my experience, he reached out to me with a very sincere and genuine apology and gave his assurance that our experience was not what was intended.   Thanks to his above and beyond effort, my wife and I decided to give Stones Throw another chance and the rest of this review will be about that experience.\n\nWe arrived on time for our reservation and were seated promptly.  They have an extensive beer list that contains many interesting items that aren't your typical beers that you'd find around here.  The waitress was very friendly and you could tell she really had a passion about the food they were serving as every question was answered in detail with enthusiasm.\n\nWe started with the Squid Ink pasta and the Pork Belly and Rillets - I've never really had Pork Belly before, but after eating this, I'm totally a fan.  It surpassed my initial expectations and was in one word, deletions.  As for the pasta, this is very different than any other pasta I've had before in the sense that it is jet black (from the squid ink).  This was also very good.\n\nFor the main course I had their burger - I had been eyeing that before and I was not disappointed.  In fact, this was probably the best burger that I've ever had at a restaurant.  That's not to take away from any of the other great burgers I've eaten - it's more to describe just how good this was.  There were two things that made this stand above the rest:  First, I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly pink all the way through - just how I wanted it.  At most other restaurants, you have to order medium rare just to hope that you get it medium with a little bit of pink.  Second, the bun, cheese, and the non cream based cole slaw all combine to provide a really excellent flavor.  The burger is also served with tater tots that are filled with cheese and sourcream.  The next time I'm in the mood to have a burger at a restaurant, I'll definitely be headed back up the hill to Stones Throw.\n\nMy wife had the duck, which I had a taste of - it was melt in your mouth tender and my wife really enjoyed it.  For dessert we had the peanut butter and jelly donuts and their new key lime pie - these were great - my wife normally doesn't like lemon or lime but she did enjoy this.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed our dinner and I'm glad we gave Stones Throw a second chance.  I was watching the other tables and I didn't see any of the issues that we had seen previously with over attentive-ness.  The last thing I wanted to say was that both of the owners of this place seem like very pleasant and kind people - it's nice to see such people operating a restaurant in this area.  We'll definitely be back to see them in the future.", "author": "Chris S."}

The beer and wine selection (50 of each) is awesome and the staff is super helpful in helping you identify what you'd like based on your preferences.\n\nThe food is the real winner here. I have tried everything that's currently on the menu (expect Da Burga) and you really can't go wrong. Don't miss the following:\n\n- Puffed Potato & Eggs: in fact, order 2. One order comes with 4 pieces of these tasty, pillow-like bites and an amazing sauce\n- Duck Pate: Possibly the best thing on the menu. Decent chunk of spread only comes with 2 pretzel balls - might want to order an extra pretzel or two (there's more than enough meat to cover it)\n- Squid Ink Pasta: assortment of shellfish, spicy capers and kale. Scraped the plate clean.\n- Octopus Okonomiyaki - the Okonomiyaki Pancake was divine, but the octopus was slightly over-charred for our liking. Nevertheless, we still inhaled it.\n- The Chicken Main Course - so good. Ordered it both times and finished it both times.\n\nThe first time we were there the chef came over to our table to thank us for dining. We enjoyed a beer with him and though the whole experience was amazing. Both times I was there the chef also presented our table with a free dish (duck pate the first time, roasted sunchoke soup the second).

The noise level is pretty high, but that didn't bother us.  If you're looking for a quiet meal, this probably isn't the place.  It was nice to see such a lively venue!\n\nFOOD: We basically ordered every \"Snack\" and \"Starter\" for our table of 4.  It was just the right amount of food, even though more food was being pushed onto us by the waiter - more on that later.  Some standouts to me were the Duck Pate & Mousse and the grilled Octopus.  The squid ink pasta was good, but not \"great.\"\n\nSERVICE: The service wasn't bad, by any means, as our waiter brought us a taste of two different wines so we could make our decision about which bottle(s) to order, in addition to people quickly descending to fold napkins when one retreated to use the restroom.  There was always someone there, if needed.  However, our server was a bit rude, standoffish, and was clearly annoyed with us that we hadn't ordered his recommended bottle of wine (that was 50% more expensive than the one we wanted).  The service hit it's low point after ordering only one snack for the table, when the waiter almost demanded the menus back while we ate so as not to stain them...seriously...We all chuckled and thought he was kidding, referencing how voraciously people took down their delicious food, but he said with a straight face again, \"I'm going to have to take the menus away while you eat.\"  We asked if it was because they were needed elsewhere (at this point, the restaurant is still nearly empty - maybe 15% of tables filled), and he said no.  It was so awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nOVERALL: While the food is very good, the service was attentive, and the restaurant was lively, I would be very hesitant to return to this restaurant without asking to NOT be seated in this waiter's section again.", "author": "Robert P."}

It was pricey for the portions, which I would be fine with, if the food itself was delicious and quality. I feel like it tries to be \"fancy,\" while at \"cheaper\" prices, so it's stuck at a weird in-between type of place.

It's very interesting with the addition of the Ramen-style Miso Broth.\n\nLIBERTY FARMS DUCK BREAST - I highly recommend this dish - it was so melt-in-your mouth good.

The service was on point, and interestingly it seemed to be an all male wait staff; not sure if it was just the night or is intentional. My dining partner did have the only negative comment of the evening that there was far too much urine around the toilet for a restaurant as cute as this is, but if there are few women on staff, it seems sadly unsurprising. Still, mop around the toilet fellas! I didn't see it, so I can't confirm her findings. However, sullied bathroom aside, this place is fantastic. Inventive without being crazy. Bites with all parts of a plate, or pieces of it, were equally delicious. I had the sea bass, my fellow diner had the duck for our entrees, both were fantastic. Our snacks & starters were the potato egg balls, which in reviewing fellow yelpers' pictures, our may have been a bit overcooked as our yolks were solid. Still yummy, but would have preferred a looser yolk. We also had the mushroom ragout, which was super flavorful and delicious and the squid ink pasta which was quite lovely -- especially the foam which seemed to be a very delicate sweet onion.  Dessert was a tough choice, so we didn't choose and got both the s'mores and the pb&j donuts. Though the s'mores was quite yummy, I was surprised by how effing delicious the donuts were. I didn't want them to end and held myself back from licking the plate. Crazy good all around. Left feeling full and quite happy.\n\nWe didn't hold back ordering (as you can tell), and also had 3 drinks per person in addition to the 3 starters, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts (just call me Fatty McFatterson, I've earned it). All said, however, the tab was just over $200 all in. I'd say that's not bad considering the quality of every component of the evening.", "author": "Shannon K."}

Especially if the food is great. Or, only if the food is great.\n\nWe were greeted by a wonderfully buoyant hostess (I think she's an owner), who immediately caught upon our comments about the \"moss painting\" -- and told us the whole story. She then graciously took us to a nice table in the back -- didn't feel like the back-back but just the other part of the restaurant. \n\nThen we were greeted by our exceptionally, on the edge of histrionic, OH SO HAPPY server -- ultimately, we realized we were the ones in the wrong for judging her too harshly and that she was well-versed, very enthusiastic and helpful. And funny. And cute. You go girl! Go!\n\nSmall menu: maybe 20-25 dishes all together. Maybe less. I left my friends to pick out the menu and they engaged the server to recommend.\n\nWhat we got:\n\n\nPUFFED POTATO & EGGS\nCauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin -- delicious! A must have! Delicate, surprising and we all wanted more more more after we each tried a small croquette. \n\nDUCK P\u00c2T\u00c9 & MOUSSE\nFrench's Mustard, Cornichons, Warm Soft Pretzel -- the pretzel was the perfect accompaniment to this dish. They even brought us more mini pretzel rolls without us asking. Fabulous!\n\nSQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA | 15\nSpicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens -- this was the best dish of the night. Squid ink pasta was fresh and not too \"al dente\" for me and the seafood was so good that our non-pescatarian ate it too. Very fresh, very delicious, very delicate!\n\nPea Shoot salad -- seasonal on their menu -- had a brioche crouton and meyer lemon sauce with ricotta cheese -- I wanted this to be more OOMPH -- it was a nice moment of greens in a protein heavy meal but nothing to dance-about about.\n\nWARM PORK BELLY & CRISPY PIG'S EARS | 14\nPork Rillettes, Charred Onion, Sunflower Seeds -- no, no no no no NO. Too much fat. Weird. I like pork belly when there's pork on it. Maybe we got the fattest plate of the night or maybe everyone orders this -- I don't know.

It was cooked perfectly medium rare and I loved the \"Everything\" Baked Potato tots that came with it!\n\nChocolate Bananas Foster ($8): \nThe presentation of this dish was unique as they pour a boiling caramel sauce on top; however, I thought it was a little too sweet and rich for me. \n\nOVERALL:\nThe food was really good and memorable so I would definitely come back again, especially for the squid ink pasta.

We noted that on our reservation and when we walked in, received a nice hand written card congratulating us. After we were seated, he waiter also knew why we were there and asked about it. I do appreciate the personal touch and it definitely made the experience more memorable.\n\nWe like variety so we ordered three snacks, two starters, and one main. We started off with a shrimp and scallop cevice, which reminded us of a very similar Vietnamese shrimp salad. The cracker it was served with, however, was much nicer with a finer texture that was easy to chew. The flavors were very fresh and vibrant, and we agreed it was one of the best dishes of the night.  The second snack was a duck mousse and pate with soft pretzels. The presentation was on point. The mousse and pate were served like a layered cake, topped with whole grain mustard and slices of cornichons. We agreed the pate was amazing but the soft pretzel lacked as the ideal platform in which to make it shine. We've had corn cakes and custard brioches in the past that would have sent this out ofbthe park. The third snack was my fiancee's favorite of the night--a puffed potato that had a wonderful deep-fried crust and a gooey center. This one is a must get.\n\nThe first starter we got was the squid ink pasta. There are many good reveiws on this on Yelp, but although we enjoyed this dish, it was possibly the weakest dish of the night. The pasta was perfectly cooked but I felt the flavor was a bit lacking. I like strong flavors and this was maybe too subtle for my taste. The second starter was the octopus, served on a bed of radicchio and bacon. I liked this one a lot--the octopus was perfectly cooked and had intensely smoky grilled flavor.\n\nThe main was a ribeye steak on a bed of crispy rice. The steak was ordered medium rare but appeared more on the rare side. It had really good flavor, but the portion size was lacking for a main, maybe about 5 oz at most. The crispy rice actually tasted more like undercooked rice to me. There were some crispy bits in there that were good, so I can see what they were going for, but the majority was just tough and dry. \n\nFor the dessert we ordered the Its-It, which seemed like a standard Its-It but dressed up with a chocolate sauce. We were also given a complimentary taste of their peanut butter and jelly donut, which was just a couple donut balls with smears of peanut butter and jelly on the plate. They were enjoyable, but if I were to come here again, I'd skip dessert and get a scoop of Swensen's across the street.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience with many more hits than misses.", "author": "Newton L."}

The portions were very small, but enough to keep us occupied till our main course. \n\nI ordered the crispy-skinned bass and my friends each tried something different - the duck, burger and steak dishes. The bass was delicious; my only complaint was that I thought the broth was slightly salty. The duck looked really good; it's on my list of 'to try's.

We have two young boys and didn't want to risk someone breaking into an ear-piercing rendition of \"Let It Go\" in a packed to capacity restaurant.  I'm talking to you, late night couples and people who do not eat at retirement home hours like we do.  You're welcome.  \n\nThe lovely woman who served us was cheerful, friendly, and seemed to genuinely liked our kids.  She was very accommodating, and even provided us with an off the menu children's selection of main dishes.  We didn't think this was a family friendly restaurant, and it turned out to be exactly that.  The boys chose the pasta, with a really delicious cheesy sauce...the kryptonite of all kids under the age of five.  They were thrilled and we were thankful to not have to worry about having to order an adult entree for the boys.  After all, not all kids like octopus, no matter how good it is.\n\nMy husband and I had the potato puffs with egg, which were fabulous.  The corn soup came with a demonstration of \"how to make soup look really cool\" by the server, who poured it into the bowl at the table.  It was surprisingly complex, tasty, and rich.  And although I did not partake, my husband was a huge fan of the crispy duck breast with accompanying taquitos.  Everything had a familiarity to it, but was brand new in concept and execution to us.  It was thoroughly enjoyable and we came away from the table happy, full, and excited to plan our next visit.  \n\nBTW, my new restaurant name: Lawrence Falcon.  Soft open in a week.", "author": "Kristina R."}

I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and got called, emailed, and texted reminding me of my reservation which was a bit bizarre. \n\nI went with the burger (da burga) with a side of loaded tater tots. I thought the burger was OK. With a hefty $17 price tag, i was expecting better but in my opinion it was too rich. the bun felt and tasted soaked in butter, the meat was average at best and it wasn't really \"dressed up\" with anything more than some cheese.  The loaded tater tots were very good however. You bite into them and it tastes like you are eating the best part of a baked potato. My girlfriend got the scrambled egg dish with vegetables which she was satisfied with but nothing special (not too many vegetarian options on the Menu). We also split the salad with green goddess dressing and avocado.  It was definitely on the smaller side and worth a split as an appetizer as it was well dressed and the ingredients were fresh.\n\nThey have a good bottled beer selection but good luck finding a bottle worth getting for less than $12.\n\nAll in all, stones throw was good food at an unreasonable price point. \n\n2 burgers, a breakfast sandwich, scrambled eggs, 2 beers and the mimosas for the table ($25) came out to $160+ and definitely not worth it for the quality of the meal.", "author": "Steven G."}

I've rarely met friendlier and more attentive staff--every single person, from the host to the waitresses to the chef--brightened my day with a smile and great communication.\n\nThe first thing they put down on the table was awesome, and it wasn't even the food: it was the sparkling water. Okay, you're saying, what? Sparkling water? Who cares? It's just like every other sparkling water. But not here. They had some kind of magical unpronounceable potion that merely masquerades as sparkling water on its off nights. I took one sip and I was like, \"Whoa!\"\n\nNow, maybe you're thinking, this guy's spent a whole paragraph on water; are we ever going to talk about the food? Yes! Wow, yes. Just like almost all the other reviewers, I had the puffed potato and egg, which was creamy, interesting, savory, and smooth. Really a delightful starter.\n\nThen for my main, I had the duck, which was equally as mind-blowing as everything else, if not more. It came with so many cool little extra things (all of which were awesome) that I can't even tell you what they all were.

It's in a great location on Hyde and the interior is cozy and welcoming. The food isn't that expensive, it's a great place for a date or for a friendly night out with friends, and the service is friendly and welcoming. But I don't know if I would go back or even really recommend it. Out of all the great places in the city I just don't think it really stands out. \n\nI got the squid ink pasta appetizer, which is definitely the stand-out dish of the evening, the okonomiyaki on a recommendation from a friend, which I didn't really care for, and da burger with tater tots, which was pretty good. The squid ink pasta was really flavorful and portion hearty, especially for an appetizer. I didn't like the okonomiyaki because it didn't really taste the way I expected. I get that this isn't an Asian place so fusion makes sense, but I thought it was just too doughy with little filling. Da Burger was juicy and good, but not better than what I could get at other great burger places, but I did enjoy the cheesy tots a lot.\n\nAgain, a solid place for dinner, but not memorable in my opinion.", "author": "Kate M."}

I called ahead and asked the restaurant to do something for her birthday and they were kind enough to set up a hand written note and offer us dessert at the end but im getting ahead of myself. The restaurant itself is a in nice quaint area of Russian hill and there are the cable cars up and down the street showing the SF flair. The d\u00e9cor of the joint is really simple and modern. They have a bar setup and multiple tables. The servers were all very friendly and we were promptly seated for our reservation. \n\nWe perused the menu after the bday girl was happy about her handwritten note and decided to order multiple starters including a bottle of vino. They had a great vino selection and we were easily able to find a bottle to our liking. We decided to order the Duck Pate, Squid Ink Pasta, Grilled octopus and okonomiyaki pancake, Da burger aka da Disaster, and the striped bass. The Duck pate was good but also a bit rich after a few bites so drink up the vino and use lots of the pretzel roll. The squid ink pasta was standard but well done and we ate every bite of it. The pancake was very unique and pretty solid which was surprising as I thought this would be a hard dish to pull off. The burger was delicious and extremely big. The tater tots were a bit forgettable for me but the main was solid. The striped bass was delicious as well. They brought out a \"surprise\" dessert for the bday girl afterwards to wrap up the dinner. \n\nAll in all, a good experience at this joint.

It's tender, juicy, fatty without being lard-like and oozing with Halvorson's uniquely concocted flavor. \n\nClose contenders were: the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate and mousse and the lasagna. Keep in mind, the lasagna does not look or taste like a traditional lasagna - it's quite quirky but delicious nonetheless!\n\nThe wine list is great but we opted to bring in 2 bottles of our own wine - the corkage fee is only $20 so it's definitely worth it if you want to crack open that special vintage bottle of wine you're secretly guarding at home! \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Clearly leaning on concepts of ethnic comforts it was next in tender Pacific octopus grilled and set adjacent to a savory pancake served with condiments that I found my favorite savory of the evening and only slightly less impressed by rosy duck melded to seasonal vegetables by smoky nut butter it was onto desserts I progressed - that \"fat kid\" comment immediately making sense as a box at the bottom of the menu requested customer's childhood favorites.  At this point warned twice by my waiter that I had overordered it was at my insistence that a duo of desserts arrived and beginning with four pillowy beignets finding their flavor inspired by many kids' lunch the light cocoa cream proved an admirable segue to the NOLA tilted brownie sundae - the flamb\u00e9ed sauce poured tableside to melt a frozen cylinder into a rich pudding far more interesting than anything I experienced at Brennan's.", "author": "Michael U."}

Thankfully it is the former.  The restaurant has a great bar area for waiting and the flow of the restaurant is well spaced so that all the tables are not too far or too close to one another.  Everything we had on the menu was really good and every person at our table was a happy customer.  What more could you ask for!?\n\nThey have snacks, starters and then mains.  The snacks are really just snacks, but the starters are pretty well portioned and for the most part are easy to share.  The entrees were also the perfect portions...enough to satiate without feeling heavy.\n\nWe started with the duck pate and the pretzels.  The presentation was just beautiful and it was good but not the star of the night.  We ordered three starters to share.  The Japanese pancake and the squid ink pasta.  Everyone voted the Japanese pancake their favorite of the starters, but the squid ink pasta was so yummy too.  There was something spicy in it that created the perfect surprise of heat and the broth made you just want to slurp up a big bowl of it.  The Japanese pancake had a lot going on on the dish and with the condiments and this was just the perfect case of more is more.  I mean it was finished with a bacon dashi...hello lover! \n\nFor the entrees the five of us were all eying the same things so three of us ordered the duck and two of us ordered the salmon with the uni risotto.  Here...you can have the duck.  There was a generous serving of duck with crispy duck roll, rhubarb and grilled fennel.  I methodically cut a bite of the rhubarb and then the duck to create single bites as the rhubarb made the duck sing and visa versa.   Whatever sauce was used to create the culinary swish on the plate was definitely not just for decoration...I used each bite to pick up a little sauce in each bite as well and at the end of the dinner my plate was wiped clean except for maybe a small fennel garnish. \n\nI tried a bite of the salmon and the uni risotto and boy was that sublime.  Creamy and perfect both the salmon and risotto.  The salmon was pan seared with a slight crispy exterior and a fall apart center with a tiny sliver of coral in the center...I mean really...just perfection.\n\nThe desserts we had were the comte crepes, the peanut butter and jelly doughnuts and the bananas foster.

A must have for everyone to try!  Next was the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with Clams and Calamari - Insanely delicious and worth the cheat during lent for no pasta:)  Nothing like it!  For the main entree..It was tough to choose while checking out what everyone else was having and I went for the scallops!  Super fresh and seared perfectly.  Fancy dish!  As for dessert... Chocolate bananas foster AND I had to go for some sample bites of the pb&j donuts to really send me over the edge and it was well worth the extra calories!

From hostess, to waitress, to busser, everyone helped create a truly great experience. Just an overall excellently run and executed restaurant. Cannot wait to go back.\n\nUPDATE: came in for brunch and was equally impressed. The smoked salmon appetizer was absolutely delicious and perfectly balanced. The salt bed and complex topping of the oysters could have been overwhelming but instead were balanced with the brine of the oyster shining through. The burger again was amazing and the staff was equally accommodating, helpful, and so so so so nice. Just a perfectly run restaurant.\n\nFURTHER UPDATE: Just continue to be blown away by how great this place is.

We were so impressed with the service that we wanted to write a review. When we arrived, the bar was packed and there were only 2 seats by the window facing the street--great for people watching but not the best in terms of getting bar service. Before we could attempt to wrestle a spot at the bar to order wine, the host came over and gave us a menu and welcomed us. A few minutes later he came back to take our order and make some recommendations. He was super helpful and efficient. The most impressive moment was when we were discussing our wine options with him and another guest came over to him and tried to interrupt the conversation. He politely explained to the woman that he'd be with her in one moment. He pivoted so that he could give us his full attention. After taking our order, he assisted the interrupting woman. I've gotten used to folks interrupting conversations in restaurants--for directions to bathroom, requesting menus, etc, that I was wowed he could so politely place her request on hold and maintain his level of service for us. That is an art. So great wine, great service! We didn't eat here so I can't review the food. But we will definitely be back!", "author": "Susan B."}

Our reservation was at 5:30 which is a great time to dine if you want to avoid the the crowd that arrives by 6:30.  The waiter and bartender greeted us right away. We ordered a Pimms Cup (delicious) and were then taken to the lovely pine table.  The space is arranged wonderfully. They have high ceilings with rafters and lovely pine tables to dine at.They are set around the room and it appears open and not crowded which we loved.\n\nThe service was especially good. Our waiter Stuart was very familiar with the menu and helpful without being all over us.  One server in particular  was a young brunette woman who also wowed us with her service and smile.  \n\nWe tried a number of their dishes among four of us.  For the first course 'snack' one person enjoyed the dungeonus crab salad. While two if us feel that it tasted like onion and salt... Not crab.   And our most favorite was the duck pate.....WOW.  Our second favorite was the potato ball stuffed with egg served over cauliflower and fried chicken skin mouse.\n\nOf the second 'starter' course....\nOur favorite of these dishes was the roasted/grilled octopus with a pancake of vegetable served with a bacon ju and accoutrements including pickled watermelon rind.  The pork belly was fabulous, as was crab curry soup and squid ink pasta with shellfish. \n\nWe liked the duck breast/leg served with Asian spice ju and black sticky rice the best. Two of us had the lamb which was a disappointment at furst. It is served with roasted veggies and a ju.  The plate looks ver dark....the meat looked pretty but perhaps some yellow or orange veggies might brighten it.  The meat itself had the texture of beef. But it had zero flavor! Someone didn't taste tonight?  Anyway.....we were given some  salt and pepper and additional ju, and the meat tasted better.  The veggies were so so.  The waiter offered to bring another dish but, when we added spice it was better....if not great...\nDesert...lemon meringue won this course.  But the donuts with peanut butter and jelly were yummy too.  \nGreat wine. Yummy pressed coffee.\n\nOur friends had dinner at Frances this week and they enjoyed this dinner a lot more:)\n\nIt is a very nice restaurant and we certainly will return.

The down side is that parking sucks around this area and took us forever to find parking. Portion sizes are enough that you will feel full (with dessert though), but definitely no leftovers.\n\nWe started with the fish sticks and squid ink pasta as the appetizers as the server recommended the fish sticks.  The fish sticks were good, fresh, crunchy and flavorful and the mustard sauce they had on top of it also paired well.  However, I thought it wasn't anything special and memorable.  The squid ink pasta was really good! I loved the pasta texture which was a little chewy and perfectly al dente.  There was a lot of seafood in the pasta sauce which gave the dish so much flavor and not overly salty.  The portion was on the smaller side but it was enough to share between two people as we still had our entrees.  \n\nThe entrees we had were the duck breast and sea bass. The duck breast was cooked to a medium rare and very tender and juicy when we cut into it.  I felt on the other hand that the skin was not crispy enough, therefore, the skin was getting more soggy as we continue to through the entree.  The duck confit sausage that was part of the entree was really good as well~\n\nFor the sea bass, fish was cooked perfectly and the skin was very crispy (unlike the duck).  The dish was on the lighter side which was good for me as I still wanted to save room for dessert.  For dessert, we opted for the banana pudding as the people next to us recommended it.  The banana pudding had a lot of real banana flavor (not the extract) and the pie crust was buttery and crunchy.  The caramel they put next to it was only so so.  \n\nFor the service, the server was really nice and was only so so on the recommendations for food and wine (maybe it didn't really suit my taste).  The food came out really fast from appetizers to entree to dessert, which was okay since we were hungry.  But if you wanted more conversations in between, i would like it to be a little more time in as the dinner was finished serving in about 1 hr (starting with the appetizers). Usually restaurants of this style would take about 1.5-2 hrs. \n\nI would definitely come again to try out different dishes and also their brunch as well.", "author": "Ada H."}

The food was really delicious, and the wine selection was phenomenal. This is definitely on the \"places to return\" list.\n\nAlthough there wasn't anything specifically vegan on the menu, when the reservation was put in, inquiry was made, and we were assured that they would be able to provide for me. When we sat down, we let our server know, and he was gracious and accommodating. I often worry about being a problem customer because of dietary restrictions, but I was made to feel like I was no worry at all and they were in fact happy to provide me with something.\n\nWe got the roasted root vegetable appetizer, which was really good, and full of unique vegetables. We actually struggled with placing what some of them were--one was pickled radish that had been roasted! Everything was interesting and stimulating on the palate, with only the cauliflower being slightly overdone to being soft, while everything else was perfect.\n\nFor dinner, I got a bountiful assortment of vegetables, some of which I could not identify (always exciting!). They were mostly sauteed, I believe, and all had great texture and flavor, and none of the natural flavors were drowned out by oil or salt--the seasoning was perfectly balanced. They included a few dollops of a white bean puree, and a few dollops of their green garlic sauce.\n\nThat green garlic sauce stole the show, hands down! It was in my dish, as well as on my companion's meat, and it was just SO. GOOD. I'm salivating a little disgustingly right now while I think about it. You don't even know. Go eat the sauce. Do it. Do it now.\n\nAs mentioned, the wine list was great, with hilarious commentary under the different headings. It's creatively organized by genre of wine, rather than color of type, so you can browse by things like trusty wines, unusual wines, traditional wines, and so on, plus a \"bargain bin\" of super spendy wines that aren't going very quickly so have been reduced to really great prices. Our server was really helpful with steering us toward a bottle of wine that would match with both of our meals.\n\nThe dessert menu looked killer, but we were far too full to get any. However, they solicit dessert suggestions, with the chance that your favorite recipe will go on the menu--and you'll get to come eat it! Very fun.\n\nOverall, a beautiful, nicely laid out little neighborhood restaurant with a great personality and food and wine good enough to make it a destination from other neighborhoods.

It was served with two warm and delectable pretzel rolls. \n\nFor our main course we ordered the lamb, which was cooked perfectly and named accurately - the meat had just a hint of olive. We also got the black cod, again cooked perfectly. We finished up with the chesnut raviolo - probably my favorite, though all three mains were really excellent.\n\nWe passed on dessert and went for ice cream up the street (probably not the smartest call). Service was good but bordering on a little slow - to be fair, we had a baby with us, and took her out of the restaurant a few times so the progression of food was probably lost on me. They were very friendly despite the fact that she was the only baby in the restaurant.\n\nA final word on drinks - I appreciate that the menu is split into different categories/descriptions of both beer and wine. The apostrophe is their version of a Manhattan and it is really delightful. Would definitely come back.", "author": "Ruchi M."}

Not so this time, although  I have to admit we were a party of 6 and most of the others liked the place. When I sat down I was looking at the yelp reviews on my phone and the waiter said; \"I'll be a lot more help to you that those reviews.\" NOT UNLESS HE COULD MAKE THE PORTIONS BIGGER! I've eaten in those she-she French places, Stones throw makes them look like Good and Plenty in Pennsylvania where the Amish feed you till you burst. If you're going to be pretentious and serve entrees that are the size of Nouveau Cuisine at least the taste should be there, this wasn't.\nSo disappointed I don;t even want to continue reviewing.", "author": "Bill F."}

We tried to go to breakfast here 2 weeks ago, woke up and saw they opened at 11am. Cool. Walked up to the restaurant around 11:30am, and chairs were still up and the place was empty - puzzling. Came back again last weekend, excited to see the doors were open and people being served, and were seated quickly upon arrival for our reservation. We sat in the back, which to be honest, was a bit dreary/dark next to the wine cellar - the windows and light in the front room were definitely a better vibe.\n\nThe menu was pretty limited as well - unless you're a morning-sweets kinda person, which i'm not - there are 4 \"savory\" items: burrata salad, duck hash, egg with spinach and mushroom, and a burger. Well, alright - not super stoked on the selection, but I went with the eggs (seemed to be the most breakfast-y and healthy alternative). Wine prices were also pretty steep (i can stomach 11 bucks for a glass of Champs at brunch, but 13? eep!)\n\nOverall, my eggs, spinach and \"foraged\" mushrooms were just that - scrambled eggs, spinach, and mushrooms. Could have totally made this at home and saved the $14 dollars on breakfast. I have no problem dropping this kind of cash on a nice meal, but for the price, the portion and taste just didn't do it for me - not to mention the limited menu.\n\nI might try Stones Throw for dinner since it's in the neighborhood, but I'll be saving my brunch money for Blackwood, where the menu, quality, portions, and bottomless mimosas always impress.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

My daughter had phoned ahead to warn that our party of 8 included a gluten-free eater, a vegetarian, a diabetic and someone with a severe poultry allergy and even though we were having the fixed menu, family style, they would need to be accommodated.  Well the food was fantastic, plate after plate of deliciousness kept coming to the table, and every time one of our special needs would have been compromised, they got their own special serving.  \n\nI really wish I'd taken notes, so I could describe the food in detail, but highlights for me included the puff potatoes, the corn risotto, the salmon & the pork belly tonkatsu - sublime!  I am absolutely not a pudding person, but when the s'mores and donuts came they could not be resisted.\n\nWine list was good - interesting & well-priced.  We went to K&L the next day to buy some of the wine we had here.\n\nService was excellent, staff were very friendly on arrival and pleasant all through the evening.\n\nGroups can be difficult to accommodate in a cosy, intimate restaurant, and I repeat, our group was awkward, but Stones Throw made a stellar job of it.

While few dishes were good (such as banana foster dessert), there were few misses for me (strawberry shortcake; puffed potato  & eggs) and the main dish (steak) was pretty standard and not memorable. That said, I think it's a fun place to try once.

The donuts were amazing! Melt in you mouth; I could've eaten several of them without the jam on the side as my meal! The omelette was just ok. It was interesting flavors to it but definitely would not order it again. The crepe was also delicious. If you like hazelnut and/or Nutella, it's a must!\n\nAll their portions are very small (4 donuts, 4 square crepes and 5 inch omelette) so I suggest ordering a bunch and sharing.

Stones Throw is just the most recent addition to this list and, for the most part, it stands triumphant.\n\nThe decor is ultra-minimal (feels like an art gallery without the art), the atmosphere is intimate yet lively, and the service is INCREDIBLE. Perhaps it's just the honeymoon stages of a new restaurant (before exhaustion and tenure lead to jaded indifference), but every employee that we came into contact with was cheerful, friendly, and absolutely on-point. Even the busboys were chatting up a storm with us, asking us our favorite dishes thus far and adding in their recommendations. I'll call out our server, Dave L, specifically, because he was awesome -- our wine and water glasses were always filled; his food descriptions were excellent; and he was honest with us about a couple of dishes to avoid for the night (which I always appreciate).\n\n-----------------------------\nFOOD:\n\nPuffed Potato & Egg = GREAT. Nice crisp, delicious subtle flavor.\n\nDuck Pate w/ Pretzel = GREAT. Smooth and creamy pate, nice salty touch from the pretzel.\n\nSquid Ink Pasta = EXCELLENT. Never had squid ink pasta shells (it's usually in spaghetti or paella form), but this is amazing for squid ink lovers.\n\nGrilled Octopus = GOOD. Good flavor but wasn't grilled enough. I prefer the grilled octopus at Mason Pacific.\n\nPork Belly Salad = EXCELLENT. Perfectly cooked crispy pork belly with a nice sweet kick from the pickled onions.\n\n\"Da Burga\" with Loaded Tater Tots = EXCELLENT. Love the oily brioche bun; the meat was a juicy and perfectly-cooked medium rare; and the loaded tater tots were addicting as hell.\n\nGrilled Rib-Eye = OKAY. This was the one truly disappointing dish of the night -- the rib eye wasn't very tender and the flavors were actually pretty boring. I wish I had listened to my gut and went with the duck that everyone raves about.\n\n-----------------------------\nDESSERTS:\n\nI was on the fence with the desserts because even though I understand and appreciate their idea of adding a fancy twist to old childhood favorites, some of them just didn't really work. \n\nIn particular, the \"Not Your Grandma's Apple Pie\" is a complete deconstruction and then molecular gastronomic reconstruction of \"apple pie\" -- so instead of a warm, crumbly apple pie, it's a cold apple-flavored pot de creme with a crispy wafer roll. It wasn't that the flavors weren't good (they were), but it's just not what I was expecting and I think the dessert is done a disservice by being compared to an apple pie.\n\nThe PB&J donuts were good, but the donuts weren't airy enough. The Oatmeal Cream Pie didn't really stick out as memorable either -- it just tasted like an overly-sweet... well yeah... Oatmeal Cream Pie.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nStones Throw has the potential to be one of the best American Contemporary restaurants in SF. It has the talent, the service, the menu, and actually quite reasonable prices. If it weren't for the Rib Eye and the strangely uninspired desserts, I would've easily given this place a resounding 5 stars. I'll definitely be back though, and I'm pretty confident that once it gets it's gears going, Stones Throw is going to be among the very top of the SF restaurant food chain.", "author": "Roy C."}

It's a bit off the beaten path but San Francisco is a small enough town that the distance is really a non-issue. That said though, my gripe has more to do with my experience at Stones Throw vs. the distance and the food. I went after work on a Wednesday to meet up with two former colleagues of mine, one of whom has eaten there before and highly recommend (demanded) we check it out - needless to say, we were excited to see what all the buzz was about. Upon arrival we were greeted by warm smiles and seated by a friendly host. The meal that ensued was great and our server was the sweetest. No complaints there. Immediately after our meal though, we were told by the manager or perhaps the owner (a seemingly nice gentleman) that other guests needed our table. Being somewhat of a foodie and haven eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world, I was a bit shocked as I have never had this experience before. Not wanting to embarrass the owner, or perhaps more importantly my friend who had presented herself as a regular, I politely complied, paid our $400+ bill, tipped the waitress 24% as she was delightful and deserved it, and walked out of the crowded entrance never to return again...\n\nIn summary, Stones Throw has great food, great service, but unfortunately it's not the place to go if you would like to have a leisurely meal, enjoy dinner and conversation, or be treated like more than just a number... Let's just chalk it up to rising commercial rent prices, a struggling economy, a focus on profitability, or just a bad managerial decision by the owner...no matter what prompted the situation, they lost three otherwise happy customers    :-(", "author": "N A."}

Everything we tried was so delicious and the attention to detail was spectacular. They remodeled the old space and it has a very nice clean/modern yet comfortable and approachable feel to it. \n\nFOOD:\nDuck Pate and Mousse - So delicious! It had a nice twist of mustard in it and served with two small soft pretzels. Very interesting and good.\n\nSunchoke Soup: Very good! It came served with chopped up nuts and crisp apples with a farm fresh egg yolk in the bowl. The server then poured the soup over that to keep it nice and crunchy. The egg gave it a nice creamy texture.\n\nDuck: My friend ordered the duck. It was so juicy and good and I'm not even a duck fan usually. It wasn't too rich or fatty.\n\nChestnut Raviolo: One big giant ravioli filled with goodness. It had some really great roasted root vegetables around it and some nice slices of parmesan around the plate.\n\nAll of the food was impeccably served and had interesting and unique flavors in everything.\n\nSERVICE:\nEverybody from the hostess to every server who came to our table were very friendly, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. You would think they have been open for several months like a well-oiled machine.\n\nLoved the menu and the descriptions of the wine. Even gave a nod to the dirty Geary 38 bus which is hilarious for us locals. Very nice well-rounded wine menu. The dessert menu were all a play on childhood favorite desserts. We were too full to try any.\n\nThe only very minor detail I would like to see there are some candles on the tables. It lacked a bit of warmth from the overall lighting of the restaurant. \n\nCan't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!! Well done Stones Throw!", "author": "Laura A."}

Npt the canned or snarky version you see so often but these people were pleased to have us there, happy to answer questions and a honestly felt \"good night/ thanks for coming by\" upon our departure. IN addition one of the partners in the restaurant came by to check in on us. \n\nFlavorful and Creative Food. We stuck with just the Starters. Pork Belly was done beautifully and not the traditional crunchy but it was further enhanced with spices and avacado. Then the squid ink pasta. Wish we got a double order. BAM! I loved it. Then we had the Grilled Octopus \"Okonomiyaki\" which for both of us was the winner. \n\nWelcoming Atmosphere.

The hostess was really friendly, as was everyone who approached our table whether it was our server, a bus boy, or another server just helping to deliver food. \n\nEverything we ate was really good but the stand out of the night for us was the pork belly & crispy pig's ears. It was sweet and savory and just an all around delicious dish.\n\nMy husband had the burger which had a cool carrot slaw on it and was really good. The stand out with that dish was the fully loaded tots - they tasted like a baked potato with all the good stuff. \n\nI had the corn soup for dinner.  It was sweet and creamy with a couple of little corn coquettes, and crispy chorizo.  A great entree for me, since I was saving room for dessert.\n\nWe shared the chocolate bananas foster for dessert.

He kept saying over and over again that none of their wines were sweet except for one, so we wouldn't have to worry about that, but he couldn't find anything on the (relatively long and decently pricey) wine list that fit what we were looking for. He eventually set us up with a bottle of the fruitiest wine on the menu, which was a mineral-y and frankly dull. \n\nWe started with the duck pat\u00e9 and mousse, and were incredibly underwhelmed. I guess they keep the dish extremely cold to achieve a photogenic, clinically precise cut for those food photographers in the house, but the disk left us both wanting. The pat\u00e9 layer was rock hard, hard to slice, and both the pat\u00e9 and mousse were flavorless. Had the dish been pleasing, the warm pretzels, although lovely, would have been insufficiently large to accommodate the spread, but since the spread was so unappetizing I couldn't even finish my micro-pretzel. The mustard and cornichons tried in vain resuscitate what was a faltering dish, but it was beyond recuperation. \n\nFor mains we ordered the corn ravioli and the duck breast with plum and corn. \n\nThe corn ravioli was stuffed with sweet corn and cheese, yet the pasta skin was hard & chewy around the perimeter. I did like the cheese ball accompaniment on the side. \n\nThe duck breast was also underwhelming. The chef managed to get a perfectly crispy skin, which was lovely, but the sauce was flavorless and I kept encouraging my husband to carefully ration what seemed like a tiny teaspoon of plum and corn such that the sweet accompaniments could last for the entire breast, as the sauce did nothing for the dish and the duck needed sweetness to be palatable. It wouldn't have hurt to add more plum and/or corn to this $30 plate. As it was, it felt meager and sad. \n\nWorst $140 with tax and tip I've spent in SF. \n\nWe ended up going to Za's pizza across the street to share a slice because we left hungry and nauseated after that pat\u00e9, who's lingering flavor I couldn't shake until I had my pizza.", "author": "julia k."}

The room is really beautiful in a spare way, the food is truly inspired, and the service is very attentive.  Even in the very best restaurants, I've found the service to be less intuitive than we had at ST.  Our server always seemed to be on hand when we needed him, but in no way was he intrusive.\n\nSo why not five stars you ask.  The noise.  When we first arrived, we actually had to consult one another on whether we'd be able to stand the noise level during what we'd hoped would be a quiet dinner to talk and catch up on our weeks.  I was ready to leave; my husband said we should sit down and give it a try.  I do not understand why a restaurant of that caliber feels the need to play loud rock music.  It was totally out of sync with the experience.  Someone must have asked for the music volume to be turned down, because a little while later they did lower it.  The people at the next table then were able to stop screaming, deafening us and making it impossible to have a conversation, so we could then talk.\n\nStill, being near the bar, as the evening wore on, that area got very crowded and the noise level went back up to, if not above, what it had been.  It was an easy decision to say no to dessert; our ears just couldn't take it any more.\n\nBottom line, we may go back (to try sitting in the back room and hope it's quieter), but there are enough other fantastic restaurants in the immediate vicinity where I won't be cringing in anticipation of the noise factor; so, honestly, we'll probably take our business elsewhere.", "author": "Stephen K."}

I'm kicking myself for not saying something to the manager right then and there. To give an example:  Was asked 4, yes 4 times in 10 minutes if we wanted dessert (we clearly hadn't even looked and were still enjoying our bottle of wine).  Waiter was visibly frustrated that he couldn't turn our table and the either GM or owner who was inappropriately working front of the house, was doing the same.  This put a damper on being able to enjoy the different dishes, wine, and desserts we ordered. \n\nThe wine list is confusing in that it is in groupings, but no explanation of what those groupings are (Example: The header of one of the groups talks about having wine that will make you feel better after getting off of a dirty city bus...not very helpful in terms of flavor profile).  Upon asking the waiter for wine recommendations, he picked 2 of the most expensive (hello...you are upselling) and then gasped when I picked something else.  Dessert menu is the same.  No explanation of what the desserts actually are.\n\nVery young, energetic crowd and while the space is better than Luella, it still leaves something to be desired.  \n\nQuick overview:\nOrdered potato puffs, squid ink pasta, duck breast entree, peanut butter and jelly beignets, and their \"cheese course\" which was a comte crepe.  The crepe was the only thing that was not good (and I love cheese).  Everything else was delicious, but could have been hotter.\n\nExtensive beer and wine list.  Good luck sifting through the wine list on your own (and try not to get our waiter if you want any help at all). \n\nMy dinner date and I had 3 different \"wine cocktails\" (made with sherry, vermouth, and homemade Pimm's), they were good, but real cocktails would have been better.\n\nOverall, won't go back due to the unsophisticated service and inability to enjoy the experience. Unfortunate, because the food is really good.  To put things into perspective, went to The Cavalier last week and spent more time there, but had amazing service despite the place being packed.

THe mains bursted with flavor and had a lot of items one couldn't find elsewhere.\n\nThe Food: I tried the puffed potato and egg, smoked salmon mousse, the hawaiian bread pudding, and the duck confit hash. The puffed potato and egg, was a bit underwhelming. It was good, but had room for improvement. The smoked salmon mousse was very good. A bit reminiscent of a smoked salmon cream cheese, but the pickled red onions made all the difference for me. The duck confit hash was the best I had tried. The eggs came out a bit runny looking, but once all mixed together, it was perfect. Paired with a charred piece the bread, the dish had a very sophisticated flavor profile. The kicker for me was the hawaiian bread pudding! Wow, I had never seen a dish like this before, especially for brunch. The bread pudding was not too mushy, not too firm, but very supple. The sauce added good sweetness and salt, with the nuttiness of the macadamia  to top it off. This dish was my favorite and I'd highly recommend it.\n\nThe service: We went for brunch around 11:45a on a Sunday. No wait, but we sat at the bar. I guess reservations might be a smart thing to do. Wait staff was nice, a bit slow on everything, but nothing terrible.\n\nThe ambience: Warm, clean, and simple, the interior at Stones Throw was very appealing. Glass windows opening up to the neighborhood on Russian Hill with the cable cars passing by were very nice. Bartenders on the side mixing carafes of delicious looking drinks excellently prepared. Great location for a date or for guests.\n\nOverall: The main dishes were great, I would definitely want to go back. I want to try their dinner menu as well. The mains popped with flavor and the setting was too nice to pass up. I'd definitely recommend this place to someone without hesitation.", "author": "Andy C."}

Waiter greeted us, and offered several bottles of wine. I inquired about the wine by the glass a few times but he kept pointing to the bottle. Finally I explained my friend was not drinking and I was allowed to move forward with the single glass. \n\nYou are strongly encouraged to put all of your order in at the same time. We wanted to see the portions and general feel of the food and enjoy the dinner in a slow way, so we ordered the appetizers first. He mentioned he could give us more time, and said the kitchen highly recommended that we put them all in. It was awkward and pushy enough that it was clear we wouldn't be having our whole dinner there. Honestly, I think we just rubbed him the wrong way. Two people, at his four top, 10 minutes late, starting out with appetizers and not a full bottle of wine? In my serving days, I would have been annoyed with us. \n\nSo, I can only comment on the two apps I had. \n\nThe puffed egg thing: This was pretty delicious and the texture was great. I think the base of the recipe could still be played around with, while keeping the main feature. \n\nThe Pork Belly: In general, I try to avoid this fatty meat. However, this was absolutely divine and a treat. The flavors that went into it and each item contributed to the best taste in my mouth all day. I would recommend this place to any girl who has a man in her life who always orders this fatty meat. \n\nFour stars: \n+The pork belly\n+I think the waiter with 99% of people is gregarious and a really great person.

I was basically furious, hungover, and HANGRY as hell by the time we sat down to eat.

Dungeness crab salad was good but not amazing. For mains, we shared the squid ink pasta, which was quite memorable and definitely good for sharing due its incredible richness. I thought the bur-ga was a little too much in terms of salty fatty punch. Likewise, the stuffed tater tots were a bit much for me.

A bit too rare for me.

The restaurant itself seems pretty standard SF yuppie (not a putdown just a statement - I'm a card-carrying member) - reclaimed wood tables, high ceilings, and those half-silver-painted clear light bulbs.\n\nThe food offerings are not very vegetarian friendly and were overall hit or miss - like other reviews have mentioned, the squid ink pasta was very good (first time I've had non-linguine squid-ink pasta!).  On the other hand, the grilled squid was not that great - similar to Nopa, they seem to slow cook it in a pouch (I'm know what its called but that word sounds ridiculous), turning the normally chewy octopus into more of a fish cake.  No more trying grilled squid at \"Contemporary American\" restaurants. \n\nFinally, in keeping with the SF yuppie comment, prices are high (small dishes $8+, mains $25+, bottled beers $20+) and portions are small (we expect to order ~4 dishes per 2 people).

We made a last minute res for 2 people at 7:45 on OpenTable and called the restaurant to see if we could fit a third person in. The man who answered the phone was incredibly nice and told us he wasn't sure since their tables for 2 are really meant for only 2, but he'd call us back if he could make it happen. Ten minutes later he called back saying he had a table for 3 at 8pm. When we arrived, we learned that he was one of the owners which made us feel great as he really accommodated us even though we were so last minute. A woman stopped by to answer any questions about the wine list and she was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, leading us to choose an absolutely delicious bottle of wine. We later found out she's also one of the owners - love when owners of restaurants are nice and caring people!\n\nWe ordered the puffed potato & eggs (very unique, delicious flavor. I enjoyed the cauliflower/crispy chicken skin topping a bit more than the actual potato puff itself), a tomato butter bean with olives and buffalo mozzarella dish that came with toast (a little spicy, but phenomenal - we had to ask for extra toast to sop up all the delicious flavor! The chef actually saw us waving down the waitress and came over to us personally to help us out - again, such a nice feeling when the people who work there are so nice), the squid ink pasta (omg seriously so good... we ordered a second serving of it after we ate our entrees because all three of us were still craving it. Lemony, tangy flavor), the duo of ribeye and short ribs (super delicious, but a bit small to share amongst 3 of us) and da burger (holy moly it's gotta be like a bazillion calories but worth every bite.

Atmosphere feels like a Polk Street retread. The service was so so. \n\nEverything that we tried on the menu lacked flavor - and for the price, you gotta deliver. Dishes sound creative, but when you eat them, they lack any sort of cohesion or discernable approach. Lots of pouring sauces on things and talking about the dish via the waitstaff - and it doesn't deliver. \n\nThe best thing we had was the duck, which was extraordinary and rich. The Octopus was handled well, but then coated with this insanely intrusive BBQ sauce on top of a flavorless pancake that didn't fit at all. You're better off eating BBQ chicken and latkes. Fava Pasta was so subtle, it didn't exist. Needed salt. Puffed Potato and eggs - also relatively flavorless. Duck Pate and Mousse was pretty great - a few flakes of salt could have taken this to a whole new place. Dessert - Bananas Foster was just really rich. The PB&J Donuts were pretty disgusting and flavorless. \n\nDon't be fooled by the menu - it sounds great and doesn't deliver.  Come here for an ok, overpriced meal.", "author": "M. P."}

I live less than two blocks from Stones throw, I was there for the pre opening and I have been back twice.  To be sure.  To be absolutely sure.  Because I wanted to like this place.  I really really did.\n\nBut I don't.  I have lots of feelings about them but like is not one of them.  For the neighboorhood opening, they served appetizers, only one of which would actually be on the real menu, and that was okay, they were heavy handed with the salt but still, I couldn't wait to come back for dinner.  We didn't make it back for a few months so we thought the place would be up and swinging by then. What they were was RUDE.  Starting with the host, who acted like we were insulting him because we didn't have a reservation.  Then he minced about like he was in physical pain trying to find a table on a Tuesday night.  Really?  I can see you are not full, you just ACCEPTED a reservation for 15 minutes from now in FRONT of me and I already said we would be happy to sit at the bar where there were plenty of seats.  What saved the night was the food.  We had some good food, not revolutionary, not overly creative, but it was good.  We really liked the pate and the puffs with chicken skin.  \n\nSo we decided to come back and just see if it was a rude fluke and to determine if the food was something we would want again.  But NO!  Even MORE rude host AND bartender, who both acted like everyone in the place was more important than us.  The host gave a glass of champagne and a menu to two couples who came in after us but ignored us.  WTF?.  We ordered drinks from the bartender who promptly ignored us to make drinks to two other people who ordered after is while we watched and waited.  WTactualF?  Then we ordered the tomato cream crackers and the puffs.  Awful!  Who is making those tomato cream disasters?  The puffs were bland, no crispy chicken skin in sight which was what made them special.\n\nSo food is average at best, attitudes stink and rudeness abounds.  Never Again.

I briefly mentioned that in the reservation notes and they had a cute hand-written \"Happy Birthday Tim\" card put at our table and added a birthday candle to our dessert. Thank you! That was very sweet!\n\nThe restaurant is very classy, clean, modern, and very nice without feeling pretentious. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. And the food is presented beautifully and everything tasted amazing. \n\nWe started the meal with their very popular \"snack\", Puff potato & eggs. They're these airy potato puffs filled with runny egg yolk on a bed of cauliflower cous cous. Definitely a must get dish here.\n\n Next, we shared the Brentwood corn risotto and it was soooo goood. I LOVE corn, so this was a great dish for me. The sweet corn was the star of the dish and it also had truffle and mushrooms - both went really well with the corn risotto. The starter dish was quite small, but it was enough for a light starter for two people.\n\nOn to the main dish, I had the crispy skinned wild striped bass with shrimp dumplings, and my boyfriend ordered the prime beef ribeye. Both dishes were presented beautifully and were very flavorful. The fish had a crispy skin and was served on a really fragrant broth - it also came with two shrimp dumplings that reminded me of chinese dimsum, har gows. Every element of the dish was seasoned well and by the end of the main dish, I was stuffed! The beef ribeye dish was also very good - the beef was tender and also seasoned well.\n\nDessert! For dessert, we decided to order two to share. I read lots of great reviews on the Peanut butter & jelly donuts dessert, so we definitely wanted to try that. In addition, we also ordered the Campfire s'mores dessert. The dessert menu is comprised of elevated versions of popular childhood snacks/sweets (such an adorable idea). The peanut butter & jelly donuts was our absolute favorite! The donuts are fluffy and lightly sweetened and the peanut butter, jelly, and chocolate was delicious for dipping. The Stones Throw staff also had a candle and a birthday message on this dessert for my boyfriend - it was a surprise for him and myself (Thanks again for making dinner so special)! The campfire s'mores had a interesting smokey taste, it actually tasted like it was roasted over a campfire! This dessert had roasted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham cracker on a bed of chocolate cake. Highly suggest this dish to all chocolate lovers and sweet tooth's out there! \n\nOverall, we had a very nice meal here.The prices are also decent, it's a great place to experience a high-end meal without paying a fortune.

Stones throw is a small neighborhood place, and the whole vibe goes well with the area. The space is small, and the bar area isn't too big, so definitely make a reservation!  Warning: parking can be a bit tricky around here. \n\nWe were seated as soon as our whole party arrived.\n\nWines were very reasonably priced. We started with a half bottle of a sparkling brut rose at $27, then 2 full bottles of Pinot noir (a lighter California one to start, then a more full bodied French one for the more substantial dishes).  Each bottle was around $50, which I found reasonable.\n\nOnto food:\n- Potato puffs: a light airy potato ball with runny egg yolk inside??? Why are there only 4 per order ? We debated getting another order as dessert \n- Pork belly and crisped pig ear:  the curry really made the dish. It had lots of textures and colors and is one of those dishes where you really want the perfect bite with all the components \n- Squid Ink pasta: I kind of wish the pasta had a bit more of a bite, and a little crunch would have been nice for this dish, but the pasta itself was a beautiful black color, and the flavors were subtle and nice  \n- Grilled octopus: grilled nicely, not overdone, good char. White beans are fine, but the chorizo bits underneath were amazing \n- Scallops: seared sweet with lots of spring vegetables on the side; this was a great lighter dish \n- 38 North duck breast and thigh: tender, not too gamey, mild Asian flavors with black rice and vegetables. I usually don't like duck, but this one wasn't bad\n- Toad in the hole lasagna: basically we got this for the confit egg yolk. The lasagna itself could have used more salt and was a bit soft, but the Parmesan crisp on top made up for it. If only there were more of that crisp... (We debated asking for more....)\n\nDesserts: you're instructed to write your own favorite treat on the menu, and if your idea is picked for try next rendition of the menu, they bring you back for free dessert !\n- Lemon meringue: tart, I liked the berry with it. It was smooth and light overall\n- Apple pie: interesting version with apple granita, panna cotta, and a crisped straw on top\n- Chocolate bananas foster: this was the best dessert by far. Milkshake in chocolate, chocolate cake, amazing warm bananas with rum sauce which helps to melt the ice cream and milk shake so that it's one gooey hot and cold dessert. This was probably one of my favorite desserts in SF \n\nOverall, it's very low key. Our server had a great sense of humor. The tables are tighter along the sides of the restaurant, but the center is nice and open for a view of the kitchen.  Prices weren't bad.\n\nAgain, love the neighborhood feel.

The restaurant is beautifully designed and felt warm and homey. We were promptly seated after we arrived. Every single person who works at Stones Throw is polite, courteous, knowledgable, helpful, and happy! I love this, because I feel that it translates directly into the experience you have. The service is impeccable! My twin sister and I enjoyed every minute of our dining experience.\nAs for the food, WOW. I am still having daydreams about the duck and grilled octopus. And my sister's beef ribeye was phenomenal. We also tried the duck pate, dungeness crab salad, puffed potato and eggs, and the sunchoke soup. Everything was delicious and extremely pleasing to the eye thanks to Jason's signature plating. It's hard to describe how good something tastes in a review; you'll just have to come and try for yourself :).\nUnfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, but we will definitely be back for the deconstructed Apple Pie that I keep hearing so many good things about! They even ask you for a childhood favorite to potentially add to the changing dessert menu! \nAs for attire, I think casual-trendy is the way to go! \nAnd as for parking, I would not try to park in the neighborhood, as it is extremely difficult to find a spot. \nI will be back!!!!!!!!!!! :) \n(Congrats Jason!)", "author": "Corrina S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-12", "description": "No one could say the food here is not phenomenal. Every dish is a treat, from the creamy duck pate with mini pretzel rolls to the deliciously tender octopus. \n\nBut the portions are tiny. The service is mediocre. And the decor feels half-finished somehow.\n\nWe got off to a shaky start: We set a reservation for 8:15pm, arrived at 8:18pm, and were seated around 8:45pm. To pass the time, my friend and I asked our waiter to recommend a wine. He brought out a Chianti; I was dubious, but agreed. And unfortunately it was sweet and light -- the complete opposite of dry and full-bodied, as I'd described. At that point the manager came by to offer us champagne to apologize for the delay, but we'd ordered our drinks already. Wish he'd come by earlier...\n\nMy friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share, to sample a bit of everything. \n- SALT-ROASTED BEETS WITH BURRATA = Came with 3 crackers (not ideal for our table of 4) and some minced beets mixed in with burrata. This was my least-favorite dish of the night -- a bit sweet for my taste. It was also tiny. $8\n- PUFFED POTATO AND EGGS = Again bite-sized, but crazy delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside, with oozing yolk inside, served on some creamy cauliflower mousse. Wish there were a few more of these! $8\n- DUCK PATE AND MOUSSE = Still dreaming about this. The creamiest, most delectable duck pate ever. Unfortunately, it was served with 2 (only 2!!!!!) mini pretzel rolls. Our table of 4 had to slice each of these pretzel rolls in half so we could each get half a bite of bread. Which brings me to my next point: Why skimp on the bread? In fact, why didn't the restaurant start us out with a basket of bread? I just felt a bit ... deprived at this point, considering the prices we were paying.  $8\n- SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA = One of the star dishes of the night. This is listed as a starter but could easily serve as an entree. The veggies were so tender, the flavor was rich and the pasta was perfectly cooked al dente. $16\n- GRILLED OCTOPUS = Raved about for a reason. As others have said before me, it's the the most tender octopus I've ever had. Mixed in with chorizo, lemon and white beans, it was just perfection. $16\n- CRISPY DUCK = Crackling skin clung to juicy (without being fatty) pieces of duck on top of moist black rice. Really tasty. $28\n- CHESTNUT RAVIOLO = Not as flavorful as I imagined, considering its ingredients (chanterelle mushrooms, roasted brussels sprouts and truffle butter), but still really good. But there were only two pieces of ravioli. $22\n\nQuite an expensive dinner for very little food. Honestly though, if the environment suited the prices, I wouldn't have minded. The walls were pretty bare (I understand they've only been open for 6 weeks, so I'll cut them some slack on this one), but the tacky red flooring (reminiscent to my elementary school cafeteria) was unforgivable. There was just nothing special enough about the decor or overall dining experience to justify the bill.\n\nI will give Stones Throw the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just need a few more weeks to get their sh** together. But for the time being, the food is this restaurant's only saving grace.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

The staff person that came out was very rude and we also saw her arguing with customers on the doneness of their chicken (we could see that it was raw, yet this person was explaining to the guests that the chef prepared it that way!) On the so-called cheddar fondue -- this dish is nothing more than velveeta, char grilled toast and 3 brussel sprouts -- a food cost dream for the restauranteur, but a consumer nightmare -- $8 for something that cost the restaurant less than 50 cents.

The drink options were plentiful, the food was amazing and the service was great. \n\nTo drink, we had some champagne and the Pinot Blanc, both of which were fantastic. \n\nFor starters, we had the pate, the pork belly salad, the squid ink pasta and the puffed potato. All of these starters were amazing. I have always thought I hated pate, but their pate was incredible and completely changed my mind about pate. The yogurt sauce on the pork belly salad was so delicious and everything about the squid ink pasta was incredible. I highly recommend each and every one of those starters.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered the burger, the rib eye and the ravioli. The burger was absolutely incredible. I consider myself to be a total burger snob and this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. Plus, it comes with amazing tater tots on the side. The rib eye was good, but you can probably get good rib eye at several other restaurants in SF, so I would recommend trying one of their other more unique dishes instead of ordering the rib eye. And lastly, the ravioli was fantastic. You only get two of them (stacked on top of each other with some vegatables filling out the rest of the plate), but they are very large. We split the ravioli amongst three of us and we all felt like there was enough for us each to get a good taste of the dish. \n\nFor dessert we had the deconstructed applie pie and the PB&J donuts. I absolutely loved the donuts (especially the peanut butter caramel sauce that was on the side) and I thought the applie pie was good (although not my favorite). \n\nI really liked the layout of the restaurant. Some restaurants try to crowd as many tables as possible into their space, but Stones Throw does not do that. The tables are spaced very nicely so that you don't feel like you are eating right on top of the table next to you. And while the place was full and there were a lot of people waiting in the bar area, I never felt like it got noisy at all, which was great. I hate when you go to a restaurant and the noise level is so bad that you can hardly hear the people at your own table. \n\nI also really liked the service. Everyone exhibited just the right amount of attentiveness. I don't like when servers are too attentive and come to the table every couple minutes to check on you. At Stones Throw they seem to have mastered the ability to be attentive enough that you aren't ever waiting too long for someone to take your order or bring your drinks, but to also know when to leave you alone and let you enjoy your dinner. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. The food is amazing and the service is great. And I also think that you get a great value for your money. Most of the small plates were $7 or $8, which is a great price considering how delicious they were.", "author": "Jillean D."}

Cold, entitled, and unwelcoming, and like pulling teeth to get recommendations on wine or favorite dishes. This type of service is fine for a diner, but for the high quality of this restaurant it makes a significant disconnect. The complimentary dish sent out since we inquired about it,\nbut didn't order it, was a nice effort to make up for lack of effort, and clearly one knows that it can be credited for an extra tip on top of the 20- but it's times like this I wished I didn't have my industry hat on, because it wasn't well deserved.\n\nTo compliment the hard work and craft of these chefs, the service really needs to be at the same caliber, and it made this experience so hard to swallow. Would I go back? Absolutely for the food, but it's been months since, and my reluctance seems to have gotten the best of me.", "author": "F S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-20", "description": "The restaurant is smaller in terms of available seating. We had a 6:45 reservation but tables weren't leaving at the rate expected, so we ended up standing at the bar for 35 minutes. However, the host was extremely cognizant of the situation. After 10-15 minutes he brought over some complimentary sparkling wine. After 20 minutes, we were starving so we put in a small plate order, which was also comped. Issues like this happen in restaurants all the time, so to know that they cared and were working on a solution put us in a good mood on what could have otherwise lessened our entire meal experience. While we were waiting, I did order the Tai One On cocktail, which was reminiscent of a French 75, tart with just the right about of bubbly. For the small plate we ordered the puffed potato & eggs, served atop cauliflower puree, chives and crispy chicken skin. The chicken skin almost tastes like bacon, so it's no surprise this dish also appears on the brunch menu.\n\nWhen we got seated we order some wine after requesting recommendations from the server, who was very helpful. We ordered pretty much every small plate on the menu. My favorite after the potatoes was the salt roasted beets with burrata, lemon and crackers. I hadn't had beets served with a citrus twist before and it really complemented the sweetness of the beets. The Dungeness crab salad with artichoke chips, garlic cream and anchovies was surprisingly flavorful. The duck pate and mousse was a pleasant surprised. The pate and mousse were layer and it was server with warm pretzel balls, so the pate melted right on like butter. The starter plate we ordered (not to be confused with the \"small\" plates) was the squid ink pasta and was my favorite dish of the night. It was well balanced and even though the dish included calamari, clams and capers it wasn't overwhelmingly seafood tasting. My second favorite dish of the night was actually their burger. It comes with all the fixings and thick layer of cheddar cheese. The end result is that it basically melts in your mouth the second you bite in. If you're a burger fan, this is not one to miss. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts popping up on \"Best Burger in SF\" lists in the future (along with the totally under the radar burger from Bistro AIX). The burger comes with stuffed tater tots, which are amazing. We also ordered a ravioli main dish which looks like it's not longer featured on the menu, which is fine because it was under-whelming and forgettable (I think it was pumpkin or chestnut maybe?). We didn't end up ordering any dessert as we were way too full by this point but I adore their concept behind the dessert menu. All patrons are asked to fill out a piece of paper at the end of the meal with their favorite childhood dessert. If the chef feels inspired by your suggestion, an upscale, modernized version could appear on the menu. Current desserts include chocolate bananas foster, apple pie and peanut butter and jelly donuts.\n\nOverall the meal was pretty affordable if you're following the \"sharing is caring\" philosophy. We ordered about half the menu plus several glasses of wine and didn't feel bad when we say the check. I'm adding Stone's Throw to my list of favorite neighborhood spots and can't wait to go back any see what kind of spin they take on brunch.", "author": "Larisa J."}

I wish all the dishes are like that.\n\nPork Belly and Crispy Pig Ears\nPork belly reminds me of roast pork from China town, only more tender and without the crispy skin.

No. Feels rather gimmicky actually.\n\nCorn soup\nYou get about a tea cup size for $12. \n\nCrispy Duck Breast & Rillette \"Taquito\"\nThe taquitos were cold inside, probably because they were made ahead of time and just not heated through before serving.\n\nPrime NY Steak\nCompetent, good quality meat. The sides were uninspiring.\n\nFava Ravioli\nThe ravioli was filled with grinded up fava bean, the dish was decorated with whole fava bean, with a light green sauce made of fava bean and butter. Overall rather bland. I would not cook like this at home. Why do I want to pay $22 for 4 of these ravioli?\n\nIt was so bad that we decided to skip dessert and go somewhere else. Definitely not what I had hope going to a $$$ restaurant.\n\nI feel that this restaurant is following some formula trying to maximize its profit with least amount of work. Cool decor. Fusion recipe. Nice presentation. Good service. Portions were small so you can order more dishes. Most dishes were made ahead in big batches and simply assembled right before serving.

We sat right by the kitchen, so I kept seeing TONS of people order the little potato puff balls and the burger.  Next time I come, those are 100% on my list!!

We give our name to the hostess and she says she'll call if a spot opens at the bar. We mosey on down to Bacchus Wine Bar to wait it out and I tell my husband there's no way we'll hear from them.\n\nLo and behold, the hostess (I think her name was Tyler?, she was blond and nice) actually calls and tells us 2 spots are opening up at the bar soon. Just her calling us on a  Friday night impressed the hell out of me. \n\nLong story short - the 2 women we were waiting for to leave so we could eat at the bar didn't leave for over an hour! We just hung out, had a glass of wine, and pointedly looked at them occasionally. Finally, we sit at the bar - nice and roomy - no one crowding us. \n\nOrdered the squid ink pasta - amazing, fresh, interesting flavors, highly recommend. The ricotta salad - really terrific flavors, all green, yummy little bursts of flavor in every bite. The NY Steak - again, it just tasted SO good. \n\nWe made sure to save room for dessert b/c I saw someone order the bananas foster and it smelled so good I ordered salad for my meal so I would have room for it. Turns out that dessert was the BEST DESSERT we've ever had. It was phenomenal. I would go back every night just for the dessert.\n\nWe're happy as clams because the food was so good and the hostess and rest of staff really treated us well. Then, we get the bill. And it just gets better because they comped us 2 glasses of wine, a dessert, and gave us a 10% neighbor discount. Above and beyond what they needed to do.\n\nI can't wait to go back. They know how to treat patrons, especially locals, the food was so much better than some of the overhyped restaurants I've been to recently, and you actually felt like it was a good value.

We started with the cauliflower egg puffs, which were different and delicious.  A great snack to whet your appetite.  Then we moved to the duck pate/ mousse snack. I LOVE pate, and this did not disappoint.  It is served with soft pretzel style-rolls and cornichons and everything about it is lovely- from the taste to the presentation.  The portion is more than fair considering the price and the listing as a \"snack\".  We moved on to apps after this, settling on the pork belly citrus salad and the squid ink pasta.  The pork belly salad had a nice mix of savory meat, citrus, veggies (rainbow kale, how SF) and crispiness- the salad was topped with crispy pig's ears.  Now, for me, the showstopper was the pasta.  It was perfection. The pasta itself was delicate and flavorful- clearly homemade.  It was topped with pickled kale, shrimp, mussels, and clams and was in a clam sauce and cauliflower mousse.  I can't really describe how much I hearted this dish.  I live in the area and can easily foresee myself having this pasta and a glass of wine solo at the bar.  Like, regularly.  Between these 4 dishes and the delish bread, we didn't feel like we needed to try an entree... so we skipped straight to dessert and shared the pb&j beinets.  I'm not much of a sweets gal, but these were good.  \n\nNow, for the service.  It got off to a slightly rocky start- we had made reservations weeks prior, but still ended up waiting 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We ordered a bottle of wine and hung out at the standing bar table, where there were two other couples who were in the same boat- reservations, but no available tables.  Not sure what that was all about.  Also not sure why the other two couples were given snacks as a thank-you-for-waiting thing and we weren't, but whatever.  Maybe they were waiting even longer?  If so, Stone's Throw really needs to step up their reservation game.  So while at the communal table, after the other couples were sat, I spilled a glass of wine.  Super embarrassing.  It was just one of those things where I was talking and not paying attention and just set the glass down wrong.  It wasn't a huge deal- the glass was only a third full and didn't break or spill on the floor- just on the table.  I apologized profusely, but the waiter gave me some 'tude.  I know, I'm the jerk here, but seriously, not that big of a deal.  When we finally were seated, our waitress was great... super friendly and nice, and knowledgeable about the food.  Her recommendations seemed sincere and she actually seemed excited to be there.  I liked that.\n\nOverall, the restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood and I'm excited to go back.  If the reservations snafus are figured out, I'd be happy to increase my stars.", "author": "Mallori M."}

My husband and I have been here on four separate occasions and we always leave full and impressed. I always try to enjoy their cocktails because they work without liquor. Having said that I've never tried one I didn't fully enjoy. If you have the time and budget for sweets at the end make sure to try not your grandma's apple pie. Simply amazing!!", "author": "Monica T."}

The appetizers and entrees called out on Yelp live up to their billing. The dessert is the weakest link (and not even truly weak) --concept is cute, but give me a childhood fave straight up any day.", "author": "Midori S."}

Dishes felt really fresh and healthy, but not too flavorful.  Waited  a long time  for food to be served, but probably because they were preparing each dish with care.", "author": "Yvonne H."}

Absolutely loved the grilled octopus, amazing how it was not rubbery and had a great, meaty taste.  Loved the cocktails, too, try the one that Pimm's and something.", "author": "Grant R."}

The pork belly and the da burga were also delicious but the burger and the tater tots were a bit too salty eaten together. Everything was perfectly cooked. Service was wonderful, our waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations from the menu. I really liked the space too!", "author": "lisa a."}

We started off with a couple orders of the corn soup, accented with bacon and crunchy bits of cornbread and Ana amazing soft shell crab starter. All were very very good--well seasoned, balanced and beautifully plated. My dad and I had the Salmon (it's that time of year) with peas, radish, and other farmers market items and my stepmom had the burger with some high end tater tots. Suffice it to say that we all cleaned our plates. As for drinks, they have a great beer list, and even a couple unique ciders. We tried a bunch of different ones, including a tasty pear cider. Our waiter was great, professional but warm and genuine. The only complaint I have is that it took a while to get the food out. We probably say for 20 minutes before we got our starters. No bread, etc. we then sat another 20 minutes for our mains. Kitchens get backed up; I get it. But that's a bit too long of a gap. Probably an off night. Apart from the timing issue, an awesome meal. Highly recommend. Also, v cool that they give you five percent off when you uber over. Nice bonus for us.", "author": "Paul R."}

I'm pretty confident it is the best brunch place I've ever been to. At this point, I think I've tried just about everything on the menu. My favorites are the duck hash, lemon/huckleberry crepes, pancakes, and of course the potato/egg yolk puffs.  I'm not typically a huge duck fan bc it can be fatty, but this dish is unbelievable! The duck is crisp and packed with flavor (I'm not taste-expert, but it reminds me of a variation on corned beef) which goes great with the eggs, biscuit and veggies all mixed in. The pancakes are huge and buttery - I had no idea it was possible to make such thick and fluffy pancakes!! The lemon crepes with huckleberries are a great blend of sweet and tart and soooo delicious! The potato puffs are also on the dinner menu (and if you look through the reviews, you'll see everyone raves about them), and for brunch they are served with bacon bits (I'm a firm believer that bacon makes everything better)!  This place is the greatest- I recommend it to everyone!!", "author": "Bonnie G."}
