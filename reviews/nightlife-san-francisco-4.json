Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the overall experience, and the entrance fee reduction from the daytime is pretty much moot because you'll likely be ordering one of the 13+ dollar drinks at the bar anyway. \n\nIf you decide to visit, keep a close eye on the exhibit closing times. The rainforest exhibit closes at 7:30PM. We didn't even realize there was a cutoff time for any of the exhibits so we ended up missing out on one of the bigger, better (IMO) exhibits in CAS. The last Planetarium showing is at 8:30PM, which we also missed because tickets ran out early and the stand-by line was so long we didn't see a point in waiting.\n\nNot to say that there aren't some cool things to learn, and there were quite a few 'freebies' being passed out for the 'Sharktober' themed night (free face painting, spinning the wheel for prizes like free tickets, etc.). I still thought the most impressive exhibit was probably the aquarium!", "author": "Sherry L."}

But if you're living it up as a 20-something tech wageist or it's your College Friday on one of the theme nights, it might work out(?)\n\nI wanna say it's been almost a decade since they've been throwing these After Dark Nights at the Academy. More than enough time to shoot my own shot on one of those awkward dates everyone was on last night but thankfully those chances came and went.\n\nI can't speak for the daytime experience, but I was over it close to hour in. So again, imagine having to entertain company with that level of interest.\n\nTo fight that, let me highlight the things you need to get to first: the Butterfly/Rainforest Room and the Planetarium Show. Both you have to fall in line for, another you need tickets to get access to. Do these first and you'll be left to your own leisure to find that viewing bubble in the Aquarium to makeout or have an argument in.\n\nNot a lot of food choices unless you're really into loaded nachos or museum sushi. They don't seem to have a lot of drink specialties either; so you're better off ordering your regular liquorXsoda cocktail to keep you happy walking around.\n\nAt least I can say BTDT to the whole NightLife thing. I really do think you get more out of it in the daytime though: Conservatory of Flowers, joggers' routes, etc. just outside the premise; but we all know where the real \"Nite Lyfe\" in sf lives....\n\nMake it and Rake it when those nights happen =)", "author": "Jason A."}

There is generally less of a crowd and you can purchase alcohol (the drinks are kind of expensive though). I would say to try to get there on the earlier side as the jungle dome closes at 8pm. Also, I would recommend going straight to the planetarium and waiting in line as soon as you can! The planetarium and the aquarium floor is definitely the highlights of this museum in my opinion.

I've been to the CA Academy of Sciences multiple times before, but never to NightLife. It's great that the ticket prices are half of what they charge for daytime, but we didn't have access to the second floor. I'm not sure if that was because there was a private event going on upstairs or if that's always the case. They had different stations with themed drinks, all of which were not very good but hey it got us buzzed. We couldn't go into the rainforest dome with drinks so we waited until both of us finished ours...but by the time we did, we found out the rainforest had been closed even though it was nowhere near the end of NightLife :( So we went downstairs to the aquarium and spent about an hour there. A little crowded but it wasn't too bad. The planetarium seating was all full as well so I'd recommend just buying a ticket for $3 if you're into that sort of thing.

You can either buy your tickets online or at the door. But if you do decide to buy at the door, they don't sell the tickets until 5:30pm. I purchased my tickets online from Viator but you could of course purchase directly from the museum. If you purchase through another website, you'll have to redeem your tickets at the service desk located on the right side of the entrance. They will not let you redeem beforehand so you have to get them at 5:30! \n\nMy friends and I went last night and it just so happened to be one of their special event nights. The museum has one of those every now and then so be sure to check the website for more information! Staff was super friendly and helpful. They offered to print my online voucher for me so it would be easier to redeem them later on. They also advised us to get in line at 5:30 since the line was going to be long. We got in line at around 5:45 and the line was already starting to wrap around the building! But honestly, the line looked long but it went by super quick. \n\nSome tips:\n-it's a 21+ event so bring your ID. They won't let you in without it!\n-if you plan on watching a show at the planetarium, get in line to get the tickets first since it's a really popular attraction \n-last call for the rainforest is at 7:45\n-plenty of street parking but you can only park there till 10\n-there's a parking garage on concourse way (which is where I parked) with plenty of parking spaces.

Nightlife is from 6-10 on Thursdays and it's 21+, complete with a number of mars throughout the museum. Every nightlife is a different \"theme\" so you can either just go to go, or go depending on theme. Sometimes the themes make it busier than other nights, for example when they did a food theme (my previous review) which sold out and was PACKED. \n\nFirst things first, when you go in, you definitely want to go straight to the Rainforest exhibit because it's the first thing to close down, I forget if it's 7:30 or 8, but you don't want to miss it! It's VERY humid, so be prepared. It was filled with beautiful butterflies, greenery, and a view of the large fish below. The rainforest exits into the aquarium portion of the museum, so you can either go here next, or if you're like us and you're interested in seeing the planetariums awesome shows, I would go and grab a pass for the shows first before they run out. Our show time was at 7:30, so it left us time to then go visit the living roof terrace before sundown and then see the aquarium after our galaxy show. There are a number of other booths set up and exhibits as well, such as the famous albino alligator, a trivia night going on when we went, etc. \n\nAll in all, definitely worth the price and experience!", "author": "Maleah M."}

They also make an effort to liven up the museum, for example by having a DJ in the central atrium, relative to the rather stodgy and institutional atmosphere that it takes on during the day. \n\nKiddos, this is a great way to support quality institutions like the Academy, which is a highly accessible and informative 4-in-1 experience (planetarium, rainforest, aquarium, natural history museum).", "author": "Vincent L."}

The tricky part was finding/making the time, and after a year of excuses, I attended the feline night a few weeks back.\n\nThey offered matching-themed drinks and special events throughout the night with visits from the local SPCA, a lynx kitten, and a serval. The wild cats were absolutely not having it, being paraded and gushed over, leaving me with internal strife on their cuteness and simultaneous imprisonment. I decided it was best to move on and see the rest of the academy. \n\nThe indoor jungle dome is brilliant and the starring attraction, but we realized it closed early and didn't allow food or beverages. So we missed out on that and continued drinking instead. I learned so much about earthquakes (very relevant), nature's colors, and underwater life that night. There are even some art exhibits and a dance floor if you're feelin' yourself or another sexy nerd!\n\nEven though the night didn't end up as planned and my Friday morning at work was regretful, I definitely recommend going to the amazing show that Cal Academy puts on at least once.

It's almost too good to be true really. NightLife was an amazing experience -- I must say I was rather surprised at how crowded it was outside even though I arrived about an hour after opening (there was still a line outside to buy tickets), but it is a popular Golden Gate Park attraction so maybe I'm not really THAT surprised. \n\nIt's $15 for NightLife admission for non-members which is a really great price for Cal Academy considering regular student tickets are $31 and adult tickets are $36. Oh and yes, they do check ID's during purchase and again before entering the museum so don't forget yours!\n\nThe first thing you see as you walk in, besides the large dinosaur skeleton, is a lovely bar. One thing to note is that there are multiple bars set up throughout the museum and each one has its own specialty cocktail as well as a number of other drinks that are pretty uniform across all the bars. The cocktails were $12 each which feels a little pricey but it's San Francisco so really it's expected. I ordered (and loved) the summer of love sangria. It was supposed to come with a \"beautiful flower\" but I think they ran out by the time I decided I wanted a drink. \n\nAnother important fact is that the dome with the butterflies and reptiles closes earlier than the rest of the museum. I believe the closing time is 7:45 pm, so if you are a late comer like me and my friends or you decided to see the rest of the place first, make sure you pop your head into the large glass dome on the left side of the museum because it is beautiful and you'll instantly regret it if you try going there at the end of the night and realize it is closed.\n\nOverall I love science and this museum and I really enjoyed my NightLife experience.

It's pretty much the same, though I think they have more bars now as I remember it taking a while to get a drink when I first went. It was BiteLife that night, so they had some food demonstrations going on. I saw someone from Belcampo deconstruct a turkey and another demo on how to create a banh mi. They even gave out everything they made, so a friend of mine got some turkey and we both got to sample the vietnamese sandwich. They also had different booths with info about food products. I stopped by the Bitty table and sampled some chips made with cricket flour.\n\nAdmission to NightLife is only $15 versus the $34.95 general admission during the day. Totally worth it for me as I love exploring places with drink in hand. Not sure what's not accessible at night versus day, but you can still go to two of my favorite sections: the Aquarium and the Planetarium. I didn't end up going to the Planetarium this time, but I did go to the Aquarium. Still colorful and eye catching.\n\nYou must be 21 or over to do NightLife, so if you want to explore the academy of sciences, this is a cheaper way to do it. Drinks are a little pricey.

Walking in, there is a coat check for $3 but I opted not to because there was live music and a bar in the patio area. I made the mistake of not eating beforehand but there were food options there such as wings for $10. The drinks were about $9 - $12 but man the drinks were strong. I went with 6 people and everybody's drink was just as strong. We got our drinks and headed over to the exhibits but the one we wanted to go to closed early. Not all of the exhibits allow drinks which sucks but is understandable. The best part was that there were no children! Not a rowdy place for adults to get wasted either so it was a good vibe. Parked in the underground lot and paid the flat rate of $17. The best place is the underwater tunnel where you can just sit and observe the fishes and turtle going back and forth.

March 19 for the Time Capsule theme and March 26 for the Robot theme.

I did walk by a few at both evenings and they seemed engaging - some with hands-on activities, others with demonstrations.\n\nDrinks! Drinking inside a science museum! The beer snob and nerdy side of me rejoiced. The Aliciella Bitter by Magnolia Brewing is a must try. Read up on it too, the beer name has an interesting back story. My first visit, there were a lot more beer options at the 'Beer & Whiskey Zone'. Second visit, they only had Magnolia's Aliciella and their IPA. So, it seems they somewhat 'rotate' or add and take out drinks every week. Beers are $8, I believe, which is a bit for a beer... but expect high prices at any kind of event.\n\nFood is also expensive for the portions you get. First visit, I got the hot dog with duck bacon, which was good and disappeared from my hands too soon! Second visit, I got a hot dog with shredded cheese on top, meh. There are options for food inside and outside the museum - I got both of mine at the pop up spot near the front entrance.\n\nNightLife can get really busy. My second visit required about a 10 minute wait in line to get into the building. I assume only because it's spring break for some schools in the city. Both times, I hit up the line for the rainforest right away! Good call, because later in the evening the line grows like ten times! The earthquake exhibit gets busy too.

It doesn't get really busy until 7:30 8 pm ish, but the rainforest exhibit closes the earliest, so I suggest going there first if you want ti go walk around and sip your drink there. \n\nThe big difference between the day and night is 1. the crowd - over 21 only and a mixed group of people in their mid 20s to early 30s 2. music in the background 3. night time view from the top and 4. mixed drinks to your hearts desire. \n\nIn terms of drinks, I always go to the \"VIP\" bar on the upper level that serves more quality alcohol such as grey goose - a little more pricier, but they are strong! All bars offer a drink special so it is cool to check those out as they are pretty bomb and a fair price for how much alcohol they put in. If you want to start your night off fast, there's the shot (bourbon) and beer of the day combo. The beer is always/usually Bud Light or another low grade beer, but it does the job! If you are getting the drunchies during your stay, the pizza is the cheapest and most reasonable thing to eat before going out. \n\nOverall, I highly suggest coming to Nightlife as it is the cool thing to do these days :), but really, it's pretty awesome and fun to do in big groups.", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

I went for the first time last Thursday for the street food themed night and had a good time.\n\nTips:\n-Buy your tickets online beforehand. They sell some at the door too (I bought mine at the door and was told they had 500 available), but why wait in an extra line when you don't have to? For some of the more popular themed nights, tickets do sell out online so watch out! For the street food themed night, they sold out in the afternoon the day of (hence why I had to buy mine at the door). \n\n-They start selling tickets at the door at 5:30. Doors open at 6. If you get here around 6 you will run into a super long line stretched out along the sidewalk. Even if you come later (I had a friend get there around 7:15), there will always be a long line to get in, but luckily it moves along pretty quickly.\n\n-If you get there early enough, first thing you want to do is grab Planetarium tickets. On the night I went, they had two talks at 6:30 and 7:30 (half an hour each) given by the director of the museum, and then a 8:30 documentary on how all living beings on earth depend on each other. If possible grab tickets for whatever movie/documentary they have available for the night--it is SO cool to sit inside the Planetarium and gaze up at the huge round screen and feel completely immersed in it. Definitely my favorite part of the evening so check it out if you can!\n\n-Next thing to check out is the rainforest, since that closes at 8. I would go earlier rather than later so you can slowly walk through it and check it out without too many people around.\n\n-Get food either before or afterwards. There isn't a great food selection here, and what is available is kind of pricey.\n\n-Plenty of street parking along the street right next to the museum. Just make sure you get to your car by 10 pm, though the Nightlife event ends at 10 so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\n-This isn't super important, but I would recommend picking a themed night that interests you. I went to the street food themed event because I saw there would be cooking demos and some food samples being given out. Of course, both were a little bit disappointing (had to wait in long lines to get tiny sample portions), but I enjoyed it more than I would have most other themes.

Right now they are having 7:30 Show called Habitat and Its soooo good. I loved it when I saw it last week. Warning: Tickets do go fast!! However, if you miss the show, it is fast to take a walk through the rain forest and explore other exhibits are offered that night. Please come you won't be sorry. I never am.", "author": "Galya T."}

Because I've been to the museum often, I attend NightLife when there's a theme I'm interested in.  I recently went to a food-themed one before the Thanksgiving holiday, and that was really interesting!  There was a company that uses crickets to make flour, and a company that uses beta fish tanks to fertilize vegetables.\n\nNightLife is also a great way to check out the museum at a discounted price.  An adult ticket during regular hours is around $35.  NightLife tickets are $12.  The only issue is that you most likely have to choose between a planetarium show or the rainforest since the show tickets run out fast, and the rainforest closes at 7:30pm.\n\nThe one critique I have is the seating for the Halloween Drag show.  The stage isn't high, so you can't see anything unless you're very close to the stage.  They used the wall behind the stage as a screen, so I was hoping they would project the show.  Instead, it was background graphics for the runway.\n\nOtherwise, NightLife is fun to go to with friends or your SO.", "author": "Vira P."}

Then, go to the terrarium, the place closes at 8 PM. The food is decent, but if you could hold off for a bit until after your visit here, you can find something cheaper, yummier, and bigger somewhere within a 5 mile radius. Also, parking is available on the inside streets nearby, you just gotta look. Just make sure you leave by 10 PM!!!!!\n\n$12 for admission, no bratty kids to get in the way, and a decent crowd as well. DOPE! I didn't particularly like the bartenders, who were all salty as hell and scoffed when I asked for something like angry orchard. Just give it to me, I don't need your sad sass. You're not better than any of us.\n\nAlso, the drinks were way too expensive, but it's nice that they had so many \"bars\" at various areas. The food was ridiculously expensive too. $7 for a cheddar hotdog? Um..... no. \n\nMe and the BF came on the \"Robots\" exhibit this past thursday, and I liked it! They featured a bunch of different new \"robot\" innovations in the African hall, including a new treatment for cancer, which is right up my alley!! The volunteers were very knowledgeable about the clinical trials, and I was delighted to be slightly tipsy and talking nerdy.\n\n\nThe terrarium was cool too, but the narrator that particular night was... poorly spoken to say the least. She kept stumbling at her script and it was distracting, even though the dome above was amazing to look at. Maybe practice reading the script more than once?\n\nAnyway, booze it up, watch the stars, stare at plants, marvel at fishies. It's cheap!", "author": "Danielle S."}

I was able to get 3 tickets for the 7:30 showing of Back to the Moon for Good which was narrated by Tim Allen! It was awesome to watch a video about space commentated by Buzz Lightyear and learn about the Google Lunar XPRIZE. There was a Q&A session after the movie as well with the makers of the film.

She said \"It was as if people were playing that darn music you kids like!\" I replied with \"Oh you mean tha Skillrex Dubstub, yo?\" and went to high five her.

General admission on a regular day is $29.95, whereas NightLife is only $12. The main attractions are the planetarium, rainforest, and aquarium, all of which you can explore at NightLife.

We arrived at around 6:40pm, and tickets were already gone for the night. As soon as you arrive, go to the planetarium to try to get your ticket, and then go to the rainforest because it closes at 7:30pm.\n\nTip #3: Pre-game before arriving.

I've gone to this event 2 times now (I'll check in next time to verify that) and all of it has their own unique theme. The first time I went was about time and they had lectures, activities and even the music was related to the theme (every hour they played a new decade like the 50s, 60s, 70s, etc.). The 2nd time I went was about habitat and how different animals rely on each other to survive. All in all an awesome place to go to. \n\nAnother great reason to go to is that admission is way cheaper during the night than during the day ($12 comparing to $35) and you pretty much get to see the whole Academy of Sciences with no kids at sight (if you find little kids annoying) and plus they have drinks and cocktails, which are pretty good. \n\nI'd recommend for people to go here on a Thursday night. It's fun, enjoyable, and a great experience. The only thing I'd watch out for is that you might get a little dizzy when watching the movie on the planetarium, especially if you've been drinking, lol.", "author": "Tito G."}

We went on Valentine's Day and my husband was just in awe.  He was like a little boy.  We explored everything and he said at the end of the night, \"I just want to stay forever and look at all the animals.\"  This is an incredible place to come for any date night, special occasion or holiday.   \n\nIt's slightly different from like a zoo.  In fact, I wouldn't call it a zoo at all but a lot of people get confused and think it's a zoo.  The animals they have are mostly fish, snakes, spiders and frogs.  No really crazy animals but they are all unique enough that you don't really miss seeing the monkeys and bears.  They have music and lights, especially deep down where the bottom of the sea fish are.  It feels like a club where people dance and just hang out.\n\nThe planetarium made for a romantic night out.  Mix that with some yummy cocktails and delicious food and you have a whole night out.  They had the cutest desserts that were so delicious.  Fondu cake and bananas, pudding in a specimen container and little tiny bags of jelly beans.  They even had root beer float and swedish fish samples courtesy of Whole Foods.  \n\nCAofS's food is actually pretty good.  I like their Mexican section where they have carnitas soft tacos, black beans and rice.  The fish and chips weren't as lame as I thought they would be.  Made pretty well.  Not as fried as this dish normally is.\n\nNot to mention the vibrator exhibit.  Old vibrators dating back as early as the 1900's.  They really knew how to get the big O back then.\n\nMy favorite part of the night was the earthquake exhibit.  I am just fascinated by earthquakes.  I was going to become a seismologist but I was never good at science.  Or math.\n\nI only have 2 complaints for an otherwise fun night.  The girl who narrated our Planetarium experience, we saw the 7 PM showing which was Love and Sex in the stars, or something like that, was talking WAY too fast.  The subject matter was great but she was talking as fast as a freight train.  Her talking so fast, coupled with the angle I was sitting at and looking up made for a very sick Victoria.  Slow down girl, you're never in that much of a rush.  I also thought it was way more crowded than it needed to be.  3,000 people I believe and I didn't feel like the space was big enough for 3,000 people.  Especially when some of their main attractions close at 8 PM.\n\nIf you want a contained night out with good food, drinks and a little education, you need to come to Nightlife.

You walk up a spiral walkway circling the different \"rainforest of the world.\" If you're afraid of reptiles like me, be careful... they're some in the showcases. Don't stare too closely haha. It's also cool because they let the birds and butterflys fly free. Can get humid in there.\n- Aquarium: we stayed there the longest. I love under the sea!

It takes a decent amount of time to get into the city by BART and MUNI because you're going against the traffic so your buses are less frequent.

Instead, it's more like a natural history museum + Aquarium. The \"interactive\" parts are severely limited. \n\nNow about the NightLife on thursday nights: a well-represented SF night crowd. There were girls spilling out of club dresses and 5\" stiletto heels, guys with a million piercings, hipsters, preps, goths, and academics - a whole potpourri of the general population, crammed into every museum hall and every exhibit. \n\nThe experience is way too crowded to be a romantic date, way too tacky for anyone above 25 to enjoy (live rock band blasting in one hall, a nerdy DJ blasting rihanna 10 feet away), and way too superficial for anyone actually interested in the science aspects. \n\nWould not return unless for a private function.", "author": "Alice Z."}

Needless to say, there was no DJ, cocktails, or even an albino alligator then. And I have to admit, these things make an already cool experience even cooler! Plus, I'm a grownup now and I can spend as much time in the African room as I want without being shooed along by the teacher.\n\nI finally made my way to a Nightlife exhibit recently and I have to say I'm really impressed with the operation they have going on. What a great way to open up such an amazing local treasure to a younger set who may not think to go to a natural science museum, or even step foot in this neighborhood, under normal circumstances! \n\nParking's pretty easy, admission's cheaper than a normal day during daytime hours, and drinks make everything better... also very impressed with the cafe food!

Tickets are only $12/person! :)\n\nThis was my first time at the California Academy of Sciences in general, and I'm glad I came during NightLife. It was nice not having to worry about little kids running around. I loved looking at all the animals while enjoying a drink, a SPIKED SNOW CONE ($10) was my drink of choice! There were two flavors: Blackberry Elderflower Sour (vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, blackberries and lemon juice) and Holiday Pisco Punch (oro pisco, cranberry, persimmon, pineapple and organic cane juice). They were a lot stiffer than we expected them to be (but it's a good thing!) and we couldn't really differentiate between the two flavors. They pretty much tasted the same. Don't forget to bring cash for the bars!\n\nLast night's theme was Snowvember and they decorated the lobby with snowflakes and a giant blow-up snowman. It was cute, but I thought they could have down a little more to make it more snowy-looking. They had reindeer outside in the back, and I was excited to see them, but they looked SO SAD. :( \n\nThe rainforest was cool. The atmosphere in the sphere actually made me feel like I was in a rainforest - warm and humid. Make sure to go as soon as you get in because we didn't have to wait, but when we were walking around at ~7:30ish, we noticed a HUGE line to get in. \n\nBy far, my favorite part of the night was the BABY OSTRICHES!!! Oh.My.God. There were three of them and they were the cutest things ever! I can't get enough of them. The little guy on the left (see my picture) was my favorite because he looked like he just plopped down from exhaustion.

Academy of Sciences is byfar my favorite museum probably ever. \n\nRegardless of the NightLife theme, going to the academy during NightLife is better because it means 1) no kids 2) less crowds 3) libations and 4) steeply reduced prices (it's $12 instead of $35). The academy itself has enough to keep you engaged even without the wonderful events NightLife adds to the agenda. The museum has an aquarium, a biodome, a planetarium, an earthquake simulator, a living roof, an albino alligator, and a million other things. \n\nOn top of that, the museum does an amazing job at catering to the theme with fascinating exhibits, entertainment, and DJs. My last visit to the academy was for their Halloween theme and I got an amazingly scary monster makeover from some professional makeup artists. They also had an exhibit where you could touch real brains and an amazingly executed drag show. It was a wonderful way to celebrate Halloween!\n\nI think if you're 21+ you shouldn't bother visiting the Academy of Sciences during regular hours. NightLife is amazing, and if I could I'd go every week.", "author": "Kathleen L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-06", "description": "The Academy of Sciences has always been one of my favorite museums in the city. Since it's reopening I've visited many times during the day, and  finally I had the chance to check out nightlife this past summer. It's basically the same museum plus alcohol, a DJ, and no kids running around. Awesome. \n\nPlanetarium: Since there are only three showings a night, I suggest you grab a ticket to a show the second you enter the academy, and get there early since tickets run out fast. The planetarium is in the shape of a dome which creates a screen that provides awesome visuals. The academy shows many different movies, the most recent one I saw was a documentary on Earthquakes. \n\nRainforest: Closes at 8pm during nightlife, so you might wanna check this out after you get your Planetarium tickets. There are lots of reptiles, butterflies, birds, and tropical plants. It's pretty cool since you start from the ground level and walk on a path that spirals upwards along the dome. Each level represents a layer of the rainforest which contains unique plants and animals. \n\nAquarium: After you take your tour of the rainforest, there is an elevator that takes you directly to the bottom floor of the academy to the aquarium. Aquariums are definitely my favorite, and the one at the academy is pretty legit. During nightlife they have a DJ playing all night. There are lots of fish, sharks, and they have a famous albino alligator, which is pretty cool. There is also an interactive tide pool area where you can touch sea urchins and starfish, and an underwater tunnel where you can see the sharks swim right over you. \n\nI just love science museums and nightlife at the academy is such an awesome idea. There are several bar stations that have the basic drinks, beers, and cocktails, but each station has it's own unique cocktail. Drinks were pretty weak and damn expensive, but still nice to try! I had a gingersnap mojito and a watermelon margarita, both were really tasty. They have performances in the center dining area, which is pretty cool. I also have to note that parking is free in the park, just make sure you move your car by 10pm (that's the park curfew).

This event has been on my bucket list for a while, and now I can finally cross it off!  I came here about nine years ago for a field trip.  Obviously, it has changed quite a bit since then.\n\n- The Planetarium.  This is probably the highlight of the event, but unfortunately, I can't say anything about it since they ran out of tickets when I got there!  You have to be at the Academy early to snatch them.\n- Portable stations.  You'll find little carts stationed here and there with people dressed in orange vests.  They have really interesting artifacts to show, so don't be shy and stop by to talk to them.  I didn't find them amusing, but they can be pretty funny.  They were using me as a point of reference when they made comparisons to the sizes of a couple of animal species, so... yeah, you get the picture.\n- Cool exhibits.  There's the rainforest, cute frogs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-academy-of-sciences-san-francisco-6?select=Q6HbTl-j_Qc5c2p5XbHCcg#Q6HbTl-j_Qc5c2p5XbHCcg), beautiful jellyfish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/california-academy-of-sciences-san-francisco-6?userid=qEdxnnadZ2tcU9JOXjnGdw#o9DuIKQ8ItTLgwDV8GLu8g), abnormally-shaped fish, and more.  Don't come here if you don't have an inner nerd to embrace.  What is there not to like, seriously?  \n- Drinks/DJ.  It's a 21+ event for obvious reasons.  They sell drinks and there's a DJ playing on the main floor if you want to dance.  But I believe that you can enjoy the exhibits without getting trashed.\n\n__________\nMy 2\u00a2:\n- For those who do not live in the city, your best option is to BART to the Civic Center station and take the 5 from there.  It's a bit of a hassle, but this is the Academy we're talking about.  Totally worth it.\n- Get there early if you want to see the Planetarium.

After printing out the tickets, and having major issues just getting the ticket to print, we arrived and stood at the door because the ticket print outs did not have the bar code on them.  I had to dig through my emails to find the PDF, and then try to load that on my phone, which took another 10 minutes.   Why not just sell tickets at the door, or somehow streamline the process of printing the tickets.   I know I'm not the first person to deal with this.\n\nOn to the food and drink -- ever since new management took over, they closed the Moss Room, and took the food a notch down, and the drinks.  The cocktails are batch mixed.  I'm going to guess that the gin in my drink last night was probably Seagrams.  $12 for a mediocre cocktail, and a long wait to get it.   The Cafe used to have a decent bar, with fresh drink ingredients and primo spirits.\nThe Moss Room had the best cocktails and food in the whole place, and now that is closed for private events only.   The website said the Terrace Cafe was open that night -- and when we arrived it was closed for a private event.  What is up with all the elitism?   Our only option was to eat the high school cafeteria style food they offer in the Cafe.  $40 for two burgers with fries and two sodas.  That sucked and soured our evening.\nLast night was crowded...too many people, loud and the ambiance was frenetic and not enjoyable.   The poor reindeer in the East Pavillion looked sad, cold and tired in the rain ...and there were only two of them.  The line for the photo booth was really long...and honestly...their props were nothing special.  Not wanting to stand in line forever, we gave up on that.   The Academy itself is great, with all it has to offer - the planetarium, the rainforest, and all of the exhibits.  I do feel bad for the animals sometimes...when the music is so loud and they are in enclosures that seems small for them.  I just feel that they can do better with Nightlife.", "author": "Wendy W."}

Not the most interesting, but that was the week she was here. We were able to try some local chocolates and beers, see some up-and-coming products. We also saw that walking down the street outside, so it wasn't all too exciting.\n\nWe got there around 6:30 and JUST missed the first planetarium show. The 7:30 and 8:30 shows were about earthquakes, and we caught one of those and it was.. certainly not as interesting as I thought it'd be. I love planetariums... next time, if there is a next time, I'll be on time.\n\nThe place fills up pretty quickly, which made it kind of hard to see everything through the crowds. I'd wanted to see the shaking house/earthquake simulation exhibit but there was a ridiculous line for it. The aquarium basement was like a club, which is kinda cool but unexpected. The rain forest was great as usual, especially since they do stagger entries. \n\nThey had telescopes up on the living roof, and I don't know why but I was fuh-reaking out about seeing the moon. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IN OUR TEXTBOOKS! So cool to see it with your own eyes (+ some help from an uber telescope) though. And we saw Jupiter! Bring a jacket.\n\nI didn't see the food options, but I know the cocktail were on the pricier side, like maybe $12?\n\nI'd give it a go again if I see a really awesome theme (I heard the Halloween zombie theme was amazing) or if I have people visiting.

The place was bustling with people, especially near the bars. They have tables set up in each area for you to purchase alcohol and food. Each section also had its own specialty drink. The downside of it though was that it cost $10 for that special cocktail. The other cocktails are $8 or $9. You can get a beer for $5. They were rather small cocktails so they weren't exactly worth it but it's pretty standard bar prices. \n\nAs for the attractions, they were okay. We got to see the new earthquake exhibit and it was a beautiful little room but I remember the old earthquake exhibit being better because it shook more. I mean, you get to look at fish and learn a little throughout but if you have been here before, it's not much different at night. One thing I LOVED, however, was the flip books! The night we went, there was a green screen set up and they had some props for you to dance around for 15 seconds or so. They then transfer that into a flip book. When there was no line, they let us do more. Plus... it was FREE! I did this at a hotel holiday party before and it was definitely fun. I'm glad we went when they had that. I don't know that they have that every time though.\n\nSo in the end, if you have never been to the NightLife, do it just to say you've done it.

On 7/27, though, there was a show that my husband called a rabid etch-a-sketch with nonstop CGI graphics and annoying music and nothing even remotely related to planets, stars, solar systems or anything that would ever appear in a proper planetarium show. To make matters worse, there was no advance warning and we were trapped in the middle for the whole show. If you go, be sure you know what the planetarium show is before you suffer a similar fate.

We went yesterday to their last event of the year since they will do night life again in Jan 8. We got there at 5:30 and bought our tickets at the window on the left side and got in line. tickets are only $12 no tax, we were the 6th ones in line and once it got closer to 6 the line kept getting longer and longer behind us.\n\nOnce you go inside go to the left across the bridge of sting rays and get tickets for the Planetarium and then go to the rainforest since they close at 8. The rainforest was VERY humid and kinda hot since we were out in the storm all day haha. A lot of snakes, frogs, reptiles and butterflies flying around. Once you get to the very top they send you down to the Aquarium in the basement. \n\nAquarium gets very cool compared to being in the humid rainforest. Liked the Aquarium the best a lot to sea and there was a DJ already spinning music and a girl singing the song which was pretty cool. Got a Gimlet($12) and the beer special which was Tecate($5). We walked around and explored a lot to sea. \n\nMake sure you arrive 15 min early to the planetarium because lines do get long. We ended up being the first ones in line haha once you get inside go to the middle, I think the higher you go up the stairs the better view it is and less strain on your neck from looking up the whole time. Honestly the show made me tired and was kinda falling asleep since it was dark and kinda boring, But the effects were cool. It was only interesting in the beginning then it kinda gets repetitive about black matter and black energy. \n\nAfter the show we saw a bunch of people dancing but no music down in the first floor with head phones on there were blinking different colors. We went down and checked it out. So the DJ's r hooked up to the head phones and you can change station to which dj you want and each one has a diff color so ppl can see which one you're listening too. Which was pretty cool.\n\nWanted to go to the living roof but it was closed due to the nonstop rain. Ill probably go back again when they have a another special event since it beats paying 35 bucks for day admission when you can go at night for 12 and drink haha", "author": "Min H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-27", "description": "This is a great premise, however, unlike art museum evening parties this museum is full of living animals.  These animals are caged and cannot choose to leave when extremely loud music is blasted around their small habitat.  I would guess that the museum has made an effort to provide appropriate living environments for each animal, however, I doubt loud thumping music is considered part of an appropriate environment, especially at night.  \n\nIt was hard for me to enjoy this event when I felt so awful for the animals there who did not choose to attend the party.  Perhaps some of them are deaf and don't notice, or the glass is thick enough to protect them, I don't know.  Certainly some are out in the open like the albino alligator.  He didn't seem bothered, but he did look like he was trying to sleep.\n\nBe aware you need to come early to enter the rainforest.  Also, the popular exhibits such as the \"earthquake simulator\" have super long lines. The NIghtLife event is not especially long and you are liable to spend a large chunk of it waiting in line for such attractions unless you are a member, in which case you can cut the line.  \n\nOverall I love the idea of the museum being open late at night for a cheaper price, and offering special activities and food.  The telescope on the roof was great.  (more are needed though, the line was long)  I think the music should be much softer though.  \n\nPersonally I would prefer if the event wasn't such a club atmosphere either, quieter music, less alcohol (I got elbowed hard by a flailing drunk guy looking at a fish), although I realize that this might be the main draw for many attendees.  \n\nIt's possible that I happened to attend an especially loud Thursday as the theme was music.  Regardless, I think the lack of attention to the animal's wellbeing that night seriously detracted from the event.  At the very least put up some signs reassuring us that the animals are deaf or don't mind, if that is the case.", "author": "N T."}

There was a live swing band, cute and very talented couples tearing up the dance floor in true swing fashion, and lots of delicious cocktails, food and wonderful museum exhibits to be enjoyed! My favorite exhibits were 1)  the planetarium show (the second one produced by the Academy itself); 2) the awesome rainforest that mimicked the actual climate of the tropics (humid) with free floating butterflies and birds that fly super close to you; and 3) their beautiful aquarium full of giant fishes and intriguing species to gawk at. \n\nThe food was also surprisingly delicious for a museum. We had steamed chicken and pork buns, bbq ribs, and a delicious banh minh. We both enjoyed a GG cocktail that had sparkling wine, orange bitters and blood orange syrup in it. Very yummy! The place is cash only so come prepared! There are a few ATMs on the premises, but unless you want to be charged fees, it's better to bring the cash beforehand. The Academy cafe is open too if you want to go in for a large selection of goodies and desserts. The bf seemed to really enjoy his soft serve ice-cream. \n\nFew other bonuses include 1) no kids running around screaming b/c it's nighttime, 2) the albino gator that everyone loves, and 3) the glass windows that allow you to see lab workers stuffing giant owls and birds.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-09", "description": "All major cities' museums, art galleries and cultural institutions have some kind of \"night\" event where the sophisticated 21+ crowd can mix and mingle without worrying about pesky children. It's also a great way for the institution to make more in one night than they probably do in one week of ticket sales, what with all the money that is spent on overpriced drinks, overpriced food and overpriced extras (raffle tickets, special events, merchandise, etc.)\n\nMy friend and I came for the Academy's Fashion Night event (there's a different Nightlife theme each week). It was a good time, but not quite as fun as other \"night\" events I've been to. Part of that had to do with the crowd, which the museum obviously couldn't help--a few too many douchey frat boys looking to score, a tad too much stuck-up pretentiousness and a bit of \"What the eff is he/she wearing and why the hell hasn't anyone cited them for public indecency?\" \n\nThe other part the museum COULD help--unpleasant bartenders, rude servers, overpriced cocktails, and poorly planned accommodations for the night's main event: the fashion show. I was really excited to try the Fall Fashion Cocktail Tour, but most of the drinks were a waste of the unique ingredients that went into them because they were terribly proportioned and watered down. While some of the bartenders and food servers were nice, a few others were so bitchy and rude, it made you not want to tip out of spite. \n\nNot much was put into actually decorating the museum in any way, which was a bit of a disappointment for a fashion theme. The main attraction, as previously mentioned, was the fashion show, but it was housed in a small room with far fewer chairs than there were guests, forcing more than half of the audience to stand. The clothes themselves were quite cute, but a fashion show just isn't as much fun if you don't have a good view.\n\nIf you plan to only visit the Academy once, Nightlife is a great deal: reduced admission ($12 instead of ~$30), no babies, children or teenagers allowed (21+), alcohol and special food, and all of the exhibits available for your perusal. My friend and I spent some time walking through the rainforest and the below-ground aquarium, but skipped the rest because we plan to return and do a thorough tour of the museum without the distractions of liquor, DJs and pulsating music. But we both live in San Francisco, so we can easily return on one of the Academy's free days.\n\nWhich brings me to my final point: If you live in San Francisco, do your research before visiting any of the city's museums/art galleries. Between grants, the city government and major corporate sponsors, there are so many free days throughout the year that you can pretty much avoid ever having to pay for admission. Often, these free days are on the first Tuesday of the month, but sometimes they are on other days. Check the museum's website to be sure. The one caveat is that the free weekdays' hours are usually only business hours, so if you work a regular 9-to-5 job, you might not be able to make it. So plan ahead! :)", "author": "Josephine L."}

It's not something I can see myself doing on a regular basis, but fun no doubt. Nice to go at your own pace rather than running after kids. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't many exhibits for the Mind and Body event they were advertising. We saw a yoga session in the main room, but I was expecting more science related shows. They also had a cannabis demonstration too, but still not what I expected for Mind/Body at the academy of science. \n\nFood and drinks were reasonably priced. Drinks were great (LOVED the botanical beer!)  and bartenders were cool, but the food from the cafe came out cold. I ordered the veggie burger because it was labeled vegan on the menu, but then they put cheese on it?? Hmm.. I also don't think they were using vegan buns for those dishes either so that was a downer. The kitchen staff seemed so rushed and made a bunch of mistakes on everyone's orders, even people in front of us in line, but at least the line moved quickly and we didn't have to wait long for our food.\n\nThe Calacademy staff was awesome.

Super lucky as a matter of fact because the planetarium attendant said they were on hiatus for 3 whole weeks!\nThis event's theme was \"How-To\". They had mini workshops where you can recycle Christmas cards. We basically got to cut up magazines and glue stuff on the cards. I felt like a kid again! One thing I thought was cool was the homemade glue. They called it wheat paste. Very eco-friendly and also edible! Ha, just kidding...\nWe got to taste honey straight from the honeycomb. It was wonderful. I also felt proud to sign a petition to get SF to be bee-friendly!\nGoogle was also there to show a demo on their Google Glass. It was pretty awesome. I got to take a picture using the glasses and also record video. To be honest, the little demo actually makes me want to get a pair. Can't wait for it to be released!\nThere were also workshops on how to be a ninja and how to spin plates. Unfortunately we didn't get to do those due to the fact that we were tired from going around the city. \nWhat I noticed when we were there was that there were a lot of singles around looking to meet other people. Lots of groups of 2. Mostly couples and a handful of people were just solo. I think this place would be a perfect place to find a date!\nI would love to rate this the whole 5 stars, but there was a bartender lady down in the aquarium who was a snob. My boyfriend was just asking her how much a beer was and she rudely pointed out the chart. It's just so dim in there that you can barely see...

Tip: If you buy online, you will still need to go to the box office in exchange for a scanned ticket.  Then proceed to another line so they can check your ID (21+ only allowed).  Once you pass all of this you are now in the museum and you can go anywhere you want.  \n\nMy suggestion is check the activity board because there are several shows in the Planetarium and in other areas around the museum that are timed and are only shown once throughout the night.  We were able to watch two shows while we were there.  The 3D show in the forum (3rd Floor) was awesome.  Don't miss it.  What we did miss out on was the Rainforest of the World.  We saw a long line, thinking we can go back later and check it out.  Big mistake it was long because it was the last showing of the night.  Total bummer.  Next time!!\n\nNow time for me to reminisce in the past...I'm sure all of you have been here when you were a little kid.  When the place had live Alligators in the so called \"man-made jungle\".  An aquarium with several tanks and fishes and don't forget the animal of Africa.  Although it seemed old, I still felt like it was one of the best museums out there...now fast forward to today.  This museum is totally revamped.  Can we say high tech?  I'm all for renovation, unfortunately; this place went from cozy to cold.  I don't know if it's the design or the color choices they picked out.  I remember in the past I could spend an entire day here.  Now I can actually finish the entire museum in a few hours.  I'm not saying don't go here because it is a cool place but I wouldn't pay the general admission of $34.95 as an adult, unless I have to bring a kid.\n\nThe roof top has an amazing view; I wish we went up there when the sun was setting.  The new addition of penguins was super cute and a Rainforest in the middle of the museum was a jaw dropping moment.  Aside from the many exhibits in the museum what makes Nightlife cool is the fact it's all adults.  You can purchase an alcoholic beverage if you're willing to pay $12 for a small cup or $6 for beer.  I was excited they offered Vegan Steam buns.  We devoured the bun with no mercy.  Super yummy.  On this day they had a live band outside in the Garden and a Rock Wall you can climb for free.  Every Nightlife is different each week, check online first before attending.  http://www.calacademy.or...\n\nIn the end, the night was wonderful.  Thank you to Mr. BYS (my honey) for a wonderful night and buying me the cutest little penguin stuffed animal (which we name Tux).

The ticket could be purchased over the Internet and I believe there as well for $12, really good considering it's something nice to do rather than hanging at the bar/club. \n\nLike another reviewer mention there is no dress code here but people do go all out (including me and my girls) and that's a good thing because this is a nice museum so you should. The bar station is located on each level, and the bartenders are all dressed in long white robes and aren't so bad looking, if I do say so myself. Another good thing is the bartenders all have a heavy hand so best believe I got my tipsy on after the 1st drank! ;)\n\nThe green room was one of the best thing because although it is compact and only a number amount of people can go in at one time. It is a great experience seeing all those butterflies at the top and the various types of spiders. It does get hot and sweaty in there so be prepared to take those layers of clothing off! I also enjoyed the darker side of the room where all the tanks and fishes are at because just the concept of looking at fishes swim is so peaceful. \n\nUnfortunately we didn't get to try any of the foods but I will say that they did look deliciously tempting.

It didn't disappoint.\n\nAlthough technically I didn't come for the nightlife, it was for a company holiday party, but it was at night and there were drinks and a DJ and a band which I am assuming is closer to night life than the normal atmosphere so I am writing my review here.\n\nThe lighting and ambiance and atmosphere is definitely really cool. I really enjoyed walking around, grabbing some food and drinks and listening to some music while I browsed the various exhibits. The museum really isn't that big, but the exhibits are well-made and totally enjoyable to sit down or stand and gaze at. My favorite room was probably either the one with the animal recreations/statues/models (not sure what the best word for this is but yea) or the aquarium area in the lower level. There were live sea creatures and lizards and jelly fish and lots more! I never saw like 90% of those animals alive, only in books, and they were totally cool.\n\nSuper bummed that I missed out on the planetarium shows though... :( Apparently they give out tickets for shows and the last show was at 9:30pm and I didn't catch it. Very sad. Just because of how cool that sounds and how much I enjoyed it, I think I'll definitely be coming back sometime to see the planetarium and the tropical rainforest (which I also missed because they closed it at 8pm as not to mess up the biological clocks of the plants). If you too are interested in coming sometime at night, just keep those 2 things in mind and make sure you double check if you need a ticket or when the closing time or last showings are for the planetarium and/or tropical rainforest.

The cafeteria is now open at night (which it definitely didn't used to be), they've placed several DJs throughout, and they've created specialty cocktails that are delicious! They also have live bands performing. I was pretty impressed.\n\nWhile I haven't sampled anything from the cafeteria yet, the food I saw everyone carrying around looked very promising. Noodle soups, steamed buns, street tacos, chicken entrees... definitely a more gourmet cafeteria experience. Pricey though, of course.\n\nDress code is kind of all over the place. I remember Nightlife being a more casual affair, but on my most recent venture out I saw many of the female patrons in high heels and dresses and several men in button downs and ties. Most are still casual of course, but it seems like Nightlife is becoming a little more glam. Or perhaps it's because people intend to go elsewhere after Nightlife?

But since just about everyone and their mother (and father too, apparently) were also going there at the same time, I figured I would just wait until some of the crowds died down.  And so I waited.  And waited.  And then I got pretty busy.  And then by the time the crazy ass lines started to disappear, so did the number of my friends who hadn't checked it out yet.  Oh the best laid plans...\n\nSo, when I saw that NightLife was one of the events listed for Yelp's Culture Club in February, I knew that this would be the perfect chance to get some friends to go.  How so?  By appealing to two of our greatest weaknesses as 20-something year old Asians (exact ages withheld for my own well being...haha) - alcohol and discounted tickets.  Helloooo kryptonite!\n\nAlthough I'm comparing the experience to what it was like as a kid, coming to the Academy for NightLife is pretty different.  Before, it was all about spending the day checking out the animals and walking around with friends to explore the different exhibits.  This time, it was all about spending the night checking out the animals and walking around with friends to explore the different exhibits...while drinking.  VERY different.\n\nThe most apparent thing is that the crowd is obviously a bit older; you aren't going to see a bunch of kids running around since it's a 21+ event.  In their place, it's like the Academy decided to fill the void with bars - you can find one just about anywhere as they're on every level minus the roof, and several dot the main floor.  However, like everything else, the prices do tend to run on the high side for drinks, but I guess that's a bit of a given considering it's a tourist spot.  \n\nEven though the event runs from 6-10pm, it's best to get there as early as possible (last entry is at 9:00).  Besides the fact that parking is better and you would have more time inside, some of the exhibits close earlier than the event itself - namely the Rainforest exhibit (closes at 7:30pm).  Sadly for us, we were amongst the ones to find that out the hard way, and so we missed out on that and the planetarium (didn't bother buying tickets).  \n\nOverall, it was fun times and a great (cheaper) way to check out the Academy, but it didn't quite reach my somewhat lofty expectations.", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-25", "description": "As most of my friends know, I used to worship the old Academy of Sciences and am still bitter about what they done to my beloved childhood favorite.  The new one is okay, but is nothing compared to the old one which was in a different league with good flow and a ton more content.  I often feel sad when I think of how many who love the new one never had the good fortune to experience the old one.\n\nAnyway, what's done is done and like the old saying goes, time heals all things.  I finally made it to the nightlife event here a week ago Thursday night and have to say that thanks to this event, I saw the new academy in an entirely different light.  It's still massively de-contented, but I could see that there have been quite a few changes since my last visit when it first opened.  Although they have a long way to go and still nowhere near what they used to be, I could tell they are seriously making an effort to improve and that is a good thing.  Definitely a step in the right direction and I now have hope that things will get better over time.\n\nIn the meantime, the nightlife event was fantastic!!!  Nice, cheerful crowd and everyone was so happy and in high spirits.  Even the girl in the recycled paper outfit walking around (she was promoting an event that I just can't remember the name of) was loving her job and having a great time!  The old dinosaur bones and new aquarium took on an entirely different look and feel at night in this nightlife setting and really came into it's own.  Sadly, the planetarium and rain forest were either sold out or closed by the time I got there (some things never change!), but this was offset by the lively free band and numerous bars set up throughout the academy.  I took a  lot of pics and posted some of my favorites from the evening.\n\nPeople were clearly enjoying themselves and having a great time in a most positive environment.  Like my review for the Friday Nights at the De Young event, I love the fact that these places are not the dry and static environments they once used to be, but rather a fun and living venue for nightlife as well.  Loved the large photo art of birds on the walls too.  Not sure if that is a temporary exhibit or a permanent fixture.\n\nWas surprised that they closed at 10PM as I thought they were open later (hey, it should be open until at least 11!), but I guess perhaps they do that so that people don't get too schnockered and dive into the coral reef exhibit or try to pet the albino alligator.  That wouldn't be too good.\n\nLots of fun and great people watching too.  The living roof (although I still say it's more of a lawn) is open at night which I guess is potentially a great romantic spot to go up to with the right person (heck, with the right person, anywhere can be romantic...Iraq is probably romantic with the right someone...look at all the pretty missiles...LOL)  \n\nThe food in the Academy Cafe looked really good too, although I had never before seen a $3.50 pork bun until that night (was that really for one or two?)\n\nNightlife is 21+ only so you won't get the road rage or gridlock of baby strollers that you usually get in the daytime.  Anyway, I liked this event a lot and will definitely be back soon.  Admission was far more reasonable too at only $12 compared with $29.95 in the day (yikes!).  Like I said earlier...the Academy of Sciences Nightlife event made me see the new academy in an entirely new light.  It was a lot of fun...not quite like some of the soirees I've attended at the Smithsonian in Washington DC, but special and so uniquely San Francisco in it's own way.", "author": "Roy N."}

Overall, I loved seeing all the reptiles, animals, amphibs through the glass. Sometimes it felt like you were playing \"where's waldo\" when you were looking for the creature through the glass.\n\nWe arrived around 6:15 and parked on the street. NOTE: Parking in the structure is $12 flat if you arrive after 5 or something. Come early and you can park pretty easily and close by on the street. No line to buy tickets either.\n\nInside the venue was not too crowded but there was a mix of people - the rain probably kept the crowd quite small. The night I went was Chinese New Year themed but I didn't see any of the performances. I didn't know where they were taking place, except for a food demo that I watched for like 1 minute. You easily get caught up in the exhibits and forget the time. So we missed our Planetarium show but I'd heard some mixed reviews on it, so I was not dying to go. We went to the Living Roof and it was so cold and not very clear, but still fun to see.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun. If you take photos they will come out GREAT. Also, I lost a glove here and called the next day, left a message, and got a call back in about 10 minutes saying they had my glove. THANK YOU BETH FROM LOST & FOUND!! Might seem silly to be so happy to find a glove, but it's got sentimental value :)\n\nThe people and staff here are the best and it makes for a really fun time.

I pictured jellyfish and strobe lights, penguins and techno music. To my dismay, it was just like any other trip to the musuem (lights on, docents in position) only with expensive drinks and no children (or at least, 21+ children). Don't get me wrong, it's totally cool to pet a snake with one hand, while sipping wine with the other, but I expected it to feel a bit more \"grown up\" or \"nightlifey\". \n\nThis would make for a perfect \"get to know you\" date, with plenty of conversation pieces (\"did you know jellyfish eat by opening their stomach and sucking food into it?\") The museum is huge and you could spend a good 2 hours if you really explored everything. NightLife is infamous for their overpriced drinks, so plan accordingly. \n\nI'm definitely a fan. Nightlife is a welcome diversion from the typical go-out-drinking-with-your-friends routine.

The magician act was indeed dumbfounding and drew a lot of \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" from the intellectual crowd, but I realized partway through an educational lecture about the history of magic, etc. that Nightlife is in the end still housed in a museum and thus does retain a pedantic flair. Interesting material, but definitely not a typical bar or club atmosphere despite the booze and DJ's. No one was dancing in the areas with music, probably because all the attendees are wallflower types. Tons of couples on date nights here, though. It's a smart spot for such an outing where you don't have to concentrate on making up conversation topics, and there's certainly lots of critters to entertain! \n\nIf you've never been to the Ca Academy of Sciences at all before and you're of age, definitely go to Nightlife instead visiting during the day to experience the museum--just make sure to get there around 7pm or earlier to snag planetarium tickets and visit the rainforest (closes at 7:45pm), and you'll get pretty much the full museum experience at the same cost since $12 Nightlife admission + a drink = regular ~$20 day admission.

I was limited by the long line that snaked around for the rain forest and the planetarium tickets are near impossible to get if you are late. The $10 price tag is fair to see all that there is to see, but the crowds really limit how much you get to see. However, the concept of museum nightlife is fun and something to do and talk about with an older, working crowd. Most people are coming from work and it gives them a chance to unwind after a long day - the alcohol certainly helps. \n\nHighlights included Claude, the white albino alligator, the renovated aquarium with the huge viewing tank, and the nice living roof. The roof will make you hungry because it smelled of fried calamari (probably coming from the cafe). They also had a telescope to view the sun. Supposedly on some days, you could see solar flares, but all I saw was a red dot. The African hall exhibit reminds me of my elementary school days and nothing about that hall has changed. All in all, it was nice to reminisce a little and also take in some of the new things going on here.

We had gotten lost on our way there and by the time we arrived, most free parking spots were gone. We had to travel quite a journey, but it was all worth it because for $8 + tip a pop for specialty drinks, we pregamed pretty hard with some Hennessy and Coke.

I really enjoyed that each bar had its own specialty drink so that you get to move around more and search for bars with your favorite drinks (sorta alcoholic-like of us), but we ended up trying a Daiquiri. It had champagne, blue angels vodka and a bit of cranberry juice. I asked the bartender to make it extra strong and boyy.. it was SOOO strong. Pure alcohol in a cup, my boyfriend definitely got drunk! \n\nAnyway another highlight of the night was the DJ.

I had a grand time and pretty sure the other tipsy people there did too... considering that someone pulled the fire alarm and ended the night early.\n\nSo, going through the CAS can be pretty tricky, because if you want to see everything, you have to plan out accordingly. Here are my tips and what I did.\n- get there by 5:30. I mean it! There was already a line when I got there. And surprisingly, there were lots of VIP members too, so they get to cut in front of you.\n- SAVE $2/person with THIS coupon!! http://www.citypass.com/san-francisco/coupons\n- parking is $12. Uh... we parked on the street for FREE! Plus, it was a nice walk to the CAS since we got to see all these fountains, the de Young, etc.\n- Once they let you in, go DIRECTLY to the Planetarium! You gotta claim your tickets. The worker said the 6:30 showing is the coolest.\n- Once you got your ticket, you have ~15 minutes to gather resources! Like the map and explore a little bit...\n- Don't buy your drinks until after the Planetarium. No food/drinks allowed inside. And the planetarium can make you a little dizzy for a moment and there's seriously no exit route when you're in there, unless you want to go through an obstacle course of people's legs.\n- Sit towards the middle for the best view in the Planetarium.\n- After the 6:30 showing, go straight to the Rainforest! They let the last group of people in at 7:30. \n- Bring a jacket, and wear short sleeves or whatever underneath. It gets really sticky/humid inside the Rainforest, of course.\n- Bring a camera, to take whimsical pictures with the jellyfish and other exotic animals.\n- Ladies, I wouldn't recommend wearing heels... \n\nSo the day I came there was a TON of people. Is this normal??! We had to wait for people to clear out at practically each exhibition... But for $10, I think it was worth the wait (and plus, no fussy kids around!). I actually didn't buy anything to drink because they were pretty pricy and small portions, but I DID do a little free wine tasting event there. Mehhh that was kind of a waste of time because the line for that was SO LONG. Took forever, and there were many jerks trying to cut. We were finally at the last station to taste test the good wine when someone triggered the fire alarm! I guess someone was having a jolly time... Despite ending the ~20 minutes early, I still had a LOT of fun!! I really want to come back again... hopefully with less people and explore a bit more. I missed out on the penguins :( We were gonna go there right after we taste test the wine but we were all sent outside just in case there really was a fire. Sucks for the people who did the coat checking... it was FREEZING that day.\n\nOverall, really fun experience with cool music playing the background.

My only annoyance were the very high drink prices ($7 for a beer; $8 for a smallish mixed drink using cheap booze); At least it was only $12 to get in.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time, despite the fact we arrived a bit late and missed out on planetarium passes for the night. After that we made all the right decisions, skipping the crowded front bar and grabbing a cocktail in the back bar (no line at all); Then we headed to the rain forest exhibit, just before a big line formed. We grabbed a bite and a beer at the excellent cafeteria, splurged on double dessert, and again left before it got mobbed there.  We spent the rest of the time chilling out downstairs in the aquarium area.  The best spot of all was the Philippines Reef room, where a DJ played some great ambient beats and we sat on the steps and watched the wall of sea life shift and change in front of us.

Physics Circus Nightlife, 06-17-10\n\n\"You know, Einstein had great hair, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh... yah?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I just love your hair...\"\n\nPICK UP LINE FAIL. And, wow, I sound like a creeper.\n\nI bet most of you would appreciate my pick up line failures. In fact, I will post some of them later one so you can revel in my self-deprecation. I tried using all of my science pick up lines that I came up with last summer (yeah, I had THAT much time on my hands, plus I was studying for the MCAT) at California Academy of Science's Physics Circus, and let's just say that my beat frequency, impulse, and astronomical references didn't exactly Hooke anyone like the law says it would. \n\nI met this way groovy physics teacher named Zeke. Zeke Kossover. By default, this guy is cool; his name is worth atleast 17 points on Word With Friends, and that's without landing on any double letter or triple word spot! He is a local high school physics teacher in San Francisco with plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Being a not-so-closet physics nerd, I was delighted to meet Zeke and sit front row center for the Physics Circus at Nightlife last Thursday.\n\nEveryone always says, \"you have to see it to believe it.\" This \"everyone\" person is absolutely correct. For those not so physics-minded in attendance last week, your minds were probably blown with you saw a leaf-blower hover craft, or that a ping-pong ball that DESTROYED an aluminum can. Or better yet, when you saw the physicist himself walk on glass and then immediately after, lay on a bed of nails. All of the exhibits from the Physics Circus were not magic, rather they abide by the laws of the universe. \n\nThis guy is clearly hovering under the influence.\n\nFirst, Zeke started off by non-nonchalantly breaking the bottom of a glass bottle out from the bottom. Simply using a mallet and smacking the mouthpiece creates such a force, that the bottom of the glass literally just pops right off, just like... (I'll let you finish that sentence). The cavity made by the air pressure is enough to break glass. Definitely a trick to show someone at your next bar fight!\n\n\n\nBest way to pick up chics in bars, with a mallet.\n\nBringing back terrible childhood memories where people used to spit wads at me, Zeke pulls out verying PVC pipes in which he uses as EXTREME spit wad launchers. Using marshmallows and exhaling was enough to peg special audience members. Straight from the man, we learned that the \"long one does the best.\" \n\n\n\nLook at that exhalation job!\n\nMy 5th favorite element, Nitrogen, came out to play later in the evening, in liquid form. In this elemental state, liquid nitrogen can freeze things super quickly, which is exactly what Zeke did. After we froze stuff, we then shattered, deformed, or nailed it into sheet rock. Liquid nitrogen can also be used to make ice cream! The coolest demonstration with liquid N was the illumination of the substance with a busted light bulb! One thing I learned from Thursday was that light bulbs have nitrogen in them! That basically means, don't try any of this at home.\n\n\n\nShattering balls like it's no one's business.\n\n\n\nHere's an idea...! Show me your moon and I'll show you my stars!\n\nLast, but definitely far from least, I watched Zeke take off his socks and shoes and walk barefoot on some broken glass. No cuts or bleeding here. The differential pressures and some mumbo jumbo about the weight (mass and gravity, here it is the force) on the glass makes the glass not cut you! (But again, don't try this at home!) After Zeke's walk through glass, he takes a rest on a bed of 1,500 nails. Man, what a hard day's work. It's not easy being a physicist. \n\n\n\nZeke walking on glass BAREFOOT!\n\n\n\nThen Zeke takes a rest on a bed of nails. This picture is amazing, I know. Hello audience member, happy to learn about physics?\n\n\n\nAnd then the genius decides to have a cinder block crushed on his chest in between two platforms of nails. Crazy? No. Science rules? YES.", "author": "Nicole P."}

The atmosphere is really nice, and even though it does get full, you can also have intimate moments (in the planetarium show or the elevator from the rainforest keke).

Real live animals and fishes, even a jelly fish area where you can pet star fishes. \n\nI did stand in line for the earthquake exhibit the last time I went.  The line was at least 15-20min long,. you also start to feel temperature hot, cause there isn't much of an AC in that area since they put the live OSTRICHES near it.

Therefore, I was pretty excited about attending the museum for the first time with an awesome date AND when they were serving cocktails. Win win I would say!!\n\nWe arrived pretty early, right around 6:30 I would say. We walked in right away as we already had tickets that were purchased online. We had done our research online so we knew that we should get Planetarium tickets and check out the rainforest first! We did try and get tickets but they were already sold out!!!!! We were shocked that every show was already sold out for the evening. Once we checked on the tickets we headed right for the rainforest. There wasn't really any line so we were able to walk right in. \n\nWord to the wise: LAYER! The rainforest is definitely quite hot. The rest of the museum in my opinion was pretty chilly. I thought the rainforest was pretty cool. There are butterflies that are just flying around shat you can just spot. I wasn't able to see any of the Macaw's so I'm not sure if they were just hiding or what. There were a lot of cool animal's and it was very cool how they were just roaming free and you were in there with them in their habitat. But it does get very very warm in here so prepare ahead of time for this in terms of clothing!\n\nThe aquarium is hat we checked out next and it is a very cool experience being able to see such a wide variety of see creatures. You are able to walk underneath the large aquarium tanks which is really quite interesting. Some of the highlights were the alligator, this massive, I mean absolutely massive!!!!, fish, in one of the tanks, and the jellyfish. There were so many amazing things in the aquarium it is something you shouldn't miss. \n\nWe also checked out the Living Roof which did have some lovely views. I would recommend they put a few of those lovely standing heaters out there for this event as I would give it a very cool romantic vibe that would make people want to stand out there during this event and hang out more as otherwise it is FREEZING out here!\n\nAlthough the Planetarium show had \"sold out\" of the tickets earlier, we heard tha there was a stand by line that would start before the showing at 8:30. We found the line and did wait in that and they said we had a good shot at getting in to see the showing. After a little while of waiting we were able to get in to see the show so they hadn't actually sold all of their tickets! The show itself was really too long and not that interesting. I got fairly bored and i thought they could have condensed the showing because it wasn't that thrilling and it seemed to drag on a little bit too long.\n\nThe night we were here was \"How To\" night so there were events like How To DJ, How To Mixology, etc. We didn't do a lot of these events personally but we were able to check them out and had a lot of fun people watching to say the least. Definitely a lot of entertainment. \n\nThe drinks here are a little on the pricey side for the size of the beverage that you get but they are fairly generous with the amount of alcohol in them. We had Jack&Coke's and I could definitely taste the Jack in mine and so could my date. \n\nThis is really a fun date and something completely different that you can do with someone.

This time around, barely anyone around the whole night.\n\nSecond, what's up with the music?! Upstairs, it was okay. I tried to dance to the music but I just wasn't feeling it. Downstairs, it was better. Better music, more people...and you're dancing with the fish but still, not like the last time I was here.\n\nThird, what happened to the planetarium show? I expected to see Fragile Planet. Instead, I got this monotone guy talking about the planet from another site and doing computer stuff...putzing around. My friend and I fell asleep. \n\nOne of the highlights was looking at the scary fishies in the jars. One of the staff members/volunteers(?) talked about the unique fish. Encouraging us to touch the dead (but real) fish. No thank you. I got to see the female and male version of that scary fish from the depths of the sea (remember scary flashlight character from Finding Nemo...yea, HIM!) The Deep Sea Angler. Cool! My interpretation about how they reproduce? The male fish is downsized to his gonads when he finds his female. Bwahaha. Women rule! :) Wikipedia it for more dirty details.

So of course, I love going to Nightlife. Sure, we love going during the day, but there's something awesome about those themed drinks. Plus it's great to see Claude, Pierre (and company), and Lemondrop (and the last time I was there he was actually moving!). \n\nThe thing that is slightly frustrating is that even if we get there for the opening, we seem to always just narrowly miss the things we came to do in the first place.

It'd be a great date spot because aquarium has kind of a club/intimate vibe and the rooftop is a good stargazing spot when it's not too cold. There's also plenty to look at and talk about, which could be good if you need a neutral activity to help conversation along. That said, we went in a group of friends and that was also fun. It'd be a tricky place to go in a group bigger than 4-5 because it's a little loud and crowded to move around with a crew.\n\nOptions for the night include special activities having to do with the theme, rotating museum exhibits, music, the planetarium, the rooftop, the rainforest, and the aquarium. There's really something for everyone, no matter how extensive or limited your interesting/knowledge of science. \n\nWe didn't go with an agenda and therefore didn't see half the stuff...it's a pretty short window to fit in all the sights when you take lines and stuff into consideration. Definitely go on time. If you're really set on certain exhibits, it's not a bad idea to make a plan of attack for the night because it's easy to be distracted and lines can be long! \n\nI think the prices are pretty reasonable for such an unusual activity. $12 for standard entry and $5-10 for drinks. Unfortunately, the lot is a little pricey so it's best if you can take public transportation--$15 flat rate in the garage after 5:30pm (someone wrote a good tip about validating the ticket when you park, rather than when you leave to avoid the line at the pay point). \n\nI'll be back, definitely!", "author": "Lauren J."}

I've been coming to this museum ever since I was little and I have always loved it. I remember the huge shark tank from the old museum that I was always so dreadfully scared of but also so intrigued by. That was probably my favorite exhibit from when I was a kid. But the renovated museum looks amazing! \n\nWhen I found out about the NightLife event, I was not 21 yet and so sort of just forgot about it until my friend mentioned the museum to me. Then I just HAD to go. I love that it's half price for this event AND everything in the museum is still opened! Honestly, I think spending 4 hours gives me enough joy already. I love that there is always a different theme each Thursday night. I really love going into the aquarium because I feel so lost in there and like I'm in a completely different world. I also really like that they brought the African Exhibit from the old museum to the renovated one. I remember being so interested in this exhibit, trying to figure out if the animals were real or fake as a kid. Then the penguins at the end will always throw me off. This museum brings a lot of memories, and I love that now I can come for half price PLUS there are drinkkkks. And there's music, what's not to love about it?\n\nI recommend coming early to this event because the Planetarium tickets always run out super quick. I always buy my ticket at home first so that I can avoid that line in the front. Even though I always seem to miss the Planetarium events because I'm always late, I still have an amazing time with each visit.", "author": "Cynthia B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-12", "description": "(review for NightLife only)\n\nNightLife is a fun weekday night activity to do with a group or for a date.  It's very \"typical SF\" to me to combine education / science / technology, food / drink, culture / museums etc all into one event.  The admission is only $12 which is a nice discount off the main admission price.  It is the same price regardless of whether you purchase in advance or at the door (the former allows you to avoid the line, which adds an extra 10 min or so).  \n\nThere are a number of exhibits offered, including the planetarium shows, myriad aquariums downstairs, multi-level rainforest (with living roof), etc.  It is a good mix of birds, reptiles/creepy crawlies, & aquatic animals in the exhibits.  \n\nPeople tend to dress up pretty nice for this event even though there is no dress code.  It gets pretty crowded (although not to the point where it detracfts from the experience) and I often run into at least one person I know when I go.  Pretty good people watching experience in general as well.  \n\nThe food and drinks are pretty good but unsurprisingly kind of overpriced (what do you expect? they have a captive audience!).  The drink stands are cash only (and the prices are kind of awkward so you unless you have tons of change you either end up leaving a very large or very small tip.  However, the food court (which sells beer/wine) does take CCs.  Beware you cannot take your drinks into the planetarium or rainforest.\n\nIt has a theme every week (and changes its music / drink special / maybe few other small attractions accordingly), but for the most part it is the same.  This isn't a negative comment necessarily...just something of which to be aware, since in their emails they try to market it as a totally unique experience every single week, which is not really the case.\n\nThis is a fun event to take visitors to SF (perhaps combine it w/ a visit to the Park or the Haight earlier in the afternoon).  Everyone I have brought has enjoyed it and wished their city has something like it.  The Exploratorium has a similar event but it is only offered once a month.  \n\nMain downside in my experience is accessibility -- parking is often or hard to find, it's kind of annoyingly expensive to do cabs both ways, and public transportation is also not exactly close the actual building.", "author": "Molly B."}

I suspect it had something to do with the novelty of it being new to me, but it was fun nonetheless. I've seen pictures of previous events and comparatively, this crowd was really light. But it's getting cold so maybe that's why. In any case, I'll be bringing everyone I know in the coming months.  You should too.\n\n$12 isn't bad for entrance to a cool museum and bonus(es), you get to drink, there's music, and you don't have to deal with kids. I like kids, but they're annoying at museums. \n\nAmple bar stations and decent selection of beer, wine, liquor, and mixers for this type of event. $7-8 for cocktails, $2 more for red bull. It should be noted I saw several flasks, so you could definitely do it up right on a tight budget.\n\nThe rainforest was neat, the aquarium even better, and the planetarium show blew my mind. Cool little hands-on stuff to keep you busy. Learned about and touched a python and a starfish and enjoyed a rousing mini-lecture about penis bones (which almost all animals, except humans, have). \n\nGood DJ choices, at least on the night I was there; kinda funky, organic stuff, perfect for wandering around a science museum. There was one person dancing all night and right before 10, a few couples joined. With a bigger crowd, I think more dancing could happen, but as it was my first visit, I was fine with just checking out the exhibits.\n\nRecommended itinerary: Get there early (why not?), coat check (FREE!), drink while you grab tickets for one of the hourly planetarium shows, rainforest (no drinks), drink while you wander, planetarium (no drinks), drink more while you wander, pick up your coat and take the bus home!\n\nTotally accessible via public transit from the south bay/peninsula. On the way there, I took BART to Civic Center, then the 71 bus to dinner and a drink on Haight, then walked into the park. On the way home, I took the 21 bus from Fulton St back to Market to catch BART. \n\nI will report back to increase to 5 stars if the crowd livens up.", "author": "Bethany M."}

I do love that they are so Eco-friendly and state of the art. I like many things....\nI do not get why I have not been able to find a gem area...there has to be one, but I have yet to find it.

Very pricey, but overall, it's worth it because it's not the crap quality you get at almost every other public tourist attraction in the bay area. \nParking sucks just as it did before. If you can find street parking within the park then take the time to find it cuz the garage parking is insanely expensive! Just going here for a couple hours and parking in their garage, you will pay a minimum of $50 just for parking and one adult admission. INSANE!

Most of the time there is also a food or alcoholic  beverage pairing that goes with the theme. They also have, cash only, bars located all over the place. Usually there is a different custom cocktail at each station that goes with the theme of the night. \n\nThis past week was Bourbon and Bull. They were passing out free samples of Bullet Bourbon and there was a mechanical bull to ride. (Unfortunately the bull was missing some parts and they were not able to get it operational in time for the event.) \n\nThey also had a food stand that was serving three dishes and deserts. (There was no vegetarian option which I found to be a little strange.) They had shrimp and grits, a pulled pork sandwich, and pork ribs. I ended up order the Shrimp and grits, it was a decent sized serving for only $4. \n\nThe dish was great. The grits were cheese, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and they gave me about 12 of them and they were a good size. The dish was topped with a bourbon glazed candied bacon and cilantro. Not going to lie, it was some of the best bacon I have ever had.

So when my chic, young San Franciscan co-workers recruited me for a night of cocktails at the science museum, naturally I was intrigued.\n\nI arrived about 15 minutes early and was a little overwhelmed by the throngs of people waiting to get in--even in the advance ticket purchase line.  (I get a discount through work, so purchased mine ahead of time online.)  Once the line started moving, though, we were inside pretty quickly.  But not before the bouncer/ID checker guy questioned the validity of my license.  He was funny about it, but apparently I've lost so much weight since the picture was taken that he wasn't sure it was me.  I assured him it was, he laughed, voila.\n\nThe first of the bars was right near the door.  The drinks were good, but my goodness, you pay for them.  $6 beers, $7 wines, and cocktails \"starting at $7\" didn't really mean anything, since my  old standby rum and diet was $9.  It was delicious, but it had better be for $9.  We went downstairs and gawked at some fish and eels for a while, when, much to my delight, they opened the aquatic petting zoo.  Zing.  May I just say, you haven't lived until you've \"pet\" a sea urchin with one hand and swigged a cocktail with the other.  Bless the poor, sweet hearts of the women staffing that exhibit during NightLife.  I can only imagine explaining about the seven-legged starfish to the dude slurring after his fifth $9 Jack and Coke.  But, you know, it was fun.\n\nWe played with some more exhibits upstairs, were fed free peach slices (I didn't quite catch the backstory on that one), and we went for a second round.  For me, a watermelon margarita, also $9.  You know, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  It wasn't bad, either, never mind that I had to pound it in order to make it into the drinks-free planetarium before the 7:30 show started.\n\nThe planetarium feature on earthquakes was especially fun in a room full of buzzed revelers. Ground tremors?  Funny?  Apparently after a drink or three.  We then walked around the museum, blowing kisses to the live ostriches and checking out the Olympics-themed festivities that night: some sort of rowdy version of table tennis, cornholing (?!), flag-making, what have you.\n\nIt was a fun night, and I'd go back.  It's expensive, though, considering the price of tickets PLUS the price of the booze.  And on a side-note, lots of attractive young professionals fresh from work in button-downs and pressed slacks.  Lots of couples on first dates.  The people watching is pretty great.", "author": "Erin W."}

I think by the time I got there, a lot of the exhibits were closed so I wasn't able to experience the whole academy of science part so I have to come back for that during the day. A lot of people just come here, buy a drink or two, and just stand and socialize. Since I'm not much of a drinker, I found this night life to be quite boring so I guess this isn't really my scene. I lived in berkeley at the time so the drive wasn't that bad but if I was coming from San Jose to sf on a Thursday night, I would have second thoughts.

I heard the place was sold out for the night, so there was basically 4,000 people roaming the California Academy of Science.  There was so many long lines that it got pretty insane!\n\nWe were all informed about the Planetarium and Bugs 3D show.  We were told that the passes would be given out 45 minutes before each showtime.  I was glad to hear about this, after reading a lot of yelp reviews stating the passes sell out very quick.  \n\nI showed up at the planetarium at 6:45pm, and we got in line to get tickets.  A few minutes later, one of the workers tells us that all the passes are sold out for the night!  I was really shocked about this, since they were not supposed to hand out all the tickets for all the shows immediately.  The workers are supposed to wait 45 minutes before the showtime.  I noticed a lot of people were super frustrated, shocked, and disappointed that they couldn't watch the Planetarium show.  I know I was really disappointed myself. =(  \n\nI asked the worker if they allowed people to enter the show if there were empty seats.  The worker told me its sold out.  Even though they handed out all the tickets, I know that there will be some empty seats.  I was a bit surprised that they wouldn't let people inside considering there are empty seats, too.\n\nThe same thing happened at the Bugs 3D show.  The workers handed out all the passes early instead of waiting 45 minutes before each showtime.  There was a lot of frustrated and disappointed people.\n\nI think it is just wrong that the workers didn't stick to the rule, and the rule was 45 minutes before the showtime.  Since all the passes were given out early, I was unable to see any of the shows. =(\n\nI tried to line up for the rainforest, but there were guards preventing people from lining up.  It was only 7pm! \n\nOverall, I was only able to check out the Aquarium, Living roof, and the other exhibits.  I don't think I'll go back considering its hard to get tickets for the shows.

I recommend getting there at 6pm so you can get tickets to the planetarium because they pretty much sell out of tickets by the first hour. \n\nAnother plus about the nightlife is that its about half the price of the day pricing, so thats great.

All in one place you can get schooled, all liquored up and even dance the night away...well at least until 10 PM when everything closes and they kick you out. \n\nJust to forewarn you, the peeps here dress like they are going out to a night club, so you might want to ditch the cut offs before you get to the bouncer, I mean doorway. \n\nDon't expect this to be a cheap date.

Everything you'd ever want in a night out is there--a DJ, good music, food, alcohol and...aquariums filled with tropical fish!

Food and drink are quite pricey inside, so I would avoid that, but it's not so bad if you go for it. I've never had the chance to go to the Planetarium (you have to get there early), but hope to go soon.

Back when they still had the \"outer space area\", we just called it the \"Planitarium\".\n\nI'm sad they removed the outer space thing, that was great!  You sat in a theater/cinema-like room, where all the seats were in a circle, and the ceiling above you was a round dome-- the ceiling was also the \"movie screen\" so to speak!  lol.  They would turn off the lights and use the dome-ceiling screen to show you breath-taking views of outer space!

I also like that it's a very relaxed atmosphere.\n\nI also like the music the DJ's play as well. It gets poppin' there a little later when more people show up, and more people are in that one area where you can dance to the music the DJ's are playing, and where you can watch the plasma screen TV's. That area kind of has a club atmosphere to it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-13", "description": "Loud, resounding MEH. \n\nWhen I first visited the newly renovated CA Academy of Sciences, I was so disappointed that it compelled me to open a Yelp account to warn others.  \n\nI mean:\n\nDINOSAURS?\nGONE!\n\nSHARKS?\nNO MORE!\n\nCHILDHOOD MEMORIES?\nSHATTERED!\n\nI decided to give it another try, though.  People have been talking about how awesome Nightlife at the Academy is, so I decided to check it out.  It seemed like something new and different to do on a Thursday night, and I'm always looking for new and different things to do.  Plus, popular science is right up my alley.  \n\nAite, this will be a list of tips for interested museum-goers, and how you should plan your visit:\n\n1.  BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE at least 4 days in advance!  And then PRINT IT OUT AT HOME!  I cannot stress how important this is.  If you don't buy them online, you'll have to wait in a long-ass line on the day of.  And if you don't print them out at home, you'll have to wait in a line at the service desk for them to print them out the day of.  I made the mistake of not printing my tickets out at home, and so even though I showed up early, I still didn't get into line till almost 6pm because of the museum's poor planning.  They brought out these service desks 10 minutes late (5:40pm), couldn't figure out how to turn on their computers for 15 minutes, and when they finally did, they had to face a line of angry-looking patrons.  Apologies for the rambling, but you get the point.  Buy it online; print it at home.\n\n2.  As soon as you get into the museum, run to the planetarium and snatch up your tickets.  They go FAST.  The planetarium is actually quite small, and I think they only do 3 showings a night, so you'll thank yourself for doing this early.  My suggestion is you try to get tickets for the 6:30pm show; it's 30 minutes long and quite good.\n\n3.  After you get out of the planetarium, get yourself a drink if you're feeling it and then wait in line for the rainforest after you get that drink.  WARNING:  Drinks are, as expected, quite expensive.  You can pregame if you want, but because the tickets to Nightlife are cheap(er), I think it's okay to get a drink here.   \n\n4.  After strolling through the HOT HOT HOT sweltering rainforest (take it offfff!),  go anywhere.  Places of interest: the aquarium downstairs, the living roof, the African Hall.  Lame places you should skip out on: the middle floor with nothing but artwork and that area in the back with hands-on stuff.  \n\n5.  Post-academy, the Inner Sunset is a great, safe place to eat a late dinner or to just hang out and drink.  I think almost all the restaurants here are pretty reliable.  Just a five-minute walk from the Academy.\n\nSo, as far as the exhibits themselves, the planetarium is the most awesome.  The show is pretty beautiful and, in some ways, inspiring in the same way that An Inconvenient Truth was.  A green message, but without all the overt, annoying in-your-face-ness that some other places tend to do when packaging Green-ness. \n\nEverything else was kind of lackluster.  Nightlife wasn't as exciting as the website makes it out to be.  Props to that design team for making the event look awesome; y'all certainly fooled me.  I couldn't find any DJ, MC, and it's not really a party of any sort.  More like just...a night...at the museum.  \n\nFinal word: Cool place to take out-of-towners to impress them with something uniquely SF, but I won't be going back for a while.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Basically you look around the museum for a bit then when the dance floor gets more crowded you can start dancing (the lights are on still and the dj wasnt too bad). Get planetarium tickets early as there is a limited supply for the 3 different times. (we went to the last showing at 845). Notable attractions include the rain forest (you will sweat as its really humid and watch out for bird poop) penguins, aquarium, albino alligator, the garden on the roof, and that day they had a telescope showing of saturn (which was probably the coolest thing I saw that day)\n\nOverall its a decent experience that Im glad I was able to take part in but would probably only come back if there was a better event such as salsa dancing or something more interesting than cheese.\n\n**Use coupon code 900050 at checkout (up to 4 people) to get $3 off regular price ($12) and to avoid the ticket lines.**", "author": "Robert Y."}

I was like umm...hmmm....ehhh--No, I think I'll pass, as I had a pre-conceived notion that it would be some sort of dork fest (I was WRONG). \n\nPast forward 2 weeks, I received an invite on FB, looked at the website and thought hey...drinks, food, and dj at the remodeled Academy of Sciences--sounds interesting and may be a good change from lounges/bars. I'm SO GLAD I went.\n\nCOVER: $10, well worth it as I think the cost is normally $25 on weekdays. We arrived just before 6PM and there was at least a good 150+ already in line. So come early...\n\nPARKING: Street parking--COME EARLY! But note, no street parking after 10 PM; I guess this is the reason why it ends at 10PM? You can park at the garage, but it's $10--ouch!\n\nMUSIC: They change up the DJs weekly. On the night of 3/5, they had some type of funk music.\n\nDRINKS: They had about 4-5 bars and even though it was packed, it didn't take more than a couple of minutes to get a drink. A beer was $6-7 and cocktails were $7-8. Just to note, cocktails were watered down--go-figure, so it took me 3 to get a buzz (btw I'm a light-weight).\n\nFOOD: They had sandwiches ($8-9), small platter trays (cheese & meat, pita and hummus, etc), chicken salad, cold pastas, etc.  We shared 2 platters which were $12 each and tasted as it was sitting there all day. Pita was hard as a rock and heavily salted, the cheese was hard--well what do you expect? So, I would suggest eating around Irving before or after coming here.\n\nCROWD: Mixed; mainly young professionals in their 20s-30s.\n\nNow on to the good stuff...\n\nI haven't been to the Academy of Sciences since my 8th grade field trip and I've lived in the city all my life--how sad. It was amazing to explore all the exhibits and watch the Planetarium show (6:30PM, 7:30PM, and 8:30PM) especially when you're BUZZED--IT'S A MUST (think Raver days w/o the green triangles). In fact, it was funny to see people walking around with their eyes half open exploring the exhibits--CLASSIC! They even had some benches in front of the aquarium, so you can enjoy a drink while staring into the bright blue water with pretty fishes.\n\nGUYS: This is a great place to take a date, especially if you're not much of a talker. Just make sure you both have some drinks beforehand to loosen up and you can just go explore the exhibits w/o even having to say a word to each other!\n\nLADIES: Unless you want to hop down through the theater chairs (if you do, don't wear your stiletto heels and skirt) and chance falling smack down on your face, remember to head to the ladies room before going to see the Planetarium show especially after having several drinks. Otherwise, be prepared to be cursing the number of credits you have to sit through after the show. :X\n\nI believe the event will be happening until October, so I'm sure I'll be back a couple of more times! :)", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Although the presenter was very thorough and knowledgeable about the specs of the Mars Curiosity landing, 5 minutes in and I wished it was Whoopi Goldberg or Christian Bale narrating it.  (Would be legiiiiiiiiiiit!) I'm a talker during such presentations, so I was able to stay entertained and awake in the dimly lit dome.  However, all in all, despite some technical difficulties, you just have to see one of the museum's Planetarium shows at least once, you have to.\n\nVerdict:  NightLife at the museum is a rare and novel way to experience the city and the museum that I'd recommend everyone to try at least once.  As guests must be at least 21, the museum has a completely different feel--a happening hotspot and a tad bit classy.  From the Planetarium, to poking sea urchin and starfish, to the bar, to going through a short tunnel to the Eel Garden, to the outdoor stage bouncing to an Icelandic folk-indie band, NightLife at the museum was unique and exciting!

The inside of the planetarium is amazing.... \n\nTonight's theme was fungi. There were some fungi related booths sporadically spread around the museum. The 6:30pm show vaguely touched on the featured theme. Hopefully future themed-shows will have a larger connection to its theme. Our game plan was to visit as many exhibits as possible and skip the frills of the cocktails & food. There were mini bars all around! My favorite would be on the lower floor which featured some reptiles (go see the alligator! it is a something you wouldn't want to miss) and aqua life!

Ah, here goes, I was bored. \nThe reason being could be for many reasons, one, that I've been to the Academy of Sciences during the day numerous times, therefore it was nothing new besides having a glass of wine in my hand, the lights turned down low and a trendy DJ's. Another reason why I was bored? The atrium closes at 8:30, so thats one less thing to be able to explore. Also, unless you can get there right at 6:30, you don't have much of a chance seeing the planetarium or the earthquake demonstration. Not going to lie, personally I don't want to spend my night waiting in lines. Bummer. Last complaint, the prices! Here is a rundown of my night. $12 admission (half the daytime ticket so that's a plus) $15 for parking (straight fee) $14 for some fried chicken and fries, and $10 for a glass of wine.  $50 at the least for this event which I stayed at for two hours. Not something I would do again. But something SFers should try once.", "author": "Kat E."}

During the week I was in San Francisco, this may have been the most fun thing we did all week. True bromance.\n\nIt's a pretty date heavy event with not a lot of singles, so it's not really much of a meat market. Fantastic place to take a date, though. Make sure you do a little pregaming, and then keep it going with the $6-10 drinks, depending on how much you want to class it up ($6 for beer, $7 wine, $8-10 mixed drinks).\n\nFor the dudes: invite the best-looking and most museum-loving girl you know, and bring her to this. Get there around 6ish if you want to get tickets for the planetarium (I wasn't able to, but I've heard it's worth it). There's food there, so you don't have to take her out to dinner first. Plan on going to a bar or some other stop afterwards, at around 10.\n\nFor the ladies: there's lots of good-looking people here, but if you don't want to be bothered, you won't be. Grab a friend or make the dude who keeps calling you pick you up at 5:30 and take a drive out to the Golden Gate park for a night out at the Academy of Sciences. Even if he's a quiet guy, you'll have plenty to do there to keep it moving along.\n\nOverall: I thought this place was great. They've taken a great thing (cool science museum) and made it even better by adding alcohol and a DJ. The DJ was spinning some pretty good lounge/dance music all night with people on the dance floor, and I had a lot of fun drinking and learning about Stellarium (you'll know when you go there), conservation, and marine life.\n\nDid I mention they serve alcohol at this place? Call up that girl or guy you've been waiting to take out on a date and go to this. It'll be a good night.", "author": "Pete V."}

If you're over the age of 21, I think this is the only way you should visit the museum.  The general admission price is significantly cheaper, and you can definitely see all of the exhibits without the intrusion of little children.  There's also tables of alcohol scattered around the museum.  (All drinks are under $10 each.)   Their cafeteria is open the whole time, and some of the alcohol tables also have little snacks.\n\nI loved the overall ambiance.  The background music is a mix of techno, Top 40's and classic rock.  It's a little trippy since you feel like you're in a bar/club, especially when you're walking around in the dark aquarium, where most of the lights are coming off strategically placed mood lights, and or the tanks of jellyfish.\n\nDespite my raves, I'm only giving my experience 4 stars, instead of 5, because of how crowded it got inside the museum.\n\nI'd recommend showing up early (~5:30 or earlier) since the line for admission gets pretty ridiculously long.  (By 6pm, when they started letting people in, the line was wrapping back around towards the front.)  If you get there relatively early in the night, I recommend veering straight through the left as soon as you walk inside, because you will want to pick up *free* tickets for the planetarium show, which they have limited numbers of each week.  (There will of course be a line to get these *free* tickets if you show up later.)  \n\nGet your drinks early because the lines for booze will get very long later in the night.  The lines are also longer on the first floor.\n\nHowever, once you have a drink in hand, there's certain exhibits that you *won't* be able to walk into, so plan your drinking accordingly:\n-- the rainforest exhibit,  -- the snakes/reptiles exhibits\n\nThere may be different guest speakers in the main plaza, but the acoustics in there are terrible, so you won't be able to hear anything besides mumbling if you're not standing at a good angle to the stage.\n\nOverall, a good experience.

Unfortunately, it's really not worth the wait, I guess, because I found that you are just herding yourself through it instead of really focusing.\n\nThe availability of alcohol at post-premium prices made me laugh. Alas, I remind myself that this was a night club of sorts, so when I saw people carrying plastic cups of some kind of alcohol I couldn't help but chortle. However, that's what makes this so awesome. Drinks served at a museum with dance music being played by a DJ near the Galapagos Islands exhibit!

I'd recommend coming in by public transit or carpooling as much as possible.\n\nGreat use of time, but personally, I'd rather do this kind of thing at an art museum than science museum.

Tickets are $12 online.\n\nWe got there around 5:40ish and there was already a short line that grew a lot over the next 20 minutes. Follow the crowd and get the planetarium tickets first. I think if you come before 6, you should be able to grab tickets. We went to the rain forest first since there wasn't any line and since there are no drinks allowed and we hadn't got ours yet. Later on in the night, there was a line for the rain forest. Next, we went down to the aquarium where there was a bar with no line (the one upstairs had long lines) Got the nightlife cocktail. Walked around the aquarium and the other exhibits there while waiting for our planetarium show. It was the \"new\" planetarium show which had REALLY cool visual effects and was kind of interesting because of the animation, but to be honest, the show was kind of boring. But overall, the academy of science nightlife is definitely worth checking out.", "author": "Thao V."}

Admission was $10 per person (members) or $12 (non-members). The crowd throughout the museum was mostly people in their 20s to 40s. On the main floor you can hear the DJ spinning which is a great change of pace and mood setting to its quiet daytime atmosphere otherwise frequented by teachers, students, parents, and tourists.\n\nThe line to the Rainforest was moderately long and it was too crowded inside. The humidity was a bit unbearable for a native San Franciscan like myself who's been around fog and wind chills all my life. If you like the tropics you will definitely be home in this sphered space. The walk-through around the Academy was a bit more crowded to what I've seen during the daytime. It was nice to be able to enjoy alcoholic beverages about the establishment while conversing at above-normal speaking volume too with all the going-ons of the evening. The living roof is nice too at night with the light beaming through the  windows. \n\nOverall it was a nice outing to the Academy of Sciences. I recommend it and will definitely come back for more.

Up close and personal with the dissection team (beware the room smells not so fresh). Guaranteed first pick for seating in the Planetarium (super cool)\n\nHonestly? You can enjoy the night without VIP. The tour took up the time you could be spending exploring the vast aquarium downstairs, or any of the other exhibits.

The $12 entrance fee is worth it, but they don't offer AAA discount (regular hours only). I suggest coming here early if you want to see the planetarium, because the tickets go out fast until 6:30pm. Also they close the rainforest at 7:30pm.\n \nSince it's 21+, you get to wander around the kid-less museum, listen to music, and gaze at the incredible aquariums with a drink in your hand. However, the planetarium and the rainforest doesn't allow food or drinks, but that's pretty reasonable.\n\nThe cafeteria has a variety of food to choose from, but it is over priced. I had my eyes on the $5 mac & cheese for a while... and I don't regret getting it! It had the baked crust with a hint of onion, so it was yummy and satisfying. My friend got 2 spring rolls for $8, and that was decent as well.\n\nAs for drinks it's the typical prices from $6 to $9, but you can get the $3 special from 6-7pm. And there are plenty of stocked bars throughout the museum. I saw three on the main floor, one on the aquarium floor, and another on the second floor.  Their beer selections are from North Coast Brewing, and I got their Blue Star which wasn't bad for a wheat beer.\n\nIn the African Hall is nothing but taxidermy, but at the end of it you can see the live penguins getting their sleep. Another interesting thing to see is the albino alligator (not crocodile) staying perfectly still in his swamp. You can touch rough sea stars and prickly sea urchins at the Discovery Tidepool. If it's a clear night, you get a chance to use the telescope on the Living Roof, but bring a jacket if you do.\n\nOverall it's worth going if you like aquarium, planetarium, and natural history museum. It's the newest and one of the largest museum, and you can definitely have a fun experience with your friends there. Get there early for a good free parking spot on the street, or pay at their underground garage. Either way it closes at the same time as the museum.", "author": "Zha L."}

But I noticed that mostly everyone was staying within their own group, talking amongst themselves.

Well what if I could tell you that you could eliminate all those annoying brats (I love kids though) and just enjoy the aquarium for what it is? Welcome Nightlife.\n\nSimply put, Nightlife is the Academy of Sciences minus the kids plus MORE. It's pretty much a huge lounge filled with DJs, music, and lights; they also have bars on every level. You basically kill two birds with one stone here at the Nightlife by visiting the Aquarium and going out/drinking at the same time. But the drinks are a bit pricey but I guess they need to make money somehow for putting on an exhibit like this. But the best part is that it's only $12, where as the day price is somewhere along $30. You pay $12 for EVERYTHING (minus the kids) plus live DJs and music...you get my point right?\n\nThere's also a planetarium show that runs about once an hour. You basically line up (it's not that long) to get tickets beforehand and each person is limited to about 5, but you can just keep coming back for more to save for your friends. How cool is it? It depends on who is running the show. The guy who ran our show was incredibly boring and his jokes were incomprehensible (it's pretty comfy inside though if you want to take a nap...). I need to come back to see another screening to see what all the \"hype\" is about.\n\nThey'll also have special events from time to time in addition to the Aquarium itself.

We didn't try the food but it did smell great and looked tasty.\n\nExhibits:  You can read about all of them in the reviews and online - they really are fun, lots of different things to see.  I'm a sucker for underwater stuff and the seahorses were so amazing to see and my favorite part.  We didn't make it to the planitereum but perhaps in the future.  Lots of music is playing and it's good, like really good and so many types.\n\n*People don't get smashed here, maybe a little tipsy and that definitely made me happy.  It's a great feel and not too many crazy people so you can't walk around and find things easily.  it was a lovely experience and I would certaintely encourage others to go.", "author": "Sabrina A."}

I went on a date here and honestly I was more interested in the exhibits than I was in her (well not entirely true but it didn't work out anyway).\n\nWhether you're with a large group of friends or a significant other, I think NightLife is a nice before-weekend attraction. Granted it was my first time going so I'm not sure how repeat visits will be but for first timers who've never seen the museum before or only seen it during the day, it can only get better when you have some alcohol in you.\n\nSpeaking of which, the drinks are a bit pricey but they have to make money somehow. Make sure you have cash as the bartenders don't take plastic. They also serve food here but you can probably find better food in the city and at a cheaper price.\n\nI went on a Space Themed event so this meant the Planetarium had a special video for the evening, some DJs set up a small dance floor near the Pendulum area, and an author held a book reading and signing in the African Hall. Everything else was pretty much the same as when I went to the Academy during day time. \n\nI can't speak for the Planetarium as my date did not want to see the video (I was like, are you serious? It's 180 degrees of AWESOME on screen!). But being the nice guy that I was, I hid my frown and went with her to the other exhibits. I had seen the Planetarium during the day time before so I wasn't terribly disappointed. But I highly recommend newcomers to grab a ticket for the Planetarium as soon as they arrive on site.\n\nI love the aquarium's in the lower levels. There's just something about blue water, colorful reefs, and strange fish that just calms me down. \n\nThe Rainforests of the World exhibit is also still open as long as there is day light. You can't bring drinks in there as it will ruin the ecosystem but it's a fun, warm place to go early in your trip. Which reminds me, you should come as EARLY AS POSSIBLE to the Academy. It gets really crowded after 8pm.\n\nThe Living Roof was also a beautiful view. I missed the sun setting when I went up there but I assume it would've been a good vista. It's also quiet up there if you want to escape the crowds and have an intimate conversation (at least before 8pm).\n\nOverall a nice place to place to visit on Thursdays.", "author": "Kevin A."}

Most exhibits don't allow drinks, and it's always nice that they have fun games. The first time I went, they had huge games for us to enjoy. Super large jenga? Huge connect four?

I take great pride now in wearing my geeky apparel while making geeky references about geeky topics.\n\nI am also a huge fan of EtOH.\n\nThe beauty of Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences is that it combines both my loves into one location. I went to the one on December 15th, the \"Bazaar Bizzare,\" and found it fun. There were a lot of vendors who were selling their goods. Although I'm all for small businesses and increasing their profits, the items were a bit pricey for my depleted wallet. \n\nWandering around and meeting the reindeer was quite fun, though. The last time I was there was roughly six months ago. Nothing much has changed, but it was still interesting to walk around and reminisce about how there used to be an earthquake exhibit and how that was the only reason I would step foot there.\n\nI knocked one star off because of the pricey drinks. $9 for a drink that only cost $1.50 to make? Come on.\n\nHowever, there are many pros to venturing out here on a Thursday night.\n-It is only $12 to get in ($10 for me, I typed in \"destinysf\" and got $2 off each ticket online).\n-Great place to socialize and learn.\n-Docents are awesome - very passionate and knowledgeable about their work - big thumbs up to the guy who explained that certain animals (PRICC) have penis bones while others (humans, etc) do not. Very humorous and would be a great person to get people interested in science. I also have to give a big thumbs up to the reindeer lady, who had to stand out in the blistering cold to explain to people that reindeer were, in fact, real. \n-Music was pretty awesome. Tonight it was an electronic-type group.... it varied from dubstep-like sounds to more upbeat and faster paced electronica.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. It is worth the money to get in, but I might \"pre-party\" beforehand since the drinks will pierce a hole in your wallet.", "author": "Christina B."}

The climate controlled rain forest is really awesome. They showcase four different rain forests from around the world. Make sure to hit this first, it closes before everything else.\n\nOn their \"living roof\", they have telescopes for star gazing and attendants to tell you what planet.

I told him she is ditsy like that, do not mind her.\n\nTheir  aquarium is big. It takes up most of the bottom floor, and it is very diverse.

The Albino Alligator was doing some crazy barrel roll thing in the water and Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake was roaming around his enclosure.  \n\nI definitely recommend having a few happy hour drinks beforehand or getting there pretty early because during the peak of the event (around 8:30-9:00) it is really hard to get a drink because the lines are so long.

Plan to get there early if you want Planetarium tickets, which are first come first serve.  The line starts forming around 5:30pm, but they don't actually open up the doors until 6pm.

A temperature and humidity controlled compartment within the Academy with butterflies flitting around everywhere.  This is my favorite section but they do close early to let the animals rest.  \n\nIt then spits you out into the Aquarium, a decent sized one with your standard of coral reefs, octopus, jelly fish, seahorses, reef sharks, sting rays, and an albino alligator.  \n\nThe Planetarium show, Life, started out promising... but ended up being just a dull super dumb-ed down \"life begins with water\" story that had little to do with exploring the planets.

I've been here several times over the past year and a half and every single time has been a truly refreshing experience. Every Thursday night for only $12 from 6-10 PM, you get to visit all of the exhibits in the museum! It's a great date location or to just hang out with a group of friends. Note the event is for adults 21+ and some people do dress up as there's a clubby atmosphere with alcohol and a live DJ playing. Not only do you avoid all the little children and strollers, but you also save money since general admission during the day is ~$30 for adults. There is a different theme every week so check the website for upcoming special lectures, presentations, or performances. Depending on the theme and time of the year, the crowd can be mixed, skew younger, or skew older. For example, late August/early September and early January tends to have a lot of young 20-somethings who've just started school at nearby UCSF, USF, Hastings, Berkeley, SFSU, Stanford and others.\n\nI recommend this roadmap upon entry: head over to the Planetarium and select a showtime to return to (90-foot diameter dome is the largest all-digital planetarium in the world), skip over to the Rainforest (closes earlier around 7:45 PM I believe), finish that and take the elevator down to the Aquarium (pretty amazing diversity housed within the 100,000 gallon tank), return to watch the Planetarium show, and finally take the elevator up to the Living Roof to stargaze through telescopes (a 2.5-acre canopy showcasing environmental sustainability and biodiversity.) You can see Jupiter (weather/fog permitting)! There is also the African Hall if you want to view some hilarious South African penguin diving performances.\n\nSome of the more awesome highlights include Claude the albino alligator, blue neon geckos, Amazonian piranhas, upside-down jellyfish, redtail catfish, giant Pacific octopus, and more! There are several alcohol stations throughout the museum for your beer/cocktail needs. Located on the first floor is a cafeteria that serves below average food at above average prices so I try to avoid it. There are better food choices nearby in the Haight or Sunset neighborhoods.\n\nSome of the more interesting themes I've been to include game night (Jenga, old school Nintendo games), swing dancing, wine tasting, cocktail mixology, and pyrotechnics performances.

I happened to know about NightLife by chance on the last day of my trip to San Francisco, and...wow... This place freaking blew me away. Where else can you feel like you're in one of the coolest clubs while getting your inner geek on?!\n\n  It was around 4:45 when my boyfriend and I got here. I knew it was supposed to be closing soon, but something in me told me to go check anyway. When I asked, they said they would be reopening for NightLife at 6! I had no idea they were even doing that so it was by sheer luck that we got to go. We went to the Conservatory of Flowers in the meantime and when we got back at around 5:45 there was a HUGE line. It moved pretty quickly though as soon as they opened the doors.\n\n  The ticket person told us that the first showing at the Planetarium was going to be about music, so we rushed for ticket the moment we stepped in. Tickets are on a first come, first served basis so get them as soon as possible if you're planning on seeing a show. We got tickets for that first show and the second show about earthquakes. However, the first show was SOOO BORING. A few years ago, I went to a show called SonicVision at the Hayden Planetarium here in New York. It was completely mind-blowing and I was really hoping this show at the CAS would make the same impact. I was totally WRONG. It ended up being an hour-long college-level lecture about stars and blah blah blah.... The director of the planetarium narrated it live, which sounds cool, but it was so so much worse. It didn't help that the seats smelled sweaty (or maybe it was the guy next to me...either way, I had to keep my scarf around my face throughout the show). My boyfriend next to me even fell asleep! I had to poke him when he started snoring......\n\n  That first show was so boring we decided not to go to the second one. That might've been better, but it was a good thing we didn't go because we wouldn't have been able to make it into the BioDome. I think it closed at 8 so if we had gone to the second show, we would have totally missed it. And it was AMAZING! Butterflies fly about everywhere so if you don't like them you might wanna skip this place.\n\n  From the top of the BioDome, you enter an elevator that goes down to the BEST part of the California Academy of Sciences. The Aquarium!!! I was disappointed that we couldn't make the trek to Monterey Bay Aquarium during our stay in Cali, but the aquarium at CAS made up for it. There were a lot of people so if you want to look up close at the more popular attractions such as the jellyfish, expect to wait a bit. It was amazing though, and so much bigger than I expected.\n\n  In the center of the museum, there was a DJ and a lot of room for dancing (though I didn't see much of that until almost 10). In the back, there was some awesome live music. There were multiple alcohol stations throughout the museum and a food court, but I'd suggest eating and drinking before or after if you can. They kinda jack up the prices for food and drink...\n\n  I didn't really expect to spend all 4 hours at this place (NightLife is from 6-10) but there was just SO much to look at and we had so much fun.

No little kiddies running around which is awesome, plus there's a bar on every corner on the bottom floor that is. There was some band playing but it wasn't music I listened to so I skipped out on listening to them. Some exhibits are closed. You can't bring your drinks into the exhibits which is lame because they don't give you that warning when they charge you high prices for those mediocre cocktail drinks. Also some douche bag charged me for water $1 for tap...It's defiantly a lot of fun, be sure to visit when in sf because it is cheaper than paying regular admission. \n\n*only thursday nights\n$12 \n\nregular admission $30 for adults and $25 for students \n\nnightlife is a steal!", "author": "Diane S."}

I felt like I was in a lounge, but instead of looking at gold-fish tanks in a lousy bar, we were able to see huge tanks of sharks and sting-rays.\n\nMy favorite exhibits were the jellyfish tank, starfish petting area, and the penguins.. gotta love those adorable creatures!  They were having a valentines-day special, and at every large exhibit, there was an academy rep speaking through a microphone about how the animals on display behind them make love --haha.\n\nNot sure if I'd go back again, since I basically finished all the exhibits in 1.5 hrs, and there's probably not much else new to discover.. But I definitely had a great time and was pleasantly surprised that I only paid $10 for admission (cheaper than some cover charges for clubs)\n\nTIP: buy your tickets online beforehand, its cheaper and you dont have to wait in line!", "author": "Michelle W."}

Well good news, that kind of partying is SO last decade. \n\nThat being said, I finally made it to the academy of sciences for their nightlife and EVEN with all of the hype it was a blast (and there was plenty of hype...

It's worth going up to the roof, although the odds that its a clear enough night in the city to do any stargazing are fairly slim.\n\nOne of the treats I wasn't expecting was the wandering garden (mostly trees) around the museum that looked lovely lit up at night... that and the many handsome guys.

I guess it's my fault but I was picturing lots of people, a casual environment with some wine, light music, fun beer tasting, etc.\n\nWhat really happened was:\n\n- Massive amounts of people. Be prepared to wait in line to get in. It moves fast but still. And if you want tickets to the planetarium, line up early.\n\n- People dressed in all kinds of attire. Which isn't so bad, but you can tell that half these people were just trying to dress to impress and hook up with someone whereas the other half really just rolled out of work. Or you might find the worst: slutty girls wearing clubbing clothes. You're in a museum, for christ's sake. \n\n- Loud, obnoxious, annoying people. We witnessed pushing, shoving, sarcastic remarks, messy lines waiting to purchase alcohol, stupid drunken comments, a complete lack of etiquette and politeness and just drunken behavior in general.\n\n- Expensive drinks, although this wasn't a surprise to me.\n\n- Girls traipsing around in groups and not taking a second to let someone pass because they just HAD to stick together in their 20 person group. Can you not separate for 2 seconds to go through a doorway in a single file line?\n\nI mean I probably shouldn't generalize and being a young person myself I can understand the appeal in drinking, but good lord have some composure. Again, it's a museum..was your goal to woo someone with a conversation about shark testicles or something?\n\nMaybe I've been so many times during the day already that the museum gets less interesting. But to me, adding drinks and a dark sky doesn't really justify going. You avoid having a million little kids running around during the daytime, yes. But in return you get a million young adults running around drunk.\n\nThe pros were the roof garden. It was so pretty lit up and you could see the city and the de young. Plus they had telescopes to see Jupiter and the Moon. Another pro was that admission was fairly cheap. $12 isn't bad since I heard regular admission is around $25?\n\nAnyway, I will most definitely not go back again.

IT'S NEMO!!\".\n4) You can stargaze through the telescopes on the Living Roof. Don't really want to stare at the sun through the telescope during regular hours.\n5) You get to learn whilst drinking, and you won't be judged for it.\n6) The music and darkness of the night gives the Academy such a cool vibe.

I love that they issue you two membership cards, one with my name printed on it and one with \"Guest of Laura S\" printed on it, which allows me to bring in any adult I wish, not one designated by the card. In fact, I can give the card to my mom, or nanny ( if I had one) and they can bring my bring kids. The membership also allows all \"my kids under the age of 18\". \n\nSo, now for the Academy itself. I have been a few times since its reopening, with my kids' school, but I had not been able to wander around as we have done since getting our own membership. Now with this membership, we have realized just how \"hallway-ish\" the new academy is. Oh, I'm not really complaining, it's great and all, it's just that now I can picture how ants feel in their tunnels a bit. The new design is very compartmentalized. The old design was very open.\n\nWe do enjoy the \"rain forest\" that is smack in the middle. You must brave the crowd and the lines. However, the lines usually go pretty quickly. Stay away from \"free Wednesday\", which, I believe is every third Wednesday of the month, if you hate crowds as much as I do. There are enough crowds on any given summer day.\n\nThe Stienhardt Aquarium is now located downstairs. There are docents who give lectures at the various tanks. I made my three kids sit through one, and they actually enjoyed it! \n\nThe planetarium offers free tickets to shows for members...Win! Ok, so the Saturday show was a live narration and the guy speaking had a very monotone, soothing voice....my friend and I were lulled into the sweetest 20 minute nap! Seats are SO comfy! \n\nYou see some of your old friends, like the albino alligator and large dino bones, African Hall.....  \n\nThe food, although pricey, is very good and so much better than it was before! There are great choices and healthy choices! Oh and Discount with membership!\n\nI know I am leaving things out, like the snakes and lizards exhibit, which is there now.....\n\nThere is so much to do and see...it is worth the membership...at least for this family ...and it's tax deductible!

The vast garden entrance, the long assssss line to get in, the impromptu dance floors everywhere, the often wild and sometimes visually overwhelming exhibits to blow your mind and last but not least the insurmountable number of bars and tenders to serve you your brain cell killer of choice, limited choice mind you, yet choice none the less.

It felt like a huge Yelp party (hint, hint - I say for the Holiday Party), with drinks you can purchase and food in there cafe area. The last time I was here was when I was a kid. A good tip is buy your tickets online, its a mad house.  Plus this event happens every Thursday night and they are on Facebook.\n\nOf course there are pros and cons for coming to any event. Here is my list: \n\nPROS: \n-Great admission fee for just 10 bucks to see the whole museum then the regular admission. \n- Drinks and food on site to purchase \n- Different music heard throughout the event \n- You know its a good event when people are trying to buy tickets outside, since it was sold out. \n- Bring in your own food. I saw someone bring in Jollibee \n- The exhibits are amazing! What I saw was only the Aquarium but that was cool too!\n\n\nCONS: \n- They admitted way to many people, it was so busy in there. Everywhere was lines for things and people. \n- If you want to see the Rain forest get there early since it closes at 8pm. I was SOL for this too since it was a huge line going in. \n- For the Planetarium you needed to get passes to see the show or else you are SOL like I was \n- The food was way over priced, come on a Chicken bun was for like $3.00 bucks but then again if they don't rob you now when are they going too. \n- Drinks was minimum at 7 bucks. Which was expensive and since it was in a hella small cup. \n- I hit my tooth on one of the exhibits in the aquarium. It was a bubble one and since I was looking so hard I didn't see the glass and bam! They so need to hang a charm or something on there, cuz I saw alot of lips marks on the glass afterwards. \n\n\nAfter everything I would totally come back just to see the other exhibits. I do remember it being bigger as a kid, but maybe cuz I was small. Overall a great experience and would love to go back. \n\nBTW- HAPPY BDAY TO CINDI N.", "author": "Donna Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-07", "description": "Nightlife at the Academy of Science is the new discovery of the day!\n\nI came here last night with friends. Not sure what to expect on a Thursday night at a museum turned evening venue.  I dressed urban chic with walkable heels that I was thankful for later.  \n\nWe got there late around 8pm and went straight to the Cafeteria for some pork tacos and quesadillas, prices were average, not too steep. Neither of us opted in on alcoholic beverages as 1) The prices were steep 2) I was the driver 3) Drinking while prancing around a museum just seemed lame. \n\nStill, Nightlife is a very interesting concept. I saw some negatives and positives to this and want to address both. \n\nPROS\n- Huge yuppish, good-looking crowd, if you're into people watching.\n\n- A good place to pick up men/women.  Not that I tried  it (tho' friend offered to be my wing woman) but its full of potential and more wholesome than a bar/club. The best places for pickups might be the cafeteria, entrance, bar areas, and the aquarium.  And at the end of the night, you could find yourself the recipient of a missed connection like this:  http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/mis/1311703094.html\n\n- Lots to do. If you get there early, you have 4 hours to look around various exhibits and go exploring while watching the young sf crowd go by.\n\n- Perfect date activity. For those that don't want to deal with families on the wkds, this time is perfect for couples and first daters.\n\nCONS\n- Hard to get to, esp. if you're coming from East /South Bay after work.  You have to plan the time accordingly and pay for parking ($11) as street parking is hard to come by.\n\n- Crowds and crowds.  If you're not into crowds, you might not have a good time... esp. young rowdy crowds, all under 30.\n\n- Large space. We didn't know our way around so we just went to the Aquarium for an hour.  What else was there? Where was the music and the dancing others talked about? We needed a map or someone that has done the research.\n\n- Hard to mingle. Too large a space means, despite the potential, it may not the best place to meet others unless you got some mad friend -making skills, but just a  friendly hello to a stranger is a bit challenging.\n\n- I got shocked!!!  Yep, be aware of the electric eel exhibit downstairs, I put my fingers against the metal circles to test the shock factor and got a little crazy brave and did it a few times.  I SCREAMED and the whole place heard me.I think I'm still recovering from the pain.  \n\nAll in all, it's fun, beauty, new discoveries and a little sexy all wrapped up in one night.", "author": "Jackie G."}

This museum is a great 4-5 hour trip.\n\nThe first stop was the rainforest dome. As you enter the dome, you feel like you were in a tropical rainforest. It was humid and there were plenty of birds and cute butterflies flying in the dome! I love examining strange and exotic animals up close without fear of it attacking me so this place was just perfect. \n\nSecond stop was my second favorite: the aquarium. Similar to the Monterey aquarium, the aquarium had a variety of marine animals. The seahorses were so neat! One species had leaf-like legs growing out of their bodies!  The turtles were so cool because they looked so ancient and there was one funny albino alligator just chilling with them.\n\nAt the end of the day, go to the planetarium and learn about our solar system. On this day, they showed a short film about the Life Cycle. Very neat theater with stadium seating and 360 degree screen surrounds you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-03", "description": "I had been to the Academy of Sciences plenty of times in the past but this was my first Nightlife. Two key differences: duh, it's night time and you gotta be 21 and older to get in. While you might think the absence of screaming children running all over the place would make the trip much more enjoyable, the sugar crazed children are replaced with over served hoochies in tiny skirts. I mean seriously, you're at a museum, you're looking at nature and science, just put some real clothes on or go to a club. There's no reason to get so trashed that you puke on the T-Rex model.\n\nOutside of the anomaly that some hoochies like to look at nature while they're hammered, I had a pretty awesome experience at Nightlife. If you intend to see any of the science films, the rainforest in a bubble, or the planetarium show, definitely get there on time because they'll sell out/get slammed with a line really quickly. I got there around 6:30 and was able to comfortably stroll through the rainforest bubble, but by 7:30 there was a line around the block. Of the time sensitive attractions, definitely see the planetarium if you have to choose, it's by far the best. Once that's finished, you can head down to the aquarium and stare at the colorful fish, see the African penguins dive around (this is also time sensitive as they will go to sleep when the sun sets), or jump on whatever attraction of the week is going on.\n\nThis week was Game Night so the room with the penguins was set up for about 20 or 30 tables of our most beloved board games. Also there was Wii and old school Nintendo which is awesome! Who doesn't love Mario? I mean, come on. I really enjoyed the addition of games, but it certainly doesn't consume your evening, it's just a means to goof around with your buddies while you're taking breaks in between the sights and shows.\n\nI would strongly suggest going to Nightlife instead of the day time experience because a) you can grab a drink, b) it's far less packed than during a weekend showing which can be insane, and c) as much as I dislike the Marina and its drunk bimbos/bros, they're surprisingly more tolerable than little Johnny drinking five Pepsis and rubbing his nose all over the glass to attract the fish.", "author": "Anthony C."}

The line snakes around the building.  You enter the room and realize how big the \"screen\" is.  Lights are dim, similar to a nightclub or lounge.  The guy speaking has a very soothing voice and tells you bits of info, what you'll see, etc.  Beware of the \"speedy\" elderly who want to go to the very top of the stadium for a seat.  You'll be waiting a while.  The middle section was great!  They use 3 projectors to create the images during the show, which, at times, makes it feel like a spaceship ride.  Cooool!  Your inner child will come out and the adult side of you will appreciate sunrises even more.\n\nThe Rain Forest: get your camera, sweat rag, wear your quick-wicking clothes and head in.  It's hyoooo-mid.  Humid.  You are damp and sweating at the same time. So many butterflies to photograph.  Little birds are everywhere!  You may need to duck and dodge every now and then.  The  Amazon (parrot) does not like photos, maybe the camera flash.  He really hides! I was outside of the exhibit, taking photos without the flash and he was running away.  Even covering his face!  Cute, magnificent and colorful.  This exhibit has frogs, snakes, fish.  Look down as you go up the spiral walkway to see the gigantic catfish-- and people's faces as they gaze up.  These are downright the biggest fish I've ever seen.  An elevator offers some relief from the humidity as you go up floors and to exit.  5+ stars for this place!\n\nThere's a tortoise exhibit toward the north side of the museum.  One baby tortoise likes to stand tall and \"run\" laps along the perimeter of the enclosure.  Often mowing over and burying his little buddy that stands his ground.  We watched this go on for a long time.  There are benches in front of the section.  He reminded us of our turtle, Samson.  Huge personality!  Check out my photos.\n\nThe aquarium was super!  I spent a good chunk of time in there.  My camera was taking hundreds of photos.  Love aquariums!  You must see this place!\n\nPenguins!  They seem to interact with the visitors.  They people-watch just as we watch them.  A must-see.  They have the penguin neoprene suit that was custom-made for one elderly penquin that couldn't regulate body heat.  He wore it while swimming and now has a new suit.  Cute story.  A children's book is available at the gift shop.\n\n(sigh!).  Words cannot do this place justice.  I wasn't impressed by the living roof, but the concept is great.  I expected more than little shrubs and ground cover.  Where I live, it's called weeds.\n\nI suggest getting membership because the exhibits and shows change.  Discounts too.  Well worth the $99 for a couple because one person has the membership and a guest, any guest, can go for free.  Plus, it's all tax-deductible.\n\nYou must go here!  Let me add the chicken buns from the eateries.  $3.00, worth it!  The lemonade sucks!  Be ready for a sour stomach.  The coffee bar was cool.  An unexpected surprise.  OK... Enough reading this and start planning your visit.  Get there early for parking and expect to pay $22+ for the parking garage (worth it after a day of wandering the museum).", "author": "Melody P."}

Try your luck at parking, I, being the luckiest parker evarrrrr, found parking in Golden Gate Park within a two block walking distance of the museum, while my friends found parking along Fulton. \n\n$10 tickets you should DEFINITELY buy online before the event, because sometimes the event gets sold out at the door. Either, get there REALLY early to get tickets for the Planetarium or arrive about an hour after it starts to avoid waiting in line. The line to the Rainforest exhibit right before it closes gets extremely long, so try to make the Rainforest your first stop.\n\nThe Rainforest exhibit is enclosed in a living biodome fully equipped with pretty butterflies, brightly-colored poisonous frogs, and a variety of different amphibians and bugs. OH! And pretty birds! You walk up a spiraling ramp through different continents to see the varying exhibits of bugs and whatnots to end up at the top of the biodome where there are full-length mirrors (yes, in a biodome, because it's absolutely natural) for you to check that you are wearing the proper clothing for this mock-club event. Oh, excuse me, the full-length mirror is to check that no butterflies are stowing away. You will, then, proceed into the elevator where it takes you straight down into the aquarium. \n\nOoOoOoooh, pretty fishes! Look, it's Nemo, Dory and Jacques! Yay! The aquarium is truly amazing, especially with the bar as you exit the elevator. The drinks are steep, $8 Domestic Beers, $9 Import Beers, yeah, not the kinda money a college student, like myself, can afford frontin'. The aquarium includes whole coral reefs brought in from the Philippines and cute little pig-nosed turtles, yes, they are too adorable. I wasted my battery life on these two turtles. \n\nHead back upstairs and be amazed by the pendulum that can prove to you that the Earth is really spinning. Some say the tilt of the Earth causes the pendulum to swing to and fro at an angle, but I believe Cal Academy of Sciences has programmed the pendulum to swing sideways. While the pendulum slowly works its way around, direct your attention towards the dancefloor where the 21-somethings, get down to the groovy beats of the DJ. I don't remember what they were playing that night because I was distracted by the Wii-esque \"Capture the Bug Game\". \n\nAs the end of the night draws closer, do not forget to proceed to the \"Living Roof\" where two \"fuzzy\" domes are perched on top of the museum. One of which reminds my friend of Spongebob's House, and one of which reminds her of a strawberry. Last night, two telescopes were pointed towards Jupiter and its four moons. (There are more moons but with a tiny eyepiece, only four could be seen) Last night was soooo clear and nice, you could see Jupiter with your naked eye. But I digress...\n\nFinally head back downstairs to the entrance and visit the, what I like to call, \"Albino\" exhibit. \"YO! You, up front! Short, Asian girl behind you! 'SCUSE ME, BUT I WANNA SEE THE ALBINO ALLIGATOR!\" *jumps jumps* \"Ooooooh ahhhhhh.... is he alive? Yeah, he just really likes lounging around on that rock.\" Deeper within the waters, an albino catfish resides along with an albino turtle. Although, the albino turtle was absent last night, I wonder what happened to the fella'. Huh.\n\nIt's 9:45PM, I should go move my car out of the park before I get a ticket or get towed. This is the slight drawback for free parking in the park, you have to leave fifteen minutes before the actual event ends to move your car to avoid a hefty fine.\n\nGo here once or twice, but after that you'll be good for a longggggg time.\n\nP.S. Prices go up starting next Thursday ($12 vs. $10)\n\nDid I mention they had live penguins in the, what seemed to be stuffed animals, African exhibit?", "author": "Maggie H."}

It is a review of the Nightlife event held on the premises.\n\nNightlife is an fine idea, intriguing even, one much better played out in your mind that in reality. $15 discount, no screaming children underfoot and cocktails. That sounds lovely, doesn't it?\n\nPerhaps once it was a lovely experience. Before critical mass set in. \n\nOne word: Crowded. One word, repeated: Crowded, crowded, crowded, crowded, crowded. I'd love to tell you about the exhibits but I couldn't see them from the desperate single girls preening in the reflections of the eel tank, teetering on ridiculously high heels never meant for strolling through a museum. The pheromones and hairspray were noxious. It looked like a meat market night club with some fish in the background.\n\n$7 Sierra Nevada bottles and $8 for a plastic cup of wine (from a bottle that mayyyyybe cost that much) your bag? Then sign up for this event. But be prepared to wait in many a line. To get tickets, then one to get in, then long ones at the bar, where you'll get stepped on or elbowed or both.\n\nI would gladly go back and pay full price on a Saturday to stroll through the exhibits. Maybe the rain forest will be open. Tourists? Children? I will take them gladly over the hordes of overly made up twenty-somethings who could give a rat's ass about seeing any science or nature.

It would have been better if the rain forest stayed open a little longer. Tonight's theme had to do with Black jack.  There were bunch of table games and a dance floor that looked fun. We got there around 7:30 so the the tickets for the planetarium that started at 8:30 were gone. They suggested we stand in the standby line at least 20min before the show so we actually stood in line at 8pm because we really wanted to see it. Fortunately we were the last of the 10 people in the stand by line to get in. Unfortunately after it hit 8:30, the employees kept letting people in with tickets. The ticket line had already been closed and they already started to let standby people in.  \nFew tips: \n1#get there at 6pm if you want a ticket to the planetarium. \n2# if you are late to the show, don't be jerk and try to get in. Especially if there's a long standby line because you know people have been waiting for awhile. \n3# alcohol price is a little steep for the variety they had.\n4#if your planning to eat dinner there and watch the planetarium, I would suggest getting there at 6.

But honestly, I'd rather deal with obnoxious kids than obnoxious adults.  We got there at about 6:30pm and the line to get in was craaazzzzyyy.  But it moved fast so we were only in the cold for 15 minutes.  Our friends had already been in there for 15 minutes and had called to tell us that the Planetarium shows were all gone already except for the first one.  We were a little disappointed but figured it would give us more time to do other stuff anyways.\n\nWhen we got in we headed straight to the drinks as the lines weren't too long yet.  $8 for a tiny glass of wine.  Alright, pretty expected.  Then we went to get in line for the rainforest.  Yes, lines for everything. I really didn't expect it to be as crowded as it was.  The rainforest was cool, but again, everything was soooo crowded!  By the time we got to the aquarium at the bottom we had dealt with so many crowds of people to see he little exhibits that it was getting old, fast.  The exhibits were really cool, but the rude drunks were not.  \n\nPeople were dressed up in all ranges... from a night out to 'going dancing' to jeans, sneakers and t's.  The last was probably the most practical, but really, no one looked out of place as there was enough of each category.  The music was good background mood music.  The dj was located by the Galapagos Islands exhibit and had a small crowd of people dancing around it.\n\nWe didn't get any of the passed hors d'ouerves, or see them but we didn't go into the main glass seating room until the end of the evening.  The cafe was out of a lot of the main dishes by 8pm but still had fries and little munchies.  The prices weren't too bad compared to the drinks.\n\nSome tips: \n- Get there EARLY!  Like, really early if you want to get tickets to the Planetarium show.  My guess is that you'd need to be lined up, and at the front of the line, before the event even opens.  Or, have a friend that's a member that can get you in right at opening.\n- Get in line for the rainforest early.  They cut off the line at 7:30.  As that's pretty much half of the main exhibits (the planetarium being the other half), if you miss both, well then you've really only seen the smaller side exhibits.\n- Eat before you come, or get to the cafeteria early.  If you have to eat there you will also have to do that early to get any sort of selection.  So the former is the better of the two options.\n- Wear comfortable shoes.  You will be walking a bit and may have to deal with a bit of stairs as the elevators can be pretty crowded.\n- Try not to be too obnoxious.  We saw the staff dealing with drunks dropping their drinks, knocking over tables... repeatedly, or messing with exhibits.  Not cool.  Yeah, it's fun, it's drinks and music at a museum, but still...

What is cool is that you get to see the Academy at night, it's less crowded than during the day, you do have to be at least 21 to enter, and everyone is just trying to have a good time acting like kids again.\n\nMy friends and I started in the rainforest exhibit, which actually turned out to be fantastic for me, since I was just getting over a cold. It was like being in a giant humidifier. My respiratory system loved it (kind of appropriate that rainforests are called \"the lungs of the Earth\") but my hair didn't. Can you say frizz? The chameleons, butterflies, and tree frogs were my favorites here. We then exited into the aquarium, where there was definitely a party going on, with a bar set up at the entrance. It was interesting to see people wandering from tank to tank, beer bottle in hand. I suppose being tipsy can only add to the cool factor of the already very cool leafy seadragons.\n\nProps to the Academy for being forward thinking enough to cultivate a new set of followers.

Otherwise, anticipate standing in a line that stretches almost around the corner all the way to J.F.K drive. Yep. My jaw dropped when I saw how long that line was. Luckily I'm a member, and avoided what looked like a minimum 1 hour wait. \n\nMust: Planeterium show. Worth it. Best seats are up towards the back otherwise you'll risk getting motion sickness.\nMust: Spend some quality time downstairs in the Steinhart aquarium.\nMust: Take a tour of the indoor rainforest.\nMust: Hit up the bar.\nMust: Go to the rooftop for the telescopes, if not that, for the awesome sun setting horizon you'll get to see.\n\nDon't: Go to the 3-D astronomy show, unless you're into astronomy. (bring you're own 3-D glasses if you do decide to go)\nDon't: Get too frustrated with the crowds, because there are a ton of people there.\n\nSo not only is the entire museum open for you to wander and get lost in, but you're also allowed to drink and be merry while doing it. Whoever thought of the idea is a genius. And the weird thing is, you'll actually learn something. That's right! Drinking while learning! Oh man. Did I mention there is a DJ and people actually dance! \n\nParking is challenging unless you have good parking karma. If you want you can park out on 9th and Irving, walk 4 blocks in towards the museum. And afterwards you can walk back out and experience any of the awesome restaurants on Irving St. \n\n4 stars!

This is your event. I thought it was neat being able to see exhibits at night while inebriated. The observatory was cool, but you need to get there early as tickets for those go by fast and there's only a limited amount of tickets available. It's free too! While I normally like watching a full on presentation projected to a dome, the alcohol made me a bit sleepy so I was dozing in and out. This also happened to fall within the Cinco De Mayo weekend so I was stuck listening to Salsa-type music. I was hoping for a more \"loungey\" or deep house type of music. Oh well. The food here is alright. Others I went with got the more appealing options at the cafe, but at the end, my chicken fried rice tasted the most flavorful.

I liked the idea, but the outcome was not as great as I had expected. I was BUMMED! \nthe good thing: The rain forest was rockin! Butterflies were soaring all around, landing on people, sticking to walls, and just being their normal butter-fly selves ;)~ they weren't crowd shy, so that made it all the more exciting. granted, I was hoping to see more birds, but maybe they had already gone to sleep (he he he). \n\nThe other rooms, however, were not that great. YES, the fish were beautiful, but the Africa exhibit was nothing to write home to mom about. The music was BAD and the improv that we saw that night (done by unscripted) was even worse. they went on for about 20 minutes about dinosaurs and people were beginning to empty out of the room like someone dropped a stink bomb. im not joking, guys, it was really THAT bad!!!! \n\nno one danced (aside from about 4 really awkward couples) and the food was much like what i would get in a high school cafeteria. with all of the money that they spent on this place, i would expect more of an exciting experience.\n\nThe drinks were stiff (which is good if you're paying 7-10 dollars for a little gin and tonic). with my great company and my drink, we made it happen. we did the best to enjoy it... took pictures, hung out, watched the horrible improv and left an hour later to eat some REAL food. \n\nall in all, i would rather pay a 10 or 20 dollar coverage fee for a real club than go again to this night-life shindig, but im glad i got to experience it for myself. \n\noverall, i wouldn't recommend it unless you are DYING to look at some stuffed animals while you drink and listen to lousy music.

I did not feel like the museum was overly crowded, just don't get there late or you will not be able to see everything you want to. There was a dj playing at one end of the museum, but you could hear the music throughout. The crowd was pretty mixed & ranged from lower 20's to people in their 50's. There is something amazing about holding a beer & touching starfish at the same time, I would definitely come back for another Nightlife.\n\nHere are some useful tips:\n\n1. Buy your ticket online at least 4 days before\n2. Get there at 5:45 to wait in line\n3. Go to the planetarium first & get your ticket for the 6:30 show\n4. After the 6:30 planetarium show (30 min), go get in line for the rainforest & get some drinks to drink while in line (the rainforest line closes at 7:30)\n5.

Yeah the drinks may be a bit more than you want to pay but common how often do you get to enjoy the museum with a cocktail in hand.  I suggest buying tickets in advance on line to avoid waiting in lines.  Once inside the only line you really have to wait in is the rain forest.  And for that I might suggest going into it first.  It brings you up to the top, you walk down and finally the elevator dumps you into the basement.

As a fan of water life (and sciences) since a young age, this was a real treat for me. I really enjoyed the coral reef exhibit, and I liked how the animals were introduced through thematic settings - i.e. the rain forest exhibit led to more detailed exhibits of animals and life within the rain forest. This place really is amazing, and gives you a multi-faceted view of mother earth. \n\nNow the bad: \n\n-We made it a point to get here early. In fact, we got there probably just after it opened, and the planetarium tickets were already out! \n\n-The staff was nice, but most of them did not seem to know the place very well. I asked them which exhibits we should view first before it gets really packed. And were were advised to look at the coral reef first, which we did. Well, the coral reef does not have a line .,Other exhibits do! We could have been better informed here. \n\n- Seriously, music and drinks are great and all, but when I'm trying to look at animals and explore a place like this, I prefer not to bump into the same crowd you'd find at Gravity in the Marina on a Saturday night. But I guess it beats crying babies and strollers bumping into your ankles while you're trying to look at the over-sized alligator gars.  \n\n- Extreeemely crowded. . but i think this is the case everyday.\n\nThis may sound like a critical review, but all in all, I give the California Academy of Sciences itself a solid 4 star rating, but since this specifically pertains to nightlife, I'm factoring in the items above and bringing it down a notch.", "author": "Anderson L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-17", "description": "So what're the great things about Thursday nights at the new Cal Academy of Sciences?\n\nIt's $10 to get in, and not the usual $25.  You get to avoid the weekend/tourist crowds and the screaming kids and/or overly territorial parents.  It's a great place to hang out, chill, learn a few basic facts, and people watch.\n\nThe prices in the cafe are definitely \"museum prices,\" but they're not as bad as you might expect.  My small dinner consisted of some tasty-as-hell vegetarian buns filled with very fresh, crunchy/juicy buna-shimeji mushrooms, a chocolate cookie intensely flavored with lots of real cocoa powder, and a bottle of juice.  $10.50.  Not super-filling, but not a rip-off either, and it was good quality.  My only gripe with the cafe is that with all the \"go green\" messages the Academy promotes, you'd think their cafe wouldn't be handing out thousands of disposable plates/cups.  Really, I don't need a second paper plate just to keep my cookie from touching my dinner.\n\nThe subtraction of one star is due to the fact that the crowds can be unappealingly large, even on a weeknight.  The nature of the Academy is such that people tend to be nicer and more open in the relaxing/intellectual setting, but the crowds are still large enough that there are plenty of jaded urbanites around to give you unwanted doses of stank-eye.  (As other reviewers have pointed out, buy your tickets EARLY and online.)  Still, I have to admit that in a sense I'm glad to see the crowds because it's not shopping malls but important cultural/educational spaces like these that deserve the revenue and popularity.\n\nThe only real negative about the Academy is that the you wish there was more to it: More animals, more exhibits, more substance.  If you're a biology nerd/hippie like myself you won't be learning anything mind-blowing here, and it's easy to walk through the whole building and then go: \"Okay, now what?\"\n\nStill, in the end, it's great fun.  Good food to eat; stunning animals; a gorgeous space filled with some beautiful people; a place to share your love of the planet with others; and oh yes, a cool DJ spinning some respectable beats for all the bespectacled nerds, eco-moms, gay guys, straight guys in gay clothing, cougars on the prowl, Asians, hippies, hot messes waving their Prada clutches, guys holding their beer bottles like security blankets, and recessionistas to get down to.

The Academy is beautiful inside during the night and you see it in a completely different light when compared to seeing it during the day\n\n2. The Living Garden is the winner with the telescopes set up on the roof top. Got to see Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Venus... the last being my date... yuk! yuk! He's going to laugh when he reads this. The view on a clear night (it's the Inner Sunset folks, FOG is a way of life for us peeps who reside here) is spectacular\n\n3. The Rain Forest always takes my breath away (its the humidity every time.. kidding!) with the multi-tiered levels, the pond below and all the greenery\n\n4. I finally got to see the Penguins! What is it about them that makes even the most masculine and hardcore guys go \"awww... so schweet!\"\n\n5. Overall energy was very good. The crowd was a great mix of eclectic, creative, nicely dressed, yuppy albeit a bit drunk and tipsy folks. But it was good fun to people watch. Noticed many couples, singles but mostly groups of friends which was great!\n\n6. The bartenders were personable and friendly which was good to see since it was towards the end of the night and I'm sure they were tired. Kudos to the bartenders and the guides all through the Academy\n\n7. Good music from the 80s and 90s that I was so pepped up to hear, but which also made me suddenly realize (both thankfully and fearfully)... I was Gen X... and now there's Gen Y, Z and beyond... whew!\n\nThe NOT SO GOOD BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY:\n1. Cocktails starting at $7 and going all the way to $15 without a tip made me think I was in the Castro on New Year's Eve wondering if there was a lap dance from a go-go boy to follow. But I've been part of events where the bar and bartenders are expensive, so its understandable\n\n2. The signs (and boy! there were many) that said \"No Food and Beverages Beyond This Point\" makes perfect sense and good thinking on part of the Academy, but it did mean you either waited for 15 mins as you sipped your drink or took it down in one gulp to get to see the exhibhit (hence my comment on the \"albeit drunk and tipsy)\n\n3. Definitely a very crowded affair (and I thought my visit on New Year's Day was crowded). So if you get overwhelmed by large crowds, be wary its does get crowded... its a party, folks!\n\n4. Overall execution was a bit poor\n\nThe TIPS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE:\n1. Yes, do buy your tickets online. You'll be thankful you did.\n\n2. Last entry in is at 9PM and they start closing up at 930PM\n\n3. Last entry into the Rain Forest is 8PM\n\n4. They have a free coat check so please check in your bulky coat and that huge briefcase, or tote bag or messenger bag because it does get crowded\n\n5. Bring cash ($40 or so) for you will need that for buying drinks (not sure about food)\n\n6. Take a break and just sit down and relax and look at the fishes and you then really get the idea of a bigger picture and the world out there\n\n7. Come early if you want to get into the Moss Room or the Planetarium\n\n8. Good place to bring your date, friends or want to get away from the kids for the night and just chill\n\nAll in all, I gave this a 4-star because this is still relatively new and I'm sure they're working out the kinks with each event that passes. At the end of the day, a lot of the restrictions and time closures are there for the benefit of the occupants and that makes perfect sense and I applaud the Academy for observing it so strictly.", "author": "Amit S."}

So it was great to see the new digs and enjoy it in an all adult atmosphere.  You can't beat that it's only $10 - and it's something fun and different to do on a weeknight.\n\nSome tips:\n\n* come early (6PM) to score tickets to the Planetarium. Basically once you get in, head to the Planetarium - they hand out show passes for  630, 730 and 830 until they run out - which is pretty quick, I'm guessing they run out by 630ish! You can pick up extra tickets for your friends without any worries.\n\n* if you drink, have a couple of drinks before the Planetarium show, it's pretty fun to watch with a good buzz - BUT be sure to use the restroom before you get in there - it's only about a 30 minute show...but that can seem like forever if half way through, you realize you need to use the restroom! agh!  Leaving and coming back isn't really an option. The best seats are probably towards the top.\n\n* Food - they do have some food for sale, although of course it's pricey and not really worth the money - but good to have as an option if you really need something to help absorb the alcohol. If possible, don't go hungry!  If you manage to get there early, you can enjoy the CAS for a few hours then head over to 9th Ave for some grub at Park Gyros, Marnee Thai, Ebisu, lots of restaurants to choose from!\n\n* Cash - bring cash...as they only take cash for food and drinks. You can pay by credit card for your entry ticket.\n\n* lines - be prepared. There may be lines to get in, get your drinks, check your coat, etc. but they're really not THAT bad.

The best part was watching a group of scientists as they skinned various animals in the project lab. No, the animals were dead. It was really macabre! They had bars set up everywhere and I had this fantastic cocktail with ginger syrup, lime, vodka, and thyme. It was so delicious and it has always been a dream of mine to be able to have a party inside of an aquarium. Last night was close to that as there is nothing like watching giant alligator gar swimming in front of you while a DJ spins music. I plan to go back as it is a weekly event, and to get there early enough to walk through the rainforest and to see the planetarium show with a nice buzz on. :-)  People were really friendly and all seemed to be having a good time.

It kinda felt like a club, a big yelp party, or even yet a super big holiday party even. There was  bars all over the musuem and even a dj spinning all night. Everyone was so cool and friendly...I guess that's what the drinking does to you. It was great seeing the amazement on everyones faces.\n\nThis event was sold old by the time I got there which was about 7pm, so buy tickets ahead of time. Once you are in try to get tickets to the shows early or else they'll sell out. I was a bit bummed since we didn't get to see planetarium where you site back and look up at the night sky. The rainforest dome closed early at 8pm, so make it one of your first pit stops coz some people missed out on this because they decided to drink before wandering around the musuem.\n\nDefinitely take advantage of this event during the summer is you live in or close to Frisco. \n\nTHUSDAYS NIGHTS IN THE SUMMER!!!!\n\nMy bf and I definitely wanna go back since we didn't get to see everything.

Strolling around with (expensive!) drink in hand, great music playing, and so many beautiful people was the best way to see it all -- way better than with your sixth grade teacher sh'shing you and keeping you in line... Inspiring performances and cool visual projections\n\nBesides the cool museum exhibits, my favorite part was the LoveTech interactive jam room. Quite a contrast to the dead stuffed animals in the same hall :)  \n\nBeing my first visit it was a lot to take in in one evening, so i'll probably go back to make sure i get into the planetarium show (which was already full by the time we got there at 6:25 - make sure you get there right at six to reserve a spot!)

Not only do you get all museum access, you get in for half the cost (I think a little more). For only $10, you can get the same experience any other visitor would have on a regular day.\n\nMy friend told me that Academy of Sciences turns into a 21+ venue on Thursdays. When I think of 21+ venues, I think of clubs and clubs make me think of dancing...which then leads to pre-drinking and la di da...\"I get to walk around a museum drunk! This is awesome!!\". \n\nAs we found a parking spot, let's just say we got a head start before everyone in line ;D. After taking our last swigs, we made our way to the venue...laughing, belligerent, and well, drunk. To my surprise, the line was extremely long and the tickets were already sold out. Not only was the line long, but the people standing in line were seriously not my crowd of people...or maybe sober, one of the two at least. \n\nI get my hand stamped and walk in...\n\nOh my goodness, the venue was so nice and the music was great.

Through the recommendation of a few friends who've been to past events here, I made it one of my goals to complete before summer ends. I got the green light for it when my manager said she and a few of my co-workers wanted to check it out. I spread the word to a few of my friends and we were set. The DJs rotate every week. This week in particular had one that played 80s music (yessss). The drink specials also rotate, I believe. Last night's was the Tropic Thunder (apple vodka, blue curacao, and lemonade, deelish!). \n\n Early arrival is highly suggested because:\n1. Parking is a b*tch. If you can't find any on the street, you can fork over $11 to park in the underground garage.\n2. If you didn't buy your tickets online, you gotta get in line for the ticket window, then proceed to #3 which is...\n3. The line for ticket holders. This line can be crazy long!  However, it does move quickly. Just have your ticket(s) and ID out already to speed up the process.\n\n Speaking of long lines, the line for the ATM can be pretty ridonkulous as well. FYI the bar and food areas accept cash only. Don't say I didn't warn you, because I did! The aquarium and the Philippine reef exhibits were amazing. I have to remember next time to check out the Rainforest exhibit because it closes early. The best part of the night for me was going up to the Living Roof just as the sun was setting. I got in a few pictures before it went dark. Dress code is pretty much up to you. From what I saw, it ranged from casual to \"Hey is this the line for XS\"? Whatever works I guess. I asked my homegirl if I should request something to the DJ. She told me to go for it, and whaddaya know, they took it. Who knew Bizarre Love Triangle could bring a bunch of people together?

I've gone four times: once on a Saturday, once on the third Wednesday of the month (when it's free), and twice for their Thursday evening \"Nightife,\" which is restricted to people 21 and over.\n\nI love the rainforest, which I call the \"Hall of Butterflies.\" I love the Planetarium. I love the living roof. The aquarium is amazing, though a bit overwhelming -- there's so much there! The African Exhibit is fairly dated (I remember it as a kid and it hasn't changed), though I really like the living penguins. I like the albino alligator but miss that the old Academy had half a dozen or more when I was a kid.\n\nBe sure to go early and sign up for a timeslot at the Planetarium as soon as you get there, because it sells out quickly. That's happened to me both times I went during the day, and one time to a friend who went for Nightlife.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that I prefer Nightlife on Thursdays over the daytime experience. I like that there aren't screaming children (though there are plenty of shrieking adults). I like the deejay music. However, the bars are pretty expensive, small, and weak. The first time I didn't drink at all. The second time I stuck to wine because it's hard to dilute that. It's only $10, and that includes the Planetarium (if you sign up in time). So even if you don't have time to see everything you want, and you have to go again, the $20 for two visits with the Planetarium is still cheaper than $25 for one (plus another $10 for the Planetarium during the day). \n\nAt Nightlife, they have three Planetarium shows. My impression, having caught the first and last on different nights, is that the first is a movie (narrated by Sigourney Weaver) and the second two are lecture presentations. Both were good, but given the two I would recommend the movie as a truly amazing experience. \n\nBut also note that the rainforest lets the last person in at 8:30, so don't dawdle. And the living roof truly needs to be best experienced while there's still daylight. So it may be hard to cram everything at Nightlife ... but it's still cheaper to do Nightlife twice than once during the day.", "author": "Kevin G."}

Piece of advice: don't bring food, drinks or candy into the planetarium (the guy with the mic will call you out *DOH*) and yes, they do collect those tickets, so don't try to sneak in.\n\nThe alcohol and food is ridiculously priced...so my advice?  Drink ahead of time *haha* and make your way over to C-A-S lit. *JUST KIDDING* (well, about being lit).  The rainforest was closed and the albino alligator was MIA, so I really feel that I'll need to return soon.\n\nTix were 10 dollars and I feel that for the most part, it was a cool socializing/science thing to do.  I plan on going next week :).", "author": "Hiromi N."}

It makes for a prime date spot or just a fun place to mingle and have a lil' fun w/ a friend! There are so many scenarios where you can easily strike up a convo. Be aware that the crowd is in their 20's or 30's. I was wondering if the few, gray-haired folk I saw were thinking, \"What did I get myself into??\".\n\nI was worried that it was going to be packed to the gills, but it really wasn't bad at all. The Academy did a great job making an idea like this work w/ their current set-up. Ex) There are bars everywhere you turn, so you're never left high and dry. You don't have to wait long to order up a drink and the large, glassed in space by the entrance, was perfect for their long line up of bars and quick eats that looked pretty tasty. Don't feel like your only option is this food area... head past the Rainforest, and you'll find yourself by an awesome cafeteria area where you can get steamed pork buns or even pho! Too bad we already ate! \n\nThere were docents in every area making it easy to pick their brains, if necessary.\n\nTIPS:\n\n-Make sure you buy your $10 ticket online a least a week in advance. Tickets sell out quick!\n-Bring cash for the bars. They have an ATM inside, but who wants to waste time pulling out cash?\n-They apparently have a Planetarium showing for free and a really cool Rainforest that closes at 8, so you've gotta be on top of it if you wanna check out both. I got the best secret from a docent as to what the best plan of attack is to ensure you can check both off your list... His advice? Arrive at 5:45, and once they let you in, have 1 person wait in line for a Planetarium ticket and the other for the Rainforest. Once you get those Planetarium tix, meet up your friend in line, and enjoy the Rainforest! \n\nI LOVE the design of the Academy. The Rainforest set-up is so neat and the exhibits are presented in a interesting & creative manner. The roof-top is a unique idea too!\n\nThis nightlife option is perfect for avoiding all the kids and the price is much more ideal than the $25 daily admission price.\n\nAll in all, we had one awesome evening!", "author": "Tiffany M."}

It cost $12 dollars to get in, free parking (but you'll need to get there kind of early (like 6pm) to find a spot near the academy) worst case scenario you can park on Fell, drinks were a bit pricey for $7 a beer, they sell shots too (the jack daniels shot definitely made things more interesting), the cafeteria is actually not bad (pork tacos were really good and cost $9 for two small tacos, but well worth it).  The exhibits were really cool.  The music was definitely unique, it was a combo of electronic with a live sax and bongos in the background.   The dance floor was kind of small and wasn't if sure how you could dance to the toons.  I mean you had some peeps dancing tango the others raving, then of course the wall flowers cheering on the rest :)  It seemed like a third of the people were on dates, another third were in groups, the last third were singles.  As far as style, a third were dressed up (if you thought, um ya, those must have been people on dates, you guessed right, were talking sport jackets, suits, and dresses; a bit much in my opinion, its not the opera folks, lol), another third were dressed in their work attire (dress shirt/jeans), the remaining third were very casual (tshirt and jeans).\n\nOverall, this place is really cool.

Ahh...it was nice, humid and toasty. Who knew my friend loved freaky frogs? I personally love blue tarantulas, but it was hiding. The macaws were gone and the miniature tree frogs weren't around either. The aquarium was all open for everyone to play, view, and take photos. But Michelle really wanted to see the penguins who were sleeping in their quarters (no penguin sex this time). \n\nAgain, if you're here for food, there wasn't a lot of choices to get: sandwiches, tacos, baked goods, soups and several hot entrees, but not everything was open in the cafeteria.

Which means (most of) the crowd here is young but sophisticated. I absolutely loved my experience here. They offer cocktails for purchase at several booths throughout the museum, and just thinking about them makes me crave one now. They have several specialty themed cocktails, and I would highly recommend the \"Something-Something-Surfer\", which basically tastes like a strong pina colada, minus the gritty ice...mmmm... This particular night, they held a \"silent\" disco dance party, and had I known about the theme ahead of time, I definitely would have participated, but alas, I was woefully unprepared. Many if not all of the exhibits are still open for viewing, and the fish all exhibit their night-time behaviors. Don't miss out on the aquarium or the rainforest dome, which closes early to allow the birds and other critters inside to sleep. I had a blast!!\n\nDownsides: get here early if you want to get into the Planetarium at all. This is the second time that I've been here since the remodeling, and I still haven't been able to see it. And parking is near impossible. Of course, there is the trashy crowd as well, the kind in revealing clubwear, drinking obscenely, yelling at people and banging on tanks, but luckily (for both other guests and the fish) they're few and far between.", "author": "Jennifer Y."}

Nightlife was such an adventure for me and my GF and we had a blast! We went early, so we were first in line. The couple behind us in line had smuggled in a 6 pack of sierra nevada and passed me a bottle, thank you kind sir. So if your going early enough to wait in line, bring something to do, and by something \"to do\" i mean \"booze to drink\". Excellent way to pass the time while you get prepared for a night of bugs, lizards, and romance. \n\nEveryone in line was talking about making a straight shot to the planetarium for the show, my GF and I opted out. We didnt want to spend the evening sitting in a movie theater but we made a note to def check it out the next time. We made our way to the butterfly atrium which was awesome. You have to go thru this \"depressurization\" chamber thing before hand, and upon entering you feel like you've just been dropped into the amazon (minus heidi and spencer..) There's nothing like nursing a heineken and gawking at gecko's.. \n\nThe aquatic area is also very cool, it's not on the level of the Monterrey bay aquarium but for not being an aquarium, the california academy of sciences sure as hell makes you think you just walked into one. I'm not sure if it was the heightened blood alcohol level or if those fish were actually really that cool, either way; we stared at them, they stared at us. everyone was happy! \n\nThe living roof is awesome as well. Reminded me of some organic hippie star trek teleporter. It's sci fi meets wheat grass! I wasnt able to take a peek into the telescope. There was a huge line and i'm kind of put off on smashing my eye ball against something that everyone elses eye ball has been smashed again. Maybe if they had some purel on the scope i would have been more into it? \n\nThe downside? The food was janky looking. It looks like wraps and salad kinda stuff, not exactly what i want to eat when i'm drinking but it was a valiant attempt at serving food in a museum setting and still keepin it classy'. I stuck with beer most of the evening, too many mixed drinks and i'd be trying to climb to the trex bones! \n\nOver all; my GF and I had a fantastic time here. Parking was simple, prices were reasonable, we got some great pictures, and we both had a blast.

Whoever thought of this better have gotten a nice raise and promotion.  Yes, it can be a bit of a scene, but I tend to block out the annoyances and just enjoy my (jeans-clad) self.   There seem to be a good mix of ages everytime I attend, from the newly 21 to gray-hairs.\n\nI was at the first Nightlife wayyyyy back in February and predicted it would be a hit.  It has grown in size but is still a fantastic bargain. $12 for non-members; $10 for members for full access to the museum, stroller free AND a DJ and fun lectures and events?  Strolling the Aquarium with adult beverage in hand?  I'm sold!  That first night, it was amazing how sparse the crowds were compared to now--my friend and I strode right into the Rainforest, no line at all.\n\nThere are some annoyances--if you arrive even 1/2 hour after it opens at 6PM, you probably aren't going to stand a chance of getting a Planetarium or special lecture of the night seat.  I do wish CAS would put aside a certain number of tickets for the later comers, after all, this is Nightlife, not early evening life, right?  Or they should reduce the ticket price after 7:30, since those people won't be seeing the Planetarium or the Rainforest, due to early closing and ticketing.\n\nAnd definitely get in line for the Rainforest the moment you arrive.  The best way to see CAS is to start at the Rainforest and take the elevator down from there to the Aquarium, but if you aren't in line for the Rainforest by 7 or so, you probably won't be admitted as it closes at 8PM.  Basically, if you arrive at 7 or later, your choices for activities are the aquarium and the other exhibits, with none of the \"special\" stuff, which is annoying if that were to be your first and only time at CAS.  It's called \"Nightlife\" but is geared completely towards early arrivals.\n\nSo that's the bad...the good is the aforementioned lack of strollers, the ability to see most of the aquarium without being trampled, a DJ playing as you peruse the place and the telescopes on the roof--I saw Saturn one night, very cool!", "author": "Gretchen J."}

I have been to the academy before during the day, but it's a pretty cool experience seeing it at night. The atmosphere is awesome!! Despite all of the people, my friend and I still felt like we were at some snazzy private event or something. The lights are dimmed, it's all adults, there's cool music playing that is not overbearing, there's alcohol and food available, and you have full access to the museum for 4 hours...all for only 10 bucks!!!\n\nNow, I do have to say that it is crowded. But The Academy is always crowded as far as I can tell. I really, really hate crowds in confined areas, but there were two things that really helped make it very tolerable: alcohol and atmosphere. Yes the alcohol is pricey at $7 for a beer. But I mean seriously the $10 to get in is cheaper than cover at many clubs and this is a far nicer venue that includes an unforgettable learning experience. The majority of the people there are drinking and whereas it's not really okay to go to a museum intoxicated during the day, it's totally cool at this event. So if you're concerned about the alcohol price, have a couple before you get there (However, this is a classy event, so don't plan on getting trashed.). \n\nYou will have to wait in line outside to get tickets the day of (Get there early!!! They start selling at 5:30 pm and the doors open at 6. My friend got there at 4:45 pm).

If you have your online ticket, the wait line to get in took seriously maybe two minutes and we walked right up to one of the bars every time (Tip: there's bars throughout the museum, so don't just go to the ones with the crowds in the very center.).

So you can imagine my excitement when work decided to organize a private event for all of us and our family and friends.\n\nThat excitement was short-lived though. I made the mistake of not getting there super early. We arrived around 7:30pm and all the passes for the planetarium were gone. Even the passes for the bug show was gone too. They even stopped letting people into the rain forest.\n\nThere were so many people and kids everywhere that it literally felt like you were swimming through people, especially when walking through the aquarium. I kept getting hit left and right by ladies' handbags when trying to wade through the crowds. The kids were so loud that it made it hard to hear any of the music the DJ was playing until around 9:30pm or so when people started leaving.\n\nWhile walking around I noticed that they had closed the gift shop. Imagine how much business they could have gotten if they had stayed open. Obviously someone didn't think that one through.\n\nThis is definitely not the same CA Academy of Sciences from back in the day when we came here for school field trips. The living roof was pretty cool, though you can't see all the plants at night. It's a good thing a couple in our group are members and were able to show us around all the exhibits.\n\nIf I do come back here again, I think I will come early in the morning hopefully before any crowds arrive.", "author": "Lyn L."}

So for me, and those of you like me, Nightlife at the Academy is as good as it gets.  It's f'n brilliant.\n\nA few things to consider before you go...\n\n1. Get there early.  The lines both inside and out are long and eat up A LOT of time.  And the event only runs from 6 - 10pm.  If you don't have a membership, you can expect to be at the entrance for at least 30-40 mins.\n\n2.  Prefade.  Like I said, even the drink lines are long.  And if you wanna see all the exhibits, you really don't have time for more than 2 or 3 trips to the bar.  Plus, the bartenders are a little light-handed on their pours.\n\n3.  Make time for the PLANETARIUM.  It'll open your eyes...\n\nMy Advice:\nIt pays to be a member.

When we got to the Academy at 6:30, the line to get in (with pre-printed tickets) was out the door, maybe 300 people.  I was going to take a picture but didn't have a wide-angle lens on me...  At least the line moved fast -- they just checked ID's and scanned the ticket.  We were inside in less than 10 min.\n\nWe went straight for the planetarium passes -- no luck, all gone.  Since we had seen the rainforest on a regular daytime trip, we went up to the living roof.  It was still bright out, which made it feel un-Nightlife-ish.  Sunset would have been a better time to go up top.  Well, we went down to the cafe and got a pork taco plate ($8.50, very heavy on the meat with no veggies) and a veggie bun ($3.00 and tastier than any veggie bun I've had in Chinatown).  We ate outside on the patio, where there was a ton of empty seating.\n\nLater, we watched a modern art dance performance which reminded me of the old joke: \"What do you get when you cross a modern dance artist with a mafia?  Someone who makes you an offer you just can't understand.\"\n\nThen we went downstairs and spent a lot of time in the aquarium area.  You can't see how big it is from the upper levels, but there are a lot of cool creatures to check out.\n\nAnd speaking of checking out -- ah, the people.  Quite a diverse crowd from 20-something hipsters to 60-something seniors.  Mostly 20's and 30's though.  The dress style was all over the place too.  We saw one woman in an evening gown and flip-flops.\n\nOverall, it was a fun place with a cool vibe and a lot of energy.

It was wonderful! A breath of fresh air! I love trying new things and since I've been trying to get out to this place for years I figured I had to go. The ambiance is marvelous; with the music and it not being too crowded you get to see and really experience the exhibits. Also most of the sea life is more active at night it was wonderful seeing the displays all the fish moving about like the stingrays and sharks- it was so much fun! \n\nHowever I was a little worried because I am an east bay lady and work in Oakland... so making the trek to SF after work and then trekking back out to my house seemed a little daunting. BUT it really wasn't that bad. \n\nAnyways what you really want to know the TIPS of going to this event: \n\nPARKING: Park in the garage on Fulton & 10th - only $11 flat rate. \nTICKETS: Purchase your tickets on-line through Academy's website and print your ticket. I got there about 7:15 and was able to skip the longer line of purchasing your tickets at the window. This window is the same window you pickup your will call tickets - so again print them yourself. \nARRIVE EARLY: They have an remarkable planetarium showing I believe there are 2 or 3 shows a night and they are always different (says my friends who I met there they have been a lot) Anyways I found out that the head honcho of the planetarium is the one who writes and narrates the show which is special because he doesn't do it for the daytime show. Plus they start to give out free place holding tickets for the different planetarium showings soon as they open so get there early so you don't miss out! \nDRESS: There were all types but don't wear club wear - it will be way over the top. Dressing up jeans, or casual dress are fine; same as wearing your skate shoes and t-shirt. But most were a little dressed up like you were going out. So, in short dressy casual.\nCROWD: Eclectic. There were the newbies, the punks, the mods, the preps, the techno-heads, all of the stereotypes were there. Also, all age groups were represented form 21 to 50+; but I'd say that most were 25 - 35. \nMUSIC: Great!\n\nFinally they have different themes going on so look on their website and see what the theme is! \n\nTHIS IS A MUST DO EVENT!

Especially when my friend and a guy that was there had a mini-freak out with the python squeeze exhibit and I watched them spend 10 minutes making a pact they would put their hand in if the other person did!\n\nThe roof was cool but not as impressive at night- but I liked that they had the telescopes out and the lines moved really fast. Major kudos to the staff member who answered all of my friend's smart a** questions about why we didn't land an expedition on the sun with good humor and still trying to impart some knowledge while probably wishing he could push my friend OFF the living roof.\n\nWhat surprised me was that my favorite part was actually the Quest KQED film/lecture - when it started, we were thinking- well, it's getting later in the evening and this will be a good place to take a break and sit for a while. The night I was there the film was on discovering a new species of nebbia beetle - I KNOW, riveting right? (yeah- I didn't think so either- and my initial thought was- great- I found the geekiest thing I could do at the Science Museum during happy hour night) - but the film started and it was actually REALLY COOL!!! So I geeked out by the end when they said the guys who discovered the new species were right outside and had to talk with them.\n\nSumming up- $10 is great to see the place without school groups and families with strollers,  cool place to explore, listen to music, grab a drink, look at cool science stuff-- who knows, you might learn something!", "author": "Keri B."}

The Academy of Science is a major reason why.  It is a beautiful establishment: grand modern architecture, amazing exhibits, and a learning experience.\n\nNightLife is an event on Thursday nights, between 6 and 10PM.  Tickets are $10.  You get to see the majority of the daytime exhibits, dance, and mingle while sipping on your choice of alcohol.  The majority is young people in their 20's and 30's and most are dressed to impressed.  I think it's a great place to meet people.\n\nIf you're hoping for a serious museum experience to explore your mind, don't come to the Thursday party.  That night, it's really a party first and museum second, so relax and enjoy.  Bring some animal facts to share.\n\nPS The regular admission to the museum is $25.  Thursday night's $10 is by far a better deal.", "author": "James B."}

I had been to the academy before and had a fantastic time, but the crowds and lighting made it really hard for me (as a scientist) to take a look at all the exhibits.  There were a fair number of drunk girls running around the place, and drinks were pretty overpriced.  I will say that the $12 price of admission is nice because it is half-off the normal admission price.

I knew there was no way for me to spend as much time as I wanted at each animal display and exhibit, so I was not disappointed at all (as some people might have been, who came with the expectation of seeing it all). \n\nThere are lines everywhere! But if you hit the lines at the right time, they all do move fairly quickly. I got into the Rainforest exhibit in about 10 minutes. \n\nWith this being a popular event, crowds form at every single animal display. I didn't get to read about each animal, and just took a quick look at each thing... which I thought was perfect since I was in the \"preview\" mindset. Also, with this strategy, you get to see way more! \n\nThe Planetarium show is to die for! It was amazing... you must check it out! You almost feel like you're flying.... so be sure to grab tixs for the show the minute you get into the door. \n\nThe jellyfishes are so pretty! Go see those too!", "author": "Maggie L."}

First of all, you really can't beat the price. Only $10 to get in (as opposed to the $25 to get in on any regular day of the week), minus screaming kids running around all over the place, plus alcohol! What more could you ask for? This is a great alternative to hitting up a bar for normal happy hour after work. Plus, it's educational! Drinks do tend to be on the pricier side than they are at traditional happy hours-- about $7 for beer, $8 for wine, $10 mixed drinks and it's cash only!\n\nThe line does get extremely long right around 6pm (when the doors open) but it moves fast so don't worry. I would suggest checking out either the Planetarium or the Rainforest right when you get in as the wait to see either of these exhibits grows the later into the evening it gets. Both are really awesome! (But you may want to hold off on the drinking before you go to the Planetarium show.) \n\nOverall mixed crowd of folks-- I've seen both young and older groups, people who look like they just got off work in the financial district and others who look like they just finished playing drums and dancing around in golden gate park. And of course, there are those who come dressed like they're about to hit up a club. The mix is diverse and there's something for everyone!", "author": "Angelina B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-14", "description": "The academy is a modern building with state of art exhibits focusing on nature and environmental issues.  It contains a 300-seat planetarium, several impressive aquariums, a 'living roof', and some coffee shops.  I suggest eating before you go there and maybe having a snack there as opposed to having lunch there as I did.  Food is ok but it is noisy with all the kids.\n\nThe entire program focuses on very young children and approaches science like a cartoon.  For example, in the presentation of 'how it all began' in the planetarium, we were told that at some point, the dinosaurs just kind of faded away due to changes in the food supply.  Even a high school kid would/should know that for at least the last 25 years the accepted theory has been the earth was struck by a meteor that destroyed their environment.  The presentation did not even mention it, as if they were getting their knowledge from 50-year-old textbooks.\n\nI also felt they wasted a lot of building space with over blown billboard size exhibits such as graphs to show CO2 increases over the years.  Because they made the few facts they did try present so large, no room was left for trivial information; like arguments against global warming.  There were entire walls with just a few words on it. \n\nChildren will have a good time here and if you live in the Bay Area you might want to check it out with your kids.   Not much of interest to teens or adults in presentation of hard science.", "author": "Fred T."}

I loved that there were a different specialty drink in each area. Tips:  If you want to see the planetarium show you need to get there early, they usually sell out in the first 30minutes and you can only get the tickets at the box office.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-25", "description": "After all this time, I finally went out of my way to check out Night Life at the Academy. I parked on MLK at 5:00 and the street was already pretty full but still had 2-3 prime open spaces. A bunch of coworkers and I grabbed dinner a few blocks south of the park. When we returned at 5:50, there was already a line snaking down the steps and down the street! Crap.\n\nThings you must do: buy/print tickets before coming. Unless you like waiting in lines and looking like a fool (with your pants on the ground). \n\n\"Fragile Earth\" Not So Stellar\nUpon entering, we hung an immediate left and darted around the planetarium to get in line for tickets. The ticket givers were generous; they asked us how many tickets we needed. we blurted \"...10!\" and they gave us 10. We got 10 tickets to the following show too, but ended up giving them away later. A lot of the other Yelpers have raved about the planetarium and how the shows are always sold out. Despite that, Fragile Earth was just decent. It briskly detailed our place in the solar system and galaxy, what we use to monitor planet, and how we are looking for other suitable planets. It exuded too much of a preachy vibe, inferring that we should take better care of our planet. A good documentary should make you want to do that without preaching (see BBC Planet Earth or BBC Life). The show is par, but pales greatly in comparison to Hubble 3D (not counting the 3D). Though, if you haven't been to a planetarium in the past 5 years, I'd still recommend visiting this one. \n\nSurreal Scene\nThe coolest and most obvious thing about Nightlife is the scene. You can eat, drink, and be merry with your chums amidst an awesome backdrop of colorful exhibits and living displays. It's the other end of the typical dark, dank, and loud bars and clubs. Attendees are quite well-dressed, and that brings a bit of class to the event. Playing along helps fuel that aura; rather than going to a club dressing skanky, you are going to a museum dressing swanky (har har).\n\nDebbie Downers\nAn unfortunate byproduct of such a museum is that there is little opportunity for mingling (sorry singles). With an event like this, people generally don't go alone expecting to meet others on the fly. Though, that doesn't mean you can't outsmooth the odds and meet the person(s) of your dreams there. Even my group was infiltrated by a completely random guy asking random questions. \"Would you think I went to MIT if I was wearing an MIT sweatshirt?\" Yes, because we fickly judge people by the text on their sweats. Another potential downer: we discovered that Nightlife had ended their $3 6:00-7:00 happy hour about a month ago! Shiieeet, son. We were relegated to the normal $7 beers and $8 mixed drinks. Regardless, nothing really beats inebriation in an aquarium with your buddies. Prepartying recommended.\n\nAfterparty?\nOne of the biggest drawbacks: the event only goes 6:00 - 10:00. Four hours!? If you're looking to see all of the exhibits at your own pace, you may want to visit during the day (unless you NEED the alcohol). With all of the walking, talking, and photographing, we barely had any time to see the exhibits. There are probably a thousand info placards that we didn't even bother to skim.\n\nBut that's just my selfishness talking. The animals do need to sleep, and we'd rather have them alive and moving than dead and rotting (unless they're dead and stuffed). Plan for multiple visits if you eventually want to see all of what Nightlife has to offer! My review sounds negative, but I had a blast. Grab a bunch of friends and spend an evening in the city. And feel free to infiltrate my group.", "author": "E. R."}

The Academy itself was very impressive, and the atmosphere was fun, but there were some issues.  First, we got there early (we are from out of town and took a taxi) and had to stand out in the sun for about 25 minutes.  I asked the employee at the info. desk if I could get some water, and he refused to let me in, even though there was a table just inside the entrance with water.  We finally got in, but no one told us where to go for the VIP cocktail reception/tour, and several people started walking the other direction.  We found our tour guides and went up to the second floor, where they had free cocktails.  Much to my disappointment, however, the only food available was sandwiches, which I cannot eat because I have a gluten allergy.  I wanted to have something in my stomach since I was drinking wine, so I had to go down to the caf\u00e9.  The manager in the caf\u00e9 was helpful in finding something I could eat.  The tour guides rushed us through the reception (it was supposed to be 45 minutes, but the ushered us out after 30 minutes).  The tour was interesting, but the tour guide was a bit militant and had a lot of rules.  Didn't fit with the relaxed vibe we felt later on, when we were on our own.  When it came time to do the planetarium tour, no one knew where we should go for the VIP tickets, and they kept sending us back and forth.  The fourth person we spoke to finally let us in, and the show was really interesting.  The DJ was good.

I wish the penguins were more active, they were just looking back at us like, \"what the f#ck, you want us to jump into the water for the 1000th time?\" \n\nAll in all, I'm going back again for the planetarium.

The Academy is itself not all that large and if you get here right at opening you will probably see everything before your buzz kicks in but take your time with the exhibits and it becomes well worth the $12 admission.  The rainforest was particularly interesting as they do not let it get too crowded inside and this removes any sense of urgency to see an exhibit and get out of the way for the next person.  You may even get a visit from a beautiful butterfly on the top floor.  No $2 PBR's here but the neat and clean design of the Academy makes the $6-7 beers seem not entirely out of place.  If you are not a fan of crowds I would suggest getting in and out before 8pm because after that the main level can become a bit of a labyrinth of lines but if you have nothing else to do on a Thursday, slow down and enjoy the Academy and you may even catch the DJ playing a song you really like.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I noticed a lot of people on dates here. Lot's of really cool fish and reptiles to look at!... i liked the alligator gar\n\nBuy your tickets beforehand online and print them out - save yourself from standing in the horrendous line to buy tickets because you'll be standing in the long line to get in. Some of my friends started waiting to get in at 5:15 and were about the 20th people in. I definitely recommend lining up to get in early if you want to see the Planetarium show. They have 3 shows and you should grab passes to the show right when you get into the museum. Then head over to check out the rainforest because they only let a few people in at a time and it's a pretty cool exhihbit.

The museum itself was pretty good, although I didnt have enough time to get to the Rain Forest exhibit (next time).  The Aquarium setups were awesome, with a pretty obvious focus on evolution and adaptation, which of course is a myth ;)  I have to say that the extremely annoying mobs of annoying girls yelling how *&%ing cute everything was and plastering against and knocking on the glass really took away from the experience, but thats certainly not the Academy's fault.\n\nThe Planetarium was abso-freakin-lutely incredible!!!   DO NOT miss this spectacle!  Get there at 6pm sharp, wait in line outside for 20 mins or so, and b-line straight to the line to get your seats for the Planetarium show.  Id also recommend not drinking too much before this, so do it early.  Its an hour and you cant get up during the show, not to mention it really feels like you are moving at warp speeds.  Go on the roof after to see all teh constellations they talk about during the show too.\n\nThe food was severely overpriced and terrible, so eat first before you go.  The drinks were also overpriced, but Im not the type of lame-as to sneak flasks or beers in places just so I can drink, so I will keep on paying too much for a few drinks there.  \n\nThursday nights are really the time to go here, especially for only $10.  The reason I didnt give this 5 stars is the Penguin exhibit (no open air) and a number of others that were just barely large enough for the animals to move.  I really hate to see that and dont think its necessary, so myeh!\n\nAll-in-all, great experience that Ill definitely do a couple more times at least.", "author": "Mike H."}

Much more relaxing experience.\n\nEither way, both times I got to see most of the museum (minus the planetarium because tickets were out) for the low low price of $12. I'd say it's worth it even if it's really crowded... it's just better when it's not that crowded.", "author": "Steve C."}

I saw below that some people had a negative experience in the planetarium show...we saw the 3rd thursday \"current developments in astrology' show and thought it was fascinating (after 4 glasses of wine... actually...we might have been the ones heckling in the back row... :) Definitely try to sit in the way back to feel like you're floating in space.

I were so hungry I ate it all anyway.. then someone told me there's a cafe somewhere... why didn't you tell me sooner?! lol...!!! One of my friends ask for water because she is allergic to alchi... they gave her a plastic cup for $1 with free refill for the rest of the evening. However, there are drinking water fountains all over the place so it's your choice. \n\nBlasting loud music as if you were at a club....  where am I?  Oh, a museum.... hmmm...\n\nWe arrived at 7ish which I think was a good time... forgot the Planetarium is very popular that it's already fully occupied for those arrived early. The tropical garden can been seen from where they sell food and drink and the queue is very long. We missed that because it closed at 7:30pm. \n\nWe headed to rooftop to see that telly tubby lookalike landscape. It's the 7 hills of San Francisco. How interesting. There was a staff explaining how the roof works to conserve energy and to collect rain water to feed the plants in the GGpark. I asked questions and they were all answered. The staff was very informative and knowledgeable. It is obvious that she enjoyed telling us all about this! \n\nWe then move over to the aquarium. I realised the whole place become progressively packed as time went by especially inside the aquarium. By that time everyone seemed to flood into the aquarium so it gets difficult to move around or to try to see things in those fish tanks in general. The aquarium itself is interesting and the statue like albino alligator looks totally harmless in his pinkish lifeless eyes.... Something I found funny is that the tide pool is located in the basement instead of on ground level. I thought all aquarium built the same ie. tide pool on the ground floor then for each level down it shows fishes according to the sea level. I were somewhat disappointed by the layout but all were forgotten when I saw the colourful coral and fishes and oh I so love those little cute jellyfish that bobbled around that cylinder tube!! They bobbled up and down, sideways, rolling around at the bottom of the tank and they change colour! So cute~~~ I could sit there all night smiling at them lol...!! \n\nOh we also went by where the penguins are. It's dark there and they are just standing around not even swimming... I wonder if it's their bedtime soon... \n\nBy the time we left is 9ish.. and by then I began to feel alchi breath all around me and gosh wasn't that a good time to leave? I'll be back. I'll be back at daytime to see how the museum looks like and to hear laughter of children when they see the jellyfish :) \n\nI see visiting museum as a cultural and educational experience.

I think I would need to try it again and do a few things differently- mainly just show up early!, too see if there's anything worthwhile here, but I was very disappointed with the experience. \n\nWe heard the event was from 6-10 and since traffic to SF from SJ is usually awful, we did not want to travel at 5pm. So we arrived late around 7:30pm. The place wasn't as big as I was expecting. There are only a few exhibits:\n1- The Planetarium. I was looking forward to this one the most. Apparently you need to wait in line and get tickets just to see a show in the planetarium and all shows were sold out by 7:30. \n2- The Rainforest. We tried to get in here too but they told us it was only open until 7:30 and then it's fully shutdown at 8pm, so we were able to enter that either. Why do they advertise that the event is from 6-10 if the Rainforest (one of the 2 main exhibits) is closed at 7:30?? \n3- The Aquarium. This was fine. Nothing too exciting, definitely not as good as going to a real aquarium. \n4- The African Hall. I'd rather go to a zoo and see living animals then to see a few stuffed ones. Walked in and out of this one pretty quickly. \n5- The Pendulum. This was cool to checkout, but wait around for 1/2 hour to see the pendulum knock down one bar. \n6- The Global Warming 'exhibit'. Pfft!\n\nWe arrived around 7:30 and were done with the exhibits (walked around the place twice) by 9.\n\nI think this place is good if you're looking to mingle, find a date or take a first date. However I was with my boyfriend and friends and it was kind of obnoxious having the DJ blasting music and tons of people crowding the way while boozing. There were so many people there who were wayyy dressed up too - 5inch heels everywhere! I definitely felt that people were there to be seen and flirt and few were there to see the actual exhibits! \n\n$11 for parking in the museum lot, $12/ person to get in.

I was literally shocked when I saw the people dressed up in a way that they were in a night club. There were literally DJs inside, playing crappy house music. People are drinking alcohol and checking each other out... in a science place? Science is the ONLY discipline left for humans for finding truth by its pragmatic, always questioning nature. I found it insulting and degrading to bring clubbers, drunken and high people inside, have a dance atmosphere and trip on the fish. Dude, that's awesome! Americana at its best! \n\nI understand that it might be the only way to bring those people in and make them interested in marine life, biology, astronomy and other scientific disciplines. I see the logic behind it. ( well, not to mention that they make pretty good over alcohol sales) However, I think that in the big picture, it damages the whole. I would recommend everybody to go there and try to have a better understanding of what's really inside with a SOBER brain. Because you need your brain inside so that you can grasp something... perspective... understanding of the life, universe, most of all, yourself! If you don't pay attention, all you will get is an amazingly entertaining night, all you would miss is... basically everything. \n\nCheers!", "author": "Jim H."}

The simulated earthquake room, which allows you to experience the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes.  Horrible.  Sounds like a cool idea in theory.  But beware if you have ever had any neck or back problems.  These earthquake simulations are extremely strong and may severely aggravate a prior neck or back injury. The website advisory mentioned nothing about risks for someone with neck or back problems, and there was no warning sign on the exhibit either.  Or, if there was a warning sign, it was certainly not obvious, and was therefore was completely worthless.  There should definitely be a large and clearly visible warning on a museum exhibit that can cause actual physical injury to someone.  I entered this exhibit presuming that it must be safe, since it is just a simulation after all, and it is part of a planned exhibit in the museum. I believed that if it did actually cause injury, they wouldn't have it in a museum.  But I was wrong.  I walked into the earthquake room pain free, feeling perfectly fine.  I'm in my early 30s and healthy and fit aside from minor back problems from an injury a long time ago.  I walked out of the room after the exhibit with neck pain, back pain and a headache which has lasted for hours and has not subsided (5 hours later). It feels as if I got into a major car accident and had whiplash.   You can just as easily pass through the room and watch how much it shakes from the outside, without having to physically be inside the room and risk injuring yourself. I wish I never did it.\n\nIn addition, the alcohol and food are outrageously expensive but only mediocre in quality.\n\nAside from that, everything else was fascinating and I would go again, after eating and drinking first, and making sure to avoid the stupid earthquake simulator.", "author": "Jkm D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-07", "description": "When I first heard that the California Academy of Sciences was reopening, I was one of the first people that were googling for news about it every day. When it finally opened to the public, circumstances had prevented me from going. Once I heard all the news about how long the lines were, I was really discouraged into going and followed a wait-for-a-year strategy once the hubbub had died down.\n\nI finally decided to go after getting into a very coincidental conversation with two separate friends. The first mentioned checking it out, and the second wanted to take me here for my birthday. I ended up going both times of course.\n\nOn my first experience (non-birthday), I was underwhelmed with what the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) had become. I loved the old facility with its aging walls and glass sealant in its old aquariums. It had this mystical charm to it when I was a kid. Like any person, we have to mature and compartmentalize our reality. And CAS has done the same. Instead of the gigantic dinosaur exhibit that made you feel like you were in the Jurassic period, they just have a few skeletons here and there. Instead of a giant space exhibit, they have built only a planetarium that's almost impossible to get into unless you're Flash Gordon. Now that I'm done griping.\n\nBecause of it's daytime and structural problems, Nightlife is one of the best ways for adults to enjoy the Museum without leaving feeling gypped. Yes the drink and food are expensive, but for $10 to check out the same facilities that would be available for almost triple the price, it's well worth it. Buy a few drinks and just walk around with it to enjoy the ambiance. Also, I suggest checking in advance for who is DJing / Playing that night because you may or may not like who you see listed. But a frat-boy cup of white wine on the Living Roof on top floor at night is one of the best views in the city. I strongly suggest you get there early if you really want to check out the planetarium show, so you can get the tix as they do run out very fast. Once you get your tickets, go line up for the indoor jungle biosphere. It's really cool to just check it all out. These two are two of the five exhibits. The jungle closes earlier so that the butterflies, lizards, snakes, and frogs can sleep. The main attraction that is available all night is the aquarium, which is worth half the admission. It's a massive underground facility with multiple aquariums for different environments. The best, in my opinion, is the Philippines exhibit. It's huge and there's plenty of seating underneath the glass wall. The fourth exhibit, is the living roof. Go up there with a drink, you won't regret it. It can be a little chilly since it IS San Francisco, so bring a coat. Finally, \n\nYes, the drinks are way overpriced, but how do you think they can afford to operate for only $10 admission? So buy at least one drink. \n\nHowever, the food, I do not recommend. There are so many restaurants to the north and south of the park that are well within driving distance (or even bus service). Clement street has a lot of spots open late at night, and of course Irving/Judah are closest. If you must, then buy food there, but if not, have a little patience and head out. \n\nCAS' Nightlife is definitely worthwhile for adults to check out especially if they don't have kids and don't want to wait in line for seven hours to find out that you may not get in (just exaggerating, though there were some cases early on when CAS first re-opened).\n\nFor me, I will always long for the days of old when there was the giant courtyard with the dolphin fountain in the center. The giant space and the artistically done dinosaur exhibits were the my favorites as a kid. The improvements, however, reflect the adult-side that the kid in me grew up to be. CAS Nightlife definitely rocks, and deserves all four stars.", "author": "Michael C."}

This will save you the trouble of waiting in line outside. No fun, especially if it's the least bit chilly. And even though there are thousands of tickets available - I think this Thursday's figure was some 3000 people in total - the event does sell out, and quickly. We were in the will call line at 6:45, and they had closed the ticket sales line.\nGet there as early as you can, as street parking around the park fills up. Feel free to pay the extra $10 to park in the garage if you don't want to hassle with a long walk. The building fills up as well - if you get there early, you may be able to see the exhibits before the crowds arrive.\nOnce you get in, go to either the line for the Planetarium or the Rainforest.

The sphere itself closes at 8:30.\nThe staff is wonderful - very helpful, happy to talk to you, and they know their stuff.\n\nLike others, I thought this was going to be a cool opportunity to see the new building in a cool way, free of yelling, running kids. Well, we did see the building, but there were lots of yelling drunk adults, some running. The music is cool, albeit at club decibels in some places. The people watching (and watching people watching) is great. But I really don't feel like I saw enough of the building and exhibits - the aquarium was packed. We missed out on the Planetarium and Rainforest due to a misunderstanding about the lines. And the exhibits we did see left me wanting. The aquarium was enjoyable, but felt like a miniature Monterey Aquarium wannabe. \n\nThis is a great opportunity for people that want to get together and mingle in a new, unique venue. It's also great for people that might want to meet some new friends, but want an experience a step above a club. This is not for people wanting to see the Academy and what it has to offer.

We started off in the Rain forest, which you really need to get to before 7:15.

It was a strange experience- I felt something moving on my head.... sort of a \"gross bug in my hair feeling\".  I turn around and people are staring and taking pictures of me- then I finally got it- butterfly in the hair.  The penguins are so adorable.  My favorite thing is when they jump into the water.

We got in line at 5:45--with friends who had been there since 5:30 waiting for us.  When I've gone before, I've done the same thing.  I generally get sick of the scene after about an hour or so.  We pretty immediately got tix for the 7:30 Bella Gaia by Kenji Williams http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQSC4X3iWQU which was the main reason we were all there.  I'm so glad we got there early since it looks like a lot of people didn't get into the show who wanted to.  Between the time we arrived and when the show went on, we had a drink, ate a little food, saw a couple of the exhibitions.  I've been to the museum before and definitely wasn't planning to spend a lot of time looking at the exhibitions during this event.  It's a little crazy--a real party atmosphere that's fun for a while, but I was so glad when 7:30 rolled around and we went into the gorgeous planetarium.  Bella Gaia was fabulous--I'm really glad to have seen it and I highly recommend IT, but nightlife is really not that fun if you don't like major party scenes and lots of lines.  Better to visit the museum when its not so crowded.", "author": "Ariel W."}

The Planetarium gets FIVE stars - YES FIVE!! That was amazing! I loved it - I got a little motion sick - but like the guy said just close your eyes for a second and you will be ok. I gave the Nightlife 4 stars cause it was a bit crowded with a lot of drunks - hey - I'm not condoning drinking - I'm quite a lush myself - but I think in this venue people should have a little more consideration for others and some manners - I would love to see the fish too with out some girls just standing there talking about their boyfriends - do that upstairs in the big area - not by the fish - I'm sure they don't want to hear about it either! I was also a little concerned about the animals - does the loud pounding of music bother them? Hopefully the CAS is looking after them and making sure they are ok. It seems like they're on the up and up. Where the heck was the white alligator? I missed it some how? The rain forest and living roof was amazing and my favorite fish display was the alligator fish and of course Howard the Penguin and his friends. I really was blown away - CAS did a great job!!!! Yeah for kettle 7's and fish!! I need to go diving!", "author": "Jodi B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-30", "description": "I went last Thursday (1/27/2010).  From reading other reviews, I was concerned about the availability of parking and planetarium passes.  Since we were coming from the South Bay, we didn't get there until around 6:15 or 6:30, but surprisingly there was plenty of free street parking on MLK just a 5 minute walk away, and still passes for the 6:30 and 7:30 shows (8:30 was sold out). Maybe it was a less popular night to go.  Enjoyed the rainforest, the aquarium is huge! Seemed larger than Birch Aquarium in San Diego.  Favorites were the large octopus (I've never seen one move so much before, it was amazing!) the hands on tidepool, and the nautilus.  We did eat before going, but the cafe seemed to have quite a large selection of food that smelled good. As others have mentioned, Citipass has a $2 off coupon, and you get in free within 7 days of your birthday, so for the two of us, it was just $10 - a great deal for what you get.", "author": "Julie P."}
