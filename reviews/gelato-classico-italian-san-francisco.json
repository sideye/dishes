To find it, look for the small green awning and the larger-than-life gelato statue on the sidewalk.  It's less than a half-mile away from Washington Square Park.  This tiny, cute neighborhood shop serves up delicious gelato (Italian ice cream).\n\nThe gelato here is rich, creamy, flavorful, smooth, and somewhat thick/dense (in a good way).  There are about 20 different flavors to try.  They include:\n\nStrawberry fresca\nBurgundy cherry\nStracciatella - Italian chocolate chip gelato (finer sized chips)\nWhite chocolate raspberry\nRaspberry\nCoppa Mista - chocolate, vanilla, almond, pistachio\nVanilla bean\nDark chocolate\nTiramisu\nCreme brulee\nSmores\nMint chip\nSpumoni - cherry, pistachio, chocolate with cherry bits\nBavarian mint\nPeanut butter chocolate\nPeanut butter cup\nPistachio\nCookie dough\n\nIf there's not a line of customers behind you, ask for several samples.  You'll may find it hard to decide what to get because all of the flavors taste great.  I personally go for the sweeter, creamier flavors over the fruit flavors.  My favorites are the vanilla, spumoni, pistachio, and cookie dough.  The spumoni has real cherry bits and the pistachio has real pistachio bits.\n\nPricing is as follows:\n\nPint - $7.95\nLarge (1-4 flavors) - $5.95\nRegular (1-3 flavors) - $4.95\nSmall (1-2 flavors) - $3.95\nWaffle cone - $4.25 (1 flavor), $4.95 (2 flavors)\n\nUnless you're really hungry or can eat a lot of gelato, I think the small size should suit most people just fine.  I like to get 2 flavors.\n\nSpace inside the store is limited.  There are only 2 tables (seating 2 each) inside and a bench outside.  That's OK because the park is only a stone's throw away.\n\nSo, if you're in North Beach and looking to fill that sweet tooth, Gelato Classico Italian should fit the bill.

I think it's impossible to have bad gelato... like bad ice cream. Can dessert ever really be bad?\n\nThe shop is cute and right in the heart of north beach. It's only a block away from Naia and if you have the choice, go here over Naia any day. The prices are standard for gelato: about 3.50 for a small and 4.25 for a regular. Same small portions and same small spoons, but very rich, creamy taste.\n\nI sampled the lemon poppyseed and unlike many yelpers, I was not a fan. But I do love the coppa mista. Amazing combination that was rich, nutty, but not overly sweet at the same time. I had that with the hazelnut, which was the best I've had but I'm sure there are better ones out there.\n\nGreat little place, but my one complaint is that they nickel and dime you to death. 25 cents if you want a waffer cookie no bigger than 2 inches diameter to go with your gelato... you think they could at least give it to you complimentary if desired. I did not want a cookie. That was not the point. The point is I'd like to know that I wouldn't be charged extra in order to get one.\n\nOther than that, great shop and great location. Good flavors.

I won't argue with the fact that this place does have some excellent flavors (of the ones we tried, tiramisu was probably the best). However, the gelato has two major weaknesses.\n\n1) The texture is rather chalky. The lower the milkfat content, the harder this chalkiness becomes to avoid, but I've had a lot better executed gelatos.\n\n2) Many of the flavors feel too weak. For example, I could hardly taste the strawberry in my strawberry!! There is a crucial distinction between a subtle flavor and a weak one. For well-executed subtlety, try a good hazelnut ice cream, such as Toscanini's Nocciola. These flavors were a bit uninspired (and in the other direction, the dark chocolate was too obviously just a whole lot of cocoa powder chucked into an ice cream base).\n\nAs a third point, the serving temperature is probably a squeak on the warm side, just past the soft / melting line.

We were in the mood for it: we had caught some rays, spotted the store as we walked up for a late lunch at North Beach Pizza, which is also nearby, and we just decided that we had a collective sweet tooth. We weren't disappointed.\n\nThere was a man who was quite charming and rather friendly giving us the gelato. The prices are a little high but given gelato, they're actually quite decent or \"regular,\" for lack of a better term.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-15", "description": "As part of my ongoing quest to find decent gelato in the Bay Area (after returning from my third trip to Italy), I made the trek out to the city to try Gelato Classico. Word on the street is that it's pretty good. Of course, most of the gelato you can find in this greater metropolitan area is bafflingly awful compared to the real thing in Italy, so I take any gelato recommendations here with a colossal grain of salt. \n\nAt any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by their gelato. I had a cone with gianduia (a cioccolato and nocciola combo) and a scoop of the tiramisu. The texture was smoother and creamier, and closer to authentic Italian gelato, than the grainy grit or hard-as-a-rock iciness of other gelaterie around these parts. The biggest problem with gelato in the US is that no one seems to get the texture right and it's usually either too hard and too cold and/or icy, or strangely gritty or chalky. But Gelato Classico seems like they are trying harder to replicate the super smooth consistency of Italian gelato. It was almost a wee bit too goopy or gooey, though, as if they were overcompensating or something. \n\nThe flavors were decent. Not quite as rich and potent as they should've been (for example, the hazelnut tasted weak), but overall, things tasted okay. \n\nBut wait, there's more! We asked if they made their gelato on the premises. \"No!\" they said. Shock! Horror! Of course every self-respecting gelato snob knows to avoid shops that don't make their own gelato right there in the back room. They said their gelato is made in Concord. Yeah, that had us scratching our heads too. But strangely, bizarrely, their gelato is still far superior to Gelateria Naia (who's inferior gelato, they claim, is made on the premises). It's still inferior to the best gelato you can find in Italy, but I give them points for trying.", "author": "Giofreddo W."}

I first saw this place while dining at Cafe Divine a few weeks ago and remember thinking to myself that I would much rather have been eating gelato than eating whatever it was I was eating at the time. I suppose if you knew me well enough, you'd realize that I always would rather be eating gelato than doing the task at hand since ice cream is my true calling. In any event, today, being a rather hot one, seemed like a fitting day for some after work frozen delight. Taking the cable car over to Washington square park, a huge grin across my face (just thinking about ice cream makes me smile) you might have mistaken me for a tourist (minus the map and camera). Stepping inside the small yet charming shop, I was greeted by an extremely friendly girl at the counter who was patient enough to allow me to sample quite a few flavors before deciding on the final scoop. I ended up choosing the banana walnut and mango sorbet, stuffed nicely into a sugar cone. This rather small confection cost me a whopping $4.15. Now I don't mind paying $4.15 if I am getting a large, but come on, this was the smallest size they had, on a generic cone (not home made waffle or anything exciting). The gelato and sorbet was definitely tasty, the mango being particularly special.
