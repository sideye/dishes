We came to the city last Saturday the 20th for a night out.  \n\nI actually called Tadich's earlier in the week to get a reservation, the manager told me they don't take them, but I asked what time to get there then on a Saturday evening if we had an event to be at 8:00 pm, he said to be safe arrive at 5:30-6:00 pm as there's usually a wait.\n\nWe got there right at 5:30 pm and there was an open pair of seats at the end of the bar top by the kitchen line, we took that offer right away.\n\nThis place has a cool vibe and look, a different look.  It's not a huge restaurant but long, the bar top isn't an actual bar, but a long counter with bar stools and they serve you right there.  I may be off but it seemed like this long U shaped bar made up about 60-70% of this places seating.  \n\nWhile sitting by the food line you're both tortured and delighted to see all the dishes they put out.  \n\nWe started with the oysters rockefeller and then got our main dishes.  I ordered the charbroiled halibut steak, and my wife got the seared scallops.  Both were excellent.  They both came with mixed veggies and mine had a side of fries with it, my wifes had rice with it.  \n\nNext time we return I'd like to try the seafood medley on the oven baked side with shrimp, crab, & one other.  We'll be back for sure.", "author": "Ryan A."}

Upon entering, I stood waiting to get name on a list. A male server with serious attitude finally decided to acknowledge me. when I said \"john for two\" he began making snide smart ass comments \"oh you dont look like john...or is it johan\"? \nOk dotard, stop being cute and put my frigging name down. Should have turned around and walked out at that first sign.\n2. If you enjoy European style service where you wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged about anything then this place is for you. 20 minutes for a martini. \nFFS.\n3. All male service, which in my opinion usually leaves poor attention to details and it was definitely the theme of the night.\n4. Server forgot our oysters, which finally came after our salads and \"reminding\" him 25 minutes after ordering them.\n5. Caesar salad was awful. Dressing was barely there, flavorless and watery. Shrimp looked canned and tasted worse.\n6. Grilled halibut. Atrocious! It was so overcooked it could have been cat food.\nI am from Seattle and have fished halibut, while the portion was fantastic, the overall execution was piss poor. My hubands wasn't as overcooked as mine but his was dry as well.\nI honestly should have sent it back but instead chose to bury it under a gallon of their grainy, overly dilled tartar sauce. I ate about 1/3 of it before even the tartar couldn't hide how badly it was overcooked.\nJust gross. Waste of $35\n\nI am a server in San Francisco and honestly?

The restaurant is iconic and lives up to the hype! The moment you walk in you're greeted by servers who are dressed in classic white attire, there are no reservations and you can sit on the bar or be seated at a table. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is super simple and classic looking...all I was thinking was \"if only these walls could talk\"....i mean 1849....that's throwback and that is why it is named the oldest restaurant in California and third oldest in the United States. The seafood here is what they're known for however the red meat is AMAZING! \n\nPrices are $$$-$$$$ plan on spending over $50 and really enjoy yourself.  \n\nWe had the Chilean sea bass and the slow roasted prime rib with a half bottle of some great red merlot. The meal was perfection and just enough to keep the day going without food coma.

The food is super ordinary, and the server we got was one of the worst we've ever had in San Francisco -- and possibly the entire Bay Area. His name is ALVIN. He said he'd worked there for 8 years but has been a server in SF for 20. Huh? He was a total jerk!\n\nFirst off, he served us huge pieces of garlic bread stacked on a small platter. He refused to give us individual bread plates and said that we were \"supposed to make a mess.\" Did he expect us to place the bread on the tablecloth? Gross!\n\nWhenever we tried to ask for something -- more water or whatnot -- he would pretend not to hear us and would immediately turn his back and walk away. He rushed to take our orders, barked rude comments like why someone who was on the large side was seated where he was, and made fun of our friend who'd been having cocktails and was a bit red in the face, etc. Crap you wouldn't expect from your server!\n\nWhen it came time for dessert, we ordered 4 different kinds to share, and one of them tasted rancid, like it was made with bad eggs. My partner told him that, and his response was, \"Nice try! That's old school. That's how it's really supposed to taste. But nice try!\" Nice try for what? A free dessert? Our food and drinks tab (without dessert) more than paid for that crap on a plate -- and he was defending it! He eventually took it off the tab, but only after we reacted pretty badly, which he probably overheard outside our booth.\n\nHe refused to take a group photo of us and gave us all kinds of dumb reasons why he couldn't do it, so we asked another server to do it. He said he would come back but never did.\n\nI would have spoken to a manager on our way out, but there was no one in sight when we got up to leave. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. It may be a San Francisco \"institution,\" but there are way more touristy places in the area where you could have better food, better service, and a lot better dining experience.", "author": "Mich P."}

They carry traditions forward to today. Will not see you until your whole party is there, won't take reservations, and older staff.  \n\nMy husband met us at the restaurant, and put our name on the list as we were walking from the theater. He had a really good time with the bartender and enjoyed his drink while he waited for us. Once we arrived, they had our table ready and we were seated in one of the little side rooms, not a private one, but I shared one. Our waiter came with bread and menus and filled her water glasses almost immediately after we were seated. We chit chatted with him about the menu regarding appetizers and his favorite dishes. He left us alone to make our decisions and to enjoy the wonderful sourdough French bread.  Our bar drinks came out relatively quickly and they took our appetizer order. We had fried calamari and crab cakes with our drinks. The crab cake was delicious and the calamari was nice and crisp. It was also not oily.  The  calamari came with two sauces  tartar and a tomato-based sauce.    \n\nOur main courses arrived and they were absolutely the most delicious things we have eaten in a while. Several of us had fish either grilled, and a cioppino, or saut\u00e9ed. One of our party had a steak. The fish was cooked perfectly and his steak was done to order. There was a lot of food!

This place treated me so well that I went there back to back nights on my most recent trip to SF. \n\nI was in town for the marathon and I got in on Friday. I was SUPER nervous because it was my first full marathon, I had put countless hours of effort, time, miles into this. I wanted nothing more than to run the SF marathon and have it be my first 26.2! Now I know from running enough half marathons that I have to be very careful about what I eat the two days prior to the race. I didn't want anything to mess up my stomach on race day so I had to be very careful about what I ate for dinner on Fri & Sat nights. As dinner time started approaching on Friday, I sifted through nearby places on Yelp (I was staying at the Hyatt). I started to get frustrated. All I wanted was a fish fillet and some rice. I couldn't seem to find a place that had it. Finally my frustration got the best of me and I figured \"I might as well walk down a few blocks to this Tadich Grill and see if they can just make what I'm asking.\" (I had seen quite a few fish options and rice as a side so was hoping they could accommodate). \n\nWhen I walked in, I loved the feel of this place. The counter style service, men dressed in crisp, clean linen workshirts/aprons. I felt like I had timewarped back into the 1950's and I loved it!\n\nI took a seat at the bar right when I walked in. The gentleman asked me if I would be dining and I said yes. He pointed me further down in the the restaurant where there were menus, napkins and silverware placed by each seat. I took a seat down there and was quickly helped by a server named Jose. Although I was nervous to ask for Jose to cook up something special for me, he had no problem whatsoever! I told him that I wanted a filet of fish. He named off three options for me and I went with the salmon. He said he could definitely do that with the rice. I asked what kind of veggies they had and he named off a few. I asked for just carrots but he then told me that it was a medley and they couldn't be separated. \"Ok no worries!\" I told him. I can't get too picky here! As I sipped on my water, he gave me a nice chunk of bread to snack on. As much as I wanted to use the butter he gave me, I left it there (pre-race dining is tough!). He noticed that I wasn't using the butter and quickly offered olive oil instead. I declined but I appreciated him asking!\n\nVery quickly (I'd say less than ten mins) and my delicious meal was out! A perfectly cooked salmon filet (no oil or butter as I had requested), rice pilaf and a heaping mound of carrots (what a pleasant surprise!). It was a delectable meal. Perfect for a pre-race dinner! I scarfed the salmon down. It was amazing! I ate the rice too but honestly there were just too many carrots. I couldn't finish it all!\n\nI appreciated the meal and service so much that I ended up going back the second night (Marathon eve) and got the same thing (without the carrots). There was no way I was going to find a better meal that close to my hotel. It was much busier the second night (the first time I went it was 3pm on a Friday, and then 3pm on a Saturday...keep in mind my body was on East Coast time for dinner). So Saturdays are of course much busier. I sat next to a local and he said it eventually gets to the point later in the night where people are standing behind you waiting for you to get up. I can easily see why!\n\nThey also proudly tout themselves as they oldest restaurant in the state of California! I love that they have their story on the front of their menus (I love history!). It was fun to read. Although they have changed locations and names a few times, you can tell this is a well established, family owned restaurant (has been Croatian owned/operated the entire time!). \n\nI really loved this place and if I decide to do the SF Marathon every year, I will definitely be coming here for all my pre-race dinners! Thank you Tadich Grill and Jose for making my marathon experience that much better with your delicious food! :)", "author": "Chelsea E."}

Stools sidle along the circumference of this powerhouse, while tables parade and exquisite booths beckon from her tangents. Counter-side dining is first -come- first serve.

My problem?  I picked the cioppino because I have to eat as oil free as possible and I was assured there wasn't oil in the broth.  Wrong!  My stomach does not lie - and if you check the Tadich Grill recipe for Cioppino online, you'll see that it has a lot of olive oil in it.  I actually called the chef to confirm - his comment was \"very little\".  I had a miserable night because of it, but most people would love it.

Not far, and we made some stops along the way. The first couple of stops were far worse than the tourist hot spots. We kept walking. We kept Yelping until this little place on California St. caught our attention. Looked like it was worth checking out.\n\nAmbiance. 10 out of 10. Long, huge counter and old booths offer fun or intimate seating. Bartenders are well seasoned veterans who obviously know what they're doing and care. We worked the specialty menu. Sazeracs, aviations, old fashions, Moscow mules, they killed it. Delicious cocktails. \n\nFood. Complimentary, sourdough bread was delicious. Why can't buttered bread be good for you? Side ravioli and meat sauce was a needed change after an ocean of seafood. Good sized serving too. Crab and shrimp stuffed petrale sole was baked heaven. The lady next to us at the bar ordered it. I want to personally thank her. Had I not creepily watched her enjoy her dinner, I would have probably never ordered it. Amazing! It looks too cheesy, it's not. It looks too creamy, it's not. It's just damn good. Bourbon bread pudding topped off our day of overindulgence. \n\nHighly recommend this spot. It's been there forever for a reason. We'll be back for more!", "author": "Joe E."}

This place doesn't do reservations so we made sure we came here prior to the dinner rush.  We arrived here around 6ish which had no line.  They offer valet parking which cost $15.00 so that was very convenient as this restaurant was smacked in the middle of Financial District.  I'm sure you can find street parking if you really are patient in finding one but at least you'll know there is valet parking if you need it.  We were greeted by every staff member when we made our way into the restaurant.  The ambiance of the place is as vintage and \"old world\" feel to it.  \"Old San Franciscan\" as people would say.  The staff were wonderful!  Our server almost reminded us of 'Colonel Sanders'.  He was charming and knowledgeable and he made our first experiences here at Tadich Grill so great.\nWe were started off with a hot and fresh loaf of bread which was just delicious!  For entree, I got the 16oz bone-in rib eye with shrimp.  Let me tell you... that rib eye (cooked medium) was cooked to perfection!  It was tender, juicy, and absolutely an amazing piece of meat.  The shrimp that came with it were big and cook just enough so there is still a bite to it; a wonderful addition to the rib eye.  The entree came with steamed veggies which was good and their famous potato wedges (really big but wished it was cooked just a little bit more) but otherwise altogether, it was great.  I must say for our first time here at Tadich Grill, it was a marvelous experience!

I was immediately struck by the sight of the long, dark wood bar with brass railings. I was delighted to be greeted by the wide smiles of the bartenders dressed in formal white coats. I immediately felt the history of this place and was eager to experience what they had to offer.\n\nThere were three of us, so we figured we'd order a few things to get a nice sampling of Tadich's menu. \n\nWe got:\n\n- a cup of the clam chowder: it was a larger portion than what I'd consider a typical cup (not a bad thing, right?). The chowder had a nice flavor to it, but was a bit thicker (pastier) than I would have liked.\n\n- the fried calamari: they were fried well, tasted fresh, and were not oily. Unfortunately, they were pretty bland - it appears they didn't even salt the rings after coming out of the fryer (rookie move).\n\n- the crab cake starter: the cake was full of fresh crab, which was a great treat. I can't stand when places fill their crab cakes with too much filler (crumbs). Unfortunately, it was sauced with a heavy, rather bland egg-based sauce that frankly takes away from the freshness of the crab.\n\n- the seafood saut\u00e9 which had two nice big scallops, two large prawns and crab leg meat. It was accompanied by rice pilaf and steamed veggies. This dish followed the same cooking style the other dishes adhered to: bland, soft veggies. Dull rice. A heavy, dated butter sauce that masked the flavor of the wonderful fish that was hiding underneath it. \n\n- crab and prawn thermidor: honestly, there was absolutely nothing good to say about this. It was a heavy, mess of slop that wasn't worthy of more than the first bite. I feel sorry for the poor crab and prawns that found themselves in this monstrosity. Do Not Order!\n\nIn sum, beyond the thermidor, everything was fine. However, I have a problem paying $165 for food that's just \"fine\" when there are so many amazing places to eat in this city. Having a rich history of being California's oldest restaurant is impressive, but at some point one needs to update the menu to align with contemporary tastes. The best I can say about Tadich is my grandparents would love it. \n\n TLDR: bland, overpriced, heavily sauced, dated", "author": "Vincent B."}

I remember when this neighborhood was only populated by women in dresses and men in suits and ties, often carrying brief cases (hard and likely leather).\n\nNow, it's a different world with people younger than me... wait, I am getting up there now... in this part of town.  The waiters/waitresses in their traditional white jackets bring back memories of days gone by.  There were two counter seats open on the right so we saddled up and studied the menu.  I was tempted to try their touted cioppino, but, being lunch on a work day, didn't want to doze off in a food coma at my desk.  Their sand dabs are another signature, but I'm not that big on fish.  As a result, here's what I had:\n\n1. Coney Island clam chowder (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UeWAA_lf-Q1sjS2WR57nvQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pretty good version and tomato-ey.  Clams were apportioned well and glad it wasn't mostly potatoes.\n\n2. Linguine with clams, white wine sauce (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oJ8EPvYiGh6ZojpR0zeFmg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Very simple yet clean tasting preparation which led to plenty of bread dipping.  My friend pointed out that the clams were still in shell, unlike most places where they serve this with chopped clams (possibly canned).\n\nOur waiter was curt and efficient but not very amicable.  Water glasses and my iced tea were refilled as well as my host's coffee cup.  The vibe is a little different from what I remember with a mix of the local work force and tourists during this weekday lunch.  I enjoyed my meal and the sourdough bread went a long way in cleaning both food bowls.  \n\nGuess I need to try their Cioppino next time.

We were all  shopping, walking all over creation etc... And was starvin' Marvin. My Uncle recommended we all eat at Tadich Grill. Why not? I've never eaten hear before. \n\n They list there menu outside of the restaurant for those who want to what is offered before entering. The menu is never the same and changes everyday based on what fresh meat and seafood is available for that day. \n\n We walk in and the bar area is huge! This is one of not the oldest restaurant in San Francisco. It's been in busy since 1849 and the family still owns the restaurant! \n\n To dine in you must spend at $11.50 per per which is easy to do. Check splitting is $9.00 per person for those who like to split checks and No substitutions on food. \n\n I ordered the Traditional Tadich meatloaf $18.95 I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but the meatloaf here is on point! One of the best I've ever had. It's 3 thick slices wrapped in bacon and topped with a delicious mushroom sauce. It comes with mash potatoes and mixed vegetables. The mixed veggies were tasty and can't comment on the potatoes as I'm allergic. \n\n My honey ordered the hamburger steak dinner $22.95, which came with insanely thick & huge cut potato wedges and mixed vegetables. She said the hamburger steak is amazing. Both of us had very generous dinner portions. \n\n My sister ordered the scallop dinner which came with 4 seared scallops, rice pilaf and mixed vegetables. The portion was decent, but not for the price $33 which could have been a more generous portion( ie 2 extra Scallops would be nice) My sister enjoyed the sauce on Scallops, however the Scallops were a little on the chewy side and had a noticeable fishy aftertaste. She said she would order this dish again if, the Scallops are more on the fresher side. \n\n My brother in law ordered the Seafood curry $30. This dish was recommended by our waiter. My brother in law was going to order the same thing, I did, but didn't since the waiter highly recommend this dish, he went for it. When my bro in law's food came out it didn't look appealing at all! It looked like, what I would call a bowl o vomit... you heard right! My bro took a bit and immediately said ,the seafood curry is terrible! The look on his face was priceless! My sister & I were thinking it couldn't be that bad and though he was being a bit dramatic. So, I offered to try it and trade dishes, if need be. Nope! Bro in law wasn't being dramatic, the dish is real bad! I took a bit and started looking for somewhere to spit that mess out. Problem number #1 whoever made this dish obviously didn't taste the dish, otherwise he/she would have known that the curry powder wasn't mixed at the  way, who wants grainy, chalky thick ass curry powder in there food? #2 seasoning goes at long way had the dish been tasted before serving.  #3 The seafood had an off taste seriously, I really want to know who made this dish they were out of pocket and should rethink this dish before ever putting it on the menu again. #4 when waiter comes back to ask everyone how there food is? My bro in law tells the waiter the seafood curry isn't good and would like to order something else. When, I tell you the waiter looked insulted he gave some serious side under his glasses i was almost laughable. The waiter then says, you don't like it? Bro say, No! Waiter says, you want something else? Bro says, Yes! Waiter says, okay. You'll still have to pay for the seafood curry! We all looked at each other like, WTF?! Dude have you tasted that crap?! That dish had a bite and a half out the dish. It's not edible! I posted a photo of this Terrible seafood dish! I'm glad it wasn't me would ordered that dish, I would have told the waiter, I'm not paying for nothing I can't eat. Bro is out an unnecessary $30 and the waiter had the never to put the food in a doggy bag, like you taking this food with you. Lol! Be careful what you order if it ain't cooked right not edible etc... you're stuck with it! My bro in law did order end up ordering the meatloaf.\n\nMy Uncle ordered the Sand Dabs which came with mixed vegetables He said it was really fresh and tasty. I unfortunately, didn't get a photo if his dish. However, It did look really good. \n\n Tadich Grill for the most part is pretty decent as long as you don't order the wrong stuff. I would definitely stick to the basics when ordering, especially since they will make you pay even if, you don't eat something that doesn't taste right! \n\nMy overall rating is 3.5 stars based on the entire dinning experience and for the waiter who helped us wasn't very friendly eithe. I don't think making a customer pay for food that isn't edible is right, first and foremost and I recommend not ordering anything that the waiter recommends for this reason. I would come back only if, Meatloaf is on the menu or something in the meat section of mJust saying... you'll get your money's worth.", "author": "Janelle M."}

Seafood, steak, yum.\n\nWe did not have to wait at all. We scored a table in the back next to the open kitchen. I love watching the line work. Started with shrimp cocktail, fried calamari and crab cakes. Couple of glasses of Sauvignon Blanc. Fabulous.\n\nOff to the entrees. Oysters with crisp bacon, Cioppino, Strip Steak, medium rare. The Cioppino was extraordinary. Great broth. Delicious seafood. Garlic bread, albeit a bit salty, for dipping. One of the best seafood meals we have enjoyed. My son's steak was cooked to order. He demolished it in short order. My oysters and bacon, an odd combo, worked. I was sad there wasn't more. \n\nA righteous piece of choclate cake for dessert. Coffee. All meals have to end eventually. But we'll be back. Wonderful place.", "author": "David B."}

The weekday service is always excellent. \n\nHow surprising it was to find the service is totally different on a late saturday afternoon. When my friend and I were being seated, we mentioned that a third person might join us for dessert. The person who was seating us gave immediate attitude. His tone of voice became snippy. I could feel his eyes roll as he explained the seating policy - that Tadich doesn't seat partial parties. He gave us the option of getting a two top, then moving to a different table should the third guest arrive. Really? On a slow Saturday late afternoon? I get this policy, but I have, on previous occasions, joined an already seated party during the meal. The saddest part was the manager. Although he apologized, it was completely insincere. His apology was a non-apology. \n\nI ordered my favorite - the grilled petrale sole. When I asked to switch out the long branch potatoes for the shoe string, the server told me that would be an upcharge. How odd this is NEVER an upcharge when I dine during the work week. \n\nBoth my friend and I have worked in the Financial District for many years, and have dined at the Tadich Grille on multiple occasions. This was a first for either of us - the attitude and upcharge. Both of us left feeling like we were treated as tourists. \n\nIt's so sad that Tadich seems to have one set of rules for the business types and another for tourists. None other restaurants I regularly visit in the City do this. Based on this weekend experience, I doubt I will return for a weekend meal, and will reconsider recommending the Tadich Grille to out of town guests (both business and personal) looking for a weekend dining experience.", "author": "Sasha R."}

For the entree I ordered the petrale sole stuffed with crab and Bay shrimp which was in a b\u00e9chamel sauce served with rice. It was delicious until I found a hair in it. We sent the sole back and eventually I got the same dish without any hair in it.

This is the first time I've been (to my knowledge, anyways) and certainly (hopefully) not my last.  \n\nThey don't take reservations.  No OpenTable, nor over the phone- I'm sure a significant portion of their phone calls result in \"no, we don't take reservations\" but people will call anyways.  My dinner date and I arrived early so there were tables available.  We sat at the bar for a bit because this was our pre-Hamilton meal and that didn't start until 8pm.  \n\nI've heard about this restaurant from my folks multiple times.  Heck, their folks probably ate here also- it's that old.  Which is not to say that old is bad, because it's not.  All of the waiters had dark pants and a white jacket on- felt so proper.  \n\nOrdered some fried calamari to start the bar eats.  Larger pieces than I'm used to and just as tender.  While chowing those down, we saw the bartender make drinks like, well, like a pro.  Tadich has their own Bloody Mary mix and the ones I saw made looked PO-TENT.  Not sure I could walk up to the Orpheum after one of those even.  So I had an SF beer- Anchor Steam!\n\nEventually we sat at a table and ordered main meals.  My date had some sort of special with pasta I think.  Was way too consumed with my Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread to fully notice it.  I think this is a signature dish and it tastes like it.  \n\nThe wood-fire grill in back is impressive, leading me to want to order something cooked in it next visit.  \n\nPretty irrelevant but for those fascinated with purse hooks, they've got multiple purse hooks under the bar every few feet as well as coat hooks spaced similarly on the wall behind the bar.  Each dining nook has its hooks also.  No WiFi.  Didn't matter.\n\nHoly cioppino!  Getcha some and enjoy!", "author": "David B."}

They do not take reservations but if you come in between 4-5pm, you should be okay! My table of four waited about twenty minutes for a table to open up, but with our drinks in hand it was not a problem. \n\nThey serve real, complimentary sourdough bread while you wait for your appetizers and entrees. I was torn between the filet mignon and the cioppino and ultimately decided on the cioppino. This was a great decision!! I tried a bite of the filet mignon, per my girlfriend, and I instantly thought that the cioppino was better. \n\nFor dessert my table ordered the bourbon bread pudding and the cheesecake. The cheesecake takes the cake, in my opinion. The bread pudding had a great sauce (?) and you can definitely taste the bourbon there. They were a great closer to the dinner. \n\nLoved the decor of the restaurant. The service and the food/drinks.

Had it twice both mostly ginger ale. \nBecause these were civil attorneys we decided ahead of time it to NOT order the expensive stuff. \nShe orders assorted seafood platter. \nI order fried one with double veg no fries. \n\nBeyond the fact that the food only rivals RED LOBSTER and not much better, the servers were aloof, not very attentive and food didn't come out for the four of us at the same time. \nMy platter was well... Red lobster with linen tables cloths and napkins. I was not impressed for 36 smackers! \nI know some of the dishes are old school aka cheesy breadcrumbs cream sauce and the chopino is supposed to be to die for. But again we we're considering our hosts and tried not to go nuts. \n\nThe high light was frankly the sourdough bread. Which I'm sure they can't take credit for. \nAll the seafood tasted the same and the one oyster I did get was like the batter scooped out of oil at the end of the day. Hard dark and disgusting! \n\nTo make matters worse, we had to ask for coffee, and got an incredulous look from the waiter...No offer for dessert. No refill of coffee and finally a waiter, not ours basically asked us to leave! \n\nI've frankly received better food and service, sans linen at Long John Silver!  As we were guest of regulars, we were not sure if bad service was because of them, or because they really are running on reputation. Either way when asked by our two lawyer friends for a return visit, I will gladly pay 4x to eat elsewhere.\n\nI did take the two swizzle sticks that came with my weak ass whiskey cocktails.

The way the waiter treated our group was awful from the beginning it seemed like he had a problem with us.  We were a group of 6 and we spent over $600 in less than 3 hrs.

Then the manager actually asked us to hurry up and leave as they needed our table, but we were still eating our dessert !!! Then they literally ushered us out.  Once we were out one of the bar tenders shouted to us to close the door as if it was our job !!! When we didn't respond he shouted again.  I in fact closed the door and didn't even get a thank you. I have eaten in thousands of restaurants all over the world and never been treated in this manner.  I don't care if they were busy or not I was a paying customer who deserved to be there as did any other guest.

If you'd like something more private, there are booths tucked into alcoves along the opposite wall. \n\nThe  menu is overwhelmingly large and prices at first glance seem a bit high, but when you get your plate you'll understand that not only are you paying for quality, but also for portions! MY GOD are these plates big! \n\nBread service included in all meals. \n\nI tried the Fresh Alaskan Wild Halibut Filet in Soy Ginger Broth, found under the POACHED header. At $32.95, I really had my fingers crossed this one would be delicious and it delivered. The portion was large enough for two meals, as it comes with two separate filets and a large serving of vegetables (including an entire potato). Flavors were light and delicate. You really get the citrus and ginger in every bite. If I had one suggestion it would be to serve this one with a side of rice; it would complement the Asian-insprired broth. \n\nAt the server's recommendation, my friend ordered the Cioppino. Typically I'd look at the $34.95 price tag for a bowl of soup and laugh out loud, but OMG! The bowl was MASSIVE and just absolutely packed with scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, bay shrimp, whitefish, and dungeness crab. It was served with large hot slices of garlic bread. My friend ate and ate and ate and was able to put about 2/3 of it in a to go container. Absolutely worth the money. \n\nEven at this price point, highly recommended to anyone who wants some really exceptional seafood.", "author": "Lexi W."}

There were 4 of us, I was the only one that hasn't been to this restaurant. They were telling me it's history. That before, there were only male waiters. \n\nAs fate would have it, we had a woman waitress helping us. She was nice but was in a hurry to take our orders. Checking in is to see if we were done not to see if we needed something (I know because she wouldn't ask - will just look at our plates and walk off). \n\nWhen we told her we want to see the dessert menu, she gave it to us and walked away for a bout a minute and came back to ask what we were having. My friend went to the restroom so we told her that we're waiting for our friend to come back to decide because we are sharing the dessert. She walked away and my friend saw her smirked! \n\nAs that was my first time in this restaurant my friends said that this was the first time they received this kind of service. Usually, the waiter they've had in the past was as gentleman as they come. They would be patient, recommend dishes and just very courteous. \n\nThe food was good by the way. We ordered the Manila clams in garlic and butter. The clams was cooked perfectly and we scooped and drenched our bread in that garlic butter. We also ordered cioppino (spelling?), seafood cannelloni in cheese sauce, prime rib, scallops. Their portions were huge. Specially the prime rib. \n\nOne less star for the service but the rest was great! I would go back, hopefully I'll end up with a different waitress.", "author": "Celina S."}

They know how to chat. Know how to make suggestions. Check on you perfectly without being intrusive. \n\nFirst of all, I love that the whole bar is first come first serve. This is by definition a tourist definition and I am not beyond doing touristy things. What's annoying about most touristy places is that your overplanning super party tourists try to pillage all the seating so locals and solo diners get screwed. After about a 20-30 minute wait, I snagged myself a seat. I enjoyed it because the process was fair and equitable especially with solo older men who seem like they're from here and just enjoy the food. The self seating process is by far a highlight. \n\nThe bartender is old school and professional - asked for an old fashioned and asked what whisky I wanted which is most def how every place should do it rather than resorting to rail whisky like most joints these days. I ordered bulleit, and they had it. It was strong and no frills. \n\nAs for the dinner menu- I say it's pretty solid. Given the choice between a grilled fish dish and the cheesy casserole dish of broiled fish and prawns, the server pointed me to the cheesy dish (forgot what it's called) and I appreciated it. Nomally I don't eat cheese and I don't like gimmicky food which I was afraid this was going to be. But it was absolutely solid. And for about 20 dollars, the portion was generous and delicious. There was almost a New Orleans vibe to the food and service - they just do it right and don't pay attention to trends. Unfortunately I didn't have room for my creamed spinach so I had to ditch it after a few bites, but that was also good. Once again, no frills creamed spinach, steak diner style - just plain good. \n\nThe decor was kept the same throughout the years and it was absolutely gorgeous. \n\nI wouldn't eat here all the time if I lived in the Bay Area (I hate waiting) but definitely worth trying out as a tourist and bringing your out of town friends to experience golden age dining.", "author": "Lillian C."}

He said no problem, they would leave the butter sauce off.  For my dish the waiter recommend the Crab and Prawn House Special with a paprika sauce.  \n\nThey left the butter sauce off the Sea Bass, but also left the rice off.  When asked the waiter said she couldn't have it because it was gluten. Ten minutes later my wife started having a reaction to the fish.

It wasn't thick like tomato sauce and it wasn't too watery; it was just right.  Every single shellfish piece was gigantic, so the counts don't really do it justice (2 Mussels, 2 Clams, 3 Shrimp, 3 Scallops).  My only complaint about the ratio would be that there was way too much whitefish compared to dungeness crab.  It was all delicious though, with enough leftover for a tasty lunch the following day.

They don't take reservations, but things move quickly here so the wait shouldn't be too long.  At prime time on a Saturday night (around 8 pm), it took about 30 minutes for our name to be called (and another 2 minutes for them to move on from us when we didn't show up immediately) but we were able to get seating at the bar within 5 minutes, which is what we had opted to do.  There seemed to be more bar seats than tables, so this is probably a better spot for 2 people vs a group.  What I liked about the bar seating which is first come first serve is that the bartender manages the seating and makes sure that whomever came first gets the next available seats.\n\nIt's a lively, friendly place with a cool old school vibe and very friendly staff.  Note that they only have wine by the bottle, not by the glass, but the prices are extremely reasonable and they have some great choices (oddly, barely a mark up on the ones I recognized).  \n\nThe menu is printed daily, but there are some specialties like the Cioppino, which is what I opted for and definitely a must get menu item.  I actually didn't realize that Cioppino is from San Francisco, so it makes sense that the best I've ever had would be found at the oldest restaurant there. The broth was thick and flavorful and so good that I was drinking it like a soup (I normally don't do that with Cioppino - I just pick the seafood out).  It comes with garlic bread which when dipped in the broth is just divine.  There was a generous amount of seafood - clams, prawns, scallops, bay shrimp, crab meat, mussels, and white fish - all of very high quality and delicious when served in the broth.\n\nMy sister had a daily special, the mediterranean branzino sea bass, which was also delicious. Even the vegetables that it was served with were full of flavor.  It was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of flavoring to not distract from the natural flavor and quality of the fish itself.\n\nTadich Grill was the restaurant that we chose to dine at during our one night in San Francisco, and it was a great choice... fun and authentic and delicious!", "author": "Flora H."}

I am a local and a regular. I won't be rushing back. Management needs to address this kind of thing, it's not unheard of there as part of the 'ambience' of a  few of the staff. The website only invites to go orders in the 'contact us' tab so they may not be eager to hear customer feedback.

I'm also surprised someone from the restaurant responds to every negative review in a super nice, apologetic manner...he obviously wasn't there last night. It seemed like everyone working there was in a bad mood. No one was friendly (including our server), no one smiled, and we literally got yelled at for following a host to a table after we were instructed to once our full party had arrived. I would say this started us off on a bad note, and the rude attitudes of everyone made the entire experience uncomfortable. \n\nThe food was just OK, which was disappointing because they have a very exciting and extensive menu. The ambience I guess is nice if you like noisy, stuffy, and tight quarters. I definitely would not recommend for groups of four people or more and definitely not a great place for kids. This place has been around for decades and obviously has some strong appeal, because the place is always packed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-21", "description": "Cioppino is a seafood stew that typically combines Dungeness crab, fish, shrimps, scallops, clams, mussels, and squids.  The broth is tomato-based with herbs and wine in the mix.  Regarded as the signature dish of San Francisco (that's right, it's not Rice-a-Roni), there are plenty to be had this side of the bay.\n\nEstablished in 1849, Tadich Grill prides itself with its Seafood Cioppino.  Unlike most restaurants where the Dungeness crab legs are served in shells, they dish up a lazy man's version, i.e., no cracking is required because all the work has already been done in the kitchen.  They give out a good heap of crab meat on top of the stew.  Although the jumbo prawns and sea scallops helped make for a hearty bowl of cioppino, the broth didn't have much of that piquant flavor.  It was a bit lighter than my favorites over at Scoma's and Woodhouse Fish Co., but it was enjoyable nevertheless.\n\nAside from the Seafood Cioppino, the Dungeness Crab and Prawns a la Monza was another popular entr\u00e9e.  Baked in a ceramic cookware, it had shell-free crab meat and huge prawns over rice with some mushroom sauce, spices, and parmesan cheese.  Everything blended beautifully resulting in a very tasty casserole dish.\n\nTheir Clam Chowder came in two varieties - Boston and Coney Island (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tadich-grill-san-francisco?select=Vw6QzcgZU9rRoHikz-AVug).  There were plenty of clams in both, but MA won this one over NY.  The Boston variant had a richer consistency than the other which seemed to have the same broth as the cioppino.\n\nWe've also tried the Calamari Steak with Garlic Butter Sauce which was served with a side of steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  The calamari was perfectly pan fried.  It was tender with a nice crust and the garlic sauce was the perfect supplement.\n\nWith 167 years of experience, Tadich Grill is a very viable seafood option in San Francisco.  It's a Financial District icon, having been in its current location since 1967.  It's always busy with no reservations, so be prepared to wait for that taste of vintage SF...", "author": "John L."}

I love this place for great food, big portions, and a classy atmosphere without being pretentious.\nThe seats along the bar are all first-come, first-served, so that's often your best bet to be seated quickly -- I've eaten there both times I've visited.  \nThe Boston clam chowder is my favorite north of Monterey.  It's a bit peppery, but I live it.  A big bowl of that and some bread is a little slice of heaven.  Both visits, I've also split the pan-fried petrale sole with a friend.  It is a HUGE portion, served with potatoes and other mixed vegetables.  Also very good.\nI have yet to try the desserts, but the caramel sauce they ladle over the top of the bread pudding makes it tempting.  I finished last night with a cappuccino, which was lovely.\nThe one drawback is that the servers are a bit brusque, which is a bit surprising since I know the wait list to work here is long and they tend to stick around for a long time.

Ever since I set foot in the City for work, Tadich Grill was on my bucket list to try. I'm so glad I finally came in for one of their best-known dishes, the cioppino. \n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the dish was the sheer amount of portions, which were *cue Trump voice imitation* YUUUUUUUGE! They definitely don't skimp out on clams, shrimp, crab meat, scallops, and the other seafood. Also, the tomato broth is piping hot and very hearty. However, as great as the broth and the seafood are, I really loved the garlic bread that came with the stew. It was perfectly toasted, and although at first it looked to be overly saturated with garlic and olive oil, it tasted just right. Perfect complement to the tomato broth! \n\nCompared to the other cioppinos I've had, this one is the best BY FAR. Sure, it's a little expensive (I believe it was $28, excluding tip and tax), but the portions are worth it. You WILL leave full and satisfied! \n\nI'm glad I had the opportunity to dine in one of SF's oldest restaurants, even if it was for lunch.

I opt out of the mash potatoes and get a heap of the steamed vegetables instead. \n\nA larger wine list and some specials would really perk things up on the menu.  I would love to have a reason to go here other than having people in from out of town.", "author": "John S."}

I was treated to lunch here many times when I was working in SF by a manager and a colleague.  We had some family members come visit from overseas, and The Mother chose Tadich Grill for the family to congregate for lunch the day before Turkey Day. \n\nTadich Grill does not take reservations.  Tadich Grill will seat their guests once the entire party is present, there is no seating of partial parties. Our guests of honor were already at Tadich Grill when The Mother and I arrived. I opted to wait for The Sibling and The Sibling-in-Law outside as the guests and The Mother were getting anxious for them to come as they were getting hungry. We were delighted when The Sibs showed up. And we were seated in one of the booths in the back of Tadich Grill. I was aware of the booths, never ate in one. The times I used to come, we would eat at the bar or at a table. \n\nSo let's see, what did we order. We had various types of clam chowder (Boston or Coney Island) for a starter and one of us had a grand salad of lettuce and avocado with dressing on the side. The Mother and one of the relatives had petrale sole filet for their main dish. The other had a surf and turf special --a lobster tail with a skirt steak. The SIL had a lamb shank. I cannot remember what The Sibling chose.\n\nAs for me, I went with the bone-in rib eye steak served with steak frites with carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. It is go big or go home when it comes to Tadich Grill for me. And I was able to get it cooked rare. It was so good, I attacked and savored every bite of the steak like the combination of the bear and tiger I am. Damn good rib eye steak I have had in a long, long time! I wish you all could have seen The Mother roll her eyes when I announced I was having the bone-in rib eye steak. It was quite funny--priceless!\n\nWe were attended to by a grandfatherly looking server whose personality has the wicked sense of humour of one's favorite uncle. The uncle you know who has all the wicked jokes and stories up his sleeve and in his repetoire. He wore the classic white shirt and jacket off-set with a black tie, black trousers, and black shoes accompanying by the classic old school service of being professional and attentive to the clientele. He kept my water glass filled and jokingly blamed my consuming water as the reason why there is a drought. My SIL ordered a bottle of white wine and the server let them perform the duties of a sommeliere and they declared it was good. We all had some to share. \n\nHowever, we were all too stuffed to have dessert except The SIL. They ordered a baked apple with caramel sauce on the side and offered samples to us. I politely passed yet I got to sample the caramel sauce.\n\nTadich Grill has been around the days of the Gold Rush days. They have the kind of classic, elegant service that is rare these days and back in the day, my parents' generation really appreciated. And I get it. I appreciated it even more when The Mother inadvertently left behind her cap and gloves. Fortunately, they turned up and I was able to retrieve them on Black Friday.

I told him to pick, since he knows the Embarcadero area better than me. So, he took me here, an Italian restaurant that's been in business since 1849. I've never heard of Tadich Grill, so this was a pleasant surprise. Clearly, this place has been doing something right to be running for so long. The minute we walked into this old-school restaurant that had an air of understated, rustic elegance, we were seated at a table for two, and were brought iced water and a standard plate of bread and butter. Our waiter was a kind old man in a white coat, kind of grandfatherly.\n\nWe ordered the house special Australian Lobster Tail, and Seafood Saut\u00e9. I had no idea they were going to serve us the lobster tail with the shell, only to take the shell away right when it was set on the table. Dang it, there goes the pretty picture I was going to take of the lobster with its tail! The lobster was delicious, though hard to cut through, but my date and I enjoyed it very much, and I finished off the vegetables that came with the lobster after my date said he was full. The Seafood Saut\u00e9 was also very delicious, served with rice and vegetables, though somewhat heavy and creamy. Both my date and I were stuffed after finishing everything.\n\nThe bathroom is in the back of the restaurant. You have to go up the stairs, and there are a few stalls. There was no paper towels the first time I went up there, so I had to pat my hands dry on my sweater dress instead.

There are no frills or reservations and the waiters wear white and take no guff as they have been here for years.  We went here on a double date and the boys dropped us off but they didn't realize that we cannot be seated until all of us are there.  No reservations and no seating until the entire party is present.  When we finally got seated, it was getting busy which was around 5:15 pm.  Get there early before the crowd comes which is around 6 pm.  \n\nWhen the waiter came by, he pulls no punches as I was asking him about the sand dabs, which they are known for, and he said \"Wait lady, I'm going to tell you all about it\".  So we had the tasty french bread with butter and  I started off with a ginger beer, then split a crab and shrimp salad.

Delightful interior and wonderful seafood San Francisco style without pretension. We saw everyone from well dressed diners to tourists get a taste of SF to office workers getting some dinner before heading home. \n\nWe came early on a Friday evening bracing ourselves for a line. But as it turned out we were ahead of the wave and were seated right away. We had side cars and oyster on half shell appetizer, while we decided what to order for dinner. The waiter brought a quarter round of a great looking bread. I had to resist having any to save room for the main event. \n\nWe ordered the cioppino and the grilled crab cakes. The cioppino was amazing. The broth tasted of all the fish, shellfish, and tomatoes. All the fish and shellfish were cooked perfectly. It is as if they were still underdone when the dish left the kitchen and cruised to a perfect finish when it arrived. It is a filling dish, so go easy on the bread or you won't be able to finish the yummy cioppino! The grilled crab cakes are also quite delicious. Grilling is a nice change from deep frying. The crab cakes are like two fists on the plate. The side of vegetables were so so and needed to be a little warmer. The bread is really really good. Thick chewy crust and deep wonderful flavor. \n\nJust want to say again we had exceptional congenial service from David113.", "author": "Teresa F."}

Enjoy it for lunch or dinner. \n\nOn this visit, we enjoyed the Halibut Florentine (Cheese Sauce and Spinach) and the Pacific Red Snapper, pan fried with a nice Sangiovese by Halo of Napa Valley. The cheese sauce was tasty, tangy, and rich in flavor. The spinach added dimension and contrast. Both fish fillets were thick, tasty, and substantial. Imagine the normal filet, then multiply the thickness times 2. Nothing was overly seasoned. Service was informative and timely.\n\nWe recently had the opportunity to dine at the new location in Washington D.C. It was very good and reminiscent of the original grill here in San Francisco.

My husband finally took me a year ago and we had a classic, heavy lunch - fried calamari and fish and chips and cocktails. We came back again today for lunch and each ordered something we've never had at Tadich - he the ciappino and me the Dungeness crab salad with 1/2 avacado. Hands down the best ciopinno and best crab salad ever! \n\nWe watched the waiters slice freshly breaked thick loaves of sourdough bread. We appreciated the Christmas decorations. We had a cocktail (or two) and fully realized that Tadich Grill is our very own San Francisco original European Bistro. The oldest restaurant west of the Mississippi is so much more than just the amazingly fresh and delicious food. It's he atmosphere and the people watching and the professional waiters (and one waitress) who could seamlessly refill our water glasses and replace small slices of fresh butter and carve through that delicious sourdough roll in their sleep. \nI noticed a gorgeous slice of cheesecake being prepared for a table and pointed it out to my hubs. When it came time to order dessert, we ordered a slice with raspberry sauce and two Irish coffees. It was the best cheesecake we have ever had. I cannot believe we missed this before. \nThe experience was phenomenal and while there usually is a wait for bar seats, they're worth it. \nI count dining at Tadich Grill as one of the worlds great restaurant experiences (spoiler alert, Forbes does, too). The food is fresh and fabulous and the experience is worth savoring. Put down your phones and spend the time looking around, you may just find your next favorite Tadich dish.

Tadich Grill is no exception to this, but does a solid job of fulfilling any seafood cravings you may have, with speed (entrees come out impressively quickly), convenience (being centrally located and all), and variety (25 seafood-centric entrees, by my last count).\n\nSo, if you're looking for something more classic, be it pan-fried, sauteed, fried, or cheesy casserole'd with a generous buttering, give Tadich a shot. If you're looking for something a bit more highbrow (like a pan-fried black cod provencale), well, you tell me when you find a place so I can try it too!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The venue is pretty spacious, though accessibility may be difficult for some, given that the place is always packed and the spacing in between their tables is a bit on the narrow side.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-26", "description": "Have been going to Tadich's for years, and have always had a terrific meal and top notch service.  I suspect the reason that Tadich's has achieved its status as one of the oldest restaurants in the country, and the oldest in San Franciso,  is because many have experienced the same throughout the years.   Although Tadich's leans towards sea food, they have an extensive menu and offer several meat options including some old classics that harken to the early days.  With that said, I recommend going with the fresh, local sea food dishes. Start with Dungeness crab cakes which are heavy on the crab and light on the filler. Succulent, juicy and amazing.  For an entree, recommend the outstanding and consistently excellent cioppino which is loaded with Dungeness crab, fish, mussels and clams. The tomato based both complimented by garlic bread is perfect! Service is top notch offered by waiters who have been there forever and are the best in the business. \nTip: Tadich's does not take reservations, but no worries; the line moves briskly. Enjoy a nice cocktail served by some of the best barkeeps in the city at the expansive wood bar.  Can also eat dinner off the full menu at the bar if desired.  Does not take AMEX.

My mother has mobility issues and uses a collapsable walker. One of our party was stuck in traffic and even though we told them we were going to be quick diners they wouldn't let us put our name on the list until everyone arrived. They made no concessions at all. We were chill. Determined to enjoy the experience and not let all the silly rules and \"macho\" bartenders get in the way.  \nIn fairness they grabbed a small chair for her and she sat like a child below the bar getting jostled and bumped and yelled at. Didn't complain at all. Finally our daughter  arrived and now we have to wait another hour for a table.\nEventually we're shown to the table, ( no \"thanks for waiting\", \"sorry for the delay\")  I swear before my ass had even hit the seat the waiter came over and asked us what we wanted to drink...! we told him to give us a minute. Less than a minute later he comes back. What do we want to order?. Again no discussion about the menu but we go with the flow, anticipating a fantastic meal ahead so we order some Calamari and shrimp cocktail as apps for the table. he says .. \" you need to order everything now because we're busy\" \nWTF. I worked in the restaurant business for 25 years. Calling bullshit. Both me and my wife said, \"no we'll order when we're ready and we've just waited the best part of 2 hours for this table so please go away and stop hounding us\". (she was nicer than I was!)\n\n But we soldiered on.  To sum up the food: if you like massively overpriced, bland 1970's style seafood, padded out with rice and vegies then this is the place for you. I don't mind spending money on special occasions but I left pissed off that I fell for the hype and nonsense.\nBy now my mother had lost her appetite so she just had a bowl of soup. The server forgot to order my sons clam chowder so he grubbed on bread and then when it came he couldn't eat it. So it was really $300 for 3 people including drinks. Not surprisingly, there was no one waiting for our table. We will happily never set foot in there again.\nSave your cash . Don't believe the hype. There are so many superior places in SF and Oakland to eat.\n\n Update: The owner contacted me by phone and on here. Basically gently suggesting that I would alter the review. Kinda disingenuous.

When we walked in it was super crowded and people were just lining up against the wall to wait for a table. There is open bar seating and it's based on the honor system on who came first. We tried putting our name down and even that was difficult because it was just a crowd of people at the front. No waiters were around to take down names. Thankfully I stood by the wall and there were two seats open at the bar and I was able to get them since no one wanted it near me! \n\nWe sat down at the bar and our waiter gave us a very detailed old school menu. I ordered the cioppino of course and my partner ordered the crab cakes. The cioppino came piping HOT. Filled with crab, fish, scallops, shrimp, baby shrimp, clams and mussels. Even though it was around $35 for both of the dishes the cioppino was def the better of the two deals. In terms of taste, it was okaaaay. I mean the broth was tasty and it was packed with seafood! But it's one of those where you have for once and I don't think I'll ever crave for it again. Crab cakes were okay as well, nothing to rave about. The sauce on top made the dish really heavy and it came with rice and steamed vegetables. \n\nOverall, dishes were decent and I can see why you should come here for the old school vibe. I would recommend coming here at least once to experience a restaurant that's been open since 1849 but the food was decent. Not AMAZING. \n\nTip: look out for open bar seats!", "author": "Sarah I."}

When you are from out of town and ask what is a a true \"traditional, authentic San Francisco restaurant.\" , it is Tadich Grill. It's been around for 166 years. It's not only San Francisco's, but also California's, oldest restaurant. Dark wood paneling with large mirrors cover the walls and very high ceiling. I have been dinning here for over 40 years.\nWe started with a bottle of Concannon - Pinot Grigio, California, 2015. It had a citrus, crispy and fresh flavor, great with seafood.\nI ordered the Boston clam chowder. It was thick and creamy, perfectly textured potatoes, plump sweet clams with a hint of spice. I generally order tabasco sauce with my clam chowder and this is the only restaurant that I have ever been to that automatically brings it.\u00a0 It was probably some of the best clam chowder I've ever tasted!!!\nMy wife ordered the Mixed Greens Salad with blue cheese dressing. The Bleu Cheese dressing had a rich, creamy flavor and was truly delicious.\nI had the Pan Fried Petrale Sole filet and it was cooked to perfection. It is served with Long Branch Potatoes, Vegetable of the Day, and Tartar Sauce. The tarter sauce has horseradish in it, totally unique, and was delicious. Highly recommend their Petrale Sole! It's the local sole.\nMy wife ordered the Seafood Saut\u00e9 - Scallops, Prawns, and Dungeness Crab Legs saut\u00e9ed with mushrooms in a light Cream Sauce and served with rice and vegetables.(carrots, asparagus and brussels sprouts). The rich white wine cream sauce was absolutely phenomenal.

Came here on Saturday with five friends for a birthday celebration and looking forward to go back again soon! We sat in a booth, which was cozy and awesome. Wood panelling is beautiful and added to the old school charm this place has. Our meals were great -- we ordered a seafood platter, fried calamari and crab cakes to start, which were all so fresh and delicious. Many got the cioppino for their main dishes and raved about it; I'm looking forward to trying that as the weather gets cooler. I had white clam chowder soup and a crab and avocado salad. The soup was so yummy and the salad was huge, fresh and tasty! So much fresh crab and pretty much an entire avocado. Will definitely be making it into my rotation for ordering delivery for office lunches. Prices were very fair, especially for the freshness, quality and HUGE portion sizes. Staff was helpful and quick -- you could tell they've all been doing this for years. Now I see why this place is considered a SF classic; it's an institution.

Great drinks, amazing services and of course, superb food.  Other trendy, overwrought places come and go, yet Tadich remains.\n\nI used to come here pretty regularly for lunch when I was a student - it was halfway between school and work.  Fast forward six years.  I basically just told my compatriots that we were going to Tadich Grill for dinner - if you want to go some other place....God Bless.  We finished our pre-party champs and headed down California.  The warm glow of the sign beckoned to we three, hungry (slightly buzzed) ladies needing sustenance after our first day on a biz trip that started at 5:30 in the morning.  Got there around 8:30, it was pretty busy, that is to be expected.  We got lucky though and were seated immediately at the Bar, which is my jam.  I have actually never sat at a table there, now that I think about it.  Our waiter Charles came 'round quickly and it went a little something like this:\n\nDrinks:\nI had a Tito's Martini with a twist-up; Ms Angela had here usual bizarre concoction of Tito's, 7-Up and green olives; Ms Elaine had a Kir Royale.  All came out quickly and all were just as desired.\n\nFood:\nI got the Cioppino, A got the Fried Shrimp platter and E got Clams and an artichoke heart.  My Cioppino was f***in' amazing, of course.  Tender sweet scallops, handful of crab, a few mussels, a few clams, several prawns, bay shrimp and whitefish.  All cooked to perfection in the most amazing onion, celery tomato broth.  The garlic bread was heavenly and you know I ate it all.  Mmmm, I wish I had some now--oh well. :-( \nA loved her shrimp platter with the awesome potatoes and perfectly cooked veg.  Sometimes veg can be mushy, but never here.  It is called QC people, don't act like you are too good to check a piece of cauliflower before sending it.  It is the little details that make Tadich a place to keep coming to.\nE's clams were swimming in a delicious garlic, butter white wine sauce.

Our party of four met before the doors were opened. Thank goodness we did, because people actually started to line up. Given, there were a few parties only, but by the time we left, there were people waiting for tables. \n\nIt was a booze free lunch today. Which didn't even matter because the food was fantastic. The oysters in the half shell were fresh and delicious. I can't get enough of the ocean-y, brine-y goodness. I ordered the red snapper, charcoal broiled. I love red snapper, and the portion was extremely generous. I didn't try any of my friend's ravioli but that dish was dinner-sized too. He really liked it and finished the whole plate. Lastly, two people in our party ordered the cioppino. Since it's what they're known for, I have to admit that they do it very well. Most restaurants either make it too much like a tomato based red sauce, or its just too watered down with zero flavor. The broth was so rich and packed major flavor. Not to mention, they give you two slices of roasted garlic bread and a medley of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallops, white fish)- all of which is cooked to perfection. I stole a slice off of my friend's plate and annoyingly dipped my slice of garlic bread in my boyfriend's cioppino. Even the white fish was flaky and surprisingly buttery. Ok, I just had dinner but it's making me hungry as I sit here and write this review. \n\nThe service was excellent, pairing nicely with the food. We all really loved the wooden dividers that created what were mini dining rooms for each party. Super cozy and private so that you could really unwind. My favorite thing wasn't just that, or the fresh cut lemon wedges at the table, but the coat hooks!! Our table for four had one in each corner of the mini dining room!

Tickets for 4 to see Wicked in SF and I was tasked with finding the restaurant for our pre show meal. I picked a hands down winner. Our meals were great! Service was spot on, and I picked the perfect place that had something for everyone in our party. Cocktails were expertly prepared. Decent wine list, but being from wine country we brought our own. Reasonable 20 dollar corkage for SF, and they provided great wine service for the fee.\nImpressive, yet unobtrusive service was a major plus.

Fabled for having been in business for such a long time, and for churlish service. \n\nThe quality of food is variable.  I had an excellent cioppino, full of goodies with a very tasty broth.  My partner had a Petrale sole that was overcooked and tasteless.\n\nThe service, however, is badly in need of some supervision and revision. It lived down to its reputation, and was uniformly poor. There is no excuse, especially when there is hardly anyone in the place (we went for a late lunch) for sullen, inattentive, argumentative and rude service.  I don't expect a waiter to be omnipresent, but I definitely expect professional service which requires that the server constantly keep an eye on the customers (not be off somewhere else for long stretches of time), and be aware that when they are sitting looking around for the waiter it means they need some attention.  The service was of the worst sort:  snooty, snotty, and very unprofessional indeed.  It made eating there a chore rather than a pleasure.  Tadich Grill needs a forceful reminder that it is the customer ithat pays the bills, not the staff.  Not recommended.", "author": "Jeff D."}

I understand that it is an SF institution and one of the oldest restaurants around but I was so underwhelmed when I came here earlier this week.\n\nI did like the interior and the feel of the place. It felt very old school and it struck the right level of class mixed with nightlife. The service here was atrocious but whatever I can understand that.\n\nI came here for the Cioppino, which made the top 100 list both this year and last year. Why it is on the list is beyond me. While I'm not the biggest fan of Cioppino, I have had much better versions of this dish at many other places. Everything about this dish was average from the sauce to the seafood to the garlic bread. The only thing not average about it was the price at a whopping $32. At the very least it needed more salt but it could certainly stand for improvement in other areas as well.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure this place is skating by on reputation.

The crowd leaned toward older generation but it was not a surprise to me given the price and history of the venue. The menu is quite diverse although it seems heavy on seafood dishes. \n\nWe started our meal with their soups. My clam chowder creamy style was rich and thick with tons of clams. For entree, I tried their famous Cioppino, which is a tomato wine broth based seafood mixture stew. It came with mussels, clams, sea scallops, shrimps and huge chunk of fish fillet. I was really full before the Cioppino even arrived! Nevertheless, I tasted it and the soup was savory and clean. Seafood inside was very fresh and there was no fishy smell. It also came with two heavily buttered toasted sour dough. \n\nOverall, I had a great experience here and loved their seafood dishes. I also saw people ordered steak and other things.

Like I accused him of making it himself.  I mentioned it to him because its his job to take that feedback to the chef.  He has an arrogance about him that I didn't really care for.\n\nThe Pork Chop was tough and not very flavorful.  Very disappointing.  The Crab was over powered by the tomato sauce.  Both those dishes are 1 Star so don't get them.\n\nI was happy with my Rib-Eye and they should have just ordered the Cioppino as we found out later on, it was what they're known for.  \n\nPrepare to wait.  We waited 2.5 hours for a table of 6 however, the bartenders were AWESOME!!!  Loved them.  Drinks were a bit weak but oh well.  \n\nOverall, I will not intentionally go here.  They're mostly hype and not worth the wait.

She didn't say a word, not even responding to my \"thank you\" after she sat us down. It is tough to make the argument  that both of these employees were having a bad day.  The experience certainly didn't live up to the 4-star Yelp reviews, the recommendation, or the check we got.\n\nTypically I would have been a lot more vocal and descriptive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-26", "description": "Amazing Food - more than food, Amazing Service! The staff's attitude speaks of their legacy.  Their's is the kind of service and food one may find at an old classy restaurant in New York or England, where folks don't just do a job, but take pride in serving their customers and making them feel special. It has often been written that the passion of an artist is found deep within the soul, separating those who settle for the mediocre or the good, from those compelled to provide greatness and seek perfection. Such skills could be applied to serving food, an ancient ritual in all cultural traditions. I am not a senior citizen, however, well aware of history and the classy bygone era. Back in the old times, the notion of being \"in service\" to someone was held in high regard, with initiations and teachings maintained as a special privilege until perfected - that is exactly what this restaurant is like if you want to get an idea about how it feels to dine here.\n\nTadich Grill's food, demeanor, service and attitude reminds me of this Chinese saying: \"\"Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water\" -  It means (loosely translated), take great care and deep satisfaction with awareness and appreciation, in whatever you do; for the simple act of doing it is reward enough, and alone, can bring great transformation and joy. Great service is a subtle art form and Tadich Grill has done a splendid job! It is indeed an honor and a privilege to dine here.", "author": "Sun B."}

I guess if you are by yourself, you are a lesser human being. \n\nSo, I voted with my feet, turned around and left. Certainly won't be bringing anyone over here again.

Tadich Grill was close by, so walked on over.\n\nWe arrived around 2:30 on a Saturday and were seated immediately. We got our own little \"room\", which was very nice. We were off to a good start.\n\nThe waiter arrived quickly, but we weren't ready. We were a bit confused by the wine menu and hadn't made a decision. The wine menu lists 99% full bottles along with two half-bottles. We noticed a $20 corkage fee at the bottom and wondered if we purchased a bottle of wine if we would be charged the fee. At the bottom of the wine menu it stated some wines were available by the glass and to ask the server. We found out the fee didn't apply to bottles purchased at the restaurant and learned which wines were available by the glass. We were able to make a decision. Yay!\n\nThe sourdough bread was delicious, but the butter was cold and hard, thus hard to spread. What made it more difficult was none of us had a plate for the bread. We placed the bread on the tablecloth, buttered it up and ate it off the table. Weird. The waiter brought additional bread on a plate. He thrust the plate toward the plate of bread already on the table and fwap! it landed on the plate. That lacked class and was not the behavior I expect at a restaurant where the average meal is over $30. \n\nI ordered the seafood cioppino. I had the most incredible cioppino at Boudin Bakery and have been looking for another good one ever since. This was not it. While wonderful seafood was listed on the menu, it was not listed like ingredients are listed on a package (by weight/quantity). Instead the ingredients were listed by tastiness... you know, things you WANT in your cioppino - clams, prawns, scallops, bay shrimp, crab meat, mussels and white fish. This serving had two clams, two mussels, one scallop, two prawns, super mini shrimp (bay shrimp?) and a LOT of white fish. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but it was not worth the price. \n\nMy dining partners both got the grilled patrale. I took a bite. It tasted burnt. Neither of them cleaned their plates. \n\nOur meals were certainly not the quality one expects for the price.", "author": "Scott N."}

The 1 star is for the service of this place or so called ESTABLISHMENT.\n\nA few weeks backs a friend of mine visiting from NY and called me out of the blue to meet up for lunch at @ 1:15 pm. I was already done with my lunch but I did oblige and told him that I will take him to a nice place. \n\nBased on the reviews and some research I picked up Tadich Grill. First time and probably the last time for both of us. We get seated and within a couple of mins the server came to ask if we were ready to order. We asked for a few mins and asked him to get the water. As soon as the water came in the server came back to check if we were ready. I told him that I would go for a coffee and my friend ordered from the Daily Special the Mediterranean Sea Bass or a Salmon. So far so good.. But NO and this is the FIRST FOR ME......  The server told me that I cannot order just coffee and need to order something to eat else we cannot be in the restaurant. \n\nAlready in the restaurant, seated and  I really did not want to get up and leave, so I went ahead and ordered a plate of Fries. The server finally left the table with our order.\n\nThe food to follow was OK.. wouldnt rate it highly. I am rating it purely on the looks, since I did not eat the fish and probably just had a couple of fries.. Never the less, I have probably seen the last of this Establishment, thanks to the attitude they carry.\n\nAll the Best to all who visit this place.

No fancy-dancy tricks here, just good ol' strong and straightforward drinks. The Boston Clam Chowder was a nice surprise, and worked well with the unlimited bread (love that!). Super rich, creamy, and full of clams. We also ordered the Blue Point Oysters Rockefeller (again, touristy things), which were delicious and baked/broiled to perfection.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Mesquite Charcoal Broiled Petrale Sole Filet and the Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread. The Sole Filet was another item cooked to perfection, and my friend described the potatoes as \"pretty outrageously delicious.\" Also, I can see why the Cioppino was a house special. So much seafood in that thing! And it had a clean taste to it, to counterbalance the heavier Boston Clam Chowder we had earlier.\n\nOur waiter was entertaining and recommended some pretty good food and drinks.

It's the oldest restaurant in SF and it doesn't seem to have aged at all. Part of the charm of the place is the fact that they maintain the booths and bar service - a good 'ol businessman's lunch place, in and out with minimal fuss. Servers still wear white coats and check in with you frequently but with no stuffiness or airs - just no nonsense. The food is good but not great but you don't come here just for the food. \n\nI sat at the bar with a friend and ordered the hangtown fry. A little pricey for brunch but the serving of eggs with chunks of bacon and large oysters (plus bread) was enough for two lunches for me which made it seem not bad value. The eggs/bacon/oyster were tasty - possibly an SF classic - not I'm not sure I would call it amazing. Decent. Served up the way it's always been (this is not a flash place).

The restaurant has booths along one side with a huge long bar on the other side. A copper pipe divides the bar into a bar vs food service, so if you want to eat at the bar aim for a seat past that bar. They will not serve food in the \"bar\" section. Their drinks are great and the wait-staff, all mature men who are experienced, fast and efficient will remind you of how the place must have been 100 years ago, when the purpose was to come and eat. The menu features seafood every which way - I loved my bay shrimp and tomato salad and hubby enjoyed his mixed greens. Dressing was served on the said, along with a tub of the best tartar sauce for hubby's sole. I had the Chilean Sea Bass (I know I know not very environmentally friendly but hey, I didn't have kids so I'm allowed). The Chilean Sea Bass (not really Chilean Sea bass but that is another story) was mild, well cooked and broiled to perfection!

However, we moved out of the area 33 years ago and it has been that long since we dined at Tadich. On this trip to California we looked forward to visiting one of our all time favorites. How did it turn out? Mixed.\nIn the \"old days\" they served the house wines in water glasses for one dollar per glass. We knew the $1 was long gone but amused to discover so were the water glasses. Our waiter says they introduced wine glasses about 30 years ago. That's just a fraction of the time that Tadich Grill has been in existence as it dates back to the gold rush days of 1849.\nOtherwise, very little has changed. As no reservations are taken, one signs in upon arrival, fights their way to the bar and drinks standing until a seat opens at the bar. One can order food at the bar if they choose not to wait for a table. Part of the fun of the place is one can have fun conversations with locals or tourists during the 30 to 45 minute wait. Tonight we had a great time talking with two local male millennials until they departed and then we took their stools. Our places were immediately taken by three visitors from Sweden: father, son and fifteen year old grandson who were enjoying a three week holiday. What fun we had listening to what fun they were having on their trip.\nAt this point,we would have given Tadich a rating of 5. Then we were seated at a table and ordered dinner.\nMy wife ordered sea bass because the Swedes were returning because they had really enjoyed the sea bass the previous evening. When served, she found her food warm but not hot. She also thought the sea bass was less well seasoned than that which she does at home.\nI had pan saut\u00e9ed rockfish with mixed vegetables and cottage fries. The fish was served with a bland tartar sauce. The fries were hot. The fish was warm. The veggies were well cooked but cold. My wife had the very same veggies (broccoli, carrots, zucchini, etc.) but hers were warm. The best rating we can give the food is 3 and for the overall rating a 3.5 or 4.", "author": "Joe S."}

My pants have juice splattered on my knee (now that takes a lot of juice to hit a knee under a bar - it must have hit my face first and fallen). My wife's face, her dress was soaked. Our half-eaten food. In and on our wine glasses. On our napkins - which only made the matter worse. Just a disaster.  It looked like we witnessed an ax murder!\n\nAfter asking for the manager expecting top notch service/resolution - Tim Scully - the evening manager flew by, TOSSED two cards next to our plates, and said he'd \"cover the dry-cleaning.\" and flew on along WITHOUT ANY COMPASSION! Really not ANY!  There was no - \"I'm so sorry.\" No offer to replace the ruined food. No offer to replace a Faconnable shirt or the designer dress my wife was wearing. No, let me treat you to a dessert or another cocktail. No engagement to find out what we would need to have a better evening - nothing! \n\nThomas tried to have Tim return, but I couldn't even look at him. I believe I said, \"Don't even think about approaching me after that.\" We paid and left - after upending our ruined bottle of wine across the bar service.\n\nAfter sending a note to the manager the next day - not one response. What absolutely terrible service from the leadership! I've always been proud of this place - and I was ashamed to have brought my wife - a Master of Wine to dinner here. I will never return.

We arrived at about 6 p.m. before the impending crowds. We were graciously seated as soon as we arrived.\n\nFor starters, we had a Caesar salad and cup of clam chowder. Although the Caesar could've been slightly more fishy with the mandatory anchovies, the chowder was perfect. Steaming hot and seasoned well. I enjoyed it, and so did my partner.\n\nFor the mains, we enjoyed the Turbot Stuffed with Crab and Bay Shrimp a la Newburg, Rice, and Fried Seafood Plate (Oysters, Scallops, Prawns\rand Calamari). The turbot hit the spot -- perfectly creamy enough and a more than satisfactory amount of the tasty white fish. Turbot is such a delicate fish and Tadich knows precisely how to prepare it. And the crab and bay shrimp -- well, that makes my mouth water just writing about it and remembering the divinity of it all. As for the fried seafood plate, a cheat day for sure. It's pretty hard to go wrong with anything deep fried. The accompanying tartar sauce and cocktail sauce complement the fried goodness quite well.

I had the bone-in ribeye for my entree, and my mom had a whole fish (branzino i think). She was a little turned off, as the fish came fully intact, bones at all, but that kind of sitch doesnt bother me! My rib eye was perfection, ALMOST too much to finish, but don't worry, I did. \n\nMy mom had been to tadich 25 years ago with my dad, so it brought back a ton of memories for her. The place has a fun history and ide recommend it to anyone visiting SF who wants a taste of history!", "author": "Caitlin O."}

It's a busy place with long-established rules. We stopped in on a Thursday night recently, and I put our name down before we had all arrived. Almost an hour ater (!) when the last straggler finally got through the traffic we were seated immediately (and there were plenty of people still waiting to be seated). Service was very good, our server was very professional: quick, accurate and jovial.\n\nCocktails were good and strong. I had a Manhatten that took the edge right off that hour-long wait. \n\nThe house specialty Cioppino is delicious here, and when you're done with that giant bowl of clams, mussels, fish chunks, and scallops in a thick tasty tomato base you can dip that decadent garlic bread in the broth until you can't eat another bite. Then take the leftovers home, because that's how big the cioppino is (for me anyway). \n\nCrab cakes were loaded with crab and not too much filler (breadcrumbs, I guess), and were crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. They were generously-sized as well---about 2\" thick and 3-4\" across.\n\nOysters Rockefeller are topped with cream spinach and parmesan and then popped under the broiler till everything is nice and bubbly. An order comes with 6 oysters, plenty for a table of 4 as an appetizer.\n\nThe 4 of us had 2 servings of creamed spinach for side orders because that's how much we love our greens braised with cream, onions and garlic.\n\nThe steamed vegetables that come on the side are nothing to rave about but at least they balance out the butter and cream (if you're ordering like we did anyway...but it's very possible to get your seafood without all the extra goodness if you want).\n\nOne point off for the crazy prices (Cioppino was $33!) and for the noise level. I think they need to put some sound dampening panels in the ceiling.", "author": "Annabelle S."}

You can visit a number of institutions in SF, and it still has the same atmosphere as it did ten, twenty, thirty, forty years ago. Exhibit 1 is Tadich Grill - an ageless restaurant in the city.  The waiters dress in classic white.  Quick, speedy service.  Drinks are made to order - strong.  There's no fussing around here. No hoity toity-ness.  Tadich reminds of a time when food was simpler.  Big prawn cocktails.  Clam chowder.  Garlic bread.  There are no fusion, deconstructed aiolis here.  Just great hearty food. \n\nYou have to try the cioppino.  No exceptions.  Plentiful amounts of seafood (mussels, shrimp, fish, etc.).  A robust, hearty tomato broth.  Two slices of crunchy garlic bread to soak up the juices.  It's heaven in a big bowl.  I recommend ordering the plain pasta if you like eating it with your cioppino. I also enjoyed the clam chowder (order a bowl and have it split in two); The prawn cocktails were delicious. \n\nI had no expectations when I visited, and I enjoyed my time here thoroughly.  Along with House of Prime Rib, Tadich Grill belongs in the City's pantheon of timeless restaurants.", "author": "Huy D."}

Given that we paid about 50 bucks each for three people, I didn't feel like we got the bang for our buck. I do like the fact that I can say I've been to the \"oldest restaurant in SF\" though. Now onto the food!!\n\nClam Chowder [2 stars] - my friend said that this was the best he's ever had. I say it was okay, decent maybe. It was maybe a notch below average, I know I've had better clam chowder before (like in Monterrey Bay). They didn't give a lotta clams but for $8.50, it was a decent size to share between two people as an appetizer. It could even be a lunch entree!\n\nOysters Rockfeller [1 star] - not worth the money. For $20.95, you'd think it'd taste a little more flavorful but it was just a glob of cheese with some baked spinach over fishy oysters. Biggest disappointment of the night as it's one of their more popular/famous dishes. Not worth it. :'( I know you're sad too.\n\nCalamari Steak [4 stars] - really good! I actually liked this the most outta our whole meal. If I went back, I'd get this considering it's just a huge piece of calamari beaten down and fried to perfection with some light garlic butter sauce on top. It came with brocolini and garden carrots as well. Yum!\n\nSeafood Ciopinno [4 stars] - pretty good as well. I am fan of seafood and tomato broth and soup so this was a great combination. At $31.95 a pop, it does fill you up. I ate perhaps 1/8 of it and called it quits though because I was so full from everything else. Big shrimp, big scallops and big clams with two slices of garlic bread. How can you go wrong?\n\nMy other friend ordered a charcoal grilled fish but I didn't have a taste so not sure if it was good or not. It looked decent and he gobbled it down with no comments so can't tell if it's a plus or minus!\n\nEither way, I'd def. order only the last two items I reviewed (calamari and ciopinoo) if I were to recommend it to anyone. I think it gets pretty full on the weekdays, even on a Monday at 5:30PM so be sure to have your full party present or else you'd have to wait in line.

Plus, the tons of people waiting were nothing more than a handful. We proceeded to go to the manager to inform him and he was incredibly unhelpful. Food is good to mediocre, expensive and service is HORRIBLE! Beware of this place!!   David, your response from last night... thank you for your response. However, you are mistaken with your time line of events. I will admit I was on the phone at the Beginning of Supper and before we ordered only!!! I have 3 young kids who I wanted to FaceTime prior to their bedtime and something I will not apologize for. Giving our waiter the benefit of the doubt, it was literally 2 min after we received our bill and he received his tip that  he pushed us out the door.  Also, he had a huge chip on his shoulder throughout dinner and couldn't have been less helpful. For example, when we asked him the difference between white or red clam chowder, he wouldn't elaborate and acted like we were an inconvenience to his \"time.\" As a pharmacy manager and one that likes to back my employees, I understand the want to do this. However, this is not the time! He was rude, short and \"annoyed \" with us from the moment we sat down. If you continue to back these kinds of employees, your business will go under.

Tadich Grill has been slinging seafood for over 166 years... that's a lot of years, so they must be doing something right.\n\nWe went at about 6:45pm as a party of 5 on a Monday night and had no problem getting a table. This place is old school. No reservations, your whole party must be present to be seated, older servers type place.\n\nThis place runs the gamut on menu items. From bacon and eggs, to steak to seafood, the last which seems to be the star of the show. Known for their cioppino, I of course had to order as a recent Bay area transplant. It didn't disappoint. Not a cheap meal, priced at about $34/35 it was chock full of seafood. A hearty portion of white fish, ginormous shrimps (3), mussels, clams and small bay fish in a not so salty, subtly flavored broth. This was accompanied by 2 large, salty pieces of garlic bread to soak up the rich flavors of broth. It was really good! A little pricy for what it was, but I wasn't paying so ::shrug::.\n\nThe guy had the shrimp and crab in a casserole and it was also good, although I preferred the cioppino. Service was solid in the old school manner. Free bread is always delicious; not the best, but a nice option to have. Far from trendy, but satisfying nonetheless and a definite San Francisco staple; a great spot for seafood and to feel like a tourist or at least taste a bit of old San Francisco", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

He comes back trying to apologize saying the chef gave me the dish of sauce to show the curry sauce. Wtf?!   I know this dish is white. He brings a white sauce w mushrooms and says this is the sauce. I say yes. But what do you know ? My dish comes back w same sauce mixed w the white. It's still curry. Waiter says when were you here last ? This is the new chef. No thank you. $38 entree was crap. I took it to go. It's not the waiters fault. Smelled bad under my desk. I asked receptionist who has cats doesn't this smell like dried cat food a little ?   Oh yes.

The bar is long so there should be seats avaialable. I sat down somewhere in the middle of the bar between two couples. \n\nI ordered a pinot grigio to start with to go with my cioppino, which if you don't know what it is, it's a tomato based stew with a ton of seafood. Tadich Grill's has clams, mussels, scallops, many different types of fish, and some shrimp. They gave bread with the dish, but they really should give a lot more. I like sopping up the stew part of it with the bread. I did have some leftovers - probably about a third of the left and having it two days later, it was still super delicious. \n\nProtip: Get the cioppino, it's pretty good.

We looked forward to this culinary experience to visit a staple in San Francisco, a place highly recommended by our attorney friends and all went down the drain due to our BOLD waiter...\n\nOur visit was on Saturday 3/11/2017 and we were pleasantly surprised to get seated shortly upon arrival. We were greeted by a very welcoming gentleman who seemed to be one of the bartenders. Our table was on the left side, walking in, next to the kitchen. The pleasant flavors from the kitchen were unbelievable. Our arrogant and unpleasant waiter was a BOLD gentleman that went out of his way to cause the unpleasant experience. The water arrived to our table after asking four times for it. He did NOT recommend any items, offered NO specials of the day nor showed any respect to us. Took only 10 seconds all together to take our order during which time he yelled at someone across the restaurant and disappeared as we were telling him what we wanted, and reappeared from another side to continue and finish his 10 second order taking. \n\nFood was good and if this BOLD waiter would have had a different attitude, we could have even enjoy it. He avoided our table during the course of our stay with the exception when he dumped the food to us four, of course at different times, and the bill.

I guess I've never been all that motivated, especially since they don't accept reservations, and frankly none of my friends and colleagues ever mention it as a place they've ever wanted to try. I remember there were work lunches and dinners scheduled there over the years, but for one reason or another, I bagged it or suggested some other place that was higher on my wish list. But last week, I decided I should give it a try since it was in the middle of the afternoon well after the lunch rush. I was in meeting hell at work until about 2:30PM and decided I needed to get out of the building.\n\nI was sincerely thinking of getting a sandwich at Andersen Bakery across California when it struck me that Tadich would likely be empty at that hour. I was right. Except for a couple of lady barflies near the entrance, there was nary a diner at what turned out to be the full dining counter that dominates the long space. You could almost smell the long history in the place filled as it is with rich dark woods, faded mustard walls, and a brass railing that separates the bar from the dining counter (photo: http://bit.ly/1emSaVF). There were quite a few waiters flitting about all looking like old-school veterans uniformed in ties and white linen jackets. The highly traditional menu is dominated by seafood, but you can get meats prepared on their charcoal broiler if you are feeling more carnivorous.\n\nI heard their $31.25 Seafood Cioppino with Garlic Bread is their house specialty as well as their $23.95 Pan-Fried Sand Dabs with Steak Fries. Neither appealed to me at that hour since they struck me as filling and probably a bit messy. I was drawn to the $30.95 Poached Wild King Salmon Filet with Chopped Egg Sauce because it sounded like it could be a comparatively healthier dish (photo: http://bit.ly/16WzPvz). Not really. The thick egg sauce was ladled quite liberally on the salmon which I have to admit was a hearty portion and quite fresh-tasting. It came with boiled potatoes and a bevy of steamed vegetables - broccoli and cauliflower florets, baby carrots and diced tomatoes. It was nothing too excited but certainly good enough for an undiscriminating palate.\n\nUnderstand this was on top of a large hunk of sourdough bread and a constant replenishment of frozen butter pats (photo: http://bit.ly/16o29XN). However, this didn't deter me from ordering the $6.95 dish of Tadich Rice Custard Pudding (photo: http://bit.ly/13zCn4l). This was a rather disappointing wedge of blandness with the right consistency but lacking any distinctive flavor even with a spritz of whipped cream on the side. I have to say my virginal visit to the city's oldest restaurant was not an earth-shattering culinary experience, but somehow I knew that would be the case. Unlike Swan Oyster Depot, which turned out to be a true revelation, this one I can simply check off been-there-done-that my list.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...big portions but prices are on the absurd side and while quality is good, execution is downright boring\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...as old school as old school can be\nSERVICE - 4 stars...definitely attentive from waiters who live up to their own standard\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if you need a traditional SF seafood dining experience, then hop on the California Street cable car and go to Swan Oyster Depot...leave Tadich Grill to the Fodors-dependent foreign tourists", "author": "Ed U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-24", "description": "I wanted to hate Tadich Grill. \n\n1) SF institution = boring, uninspiring dishes. \n2) Tourist trap. Fanny pack time!\n3) Overpriced food. Lettuce and avocado for $9?!?!\n4) Rude waiters. \n5) No reservations. An hour wait on a Tuesday night?!\n\nBut looking at the cougar with fake tits that doubled as her chin rest while waiting for our table was surely entertaining. \n\nAs the oldest restaurant in SF, Tadich Grill caters to tourists and nearby FiDi business peeps. Most SFers know better than to go to tourist traps like this and/or to the pier for seafood but sometimes curiousity kills. Some people (Iike moi) wanted to know how Tadich Grill has survived for so long. Short answer: Tourists. Duh. \n\nThe menu is overwhelming and prices are not posted on their online menu; I'm guessing to not deter people. Entree prices ranged from $19.95 to $49.95 with most in the high $20s to mid $30s. Not too bad and expected given the area. See my menu pics for prices. \n\nFinding metered street parking is easy before 6 pm; both weekdays and weekends. Most are yellow meters though so don't leave your car till 6 pm. Valet is $10. \n\nAside from all the preconceived notions, I kind of enjoyed dinner at Tadich Grill (this would have been a 3.5 star review had the mishap didn't occur). Some of the food was good but not great and definitely overrated. \n\nJose, our awesome busboy made up for our rude waiter who gave us \"the hand\" when trying to flag him down to order. Oh no he di'int! Yes, he did! Rudeness seems to be one of the qualifications to be a waiter here so beware. \n\nLike Steve Urkel, I had cheese on my mind when I suggested the Oysters Rockerfeller (6 pieces -$20.95) for our shared appetizer: http://bit.ly/1bhNrIz. I was salivating upon the arrival of the bubbling platter. The ooooey gooey spinach cheese concoction was ridiculously good but the oysters were so tiny it was like trying to find a needle in the haystack. \n\nWe also shared a salad but don't bother ordering one as they're a very poor value. Our boring Shrimp Louie Salad ($24.95) reminded me of Garden Club's which is a favorite of the AARP community: http://bit.ly/15Jp8fD.\n\nWith all the mixed reviews, I decided to play it safe and order their signature dish: The Cioppino ($31.25):  http://bit.ly/15JpjHK. Tadich Grill claims to have the best one...\"anywhere\". That may have been true a century ago but today as the city with the most restaurants per a capita, I can name a handful of restaurants in SF that make a better cioppino (Anchor Oyster Bar and Sotto Mare are my top two favs). Don't get me wrong, it was good but certainly not worth the wait. \n\nServed steaming hot (I burned my tongue), the Cioppino had an array of prawns, clams, mussels, crab meat and white fish. The fish and crab were perfectly cooked but the prawns were dry and the clams had sand in it. Dunking the hot, crusty buttery garlic bread into the herbaceous tomato broth was the best part of my meal. \n\nHowever, what I found odd were the mussels. Most were closed:  http://bit.ly/1bhOtEo. But I figured, hey, these guys have been doing this for over 160 years so the chef would have tossed them if they weren't good right? So I pried one open and ate it. Stupid me...\n\nBAD. BAD. BAD IDEA. \n\nTwo hours later, I was pissing out of my ass. I woke up at 5 am and continued to piss out of my ass. \n\nTadich Grill, I officially hate you and so does my ass.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

When we arrived, people were waiting in a crowd at the front of the restaurant. The host yelled unceremoniously and somewhat impatiently for parties to follow him when a table was available. The atmosphere was so-so, though I understand that it is a crowded and old-school restaurant. Once seated, our waiter was quite snarky and rude. The most horrifying moment of my night was when the waiter insisted on grabbing a bib out of my hand and tying it around my neck without so much as a \"May I?\". First of all, I am a grown adult and the concept that a stranger can decide for me that I might need a bib to eat my food is insulting. Second of all, he showed a complete disregard for personal space or social cues. He also spoke to me in a rather condescending manner (though I'm sure it was supposed to be \"charming\", I did not perceive it to be at all whatsoever).

Their Cioppino is rich in flavor with a nice balance of tomato and spice. There's a LOT of seafood in the dish. There were two mussels, four clams, four shrimp, scallops, baby shrimps, and crab meat. On they side they serve garlic bread, which is great to dip into the Cioppino. The scallops and the Petrale Sole Filet entrees were flavorful too, but the textures weren't on point this time. The sear on the Petrale Sole was well-done on one side, but missing on the other and then the scallops were a bit rubbery from being overcooked. Other than the textures, it was tasty.

The waiter said the chef could whip me up some pasta with marinara sauce, so I took it without questioning the cost. The pasta itself was overcooked, but I'm willing to forgive that because this really isn't their specialty.

Tadich Grill is an SF institution and I must say it's actually quite larger inside than I thought.  They don't take reservations, but my co-worker and I were lucky the other week when we dropped in we were able to get a table on a Wednesday around 1:30.  Though it was towards the end of the lunch rush, many tables were still occupied.  \n\nTheir menu is very extensive.  Though they are known for the cioppino, I have a sometimes like hate relationship with clams, and it just sounded a little messy.  I was torn between a crab and prawns casserole, a crab, scallop and prawns dish or the crab cakes.  So, I asked the waiter his suggestion and he suggested the crab cakes and so I did.  Bread came out shortly before our dishes came out.  The crab cakes were huge and served with some sauce with capers and alongside some rice pilaf and steamed veggies.  I wish the menu actually provided descriptions with the dishes!  The sauce was fine, but I felt like perhaps should have been to the side, it didn't take away from the dish, but only added a little bit of creamy/tartness to the crab cakes.  Though the crab cakes were huge, they had some fillers such as breadcrumbs and shrimps in there.  It was still satisfying, but not one of the best I've had, especially for over $30 for the plate.  Rice pilaf was good but standard, same with the veggies.  My coworker always gets some sort of salmon plate and so she did.  She enjoyed it.  \n\nI can definitely knock off Tadich Grill on my SF dining bucket list.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, though again, the crab cakes were fine, but I expected more for the money and more due to the hype.  Would I go back?

Also with the flavor of the cake - combating the cream they added on top - combating the sauce on the bottom - it was too much. I ended up mixing the cake and hashbrown together and that was very smart!\n\nFor dessert, I ordered bread pudding but they don't have ice cream so I took it to go. I had ice cream at home. That was pretty good but I've had better.\n\nAll in All it was ok but not good enough to come back unless I want hashbrowns for dinner that  I'll end up seasoning myself.", "author": "Jazmyn W."}

When we would ask if he recommended X or Y, he confidently told us and it would be great. We started with the amazing smoked trout. I wish I had a bowlful for myself. The sourdough bread they bring to the table was decent. I had the saut\u00e9ed scallops & yummmmm. The wine cream sauce they make is a great additional to the perfectly done scallops. The dish came with rice & veggies. My friends each had a fish and really enjoyed their meals. For dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan pie (I think) and it was decadent.

Tadich serves Dungeness crab 10 different ways and the cioppino is a fabulous, authentic SF staple full of scallops, mussels, bay shrimp, prawns and fish.\n\nThe wine selection is decent and corkage runs $25/bottle, which is a bit pricey but not the worst corkage fee that I've seen in the city.\n\nIf you are visiting SF, make sure to stop in at Tadich for a meal then stroll  20 minutes down to the Buena Vista for an Irish Coffee.

It is a quintessential SF experience.\n\nFor the people who say service here isn't good, I have no idea what you're talking about. The only thing I can say for sure that takes this place down a star is the price of dishes. Otherwise, the seafood is incredibly fresh, and the service is speedy. Bartenders have a huge swatch of space to cover, but they do it with incredible speed, and they're constantly checking bar and table space so that they can call out what's available. They'll make your drink as soon as you order it and plough on to the next person. This place is honestly serving some amazingly fresh seafood and heavy-handed drinks. I can't ask for more. Yeah, you're going to have to wait a while for an actual table, but bar space is pretty easily attainable if you're alone/with one other person.

My husband and I are pretty chill when it comes to a server being busy or taking on too many tables but this wasn't the case. Barry gave us nothing more than buffet style of serving he took our orders, tossed our spoons on the table for the clam chowder, never asked how anything was, openly admitted to other customers at the bar how he's grouchy today. I mean, I worked at Applebee's for 6 years and you learn better table-side manners/ placement etiquette than that. Even then a server has to check-out their emotions at the door to serve $2 mozzarella sticks to a bunch of drunks. \n\nVisit: It was our first time going to Tadich grill and we were both really exciting. We heard such great reviews of the restaurant from my father who had such fond memories of it growing up at a child. The restaurant was very clean and the aesthetics were on point. \n\nFood: we ordered the two \"fresh\" glasses of orange juice that were not fresh at all. The juice was incredibly acidic and you'll find better fresh squeezed at a Mexican burrito joint. It wasn't worth the $5 each glass. \n\nAppetizers: we ordered the Coney Island clam chowder.

The server was actually quite amiable - up until the moment when we gave her a tip. At this point she very abruptly shifted and refused to even refill our waters, insisting that we leave immediately. Even when we tried to explain that we'd ordered a pretty significant amount for a celebratory dinner (3 courses, two rounds of cocktails, nice bottle of wine, dessert), and neglected to mention that we had left a sizable tip just five minutes before, she turned it on us.  With experience in the restaurant industry, I can truly say I've never seen such hostility from a restaurant employee.  Perhaps that's the mood of this place, but it's disappointing to look back on what WAS an enjoyable evening with such negative vibes.", "author": "Patrick M."}

For example, two people told the prior waiter it was a birthday night and to bring cake with the bill, one reminding the waiter after the meal was done.  The birthday cake never arrived so the culminating surprise ended with me leaving zero tip for the first time in 30 years after a night of bad service.   And when I told the waitress I left zero tip, as I should  as everyone needs to know why and I should not just sneak out,  she brought over a second waiter and they went off on me in front of my dinner party.

I asked a friend who was from the area for some restaurant recommendations. One of his suggestions was to go to Tadich Grill and have the cioppino. I ate at a lot of good restaurants, but there was only one I vowed I would return to if I was ever in San Fran again, Tadich Grill. \n\nForward two years to the present, I am in San Fran on a business trip. I discover to my delight my hotel is on California Ave, the same street as Tadich Grill. So here I am, sitting at the long counter, with drool running down my chin as I wait for my cioppino to arrive. \n\nIt's just as good as I remember. \n\nThe dish is LOADED with seafood. Prawns (shrimp to those of you on the East Coast), mussels, clams, scallops, crab, white fish, and what they call \"bay shrimp\"-- teeny tiny shrimp the size of your pinkie nail--all in a slightly sweet, perfectly salted, and mildly spicy tomato broth. There is also a fair share of onions, celery, parsley, and lots of large chunks of tomato floating around in there. If that wasn't enough, it's served with two pieces of garlic bread on the side. Which, when dipped in the broth, become sponges full of yumminess. And, it's served to you piping hot.\n\nIf I ever have the pleasure of visiting San Francisco a third time, Tadich Grill will be the first restaurant I step foot in. I won't even have to look at the menu. When the waiter takes my order, I'll just say, \"I'll have the cioppino\".", "author": "Steve N."}

This year we decided to get there early (5:00) in order to try and avoid the crowds, since they don't take reservations. It worked out great as we were seated quickly. Tadich is a very old restaurant in the traditional sense. It's a seafood restaurant that your grandparents and great-grandparents would have dined in for a fun evening out. That said, the service is professional and refined. Don't expect the waiters to entertain you, they can come across as aloof if you're accustomed to restaurant service where the staff tries to be your best friend. So relax and let the service staff provide you with good professional service. Order a cocktail, say thank you when they bring your food and drinks and enjoy yourself. \n\nThe food is old school seafood. Don't expect them to try to focus on the next food trend. They've been in operation since the gold rush. Expect this place to be the same in one hundred years as it was one hundred years ago. \n\nIn a city where so many restaurants try to be the next big thing, it's very nice to have an easy, elegant, and traditional place to have a nice grown-up dinner.

Mind you, this is not an averagely priced restaurant. The total cost was around $150. For the quality of the food, it's definitely way over priced.

You can only imagine how long that bread has been sitting there, and it shows. I wouldn't waste myself on it.\n\nFor the entrees, sure, the much hyped about Sand Dab Filets are pretty good, but for $24? That's a little silly. They come with the vegetable of the day, which was some weird thing that seemed like Chinese broccoli for some reason, and a starch. The fries didn't look so great, so we opted for the rice, foolishly thinking that it was the San Francisco Treat. The vegetable was pretty tasteless and the rice was nothing more than what you would get out of microwave minute rice.\n\nWe also got the Pacific Red Snapper which was also very tasty, but again, not worth it. We opted for the boiled potato with this one, and it was just as tasteless as it sounds.\n\nIt's a good thing this was just a snack to tide us over until we made our way to In-N-Out later (another reason we opted not to get the fries).\n\nI expected much better from this place, especially after seeing it on the 7x7 list and on the Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\nI would probably add a star if it wasn't so overpriced, and maybe if I wasn't allergic to shellfish, as I hear that the Cioppino is supposed to be really good.

I can only hope the Buich family understands that racism and how you treat customers of \"color\" will eventually affect your your bottom line and  no matter how long you've been in business, this type of stain and stench cannot be arbitrarily brushed aside by the city's elite.", "author": "B.

We both started with the shrimp bisque which was so creamy and flavorful. Onto the entrees. Hubby got a grilled snapper dish which was delicious. The filet was generously sized, moist and flaky and so flavorful. The accompanying mixed veggies were fresh and steamed perfectly.  I ordered the seafood canelloni Florentine which was melt-in-your-mouth buttery goodness.  The apple torte finished off the meal perfectly.  It was dense and packed with apples.  We absolutely loved the food.\n\nNow for the not-so-good.  Service was brusque, not particularly friendly, and a bit unpolished. We asked for water twice before we received it. We were seated near a bussing station which didn't prevent the waiters from throwing their dishes into the bucket with great force, making an ear-splitting racket.  Although we went to dinner early, and the restaurant was not full, it was so noisy we could barely hear each other.  Hubby commented that with all the noise and commotion, it was like eating in a bus station.  \n\nOther issues:  the bread was hard, dry and flavorless.  Prices were high: most appetizers in the $15-$18 range, entrees were generally in the $25 -$35 range and desserts were $9.  Food was great, but given the service quality and bus station atmosphere, we think prices were too high.  The thing that must irritated me, however, was the size of the beverages.  Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were served in glasses that were about 30 percent smaller than what you find in most restaurants.  I would guess my Coke was served in a 6 ounce glass filled halfway with ice and they had the nerve to charge me for a refill ($2.75 a pop).  Similarly, hubby's martini was about half the size of any martini he's ever ordered anywhere but priced like a full-sized martini. So we felt a bit ripped off, especially since we were paying so much for the meal.  I mean, come on.  What does soda cost them?  2 cents a glass?\n\nIn summary, great food but not-so-great everything else.  For the price of this experience, we were a bit disappointed.", "author": "Patty V."}

Since hearing about this place from a cousin of mine, I have been wanting to try it.  She just went on and on and on about their Ciopinno.  Got here around 6:15pm and was seated about 6:45pm. While waiting for a seat, you can site at the bar and have a drink if there is an opening.  The first half of the bar is for drinks only and the back half is for drinks and eating.\n\nAppetizers - Since it was our first time here, we ordered 3 different appetizers to try it out.\n\nDungeness Crab Cocktail - Yummy.  I will choose crab over shrimp any day.  Made just like the shrimp cocktail, but with meat from crab claws instead. Came with some veggies and cocktail sauce on the bottom.\n\nPacific Oysters Rockefeller (6 oysters) - Made with creme spinach and cheese.  I thought this was okay only.  The oysters were pretty small and the oyster shells were loaded with creme spinach and topped off with cheese.  All I was able to taste was the creme spinach.  I personally prefer raw oysters instead.\n\nGarlic Buttered Manilla Clams - Yums!  This was the best appetizer of the night!  We ordered a dozen and finished it in no time.  The clams were huge!  The white sauce it came with was very delicious and tasted very good with the complimentary bread.  \n\nEntrees:\n\nSeafood Ciopinno - OMG....sooo good!  I don't care for Ciopinno to start out with, but this Ciopinno was delicious.  The broth was a little salty if you sip it, but the seafood in the dish tasted amazing and it wasn't salty.  The garlic bread was a compliment to the broth.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Very tasty and yummy dish.\n\nMy friend had the Charcoal Broiled Fresh Alaskan Halibut and thought it was just okay.  He said the fish was pretty bland and wish it had more flavor.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience and I will definitely come back here for their Ciopinno.", "author": "Ashley L."}

What, exactly, is SO special about this place?!\n\nMy boyfriend and I are from LA and were visiting SF this past weekend. We stayed at Le Meridien and were recommended Tadich.\n\nThe ambiance was great, we were seated immediately--but everything else went south from there. Our waiter was rude and had nothing to say about anything. We started with two bloody mary's which were literally vodka and tomato juice. We ended up putting lemon and lime and salt and pepper in it to spice it up ourselves because it was so \"blah.\" Then he ordered the clam chowder, which was very watery and nothing special. We also got the shrimp cocktail, which was a huge surprise in general! I must not be used to shrimp (vs. prawns), but besides for that, the cocktail sauce was really very gross.\n\nOn to the main dishes--\n\nMy boyfriend got somewhat of a seafood medley, which he said was \"OK.\" I absolutely LOVE swordfish, so I thought that would be a good dish to try, given Tadich was supposed to be one of the best spots for seafood. It was actually inedible. It was SO dry and chewy I only ended up eating a quarter of the thing. The \"vegetable of the night\" was gross soggy carrots and broccoli. Really? And our waiter recommended creamed spinach to go with our meal and since my boyfriend loves that we decided to try it since he made it sound like a specialty item. It was also inedible. It had nutmeg in it? And tasted like baby food from a cafeteria (if that even exists). \n\nAll in all, this meal came out to be $150.

You've read everyone else's review that calls this place \"old school\".  That means the wholesome, butter enriched high calorie food and European level of table service makes this place a gem.\n\nThe food here defines \"comfort\" for me. I grew up in New York City a loooong time ago (the 1950's).  There were 100's of restaurants there and then that served dishes like Tadich makes today. The creamy sauces and par boiled vegetables at Tadich take me back to a time when I was young, innocent and appreciative. The aromas at Tadich do powerfully rekindle old memories.\n\nWell, more than a half century has passed since my childhood and I can now appreciate a bracing cocktail at the Tadich bar, while patiently waiting for a table to become available. And then once seated, I read the copiously populated menu to tease my taste buds.\n\nI often order sand dabs. This humble fish was once so available when I was a kid that it was practically given away for free.  Now it's on the endangered species list.  What! an endangered flounder?  None the less, I order it and enjoy it.\n\nI'll probably eat here another 30 times before my journey to the great beyond.  And I hope that the Tadich grill is still serving sand dabs long after I'm gone.", "author": "Tom S."}

I had friends in town from out of state and was excited to take them here.  A party of four, three of us arrived and gave our name for the wait.  We were seated by Justin (who took our name and knew we were a party of four with only three there).  The waitress arrived and we ordered for the missing person so we didn't delay our waitress or the restaurant.  She apparently informed the host Justin that we were seated without our entire party (apparently something they never do).  Justin (mind you he took our name AND seated us), came to the table and grabbed the menus and indicated we needed to get up, that we shouldnt have been seated.  We told him we already ordered and he literally threw the menus back down on the table and stormed off.  Not wanting to create any additional awkward tension, we sat through our meal and paid the check.  After paying we asked the waitress to please have the manager came, and guess who that happened to be?  Justin.  My friend let him know how rude and strange his behavior was.  His response \"there was an issue with the front staff and I took it out on you.  Sorry.\"  That was it.  While the food was tasty I have never seen such behavior and quite frankly was embarrassed for my friends having to witness that in SF while on vacation.

To reiterate what others have written, this place is old school, traditional and in many ways a little phony old school in that they play it up.  Waiters are very formal and professional.

First, although the service is formal, we had a great and very nice waiter. Second the food is good.  I had a salad Louie to start.

After having seen the Tadich Grill on several Food Network shows, I was almost embarrassed that I haven't been there before now.  I went in during the supposedly not-busy time, Saturday afternoon at around 3pm.  The bar had several seats open, so that's where I sat.  I was promptly greeted by my server, who (you could tell) was a 40-something professional (score one right off the bat for not employing teenagers).  I felt obligated to order the Cioppino, their signature dish.  Needless to say, the legends were true.  Huge shrimp, massive clams, and an abundance of other seafood so fresh, it has to be seen to be believed.  This was an absolutely fantastic meal in every way.  Having walked the Golden Gate (twice) an hour earlier, I was hungry enough to eat a horse, and the portion size of the Cioppino was surprisingly large.  I washed it down with two vodka martinis, and put the whole experience in the \"win\" column.  Tadich Grill is the oldest restaurant in San Francisco, and I was impressed by the minimalist decor inside.  \"Stately\" is the word that comes to mind, but not overly adorned with photos or art on the walls.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "description": "The Tadich Grill is the oldest continuously run restaurant in California.  It is a fish house located in the Financial District that is hugely popular and always busy.  It is composed of a barroom and a large dinning room split into two sections.  It is attractively decorated with walls clad in dark wood and furnished with white-cloth-covered tables.  This restaurant is closed on Sundays but open the rest of the week for lunch and dinner with the same menu for both times.  Items designated \"Today's Specials\" are available for lunch and dinner.  Not surprisingly, it has an old-time ambiance that is really comfortable.  \n\nThis restaurant does not take reservations.  However, you can call in and ask for approximate wait times.  \n\nThe entrance leads to the barroom.  At the head of the bar a host takes names for seating.  Note that customers must be waitlisted for both the dining room and for the bar.  The bar is long and divided in half by a brass railing for drinks exclusively on one side and for meals on the other side.\n\nAfter calling to determine the wait time, my wife and dined there on a crowded weekday evening.  We checked in with the host and had about a 10-minute wait for a stool at the bar where we each had a drink.  (My wife sat and I squeezed in next to her.) We were also put on the list for the dining room and after about 20 minutes were notified when a table for us was ready.\n\nMy wife had the grilled crab cakes with rice and vegetables.  I had the cioppino, the restaurant's signature dish, which is a seafood stew made with a tomato-based sauce and an assortment of shell fish and also white fish.  My wife thought her food was very well made with fresh ingredients and very flavorful although a bit on the rich side.  My meal was expertly prepared with extremely fresh ingredients and was sensational!  It was very filling but tasted so good that after devouring it I wanted more.  I enjoyed this extraordinary dish so much that it has become one of my all-time favorites.  The bar and dining service was professional and efficient as well as unhurried.\n\nWe had a fabulous dining experience at the Tadich Grill, and I most strongly recommend it for its throwback but very enjoyable atmosphere, excellent service, and most of all for its marvelous food.", "author": "Michael D."}

It was a tomato soup-like dish with a plethora of seafood (ie shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, lobster, while fish pieces, etc). I loved the flavor of the broth, but it definitely had a lot of garlic. I love garlic though so it was super tasty to me. The garlic bread was also delicious: buttery and garlicky just the way garlic bread should be. They also give you a chunk of delicious sourdough when you sit down. This was a lot of food and I couldn't finish it all. Although I couldn't take the left over seafood (no fridge) I did ask to take the rest of the bread. Instead of wrapping up the piece I had been served the bartender cut a fresh piece with no slices since it would keep better for me. \n\nWhile I was eating I noticed a lot of people that came in to eat at the bar seemed to have some sort of connection with a bartender.

On my previous visit, I'd ordered the cioppino, which was excellent, but I wanted to try something new, so I ordered the seafood saute; the crab, prawns, and scallops in a cream sauce were all delicious. Also, my dining partner ordered the cioppino, and he pronounced it excellent as well.  I also ordered a Caesar salad, which was fine but nothing special.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 was that the service was pretty slow and inattentive.  Perhaps this was due to being seated at the bar instead of a regular table.  Overall, I'd like to return on my next trip to San Francisco.", "author": "Robert M."}

I could've swore I saw the Tadich Grill in it. Not surprising considering it is one of the oldest businesses in California. \n\nNot that it's a bad thing. You feel like you're nostalgically stepping back in time the moment you walk into the restaurant. It's the old-school fussy SF dining experience but something to definitely try because service here is extremely attentive to say the least. \n\nLike the Mad Men we are, lunch started with some martinis and big prawn and dungeness crab cocktails. Nothing extraordinary here but the seafood was definitely fresh and tasty. I had the Ahi Tuna (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WxxE5kE8omgQhJE8sWIvmA?select=CLU9u86IviLcVu3V0YAW4g) which came with a big mound of wakaname seaweed and a side salad. The fish had a nice char on the outside and the slight sweetness of the seaweed was a nice counterpoint to the meaty fish. All in all, it was an enjoyable meal. Or maybe that was the martinis talking. \n\nTadich Grill is just one of those places where you have to go to check off your list. The food is good though not spectacular but the place is absolutely charming in how it has stood the test of time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-19", "description": "There are restaurants with innovative menus, chefs who slaughter their own rabbits and grow their own produce.  We have grown accustomed to local cheeses, artisan baked bread, farm-fresh eggs, heirloom tomatoes and molecular gastronomy.  Beautiful, hand-crafted, house-cured, local, sustainable and organic is de rigueur... \nUnless you are  Tadich Grill.  \n\nIn which case, you disregard everything I just wrote, and change for no one. \n\nLast night, I walked a section of California and with a few strides, went back in time: beyond the supremely young and upbeat  Barbacco; past my beloved Perbacco's celebrated food and exemplary service... To the Oldest Restaurant in San Francisco.  \n\nI'd already grazed my way through the Ferry Building, but I was feeling the chill, and a drink from the bar sounded nice.  \"Drink, drink, who needs a drink?  Whooo... Needs a drink?\" was the convivial welcome from the white-jacketed bartenders for patrons to belly up to the dark wood bar. \n\nBartenders are seasoned veterans who move at lightening speed up and down behind the counter, deftly avoiding collisions and other injuries one normally associates with hockey while vigorously shaking martinis for vodka-voiced matriarchs and bastions of the Suit and Tie sets.\n\nMy beverage was a Decaf Bailey's and instantly warmed me up.  As I sipped, the din dissolved into a pleasant cacophony of clattering dishes.  I pondered the menu, stocked with the usual suspects, and decided to proceed with caution after the kitchen hollered to Peetie  that the pasta special was  \"Noodles\"   He laughed, shrugging, \"Whaddaya gonna do?\"  \n\nI ordered a side of \"noodles\" dressed in olive oil and garlic.  Shortly thereafter, I was rewarded with a platter of flaccid spaghetti, baptized in olive oil and piled high with minced garlic.  Hmmmmm.\n\nThe Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($16.25) tempted me because it's local and in season - it was served in a sundae glass, with just a bit of lettuce and two dollops of cocktail sauce, with more on the side.  What a delicious indulgence!  It's probably the very best I've had in a long time: bright, clean, fresh and sweet.\n\nNot a hint of that ammonia-frozen taste or smell... My only concern was that there were some fingernail-sized chunks of shell and cartilage still in the cocktail, so I had to spit, sputter and pick my way through, cautiously.  I really just wanted to inhale the gorgeous thing, so in the end, it was probably better that I was able to savor it longer.\n\nThe cocktail was a bit underwhelming, and Peetie did offer to remake it with some different liqueurs and turn it into a really snazzy drink for me.  His pitch was very much appreciated and  sounded absolutely delicious.  I did not take him up on it, since I did not want the first drink to be wasted.  \n\nI can imagine myself coming by again for the experience and maybe another Dungeness Crab Cocktail before the primo season is over.  Tadich has set a new standard for the simple, beautiful pleasure of sweet crustaceans.\n\nThere are other more glamorous, inventive places I could enjoy this straightforward treat... But I'm going to enjoy an oldie but goodie at this oldie but goodie.\n\n\"Whaddaya gonna do...?\"", "author": "Kim D."}

We arrived about 8pm or so and the place was relatively busy (~60%) but we were able to be seated right away in a cozy booth.  The food was fantastic!   The atmosphere was classic and upscale.   The service however...unfortunately not so good for us and this was a disappointment as I was a really memorable dining experience.   \n\nWe shared a crabcake as a appetizer and it was the best ever!  Our entrees came out relatively quickly and we each were impressed by and enjoyed our dishes.  The service however started to breakdown once the food was on the table after which our server was nowhere to be found.   Fortunately after the food was delivered we really didn't need anything but I certainly noticed that the server never bothered to check on us.  After we finished our food one of the guys (not a server) cleared the table and we found ourselves waiting for a dessert menu.   After I couldn't take it anymore I flagged down any server and just requested a dessert menu which was given to me right away.   I assume there was some server to server communication because within a minute or so our guy shows up and asked if we'd like to order a dessert.  I asked him if he'd forgotten about us and he said he had not forgotten about us but he had other tables to attend to.  I understood this poor excuse for poor service to mean that it was more important for him deliver good service to his other table than to our table.  Nonetheless, if he didn't realize that I/we felt we weren't getting adequate service...the fact that I told him I thought he forgot about us should have put him on notice.  \n\nOur dessert was delivered timely (Bourbon Bread Pudding) and it was great but again I found myself waiting for the server and the check.  At this point I was kind of over it...I just wanted to settle up and get out of there because this guy was really starting to work my nerves.\n\nWhen I finally got the server I just asked for the check (and gave him my credit card) which he brought quickly but when looking it over I realized that he'd charged me for a $38 steak that we didn't order.  Pointed out the \"mistake\" and he quickly agreed that it was something we didn't order.   It took him 10 to 15 minutes to go an resolve the check issue which tried to explain was the result of another party wanting separate checks?  He also stated that even though the $38 steak was on our bill we weren't actually charged for it.  \n\nIn summary, the food was outstanding but the service was at best a comedy of errors.  I'd actually like to go back and give them a try again (the food was that good).  I'd like to think that my experience was an anomaly...a restaurant doesn't enjoy as much success for so long as has the Tadich Grill unless they know how to delivering great food with great service.", "author": "Michael H."}

When my friend Bernadette R. told me she was meeting me for lunch first thing in the morning and was craving crab, all productivity and concentration went out the window. I picked a place close to my office known for fresh seafood. \n\nThe last time I came here was for a work lunch, they said \"Order whatever you want Rebekah.... \", which I said \"Thanks, I'll have the Lobster Thermidor\". It was rich and quite delicious, but this time I had crab on my mind this time around.\n\nWe arrived a little after twelve, trying to beat the lunch rush and there was already a line for seats. Bar stools are first come first serve, as soon as one opened up I was on it like a hawk. After being seated, we were served fresh sourdough bread - nice big crusty and doughy soft sourdough with chilled butter.\n\nSince we were in the mood to share and try a little of everything, we ordered the Seafood Appetizer Platter ($21) which had oysters, crab, smoked salmon, smoked trout, calamari, shrimp, anchovies, avocado, tomato, cheese and lettuce. This is a huge plate and great for snacking. \n\nFor our main course we split the Deep Fried Crab Legs platter ($31), shell-less crab meat breaded and fried served with broccoli and Yukon gold potatoes. I'm not big into fried food, but these were not greasy and very delicious.\n\nI have to say the House Cocktail sauce mixed with their Horseradish is the perfect dipping sauce for all seafood. There is nothing like fresh sauce to go with your fresh fish or seafood.  \n\nWe left full and happy. I went back to work, just knowing that I scored big at lunch. I can't wait to go back, I was staring down the Crab Louie sitting next to me and next time - he's MINE.", "author": "Rebekah T."}

A classic dining experience, with old, dark walls, big booths (surprisingly private), starched shirt wait staff.  A big menu, lots going on.\n The service was great, pretty much flawless.  Bread was awesome.  \n We were there for a late lunch, I had the pot roast, which I think was listed as a lunch.  A huge portion, and wonderfully tasty.  Halfway through, I told myself I needed to stop... and did for a while, but ended up eating it all, as the taste, texture, flavor was not to be missed or denied.\n I was there with clients and I can't report too much on their meals, but there wasn't much left on any of the plates when we were done!\n Highly recommended.", "author": "Tom C."}

We needed a table for 3 and had about a 20 minute wait at the bar. Tables for 2 were much faster than for 3.\nIt was WORTH the wait. The food was wonderful and the service was excellent. I had pacific red snapper with bay shrimp and a tomato and anchovy salad. The salad was unique and I will have to try to make something similar as I love anchovies. My wife and daughter shared a shrimp bisque. Rich, creamy and flavorful but lacking in shrimp pieces. My wife had scallops and my daughter had the Cioppino.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-29", "description": "We were running in the San Francisco rain towards a German restaurant called Schroeder's located around the corner. It wasn't going to be open for another 1.5 hours so we needed shelter for our heads and empty stomachs. We looked towards the sky at falling raindrops and drifting clouds. We looked peripherally and saw a welcoming restaurant with a wooden/quaint interior design housing servers dressed in white coats and white hair.\n\nAnyway, we tried the $30 Ciopinno and a bowl of their Clam Chowder. As much hype as this place gets, I don't think either of these dishes are stellar. They are average to my taste buds. The Ciopinno red sauce wasn't as flavorful as I hoped. The chowder seemed to be overpowered by potatoes. If I had to come back for some reason, I for sure wouldn't order these again. Go to Fisherman's Wharf for some good Boston clam chowder.\n\nThe servers could smile more. I mean they did their jobs well, but damn how about some service with a smile. It doesn't matter how old you are, if you were in customer service, you must be happy and smile no matter what. If you can't do that, then work somewhere else that better suits you. I'm also thinking that they've worked there for so long and don't really make that much money in San Francisco so how could they smile. I know this is really irrelevant but I mean this is my experience and you'll probably see the same thing. I guess this place is not Disneyland.\n\nNonetheless, I can't say that they don't serve fresh seafood and there's lots of SF history here so that might warrant at least one visit here to understand/feel/experience the calming/homely SF vibe.", "author": "Marlon T."}

This review is based purely upon the shocking customer service I received from your bartender there today. \n\nMy boyfriend and I planned to meet at 4:30, but I finished work early and thought I would go ahead of him to sit and have a drink and wait for him there. When I walked in, I was greeted by the bartender who snidely asked me if I was lost by way of a joke. I said no and that I was there to meet someone in an hour but wanted a drink and to get an appetizer. I asked for a table and he told me that I couldn't be seated at a table. I asked why and he said because the rest of my party wasn't there. \n\n1) so Tadich grill, you don't seat people at a table if they're a party of one? I don't think so. I'm not a 16 year old who was going to drink your water and eat your bread and loiter around. You lost out on not just the cocktails and dinner we were going to have today, but on future dinners we would have had there. \n\n2)  get someone who greets patrons with warmth and sincerity instead of thinly veiled hostility.", "author": "Brynley W."}

We make it a point each time we visit the city by the bay we have at least two meals here. Fortunately we visit during a weekday in the early afternoon so there is no wait time. They do not take reservations and on Friday and Saturday nights be expected to wait quite some time. For 40+ years we have been coming to this absolutely wonderful restaurant for the greatest meal in town.  Love sitting at the counter and converse with the staff who some have been there as long as we have been going. My husband usually orders the seafood cioppino which is always the best he has ever tasted. Their claim chowder hands down is a winner. Our dinner consisted of Petrale Sole,  their Salad Special which consisted of Ahi Tuna, a couple bowls of clam chowder, their fantastic sour dough bread and a wonderful bottle of wine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-04", "description": "For years, I have been reading about this place in the Chronicle. My daughter is home for a visit, and I invited her out yesterday for lunch and shopping in the city. I chose Tadich Grill out of curiosity and because it features fish, a favorite of my daughter's. It was a pleasant surprise that Tadich Grill is so close to the Embarcadero Bart station; the walk was quite short. We planned on arriving at 2 PM, because we did not want to wait around for a table. Our strategy paid off. The restaurant was not crowded when we arrived, and we were seated immediately. \n\nAmbiance: This is a white tablecloth place, but people were not dressed up. I saw a number of people in blue jeans and t-shirts and tennis shoes. Others wore coats and ties. I felt more comfortable wearing a dress and jacket, but this is 2015, and times are more casual. There are a number of larger tables for four in very private, inviting little rooms all along the west wall. I would have loved to have been seated in one of those rooms with a larger table, but I understand that those are for larger parties, even though most of those rooms were empty throughout our meal. \n\nFood: Perhaps I should mention up front that I am not a big fan of seafood. My daughter ordered a cup of white clam chowder and a shrimp-avocado salad, which she thoroughly enjoyed. I had an avocado salad, and I found it delightful that other items were included in the salad. As well as the lettuce and avocado, there was a radish, carrot stick, tomato wedge, large slice of cucumber and even an olive. The house dressing is delicious. I also ordered the crab cake entree, because crab cakes are a specialty of the house, and because crab is one type of seafood that I do enjoy. The crab cakes did not knock my socks off, and the side vegetables were a bit too garlicky. The waiter suggested a plate of asparagus on the side, which we both loved. My favorite item was the sour dough bread and butter. Portions were generous, and we were, as usual, unable to finish all of our food. We left with a box or two. \n\nService: Somewhat efficient but not friendly. My daughter was unpleasantly surprised that freshly ground black pepper was not offered with our salads. The most annoying thing about the service was the size of the table. We were seated at a table for two, and with our appetizer, entree, side vegetable, bread, butter and drinks, we were quite crowded. I am a slow eater. I like to take my time. It is healthier to eat slowly. So our entrees came out before I had finished my salad, and there was really not enough room for everything on the table. This was not the fault of the waiter, of course, but it made the meal less pleasant and relaxing. \n\nCost: It is San Francisco, so I simply expect higher prices. We both had tea. My daughter ordered one cocktail. The grand total, including tax, was $106. I think that is high, but the food was fresh and quite edible, and this is the business district of San Francisco. \n\nWould I return? Honestly, there are too many other choices in the city, and there were at least 3 other quite well known restaurants on the same block. Nothing that I ate at Tadich Grill made me say to myself, \"I want to go back and order that again.\" This place is not calling me back.", "author": "Gail E."}

This place gets 0 stars for the food, 1 star for the wine, and 1 star for the service. I brought one of my best friends here to celebrate his birthday and it was an AWFUL experience all around. I got sick from the food and have literally been nauseous from it all day. They had also run out of a ton of dishes like Lobster Ravioli that I really wanted to try. \n\n1. Firstly, they don't take reservations so we had to wait 20-30min. \n\n2. I told our server it was my friend's birthday and he implied they would do something and I guess he forgot because he didn't do anything or even offer us a dessert menu! I have never gone to a restaurant on someone's bday and not ordered dessert wth?!\n\n3. Only food that was good - cups of Clam Chowder with red sauce and white sauce. Both were spectacular!\n\n4. Food that probably made us sick - Tadich Platter Appetizer + Dungeness Crab and Prawns a la Monza + Crab and Lobster Thermido Baked en Casserole. We hated the last two so much we only had 2-3 bites of food and our server took both dishes off our bill. We didn't replace them because we were so put off by the gross bitter taste from both dishes! At the end of our dinner service, our server told us that one of the chefs had messed up on the sauce in the baked dishes, which explained the awful flavor. If he had messed up, why the hell were they still serving those dishes?! Plus, the meat in both dishes was overcooked. I'm still feeling so sick from eating this and I know I won't be touching seafood for a while. \n\n5. Food that was good but not great - Seafood Saute. You can't really go wrong with this. \n\nEven with our 2 main dishes taken off the bill, it came out to $120. Let's just say, I'm never ever coming back here.

Talk about seafood galore, I mean it was loaded. Clams, mussels, fish, crab, shrimp and prawns in a tomato base.  It must have been simmering for a long time to get this amount of flavor to come through. The garlic bread for dipping to soak up all the flavors hit the spot.

They have more than 150 years of reputation to establish their creds.  They must have been pretty damn good to stand the test of that time.  My first time there was when my dear departed mom took me to SF for a 16th birthday weekend celebration.  I won't say how long ago that was, but it was not long enough ago that I didn't remember it.  Don't remember having been back since...\n\nFast forward to Monday.  I met my sister and friend there for lunch.  We got there right at 11:30, to avoid the rush and lucked out and got seated in a booth.  After all agreeing to have a martini, even though it was way too early for cocktail hour, we set about making our selections.  \n\nI have always wanted to try hangtown fry, so went for that.  S got the calves liver and K got the petrale sole.  These selections were so 1930!  I was a little disappointed with mine.  It was cooked too long.  The eggs were way well done, and the oysters were beyond the point where they retained any of their luscious liquors.  Also it definitely could have used more salt!  \n\nS.'s liver was perfectly medium (just pink) with lots of sauteed onions.  There aren't a lot of places where you can order liver at all, let alone perfectly cooked.  K's petrale sole was also expertly sauteed.  It was a large portion and very fresh.\n\nOur waiter was efficient to a fault, but pretty cold in demeanor.  I definitely got the message that he wanted to take care of business and turn the table.  Unfortunately for him, we weren't that kind of gals.  We lingered and talked, and though he didn't shoot us dirty looks, I'm sure he would have preferred if we'd left faster.\n\nThere were so many other classic retro dishes I'd like to try.

Anyhow, I just went there last night and I got the pork chops w/ applesauce.  My wife got the Cioppinno and my friend got the pan fried fish (sole to be exact).  Let's review going from the best to worse.\n1. Cioppinno - It was just okay.  Everyone raves about it, but it didn't taste that good.  it's not bad either, but it didn't wow me.  The best place is by far, Sam's Chowder house in Half Moon Bay for Cioppinno.  That place, the broth is much more depth of flavors.  \n\n2. Pan Fried Fish - well, it was a good piece of fish that was well fried.  The fish was huge.  Besides that, the side veggies were lame - simply boiled.  Overall a good fish, but not worth $28.  No where near.  I had fish like this for $8.\n\n3. Pork Chops w/ Applesauce - Why do people rave about this and why did I check yelp on the photos?  There were so many photos of this, so I thought it was good - bad mistake.  These chops were over the top terrible!!!!  I cannot express enough, DO NOT ORDER.  To me it seemed like the chops were deep fried w/o any breading, and you know what means, it's basically being boiled in oil.  And after, they must have taken paper towels or put the chops on a wire rack to dry and then seared some grid lines with the grill.  I can tell all this because the meat of waaaayyyy overcooked and it had this rubbery texture, which often happens when you deep fry white meat without an outside casing such as breading.  Anyhow, the worse of all was the applesauce.  Geez that was literally applesauce!!!  Who serves plain, canned applesauce for a thick piece of pork chop.  To make it even worse, I could taste some white wine in the sauce.  So it basically was can applesauce mixed with white wine uncooked.  That is sooo freakin nasty.  \n\nAnyhow, the only real positive was the ambiance.  it was a very nice historic place.  But overall, that's not enough to make me go again.  It was waaay tooo pricey for such amateur cooking.", "author": "Mark S."}

And nicely cooked. Fish is moist and tender. It's  just prepared in a very dated, unexciting way. Maybe that goes with the antique schtick. But, while I used to go to this sort of place with my grandparents, I'd rather not spend my money this way as an adult with other choices. Especially since you have to wait a long time because it's such a touristy destination.\n\nMy recommendation, sit at the bar. Have a drink. Soak in the ambience. Banter with the white coated staff.

Not going to complain though because in the Financial District a dinner is worth an arm and a leg unless you are an investment banker- they take arms and legs for a living so they can afford it!\n\nI tried the filet mignon with lobster tail. The filet mignon was so on point. The sauce that went with it is a different story. I could have sworn they put a block of butter on the broccoli. It was so delicious. The lobster tail was a bit overcooked, but still extremely delicious. I tried some of my friend's Mesquite Broiled Chilean Sea Bass Filet with Prawn Garnish and that tasted amazing! Some of my other friends got the sampler and were not impressed! \n\nDon't think I would try this again because it's a bit pricey for great food.

The bar tenders had a fun vibe keeping guests entertained while staying busy to make sure our drinks were full. \n\nOnce we were seated there were so many tasty options on the menu it was almost impossible to make up our minds.  We started with the Dungeness Crab cocktail since they are supposed to be in season and it was so fresh and tender it was gone within two bites.  We also got the clams in a white wine and butter sauce.  The sauce made the dish and we were dipping our bread in and practically licking our plates clean.\n\nThe only downside to showing up late is they were out of the sand dabs and sea bass which are two dished we really wanted.  I ordered the halibut which was really good but I wish I went with something a little more adventurous for the restaurant.  My boyfriend got the Cioppino which was by far my favorite dish,  Loads of seafood from sea bass, scallops, oysters, shrimp were piled in the tomato broth which gave flavor to the entire dish.  Grilled bread came on the side to dunk into the sauce.  \n\nTo end the meal we had a bourbon bread pudding which was to die for.  The bourbon sauce drizzled over the top had a perfect sweetness and the pudding was soft but not mushy.\n\nI will be back for another special occasion and ready to try another one of there many options on the menu.", "author": "Sutton A."}

I tried to eat here once before, but they were out of sand dabs (around 8:30pm on a weekday night), so I decided to come on another day. We came for lunch right when they opened at 11am on a Saturday, and were seated right away. We ordered:\n\n-Boston Clam Chowder (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WxxE5kE8omgQhJE8sWIvmA?select=1LDUn7AO5zhjFnD4tWcN7Q#xoSxyx_LS9kVktkGirVMxA): Solid clam chowder! Very, very creamy and rich tasting, so I was glad we opted for the smaller size to share.\n-Dungeness Crab Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WxxE5kE8omgQhJE8sWIvmA?select=1LDUn7AO5zhjFnD4tWcN7Q#oWYXlaqIzdX95Mg9FeIXSQ): Ok.. I was expecting a little more. I didn't like the sauce it was served on top of, and I also didn't think the chipotle aioli went well with it. I much preferred the tartar sauce they give you.\n-Pan-Fried Sand Dabs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WxxE5kE8omgQhJE8sWIvmA?select=1LDUn7AO5zhjFnD4tWcN7Q#FKlE_4uCC20DQP1WoUHzLQ): Again, only ok. This was recommended by both Anthony Bourdain and on the 7x7 2012 Big Eat List, so I had really high expectations. The sand dab meat was really firm, and had a nice crust from the pan frying. However, there were still a lot of tiny bones, so it was hard to eat it with confidence. They give you a small bowl of tartar sauce, which I loved and dipped everything from the steamed veggies to the french fries to the sand dabs in. \n\nThe service was very accommodating here, especially the host, who greets you with a warm welcome and also thanks you for dining there when you're heading out. Unfortunately, I didn't have a dish that I would rush back here to eat again, but they have an extensive menu, so I'm sure I can find something I enjoy, especially because I want to dip it in more of that tartar sauce! They give you complimentary bread and butter, so that is a plus as well. Parking should be fairly easy to find in this area.", "author": "Amy D."}

We arrived around 11:30-11:45 AM..to celebrate my sister's birthday. \n\nWe had just finished a wonderful morning in Japantown at Kabuki Spa and Springs.  We were all in a wonderful and giddy mood.  All starving , but definitely in great spirits and ready to eat some exciting food..! However the experience we received was quite the opposite. \n\nWe had 5 ladies in our group and were extremely excited to eat at Tadich Grill, given all the great reviews that Tadich Grill has on YELP.  More so,  my cousins boss recommended this restaurant because he said the food was delicious and the service was outstanding..  Well, I beg to differ after my experience.\n\nOur waiter was Barry,  He came off as rude and arrogant and completely acted like he was too good to be waiting on us.  We decided not to make a big deal because we wanted to have a really good experience at Tadich.  So we brushed off Barry's attitude and continued....\n\nWe started off by ordering calamari and oysters on the half shell, some soup and a few soft drinks.\n\nThe appetizers came out very quickly and we were greatly appreciative considering we were starving! The calamari was great and so were the oysters.  Calamari came out hot and the oysters were fresh..!\n\nBarry brought out my coke... with a lot of ice and in a very small glass. I thought it was kind of weird for soda to come out in such small glass, but no big deal. \n\nBarry came back after a few minutes and we ordered the lobster thermadore, ciopinno, shrimp curry and 2 orders of the petrale sole.\n\nThe ciopinno was one of the best I've ever had.  The rest of the of the food was mediocre.  Pretty blahhhhhh.. Not a lot of flavor or taste.  Needed a lot more spice and salt.  Not worth the money we spent that day. \n\nI think what killed it for me was being told to pay for a 'REFILL' on a coke.  C'mon, are you kidding me!!!! We are paying well over $25-35 per entree...and Tadich Grill charges for refills on soda..and to top it off, the soda comes out in such tiny glasses..with an abundance of ice....!!!! Absolutely preposterous!!!! I was so turned off by this...  I could not believe it.  But even more so, to add insult to injury... When I asked Barry for a refill, he very rudely says, \"I can't REFILL it for you, but you can RE-PURCHASE another one. Of course, I RE-purchased another coke.\n\nNow Barry brings out the bill..total $207...and some change. We place a $50 bill, plus 3 credit cards and tell Barry to put $50 cash towards the bill and split the remaining balance between the credit cards.\n\nMy aunt then wants to pay $100 with her card and advised Barry to put $100 on her card, put $50 towards the remaining balance and then finally split that balance between the 2 cards.\n\nBarry pockets $50 because he says that it was understood that it was going to be his tip...!!! Barry...ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!! What in the world would make you think that you deserve a 30% tip.....!!!!!!! He didn't even deserve a 18% tip...Even though we still ended up giving him a tip..!\n\nWhen Barry came back with the screw up..we told him that he messed up and we needed it corrected.  Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue. He mumbled an array of rude remarks under his breath an came back and pretty much threw the bill at us. I've never been so appalled in my life.  And to top it off... he never once made a reference to my sisters birthday.. !!!\n\nOn another note: We tried to stop another waiter to ask for some water refills.  The waiter simply replied that he would find Barry, but he was doing absolutely nothing..just standing there. He could have easily refilled our water glasses.  Extremely rude and lazy.\n\nI'm not only disappointed in the food, but I'm disgusted with the service.", "author": "Shalini M."}

There are far better seafood places in SF to drop your dough on like Woodhouse Fish company, Hog Island or Anchor and Hope.\n\nHowever, their manhattans and martinis, LOVE!  The classic martini involves gin or if you MUST use vodka (sigh) the version here at Tadich is dry and served with pimiento stuffed olives. \n\nTheir Manhattan is made with Old Crow whiskey and Cinzano sweet vermouth. Don't be aghast if Mr. barman puts a maraschino cherry in your glass, instead of some fancy housemade brandied cherry, because that's the way they've always done it and they won't change it for you. \n\nTadich is the oldest resto in SF (they have a sign that says so!)

My fiancee and I went on a Monday night around 5 P.M. because we were hungry and it was a short walk from our hotel. We were seated immediately and brought bread and butter. The butter is so cold and hard that you cannot spread it on the bread. This may not be a big deal to some people, but I hate plain bread. My fiancee ordered the ribeye, which he said was good. The ribeye is served with potatoes and vegetables. He asked our waiter if he could sub those out and the waiter said no but that he could order something else a la carte. I had the crab cakes with rice and vegetables. I grew up in Virginia and have always ate Chesapeake Blue Crab, and I honestly think that the Dungeness crab tastes a lot different, not in a good way so it was not what I was expecting. They put some sort of remoulade/tartar sauce on your crab cakes, and I was not a fan of that either because it tasted a lot like just mayo and dill. The vegetables served were lifeless, no seasoning whatsoever. The server was rude, he made little comments and what he did say came out very short and curt. I was honestly afraid to ask him for things. Lastly, having experienced Tadich and the quality of food they serve there, I would say this restaurant is heavily overpriced. There is no culinary genius going on there, it's just a restaurant capitalizing on its history. Do yourself a favor and book it over to one of the restaurants in the Ferry building before it closes instead of going here, your taste buds and wallet will thank you.", "author": "Caroleigh N."}

Sounded like my kind of place, a nice traditional (and historic) Seafood and Steakhouse restaurant.  So I took a co-worker there for dinner.  What a disappointment.\n\nWe arrived just before the dinner rush (around 5:00PM) and were seated immediately. Our waiter was not what I would call the friendly or outgoing type. He spoke to us in very short phrases, offered no information on the menu or drinks available, and seemed disinterested in us throughout our meal. When he brought us our food, he reversed our orders and seemed almost annoyed when my co-worker and I started to switch our plates.  He grabbed them from us, without a word, and then placed them in front of the proper person.  That was odd to say the least.\n\nThe food itself was completely lack luster. I ordered the New York Strip. I was surprised first of all to receive a steak that was less than an inch thick. At a steakhouse like this I would have expected a nice thick cut, especially on a NY Strip. The steak was cooked unevenly. I had ordered medium yet on one end it was done to a very well, in the middle it was about medium, and on the other end it was almost rare. The seasonings were OK but overall the flavor lacked any real character.  The steak came with their house potatoes, basically broasted potato wedges. These had very little flavor at all, and in fact I had to dip them in steak sauce just to make them palatable.\n\nMy Co-worker ordered the \"Jumbo\" Prawns which turned out to be anything but jumbo. Definitely not what you'd get if you went to any super market and bought a bag of shrimp labeled \"Jumbo\".  He did express that despite being smaller than expected they were tasty.\n\nWe both agreed this was a fairly negative experience and chose to pass on dessert, not even looking at the dessert menu. For all the build-up and the appearances presented, the experience was surprising and unfortunate.  I must say that the food and service that I had at a different chain steakhouse earlier in the week was far more enjoyable than this day's dinner.", "author": "Tony M."}

The waiters, in their white jackets, look as though they've all worked there for years, and our waiter seemed annoyed because we asked too many questions (he said he had been there for 18 years).  Their menu is extensive, and I ordered the fried lobster.  Definitely should have chosen something else.  Very chewy and not at all flavorful.

It still looks old school on the inside with the style and decor, but the restaurant has been well maintained. It was pretty packed so expect a 20-30minute wait. The menu is huge and seems to be printed everyday, I think they switch up a few things on the menu based on what kind of fish is available. I had the corn beef hash which came with one egg, potato, and vegetables. Unfortunately I wasn't allowed to choose what kind of potatoes or vegetables I got. The waiter told me it would be a mix of broccoli, zucchini, and more, but it came out with cooked spinach? And I was expecting hash browns but I got a boiled potato. Neither the spinach or the potato was very good, but the hash was amazing! My dad ordered a lobster and crab dish, and mentioned that while the dish tasted good, the crab was not shelled very well. His dish came with the long potatoes which weren't great, they were like very thick fries.

I walked in around 6pm and I was immediately seated at the bar, in my opinion, that's the best seats!  I looked around and felt I time traveled back to 1849! The feeling on its own is reason enough to come here.\n\nMy mission was to try their oyster and sand dab. The waiter recommended the Rockefeller instead of the trio and the sand dab over every other fish. This is my first time so I went with it, and boy was I rewarded handsomely on a culinary expedition..\n\nThe Oyster Rockefeller was baked with plenty of cheese and spinach with a hint of Pernod.They were tasty, even though the size of the oyster was very small, it was very good. Wiping the shell up with a piece of Sourdough bread was a great way to finish each oyster. There were 6 and 1 baked tomato in the center. I knew I also have the Sand dab coming so I offer the person next to me a taste of the oyster and to help me managed all the food a little bit.\n\nThe sand dab, came de-boned. with a serving of steamed cauliflower, Brussels sprout tossed with butter and chunky steak cut fries and a side of tartar sauce.  The fish was pan fried, with crispy exterior coating that was just right. This is my first sand dab, I must said I liked it, and I liked it a lot! The flesh is very delicate, mild and tender. Pairing it with a tab of the house made tartar sauce reminded why I was hooked on this heavenly combination all those years ago when mom first introduced me to Fish and chips, except this is on a completely new level.\n\nI spend my time finishing my sand dab, the only caution I must made is that there are residual bones here and there, so do be careful. Take your time chewing the crunchy bits while looking out for bones was a experience on its own.  The Tadich veggie is better than most, I loved the B.Sprouts, the fries with the Tartar sauce was just the way I like it. everything was so simply made it was great.\n\nOver all, the bill came to just shy of $50, looking back, compare to Yank Sing, this was money well spent.

A restaurant with a menu almost as extensive as its history it was with much debate and discussion with Anton that I eventually decided on the Cioppino as opposed to the sand dabs or the thermidor but taking him on his word that 'every first timer should try the cioppino and the sourdough' I can only say that if the other options were somehow better I'd be shocked as the garlicky tomato based broth overflowing with fresh seafood was undoubtedly an archetype of the dish - impressive on its own and all the better when sopped up with the supplied garlic bread or the tangy sourdough.  Never one to pass on dessert I again deferred to my server once the cioppino consisted of a dry bowl and a few clam shells but this time when he recommended the rice custard pudding I did the only thing logical by taking a large scoop of the creamy caramelized rice flan to go while indulging in a square of the restaurant's sourdough saturated in custard and topped with boozy caramel plus whipped cream right there at the counter.", "author": "Michael U."}

Our waiter was extremely rude, condescending, and seemed to talk down to everybody.  My party thought it was just to us, but then we paid attention to his interaction with others and noticed similar behavior.  Oddly, this didn't provide us with much comfort.\n\nThe food was just mediocre.  Fish quality was just mediocre.  One thing - all dishes were heavily salted.  We ordered the following: \n\nprawn cocktail appetizer - shrimp was overcooked and rough \nclam chowder - WAY too much starch!\nseafood plate - pretty good.  the tartar sauce is different and tasty\nbranzino - just ok\ncrab louie salad - pretty large portion.  very salty even with the dressing served on the side.  \n\nBetween the brash and condescending service, mediocre and salty food, and strange vibe in the restaurant (feels like a Republican convention given the clientele that was there), I think it takes a special kind of person to enjoy this restaurant.", "author": "Anna M."}

It originated in SF (and Tadich has been doing it for I think 160+ years) and the one here is truly an experience that will connect you to your time in this wonderful city. I've had excellent cioppino at Swan Oyster Depot, but this will forever be my favorite and one of my top 5 memorable dishes of all time. Be sure to share this experience with the best of company.\n\n***\n\nPlease trust that you need not read anymore than this: if a $30 dish is in your price range and you enjoy hearty, flavor-rich stew, go try this cioppino.\n\n***\n\nIf you've already penciled it into your calendar and are seeking validation and increased anticipation of your (excellent) choice, then read on for details.\n\nEntering the long and narrow restaurant, you were invariably see a crowd of people in front and lined shoulder-to-shoulder behind the diners at the bar along the right hand wall, most of whom are clutching wine glasses while waiting. The decor brings you back in time, refined yet understated, with a long U-shaped bar comprising the main dining space. Do not come in your ill-fitting t-shirt and hoodie--not because the Financial District locale pretentiously demands business-casual attire, but because you respect the tradition and dignity of this place, and the experience it will grant you.\n\nThe servers behind the bar and generally grandfatherly, and seemingly no one has changed position from the first time I ate here 7 years ago. You will be seated and treated to delicious sourdough bread and butter, and have the opportunity to choose from a solid wine collection. You will not impress a date with how much you know about whatever chateaus on the wine menu, you will be impressed with the quality of the night's house chardonnay.\n\nOn to the cioppino. You will receive a plastic bib; wearing it is optional. You will instinctively reach first for one of the two hunks of garlic bread toast rising from the stew, because the assemblage of seafood in the center is initially overwhelming. The bread, softened at the base by the briny tomato broth, is sublime. \n\nEach element of the cioppino is fresh and cooked well. The broth has enough of a salty bite to engage your palette and bring all the chunky seafood elements together, and is layered and rich on its own. You may not be able to finish the entire dish. But you sure as hell will try.", "author": "Eddie L."}

They have been long time fans of this restaurant and have been coming for several years.\nThis was my first time at the restaurant last night. We arrived about 5:45 pm, and\nthe man at the front informed us that we could either wait 15 minutes for a table, or be seated right away but next to the kitchen. We opted to wait for a table. \n\nThe first thing the waiter did was inform us of several items that they had run out of. We were a bit surprised, being a Saturday night, relatively early, running out of clams and tri tip, two main dishes for a restaurant. Being as flexible as we are, we were okay with that, just a bit puzzled.\n\nI ordered the Spinach and cheese ravioli with lobster meat on top. It was fantastic and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves ravioli and lobster.

However, it may be the loudest restaurant. The Tadich Grill positively explodes with energy and noise. \n\nWe went on a Monday night after calling ahead and discovering the restaurant doesn't accept reservations.  It took about 20 minutes to be seated and we were promptly welcomed by a server who had to be at least 70 years old and acted like a man half his age, quick-witted and fast-moving. The only hiccup was when he failed to inform my wife that her dish was quite hot. She burned her finger.\n\nThe food was ok. My wife enjoyed her oysters Rockefeller (pre-burn) and plowed through a baked crab and prawns casserole (the offender) with her digit resting in a glass of ice water. I had grilled Alaskan halibut that was a little disappointing - perhaps a bit undercooked and lacking the strong texture of the very best fillets.

One of the 4 at our table had the cioppino and is a self proclaimed expert who raved about it. I had the salmon & swordfish grilled combo, nicely prepared  and just the right amount of food. That is where the goodness ends.\n\nOne of the kids (oops she is a junior in high school and has the proud status as a self imposed vegetarian) wanted a plain small salad, no fish, no shrimp, no crab ... basically nothing that ever walked, swam or crawled. The experience takes a quite unexpected turn. She was informed by the waiter with a heavy Ukrainian or Russian accent, that the small salad didn't meet the per person minimum charge that this stalwart joint requires. Had that foot soldier - matter of fact type of voice and demeanor. \n\nProceeding to up-sell her, she cried uncle and ordered it with crab & shrimp (turned out to be mostly shrimp)..... on the side. Happily, the smallish pile was up for grabs at the table. I don't recall the \"minimum\" which the waiter proudly said was posted somewhere. \n\nPricing is as robust as their longevity; but wouldntya think that with four people at a table for four you could cut a kid some slack who wants a small green salad for lunch? The bill w/o the salad was about $80, w/ salad with the sea creature meat $91. Upsell on the salad took it from about $ 7 to $11 a whopping $4 more dollars to get a tip on. I couldn't help but wonder if the kid, wasn't hungry and just ordered, say, and heaven forbid, a glass of water or a soda? Would the kid be asked to leave the restaurant? Asked to shuck oysters for an hour? I doubt John Tadich had a minimum at lunch time, maybe a seance is in order to answer that question.\n\nTo me age is not the only requirement for respect. I think I'll leave Tadich's vintage feel and misconceived notion on per person minimums to the tourists seeking the\" true SF\" grill experience; the other folks on an expense account with money to grill, ooops I meant burn.\n\nWhen I get that itch for an old, really old,  stalwart restaurant I head to The Old Clam House: http://www.theoldclamhousesf.com/ , serving up meals since 1861 IN THE SAME LOCATION, and in the same building (ok, they replaced the awning after about 125 years). 1861 was the year Lincoln, the guy on the penny was inaugurated president and 10 Years before John Tadich arrived in America, and 51 years before \"Tadich Grill\" was opened in 1912.  Now all of this math heads up the grill flue if you use the \"new math\" as displayed on the Tadich website proclamation that they are the \"oldest restaurant in California\". Well true if you believe that a Coffee Stand under a different name and ownership that had a grill (read the ancestor of the BBQ), that cooked fish counts as Tadich's. That was 2 or 3 locations before where Tadich is today, and each under a different name. That's why above \"in the same location \" is in all caps. Wow, I just realized that if you extend this logic, and used the Ohlone Indians who were grilling fish around the San Francisco bay beginning in the year 500 (or there abouts), you could claim to have a restaurant \"Over 1500 years old\", just by serving fish.\n\nThe name thing, is particularly curious due to a prominent statement on their website: \"A restaurant by any other name has no relationship to Tadich Grill\".\n\nI guess this is \"much ado about nothing\", since every one knows what the real \"San Francisco Treat\" is, and there even was a jingle to prove it. Ahhh, but that gets into \"truth in advertising\"; wouldn't want to go there.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

The bar seating situation is a bit awkward because it's first come first serve. Imagine hungry pier 39 seagulls scavenging for food. \n\nFinally, we just waited for a table and was seated about an hour later. We started with some oysters on a half shell and the clam broth. I ordered the cioppino and the mister ordered sea scallops that came with steamed veggies. The cioppino is well done and probably one of the top cioppinos available in the city. It was hearty and came with a great portion of seafood. It may be too much for one person to finish. The toasty buttery bread is to die for dipped into the broth (be sure not to eat all of the bread in the beginning or you won't have room to finish your food!). The sea scallops were tender and creamy, but we found that the entree had way too many for one person to finish.\n\nOverall, great place for good old traditional dining.

My wife and I opted to eat an early lunch. This place opens at 11:30 am and we arrived roughly at 11:40 am and were seated quick. Our server was very stoic but professional. Just remember that when coming to this place, it's more of an old school feel. Very professional, waiters looking in the mirror to fix their ties but not too many smiles; sort of like a rustic steak house feel, which isn't a bad thing. \n\nI hopped right on the cioppino and the flavors were on point. Of course it's always about quality over quantity but when you have both, it's even better. The amount of seafood was wonderful. I know seafood can be expensive so I really appreciate that huge muscles, clams, pieces of fish, shrimp etc found in my cioppino. It also is accompanied by two toasted pieces of garlic bread, which you can used to dip into that wonderful sauce.\n\nMy wife had the sea bass with brussel sprouts and potatoes. The potatoes were average at best. They were kind of like a really fat french fry, if that makes any sense. It comes with a rice pilaf if you don't like potatoes.

However, I am not sure I will come back as tonight was the polar opposite from last.\n\nMy friends from New York City flew in for my birthday and took me here because they knew how much I had liked it.\n\nSo the review:\n\nNo wait, walked right in, sat at a 4 top.  Awesome, too good to be true.\nAbout 12 minutes had gone by before we were even greeted by a waiter.\nBread was dropped off in a rush with no words.\nAnother 5-6 minutes went by, he came for our drink order and rushed off.\nAnother 10 minutes went by, our drinks came but our order was not taken.\nFinally, after how many more minutes, he came by to take our order.\nThe food came out quickly.  I ordered a dinner salad and my friend ordered a bowl of chowder, pre main course.\n\nHalfway through my dinner salad, my boyfriend noticed something moving on a piece of bay shrimp.  It was a very alive and green caterpillar -  or fat worm.  I wasn't grossed out, in fact, I was glad it was still moving as I looked at it to be fresh greens, but my party was not amused.  After flagging down three employees, we were ignored, given the \"wait a minute\" finger and overlooked.  Finally, when our waiter came by with our entrees, we let him know and he took the plate, asked if I wanted another which I declined.\n\nFinally, the main course.\n\nMy Chilean Sea Bass was good, not as good as before.  Seemed like it sat for awhile and had time to cool off.\nMy boyfriend's ravioli was ok, he said it wasn't as good as he's had there before either.\nMy friend's pasta with clams was over cooked, mushy and clams were on the fishy side...very disappointing...and her husband's Rainbow Trout was probably the only satisfactory dish.\n\nThe clam pasta was not touched, my boyfriend shared his ravioli with my friend and both fish dishes were finished.  \n\nAfter one last table check, we declined coffee/dessert as we just wanted to go home at this point.  Our check came and the worm salad was still on as well as a drink that we hadn't ordered.  When told that it wasn't ours, the waiter said that it was from our bar tab - which we had never been to, nor did we order a drink.  \n\nI can understand when it's been a long shift and you're tired, but one of the most redeeming qualities in people is when they're forthcoming and humble.

When people ask what's SF like... show them this place. Old, refined, a little bit stodgy, a little bit boisterous, and a restaurant where the main attraction is the bar. \n\nI've dined at the bar, I've drank at the bar, and my last experience was with a group so we dined in one of those private nooks with a table of 6. I have to say... those partitions are genius -- it makes the experience far more private and liberating. If you're not prepared, the stodginess of the server team can catch you off guard, but just know going into it... it's all older gentlemen that will take care of you here. \n\nIf there's a place to check out Cioppino, it's here. If there's a place to sit at the bar and have a gin martini lunch, it's here. While the prices at first glance are stifling, all the dishes are large enough for two -- or even three -- to split. \n\n\"When you have lunch at a bar, it makes you feel like you're getting things done.\" Don Draper.

I can't tell you how pleasant it is to be able to have complete confidence knowing I am enjoying the best Crab Louie in town, sitting at the beautiful bar and enjoying a properly made, no-nonsense drink. The atmosphere can vary depending on the time of day (I recommend saturday lunch for peace & quiet) - but the room is gorgeous to be in at any time. The bartenders are always attentive, the food may not be particularly innovative, but it is fresh, local, and always perfectly prepared. Expect to see a bit of the old San Francisco style here-- no reservations, no hand-holding or coddling, no fussing. What a relief in this day of over-complicated and pompous service! I always sit at the bar (it's one of the longest in town) and recommend that for one or two people. They also have more private booth seating for larger groups. The Petrale Sole & Salmon are also delicious. It's difficult not to order the Crab Louie every time (with a giant bowl of French fries on the side).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-29", "description": "A San Francisco classic ... some may be put off by the unique system of not allowing reservations. We ate there on a Saturday night and arrived at 9 p.m. just before the restaurant officially closed at 9:30 p.m. Technically they close the doors at 9:30 p.m. but if you get in before then, they will serve you as soon as a table opens.\n\nThere are only a handful of tables and booths here ... which is why it is not impossible to wait 45 minutes to an hour during peak times. There is a big 'lunch counter' as well with barstools and if places open up at this long counter, you can sit there without a reservation. However, this does kind of make for an uncomfortable situation as I have often seen people standing behind the stools of someone eating dessert waiting to get their spot at the counter.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to sit at the counter but when I am there with guests, it is next to impossible to find 3 or 4 stools open, so we wait for the table.\n\nThe food here is fresh and the recipies have been time tested. The Cioppino is some of the best you will get in San Francisco. I have had better than the last time I went, but I am chalking that up to an off-night. Normally it is full of hearty scallops and shrimp, crab and pieces of white fish. The tiny salad shrimp being thrown in there, I am not a huge fan of ...\n\nThe sour dough bread is amazing ... a San Francisco thing.\n\nDrinks are stiff and inexpensive. $8 for a Martini and two will knock your socks off. The menu is very extensive. They have mostly fish but they do sear steaks, etc. I always order the Cioppino which comes in a giant dish. Easily enough for two people if you are dipping bread.\n\nThe restaurant is chaotic, old school and interesting. Some people would be very put off by busy nights and the mayhem that their system produces. I'd recommend a slower weeknight if crowds bother you.\n\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco ... and one of the oldest. On the inside not much has changed since the 1930s. The waitors are usually pretty good ... although the last one I had (hispanic gentleman) was constantly pushing drinks on us and because we came in a half hour before close, he was rushing us through the meal. Never had this happen before ... normally they are very laid back. Give it a try if you are downtown and want history and good food.", "author": "E T."}

Actually, it's the oldest restaurant in the state!  Be sure to spend some time reading Tadich Grill's history that dates back to 1849, very interesting.\n\nWe bellied up to the bar and ordered dinner.  We started with the lobster bisque and Boston (cream based) clam chowder (other choice is Coney Island or tomato based, we're guessing).  Both soups were substantial and hearty.  The lobster bisque had nice sized chunks of lobster goodness, while the clam chowder was probably the best we've ever tasted.  The chunky bread was also a perfect accompaniment to our soups on a cold, windy day.\n\nFish is their mainstay, so we ordered the King Salmon that came with fries and steamed veggies; and the fresh Halibut.  Both dishes were perfectly prepared, extremely moist and good sized offerings.  Although we didn't have room for dessert (which doesn't happen very often, believe me), their selections looked insane:  Rice Custard Pudding; Bourbon Bread Pudding with an amazing looking caramel sauce; thick and dense NY style cheesecake; Chocolate Raspberry Truffle; and the list goes on.  Our only disappointment was that we had none of these.\n\nThe guy next to me ordered their signature Seafood Cioppino which looked amazing with clams, prawns, scallops, bay shrimp, crabmeat and white fish.\n\nThe tenured waiters in white coats are quick and efficient.

It boasts the antique milky glass fixtures, the all wooden interior - booths, bar, floor, alcoves - you name it and the Waiters in White with Waistcoats.\n\nThis ALSO means that the cuisine is nowhere near innovative, but it is the ultimate in comfort and classical style. They are known for their cioppino and once you get it, you will understand. This is heavily loaded with all sorts of seafood and naked crab lumps and the broth is so flavorful, you may even need more bread than the sourdough loaf that is already waiting for you at your table to soak all its not-to-be-wasted taste.\n\nAncient dishes like \"Newberg\" and \"Thermidor\" are alive and kicking here and are worth the novelty to give them a spin. So far, my favorite is the simple seafood saute with crab and prawns served with buttery rice and steamed vegetables.\n\nLet me tell you, you will pay dearly for this throw back in time - but the seafood is fresh and worth it, the drinks are strong and the waiters are professionals. It's worth a go and your parents and or grandparents will think you are the height of fashion should you waltz them through the door.", "author": "Katie W."}

I am always fascinated by how the waiters work. These are true professionals and not college kids doing a summer gig. Most of the staff has worked here for decades. \n\nThe waiters are efficient in telling you about the menu and the specials. They are also great at making recommendations, taking your orders, serving your food promptly, etc.--stuff you expect them to do. Here's an example of the superior service I've witnessed: I was sitting at the counter and next to me was a couple. As the waiter brought out their two dinners, one of the customers had just turned around to head to the restroom (and didn't see the waiter coming). Without a word, he set down the one dinner for the customer who was still there and put the other dinner under the heater to make sure it didn't get cold. The minute he saw the customer walk back from the restroom, he took the dinner and put it in front of her as she sat down. He didn't make a big deal out of it; it just showed that he's been honing his attentiveness for a number of years.", "author": "Vince L."}

Loosely translated.\n\nA: It really wasn't necessary to invite us out. It's not cheap here, you know. \n\nC: Nonsense! We're so happy you two can help us simple Midwest folks from the Windy City find a decent place to dine. This is a famous spot, huh? Around since 1849. Impressive!\n\nB: Well, technically that's true. But also not. They've only been at this location since the 60s, before that they were elsewhere in the city, they changed ownership, wrangled over who would keep the name, and had profit-centered conflicts all too typical of the capitalist free market. \n\nA: Could you please drop the political economics for once? It's ruining my appetite, and I am looking forward to a serious seafood feast right about now. \n\nD: Oh let him talk. I like listening to your friend. He's so passionate about his views. I can respect that. And I've never eaten at a Croatian restaurant before. What should I get? The oysters Rockefeller? Or maybe the Lobster Thermidor? And what exactly are sand dabs, anyway? Wow! Looks like the menu for the Titanic.\n\nA: I don't think this place is like that. I mean, it's not really Croatian in that they don't specialize in regional or ethnic dishes. They are basically an all-American seafood, meat, and potato sort of place with a good bar, decent beer and wine selections, and a throwback, classy sort of wood-paneled atmosphere. It's not like a stereotypical Greek or Italian restaurant, in that sense. \n\nC: Well I don't know about you two gentlemen, but D. and I are ordering the Tadich Seafood Platter. A little bit of everything, from raw oysters and crab to smoked trout and marinated herring and shrimp cocktail. It will go great with a  few pints of Sierra Nevada. Hey! Is that Condi Rice on her second Dirty Martini? That's what I'm talkin' about, sistah!\n\nA: (ignores him). \n\nB: You know, it's hard to say exactly what a Croatian restaurant even should be like. The country has had a complicated history. Until recently, it was part of the Habsburg empire. After the First World War it became part of Yugoslavia. When it gained independence, it was under the influence of the Nazis (a touchy subject, still), and after that it was incorporated back into Yugoslavia under Tito. By the time you get to the 1990s and Croatia reemerges as a sovereign state, the whole mess in Bosnia and Kosovo further disrupted things. Now things are quieter, of course, but the bullet holes and emotional scars still very much remain. \n\nD: Well, we're hoping to take an Adriatic cruise next summer and see Dubrovnik. The pictures are gorgeous!\n\nB: Pictures can be deceiving, especially the glossy touristy kinds. There are still a lot of ghosts to deal with from the war. But that's true all over Europe, and beyond. Most people don't even know that the worst armed conflict in recent times happened in Central Africa, while Yugoslavia was falling apart at the seams.\n\nA: And no history lectures, either! Shut up and eat, for once in your life, OK?\n\nC: Look, here comes the seafood. Wow, that's a lot to handle!\n\nD: It sure is. They really pile it on the plates, don't they? No minimalist presentation here or gastronomic-molecular food display. This is about eating good in the neighborhood.\n\nB: (laughs). Cool pop cult reference. Such a public health catastrophe waiting to happen. You won't see me in THAT suburban 'hood anytime soon ... I'll see your Applebees and raise you an IHOP: come hungry, leave honkey ;-)\n\nA: (snorts Sierra Nevada through his nose). Now that's more like it! Keep Marx and Engels in their cages for a while and show me some corporate franchise tagline luv!\n\nB: (slurps a raw oyster, then continues) Don't get me started, 'cause then I'll never stop. How about this one? WalMart: Always low wages. Always.\n\nA: McDs: I'm leavin' it! Touche, amigo.\n\nC: (confused). Poor Sam Walton. And Ray Kroc, too. Such good businessmen. They deserve a statue or something.\n\nB: (undeterred) DeBeers: A blood diamond is forever. Back atcha ...\n\nA: (makes a tennis backhand motion) Nike: Just Outsource It.\n\nB: With a name like Smuckers, it has to have corn syrup. (plays the air banjo) High fructose, that is ... \n\nD: I've got one! Timex: It takes a licking to keep him ticking. \n\nC: (turns bright red) That's just not a proper thing for a lady to say.\n\nD: You didn't mind last night, you crazy-sexy Dirty Harry, you ... \n\nB: Hey, it's nothing I haven't seen before. I grew up in Berkeley. \n\nA: Where else, ya' pinko? (winks). Let's wrap things up, shall we? In honor of our meal here at Tadich, I'll go old school on your a#$. Taco Bell. Before they started thinking outside the bun, they urged patrons to \"make a run for the border.\" How un-PC can you get?

It's presentation was less than spectacular and more reminiscent of homecooking.  However, the taste was awesome!!!  My sea bass was soft, flaky and melted in my mouth.  Every part of my dish had a unique flavour that surprised me at each bite....the sauce, the prawn's seasoning, the fish.

It was a Friday night, very busy. We got a table with privacy walls and were very excited for the upcoming experience. My wife and I don't drink so we ordered sparkling water from the server who barley acknowledged us. He was visibly perturbed by the order. I caught him, barley, before he walked away to also order some appetizers, Crab cake and pasta with meat sauce. Again he seemed annoyed by this order. While waiting for appetizers and considering entrees we both said we felt like the server saw us an annoyance because we did not order expensive drinks and probably thought we were having appetizers for dinner. He came back with the appetizers, slamming the pasta down and tossing the spoons at the bowl while turning and leaving before they hit the table. He returned and asked if we would like anything else. I asked him, \"What do you recommend?\" He shortly responded, \"People like the Cioppino.\" I told him we needed another minute to decide and again he was annoyed. At this point my wife was boiling and refused order one more thing. Too bad because the crab cake was good, pasta average, and we were looking forward to some fresh seafood. When came back and asked \"What else?\" I responded, \"I think we've had enough.\" He then says, as though he expected this answer, \"Just so you know we have an $11per person minimum.\" I told him we thought he was very rude and that is why we are leaving. He pressed why we thought that and things got even more uncomfortable as the privacy walls now felt like an interrogation room. I told him the comment about the $11 is exactly how we felt he was thinking from the start. He did apologize and I thanked him for that but still asked for the bill. He pressed further \"Even after I apologized you still want to go?\" I told him yes and at this point we officially were the most uncomfortable we had ever been in a restaurant. I almost expected him to keep arguing with me until I ordered more food but he eventually brought the check.

Family recommended we grab lunch there and we had a 'list' of recommendations including the Bloody Mary's, steamers, crab cocktail, san dabs (lightly pan fried fish) and chowder. After having dined there myself now, I would have only ordered a double order of steamers. The best steamers (with garlic and butter as they are on the menu as 'steamers' or 'garlic and butter') I've had in a long time. The Bloody Mary's could have been spicier but they did have plenty of vodka. Maybe you can order a spicy version? The San Dabs were delicious. I would skip the crab cocktail and the chowder as they weren't so fabulous as to pay the high price. So in hindsight, the perfect lunch for us would have been the steamers (with the delicious bread to dip in the broth) and a couple of cold beers rather than the Bloody Marys. The other items were not really worth the high price. But definitely a fun lunch in San Fran and the steamers were the best! Now I know!", "author": "Heidi S."}

The food came quick and the quality was great.  However, as soon as we finished our dessert we were told by the host and the waiter to leave.  We were literally told that they had people waiting so we had to go.  We couldn't believe it. As soon as the tip was given and check was taken, the waitress was horrible and basically said that our experience didn't matter and that we were taking too long.  The thing is we were literally only waiting for our uber driver to pick us up, which was a 7 minute wait.  And all four of us order cocktails and got a second round. Also got an appetizer plus the four entrees. The most expensive white wine and dessert. Apparently all that wasn't enough to be able to relax after eating for 10 minutes after the meal.   I am very disappointed in this restaurant and even though I thought the food was great, I will not return.", "author": "Nick F."}

From the moment you walk in and see the long bar that is filled with people and the crowded dining area, you can sense the feeling of excellence. This is not your run-of-the-mill restaurant. They want to provide the best possible experience by quickly serving each customer. The service is quick and accurate. These waiters' are professionals at what they do and they know how to serve a customer, with strong wit and quick service. \n\nThis was my second time back, I highly recommend trying any of their daily specials, but make sure to get here early so they don't run out of ingredients.

While I enjoyed the cioppino which had plenty of fish, jumbo prawns, clams, and mussels in a hearty tomato broth, my wife's crab-stuffed red snapper was bland, unseasoned, and overcooked. I had a couple bites of her dish and was thoroughly unimpressed even though mine was actually pretty good, and more than I could finish.

I ended up deferring to Barry the waiter, who's worked there for 22 years and knows his stuff. (He looks kinda like one of the Observers from \"Fringe,\" to be honest.) When I told him I needed to avoid gluten & wheat, he recommended the Chilean sea bass and started me off with the lettuce & avocado salad. The salad was delicious, chock full of veggies and avocado and not too heavy on lettuce. The sea bass was awesome as well: nice and mild for me, the picky eater with a delicate constitution. Barry even had the chef plate it with boiled potatoes instead of the rice, because of how the rice was prepared/seasoned.

The dining options are open tables or secluded tables closed in with wooden walls. We had one of the secluded tables since it was a large group. \nThey don't take reservations and it was a 40 minute wait, which is fine since we took the pager and went next door for wine at Michael Mina.

We receive some bread after a little while, good flavor, but cold and a little hard. Which is usually typical in San Francisco restaurants. \nI started assessing the menu and what to choose. I knew I would come out with a hole blown through my wallet no matter what I got, especially since I wanted seafood. After much indecisive frets and the waiter getting impatient with our table (wait, who's paying who? I'm sorry I didn't know I was catering to your needs and wants-all inside thoughts of course) I chose the seafood saut\u00e9. While waiting for the food the table decided on splitting a bottle of wine and apparently we decided our fate in not getting refills for our water. \nThe food came out, smelled and looked delicious. One person in the group got the red snapper, it was pretty tasteless and lackluster. Which is sad for the price point being near $30. The seafood saut\u00e9 was very flavorful and cooked just right with the 2 large scallops, the shrimp and the crab. The sauce was a little much, I could have done with less. After we all finished eating our food (that we were never even asked how everything turned out), we looked at the desserts and decided we were done. \nThe waiter finally comes back around with one check and when we asked to split it he refused to do so.

Waiters in white waiter coats.  You NEVER see that ANYWHERE! \n\nThe wait staff are a little abrupt, but it's all part of the atmosphere, and if you don't have a sense of humor, or can't take a little sarcasm, then you may find the whole experience a little overwhelming.

They want you to order, order quickly, enjoy your food, and then free the space for the 30 people waiting for it.\n\nThe ciopino is incredible, and huge.

But you are in San Francisco, where pricey is the norm and cheap is a challenge.\n\nI have been here a few times. I love the nostalgia that Tadich inspires: the black-and-white tile floor, the tuxedoed waitstaff, the old wood bar and booths. I personally like sitting by the bar and watch the bartenders preparing drinks and having conversations with them (when they have a chance to, that is) or my neighbor (which helps me forget that SF can be such a cold city sometimes). Bonus: They have hooks under the counter so I can hang my purse and jacket.\n\nMy favorite dish is the cioppino.  It is seafood heaven, with the mussels, clams, shrimp, fish, etc.  It is a pretty generous portion so you will not leave hungry.  My second favorite dish would be the pan-fried scallops.  It is cooked perfectly and without too much fuss as to mess with the flavor of the seafood. The calamari steak is also quite good and their clam chowder is one of my favorites.\n\nIf I can afford to, I will be here at least every two weeks.

I needed something warm and NOTHING is better than a bowl of hot Cioppino on cold day! Ding, ding - time for Tadich Grill!\n\nSince I was solo finding a spot at the bar wasn't a problem - I actually prefer sitting here because you get the full experience, the sense you are stepping back in time. The bar top is probably 100 years old, the chairs even older. The decor minimal but timeless, and the waiters curt, professional and appreciative. \n\nI went with the classics - bowl of clam chowder and the Cioppino (along with a pint of beer). Unfortuantely they were out of the white chowder so I had the pink. While this is essentially Manhattan clam chowder it's quite tasty, if not overly salty this time around. However, this is where the Tadich condiments come in handy. A squirt of lemon, some hot sauce and the chowder is perfect.\n\nSoon after the the GIANT bowl of Cioppino came out - a serving bowl filled with about a pound of clams, mussels, shrimp, and fish, held together with a delicious tomato-based broth that is laced with garlic, onions, bay leaves and other spices. Each bite is an explosion of flavors, each better than the last. To top it off, Tadich gives you the ultimate accessory with it, two slices of garlic bread to sop up all the extra broth!\n\nThis is the perfect SF meal - it represents the character, history and essence of San Francisco and should not be missed.", "author": "Andy B."}

At first, I was a little thrown off by all the middle age to old men in lab coats but they run a well oiled machine. \n\nI am so used to going to a restaurant in the financial district at lunch and being hurried through my meal (Per Diem told us that our reservation allowed us 1 hour from the time of the reservation - pressure!) The server walked up and basically gave the impression that not only did we not need to rush but that rushing would do us no good as long as he was in charge. It was wonderful to just sit and enjoy the meal and not worry about how long we were there.\n\nThe food: \nWe started with the Caesar which was good. It came with anchovies on top which my companion loved but I avoided like the plague which worked out well. For the second course we had the white clam chowder. This was one thing I loved at my family's restaurant so I may be too picky here but it was very fishy tasting. Not in a bad way but it was too strong for me. For our meals we both got the grilled trout with steak fries and veggies. The fish was cooked perfectly, the tartar sauce was great, the veggies were nicely cooked. The fries were another story. They were done well but I felt like with a meal so nice, it should have come with something other than fries. I will ask to substitute next time because fries aren't really my thing at a $30 per plate restaurant. \n\nOverall, the food was really tasty, the service was great, food came out quickly, and the bread was good.

I decided to lunch it up w/ a good Yelp bud of mine and agreed to meet @11:30AM-early. Thank God we did because there were no seats readily available, and come 15 minutes into lunch people were standing waiting around for spots at the bar to open up.  Good sign: people standing around actually waiting for a bar spot! \n\nAmbiance: Old school. Looks like somewhere a meeting between the Godfather and his mobster crew would go down.  There were lots of table seats, bar seats, and even private booth seats.. all were completely occupied during our lunch visit.  What's up w/ the lab coats though? Everyone- from the hosts, waiters, to the cleaning crew were fitted in what looked like white lab coats. \n\nFood: Ordered the Sand Dabs (to cross off the 7x7 list) and my pal ordered the Half Avocado w/ Dungeness crab salad.  \n\nThe Sand Dabs are fried fillet strips, topped w/ a light cr\u00e8me sauce, saut\u00e9ed brussel sprouts, pieces of thick steak fries, and a heaving cup portion of their thick tartar sauce. A few Yelpers reviewed that it was the tartar sauce that made the dish because of the yummy chunks of blue cheese. To the contrary, the waiter broke it down as some simpleton ingredients: mayo, pickles, potatoes, and no blue cheese. Hmm okay, not quite the description I expected. It sounded pretty plain actually. \n\nThe Crab Louie Salad, however, looked pretty generous considering it was a \"half\" salad. It was filled w/ the works: fresh avocado, tons of fresh crab, lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, beets, olives, etc. My friend raved that every bite included a piece of chunky crab meat.

Beautiful, men's club style dining room, fresh sourdough and butter to accompany your drink as you consider the menu. There's a lot to like. I visited most recently a couple of weeks ago with my wife. She had, and enjoyed, the sauteed scallops, served with a vegetable medley and a rice pilaf. It was one of those \"expensive but worth it\" ($31) dishes. My dinner was an entirely different experience. \n\nI noticed a fish on the menu that I had seen on prior visits, but never had tried, the sand dabs. I asked the waiter about them, and he said that they were \"baby flounder,\" and that they were very good. I'm careful eating fish, and I know that the occasional fish bone is part of the deal. This, however, was something else entirely. I only had about 4 or 5 small bites of the three \"filets\" served to me. Each bite contained MANY bones, as in more bones than meat in each bite. I stopped with about 2  1/2 of the 3 \"filets\" remaining on the plate, because I could not continue, and eating was no longer feasible or pleasant, as my gum was bleeding where a fish bone had punctured it. For what it is worth, even the fried potatoes served with my dish were nasty: though browned on the exterior, they appeared to have sat on a steam table too long, rendering them soggy. That said, they were not even cooked all the way through. \n\nThere's lots of fault to go around: our waiter seemed completely uninterested in anything except turning the table, and said nothing about the bones in the sand dabs when I asked about them, though I said I'd never tried them. The prep staff either didn't filet the dabs, or did a terrible job of it. The bus person picked up my plate on which most of the fish was untouched, and either didn't communicate that to our waiter, or our waiter just didn't care. I'm deeply bothered by this experience at a restaurant I had enjoyed and at which I expected an \"expensive but worth it\" dinner. I used to go to Tadich each time I was in the Bay Area.

There was room at the counter, so we opted for dinner up there where we could enjoy some people-watching. It was not yet 5 PM, so the place was not crowded - indeed, it seemed that that restaurant was filled with locals who visited frequently.

It's not only the oldest restaurant in San Francisco but actually the oldest in California as well. \n\nIf those walls could talk, just imagine! It's a business that has lived through the Great Depression, World War II and not one but TWO major earthquakes. All the while managing to remain a family-owned business. The same family, in fact. For 165 years.\n\nWith all the hipsters talking about the latest trendy spots with names like \"SPQR\" and \"State Bird Provisions\", I have to smile to myself at Tadich's longevity. Call it a tourist spot if you will, but I challenge these newer places to remain in business for 165 years. It takes a lot to be a small business in San Francisco, or anywhere for that matter. It's really quite an accomplishment to survive one year, let alone sixteen decades. And there is good reason for their success.\n\nI myself am not a tourist. I've lived here 27 years. After discovering it a couple of years ago, Tadich Grill has become a favorite of mine. It's a great, very relaxing place to share dinner with someone special as I've done several times now, and it's also a great place to come alone too. They have a long, wooden, old-fashioned bar that you can just plop yourself down at and order a full meal. The servers are true gentlemen who wear neckties and stand politely with their hands behind their backs, ready to be attentive to your every need but in a manner that sets you at ease. They have sweet little plates of fresh sour dough bread laid out to greet each bar stool, complete with a fresh pat of butter. It's just very inviting and elegant and thoughtfully presented. Tonight, on my way home from a gorgeous walk along the water, I stopped off for some clam chowder and a shrimp cocktail. I was asked questions like, \"Would you like both dishes to arrive at once or one after the other? And, if that, which would you prefer arrives first?\". Gosh! I felt like a queen - it was truly classy treatment. And perfectly timed. The shrimp cocktail arrived the moment I'd finished the last bite of my soup.\n\nThe food is delicious, but the real draw for me is the atmosphere. Save for the computers the bartenders use to ring up the orders, there is not a trace of anything that might give away what year it is inside the restaurant. There is - happily, in my view - no TV, no modern music blaring, nothing that might make you think you've arrived at anything beyond a classic movie scene from the 1940s, 50s or 60s. I love the wooden panels on the walls, the crisp white tablecloths, the feeling of classic permanence. It's as if time really could stand still - in a GOOD way - as if, just when you wished everything didn't have to change at breakneck speed and there could be just one place that remained permanent and still standing with timeless grace, you suddenly found it. Tadich Grill is that place.", "author": "Heidi-Jane S."}

I seem to remember the layout quite differently but it has been 40 years and it makes no difference.  So a friend took me here for lunch this past week and I still love the place.  it's got reliable quality food--nothing too artsy or \"fusion.\"  I got sand dabs last time but I've heard sand dabs are being over fished so decided to not do them this time.  And got a mixed seafood salad since I did have to go back and work, didn't want to get overly full and sleepy (nap time!).  All the staff was delightful and didn't ignore us, even if we weren't drinking like whales.  My friend started with clam chowder which is homemade and looked delicious (they brought me a spoon too but I controlled myself and didn't take a taste because I just knew I'd want a bowl for myself and that along with my salad would have been too much food for me).  And he got the liver which also looked good (he said it was perfect--not too many places do liver anymore).  My salad was wonderful, full of seafood.  And although I ordered the small size, it was still pretty sizeable.  They don't rush you.  People around us seemed really happy about their food and about the service (guy at another tables did some last minute switcheroo and the waiter didn't blind an eye).  It is quite traditional so you know you're not going to walk in expecting cioppino and find that they are now adding wasabi or sriracha sauce or something else).  Nice to have a place to go that you can rely on.  Bartenders seemed to know what they are doing.  I'm glad Tadich Grill has hung around all these years and I hope it stays around forever.  It's a whole lot better service and fare then what you get in Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Kai T."}

My co-workers ordered fish, and they all looked amazing. I'll have to try it next time I come here. \n\nThe desserts don't disappoint either. My manager is very picky with his chocolate, and he said that the chocolate mousse was one of the best he had tasted in his life. \n\nI'd recommend coming here for lunch, but if you do, make sure to get there early otherwise you'll have to wait for a table.

I certainly don't expect a seafood restaurant to have a plethora of options to cater to vegetarian clientele, but I would expect a place like Tadich Grill to be able to accommodate or sub out something.   \n\nOn the particular day that I was subjected to this awful experience, I asked our waiter the following:  \n- Is it possible to order any one of the four main salads without the fish? DENIED. \n- Is it was possible to order the pasta without the meat? DENIED because the sauce also had meat). \n- Is it possible to just get the pasta w/ butter (which they must have had since there was some sitting on the table next to the bread)? DENIED\n\nFinally, I asked him: What is possible? \n\nHe said he can bring me a vegetable tray & that was all. I kindly asked if they can use the vegetables & plain pasta to make some kind pasta primavera but of course, this request was also DENIED. On top of that, he gave me attitude & made it seem like *I* was the one being difficult.\n\nWorst part...I ended up eating just bread because the vegetable tray was full of frozen vegetables that couldn't even be eaten. The rest of the people at the table were mortified for me, and given that it was a business lunch, I didn't want to cause a commotion, but looking back I wish I had said something. \n\nI'd give this zero stars if I could.

Not my fault but the waiter apparently felt the need to tell me they Never let people sit down and even called me lucky for being sat.  Like wtf dies he want me to do?

A fantastic place where lobster is still served with a side of french fries!  Tadich can get pricey, but is a great place to treat yourself to a meal.  The Cioppino is one of the best in the city, sharing the top spot with Scoma's IMHO.  I'm also a big fan of the grilled Ahi tuna, which is served steak style with romaine hearts.  In the summer it comes with a whole fresh heirloom tomato as garnish!  Just today I had the lobster thermidor.  Wonderful!  I had just read about lobster thermidor on a website about foods that used to be fashionable but have fallen out of favor.  Nuts to that!  Although the menu says it is a half lobster it is clearly more like a whole, which the server admitted!  The meat is cooked in butter, mustard and cheese and baked in the shell.  Perfect.\n\nThe servers are friendly and professional.  If you're a party of two or more, expect a wait at peak times.  Tip: singles can bypass the line and almost always find a seat at the bar.  The decor is classic old-money.  Dark wood throughout.  Many older financial district types come here for lunch.  My only complaint is how they expect someone to eat an entire lobster, fries, broccoli, roasted potatoes, a cup of chowder and a hunk of bread all as one entree?  There are worst problems to have :)", "author": "Seth G."}

They were very friendly, remembered our names and our faces, and made sure to call us promptly when our table was ready. \n\nThe menu is extensive, so I'd recommend taking a look online at the regular options. There's also a small section for daily specials. Our entire table got the cioppino, and I was told that the garlic bread that we got wasn't the usual garlic bread they serve. It tasted like frozen garlic bread that was baked and served. However, the cioppino made up for everything. It came out nice and hot, and had a heaping hill of seafood. I was definitely able to split up the cioppino into two meals.\n\nGET THERE EARLY! The line piles up fast!

I finally got our waiter's attention to tell him that in fact the shrimp will make me sick and that I had ordered Lump Crabmeat topping.

He said \"Cioppino\" then he walked away from us. Which became a common theme. You couldn't ask him more than 1 question at a time, without him running away. I understand they want to have a quick turn around, but c'mon. Later when a group of 8 was seated behind us, he spent 10 minutes going over the menu with them.... A good waiter knows tips come from big groups and small groups, so treat them equally. \n\nBesides that, the Cioppino was good, and easily enough for two, witih a small appetizer. It was very spicy, and very hot (temparture wise.)  The seafood seemed very fresh. You get 2 of of everything. 2 shrimps, 2 clams, 2 mussels, 2 scallops, and random fish. The reason it's enough for two people, is that the sauce is so good, you'll want to dip plenty of bread in it.... I'd definitely go back for that.\n\nThe calamari came out smokin hot, and was really good for the first few bites.

It would later be known as the Cold Day Restaurant because of an unpopular politician's fondness for the joint.\n\nMy adventure at Tadich began on a gorgeous Indian Summerish October afternoon after a morning spent soaking in the beauty and sunshine of Golden Gate Park.  I had some time to enjoy a long lunch before heading to the airport to catch my flight.  After striking up a conversation with some knowledgeable locals, I grabbed the boy toy by the hand and skip raced all the way there.  We eagerly plopped down at the first available seats at the long, but packed bar & ordered up our 1st (of 3) rounds of bloody marys, which were mmmm-tastic! I might have even had a 4th.\n\nOverwhelmed by page after page of titillating offerings, I looked around to see what other patrons had requested.  That's when I spotted the fellow 3 seats down enjoying a spellbinding bowl of seafood.  I urgently grabbed the barmaid, \"What is that??\" To which she replied, Cioppino. SOLD, I'll take it!  \n\nMy first bowl of Cioppino ever, but certainly not my last.  A new love affair had just started on that afternoon at Tadich Grill.  It was so perfectly prepared with a nice balance of tomato/white wine flavors and generous mixture of clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, crab, and fish, completed with 2 buttery, toasty pieces of bread.  I suppose the barmaid was quite entertained at watching me, clearly a cioppino virgin, delighting in my lustful, passionate foray of this dish because she decided to tell the original fellow about me.  I can only imagine that they were having a grand time watching me because while I was having a true sexual food experience in my head, I was not remotely sexy in my plastic seafood bib and sauce drenched paws.\n\nAs I'm licking the final soupy goodness from my fingers and rocking back with a goofy grin and full on after sex glow the barmaid comes over in a giggle frenzy.  To that I can only smile declare that I'm not even sorry, not even a little bit.  I can only attest my new found love for cioppino.  Still giggling, she informed me that my cioppino-gasm was so entertaining that the original fellow 3 seats down had picked up my entire tab & ordered a dessert for me before he left because my performance had made his day.

You're the original cold day restaurant because you were formerly named the Cold Day Restaurant. You claim to be the oldest restaurant in California and you might as well be - you pretty much deserve it.\n\nTadich Grill is the place to go if you are craving some old men wearing lab coats in your life. Everyone's sassy grandfather works here and they nail the service aspect with plenty of banter and a good old fashioned scolding if you get out of line.\n\nThe cioppino is a fabulous production for tourists who've never had it. The red clam chowder is my favorite recurring dish, and you can get it (with bread) to go on days when you just can't afford to wait.\n\nI'll also put in a good word for the bar - which serves only very classic martinis, but is a fantastic old-timey place to sit and reflect on the day that's passed (whether your day at work or your friends' day touring the city). To avoid the wait, go earlier in the week or of course earlier in the day. \n\nIf you are a tourist and you can only go to one restaurant, this is a great contender.", "author": "Megan G."}

I'm so happy I did.  This is also a place that I often recommend to out of towners when they ask me for a seafood restaurant recommendation and want an SF experience.  \n\nWe arrived a bit after 7 pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table because there were seats open at the counter.   Butter and water were waiting for us and the sourdough bread appeared as soon as we sat down.  They have an extensive menu so it took some time to figure out what I wanted to order.  Too many options...but here it's a good thing.   I knew the portions were on the generous side (ha!) so I was trying not to order too much food.  I ended up ordering the crab cake to share and the cioppino for the entree.  My companion ordered the sea bass, which came with veggies and rice.  \n\nCan we talk about that crab cake?  It was 3 to 4 inches in diameter, one inch+ high and contained NO fillers - no breadcrumbs, eggs, crackers, mayo or any other unnecessary stuff.  Just the crab, formed into a disk and pan fried.  I have never seen a crab cake with so much crab - sweet and delicate.  It came with two sauces and was deee-licious and light.  The perfect start to the meal.  \n\nThe cioppino contained a decent portion of clams, shrimp, fish, scallops and crab meat (didn't need to get my hands all messy) and came with two thick slices of garlic bread.  If you order this, you must dip that bread into the cioppino to sop up that broth.  The combination is so good!  The seabass was a larger portion than I usually see and  was well cooked.  They provide a VERY generous pour on their wine.  Goodness!  The same appears to apply to the cocktails as well.  \n\nYes, the prices are a bit on the high side, but I find that the portions and quality of the food justify it.  Some of the waiters are a bit on the crusty side, but I find that it just adds to the overall ambiance and charm.  All of our servers were great.  Beware of the minimum charge per person and the charge applied to split entrees - both are pretty high.  I will continue to recommend this restaurant to locals and out of towners.", "author": "Melissa L."}

We had dungeness crab leg cocktail, caesar salad, then we shared seafood cannelloni and their famous cioppino.  \n\nEverything was tasty, but certainly not gourmet quality.

I made my first trip out to San Francisco last week and had the privilege of spending a few days with a good friend who went out of her way to show me a great time.  \n\nDinner at Tadich Grill definitely gave me a taste of local flavor!  It was here that I had my first ever bite of fresh Dungeness crab and sampled a fish I had never even heard of before.  The fish itself was mild and flaky just as I like it, and the white wine butter sauce which accompanied it...magnificent! \n\nOur server, Paschal, was clearly at the top of his game.  I noticed that most if not all of the servers here have made a career out of waiting tables.  These men are professional and take their jobs very seriously - and they do so with class.  \n\nHaving been around for over 150 years, Tadich Grill has reached iconic status.  They don't take reservations, so if you show up on a busy night (which I assume is every night!) be prepared to wait for a table or try to snag a seat at the bar if you can find one.\n\nOh - I completely forgot to ask Paschal while I was there, so for any of you San Franciscans who know....what in the world are \"sand dabs\" ??", "author": "Allison F."}

As soon as we were handed menus we were quickly asked if we had decided on dinner.  No, we thought we'd have a cocktail first.  One in our party asked what the mixed vegetables were, the waiter looked at someone who had the mixed vegetables at the next table and announced broccoli.

No apologies.  \n\nI ordered the cioppino and it was a salty mess.   The waiter, in an obvious hurry to bring us a bill asked if there was anything else we wanted.  Dessert?  Ok, brought the menu.

It's the place to go for \"old-school\" San Francisco, and all that. Gotta be a real tourist trap, yeah?\n\nHoly crap, was I surprised.\n\nOn his recommendation, a coworker and myself wandered in just before the dinner rush, and promptly grabbed two seats at the long wooden bar. I ordered up a mineral water and a Manhattan, both of which were delivered promptly. The drink was an exercise in perfection - I'm a fan of the classic cocktails, and Tadich Grill just bloody nailed it.  My Manhattan was a pitch-perfect proportion of whiskey, bitters, and vermouth served chilled, but not ice cold.  A better cocktail I've not had in quite a while.  As a bonus, it was barely over $7, which is a relative bargain for a mixed drink in this city.\n\nI had a simple green salad tossed with oil and vinegar and a spot of ground black pepper to accompany my entree.  It was all it needed to be - basic, fresh, light, and green. For an entree, I ordered a whole grilled Mediterranean sea bass, which turned up cooked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside, light, tender and flaky on the inside.  I could have eaten two had I wanted to be a glutton.  Dressed with a little olive oil and lemon, this was an outstanding fish. The quarter-round of crusty sourdough bread Tadich provides was put to good use mopping up the plate afterward.  Bless them for serving Brussels sprouts as a side veg, too.  I love the things, though most people unfairly seem to dislike them with a passion.\n\nMy desert was a real classic - almost a relic, really - bourbon bread pudding, which was chock full of nuts, berries, raisins, and apples covered in a surprisingly not-cloying bourbon caramel sauce.  I had to stop halfway on this, and I'm not a guy who blithely discards desert.  It's really rich stuff, but it went a treat with a cup of coffee to end the meal.\n\nFor those that are used to the new school of restaurant service that includes an overly chipper server chirping the specials of the day at you after introducing themselves and kneeling down at table level to talk, I'm sure that the Tadich staff might seem a little stern.  They're not, though.  They're efficient, professional, and no-nonsense, and they're really good at keeping things moving in a busy place while not making you feel rushed.  And you know, I prefer it that way.\n\nSo, if you're visiting San Francisco, just go here.  It's one of those rare places that actually lives up to its reputation.

GOD. This was THE best clam chowder I've EVER had (yes, better than the street vendors on Fisherman's Wharf). It was very hearty yet light and everything in the chowder was cut into small pieces, so every bite was filled with yummy seafood goodness! \n\n2) Seafood Saute- absolutely phenomenal. It came with Dungeness crab legs (meat only), giant prawns, and scallops, paired with string beans, wild rice, carrots, and a rich white wine cream sauce. The seafood was SO fresh and tender-- even the string beans were savory!  The portions were generous, but I cleaned off the ENTIRE plate.\n\nThis is one of my favorite seafood joints (sorry vegetarians, you're out of luck here) in San Francisco; the food speaks for itself.

I really enjoyed the feeling of history that you get when you walk in. The tiles on the floor look like they are the original ones from when the restaurant opened. I like the setup with the huge bar in the middle and the tables along the walls. Each table is walled off so you are in your own private booth. The servers are very friendly and helpful but the older bartenders can be a bit grumpy.\n\nI would recommend coming in on a weeknight for dinner or come for a later dinner because I heard it can get very crowded. I went on a Wednesday at about 8:30pm and there was no issue getting a table right away.\n\nThe food is top notch. Everyone at our table had some sort of seafood dish and the ones that I tried were very good. The one negative I can say is that, as others have mentioned, it is a pretty pricey meal. The serving sizes are fairly large, but expect to drop a good amount of money when you come here.", "author": "Frank J."}

What? Our group of 6 literally had to stand, each of us with our backs to the wall, watching the people at the bar have a good time. And we were told we couldn't sit down, as those were for people that are eating at the bar. Really now, I'm sure they are just as busy on any other weekend night; you'd think they would build a waiting area.\n\nWe were seated, the waiter came over, handed everyone a menu, said that everything on it was excellent, and left. So we go about making our decisions and wave the waiter back. And we start ordering. Only then does the waiter tell us that they are out of their two most popular dishes of the night (it's 7pm!). And as we go around the table, it turns out that they are out of most of the dishes we wanted--I actually ended up with my 6th option. I understand when a restaurant is out of a dish, that happens. But (at least) 5 of them? Unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nOther complaints: The lemons on our table were already squeezed--kinda gross. And we were not given bread plates.\n\nNow that I've griped to no end, the food was decent. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either. I ended up with a \"Shrimp and Avocado Diablo\" which I expected to be spicy, but was just really buttery and cheesy, which I don't mind one bit. The others at my table were happy with their steak, trout and seafood saute. We skipped dessert, so no comments on that. The ambiance was definitely unique, with the waiters in half lab coats, and the bar/table setup. Go for lunch? I'm sure they'll have your food selection then.", "author": "Sindy C."}

It was MLK Day, and apparently our first option decided to be closed that day and not give us a bit of heads up.  Nevertheless, we were right on The Embarcadero and with no other options and trying to avoid calling an Uber to get around, we walked to this place.  It was a pleasant walk, not a lot of traffic, and it was an interesting sight to see this old-fashioned place at the first level of brand new office building and high rises.  Inside it's cramped and noisy, not in a frustrating way, but the way a good restaurant is when it's in high demand and dang good at what they do.  There were several parties waiting for a table, but one of the waiters behind the bar said we could sit immediately if we wanted to sit at the bar.  As I had no idea why anyone would wait so long for a table, we took the bar.  It was a great experience to see how effortlessly and flawlessly the waiters moved back and forth.  It was sad to see how people wasted food that was exceptional (and not cheap).  I ordered their cioppino on the recommendation of an older gentleman to my left, who omes to this restaurant 4 times a week and I think would know his stuff very well!  My mom ordered the Dungeness crab cakes.  Everything was exquisite!  My cioppino was rich and hot, and there was so much fish in there, I was stunned!  It was expensive, but the quality and quantity was unbelievable.  The whitefish was tender and fresh, the mussels as big as the palm of my hand, the shrimp giant.  The Dungeness crab cakes had no filler and were pure crab. I had been forewarned before coming here that the attitude of the waiters was...interesting.  To say the least, it was different.  They were all older men, white and Hispanic, and had a gruff character to them.  As long as they aren't downright rude (and they weren't) and attentive, it was good in my book.  Definitely a place to try!", "author": "Kathryn T."}

Tadich is such a San Francisco institution with lots of old world charm  that giving a two star rating is kind of like telling your grandma that her dumplings were just \"ok\". \n\nBut honestly, it was really really lackluster food.\n\nWe started with the crab cake was was ok. Lots of crab meat in it, which is nice but otherwise pretty standard stuff. A previous reviewer said it was one of the best they ever had, which got me excited and I was let down. I got the scallops and my boyfriend got the sand dab for our entrees. The sand dab was actually nice, simple and unique. The scallops were cooked nicely, but the accompanying gravy or sauce or whatever it was, was just awful. A bland unidentifiable grey pool at the bottom of the scallops. And a random scattering of chopped tomatoes tossed in. I also really dislike it when scallops don't have a nice sear to them. It looked like the scallops had been seared, but somehow lost that crispy goodness somewhere along the way. Maybe while it was sitting in the gray stuff?\n\nAnd finally, the sides. Oh god, those sides. Some of the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. It was rice, french fries, and some veggies. The veggies were nothing special, but nothing awful either. But that rice was some of the worst I've ever had. You can get better stuff out of a box. And the fries tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile. \n\nOur bill came out to be about $80 for two people, no drinks. Super high for such mediocre food. \n\nI think if I had gone into the restaurant thinking of it as more of a classic diner than as a high end restaurant, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. But essentially you get diner-esque food at really high prices. \n\nThen again, I haven't tried their cioppino which they seem to be known for.

It's a dish that originated in SF, and I can easily say that it's one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had.\n\nI went there during a not-so-busy hour (3pm) and sat down at the bar-like half of the restaurant.  It was somewhat of a mobster-like environment with dim lights, and waiters that were all old men with very little to say.  I ordered without looking at the menu since I knew what I wanted, but I was curious to know what the hell kind of a dish I was getting.  When I took a look at the menu, it turned out to be the most expensive item.  THAT SON OF A BITCH! ($30 actually, so not bad)  From that point on I had high expectations and kept thinking that I'd rather have a McRib (don't judge me...  and if you don't like McRibs, you should really be ashamed of yourself!!!).\n\nWhen my dish came, it looked like a whatevers bowl of cambell's with shellfish added.  They gave me a bib, but those things make me feel like a fool, so I decided to risk getting my $10 shirt splattered, and tossed it aside.  Once I had a taste however, now that's a different story.  The bowl of campbell's had somehow transcended into an orgy of magical seafood.  Mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, and white fish in a manhattan chowder-like broth.  All the shells were pealed/cracked, so it was very simple and easy to eat.  And the bread when dipped in the broth was a perfect blend of soft marinated bliss with a nice crispy crust aka damn delicious.  I also had a nice glass of chardonnay to go along with it, but any red would have done nicely as well.  \n\nThe only thing that I didn't like, was that the Tadich regulars would roll by and constantly tell me how great the cioppino is, how I should eat it, and how it compares to other restaurants.  I really wanted to smack each one of them in the face so I could enjoy my meal in peace!  \n\nI wish there was a place that serves such a cioppino in L.A., or is there...

The cioppino was good and no complaints. The price tag of the seafood stew left me feeling empty.\n\nThe service was good and upon arrival the gentlemen at the bar greeted us warmly. I just wasn't sure about the butcher jackets for their uniforms. I felt as if I was waiting for nice steak to be wrapped. The place needs a little update. Upon being sat at the really old table the server had to fix it with some napkins to balance the table.\n\nI understand keeping the historical aspect of the restaurant but there is time to modernize and have the guest feel more comfortable. The prices were expensive for the ambiance the level of service and even the quality of food was at question. I don't think the prices would be such a factor if not for the lack of detail. I just feel that for a little more money you could experience a more well polish establishment.\n\nFinally, I would not say that there isn't anything positive to take away from the restaurant. The Historical aspect of the place is almost worth dinning here. The food is prepared properly and is edible. I personally wasn't crazy about this place and think there is more ideal places to visit in this part of town.", "author": "Shaun P."}

Normally when you pay these prices you actually get a table and a nice leisurely dinner rather than a counter spot.  At Tadich Grill you get great old-school service from men in tuxedos but the lunch counter setting is certainly a bit different.  In terms of the food though, it's tough to find too much fault in the crab cakes - in my recent visit they were topped with a great sauce including fish roe which added great flavor and texture.  However, the \"famous\" sand dabs were extremely bland and really needed a good sauce - or maybe just seasoned breading - to make them worth eating.  I'm not saying I won't go back, but it's just a much different place than I expected and a 50% success rate on the food is less than I was hoping for.  That being said, it seems that cioppino and a number of other dishes are hits with Yelp users so I may have to check it out during future visits to SFO.\n\nFor the record, Tadich Grill also doesn't accept American Express which always kind of annoys me at high end places.  I'm just sayin'.", "author": "Brian C."}

The food was excellent as always; however, the service was terrible.  The waiter was nothing short of rude.  I arrived at the restaurant around 5:30 PM.  I was able to walk in and sit at the bar without a wait.  Right after I sat down a waiter asked me if I was by myself and I replied yes.  He told me to scoot down next to another person.  I indicated I didn't want to and he said I needed to so he could seat other people in my seat.  Oddly there were plenty of open seats.  In fact, they blocked off half the bar as there were so many seats available.  The other issue was that he didn't use manners.  In fact, I thanked him for serving me and he used no manners... even after he told me to move.  He also referred to me as boss.  After bringing my main course to me he said, \"do you need anything else boss.\"  I told him, \"no thank you.\" And he walked off.  What kind of waiter addresses his customer as boss?  Tadich Grill isn't exactly McDonalds.  BTW, no other customer was ever seated in my original seat or the seats next to that seat while I was there.

We arrived on a late Saturday afternoon.  We were hungry and anxious to try the restaurant having seen it on an Emeril episode.  The restaurant did not appear particularly busy and NO ONE was waiting.  I told the host there were two of us and he immediately told me it would be a 20-25 minute wait.  He suggested we eat at the counter if we didn't want to wait.  This might be a reasonable alternative at some diner or if there really were no tables available, but as it turns out, tables were available just not for us.  I informed the host that we wanted a table and was he sure about the wait.  He left, I assume to check on the table situation.  While he was gone, a group of 20 something's (that's how they looked anyway) arrived.  Two stayed outside perusing the menu and two waited just inside the door.  It did not appear that they were sure whether they wanted to eat there or not.  A few minutes later the host returned he reiterated to me that it would be a 20-25 minute wait.  The two behind us at the door started to leave.  The host called out to them \"are you going to eat?\".  One of them said \"it doesn't look that way\".  The host asked how many in the party and he replied 4.  The host then said (talking right over us I might add) \"I can seat you right away!\".  They then all came in, marched right past us, and we're seated.  Absolutely no one else was waiting and not another word to us from the host.  Since no one had left after we arrived (we would have seen them) the table/s must have been open when we were originally told 20-25 minutes.  So, why were we told we had to wait while the later arriving group got immediate service?  We neither are nor look like vagrants so I assume it wasn't our appearance.  No, it seems that the restaurant has a policy that party's of two must wait for a table for two regardless of whether anyone else is waiting or how many larger tables are available or how long that wait might be.  In short, whether that group of 4 came in 5 minutes after us or 20 minutes after us it's likely that they were going to be seated before us.  This may make good business sense if your sole goal is to maximize profits and you don't mind your guests feeling like little cash registers to be emptied.  But it makes for lousy customer service.  Don't get me wrong, but if I'm dropping a hundred or so on lunch, I prefer to dine at an establishment that at least pretends to value my business.", "author": "Thomas N."}

My friend took me to this old-school restaurant that serves classic seafood dishes. The restaurant doesn't take reservations so be sure to get there early to put your name down. \n\nWe were quoted a 30-40 minute wait so we decided to sit at the bar that is situated in the middle of the restaurant. It stretches pretty much the full length of the restaurant, which is interesting. Although the bartenders weren't friendly, they were fast and efficient in taking and serving our orders. I had the Manhattan Champagne and my friend had the Mojito Martini. My drink was an interesting combination of whiskey and champagne. I really enjoyed the martini though! I also tried the Mandarin Cosmo during and I thought it was just ok. The drinks are strong and they fill your martini glasses to the rim! \n\nOur table for dinner was nice and intimate, albeit it small. We ordered the Fried Calamari, the Seafood Cioppino, and the Lobster Thermidor. The calamari was extremely fresh and delicious. It did not have too much batter and they provided us with plenty of cocktail and tartare sauce. Out of the two entrees, I enjoyed the cioppino a lot more. It had plenty of fresh seafood (clams, scallops, fish, crab, mussels, etc) and two thick pieces of garlic bread to soak up the delicious sauce. The cioppino wasn't too saucy like other places make it - the seafood definitely stood out. The Lobster Thermidor was simply too rich for me. Although the lobster meat was sweet and delicious, the cheese and the Bechamel sauce was too overpowering. The dish came with steak-cut fries and vegetables, as well as a cup of clam chowder. I thoroughly enjoyed the clam chowder and thought that it was one of the best I've ever had. It was thick, creamy, and had lots of clams and potatoes. \n\nOur server was funny, friendly, but not always there when we needed him.

I guess they are no longer concerned with how their employer makes money to fund their ungrateful and boorish service style.\n\nI had taken a seat at the counter while my friend went and stood in the line to get a drink by the cash register.  We had tried to catch a waiter's eye to beg him to take our drink order as we were trying to get our seats at the open seating counter, but to no avail.  They refused to look at us, even when we tried to make verbal contact.  Mind you, this was at 6:00 p.m., Thursday evening with few people there yet for dinner hour.  There was an open seat at the counter and the person next to the empty seat was just finishing their meal and would be gone within 5 minutes.  I took the open seat after offering it to a gentleman who was with another man who had just taken a single seat up the counter and was waiting for another seat next to it to open.  I asked the friend who was still waiting for a seat who arrived just ahead of us, if he would like to sit down.  He thanked me for asking if he wished to take the seat, but declined stating he would wait for a seat next to his friend to open up so they could dine together.\n\n\nAfter I had taken the seat at the counter for approximately 2 minutes, the tall, 50ish, grey, balding, white male waiter, he was taller than all the other waiters by far...announced loudly to me from across the counter that I would need to vacate my seat because he had seen me come in with my friend and I was not allowed to sit at the counter and occupy a single seat!  I graciously told him that my friend was in the process of getting our drinks at the end of the counter, he cut me off and loudly proclaimed to those around us as he leaned across the counter toward me that \"I was violating protocol\", \"get up\", \"you can't sit there\".  \n\nThe girl next to me whom had just taken her last bite told him \"I am finished, they can have my seat\".  The venemous and aggressive waiter once again loudly proclaimed to both of us and those surrounding, \"that he didn't care if she was leaving or not, I was violating protocol and had to leave\".  The lady next to me then told the waiter to bring her check \"now\" and told him she was leaving and my friend could take her seat.  \n\nAt approximately this same time there were two other women whom had been waiting for seats and told us they had also been rudely and aggressively treated a few minutes before by a waiter further up the counter close to the prep station.\n\nI need to mention that the gentleman I spoke of earlier in this review who took a seat further up the counter and continued waiting for his friend to hopefully get a seat next to him was NOT ordered to leave the counter seat he occupied.  \n\nI was mortified and told the waiter he was extremely rude and out of line, but stupidly got up.\n\nNow I am thinking about how my civil rights as a woman have been violated.  I was not the only woman discriminated against this evening....hmmm.  I think I will be setting up an appointment with a class-action lawyer for a discussion on how my rights as a woman have been violated.\n\nHow many other women have had this same thing happen to them?\n\nNeedless to say, we will never be returning to Tadich Bar and Grill, and will take our business to another San Francisco restaurant that is happy to serve to women.", "author": "N D."}

It can be quite hefty with the chubby french fries and roast veggies, but the leftovers hold well.

With a glass of Viognier (or shot of tequila...let's be honest, it's your last meal on earth, might as well go out with a bang).\n\nAs a birthday treat, my wonderful and thoughtful boyfriend, who knows this about me, treated me to a wonderful dinner at Tadich Grill (thanks to a recommendation from some of our friends). Arriving around 6:30, we were seated in a matter of minutes at a nice table by the window. I was surprised by how busy they got the longer we were there, especially for it being a Tuesday. (You can't make reservations, so I would definitely recommend arriving a bit before 7/dinner crowd to avoid long waits).\n\nShortly after we were seated, our nice waiter took our order, I had a glass of Pinot Noir and my bf had a nice pint of Bass. After nibbling on some chewy french bread goodness, we both received our piping hot bowls of cioppino. \n\nBuckle. Up.\n\nSO good. All of the seafood is fresh and tasty, and the tomato-based broth is seasoned to perfection. They give you two pieces of buttered garlic bread (that you use to soak up the delicious broth of course) as well as a much-needed bib and soup spoon. We had not a drop to spare by the end of the meal, it was that good.\n\nIt's a great spot for both a small and large group. They have small tables for 2-4 people, but they also have large booths along one side as well as a long row of seats at the bar.

All the credit goes to this joint, as conceivably the ideal choice for the corner-office option we ran mid-day today.

Tadich in the clutch.  \n\nSomewhere between breaking such great sourdough bread, right-on-the-spot chowder and menu pages of seafood of every stripe...literally...we got into a conversational food groove in an old-time booth - it was all good...no worries - my pan-seared red snapper with sauteed crab was a nice combo.  Not amazing, but much better than good.  Still gotta try the trout, maybe it's up there with the stellar ciopinno.  \n\nThe food is a small part of the review in this one, unique case - there's just something pleasantly amazing about everything else in the vibe of this joint.

So even as busy as it was, we only waited 10 mins to be seated.\n\nOur waiter was French, and very efficient. I wouldn't say the waiters are exactly friendly, but they do work hard, they are helpful. We ordered the oysters to start, which were yumminess in a shell. I had the fillet of sole, and hubby had some sort of steak. Everything was delicious. The only snafu we had was that hubby ordered a glass of wine and the waiter forgot to bring it. He did eventually remember (without us having to ask), and was genuinely apologetic about forgetting.

The service isn't just brusque, it's a mixture of seething anger and just-below-the-surface disdain that they've polished to a fine sheen for 100 years. Somewhere around 1953, they crossed the line between 'rude' and 'local flavor' and now are beloved for it. The portions are plentiful but I find the fish dishes heavy and bland. I could almost swear that my yellowfin tuna tasted angry.\n\nEdit 9/04/07: They don't have Anchor Steam beer. They want props and kudos for being a San Francisco tradition, yet they can't serve Anchor Steam. I read in another review that the wine list was 'nice' when it couldn't be more pedestrian. I just don't get this place. It's Original Joes with blander food and less room to stand.\n\nI love the Barbary Coast feel of the place...the amazingly long counter. I love the clientele. A mix of FiDi and lawyerly types. It could just be me though. The place is jammed with regulars so it can't possibly be as bad as I think is. Or maybe there's a 'The Emperor's New Yellowfin Tuna' thing going on here. Maybe with this Yelp review, the ruse is over.", "author": "Brian B."}

There were seven of us, we all work close buy.\n\nMany people write about being sited very quickly - Truth!. Within a minute we were sited in a both that gave a little privacy and allowed us to enjoy the lunch without being bumped in by others.\nLet's break it down a bit:\n\nOur waiter, Yanis (hope I spelled it right) looked like that was not his first day at work :o); quite knowledgeable in the menu and specials.  Gave us lots of possible choices and we ended up with two orders of Olives to start and four cioppinos, two monkfish specials, and an eggplant special for the main dish. \n\nOlives:\nVery dissent ones. Not bitter, seed in. Two pieces of garlic bred on the bed of fresh greens were accompanying olives. \n\n\nCioppino:\nWOW!!! Close to the one that my brother-in-law makes (he makes the best one). AWESOME! \nLOTS of shredded crab, fish, scallops, mussels, and only 3 shrimps (to someone who wrote that there are mostly bay shrimps). Two pieces of garlic bread... and whole lot of enjoinment. A bit to much of \"solid parts\" of cioppino were on the plate; that made it into a seafood stew at the end. Different experience of a cioppino. Loved it!!!\n\nMonkfish Special:\nMy wife liked it a lot. And believe me, she knows her fish :o) \nI tried a piece: flaky, tender, no fishy taste, with a bit of a smocked flavor. Mashed potato and a sauce was a nice addition to it.\n\nEggplant special:\n\nCan't say much. The piece that I have tried was a good piece of a fried eggplant. Not oily, nothing fancy. \nThere were also five jumbo shrimps on the top covered in a sauce. (I have posted a picture).\n\nThe end result: 222$ without tips. \nWas it worth it?  YES, YES, YES!!!\nWill we go there again? Definitely!!! Might be not for every day lunch or dinner, but this would absolutely make a very fine addition to any special occasion.    \n\nDefinitely would recommend it to anyone who does not expect to get a great food for freaking McD price.\n   \n\nP.S.

The menu is impressive in its variety but I knew what I wanted to try since I watched TV. My honey got a pasta dish which he enjoyed. We sat at the bar - a big long bar that wraps around like a racetrack in the middle of the restaurant - with bar stools. You hang your coat on the rack behind you. As the night wore on, there were folks lining up by the racks. \n\nThe cioppino was excellent. Chock full of fresh seafood and I like enough sauce with my cioppino and it did not disappoint.

After Anthony Bourdain made an appearance here for No Reservations, I knew I had to try it (obsessed?

The clams were surprisingly big, not only in size but also in taste.\n\nI had the Mediterranean broiled sea bass and E had some halibut dish that was cheesy, spinach-y, and yummy.  Tadich is very generous with their portions.  We were both stuffed after our meal and we pride ourselves in our gluttonous ways.\n\nI loved that the waiter warned me about my order, telling me that my entree would be a  whole fish - head, tail, and all.  He asked if I'd be OK with that, as if I hadn't grown up eating fish eyes and peering over the fish counter in 99 Ranch to watch the butchering of many a fish with sheer delight.  I politely offered E one of my fish eyeballs, but his eyes widened in disgust while I happily munched on my fish carcass.

And we both love old school spots that retain their charm/decor. Got in early, had some good Grey Goose martinis ($11 each!) at the bar and got a table fairly quickly (note the positive stars: strong drinks, fast seating & decor).\n\nNow onto the food:\n\nStarted off with a Caesar salad... said $10 on the menu but was $14.95 on the bill. Why? Because we got the large but wasn't informed of the up charge. And not worth either price... the lettuce tips weren't crisp and the dressing tasted like a bottled buttermilk generic one, with no hints of garlic nor anchovy. There were some random anchovies on top which gave the salad the only flavor it had. No fresh ground pepper was brought nor offered to us (but saw it offered to other tables).\n\nNext up were our main courses: the pre b-day boy had the cioppino, which had two huge pieces of bread on the side. These were burnt thru so he couldn't eat and instead used the sourdough on our table to mop up the broth. Poor guy: the white fish was overcooked/unedible, the clams overdone and crab on top cold, with the broth being mediocre.\n\nMy main course was one of the daily specials: seared salmon and ahi combo. Now to me, seared means the outside is lightly cooked...the ahi was cooked to the point of being grey and rubbery, with the salmon uneven (one side seared, the other dry). This was drowned by a bad Asian inspired sauce that should of been left off a well prepared fish. Oh wait, now I understand why...\n\nNot once during our meal were we asked \"how is the food\" so we had no chance to say \"awful.\" And when we didn't order dessert, we were given the bums rush out. In looking at our bill ($120 for one app, two main courses, 3 glasses of Zin and tip) I saw that there was a spot to comment about your meal and give to the maitre d'; I wrote my comments about the food and handed it him when leaving. His response \"Oh no... you must be joking\" then went to tend to some others waiting for their table. And overpriced, inedible meal.", "author": "Missy D."}

Also, a helpful tip this place is closed on Sunday so don't try to make plans to eat there on that day!

It's VERY old school, and not what I was expecting in this area. Service was excellent. Maybe if I'd been hungry enough to order the cioppino, I'd be a happier camper.\n\nI had a crab cake as well as an avocado salad for lunch. Both had more butter/oil/fat in them than I usually eat in a week. In fact, when I stuck my fork in the salad, the cucumber slice slid right off the oily mound of iceberg onto the floor. Very hard to spear the avocado as well, because it was too slippery with oil to get onto the fork. The lone tomato slice in the salad was the cellophane/tasteless variety my mother used to serve us back in Buffalo NY, not the fresh, flavorful, local type I've enjoyed at other spots in this area.\n\nThe crab cake, while well-made and with a delicious spicy tomato relish on top, was atop an unappealing sauce that was both creamy and oily at the same time. Additionally, the cake seemed to be bound with butter, as it, too, was incredibly slippery, both inside and out. \n\nAltogether a let down.

From beginning to end our dinner only took 1 hour. That's odd for a nice seafood / steak grill no?\n\nAnyway, when we arrived, there were 6 couples ahead of us in line for a booth so we just hopped onto 2 empty stools on the long bar counter. The table was laid out with sourdough bread, butter, condiments every 2 seats apart. Very 'mechanical'.\n\nWe started with white clam chowder (cup $5.50 or so). Very good. Creamy, bites of clams, bites of potato, celery, parsley maybe. Very classic style with the right consistency. VERY filling.\n\nWhen my Cioppino ($29.95) arrived, I was feeling a bit full. The Cioppino was BIG. Loaded with bay shrimp, 2 large scallops, 2 large shrimps, 4 clams, and tons of fish chunks, all topped with fresh crab meat - it was delicious. Tomato-y, garlicky, and well seasoned, the 2 pieces of (over)toasted garlic bread helped sop up all that goodness.\n\nMy friend EF had the Grilled Chilean Seabass ($29.95) served with rice pilaf, and brussel sprouts. Very clean in presentation and cooking - meaning none of that heavy sauce, though there was some creamy dill sauce near his seabass. The seabass didn't need it though. A very generous fillet of seabass was grilled perfectly. Not overdone which is key.

The clam chowder is delicious, the bread is always plentiful, the service is impeccable. \n\nit is all exactly as it should be.\n\naddendum: I recently came here with other people for the first time and had a delightful experience sitting in one of the the mafioso-esque tall booths.

The only negative was the blast of cold air that would surge into the restaurant every time the door was opened, but at least we were a little ways from it.  The service and meal were indeed perfect.  You would think from the name \"Grill\", this was a steak house.  Steaks and chops actually are a tiny corner of the menu.  Most of the menu was fresh seafood!    But we ordered steaks (which were very good).  What I most appreciated was the thing restaurants usually mess up -- vegetables!  Their vegetables were absolutely perfect, crunchy but not hard.  So, if you want to treat yourself to dinner at the oldest restaurant in San Francisco (founded in 1850 or so) and have a REALLY good meal, this is the place to go for sure.", "author": "Dave C."}

The waitstaff ignored us for about 15 minutes before anyone stopped by our table to ask for our drink order.  The wine list was meh - only one half-bottle was offered on the menu. \n\nAnd the food.  Oh, gods, the food was gross.  My husband had a stiff breaded veal chop with a side of overcooked spaghetti topped with a sauce that can only be described as canned.  The taste was blah, the noodles squishy and there wasn't enough sauce to mask the texture.  \n\nMy meal - a creole casserole with shrimp and oysters was truly nasty.  It was served in a shallow bowl and was a gross soupy mixture of flaccid shrimp, orange water, a few grains of rice and a Chef Boyardee-looking sauce.  And I shouldn't forget the oysters.  I took one bite of an oyster and thought, \"Wow - what a weird texture.\"  The next day I realized that the weird texture was...  Rotten oyster.\n\nSo Thanks, Tadich's.  I got to see all of San Francisco's finest hotel, tourist, retail, restaurant, fast-food, public, and ferry bathrooms all over the city.

Based on highly rated Yelp reviews, I chose Tadich Grill.  When we first walked in, the place smelled more like urine than the ocean.  Nonetheless, we sat down and ordered. She had the sea bass and I had the cioppino.  Perhaps the food would have tasted good, had the service been better.  I give the place one star for food and none for service.  The server did not once ask how the food was.  I was quite hungry and had a hankering for rice so grabbed the server's attention to ask if they have a side order of rice.  We didn't ask for the price, simply the availability.  The server rudely replied, that's $8, as though he judged that we couldn't afford an eight dollar side dish.  The wardrobe my girlfriend had on cost more than a thousand so $8 is pocket change.  But I digress.  After we ate, my girlfriend took out her wallet to pay.  The check had not been given to us but the server was ready to grab the credit card from her hand.  She asked to see the bill first.  The server walked away with an attitude and returned with the check.  But rather than leaving the checkbook on the table, he opened it for her to see but would not hand it to her.  It was quite a bizarre experience.  We are generous tippers--at a fine restaurant with good service, we tip as high as 40%.  Otherwise we tip 20%-25%.  This is the first time we tipped less than 10%.  We would not revisit this place.  We recommend that you ask for a good server or simply go to another restaurant.  Seafood places are dime a dozen in the Bay Area.  Great services are not easy to find but surely one can find a place with better service than Tadich Grill.", "author": "Rolo R."}

The building is old, the decor is spare - but unique. The bar is very long and has most of its seats reserved for people dining (not for drinks only - people just there for drinks have their own area of the bar). There are no TVs. This place was around 100 years before they were invented. \n\nThe bar a huge plus for couples and single business travelers (like me) because the bar seats (not stools) are fixed to the floor, swivel and are comfortable. The spacing is perfect - you get just enough room, but I've gotten into conversations with the people to the right and left of me. For larger parties there are very old school booths. I eat here every time I come to SF - it's by far the best single-person dining experience I've ever had. \n\nThe food is four stars - it's very simple. I always have an appetizer or salad and the cioppino, which is phenomenal. However, the oysters are opened in advance and iced - fine, but I prefer a more freshly shucked oyster. None of the other dishes I've observed are all that fancy. On the other hand, every other appetizer I've had was very good - for example, the salad with crab and bay shrimp shines because of the seafood. \n\nDrinks are old fashioned. If you want a chocatini, go someplace else. However, a simple martini is served quickly and perfectly done. \n\nThe service is also old school. I try to sit at the same part of the bar where the same waiter is always there. He's probably in his late 50s, has a middle-European accent (as many of the waiters do) and is OUTSTANDING. He's not in my face, but the minute my water is half full, it gets filled up. If I want a second martini, I don't have to remind him that it's beefeaters up with a twist. When I finish every drop of the cioppino, which I do every time, he heartily congratulates me for doing a good job. (old school waiters evaluate their customers) The serving area behind the bar is BUSY and manly. The staff wears starched white cotton jackets and there is some sort of rank system with the number and type of pens in each man's chest pocket. When your drink is put down on the cocktail napkin, the restaurant logo faces you - as it is when your entre plate is put down in front of you. Your water is perfectly iced. Unlike the trendy restaurants, the staff is not up their own @ss - these guys are professionals.\n\nI travel a lot on business and I tend not to rate many mediocre restaurants - so most of my reviews are good.

I suggested Tadich Grill because I heard about it multiple times.  Without Yelp-ing it, we headed over.\n\nWell....first of all, it does seem iconic enough.  It felt as though we were transported back in time, but not to a fancy schmancy dining establishment that's for sure.  We ended up sitting at the bar, which I don't mind at all.\n\nWe ordered the calamari to share, which was ... calamari.  I mean, you must be a HORRIBLE place if you can't fry a squid, in my book.  Although I should have gotten the fish, I opted instead for the House Special ravioli with meat sauce.\n\nMaybe it was because I ordered wrong....but even my fellow dining companions were not impressed.  One had the Fish Florentine, the other the Hamburger steak.  Aside from the fact that our food was heavy, I think our plates would have still half-full.\n\nFinally, when it came time to get the check we asked if it could be split.\n\n\"But I already MADE one,\" said the waiter indignantly, as though we were asking him to cut our food and feed it to us.\n\n\"Is there any way you could though?\" we asked again politely.  Again, he retorted, \"I already MADE one.\"  We just gave up.\n\nWould I go back again?  Um, no thanks.

Turning on to California Street coming in from the Bay Bridge we noticed the Tadich is just a short walk from the hotel, so we made a spontaneous decision to have dinner there having seen the restaurant featured on numerous television shows.  The staff at the Omni confirmed the raves we've heard for the Tadich, so we checked in and walked over.  At 8:45, the wait for a table was 45 minutes but the maitre d' said that we'd probably have better luck waiting for a couple of seats at the expansive bar instead.  I ordered us a couple of 21st Amendment IPAs on draught for the wait, and sure enough a space for two opened at the bar within 10 minutes. A couple who came in after us moved in to occupy the two spaces, but the alert waiter at that end noticed we had arrived first, shooed them away, and called us over to sit. Not a house policy, but more an unwritten amendment to the unspoken \"first come first served\" code.\n\nWe ordered the huge seafood cocktail and a bowl of white clam chowder, but unfortunately they were out of the lobster and shrimp bisque. Each of these was loaded with seemingly bottomless seafood and clams respectively, and tasted fresh and delicious.  I ordered the Hawaiian Ono with rice and vegetables for my main course and was delighted with the fresh grilled flavor of the ono (known some other places as wahoo), and with the choice of fresh vegetables accompanying the fish (snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and brussell sprout. As an added treat, they topped the ono with a delightful sesame/seaweed salad nested miso glazed scallop coated and cooked to perfection.\n\nDessert was a really nice tiramisu wrapped in a paper thin chocolate sheet, and the perfect way to cap off a fantastic meal.

We got there at almost 11:30 and there were like 10 people in the entire place.  When we left at about 12:30 there was a line out the door.\n\nThe decor is awesome here.  Totally old school.  I can just picture businessmen in the 40's and 50's having a 3 martini lunch here.  I know this place dates back much farther but that's just the picture I have in my head.\n\nOur waiter was a very friendly older gentleman that clearly had too many tables to tend to.  He only came back once during our meal to see if we needed anything.  This turned out to be a good thing because had he stopped by more often I would have ordered 5 more diet cokes (this will make sense later).\n\nOur food arrived very fast and the portion sizes were good.  Here is what we had:\n\n* The bread they give you to start = EXCELLENT!!! - it doesn't look like much but it is terrific.  Crunch, slightly burned crust with a fluffy, kinda chewy inside.  I'm not sure what kind it was but I think it might have been sourdough.\n* Clam chowder (white) - EXCELLENT\n* Oysters Rockefeller - best I've ever eaten.  They make them very unique with a kind of spinach and cheese mixture instead of breadcrumbs and stuff like I've had at other places.\n* Crab Louie salad - excellent and lots of crab. \n\nAnyway, I would have given this place 5 stars if they didn't charge $2 for each thimble size refill of diet coke.   Like seriously, WTF?  Who charges for refills these days?\n\nI would like to return soon and often, but I'm not sure when I'll be back in the SF.", "author": "Jason B."}

It was prepared with a creamy wine sauce and chopped mushrooms, which was good but I would have preferred a much lighter and simpler preparation. My boyfriend got the red snapper with crab which was also very heavy and he didn't particularly enjoy.\n\nOverall, I don't think I would care to return to Tadich Grill during my next visit to San Francisco.

Seafood is too broad of a term I feel. Fish seems to be what this place is known for, so that is what a review should be for right?\n\nThis review is for the lunch I had here a few days ago with a good buddy of mine Cristofer P. \n\nFirst off the ambiance of the place is crazy. Feels like you stepped back into time into the Prohibition era, all old school. Glitzy isn't the right word, classy is better. \n\nSat down to a table with bread and butter laid out already, which isn't a bad sign. The butter was room temp thank goodness! (i hate cold butter, how do you even spread that on anything?)\n\nMe and Chris ordered a clam chowder each, and decided to split the fried oyster fritata omlete bacon type deal (really I swear that's my description of the dish, don't remember the actual name).\n\nThe chowder was solid, again, not the real 'best' new england/boston clam chowder I've ever had, but still good. I mean, it's clam chowder at an old SF mainstay. It's gonna be thick, creamy soup, with a good amount of clams and veggies. Solid.\n\nThen the main entree came and I have to say I was slightly disappointed. Sure I split it with a friend, but I mean for 22 bucks...I'm getting like six fried oysters with some egg and bacon. Really now? As for the food itself, it was surprising in flavor, but lacking in overall quality. The seasoning was off a bit, needed a little more salt and pepper. Chris commented that the bacon in the dish acts like salt if you get a proper bite, but really I only got two bites. One with no bacon, which needed salt, and one with what felt like half a strip of bacon, and became just bacon overwhelming.\n\nBut like I said, I'd have to book mark this place to come back and try an actual fish dish to give a full decent review.\n\nPros: Good service, good ambiance, good bread and butter!\n\nCons: Expensive, seriously. Around $25-30 per entree. But if you're coming here for food, is money really going to stop you? Get's a little noisy and crowded.", "author": "David H."}

Logically, this should be a no brainer. It's always busy, well reviewed. (averaging 4 stars). It's often described as Old San Francisco. I don't want to bore you with what that means to me but we all get a mental picture of what an old school SF restaurant would be. From all outward appearances, Tadich's is exactly what we were looking for. READ ON as both looks and YELP can be deceiving. \n\nThe wait is manageable but cliquish. The guy that takes your name must have a system but it seemed pretty random to me. After 25-30 minutes we got a small table for lunch. Fine. Happy to have it. The counter however is large and if you don't know about it, it's grab a seat if you want as there is no waiting list for the counter. Wish I would have know as I passed up a prime spot thinking I had to wait for someone to hail me. \n\n Met promtly by a waiter, we decided to split a bowl of New England style chowder and I had a bloody mary. Both really good. Very good if you want to know the truth. For lunch, my wife had the seafood saut\u00e9 and I thought a burger in a mushroom sauce sounded good. We were both disappointed with our choices. We both got brussel sprouts with our selection. Who the hell likes or wants brussel sprouts?  I also got some nicely chilled fries. Lovely. The waiter told me I could get a different side but it was going to cost me. Screw that, 18 dollars for the burger already seemed like I had spent enough. My wife's lunch choice did have fresh and delicious seafood but the sauce was overwhelming. \n\nWe will continue our search as they gave the vibe that our special visit was nothing special to them. That my friend is not Old San Francisco. \nForget the indifferent service and brussel sprouts, enjoy a delicious bowl of clam chowder and grab a seat at the counter. Had we have done that, we think it would have been and entirely different experience.", "author": "Ron L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-05", "description": "Tadich Grill opened its doors back in 1849.   I still don't understand why it took me 161 years to try this place, but I finally did.  My friend and I went to Tadich on a whim yesterday, and we were not disappointed.  Well, I am sure he was disappointed just a \"tad,\" because it was his turn to pay for lunch.\n\nWe got there at 11:40, and all tables and booths had already been taken.  We were offered to sit at the counter or wait 20 minutes, so we wisely chose the rather comfortable bar stools (complete with back support) at the counter.  We were told rather sternly to not leave a chair between us and the other diners.  It would only make sense that a seafood restaurant would pack people in like sardines.\n\nMy favorite thing about Tadich was seeing bread and butter on the table for everyone.  Yep, we didn't have to wait or ask for it - it was just there.  For people who are perpetually hungry, having food readily available is a sight for sore eyes and grumbling stomachs.  Why don't more restaurants do that?\n\nAs I was buttering my sliced sourdough, I had a chance to look around.  The whole restaurant was rather narrow, with a weathered mahogany counter around a large bar area in the middle, an open kitchen in the back and 10-12 booths and tables along the wall. \n\nI also remembered that a lot of people complained about the service here, so I braced myself for the worst.  The service wasn't bad at all.  If you're looking for a friendly smile and hug, you should probably go elsewhere.  If you're looking for well schooled, efficient and slightly standoffish waiters in smoking jackets, you're in the right place.  Yep, it's old school all the way.\n\nI started with a cup of cream of mushroom soup ($6.95).  If that was a cup, I don't want to know how big a bowl would have been.  The cup was big enough, and the soup was delicious.  It was no Campbell's out of a can, let me tell you.  It was mmm...mmm... good, though.  Due to the abundance of shellfish offerings, my options were slightly limited.  I went with the halibut served on the bed of rice with string beans ($20).  Even the halibut was supposed to have been served with crab, but I asked them to hold the vile crustacean.  The large halibut steak was flaky, but maybe just a tiny bit on the dry side.  I like my fish slightly less cooked.  My friend ordered the cioppino, and he seemed to enjoy it.  I was a little jealous because his dish came with garlic toast.\n\nBoth of us left the restaurant a little heavier, although one of our wallets was $71 lighter.  Thanks, Dan!", "author": "Yan G."}

No waiting no snotty overpaid 23 yr olds at the door ignoring people waiting to be seated.  You come in, you are acknowledged and you are seated or told exactly how long the wait is immediately. \n\n Sitting at the bar is an experience, and isn't lacking anything. If you can however wait for the booth.  There really is nothing like sitting in the wooden booths conversing with your cohorts as if you were a banker in the gold-rush days.  The coat hangers and bustling atmosphere outside make the experience cozy and unique. Its your own private little wooden room from which to enjoy your meal. \n\n The food here, is wonderful. Everything on the menu, is cooked to perfection and served promptly. If they are out... they are out. If they have it \"I will give it to you\" is their motto. I ve had the pleasure of eating here on several occasions, my parents were big fans and now a good friend of mine calls the Tadich his favorite spot. The Cioppino is top knotch, and the lamb shoulder is not to be put off either.  Served with crunchy sourdough bread and warm butter.  Or a salad with fresh crab and shrimp perhaps?  Anything on the menu is sure to not disappoint. \n\n Thank you Tadich for making my friends birthday such an event, from the VIP seating to the Happy Birthday song complete with his drinking howl...you guys really are the best at what you do. :", "author": "Charlie B."}

But, the waiters in white aprons, bartenders shaking drinks, and the rattle of utensils hitting plates is a delight to behold. A trip through time. \n\nEveryone says it and I'll reiterate - the cioppino is a \"have to have it before I die\" dish so make sure someone at your table orders it.

When food is this good it does not have to be over seasoned. \n  Yes, there are new tastes emerging in the resturant industry. Curry this, Fusion that. So if you are looking for an OMG wacky-tacky, fun, cucumber, ginger, lime, coconut, sea urchin infused martini served by the fun waiter who is your new BFF, like OMG how arrrrrrre you? And you call one piece of gucci sushi dinner please keep moving and let me enjoy my place in time. Sorry you missed the era.", "author": "Peter C."}

They would get 5 if they took reservations, but I understand why they don't. \n\nI ate at Tadich Grill last night with my girlfriend and was already prepared for the no reservations policy. However, we got there a little bit before 6pm and there was a 45 minute wait! The place was super crowded. We weren't not sure if it's because it's the holidays and a lot of people aren't working. The wait was a little less than 45 minutes actually. There's really no good place to wait though because the bar is full and so be prepared to possibly wait outside in the cold. My friend and I walked around in the financial district a little bit so it wasn't bad. \n\nI really like how they give you a big loaf of sourdough bread with butter to munch on (although don't munch too early and get full!) and then provide LOTS of fresh lemons to squeeze on your food. \n\nI'm glad that I had read Yelp! reviews beforehand because the menu was a lot bigger than I was expecting and a little overwhelming. There are so many choices but we already had ideas what we wanted to try.\n\nWe got 3 things and the portions were huge. It's a little bit on the pricey side but that's what you get for decent portions and really fresh seafood.\n\n1) Dungeness Crab Louie Salad (Large): The selection on the \"small salads\" didn't look as good so we went for the large option. The salad itself isn't that impressive cause it's just some lettuce, a couple of thick tomato slices, couple of thick cucumbers, 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg, and couple olives. But they PILE on the dungeness crab and then give you this big thing of thousand island on the side. I like that I get to pour on as much dressing as I wanted and it wasn't pre-mixed. Squeeze a little bit of lemon juice on top, and you've got one tasty crab dish. The crab was delicious... not sure if I would get it again just cause the salad part wasn't impressive. I don't remember how much it was. \n\n2) Pan-fried san dabs: It was on the 7X7 list so we had to try them. They were lightly battered and pan-fried with some lemon/garlic/herb butter on top (just a drizzle). Served with thick french fries that were awful and SUPER starchy. I took one bite and both me and my friend put our fries on the side not to eat them. Also had a little veggie medley with brussel sprouts, broccoli, and carrots. They were good but not like OMG-so-good-I-will-die and I probably wouldn't order them again. $22.50\n\n3) Ciopinno: Total highlight of the meal. I would go back to Tadich Grill just to get this delicious seafood stew. It was a tomato based broth and was almost like drinking pomodoro sauce (obviously not as thick). It was piled high with jumbo shrimp, bay shrimp, mussels, clams, and fillets of fish. I don't know what kind of fish it was but it amazed me how the fish was not overcooked but not undercooked either. How did they do that!? They served it with two large pieces of garlic bread that was perfect for dipping in the sauce. So hearty and perfect for a cold rainy day. $28 but definitely splittable between two people. It would be a lot for one person. This should be on the 7X7 list!!!! Side note but they also give you cute little bibs to wear so your clothes won't get dirty. :)\n\nWe were too full for dessert and I read that they were bad on yelp anyways. The next time I go, I want to try their crab cakes! Also, their clam chowder is supposed to be thick and hearty. I saw other people ordering it and it looked yummy. The table next to us had a table of four and they ordered calamari. I overheard one woman say that it was the best calamari she's ever had.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the service, but our waiter was really great. He was attentive and checked in on us and thought he was very friendly.\n\nI will definitely be going back but going early to avoid huge waits!", "author": "Jackie T."}

We pulled out the Credit Card, made motions to order, but couldn't get the bartender right in front of us to serve us a drink. He only had one speed, and that was slow and ignoring his potential customers.  We never did get a drink before we were seated.\n\nWe looked over the extensive menu and order a drink from our waiter. 10 minutes later, we still had not received our Stella Artois and Tanqueray Tonic.   \n\nWe finally ordered from our French waiter, who was also inattentive, and wanted fresh oysters and Clams and Pasta.

We had to ask for them back! Not very attentive, just getting through with his Snooty French attitude! \n\nThe Clam chowder was too thick, with perhaps too much clams (I guess they were out of Pasta, because they had plenty of Clams!)

The waiters and bartenders are old school, curmudgeonly yet welcoming;  I have yet to fully figure out their demeanor. They are extremely knowledgeable and happy to steer you through the huge menu.  \n\nFour stars:  Who else still serves liver and bacon? It's deliciously crispy and flavorful, but such a huge portion I can't eat it all.  The cioppino is the signature dish and piping hot, well spiced and freshest fish.  Choose carefully: some of the fish and seafood dishes are in rich, buttery sauces; just be aware if not to your taste (like me).  \n\nThree stars:  The shrimp and prawn a la Monza was packed with crab, but only two shrimp.  \n\nTwo stars.  No reservations, so there's often a line.  However, the wait seems shorter when you're sipping a martini.  \n\nOne star: It's always busy so it's always loud - difficult for conversations with the hard of hearing.\n\nSUMMARY:  A San Francisco institution specializing in comfort food - the ambience is old-school conviviality.  Try the Tadich for dinner if you want to feel warm and cozy, or just stop by for a drink at the long, mahogany bar to experience an almost illicit speakeasy ambience.", "author": "Nerdy G."}

I had the sea bass and maybe it was my mistake to ask for a recommendation on the preparation--I was curious about the soy glaze (I think it was). (The guy seemed a little annoyed). I'd asked the server his recommendation between a couple of options, and he said just go ahead and get the soy glaze. Perhaps that seemed like a fit to him since I'm Asian. It was overcooked and nothing special. \n\nThe cioppino that my friends had was excellent. I would go again some time in the future and stick with a more traditional fish preparation. Also, the portions were ginormous--two huge hunks of fish that were individually a generous full serving already. I guess that's how they justify the prices.", "author": "Tina Z."}

The first thing that strikes you about Tadich is that you've stepped back in time. The waiters are all suited up nice like and the tables have white tablecloths. But it's the menu that really comes from a time forgotten.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about the menu was its density. The sheer number of options was staggering, and it took me forever to pick an entree. But after I penetrated the destiny, I discovered a significant section dedicated to casseroles. Seriously? I didn't order one, so I can't comment further... but, seriously, seven different casseroles?\n\nInstead I pigged out on delicious deep fried seafood, all high quality with excellent tartar sauce. The only food disappointment was a plate of half dozen oysters I shared with the table. I think the oysters had been sitting in water for too long, and as a result the oyster flavor was washed out. \n\nOh, and I can't forget the bar. The wait for a table was substantial, but we enjoyed a full bar with some talented bartenders. As I continue my hunt for the city's best Old Fashioned, I can safely report that Tadich is on the list.\n\nA word of caution... I can't recommend Tadich if your goal is just good seafood. Tadich is about taking a step back in time, and in that way they are selling an ambiance. But if the ambiance isn't the goal, there are better seafood options in the city.", "author": "Sean K."}

It just so happened that my boss and I were next door at Perbacco's for an appointment, and when we were done, I happened to have noticed Tadich Grill right next door and inquired about it.\n\nBeing that it was shortly before noon... my boss so kindly invited me to lunch here seeing that I've never been before.  She said that it would be worth a try since it's one of SF's oldest restaurants which dated back to the 1800's.\n\nUpon walking in the door, this restaurant felt more like a diner and nothing I would have expected to see in the Financial District.  We were quickly greeted by one of the older gentlemen waiters.  As we made our way to our table, I noticed at the left side of the restaurant were these private booths/rooms.  It was quite charming... and definitely something different.\n\nThe menu was full of options.....but I will have say that at first glance, my eyes widened a bit because of their expensive prices.  I think I spent almost 10 minutes reading everything on the menu before finally deciding. Everything looked so yummy! =o)\n\nI finally decided on their crabcakes special which came with 2 large crabcakes, a side of rice and some fresh string beans.  My boss ordered the fried cod which came with a side of coleslaw and potato fries.\n\nI don't think I'll ever forget that first bit I took of my crabcakes.  It was full of fresh crab and fried to perfection.  Absolutely scrumptious!!  Every cent of my $25 lunch was worth it.  I would definitely go back again if I had a craving for crabcakes.  I left not a speck of food on my plate. And my boss was so happy with her food, she did the same.\n\nOverall, I think the Tadich Grill is a great place to eat if you are going for the food.  The service is slightly above average and the portions are plentiful.  But I think what bothered me the most which caused this review to only be  4-stars was the noise level.  My boss and I couldn't hear one another talk at all.  Every 2 minutes one of us had to lean into the table to speak to the other person. It was a little annoying after a while.\n\nBut all in all, I would recommend this restaurant for those seeking great food and want to get a taste of what old SF use to be all about.

Tadich Grill really takes it to another level. The broth is not as rich as Phil's but it's more flavorful because it's not as thick from the tomato sauce so you can taste more of the seafood flavors. I love how the broth is lighter and it is packed, literally, with clams, crabmeat, scallops, prawns, and fish. \n\nThe other items that we ordered were good but nowhere close to the cioppino. We ordered the lobster thermidor, which was good but not something I'd order again. Lobster is already pretty rich and to throw cheese and a bechamel sauce on top is a bit overkill for me. I also tried a bite of my friend's sand dab fillets and again, thought it was good but not sure if I'd order it again as I'm not a fan of pan frying thin delicate fish in general. \n\nAnother important aspect that should not be ignored is the history that this places carries with it. \"If these walls could talk....\"", "author": "Victor H."}

Don't get me wrong, the food was rather tasty- we had the crab leg salad, clam chowder, and the infamous seafood cioppino. All of which was extremely fresh and very flavorful. The prices for this kind of food is what leaves me not interested in giving the extra stars. The food is yummy, but really just okay. It's not worth $30 a plate for sure. There are so many incredible restaurants in the city, and especially in that area, that are very pricey, but incredibly delicious. I would rather spend that amount of money elsewhere and just come here for a dry martini and to check out the loads of business men in their sexy suits (:", "author": "Katie B."}

But, my glass was full and I rarely had to ask for anything. He did not hover or try to make conversation while we were at the counter which I appreciated.  I love the Chilean Sea Bass which is what I've ordered each time visiting Taidch (and why I return).  It is cooked perfectly and the sauce is great. I also ordered the Dungeness crab cocktail as a starter.  I give that a shoulder shrug and \"meh.\" For dessert, I had the bread pudding. The bread pudding was cold but the sauce was warm. It was just ok. I will likely not order it in the future. I thought it was tacky that the entire baking pan just sat on the bar and the servers plated the desert from it. The sauce was in a small crockpot next to the coffee maker and whipped cream from a can. It will be a long while before I return, only for the Sea Bass.", "author": "Danika A."}

I knew I had to partake during my visit to San Francisco.  I heard rave reviews about this place from everyone I asked for seafood restaurant suggestions, so my mom and I went to try it out for ourselves. \n\nWe walked in to the restaurant and saw the huge mahogany bar, waiters bustling around, the older white jacketed bartenders/hosts behind the bar yelling friendly banter at eachother (and guests), people lined up the entire entrance wall waiting to be seated. We went around 7 or 8 on a Saturday night and waited about 45 minutes for a table (expected). \n\nOur server was Barry. He made the experience even better--if you're going for the warm fuzzies waiter that coddles you--he's not for you. If you like someone that is efficient, tells you the best things on the menu, and dishes a little bit of sass--he's PERFECT! \n\nI was being really indecisive and asked him to help me make up my mind--he said I should have the cioppino. Explained it as seafood stew--I kind of gave him a weird look. That didn't sound very delicious. After he said-TRUST ME, and walked away, I ordered it. \n\nBest. Decision. Ever. HUGE scallops, prawns, dungeness crab meat, clams, and halibut with a tomato/white wine broth. It's sinful and amazing. I was really mad that I had filled up on the bread and couldn't eat all of the cioppino. My mom also has a gluten and dairy allergy-they were great about working around her and helping her find something she'd enjoy. They cooked hers sans butter and double checked everything to be sure it would be safe for her to eat. She had the seafood saute and ate every bite. \n\nThe first thing I did when I got back to Austin was find a recipe for Tadich Grill's Cioppino...I'm going to make it for a dinner party once I get paid again! I'll need the paycheck to be able to afford the recipe-SO much seafood in it. mmmm.", "author": "Anna B."}

I was not disappointed, the Ciopinno sauce was very tasty and well seasoned and the ratio of mussels/crab/shrimp/fish was perfect.

The service was just what you would expect at this sort of establishment - great. \n\nMy cousin was spot on when he said this place was the \"Peter Luger\" of seafood. The decor and the atmosphere are almost identical to that of the Brooklyn steakhouse. I was surprised no one was wearing a fedora or smoking a cigarette inside (yes, I know it's illegal)- I certainly felt like I was in a flashback. \n\nAt the same time though, this place lacked diversity and felt kind of like an exclusive club with most of the men wearing suits and women in business casual. I felt a little underdressed wearing just a polo and some jeans - that is until I saw a little Asian girl about 5 year old happily munching away on some crab. Suddenly, I didn't care cause it didn't seem like she cared about anything else, but the food. With that said, let me get to the best part, the food! Below is what we ordered and my rating of each dish. \n\n3/5: Clam Chowder is not the best. It was good, but there are better places by the piers. I would liken it to being a potato chowder with clams.\n\n4/5: Half Avocado with Dungeness crab was not great (it's a salad after all), but still very good. They do not skim on the crab meat, so it's certainly worth the price. The Louie dressing (in case they don't tell you what it is) is like thousand island, but with more vinegar. Think pickle/relish juice when you try it. \n\n5/5: Cioppino was a smidge from perfect, but that's only cause I can't admit it could be better than mine. \n\n5/5: Turbot Stuffed with crab and bay shrimp a la newburg, rice was my favorite dish. It's essentially a halibut's fish fillet wrapped around a crab cake and then baked in a delicious, but heavy cream sauce. Every last bite was worth the calories though! \n\n5/5: Dungeness crab legs. \nThis was an eyeopener because I am so used to doing all the labor myself. Here, it's all done for you and they give you a lot. I have paid the same for less. This plate deserves a 3 for just the lack of labor involved. \n\n3.5/5: Rib eye and Dungeness Crab legs. It was good, but not worth it. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium rare, but lacked luster. It definitely needs a steak sauce (Hint: Peter Luger sauce).\n\n3.5/5: Lobster Thermidor Baked In The Shell was only good. Not worth it in my opinion. Just go to the local seafood market and pick up your own if you want lobster.", "author": "Dennis P."}

I am a total sucker for the old-school SF vibe that this place has going on, waiters and bartenders with character in white jackets. My go to drink was well made and as it should be. \n\nWe were soon shown to our table. I was tempted by a giant seafood louie salad, but it's going to be nearly impossible to return to Tadich and not order a whole cioppino for myself! Cioppino can suffer when the components are hastily cooked together. Inevitably, you can end up with an insipid watery broth with overcooked seafood. Not so at Tadich!   The bowl is brimming with a rich seafood-tomato base, super buttery garlic bread, and an over the top jumble of in-shell clams, small bay  shrimp, scallops,  prawns, white fish, and shelled crab. I love that the crab is already shelled, so you don't have to wrestle with it and get messy. I did don the rocking Tadich bib though, just in case.

Very fresh and tasty. I got their meat raviolis in their meat sauce (meaty!) and my friend got linguine and clams. I thought my dish was just OK--the sauce was little on the sweet side and the raviolis themselves seemed a little tasteless. Filling, though--they don't skim on the portions.

Staff wear white lab coats, when we walked in and stood up front at the door, the staff behind the bar just kind of stared at us as if he was thinking \"are you expecting us to seat you, go sit down at any table.\"  He did come from behind the bar and did guide us to a table. \n\nThe food: \n\nClam Chowder (Choice of Boston or Coney Island):  Ordered the Boston style clam chowder.  Good until I started to get the sandy grains which I dislike when I get clam chowder. \n\nClams in garlic broth:  Okay, not enough garlic or butter, the clams were fresh.  I found when the waiter gave us a bottle of tabasco sauce when the clams arrived, he most likely intended for us to have it with the clams because after adding a few drops to each clam, it masked any clammy taste and gave it a smooth taste along with the garlic.  Went really well with the clams.  \n\nSauteed Scallops:  Large portions of scallops with a side of broccoli and pilaf.   I was pretty much done for before I had the scallops after all the clams, I think we went too far with the seafood.  I had one scallop which was massive in size.  It was bland and did not have much flavor other than the fishy scallop taste which I believe it was undercooked.  \n\nMinute Steak : 9 oz new york steak - Simply cooked steak.  Nothing fancy, just a grilled steak with no flavorings.  Add some A1 sauce, Lee and Perrins and you're good to go.  \n\nI'll give it 3 stars because they are keeping it simple and close to I guess how it has always been without changing its menu.  I expected fine dining, but it was no more than pub food.", "author": "W. L."}

Some of the best I have had in the city.  Not too salty, not too starchy, creamy/thick consistency, lots of clams, excellent sea flavor, very tasty.  I think my mouth watered for a moment. I had the pacific salmon.  Melted in my mouth which is odd because a lot of restaurant over cook their salmon.  Not here.  Wonderful searing.  My co-worker had the sole.  That was fabulous as well, buttery consistency but not over powering to the taste of the mild fish.  I was going to ask for a second bite but thought against it.  It really is a fantastic meal.

You get huge dishes of food for reasonable price ranges. The food wasn't superb, but hey it's an old place. It was cool cuz we got a booth too, so we had this space to ourselves. We started off with the romaine salad, calamari and the dungeness crab. The crab came in a martini glass, which contained fresh crab and lettuce. The calamari wasn't good, batter was too thick and it just made my stomach feel weird. The romaine salad was on the way oily side. Practically drowning in oil. My mom wanted to get the whole grilled branzino, but they were out, so she went with the red snapper stuffed with crab meat. A friend got the fried oysters with fries platter. My boyfriend got the special which was some fish cheeks with seafood and I got the seafood cioppino, The broth was good in the cioppino, but the mussels and clams were overcooked. My family eats clams and mussels at least once a week, so I don't like them tough. After the fried calamari, I couldn't even finish my dish, so it didn't leave a good impression on me.\n\nAlso our waiter was so odd.

And I have no reason not to believe this because Tadich's cioppino is the best I've ever had thus far.  The infusion of white wine was deliciously strong but not too overpowering, but the best part of all: the chock full of fresh fish, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp and crab that was found with each spoonful.  For $25, this bowl of soup is truly worth every penny.\n\nThe service was amazing from the beginning till the end.  From the moment my gf and I walked in and put our names down, we were greeted and served upon with a smile.

It is San Francisco's oldest restaurant and started as a coffee stand in 1849. Tadich Grill was the first to grill seafood over mesquite charcoal in the 1920s. \n\nThey reminded me of the old school steak houses of New York City.  Tadich is classified as a seafood restaurant, but the steaks have to be prime.\n\nI was so excited just to be here that I rang the doorbell, walked in and yelled, \"we're here!\"  Oh, that was a lie!\n\nOh my what a fine establishment this is. You walk in to finely dressed waiters and tables, lined along cafe curtain dressed windows. There is alot of dark wood, giving it a Tavern feel. \n\nWhen I walked in and immediately smelled char broiled steaks, I had no choice than to have the Filet Mignon. I am so smart and it was the perfect choice. The filet could be cut with a butter knife and the juicy goodness just melted on my tongue. My tongue was dancing with joy. Hubby had the NY Strip and he enjoyed every last bite. \n\nI started with the Oysters Rockefeller which were very good. Hubby had the NE Clam Chowder and my mother had the Asparagus Leek soup. For her entree she had the pan seared Rainbow Trout. \n\nEverything is Ala Carte, so plan on dropping some cash here. It is very expensive. \n\nService is top notch, by very seasoned waiters and the food selection leaves nothing to be desired. When in San Fran again, I shall try the Lobster & Crab Thermidor and ask my hubby to order the Filet, so I can still have that bite of char broiled heaven! \n\nThe desserts sounded amazing and next time I may skip the appetizer so I have room to try a dessert.\n\nJust to let you know, if you would like to check out the Tadich Grill and you are not into splurging, they do have a large selection of salads.

My friends got there early, got us on the waiting list and found 2 stools at the bar for drinks. \n\nTadich Grill is one of San Francisco's oldest restaurant. It's in a wonderful location in the Financial District. The restaurant has a lot of character. Definitely feels like old San Francisco. Loved the ambience!\nThe bartenders/waiters have a lot of character as well. \n\nHad a house Chardonnay and it wasn't too bad. We ordered calamari at the bar while waiting for my husband to arrive.  Calamari was lightly coated and very tender. Just the way I like it!! Husband arrived right when our table was called. He unfortunately missed the calamari--one of his favorite dishes!\n\nThe restaurant has boothes and tables. We were lucky to get a booth. It had a lot of privacy where we could talk without shouting. Our waiter was definitely old style--very efficient without a lot of personality. Didn't look like any of the wait staff there was under 45 years old. \n\nThe menu is extensive. It was really hard to make a decision. I finally chose the crab cakes. Hubby chose the seafood platter and both of my friends chose a seafood dish \"a la monza\". We weren't sure what that meant but the waiter explained that it was cooked in a Italian red sauce. One thing really interesting about Tadich's menu is their daily specials. They mention that they might run out in the evening. One of my friends ran into that issue when ordering the special ravioli of the day. At least there are a ton of other options.\n\nThe portions are large. They serve wonderful sourdough bread. It's thick and chewy just the way I like it. The crab cakes were delicious. Came with rice and a huge portion of creamed spinach. Everyone else was pleased with their meals as well.

Fortunately, we got there at ~11:30, as the place very quickly filled up for Friday lunchtime.\n\nI ordered a \"surf & turf\" choice, the Fillet Mignon and Jumbo Prawns, and I was delighted with the excellent beef and (obviously - for a place where seafood is a specialty) shrimp and tasty Brussel sprouts. My colleagues got the signature seafood cioppino and Crab Louie, and everyone was extremely pleased. A very pleasant surprise and a most enjoyable lunch. I am going to make a point of going back -- now that I know the place. Needless to say, it's fairly pricey -- but you certainly get what you pay for. A very good venue for a special lunch.

It is the quintessential old school San Francisco restaurant.  We arrived just before 11:30 after a trip to the Brazilian Consulate to get a visa.  In March we're doing a cruise from Valparaiso to Rio and we need Brazilian visas for our stops in Brazil.  We arrived about 10:45 and were surprised by the masses of people, some of whom had been waiting more than 2 hours.  I won't go into all that.  Suffice it to say we paid a documents processor to take care of it for us rather than wait hours and hours.  Yes, we're spoiled.  But back to Tadich's.\n\nThe restaurant was largely empty when we walked in, although as we walked through I noticed the enclosed booth-like side ares were well populated.  According to Herb Caen that's where the politicos and the \"cool kids\" sit.  We were shown to a two person table and when I looked around 15 minutes later every table I could see was occupied, as were the seats at the bar.  We were given menus and crusty sourdough French bread and butter.  There was a bowl of cut up lemons on the table.  I ordered the local Black Cod w/ Lobster sauce lunch special, which came w/ rice and brocolini.  Alan ordered the crab cakes, were had the same sides.  Both mains were excellent.  The fish was perfectly cooked and like buttah.  The crab cakes were among the best I've tasted here, easily as good as those we had in Seattle or in Virginia.  The brocolini was crisply al dente and the rice was tasty.  Service was perfunctory but correct.  This place is the real deal.  No wonder it's been around 160 years.", "author": "Toni M."}

Straight to the point, they leave you alone yet still manage to be attentive, and none of that phony nice guy routine.\n\nWhat you are really paying for is the lore of Tadich's in it's heyday and just to say that you've been there. If that's your thing, go for it. Unfortunately, Tadich Grill has become one of those SF tourist traps that gouges the dollars right out of your wallet simply because... they can.\n\nBy the way, I love chili sauce and bok choy, but this place ain't called Tadich Golden Wok.\n\nGood Tadich Grill experience: Avoid going on a weekday between the hours of 11:30am and 1:30pm (unless you're independently wealthy, fun-employed or have a ton of patience). Go inside (take a cab or public transportation there 'cause the parking blows), take a look around (\"Ooh! Aahh!\" very cool), maybe sit at the bar and have a drink (a beer or bourbon would do).

We are happy to order a drink and gab and enjoy the few minutes when waiters aren't asking us how our meal is or whether we want soup. \n\nWhen the group was seated, after our cocktails were worked on and our conversation had taken its course, our waiter came over and was the best. From the old country, Jonas recommended excellent dishes, appetizers and the like to start things off. \n\nWe ordered those, and some wine, and our main courses, and we all received our dinners in a timely fashion. There was Cioppino here, grilled sole there, a delicious crab and shrimp casserole here, pork chops there, etc. All of it was incredible, fresh and delicious, in the old world, hearty and stick-to-the-ribs kind of way. \n\nI find it sort of sad that people who review this restaurant and rate it low begrudge a waiter his efforts to earn a living. A waiter who gives extra effort with the intention of maximizing his customer's comfort and enjoyment DESERVES a tip. And the person who can afford to give said tip should feel no shame in paying for the privilege of that service. Someone who HAS money might well have EARNED it, sir! And those who DON'T have the means to tip a waiter before he's served them will STILL get excellent service. Just like we did. They may not be seated before the throng, but THAT'S WHAT THE BAR IS FOR!\n\nYes, you can have a drink before you're seated, despite info elsewhere in someone's review to the contrary. I know because all 10 or 12 of us did. Or did I imagine having a cocktail before being seated?\n\nWe Americans can be so crazy impatient. Relax, have a cocktail, don't spend so much time snarling at waiters and diners. Is that your idea of fun? \"Oh, hey Moe, I was victimized at the Tadich! Don't go there!\" C'mon! Gimme a spit-take break! And I beg your pardon, Honey, but before this country went insane, it was a term of respect and familiarity to be called honey.

We were hoping to get a booth but since we were not feeling warm fuzzies we decided to take what came first and lucky us it was a booth.

You wondered if the soup lady would yell at you \"no soup for you\" if you didn't make a quick decision. \nI ordered the cioppino and my hubby had the sand dabs. We also ordered white clam chowder. The chowder was thick and rich but needed more smokey bacon flavor. The Cioppino was out of this world. Chock full of everything from the sea (crab, scallops, shrimp, mussels, fish and clams) but the best part of it was the tasty red broth. I could have had a bowl of that with bread alone. Not only did you get fresh bread at the table but your cioppino came with two pieces of buttery grilled bread, moist and crunchy but a little soft on the inside, like the best crouton ever. I was so full I could barley move and although I tried my hardest I couldn't finish it all. The sand dabs on the other hand were nothing to write about. If you like a mild white fish like talapia, you will enjoy it but I was looking for something special. It was good but nothing special.

Two soups. Two beers. $100.00. No thanks. I'll go where my business is more appreciated and the food is prepared and --more importantly-- served with care.

I have books from the 1960s covering restaurants featuring, at the time of publication,  50 to 100 year histories. Back then they called Tadich's cuisine \"old San Francisco.\" There are some dishes in these books which I can barely imagine, and would probably never cook, like Oysters Rockefeller and some of the creamy seafood casserole concoctions. \n\nTadich's really makes me wish I lived in San Francisco earlier in the 20th century, back when my father was a kid in the Marina and his in-laws were wisely-invested in bootlegging. The no-nonsense old world decor, semi-private booths and intense seafood smell feel so regional and so ... old. That's partly why, when I saw Deviled Crab on the menu, I could not pass it up. It's a classic Old SF recipe I've read and wondered about countless times, and it's something you'd just never do to perfectly good crab. So, why not enjoy it as constructed by the experts? It was deliciously creamy without being over-rich, a little rice but not too much, and it was a very generous portion. \n\nOur nice slavic waiter in the white coat looked askance when I ordered a campari cocktail, and I had to tell him what was in it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-07-24", "description": "Giving a bad review to one of the city's oldest restaurants (since 1849!) is like bad-mouthing your grandma. The place has history. The layout is a blast from the pork-pie hats at the bar past. The waiters are friendly, funny and attentive. I respect my elders, I really do. But in the end, food just isn't that good. Ouch. Sorry, grandma.\n\nThe best dish of the night was the halibut casserole...but I believe that if you drown anything in enough cheese, it'll taste good. \n\nMy Pacific oysters trio wasn't horrible, but out of the three kinds (rockefeller, creole and curry) I only liked one: the rockefeller. The creole and curry just didn't do it. Both were as if the star ingredients were slapped on top of the oyster and forced to mingle in my mouth. Nice, but I don't think either flavor wanted to be there. And the creole? Doesn't that mean some spice? Or am I mistaken? The rockefeller was more like it, with the cheese and the spinach interacting with the oyster. But like I said before, put enough cheese on something and it'll taste good.\n\nMy friends' sole dishes was like institution food. Limp greasy fillets of fish next to string beans and a boiled potato. Everything, save for the beans, was beige. Yawn. And the only way my friend could stomach the meal was with the help of lots of tartar sauce. That's not a good sign. The meat should be tasty enough to stand on its own. Without the help of sauce.\n\nAnd the dessert? Oh the shame. Cold bread pudding and cold rice custard pudding. The bread pudding was pleasant, very sweet with bits of apple. Edible but eh, a let down. The rice custard pudding was terrifying. A slab of eggy custard on top of grainy rice? Sorry, I couldn't eat more than a few bites. Maybe if they warmed up both desserts, I could have feigned more interest but I must say this is the first time in YEARS that I haven't finished my dessert.\n\nThe only reason why I'm being so harsh with the food here is because of the prices. If I was paying Red Lobster prices, then I'd be more understanding. But when you're paying $25+ for a meal you barely care for, it hurts.\n\nLike I said, I really wanted to like this place. Everything else was enjoyable. But man, the food, the most important part, not excusable. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that maybe I should have come for lunch? Or maybe I ordered the wrong thing? But my tummy hurts right now so I'm not a happy camper.\n\nLast thoughts and tips? If you see a restaurant packed with tourists, it's probably not a good sign. And don't try splitting your bill half on plastic and half in cash. They only do one or the other.", "author": "Viv C."}

Our luck, we were staying at a hotel right down the street and taking the advice of my fellow Yelpers, we decided to stop by for dinner on 8/17. Since this establishment doesn't take any reservations, we were prepared to wait for a table. We arrived at 8:30 pm and after our customary gin and tonic at the bar, we were seated in less than 10 minutes. This would turn out to be a slow night so to our benefit, service was exceptional. \n\nOur waiter John was a newbie with only 20 years of service under his belt but from the looks of his lab coat, this old Irishman took his job very seriously: a true professional in his craft. We were immediately served some sourdough bread with warm butter on the side (not that cold stuff you get in lessor places) and decided on sharing the Crab Cake ($12.75) just to get the palate ready. I came specifically for the Seafood Cioppino ($26.25) and my girlfriend ordered the Broiled Salmon Filet ($25.75). We also shared a plate of Asparagus ($8.75). Since we were in the mood to celebrate, we had a bottle of Babcock 2007 Pinot Noir ($45.00).\n\nThe Crab Cake was great, the Salmon was exceptionally good but it was the Cioppino that took the gold medal - definitely worth the little embarrassment of having to wear a bib while you're eating it. \n\nFor desert, I had the Bourbon Bread Pudding ($7.25) and she had the Lemon Tart ($8.25). Both were excellent. Two hours and ten pounds later, we were done. Total came to $146.00 not including tip which isn't cheap but definitely comparable to any decent joint in NYC.

Even if you are in the mood for something light, the crab or prawn louie is fresh and delicious. Then again, piled on with so much seafood, you are hardly having a salad. The sourdough bread is not the best I've had but it is very good and great for dipping - chowder, creamy casseroles and hearty stews. \n\nWhile this place is certainly more straightforward than trendy, sitting at one of the booths is like dining in a private dining car (isn't that a Johnny Cash song?) where you are surrounded by dark woods and brass accents and served by a waiter in an all white jacket.

The bar service was actually the best part of the experience since our bartender was kind enough to actually provide excellent customer service, as should be expected for a higher end establishment. \n\nWhen we got seated at our table, we waited up to 15 minutes before we could even get a server to greet us and acknowledge that we were there.  There was a ceramic bowl of lemons that looked like they had been sitting there since the lunch crowd, and it was now 7:30 in the evening.  \n\nTrying to remain in good spirits, when the server did finally arrive at our table, I asked a few things about the menu, specifically about the sauteed crab leg dish.  I wanted to find out if it was already shelled for the dish.  The server responded by saying yes, it is and also added that this way, they can turn the table over faster.  Sit, eat, go.  What????  Repulsive.  A dinner that costs an average of about $30 per plate should be handled better than \"sit, eat, go\".  \n\nSo I went with the sauteed crab legs and my boyfriend had the lobster tail.  The food came to our table with the poorest presentation I had ever seen.  The vegetables were overdone, the rice was bland, and the crab meat was tough probably because they cooked and shelled it with the early morning prep.  My boyfriend's very expensive lobster ($50) was tough and overcooked, accompanied by a mediocre stuffed tomato and the same disgusting vegetables.\n\nI would not recommend this place beyond the bar scene.", "author": "Angela C."}

Don't get me wrong, I liked Aqua (see my review) but Tadich is different.. different like a well worn leather jacket, that looks and feels better every time you wear it. Step into Tadich and step  back a few years... maybe a 100 or more. The center bar is the hub and center of the action. Tables surround the bar in small clusters and narrow aisles. Grab a pint at the bar you feel the action and energy of the place, but once seated Tadich becomes a warm and cozy dining spot. There are no reservations, so grab that drink and expect to wait a little while... it's worth it though.\n\nThe food is simple, fresh and nicely prepared. Warm sourdough bread is a great way to start any meal. Follow that with some large, generously topped Oysters Rockefeller and you'll be doing the happy dance before your entree hits the table. I've had the grilled halibut  steak twice and I have to say I will no doubt order it again the next time I'm here. Thick, flaky, tender on the inside with golden-brown grill marks as the only embellishment. Sides are simple - like Mom would do it, and my Mom is a good cook. My gf ordered the Petrale Sole Filet which I liked, but not nearly as much as the halibut steak. It was pan-fried beautifully, but had a creamy sauce I didn't love. Dessert isn't fancy, but we split a sour cream cheesecake and were quite happy. \n\nWheelchair access: Getting in is easy, there's even an automatic door. Space is a bit tight seeing as it was built way before the ADA. Some of the tables clearly wouldn't be good to sit at if you were in a chair - either you'd be in the way or too cramped to dine comfortably. The staff however knows what they're doing and will seat you at a good table. Sometimes this means a shorter wait as they'll jump you up the list if one of the good tables opens up...  other times they might have you wait a bit longer for a good table. Trust them, they want you to enjoy your dinner. I'm not sure about the bathroom situation, might be tough getting to though even if it is accessible.", "author": "Ken O."}

The restaurant is bustling during peak hours but still intimate with dim lighting and gorgeous, dark wood partitions that divide the room into cozy compartments.  It's got an air of old timey romance that no top-notch restaurant decorator can conjure with distressed furniture and faux antiques.  Do try to arrive before noon for lunch and 5:30pm for dinner, especially if you're a pair and don't want to sit at the two-tops in the main passage between the kitchen and the dining room that feel a bit exposed.  \n\nSeafood and grilled meats are the specialty here, with the cioppino--a mountain of crab, fish, prawns, scallops, and tiny bay shrimp in a robust tomato broth--being Tadich's thing.  Eat it proudly wearing the paper Tadich Grill bibs they bring.  The steaks are fabulous and come with huge \"longbranch\" potatoes, which are like fries on steroids.  Other highlights include the mixed fried seafood, clam chowder, and the crab bisque.  I have yet to try the other Tadich treat of hangtown fry, which is supposed to be a gold rush legend.  Definitely get a cocktail to ease into your lovely dinner.  The drinks are stiff and they come with a green and gold cable car swizzle stick.  Just, please, don't order an appletini or flirtini or whatever--make it classic, like a martini (with gin) or Manhattan.\n\nThe service here, I think, is superb in a sexy steely, manly way.  Just the sight of the waiters in their white jackets and long aprons gliding along is a pleasure.  (On my many visits here, I've seen a woman server once)  The staff here aren't the chummy modern-day waitstaff who squat next to the table whilst taking your order or write \"thank you!\" with a heart on your check.

I loved the classic \"old school\" feel of the place, and the fish, while simply prepared, was always fresh and the portions generous. It had been at least 10 years since I had visited Tadich, and looking for a classic San Francisco experience to entertain some out of towners, we decided Tadich would be the perfect place. What a mistake. Where to begin? The waiters and bartenders who still wore their freshly starched and pressed classic white jackets and who once welcomed you as if you had just arrived at the best party in town, have grown bitter and downright rude. As we waited for our table, I was shocked and offended to hear racist jokes being told to a customer by one of the bartenders. Next, he yucked it up loudly with a couple who he pressured to tip him $20, on two cocktails, for which they received a ring of the bar bell, signifying their stupidity.\nOnce we finally were sat, the evening got progressively worse. As so many other yelpers have also complained about, our waiter was downright rude. It was to the point that we thought perhaps we were on Candid Camera and in a moment Alan Funt, Jr., would come out and make us all blush on National television. No such luck. \n\nIt is not even worth going into telling you the sordid details of how poor the service was. Suffice it to say, our waiter was horrible in virtually all regards. \n\nAs many have said, the Cioppino was excellent. That's why Tadich got my one star.\n\nBased on my recent experience, I can certainly see why management may be taking stock of its staff as some have written about.  The Tadich has a reputation to uphold as a \"classic old-school\" San Francisco restaurant.\" There was nothing \"classic old-school\" about the attitude, rudeness, and ineptitude of the staff we encountered.

We were seated quickly despite hearing it would be a 30 minute wait. We had a couple of yummy cocktails while we waited and the bartenders were great: Just the right amount of wiseguy attitude and helpful friendliness. \n\nOur server was an old timer who really knew his stuff. He helped us pick out a bottle of wine and I was impressed that he recommended the cheaper of two we liked. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was just meh. \n\nFor appetizers I got the sliced tomato salad. I thought the salad was fine. The vinaigrette had a bit too much oil and not enough zest so I ended up using sliced lemons instead. Husband got a half dozen oysters. He said that of the six oysters, two were great, two were just okay and two were mushy. I'm not an oyster eater myself, but I am pretty sure that mushy is a bad thing. \n\nI ordered the fillet minion. It was cooked medium rare and had a nice crust on the outside but the meat itself had very little flavor and a slightly mealy texture. I used steak sauce to perk it up. Sadness. The side of mixed veggies came unpleasantly cold even though my steak was nice and hot. I vetoed the cold veg. \n\nHusband ordered the cioppino. He was disappointed that they pre-shelled the crab legs but tucked in enthusiastically as he is a seafood freak. He felt that overall, the sauce was lacking that robust kick that you expect from cioppino.  Also he thought it was too bad that a place that prides itself on its seafood should fill out the cioppino with mostly bay shrimp. \n\nWe had champagne and the bourbon bread pudding for dessert. It was just fine. \n\nI really wanted to love this place, given the history and the wonderful staff, but I just can't justify shelling out that much cashola for a dinner that is so far from excellent.", "author": "Miss Information X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-02", "description": "I've known of Tadich Grill for almost 30 years, 15 years when I lived in San Francisco and the last 14 in St. Louis, but I never ate there. Don't exactly know why, I even used to work downtown SF, but just never got around to it.  I always knew it was a good place for seafood, but I didn't go there ... until today (7/2/2010) and I was fully and totally blown away.\n\nMaybe it was the day (70 degrees F, sunny and not foggy all week).  Maybe it was nostalgia, as I was at the end of an 8 day conference here and leaving tomorrow.  Maybe it was the pent up anxiousness about really getting to eat at a landmark that I had always wanted to eat at.  Whatever it was, it worked today.\n\nFirst of all, it was lunch. It opens at 11a and I remember it always had a line out the door by noon, so I went at 10:30a and was first in line (ok, so I might have been a little overzealous, but it's who I am :-)).  Let's just say I was determined to eat here today.\n\nI got a corner table near the front, with pressed white table cloths and napkins, and no waiter under 50 years old ... good way to start a classic SF dining experience.\n\nTo my way of thinking, at a fresh seafood place, the order in which you consume the food is also important, as some of the oils and sauces might alter the taste of the food being consumed.  So I had a half dozen fresh oysters, crab and avocado salad, and a bowl of clam chowder, in that order.\n\nThe fresh oysters were Pacific oysters from Washington State (Crassotrea gigas (scientific name) - Pacifics originally came from Japan in the 1940s, part of the war reparations, I imagine).  These were plump and so very fresh.  I ate the first three without any sauces just to get the true flavor.  And then I mixed the freshly ground horseradish with the cocktail sauce and added that to the other three.  All amazingly good (I have to watch out because i may run out of superlatives soon).\n\nThen I ordered the dungeness crab (my favorite kind of crab) and avocado salad.  Sometimes when you order such a salad at other places, you get a big pile of iceberg lettuce with a little bit of crab and a couple of pieces of either too hard underripe or too dark and too soft overripe avocado.  No this place.  It was one of the most delicious salads I have ever had.  It was served on a large white oval place with a thin layer of extremely fresh and sweet romaine lettuce. Next was a layer of the best and freshest dungeness crab I have ever tasted, both claw and meat from the body under the shell, sweet and briny and (did I say) fresh. The next layer was a half an avocado, cut thinly and covering the crab, and the avocado was PERFECTLY ripe.  Not hard, not too soft, sweet and creamy with several shades of green.  Beautiful.  And then there were also a couple of Greek olives, 1/4 hard boiled egg, big sweet wide carrot ribbons, thick cucumber slices, and the obligatory parsley, with the Louie dressing on the side (very important).  So I ate the top layer of vegetables first, fresh with only dipping a little of them in the Louie dressing and then I ate the crab, bite at a time, savoring each one, no Louie dressing here.  Then I ate some of the romaine, spotted with the Louie dressing, which was also exceptional.  Not a thousand island like some give you, but their own house blend, thinner and easy to eat. \n\nThen I had a bowl (I ordered a cup, but it came in a bowl, I'm not complaining, I assure you) of their New England, white clam chowder, which was THE BEST clam chowder I have ever had, and I've had a lot of clam chowders. (My now next best favorite is the Legal Seafood clam chowder btw.)  And finished that with some slices of their amazing crusty sourdough bread and butter.\n\nSo I just sat there with every mouthful shaking my head in wonderment and saying \"wow\" to myself. And the service was impeccable and my server, the maitre d', and all the staff were very, very helpful.\n\nAt the end, I had tears in my eyes in tribute to this meal (I also cry at Lassie reruns btw).  It is now my new best meal ever and it was definitely worth waiting 30 years for, definitely!  But it won't be another 30 before I return, I assure you. \n\nMy visit to Tadich Grill was simply put a peak experience in my life.", "author": "Mark P."}

The waiter asked us if we cared for appetizers or salads. We said no thank you. He looked very disappointed again. We ordered petrale sole and the mixed grille.  \n\nWe were ignored with burned bread and no water until the food came. When the food arrived, the portions were small and there were 3 french fries on each plate. We said nothing, ate our food and signaled the waiter for our check. When the waiter came to the table, he asked us if we cared for dessert or coffee. We said no thank you. He seemed again disappointed.\n\nWe came to Tadich for a quick good meal. We left there hungry, and annoyed at the waiter who kept trying to sell us items we did not want. We realize the waiters make over $100,000.00 or more at Tadich, but they should not be trying to up their check averages as to get higher tips.\n\nI am a native San Franciscan. I have gone to Tadich sporadically all my life. The quality has slipped substantially. The restaurant is not focused on quality or value, but on check averages and volume.\n\nThe waiters are pompous and need a lesson in humility. They need to  understand that the customer is the focus, not their wallet. When someone orders water with no ice, do not bring a glass full of ice because you feel jilted because the customer did not order a $10.00 cocktail.\n\nI like professional waiters who are usually caring, and real professionals. I tip them accordingly. However I felt Jannis my waiter was not deserving of a tip. I left a 15% tip anyway.\n\nI will not be going back to Tadich. This is my goodbye.

The Clam chowder was great, a little too thick, but has great flavor and lots of clams and potatoes.  The caesar was excellent, not too eggy with yummy (mild) anchovies.\n\nI've only ever sit at the bar because the waiters crack me up.

Alarm bells started ringing when I discovered it was started by Croatians and continues to be heavily Croatian.  \n\nIf you travel to Croatia you will be treated to a wealth of sour-faced servers and mediocre but expensive food.  You may even get fleeced by a cop.  No surprise to find that Tadich Grill offers a small taste of a trip to Croatia, (minus the potential to get fleeced by a cop).\n\nIf you're into old-school you will probably like this place.  Decor seems frozen somewhere between 1920 and 1940.  Choose a stool at the prodigious bar counter or a secluded booth.  The staff wear classic white coats.  Unfortunately what comes from the kitchen is also straight out of the 1940's.

I guess \"best\" is always subjective right?\n\nAnyway, the chowder itself was good - no complaints. They give you a hunk of sourdough bread too which is perfect for dunking.\n\nThe pain points were that there is a $11.50/person minimum charge - LAME! So our server wasn't all too thrilled when the majority of us only wanted a cup of chowder ($6.95). Annoyed/exasperation was written all over his (wrinkly) face but in the end, he let us slide - so thank you for that! Oh, and it's $8.95 for a bowl.\n\nSo okay, it's one of SF's oldest restaurants so just take this with a grain of salt because it's coming from a 20-something year old.

I am always skeptical of places with HUGE menus because how can chefs prepare that many different meals at once and make each one really good...   Maybe I'm just paranoid about ordering something I don't like and paying $30 for it. I ordered a tuna salad with some sort of dried fish on top of it (see i can't even remember!) It was good and the lettuce was fresh. Everyone comes here for the sand dabs and that was initially what I was going to order.  My dad ordered it instead and I was glad I got the salad.  The sand dabs were extremely delicate and literally tasteless.  I like my fish to have a little more flavor and sustenance.  It's a restaurant that is famous for its bar and the fact that it's pretty old but I got the feeling that the wait staff there were arrogant, grumpy and just done with being nice to paying customers.

Today's was creamed Swiss chard.  \n\nThis historic venue has an old world feel,  with wood paneled walls and they even have a buzzard installed right by your table so that you can request for a waiter to bring you an extra bloody Mary, extra sauce or what have you.

We were third in a line of about 10 people -- the restaurant wasn't crowded at all.  \n\nThe host was rude and arrogant.  He simply informed us that he would not seat us until the entire party had arrived.  We asked about having a drink first while waiting for our friend who had phoned that he was about 10 minutes away.  The host responded that he could seat us at a table for six, but when our seventh friend arrived, he would have to sit at the bar by himself.  We were so astounded at this attitude that we decided to leave.  I should note that there was no sign in the window or at the host's podium that said \"All members of a party must be present in order to be seated.\"  Nor did the host seem at all inclined to give any explanation -- let alone express any regret -- \"Gee, I'm sorry, but I am not able to seat any party until  the entire party is here,\"\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who expects professional courtesy or a welcoming attitude toward visitors to San Francisco.    Who cares what the food tastes like if the attending staff make you crawl to get a seat?  In fact, I would go so far as to say that this host's attitude ruined an otherwise pleasant trip to northern California.\n\nSo we walked about four blocks to the Yank Sing Chinese Restaurant in the old Post Office Building for dim sum.  Oddly enough, our \"late\" seventh friend beat us there -- as one in a party of seven, he was able to hold a table in a large, bustling restaurant for the rest of us!

The stew had generous portions of  scallops, shrimp, and mussels to name a few. The cioppino was excellent if a tomato based broth is your thing. On a side note the place is so busy that is can be a little difficult to really relax and enjoy your food...but that's just me.

I came here yesterday before hitting up the St. Patty's day festivities and was not impressed.  We were walking down California looking for some food to grab and we saw this grill.  We didn't bother looking at the menu because we thought grill means sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc.\n\nWe sat down right away at a very nice private looking table and had water and sourdough bread waiting for us at the table....those are my 2 favorite things and the reason that I gave 2 stars.  Our water never got less than half full and that is a big help.\n\nDo not bring someone here who doesn't like seafood because it is 95 percent seafood.  It is also really expensive.  They have a lot of different types of seafood and some interesting looking salads, but the guy that was at our table ordered a salad and it was an average sized salad, not too big, not too small, but it was 20 dollars!!!!!  You also need to make sure that you read the fine print in the menu because each seat has to spend at least 11 dollars which is almost impossible not to do, you can split a plate, but it will cost you 9 dollars, and they can split a check, but they will only split it equally and only on 4 credit cards.  We only had 4 people in our party and we all had cash anyways so it wasn't a big deal, but if you go to dinner with someone just know that if they order the 40 dollar beef medallions and you order the 20 dollar salad, you will be paying the same amount!\n\nOur waiter was old and kind of....let's just say weird for lack of a better word.  He asked us if we wanted any appetizers and while I was perusing the appetizers that were an average price of 15 dollars, he grabbed the menu out of my hand!  Guess I won't have any!  He dropped off a side of dressing at our table and his thumb was in the dressing as he put it on the table, but did he apologize and bring a new one?  No, he left that one and sucked the dressing off his thumb as he walked away!!!  Raise your hand if you think he washed his hands after that...nobody?

However, this is a dish which when prepared masterfully is served right after the dish is done. Otherwise the scallops, shrimp, shell fish and fish get tough. And tough they are at Tadich. The portion at $31.00 is double what any fatman needs, but it does encourage the guest to make it at home to discover seafood that has not been leatherized. My wife had the crabcakes, and said, as she always says, \"They're bettter in Maryland!\" Howver, I'm beginning to think that might have something to do with ambiance and nostaligia. I love the setting, old wood, waiters in white, hints of another earlier era. It is a place not be missed, one of SF's treasures.", "author": "David Z."}

It's a sea food place for me. I have never tried anything else. I always start with the crab cocktail, then a fish, usually petrale sole or poached salmon in egg sauce, with fries, a side of spinach, a glass of white wine, and their sourdough bread that is like no other. If I have room, then the rice pudding, and if I'm really feeling decadent, I pour some cream over it. I love the atmosphere, always sit at the counter, preferably as close to the kitchen as possible to overhear the banter. You can get a book on the history of the Tadich Grill, or Tadich's as it's known to regulars.

I went with my dining out buddy as our last San Francisco meal before we both moved away for graduate school, and I think we were more pleased to be there than we necessarily were with the food. That is not to say that my grilled Pacific Salmon wasn't well-cooked and tasty, but simply that the Tadich Grill is the kind of place I'd go back to for the experience rather than the food. The portions are giant, so if I return when I'm back in SF, I'll definitely split my plate with someone else. But I would not split my drinks: Tadich makes strong-ass cocktails.

The long bar, the dark wood, the brass, the over-50 brick-faced European-accented waiters... All that rates five stars. And the food, I hear you say? Well that is a well trodden road with a few potholes.\n\nFirst off, do not even set foot in the place if you are only interested in trendy, stylized food being noshed on by metro 20-something's who haven't got a freakin' clue what they are eating. This is old school baby. This is food that is totally stuck in the '60s. No fancy presentations, no miniature portions, nothing is done three ways and all of the ingredients can be found at your local Safeway. Once you understand all that, and really appreciate it, then it's easy to settle in to an ice-cold Manhattan, a bowl of Boston chowder and an obscenely rich crab leg saute.\n\nThe catch is that most of the time it'll be great and but you will get some times where it will be crap.\n\nThe sweetbreads (on the rare times that they serve them) are flawlessly prepared. Tender, buttery and delicious. The lobster thermador on the other hand turned out extremely tough, bitter and otherwise flavorless. The mequite broiled porterhouse steak is surprisingly excellent. And so on. Also, the service can be a bit more brusque than I'd like. I always order my Manhattans \"up\" and when I was brought one that was \"rocks\" I returned it and the bar-tender got a little pissy about it. So due to the occasional bad meal and the occasional bad service, I have to sadly give them only four stars... but I really want to give them five.", "author": "Thomas S."}

Since I was happy he didn't insist on Chinese food, I accepted.  \n\nI warn you to expect a wait and you need to listen carefully for your name b/c they read it twice and they move on.  There is no effort to be made to find you.  And since the restaurant's acoustics are off the charts, it can be difficult to hear your name.\n\nThe interior looks as if hasn't been altered in forever so that is nice.  We got a coveted spot in one of  those great old fashioned private booths.  I only wish that the call bell still worked!  And for good reason, the service is inattentive.  They seem to have an apathetic manner based on the endless line of patrons.  \n\nThe cioppino is definitely the thing to get.  The tomato broth has pleasant depth and spice.  The seafood is very fresh and the portions are quite large.  I loved the two huge  hunks of garlic bread to sop up the broth.  I ordered the sand dabs which were a little greasy for me.  The roasted potatoes were quite tasty and the veggie medley was passable.  I was simply amazed at the amount of seafood they give you.  \n\nThe desserts were unimpressive.  Our waiter suggested the triple chocolate mousse and panned the other desserts.  I give him points for being honest.  The triple chocolate mousse was passable.

We ordered creamed spinach (my favorite and a dish I enjoyed the evening prior at Morton's) and it never was served.

My husband didn't want to leave a tip but I insisted so at least the bus boys serving water would not be forgotten.  As we left and told the maitre de our dissatisfaction, he remained jovial and made light of it.  The place is busy.  They turn tables every 40 minutes and are open restricted hours.

Yes, we are that car that can be seen with bits of paper flying out open windows. \n\nTraffic was clear and we parked allowing us about an hour and a half for dinner. Beth suggested we stop into Tadish Grill; she stated she had a fondness for their seafood salad. We entered the establishment and were provided two seats at the bar immediately.  I love eating at bars. Tadish's is one of those old historic San Francisco restaurants that have been around since the 1800's.  Private cozy booths, plenty of wood paneling, and wait staff in matching white dinner jackets. Beth tells me that the private dining booths were used for men having dinner with their hookers \"back in the day.\" Women were not allowed to go out to dinner \"back in the day.\"  I don't know where she gets this stuff, it could be true. Beth likes to say, \"back in the day.\"  My friend usually speaks with such conviction that if you didn't know her you would think she knows things, but usually 75% of the things she speaks of is wrong or inaccurate.

I opt for an old fashioned favorite - breaded veal cutlet with pasta and veggies, Beth orders red chowder and the seafood salad that she was craving.

It is definately large enough plate to make it a full meal and the best Cioppino i've ever had.\nAs for my husband, he had the mesquite charbroiled swordfish. It has all the charbroiled flavor with non of the over cooked rubbery texture. Fish remains very moist and tender inside.\n\nIt was definately a well worth paying experience!\n\nPlan ahead.  Get there right before dinner rush....that way, doesnt matter if they take reservations or not, or how long the wait is...you'll most likely have a good experience with their service as well as their food that's not being rushed out during dinner peak time.

We heard that there might be a wait because of the restaurant's popularity so we went early. Upon arriving at 5:30pm we were seated at the bar with no wait (which was a good thing because people started lining up shortly afterward). My friend ordered the seafood cioppino and I had the Dungeness crab and prawns a la Monza. Both dishes were delicious! They were both piping hot and fresh. Now, some reasons this place didn't receive 5 stars is because the servers seem to usher you in and get you out for the next waiting customer. The drinks are not refillable. Also, we had originally ordered an appetizer, the lobster bisque, but we had learned that they had run out after waiting 20 minutes which by that time our main entrees had arrived.

Our waiter, Laurent, is a frenchman, and a spicy one at that. He gave us very wonderful suggestions for food and we were not disappointed. The crab cake that I ordered had lots of crab in it, and was soooo good. The fried calamari was hands down THE BEST that i have had anywhere. It was meaty, tender (not rubbery), crunch on the outside, with a hint of wasabi. Just superb. I couldn't stop eating it. I pretty much stole the whole plate from my hubby and ate it all. We also ordered the clam chowder, which, I must say, I have had better, but it had almost all the essentials (rich, hearty, full of clams and potatoes) that I simply couldn't complain.

After the recent article in the Chron about it, I went there last week, and was underwhelmed. First of all, even though it was at an odd hour and there were some empty, small tables, their policy is to never give a single diner a table. Usually I like sitting at the bar, but I was tired, and I had a big tote bag with me, and just wanted to relax. Although I didn't this time, I usually spend as much as two people when I try a good restaurant, having wine, appetizers, dessert and not the cheapest thing on the menu. So, I was sort of miffed at this policy. Oh well. The bar was OK. But, the tastiest things on the fried seafood platter (oysters, scallops, fish, shrimp)  were not seafood: delicious broccoli and french fries.  The oysters were pretty good, because their flavor was so strong as to stand up to the breading. The rest of the seafood was tasteless.   BIG disappointment.  There are way better places, including Pacific Cafe, where I've never had anything that wasn't lip-smackin' good.  I realized at the end of my Tadich meal that I had had the exact same opinion the last time I was there about five years ago.

First the bartender, damn I wish I knew his name (tall skinny dude with slicked back hair) was wayyyy cool and really talkative. I was standing against the wall waiting for my wife while waiting for our table and this guy leans through the crowd of people to ask me what I want to drink, I didn't want one at the time but all of a sudden I did. I told him I was waiting for my pregnant wife and he made a shirley temple for her with extra cherries, just overall a real great attitude on him. When we got seated which was quite fast for no reservations on a friday night our waiter was on point and gave his recommendations, again a real cool and funny guy.

People are lining up at the door for the fresh seafood prepared in standard ways with such skill and reliability, Silicon Valley folks might call it an ISO 9000 operation.\n\nThe thing about Tadich is, it's almost anti-trendy.  They're into very fresh seafood with butter, lemon, and parsley, or something similarly simple.  Naturally the local seafood is the preferred choice.  Red snapper was probably swimming yesterday, while lobster was probably flown in from Alaska or Maine, in a time period only slightly longer but using lots more fuel and ice.\n\nMy last Tadich meal was on a Saturday, a good day to visit for lunch because the business line isn't there and you can usually sit down and eat immediately (they're really quick if there's not a huge line).\n\nMy mother ordered an appetizer; I got the red snapper.  Her appetizer was about three-quarters of what I'd call a meal, and my snapper was more than I could eat.  Fortunately she ate about a fifth, so we didn't have to leave anything.\n\nSimple, reliable, high quality, fresh seafood.", "author": "Chuck D."}

I love it there and would recommend it to anyone, whether a tourist or a local. Forget trendy and chic. This place defines Old School San Francisco. No pretense, no airs -- think traditional steak house but for seafood.\n\nThe service was great and super friendly. And the food was awesome. Started with oysters Rockefeller, had shrimp cocktail as well. I had the swordfish steak, which is a good as swordfish gets.\n\nThe house specialty is crab cakes. Don't leave without getting one. Among the best crab cakes I've ever had. It was the highlight of the meal.\n\nI only knock it down a notch because of the price. I know you have to pay for quality seafood, but I still found the prices exorbitant. Perhaps the place feels it caters to a business crowd, but I was there on the weekend for lunch. The price would keep me from going there on a regular basis; it's just too much.\n\nSo go and experience it, or go for a special occasion.

Went with the sand dabs based on some reviews here (as well as some TV shows I've seen in the past).  While tasty (nice light breading, tasty subtle sauce), they were by no means something to write home about.  The bigger issue I had was with the oysters.  You can get some phenomenal oysters in San Francisco, so one would expect that they are sourcing similar fresh ingredients at a place like Tadich.  Minimal preparation required -- store correctly, make sure the stock turns over quickly enough to keep them fresh, shuck and serve.  One would think this would be child's play for the folks at Tadich, but these were pretty much the worst oysters I've ever had (and my dining companions agreed).  Not one or two bad ones, but all two dozen were a little funky, mealy, and lacked any semblance of ocean flavor that makes oysters so great.  Granted, I don't try oysters at every restaurant I visit (I'm sure you could find a worse set at some dodgy pub in the middle of nowhere), but there's really no excuse here.

All I can say is, TRY IT  with plenty of Tabasco.  It will cure anything that ails you.  Really.  The portions are generous at Tadich.

A bowl of soup is a large enough to be your entree.  \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:  If you are looking for a light lunch  (i.e., no entree) or want to have a few martinis and a light lunch, don't try to sit at a table.  The waiters get surley with people who don't order enough food.   Instead, grab a seat at the bar and eat and drink to your heart's content.

Order a simple preparation of fish (no one, and I mean no one, makes a better Petrale sole). Or, if you are tired of fish, pay whatever absurd price they are charging for lamb chops, because as far as I can tell there are no better lamb chops in Northern California, and maybe not in the United States.\n\nAnd in recommending the petrale, once you have had that, you have to have the sand dabs in season (hardly anyone else offers them and no one does it better) and if you like salmon or really good halibut, that also is something that should be on your list.", "author": "oz c."}

The menu is straightforward, with calf's liver, hamburgers, lamb and pork chops, chicken, and four cuts of steak coming off the charcoal grill, but it's the large selection of seafood in a wide variety of preparations that's the main draw. The cioppino, overloaded with clams, prawns, scallops, bay shrimp, whitefish, and crab meat, is among the best in town, as is the  excellent sourdough bread, guaranteed to be every carb-counter's downfall. Hopefully you'll be seated in one of the enclosed booths, complete with a doorbell to summon the notoriously cantankerous waiters.

It's an old school decor, very classy and the waiters are dressed in white jackets and very pleasant.  We had to wait about 45-60 minutes to be seated, but time flies when you're drinking!!  We started with some clams and oysters and both got the Cioppino for the entree.  It was definitely a healthy serving with good chunks of fish and seafood in a delicious broth.  I had to ask for extra bread to soak every bit of the broth.  If you're ever out in SF, I highly recommend you stop by for their Cioppino.  They don't take reservations, so get there early if you want to avoid the long wait.  The cost of the meal can add up quickly, but it's well worth it with the high quality food and service you get!

The octopus was good, but the salad was way too sweet for my liking. I would of preferred it served with a regular vinaigrette or something. But i still ate it because of the good, not chewy, octopus.\n\nThe cioppino i got was probably the best dish i had all week in SF, with the HOPR's king Henry cut a close second. I had never heard of this dish before, and so have no other version to compare it to. But it was verging on perfect for me. The broth was saucy, but not too thick or thin. And packed with flavor. All of the seafood was very good, and the fish was not overcooked which can happen easily in seafood stews. The toasted bread that it came with was all used up soaking up the sauce. I was so full but happy when done with my bowl. \n\nOur waiter was one of those old school types, he didn't write anything down and was not afraid to voice his opinion on what he thought, which was refreshing. But i did bet my boss that he would get someone wrong on our order, and sure enough he did, although as soon as we pointed it out he was aware of it and took care of it right away. \n\nVery pleased with my whole experience here, and would go back again for sure.

I usually do not like cioppino because it tastes fishy, but the seafood in this cioppino was fresh and there was nothing fishy tasting about this dish.  The tomato broth was just the right consistency and flavor, and the seafood was to die for (crab, shrimp, fish, clams, etc.).  There was more than enough to share and take home.   \n\nMy friend had the seared scallops.  While I do not usually order scallops because they are usually overcooked and chewy, these scallops were done to perfection.  They were flaky and buttery and just melted in your mouth.  For anyone that loves scallops, these should not be missed.\n\nTadich is a SF landmark and should not be missed.  Though you need to be ready to wait as this place is often very crowded.", "author": "Deborah H."}

There must be ANOTHER \"oldest restaurant in S.F.\", one that WASN'T a nightmare experience. Then, I see the comments on service such as \"obnoxious and a-holish\"....\"sarcastic\"...and, sure enough--I was in the same poor excuse for a restaurant. The wait staff apparently have the same deal as school teachers with tenure--once they stay past old age, you just can't get rid of them no matter what they do. Really, from the moment we entered, we got shabby treatment. No one acknowledged us. The bar staff did not know their products. (How is that possible when they've been there since Moses floated down the Nile?) The singular friendly person there, a man, offered us a taste of the Bloody Mary Mix--their signature drink. It was the same as any generic V-8-like mix. Signature drink???  When, we were lead to our table, I mistakenly thought we were going to sit at the first empty table I saw. The waiter leading us said, harshly, \"Not that one!\" Then, as we had been waiting a while and already decided what to order, we told him that we were ready to order. To which he responded, \"I'm not your waiter.\" Um, ok, well, then let the waiter know. Normal, right? Our \"real\" waiter was less than friendly. It seems like they don't fully grasp the concept of working for tips. I asked for recommendations for something vegetarian. I know, I know, this is a surf and turf place, but even such places have veggie options, usually made up of delicious side dishes, etc. Nothing like that here. The ONE option was a plate of steamed \"rabbit food\": random veggies which waiter told me were not seasoned, just plain, served with boiled potatoes. UGH. What is this, Ireland? I asked if I could get a couple of side dishes in a half order. NO. Seemed everything was a \"no\", not even willing to ask the kitchen. They were so unaccomodating. Our food--TOTALLY MEDIOCRE AND WAY OVER-PRICED. They charged $18 for what was basically a small bowl of Rice-a-Roni with mushrooms on top. Regular, button mushrooms--you know, the cheap ones--not anything exotic i.e. expensive. My friend got Chilean bass and said it was good. But, she, too, was put off by the horrid service. Then, for the FINALE, a second waiter (why?) came by to ask if we wanted dessert. We said that we did. He then left and came back with our check! Huh. We just sat there, dumbfounded. TOTALLY CLUELESS as to why this establishment is so popular. It, in a word, sucks.", "author": "Sadie J."}

Being as my family and I were in town for Memorial weekend, decided to pay a visit, also in part due my fellow Yelpies reviews. MISTAKE!!!  I would have given a one star rating, but I gave it two as the maitre'd and the bartender helped boost the rating. The wife had scallops, B+, son had lamb chops, B+, daughter ordered the New York steak med rare, D+, came med well and tasteless, and I had the same as Emeril L. had .... Hang town Fry. A frittata of bacon and oysters. I give it a D-! It was nothing like what the TV show had. I could have done better at home. I got back home last night, and this morning I got the ingredients and actually 'pleasured myself'. The appetizer Tadich platter came without the crab legs and oysters. When we asked for them it was only said that they were coming. They never did. Finally the waiter...at one point you have to stop keeping them as an institution. I am beginning to wonder if he was Mr. Tadich? He acted like he was. The only other place I have seen this attitude was at Gallagher's in NYC. The ' I don't really have to be here' attitude.

I wanted to like them because locals waiting in the line for food can't all be wrong, because people were celebrating anniversaries and birthdays and maybe because Bourdain liked them. I had the Cioppino and my wife got the pan-fried sand dabs. The Cioppino broth was excellent, the fish wasn't the best (as they claim) and the garlic bread was very ordinary. The thick cut fries that came with my wife's dish were stone cold and she sent them back. She had also asked for the fish to be boned but she found more than a couple of bones later on.  I have been thinking maybe it wasn't the right place for us (like perhaps being too old school for us) but then indifferent service, hurried food and middle-of-the-road quality seafood for a dish that cost more than $30 is just not right.

I had a glass of Pinot Grigio on the recommendation of my server and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I ordered oysters on the half shell to start, the seafood saute (prawns, scallops and BIG pieces of crab leg meat with a white whine/garlic/butter sauce) and bread pudding for dessert. I dearly wish I had caught my server's name so I could recommend him to everyone. The prices are a little high... I was eating alone and spent about $70 before tip.

It survives and thrives because the better far outweighs the worse.\n\nThe food is centered on top quality, very fresh seafood.  The preparations range from simple (mesquite grilled swordfish) to more complex classics (lobster and crab thermidor) with very little evidence of any influence of the culinary trends of the last 3 or 4 decades.  I am surpised that some people find it \"pricey\"; given the quantity and quality of the seafood, the prices are reasonable (though not cheap).\n\nThe service is formal and efficient without any of the casual chit chat or fawning that many have grown accustomed to.\n\nThe decor is classic art-deco that does not need to be updated because it is timeless (though here and there a little bit of paint would be helpful).\n\nThe drinks are made by bartenders who know their stuff.

Sushi?  Absolutely.  Cooked fish? Not so much.  I went here one day with my GM to discuss some new hires we were thinking of bringing on, and wow...  I haven't ever had swordfish like that before in my life.  Everything was fresh, well-portioned, and had very simple flavors.  I hate nothing more than when 15 different flavors are present on one place.  They keep the food simple, well-seasoned, and executed extremely well.\n\n#2-  The decor is simple.  I also hate restaurants that go out of their way to create an over-the-top theme.  Keep it simple, keep it about the food, and you keep me happy.  Nothing but a long counter, wooden floors, and white napkins here.  \n\n#3-  My only negative- the service is somewhat unique here.  While the men & women in white lab coats aren't exactly attentive, they do bring a certain \"old San Francisco\" charm to the establishment, and I can't dock them any stars for that. \n\nTadich is a San Francisco institution, and I would argue everyone should experience this place at least once in their lives.

I went the other evening (on a weeknight, and early-ish), having persuaded my husband & son that the wait wouldn't be too bad & the food well worth any wait. Alas, we were all disheartened by the experience. We had to wait for nearly an hour, pressed standing against the wall behind the bar, with people passing to & fro constantly, people at the bar in front of us sitting with young babies on their laps, drinks being passed to us standees over the heads of those seated in front of us, shouts from the headwaiter at the front of the room,summoning people whose table was ready---it was bedlam, boring, tiring, noisy. Somehow the barkeep managed to keep his cool & remain pleasant despite lots of very boorish customers, & the same goes for our waiter when we were finally seated. However, my calamari salad was overloaded with non-calamari items, the steaks ordered by my co-diners were on the tough side, and although my whole sea bass was good, it was underseasoned and bland. Everyone's french fries were soggy. The wine & the bread were good, but---this was by no means the kind of meal that was worth the wait, the price, and the high reputation. I guess Tadich is the victim of its own success, and people will keep coming no matter what the food is like, just to say they've been there, or out of habit.

Our drinks came about 10 minutes later in what had to be 4 ounce glasses. For $8 a piece, quite the robbery to begin with.  Waiter then began crossing out numerous meals from the paper menus, telling us what they were out of (please keep in mind it was before 6:30 on a Saturday night. All told he crossed off about 7 items leaving me with what looked like a used bingo card). Ordered a cesaer salad to start with which was unfortunately the best part of the meal. My wife ordered the lobster themadore which looked a lot better than it tasted. She had three bites before calling mercy. Hardly the quality of seaford we have grown accustomed to in New England.  I ordered the chicken parm style dish however was informed by Pascal \"I already told you we're out of it. Why would you order something we dont have. Do you think we keep some aside especially for you?\" I proceeded to show him his Picasso impersonation for a menu which had the chicken not crossed off. He ended up saying it wasnt his fault, they were new menus and they had moved some of the items. Fine, lets move on but an apology would have been nice. Ended up ordering the veal cutlet which was the dryest piece of gristle ever passed off as veal.  Got a $3 cup of coffee to top off the evening.

We both wanted a glass of sav blanc to compliment but Clifton insisted we try the small bottle for two of the Fume Blanc, which was a great recommendation.  He also handed over a bib for the cioppino, which I thought was hilarious until I actually got my dish.  Talk about a mound'o'seafood!  There was more meat in that thing than broth!

This place has it all, steaks, chops, fresh fish and seafood.  And keeps it simple, to the point.  Always the buzz around lunch, and just as busy and line wait after work.  Kind of place you wanna grab a nice side car, while waiting for your medium ribeye or Hangtown Fry (oyster and bacon omelet - OH MY!) to be served.  Staff, on point, takes your order, gets your food, gets you out, NEXT!  Not exactly the type of place to spend a romantic dinner, though my husband and I have found this to be one of our faves in the City.  But it did get us out on time for both of us to head back to the office.  Tip, try getting there no later than 11:30 to beat the crowd...", "author": "Jennifer V."}

My customer (guest) and I  were so offended that we chose to exit  TADICH GRILL and will never return.  We arrived at 11am for lunch.  The doors were opened at 11:05AM and the woman behind the cash register was so UNBELIEVEABLY RUDE to us when we asked a question about being seated.  She immediately called over a waiter as backup and he continued to belittle us for asking about seating.  Both my business guest and i looked at each other in shock, and decided to exit and NEVER RETURN.   Everyone has choices on where to spend their money and no one should be treated poorly by an employee at any establishment.   We chose to dine next door at Barbacco's and had both a fantastic meal and exceptional customer service.  I would think twice before subjecting yourself to paying top dollar for fish at Tadich and then being verbally abused by a Tadich Grill hostess and waiter.  Go to BARBACCO's next door.

When we got there it was pretty full, but we got our names on the list before a huge crowd was waiting.  It pays to get there early.  We got a \"booth\".  I wish more places had enclosed dining.  That adds so much to your sense of being able to talk with your companions. We all ordered drinks at the Bar.  The Bar Tenders don't have time to be chatty, its like running an Airline at that long bar. The food is very good, and I think reasonably priced considering the quality.  \nThe reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because they are so popular and so busy and so crowded that you almost feel rushed.  They really need to get you served, fed and the heck out of there because there's a line out the door.

The sea bass is great, be careful of the bones in the branzino... I prefer the chilean. There is something special about a place that serves fries with broiled lobster, it's a move that is grandfather and uncle approved... especially when washed down with a Molsen. Remember that long lost beer from Canada? It's on tap. But wait... rewind to a Basil Hayden's manhattan first. When the chron did a story on the manhattan Tadich was the benchmark.

We went around 8:30 and we only had a 5 minutes wait on a Saturday night.  You can feel the history when you walk in the door. The waiters were all men and dressed in old school uniforms. The service was good and we were treated well. I ordered the Crab and Lobster Thermidor, Potato Baked en Casserole and savored every last bite. The serving was generous so I took most of it home to eat later. It was very rich and fully of yummy goodness!! Highly recommend!", "author": "Tara P."}

Had to sit at the bar a little bit while waiting for a table, but that was a given.\n\nThe first thing I notice is the old school ambiance. Like I was guest-starring in an episode of Mad Men or something. Bring on the martinis and oysters (unless stairs are to follow)! \n\nOrdered a cup of the shrimp bisque and the hangman fry (basically omelet of oysters and bacon with side of potatoes and sliced tomatoes). The bisque was memorably good and tasty, superior to some lobster bisques I've had recently. No table seasoning needed. I have thought about making another trip to get this bisque again. The hangman fry was a little more boring and bland. Maybe I should've accepted the ketchup the waiter offered because it needed some sort of binding agent. I ended up using some tabasco instead, but still, something was missing. And the sliced tomatoes seemed random, wasn't sure how I was supposed to combine them with the rest of the dish. \n\nDespite that, I would definitely be willing to go back.", "author": "Andrew C."}

I've never been, but have always wanted to try it. The place is CROWDED at lunch, we even had to wait a bit to get seats at the counter. The crowd is mostly suits and people above 40, the ambiance was fast-paced and noisy. Very old-San Francisco feel to it. We ordered rainbow trout and crab cakes. Both very hearty and tasty meals. Also a bit heavy for lunch due to the rich tarter sauces, & you can definitely count on walking out of there feeling FULL.

I happened to be in the financial district at an art opening.  I was entertaining some friends from Switzerland who were up for something traditionally San Francisco.  We thought Tadich's was on the mark...far from it.  We walked in and the first thing I heard from the host's mouth at the register was FUCK!  He was yelling at the register for misbehaving.  When he finally acknowledged us, we were greeted with a stone faced \"How many?\"  We waited for our table for about 20 minutes.  After we were sat, our waiter arrived and said \"hello folks, the kitchen is closing so you better order right now, you might want to consider going somewhere else if you want to have a leisurly meal\"  Everything else that came out of his mouth was a sales pitch for us to leave.  And as he said all this he didn't even have the courtesy of looking us in the eye.  I was shocked, I have never been treated this poorly by a restaurant staff in San Francisco.  I bit my tongue as I did not want to make a scene in front of my international guests.\n\nThis place obviously makes a living off of over charging tourists for mediocre food.  They don't treat people well because they figure they will never see them again.  So if you are looking to show guests something that is traditionally San Francisco, do not take them to Tadich's or they will get the wrong idea about our city.\n\n\nUpdate: Weeks later my friends went by this place a second time just to make sure they did not get the wrong idea.  Though the line was long, they were treated better and told me they came out with a better impression of the place.  I upgraded my rating.", "author": "Cameron Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-16", "description": "We first discovered Tadich Grill about 10 years ago during our first time living in San Francisco and it is now a necessity for lunch or dinner whenever in the Bay Area.  It came highly recommended from family friends who had lived in the Bay Area.  We had worn out the usual San Francisco seafood restaurants (ie. Alioto's, etc.) and were looking for a change and change was what we got.\n \nThis is the oldest restaurant in San Francisco and has been around since the days of the Gold Rush.  The first thing you notice about the restaurant is that it is so non-descript that the only thing letting you know that you have arrived is the neon sign out front and the branding on the window.  As soon as you step through the door, you definitely feel like you've left the new world and traveled back to when restaurants were more than just places to get a quick bite to eat.  There is a long wooden bar that stocks innumerable bottles of liquor and there's always beer on tap...not to mention the respectable wine list.  Down the end of the bar (right by the kitchen), there are seats for either a single or couple to sit at without having to wait for a table with the rest of the crowd.  These seats are highly coveted as the bartenders are always good for a conversation.\n \nThe decor is definitely old school featuring wood everywhere and they even have the larger tables tucked away in \"private\" areas that are partitioned from the rest of the dining area. There are no reservations taken and it is a case of putting your name on the list when walking through the door.  Trust me, not even flashing of cash will get you past this step as I have seen bartenders laugh at people pulling out a few bills to grease their palms.  I've never had to wait there long for a table, with the longest probably being in the range of 45 minutes (for a group of 6).  This just serves as a chance to lean back with a cocktail and watch the crowd as you wait.  As far as the crowd is concerned, this is a real hodge-podge.  The dress code is definitely not formal but everyone is usually dressed in a casual to business casual presentation and you can expect to see a number of professionals.\n \nNow to the food.  I've never been disappointed in any seafood dish that I have ordered at Tadich Grill, and trust me I've been around to quite a few seafood restaurants in my day.  Everything is extremely fresh and cleanly presented.  The best item on the menu is far and away the Seafood Cioppino.  Over the years, the portion size seems to have gone down a bit but it is still one filling entree.  The dish is stuffed with fresh clams, fish and the occasional mussel.  Served with garlic bread, I've seen two people struggle to take down this dish before the portion size was reduced.  The seafood platter appetizer is also a must have and is plenty for either two or three people.  As mentioned, all of the other seafood on the menu is great.\n \nThe staff is always knowledgeable and willing to steer you towards some of their personal favourites.  The place can get loud and crowded, but make sure you arrive just before the usual lunch and dinner crowds and you'll be fine.  The portions are still great and the prices are what you expect to pay for quality.  Tadich Grill is a must at least once when in SF.", "author": "Trent C."}

Narrow aisles, a massive bar, patrons pushing for their respective drink orders in bovine rows, their collective body heat makes the wait almost unbearable. However, this does not detract from an experience that is worthy of its seemingly immortal name. \nFortunately for my father and I, our arrival preceded the lunch rush by mere minutes. As the throng of oh-so-chic employees of the financial district clogged the aisles, our waiter approached in a polite, yet fraternal manner.  A novice to the bar and grill, the middle aged waiter advised me to try the clam chowder before ordering the entree. The man had it pegged- The bowl of thick, hearty chowder with a welcome kick immediately climbed its way to the top of the list, (especially considering the last occasion in which chowder was consumed....**see first entry.**).\nA sad separation from the bowl of chowder, the entrees were served, and I was given a brief visitation of pescotarian heaven- The grilled petrale sole before me shone with not only a perfect texture, but a tangy charge that danced with each tastebud before its fall into a welcoming hearth.\nIt's definitely worth a second visit.\nIf you'd like to accompany me, please keep in touch.", "author": "Adam F."}

On to the cioppino, it was good but I have had  better and grumpy recomended the asparagus, would you like that overcooked and swimming in some weak hollandaise?  Meh, I think not, could we pair that with in season but tasteless?  Pour some more wine in that piddling little wine glass and oh woopsy there goes some more onto the tablecloth.  So paid the bill, still tipped that cranky old bastard more than %20 and water glasses are empty, here he comes by with the pitcher, \"May we get some more water please, Sir?\"  Looks at us like we are a dog turd and utters\"Yeah\" and proceeds to water our glasses and table like it is a garden.  So silly, we think let's go to the bar, have another glass of wine and whine about our server, think again.  Apparently they breed shitty service here, bartender pours our wine, turns his back on us, begins chatting with the other bartender and when our wine and water glasses have long been empty we finally disengage them from their very important personal conversation, pay our bill and leave the turd service grill.

Really, really good. I love any old school restaurant in San Francisco and Tadich fits the bill. The space is dominated by a big bar in the middle of the room and the sides have semi private booths and tables. In the middle of each table is a hunk of sourdough ready for you to dig in and feast which is exactly what I did as soon as I sat down. The sourdough was tangy and delicious and a wonderful start to the meal. In a restaurant like this you gotta go with the classics so I started with the shrimp and crab dinner salad and had the sand dabs as my main. Both were classically executed and totally delicious. Especially my salad which had a very generous portion of crab meat under the delicious Louis dressing. The sand dabs were delicate and delicious and came with thick cut potatoes and broccoli, green beans and carrots. I finished up with the mixed berries and zabaglione for dessert and could not have been more happy with my meal.", "author": "Cathy T."}

They don't accept reservations, so you give them your name at the front of the bar and then stand against the wall for 40 minutes or so until they call your name. OR if you're really lucky, you score a bar stool at the bar. Either way, it's San Francisco-esque at its best. When asked, the bartender recommended the cioppino for our girl's party of three. He said if we didn't get it, one would order it and then the other two would wish they had ordered it. So that's what we got. Out came three large bowls filled to the brim with a brothy tomato-based cioppino sauce and mounded with a variety of seafood from clams to shrimp to crab to scallops.....way more than we could eat. And I'm a power eater, so that's saying a lot. Excellent service. Good bread. Kind of loud but we weren't there for a romantic dinner. We were there to see if they lived up to their reputation.

I used to work in San Francisco in the 70s and 80s and loved this restaurant. It was very popular amongst locals and commuters with great atmosphere and even greater food.\nImagine my surpise Thursday night, when three of us decided to forego reservations at Fleur de Lys and go to one of my old favorite haunts. I think the waiters and bartenders there have an over inflated sense of their importance due to the long running popularity of this restaurant. We found them to be haughty, smug and totally non-friendly. I loved petrale sole and order it a lot. It is usually served with mashed potatoes, but when I asked the waiter if he would substitute roasted potatoes for mashed potatoes, he looked like I had insulted him. He told me \"no mash potatoes\". The petrale sole came with skin, fins and tail attached-the first time I had ever had it served that way.. When I complained he did not offer to get me something else from the menu, but rather stated\"that's the way we server it here\". The fish was dry and had very little sauce and when I requested more, he begrudginly brought more.\nOne of my friends, on the other had, had the grilled trout and loved it. I tasted it and it was, indeed, very good. My other friend loved the grilled King Salmon, but complained about being sick to her stomach several hours later,.\nBottom line, great atmosphere, however, the help need to get over their sense of entitlement and treat customers as they would like to be treated.

The atmosphere was festive and based on the type of socialization that was going on, I was under the impression that a lot of people there were regulars. Once I saw the food the waiters were bringing out I could see why. This place serves generous portions of classic seafood dishes, including cioppino, oysters, several kinds of fish prepared different ways, lobsters, great seafood salad.... I could go on and on about the variety in the items on the menu themselves, as well as the preparation. Unfortunately, when we visited Tadich's they were out of BOTH oysters and clams (which is why they didn't get five stars from me) but everything else we had was really good. Someone at our table ordered the crab and fish a la newberg, which turned out to be this delicious, creamy casserole of cheese, white sauce, fish and crab.

There's one guy with this really distinct voice that projects across the place that says witty things from time to time and another guy with a Scottish brogue (or maybe an Irish brogue, it should be enough that I know what a brogue is).  There's this blind guy that comes in a lot I guess (I've seen him a few times when I've been) and every time the waiter reads the menu to him, since the menu changes daily.", "author": "grant f."}

We happened to walk by.... The wait for a table was quite long, but the bartender, I think his name was Doug, made our wait quite enjoyable.  He was friendly, charming, funny, and seemed not to mind that he was extremely busy and we were only having drinks.   Some of the other customers were eating at the bar.  I have to say that the best thing about the restaurant was the bartender.  Everyone else was a little busy and distracted.  The food was very good, etc.  But what really stands out in our minds was the first experience.... Doug.  We will be back!", "author": "kathleen h."}

Not really anything to complain about at this place.  The only downside is that it is expensive but thats' kind of what I expected.", "author": "Marko C."}

There were still seats at the giant counter (didn't seem to be that many tables in the place).  The menu is huge with plenty of variety (and big San Francisco prices).  \nWe ordered a recommended calamari appetizer; a huge platter arrived that we could barely finish.  It was perfectly cooked (rings and tentacles) with bowls of red and white homemade sauces on the side.  We ordered lunches of poached Halibut (big fresh portion) and Crab Cakes (lots of crab meat and not to much bread).  Very impressive portions and quality.  We were too full to try any desserts. \nThe coffee was very good, the bread plate was good crunchy sourdough, the red wine was good, and the Service was attentive.  When we left at about 12:30, the place was packed with a line of 10 plus waiting against the wall for seats.  \nMy only complaint is the prices; we had 1 appetizer, 2 coffees, 2 glasses of wine, and 2 entrees.  With tip, the damage was $98.  \nIt's really an excellent restaurant, but I'm probably not rich enough to go there very often.", "author": "Rick P."}

They chat with you like they know you...it makes you fell welcome you fell happy about being there.  Our waiter has been working there for over 25 years, and  he knows his stuff... and was the friendlist waiter i've had in any resturaunt in the bay area.

The portions are all pretty big and the it tastes amazing.  It's a cool place to go to, and the restaurant has an older/historic feel to it.  Probably one of the better seafood places I've been too.  If you're planning on going its a good idea to head there during non-peak hours since they don't take reservations and this place is always busy.", "author": "Joe V."}

If you don't want to wait I would recommend for you to arrive before the evening rush crowed but do go! From what I observed the staff and cooks are all men. The prices are nothing out of the ordinary for an upscale seafood restaurant. I saw people dressed down and up so don't worry about wearing business causal attire. I ordered the special, crab cakes, bottle of wine, and dessert. I don't remember the names of the dishes but everything was mouth watering delicious. The restaurant is native to the city for 150 years. Go and give it a taste. Tadich is crowed for a reason!!!", "author": "Will F."}

Same older waiters in white jackets, same high ceiling and wooden booths.  There is something comforting about this place that has been in business for 161 years.  And I think I know their secret.  Great food and service.  The guy at the front might be a bit brusque but when people are pouring in at all times of day maybe he is the \"discouragement factor\".  When I asked the bartender if he knew we were there waiting for a table he said  \"It might not look like we know what we are doing but we do!\"  Touche.  As I was waiting I spotted a salad that looked delicious and pulled the waiter aside to question what it was.  No attitude he just gave me a menu and pointed it out.     Anyway if I had been in business for 161 years with great success I might have a smidgeon of an attitude too.  The prices seem to go with the portions and quality.  Yes, my Dungenesss Crab Louise was $21 but must have had 8 ounces of crab on it.  You know the fish is ultra fresh when there is a line out the door at 11:45am.  Decent well priced wine list with many good by the glass choices.  My husband's whole Bronzino was $21 as well and perfectly prepared.  Who cares if they don't give you a bread plate?  Get over it!!!  Go here to see what old time SF was all about.", "author": "June H."}

On a recent Saturday evening my wife and visited the venerable SF culinary landmark. With absolutely no wait we were seated at a small table that had a bowl of lemons, a loaf of bread, and a small plate with two pates of butter. Hmmm...I said to myself, what's up with that? Our server, who sounded like he was from France was very attentive, bringing over more butter and a round of martini's which surely hit the spot. We ordered a dozen oysters which were fantastic as was the crab cakes. These cakes were a generous handful of dungenous crab that were hand patted in a light breadcrumb batter and gently fried. These were incredible from the first bite. My wife ordered the chippino which, as others here have pointed out, was superb in every way, and I ordered the sauteed scallops which was mouthwatering. The desert was the only thing that disappointed as rice pudding pie left a lot to be desired for both of us. And the place isn't cheap either, however, the memory of paying the bill leaves you long before the memory of eating the best seafood meal that we ever had does. One more thing, upon leaving the restaurant, the valet in front asked if we needed a car. As there was a stretch Lincoln limo parked and ready to go out front, I asked him how much it would be to go to the Orpheaum Theater. $10 was his reply. What a deal as we paid $12 for a cab ride from our hotel to the restaurant earlier in the evening. Tadich Grill is a first rate old school restaurant which we'll be visiting again. (That is, when we have the dough to do so).", "author": "Nick C."}
