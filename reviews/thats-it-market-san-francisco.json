We weren't very hungry then, and had dinner reservations later, but made a mental note. \n\nRecently they made the top 15 sandwiches in the US and we had to go. Delicious!! We got the chicken one, and the chicken texture was kind of rough compared to the rest of the sandwich, but it had a good taste. I would try the beef one next time. They do have a Cubana that has both beef and chicken. It is a very large sandwich so we split one and we were both full. The salsa on top makes it perfect. It's so fun to just watch the lady make the food. She's really amazing. An artist. \n\nNote this is a total hole in the wall so if you're not into that, it's not your thing. It's right off the 24th street Bart station so very convenient.", "author": "Young B."}

I had only been to SF once when I saw it and hadn't ventured to The Mission yet.  It seemed different from the parts of The City I had visited during my one week.  I recall seeing Bourdain trek here with a local, grab a  massive Torta (Mexican Sandwich) and I believe brown bag a beer from the store.  The sandwich looked great, it seemed to have a good vibe.  Somehow, about eight years after seeing that I finally made it.\n\nThat's It is known for their Cubana Sandwich (not to be confused with a Cubano or Cuban Sandwich) - which they bill to be the Biggest Cubana Sandwich in the World.  My instinct would be that this is at least possibly correct, because this is one serious Sandwich.  For $11, I'd be hard pressed to find a Sandwich this filling.  I could have happily stopped at half and not had another bite.  (I did crust the whole thing, and I'm writing this the next morning and still feeling it - in a good way...  Hit the gym hard today.)\n\nThe Cubana:  Eggs, Ham, Hot Dogs, Avocado, Jalapenos, Sour Cream, Queso Freso, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato and your choice of Beef or Chicken Milanesa.  The Milanesa is fresh made, and if you're not familiar it is thinly slices meat that is breaded and grilled.  You can also add beans.  I listed a lot of things.  The only thing they skimp on is the lettuce.  Otherwise, you are eating LOTS of Protein.  The Cubana is so large that they cut the middle inch and a half of the roll out entirely so that their is more room for what's between the bread.  ...Wow.  If you eat the whole thing, will you leave hungry?  No.  No you will not.\n\nI liked the vibe of the whole place.  They have just a few tables and three seats at the counter.  I believe another two by the door.  They have a pretty good selection of beer, wine and liquor.  I remember seeing Bourdain drink a beer, but I don't recall if this was in the joint, or if so if it was officially sanctioned.\n\nI won't rush back to have this because it is like a Buffet in a Sandwich.  An All Inclusive Resort between Crust.  You'd do it all the time if there were no consequences.  But, Baby, there be consequences in life.", "author": "Adam S."}

The market portion of this establishment is decent, they offer all the standard convenience store staples like chips, candy, soda, and beer, but the real gem is and forever will be; the made to order sandwich counter. \n  I'm sure that everything they prepare is delicious, but I only ever come here for their Cubano sandwiches, they truly are the star of the show and are guaranteed to have your taste buds spinning in a flurry of flavors. \n  First off, they are huge, I am convinced that some sort of sorcery or black magic is responsible for the creation of this sandwich, as they manage to pack each Torta roll with a ridiculous amount of ingredients, so many in fact that two hands just aren't enough to contain this beast. They start by stacking each sandwich with every kind of meat imaginable from bacon to Chorizo and just as the height starts to peak, they top it all off with egg and fresh melted cheese.\n  Secondly, they always have fair prices, each sandwich is around $11 or so, but is more than enough food for 2 people to share or for 1 person to stretch into 2-3 meals. \n  Lastly, the chef is very friendly, she always puts all of her heart into her food, which shows through her use of fresh ingredients and the look of satisfaction she gives off as she feeds the masses.", "author": "Joseph A."}

A little corner liquor store with an apartment-style kitchen on the sidewall. But if you take a peek inside, all that need be said about this place is that the torta cubana deserves a review all it's own. A mountain of meat, egg, and mayonnaise sandwiched in between two pillow-soft bun rolls; this thing is unlike anything I've ever digested. I literally had to stand up to get the whole thing in a picture. \n\nIf you're looking for a fancy, sit down Mexican restaurant, this is definitely, definitely not the spot for you. However, if you're looking for a late night, \"I feel like making a bad decision and eating until my face hurts\" kinda place, then this is the joint for you. One of my favorite late-night San Francisco spots.\n\nCome hungry.. leave in pain. What more could you ask for..?", "author": "Jeff S."}

My boyfriend got the cubana, which in my opinion has way too many things in it, so I just got the chicken milanesa which is still stacked with a million things, but perfect.

I'm from Sacramento California and every time I go to San Francisco to watch the Giants play I always make sure I go to That's It Market. The place is a hole in the wall inside of a liquor store but the food is worth it. I have been to the restaurant probably about 20 times and the standard is always excellent. Every time I go the food is always as good or better than the time before. I also get the same thing every time. I recommend everyone try the Cubano with everything on it. The sandwich is around a couple lbs in weight and if you are not a big eater I recommend splitting one with a friend. The food is Amazing and the cooks are very nice people. So next time you are in San Francisco go visit and eat at That's it Market on Mission. *Update* still love this place!", "author": "Thomas R."}

The owners and workers are very nice and friendly.  \n\nGo to Mission Bar next door, drink some well vodka shots, and play pool until the pool sharks come along. When you're broke and can't make it to Columbus and Broadway, take 2 more well shots of vodka and go to the minivan in front of Bank of America on 23rd and Mission.  There's a guy selling hot dogs, get two with everything on it and chew on one of the raw peppers.  \n\nCome back to That's It Market and order the Torta Cubano.  By this time you're now on auto-pilot.  You're no longer making your own decisions and you're not capable thinking critically and that's ok because it takes about 10 minutes for these to be ready and it will feel like time travel.  \n\nWhen you get the torta cubano, pour a ton of hot sauce into the Torta and eat it as fast as you can.  If you come here often and build a relationship with the owners they might treat you to some dessert on a holiday.  Don't head to the back because there are gruesome mutilation magazines that might make you feel uneasy and it might kill your buzz and you don't want that if you want to finish strong.\n\nThis place also has great gifts for Christmas, child births, birthdays, and weddings behind the cashier.

Fact is, I was sitting on the couch tonight, someone on FB posted a pic of a supposedly awesome sandwich, and I immediately thought back to my visit to this market 3 years ago and specifically to this sandwich.  Anything that leaves that much of an impression must either suck balls or be completely awesome.  This was the latter. \n\nI do give credence to Mr. Bourdain's opinions on food,  so when he said go, I went the next chance I got.  And it was awesome.  Everyone knows what's on the Cubana from other reviews. Is it a lot? Yes. Is it overkill? Yes. But it is glorious overkill.  The meats,  breaded and fried. The creamy guac. The tang from the mayo. Tomato and lettuce and jalape\u00f1os to cut the meatiness. And the egg. Egg never didn't make something better.  I was done halfway through, but I could not put the damn thing down.  I finished it, and I have never been more happy to feel like crap.  And out of sheer guilt, I walked all the way back to Embarcadero, all the while in a stuporous food coma.

His checkered past, his epicurean way of life, his sardonic wit, what's not to love? The man loves meat, alcohol and a good conversation. He gets me. If he gives something his thumbs up, then I'm certainly willing to try it. \n\nThat's It Market is a small corner convenience store on Mission St. It's easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for. But of course, people on an Anthony Bourdain pilgrimage like me will find it pretty quickly. \n\nThe Torta Cubana lives up to its legendary reputation. First of all, it's massive. Hefty portions of breaded beef, sausage, chicken, pork leg, ham, and bacon hit the grill. I looked around to check if she had more than one sandwich order pending, but nope. All that sizzling goodness was for one sandwich. Aaand she wasn't finished. In went some mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, egg, jalape\u00f1o and I don't even know what else. She could've thrown in an entire garden in there, and the meat would have still been way more. \n\nThis sandwich was so big, I could barely hold half of it in my hand. Hot, meaty, messy, it's all good. With the filling in imminent danger of falling out, I ate as quickly as I could. I polished off my half of the torta before my stomach could send the white flag signal to my brain. Realization set in. Must. Unbutton. Pants. \n\nAny meat gluttony remorse? No, sir. Bourdain did not disappoint. This, the largest torta cubana in existence, was worth (half-) conquering. It had to be done.", "author": "Racquel N."}

I used to deliver Frito-Lay here and all of the mission, and a simple Pollo Milanesa is all I need or want.  The Cubana is over the top.  If over the top is what you want, \"THAT's IT\".  But I've had better flavored tortas.  \n\nBut it's pointless to eat a whole lot.  I'm not the host of man vs. food.  Eating this sandwich left me feeling a little guilty.

Luckily I already had a sandwich sampling plan in place so we split the sandwich.\n\nTorta Cubana = ham, breaded beef, hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, cheese, avocado, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, and mayo sandwiched between two lofty slices of a soft roll\n\nThe sandwich is just like it's described but it's a little astounding to watch it getting made. They kept throwing things on the grill and I wondered really is all that for my sandwich or is she making two? It's not a sandwich for everyday but good on a weekend or after a long night of drinking (I'm just theorizing now). All that meat really hits the spot. And though it sounds and looks like too much it's really very good. All the flavors come together really well. \n\nIt's the size of two normal sandwiches so I highly recommend you split it. Even after splitting it I was very full. It's not like you split it to be on a diet. It's like you split it so you can physically eat it.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the best torta in the mission but it is good.

His San Francisco adventure was no exception. Yes, I've been to the House of Prime Rib and Red's Java House. However, I was intrigued by the gigantic torta he devoured at this place. But I said to myself I would never eat it... NEVER! \n\nOn Friday evening, I was stag since Jamie W. was out of town on a work trip. I decided to stay on BART until 24th Street. Crazy, right? I can be so impetuous sometimes. Anyway, I was strolling along Mission thinking that maybe I should take a left and go to Herbivore. But lo and behold, in front of me was the market. At the crosswalk, I faced a life-altering dilemma... do I cross Mission and walk over to Herbivore, or do I cross 23rd and enter the dark unknown of That's It?\n\nWell, the sign does say \"WORLD'S LARGEST TORTAS CUBANA\", and it wasn't dark or even crowded. In fact, it's a well-kept, well-lit mini-mart with a deli counter and grill on the right. I recognized the mini-counter from the show. Oh, and there's the same woman. Her name is Alicia, and she's a sweetheart. Not a single person was eating there at 6:30PM, so I just sat on a stool. Oh wait, I forgot to get my drink from the fridge. OK, I'm ready. I asked for a Chorizo (Pork Sausage) Torta Cubana and watched her assemble it like she's probably done a few thousand times before. \n\nAlicia takes a really large, soft roll and slathers one side with sour cream and mayonnaise and covers that with shredded lettuce and tomato slices. She asks me if I want jalapenos. I tell her to bring it on. The smashed avocados come next and then she starts smashing up the sausage and grilling that up. Then Alicia asks me if I want eggs in it. I tell her again to bring it on. Somehow she manages to put in cheese and refried beans in the blink of an eye. \n\nThe two halves of the roll are lying back side down on the grill while the chorizo sizzles. Alicia miraculously scrunches all of it all together, wraps it in butcher paper and places it on a blue fiesta plate (see photo). I've never seen anything so voluminous in my life. I didn't know how to pick it up, so I started spearing it with a plastic fork. Alicia was watching my struggle and brought me a pile of napkins and a plastic knife. Of course, it was delicious with all the ingredients either oozing out or flopping onto the plate. \n\nI kept thinking I looked like Joan Collins in that episode of \"Will & Grace\" when Grace comes upon her in a fast food tacqueria with all the guacamole and sour cream all over her face. It was disgusting but strangely provocative at the same time. Perhaps I was provocative. No, I was a pig but at least a satisfied pig for $8.50 (and $2 less if you print out their Yelp page). With the can of Diet Coke, I got out of here for less than ten bucks. Oh c'mon, you know you want to try it, too. Admit it. You're as weak as I am. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...oozing and overstuffed as it is, it is pretty tasty in a gluttonous kind of way \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a lot nicer than I expected and really great when you're the only one gorging on the torta \nSERVICE - 4 stars...Alicia rocks \nTOTAL - 4 stars...I am overcoming my shame", "author": "Ed U."}

A friend and I embarked on a journey through the streets of Mission late one night to eagerly tantalize our taste buds from this infamous torta made famous by Anthony Bourdain. On this night, our tortas were expertly crafted by a woman who not once winced, to our astonished gazes, as she slathered on the piles of meat and eggs on the griddle. Once prepared and cut in half, all I could utter was, \"Damn\". I was amazed at the sheer mass of this torta and could only wonder what four digit number would equal out to if Calories were calculated. I only finished half. My friend attempted to finish it off but failed. I couldn't see anyone consuming the whole thing in one sitting. But it was very delicious. It felt like I was eating through a different country with every bite.\n\nAfter finishing just half of the Cubana, I could feel my tummy bloat and my heart rate sputter. So we decided to expel these symptoms by grabbing King Cobra tall cans from the fridge (brown bagged of course) before we headed out into the unknown. \n\nThis place offers something truly special that you must try at least once in your lifetime to understand and quell any curiosities.", "author": "Elijah A."}

Initially I was afraid it would just be one big salty meaty mess in my mouth, but my first bite put those fears to rest.  It was AMAZING.  It wasn't too salty, and the mixed flavors didn't clash at all.  You could taste each ingredient individually-- it truly was like eating and tasting a bunch of different meats at once.  I personally could have used a little more heat from the mild jalepenos, but that's just an extra the sandwich didn't need to be one of the most delicious I have ever had.  It was more than enough for two meals.  You can't beat two meals for ten bucks!  Unless of course you've got that coupon and its eight.  =)\n\nThe place is really a liquor/convenience store with a little grill and a few seats around it.

I felt the Cubano would be too much MEAT which consisted of 1 large breaded beef cutlet, pork chorizo w/ 2 eggs,  a hot dog (I kid you not), and a slice of a deli ham... slapped together in margarine grilled soft french bread and spread with mayo and sour cream, garnished with tomato, pickled jalapenos/carrots, shredded ice burg lettuce... topped with Queso fresco and an avocado. We grabbed our drinks from the fridge in the back, paid the guy at the counter, 3 sandwiches $28 (they're really big sammies) and 3 sodas = 33 bucks. A little steep for a mission lunch from what I remember, but it's San Francisco... wateves...\nI took a bite of the hubs Cubano, a little salty  for my taste buds, but my eating companions enjoyed theirs. I like my torta with just the milanesa. Soft bread and went great w/ the with same  garnishing guts ... white soft Mexican cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, tomatoes, and avocado.\nWe loved talking with Alicia, warm and extremely friendly. She said she's been extremely busy since she was featured on the show, \"muy busy\" she exclaims, wiping her forehead =D She's very grateful and appreciative of all the fans and the great business. She's even got a new lady to help her now.... they're really nice, hardworking folks. We'll see here again soon, gotta try her quesadillas!", "author": "Aga O."}

However, I didn't plan to run into this joint, it ran into me.  My buddy and I were checking out The Mission and worked up an appetite.  The light shined down and That's It appeared. \n\nMe to my friend, \"OMG, that's the place Anthony Bourdain went to with the head sized tortas, girl!\"\n\nMy friend, \"Sh*t, let's do it!\"\n\nIt was relatively early, only about noon and hardly anyone around on a sleepy President's Day Monday.  I innocently asked, \"what's the best torta?\" and the sweet lady behind the counter replied, \"The Cubana.  It is the BEST!\"\n\nFrom seeing the show I knew we should split this sandwich and jesuschrist, I was right.  Our tummies were about split after eating our half tortas.\n\nSure, the idea of bacon, hot dog, steak, egg, avocado, cheese, mayo and MORE mayo and tomato may sound abominable to some, but it was sinfully delicious and one of my favorite dining excursions in this foodie city.  Probably because it was so down home.  The green salsa on the side was delicious.  You don't think you need it, but you do.  \n\nMy friend commented that she wanted to fold the little lady behind the counter and put her in her pocket because she was so cute and nice.  She really took care of us and you can tell that she knows everyone in the neighborhood as different folks came and went, sitting at the counter and talking to her in turn.\n\nWhat was interesting is that the cashier man on the other side of the store was a distinguished older Middle Eastern man.  I think that's what is really awesome about San Fran is how cultures mix here like it ain't no thing.  He was a real character for sure and I'm not sure what conspiracy theory he was trying to relay to me about the credit card people, but whatever.

These \"man-fests\" have ranged from going suit shopping, to climbing tall mountains and bellowing affirmations of my awesomeness to pesants in the vales below. This year, I decided to eat something ridiculously large, the Torta Cubana at \"That's It Market\", made famous by the most manly of Television personalities, Anthony Bourdain.\n\nThis sandwich would be remarkable for the wide variety of meats it includes: Breaded Steak, Chicken, Ham, Bacon, Hot Dogs, Chorizo and Eggs. However, not being a sandwich for mere mortals, the Cubana also includes a maddening combination of Jalapenos, Refried Beans, Mayo, Lettuce, and Cheese within its ludicrously proportioned eight-inch girth.\n\nJesus Christ, I got a post-traumatic case of the meat sweats along with some heart palpitations from even listing that ungodly combination of ingredients. Talk about things I couldn't eat if I were in a relationship...\n\nHowever, sandwiches like this are not truly complete without a bitchin sauce to round out the flavor. In this case, the sauce came in the form of Thats It's face-scorchingly spicy red salsa--enhanced with a touch of citrus, fresno chile and some delightfully chunky onion- and rich and smokey chipolte sauce, chocolate in color and reminiscent of the finer mole sauces I've eaten in my life. While the lady at the counter clearly thought I was crazy simply by virtue of my request for \"as many Jalapenos as you can fit on this thing\", and for going at this sandwich alone, my request for the \"spiciest salsa you can wrangle up\" was apparently noteworthy enough for all of her co-workers to leave their posts and come watch the white boy erupt into flames. While the crowd slowly mulled around me, I dug in.\n\nHow was the sandwich itself? Well, without the salsa, it was sort of a mess. And by a mess, I mean it got all over my (formerly white) shirt, my hands, my beard and my mustache. Without the salsa, the flavors were kind of a mess too, one bite would be chorizo and bacon (which I would have liked a little more of) the next hot dog and processed ham (whichI certainly could have used far less of). But, when anchored by the slick, lava-like burn of the salsas, what resulted was an unusualy textured (the toasted french loaf contrasting with the beans, breaded steak and eggs was especially nice), salty, and undeniably bitchin' meal, which, for a mere ten dollars was enough to feed a small family in a war-torn country...or at least giant enough to help repair the ego and self-image of a Graduate Student on his least favorite holiday. That, and the fact that I finished eating with an audience watching made it a worthy feat to crown my otherwise inglorious Valentine's Day an immortal testamant to my manliness.", "author": "Casey U."}

I said mas!), hot dogs and finally sprinkles the top with tongue numbing hot sauce.  It's so big that 2 sheets of butcher paper can't even stretch its way around the girth.   I mean, why not throw in some SPAM, a quarter cup of corned beef and some Vienna sausages while you're at it?  \n\nNeverminding claims, it's taken me about a week to develop a posture about this \"Tony Bourdain\" special much less digest it, and I've decided (despite having figured out what initially possessed me to put it in my mouth) that after having picked out the horrific rubbery dogs, ham and hot sauce, it wasn't half bad (tasting).  It's salty, creamy, crispy, squishy, hot and cool all in one to two mortifying bites.  It's the kind of thing you split casually among friends or foes and never set back down on your plate unless you're ready to put that fork to use.  But can you really say you appreciate something when you have to deconstruct the original, not enjoying something in the way the creator intended?", "author": "Irene S."}

I really wanted to love it but, sadly, I was left disappointed. Yes, the tortas are huge--bigger than most people's faces but the variety of meats hardly have any flavor at all. To me, it's just a sandwich that has the capacity to raise my cholesterol level by about 30 points in one sitting but, really, I'd rather save it for something more worth while for my tastebuds. Also, unlike what you may have seen on Bourdain's show, you CANNOT grab a beer and drink it with your meal. Ultimately, THAT'S IT is just yet another over-hyped hipster joint that is good, but not GREAT. Personally, I think it's way over-priced at $10 a pop for the quality and variety of meat.", "author": "Brian M."}

I tried to layer the torta with the cheezy napkins, but it was failed effort, that didn't work.. my dress shirt was pretty much soiled in chorizo and Avocado.\n\nbuy that shiet was soo freaking good!\n\n- 1 star for the cheezy napkins.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-09", "description": "Okay.  This review is, like so many others, centered on the Torta Cubana.  So maybe I'm one of the last fat-asses in the city to try the notorious Mexican staple from That's It Market, a commmmmbination liquor store and deli serving tortas, tacos, tostadas and, inexplicably, falafels, but I don't care. Because I will tell you the truth about this mystical Torta Cubana: IT'S NOT AS BIG AS EVERYONE SAYS.\n\nLet me quickly qualify that statement. The Torta Cubana is objectively big. For a normal person, it's a large sandwich in both girth and height, comprised of strategic layers of breaded beef, ham, chorizo, hot dogs (YES, hot dogs), bacon, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole and mayo on a huge, almost painfully soft piece of bread and is probably too much to finish in one sitting. But for someone who a) has been drinking at The Monk's Kettle prior to eating dinner, then polishes off two Sparks (caffeine-free, BOO), or b) gets morbidly excited over such heart-cloggers as carne asada fries, this sandwich is gonna be the perfect size.\n\nMuch of the Torta Cubana's popularity is due to its recent feature on \"Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations,\" the Travel Channel show where Tony goes around to different cities trying different food, making snarky remarks, and keeping me really pondering the answer to the question, \"Would I hook up with that?\" But I am into the idea of the Torta Cubana because for what you get, it's pretty cheap. I'm talking $10 for a sandwich you can't even fit your mouth around. But since most of you are gonna share this baby, that's like $5 each for a good, honest meal -- definitely puts the footlong from Subway to shame.\n\nNow, a note about taste. Like most food that looks gross, it's somewhere in between \"Oh-my-God-now-I-can-die-happy\" and \"Oh-my-God-what-did-I-just-stick-in-my-mouth.\" Which is to say it tastes exactly how it looks: okay. And to that, I say God bless America.\n\nOn another note, my friend swears by the carne asada tacos here.  Apparently they're really inexpensive and girthy.  Next time.", "author": "Christy J."}

My friend and I got sodas, so I didn't ask.\n\nWe got the Torta Cubana. WOW - everything that's good and right and proper about yummy dive chow is here. Greasy? Only a little. Chock full of meaty, salty goodness? Oh HECK yea!!  \n\nIf you go expecting any ambiance beyond that of a 24th -n- Mission St. liquor store - you'll be sorely disappointed. If you want what God eats when he has a hangover - it's the place for you.\n\nGot me to thinkin' (oh shnaps!!):  What makes a dive good?\n\nThat's It is a DIVE, but the food is SO good, it overcomes the location and the creepy guys checkin' out porn on the magazine rack. \n\nGo to Red's Java House, and it's a different combination of factors that make it good: It's divey, the food's just good, but the location under the Bay Bridge is fantastic.\n\nAnyone remember Sam Wu's? Small, cramped, nothing good about the location, food good, but Edsel (RIP) the Cleaver-Wielding cook made it all worth while.\n\nSo, when does location or quirkiness overcome an average meal to make a dive really worthwhile?

It has the following: breaded steak, chorizo, hot dog, bacon, ham, egg, cheese, sour cream, mayo, avocado, jalapenos, and tomatoes.  This is pretty much what I would think is every breakfast item on the menu stuffed in a sandwich which pretty much makes this the greatest hangover food of all time.  And while it's surprisingly not greasy, this torta has a billion calories, so be sure to walk the hills of San Francisco after you finish eating it.. if you can eat the entire thing.\n\nSo it's easy to find being that it's a corner liquor market.  It's like any deli market except it has a cooking station.  The lady who made my Cubana looked like she really enjoys making them, especially when it's obvious I only heard of it through the TV show.  You can also get bottled sugary Coke here.\n\nThe Cubana is excellent though next time I'm going to ask for more jalapenos.  You can eat at the counter there, but if you plan on eating there, go when it's warm since the doors are wide open.  Highly recommend.\n\nseems to have a high turnover of sandwich ingredients to stay fresh\nservice is ok, takes 5 minutes to make a sandwich\nparking - can get lucky finding an open spot, metered", "author": "John D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-29", "description": "There comes a time, in many relationships, when things escalate to a place where no one really wanted to see them go.  And when that happens, you need to take a step back, take some deep breaths, and allow reason and logic back into the equation.  We've all been there.\n\nFor example, remember the time when you and your buddies were out cruising around in your Jeep Wrangler, listening to tunes and shooting the breeze, and then the driver suggested going to a party at the house of some guy you didn't know?  Sounded a bit odd, but you all went along with it.  Then, when the host of the party wouldn't let you in, you tried to bum rush the door, and got denied?  Again, this is beyond what you were expecting, but still within the realm of reason.  Then, the three of you went back to the Jeep, and the driver started pulling out baseball bats and tire irons so you could fight your way in the door?  You were still kinda cool with that idea, but things had definitely taken a strange turn.  But then, the driver pulled out a can of gasoline and proceeded to slosh it on the wall of the house, so he could set it on fire and smoke the party-goers out?  If you remember these things, then you are either Paul Anthony, B-Fine, or Bowlegged Lou, and I really appreciated your performance in the movie House Party.  I am honored you read my reviews.  And I know you get what I'm saying: sometimes things just escalate beyond control, and you need to rein it back in before the cops take you down to the docks and beat you up.\n\nSame thing with the sandwiches here.  There was a time, some time ago, when the average size of the Cubano started topping 2 pounds, and that was the time when someone should have said \"do we REALLY need a sandwich that weighs more than any of the Gossling children?\"  Every Cubano sandwich here should come with two sides: 8 more slices of bread, and a friend to help you eat the thing.\n\nThe practical-joke size of the sandwich aside, it's actually quite good.  I recommend it the next time your soccer team needs to split a sandwich.", "author": "Ben P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-02", "description": "My friend Jung invited me out here recently for tortas after having seen That's It featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. I had noticed That's It and it's odd name, but had no idea they served food. A woman named Alicia rents a grill in the corner of the store, with a counter that seats 5 or 6. You order at the counter, pay at the register. That's It also has an assortment of pre-made middle-eastern food, as well as several aisles devoted to booze and porn. Sadly, you aren't allowed to drink beer at the counter. I'm didn't ask if you're allowed to read porn at the counter.  In any case, my review pertains only to Alicia's food.\n \nI didn't quite know what I was getting myself into, but I followed Jung's lead and ordered the cubana- a beast of a sandwich stacked with beef milanesa, egg scrambled with chorizo, ham, bacon, and sliced hot dog, and finished with queso blanco, avocado, jalapenos, sour cream, and mayonnaise, for $10. Kind of a stunt sandwich but it tasted, and held its shape, much better than I would have thought. Everything is grilled to order, and it is quite a show watching the cubana take shape. The lightly breaded beef was my favorite component, and the chorizo and japaleno gave the torta  a lot of smoky flavor. Frankly, the hot dog, ham, and bacon were a bit unnecessary. The bacon was also a little undercooked for my taste, not crispy but kind of flaccid and chewy. The cubana is  easily enough food for two people- I saved half of mine and had a good-sized lunch the next day. Probably not something I would order again but I would definitely go back to That's It . Alicia was a very cheerful, welcoming hostess, and clearly appreciates the attention and business that Bourdain's endorsement has brought her. It was a pleasure to watch her work and chit-chat with her, and I look forward to exploring the rest of her menu, which features tostadas and quesadillas.", "author": "Brian H."}

Cornerstore run by Ali and Hassan. Nice guys.\n2. Griddle, fryer, bar top with 5 chairs run by Alicia our favorite Mexican mother. So nice. Food's delicious. 12pm-9pm\n3. Middle-eastern food after 9 pm from the same corner of the store that Alicia works out of from Sammie. \n\n\"No Reservations\" dined with Alicia. I am an avid follower of the show, and of Alicia. As I feel that her food is truly delicious (not what one would expect from the corner of the cornerstore) I was very excited to hear that she'd be on the episode. My only qualm is that they ordered the most ridiculous thing on the menu. I'm sure it was good, but the Cubana (everything on one sandwich) is a bit of a novelty - especially with the hot dog included. I was hoping they would try some other options as well. The tortas are fantastic - crumbly bread, crema, avocado and all. I recommend the chicken milanese - breaded chicken cutlet. The tacos are baja-style, small, crispy and delicious, with meat onions cilantro, salsa. The quesadillas are TO-DIE-FOR. The tortillas are made to order, rolled and pressed in front of you. You can order them \"a la plancha\" (on the griddle) or fried. The fried are my favorite, crunchy, textural, and full of flavor. \"A la plancha\" is good too, but fried is the way to go. The carne asada and pollo are my favs. I've heard good things about the zucchini flower/loroco too. You know it's a good sign when the guys from the taquerias come down to get food from her.\n\nCongrats Alicia - You may need a bigger counter top soon.", "author": "Michael M."}

The first time I had it a few months ago it was so delicious it left me craving for it for months.  Of course I had to come back but now I was so disappointed I ended up throwing more than half of it in the trash. The difference? Lack of flavor and possibly love. Why? Different cooks. The first time I had it a very nice rounded lady with light skin prepared it.  She's the one you probably seen on Bourdains show.  Last night a thinner dark skin lady prepared it.", "author": "Tony Y."}

His face is rather large so you can pretty much guarantee a full meal. I, however, feel that the tortas lack taste. It's plain, it's big, it leaves no satisfying after thought. If you're looking for something big to stuff your face, it's a good option but if you're rather persnickety about where your calories are coming from, I'd pass.", "author": "Camille T."}

You literally might gain 2-3 lbs after eating this gem.  Which by the way is delicious and satisfying and definetly can be all eaten in one sitting if you not a huge wussy.  Anyway I liked the place, except that you cant drink alcohol there while eating the torta, which is crap.", "author": "christopher h."}

I ate on my way out, and went straight for the heart-stopping cubana. it was buttery, heavy, meaty, way salty, fatty and i loved greasy, last bite. all that was left was a piece of hot dog. it fell on the plate on my last bite, and i was in no condition to be reach down and relcaim it i can't help but think that my heart actually thanked me for the beating i gave it, if not only for this one time. and as far as the rating goes it came to my attention that they had exactly what you needed with a sandwich like that, but yet were not allowed to drink there, and thats a way cold beer.\nand the correct ingredients (because i wrote them down in my ipod as it was being made) are:\nbeef\nham &amp; bacon (yes both!!!)\nhot dog \nchorizo con huevos\ncottage cheese NOT head cheese (which is actually jellied pork or beef )\nmayonaise\njalepenos (pickled and glorious)\navocado\ntomato\nlettuce \nsour cream\nand the kitchen sink", "author": "Ryan L."}

Expect to wait a few minutes for your food because they make everything fresh.  \n\nWe sat at the counter in this grocery store/deli and asked the Spanish speakers sitting next to us for suggestions.  They suggested the pumpkin flower quesadilla, fried.  We sat and watched and they downed 2 of these, but we opted for the grilled version of the same. Its a handmade corn tortilla with yummy fillings then topped with mexican sour cream, fresh cheese and lettuce.  \n\nDelicious and authentic.\n\nWe actually went for the torta cubana but changed our minds when we saw these people eating the quesadilla   We saw a torta cubana cooking and it made us want to come back.\n\nGo when you aren't in a rush.

Many, many years ago, in the 50's - 70's and even earlier, Mission Street was a great shopping street called \"The Mission Miracle Mile\".  There was a Woolworths  with a lunch-counter and a pet dept.,  there was a Newberrys  department store w/a lunch-counter, Kresses with a lunch-counter.  As you can see lunch-counters in a dept. store impresses me.  There was a HUGE Sears on Army and Mission St and many other shoe and clothing stores in-between.  i think the mile was from Army st to 16th st.  .There were even 2 Doggie Diners, one on Army & Mission and one on 18th & Mission st where you could get a Milkshake so thick you could hardly suck it through the straw.
