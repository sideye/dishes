That being said, I ordered sullungtang and was pretty disappointed at how lukewarm it was. I wanted hot soup not lukewarm/cold. The menu is really extensive though so I will try this place out a couple more times since they have some korean food not sold by alot of places. I really want to try their jambbong and some of the fish soups/stews next time. The jajangmyun or black bean noodles were good- not excellent but not bad.", "author": "Emily P."}

Not much of a street eater no more...lolz, kidding.\nMy bestie and I were looking for a nice and cozy place to celebrate our Christmas. Unfortunately, unlike last year, this year was so crowded. Lines of people were everywhere. We went to Tenderloin and even there was the same situation. Accidentally, we walked pass DB. I heard good things about this but always hesitated to go on in bcoz many of my Korean friends said the food is only mediocre but quite pricey. There was no option thus, we were starving. We walked in. The ambience was good. There wasn't a crowd. Yay! The seat was comfy. Staff were extremely friendly. \n\nFood came out fast and the portion was huge (for us girls). We was so hungry so forgot to take many photos. Only captured one. We ordered military soup, add seafood (end up with 4 bowls of rice coz it was so good); ramen; kimchi pancake. Many side dishes. I think the price might be considered pricey as the small size is approx $14 and the large is $24 and over. However, the portion is good. We were stuff and couldn't barely walk...\nTaste wise, it isn't as tasty as Aria (my fav pop and mom place) but to compare, I like this better than COcoBang or 707 Sutter and the price isn't much different to Sutter place. If you go by yourself, perhaps it is, but to go with a friend, I'd highly recommend this restaurant. Plus, it is very clean!!!\nWould definitely come back for my birthday, I want seaweed soup and Chicken soup with sticky rice!!!", "author": "Bao V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-30", "description": "I am appalled at the negative reviews here.  This place is fantastic for so many reasons.\n\n1) The food is great here.  It's not the best Korean you will ever have but it is solid and authentic.  It's also not Korean BBQ, it's Korean cuisine.  I hate to break it to those who don't realize but Korean cuisine is not just barbecuing your own meat and making your clothes and hair smell like smoke and sweat.  There is a lot more to it and this restaurant's very big and comprehensive menu is representative of that.\n\n2) It is frequented by a large Korean customer base, many of those I've spoken to maintain that the food is authentic.\n\n3) The decor and atmosphere is legit. Those wanting high ceilings, parquet wood flooring, faux-antique pendant lights and subway tiles have no place in a real Korean restaurant.  The mismatched chairs, the overly-ornate wood dividing walls, the lucky talismans and charms hanging on the walls, the soju and beer posters/calendars with pictures of ladies in bikinis, the tvs  playing Korean news channels, the unflattering bright lighting....these are all nostalgic things which make up an authentic Korean family restaurant experience.  Especially at a Korean restaurant, having large plastic cups, water jugs, bottles of beer & soju and drinking glasses, various dishes, eating and serving plates, all on large tables which are still too small that you have no idea where everything is going to go makes this atmosphere authentic. I REALLY cannot express enough how much atmosphere makes an Asian restaurant authentic or full of crap.\n\n4) The owners/servers here are the perfect blend of sweet, in your face, friendly and impatient.  The aunties and uncles working in places like this don't have time for western formalities.  It's all about the attitude.  Best chance you have is to be as equally and amicably as forward as they are, or to be ultra humble and extra smiley.  I really cannot stress enough how one should not be overly demanding or expect red carpet service at places like this.  It won't work in your favor.\n\nWe ordered the Kimchijeon (kim chi pancake), steamed mandu (dumplings), Nak Ji Jun Gol (octopus in a spicy sauce), Kal Bi (of course), Jap Chae (of course), Sam Gae Tang (ginseng chicken \"soup\").  They were all great great great.  The Ginseng Chicken was on the bland side but as this type of dish is often eaten for medicinal purposes, that was not surprising.  We did not order the Kimchijigae as we normally do but will try it next time since....WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!\n\nLove love love this place!", "author": "Adrian C."}

No, we were hoping lightning would strike again with a Korean place we haven't tried before. After all, Dame Fortune smiled upon us not once but twice in the Temescal area of Oakland with Sahn Maru and Casserole House. However, she wasn't in as good a mood this time as she merely smirked and belched at Dong Baek. We liked it OK but then again, we ain't that picky when we're starving and shaking in our boots in the 'Loin after dark.\n\nIt wasn't crowded when we entered the modest place. A Korean soap opera was playing on two big-screen TVs, something culturally enriching about a young girl who discovers she's pregnant when another boy is getting ready to pop the question. The slut. Anyway, Dong Baek wins our award for most banchan plates - 14 (see photo). That was all fine, but what Jamie was jonesing for was the Dol Sot Bibim Bab sizzling in a stone pot. He also wanted kimchi, so it only made sense for him to order the $12.50 Kim Chee Dol Sot Bi Bim Bab (see photo). Unfortunately, we didn't notice the fine detail in the description which didn't include any beef, and so he was disappointed his protein wasn't present.\n\nWhat made matters worse was that he also ordered the $10.95 Kim Chee Fried Rice, which with the fried egg on top, was almost identical to the bibimbop he ordered (see photo). It was like a double order of kimchi fried rice. Not that we were complaining because we like kimchi, but I could have gone for more variety. Now what I ordered, Jamie couldn't really stomach. It was the $17.95 platter of Pork Feet, boiled and sliced thinly with a marinade that I liked (see photo). He thought it was too gelatinous, but I rather like the consistency of this little piggy and had no problem devouring most of it by myself. Now this little piggy (moi!) didn't go \"wee wee wee\" all the way home. We just shrugged our pairs of respective shoulders and concluded there is better Korean food to be found in Oakland.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...relatively decent Korean, just nothing all that outstanding except those pig's feet, an acquired taste, I know\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...well-kept with a side area for louder patrons, I assume\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...they were running around like they were on fire...maybe that's part of the Tenderloin mindset\nTOTAL - 3 stars...good Korean, just not that great", "author": "Ed U."}

We came here for a work lunch and the four of us shared a large portion of seafood pancakes, small portion of army soup casserole, an order of zhajiangmian and an order of fried tofu. We didn't quite finish all the food (a straggling piece of pancake left) and left well satisfied.\n\nI think the seafood pancake is a must order. It's not too soggy like some other places (where it's a bit undercooked) nor does it taste greasy. The rice flour batter is nicely crispy on the edges and tender and chewy in the middle.\n\nWe also really liked the zhajiangmian. It's not too salty and had real pieces of pork in there, not that we cared much because the noodles were so delicious. It was al dente and we splurped it up.\n\nThe army soup had a good amount of spam and hot dog slices in there and nicely spiced. With the pancake and zhajiangmian hogging most of my attention, I didn't have too much of it, but what I had was great. Wish they put in another packet of ramen noodles in there, too!\n\nThe tofu was bathed in a sweet and sour sauce and had a nice crunch. A nice change of pace.\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed the food and the price tag was very affordable. Of course we didn't order any of the more expensive BBQ'ed meats, but we were plenty happy with our carb fest. What can I say, we're just a few peasants at heart that are well satisfied with noodles and spam :).", "author": "Alice W."}

While Dong Baek loses points on both those criteria, it nonetheless holds a special place in my food gland for fighting the good fight for Korean food in the Tenderloin.\n\nNow, I know that the loin is gentrifying, but when you walk past some of the dealers and homeless folks right outside, you'd be surprised the customer base at Dong Baek stays so strong. Many times that I've eaten here, I'm the only non-Korean, or if there's another outsider, we get to give each other the panicked nod.\n\nLots of homestyle Korean dishes to be had here, and just one look at the casserole list and you'll understand. This is comfort food, something Mom whips up on Saturday nights when all you have in the fridge is kimchi, hot links, and you're down to bags of ramen. That's where cham pong comes in, and I have a hard time not ordering it each time. Big smokin' bowl of noodles in a spicy red greasy broth, with chunks of squid, oysters, and more onions than your hot date is comfortable macking with. It's a comforting dish that really fills you up on a foggy San Franciscan night, which is perfect since Dong Baek closes late.\n\nThe panchan are well-done, but nothing stands out, and they never have fish cake.", "author": "Kevin L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-24", "description": "The menu tantalizes with much variety. Separate sections for noodles, fish, soups, house specials, etc.; 5 kinds of bibimbap; 8 kinds of -jeon, including 4 that aren't pancakes; Korean-Chinese dishes; lunch specials; prix fixe selections for groups of up to eight people; and even more (no desserts, though) await you within the pages of this menu.\n\nYet, I'm not sure how many of those pages I'm still anxious to explore. On prior visits I had bibimnaengmyeon, and I might've had bibimbap. The most recent dish I had here put a distance between my expectations / hopes and my taste buds. Maybe I can say it this way: if this restaurant's jjajangmyeon and I were girlfriend and boyfriend, we'd just about be at one of those \"It's not you, it's me.\" scenarios, followed by mutual time off from the relationship. I furthermore don't see long-term potential with this dish and me.\n\nThe other Black Day when I ate jjajangmyeon at someone's house, it was thickly sauced and savory. When I ate it at Kukje it was craveworthy; I specifically had it in my mind as I rated KMTR 4 stars. Imagine the house and Kukje jjajangmyeon as seeing your favorite band live - the sounds, the lights, the crowd, the excitement. Then leave the scene and step into an elevator with the muzak version that is this restaurant's jjajangmyeon. I'm not trying to dis. All I'm saying is (and here it is, finally) what's up with the watery jjajang and, most of all, the sweetness? It's like someone took the dish I wanted and threw some spoonfuls of sugar on top while watching \"Mary Poppins\" in the kitchen. Maybe some people like it this way. Sugary. Watery. Not I.\n\nI liked the noodles though, as well as the serving method of the jjajang and the noodles being in separate bowls. But really, it's like keep that stuff away from my noodles. But I'm not hatin'.\n\nAmong our banchan was a more or less cubed potato that tasted like a sweet version of McDonald's fries. You know how some people put fries into their milkshake? Take one back out and eat it. Chew it slowly. Being that but much thicker was what this banchan approached.\n\nAfter having some \"barely there\" kimchijeon in Oakland restaurants and on our last visit to Arang, returning to the chewy, springy variety was like going on un-vacation. I think I got hooked on the fall-apart, somewhat (and I use that word with as much emphasis as it can carry) crisp renditions.\n\nAn unexpected highlight of our meal was saeujeot (super salty fermented tiny shrimp), which I regard as Korean bagook. We'd never before been served it because, as we were told by our patient and friendly server, it's almost exclusively used in making kimchi rather than standing alone as a condiment. I of course tasted a little bit by itself - yow! I also spread it on stuff like the kimchijeon. Don't be surprised if I start asking for this at restaurants, especially if I find myself with a roguishly sweet dish that needs thwarting.", "author": "Dan B."}

The owner allowed me in with my service dog one day and welcomed me to return because my dog was so well behaved. I've lived in Korea and I know that many Koreans don't like dogs and even eat them. I hate that stereotype but sometimes stereotypes have a modicum of truth to them.

He told me I wasn't permitted in to pay my bill. I had to stand at the entrance and when I explained that they weren't permitted to deny me service because of ADA law, he acted dumb and said they couldn't control peoples allergies. Don't lie to me. That's not why you don't want me in your business; you just don't like dogs and don't want to accommodate the disabled because of your social judgment against the disabled (poor) people in your neighborhood. I showed your waiter my dog's service license, registered with the city and state. I gave him a card that had ADA law on it and he didn't even look at it. He handed it back to me and refused to let me walk to the register to pay for my food. No tip for you, buddy.\n\nIf you can't treat me like any other customer, I won't ever come back and that upsets me because I liked your restaurant and until now, never had a problem. Now I'm very angry. I'm going to put a sincere effort into letting my large social networks know about my bad experience with your staff.

But of course, be aware of your surroundings. \n\nRestaurant ambiance: The restaurant was nicely decorated with plenty of open space. You can tell it was previously a bar, which is now no longer in use by the restaurant. My sister and I unfortunately were seated a weird fence divider and was hard to get their attention. Otherwise the noise level was a bit loud. Not too stuffy from all the steamy foods. \n\nWhat we ordered: ($11.95) Small seafood pancake. Came out cut in about standard sized12 pieces, so yes it was huge portions. We also ordered spicy pork ($20.95). Meat was tender, spicy, and juicy without being too greasy. We also ordered Spicy black bean noodles ($12.95). It was HUGE. My sister and I scooped some onto our bowls, and as with any korean meal, you fill up quickly thanks for the banchan they provide too. I looked back at the end of the meal, and it looked like we didn't even touch the noodles.  It was too much and lasted me for two more meals after!", "author": "Connie C."}

Even though the food is pretty pricy, what do you expect out of a restaurant approaching downtown SF? It's in a super sketchy and dirty Tenderloin district but don't let that discourage you. The portions are pretty hefty which means good leftovers for tomorrow! The bbq is probably some of the best I tried in the city so far. It's not the cook it yourself on the table type. They cook it for you in the kitchen which is fine because you can lay back and enjoy your food and avoid the super smoky room. Their other dishes are super bomb as well. The jajangmyun (black bean noodles), kampoogki (sweet wet fried chicken), dukgook (rice cake soup), boodaegeegae (spicy stew) are just among some favorites I get here. The banchan (side dishes) are the best! I was told that all of the banchan is made fresh every single day and it definitely shows. The kimchee is sooooo good! Best I ever had. The variety and amount they give you is amazing.\nThe service has always been good when I came but I could understand that it can get hectic when it's busy due to the number of people on staff. The owner is my favorite. She's always very nice and diligent when she has served me, but she is retiring which is super sad. Definitely going to miss her. But the rest of the staff are very friendly as well. Some of them, the English might be a little scarce but it's not too shabby. \nFor those that come on a late night, I believe they're open everyday until 11PM. Pretty decent selection of beer & wine. American and Korean ones. And who doesn't love Soju? They got that there too!\nThis place is definitely worth checking out, I've never left disappointed. Just be prepared that parking is a bitch. Super hard to find around that area and be mindful of the street cleaning signs and stuff. \n\nPS. They don't deliver but you can find a delivery app that will deliver food to you!", "author": "Andrea M."}

Our food came out in a timely manner, and banchans were refilled without attitude by our hard working server.  I think he was the only one there.  There were also a good number of Korean groups there, so I tried to see what they were having.  I think it was the champong.  It's not a Chinese restaurant, but they also had jajangmyun, and kampong shrimp.  They had a very large menu, in general.  \nThere were 4 of us, so we got the set menu for 3, which came with an egg drop like soup (again, kind of Chinese), galbi, seafood pajun and kampong shrimp.  We added the spicy squid dish, which was my favorite of the bunch.  I didn't try the pajun but it was large. The kampong shrimp, galbi, and spicy squid were good, but on the sweet side for my taste.  I got the dak gui for Tintin to go, and that was cooked well, without being sweet.  \n\nI can get home cooked Korean food whenever I want, so I don't need to go out for it, but Korean Chinese food is another story.

Delicious. Spicy. Make sure to specify that you want the Korean style though, because I believe they also have a plain version which is not as good.\n\nShort-ribs. They come to the table sizzling on a bed of onions. They're extremely tasty.\n\nCasserole. The one you want is called Boo Dae Chi Gae (sp?). This is like spicy ramen with lots of yummy stuff thrown in. IMO this is seriously the best dish on the menu.\n\nBlack bean noodles. If you're not familiar with black bean noodles, head over to Netflix right now and watch \"Castaway on the Moon\". Go ahead, I'll wait.\n\nOkay, now that you understand the wonders of black bean noodles, you're ready to have some.

This style originated with Chinese chefs establishing restaurants in Korea, and dishes were adapted to Korean tastes. In my opinion, the Korean fried chicken that seems all the rage these days is actually a version of Najo-gi or gampoong-gi. The best place for this style of food is no longer in existence as the owners retired and I have searched for several years for someone to step in to this niche.\n\nAt last, this may be it! The black bean noodles and \"fried chicken\" are nearly spot on. I think there are better places for bulgogi and tofu stew as I found the bulgogi stringy and the stew lacking in daen-jang flavor.

There were shrimp (two peeled, butterflied w/ tail on), mussels (2 shelled on), squid and sea cucumber (this is a very nice surprise because hubby really likes it and I had a failed attempt trying to make it once).  The noodle was firm and chewy and the soup was good with a nice garlicky flavor.  The spicy squid and somen were both good - mixing them together was a perfect combination.

We were seated quickly and given menus promptly. However, it took them forever to give us the water. Because it look like the place was getting busy, we took advantage of them at our table handing out waters by ordering right then and there. We had three dishes: fried chicken wings, cha cha noodles, and tofu stew. \n\nAfter that the servers totally forgot about us. They did not bring us the free appetizers. They kept ignoring our tables and running back and forth for the other tables. I had to ask for the free toppings. That took a while to come too. Once the toppings came the food came right after that. Then, the servers left us alone for the rest of the night. They did not refill the water even though ours were empty due to the extreme spiciness of the tofu stew. I asked the waiter to refill the toppings. He took the empty trays away, but never came back with them. He walked passed our table several times and ensured that other tables were served promptly menus, water, and toppings.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we had empty glass bottles and non-replenished toppings. Also they even forgot our beer, which is often the first thing to be given at a meal. However, I do notice that other tables were served much better than us. They were given their beer immediately after being served. Also, we had to ask for boxes to go twice to two different servers until it was brought to us. I don't know if it is the location of the table, which is easily forgotten or what. Overall, the service is absolutely unsatisfying. \n\nHow's the quality of the food? It was just ok. The tofu stew was good but too spicy. The fried chicken was over FRIED, thus the texture was hard. There wasn't much flavor on the chicken because they didn't toss the chicken with the sauce. It was more like dumping the over chicken onto some honey sauce and serve.  I have no comment on the CHA CHA noodles since I didn't eat it. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this pricey bad service and ok food restaurant.", "author": "Lily K."}

Don't get me wrong, the bar food experience is fine by me, but if you want both, you can find it at Dong Baek. Nestled in what's probably earlobe of the Tenderloin, it might be easy to skip past this place as you're hopping over a rogue turd, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice by doing so (by all means, don't take that as an endorsement for stinky waffle making). \n\nIt seems to have changed hands a number of times. I could be wrong there. But at this point, the food is great and the service is friendly. Some of the edible highlights include some properly juicy kalbi, ja jang myun made with house-made noodles, and meat jun (one of the few places I've ever found this), and woah buddy... ban chan. \n\nThe space is large and has sections mean to accommodate sizable groups and sometimes, there'll be a busload of Koreans in here. At least they get that endorsement. That in and of itself carries its own inconvenience for locals, but whatever. Good for these guys. The downside to that, however, is that it seems difficult to staff for such a large restaurant. The service is still friendly, but on busy nights, can be a little scattered. \n\nOtherwise, though, it's a nice place to put down some eats, have a Cass, and let the K-pop roll, and think about how awesome it'd be if people stopped using car alarms on main bus routes.", "author": "Roy M."}

We stumbled upon this Korean restaurant and decided to give it a try. We ordered the tofu soup and spicy black bean noodles with seafood. \n\nTofu soup was definitely spicy and delicious. It came out pipping hot with a side of rice. The spicy black bean noodles with seafood came in a HUGE portion. You can definitely share this among 2-4 people. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be so I asked for extra hot sauce on the side. The black bean sauce was alright compared to the ones I've had in SoCal.

If I could, I'd go back again today! \n\nThe lunch menu is very extensive & the prices are reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get. We started with the fish jun, fish slices dipped in egg & fried. Yummy with the dipping sauce. They also brought us an order of pot stickers & salads on the house. Nice! For lunch I got the stone pot bi bim bob. Wow this was quite a dish with tons of fresh veggies, egg, rice, & I added chicken. I struggled to eat it cuz it just would NOT cool down! Everything was cooking in the pot the entire time it was on the table. I burned my mouth over & over cuz I didn't want to slow down. I just loved how the rice got all nice & crunchy on the bottom. Somehow I managed to eat the entire pot! Call me a piggy, I don't mind. \n\nThey even gave us those little plates of unidentifiable side dishes that I love so much. Refills too! \n\nWe split the bill 5 ways & it only came to $15 per person. That's a lot of food for little money.

About five minutes after being seated by our server, he came by and asked if we've ordered already. Um, we hadn't even gotten our menus yet! He promptly came back with them and we placed our orders. We were then given one small green salad. Yup, one. Guess we were supposed to share... good thing I'm used to (and have no shame in) eating off other people's plates!

This looked like bloody murder on a plate it was so red - the chicken, zucchini, and onions were saturated with the crimson-hued sauce. It was really tasty though - great balance of spicy and sweet (though just a tad cloying for my taste). Also loved the fact that they use all thigh meat - dark meat kicks white meat's ass! The thick layer of red oil floating on top of the sauce was a little unappetizing though...\n\nAll in all, this place was decent, but I'm not sure if I'd come back when there are so many other (cheaper) restaurants in the TL I've yet to try.", "author": "Steph L."}

This is a pretty no-frills, comfort food for the Korean soul, kind of place. It's not a fancy kalbi/bulgogi place or impress-a-date place -- it's where I come when I just need some down-home Korean cooking because they do the basics right.\n\nFirstly, it's a pretty good selection of banchan. Which, surprisingly, isn't that easy to find in SF. The yuk-gae-jang is really good (and I usually have enough leftover for a second bowl to take home) and the kimchi-jun (kimchi pancake) is also really good, although it is oily (in a good way, in that delicious fried way). \n\nThe dolsot bibimbap is fine and the soondobu chigae is also pretty good. The mae-woon tang was okay - I've had better but not in the Bay area (yet).\n\nAnd the best part is that they have so much to choose from, if you like Korean comfort food (stews and soups, mostly).\n\nBut, if you're looking for homemade mandoo, not your place. If you want the finest charbroiled kalbi or bulgogi, not the place - the bulgogi was a little on the sweet side but there was a lot of it so I guess it depends on what you're looking for. But if you need a hot, spicy stew or soup, or something warm and comforting in your belly, Korean-style, then I would definitely recommend this place. \n\nAnd the service is pretty good - I've never been there when they're packed and they never seem to have more than 2 waitresses so, again, just manage expectations. \n\nWorst part? Has to be the prices - I mean, it's a supply and demand curve; it's not like the 'Loin is bursting at the seams with Korean places, but I find it's an easy choice to make when I need some Korean.", "author": "S.

And, apparently, Korean Chinese cuisine--as Cham Pong soup is one of my \"favorite things.\"\n\nI knew there HAD to be good Korean food in San Fran, so I set hubby to work on the iPhone to sniff it out. What we learned about Dong Baek I am ever so grateful for. This place helped me work through the final days of a week-long conference in style, health, and comfort in the way that only a super-spicy hot soup can do. \n\nWe had a long night, a long morning, and a long run before we headed in to the restaurant for what was to be breakfast, lunch, AND dinner to us. As 3:30 is an odd time for any of those three meals, we were the only folks in the restaurant save for the team running it. Ambiance was cool. I'm not sure if this is always the case, but there was very loud pop music playing, Korean news on 3 TVs, and some discordant version of Mtv that an adolescent (owner's daughter, perhaps?) was really enjoying. I like this feel in a restaurant. I think it comes from my 4-H days of working in small cramped kitchens to prepare meals for the posse polo riders. There's a sense of community and family that's really pleasant. Like people spend time there even when they're not working. \n\nAnyhoo, first up for us was the banchan which was plentiful and tasty. Nine or 12 dishes ... I lost track of one of the rows of there. Hubs opted for bibimbop with spicy kimchi instead of ground beef. I, of course, had Cham Pong. The 'bop was beautiful, but I saved my valuable real estate for soup, soup, soup. Unlike Arirang's version (see my earlier review for details): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=LppJHKekgS1MyV29atuj9A&q=cafe+arirang\n \nthis one had a much lighter broth with less emphasis on the paprika. There was also a greater emphasis on the seafood. The shrimp here were jumbo, there were large scallops, a clam or two, and many, many squids. Not sayin' either recipe is better than the other, mind you, just different.\n\nMidway through our meals, the server brought us out a complimentary order of Korean cheese corn on the house. It was delightfully ooey, gooey, and rich. As one who is not too into sweet things, the golden corn made for a perfect dessert. \n\nWe had a nice conversation with our host upon check out. She was fascinated with where we \"learned to eat Korean food,\" a nod which made me feel proud like a teenage kid. I explained to her that it was in Corvallis, at a now closed tiny restaurant, that I learned to love the spicy. And she taught me that my favorite, blazing soup is a Korean-Chinese dish--not a Korean one. I love how food can bring people together. It's time for more of that in my life.

We took it as a good sign.\n\nWe ordered basics:\n\nAppetizer: Hae Mul Pajeon ($10.95 for small) - this is mixed seafood pancake with green onions. The small was pretty sizable. Maybe not the tastiest but I liked the consistency - right amount of crispiness on the edges and not watery mushy like some places. Could use more seafood but not bad. Caught some shrimp and calamari and imitation crab meat here and there.\n\nMains to Share:\n- Dol Sot Bibimbap ($12.50 or less) - pretty basic. Not outstanding. Maybe because we didn't spread the rice around the stone pot as my usual method. It was beyond my reach.\n- Za Zang Myun ($7.50) - noodles were just right - QQ - al dente - however you want to state it, they tasted fresh and springy. And it came with lots of black bean sauce. Only thing I would add is sprouts or some veggies.\n\nBanchan: I counted 1 salad bowl (for the table) + 8 varieties of small dishes but they give you very little of it in each dish - fried potato, kim chee cabbage, spicy cucumber, spicy daikon chunks, sprouts, seaweed, shredded tempura skin, and steamed broccoli. They didn't offer to refill though I think they would have if we asked.

They even have some of the Korean/Chinese dishes like jah jahng mien (black bean sauce noodles) but they also offer the full range of bbq'd meats and stews. They also bring out \"banchan\" all the sides you get with a full Korean meal.\n\nThe negative points:\nTwo servers for like 20 tables. They're super nice but when it's busy there is no way to handle that many tables and bus them as well. If they just added one bus boy that would give them some relief to be able to at least check on you once. Basically I watched people get up and ask for things or you have to almost grab the waiter as he/she runs by to ask for something. BUT they're running around so much they forget so you have to repeat this a good 5 times.\n\nThe food: Most of the food was good. We order Kal Bi (short ribs) which was good. Pah Jun (Korean green onion and seafood pancake) and the Jah Jahng Mien. A lot of food yes. The main dishes were good. Not spectacular but good enough if we don't want a long commute to get some Korean. The banchan however, we noticed was not as fresh. Don't get me wrong, it's mostly pickled vegetables so there are various stages of sour and in a Korean home its all good when it gets sour but at a restaurant you're pretty much getting served some old banchan. Not all of it was like that but a couple of the dishes were.\n\n\nSo I'm torn about this place. I wanted it to be good really bad and the food was decent but they are just severely understaffed. We literally were never checked on. Anytime we needed anything we had to almost grab the server physically since they're so busy. Just unfortunate that is the case but knowing that I'd go back in a pinch.", "author": "Hyung L."}

My Korean friends end up going to Oakland, San Jose and even LA.  No need to do that anymore with Dong Baek in the house!  I even made a video review featuring my family and very picky Korean mother-in-law at Dong Baek last Saturday.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk9_qKNkIsw.\n\nI was shocked at how extensive the menu is.  There's something for everyone in my (picky) family -- my youngest son likes Kalbi, my Korean-American husband craves Ja Jang Myun (homemade noodles with pork and black bean sauce) and I wanted the Stone Bi Bim Bop.  Big kudos on all the main dishes -- all tasty and authentic.  Same quality as you can get in Seoul (really.  I just spent two weeks there on a family vacation).\n\nThe kimchee, itself wasn't that impressive.  It lacked the depth and acidity and tang that I was looking for.  Then again -- no one makes kimchee like my mother-in-law.  Also -- thumbs down on the steamed pot stickers because they lacked flavor.  \n\nMy family will definitely be going back.  I want to try the  Mul Nang Myun (Cold buckwheat noodle soup) and Kal-bi Tang (beef short-rib soup).  The service was good despite that it seemed understaffed -- one guy running around a little frantic.  He came whenever we called him over, which was a lot.  \n\nThe neighborhood feels a bit sketchy so stay alert.  It's only a few blocks East of Tommy's Joynt.  We got super lucky to get a parking spot on the same block -- I don't expect that to happen again.", "author": "Sabrina G."}

The bachan that were served consist of very small portions of 3 different kinds of kimchi, cucumber, bean sprout, seaweed, but no egg or seafood like anchovy or raw squid.

So, ordering for myself was a little tough. \n\nWe chose this place because you do not cook your own food. Everything is done in the kitchen so when you leave you won't smell like Korean food. Which is a plus when you're about to be in a small room filled with people. \n\nI was able to eat the shrimp and veggie tempura, the corn and cheese free appetizer, and the seafood pancake. I LOVE the Asian pancake thing. Beef pancake, chive pancake, turnip cake, seafood pancake... I love them all. Everything I had was good. My dining companions liked all the sesame stuff too. The hot pot looked great. I love crispy rice, but it had sesame in it. The bip bam boo (uhhh, i think it's called that) I heard was delicious. It was the beef without the bone. \n\nWe got tons of free appetizers, boiled pot stickers, corn and cheese, miso soup, and some others. So order light cause you'll end up with way too much food! And if they don't bring you extra food, then you can just order more if you're still hungry. \n\nAll in all, it's good food, hard to special order (they put sesame seeds on some stuff we asked for none - granted Korean is probably the hardest to order with a sesame allergy, so I can't complain), great service, you won't smell, a little pricier than I expected but dishes were very big.

I live a block away from here and in the 1.5 years I've lived downtown the only Korean restaurant I've gone to is Coco Bang (which has a couple of really good dishes of its own but otherwise very nominal Korean food). My friend had told me about this place and she said it was \"ok\", and since my friend is also Korean and from Korea Town (LA) I took her word for it. However this was before the management changed and so I decided to give this place a shot. \n\nHere's a tip: You could always judge a Korean restaurant by the quality of its ban chan (small side dishes) and kimchi. Dong Baek does both well. The ban chan was fresh, tasty, and there was a good variety. Now it's not the best ban chan I've had nor the widest assortment, but overall it was good. The kimchi was also good, but a bit too vinegary for my own taste however others may enjoy that. Their gak duki (raddish kimchi) was superb! I'm a big gak duki fan not only because its delicious but because its also fun to say. GAK-Duki!\n\nI had the dol sot bi bim bap (hot stone pot rice with assorted veggies and beef) and the soon do bu ji gae (hot spicy tofu soup). I would give the bi bim bap 5 stars and the soon do bu 4 stars. You definitely can't go wrong with their dol sot bi bim bap though and if its your first time trying Korean food I'd probably stick with that or some kind of bbq (kal-bi, bul-gogi). \n\nThe service was fast and friendly, and all in all I really enjoyed my meal here. If you're in the downtown area and craving Korean then I recommend checking this place out. It's not the best I've ever had, but it more than satisfies the Korean craving. I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Richard K."}

The gam ja tang threw me off because it was yellow instead of the usual orangy red. But nonetheless, it was still pretty tasty. They put alot of veggie in it. The pork was ok. a little fatty. \n\nIt was quite busy for a Thursday night I thought. The price is average.. not cheap considering the area.

Mystery substances that tasted like fish, swimming around my styrofoam trough in an equally mysterious liquid.  Gone are the days of the meat physically hitting the grill just prior to pick up.

All the spicy items are far too bland to actually bring you to tears, but the tears come anyway because of the confusion disappointment that you experience in the sugary, syrupy sauces. The only dish that worked in favor of this flaw was the tofu kimchi, a pile of sauteed kimchi and pork served with unseasoned tofu on the side. The contrast of the sweetened spicy-sour cabbage (and it's seasoned ok, since kimchi is so salty to begin with) with the innocent plain tofu is actually incredibly complex and enjoyable; it would have been better had the tofu been cold and the kimchi seasoned more liberally with salt and sesame oil. The black bean noodles are acceptable, still on the sweet side. What could potentially be a wonderful dish in the pan-fried jjam-ppong (saucy instead of soupy) is completely sullied by sugar and not enough heat. The bu dae chi gae is a travesty, littered with too many embarrasing applications of meat to be enjoyable. You may be thinking, what is she expecting from a dish whose main ingredients are Spam and hot dogs? But there's a right way to do it and a wrong, fake-Gucci-bag way to do it. C'mon, Dong Baek, there's no sense in trying to take shortcuts in this dish.\n\nIf Ms. Lopez and I were ever to meet and she wanted to go get some K-dinner, I would definitely not take her here. As much as I appreciate the effort, letting Dong Baek get me again would be akin to going back to the abusive arms of Billy Campbell. And to think one is supposed to pay 50 cents for the after-dinner coffee at a Korean restaurant.... don't even get me started.", "author": "Nuri K."}

I alternate between their Kal Bi (bbq ribs) or Beef Chap Chae and both are mouth watering nom nom nom goodness.

I once ordered beef chap chae after lunch hours and got two huge take out boxes... one was rice and the other was the beef chap chae. It's so huge that you could divide amongst two people or split it for lunch and dinner. That cost $13 which is cheap considering that 1) it's only $3 more than the lunch price and 2) it's a huge portion of food.

I also enjoy trying new places. So today I gave Dong Baek a shot for lunch. I ordered the number 14 lunch special for $7.25 - Soon Tofu Chi Gae - soft bean cake casserole with hot bean paste, vegetable and beef. About 6 different panchan (and a bowl of rice of course) came with it. Nothing super interesting or different with the panchan except for a dish of tempura style green beans topped with a dark sweet sauce. \n\nThe dish is really a soup, not a casserole per se, and contained two mysterious oysters not indicated on the menu. No complaints from me, I liked them, but someone else may not appreciate their unannounced appearance. There was also precious little visible beef. Unlike My Tofu House, you aren't given the option of regulating the spice level here. I normally order mild at My Tofu House and add kimchee or hot sauce if I think it needs more kick. Here, it just comes out one way - red, hot and bubbling up at you with a dare. You might say I was dragged out of the shallow end of the Korean hot bean paste pool and drop kicked into the deep zone. I survived quite well. Although I did ask for (uhhhh...ok, NEEDED) an additional serving of the only two cooling panchan - the bean sprout salad and the daikon salad. I also missed the raw egg that I've been offered at other places serving soon dubu. So even though the soup was fairly tasty, it lacked the silky texture and slight mellowing effect mixing in the egg provides. \n\nDong Baek has an attractive and spacious traditional interior, with lots of warm carved wood and some private dining alcoves. The friendly single server did a good job of covering the tables all on her own. I can't say I was big fan of the sappy 80's soft rock radio playing in the background. Overall, I am glad I tried it, but no, no nearby substitute was found for My Tofu House. I guess I just need to light a fire under my lazy ass. Lol.

Good assortment of banchan, and I think they have duk bokki (will try ordering next time;  snapped a cell phone pic of a menu item posted on the wall that was written only in korean, with the intention of asking a friend to translate but haven't gotten around to it yet).\n\nHOWEVER.  My most recent visit was pretty disappointing.  If I were to base my review solely on that visit, Dong Baek would only be getting two stars....  I had been obsessing about spicy, piping hot soon doobu for days, but was too lazy to trek out to My Tofu House and endure any sort of wait.  I thought that perhaps Dong Baek, conveniently located only blocks away in my 'hood, could adequately quell the craving.  I was sorely and sadly mistaken.\n\nMy soon doobu came out warm/hot enough for a regular soup, but it did not come out boiling in its own bowl like it should be.  It also wasn't spicy at all, despite my having emphasized that I wanted it spicy.  Beyond that, there wasn't much depth of flavor, and the soggy zucchini (a vegetable which has minimal flavor itself) didn't improve things.  I tried to make do by adding some kimchi and other banchan to bites, which helped,  but eventually I'd had enough Mickey Mousing around -- I was in the mood for SPICY food, damnit -- so I asked if I could get some hot sauce or something.  The woman (she appeared to be the proprietress) had somewhat limited english skills, but when the message got through that I was looking to augment the spice level (\"Ohhh, spicy ok?\" she asked incredulously), she ran back into the kitchen and returned with a container of red paste.  Even after mixing a couple heaping spoonfuls into my soup, it still barely had any spice, though at least it was a little more flavorful.\n\nNot sure what the deal was.  I have a suspicion that maybe my food was dumbed down because I'm not Korean and was dining with a white boy.  Towards the end of our meal, a table of Koreans across from us were served a soup that was furiously bubbling away in its little cauldron, and I spied something that resembled a squeeze bottle of spiciness on their table as well.\n\nI'm sure I'll return to see if they have duk bokki as rumored, but I don't know if I'll get soon doobu here again (though I remember it being decent in the past).

The waitress came to our table only twice although we were one of only 2 tables! We had to get up and find her to get and pay the bill. It's also way overpriced for the quality, 10-20 bucks a dish. AVOID THIS TASTELESS MONEY PIT!", "author": "cc v."}

It was actually a great little find in the middle of the loin.  Cute decor inside and good signage outside.  Food was good.  I really enjoyed the dol sot bi bim bab but the seafood pancake was a little soggy but tasty.  By the end of the meal, every square inch of our table was filled with little dishes, glasses and evidence of our very big appetitites.  One of my fave Korean places so far.", "author": "Dana C."}

I happened to be in the city and was craving for the soup. I was too tired to drive to East Bay although it cost twice as much and tasted just okay. The broth didn't have much flavor and had bunch of hot pepper and oil. If I don't get lucky with parking, I doubt that I would come again.", "author": "Cuddles C."}

However this was probably the highlight of the relationship when I look back at it. What the relationship has to with this restaurant? nothing, just htat I remember this place being yum. Their Kai bi, Kim Chi chege, and the service is sweet ^_^. It's in a fabulous area too Tenderloin! Can't get more ghetto than that! (Ok I was being sarcastic) Anyway, parking is a bitch, but 38 bus will take you there. You can't miss it, it's accross from hwere the old Naan and Curry Used to be (if memory serves me correct) go try it. ^_^", "author": "Bianca L."}

For SF area korean restaurant, I'd give two star but as a korean restaurant.  prompt attention was good.  one of my pet peeve is that appetizer come at the same time as entree...seafood pancake was 3 start but pretty plain...shrimps has shells on them (tail portion)...WTF?? take that s**t off before you cook!!!  ordered fried kimchi and tofu which is known to be order with Soju (korean grain alcohol) or beer...it tasted flat...no complexity what-so-ever...very salty with crap load of MSG...some that gets cooked by untalented mothers what cooks fishes out of the box.  i know my dogs won't eat it.  most disappointing...ordered nang myun (cold broth noodle - it was 88F in SF this day...very hot for SF) with sa-ri (this means extra portion of noodle)  when the noodle came...no hot mustard, no vinegar...had to ask for them...noodle broth tasted very sour...it suppose to be beef broth...and diner can add vinegar and hot mustard to their taste...sa-ri (extra noodle with no addition broth...how do they expect eat that extra noodle)  so far, most restaurant when sa-ri is orderd, there comes extra portion of noodle in a bowl with 'broth' in it...bad business practice...don't they not wanna provide a good dining experience so they will have a repeat customer???  this restaurant USED to be so GOOD\n\none of way I can tell crappy restaurant is they make it salty...salt does bring out the flavor but not when masquerade it all over...that's sign of sh**ty arse cook.  food price is avg for SF not cheap.  take your $$$ to go oakland or berkeley for korean food.  go only if you don't care what the food taste like but want more than USDA recommended sodium intake...you will leave happy and bloated\n\nwe left with a bad taste (MSG) in the mouth...\n\nsundays they open for dinner only", "author": "B K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-03", "description": "My boyfriend and I usually eat here if we want something healthy or a lot of vegetables! We love how they always serve the multiple little bowls of various korean veggies, fishcakes, and kimchi when we first sit. And they hot tea is pretty good, not like regular tea from chinese resturaunts. Their prices are just a tad extreme but I guess it's worth it since it's so authentic. But we usually try to catch the lunch special from 11am to 3pm..way cheaper but not as much variety. We give them 4 stars only because everything is well prepared and tastey but if the waiters and waitresses don't really make it a memorable experience. you know when you show up in a place a bunch of times and they start to recognize your face so you two kind of know eachother already?", "author": "kirehleen f."}

My friends and I (all of us Korean) went for an early dinner to get samgyupsal and soju. We ordered 2 orders of samgyupsal and jjam pong. The jampong was okay, but the waitress brought out two big dishes piled with luke-warm samgyupsal.. We were very disappointed since we had been expecting to grill it from our table. Had we known, we would have ordered something else. We were miserable stuck with two huge piles of cold samgyupsal and ended up leaving most of it.. I will never go back again", "author": "Alexi P."}

Their kalbi is the perfect balance of juicy beef and crisped fat, all temptingly hinged on a tasty short rib.  But wait!  There's more.  Their array of pickled nibblies will take you to kimchee heaven.", "author": "M A N I K."}

The clay pot beef/tofu soup we had was medium spicy, hearty, and overall pretty good.  Reasonable prices.  A little low on the joy + celebration + party feel, more just a place to come and eat.  All the usual condiments to fill up on and it's open from 11-11 everyday.", "author": "Gil S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-07-16", "description": "I am not Korean, I am a vegetarian, and I haven't been able to like fermented foods, so I am probably not qualified to review a Korean restaurant. I like to order the dol sot bi bim bap with no beef, which unlike plain bi bim bap, comes in the stone bowl with a raw egg on top. This may be the only vegetarian option, but that's ok because I really like it. They give you the usual 10 bowls of pickled items before your meal. My dining companion likes this place because they serve cold soup noodles, which has apple, radish, and hard boiled egg. Get a big bottle of Korean beer to share.", "author": "Amy E."}

Because they had photos of food that are so faded, they just looked so unappetizing.   However, I went there with a group of friends because it was there and we had no good reason not to go there.  \n\nNot a bad Korean place.  Big enough to have Korean style drinking night out.  You know what I mean!  Price is a bit higher than I would like to pay but if you want to try average Korean, it is a place in TL.", "author": "Su Kyeong K."}

Forget Brother's on Geary, this place is the real deal.  You won't find a line forming with people who are not Korean, but you will find great tasting Korean food.  My favorites are the steam dishes, kori jim (oxtail) and kalbi jim (beef  short  ribs).   Ask for a table in a booth or sit on the floor Korean style.  Bring some friends, get a bottle of soju or  bok bun ja (raspberry  wine), munch on the dozen or so kimchee sampler and chow on  down.  If you're down for the Korean experience, keep the soju flowing and catch a cab on the way out.", "author": "Steve C."}

All was good.  Once I ordered take out for a soup I don't even like, but it was nutritious for my situation at the time.  And I loved it.  Their version of the soup converted me to liking the soup itself.  And they'd respected my wish for no shellfish.  I've always had good service here.  It's not on par with Korean restaurants in the east bay, south bay, NY or LA, but it's quite okay.  That rhyme wasn't intentional tho.", "author": "S M."}
