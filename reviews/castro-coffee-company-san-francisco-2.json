After all, I've bought the chocolate-dipped appendage on a stick that I lustfully yet respectfully dubbed Mandingo at Hot Cookie, wolfed down the overaccessorized wieners at Dapper Dog, and attended the most essential sing-alongs at the Castro Theater. Besides, I'm a Philz guy who becomes a creature of redundant habits. But I had never been here until I found myself in the Castro early on a weekday morning with a few minutes to spare before a medical appointment up the street.\n\nWhat deterred me is the claustrophobic space and the number of tourists and regulars who venture in but don't seem to come out. On this particular morning, it was almost empty which allowed me to get a pleasing 20-ounce cup of the Hawaiian Royal Kona coffee for just $2.15 (photo: http://bit.ly/2PJ1Nsg). It gave me a gulp of the tropics before my EKG and motivated me to come back to buy a bag of their beans. They spotlighted at least five different types that morning which I presume they rotate. I was just thinking how good a cup of the Geisha Esmeralda would go with a Mandingo.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...smooth richness with a different flavor\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still feels tight in here but I can bear it now\nSERVICE - 4 stars...awfully nice considering how long they must be in there every day\nTOTAL - 4 stars...indie coffee that worked for me\n\nRELATED - Hanging around in the Castro?

I couldn't resist a hot cuppa joe on this chilly night. \n\nSo I popped into this cute tiny coffee shop jam packed with coffees and pastries. The guys that attended me were friendly and polite. \n\nI had a drip coffee ($1.62) and an apricot bar ($3.25). For drip coffee, it's self serve by the door with 8 to choose from. Refills are like a buck twenty five. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't like anything I bought here. The coffee tasted artificial AF. (Bourbon Pecan is the one I chose). And the Apricot Bar was awful; too dense, not at all sweet...like whatsoever, tasted only of dried apricots and nothing else. \n\nCanned sodas are $1 ...so that's good cuz I was thirs tyy", "author": "Marilyn M."}

I first came across this place a few years ago when I was having difficulty finding blended (frappe) coffee in San Fran. \n\nThe shop has a lot to offer, many different types of coffees, syrups, beans, and pastries. I love their blended drinks. Tried a hot mocha once and have tried their pastries a couple times, they were good. \n\nI like how they have a little bit of seating outside. It is good to able to sit down and eat your pastry quickly especially if it is sunny. On my last trip to San Fran the smoke was making me so sick it was a blessing to be able to sit down for a bit. \n\nThe people who work here are nice and are good at making sure the line doesn't back up.", "author": "Rose P."}

Lactose tolerant thank you very much. \n\nI love that there's a huge selection of coffee pumps and that they change daily so you can really sample all the wonderful variety of roasts and blends this place carries. I personally prefer a medium or light roast so I get more caffeine to balance my heavy cream. There's always at least two choices, one Latin American and one usually African. I gravitate to Tanzanian and Costa Rican coffees and YES the coffee matters even though I drink it with heavy cream and brown sugar!", "author": "Tim P."}

It was a no-brainer until a couple of months ago because many types were I think $7.50/lb., which tends to be a lot cheaper than decent beans in a supermarket. Supporting a non-chain, local store is the icing on the cake. They've since raised prices a buck or so, but it's fine.\n\nI've only had their brewed coffee 1-2 times and it was really good, I'd choose here above the chains when I have the option. A pastry that I had, brownie/cherry, was solid as well. If I were in the area more at coffee-time I would definitely sit with a coffee and pastry.\n\nService is always nice and I rarely encounter a line, though I tend to be there in the evening or afternoon hours.", "author": "J.P.

So if it's a weekday, or  weekend evening consider getting here some way that does not involve driving or be prepared for a quarter mile park and walk. If it helps there is both a muni station and the a street car stop not quite a block away.\n\nThere are three or so patio style metal table/chair combos outside if you feel like having your coffee on site, but there is no inside seating and overall this is more of a walk in/walk out kinda place.\n\nDecor is what I'd describe as San Francisco utilitarian. The building itself has been here forever (it used to be the Castro Cheesery-but even under that name it was till a coffee place.) and has that settled well used look. The counter is dominated by every kind of coffee the world has to offer in bulk glass displays. While there is also an extensive selection of teas to chose from there are more then a hundred different types of coffee bean in stock. That's all pretty awesome but there's more. The baristas on deck have some mad coffee skills. This is easily one of the best espresso spots anywhere. The manager (who may also be the owner) on scene is turkish and well, he's forgotten more about what makes a great pull then most mortals ever know. If espresso is not your thing this place also puts out godlike latte's  cappuccinos and the like. As you might expect there is nothing wrong with the basic coffee's either and at 2.50 for a meduim-ish it's the total bargain choice.\n\nBut wait there's yet more awesome goodness here-the pastry counter. When you get up to the cashier section to pay for your drink and some beans (Hey, you're in line anyway. Why not?) there is amazingly tempting treats in a display case. If you need something more breakfasty then the mouth pleasing petit fours/truffles/things covered with sugar and oozing cream/almond paste/marzipan/whatever the croissants are the way to go as the bagels and burritos are just ordinary. Not bad mind you, but not anything to come just for either. Avoid the malt balls though-nobody orders those really and the ones on display have been there a while.\n\nSo while this is not the best spot to break out the laptop and pretend to work while secretly checking everyone out, this is one of the best high quality, local, quirky coffee spots in a city filled with excellent quirky coffee spots.", "author": "Steven W."}

Lo and behold I was pleasantly surprised to find a pretty incredible cup of coffee awaiting me, good service, and some pretty darn good pastries as well.\n\nThe shop is small, but the limited seating outside is pretty nice to catch up with a friend on a nice day (which it was). You come here for coffee and it is pretty evident once you set in. For some reason, a hand made cup of coffee caught my eye and unbeknownst to me, you have to pick the coffee to use. Say what!? I don't know where to begin with this...The gentleman behind the counter quickly sensed my confusion and shock and began to ask me what I liked and enjoyed and proceeded to make a recommendation which didn't fail. It was one of the best cups of coffee I ever had. No need for milk or sugar. Just one of the best cups.\n\nThere is a small selection of pastries and while they weren't the most amazing bites I ever had, but it doesn't disappoint.\n\nPrices are pretty reasonable and in my short time at the shop, it seems to be that quick grab and go spot that the locals hit up to grab their coffee before making their way on their daily routines.\n\nWould I go back?

Many whole bean options (I grind fresh at home each day), and REAL authentic light roasts. If you are a real fan of light only, you know how medium is often passed off as light. These beans here are visible and on display when you choose. Most prices are in the low to mid teens per pound, for a real, actual 16 ounce pound. Whereas other high end roasts are 10-12 ounces, and are priced anywhere from $16 to over $20....\n\nIf you have a cup of brew from the store, it is not an individual pour over made for you, it's from a pump canister. THAT SAID (because you know this could be not so great, in all reality), yesterday I went in for the 1st time ever, at 3:30 pm, when you'd *expect* that to be less than fresh. I pumped out the VERY LAST cup and it absolutely tasted just minutes old. REALLY GREAT COFFEE. Meaning that, at that late hour, they obviously turn over the product too fast for it to sit long. Also, that cup of amazing coffee was only $1.65 for a small.\n\nEXTREME BONUS: among the cream options is heavy cream. I can't really do coffee with half and half-it's just not the same. So really, in a nutshell, I found here all of the things I've never ever managed to find anywhere. Can't imagine myself ever going anywhere else now.", "author": "Richard V."}

We were spending the day in SF although we reside in San Jose. I was very happy with the soy white mocha I ordered, but more importantly, the owner was very friendly and knowledgable about the different kinds of coffee. We purchased the Kona Golden at his suggestion, and we are soooo glad we did! It is amazing..no acidity, just very smooth. We are big time coffee drinkers who drink ALOT of coffee daily, so this was a nice surprise, and I think we are hooked. We now have an excuse to drive from San Jose to SF a little more often : ) The best part though, was the owner offered the hubby a free cup of coffee on the way out, which was very gracious and shows he has hospitality. We will definately be back!", "author": "Rowena C."}

Everyone was happy and there was lots of singing and dancing. The egg, cheese and ham was perfectly prepared between the crispiest and butteriest croissant. I just wish the pumpkin spice latte had been as good as (here is where you shoot me dead...) Starbuck's version. I'm just calling it like I see it! Prices were reasonable and at least my tummy was happy.  I just wish those bitches had staged a benefit in my honor while they were busy partying in my mouth. Cuz I'm kinda broke.", "author": "Jill D."}

The caffeinated aroma that wafts out onto the street is alluring, and the coffee lives up to the promise of its scent. Excellent prices on beans by the bag. If I'm going to invest in a hunk of cheese, however, I'd sooner cross the street and go to AG Ferrari.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

I went in as I remembered a friend had recommended the place and was impressed immediately by the huge selection of whole bean coffee available.  Not only that, but the selection of fair trade and organic was one of the largest I've seen outside of Seattle.  I ordered a pound each of the Mexican Organic and the Moka Java and both tasted amazing.  At $8.50/lb for each of them, the price was great.  The place was staffed by a very friendly person who was great in explaining the difference between the dark and light roasts available for the Moka Java (dark being more flavorful but with less caffeine).  I didn't order coffee as that was the first day of my cold but someone in front of me was raving about their latte.  I tried to check-in on Yelp and was shocked they weren't on there so thought I'd add them.   Check this place out next time you're in San Francisco.", "author": "Tony R."}

I think even the sign says castro coffee or something such as that. Anyway, ive always seen that they have breakfast sandwiches, right near the muni stop, very convenient, but I never went inside till yesterday, when I was on my way to a museum. J and I went in to grab a quick bite.. I got the spinach empanada with a small soy chai latte, and he got a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with a small mocha latte with soy. Wow. We could have gone to the grocery store and baked everything ourselves in shorter time. Mine was already made, all she had to do was microwave it. I thought she was done with that and ordered my tea, but didn't realize she was still on that, and hadn't even started the sandwich. By the time these four items were done, there was a giant line behind us. This woman moved in super slow motion. I felt really frustrated. I realize it doesn't have to be a fast food pace, but I would seriously have to TRY to move as slow as she did. She also was not responsive to things like hi, good morning... I felt like I fell into a slowness time warp, but didn't know if it was just me. After we left (in which time as I was paying, another employee popped in and rung up a guy's coffee bean order during the time it took her to ring up mine..she was that slow), I asked j and he was just as incredulous about the slowness as I was. As was our friend a, who was waiting for us outside. Those four items were $16. My food was ok, not bad, not good. My tea was not the best ever but pretty good. J thought his coffee was very good, the sandwich was kinda bleh with runny eggs. There is a huge variety of coffee beans there, so if I was a coffee person, maybe I'd come in for that. But if you're looking to grab breakfast in the morning, go someplace else. You'll miss your train, be super late for work, age 50 years, and only get a mediocre bleh meal for it. Maybe she was having a bad day, who knows. :)", "author": "Merredith L."}

I walked by figuring I could stock up on some coffee and get some cheese for a small dinner party I was attending. I asked the counter person which organic dark coffee he recommended. There were signs all over for organic coffee at $6.50 a pound. He recommended one that looked to be $8.50/ pound. After he ground it for my espresso maker I asked to get some Brie. Nope, they only had Havarti and 2 other cheeses. What!? Only that. Fine. I'm ready just the coffee thank you. That will be $11.99. Excuse me!? The sign says $8.50. Counter guy came around the counter and showed me no, that in fact that $8.50 sign was for another blend who's name was hidden behind some kind of choco bar box. Well, what can I do now, it's already ground, I want to leave. So I hand over my card. No apology, no offer for a free cup of coffee. No nothing.
