Incognito and with that silly grin on his face...\n\nI like Hamburger Haven because it's like walking into a burger joint decades ago, d'oh since 1968, and no it's not a chain but has survived the fast-food boom, & lately the fancy burger spots *pinky up!* It's just steady, Freddy!\n\nLocated on Clement St. & 9th Ave. in the inner richmond district it is convenient for all. As you enter you'll notice the rustic decor mixed-in with a greasy spoon aura. The over-stuffed forest green stools fixed at the bar & the forest green booths whispers the 1970's. Framed photos of the owners, local celebrities, and some iconic faces of yesteryear scatter the walls as well. It's not fine dining by any means, but it's comfortable. Almost like at Grannies! \n\nI usually sit at the booth even if riding solo, unless it's a weekend then I'll slide over to the bar. I'm by no means a regular, however have been here several times and have my go-to's on the menu. I used to love the French Dip w/ Au Jus Special (not sure if it's still offered tho), the breakfast deals are good too (several to choose from, but the weekday special is the best), and of course it would be sacrilege to not have a fav burger here, so mine was the Haven Burger (1/3 burger, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, avo, grilled onions, jack cheese) or the Mushroom Swiss Cheeseburger. All comes with fries & potato salad or coleslaw. And vegheads don't fret... there are 3-types of vege burgers! So, although it's an old burger joint, the menu is more like a roadside diner... lot's to choose! \n\nHamburger Haven is by no means my favorite burger joint, but it's comfort to me. I know what to expect... A good burger or meal at diner prices. I have no problem returning next time, just glad smoking was outlawed years ago... 'cause the walls still smell so, Mary! The free nostalgia and quirkiness added bonus. \n\nRIP Robin! Ketchup later...", "author": "Eric R."}

I was probably on my way to a far trendier eatery ready to dine with hipsters half my age and twice as obnoxious. However, a moment of sheer spontaneity brought Jamie W. and me here as we impulsively boarded the 2-Clement on Market Street and took it to the end of the line around 12th Avenue. Strolling on Clement, we noticed how quiet the place was, and that appealed to us at that very moment. Once you enter, you feel like you're in an Edward Hopper painting with lonely-looking souls eating by themselves.\n\nWe parked ourselves in a two-seat booth along the wall and perused a menu that offered no less than 24 different hamburgers. Jamie went for his old stand-by, the $8.95 Patty Melt, which was exactly what it was supposed to be, a burger with grilled onions and melted jack cheese squeezed between two slices of toasted rye (see photo). Me, I felt an obligation to try the $9.50 Haven Burger, presumably the house special with avocado, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, grilled onions and melted jack cheese atop a medium-rare burger (see photo). It wasn't amazing, but it was good, solid comfort food. Plenty of fries came with both of our burgers, and they were moist on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside.\n\nBut even before my burger and fries, I had a $1.95 cup of their Chicken Rice Soup (see photo). Piping hot but comforting on a cold night. No complaints about the food whatsoever. It was exactly what Jamie and I wanted that evening. All the time we were there, there was barely a change in the clientele. Two solitary diners left, two more came in, usually being very chatty with the cook who looks like he's been manning the grill for quite sometime. Service was very low-key but attentive. Some of the daily specials they had listed sounded tempting like their Pork Roast on Tuesdays and their Shredded BBQ Pork Sandwich on Wednesdays, which I assume they make from the leftover pork from Tuesday. Yep, it's a no-frills, comfort-food diner alright.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...delivers the quality you expect and then some\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...formica and naugahyde like ebony and ivory\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...like I said, low-key but definitely present\nTOTAL - 4 stars...an unpolished gem of a greasy spoon if you ask me", "author": "Ed U."}

My shock came with a single waffle, doughy and undercooked, for $6.95 which has motivated us to walk a couple doors up to Ono Grindz and get our money's worth for Sunday breakfasts.\n\nThe burgers have suffered the same price/value inequality, but in their defense, the flavor was good and the lunch was filling and satisfying.\n\nI gave an extra star for the service and friendliness, and it's neighborhood atmosphere we've enjoyed as a family for decades. I can imagine the price increases are a combination of factors, but the prices are on par for much better fare at other places just a few blocks away. \n\nAll in all, it's the same restaurant but you'll spend 10-12 bucks more for the same family breakfast adventure, for the same food.", "author": "Edward P."}

They weren't terrible, but they also weren't memorable. They were simple and good if you just want a cheap breakfast fix. However, even though the food was okay, the service was great. The people who work there are super friendly and funny. They are not afraid to joke around or make small talk with the customers. I was especially surprised when their bus boy was talking Cantonese with some of the customer. The bus boy is Hispanic so I was surprised when hearing this. He later told my table that he was learning Cantonese at CCSF and felt that the best way to practice is to use it when having an opportunity.

I love the atmosphere here...  It's straight out of Reno circa 1970.  The decor is tastefully tacky.  The serving staff is super friendly and helpful.  My hamburger was indeed cooked medium as I had requested.\n\nNow the bad:\n\nHamburger was not good.  I got the Double deluxe - two patties, two cheese.  It was frozen Costco patties I swear!  Bun was unremarkable.  Fries skimpy and not crispy (I think they were cooked to order, but just under cooked).\n\nMy dining partner's spaghetti was even worse.  Minimal sauce.  Sauce definitely came out of can and not much was done to it to hide the fact.  The can's label also probably said \"Soup\" and not \"Sauce\"...  \n\nThe bottom line:\n\nI'm sure they serve decent food here as the place seemed to have a number of regulars - it's definitely not the hamburger (which is a tragedy for a place named Hamburger Haven) or spaghetti, though.  Despite the above, I would come back and give it another shot.  The decor is that good...  I think next time I'll try something off the breakfast menu.", "author": "Derrxck L."}

They have a ton of burger options on the menu, so that's good for variety's sake I suppose.  But between decent food, decent service, and mediocre atmosphere, it's not really great in any way.  \n\nI initially was mesmerized by the family of flies chillin above the tables in the back.  So that probably wasn't a good sign.  Now I get it, flies are pesky and when doors are open they can get in and stay for awhile...I just don't really enjoy seeing them while I eat.  I then also felt bad for our waitress.  She was very nice, but she had messed up an order at the table next to us and then proceeded to have 2 mixups with our order.  Three of us ordered 3 burgers.  One standard cheeseburger, one haven burger minus avocado with cheddar instead of jack cheese (so that could get confusing, i see), and one California burger.  What came out were two standard cheeseburgers and a haven burger without avocado but with jack cheese instead of cheddar.  So I had to wait while they made me a California burger instead of the extra cheeseburger they brought out.  It wasn't too long of a wait, but it was a slight annoyance and we didn't bother exchanging the haven burger for one with cheddar instead.  \n\nIn terms of the food taste, the burgers were actually pretty solid.  Standard burger taste, good ingredients, overall pleasant.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fries though.  They were thicker, almost steak cut, and pretty crispy.  This may be a style of fries some people love, but I prefer thinner fries, better flavored fries, or those with a nice combination of crispy outside with a soft interior.  \n\nSo I'll eat here when the coworkers want to come again, but I doubt I'll bring anyone here on my own.

To skip the details I'll just say that I'd prefer the raw bacon to be stored more properly and to be cooked a bit longer.\n\nMy toast arrived in front of me long before my omelet and hash browns did which meant that the toast was already cold when my main platter arrived.  The Denver Omelet had big chunks of ham, diced red onions and green bell peppers seared together on the griddle and pocketed into a thin two-egg shell.  The hash browns were enormous and quite good grilled to a golden brown on both sides with a soft but not mushy inside.\n\nThe downside of the whole meal was having this odd \"dirty oil\" taste in my mouth afterwards.

Namely I can eat my way around the neighborhood and report back to all you sexy Yelpers. So one Saturday AM a few weeks ago I made the dummy mistake of misreading my schedule showing up early to work--an hour and a half early. My boss just alughed at me, did the once over and gave me some sage advice. Her words of wisdom?\n\n\"Go over to Hamburger Haven. They make a fabulous hangover breakfast.\"\n\nOk in my own defense the night before WAS a dear friend's birthday and yeah, my boss was (kinda) aware of my mischeivious potential and its not like a) I reeked of booze, b) I wore sunglasses, c) I was feverishly trying to remove bar stamps. But I'm all for testing remedies to temporary self induced aliments so on to Hamburger Haven I went.\n\nUpon stepping inside, my first impression was classic diner with that '70's touch (dark wood, brown tiles, open kitchen). If I'd have seen ashtrays and non ironic trucker hats I'd have thought I stepped out of California. Even the photo of Robin Williams with who I assume are the owners and a young lady in a Hooters shirt doesn't distinguish the location as being in San Francisco. But  I observed that this little corner restaurant is a neighborhood spot as comfy as a pair flip flops in July. I watched patrons of all ages pop in with company, books and newspapers in hand, warmly greeted by the staff. I heard more than one cry of  \"The usual?\" from a staff member to a patron, followed by \"Sit down, I'll get you your coffee\".\n\nAbout that coffee....not too shabby. Not exactly what I look for (my idea of good coffee is something rich in flavor and with enough caffeine in it to potentially cause heart palpatations) but let me share with you that my cup NEVER was less than half empty before being topped off. Ditto with my water glass. And this was a busy Saturday AM. If customer service was based on refill status this place would be a 5 star winner.\n\nWhile coffee and water are 2 key ingredients to recovery one needs the third piece of the puzzle-grease. And you're in luck because this place specializes in that. I'm not saying I have an iron clad stomach but I could see if you are a health nut your belly might not be so happy after the shock. I'm a savory type of girl so piles of eggs and cheese and hash browns with the all important dosing of ketchup and hot sauce over the whole shebang works for me. The \"specials\" (which I don't think have changed for at least a decade) do in deed have a mattering of a special feel or theme to it. The country scramble (with eggs and ham and a biscuit and gravy) seems intriguing to say the least. I'll save that for a special circumstance morning (starving and wearing comfy pants). \n\nBut enough about breakfast, let's go to the other part of the day, lunch and dinner. I'll start with the namesake Hamburger Haven. The hamburgers are tasty enough but in order to truly live up to the title Haven I'd expect a little more variety. They feature classic options (bacon, cheese, California, etc) but no combination that could be described as memorable. The ingredients are run of the mill but are at least of decent quality. The fries are just passable too. If they really wanted to try and nab the idea of a \"Hamburger Haven\" maybe they could start doing an extra special type of burger. Come up with a theme burger for the week and change it up every week. I'm not saying twitter because I don't \"tweet\" but its a thought. \n\nThe majority of the rest of the menu is standard classic diner fare. The options I've tried ranged from ok to I feel like went to someone's mom's house. On a grubbin' scale, I'd put most of the food between a Stouffer's meal and spending the time to cook it yourself at home if you actually had time to go to the grocery store and keep a halfway decently stocked kitchen, which let's be honest no one does.

I love diner food and to be honest, there aren't a whole lot of places in SF that cater to that. Most places are pretty frou-frou. Hamburger Haven has a way of hitting that spot when you're craving some hash browns and bacon (so, for me, like every day. Luckily, I don't always indulge.) and just some regular, hearty food.\n\nI remember coming to this place a few times when I was a kid. This place feels exactly the same. It's got this authentic, old-timey vibe. It's the kind of place where you get called \"hun\" or \"sweetie.\" You can tell that many patrons are regulars. Plus points here. Our server (and, I suspect, owner) was really attentive and attempted to refill the coffee cup like 10 times.\n\nWe came here on our way up to Napa Valley for the weekend. Breakfast special for $5? I vote \"yea\" on that!  Nice, well-done hash browns, just like I ordered them, and lean bacon....what more could a girl want?", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I cannot believe this place doesn't get more love. \n\n\"A filthy grease-pit in an undeserved prime corner location on Clement St\"?! That is the furthest thing from the truth. It's a pleasantly low-key greasy spoon that has that perfect crowd -- a smattering of Russians, an ancient Chinese guy reading a paper at the counter, a young couple in the two-man booths, and a crazy guy talking to himself all create the perfect mise en scene. \n\nThe breakfast is cheap and filling (seriously, get there before eleven for the breakfast special and you can get crazy full for under five dollars). The sausage links are juicy, they get my eggs perfect over medium every time, and the hashbrowns are crispy as hell.\n\nThe burgers are, admittedly not those huge hulking Niman Ranch things so popular right now, but these are honest and v. v. tasty burgers that remind me of roadside burger joints in the Midwest and South.\n\n\"Service was ok I guess; nothing too bad or too good. The restaurant wasn't very clean, and the atmosphere was quite depressing.\" Wrong again, dipshit. The restaurant has this great, very authentic vibe to it. Getting breakfast at one of the booths for two is one of my favorite parts of the weekend. The service is great -- Majid in particular has this very wry and dry sense of humor and keeps the coffee coming.\n\n\"If you see this place and think it's some high-end gourmet burger joint, think again!!\" How fucking dumb would you to have to be to see the exterior of the Haven and think \"high-end gourmet burger joint?\" I'm going to say dumb enough to do these things:\n\n1. Pee in a beer can, forget you peed in the beer can, drink your own pee, not notice.\n\n2. Think all dogs are boys and all cats are girls.\n\n3. Think Carlos Mencia is really \"edgy.\"\n\nI know I'm focusing my rage on Jerry J.'s review, but I want to be clear that I hate everyone who gave this place one star equally. I want to punch you all in your stupid eyes until you see the truth. Jesus! \n \nAnd yes, I'll be the first to admit the Haven is not the perfect restaurant. Do not order anything with a side of vegatables -- they're frozen veggies from a bag given a few minutes on the grill. But the pure amount of vitriol for the place here, I'm amazed.

Outdated decor, decent and cheap food (albeit greasy and salty), and service that would be slightly subpar at any real restaurant, but acceptable for a diner.

Actually, it doesn't matter because you can get any of the above at any hour of the day. The food is good but kind of greasy. If you're on the Special K diet, you might not want to stop here. Otherwise, try the Denver omelette, Veggie burger, and Spaghetti with meat sauce. \n\nIt is a good neighborhood restaurant that's been around since the late 1970s/early 80s.

Normally we'd eat at Georgio's but we'd just been there on Saturday.  We were looking for something that wasn't pizza.  We spotted Hamburger Haven.  Yes, hamburgers and fries would hit the spot.  We parked.\n\nAs soon as we walked inside, I had second thoughts.  The place looked like it hadn't been updated since the 70s, the walls next to the booth we sat in were dirty, and it looked like the few patrons inside were eating pancakes, bacon, and eggs.  At 7:30 pm on a Monday.  Could this be a good sign for a place called Hamburger Haven?\n\nFortunately they have a back room that sits parties of 2 or more.  The waitress flipped on the light back there.  We had the whole room to ourselves (a good thing since our 4 year old was being particularly rambunctious) but it was FREEZING cold.  None of us took our coats off the entire meal.\n\nBut... NO HIGHCHAIRS.  Huh??!  And... why??!  The husband and I had to take turns holding the 10.5 month old princess.\n\nNot wanting breakfast food, we took a chance and ordered items from the dinner menu.  I ordered a cheeseburger with coleslaw and iced tea, the husband ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and Coke, and our 4 year old ordered a hot dog with french fries and milk.\n\nI'm glad we didn't chicken out because I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  Our cheeseburgers were very good.  I love how they slightly toast the bun.  The onion rings were very good and that's saying something because most places can't get them right.  And the french fries were damn near perfect: Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nI noticed that their milk shakes are only $3.95 (!!!) so we ordered a chocolate shake.  It tasted exactly like a homemade milkshake, i.e. made with chocolate ice cream and milk, not vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.  BIG thumbs up!\n\nThe waitress was attentive, refilling our drinks when necessary and didn't make us wait on the check which is a big pet peeve of mine.  Our entire check came to $31 and some change.\n\nGreat food for a diner.  Minus two stars for the creepy dirty 70s atmosphere and lack of highchairs.\n\nAll in all, I can't say we'd ever make a special trip to the Inner Richmond to go to Hamburger Haven but we'll probably stop by again when we're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Lori R."}

Sure enough, one hungover morning I peeled myself from bed, knowing exactly where I was going to trudge toward.  There's a special charm and familiar nostalgia at Hamburger Haven.  The service is always really friendly, and the owner is absolutely hilarious with his deadpan humor.  From the old school register, to the 1.25 bottomless coffee, the brown tile work, and the stools filled with regulars (which my boyfriend and I are quickly becoming) this place is really a gem.  The food good; go there for breakfast, read a paper, down some coffee, people watch, and enjoy!", "author": "Kasia P."}

The cook has no  idea what corned beef and hash is like, and if living dangerously is exciting, go ahead and try it. The cooks use deep fried discs of deep fried dog food for corned beef. Eat the caged eggs, eat the cheap toast, drink the metalic tasting coffee, enjoy the card board flavored waffles, but don't treat your life cheaply by eating the corned beef hash. If a cook from Hamburger Haven actually reads and cares about reviews from Yelp, I beg you to stop poisoning your customers with something YOU THINK is corned beef hash.", "author": "Brian J."}
