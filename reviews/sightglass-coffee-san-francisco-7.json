My local coffee shop in San Diego uses Sightglass and I absolutely love their coffee! It's been on my radar for quite a while and when I knew I was planning a trip to SF.. this was definitely on my list of things to do. \n\nI thought the location was absolutely adorable and I was so excited to sip on coffee from the second floor. \n\nSide note: The second floor was pretty warm and the heat seems to travel to the top/the building does not seem well ventilated. However, despite the unusual heat - this did not ruin my experience by any means. \n\nOverall my experience was amazing! I ended up ordering a pour over, which was so delicious and reasonably priced. I would definitely give this a try!", "author": "Brittney V."}

The pastries are pretty good, if you want something to accompany your drink. Despite the long line of people in front of me, and the growing number of people behind me, there were still plenty of places to sit. My friend and I enjoy a morning of chatting and coffee. I liked my coffee enough to bring home a bag of beans. \n\nThe most amazing thing about this place was how my friend, who used to work in the area, pulled out an old gift card from when the place first opened -- so old and weird, it was hand written on one of their first business cards -- and they still accepted it!", "author": "Jane H."}

The vibe is cool and has a kind of techie/hipster feel to it.  It's spacious with a large bar in the middle and seating on both the first and second floors to offer their guests ample room to enjoy your coffee drinks.  \n\nI've enjoyed their Espresso, Cappuccino and Gibraltars.  It just depends upon how I feel and if I want milk or none at all.  I like the Sightglass roasts since it typically has the right amount of acidity and is balanced really well.  \n\nI was meeting a friend upon my most recent visit, so I ordered a Gibraltar and a Kouign-Amann while I waited.  Both were excellent as I passed the time waiting for my friend to arrive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-01", "description": "Sightglass Coffee is one of many \"Third Wave\" coffee shops in San Francisco and this 7th street shop is Sightglass' flagship location (established in 2009). Unlike most other coffee shops and three other Sightglass Coffee physical locations, this branch has a hanging bike rack at the front entrance as well as the affogato bar upstairs (affogato = pouring hot espresso on top of a scoop of ice cream and their affogato uses ice cream from Salt & Straw). Our group didn't notice the affogato bar when we came here at 8 AM because the bar opens each day from 11 AM to 6 PM. There is only bar seating on the first level, but you can go up to the second level for more table seating. However, I didn't like how you have to be extra careful not to spill your latte as you walk up to the 2nd floor.\n\n***\n\nMushroom and Green Onion Sesame Tart ($5.50): Tart was crisp around the edges and I really like the mushroom filling.\n\nLatte ($5): I definitely like this latte better than Four Barrel Coffee's latte; this latte tasted more smooth.\n\nI also sampled my friend's cold brew iced coffee and it was better than my latte - iced coffee wasn't too sweet and tasted very smooth.\n\n***\n\nOverall this is a good all-around coffee shop (solid 4.5-star) and I would love to try their affogato bar if I do come back here again. I took a half-star off because I am not a fan of going up the stairs while holding a cup of latte and baked goods all at the same time.\n\nP.S. - No Wi-Fi here.", "author": "Luke L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-07", "description": "On a past trip to SF, I got a cup of coffee at this place in the Sunset. The barista told me about Sightglass. Two stories, large interior, great coffee. I bookmarked it immediately. \n\nThree days ago, I was back in the City and made some time to come here. The entrance opens up to a warehouse, converted into a roaster, cafe, hangout. The center station is where you place your orders, step back and wait. They will call your name, supposedly. \n\nMy friend got an iced drink. I went for my usual cappuccino. He complained his wasn't sweet enough. My cap was good, but not the best. This had a hint of acidity and was not as smooth as I'd had hoped. \n\nThe interior is 2 stories. Main station at the bottom, a smaller under utilized one on the 2nd floor. Downstairs, it's very spacious. A large roaster sits behind a fenced off section, but they cleverly placed counter seating against the fence. Good use of space. Other tables face the street. \n\nUpstairs, counter seating overlook the barista bar below them. Small tables are lined up against the wall. Behind another fence is the private cupping room. This is where educators offer coffee cupping lessons and tastings. It literally made me sad that I had to leave when it started. \n\nAlso sharing the upstairs space appears to be their office space. Many workstations with people that don't look like they're socializing at a cafe. This is the biggest coffee house I've ever been to. And I like it! \n\nThen, there's this: At first, the cashier told us to wait to the left of the station, as the drinks will come out on that side. Five min. later, he asked us to go to the right side. We waited and a gal barista said the iced drink is back on the left side, but no one called his name when the drink was ready. \n\nThen, she made the wrong drink because she was unable to read the cashier's apparent scribble on a Post-it note. And no one called my name either. Was that cashier dude not \"all there\" that day? \n\nI haven't tried any of their pastries, but their price points for coffee drinks and food items are higher than most places. It's a great place, but their service skills are pretty sloppy. I'm very glad they serve the coffee drinks in a porcelain cup, and not in a paper one. So, I'd still return. \n\nTips: \n* Downstairs, they usually serve blends, while upstairs is usually single origin. \n* Cupping lessons are complimentary, and happens on Fridays at 3. \n* Bags are beans and general merch on for sale. Maybe you can learn about their other blends @ the cupping event. \n* They rotate the blends,  it it seems the espresso based drinks is always Owl's Howl blend. \n* Street parking w/ meters, or about a block away, some free spots. \n* Restrooms are towards the right side near the back, once you enter.", "author": "James L."}

Luckily technology allows people to survive the day without more power when fully charged.

Is this the Twilight zone?\n\nFinally once his brain cells gave in, he gives me tap water (which is all I wanted).\n\nIf that's not enough, my husband was using the bathroom facilities (as my choking debacle was happening) and let's just say that aside for me still living, he was incredibly grateful for the copious amounts of coffee beans roasting in the background... because the deification aroma in those stalls were appalling.\n\nGuys, I get that cafes are meant to be pretty chill but clean up your bathrooms and be better Samaritans when you see that your customer is choking.", "author": "Nicole T."}

Great velvety texture without any of the grit making it's way through.  Flavor was robust and well rounded, with just hint of the lemony acidity finishing the shot off.  \n\nThe latte was delivered next.  Nicely topped off with a leaf design in the foam, which is usually a sign of the barista taking his/her time with the drink.

Sightglass isn't necessarily any better than Ritual, Four Barrel, or Blue Bottle, but it's not any worse, either. I have enjoyed stellar coffee from them all and enjoyed very pleasant return visits to each one, but if I were forced to choose a favorite of the four, I'd lean heavily towards the Sightglass \"mother ship\" in SOMA. I particularly like the range of Pacific single varietals that Sightglass carries, along with a wide range of East African, Central American, and South American options. \n\nThe Sightglass coffee packaging (a box and bag) are basic brown and can easily be composted or burned in a fireplace or wood stove, which I really like. I also use them to store cheese once I've removed it from their plastic packaging. Prices are high, but comparable to other city roasters who care about things other than the bottom line when it comes to locating coffee growers whose labor and land practices are sustainable, fair, and humane. My coffee strategy is to drink less quantity and focus instead on high quality, so the fact that eco-friendly, progressive businesses like Sightglass are successful positively warms my heart.\n\nI also love the artisinal ceramic cups and plates used, which have a rough yet comforting feel. And I love seeing the Probat roaster in such a prominent ground floor location, along with other signs of a working roastery that remind you of all the hours of labor that go into the process of making such exquisite products. Yes, there is a lot about Sightglass to love!\n\nThe second floor loft is the ideal space for enjoying your coffee and looking down on the milling crowds below. I have had so much fun watching the staff at Sightglass work. It's like a well-oiled machine, or a bee hive, lots of moving parts, beautifully orchestrated.\n\nIn the end, it's about more than the beans. It's about the people who work here, and the people who come to enjoy the coffee and other small bites. While other places may look more fancy or be located in trendier neighborhoods, I'll stick with Sightglass on 7th, any time I am heading into the city.", "author": "Camelia N."}

I love the coffee here so much, that I even bought a bag. As for the affogato, I still have dreams of this heavenly combination. This location has an affogato bar on the second floor, where you can customize which espresso and which ice cream you want.\n\nWIFI is non-existent. And so are OUTLETS. This is not a good place if you need either of those. But it makes sense since this is such a wonderful place that everyone wants to camp out. But just be warned!\n\nHowever, this is a nice place to read or do other work that doesn't require wifi. This location has a nice open space that is very soothing. There's a good amount of seating and tables. There's also a second floor with more seating and tables. It can get a little stuffy, but it's usually fine. \n\nStaff is FRIENDLY and will also give you great suggestions.

Only downside, the latte isn't the best.\n\nCame here around opening time on a weekday. Walking in, I was instantly awed by how much space this location has. Early in the morning, but before the business rush, there was no line. The cashier and barista were super friendly, which is always a nice start to the morning.\n\nHowever, I would say the almond milk latte I got was not up to snuff. The espresso was good and almond milk fine. The main issue I had was that the milk was lukewarm. Now, I'm all for not burning my mouth on scalding beverages, but I do expect my coffee to be warming.\n\nHopefully this was a one-off and I'm willing to give them a second chance.

Downstairs is pretty cramped for seating but there is plenty of seating upstairs. \nI've had the vanilla cold brew (~$5), which was some of the smoothest coffee I've ever had. I've also had an affogato from the affogato bar upstairs, which uses ice cream from salt and straw. I asked the barista what the smoothest coffee was, and she recommended the Ethiopian so I got that over the salt caramel ice cream! (~$6) It was so rich and delicious, although I do wish there had been more coffee. \nThe only downside is that this place has NO WIFI, so be prepared to tether to your phone and finish half your months data allowance in one sitting! Great trade off for such an aesthetic environment and smooth coffee.", "author": "Jordyn Yian C."}

Strange that most SF cafe's only serve these 2 types, but ok, let's roll with it! I ordered the mocha and it was quite good. Quality was there, smooth mocha flavor was there, it was slightly sweet but not too sweet, which is good.\n\nI was pleased with my mocha, but will only give it 3 stars because of the expensive price, small cup size and lack of latte flavors. Can we get a vanilla latte with homemade vanilla syrup? For the price, I don't think it's too much to ask.", "author": "Brian P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-26", "description": "Wait - No Wait\n\nValue - $5 / dish.\n\nDish Size: Medium\n\nVanilla Cold Brew with Almond Milk -  A must order. This cold brew is smooth, refreshing, not to sweet, and slightly acidic. It sets itself apart from other cold brews with the addition of vanilla which I believe adds a richness. I would also suggest ordering it with almond milk, at no additional charge, as it adds a nice nutty undertone to the coffee. \n\n\nIf not just for the coffee, you should visit the SOMA Sightglass location just for the space. It's a open airy light filled warehouse where the space is shared between the production equipment, retail space, and office spaces. \n\nThe entrance is setback a bit from the sidewalk to create a vestibule for wall mounted bike parking. At times the large sliding door is open, creating a free flowing and open space with the outside. The main features on the ground level is a large island bar and production roaster. It's pretty interesting to sit at the bar and watch the staff roast the coffee beans in front of you. On occasion, you can even see them scoop the beans into the final package. There's a small retail space where you can buy the same equipment used to make your coffee. As most craft coffee places these days, Sightglass uses digital scales to measure the weight and flow of the coffee in every step of the process, thus ensuring each cup is a consistent high level quality. In terms of taste, Sightglass has a variety of beans with different flavor profiles to choose from. In addition to the amazing coffee, Sightglass also offers pastries by Neighbor Bakehouse. If you don't know about Neighbor Bakehouse, be sure to read my review. Then order whatever pastries you can get your hands on.\n\nThe second level is lofted space that overlooks the entirety of the store. There's a handful of bar seating right next the handrail, which is a great place to setup and people watch. As opposed to the bar only seating on the first level, the second level has quite a few large communal tables. There's enough space for you to bring your laptop to work or a text book to study. It may have just been me, but I do not believe Sightglass offers wifi. Off to side there is a area where Sightglass holds weekly classes to teach the craft of brewing coffee and a small affogato bar! \n\nThe SOMA Sightglass location is the full package. It offers great coffee, a beautiful space, and an amazing experience. If you're thinking about a place for coffee, I highly recommend the SOMA Sightglass location.", "author": "Julian L."}

I absolutely loved it! It was so refreshing and the taste was tart and usually I don't like carbonated drinks either, but I couldn't stop sipping it. It was also a bit warmer and so the iced drink was a nice relief. \n\nThe drink was so nice I actually debated buying the cascara shrub syrup that they also sell, but decided against it as I was sure whatever I would try to concoct would not be as good as what the barista made.

Ugh.\n\nSo I schlep my carry on luggage upstairs to get my coffee, and lo and behold what do I see?  Some great community tables!  All full.  Full of what?  People at their computers doing some strange version of Bikram Yoga.  Super silent in the famous \"Staring Apple\" pose.  Thankfully the Macbooks that everyone had were made from aluminum and they had a higher melting point.  Sure...I will admit that I looked like a middle aged man who had run away from home and was just waiting for my ride back home, but the strangeness of this moment was not lost on me.  Literally not one word was spoken in the beautiful baking loft, aside from my awkward mumblings to the barista serving affagatos and espressos.  \n\nBut to the coffee.  I had intended to order up a decaf espresso and a regular cappuccino.  But the kind barista steered me in the opposite direction.  Thankfully she did and I was able to get a very good single origin and the house decaf was just bold enough to come through the warm milk.  This was officially my second and third coffees for the day....I would have one more just a little ways away at another famous coffee roaster.\n\nAside from the heat in the loft area...I love the openness of this business.

The place was so beautiful and gives a very hip, suave feel.It is two stories and if you want to order the Affagato, you have to go upstairs to order.\n\nI fell madly in love with the Vanilla Cold Brew Iced Coffee with Almond Milk. Usually almond milk would curdle in cold brew coffee because it won't mix well, but this place surprisingly did well for the coffee wasn't curdled from the Almond Milk. It was also interesting how they only have options of Whole Milk and Almond Milk. As a lover of Almond Milk, I was happy they had this option. The Vanilla Cold Brew Iced Coffee had the perfect amount of sweetness so I honestly didn't even add anything else.\n\nThe Bluegoon coffee was very smooth with a bit of citrus from what I recall. I love how they brew their coffees because it seems that everything is brewed smoothly.\n\nAlso, I ordered the Everything Croissant with Cream Cheese and I was honestly in love with it! I LOVE everything bagels and to have this in Croissant form really made me curious to try it! The out side is crunchy, covered in everything seasoning (garlic, onion, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, etc.), and inside had a cream cheese filling. I'm really hoping they have this pastry somewhere in LA because I'm for sure going to miss it!\n\nThis place is honestly great for small hang outs and dates, but I'm not really sure about studying since I've been looking at other people's reviews and they said this place doesn't offer Wifi.

Any pastry is good as gold, since they are stocking from b. Patisserie and Neighbor Bakehouse (both really worth a special visit!). If you're craving something sweet, get the kouign amann or pistachio blackberry croissant. For savories, pick up the ham gruyere morning bun or everything croissant.\n\nThis location has such a grand earthy vibe and anyone who walks in for the first time can understand why the rows of seats, tables, and stools are occupied by quiet readers, students, tech employees.\n\nDue to its location, it has a constant stream of caffeine deprived individuals throughout the morning.

Patisserie was to DIE for.\n\nI was in the Mission for a hip little interview I had and, I have to say, as \"hip\" as the thing I was interviewing for was, this area has everything you would want and need for a \"hip\" little area. (You know that young 20-something's posse it up here, saying? Yeah. This area is just for that.)\n\nI decided to try something that I could only get from Sightglass, and opted for their Vanilla Iced Cold Brew. It's their Owl's Howl espresso blend that is blended in cold water overnight, sweetened with organic agave nectar and Madagascar vanilla. For $4, it was definitely a pleasant difference from your average cold brew. I loved seeing the cold brew mixture mixing in through waves of white, milky vanilla and nectar. It was definitely a milkier kind of cold brew that isn't too overly-sweet... A sweet pick-me-up that didn't make me swoon but was still nice to try. (Not sure what the Owl's Howl blend actually tasted like, but it was smooth and light, not too bold of a roast.)\n\nThe gluten-free almond cake was just the perfect complement to the coffee. The guy said a lot of their pastries were already gone when I went because I came in the late afternoon, but, it was delicious...\n\nThe spot is small and is good for a quick grab-and-go. I love the clean open brown wooden coffee bar area. The seating for customers is more lounge-y, with couches ringing around the edges and small wooden tables on a nice white-and-black marble floor. It's cute and cozy and perfect for a few to work or chat, but it's not a big space to get too comfortable or have your own space. Their space invites open conversation and quick seating.\n\nDefinitely a hip crowd. They've got some great coffee and pastries, but pricing not an everyday pick-up. I seemed to have fallen in love with that pastry from B. Patisserie more than I did their coffee, but otherwise, it's a solid spot that I could see myself giving another go if I'm ever in the area again.", "author": "Rachel Ann C."}

At least it took credit cards and appeared to be free on Sundays (mental note for next time).\n\nThe space is actually really big, but both has cool and awkward parts of the layout and atmosphere. I liked the large windows that looked out towards the street and the second floor with seating which was also facing the outside windows. I didn't like the unfinished wood that was present almost everywhere I looked. Fortunately, the unfinished wood is mainly the beams in the ceiling and not anywhere you would sit.\n\nI got the Hooker's Mocha which was tasty and came with cool latte art (no whipped cream available). I was told you can get it in two sizes: 10oz paper cup or an 8oz ceramic mug. Both sizes come standard with two shots of espresso.\n\nThis is definitely a legit place to check out if you are near the area and looking for good coffee.", "author": "Regina W."}

A friend and I tried a new place everyday and this was by far my favorite! I do not remember what I got (I know it was with almond milk though), but I remember it was delicious! Like note taking delicious. I was looking through the notes in my phone and I jotted down \"Sightglass\". And that was all I wrote. Lol. I knew I would want to come back to this place if I found myself in San Francisco again (which is very likely), so I'm glad I saved the name at least! I remember the barista was very friendly. And the interior was nicely decorated. Very modern. It's also in a cool area... but then again, I think all of SF is cool.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-21", "description": "Before I started working here I was always fascinated by the place. I not only loved the design of the 7th and Folsom location but I was also aware that quality and service was of the utmost importance to the employees that worked there. The philosophy of the place was also quirky but pleasantly old school. In order to embrace a chatty, community friendly, and generally more loving environment the owners chose to forego offering wifi and outlets. They hope that customers will enjoy their drinks and short break at the stress free environment that is Sightglass. I think it's important to realize that people need a place to unwind and forget about work in this bustling concrete jungle of San Francisco. \n\nThe \"Brainwash\" cafe around the corner is a great place to sit and work if you need one.\n\nI would also like to commend them on their outstanding coffee sourcing and roasting. I've tried a few beans roasted in the bay area and I haven't found something as unique and interesting as Sightglass' light roasts. The menu changes frequently as the staff samples new beans, and you can expect to try a completely new bean at least every other week.", "author": "Edward D."}

We initially came here in order to get some studying and work done, so we asked for our coffee to drink there. However, upon realizing that they did not offer wifi, we decided to go elsewhere and asked for the coffee to-go instead. The girl stared at us so rudely, as if we were asking for so much. She did it though, so I let it go. My boyfriend tasted the coffee and asked for her to add a little bit of hot water because it wasn't as hot as he would've liked and the coffee only filled the to-go cup halfway. \"Well it won't taste good.\" She snapped rudely. My boyfriend politely said, \"it's okay, can you just add a little bit please?\" She looked at her coworker with an annoyed look, grabbed the cup, and did as requested, but she did so in the most rude way. At this point my boyfriend was begging me not to say anything and cause a scene so I didn't, but boy did I want to. I don't care how ridiculous a request might sound, or if you're having a bad day, or if you think we are being annoying (which I don't think we were), I do not think it is ever okay for someone working in customer service to treat their customers that way. \n\nThe great drinks and atmosphere may bring us back, but I'm hoping the service is better next time.", "author": "Jamie K."}

I personally do not come here on weekday mornings, and have heard lines can get pretty crazy. I have instead been here on weekdays and while it is still pretty busy (even hard to find a seat at times) the line has never been to bad. \n\nI generally get a cappuccino here with almond milk (they only have almond or whole milk, so if you don't want either of those options, may want to skip Sightglass). The cappuccino is really excellent, consistently one of the best I have had. The espresso has the slight sweetness and not much bitterness that you expect from a well pulled espresso shot. There is also the perfect amount of crema, and I have always been pretty happy with the amount of foam as well (their cappucinos are on the more wet side, so if you like a good amount of froth in yours, you may want to order it dry). \n\nThey always have a delicious looking selection of pastries, croissants, scones, and other baked goods. I've only had the bacon scone, which was fairly good, but a little too dense for me. They also have affogato- a little bit of ice cream topped with a shot of espresso. Highly recommend trying this- I loved mine and the espresso shot went super well with the intense, super dark chocolate I chose (they usually have around 3 ice cream flavors and 2 types of espresso to choose from).\n\nPrices are decent- I would say about on par with other similar coffee shops I've been to in SOMA, maybe even a little less than some. Not cheap, but well worth it. The place is huge (2 stories, high ceilings, etc.) but it does get busy with a lot of people hanging out with laptops and such. I have been able to find a seat every time I have been here on Saturday or Sunday though, and you can even usually find parking on the weekend without too much trouble if you choose to drive. \n\nSo far, this has been my favorite place to get a cappuccino in SOMA and I will definitely be back here.", "author": "Seema U."}

Two stories of coffee making madness... giant roaster running in the middle of the floor, huge cafe section as well. The space is just amazingly beautiful.\n\nUpstairs, there's a coffee lab area, where they showcase their coffee in guided tastings (of which I've only seen a similar space at Portola Coffee labs in Costa Mesa) and an affogato bar... which was what was exactly what I needed on this hot sweltering day... which was accentuated further inside by the temperature inside due to coffee being roasted. \n\nTo my surprise, this was not just dumping espresso on vanilla ice cream... they had 3 different espressos with specific recommended pairings of ice cream. I had what seemed strangest to do affogato with... blood orange ice cream??? But wow. It really paired well with the floral notes of the espresso I had. \n\nI love this place.

Bike parking/rack is accessible at the entrance too. It's open and the roaster is full on display for people to watch while they enjoy their coffee. The coffee bar is smack dabbed in the middle of the floor equipped with different brewing stations. \n\nThere's also a loft space upstairs that gives a good view of the bottom floor work. Perfect for people to take pictures of their latte art with a cool background hehe. It's pretty hipstery. It can get really hot up there though, which is probably why they have their affogato bar up there as well. Still cool though, hehe.\n\nCustomer service: good baristas with good attitudes. The cashier could chat you up a good time, but can also keep it short if you just need a quick coffee pick up.\n\nDrinks: my goodness the drinks are amazing. I enjoy a good espresso and their selection is well polished for the customers. I put a picture of the menu with this review. It is a bit pricier than other specialty coffee places, but it is in SF.\n\nPRO TIP: they make their iced coffee Japanese style cold brewed (this is different from their vanilla cold brew offering). I highly recommend this especially on a hot day. It's bright and accentuates the floral flavors of the coffee better. The more floral and sweet notes on the coffee, the better. \n\nOverall, good atmosphere with good coffee selections. It's coffee is roasted with care and right in front of you.

There was this guy who came by the communal bar where I was sitting upstairs and asked if the seat with my bag on it was taken and I said yeah and he asked the guy to my left then said to me \"I'm not just f*ing around, I have work to do!\" Then I left and found another table and he came later and took the chair next to me that had a back.

Just kidding - this would have been my sixth time here, and sixth time having Sightglass.\n\nI usually come here with my bestie to grab coffee while we're in the city during the day. Long story, short, today was different as I was awake at an unusual time for myself (5:30AM). I decided that Sightglass coffee was the only coffee that would give me the kick I needed to drive my butt back to Sactown. \n\n7:00AM. I pick up my car from the hotel valet and cruise my way down from Union Square to 7th street. It's quiet and the sun is barely rising. I park and walk in to order my usual: caffe latte. \n\nI'm still half dead from waking up so early, so I didn't pay too much attention to the cashier when he asked me for my order. I just said, \"One latte to go please.\"\nBarista/cashier: Ok, that'll be $7.25.\nMe: *hands $10.25* *receives $3*\n-pause-\nBarista/cashier: *hands over something in a bag*\n-pause-\nMe: Hey... did the price of your latte just go up? Wasn't it like, $4 or something?\nBarista/cashier: I'm sorry?\nMe: Oh, it's just that you said it was $7.25... that's a bit...\nBarista/cashier: I'm so sorry! I thought you said you wanted a croissant!\nMe: Oh, no worries! I just wanted a latte; don't really want anything to eat right now.\nBarista/cashier: I'll get it done for you. I'm so sorry about that!\n\nHe takes the croissant in the bag back and begins to place my order in. After waiting for a couple minutes, another barista calls out my name for my order. Nicely done & well presented again! I wouldn't expect any less from Sightglass.\n\nAs I take my latte over to the other counter with the lids, the barista/cashier gentleman called me in a quiet and apologetic voice. He hands me a shot of cold brew mixed with vanilla(?) and apologizes profusely. He really didn't have to! I totally get it - it's early in the morning and things happen! It could've been me not enunciating my order well, so I'm sorry about that! \n\nTo the barista/cashier that was helping me today at like 7:10AM - THANK YOU for making my morning! Now that I've tried your cold brew, I'm looking forward to my next visit in the city! \n\nTL;DR What's good here?\n(+) Coffee - strong, smooth yet bold flavor\n(+) Atmosphere - quiet & hipster\n(+) Interior - so nice, roomy and I love the display of machines & coffee around! & lots of seating!\n(+) Service - see the entire paragraph above; the staff here go above and beyond your expectations! You all are wonderful!\n(-) Why aren't you anywhere else except for SF? Please come to LA/OC!", "author": "Nicole Q."}

A warehouse-turned coffee shop, the place feels really open with the high ceilings and mezzanine level seating. The coffee and pastries are amazing, but let's talk about the affogato bar for a second. \n\nYes. An affogato bar. When I saw the Eater.com article about Salt & Straw and Sightglass' new partnership, I knew immediately that I had to see it for myself because it was just too good to be true. Featuring unique ice cream flavors (some fancy chocolate I forgot the name of, blood orange and olive oil, and sea salt with caramel ribbons) and three different types of espresso, you can mix and match to create an affogato or cold brew float that best suits your taste buds. I honestly came in wanting some classic vanilla ice cream smothered with espresso, but I appreciate that they're trying to do something different. \n\nI ended up sharing a sea salt with caramel ribbons affogato with I think the Rwanda espresso(?) and a blood orange float with a friend, and both were amazing. I ended up liking the float better because the sea salt affogato was really heavy, but definitely worth trying in my opinion. \n\nI love that Sightglass is evolving as the coffee trend grows. I can't wait to see what they come up with next and what other coffee shops do to follow suit!", "author": "Sabrina C."}

Didn't get to check out upstairs but there were people up there literally just chillen. \n\nLove their pastry selection. So many to choose from. I had the Pistachio blackberry croissant and man it was good! It buttery flakey and it was moist in the inside. The sweetness was just perfect.

The latte and caps are well made using their signature espresso beans.   I really like their espresso beans, its slightly dark with hints of chocolate and bourbon.\n\nThe decor is very rustic, plenty of seats and lounge areas to chat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-16", "description": "Sightglass is probably one of my favorite coffee shops here in SF. I've been here many times whenever I am in San Francisco. I used to consider myself as a coffee snob (because I would go to different coffee shops almost weekly) but I guess I still don't know all that much about coffee. But I want to say I know a lot compared to before. \n\nIf this is your first time here (or if it's your first time at this type of coffee shops), then you might not exactly know how to feel since the coffee you usually drink (maybe from like Starbucks) is more likely to be Peets or Starbucks. I guess coffee is an art and this type of coffee will grow on you a little more every time you take a sip. \n\nBut that's besides the point. I really like Sightglass for both the coffee and the location. The coffee shop is huge and very spacious. Most other coffee shops in SF tend to be a little smaller because of space constraints. But this is definitely a great spot! Parking is also pretty convenient. I never had trouble finding a spot and I usually park across the street. \n\nOnto the coffee, I get the latt\u00e9 at every coffee shop so I can compare with the places I've been to. I love their latt\u00e9 though! It's so delicious. I guess you have to acquire the taste because I used to think it was too bitter. But in a good way. It has that bitter taste but you can also taste the beans that were used in the process of making it. It's pretty smooth and I enjoy it a lot. It's never too sweet or anything. The milk and coffee are nicely balanced. I have had their cappuccino as well but I am not very fond of cappuccino in general, so I'm a little biased.\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoy my SF day trips a little better with a Sightglass coffee in hand. I love the atmosphere here. It's a nice place to catch up with friends, get some work done, and also watching them roast the beans while you're sipping on your coffee! Definitely worth making a trip to Sightglass!", "author": "Wendy Y."}

Perhaps not but he certainly gave me small-mouth with a definite shrug on my last couple of visits here. And it makes me truly melancholy that the architectural beauty of a place can camouflage the indifference of a staff who really didn't care when I got my coffee. Gee, I remember when Sightglass Coffee opened over three years ago as a temporary stand next to a warehouse in the middle of its massive construction into an artisan roastery.\n\nThe young woman back then was charming and made quality coffee using a Chemex hourglass. It was nice just to sit casually on the nearby bench and chat with her when it wasn't busy. Well, the renovation is complete, and the result is a cavernous, industrial-chic place with stools lining a wooden counter that faces 7th Street and a mezzanine that accommodates about thirty laptoppers. All signs point to a great place for cross-generational socializing, but the hipster quotient is on high octane here. Ill-mannered behavior like cutting in line is pervasive.\n\nThese young, self-absorbed customers - usually dressed in pea coats and patterned scarves - are staring intently into their mobile devices and ignoring any sense of etiquette that have likely preceded them by a generation. What saddens me more is how the staff carries the same attitude - an unsmiling indifference to the possible diversity of their customer base. Instead, fellow hipsters are favored over decided non-hipsters like me who wear discount shirts from the Van Heusen outlet and happen to be carrying a bottle of Drano and a drain snake purchased at Speedy's nearby. How uncool.\n\nI guess neither the order taker nor the barista felt a need to clarify to me that I had to wait for my handmade coffee on the side of the counter opposite the industrial-strength GS2 espresso machine. Upon that news uttered in a ho-hum monotone, I immediately walked around the large oval counter to find my $4 cup of Rwandan coffee uncovered and lukewarm. There was no need for me to stay since no one felt a need to make me feel welcome. Those high school feelings of rejection never go away, do they?\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...betting the rich flavor of the Rwandan blend was great when it was hot\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...striking industrial-loft decor is hard not to admire even if seating is at a premium\nSERVICE - 1 star...a lonely star they should wear on their lapels\nTOTAL - 2 stars...sad to downgrade as I think the Morrison brothers have a great concept, but treating all customers with equal respect would be better to me than the discovery of another exotic coffee bean", "author": "Ed U."}

A journey of self-exploration cast as a religious rite of passage. Mecca. Lourdes. A Shinto shrine on a snow-capped mountaintop. A Bhutanese Buddhist temple. A sacred native American hot springs, redwood grove, or steaming volcanic crater. That sort of thing.\n\nWell, that's what an 8 am visit to Sightglass in SoMa is like. It's clearly a working roastery, with the vintage Probat spinning in endless cycles as fresh beans get turned into little gems of caffeine-laced magic. The space is cavernous, with an almost cathedral-like feel to the soaring ceiling and natural light pouring through ample glass panels. You very nearly feel like there should be basins of holy water at the entrance to anoint yourself so that you are worthy of the ritual that is to come. I had to fight the urge not to remove my shoes once I crossed the threshold and approached the counter to order my first coffee of the morning.\n\nThe single-origin bags beckon on the right-hand side, simple brown packaging containing a wealth of beans from Latin America, Africa, and the Pacific. The espresso stand churns out almond-milk lattes, near-perfect macchiatos, and caps and cortados and double shots and all the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, the staffers sip, roast, pour, and move from station to station like monks or nuns or sufi mystics or high priests or shamans. You almost can hear the mantras being repeated as the silence of the place starts to overwhelm you.\n\nBut it's just coffee, right?\n\nNo, I think not. If it were, we'd all be ordering vacuum-packed beans on-line and making macchiatos in the privacy of our own homes. Or getting our coffee beans from Trader Joe's. But it's not 1995 anymore. \n\nAnd clearly we don't all live in San Francisco, as appealing a prospect as that sounds. And sometimes we do want to Blue Bottle, or Ritual, or Four Barrel, or Verve, or go slumming at a local Starbucks or Peets (as long as we don't meet anyone we know). I've even Philzed a few times in my life - although I'm not proud of it! \n\nSo that's why we don our pilgrimage cloak, grab our reusable shopping bag, wake up before dawn, and head to places like Sightglass.\n\nFor the coffee and the beans and the Hario #2 pour-over filters, of course.\n\nBut also for the utterly unique experience of being at that singular place of origin where the Probat turns, the beans empty into bins, the light shines, and the reclaimed wood countertops beckon. \n\nPilgrimage sites. The twitter-friendly face of an ancient human practice, as old as religion itself. Just with better espresso.\n\nIs it an addiction - or just extreme religious devotion? Who are we mere mortals to decide such things, anyway? He who is without sin can judge the relative merits of the third-wave coffee pilgrimage. For the rest of us, there is always the next Sightglass out there on the edges of the known coffee world - if we are adventurous enough to get out of our comfort zones and to go and find it.\n\n(Amen).", "author": "Bradley N."}

However, Sightless deserves every star because they meticulously source coffee from the best growers and deliver drips of gold to my cup. Bean quality and flavor begin to degrade once the coffee is roasted. After a week or two, roasted beans loose a significant amount of flavors. Coffee beans are roasted daily right here on seventh, which means the beans still have maximum flavors. You can select from a couple single origins, or bulk brewed coffee if you are in a hurry. An Ethiopian single origin drip is my default, and of course, highly recommended.\n\nLet's not forget the espresso, which requires good beans and barista talent. Sightless has consistently delivered a delicious macchiato or cappuccino. (Pro tip: macchiato is a great compliment to a drip.)\n\nLooking for a mid-day dessert coffee? Skip the register and proceed upstairs to the Affogato Bar. (Affogatto is espresso poured over ice cream.)

I thought it was fine, but I'm really not so crazy about coffee and can't distinguish between different coffee shops' lattes.\n\nBut again the space is absolutely gorgeous: high ceilinged with large windows (so much sunlight streaming in!), airy, and finished with warm yellow woods and bright glass. It was such a lovely place to get work done. Minus a star for the lack of free wi-fi (2013 in San Francisco? Free wi-fi is pretty much an unalienable right) as I imagine the majority of people trying to crank work out would need it.

It has great tables for doing work (library style, upstairs) but no wifi, not even a single outlet.

The architecture of this building is incredible! It is huge, extremely spacious, bright, open and rustic. You'll find lots of people on laptops, reading a book or just chatting with a friend. I met a friend of mine here in the afternoon to enjoy a \"get away from work\" cup of coffee. \n\nThe service was great from the start. The cashier was very friendly and talkative. Almost too much - because he talked and talked after taking one of our orders and once we finally got the second order in a couple others had been made with a different cashier resulting in us getting our coffees about 5-10 minutes apart. But oh well! We are easy going. \n\nBoth of us ordered the Mocha which I found to not taste much like chocolate at all. It had chocolate notes like when you get the Jacob's at Philz or something, but not a mocha. I enjoyed the coffee and drank the entire thing but couldn't help but wonder if I was given the wrong one the entire time. It will remain a mystery! But overall I enjoyed the place and would give it another shot.", "author": "Mandy A."}

Right up there with Ritual or Blue Bottle among others. Between a combination of their award winning* roasts, as well as their unique open architecture, they all come highly recommended whenever I read a \"best of SF\" article. \n\nA recent excursion to the Green Festival brought my sweetie and me here as it was the only coffee shop open within reasonable distance on a Sunday evening\n\nMy first taste of Sightglass beans was from my favorite cafe, Timeless Coffee in Oakland http://www.yelp.com/biz/timeless-coffee-oakland who were using Sightglass roasted coffee until they recently purchased their own roaster. Since Timeless became my favorite coffee shop, I bookmarked Sightglass to see if it's the roaster or the barista that makes the coffee what it is. \n\nWe placed our order for a french press coffee and a soy latte. Since they seem to be following the increasingly annoying hipster trend of serving almond over soy milk, we ended up with an almond milk latte instead. Almond milk is very finicky to work with and rarely if ever tastes great when foamed. It overpowers the espresso so all you really taste is the almond milk which usually has a bitter flavor if you're not used to it. Since they only serve almond milk, I can't really say how the espresso really tasted because I didn't like my drink.\n\nSince they don't serve V3gan desserts here, we snuck in some delicious Angel Cakes http://www.yelp.com/biz/angel-cakes-custom-cupcakes-berkeley cupcakes that made the coffee experience much more palatable.\n\nDespite the unique architecture, I don't see myself ever going here again unless they start serving soy or heck, even coconut milk which doesn't froth as well but at least you can still taste the espresso underneath the subtle coconut flavor.\n\n*No awards have actually been verified.

And while I enjoy coffees in all shapes and sizes, I'll be venturing out looking for the best cold brews.\n\nSight Glass's take on cold brew features vanilla. You are given an option of regular or almond milk, so I chose to get mine with the almond milk (I usually drink it black). Really damn good cup of coffee; the vanilla flavor wasn't overly sweet or very syrupy, and the almond milk was a nice compliment. Coffee was robust in flavor and not acidic (I find that a sour flavor of cold brew does not mix well with sugar) so that was a plus. \n\nMy cousin ordered a latte, and my Dad had an Ethiopia pour over. I didn't have any sips of either, but they both enjoyed their drinks and had no complaints. \n\nInterior is spacious and the vibe was comforting. There are two floors so you can head upstairs and check out the baristas while you sip on your cup of Joe. \n\nWill definitely be back!", "author": "Christopher N."}

Maybe due to the on-sight roasting making the coffee fresher.\n\nOn par with Blue Bottle, Verve, etc. although I like Verve best.\n\nMy main gripe about this place is that it's a bit of a trek to get to from Civic Center Bart and having to walk through some of the sketchy neighborhoods.", "author": "Norman S."}

With that said, some of my more refined coffee-lover friends greatly appreciate this place too. \n\nI always get the Vanilla Iced Cold Brew. It's the most refreshing coffee I've ever had. Perfect mix of the milk and coffee. I normally get almond milk with it! It's light with a hint of sweetness. Pretty much a go-to right after my work-out. It's about time for me to try some of their other drinks though. That's what I keep telling myself but the vanilla iced cold brew is just too good to not get whenever I'm there. \n\nOh, and guess what. They sell Neighbor Bakehouse pastries here!!!

Sightglass not only is a cute coffee shop but they also make good coffee and baked goods.  I was in the area visiting my friend at her office when I opened yelp to find a nearby coffee shop.  Lo and behold, Sightglass Coffee (one of the shops I bookmarked while planning my trip) happened to be around the corner.  Score!  I ordered the \"Hooker Mocha\" which when ordering felt a little funny to say along with the bacon, cheddar, and scallion scone.  I really liked the mocha (with almond milk) since typical mochas are very sweet whereas this one was not.  It was creamy but like everyone else said, it doesn't taste like the mocha you are typically accustomed to.  You don't really taste a strong sweet, chocolatey flavor but moreso a cocoa powder/dark chocolate taste.  Some people may not like that but I did since I wasn't in the mood for anything sugary.  The only downside was the drink was pretty pricey, $5, for maybe a 12 oz cup.  I know their beans are good quality but it was still a steep price to pay in my opinion.  The bacon scone was pretty tasty; it was flaky and substantial and I would recommend trying it!  Definitely check out Sightglass to grab a cup of good coffee or purchase some beans from around the world!", "author": "Melissa A."}

When I learned that my company's SF office was 5 blocks away from Sightglass I decided that'd be a perfect place to run off and grab a coffee. Well run I did, because breaks can only be so long and damn a SF block is big.\n\nANYHOW. I hail from Kansas City, and my favorite coffee shop of all time recently served Sightglass Coffee as a guest roaster. I'm a new convert to single origin roasts and pour-overs and all that good stuff, and knew that I wanted to try them out from their mothership. It was a thoroughly impressive experience, and even though it came with a surprise side of cardio, I'm glad that I did. \n\nSightglass Coffee is gorgeous. The space is massive and airy, with a ton of natural light. Everything is made of contreet, metal or wood, a very elemental and minimalist look that I can appreciate. There is a massive coffee bar in the middle of the first floor, but most of the space seems dedicated to their roasting operation. There's also a nice retail space that I'd recommend perusing. I opted to drink my coffee and work from upstairs at one of the utilitarian communal tables. Maybe I was just intoxicated by SF in general, It was an inspiring environment. I enjoyed being surrounded by other people that I assumed were working on awesome techy or artsy projects. I'd work here in a heartbeat.\n\nOf course, none of this would matter if the coffee was bad. Thankfully, it's incredible! The aromas are strong and the flavors are pure and unmuddled. I gladly finished my cup and before I left bought a few bags of beans for myself and some friends. I mean, how else can I assure that I can get coffee this good before my next return visit to SF?", "author": "Matt E."}

I don't think I tasted any other coffee with such a bold sweet flavor. I also tried the chocolate ice-cream vanilla iced brew coffee soda float but I don't think i like the taste of sparkling soda with coffee.

The coffee of course was delicious and very powerful, as all these trendy places are.

It is undeniably gorgeous in there, though, with high ceilings and lots of natural light. \n\nI also liked that they used Square - always a plus in my book as an emailed receipt means I won't ever lose it. \n\nAll in all one of my top choices for coffee drinking, if not for coffee shop hanging-out!", "author": "Christina P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-12", "description": "Sightglass is easily becoming one of my favorites coffee shops (sorry Blue Bottle, Rituals, Philz and Four Barrels).  This place, along with their 20th location feels like the holy grail of coffee shops.  Lately, I have been finding myself walking four or five blocks from the Mid-Market to enjoy their fine coffees and soap (more on this below).\n\nThe positives:\n\n-Beautiful architecture.  Converted warehouse into a two level coffee shop.  \n\n-They have Aesop soap and fancy paper towels.You know that feeling you get when you are at the occasional fancy dinner( Gary Danko, Spruce, La Folie).  You go to the restroom, and they have extremely thick paper towels to dry your hands with?  You don't even want to throw the paper towel away because it feels so valuable.  Like maybe there can be another use for this little guy, before it has to kick the can forever. Anyways, it adds a certain touch to the finished product, which in this case is coffee. I looked up the price of this soap, as I fell in love with the scents. It is not cheap ladies and gentlemen.  $50 for a bottle of soap. So tons of respect to Sightglass for letting my hands feel fancy!  \n\n-The coffee is almost always delicious.  Tip:  You really have to let your black coffee sit for at least 5 minutes before you can actually enjoy the flavor notes that each particular coffee bean produces.  This is a tip for enjoying coffee at any coffee establishment, roaster or not.\n\nA couple of negatives:\n\nThere cheapest pour over coffee is usually $4.25.  I respect the premium coffee, but I would strongly recommend one for under $4.  Maybe instead of having two different drip  coffee make three?  I learned in economics class, that there is a price elasticity.  The point where the certain price for something, affects the demand.  I guess my price elasticity point for pour over coffee, would be above $4.  If it was below, I probably would enjoy it much more often. Most of the other coffee roasters in town offer such a price.  Highly recommend doing this.\n\nStart making cold brew!  Even if in small batch, it is definitely worth it.  I once tried there iced coffee, and it was really not good.  They spend  the time and energy making through a pour over method, not their standard \"quick cup\", and then they put ice.  VOIL\u00c0, your iced coffee is ready! Not. Every real coffee lover knows, that if you simply put ice over hot coffee, it kills the flavor notes. It is the cheap way of making iced coffee.  Please, make cold brew instead.", "author": "Hanna A."}

Thankfully I was able to find the best [not so] hidden gem in the district: Sightglass! They must have the best beans in the business because every time I get a latte it tastes perfect, despite the number of different baristas they have. They use the nicest professional-grade espresso machines and their work area is always immaculate. They also have some of the best pastries ever made, most notably the berry/pistachio croissants (get them early or they'll be gone by about noon!). They also have a great selection of seating, from window seats on the ground floor (perfect for people-watching), to long bars/stools and large tables upstairs, perfect for impromptu meetings or just working on whatever you want on your laptop or tablet.\n\nOh and they have super secure bike parking in the entryway.

Everything about you, from the atmosphere to the baristas to the coffee bean quality, is amazing. You are no Starbucks. You are no Peet's Coffee. You are no Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. You are none of those. You are very different and you are better. You are truly special and unique and the effort and love for what your baristas do really shows and shines through. Thank you for doing what you love and making your customers smile.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJacquie H.\n\nMy letter truly sums it all up. It sums up the experience and how I feel about Sightglass. \n\nHere's what I ordered:\n\nOne size. \n\nLATTE ($4): I love this because it was creamy and they had great temperature control since it was not cold or scalding. Not at all bitter.\n\nESPRESSO ($3): Light and quite refreshing. No acidity detected. Once again, great temperature control.\n\nCAPPUCCINO ($3.5): Not bitter in the least sense and has great depth.\n\nSERVICE: They were very prompt in getting our drinks out. They really love what they do and it really shows in the quality of the coffee. \n\nDECOR: Loving this space. I don't know but something about it seems magical and makes for a greater experience. The crates filled with coffee beans, the shelves filled with their own roasted coffee beans, the machinery to roast and prep the beans, the two story seating area, and even the windows that let in natural light have that modern and rustic feel that adds to the experience as a whole and makes it just that much better.\n\nWill I return? Yes but only if I'm in the area. As much as I love Sightglass and they are currently my favorite place for coffee (yes, I admire it more than Four Barrel and Verve), I am still not an avid coffee drinker unlike my folks. Verve is sometimes a bit too bitter and needs to work on temperature control and Four Barrel is roast and has excellent depth.

Verve, Blue Bottle, Ritual, Four Barrel, Barefoot, Linea and beyond ie. Stumptown, Victrola, Madcap, Dogwood, Counter Culture, Intelligentsia, I set my sights on the Sightglass flagship location.  And what a sight it is, with a giant skylight and their roasting and bagging facility right in the center of the space.  \n\nThere was some unpleasantness, however.  Some douchebag cut to the front of the line, and then the barista nearly served someone behind me when I had been standing at the counter for a couple minutes.  I've experienced that sort of thing at Shilin Night Market trying to order from a stinky tofu stand.  The clientele is more of the brogrammer/tech industry-types rather than the hipsters you get at Ritual and Four Barrel.  Then there were no tables available either downstairs or upstairs at 2pm.  If the coffee had delivered a memorable taste, all would be forgotten. \n\nI had tried a bag of their Indonesian drip coffee in the past and found it to be a meek version of a bright Stumptown.  This time, I was in the mood to try their mocha.  I wasn't able to ask the barista which espresso blend they used, but I could barely taste it through the nearly flavorless chocolate and very flat steamed milk.  I'm used to drinking my espresso shots from a 20g portafilter basket.  I suspect they prepared my mocha with about half of that amount or twice as much milk.  Everything about it just tasted weak.\n\nI may revisit at some point to sample more of their drip coffee, but honestly I could have made a more flavorful mocha at my office using our standard Dogwood Neon Espresso and melted Tcho chocolate nibs.  I'd be happy to revisit my review should the next visit be a more positive experience.", "author": "Danny K."}

This converted warehouse coffee shop has a perfect blend of space, light and hipster artistry that makes it a wonderful place to spend the afternoon working or with a good book.\n\nA great touch is the fact that the day-to-day operations of Sightglass are closely integrated into their shop. On one side of the first floor you can watch as employees pack bags of coffee beans, while on the other side a gigantic roaster sifts and cools pound after pound of coffee bean. Upstairs there is a sectioned off work area where Sightglass employees are doing who-knows-what.

I have literally never seen a more beautiful modern coffee shop in my life. But there's not much you can do with it. You  can't really socialize, you can't work, you can't even drink your coffee comfortably. Because of its structure, the space traps hot air and it's unbearable for any prolonged period of time (especially upstairs where all the hot air stagnates). If you're lucky enough to actually get a seat, you'll feel like you are drinking a hot latte in a sauna. \n\nThey also don't have wifi or any outlets, my guess this is intended to discourage you from staying too long.

Bah voil\u00e0, c'est \u00e0 San Francisco, dans le quartier industriel gentrifiant de SoMa !  Pour la parenth\u00e8se, SoMa, c'est l'acronyme trendy pour South Market, ou devrais-je dire l'invention des d\u00e9veloppeurs immobiliers pour donner un c\u00f4t\u00e9 super appealing \u00e0 un quartier qui ne l'\u00e9tait pas autrefois. \"Vous voulez visiter notre loft pour artiste \u00e0 1 million de dollars dans SoMa ?\" \"SoMa c'est quoi \u00e7a ?\" \"Beh South Market, enfin voyons, le quartier o\u00f9 tout le monde veut \u00eatre\". NY a SoHo, NoHo, NoLita, TriBeCa, BoCoCa,... bah SF a d\u00e9sormais SoMa.  Si vous d\u00e9ambulez dans ce quartier o\u00f9 vous risquez bien de ne croiser d\u00e9sormais que barbus tatou\u00e9s sur v\u00e9lo vintage \u00e0 pignon fixe, d\u00e9veloppeurs geeks avec un t-shirt Sonic ou designers trendy-grunge qui errent en attendant le prochain vernissage d'une gallerie d'art planqu\u00e9e entre deux entrep\u00f4ts vides, un passage \u00e0 SightGlass s'impose absolument, que vous aimiez la caf\u00e9 ou pas, c'est une obligation !  Tout simplement parce que le lieu est absolument magnifique et r\u00e9ellement impressionnant. D\u00e9j\u00e0 rien qu'en arrivant devant, les larges baies vitr\u00e9es avec laptopeurs sur tabourets apparents de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 et le sas d'entr\u00e9e avec v\u00e9los accroch\u00e9s aux murs donnent le ton. Ca va \u00eatre assez hipster...  Ensuite, on entre et on se prend direct l'\u00e9norme machine de torr\u00e9faction, dans le champ de vision, entour\u00e9e de sacs de grains verts, de torr\u00e9facteurs \u00e0 l'oeuvre et de chaises hautes qui l'entourent, au cas o\u00f9 vous voudriez vous y asseoir pour admirer le travail. Le d\u00e9cor est plant\u00e9 : on sait o\u00f9 on est !  On d\u00e9couvre alors le reste de l'espace : un immense entrep\u00f4t, aux tr\u00e8s hauts plafonds, compl\u00e8tement transform\u00e9, mais qui a su garder l'esprit d'origine, tout en faisant la part belle au bois et au m\u00e9tal, et en atteignant ainsi un parfait \u00e9quilibre entre atelier de torr\u00e9faction et coffee shop o\u00f9 l'on vient prendre sa fika californienne. (Sa fikalifornienne ?). Cosy et urbain \u00e0 la fois. Un vrai tour de force en termes de design et d'ambiance.  Le coffee bar central circulaire est ergonomique, le service ultra friendly, les baristas connaissent leur job, et les p\u00e2tisseries sont au top, d\u00e9livr\u00e9es par quelques artisans locaux s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s avec soin. Le kouign-amman et le croissant aux pistaches sont juste parfaits. Mais les muffins ne sont pas en reste non plus.  Vous pourrez ensuite siroter votre petit noir (ou votre gros latte) \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage-mezzanine, sur l'une des tables communes ou \"au balcon\" afin d'avoir une vue plongeante sur le b\u00e2timent. Cette deuxi\u00e8me option est largement recommand\u00e9e vu le caract\u00e8re exceptionnel du lieu. Autant vous impr\u00e9gner de l'esprit et de l'espace...  Seul b\u00e9mol : pas de wifi. Nouvelle trend r\u00e9pandue \u00e0 San Francisco. Officiellement pour que les gens socialisent. Officieusement sans doute pour que vous ne passiez pas l\u00e0 4h sur votre laptop avec un espresso.   De passage \u00e0 San Francisco, bien s\u00fbr il y a le Golden Gate, les tramways, Nob Hill,...  Mais question visites, SightGlass devrait \u00e9galement \u00eatre sur la liste. Parce qu'il faut profiter de l'occasion pour voir ce qui peut se faire en termes de transformation d'espace, de r\u00e9appropriation de lieux abandonn\u00e9s, de revitalisation de quartiers industriels... Et de coffee shops hallucinants, tout simplement.", "author": "Xavier P."}

All I want is a good cup of coffee, great service, and a place to sit down. This place delivers a mediocre stance on all but one count. \n \nThe first thing I felt when entering Sightglass was that I didn't belong. Upon entering the door, there were bikes beautifully hanging against the wall and when you enter the building, it has an industrial look. There are two floors, filled to the brim with a bunch of cool looking folks - which I am not. It looked like a movie scene, no joke, it didn't seem real to me.\n \nI shook my feelings aside and proceeded to buy my boyfriend, his friend, and myself a few cups of coffee. The server was very quip, didn't find my light/ humorous nature appealing, and wasn't very welcoming. I don't blame him, this was probably what their clientele wants. So I paid and said, \"thank you\" and he just looked at me, giving me that look that he was done with me.\n \nCool. I move on and continued my conversation with my boyfriend's friend. The barista looked (apparently no talking is allowed at this joint, they've got specific stare downs on lock) at us to inform us our drinks were ready. I like the thoughtfulness nature of adding a cup of water on the side for espresso orders but my coffee was less than memorable.\n \nWe proceeded to go upstairs to drink our drinks and carry a conversation. That is one thing this place excels, room to talk and sit. The big tables are on rollers and you can sit by the railing to look at the peons below (sarcasm font).\n \nOverall - I felt that this place is average, in my book. It made me miss my own coffee shop, which doesn't exude pretentiousness. My coffee shop is where the owner knows you, the baristas are nothing but warm and cheerful, and the coffee is delicious. Home is where the heart is.", "author": "Elsvette B."}

True to it's description, the coffee was fruity and unlike most coffees, was roasted so there was no sense of coffee \"bitterness\" at the end.  The bean was not at all oily, and really after drinking a cup, I found that i could smell the fruity aroma pretty much for the rest of the day.  Coffee perfume? check.  No Starbucks \"baristas\" here.  The folks clearly know how to brew a cup of coffee.  The staff weren't snobs about it either - they were quite nice.  \n\nAlthough the industrial decor and randomness of the seating/standing areas might leave you wandering the first time you are here, I think it's rather intentional - milling about was rather.... encouraged.

I didn't like it and probably won't be back.  The guy who took my order was very nice, the coffee tasted good, and they have bike parking in the foyer, those were the good things.  It was also very clean.\n\nI ordered an iced decaf, which cost $4.35 (seems like a lot for simple coffee), they didn't have simple syrup, and only had one unlabeled dairy creamer out that I think gave me a pretty harsh stomach ache later.  The coffee tasted good, and it's all hand poured right there, so I guess it's pretty hip and minimalist and that's what people like?  \n\nIf you don't mind waiting 10 minutes or more for your coffee to be hand poured, and you don't need wifi (they don't have it), and you don't need an outlet to plug anything into (the guy next to me said the staff said there weren't any at all), then maybe this place will be fine for you, but I was very disappointed.  \n\nIt was also very loud in there, but I was there at about 4:00 so maybe that's a busy time (that beautiful ambiance everyone swoons over in these reviews is not the best for dimming sounds, and just a sidenote from my professional perspective, those sandblasted virgin wood beams are not an environmentally friendly design choice).

Or because it smells like heaven since they roast their beans out in the open. Or because it is probably the most photogenic coffee shop in San Francisco.\n\nPROs: The cappuccino is delicious in its own right (no sugar needed), and the pour-over coffee will have you turning into a coffee snob. If I just want to go somewhere and drink coffee in an actual mug, I stop in for a \"quick cup\", which is also flavorful enough to drink sans cream and sugar. The iced coffee is served in jar and really good with almond milk, too - though I can't get over how good the espresso tastes, so I usually still go cappuccino.\n\nCONs: Many would consider it a con that there is no wifi. That's a choice they made, probably to make it more of a social place. Also, it is a bit more expensive (seems deserved), and it sure can take a long time to get your drink if it's anything but a \"quick cup.\" Don't go here if you are in a rush. I want to say the longest I've waited is 20 minutes, which seemed pretty long for an outlier - but no customers seem to mind. I guess it's understood that they make their drinks in a precise, time-intensive way... so you do get quality for the wait.

I am also mesmerized (no matter how many times I've seen it) by the giant coffee bean roaster that runs while you enjoy your coffee/meal or wait in line. This could just be the coffee nerd in me, but I appreciate this reminder that Sightglass roasts the beans they use to make your coffee in-house and love the opportunity to get to see the process happen.\n\nThat being said, their coffee is always fresh, fresh, fresh. My usual order is a \"quick cup\" (aka \"drip\" coffee that is already prepared and ready to be poured, rather than selecting a \"brewed coffee\" from their rotating menu and having it prepared fresh in the pour-over fashion). I enjoy the simplicity of their menu, void of any coffee-tainting sugary syrups, caramels, chocolate curls, etc. Again, it could just be the nerd in me that enjoys just a straight-up cup of coffee without all the frills and bows. One \"quick cup\" keeps me going all day; it's a strong as it is fresh! Huuuuuuge plus that they don't charge a debit fee! So rare in the City!\n\nMy only reason for not giving this place 5 stars is the \"holier than thou\" attitude that exudes from most of their super hip baristas. I always ask if I can top my coffee off with some cold almond milk, but 8 times out of 10 I am completely ignored by the barista for a good 3-4 minutes. Not even a look in my direction. Having been a barista before, I totally understand how busy it gets (especially for the person on bar), but I also understand how annoying a \"hoverer\" can be at the handoff station. Don't make me be that guy, I don't want to be that guy!! Of course, there are a select few baristas who remember me and are kind enough to hand me the almond milk, no questions asked, or a couple who I've had nice chit chat with. But the majority are clearly too cool for little old me. \n\nOverall, I definitely don't mind a but of 'tude in exchange for an excellent cup of coffee.", "author": "Michelle P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-17", "description": "Through that big tall glass window I saw a man in a blue checkered dress shirt and jeans, with his dark rim glasses, hurriedly walking in. He was the man I was waiting for. For the first time we've known each other, I was early. I turned my attention back to a half constructed email as he pushed the door open, and soon I sensed his arrival, as he gently tapped on my hand that was holding the smart phone. \"Hi\". He said. I stopped my emailing and handed him a bag filled with pickled herrings in plastic containers and some home made pumpkin bar with chestnut cream. I informed him that I had ordered Non Fat Cappuccino (NFC). They don't do non fat. So almond milk instead. NFC came with same design as the last time I was here. The barista poured a perfect heart on the top of the foam. The man ordered a drip decaf. Said that he would be up all night if he drank caffeinated drink. I would not know that. I did not meet him for coffee much, though that thought had crossed my mind many times over.\n\nWe waited for the coffee to drip and caught up. He complimented my new look. \"You are making a lot of changes.\" He said. My mind was somewhere else that day so I said nothing until he said, \"You are not even looking at me.\" I was caught off guard by that comment so I raised my eyes to meet his. I was disturbed by his comment and wanted to know why he was so testy, but just then the decaf drink was ready. He kept his black and bitter. I liked mine foamy and sweet.\n\nI had sent photos I'd taken of this place earlier to this man. In my note I said, \"I like the upstairs.\" So he led me to upstairs. The building itself was airy. It was nice to sit on the bar stools and look down and watch others ordering and making drinks. You could see the office and the roasting facility from where we sat. It had more space than needed, which made this place a little out of place in an increasingly expensive neighborhood, but it also made this place inviting. Conceivably one could spread out on that giant farm table next to us and have a review of a recently drawn architectural blueprint for a house remodeling project.\n\n\"You've changed. I have not. And I feel that you are expecting me to change. \" Man had pointed out that my external appearance had changed, which was an indication that I had made internal changes as well. I had not. I liked to make physical changes to spruce things up, because staying constant would be boring and uninspiring. Man thought the problem was that I had expected him to change with me. A carefully cultivated friendship whereby two people were on a balanced scale, afraid of the other tipping the scale. Now the man sensed a tipping was going to occur. \n\nI drank my drink.\n\nI first discovered espresso drinks made the proper way in Vienna. That was 14 years ago. Before Viennese coffee, I thought Italian espresso drinks were made for people on the go, drunk in a hurry in Rome, during lunch break. Not in Vienna, where cafes were filled with books and music. In France I could sit in a cafe drinking espresso drinks for hours on end while waited for the summer storm to pass. Here in SoMa, people took drinks swiftly as they discussed their latest product for their startups.  But not that day, not with that man, even though both of us worked in startups, and he was in fact working actively on a new product for his firm.\n\n\"You know what? I think drip coffee took too long.\" He all of sudden said. To this man everything was about saving time. He had little spare time to speak of. Everyone had to be slotted in. I was one of the slotted spots for the day.\n\n\"But,  did you taste the hint of chocolate? Or was it cherry today?\" I asked, while smiling. Sightglass was known for their flavor of the day.\n\n\"No, it's just bitter and dark.\" He said, decidedly.\n\n\"Then perhaps you should stick with instant coffee. Like the Kopi Lowak I got for you.\" Balinese coffee was finely ground and mellow, like how I was before.\n\nNot Sightglass. Sightglass coffee has intensity and personality. It's bold and unapologetic, like the version of me I'd like to evolve into some day; or, as the case may be, at least to this man, like the version I had already become.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Friendly staff - helpful, knowledgable, and accommodating. \nDaily drip is good - light roast, which is a bit to weak in flavor for me, however smooth. With light roasted beans, i found the Latte was weak, milk overpowered and diluted the flavor of the espresso. Overall, better than the coffee chains such as Starbucks, second cup, panera etc.", "author": "Jenna M."}

Before coming here i got dropped infront of the store but across the street and there wwre no signs on the outside of the building and had made a slight detour. Thank god to technolpgy these days with a smart phone and google maps. I dont know what i would do with out u google maps. They also have 2 bathrooms and a large sink outside the bathrooms. They also have a nice slection of totes and mug and tumblers for sale as well. \n\nSo i went in sight glass around 9am on a thursday and i mean there was a line out the door. Prolly about 6 pple ahead of me and the speed of the line went really quick speed. \n\nWhen it was my turn i went up to the cashier and say hi how are u and it was silent but a slight smirk, in my mind i was like u ride b!!!! Lol anyways ordered the owl howler latte and then proceeded to pay and it was 4.50. Then i asked if its sweetened or  very sweet since i dont like it too sweet i prefer less is what i told her and then she finally said a word \"no\" and shook her head. I was like okay. Yea i figure its the city and usually most people are cranky so yea i should know by now. Overall the wait I didnt think it was bad and then it took about 5 to 10 min wait til my drink came out and they hand out drinks on both side of the counter so beware and stay alert which counter they put it at. \n\nLets see when i got the cup, it was in a paper cup with black and white design with their logo on it. The owl howler latte is what i got and it was great at first sip and it milky and creamy and the coffee wasnt too strong in it. I mean espresso which they have 2 i believe. There is also a heart on the top of the drink and it made its presentation really nice. And the sweetness wasnt sweet at all or way bitter it was good and perfect to my taste. The cup didnt take long to finish since it wasnt too big. More like a tall or grande size from sb cups. Overall i liked it. \n\nNow the inside when you first enter they do all the packaging of the beans to be shipped or for customers who want certain beans to take home. Then the couter is an o shape and both side they serve drinks. In the very front of the curve o shape is where they\n Have 3 cashiers to take orders. Then the back of the o shape counter they have rooms for u to stand by the counter. Then in the very front of the store they have coffee roaster machine which is on and going and its cool. Then they have a fence around the machine area with countertops too and u can sit and enjoy ur cup and watch at the same time. They also have counter tops along the front of the store with tall glass windows to look outside the street which is busy and nothing like wow. Then they Also have an upstairs as well for u to sit and study or look down the coffee shop from the balcony indoors. Outside the entrance they have a bike rack for u to hang your bikes. They are not friendly with pets so u leave them outside. They\n have a nice sign outside the entrance.\n\nOverall the layout is nice and very spacious and the drink i had was good and no complaints. Next time im going to dry the ice cold vanilla coffee. Will be back soon. Hope you enjoyed my review and make sure to vote for me  happy yelping tata.", "author": "Alex T."}

My first stop was Peet's, because it was the closest and they have almond milk. However, the location inside Westfield Mall apparently does not. Yelp app to the rescue!\n\nI saw that Sightglass had (mostly) good reviews, so I hauled my butt a few blocks to their storefront. \n\nFirst of all, the interior is lovely. It has that refurbished warehouse feel, which adds to the snobby hipster factor. It is very clean and shiny, with wooden tables and chairs both upstairs and on the ground level. If you take a seat on the second floor, the view is incredible. I snapped a photo from the eagle's nest, but a barista turned around and looked *straight at me*, so I wisely decided to scrap it. \n\nThe cashier seemed a little befuddled by my order. I wanted an almond milk latte \"for here\", but their vegan spicy chewy cookie to-go. He put my cookie on a plate, and the barista made my beverage in a paper to-go cup. Not a big deal, except I was really having a seat and surfing the interwebs for a minute, so I felt guilty using the paper cup that I had to throw away afterwards. I'm slowly trying to become more eco-friendly, and this was a minor faux pas. I really need to invest in my own re-useable coffee thermos. I've been thinking about it for a long, long time, and I think it's finally time I take the plunge and purchase one. \n\nAs for the latte, it was eh, pretty decent. Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst. The spicy chocolate cookie (which I consumed later in the evening) was much better than the drink. I'm happy that they had a vegan sweet, but I didn't really care for my drink. Maybe the barista was having an off day, as I did hear them complaining about a huge rush earlier this morning. I guess Super Bowl fans wanted to get properly caffeinated to cheer on their team. \n\nThey were playing The Feelies on the loudspeaker, which I really enjoyed, but then they switched it to something else. \n\nI'll give them another shot (perhaps at a different location), although at $5 a pop, I might be better off sticking to my usual haunts.", "author": "Brandi W."}

No doubt it's a great coffee shop. Plus, it roasts beans and supplies other independent shops. Latte is what I had then, it was soft, smooth and not that strong. I've tried Four Barrel, Ritual Coffee and Blue bottle in either single origin or espresso drinks, and I'd have a sip of friend's coffee when I was having different one. Sightglass has the lighter taste among those mentioned shops, close to Culture Espresso Bar in NYC. Its pastries are good enough to be paired with coffee.

Every part of me that enjoys anything hipster just let out a huge release of happiness as I walked into this building. Walking in through the door into such a large awesome beautiful place made me want to cry. I spotted a gorgeous stuffed owl up on one of the railings, and the brick interior and lighting just set a great mood for wanting to drink coffee. The people working on making my coffee were I would dare say hipster. The people seated around the area sipping their coffee were probably the creators of what is considered hipster by the public. My favorite had to be the guy sitting by the window watching people walk by while wearing a jean jacket, jeans and a shtreimel.\n\nLet me get to the coffee. I ordered a cappuccino which took them absolutely no time at all to make for me. On the top of the coffee I found that the barista made a heart into the top of my drink. I took one sip and found the most perfect combination of steamed milk and coffee. Through the whole drink, I never once had a bitter taste of coffee. I am a man who always takes his coffee black and without cream, but to have this gorgeous taste of mellow coffee without the addition of sugar had me almost in tears.\n\nOne of the ways I know I have found one of my most favorite spots is if I am constantly telling people about how great my experience was, even an hour later. I talked about this place an hour later, two hours later and even three hours after having my drink. I texted my sister, a SF Yelp elite, that she had to come out to this spot.

The latte he served me is without a doubt one of the most glorious substances to have ever touched my lips.\n\nEnjoyed the Blueboon Blend about as much once I got home, especially given the limitations of not having my own setup.

At the entrance is a swarm of flies. Literally a swarm of flies. Be sure to keep your mouth closed as you walk in. Besides the shoe-gazing soundtrack blaring in the background, this place is somehow really quiet. I didn't HEAR anyone at all. It's a bit unnerving especially when it's supposed to be a coffee shop. I hear friendly chatter even at the Legion of Honor.\n\nTheir menu is a teeny tiny print-out situated on their counter. Beverages come only in one size and they don't even state how big it is. It's really odd when you're standing there trying to read the menu and the idle employee at the counter doesn't greet you or pay any attention. I ask for \"The Hooker's Mocha,\" but he throws up his hands and says \"I can't hear you!\" Ummmm, wtf. I was so shocked by the rudeness I still ordered it and handed over my money. What the hell just happened?? Eh... but what if the beverages are amazing?\n\nSo I wait for my drink and it's not so bad I guess; however, the longer I stand there the pretentiousness just sinks in. Sightglass feels so cold, so fake, and so dead that I cannot believe the amount of rave reviews on this place. On the outside Sightglass looks really clean and simple, but inside it feels like an empty level from DOOM. There are a lot of yuppies and hipsters here. A LOT. I thought I've been to some pretentiousness places in my day, but this takes the cake. The irony of it all is that along with all of their coffee grinds and gizmos, they sell frisbees too. Are you kidding me??? This dead, rude, obnoxious place has the audacity to sell frisbees along with their elitist coffee equipment? HELL does not serve whimsical items like frisbees. Yet they won't serve iced coffee to anyone?\n\nAs I ponder the peculiarity of selling frisbees in a coffee shop, I see a customer fiddling with one of the coffee drips that they're selling. I'm not embellishing when I say that an employee walks around the guy and gives him a dead as nails dismissive look that says, \"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? YOU AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THAT.\" Instead of approaching the customer and asking if he needs any help or questions answered, he just ignores the guy.\n\nMy name is finally called and my drink does actually look nice with a bit of coffee art. I graciously say thank you yet only get an apathetic thanks in return. Now I'm not asking for everyone in here to kiss my ass but this is ridiculous. I've just witnessed three different employees be incredibly rude.\n\nSeating is a bit of a joke. They fill up a tiny cup and saucer all the way to the brim and they expect me to walk 20 feet to a counter, or walk up a long staircase to the second floor. I don't mind if you gave me a bigger cup and not filling it up to the brim. It's just crazy with me having to carry this thing without spilling it. Each drop is worth like 50 cents! And it's so stingy small!!!\n\nSo I manage to get to the counter. My mocha is lacking in flavor and character. The acid is pretty nice but it's boring. Yeah this place sucks. Absolutely no character to it all at. The customers are equally unfriendly. Plus it turns out that they don't have any wifi for customers at all. WOW.

This was recommended to me as the best place to get coffee in San Francisco, even over Four Barrel and Blue Bottle. It completely rocked my world. I went here every day during a 8-day stay. Sometimes I went twice, it was that good. I bought a bag of coffee to bring home.\n\nThey select coffee from individual farmers all over the world, no mass produced stuff. The available coffees change daily. They serve coffee by the cup, generally preferring the pour-over method.  This looks incredibly pretentious and over-the-top (pour the water in a circle and don't let it touch the filter!!!!111oneone) and I would scoff if it didn't taste so delicious. It easily competes with the coffee from a $10,000  Clover machine, but you can buy pour-over gear for under $100, including from Sightglass itself!\n\nThe coffee was amazing - bright, flavourful, lightly acidic. I tried as many different types as I could, and I wasn't let down.\n\nThe Sightglass space they've built is just beautiful too, in contrast to ugly/crackhead SOMA. It's spacious, minimal, and classy. They do their own roasting on site, and it's fun to watch them go through the process. It's a great place to do tech celebrity sighting as well; I saw Jack Dorsey (Twitter & Square co-founder) come in here one morning after securing my morning cup of crack. Sightglass was one of the original Square test sites.\n\nThe only knock I can point out is that they didn't have Wi-Fi. It was such a cool space that I wanted to just hang out there, enjoy my coffee and do some work or browse the web. I'm sure this was a very intentional decision though, the place is too wonderfully designed for it to be an oversight. I imagine they are trying to keep the focus on the coffee and socialization and not get a bunch of d-bags hanging around all day with their bluetooth headsets.

Coming from the Silicon Valley, I was so used to having a Starbucks caddy corner from work, or anywhere I happened to be.  In SOMA, there isn't a Starbucks or even a Peet's anywhere near me!  But, I'm not necessarily complaining either; change is good!\n\nI've been to Blue Bottle which I think is liquid perfection in a recyclable paper cup, but the coworkers kept telling me to check out Sightglass as they prefer it over BB.  Being the caffeine addict that I am, I gave it a shot and invited a coworker along who hasn't made it out to SG either.\n\nFirst off, the space is amazing!  I love the open air, industrial and modern feel of it all.  SG brings a whole new meaning to the term, \"coffee shop.\"  They import the beans, roast the beans, package the beans, sell the beans, ship the beans, grind the beans and brew the beans all right there.  You won't have a hard time to find a place to sit, that's for sure.  SG makes BB feel like a closet!\n\nWe got in line and the coworker and I were looking around, trying to locate their menu.  We got to the counter and saw these little clipboards, which was apparently the menu.  I asked the cashier for an iced beverage suggestion and he suggested one of two Columbian blends they have, so I took him up on it.  The coworker got a latte.\n\nIt took about 10-minutes for my beverage to be prepared.  It was a little difficult to determine who's drink was who's as they're not really yelling out the names and the little sticky notes with the names are affixed on the counter, facing the barista.\n\nWhen my coworker and I got our drinks and took our first sip, we looked at each other and simply raised an eyebrow.  Although the coffee was good, it wasn't mind blowing to that of BB.  The coffee I had was a bit acidic, but that's what the cashier recommended.  Adding cream and sugar definitely helped and eventually enjoyed it.\n\nIf you appreciate coffee in all forms and senses, you'll admire SG.  It's too bad they don't serve sandwiches/salads; they certainly have the space and right ambiance for it.  I think it's an excellent spot to meet a friend or client to chat business with.\n\nOverall, I like Sightglass but, I love Blue Bottle.", "author": "Nick D."}

Upstairs is a small special espresso bar, downstairs is the regular coffee.  There are tables and counter like seating. Upstairs there are about five big wood slab tables that seat four and two enormous communal tables and several smaller tables. It's a big space but it was also very warm. Downstairs there are lots of places to stand against small counters and a few tables. Windows overlook 7th street. Two bathrooms and a shared sink area. \n\nFood: they serve a small but varied selection of pastries including a very yummy pistachio croissant that is kind of caramelized and layered and chewy. They also have regular croissants,poppy seed cake, some vegan options, cookies and these veggie pastries.\n\nCoffee: be prepared almost all they serve is caffeinated coffee. No soda, no seltzer water, a few juices, but no tea. They will do a cappuccino, a latte, and a mocha. The latte was fantastically rich and creamy and smooth with at least a full cup of whole milk. It felt I credibly indulgent and reminded me of ritual in its combination of robust flavor with no bitter afterburn. Cappuccino was very full flavored.", "author": "Vivek V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-09", "description": "Nestled in the heart of  San Francisco's Soma District, Siteglass Coffee shop gloriously radiates; roasting and grinding, crafting the worlds finest coffee beans and drinks. Siteglass is the essence of the modern coffee shop. At least once a day, I make the voyage to this place, as if some Hobbit on an epic adventure to the fires of Mount Doom, only with boiling hot coffee awaiting me as a reward, instead of lava; One sip of the black gold, (coffee, that is) and you will know of which I speak. It's magical, it's transformative, I laughed I cried, it changed my life.\n\nSiteglass has a dual coffee station on the ground floor, which are full serviced - they offer excellent Americanos, Espressos, and Lattes... and an absolutely decadent Mocha - legendary across the seven seas of coffee beanery. This nectar can be brought home, as they grind their own beans and bag them up. If you are fortunate enough to visit during the roasting, then you will know true bliss, only previously attainable by several lifetimes of Buddhist  meditation.\n\nThe pastries are amazing, but sadly, they are bad for your diet, because you can't just eat one, you are compelled, by shear flavor, to order at least two, preferably three. Better get there early, because they go fast. I once saw two people fighting over a chocolate croissant - one of them being President Barak Obama - I can't believe someone would fight the POTUS over a croissant, but there you have it.", "author": "Delilah W."}

The cashier was a bit snobby; smiles were a rarity and when I asked the cashier a question regarding the different type of coffee's and which she preferred, she made it sound like I was beneath her because I didn't know the difference between a sumatra and an affogato. Well... duh! That's why I asked for your suggestion... ask me anything about wine and I would have answered you with a smile and enthusiasm.\n\nAnyway, my friend and I placed our order and the barista made our coffee. She was very delicate with the making of our coffee which was nice to see. We ordered a regular coffee and a soy latte. I've had better soy latte's but the coffee was pretty good. I forgot the name of it though since I was quite perturbed by the customer service.\n\nAll in all, the ambiance and how the coffee shop itself is set up is fantastic. I love the earthy feel, the roominess of the place and its two level sitting area. It's a really great place to study or chat with a friend which earns it 2 stars and 1 star for the coffee.

This \"coffee shop\" is actually inside a spacious warehouse with great natural lighting and two floors of seating. There is a coffee roaster near the entrance and you can see it in action every day (AFAIK usually in the afternoons). This place offers excellent espresso drinks, hand-drip coffees and single-origin beans by the pound (I recommend their Blueboon Blend). If you're not yet a coffee addict, I suggest you learn more about the coffee process by attending their coffee cuppings (tastings) available daily. What exactly is the difference you ask in sight/smell/taste between various coffee origins and roastings? What do you mean by bright vs smooth for liveliness, or full-bodied vs medium for body? Well come here to find out and appreciate that cup of coffee even more! I guarantee you will never want to drink instant coffee again.\n\nI've had Sightglass' lattes and cappuccinos. The drinks were very creamy and perfectly made. I was definitely wired for several hours after enjoying this piece of espresso heaven. I've also had their Blueboon blend; true to its description, I found this blend indeed contained notes of chocolate and citrus, but it was a bit too much on the bright (acidic) end for me. I would still get it every time though if I didn't feel like getting the usual latte/cappuccino. Yes the prices are on the high end, but it's not any different than your standard Blue Bottle/Four Barrel/Philz/Ritual premium prices. Otherwise just go to Starbucks for their cheaper yet burnt coffee. The minimalist atmosphere here is perfect for catching up with friends in the afternoon (and not so much for studying without Wi-Fi or power outlets...oh and watching the coffee roaster work its magic is pretty mesmerizing). As a bonus, they're dog friendly and take credit cards. I will be back at least once every week or two.", "author": "Andy C."}

If you're just getting into these roasters and trying them out/deciding which to try first, here is my take: I personally enjoyed Fourbarrel the most. Their Ecuador roast had the most unique flavors and pleasant taste/after-taste.\n\nI wanted to love Sightglass because my ultrahip coffeefiend friends said that it was better than Fourbarrel. At first glance, I felt like I was walking into a contemporary art museum - the whole place looks like a refurbished warehouse - very sleek, very urban. I loved the high ceilings and the huge windows bathing you in light. It had a spacious and airy feeling, so even though it was crowded (all seats/tables full on a Sunday afternoon), I didn't feel stuffed or cramped like some other cafes. There is plenty of seating downstairs and also a variety of tables upstairs. Just like Ritual and Fourbarrel, there is great branding and sense of style.\n\nSince this was our first time, husband asked a couple questions about their three roasts, and the barista, who seemed kind of confused that we were confused, was kind enough to explain them to us. We tried their Columbian roast and their Rwandan roast. The Rwandan roast, which we chose for the fruity notes, was very unique - it almost tasted like tea, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It did, however, taste sort of sour on our palates, and we ended up having to finish half of it with some ice cream from Smitten (~1 mile walking away!). The Columbian roast was nice and strong - a good cup of coffee and definitely smoother and more tasteful than your large chain stores, but it wasn't anything I would rave about or go out of my way for.\n\nSo after a week of caffeine crawling, I crown Fourbarrel the winner; I would make the trip across the bridge for their coffee and can't wait to bring all my friends.", "author": "Jen L."}

They need some older barrels that fit the theme.\n\nI had a cappuccino and a croissant and I appreciated that the cappuccino was prepared properly, most places like to give you a milkshake to disguise the taste of the coffee. I need to have a straight-up espresso to really judge the coffee which I'll do next time in SF. This is a really nice place to grab some good coffee.", "author": "Mario C."}

Two stories, machines all over the place, with the espresso bar right in the middle. As opposed to some of the other coffee joints I've tried, the baristas here were especially friendly and not condescending.\n\nI ordered a soy latte, which I enjoyed very much. They managed to make some really cool latte art with the soy milk...which is usually harder! WHOA!\n\nThe bathrooms made me laugh a bit. After you do your business, you walk outside...into the main room to wash your hands. It just felt...different...to wash my hands with dudes. Felt like a unisex bathroom except it wasn't. OK that's enough about bathrooms...\n\nMy boyfriend really liked the Kenya that we ordered. He says that it had a really subtle, tropical vibe. The coffee was acidic and had a very light body. The Blueboon (Sightglass' blend coffee) was also delightful. I would definitely come here again.", "author": "Sandra C."}

They put a lot of money and work into creating a really inspiring place to visit. Ideal for a client meeting or if you need a place to work for an hour. The skylights are a great feature and make the place really comfortable. \n\nThe coffee on the other hand is not so good. I ordered an Americano and it was bitter as hell. I'm a regular at Blue Bottle and Four Barrel and order Americano's everywhere I go. The coffee was bitter and had a lingering after taste. My friend visited Sight Glass a few days prior and commented on the same exact issue. Not sure if this is from the bean or how they roasted it, but I'm not a fan. \n\nAlso, their \"creamer\" station was at the far rear of the space and not convenient to get to. I found myself looking around and had to ask the staff. When I went back there to doctor up my coffee, the dishwasher splashed dirty dish water into my coffee. This was not a pleasant experience. They put the creamer station next to the dish washing station. I hope management will rethink this as it's inconveniently positioned within their cafe.", "author": "Giselle B."}

So without a doubt, when I'm in the mood for a quick fix, this is my spot to come to. The coffee is unbelievable here! It is probably one of the few non-cold-brewed iced coffees that I actually look forward to having --- except for the ridiculous price tag that comes with it!\n\nI totally understand the thought of paying ~$4 for a specialty drink (lattes and what have you...) But when I'm paying 4.5 for Iced Drip Coffee... Yea --- that's a bit overboard pal. This is the only real early morning spot to get good coffee in the hood. Instead though, their prices have just lead me to making my own cold brew at home. \n\nI'll go in every now and then in the mornings if I didn't have a chance to get some beans soaking --- but the other big issue I have with this place is speed... When you have a timed bus to catch, make sure to give yourself  good 10 minutes here to get your coffee. If you see people waiting in the barista area for their drink, tack on a couple of a few extra minutes. For some reason the Baristas don't have a sense of urgency, nor are they able to brew more then one or two nel drip orders at once. Having worked in a few restaurants, I know how important efficiency is in a service environment like this, and sometimes I just want to jump back there and help grind the beans for someone, because for some reason, they can't do it while they are standing there waiting to finish making a single cup of coffee. \n\nIf this place had slightly speedier baristas in the morning, I would probably make it a once a week treat for myself (again due to the pricing...)

My first espresso wasn't inspired by fatigue or boredom. My first coffee was a result of a long conversation with a passionate barista. (He was passionate about coffee, not about me.)\n\nI sat with him for a full 20 minutes chatting in broken italian about the art of coffee- before I ever had a drop. He spoke of procuring the beans, transporting the beans, the roasting process and fhe final step: roasted bean to grinder to espresso machine to cup.  From what I gathered, even if you did steps 1-3 perfectly everything could go wrong in step 4.  (Which seemed obvious at the time becuase step 4 actually appeared to be 4 additional steps all jammed into 1) In any case, 100's of espressos later, I see Marco was indeed correct. \n\nThe person  (I've only ever seen one official representative at any given time)  at Sight Glass does it all so well, with ease and grace. And in the whole process they are the equivalent of the latte art or possibly the foam-- something crucial but at the end the culmination of a series of efforts.  Not to worry. whoever is behind the scenes doing the rest of the work is also doing their job. Good bean choice-- good roasting. Actually you can see the roaster if you peak behind the curtain. It is a massive dinosaur straight out of cold war East Germany. And you think I'm kidding. I've heard they had that puppy shipped over. \n\nI'm a fan of Sightglass. And I give them extra points for their quirky throwback name, their muddy brown colored cups and their lack of pretension-- for the time being their operation consists of coffee cart attached to a large (at the time) empty space on a street of no particular interest in SOMA. \n\nI'll be sure to come back and visit next time I'm home. \n\nP.S Intelligentsia, don't be upset.

The space feels awfully grandiose, sterile, and aesthetically noteworthy to Dwell standards.  \n\nSightglass serves alarmingly great espresso, beans that have been attentively roasted, low in acidity, and therefore makes a seriously butter-rich ristretto shot to accommodate any drink.  Initially ordering my drink was a bit awkward, but a scattered line will form near the spinning iPad/cashier and pastry display.\n\nIf it seems a bit high-brow to you, it just might be.  True coffee drinkers hold smug satisfaction in finding a place that honors coffee for its own unique flavor.  If you want a milkshake with a hit of espresso, go to Starbucks.

But do bring a big bag of quarters if you expect to stay for awhile. \n\n2. I  walk into a warm, naturally lit, cafe. Laid back environment, lots of woody tones, kind of like a decorated warehouse that was trying really hard to not try hard.\n\n3. The Ordering.\nCB: \"Soy Latte please\"\nBarista: \"Sorry, no soy, just almond milk is that ok?\"\nCB: \"Ok, can you ice it please?\"\nBarista: \"Sorry, no I can't the espresso turns papery and gross when poured over ice. I do have some pour over ice options\" \nCB: \" it's okay, i'll take it hot. Can you drizzle some honey on top?\"\nBarista: \"Sorry, no we do things pretty simple here, no honey. I do have some raw sugar you can sprinkle on top.\"\nCB: \"ok that's fine.\" At this point I was like hmm maybe I shouldn't dare ask for Vanilla syrup.... \nThen I get this really delicious crossaint from the case. So point is, not TOO many coffee options. They keep it REAL simple here. But at least the barista wasn't pretentious or as rude as others had described. He was really nice about things. There were definitely more pastry options than coffee options. Anyways, the lattee was DELICIOUS. I sprinkled some extra sugar on it and i was a happy camper.\n\nTotal: $8.75 More than my average starbucks bill, but things did taste pretty good, fresh and natural. So I was a fan.  They do take credit cards thank goodness! \n\n4. The ambiance: I went upstairs carefully carrying my coffee and my plate of food, but not too bad. Upstairs you find two large tables with room for about 10 people. One long counter overlooking the cafe with room for abouter 5- 7 adn then 4 tables against the wall with room for 4-5. On the first floor they have some long counters with stools as well. It was pretty easy to find a place to sit and read.\n\nOverall, I'd be happy to come back here again. It had a hipster vibe, yes ridicuously. But i did like how laid back things were. \n\nPS. the bathrooms were  kind of gross the day I went. I walked into one, no TP. I walked into another and it made me want to vomit and the door nob on the inside of the bathroom was wet. GROSS. Also mysterious puddles in the bathroom too... Definitely needed tons of hand sanitizer for that one. That deserves a star lost. Hopefully just a fluke and they get their bathroom act together like their coffee act!", "author": "Christine B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-13", "description": "Sad fact:  Unless you've been drinking local, micro-roasted only, you probably don't actually know what good coffee tastes like.  See, most coffee is roasted dark, so it tastes like roast.  Big producers buy crappy beans, and you have to burn them a bit to hide the mediocre flavors.   Even some small roaster head into the land of dark, trying to appeal to the ruined commercial drinker's palet. People love that dark, bitter swag, but you aren't actually tasting coffee, just roast.\n\nIf you want to actually taste coffee, and not burnt beans that formerly tasted like coffee until someone roasted the snot out of them, go to Sightglass.  They do the best job in SF of roasting; you can taste the origin character of the bean, and if there is roast flavor, it's there to compliment, not cover up.  There's a couple other local places that come in a close second, but these cats nail it, every time.\n\nThey can be a little grumpy when it's busy, but it's never egregious.  I think the time line for their full cafe opening is toward the end of Obama's second term, based on current progress.  The lack of available decaf espresso is a bit of a chafe (SG: I'll buy you a decaf bean grinder, if that's what takes).

This place was so disappointing. I am from out of town, and am an avid coffee drinker so I know what I like- this was NOT what I like.

We also ordered an iced mocha and it came in the same hot, 8oz cup, just with a few ice cubes in it. The staff was just okay. The barista didn't talk or even look happy and the only one who spoke to me was the cashier and it was only to take my money. This place seems either very pretentious or they just don't really care. I give two stars because my hot mocha was bearable (even though I did throw it away after a few sips...) but the iced mocha, NO WAY. STAY AWAY. It tasted like cold, bitter, and dead espresso mixed with some water and maybe some nonfat milk or something. It tasted like water pretty much. Bitter, burnt water. Threw it away after one sip. Thanks for wasting $10 from my bank account for bad coffee, underwhelming service, and an atmosphere that was not welcoming and where everyone seemed too engulfed in their laptops to even look remotely happy on this nice day.

Every cup is individually slow dripped-- this makes the wait for the coffee a little longer than you would want if you're trying to get in & get out. I would say it takes about 6-9 minutes for a coffee depending on the number of customers.  I had a Guatemalan strain.. which was mid priced.  They have coffees for $6-7 for a small cup if you really really want to splurge. Seems like coffee is the way to go. Espresso drinks were much cheaper but have gotten poor reviews.\n\nThe coffee is on the acidic side- which I like, and the caffeine content is HIGH. You definitely get the bang for you buck there.  I drink coffee everyday, usually I never feel the buzz, but halfway through my expensive small cup of coffee I was flying!\n\nHowever, the slow drip coffee seems to be the only thing really working here.  The design of the place is modern and interesting but very empty and it feels confused.  Like the owner can't decide to leave it modern or add chairs and tables. There are a couple places to sit, but not many.  The cream, sugar, etc. are in the weirdest hardest to find place-- and a place of this caliber should have simple syrup, IMO.\n\nIf you're into high-tech-- you'll love the payment/ordering system.  Everything done with ipads, with attached credit card readers-- you can add the tip electronically, you sign with your finger, and you can choose to email, print or have no receipt.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

I didn't see a name for this place, and it looked and smelled like it had coffee, but I wasn't sure.\n\nSo, I walk in, and ask the lady in there if she knows where Blue Bottle Coffee is. \n\nShe goes, oh you should try the coffee here. And I ask \"What is this place\". She goes its \"Slight Glass\".\n\nI hear \"Psyche Class\" (Psychology class).\n\nI look around, and there were 2-3 people sitting in a row on a wooden bench, there was a curtain covering a back area (where they are building a bigger coffee bar) but I thought there were waiting to go to psyche class, behind the curtain.\n\nSo, I look her dead in the eyes and I go, \"Oh, I'm not in that class\".\n\nIt got awkward hard and fast within seconds. She continues looking at me, with a giant question mark over her head. Her expression conveyed to me that I had done something stupid. I back track, and said, wait this is \"psyche class\"? She goes, nope. Slight Glass.\n\nI got the coffee. I drank it. And I LOVED it. \n\nEver since then, I have been coming here often. My experience has been much less awkward, and I excited to see when they will expand. We need some class and good coffee in the neighborhood.

So in my drab jeans and plain black baby tee (required work clothes), all sweaty and smelling like burgers and fries on a rare 90 something degree day in the SOMA I absolutely did not feel adequately attired to duck thru the 10 by 10 hole in the building and buy coffee in front of all the cooler people..\n\nA few days later I was walking by again in a sun dress and sandals with my precious Jack Russel Madison and decided that even if I wasn't cute enough for Sight Glass Coffee, she was. Well nice thing about a whole in the wall, no one minds cute puppies- since your not exactly inside anyways.\n\nThe spice infused ice coffee as a product is 5 star no doubt. What an incredible treat. I also bought some of their legendary coffee beans and took them home with me to brew and needless to say I'm hooked. \n\nSo although they have a 5 star product and friendly enough service I think I'll reserve my final star until they open up the rest of the cafe because that is just too much \"hip\" for so small a pace. Right now it's a scene you can't avoid being seen in, almost feels as though you're on stage and that's not where you want to be if you're sleepy, hung over, or in sweats.

My still hazy eyes fixating on the coffee as it bubbles, rises and recedes, my nostrils flared smelling the goodness.\n\nForesight is not a strong suit- so I inevitably run out of beans and everything comes to a screeching halt.  No music, the groggy eating of a peanut butter sandwich- in all likelihood a skipped shower, and a stumble out the door to find some beans and a cup of coffee to normalize.\n\nLucky for me, Sightglass is on my walk to work, so I can order up a cup of coffee and buy some good beans at the same time.  Their coffee is really good- both the DIY kind and the kind they make for you.  I usually leave and put something bass heavy on the headphones and walk to work with my head nodding in between sips; and feel a little sad when there is nothing left.  Plus I get to peek in and watch the construction of their cafe and behold! the behemoth of a roaster laying sentry over the not yet finished space.\n\nSome days, I wish they had something to nosh on, like a ham and cheese croissant, but knowing they don't makes eating before hand more vital.

I come here every time I'm in SF.  \n\nIn regards to a few of the complaints I see on here.....\n\nThe staff:\nGenerally nice it seems to me.  But, for sure they are used to a crowd, and are sometimes abrupt until the crowds calm enough for them to take a breather, calm down, and be more sociable.  This isn't your talkative local neighborhood shop, this is a high volume roastery.  \n\nThe coffee:\nYes, their standard espresso does lean a little on the sharp / acidic side.  It's got a really nice soft aftertaste however.  Clearly a well roastered coffee, but if you're a fan of Sumatra, Kona or Columbian, this isn't it.   I think it's one of the best medium tasting roasts I've had.\n\nThe space:\nDesigned for an urban feel, and very open.  Great space to meet someone.  Not oriented towards lingering.  No wifi or outlets.  Not an issue for those of us with mobile hotspots and long laptop battery lives.  I wouldn't object to not using my data plan, and I would really love to see them adopt the policy of a similar shop I visit in Seattle (Vivace) of having WiFi available at off-peak times only, and turning it off when the shop is too crowded to accommodate large laptop using crowds.", "author": "Duncan C."}

They refuse to serve me an iced latte because it \"alters the taste\" or some nonsense.  Well who the fuck cares, I LIKE THE TASTE!! AND I'M THE CUSTOMER!!! AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS!!! Get off your high horse and serve the fucking coffee and move on.  But no, instead I have to hear some snooty bitch's rationalization of why I can't have what I want.  They serve iced coffee, they have ice, just give it to me. Period.\n\n2. My lovely husband went there today to get us coffee (because it's sunday and Vega's closed) and instead of going through the whole iced latte ordeal I just had him get me a double espresso to go so I could make my OWN ICED LATTE AT HOME.  BUT NO they don't serve espresso TO GO AT ALL!!!!  Why? That seems silly! Because- get this one- \"it sinks into the cup because it's so little of an amount\".  HA! Seriously??  Yep, but they didn't tell him that when they rang him up and took his money, just when they served it up in a ceramic cup and made him drink it on the spot.  \n\nAlright there fascists, thanks for taking ALL of the fun out of drinking good coffee.

I didn't really understand what any of that meant at the time, but I went along because I love coffee, and he was so curious.\n It took us a while to find it, as it's smack in the middle of a very industrial part of town, and when we did we discovered that they were in the middle of construction and were serving the coffee in a garage- type of situation to the side of where I assume the coffee shop will be. There was a single bench, so we had a chance to sit for a second, but it wasn't very comfy for hanging around. \nThis was hands down one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had. They do an individual drip cup, and you can tell it's made with a lot of love. So good that we took about 2 buses to go back from our hotel the next morning before leaving town, and also bought a bag of coffee beans. \nI am looking forward to returning to San Francisco someday and seeing how the renos turned out.", "author": "Orla M."}

Knowing a thing or two about my audience, I don't say this lightly. I am champing at the bit, counting the days, anxiously awaiting the day that the full cafe opens. I will be a daily patron.\n\nFirst and foremost is the coffee. It is utterly amazing. I have yet to have anything but a fantastic [pick a menu item]. I find it remarkable is that when here, I don't typically add cream or sugar as I normally do; a testament to the quality and flavor.\n\nNext is the staff. All of them are easy going, quick to smile, and very good at what they do. Somehow they seem to manage to keep the current \"nook\" off of 7th filled with happy coffee-goers with noticeably less waiting around than most places too.\n\nFinally, is the space. What a beautiful setup they have going on. Lots of light and air. A gigantic library loft of the gods, where the disciples of the bean may come and study. I very much hope that the loft area is open for seating...it would be amazing (hint hint).\n\nI've also been told that once open, they will be WiFi free. I think this is a good idea.

That's what I was eyeing too. It's like she was psychic. I like psychic service.\n\n$2.50 and 3 minutes later, I had a succulent cup of Sightglass Coffee. So good. So smooth.

Such as the coffee bar hidden in the picture on the right.  Do you see it?  Look within that warehouse being remodeled, behind that yellow van.  Ah, there it is.  SightGlass!  I walked by this area and saw all kinds of signs saying SightGlass, but I thought it was some kind of glass shop, until I finally took a good look inside.\n\nThe scene:\n\nA full coffee bar, a standing table, and one bench are all that make up the current SightGlass coffee bar.  There's always a few people waiting in line or hanging out on the bench.  Behind the bar is a bunch of curtains covering something going on in the back.  Next to the bench is more curtained off areas where you can hear all kinds of construction going on.  I overheard them talking about remodeling the area for where the actual coffee shop is going to be.  This must be their way of making money during the remodel to make up some of the costs.\n\nThe food:\n\nI decided to order the Spice Infused Iced Tea. It was a nice and relatively warm day, although it's been raining all week.  The cup was pretty small, and the coffee was stronger than the watery Starbucks substance I normally get at work.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-17", "description": "Well... for the most part, this place is rated pretty high by almost all the Yelpers. But there are those few that for whatever reason have left this place with a very bad taste in their mouths. Words that have been used to describe Sightglass have been, pretentious, cold, fake, overly yuppie or hipster, etc, etc.... Wishing they could rate it at zero because one star was to good for this place.\nThis extreme in public opinion peeked my curiosity. I had to find out for myself. So this is my take on the place.\nI walked in, went up to the counter, was kindly greeted with a smile and asked what I wanted. I ended up getting a $2 cup of coffee and made my way upstairs to have a seat. Tall ceilings, lots of concrete, steel and wood create a clean industrial look and feel that echo characteristics of a warehouse or factory from the 50's. \nIts 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon and as I look around I start to wonder where all the pretentious hipsters and yuppies are. All I see is the normal SF crew of usual suspects. Nothing out of the ordinary here. The coffee (black) is, well... pretty good. A little to acidic for my taste but non the less... good. All in all... its not a bad place and I really like the atmosphere. \nBut... here are a few things that will probably keep me from frequenting the place much. \n\n1. At least for me... Its kinda out of the way. Unless you work around there, I don't see why you would bother going there just for the coffee.\n\n2. No Internet connection?... Sorry, but its 2012 and everyone and their mom has a Macbook and needs to connect to... whatever it is on the Interweb. Its just excepted in this town and if you don't have it, its kinda like you're making some kind of social statement. Like \"Unplug man... burn a candle and stop wasting electricity\" lol. \n\n3. They sell coffee............... Yup. Thats pretty much it. Now, I know I got there at 4pm and I did see a few pastry looking things in the front counter but Jeez. Hook me up with some carbs or something. I mean, This place is huge... you could fit a whole restaurant in here if you wanted.\n\n4. No electrical outlets. Haha... yeah I know, back to the computer thing again, but seriously, its a coffee shop and Id love to just hang out for awhile but without the ability to do work or entertain myself you can only stay there for so long before you start twiddling your thumbs plus, there are plenty of other coffee shops that are way more convenient. \n\nSummary:\n\nEmployees: Seemed nice to me\nCoffee: Not bad, I might even say good.\nAtmosphere: Loved it.\n\nThe not so good.\nLocation\nNo Wifi\nAlmost nothing to eat.\n\nOverall... I give it a Meh +1. I like the place but there is no real reason for me to go back, and its very far from some of the overly negative reviews Ive seen on Yelp.", "author": "Jeff H."}

I spoke with the (very friendly) barista, asking her about how the Slayer functions.  She explained all the benefits I read about, and also how complex it is to fine tune.  To mitigate the complexity, she said that the owners set up the pressure profiles, etc. each morning (adjusting for the beans/roast), and she simply pulls the shots the same way each time.  This may explain why I was a bit disappointed with the resulting shot.\n\nAccording to the Slayer site (http://www.slayerespresso.com/2009/05/01/slayer-compared-to-other-brands/): \"It gives you control over pressure in an entirely new and intuitive way.  You can intercede in your shot at any point by changing pressure... It's a machine to prepare artisanal coffee BY HAND. You set those pressure deltas quickly and easily, and you use the machine by watching your shots.\"  So it seems that Sightglass' configure-once/pull-all-day model is not what the Slayer guys had in mind.

Like most places that roast coffee, their is that \"if you have questions about coffee, don't ask what to drink\" and this place definitely is like that.  After ordering a latte, that was really good, I purchased a 3/4 pound bag of coffee (not even a whole pound).  I have been making French Press coffee for years and know how the coffee should taste.  With the coffee I purchase, the taste was never right (even when using more coffee).  Every time the coffee tasted sour and I could not drink it.

Can't you just give me a mug that will keep the coffee warmer? \n- Open space is poorly soundproofed, you can't hear anything when the machine is running, and the music is blasting.\n- Service is hit and miss, the guy took my order is pretty cool, and the girl made my coffee called my name before it was ready, and was not being helpful at all.\n- Very limited seating, all the current seating are bar stools along the bars that are facing the front window and around the roasting machine. Standing room only around the brewing bar. \n\nThey are doing a lot of work on the second floor to put more seatings, and a sample roasting station.\n\nI probably won't be a regular customer, since it will become more like a destination instead of a neighborhood cafe.", "author": "Alice C."}

It was great when it was under construction and all you got the minibar behind the rolly door, now that the cafe is 100% open, it's even better.  THe space is super cool and the beans and roast quality is second to none.  Sightglass delivers a very consistent cup, and their beans tend to produce a complex product that seems to get better with every sip.  Espresso-wise they pull shots from a new Slayer 2 group, a beautiful machine that while I'm not sure delivers quite the product of the La Marzocco, is still pretty great.  It's a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for.  I love this place.", "author": "Adam B."}

Their cappuccinos are fantastic (I've really never seen them on an off day here) and their drip is perfection.  Really great baked goods too.  And they take credit cards!\n\nAs much as I love it I have to take away a star for two reasons:\n\n1. They took away the (herbal?) infused iced coffee.  I asked for it one day and was told they no longer had it because they were trying to stay true to the coffee itself or something like that.  It's now just plain old iced coffee.  I wish they would bring it back because as much as I love their regular coffee, sometimes I want something a little different.\n\n2.  Lately on their drip menu (they always have three coffees to choose from), they haven't had a selection that costs less than $4.50.  I'm not one to complain about price if the product is great but sometimes I just really don't want to pay this much for a cup of black coffee.  Lately, I want the drip but I have to get a cappuccino instead because I didn't bring enough cash.  So that's a little annoying.", "author": "S B."}

It's an interesting find because the spot is literally around the corner from where I have dwelled for the past three years.  Around a corner I hardly tread, but even so.\n\nCurrently SightGlass is merely a kiosk of coffee offerings here in SoMa with plans to expand into the currently storage filled space immediately next door.  They are roasting their beans at a \"friend's\" roastery in Santa Cruz and seem enthused, if understatedly so, about the expansion and ability to roast their own in house.\n\nThey serve their coffee in one size and one size only.  with no plans to offer any variety, at least when it comes to this aspect, in the future.  Their thimble sized cups left me quizzical, because I , like many, have grown accustomed to a hefty sized cup while wandering around the city in the early morning hours.  This cup is just, well, unimpressive.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving.\n\nI asked for an explanation of the different drip cup offerings and went with the one described by one of the owners as \"blueberry Pancake\" in flavor.  Subtle, fresh, aromatic.  Yum.\n\nWith Vega just opened about a block away and Wicked about to open in a week, I have to wonder at all this coffee brew-ha-ha here in SoMa.

In the end, I'd say the arrogance and aloofness at Sightglass is comparable to Four Barrel but less than that of Ritual and Blue Bottle which, frankly, have become intolerable with their \"hipster\" routines.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-21", "description": "Love this place. Been coming since they opened a year or so ago. The overall quality and care taken in roasting the beans and making the beverages is second to none. Every latte, cappuccino, Americano and cup of coffee, for that matter, has been perfect. I love coffee but hate coffee houses, especially ones in the mission that attract a certain pointy shoe wearing, overly aloof, intentionally disheveled clientele. Which makes this place even better because those types can't find places that aren't in the mission. I highly recommend stopping by for a cup of whatever your pleasure is and grabbing a bag of some freshly roasted beans for your french press or Chemex if you're fancy like that!", "author": "I D."}

It wasn't on my list that included Temple in Sacramento, Blue Bottle and Ritual.  I have to say that hands down, Sightglass out shined them all.  Sitting here in St. Paul, sipping a cup of Blueboon that we brought back with us clinches it.  We visited Sightglass twice during our stay in San Francisco.  It was marvelous both visits.  The Slayer makes the finest latte I have ever had.  The baristas were friendly to boot. The setting is a gorgeous combo of industrial modern barn/warehouse that I could live in.  Punk playing over the speakers, coffee roasting, colorful patrons, Hookers sea salt caramels and the lack of wi-fi make this place an absolute gem.

I agree with other yelpers: the place has a great feel to it.  They were roasting coffee beans right there in the store, which is something really cool.  It gave me something to watch as I waited and waited and waited for my coffee.  There's my ding. The cashier was polite, but not overly friendly or helpful.  She took my order, placed a post-it on a cup and placed it near a co-worker, who was preoccupied with some important coffee business.  I had ordered a $4 cup of coffee. The cashier swipped my card and on reader connected to an iPAD, which very cool. She flipped the iPAD around for me to add either a $1, $2, $3 or more for a tip, then sign the iPAD with my finger.  I walked over to the coffee bean roaster to watch a gentleman pour and swift beans. I walked back over to the coffee bar and saw my cup hadn't move and the co-worker was still enthralled with transfixing stickers from one sheet to another.  She looked up at me, then quickly looked away. I walked back over to the cashier to see if there was a problem.  She said, she was going to check on it and walked away from me and talked to the sticker worker, then walked away from the counter. I assumed the problem was fixed, but she never told me it would be a few moments more because she just walked away.   Anyway, I got my coffee. No thank you, No sorry about the wait. No enjoy the coffee.  Just \"Tom\" and handed me the coffee.  The coffee was very good.  Maybe not worth $4. But, good. Service was terrible.
