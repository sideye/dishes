The salty had a tasty and light miso dressing that I much prefer over vinaigrette or cream dressings. Lastly, the rice and BBQ chicken were sweet and tangy, just the way I like it.

A friend called in on behalf of his wife to confirm the non-use of MSG, and she loved eating here.\n\nThe quality is good and pricing is nice, especially if you do the under $10 specials, which seems to be the best way to go.  \n\nThe big specials (i.e. Meat Mountain\", \"Double Rib\" etc.)are higher priced and portions are big, but in one breath not that much bigger considering the price tag, but also a lot bigger for one average sized person to indulge in eating without taking leftovers.\n\nIt's not your traditional Korean BBQ per se, but is really good and better service than most Korean restaurants with the \"ajumma\" lack of customer service.  Here at Hahn's it's friendly and service with a smile! \n\nThe salad dressing is great tasting as an FYI.  The sauces they use aren't overly sweet nor salty and almost are a gravy like Asian glaze that's not too thick nor watery either, so blends in perfectly with the rice.\n\nI'm from SF originally and went to Hahn's (other location) in the 80's-90's, and it's the type of place I have nostalgia for and when I visit SF it's a great destination point to eat at.  I always qualify a good restaurant with the rhetorical question... \"If I were ever to move out of the city it's located in, and were ever to return to that city, would I make a special trip and point to return to visit that restaurant?\" - - the answer here is obviously \"YES\" - - it has unique flavor and a good dining experience that is unique, not easily replicated in So Cal or even within SF n' The Bay.\n\nI forgot how good it was and is... in one of those \"you don't realize what you had, 'til it's gone\" type of deals... so coming back and revisiting the culinary delights, I'm upgrading my previous review rating here too.\n\nParking can be challenging on Irving, but the adjacent streets, if you're willing to walk a few blocks can be easy if you have good SF street smarts n' parking karma.", "author": "Rick S."}

That's my gold standard; most places fall short. I had some excitement for this place because it seems family owned and they are Korean. The price was promising at $10.50 for the hot pot. Service was fine, what you expect at any Asian family owned restaurant. I was disappointed there were no appetizers, like bean sprouts, kimchee, cucumbers, etc. I wasn't offered any tea either. \n\nThe hot pot bibimbap came out and it was sizzling as promised. Unfortunately the rice was quite wet--maybe they put in too much water today. But because it was wet, it didn't mix well and didn't harden too easily. The ingredients were fine, broccoli instead of spinach was a curious choice. I got it with beef and there was an average portion. I harp on the lack of appetizers because I like to eat the cold dishes with the bi bim bap to even out the hot taste.

Being a Korean restaurant I began to wait. For the Ban Chan (appetizer-type side dishes). Which never came. Kind of a disappointment. Those little dishes really help get your appetite up and also serve to compliment the main course quite nicely. Ouch minus 1 star. \n\nMy bibimbap came sizzling and hot and everything looked great. I proceeded to dive right in. As i began to hit the rice at the bottom I began to notice something. The bottom of the bowl was heavily oiled (so the rice wouldn't stick or something?)

The rice was soaked in it and towards the end when I got to that wonderful layer of burnt rice that should be there, I found a slightly browned but nauseatingly greasy layer.

Unfortunately, it looks like there is a completely different crew that has taken over operations here. First of all, the food was disgusting. The teriyaki beef was barely seasoned, and the cut of meat was extremely fatty. Next, we decided to try a new dish, bbq unagi. I'm thinking, I like BBQ, and I like unagi, so why not combine the two? The combination resulted in a gooey mess, and the sauce tasted like they had purchased the ingredients from the local dollar store. The bathrooms - you have to go through the kitchen. Now, I've done this before, and it's been no big deal. As a matter of fact, some of my favorite Chinese food restaurants have this same set up. But Hahn's is a modern restaurant. They should have a decent bathroom. \n\nAnd what killed it all? The service. This place was about the size of a small SF living room. You could literally stand at the host stand, and hit everyone in the restaurant with a pair of chopsticks, EASILY. Every time we ordered more beers or sake, it would take at least 10 minutes, but there was no one else in the restaurant (should have been a sign...). And when we finally were taking our time and paying the bill, we received the deadly, ominous stares from the hostess, chef, and busboy. We weren't even close to closing time, so I have no idea what the issue was. And sadly, with the number of fly restaurants in SF, I don't plan to give this place another shot.

I don't trust this restaurant... & I've heard real stories about how some restaurants are cheap and crazy (reusing food that was eaten).\nseriously... all the rice and a few noodles? really...

SLOW SERVICE!\n-need to make a take out more than a half eaten plate (PLEASE, DO THIS YOURSELF, OFFER TO HELP YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T WANT MORE THAN HALF OF YOUR PLATE'S FOOD PORTION TO BE GONE, don't let her do it!).\n-THEY DO RIP YOU OFF IN MANY WAYS...

Being automobileless I take the Judah N Line that passes by this particular location and drop by once in a while.  Not the best \"Korean\" food in town, but an easy quick fix that will fill you up right.  It's awesome that the waitress (who always seems to be the same girl all the time with a crazy manicure) actually speaks Korean - that's bonus points for me.  As far the menu items, I've only tried their bi-bim-bap both in the stone bowl and without and both were a pleasant surprise considering there aren't many Koreans in this area of town to my knowledge.

I went here with a friend of mine two nights ago and what a waste of money this turned out to be.  My friend and I were talking and catching up when the old hag of a waitress comes over and asks if we were ready to order.  We hadn't had a chance to look at the menu yet (we'd been there about 5 mins) and she basically ordered us to order before we talked.  WTF???  You're gonna tell your customers to order before they talk?  Ok hag!  So we ordered the seafood tofu soup (medium spicy) and the BBQ rib combo.  Let me just say that if you want a good bowl of tofu soup take your ass over to Tofu House on Geary because the soup at Hahn's was bland and tasteless.  Not only that but they don't give you the raw egg to crack open and drop into the soup.  The bbq rib combo was pretty much one short rib, one pork spare rib, and one beef spare rib that was each basically covered in the same sauce.  Not too creative there.  Overall the service was terrible at this place, and the food wasn't worth the money.   Needless to say, I will not make a return trip to this joint.

The beef was very well marinated, the veggies were fresh and plentiful, and the server was actually nice. No, really! She even let us in before they officially opened for lunch because we were just checking out the menu outside. Maybe they are trying to \"beef\" up business but they served a nice lunch. My wife liked the tofu stew as well. Not the best she's had but very good. I'd come back here for bi bim bop anytime if it is like this first visit.
