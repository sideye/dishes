I had heard about PPQ from my roommates years ago, but the whole crab debate really started when my parents heard about Thanh Long from some of their friends. We finally made it happen for Father's Day.\n\nLocation: There's two locations, one in the Sunset and one in FiDi, but they're slightly different with slightly different menus. We chose the original, even though it's a farther drive. Parking can be a bit difficult, no surprise there. They do have valet parking, though, if you choose.\n\nAmbiance: From the outside, this place looks like nothing special, but just after entering, you can tell that this is a special occasions kind of place. There's white table cloths, the wait staff is nicely dressed, and the host at the front is very nice and polite, ensuring that we were promptly seated. They do have a very strict policy regarding honoring reservation times, but I appreciate it. It keeps things orderly and outlines the rules very clearly.\n\nService: Top notch. Obviously it's not some Michelin star restaurant where the waitstaff is over the top, but everyone was very pleasant. Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were cleared promptly, and they made sure we had everything we needed. I believe they automatically included tip regardless of your party size, so while some people can be turned off by that, I think it's refreshing. The staff is obviously well compensated for their services and are treated with respect -- and it shows.\n\nFood: We ordered An's Famous Roast Crab, Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant, and Charbroiled Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns. The prawns were just okay, but luckily they came on top of a mount of delicious garlic noodles. The eggplant was really good. However, the star of the show was the roast crab. I don't know how they season it, but every little bit, including the shell was delicious! I definitely admit to sucking on the empty crab shell bits at the end because it was so good!\n\nPrice: Definitely not cheap, but also worth it for a special occasion.\n\nWould I return? If a celebration were in order, I wouldn't say no!", "author": "Leana L."}

Was the food amazing? YES! Was it very expensive? Why yes. Was it worth it? YES! Will I go here every weekend? Nope, because I ain't balling like that. \n\nValet parking is offered for $13, and they park it on the street right out front (sometimes along the sidewalk, sometimes smack dap in the street with your emergency lights on) I'm not too comfortable with that so we tried to find parking. It was 5 blocks away and it was freezing cold. Let's just say, parking isn't easy to find. \n\nReservations. I made a reservations through yelp. It was easy and convenient and I got seated right away. If you know you're coming here, make the reservation. Only downside is you must put a card down, if you're over 15 minutes late, they charge you and if you don't cancel within 24 hours they charge you $10 for each person you reserved. Only beneficial if you know you're coming FOR SURE. \n\nFood. \n-Oven roasted crab: 5/5\nA whole crab drenched in butter, garlic, salt and pepper. Amazing! I love dipping my crab into the buttery sauce. As of 9/15/18 one crab goes for the price of $62. My boyfriend doesn't eat crab so my parents and I shared two thinking that was enough, we ended up adding another crab. So if you're coming and wanna really indulge, get a crab per person. \n\n-Shaken beef: 3/5\nBeing Vietnamese, shaken beef is one of my favorite and this didn't really meet up to my standards. It was good and flavorful but they added diced potatoes. In my opinion if i'm paying $25 I would expect more than 9-10 small diced pieces of meat, and I would prefer meat than diced potatoes. \n\n-Garlic noodles: 5/5\nVery flavorful and delicious. Great to pair with the crab. \n\n-Fried rice: 3/5\nIt was good, but nothing special. Fried rice was fried rice. \n\n-Fried bananas with vanilla ice cream: 4/5\nGreat way to end your meal. Fried banana topped with ice cream and a hit of chocolate sauce. \n\nService: 5/5\nWe got our food super quick. We had a server, and we had people stop by the table to fill up our water constantly and change our crab shell bowls. Let's just say my water cup was always full and my crab shell bowl didn't reach half way full.

The waitress seemed to have an attitude, or a problem with us as she was very curt.  It wasn't appreciated.  She answered our questions and left very promptly making us as the customer feel like \"wow we're sorry for even asking questions\". Their signature garlic noodles was not their best to put it nicely.  The food was almost bland, their Wok noodles were the tastiest part of the meal even though the chicken was alarmingly dry.  The other chicken dish we had was good until the sauce fully absorbed into the chicken.  The sauce made the chicken obtain a rather spicy taste, for a member of our party. The waiters and bussers were very professional and courteous, nicer than our waitress by far.  I wish I could write a better review, but I feel this is a training opportunity.  The best thing about their food... desert, they have a lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream, absolutely gorgeous!  Probably the most interesting thing, was how our waitress attempted to sass us as we asked about the surcharge. We asked about their surcharge as we are visiting and have not experienced this in any place of business we have been to.  She started stating \"oh you've been charged this at many establishments before, there is a bill that was past a very long time ago.\"  When we asked for more information \"oh just google it...\" as she walked away.  Really?  So this establishment does charge a surcharge if you use your credit card.  Raising the bill by $5.41.

Upon entering, I had 3 out of a party of 5 and there is a strict rule saying that parties that are more than 10 minutes late  will automatically be put on the waitlist. That's normal - totally OK with that - but there were so many open tables and so many people in the waiting area, it made me think \"are all these people waiting really just partial parties?\" The waiting area is super small; we were all shoulder to shoulder with each other and bumping elbows. The other 2 in our party came within the 10 minutes (we made a reservation via Yelp! but didn't get any Cash Back rewards for it like I was expecting..) and we ordered the salt and pepper calamari, mango salad, and Vietnamese salad (both salads had very little vegetables and just a lot of fluff / fruit) as appetizers. For entrees, we got colossal tiger prawns (yes they were big but only enough for 1 prawn per person o.o), Roast Crab, Thanh Long Fish and Spicy Eggplant. Portions were PUNY and off-putting... furthermore, our waiter got a little sassy with us and when I reminded him we had a birthday, he snapped back and said \"Yeah, you tell your waiter which is ME and you already told me\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-22", "description": "Fried Calamari\n\nI still want to give them 5 Stars. The Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles never fail to impress. My family were able to come for the first time since I've been talking about Thanh Long for many years now. The crab has so much pepper, that at first glance, it looks to be too much. But it's perfectly seasoned. And the Garlic Noodles has just the right combination of garlic and sauce making it a perfect accompaniment to the Crab.\n\nMy only complaint is that although I've had the Fried Calamari many times previously, it was no where near the same level. First of all the Salt and Pepper was well balanced. \n\nThe key to great Fried Calamari is the balance of the squid surrounded by a light crispy crust. This squid was so thinly cut that there was little to no tasting of the squid. The moisture of the larger amount of sauted green beans, chopped red bell peppers and onions mixed with the Calamari rendered it a bit soggy. There were only about 8, maybe 9 pieces of Calamari on the dish with about a full cup of the veggies.\n\nToo many restaurants are adding superfluous ingredients that don't really add anything, but only make it look like a generous serving.\n\nSadly, Thanh Long used this technique to bulk up our serving of the Calamari. They did however, give us a second plate with the same result.\n\nP.S. The service has always been excellent and remains top notch!", "author": "Sandi L."}

This is not your typical place to get pho, in fact they don't have it!\n\nThanh Long is more of a seafood restaurant offering large dishes you can share family style. Most of the options run around $20, and the crabs will be around $50 each. Portions are on the smaller side. We shared 2 crabs, one serving of noodles, 3 large plates and a dessert between 4 people.\n\nThe restaurant is quite spacious and our waiter was very friendly. She helped clear our plates out since we practically overflowered our table! When I ordered I made sure to get all the popular dishes.\n\nSTARTERS \n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari - In a light salt and pepper batter, seasoned with scallions and red peppers. These were a great pick!\n\nSOUPS\n\nVermicelli Noodle Consomme - Chicken, green onions, cilantro. The soup was clean tasting and good, the chicken was tender but I would've liked the noodles to have been the more traditional pho noodles rather than clear ones.\n\nLARGE PLATES\n\nShaken Beef - Tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes. I'm not a beef person but this seemed good as well. Ours didn't come with potatoes though, but with onions.\n\nLemongrass Chicken - Slices of chicken sauteed with seasonal vegetables, garlic & chili. Pretty impressed by this one! Would order again for sure.\n\nSECRET KITCHEN DISHES \n\nRoast Crab - A whole Dungeness crab roasted with An's garlic sauce & secret spices.\n\nGarlic Noodles - An's famous noodles made with our special garlic sauce & secret spices. Super flavorful and very memorable. \n\nDESSERT \n\nFried banana a la mode - With vanilla ice cream. For $8, the portions for the fried banana was tiny! The vanilla ice cream was way too frozen when served to us. There also was way too much whipped cream.\n\nFor the price point I would expect Thanh Long to be a more classy and upscale looking restaurant. It was great overall, but a bit on the pricier side for me. I would probably come on more special occasions.", "author": "Chelsea W."}

The Vietnamese Salad or \"Goi\" should have more herbs.\nThe famous garlic noodles was not all that.  Saturate your noodles in butter and garlic powder and you will have the same thing at home.\nThe shaken beef was not tender and lack of sauce of a traditional \"B\u00f2 l\u00fac lc\"\nAnd finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, tamarind crab was a greasy mess served on a puddle of clarified butter.

The garlic noodle was also tasty, garlicky but not too overpowering. We also ordered the combination fried rice, which was just okay. The star of the show was the crab. As far as customer service- for the most part they were very attentive. They also gave us warm wet towels at the end. The only thing was my partner did not get his coffee until almost end of our meal. We were the first ones to arrive there but I guess they were still brewing coffee. I asked for a straw but didn't get it at all but I didn't push it since they were super busy. Overall, I came there for the crab and it was delicious so no complaint there. Pricey crab though.

A huge grab roasted with copious amounts of butter and seasoned with salt and pepper. The meat is tender and the crab shell cracks open easily.\n\nGarlic Noodles - It tastes exactly how it sounds. Every bite has a big garlic flavor with a touch of sweetness. My best guess is the sweetness comes from also cooking the noodles in crab juices.\n\n\nYou already know you're in for a delicious meal right when you open the door. An olfactory wave of butter, garlic, and seafood will flood your senses. Just the walk to your table you'll notice everyone has an order of the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles. Thang Long keeps it simple, the dishes are straightforward and orient around shellfish. \n\nThanh Long is one of those Asian restaurants that's been around the block a few times. It has a presence that feels like it stuck to it's guns and succeeded in becoming a permanent fixture in the Sunset neighborhood. There is an old school but upscale charm with Thanh Long which reminds of what people refer to as the \"Golden Age\" of dining. Much of the ornamentation is Vietnamese inspired, from the Lotus petal pendant lights, to the large dragon mural hanging from the wall, and who can forget the stereotypical dark red furniture. Overall, the antiquated atmosphere of Thanh Long compliments the cuisine well. \n\nEven though Thanh Long is a Vietnamese restaurant, the dishes we ordered did not have that signature Vietnamese flavor. Instead, the dishes are simple, straight forward, and served fast. For example, the Roast Crab is literally roasted crab with butter, salt, and pepper. In my opinion, creating a simple good tasting dish is much more difficult as their is more room for error and judgment. What Thanh Long does well is make these seemingly simple dishes taste amazing. \n\nThanh Long is a bit on the pricey side as you'll probably need to order one Roast Crab per person. The food tastes great but I feel this restaurant is meant for a special or celebratory occasion.", "author": "Julian L."}

To be honest, we only picked Thanh Long because PPQ (the actual crab restaurant we wanted to try) was unexpectedly closed. Originally, we made a reservation for 6:30PM but thought we needed more time to get there/find parking so we called at 5PM and they let us change our reservation to 7PM instead. Luckily, we were able to find parking about a block down and decided to come earlier (6:45PM). The server said that we have to wait until our reservation which is totally understandable. We were seated within 10 minutes. \n\n For starters, I decided to try the Mango Salad after seeing many Yelpers rave about it. It has bell peppers, scallops (couldn't find any), and shrimps (previously frozen) mixed with greens. It smelled and tasted good but was very oily! Not your typical *healthy* salad. \nFor the main courses, we got the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles (obviously!). Ooooh my god the crab was so good! The crab was so buttery I think my heart almost gave out. How did they make the meat inside taste so buttery though!? The garlic noodles were pretty bland but drenched in butter. The menu states that the noddles were made with \"secret spices\"... does that mean no spice at all because it was honestly so bland. \n~ I was so full after this but my *amazing* bf decided to get me a chocolate lava cake anyway because \"we have to have cake on your birthday!\"~\nThe lava cake was way too sweet but I didn't mind because I was in such a good mood. \nThen the check came...  This restaurant is honestly reserved for special occasions only because wow... the crab itself costed about $68+? *dead* I'm sorry babe \nAll in all, I was blown away by the crab (and the price tag on it) but everything else was mediocre.", "author": "Trang T."}

The flavor of the crab meat is insanely delicious; it melts in your mouth, is deliciously buttery, and the roasting adds some complexity to the flavor that makes it even more tasty. The crabs themselves have a ton of meat, especially in the giant legs and claws! It's definitely a messy, use your hands sort of thing (they provide bibs!) but that's part of the fun of the experience! \n\nThe garlic noodles are cooked perfectly, and are just the right amount of garlicky. I also got a glass of wine that was reasonably priced (less than $10) for a generous pour. It was a decadent, satisfying meal! \n\nThe restaurant itself doesn't look like much from the outside, but has a more upscale Asian restaurant type ambience inside. It's a huge space with two levels of seating. We were seated upstairs and received excellent service from the staff, who answered all our questions, brought the food at a good pace, helped us with bibs, refilled water often and were just generally friendly. \n\nWhen all was said and done, I didn't feel like this was all that expensive for the quality of the food and how stuffed I was (~$50/pp for a drink, crab and noodles), which was a nice bonus too!", "author": "Christine G."}

But don't let this take away from the dish as a whole. The mango salad includes chopped shrimp, bell peppers and we were pleasantly surprised to find bits of chopped scallops all tossed together in a raspberry vinaigrette.\n\nThe main attraction was the garlic noodles and the full Dungeness crabs. The garlic noodles, though seemingly plain, are packed with a lot of flavor and for those who love garlic, you won't be disappointed. And while the roasted crab is the crowd favorite, we opted for the crab prepared with tamarind sauce instead.

Thanh Long is the original Crustacean restaurant, also sister restaurant to Anqi in OC. Most of you may know of the popular Crustaceans restaurant; Thanh Long has the same menu with a more casual atmosphere. Crustacean is a fancier and more romantic ambience. Great for dates and special events. Here, at Thanh Long, you can dress up and bring a date or come in jeans and be ready to dig in to your food! It's always busy, so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time!\n\nI absolutely LOVE their Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles. They were like the first to ever come out with the garlic noodles before other places started copying them. It goes so well with the buttery, peppery, fingerlickin' Roast Crab! For those who don't know, they serve you the whole crab, head and all! You break the legs apart and just dig in with your fingers and hands. It's soo good! The way they cooked it has the flavor soaked throughout the crab and you're just busy Iickin' and peelin' and eatin'! It's definitely messy, and time consuming to eat this, but you leave feeling so happy and satisfied! Omg I already want more just thinking about it! \n\nMy other favorites are the mussels appetizer (very buttery), fried crab cheese puffs, and salt & pepper calamari (crispy).

This place is great for a dinner date but because it's not super romantic due to the fact that they stay so busy, it also works for a small group of  friends or family. \n\nMy number one tip make reservations! Also you can find parking if you're willing to walk a few blocks sometimes it is worth it to save that almost $20 valet parking. They open at 5 it's always easier to get in and out if you go right when they open. If not just make those reservations ahead of time. Either way, despite the crowd, once you get seated the wait for the food is never too long.\n\nThe food is definitely the highlight. I consider trying new things everytime I go. I've heard good things about the Charbroiled Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns and the Mango Salad but once I get there my old faithful selection summons my soul. My wife and I get 2 Roast Garlic Crab, Garlic Noodles and we split the Crab Puff appetizer. All the dipping butter you need for your crab is right on your plate. I swear the flavor is something special especially worth the black pepper they add to the garlic butter. And the flavor is just not in the butter or on the shell but it's in the meat of the crab. That's hard to come by.\n\nThe staff is very attentive at they keep close eye on your bowl that you place your shells in. As soon as the bowl fills up there and there to swap it out for a new one.

We did so and was not disappointed.  Two instances in which Thanh Long blew me away... the first was food, clean and flavorful in every dish and bite.  The most mentioned item in all reviews and neighboring tables was the garlic roasted crab, so of course I had to opted for it.  Albeit, $59.95 for a Dungeness crab is steep - like nearly unreasonably expensive, $40-45 would have been reasonable.  However it was quite delicious.  Each bite was full of crab meat and an abundance of flavor, my fingers were dripping with garlic butter and black pepper sauce.  I finished my crab and the garlic fried rice and happily licked my fingers with no shame afterwards.  \nThe second thing that blew me away - the service, impeccable.  Never had to wave our waiter down for plates to be cleared, waters to be refilled, checks to be brought.  But the one thing that they did that has NEVER happened anywhere I've ever dined at before... a waiter who was walking by noticed our table was a bit wobbly and without hesitation, excused himself to get to the lower legs of the table and fixed it for us before carrying on with his duties.  I know it's not a serious gesture but the attention to detail and the willingness to care for it really blows my mind.\n\nOverall - I like the place.

The guys in valet were friendly.

We had two roast crabs and the one cooked with wine. Hands-down the roast crab was everyone's favorite. \n\nThe sea bass was tender but lacked seasoning - a little salt could have helped. The bok choy on this plate was yummy. One of my friends is a country boy from Georgia and he had his first taste of bok choy at this restaurant.

Thanh Long is a Vietnamese-fusion restaurant that serves refined Vietnamese and upscale seafood dishes, and I came with a group of four for dinner on a Saturday night. After a short wait, we were seated in the spacious, bright dining room by our friendly server.\n\nIt didn't take us long to decide on what classic dishes to get; the mango salad was fascinating--half cooked and half raw, it came with mango, bell peppers, and shrimp, and was a nice refreshing dish to contrast with the other heavier dishes. Of course, we got the roasted crab, which was covered in butter and seasoning and was delicious--it was surprisingly easy to peel, as the shell seemed somewhat softer than other crabs I've had. The garlic noodles were drenched in butter and absolutely decadent, and the shaking beef was fantastic as well--the filet cubes were tender and cooked a nice medium rare, and the sear and marinade on the beef imparted a nice umami flavor.\n\nOverall, this was an extremely enjoyable meal in a lively setting with quick and friendly service. The only drawback was the high price point for the dishes--the moderately-sized crab was over $50, and you could probably get the other more typical Vietnamese dishes elsewhere for much cheaper.

Thanh Long is known for their Vietnamese Roasted Crab for the over 40yrs we've been coming here, but tonight was a big disappointment celebrating our youngest daughter's graduation dinner here. We ordered 3 roasted crab tonight for 4 adults and 2 kids. Also had the salt and pepper calamari appetizer, 2 orders of garlic noodles, shakin beef and villager's special. One crab was perfect but small, 2nd crab was skinny (light weight and the tiny meat fell away from the shell), and the 3rd crab was not fresh (meat no longer had the fresh texture, mushy). I may have not come here the last 2yrs, but we used to get a fat plump and juicy crab... 2lbs minimum on each order. There was no comparison with any other restaurant when it comes to crab. Prime rib is to House of Prime Rib as Roasted Dungeness Crab is to Thanh Long. They certainly was a huge disappointment tonight. I use to say don't worry about price, it's worth the experience to have Thanh Long Roasted Crab if you haven't had it. The 3 disappointing crabs we had was not worth the $170 that we paid. It wouldn't be even worth half as they just lossed the wow factor tonight that what made Thanh Long famous for crab.\n\nService was great as usual and the dishes met our expectations. Garlic noodles is still what it is, to die for. Overprice crab was a total failure. Sorry, but my wife, my daughter and I love crab. Tonight was the most disappointing crab dinner we've ever had. What was interesting is I read other 3 star reviews saying the quality of their has fallen last few visits.", "author": "Kmaintl L."}

Having great food and success doesn't mean you drop your customer service and start treating people however you hell you feel like treating them. They need the owner to take a look at some of the people here. Still sure am craving some crab, but it's okay, I'll save up for the better restaurant, Crustaceans.

The valet cost $12 (a little pricey, but that's SF for you) and the guy who did the valet was not the most pleasant person. Once inside, we were greeted by the host and the manager. They were busy with large parties but we were only a party of 3 and were sat right away. The server brought water out and gave us a chance to look over the menu. \n\nWe ordered Calamari, Mango Salad, Chicken fried Rice, Saigon Beef & Lemongrass Chicken. \nThe food was delicious, perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, meat was juicy and tender!

Best crab in SF, hands down!\n\nWhen you first roll up to this place, it's at the corner in the Sunset District. It looks like a hole in the wall joint, but the moment you walk in, it's kinda upscale. White tablecloth, cute little bar in the front, and seating everywhere from downstairs to upstairs. Never knew about their upstairs because we always stay downstairs. Its dim and crowded, but its poppin! The food here is AHHHHHMAZING!!!\n\nI got the garlic roasted crab. The prices vary during the seasons, but the crab is usually somewhere around $50. But its huge, meaty, and tasty! Worth every penny. The galric noodles go great with it too, and that's what my family and I usually get. Our last visit, there were 8 of us and our bill was $300+! Its pricey, but for this crab, it's soooo worth it. \n\nThe service here is FAST! Since we always know what we want, we order the minute we sit down. And 10mins later, our appetizers are there, garlic noodles, and crab! I love that they're fast and they cater to your needs. They put a bib on u if you'll be eating crab, then they even give u warm wash cloths after to clean your hands. Also they are quick to clean up after you, constanty taking the done scraps, and bringing new bowls to put the new scraps in. We always order extra garlic noodles because we live out of town and we want to take some home with us. The calamari is super crispy and NOT too breaded which makes it all worth getting two orders of. =)\n\nThis place is a MUST when visiting SF! Make sure you call ahead of time and make reservations because they get super packed and busy. You can also make reservations thru the yelp app which makes it all that MORE convenient!

But as the years went on, I'm becoming less impressed with this place. \n\nThe last two times I've been here, the service has been subpar. On my previous visit before tonight, I had a waitress who was not very friendly and lacked social skills. I want to feel welcomed, especially if I'm paying a crap load of money on a great meal. Tonight I had a waiter who would only talk to me and would not acknowledge my grandma (can we say awkward and weird). \n\nOn my previous visit, I received my crab way before my garlic noodles. Uhhhhh I would like to eat my HOT crab with my HOT garlic noodles. I don't want COLD crab with HOT garlic noodles. Tonight after my grandma and I ordered, we literally received our food 5 minutes later. Either the chef was able to whip up 2 roasted crabs and 2 orders of garlic noodles in under two minutes or they just reheated our food and served it to us (hmmmm). \n\nAs far as the food, it does not excite me as much as it use to. My roasted crab was pretty good, but it lacked garlic and was more peppery and salty (and greasy af). My garlic noodles were good but not as good as I remember them being. I also want to mention that my food went cold pretty quickly (that's what happens when you reheat food...let me stop lol).\n\nI will say there are some good appetizers like the salt and pepper calamari and the shrimp toast. I also like their fried rice and heard their mango salad is delicious as well. I've had the Tiger Prawns on garlic noodles and it was really good (it was my very first meal here).\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to someone who has never experienced the infamous roasted crab and garlic noodles or just want to say they've been here.

It is a small corner restaurant with an Asian touch to attract non-Asian, fusion food seekers who's got money to burn. \n\nThe price is ridiculously high compared to much better view/better food restaurants nearby such as the Cliff house. The garlic noodles look so bad that even cup noodles coming out of Safeway look better.  The deep fried egg roll has only 4 pieces which were cut out from 2 egg rolls. The combo noodles look nothing better, either. With a price 10 times higher than a nearby Chinese seafood restaurant, one would expect great presentation of food and excellent tastes. Although the taste is generally good, with one tenth of the price, you can easily get equivalent food if not better. \n\nService is equally low class. Servers jump out from no where collecting plates on the table without asking if you are done in an obvious attempt to get you out as fast as possible so that they can seat anther group. They just take away source plates when everyone is still working on the egg rolls. With such a high price, you would expect excellent service. But no, the service, the food portion, the food presentation, the environment, none of these can match up even a mile close to their price. \n\nIt is also very hard to find parking around that area. Valet parking is 20 dollars for SUVs and $13 for non-SUVs.\n\nIn summary, the owner of this restaurant must think that folks living in this neighborhood are foolish rich suckers; or they must believe that they are already a Michelin 3-star celebrity.

The crab seems really popular so that was a must get when my friends and I came for dinner. We got the roast crab, along with garlic noodles, spicy eggplants, shaken beef, salt and pepper calamari, and catch in citrus.\n\nThe crab was underwhelming. It tasted like it was just boiled in water. I didn't taste any garlic. \n\nThe rest of the food we ordered was good. The catch is citrus and shaken beef was my favorite. The beef was very tender and juicy. The sauce on the fish was delicious! The sauce combination was very unique. I've never thought about using orange sauce with fish. \n\nI'd come back to try other stuff on their menu but will definitely opt out of their crab. If you want good crab, let me introduce you to this one restaurant on Noriega called New Hing Lung. The crab is fried with egg yolk and pumpkin. It's amazing.", "author": "Michelle T."}

Came here the other night with a friend of mine because I wanted Crab. \n\nMade a reservation for 7 and was seated right away when we go there.  The restaurant was fairly empty at that time and remains quite the same when we left (maybe because it was a Tuesday).\n\nOrdered:\n\nSoft Shelf Crab appetizer dish - served on a bed of tradition Vietnamese salad (which looks like shredded cabbage).  The crab was good with the tamarind-chili sauce.  The salad was very bitter.  I had like 2 bits and wasn't about to eat anymore because it was so bitter. \n\nGarlic Noodles - I remember this dish being really good in the past.  However, this is not as good as I remember it to be.  It was good, but not delicious.  The portion for this was pretty decent.  \n\nGarlic Crab - we ordered one to share.  The crab legs were not cracked so the sauce they use on the crab isn't in the legs.  IMO, I thought this just tasted a little bit better than normal boiled crab with lots of butter.  Licking the spices that was stuck on the shell was pretty good, but the meat was lacking the garlic taste even when I was dipping it in the drippings.\n\nOverall, the food here was just alright.  The service was excellent.  Our server was very attentive.  When I mentioned about the bitterness in the salad, they brought it back to the kitchen and offered us another appetizer.", "author": "Ashley L."}

Like everyone else, I've heard lots of good things so I was really looking forward to it. Maybe I got my hopes up too high but I was underwhelmed. The outrageous prices also didn't help. One crab for $56 bucks. 4 prawns and noodles for $39. If it was mind blowing maybe it would justify the prices but my mind nor my socks were blown off.\n\nThe roasted crab ($56) was the best dish of the night. It was good, not great. \nPrawns ($39) were under seasoned compared to the crab. The noodles that came with it were ok.\nGarlic rice ($9) was better than the garlic noodles IMO. It also went better with the crab.\nCalamari ($13) was good but under seasoned.\nShrimp toast ($12) was the worst dish of the night. The toast wasn't toasted enough. It was really bready. Would recommend skipping this.  \n\nThere is a mandatory 18% tip for all party sizes. It doesn't bother us since we tip regardless but service might be better if it wasn't mandatory. Service was fine but for the prices they charge, I expected better. They did their job but it lacked care, warmth and friendliness. \n\nWith the taxes and tip the bill came close to $200 for two of us. No drinks, we only had two sodas (no refills).\n\nThey do have valet for $12 but if you circle around, you might find street parking.", "author": "Andy W."}

Because of this rich history, I think they are slightly starting to rest on their laurels and not giving quite the effort that brought them all the attention. \n\nLet's start with the basics, the crabs are the things to get here. You can eat other stuff but there needs to be a crab as part of your order.  They don't come cheap either; market price for my recent visit was slightly above 50 dollars per crab.  My family got the roasted garlic and drunken one, which is a funny way of saying champagne and alcohol flavored.  I preferred the roasted garlic one but wish they had served up some baguettes or something so I could soak up the crab back juices. Sounds gross but it's delicious!  The drunken one was okay but nothing to rave about. I would not order again. For our party of 5, 2 crabs was filling enough.  We also got the shaken beef and fried calamari.  Both were decent but my preference would have been to have some rice with either dishes, which weren't available.  Oh well, blame it on my being too Asian.\n\nTwo people helped wait on our table and the service was really split.  One lady seemed like we were bothering her while the man checked on us often.  Inconsistency is probably their theme these days as evident by the other reviews on here. Five stars here with a few 1 and 2 star reviews there.

Honestly I wouldn't have gone out of my way to come here if I didn't live nearby. My friends and I decided that we wanted to try Thanh Long, so of course, I made reservations weeks in advance. Not sure how possible it is to walk into this restaurant and get seated that evening.\n\nI'm so shocked by how big this restaurant is! It seems to take up the whole block with its upstairs and downstairs areas. Actually I assumed that there were just apartments on top of the restaurant. We were seated upstairs in the back corner. The red walls were rather off-putting. Took awhile for my eyes to adjust.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and prompt. He took our drink orders right away and answered questions about the menu. Whatever cocktail I ended up getting lacked alcohol completely. It was undetectable. Tasted like juice. My roommate's did too. Such a disappointing waste of money.\n\nFor food, my friend and I split a crab and an order of garlic noodles. Loved the garlic noodles and flavor of the crab, but the crab was rather small for the amount we paid. We had a crab cooking night a few months back, and that was way more satisfying and cost efficient. The spices were on point though.\n\nOverall I'm glad I got to try Thanh Long, but I don't think it's a place worth putting on your San Francisco bucket list.

It's humongous and I'm still in awe. This taste good with the garlic noodles too! I put the garlic noodles in the big shell of the crab to give it more flavor.

And I understand the premium put on it because of the secret recipe and seasonality and all that.  (For reference, for a visit in December 2016, the price of the Roast Crab was $55 pre-tax) \n\nBut do the rest of the dishes also have to be that over-priced?  We ordered the spicy eggplant and prawn dish, which cost $20.  I was expecting humongous prawns. But there weren't even enough prawns to go around (and we only had four people).  This dish at any other asian restaurant would have been half the price.  \n\nI suppose it was worth the experience, but If I'm going to pay for really expensive crab, I think I'd rather the salt and pepper version at R&G Lounge.", "author": "Alison L."}

I will take seafood any day than meat and this place meets my expectations continuously.  Although, they have very limited parking because it is in the city and around a residential area, they provide Valet!  I recommend valet unless you get lucky enough to park in front of the restaurant but goodluck!  Its either street parking or valet because they don't have a private lot.\n\nWhen we go here, we usually dress more business casual but it totally doesn't matter, you'll get your hands dirty anyways.  The outside of the restaurant doesn't look very pleasing/fancy but the inside looks 10x better!  We ALWAYS ALWAYS make a reservation because they get very busy, especially during the weekends.  The waiting area is quite small but they have a full bar where you can sit, wait, and have a drink.  The restaurant isn't the biggest and it gets a little tight in there, but fortunately, they do have an upstairs area.\n\nTheir customer service here is perfect.  They aren't overwhelming, but they are quick to refill your water, and they're always walking around, that way if you need something they're easily accessible.  Everyone is quick, friendly, Americanized (no racial) and professional.\n\nThe food is astounding!  We start off with ordering the Salt & Pepper Calamari, sounds plain, but it's the most flavorful calamari ever.  My boyfriend and I always share 1 crab because they are HUGE with lots of meat.  There are different flavors of crab but our favorite is the Roast Crab.  We've tried the others but Roast Crab is my all-time favorite.  We order garlic noodles on the side and the fried banana with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  The traditional Vietnamese salad and mango salad is bomb, very light but good.  If you do want to order some type of meat, the Shaken beef is super tender and melts in your mouth!  EVERYTHING IS JUST DELICIOUS AND HEAVENLY.\n\nThe food is comparable to PPQ, if you've ever been there, however, Thanh Long is more expensive but you get what you pay for!  I think PPQ is more on the casual side but if you want to be a little fancier, Thanh Long is the place.\n\nYou will not walk out of here disappointed!", "author": "Precious Ethel P."}

Finally it's my turn for a friend's bday dinner at Thanh Long, and to my surprise, it was NOT that good.\n\nOn a Wednesday night, didn't make reservations, was ready for a long line but luckily we grabbed the last 2-seat table.\n\n#Thanh Long Mussels: B.\nIt came with 5 mussels and each with a piece of bread at the bottom. While the garlic and green onion smelled and tasted pretty good - it was too buttery. Way too much butter that after 3 minutes when it got a little cooler a layer of fat from the butter formed around the shell of the mussels. The mussels themselves were pretty fresh though.\n\n#Roasted Crab: B.\nThis was the main dish and I had high expectation, but ended up in disappointment. Again there was a lot (not excessive this time) in the sauce, but problem was this roasted crab lacked black pepper or whatever that should have made the crab more \"roasted\". And if it was lack of taste on the outside already, needless to say the meat inside was pretty bland. At least the meat was fresh though.\n\n#Garlic Noodles: B-.\nThis was the biggest disappointment of the night. I was very looking forward to that as I heard so many good things about this dish from this place.... but there was like almost zero garlic taste..... like 1% and I'm not even exaggerating. It did taste okay, the noodle was springy, it just shouldn't be called \"garlic\" noodle though.\n\nWe also got a banana foster as dessert at the end and it was alight. Service on that night was good, a little pricy for that quality of food. Not planning to come back again, but would down to try PPQ which is supposedly another good one, hopefully it will be better there.", "author": "Simon C."}

Everyone loves the roasted crab and garlic noodles, without a doubt. I love eating here with a big group of people because no one else will eat the juices/fat/meat out of their crab heads, where as I will go to town on them. I've had meals here where I don't even order anything but garlic noodles, since I am able to completely sustain myself on everyone's discarded crab heads. (TMI?) My husband and I think one crab is more than enough to share though, when it's just the two of us.\n\nThere is definitely more to Thanh Long's menu than their delicious crab and garlic noodles . There are still a lot of other mouthwatering options on the menu for those non-crab fans (who are you!?!?), those allergic to shellfish (understandable) or those looking to save some money (those crabs are a pretty penny). \n\nOther menu favorites:\n\n-Shrimp Toast: shrimp pate on crispy bread appetizer when you just can't wait to gorge\n-Tiger Garlic Prawns: I think of this as a thanh-long \"light\" menu. You get your garlic noodles and 4 pieces of prawns, with the same garlic flavor as the crab, but cheaper. \n-Shaken Beef: tender and well-seasoned for you land lover's\n-Banana Cake: I love banana cakes and they do it right here!\n\nI've always found it easy to get a reservation here, but sometimes even with a reservations, there's a bit of a wait once you arrive. Make sure your entire party is present or they will not seat you. I prefer the atmosphere here to that of PPQ.

My family and I were happy customers at our visit at Thanh Long until I had left overs for lunch the next day... We ordered the crab, king prawns, appetizers, and garlic noodles. We had noodles left over and our waiter asked if we wanted to pack it up to go we said yes so he took our plates back to the kitchen to pack it up.... Went to work and it was lunch time so I was excited to warm up my food and sat down ready to dig in. As I took about 3 bites I see something dark in there and come to my surprise it was a knot of hair.. not one strand it was like if someone took it out of a brush and placed it in there or it had fallen on the floor and the waiter just packed it up without saying anything to anyone. I was in complete disbelief and shock. I literally wanted to throw up. I decided to call the store manager and spoke to Dang Vu. All he can do was apologize and he did take my word for it. All he could say was I've never heard this before and only has heard of one strand but never a full knot. He only offered to give me free drinks or noodles if I ever go back which I highly doubt I will EVER. My coworkers and friends raved about this place and don't get me wrong it was good but couldn't believe what happened towards the end. I was I would have checked it before leaving. You just don't expect for this to happen. Dang said he would investigate further. I'm trying to be understanding but I really hope he investigates.

This place started the Viet seafood craze before it became fashionable.  TL is located on Judah b/t 46th & 47th in the Outer Sunset (3 blocks from beach).  Sister restaurants are Crustacean on Polk in SF and in Beverly Hills.\n\nFor six of us, we ordered 2 of each of the following, unless noted otherwise:  Salt & pepper calamari ($11.95); Soft shell crab ($12.25); Garlic toast ($3.75); Spicy eggplant w/ shrimp (19.25); Lemon grass chicken ($19.25); Saigon beef ($24.95 - one); Bo luc lac ($25.50 - one); Garlic noodles ($10.95 - three); and Roasted crab ($48.95 - market price).\n\nFirst of all, the calamari was very good.  It had excellent flavor and was not greasy.  The only downside was the price:  4 Stars.  Secondarily, the soft shell crab was a tad overcooked and overpriced.  Nonetheless, is tasted good:  3 Stars.  Thirdly, the garlic toast was OK.  It didn't taste that garlicky.  We would have been better off with the mussels served on toast:  3 Stars.\n\nFor our main courses, the spicy eggplant was very good.  The eggplant was firm and not overcooked like many restaurants.  Downsides were there wasn't much shrimp and the price:  3 Stars.  Secondarily, the chicken was colorful, but the lemongrass really didn't stand out.  It too was overpriced:  3 Stars.  Our first beef dish didn't really do anything to excite us.  The flavor was OK, but like the other dishes, it was overpriced:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the second beef dish was tender and nicely seasoned.  The only downside was the price:  4 Stars.  \n\nOur last two dishes, were the best.  TL's version of garlic noodles are the best I have had.  The noodles were al dente, weren't drowned in sauce, and the amount of garlic flavor was perfect.  No wonder so many places try to copy this dish:  5+++ Stars.  Secondarily, the roasted crab was excellent.  I used the head as a bowl.  The meat was moist and wonderfully seasoned.  It wasn't as good as R & G in Chinatown, but it still was one of the two best dishes of the evening:  5 Stars.\n\nRegarding the service, it was outstanding.  Our waitress was excellent, and took very good care of us.  She didn't write any of our orders down (inc drinks), and didn't miss anything.  The food came out quickly, and we were constantly given new bowls for our crab shells:  5 Stars.  On the other hand, the ambiance was just OK.  This place is a quaint cozy place.  However, the bathroom was kinda dirty, and the valet was expensive at $12:  3 Stars.\n\nI'd definitely come back here, but I'd stick to the seafood and garlic noodles that are excellent.  The turf dishes are not that good.  Lastly, most of the prices are high, but I was pretty full without the chicken, eggplant and soft shell crab that we added later.", "author": "Joe P."}

I feel like this restaurant is a San Francisco institution! It was packed on a Sunday evening, but we were seated immediately thanks to Yelp Reservations. Our party of four was stuffed from: roasted crab, prawns over garlic noodles, mango salad, and shaking beef. We then stuffed ourselves some more with dessert: fried banana with vanilla ice cream and a caramel cheesecake. Everything was amazing, but I'm definitely still dreaming of roasted crab and garlic noodles.

Knowing how pricey this establishment is, i've avoided the hype and thought i'll wait. Well, I finally cave with my girlfriends and decided to try the infamous roast crab.\n\nFirst and foremost, yes..your wallet will empty out after eating here. Portions are small, but food.. although I don't want to admit are very flavorful and delicious. \n\nAmongst 3 girls we ordered the following:\n\n-famous garlic roast crab: It was around $45-50 for the crab, but if you order anything THIS is it. The crab was perfectly infused with garlicky goodness above a bed of infused butter. This was so yummy and for 3 girls, it was enough to share.\n\n-shaken beef: one of the dishes that lots of folks recommended on yelp. The piece of beef were very tender. Great execution, but i've definitely had better at another joint for cheaper.\n\n-eggplant: the sauce of this was pretty damn bomb. A little more on the sweeter side, but eve my friend that normally don't like the texture of eggplant thoroughly enjoyed this dish. If you want some type of veggie, this is a good complement to the meal.\n\n-garlic noodles: I would say besides the crab, this is the other \"must order\" according to all the reviewers. For me, it was good...but i really dont get the hype? hehe.\n\nServices was on point. Make sure you make a reservation. Around dinner time the wait definitely can get long.\n\nThe 3 of us finished all the food and was quite filled.", "author": "Diane T."}

I kept raving to my boyfriend from Detroit about the noodles. So we get there and get seated right away cool...but then I had to go to the bathroom and mind you this restaurant closes down to reopen at 5pm for dinner...went inside and someone used the bathroom and didn't flush- ugh! Okay I can kind of over look this seeing that the bathroom wasn't dirty and smelled decent. But to know that the bathroom wasn't refreshed before the dinner shift did leave an unsettling feeling. So I go back to my seat and we go over the menu and order. I wanted to order the crab but when you yourself buy and cook crab and see the prices they were charging you scratch your head and wonder why are is the price so high? $60 for a whole crab??? Really when I can go to Safeway, luckys or Winco and buy and whole crab $4.99 - $6.99... get the heck out of here with this. So I settled for what they call the Seafood combination with scallops, prawns and crabmeat. Along with some shrimp fried rice. So they bring the shrimp fried rice out.....and 2 other plates of rice. Then the waiter comes out and asks how our food is,I'm looking around and say great, I'm just waiting for my Seafood combination and that's when he drops the bomb telling me the plate full of rice is the combo plate... shut my mouth!! I told him the fried rice and the combo plate looked identical to one another. I was truly blown away. I'm thinking like Red Lobster or some other seafood restaurant where you can truly see the scallops, prawns in your dish....what they call a Seafood Combo are tiny pieces of prawns, crab meat and scallops....microscopic sizes. I just couldn't believe it. All the way from Concord for this.....basically a bowl rice. I'm still speechless. I'm just assuming those that come here don't really cook their own crab (less thank 15min folks and damn sure less tha $60 per crab). Needless to say we were all disappointed and figured the noodles would make up for it...but nope they didn't. We definitely will not be venturing back to this spot. Maybe this is why it took us 10+ years to go back. I would post a picture but the shrimp fried rice and the combo plate looked the same.

Also I expected a lot bigger crab for $55! The crab came out so quick, one can probably assume it was pre-made in the kitchen. First, it wasn't even hot on the inside. It appears they roast the crabs and leave the garlic oil and seasoning until its ordered. Then they pour the seasoning and oil on top of the crab to make it hot again. also the crab was 1.5 lbs or so. I can get that size crab at Ranch 99 or something for $7.99/lb. So about $12 for that same size crab that I had to pay $55 for. That seasoning isn't worth $43! \n\nWith that said, the seasoning and taste itself was good. Just not worth the price. We also had shaken beef which was good. But again portion vs. price, not worth it. \n\nWe also had crab puff and garlic noodles. Both of which were expensive and again portion isn't worth the price. \n\nSo overall you get my theme here. Its not worth it to come here.", "author": "Adam L."}

When I came here this past weekend, it tasted far from fresh. The crab was obviously frozen. Some of the meat in the smaller legs were actually kind of gross and the texture was very off. The worst part? The (frozen) crab cost me and my friend $54!!!! Seriously?!?\n\nWhen I was young, my aunt would sometimes bring home the popular garlic noodles from this place.

You definitely need to make a reservation in advance because there are many people who come here to eat the whole salt and pepper roasted Dungeness crab and the yummy garlic noodles.

After putting on some bibs, we got to work cracking open the crab and eating the juicy meat, dipping it in the butter, salt and pepper. It was so tasty! The crabs are large and fill up the whole plate. The way they roast it and cook it makes the shell a little easier to crack. You'll definitely get your fingers dirty working on the crab, but it's so worth it! Probably not the best choice for a first date though.

We then stopped by here, through word of mouth and all of the good yelp reviews but were extremely let down.\n\n-Very expensive at 50$~ish a crab. We could buy 3 crabs for that price at the market!\n~We ordered the tamarind crab. I think there was dill in it, but it is not the traditional vietnamese tamarind sauce. Not very good.\n~I suspect it may be overcooked. The crab was brought out within 5 minutes of ordering, so it wasn't probably freshly cooked or boiled twice. The meat was a bit too chewy and not so tender. I LOVE crab and I can eat crab all day, but it was very disappointing.\n~The chocolate lava cake was delicious! But you can't mess that up. \n~Garlic noodles were SUCH a let down. Very boring, as in you get sick of eating it after a couple of bites. Not enough garlic flavor, or parmesan...idk. Very bland. I think they need more seasoning or toppings, like parsley. Would not go again.", "author": "Y T."}

So Sunday night (before Memorial Day), we didn't feel like cooking so he asked if I wanted to try this place. I first went to Yelp for reviews and famous dishes. For 3 $$$ signs, I thought - this is pretty expensive for a seafood place but maybe worth a try since we're nearby? Best decision ever made. I made a reservation (via yelp) and got a 5:30pm dinner reservation. (Yep, we eat dinner early. LOL) When we arrived, there were a few people waiting outside. We checked in (around 5:45) and got seated right away. The place was PACKED at 5:45pm!!\nI got excited as I saw people enjoying their dishes. We started with their fresh spring rolls - they were light and bite size. Good and healthy start for an appetizer since we were going to have a lot of sodium later on. Ha! We ordered some of their staple dishes: Shaken Beef - 5 stars. Colossal Prawns served with garlic noodles - 4 stars. (I'm not really a shrimp person) Spicy eggplant with Chicken - 5 stars. Just enough spice with a ton of flavor. The sweet and spicy sauce was killer! We didn't order crab since we're both not into crab really. (And frankly, I'm lazy to eat that stuff) We didn't have enough room for dessert so we skipped that. Our waitress was super nice, fast and very attentive! We got our food in less than 10 minutes upon ordering. I'll definitely come back here again. For a dinner of 2, we spent about $120. Definitely worth it!", "author": "Anna Y."}

We drove towards the setting sun, passing many other good lookin' eateries, promised a crab coma experience...\n\nWe entered a simple door. The garlic pervaded everything. It was the kind that made you hungry, newly fried garlic that makes your mouth water. All around, people sat with plastic bibs! The group of diners to my left were happily passing around the famous noodles. The couple in front of me finished ordering and started to tie back their hair. An odd thing to do, but soon I'd fully understand.\n\nI glanced down at the menu and inhaled the garlic permeating the air, agreeing it was worth the trip from downtown to the other side to eat at Thanh Long. My hometown, Nha Trang, was even labeled on the menu cover. :-) Then, the waiters tied a bib on me and walked away with a knowing look. We started with the salmon carpaccio and the shrimp toast. The salmon was sliced thinly enough to hold full flavor and the citrus hit was perfect. The shrimp toast was pillow goodness. The topping reminded me of the shrimp paste around sugar cane.\n\nThen the garlic noodles! So good! Best when eaten hot, so get it on your plate then into your belly fast. The noodles were a nice chewy texture and a subtle garlic flavor that was nothing as powerful as its garlic aroma. Then again, you're hit with garlic the moment you walk in.\n\nThen...THE CRAB! Some of the best Dungeoness crab I've ever eaten. My table ordered the roasted crab and tamarind crab. Very different. Very satisfying. I paused for a split second to be thankful all my hair was already tied up. No one at my table ate their crab carapaces, so this Vietnamese gal was in heaven with five all to herself! Then, we went garlic crazy and ordered garlic fried rice. The tamarind crab went great with it.\n\nAfter all this, I had a disappointing fried banana. Others had the orange sherbet and the molten lava cake and enjoyed their desserts. My fried banana had no hint of a sugar finish...brown, white, nor palm. The banana was no where near sweet enough to carry it. \n\nBut, I went for the crab, not the dessert. So, high ratings from me.", "author": "Truc N."}

Good thing I didn't ordered anything else Bc I would of been more piss. After we ordered, our food came in less than 10 min. I was shocked bc how can they possibly cook the crab and garlic noodles so fast. As I took the first bite of the crab I was already piss. The crab was cold AF and had no taste. I can make this crab better than this. They basically had the crab pre-cooked in advance and just drizzled it with butter, salt and pepper on top and that was it. It was so plain. As for the garlic noodles it was probably pre cooked as well Bc it was cold. As I went to use the restroom I seen around 3+ chefs just standing there doing nothing. So I'm assuming they just have a whole pot of pre cooked crab already to serve. Food was horrible and over priced!  Roasted crab + garlic noodles = $76 and some change. Seriously, $58 for a cold crab with butter, salt and pepper? No thank you. You can make this yourself at home. \n\nI'd rather go to PPQ in clement. In PPQ I can get papaya salad w/egg rolls, garlic noodles, roasted crab for the price I paid at Thanh long.

Started with the Fried Calamari which had more onion condiment then Calamari, followed by the Won Ton wrap which was just okay, then we had the Beef and Chicken Satay which sat on a huge bed of lettuce with no accompany sauce or dip but was grilled to perfection and excellent taste, followed by the Mango salad which was refreshing, but the mango could have been more ripe. The dim sum wrap which was cold to taste. Don't bother to order the garlic toast which is tasteless, dry and cold.Dinner was the butterfly shrimp and garlic noodle and the shrimp was beautifully grilled and tasteful , but the garlic noodle was tasteless and barely warm followed by the Cubed steak which again sat on an overwhelming amount of lettuce with a few potatoes and onions. The steak was sweet and would of been better left just grilled. Then the piece of resistance the garlic crab which was nothing spectacular and the garlic noodles which were tasteless and cold. We then ordered desert hoping they could redeem themselves and that was a joke. We ordered the Chocolate lava cake accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that had no lava gushing and looked like a flat dried out brownie. The cheesecake creme brulee had no brulee.

Im not even a huge crab person, but the flavor on the roasted crab here is amazing. We usually share 1 crab between 2 of us. I've also ordered the tiger prawns which taste great, but are a little dry. The prawns are served over a bed of garlic noodles. These are my favorite garlic noodles to date, most other garlic noodles i've tried are dripping with oil. \n\nGreat service. However, the waiter did try to tack on an extra plate of garlic noodles onto my bill. I called him over when I looked at the bill. He automatically says \"Oh, is it the garlic noodles?\" So he knew that there was something on my bill that I didn't order. Of course, he removed it. \n\nI'm not a fan of crazy wait times or sneaky waiters, but the food quality will bring me back here whenever the chance comes.", "author": "Jose M."}

The occasion then was my husband asking my parents for my hand in marriage. My sister wanted to celebrate my twin daughters' 18th birthday here. My husband made the reservation. There were only 2 reservations available a 5:30 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. We took the later one because of other obligations. There was a little bit of a wait for our table when we arrived.\nAlex was our server. He got our water and hot jasmine tea going and answered questions about our menu choices such as how much roast crab and garlic noodles to order for our party of 10, which fish was the better choice, ... We went with 2 roasted crabs and 2 garlic noodles because Grandpa's dish of tiger prawns came with garlic noodles. There were 4 tiger prawns in the dish. The prawns were excellent. There weren't enough for everybody at the table. The garlic noodles always a hit with everybody especially the younger ones in the party. We had to order another garlic noodles and a large bowl of steamed rice. We had the salt and pepper calamari. We ordered the lemongrass chicken for Grandma. The dish was so tasty and the vegetables so tender that the grandchildren ate a good portion of the dish. We wonder if Grandma got enough to eat. The younger twin chose the steamed sea bass. It was a very good dish leaving everybody who had a chunk of the fish wanting more. The older twin enjoyed her shaken beef. The younger twin and her father thoroughly enjoyed the roasted crab and the big chunks of meat they got out of every leg.\nThe twins received complimentary desserts of ice cream in recognition of their birthday. The older twin shared a fried banana a la mode with her mother. Aunt and uncle also ordered another fried banana a la mode. The older twin liked the way the banana was fried. The fried layer was not thin. The vanilla ice cream tasted very natural. Little cousin ordered the lava cake with ice cream. We'll have to come back another time to try the homemade sorbet which is on the list of foods the younger twin can have not being able to tolerate milk products.\nThe roast crabs cost $55 each. We probably should have ordered another dish of lemongrass chicken and steamed sea bass.\nAlex and another server helped us take group pictures to commemorate the occasion. We enjoyed our dinner tremendously.", "author": "Belinda L."}

Definitely recommend making reservations because this place gets really packed!  We were seated upstairs which was nice because it wasn't noisy like downstairs.  The staff were friendly and fast!  Very attentive in emptying out the shells from our bowls and refilling our drinks.   So as far as the food, my review is as follows:\n1.  Salt & Pepper Calamari:  great!  Right amount of salt and pepper and the calamari was very tender; not chewy at all.\n2.  Villager's Favorite (prawns & pork medallions):  a definite must try!  The sauce is what made this dish absolutely!  A lot of flavors but yet so simple.\n3.  Roast and Drunken Crab:  good amount of spices but I feel that the crabs at another similar restaurant has bigger ones.  Still good though.\n4.  Garlic Noodles:  amazing!  Probably the best garlic noodles I've eaten amongst other places here in the Bay area.\nOverall gave this place 4 stars because food was good, service was great but took off a star because of parking. Although they had a valet service for $12 flat rate, street parking was a little difficult to find. But will definitely eat here again when I want my fix.", "author": "Erna M."}

It will blow your mind!  the best crabs i have since my childhood (Virginia Beach).\n\nfood: 5/5\nWe looked at the literal thousands of reviews on yelp and finally gave up and asked the waiter.without hesitation suggested the garlic noodles and the roasted crab. Look at all the reviews and 90% will rave of these two.  GET THEM.  The noodles in the garlic noodles were cooked perfect AL dente with heavy heavy succulent garlic, butter and lemon.  The crabs were also drizzled and soaked with rich flavor made up from garlic, butter, and lemon at the least. The flavors were rich yet you could still get the rich taste of crab meat. \n\nDecor/ambiance: 5/5\nHard to say since the food took away all my attention. The restaurant was very open with table and booth seating easily accommodating large groups. I saw a lot of family and couples there.  The atmosphere is lively and active. \n\nService: 5/5\nNothing significant negative. They were quick and efficient.  Our server was kind enough to explain the menu as if it was one of those high end restaurants.  I really appreciated them taking the time to explain their recommendation admit such a busy night. \n\nCost:4/5\nEach crab will cost you around 40 I believe. I hear from other people that used to frequent the restaurant a long time ago that the crabs used to be 20.   But who can blame a business who adjusts according to demand?? Cost is still reasonable but expect to pay a little more than what you would expect. Not a cheap date if you plan on bringing a date but it will make for  an awesome experience and memory. \n\nWatch for garlic breath!!!!\n\nRecommendations to management:\nNo critiques other than just to keep up the great work!

True: garlic crab is delightfully delicious. True: they charge you between $40-50 per crab but only give you the legs - no crab body included. I find that to be shady and unfortunate. However, the garlic crab is addicting. That's why this place generates so much business and no one mentions the missing body. \n\nGarlic noodles are THE best around. The mussel appetizer is unique and flavorful. A must have if you enjoy mussels. My all time favorite dish here is the shaking beef. Soooo good and original. Tender filet pieces mixed with roasted potatoes tossed in a salad. It's healthy and filling. If you haven't tried it, you definitely should. \n\nI can't give this place 5 stars even though I really want to. Simply because they charge so much for the crab and don't give you a whole crab. What is that? I've been here over 20+ times and never once have I been given an entire crab. Maybe I'm not in the special cool crab club? Or they use the crab body for other dishes on the menu? Either way, if I'm paying $40-50 per crab - I should be served just that: crab! Not just crab legs but the whole crab. I could get a whole, fresh crab at the wharf for $15. I'm no fool.

She asked me if I wanted to take a one day trip to San Francisco.  \"Heck yea!\", I told her.  I haven't been to SF in years.  Now, I had my heart set on going to House of Prime Rib but they were booked a month in advance.  But, I had remembered seeing Thanh Long featured on either the Travel or Food Channel weeks beforehand so I tried booking a reservation online.  Sadly, there was nothing available so I called the restaurant and got a reservation!\n\nI viewed the menu online and browsed through the photos on Yelp beforehand.  I knew I wanted to order the Thanh Long Mussels and An's Famous Garlic Noodles.  I was up in the air on the Dungeness Crab because I knew it would be rather pricey.\n\nWe arrived at 5:30 that night and was promptly seated to our table.  We looked around and noticed that every table was having the crab so we asked our server what the market price was ($53.95 as of October 8th).  We figured we would not be back to SF for awhile so we ended up ordering Tempura Style Coconut Prawns, Thanh Long Mussels, the Roast Crab and Garlic Noodles.  The Prawns were ok.  Nothing that blew me away.  The Mussels; however,  were delicious.  I would definitely order that again for an appetizer.  The Roast Crab...O M G!  That was the BEST crab I have ever had!  I'm not really too sure what all the spices they use but it was heaven.  The crab meat was so tender and flavorful.  And the Garlic Noodles may not look like much when it arrives to your table, but once you take a bite you will not be able to stop slurping those noodles.  Mix it with the sauce from the crab and it tastes even better!  \n\nThe service here is top notch!

They didn't give him his own cup of water, so I gave him mine, and you bet your ass I wasn't drinking from that cup after....with all that garlic noodle back wash! \n\n2. When I wanted to ask for water no one came by to check on our table, which would've given me the perfect opportunity to ask for water (yeah still on that subject.....I was thirsty).\n\n3. After a few minutes, I finally flagged someone down to get me a glass of my own water, and a dessert menu.....a few minutes passed by and I didn't get either. So when I reminded the gentleman for the dessert menu (gave up on the water) his response was \"oh yes, there are only 3 kinds.....chocolate cake, creme brulee cake, and banana\" uhhh do you want to be more specific about the 3rd option?  Is it a cake? Is it served with ice cream? Or are you just going to charge me $15 for some fucking fruit?!?!?! So I said forget it, and asked for the check.\n\n4. Oh and when the host asked us if we wanted a drink my hubby asked for a \"kentucky mule\" the host said they didn't have that....ok but I'm sure your bar tender can confirm that! \n\nOverall it was an ok experience, definitely good for take out and maybe a date with just my hubby, or maybe I came at a bad time, since they automatically charge an 18% gratuity for Father's Day they didn't feel the need to work for the tip.", "author": "Irene N."}

I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here on 5/26/15 and I am pleased to say that even though it had been over a decade since my last visit, the service and food have not changed! This family-owned and operated gem of a place has some of the best seafood (crab, prawns and garlic noodles - yes, please!) in the city.\n \nI had an 8:15 p.m. reservation for a party of 10 (close friends and family). If you're familiar with the city, then you know this place is located allllll the way in the Avenues, so it can take up to an hour to get to in rush hour traffic. I arrived extremely late to find everyone in my party seated and waiting for me, which I appreciated, as the restaurant was pretty full. They could've bumped my table or refused to seat my guests, but they did not. Kudos for that.\n \nSince it had been awhile, I wanted some of everything on the menu and my guests thankfully obliged me. We ordered several whole roast Dungeness crabs in their special garlic seasoning. I rarely order Dungeness crab anywhere else because not everyone cleans and cooks it properly, but at Thanh Long, it is a MUST. It was delicious, just like I remembered! It's also very filling with everything else. I ended up splitting half of mine with my godsister. The sides are a la carte, so we also ordered the garlic noodles, shrimp fried rice, garlic toast and the seasonal vegetable saut\u00e9 to go with our crab. My mom ordered her usual tiger prawns over garlic noodles. (The four prawns come butterflied over the noodles). She refused to let me have a taste, so I assume it was as good as she remembered, too. For those who may not like crab or shrimp like one of my friends, the mango salad is recommended - without the scallops or shrimps, of course. As far as libations go, they have a full bar and decent cocktails. I only had Goose on the rocks with two limes, so I can't comment on the other drinks.\n \nIf you don't like garlic, this is not the place for you. And if you are price conscious, this is not the place for you LOL! They do accept walk-ins depending on how busy they are. The place is not huge, so just phone ahead and reserve whenever possible. Street parking is available, but the surrounding area is residential so it may be hard to come by. Valet is $12. Not bad for San Francisco.\n \nFor me, the only downside is living out-of-state, but I would recommend this place for special occasions.", "author": "Tashi L."}

They do not rush groups and are very attentive (busing dishes, making suggestions on what to order, etc.) with out being pushy. I recommend always making a reservation.

And garlic noodles to die for. \n\nI've ordered very few other things off of the menu, including the beef, but I'd much rather just eat more crab. The wine list is pretty solid which makes this an even more enjoyable meal. \n\nYou'll come out of Thanh Long reeking of garlic, but you won't care at all because you'll feel so full and satisfied.

Any crab roasted in their oven has been privileged to be there. I have been dining there for over 20 years and I have never been disappointed. The service equals the food.  If I lived closer I'd have a table with my name on it.  Then there is the garlic noodles.  OMG!  Don't forget the salt and pepper calamari appetizer.  I recently tried the drunken crab, if I had never had the roasted crab, it would be my favorite.  Since I am in love with the roasted, drunken crab is a very respectable second.\n\nMake reservations and use the valet parking for a stress free experience.\n\nI love Thang Long!", "author": "Oddette A."}

This is me and my family's go to place for a celebratory dinner or family gathering. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night (probably our 4th time here) with reservations and were seated quickly in 5 minutes. The service was GREAT! And my great, I mean, when we added an order of garlic noodles they came out in mere seconds! \n\nAs for the food: \nAppetizers:\n1) fried calamari: perfect combo of salty, spicy, and chewy. Not too greasy. \n2) mango salad- MY FAVE! It's served warm, with pieces of sweet, juicy mango, and roasted shrimp. Mmmm party in my mouth! \n3) Vietnamese salad: kind of like a papaya salad. Good balance of savory and sweet, but I preferred the mango salad. \n\nMain courses: \n1) 4 roasted crabs ($44/crab) for 7 people. (If you are only ordering crab, 1/person is good, but if you want to sample other entrees, it's a good idea to order less) MY LOVE. Their roasted crab...mind bogglingly delicious. Eat while its hot, and the juices drip all over and the flavor permeates through to the meat, instead of most crab places that can't get it right! \n2) shaken beef- tender buttery chunks of beef with roasted potato chunks soaked in the beef drippings. Scrumptious. \n3) 2 orders of garlic noodles- the best you'll find anymore. I love that the garlic flavor is present but not overpowering, and balances the flavor of the butter. Comes out steaming hot! \n3) brown and white rice to go with the roast crab juices! \n\nThanh Long is the go to place for delicious crab! Do it! It's worth the splurge! You will walk out a happier person.", "author": "Robin Y."}

YES, the crab is VERY tasty and just flaky and that buttery pepper oil on the platter for dipping? Divine.\nGarlic Noodles? I can eat that all day errday... seriously.\n\nWONDERFUL.\n\nSo here's a few tips to enjoy your Thanh Long experience.\n\n1.) Be Ready to spend money. Example? One Crab last week cost about $46.\nOne order of crab, one garlic noodes, one order of Shaken Beef and Fried Ice Cream- one beer and a diet coke... $105.00 without the tax. That was good for two people. \n\n2.) One Crab can be shared by two people max... But one can easily have a crab to themselves. I mean.. It's just CRAB.\n\n3.) Garlic Noodles -- if you're like.. eeeew my breath will stink.. NO.. it won't. Just do IT. It's more of a butter garlic taste.\n\n4.) Make reservations.\n\n5.) Have some cash for valet parking.

The roasted crab was buttery and the crab meat just fell off the shell because it was so fresh. It was so good that we decided to get the drunken crab too. Although that one was good as well, I think I still prefer the roasted crab. To me, it just had a better flavor. I was apprehensive that the garlic noodles would be dry but they were moist and garlicky. Yum. We also got the grilled calamari and the filet beef. Those were okay but I would stick with the crab and noodles. I should also note that it's probably a once in a while kind of meal because it is so buttery and rich, but it's worth it!\n\nP.S.

I can't say much about other menu items. We all ordered one crab each and the bill was pretty high up there. \n\nAt first we walk in, we smelled bad crab smell then after entering the dinning area any bad smell was covered by fragrant garlic smell. This restaurant looks small from the entrance but they have second floor dinning area so it is relatively big but since they are popular, they took many customers in and the place becomes too crowded. There is not much decor and everything looks old and not too clean. \n\nThe garlic crab is decent sized. It is drenched in garlic butter. Sure feels like a pound of butter was used on one crab.  At first it is tasty but after going through about half a crab, I get sick of drinking so much butter. The second half was just average.  The garlic noodle is good but the portion is small for the price. $50 for a crab and $10 for garlic noodle is just over priced for their value. \n\nService is good because they get a lot of tips that were mandatorily added for large group. Parking is a little difficult in the neighborhood, but you can use their valet service. \n\nIt was the first time I visited this place but it is likely my last time because of the value of the food and entertainment factor which were lacking.", "author": "Fred U."}

This was almost too peppered, but still delicious nonetheless.\n \n*Garlic Noodles - THE BEST garlic noodles I've ever tasted, hands down.  1 order is enough for about 3-4 people.  ($10)\n\n*Roast Crab - this is what everyone gets!  A whole crab in their special garlic sauce. They gut the inside of main body for you so the head you get is nothing but the shell. The plate is buttered for your for your dipping pleasure.  (Market price ~$40 each crab)\n\n*Fried banana with ice cream - so delicious and really hits the spot.\n\nThe service was really fast, we never waited long for anything to come out.

There were people all packed by the front door and outside waiting for a table yesterday evening. I don't blame them. They know where to eat! Kudos to bf for making a ressie. We were seated right away and already knew what we were going to order.\n\nMust eat: Garlic Noodles, Shaken Beef and Crab of course! We opted to try the crab with tamarind sauce since we have had the roasted crab before. It was a great choice but a bit messy. Thanks for giving us a stack of napkins! We needed that. Call us napkin monsters. I looked around and it seemed like almost every table got at least the same three dishes. The garlic noodles are sooo good!  The noodles are chewy and the perfect texture. The garlic isn't super overpowering but very flavorful. Simple yet so yummy! Shaken beef was tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of mixed greens with cooked potatoes and onions. The tamarind sauce on the crab was a tomato based but had a hint of sweetness to balance the acidity.\n\nThe wait staff was very prompt. They kept removing our bowls of crab shells and giving us fresh bowls. Our water glasses were always full throughout our meal as well. \n\nBecause the restaurant is crowded and the tables set very close together, it was a bit difficult to carry a conversation in normal voice level. I caught myself asking bf to repeat himself a few times and vice versa. I could literally hear what the tables next to us were saying too. \n\nMinus a star for the upkeep of the restroom. I went to wash my hands prior to my meal and noticed that there were paper towels and tp strewn on the floor. There was also a used wedge of lime (from a cocktail?) on the sink counter....odd. After my meal, I went to wash my hands again. The restroom was in the same condition, except with more paper towels on the floor this time. Doesn't seem like the restroom was maintained during service.", "author": "Liv A."}

I have not been here in over 10 years and the quality and service is still the best. The roasted crab was still buttery and garlicky and the noodles. Oh. My. God. Started off at the bar and the drinks were not that strong. Reservations were easy enough over the phone but once there we still had to wait about 20 minutes. Line out the door and packed in the front like sardines. No personal space here. Ordered the appetizers: crab wontons and calamari and the shrimp salad. Everything was excellent! Roasted crab was amazing the only drawback was the body of crab was not that fat. Garlic noodles were the right amount of butter and garlic. Finished off with FBI-fried banana and ice cream was so amazing. The fried banana was heated and the cold from the coconut ice cream was such a great combination! All of the copy cats cannot compare. The only thing was the sea bass my husband ordered was late and was a bit rubbery but the server gave free garlic noodle in return. I do miss the old days when there were white tablecloths and the busboys scraping the crab and crap off your table but the heated towels still come out. Be careful tho.

I think that insane line in front of it has to go and the crab should be slightly less expensive.\n\nWith all of that said, the SO took me here for my birthday dinner! (We have been together for way too long to not be eating with our hands and spraying each other with crab juices, I suppose) This crab was super hyped up by the other, making me having lower expectations (sometimes the idea of something is much better than itself). We parked two blocks away (normal SF parking problems) and entered a ridiculously hustling and bustling restaurant though there wasn't a soul outside!\n\nWe were sat quickly and immediately already knew kind of what we wanted. The roasted garlic crab, which is a must! And the drunken crab for variety. So right at this moment, I'm going to tell you to STOP and only order the roasted crab. You need more reassurance? ONLY ORDER THE ROASTED CRAB. I did not think the drunken crab was bad but it did not hold a candle to the roasted crab!!! The flavor in the roasted crab was perfect, strong and mouth-watering. While the drunken crab was also tickling my palette, it definitely did not have the same sort of WOW factor that the roasted crab did, so do it. And order two so nobody has to fork the other's hand!\n\nIt took us quite some time to wait for the crab to cool off enough to peel, then it took us awhile to peel the crab. In between all of that, both of the crabs got cold, of course! So our server warmed it up for us! As this as an option, please keep it in mind! Warm crab tastes much better than cold crab!\n\nAfter highly indulging ourselves to the max, they surprised me with a birthday cake (I'm actually pretty sure the SO had to pay for it but at least they gave us the candle)!

And given the rave reviews and hype, I didn't care to order anything else. \n\nF O O D\nFor a party of three we ordered:\n\n*ROASTED CRAB w/ An's Garlic Sauce & Spices (~$38) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=JuuVdF8Q2UIeOFAYHPHX8Q\nUpon first glance, I was wondering where all the garlic was. The garlic \"sauce\" was more of oil infused with garlic and black pepper. Though fragrant, the garlic flavor wasn't anywhere as pronounced as PPQ's Roasted Crab and the sauce was merely oil which left a heavy feeling after dinner. The crab was fresh and perfectly roasted though which was evident in the sweet, tender, succulent meat. \n\n*DRUNKEN CRAB w/ Chardonnay, Sake, Brandy, Scallions & Black Pepper (~$38) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=ObzTM78quAF_QKol4BqGcA\nIf you're more of a crab purist (or an alcoholic) and like to taste it in its unadulterated form, then the Drunken Crab is the way to go. The meat was clean tasting and you can taste all its natural sweetness. It was lightly infused with the trio of alkies, though sake was the most prominent flavor giving it a subtle dry wine flavor.\n\n*GARLIC NOODLES w/ Special Garlic Sauce & Spices (2 orders @ $9.50/each) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=JUXoSeXnlJljPgzqmexqAg\nGarlic noodles and any solid noodle dish for that matter should be al-dente with a nice, chewy toothsome bite to it to show its freshness and proper execution. Though deliciously buttery and fragrant with lots of garlicky bits, Thanh Long's garlic noodles were choppy and mushy. \n\nPlease note: Thanh Long uses tons of MSG to flavor their food; enough to keep me waking up in the middle of night and running to the kitchen to get a glass of water to sooth my dry throat. \n\nS E R V I C E\nLet's just say the busboy was way more attentive than our waiter. The only thing our waiter did was take our order, bring our food and give us our bill; he never once checked on us. I wasn't surprised though as we have ran into the same service issues at R&G and PPQ and subpar service seems to be a reoccurring theme at many Asian restaurants. The only redeeming thing is our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering. \n\nA M BI AN C E / D E C O R\nA step above your typical Vietnamese restaurant, Thanh Long has crisp white linen tables and the waitstaff don purple mandarin collared attire. A fairly large restaurant, Thanh Long is a good option for large parties and family dinners. I noticed that a lot of people were on dates though it's very, very loud at Thanh Long.\n\nP A R K I N G\nAlthough I got lucky and found parking in less than 5 minutes across the street, I heard finding street parking can be very difficult in the area. Valet parking is available for $10. \n\nCompared to R&G (known for their Salt & Pepper Crab), R&G's crab has much more intense flavor with a spicy kick and the fried batter gives it a nice crispy texture contrast to the sweet, tender crab meat. PPQ's Roasted Crab is heavily covered in buttery garlic and each bite is like a garlic clove has exploded in your mouth which is different than Thanh Long's crab which is more subdued sitting in a wading pool of garlic infused oil and black pepper.\n\nSo, who reigns supreme? It all boils down to what flavors you're looking for. If want something deliciously salty and spicy with a crunch, R&G's Salt & Pepper is the King. However, if you want something sinfully rich with a strong BURST of garlicky flavor, than PPQ's Roasted Crab definitely trumps Thanh Long's. But don't take my word for it, you be the judge...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-01", "description": "4.5 stars. Minus a half a star for the value of some of the items but overall a terrific night out.\n\nThis is a prize of a place. Comfortable setting, great service, excellent quality food and, while maybe spend-y, is worth a look.\n\nFor our New Years eve dinner there we four had reservations (needed given the size of the place) at 8 PM. We started the night with two appetizers:\n\n1. Tempura Style Coconut Prawns (3/5). These were not so much the Japanese style tempura (corn starch batter) that you might have had but more coconut shaving encrusted large prawns. There were 5 and were good but, if I had to go again, not a must have.\n\n2. Dungeness Crab Puffs (4/5). These were 6, small, perfectly deep fried, wonton-skin wrapped pillows of Dungeness crab filling that were so much better than the typical Crab Rangoon's that you might have had elsewhere. They came with two dipping sauces, the better one was the sweet mustard. This was a nice, if pricey, treat and a good start to the entrees. \n\nFour entrees:\n\n1. Roasted Crab (4/5): this smelled wonderful as it came out and was a large, already cut up Dungeness crab, with the carapace shell. It was meaty and perfectly done with the garlic sauce. Really glad we tried this. I like crab but it isn't a must have for me. My table-mates really like it. Market price was almost $40 each.\n\n2. Shaken Beef (5/5): very tender tasty cubes of beef (not well done, if that's important to you) that was marinated in a lightly sweet sauce, served with potato cubes that had also been marinated in the same dark sauce and grilled; all of this served over tender bay greens. Delicious! Everyone liked this dish. The Rice and Roll's Hunan Grilled Butter Beef was very comparable (and less expensive) than this dish but this was still a winning dish. And I need to mention the tender-crisp cuts of sweet Vidalia (that's my guess) onions that were served with this dish, they were great in their own right and really added dimension to the beef.\n\n3. Seafood Combination (Scallops, prawns, Dungeness crab) Fried rice (6/5): if there was one dish that stood out from all of them, it was this dish. A simple, (even unimpressive) looking fried rice dish that just blew people away with its wok-seared taste and awesome flavors. Fried rice, yes. But extraordinary? For a mere $16 Absolutely!\n\n4. Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns (5/5): 4 large butterflied and perfectly grilled in the shell prawns that were served over a bed of their famously delicious garlic noodles. Yeah this was a splurge, at almost $10 a prawn, this was expensive but very (very) good and to be served over the deservedly vaunted garlic noodles, this was a plus. We didn't have to order the Garlic Noodles as an entree because of this, and the waiter was smart enough to understand this by ignoring our order for these Prawns PLUS a Garlic Noodle order. The prawns did have a tendency to stick to their shells, but they were perfectly done and marinated in some fantastic sauce to make them outstanding.\n\nThe Garlic noodles had the perfect consistency of Yee Noodles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_mein, which gives them an extra nice bite and appear to absorb the flavors better. They are also pricey. The Garlic Noodles by themselves were $9.50 an order, which seems a bit high for lo mein noodles and garlic, but if they are Yee noodles, they would be more fairly priced. Everyone at the table loved these. \n\nThree deserts: \n\nCreme Brulee (3/5): this was an OK rendition of Creme Brulee, not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. Nothing really special.\n\nChocolate Lava Cake (5/5): Oh yeah! This chocolate delight was the size of a very small hockey puck served with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream over a pool of Grand Marnier & melted vanilla ice cream. It was pricey ($9) but oh so very wonderful to have that rich oozing chocolate goodness.\n\nFried Banana Fritters a la Mode. (5/5): 2 fritters (your choice of pineapple or banana) served with that same scoop of dense vanilla ice cream. Love, Love, Love this simple but wonderful desert.\n\nIt was almost a perfect amount of food for 4 with each of us full to the neck and almost giddy from the great food experience.\n\nWhile the restaurant was crowded, it never seemed loud or noisy and the service was spot-on: unobtrusive, available, and very polite.\n\nWith tip we were at about $50 per person without drinks (which included one modestly iced tea for $2.50).\n\nLoved it and would eagerly go again for a special occasion!", "author": "Glenn H."}

I made it a point to stop by here on our trip to SF. Aside from the reviews, I was also impressed by the story of the An family and empire. I'm Vietnamese so of course Vietnamese food is always an excellent choice in my book. The food here was good, but so ridiculously overhyped in my opinion. The garlic noodles tasted bland to me with not enough garlic and the crab was tasty but how can you ever go wrong with butter, crab, and pepper? You can really save yourself the $$$ and buy yourself crab, steam it, and make a dipping sauce using lemon and pepper (that's a traditional way to eat it in Vietnam). The food was good but not worth the effort or hype and our party was seriously disappointed. To further disappoint, this place really doesn't offer authentic Vietnamese cuisine. I personally think people need to venture to some hole in the wall Vietnamese place if they're handing out 5 star reviews to Thanh Long. At some point, I hope to try Crustacean to see if maybe the hype is limited to that brand in the An empire because Thanh Long is underwhelming and disappointing. \n\nOur party of 6 ordered the salt and pepper calamari, mango salad, crab puffs, roasted crabs, rice (why is this not included for a $20 entree!!!), spicy eggplant, and garlic noodles. We ordered two plates of garlic noodles and ended up eating only one. We got a doggy bag for the leftovers to donate to the homeless (because why not).", "author": "Tia D."}

Two of us arrived a couple minutes after 5:30pm and checked in, however they wouldn't seat us until the entire party was present.\n\nFOOD:\n*Roast Crab (market price: $38.95) - Okay.  The crab was roasted and marinated oil and a lot of pepper.  The menu stated garlic sauce but it seemed like oil/butter and lacked the full on garlic taste I was looking for.\n\n*Drunken Crab (market price: $38.95) - Good.  The crab is simmered with chardonnay, sake, and brandy with scallions, chives, and pepper.  The crab tasted great dipped in the broth.  Note: all the pepper does sink to the bottom of the dish so if you're going to dip your crab meat in the broth, do so in the middle.\n\n*Garlic Noodles ($9.95) - Okay.  The noodles were soggier than I remember and a lot less garlic. I use to prefer Thanh Long's noodles over anywhere else, however it seems like they don't put as much as they use to. \n\nSERVICE:\nDon't expect stellar service or even any service.  Our waiter simply took our order and ignored us.  The only time he came over was when my friend flagged him down to order another bowl of garlic noodles.

To get my verdict, read 'til the end.\n\nThere's shady-looking valet parking available, but also a ton of neighborhood streets to try and squeeze your vehicle into. The restaurant itself is rather nice on the inside (especially comparative to the exterior). Hostess and waiter service was predictably Asian. Reservations are definitely helpful, but food comes out blazing fast.\n\nNo surprises here. Between the fiance and I, we ordered two roasted crabs and a plate of roasted garlic noodles. Cost is prohibitive. Crabs are market rate, and went for somewhere between $35-$40 each (I forget the precise price). Garlic noodles are $9.\n\nStarting with the noodles, they were delicious. The chow mein-styled noodles were juicy and tasty with just a bare hint of the crispiness from the pan. They were flavored well, though not as overtly garlic-y as I had expected. My only qualm is that it's ONLY noodles, nothing else. Not even a green onion garnish or anything. For that price point, I thought there would be more.\n\nAs for the crab, it comes whole, and it's up to you to put in the work. For seafood lovers, one crab is optimal, but that's too much cholesterol for my book. Still the crab was delicious, with a plate dripping in black pepper butter. The best bites are those where you take a swab of black pepper direct to the tongue. It adds a bite that makes your mouth water. \n\nStill, we had our crab comparators. She was more of a fan of the Fisherman's Wharf in DC. I couldn't help but compare it to the spicy black pepper crab from Singapore. Thanh Long just couldn't quite measure up to those two.\n\nIn a normal market, Thanh Long is great.

Got the Garlic Noodles, Mango Salad, and Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns that came out to be about $70 dollars total (omfg). Maybe I just eat too much, but my friend and I were confused as to why the description of the meal said \"large\", because there was really nothing large about it.\n\nMango Salad was a refreshing appetizer. The Garlic Noodles were okay; didn't think there was anything that special about the dish. We think that the damage was mostly due to the Tiger Prawns - definitely do not recommend getting it!!!\n\nWe didn't try the infamous Crab dish, but we saw many people getting it - even a couple who ordered a crab each...

You should give yourself a window to serve your late bloomers as well as you served the ones that came in at 5 when you open. I'm loyal to this place, because I do enjoy the crab and garlic noodles, but the fact that I drove all the way from Reno Nv to take my mother out for Mother's Day and was rushed is horrible.

The garlic noodles were delicious, full of lard, but delicious.  Unfortunately, this dish must be consumed immediately, once it cools off the lard solidifies and becomes disgusting.\n\nThe Roast crab was pretty good, but I like the ones at R&L Lounge more.  \n\nThe eggplant dish was also soaked in oil, but nonetheless tasty.

The crab did not taste fresh and some of the legs had a frozenesque taste to it.... WHAT THE HECK!!!if I wanted frozen crab I could have stayed in Stockton... Sooo disappointed I informed the waiter, he apologized and said they were busy yesterday and ran out of food. What does that have to do with my crab tasting old and I fresh????  Needless to say to add more insult he offered the fabulous chocolate lava cake to make up for the lackluster 54.95 crab I had.  Unfortunately it too was a slap in the face as it was boxed cake that was microwaved and a scoop of ice cream added. Took one spoonful and wanted to spit it out!!!

And this was probably the first \"fancy\" restaurant I went to back in high school.  And the first time for garlic noodles that was so WOW to me back then.  20 years later and many many new culinary experiences, the garlic noodles ain't no big thang.\n\nYou come here for the roast crab and garlic noodles, yes but I wanted to try something new.  So in addition, I got the mango salad and seafood dumpling.  And also the steamed sea bass entree.\n\nRoast crab was just ok.  I prefer PPQ and the salt & pepper fried crab at R&G more.  Thanh Long's crab was flavorful but over peppered and garlic oiled at times.  The weak part was the tamale in the shell.  It seemed like it was cleaned out a bit and the crab wasn't as big as it usually is.  Maybe its not so in season now but they should still be reserving colossal size crabs for their dishes.  We had the prawns with garlic noodles.  The prawns very overdone a bit and had too much buttery/pepper smeared over it.  It was cholesterol city last night.\n\nMango salad too my surprise had stir fried shrimp and onions on top making the salad a bit warm and welted.\n\nSeafood dumpling seem like it was heated in the microwave and had a dry appearance.\n\nBoth salad and dumpling came out super fast.\n\nSea bass was over done too and just wasn't as smooth as it should be.  Sea bass ain't suppose to taste \"meaty\".  I think a filet-o-fish has an even more delicate flaky texture.  I would rather had two filet-o-fish sandwiches on that big plate instead of the sea bass.\n\nNo plate presentation on anything.\n\nOrdered a pineapple lychee martini before ordering food but it never came and the food did.  I had to ask and then they said they were all out of the infusion?  So I tried a passion tea martini which came after the entrees.  So it sat there getting warm as I started to eat and didn't feel like drinking it anymore.  It was nice when it was straight cold.  \n\nServer who took our order never came back to ask what's up with the food.  Instead the runner asked?  Pretty whack on service.\n\n$41.95 for the crab is totally not worth it.  I would pay 20 bucks at most.  In fact, I can make this at home and I do every time crab season starts.  Go to sunset supermarket or new may wah and get some live crabs and cook it up at home.

However I would not have minded leaving this place crawling out from being soo fool.", "author": "Sione K."}

I got the thing you're supposed to order, the Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles. I feel like if you don't order these things, then there's not really a point in coming here. Though expensive (~$55 for these 2 items), they were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing in combination with each other. What's their secret?!\n\nI guess the An family that owns this and many other successful restaurants in San Francisco must be living a cushy lifestyle with all that dough they're bringing it--good for them. I don't hear that many Vietnamese restaurant success stories.\n\nNot that this means anything, but most of the patrons were African-American. I was just surprised because I never see black folks at Vietnamese restaurants. Apparently and obviously Thanh Long is different than Vietnamese Restaurant #2381801. That crab and garlic noodle dish are pretty irresistible. Thanh Long is the place to be for that.", "author": "Marlon T."}

If you plan to have dinner at weekend, it is essential to make reservation ahead and arrive promptly because the wait can get hectic (about 1-1:45 hours). Also, don't come like 30 minutes early for your reservation since they will make you wait until your whatever time you reserve.\n\nWe had the coconut prawns and New Zealand mussels for appetizer, garlic noodles, roast crab, tamarind crab, and shaken beef for main course. I remember having the coconut prawns at their home before and I absolutely fell in love with this dish. Crispy from the tempura, sweet from the coconut flake, a little tangy of their signature orange sauce. It was such a balanced dish and a great start of the meal. Mussels were fresh, the Asian pesto was flavorful and the crostini accompanied really well with the other two.\n\nOnto the main dish, garlic noodles, I thought I liked it better when I ate at their house, but my boyfriend loved the noodle served at the restaurant. It was garlicky, but a little sweet for me. The crabs were very fresh and the color looked amazing. Roast crab, which seem to be every Yelper's favorite, yet not me. Tamarind crab was okay, the sauce was not thick and tangy enough for a Vietnamese like me who technically grow up eating tamarind crab every other weekend in Vietnam. Lastly, shaken beef was perfectly medium rare, juicy and full of flavors. Strange, but I would recommend this meat dish at a seafood restaurant. \n\nOverall, great dining experience.", "author": "Chau V."}

We got there about half an hour early, but they seated us anyways since there was room. It's a small restaurant on the corner of the street. On the outside, it doesn't look very nice but the interior is pretty upscale.  \n\nLoved the promptness of everything. The appetizer came within ten minutes. We were bibbed and received our main course immediately after we finished our appetizer. The waiters were attentive and helpful. They also gave us New Year's calendars on our way out. \n\nHere's what we got:\nSALT & PEPPER CALAMARI $11.95: Good appetizer. Crisp, no sauce.\n\nASPARAGUS SOUP WITH CRAB $7.50: My mom ordered this and enjoyed it. Hot soup is always great when the weather is cold. \n\nROAST/DRUNKEN/TAMARIND CRAB: We got one of each ($41.95 per crab). My favorite was the drunken crab. The sauce actually doesn't matter unless you dip the crab meat in the sauce on the plate. \n\nGARLIC NOODLES $10: This was actually really good, but I wouldn't say they're to die for. It was like eating garlic bread except they were noodles, and these noodles are the same texture as the chow mein at Panda Express. They also have the less expensive option of garlic rice, fried rice, jasmine rice, or vegetables. \n\nLAVA CHOCOLATE CAKE $8.25: Skip it. The lava cake is mostly syrup and on the bitter side. \n\nFRIED BANANA A LA MODE $6.95: Skip it. It's just regular fried banana and ice cream--nothing special.\n\nCREME BRULEE $7.50: Again, skip it. If you are dying to have dessert here, choose this one. I'm not saying the desserts are bad at Thanh Long but there are a couple dessert shops on the same street and there are better options in driving distance.\n\nParents also had a FLEUR DE MANGO ($9.25) with a heineken ($5) and a HANOI SUNSET ($9).", "author": "Tiffany N."}

If anyone knows me and my hubby we are HUGE fans of roast garlic crab and garlic noodles. Thanh Lang definitely knows how to make theirs, however, I still prefer the garlic noodles at PPQ. I noticed that Thanh Long's noodles are made with sugar so they tend to give a sweeter aftertaste whereas PPQ's isn't sweet at all and has more chunks of garlic in it. This time around they ordered the salt and pepper crab which was nicely seasoned and perfectly steamed, however, I was looking forward the the roast garlic version. \n\nOverall, this place is nicer for special occasions, albeit a bit pricier than the latter. They do valet your car but at $12 you would think you were downtown. We're locals so we prefer to find our own street parking and instead spend that $12 bucks on extra noodles! Before you settle on a favorite, I highly recommend trying both Thanh Long and PPQ because both have great reviews and almost equally good food. :)", "author": "Petra S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-12", "description": "Food: Crabs are currently $39.99 at market price. I ordered the roast crab with garlic noodles (I know, so original). I was expecting the crab to be more bursting with flavors...but it wasn't although it was still really good. I just tasted a lot more black pepper than expected. The garlic noodle was delicious, but should be eaten hot. It's not as tasty anymore once it cools down. It has a buttery taste and the garlic flavor wasn't overpowering at all. It was perfect, especially with the roasted crab. \n\nService: Excellent service, including a waiter who ties on your bib for you. Water cups always stay refilled. And not with nasty, melted-down ice! Your bowls for shells and other unwanted will never be filled for they replace it very often. I was extremely satisfied.\n\nOthers/Description of the place: IT WAS HELL ON EARTH trying to find parking (not that you should resort to shady valet service unless you're really on a time crunch). I also had trouble locating which building is Thanh Long. This place for sure did not stand out to me. It was nothing special from the exterior. So I was very pleased to see just how beautiful and classy the inside of the restaurant was. They have a full bar in the front when you first walk in. And a second story for their customers. Lighting in here is quite dim which I love. It helps to create a much more intimate atmosphere. We celebrated a friend's birthday here so we dressed to impress. But it wouldn't be totally inappropriate to show up casual. I just wouldn't suggest walking up in there with like beach wears or something. \n\nTips: They DO take reservations so be sure to take advantage of that and do so. It'll save yourself a lot of time and pain waiting in line, anticipating their delicious food. And if you do have reservation, be sure to arrive early. It took me about 15-20 minutes to drive EVERYWHERE  around the neighborhood, circling the block several times before finding a parking spot. NOT just a decent parking spot, just any parking spot AT ALL. It was ridiculous. The point is, don't be late for your reservation. Not only that, but make sure your whole party is on time. Not just a few of you because that wouldn't count. And no, calling them to let them know you're on your way will not help. They may stretch it by 5 minutes, but that's about it. So to my ladies and drag queens, if you're going to wear high heels...you're about to have SOOOOO much fun walking a couple of blocks to destination.

Where do they even keep that many crabs laying around I thought.  At that point, I wasn't sure if he mentioned it already, so to save some possible embarrassment I didn't inquire about the crabs, nodded, and just asked...'where are the restrooms?' \n\nParking was more difficult than I expected as street parking sucked that day.  My laziness within grew with valet parking available tempting me.  The outrageous cost of $12 bucks and the thought of someone joy riding in my valuable antique of a Corolla didn't sit well with me.  The Sunset weather by the water was its usual half dreary self.  Contrast to the outside, inside the restaurant was vibrant and warm.  Aroma of good times filled the place; passing each table we saw at least one crab on the table.  Hold those horses...part of the waiter's yada yada yada included \"90% of people order the crab\".  \n\nIf it were me, our order would have consisted of all crab and garlic noodles.  Due to food allergies and cholesterol consciousness at the table, a full spectrum of dishes was chosen.  \n\nOUR ORDER:     \n*Lemongrass chicken satay - These grilled chicken skewers come numbering around three or four.  This was the first item that came out and everyone was hungry.  Playing the disappearing act in a poof, I only ate a sliver of a sliver sized piece.  My taste buds do not recall anything negative.  There were no complaints either.  \n\n*Salt & pepper calamari - One of my sister's go to dishes no matter where, when, and how.  How can you go wrong with deep fried calamari?  You can't; unless they were soggy which these were not.  Salt and pepper were abundantly prevalent throughout.  The chunks of calamari were a larger size calamari than usual.  Bigger means more calamari meat and less batter.  Less batter is typically good thing.  \n\n*Shaken beef - Shaken, not stirred...I didn't taste the \"shaken\", but the cubes of meat were very tender.  Served on a bed of green and mixed in with some potato, the meat has a sharp peppery taste.  I recommend this for people with seafood allergies that come here.    \n  \n*Lemongrass chicken - Didn't I order something with lemongrass as an appetizer already?  I repeated \"lemongrass\" a couple times under my breath unsure of this when ordering.  We needed another dish for the non-seafood eaters at the table anyway.  Consisting of probably all dark meat, the chicken was very simplistically lemongrass-ed.  There were more bell peppers than I would have liked.  The noticeable echo of pepper flavor popped up again.  I wonder how much pepper this restaurant uses in a day.   \n\n*\"Colossal\" royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles - My main chagrin about this plate was the adjective \"colossal\" attached to the prawns.  All the pictures I saw, they looked humongous.  I bet the picture I took even look gigantic.  Truly, it is an optical illusion.  While unexpectedly smaller they were also a smidgen on the salty side for me.  Overdosed on seasoning, the prawns sat on top of garlic noodles.  The spillover of seasoning into the garlic noodles unassumingly enhanced the noodles.  The garlic noodles are good by themselves; the extra touch of seasoning really made the whole that much better.  If I go again, I'll pass on this one, but was decent. \n\n*Roast crab - Presentation is absolutely photogenic.  I'm talking about super model level.  The crab was very meaty and a nice size.  They really saved the best for last, as this was the last entr\u00e9e to be served.  Cut down the middle with all the legs intact, the shell of the crab is ornamentally placed on top of the legs.  Their \"garlic sauce and secret sauce\" fully cooked into the crab meat and needless to say, I started to dip some noodles in the dressing.  It was good stuff.  To nitpick, freshness rating of the crab wasn't A+, rather an A-.    \n \n*Steamed rice - That's how my dad rolls.  Can't go anywhere without it.  I had to add this one or it wouldn't be a complete review.  The white rice came in a bowl and tasted...rice-like.  My dad thoroughly enjoyed it with a big smile.\n\nThanh Long is an Americanized Vietnamese restaurant that is versatile enough to draw even the most Asian of Asians.  If you read the articles down the hallway to the restroom, there's a feel good story behind restaurant's owners (Remember that question about where the restrooms were?  Yeah...there was a line and I had some time to read.).  The main attraction is their crab and garlic noodles.  Get it, and be one of the daily 500!", "author": "Arnold T."}

We were a party of six and ordered appetizers, roasted crabs, garlic noodles & rice and drinks. All that was fine up until the end where I asked the waitress to pack our leftovers to take home. I happened to look over into the kitchen area (we were seated upstairs) and I could see our waitress prepare our leftover garlic noodles into a plastic container, push it across the counter and it happens to fall into the garbage can. At this point I'm hoping she does the right thing and tell us that happened. Sadly no, that didn't happen. She looks around to see if anyone saw her then proceeds to take the container out of the trash and places it into a bag along with our other take out container like nothing ever happened. She comes out and hands it to me. I'm so disgusted. We spent decent money there and to be treated like this is appalling. It is NOT OK to give customers food that has fallen into the trash whether it's in a container or not. Absolutely disgusting. She didn't even wash her hands after putting her hands into the trash can to retrieve my take out container. I made sure to tell her that I was not taking that home because it came out of the trash can. She didn't even apologize after I called her out on it. I will not be coming back to this restaurant and I will make sure I tell everyone I know not to go there either.", "author": "Judy L."}

She was smitten with the garlic noodles, roasted crab and shaken beef, so I decided to give this well-reviewed place a try. \n\nWe were seated immediately upon entering on a Saturday night as we had a reservation, and found the ambiance charming and romantic. I did think it an odd place to dress up since you would be eating the crab with your hands and you get plastic bibs... not some place I'd prefer to have a first date or anything (though the couple next to us seemed to be doing well on theirs). Our waitress was nice, though not was welcoming as some of the waiters who might have been associated with the family (?). We ordered and our garlic noodles and crab came out almost immediately. My dining companion and I are no strangers to crab so immediately we could taste the mediocrity of the over salted $40 crab. The garlic noodles were fine, though a bit too dry. We thought it a bit expensive  (at $9.50) for buttered Chinese style noodles. The shaken beef came out much later than the other two dishes, but was very tasty! It was over salted, as the theme seems to be here, but the beef was very tender. \n\nOverall, 2.5 stars for the high prices and ridiculously over hyped crab/OK garlic noodles. The shaken beef was a saving grace, though a smidge salty. Glad I went to check out the hype, but will not return in a hurry.", "author": "Angela L."}

Seasoned lightly to let the fish flavor show through and act as the hero of the dish. Fished was cooked perfectly - just on the edge of being cooked / raw giving it a very smooth taste. Garlic noodles included here, see review below.\n\nShaken Beef - 4/5. Cubes of New York strip steak cooked medium rare. Nailed the cooking method, but the seasoning was heavy handed and a tad heavy on the oil.\n\nDrunken Crab - 4/5. Cooked very well - crab meat retained its moisture. Lightly seasoned to help the crab flavor shine.\n\nRoast Crab - 2/5. A risk for roasting crab is overcooking, leaving the meat dry. In this case, the crab was just on the cusp of being dried out, an unfortunate followup of the perfectly cooked Drunken Crab. The seasoning was well done, so I suspect that if the crab was more moist this dish would definitely shine.\n\nGarlic Noodles - 2/5. Although very highly rated, it was a complete miss.

Things have changed in the last few years as this place is not as fancy as I remembered. My gf and I were dressed up and felt a little out of place as most other diners were dressed more casual. \n\nWe ordered the Roasted Garlic Crab, Drunken Crab, Garlic Noodles and Garlic Fried Rice. There was not much of a difference in taste between the two crab dishes. They were good and I think better than the Roasted Garlic Crab at PPQ but PPQ has Peppercorn Crab, which is a stellar dish that Thanh Long does not carry on their menu. The garlic noodles are better here than PPQ and the garlic fried rice goes very well with the crab butter sauce. \n\nIt's pricier than PPQ. We paid $150 for all 4 dishes, including 2 glasses of wine with tip included. At PPQ, I've ordered the same amount of food with a bottle of wine for $100.

Sadly, Thanh Long was quite disappointing with high prices and mediocre food.\n\nWe started with the mango salad with seared shrimp and scallop that ended up being the highlight of the meal. The flavors were fantastic although there could have been more scallops. The warm seafood paired with the fruit flavors of the sliced mango and raspberry vinaigrette were really fun and well worth trying!\n\nWe also had the tamarind crab and a plate of garlic noodles. The crab meat was good and well cooked but the sauce was really strange with ingredients that did not go so well together. The tamarind component of the crab did not come out strongly (this wasn't your normal tamarind sauce) and we were quite disappointed with the conflicting and unappetizing flavors of this ~$40 dish. \n\nThe garlic noodles were also just bleh. For $10, I would really like more than a plain plate of spaghetti noodles with a some garlic seasonings. I generally love garlic noodles but at least most places present the noodles with a sprig of greens or extra sauce and charge at least 1/3-1/2 less. Really- with how expensive the food is at this place, I expect a bit more presentation if not better flavor. \n\nOverall, this place was mediocre to average (we count 2 stars as average). The mango salad was fantastic but the big miss on the other dishes plus the unjustified high prices brought it back down to a 1.5 stars for us.", "author": "Amy D."}

Hands down, the best garlic noodles I've ever had. It was so good, I devoured the first place (which I was sharing with my girlfriend) and had to call in for seconds! It was thattt good. Just keep in mind that you gottaaa eat it while it's still hot and fresh.\n\nOld-fashioned Banana Cake - [http://s3yelp1-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/KMontrvWMCv4VSkrDRBLWA/l.jpg]\nIt was a nice warm and chewy contrast to end our meal. It was heavy, for I was already stuffed, but still nice. I only recommend that TL consider serving coconut ice cream, rather than the standard vanilla, but that's just me.\n\n\nSo in the end, my boss was right. It was an impeccable service and experience! (I had all forgotten about the sub-par calamari after sinking into the crab.) All the food came within a ten minute difference from one another, our glasses were never empty, and my favorite part was the hot towel service -- very refreshing and cleansing! (How come other pig-out spots don't offer this!? A tiny paper wet-nap ain't gonna do nothing!)\n\nFYI: the seasonal price for the roasted crab was 38.95, which is a tad more pricey than other restaurants, but well worth it.", "author": "Albert L."}

I think if I would have had Thanh Long prior to PPQ and Crustacean I would be much more impressed. But I can't help but make comparisons. \n\nPPQ has the best value for the food. Thanh Long is definitely cheaper than Crustacean, but by no means a casual dining option. The roasted crab runs at market price and happened to be $40 on this particular night. \n\nAs far as the garlic noodles, I have to rank Crustacean's as the best, PPQ in second and Thanh Long 3rd. However, that being said, all three are fantastic and worth a try.\n\nCrustacean obviously wins in the ambiance category, but Thanh Long is a very nice, quaint place. I like that Thanh Long impresses and is appropriate from anything from a romantic date to a fun family dinner.  \n\nEnough comparisons, let's talk about Thanh Long's food. The mango salad was a nice surprise. It was warm and I wasn't sure what to think about that, but it was good. Salt and pepper calamari was good, but kind of a dish you can find at many other restaurants. The spicy eggplant dish had good flavor and lots of vegetables. We had chicken fried rice (mostly for the baby) which was your typical chicken fried rice. The shaken beef was a definite stand out dish. It was super tender and the flavor was wonderful.\n\nMy only gripe about the crab was they didn't leave the shell with all the juices and good stuff. The shell was turned over and we had to dig around to find some fat (which of course is one of the best parts!).\n\nBy the way, skip the drinks here. They come in tiny glasses that are much overpriced. \n\nAll in all I will probably stick with PPQ as my go to, but Thanh Long is definitely a good option for a special occasion.", "author": "Danielle G."}

Just tea leaves in boiling water for $4.95? Are you kidding me? It's nothing special..., I'd just stick with water. Calamari was good but it didn't have any dipping sauce. Garlic noodles is really good but I recommend you to eat it while it's hot because when it's cold, it doesn't taste good anymore. Finally, behold, the moment we've been waiting for.... CRAB!!!!! It's super fresh like it just got caught from the ocean. It has a good amount of flavor in the crab as well. I have no complaints except that I wanted more! Eating the crab + garlic noodles = satisfying. I love it.\n\nThe service here is far superb.

The use of public space for private business activity is in itself a problem, but worse is the fact that the 18 bus, the local fire department, and everyday traffic, of which there is plenty, must use the narrow opposing traffic lane to travel south for this block of 46th Avenue.

Roasted crab, Garlic noodle, and some vegetables on the side. We are not big eaters and did not want to stuff ourselves to death. \n\nI don't know how they do it, but within 5 minutes (no joke!) of ordering, all our food arrived. They must have roasted crab cooking constantly in the kitchen. \n\nEverything was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I could tell the noodle was not made to order, and probably the crab too. I also like the way Crustacean does their veggies better. You can choose what kind of vegetable you want (up to 2 kinds from what they have that day), and they will saute it in their delicious sauce. At Thanh Long, there was only one kind available (that day, it was a medley of green beans, mushrooms, and tomato). This was not as good as I expected. \n\nOverall, Thanh Long 4 Stars vs Crustacean (Beverly Hills location, have never been to SF one) 5 Stars.

We have a friend who raves about it, but somehow we never made it.  I finally tried Thanh Long last weekend with our friend, and now I understand why she speaks so highly of this restaurant.  I am also regretting that I could have been there a few more times by now instead of just once.\n\nLast Saturday we had a late dinner.  Driving to the restaurant my friend warned me that we would probably have to wait awhile for a table.  I don't mind waiting if the food is good.  However when we arrived we were seated immediately.  It was late, maybe 9:00PM on a Saturday, so if you can wait for a late dinner this may be the time to come.\n\nLooking at the other tables, it was easy to see what to order.  Every table was the same -- garlic noodles and roasted crab.  We started with a mango salad, which was totally yum.  Then the real bomb -- the garlic noodles.  They are simple, I could totally make this at home, but OMG they are awesome!  We also split a roast dungeness crab, another dish that I frequently make when crab is in season, but sometimes it is nice to sit down and enjoy a good meal without having to cook it.\n\nFor the meal we ordered, the Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc which turned out to be a PERFECT PAIRING to our food.  I was proud of myself for going past the rather large Chardonnay selection on the wine list.  I think  the buttery flavor of a California Cardonnay would have been in competition with the other flavors on the table, so I wonder why they had so many on the list?  A white with a little more acidity and fruit was just the ticket.  I had only tried Duckhorn's reds prior to this evening, but I must say the Sauvignon Blanc was remarkable and I will seek out a bottle for home next time I am serving crab.  I usually go for Voigner with shellfish, but they didn't have one to offer...why?  You are  a classy restaurant, get your wines sorted please.\n\nI withhold the fifth star because I'm not that easy.  Thanh Long was a great meal and I will definitely take my wife here when she gets back in town, but it is really priced high.  With tip, dinner for two where we shared a mango salad, split an order of garlic noodles, and had only one crab between us with a bottle of wine was $175 with tip.  Ouch!  My wallet stings a bit.  I can buy 6 crabs this size for $50 off a boat in Pillar Point Harbor, the noodles cost next to zero and the salad was simple enough.  Honestly, this can't be a regular place at this price.  Come to think of it, the company I kept this night may have been the best part, but Ann is like that.  I am lucky to have her as a friend.\n\nBottom line:  garlic noodles with crab and sauvignon blanc, it's all good.  Bring your big fat wallet, cuz you're gonna need it.", "author": "Shaun H."}

But $25 for ONE PRAWN?!\n\nWell I went there again against my better judgement on Saturday night and the food is not any better, but it's much more expensive. I cannot believe the pricing.\n\n$42 for ONE CRAB. Yes, it's got some \"secret spices\" on it, so what? I can get better fresh crab in many Chinese restaurants for half the price. For that kind of money I expect live lobster.\n\n$37 for FOUR SMALL SHRIMP. It's not even one huge \"how did they even find a prawn this big?\" prawn anymore, it's FOUR SMALL SHRIMP on a bed of garlic noodles. With \"secret spices\". The real secret is that they're laughing all the way to the bank getting people to pay this kind of money for something that should be $12.\n\nThe place has gone upscale, with fancy expensive mixed drinks, and better decor, but you pay for it.\n\nThen there was the service. Constant, polite attention, but always a feeling of being rushed so they could get the next seating in. When I ordered the vegetable soup with seafood wontons (btw the best thing we had), I asked to split it with my dinner partner. Not only did the waiter forget to bring a bowl, but he brought the soup AT THE SAME TIME as all the entrees! Who does that? Who in their right mind brings soup at the same time as entrees? Someone who wants cold entrees, that's who. I asked him to bring my entree back because it was going to get cold, and he said he'd have the kitchen make another one, but he was a liar, and just put it under the lights. It was drying out when it came back.\n\nThe prawns were extremely average (and overcooked having sat under the lights while I enjoyed my soup), the crab a PITA to shell, Dungeness always is, so much work for so little meat. If you really want good crab order fresh King Crab legs from many places in Alaska and have them overnighted once crab season opens, you'll enjoy tender succulent huge sausages of meat that don't need \"secret spices.\" Or anything, you just eat them.\n\nI was disappointed that the prawns had shrunk, and the noodles are fine, but if you really want noodles go to a good Italian place, they do them better.\n\nDessert was a lemon sorbet with cream inside a hollowed out lemon. A for presentation, but they should just skip the cream. Either make ice cream or sorbet, but the mixing of the two is an unhappy marriage.\n\nI literally have no idea why this place is popular, and how they can get away with charging what they do. The food is average at absolute best, and the pricing is ridiculous.", "author": "Rob C."}

However, as our dinner progressed the restaurant started filling up with people. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nRoast crab: SO GOOD. I don't understand how they get the garlic flavor infused into the crab meat... but whatever they do it tastes delicious. I've had the drunken crab here before too, but i think I prefer the garlicky flavor of the roast crab more.\n\nSaigon beef: This was surprisingly good. The beef cubes were tender, and not at all chewy. The sauce it was in wasn't too heavy, which i liked, and tasted good with the garlic noodles.\n\nGarlic noodles: Definitely need to order this with the roast crab.\n\nBetween the two of us we finished almost everything, but had some noodles and a couple crab legs leftover.\n\nOverall had a great experience at Thanh Long, and will probably come back again.", "author": "Michelle L."}

Bejeezus... so good.\n\nRoasted dungeness crab: Simple, but fantastic. It's so meaty, and the seasoning just topped it off with every bite. You'll have lotsa of fun scouring for the meat, and every bite will motivate you to keep at the cracking,  digging, and picking for even the tiniest bits and pieces between the shell :)\n\nShaken beef: wowowoowwoow such incredibly soft beef that it was amazing how soft it was the next day after it had been microwaved (yup all 3 dishes for 2 people can be a bit much haha). I especially enjoyed the fact that it had been served with a side of spring mix and tomatoes + potatoes which lightened up the entire dish and kept it level in all aspects of taste. \n\nGarlic noodles: I liked these, but they have been a bit dry for me? Not something I'd recommend ordering as a dish on its own, but to eat betweem bites of other mains like we did during our meal :)\n\nCost: 4/5 - you're going to have to expect to pay a premium here for not only their food but there service as well which was some of the best service I've had while visiting SF.\n\nThe service: 5.5/5 - (that score is not a mistake, the service here is that good) With a restaurant as packed as this was, we were still greeted with a smile by the front of house and quickly granted a seat for the two of us. Afterwards we were promptly attended too by a waiter who quickly took our order of drinks while we browsed the menu. We were able to flag him down as soon as we made up our and then barely into a full conversation with my boyfriend, all 3 dishes mentioned above appeared at our table! It was also very kind of our waiter to tie the plastic bibs around our neck as well. I found that I was never out of water, and that there was always a fresh bowl to be used to discard our shells. Empty plates were taken before we knew it and it was great that they had provided a personal shell cracker for each seat at the table already. The staff here is well trained and in numbers that are able to attend to all the patrons of the restaurant while providing a delightful experience where we didn't have to \"understand\" how busy they were. True class.\n\nThe ambience: 4/5 - Your typical family run asian restaurant! A welcoming place for families and adults alike. Sure the place can be renovated to feel more modern (feels alittle old), but as it stands right now, it's completely fine the way it is :)\n\nIf you would like to splurge on good eats, here is the place to do it.", "author": "Monika-Bianca T."}

Customer service was pretty on point, the waiter was friendly and attentive. He memorized our order (which was quite a few items) without writing it down, but sadly forgot one of the appetizers. All good, since I'm sure we over ordered anyways.\n\nOur dinner consisted of one of each of the soups, salt and pepper calamari, collasal tiger prawns over garlic noodles, lemongrass chicken, vegetarian entree, chicken fried rice, and an extra order of garlic noodles. Although the serving size wasn't as big as we had pictured, this was more than enough for the 5 of us, so in retrospect, the serving size was pretty decent.\n\nOut of all the soups, we all voted that the vegetarian soup was the best. Something about the clear broth and the assorted veggies just made it more refreshing versus the creamy aspargus chowder or the chicken vermecelli soup.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari was good as well, served sizzling hot, with a good combination of salt AND pepper, but for a couple of the outlying pieces, there was definitely a lot more salt than pepper. \n\nAs for the entrees, it was pretty mediocre, not fabulous, but not disgusting or unedible. There was just nothing outstanding about the meal. The main dish I liked the most was the collasal tigerl prawns over garlic noodles. The noodles were seasoned to perfection and it got my whole family scooping for more. The prawns were pretty good as well, although I could definitely taste the layer of butter in between those suckers. However, I'm not too sure how to justify 4 pieces of prawn over a bed of garlic noodles for 37 bucks. Seems a little bit outrageous.. pretentious to some.\n\nAgain, like I said, the meal wasn't bad, but for the price of the dishes, I was expecting something more amazing. Overall, a good dining experience, food was pretty good, glad I tried it once, but nothing coaxing me to be back for another round.", "author": "Ada C."}

We also tried the stuffed calamari but it was meh.\n\nThe garlic noodles are tasty but with crab in garlic sauce after awhile, it becomes a single monotonous note. As someone mentioned in their review, white rice probably pairs better with the crab.

The latter was definitely my favorite for it's very unique sweet tangy flavor. The flavoring of the Roasted crab was somewhat more oily and not as flavorful/garlicy as the one from PPQ.  (Most of all, I really missed the incredibly delicious dry flavor of the Peppercorn crab from PPQ.)\n\nThe Garlic Noodles here were on the softer side compared to PPQ, and I really prefer a nice firm al dente noodle with a bit of a chew to it.\n\nThe Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns were a huge letdown. There were .. 5 or 6 prawns only.\n\nVegetarian Delight was described as silken tofu sauteed with assorted vegetables and shitake mushrooms.  I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant, but I am really used to eating a Chinese version of this with a crispy-fried tofu.  The tofu was a mushy-soft texture, and the vegetable selection was meager.

So if a restaurant gets this rating from me, they deserve it.  Hands down, flat out, case closed, done dig-giddy dada (I know... just go with the moment).\n\nI've heard a lot about Thanh Long and looked forward to trying it.  I got the opportunity when in the Bay area this past weekend.\n\nI've been an advocate for \"hole in the wall\" restaurants over chains because 1. I think the food most of time tastes a lot better and 2. The intimacy of a small establishment caters to my \"less crowd, less noise\" mantra.\n\nFrom the outside, Thanh Long does not look impressive.  But when you notice a flood of people going in and coming out either something illegal is happening or they have really good food.  Thanh Long has really, really, good food.\n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated and my hats off to the bartender.  I'm not a big drinker at all.  That said, I think every person should have a signature drink.  For me, it's Drambuie.  Because it's not an average drink and only consumed by the most worldly of people (ah-em), I can tell instantly the status of a restaurant when I order it and the waiter says \"huh, what's that?\"  Or the bartender simply smiles and says, \"I'm sorry sir, we don't have that.\"  He knows that you know, the sophistication of their restaurant is FOS at that point.\n\nThanh Long serves Drambuie.  I'm just saying.\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate - just how I like it.  \n\nWe ordered the Crab, fried rice, garlic noodles and mango salad.\n\nThe mango salad was nice.  Teased ever so gently with shrimp and thick cuts of mango.  I didn't care for it being slightly warmed, but I didn't mind either.\n\nThe fried rice was delicate, delicious and just amazing.  The garlic noodles were awesome.  The next time I go to Panda and they're talking \"garlic noodles,\" I think I'm going to just call the police.  Thanh Long's garlic noodles are by far the best I've ever had.\n\nThe Crab, unless you don't like getting your hands dirty, then you need to order something else.  Steamed in pepper and other seasoning with just enough of a buttery hint that I was sitting at the table licking my fingers.  Yeah, I know. No table etiquette, but at that point I didn't care.  And if you're wondering, it was so good I would have ate the shell.\n\nI'll be going back to the Bay area in another month and I'm already making reservations for round 2 at Thanh Long.\n\nWhat better way to acknowledge their food is that good.", "author": "Mark Darren W."}

They do have valet parking right outside the restaurant. This place may be expensive, but it is totally worth it! The roasted crab is simply heaven. The head is already taken off for your consumption. They already give you crab crackers and a bib so you can get down and dirty. Trust me, you have to get dirty to enjoy the crab. The crab came out in 5-10 minutes within ordering which is a definite plus. The one negative about the place is the service. Most of the waiters and waitresses seem extraordinarily busy, so some things may take longer like asking for a refill. The garlic noodles are a gift from heaven. We loved them so much that we ordered two plates and devoured them. Make sure each person gets their own crab because once you have a bite you won't want to share haha.

Crab cracker tools, big bowls for crab shells, and plastic bibs are provided for all patrons who choose to abandon all forms of etiquette and succumb to the delightfulness of the roast crab.\n\nWe also ordered the colossal royal tiger prawns, served on a bed of garlic noodles. Again, the tiger prawns were delightfully seasoned and the garlic noodles are perhaps the best I've ever had. My boyfriend succinctly describes the noodles as \"starchy with a bite and not oily at all.\"   \n\nAlthough we were pleased with the quality of the food, the atmosphere did not live up to the price of the check.

We concluded that we rather pay a bit more at Crustacean for nicer ambiance.\n\nAll in all, reservation is highly recommended if you do not want to wait.

We both ordered the roasted crab and since it was our first time there we ordered one garlic noodles and one garlic rice. We went to town on our crab and had to take the garlic noodles and garlic rice home, but it was still tasty a day later. Service was awesome, we made reservations and were seating right away.

I've been here for special occasions and I've been here for a \"just because I was craving for it\" kind of meal. I always get the garlic noodles and roasted crab. Always. It's just a must have combination when coming to a place like this. My boyfriend loves their tiger prawns which already comes with a plate of garlic noodles. The prawns are huge and delicious. I've also tried their salt and pepper calamari which were very delicious! Maybe the best calamari ever.\n\nMake sure you get you're own plate of garlic noodles! You will regret it if you choose to share with someone, trust me. And also make sure to make reservations. If you come right when they open there may be open seating. Since this place is so popular, I always make reservations just to be safe. \n\nThe service of course is always great and surprisingly fast! I ordered once and went to the restroom to wash my hands and when I came back, my crab and noodles were already on the table! \n\nI can't wait to go back!", "author": "Danielle L."}

I took my parents out to dinner here earlier in the night and as soon as I told my dad about this place he did his own research.  Of course, when he searched Thanh Long Yelp.com popped up and he read all the reviews about the crabs.  So as soon as we sat down he ordered prawns wrapped in wonton,  three roasted crabs, one plate of garlic noodles (that soon later turned out into two orders), and a soda for my mom.  It was funny that he ordered all that without asking my mom and I, especially me since I was the one paying the bill.  But as high as my expectations were, I think Thanh Long meet the expectations and perhaps a little more.  My dad on the other hand, he's traveled the work and says that this isn't his best meal but one the top meals that he's had.  \n\nThe prawns rolled in wonton was a small appetizer for three, yet very good.  \nOne plate of Garlic Noodles is enough to feed two people.\nThe crabs are market price (The roasted crab was excellent).  And the head was taken off of the legs so that you wouldn't have to struggle with pulling the crab apart.\n\nThe service was excellent.  Our waiter had a great sense of humor and was friendly, as well as patient with us. \n\nIt gets really busy a little after they open, so I suggest coming around the time they opened.  \n\nI think I made my parents critics of food since the found out about yelp and read the reviews on this place.

There were already a bunch of people lined up outside before they opened. Most had reservations and we didn't but got seated right away. Parking wasn't too bad this day (Sunday).\n\nWe ordered the famous garlic noodles and shared a crab. I honestly don't think the garlic noodles were \"spectacular\", but it was GOOD. The garlic taste from the noodles tasted very artificial, like there was a whole bunch of \"garlic powder\" or something in there.... You know how you eat ramen noodles or something out of the package and you put the powder stuff all over the noodles? Well, it kinda reminded me of that, except garlic flavor + a stick of butter...very salty, overpowering garlic-y taste. Maybe it's just me, but some people love this taste. I guess it just reminded me of my broke college days. \n\nAlso, there is a lot of BUTTER used in the food.\n\nThe crab was pretty good. cooked with a bunch of butter and garlic & salt/pepper. Then again, i'm not a huge crab eater, nor do I like having to \"work\" to eat my food. I don't like to get messy when eating my dinner. Why did I come here again?

We ended up getting the roasted crab, garlic noodles, calamari and seafood fried rice that everyone was talking about. The food come out within 10 mins so we were happy about that. The calamari was kind of plain so we had to ask the waiter for chili paste. The garlic noodles is not the best in town, it was a bit over cooked! they could have done better. Also the fried rice was mediocre. Now for the main reason why we came to the restaurant, the crab. Everyone said the Roast crab is a must try and they love it. In my opinion I could have cooked it better at home. The flavor was okay but the crab was cooked well. We had to ask for salt, pepper and lemon just to dip our crab meat in because the seasoning was only on the shells so it wasn't that tasty. If they had Tabasco i would have enjoyed eating the crab more. Our tab came out to 220 dollars. Each crab was 53 bucks! Was not worth it.

Thank God my sister made reservations because dinnertime on a saturday was packed!  People who didn't make reservation were told the wait could be up to 2 hours long.  We, however, were sat within 10 minutes of our reservation time.  \n\nWe had the salt and pepper calamari and crab puffs to start.  Both were okay (and relatively cheap, ~$10 each).  The salt and pepper calamari was good but doused in spices, which made the actual seafood flavor lessened - a quality that some might not enjoy.  It's also tossed with some veggies, which our family also happily munched on.  Not the best calamari we've ever had but also not the worst.  The crab puffs were ordered on our waiter's suggestion and they were good, too - soft on the inside with the outside perfectly golden and crunchy.  Did not try to sauce that came with it but by my mom's continuous dipping, I'm going to assume that it was good.  \n\nFor our meal, we ordered 2 roast crabs and 2 orders of garlic noodles.  We are a family of five - this, plus the two appetizers, were not enough for us (we went for ice cream after).  The garlic noodles (~$10 an order) were delicious but, seriously, tasted very similar to Red Crawfish's garlic noodles (a.k.a., if you want a delicious, but in a more casual setting, similar meal, perhaps think of RC as an alternative).  The Roast Crab was delicious and our family destroyed it within about 15 minutes.  Seriously do not remember the exact taste because we were inhaling our food.  My sister said that both dishes were a little too garlic heavy for her to have together but they were fine with me.  Each crab was about $42.  \n\nAll in all, the ambiance was great but if you like seasoned seafood and want to eat without any reservations (pun intended) you should probably visit one of the less bougie places that dot the bay area.  If you are trying to impress a significant other (or potential significant other) do not go to this place, where you're tempted to pull apart crabs with your hands and suck the meat out from the shell.", "author": "Therese Jane R."}

But all are tastier than what you would get at any restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf. The Drunken Crab is made with Chardonnay, sake, brandy, green union, chive and black pepper. The Roast Crab is roasted with garlic sauce and black pepper. \n+ It is a fine dining restaurant with nice ambiance. They also have a sister restaurant in SF called Crustacean. \n+ The place is pricey. But it is definitely worth the visit every once in a while for special occasions. I discovered this place through friends about 15 years ago when I lived in the Bay Area. Now I came with my family during my visit for Thanksgiving and it has turned into an annual tradition. \n\nCons \n- The service here is not what it used to be. The waitress mixed up our soup order, and was not always available when we asked for napkins, bowls and to refill the water and tea. \n- The food is good.

If you order crab, it will average $70 per person after soup and noodle and before any alcohol and dessert. \n- Street parking only, which is typical of most restaurants in San Francisco. \n- The place is super busy.

I keep telling myself to try something different like the Shakened Beef, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I have strayed and tried the Garlic Rice and Colossal Tiger Prawns (along with my garlic noodles) and it was just OK- something I can probably replicate at home. \n\nOne thing I like about this place, besides the casual dress code, is the service. It never fails that when I make a reservation, my friend is always late. I've never been told that they have to give the table to another party, in fact, I'm told I can grab a drink at the bar and wait.

This place came HIGHLY recommended by a friend and it seems the Yelp community also supports it (generally speaking). \n\nThe bf and I had just finished driving up from San Diego, and we arrived tired, hungry, and hopeful.  Walked in around 6pm, and the wait at 25 minutes.  Ok, that's fine, we're already here and it seems like everything else on this block is closed.  So we waited.\n\nOnce seated, as suggested, we only ordered the roasted crab and garlic noodles.  These items came out SUPER fast and smelled delicious, but unfortunately for us, that was the high point of the meal. The garlic noodles are essentially ramen noodles, unsalted, blandly seasoned with garlic and (supposedly) parmesan cheese. Not good.  The crab was delicious, but that is because crab is naturally delicious. The \"roasted\" part of the crab meant that it was doused in butter and had some parsley sprinkled on. Really disappointing.  \n\nFor $70+ for two dishes (and some jasmine tea), I expected a MUCH better meal.", "author": "Jennifer F."}

Ordered the same thing each time.\n\n1. Thanh long mussels with garlic crostini- $12 for 5 pieces of mussel and 5 pieces of garlic crostini. \nAt first I was like, uh wth, a box of mussels cost only $3.99 and a baguette is $1 and you are only going to give me five pieces of each?!?! But this stuff is off the hook, has a pesto sauce on top of the mussel. I usually take the mussel with the pesto/buttery goodness and top it on my crostini..MmMMm...a must try!!\n\n2. Roasted crab- $37-40\nWaiter usually recommends that one crab per person. First time bf and I tried that and two garlic noodles. Next time we decided to eat like Kings and get two crabs and 1 garlic noodle since I can make garlic noodle at home. This is a must try if you are a first timer! The peppery, buttery sauce is to die for!! I dip every piece of lump crab meat into the sauce, the clogged arteries will just have to understand.\n\n3. Tamarind crab- $37- $40\nOMG OMG OMG I freaking love this one. Yes, the roasted crab is good, but this one has sooooo much flavor. If you like sweet/sour stuff, this is a must try. When I ordered this, not only did I dip each piece of crab meat into the sauce, I LICKED the sauce on the shell and everything, NO SHAME AT ALL. When there was no more crab left, I even dipped my fingers in the sauce just to taste the sauce for the last time. lol\n\n4. GARLIC NOODLES- $12\nBELIEVE THE HYPE. This stuff is so addicting, I wish my plates were bottomless. Whiling stuffing my face with all this garlic and buttery goodness, I contemplate how many more plates I should order and how many more I should togo. The noodles here are like no other, you can replicate the flavor, but you can't replicate the texture due to the noodles, believe me, I have tried! Recently found out from a friend that they order their noodles specially from a private owner, so I have stopped searching.\n\n5. Fried banana with iced cream- Always a hit. Two scoops of ice cream with two fried bananas and chocolate syrup.\n\nService here is awesome- You'd think that eating crab at a fancy place like this would be awkward, but they have it down to a science: Waiters are constantly changing out your garbage bowl, they put on a bib FOR YOU, and they even bring out two rounds of piping hot towels so that you can clean your hands.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS PLACE IF YOU GET THE CHANCE.

I'm sure there are tons of butter in the noodles to give it that rich flavor.  The place is a bit pricier than lets say..PPQ which has great crab.

The day of, I see this sort of hideous, unassuming exterior--it looks like any generic abandoned Richmond/Sunset shop/boutique.  When we enter, it's a completely different story--dimmed lighting, modern decor, tablecloths, etc.  We are ~10 minutes late (parking was a pain in the neighborhood), yet they seat us promptly.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful (they helped us pick out items for our group and make recommendations based on our party size). I order a bottle of wine that ends up being a twist-cap, but our waiter still makes the motions and lets me sample first.  When it comes time for eating, the staff helps us put on our bibs, brings extra napkins without having to be asked, and replaces our plates and bowls whenever things started to get messy.  Oh yeah, and brownie points on attentiveness--my water never goes empty.  (Sort of silly, but small gestures like these make for a good impression with me.)\n\nThe food itself, in summary, is rich and filling in the most gluttonous fashion. We had the Mango Salad (warm with a perfect hint of charred flavor), and the Traditional Vietnamese Salad (it was good, but the other dishes overshadow this one). You might need a coronary bypass after going through the Thanh Long Mussels, Roast Crab, and Garlic Noodles, but it's worth every cent of your health insurance deductible if you have it.  You see the oil on the plates,  but with every bite, your senses don't register it as \"just\" oil.  Instead, a bite of the garlic noodles dressed with some drippings from the roast crab feels like your mouth is being coated in silken, mouth-filling luxury.  As you swallow, you are overwhelmed with a noise in your head--that noise is your brain screaming, \"MORE MORE MORE!!!\"\n\nPure crack.\n\nWhen the bill comes, we see gratuity tagged on, but it's pre-tax and pre-alcohol (as with everything else, Thanh Long gets it right).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-07", "description": "Yep, you've guessed it...my boyfriend and I came to Thanh Long because we heard about their famous roast crab and garlic noodles!\n\nWe arrived shortly after they opened at 5pm and there was no wait. Once we were seated, we noticed the full bar and decided to order a couple of drinks to start off our night. I ordered the fleur de mango and the boyfriend ordered the Hanoi sunset (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=5AnN3N7w7JTwsWHvz8rcug). The fleur de mango was really good. The rum flavor was subtle and masked by the freshly blended orange juice and sweet mango puree. I had a sip of the Hanoi sunset and it tasted ridiculously strong. It tasted as though I was sipping on a straight shot of alcohol. My boyfriend shared the same feelings--he had to force himself to chug down the alcohol laden martini.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the chicken satay (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=XH78FALuoyCY-PemWsm18g) and salmon carpaccio (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=g2SQ3ayDT3W9Fm9seQQEVw). The chicken satay was pretty disappointing--three skewers of grilled chicken came out on a plate with no dipping sauce. The chicken was a little on the dry side and it tasted really bland. Usually when I eat chicken satay, it is always served with a side of satay peanut sauce for dipping. Oh well, the tasty salmon carpaccio made up for the disappointment. I love refreshing dishes like the salmon carpaccio, as the flavors of the simple ingredients are truly highlighted. The buttered-bread, capers, and lightly lemon-marinated salmon all combined deliciously.\n\nAnd of course, for our entrees, we shared one roast crab and an order of garlic noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=1bMAC3tQqYuN0JkIZRKVqQ). To be perfectly honest, I wasn't that impressed with the roast crab. It was definitely juicy, meaty, and big, but the flavors weren't that great. It definitely didn't live up to all the hype. On the other hand, the garlic noodles were to-die-for! I'm a huge fan of garlic and the garlic noodles were sooo soft and garlicky. I've tried garlic noodles once before and the garlic flavor wasn't as distinct as the garlic flavor in Thanh Long's garlic noodles. I give their garlic noodles 5 stars!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had an overall good experience. We enjoyed the intimate, but comfortable ambiance. The customer service was excellent and extremely attentive. I'll probably try the colossal royal tiger prawns with garlic noodles next time.\n\nP.S.\nCheers to my 100th review! :D", "author": "Lien T."}

All the other reviewers before me have already pointed out the obvious. This. Place. Is. Good. I always always always get the roasted crab. I've had friends try the other varieties, such as the drunken crab, and it's good, but there's a reason they're FAMOUS for their roasted crab. And frankly, I'm not one to rock the boat when it comes to sticking to what I know won't disappoint. \n\nThey're actually the sister restaurant to Crustacean. I believe both are owned by the same family, and it's apparent in their cuisine. The decor differs a bit. Thanh Long is just a tad less pomp and circumstance than its counterpart, but the food and service are just as good. I did recently try the shaken beef, which was absolutely delicious. Tender, juicy, and wonderfully flavorful, it's a tad sweet and perfect with rice, it would be a good alternative if you're allergic to seafood or just not in the mood for crab (for shame). \n\nOverall, the roasted crab and garlic noodles just can't be beat when you're eating here. I would, however, say that both dishes are drenched in oil, so you should consider that it's not the most ideal place to eat if you happen to be trying to lose weight. But if you're like me, which means either you're on a diet and you have no self control OR anything delicious does not count as something \"bad for you\" in your book, then seriously get your butt over there and eat to your heart's content.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-26", "description": "I came here with a friend from out of town looking for a competitor to PPQ Dungeness Island. The restaurant is situated in a fairly residential area, but then again, I guess most restaurants in the Sunset/Richmond area qualify.  The restaurant's layout is a little interesting, as the back portion of the restaurant was walled off leaving a nook for 6 tables and gave the restaurant a closed-off feel.  The frozen cocktail my friend ordered was mostly sweet without much alcohol, disappointing even for her.\n\nThe jumbo prawn wontons are not jumbo by any account (granted, I had eaten at Anchor Oyster Bar earlier that day, so my sense of proportion may be completely skewed), and you can barely taste the pancetta at all, a very forgettable dish.  The Buddha roll, on the other hand, was like a slight variation on a traditional Vietnamese spring roll filled with tasty daikon and black mushrooms to give it a more earthy flavor.  The Dungeness crab puffs were like crab rangoons on crack, filled with delicious herb cheese and a large quantity of crab, only limited by their size.\n\nThe garlic noodles here have somewhat more of a bite and stronger garlic flavor compared to PPQ Dungeness Island. However, I have to say the crab, albeit meatier, was not nearly as flavorful.  We ordered the roast crab which, although mildly peppery and actually with a good amount of sweet meat, otherwise was not as heavily seasoned.  Strangely enough, our crab was actually a little cool by the time it got to our table.  Also, the seafood fried rice was lacking in salt.  Thankfully, they brought some chili sambal to our table upon request.  Our server was really very nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, based on pure food comparisons, PPQ Dungeness Island wins in my book purely based on the crab's flavoring, but Thanh Long may actually serve a better crab and definitely has better garlic noodles.  If you're looking for crab on a Tuesday, this is your place... (cuz it seems everywhere else is closed!)", "author": "Gene C."}

The maitre d' said no problem had kept our table open, when they could have given it away.\n\nWe ordered the tamarind crab, which is cooked in tamarind and tomato with other seasonings. The crab was perfectly cooked and the tamarind sauce with its slight sweetness complemented it perfectly. We've had the roasted crab before and felt the garlic sauce was too overpowering and took away from the delicate taste of the crab.\n\nWe complemented the crab with garlic noodles and Jasmine rice.  The garlic noodles are the best as compared to other ones we've had at other Vietnamese restaurants.  Not oily with just the right amount of garlic.  Always trying to replicate it at home, but just haven't come close to it.\n\nFinished our meal with the fried bananas topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.

My friend brought me here--he had previously had the garlic noodles and some crab soaked in butter, and he wanted to try the full crab.\n\nHearing the price of $45 for the crab, my friend changed his mind and ordered the noodles again and some squid. \n\nThe menu is tiny. Mainly a few seafood dishes and some odds and ends. I ordered the Vegetarian's Delight, and it was the most flavorless dish I can remember ordering at any restaurant for years, the worst vegetarian's delight I've had. The sauce was watery tomato juice, basically unseasoned, hardly even any salt (no salt on the tables). \n\nWhen the waiter came to ask whether everything was OK, I told him, No the dish has basically no flavor. He offered to steam the vegetables. Strange! Does this waiter know anything about food? This is the point where most waiters would offer to replace the dish, but no, this waiter seemed quite clueless. So I asked for some condiments (many Vietnamese restaurants have LOTS of different condiments). All he had was hot sauce and soy sauce, so I had to make the dish edible (barely) with those. This was a tasteless plate of 30 cents worth of ingredients, priced at $14,95, way more than I've ever paid for veggie delight. I call it Vegetarian's Despair.\n\nAs an appetizer, we had the Buddha Roll. It was small, and the \"peanut sauce\" was basically intensely garlicy soy sauce with a couple other ingredients. Disappointing also, though not terrible.\n\nThis place apparently just throws gobs of garlic and butter at most of their dishes, and people flock to it. Lame. Why would anyone go here when there are literally hundreds of amazing, inexpensive East Asian restaurants in SF? \n\nThe decor has a dingy feel, with uninspired decorations. \n\nThe only reason this place gets more than one star is that my friend liked his garlic noodles again (an easy dish to make at home).

The food at Thanh Long was sub-par at best, especially considering the prices. I didn't get the crab because none of the three offered preparations were authentic (Garlic, Drunken and Tamarind- westernized versions of a mash-up of a variety of SE Asian flavors) and it was mid-May, which means Dungeness crab was approaching the tail end of its season. I decided instead to try their other seafood offerings-\n\nSoft Shell Crab- Minuscule portions, looked like the chef took absolutely not time or effort in preparing them. They would have tasted better if they were sold on a street cart by the beach and I had some sandy grit in my mouth to go along with them. Inauthentic, Maine style soft shell crab, but not meaty.\n\nPrawn Toast- This was passable, but how can you go wrong with bread smothered with garlic and cheese with some shrimp. Probably the easiest thing to make. Again, completely inauthentic. No sesame, soy or scallion flavors. White bread and cheese? WTF? Fail.\n\nRed Snapper- Where do I start. I expected this dish to be prepared with a whole fish wrapped in some sort of banana leaf, but it instead arrived in the form of two limp, overcooked fillets. The sauce was too thin and not flavorful, it lacked a sense of completion. The only redeeming quality of the plate were the garlic noodles everyone here is raving about. They were flavorful, albeit slathered with garlic and sesame oil, so how can you go wrong. The nature of this type of noodle preparation is to be a little soft, but these were overcooked and did not hold their texture/ collapsed on my fork.\n\nThanh Long- Don't do it, take your money elsewhere.", "author": "Rem K."}

Shaken Beef, Fried Calamari, Banana Cake, and Fried Pineapple.  Well, as Porky Pig would say, \"That's all folks!\"  This is one of those \"will try soon\" spots for me.  My friend from the 808 chose this restaurant for a weekday dinner.  He'd been to Crustaceans, but, after a horrendous service experience, insisted on trying this, the original location.  \nFor me, the crab (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=XofCPzceEnZS1dKdCvP5iQ) rates a 3.5 star as I'm not a huge black pepper and butter fan.  The crab is fresh and meaty while the garlic noodles are a great accompaniment to this dish; the noodles were a bit on the sticky/starchy side (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=UVMpGevOAtNkI5csC8LdpQ).  My friend even ordered an extra container of the garlic butter sauce for dipping (later taking the rest home).  The Fried Calamari appetizer came hot, but the flavor was okay... nothing spectacular (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=CLaIPDlObi1_v5ACPPQ1NA).  The waiter recommended the Shaken Beef (stir fried Filet Mignon cubes, fried potato cubes, and onions on a bed of lettuce, garnished with halved cherry tomatoes) cooked medium, but, preferring a more tender texture, we requested medium rare (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=AJoZPi_TbmkRazShdSX5FQ).  This was my favorite of the meal.  The desserts were also okay as the Banana cake tasted like a bread pudding (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=ph8LCE3wLbB9GsbhrolD8A) while the Fried Pineapple reminded me of sweet, Fried Onion Rings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z9CN58fSrA46ggyb6OnCnQ?select=BiEG4_CWYHz0aYTCPqPgmg).  \nMy friend also had a mission of delivering two roasted crabs back to Oahu a few days later.  Asking the waiter for his advice and the reheating details, my friend successfully completed his task with flying colors.  The greeter, the waiter, and the busboy were very amicable and gave us an \"at home\" feeling while we were here.  The water and iced tea glasses were constantly filled and empty plates quickly removed.  Having a 6 pm reservation, we also secured a parking space 0.5 block away.  There is valet parking available for $10.00.  The food rates 3 stars in my book, but the service and atmosphere boosted it up 1 additional star.", "author": "Mike C."}

Is it worth the price? Cousin would say yes. I only say yes because it was my uncle's treat. I probably wouldn't spend that much otherwise.

I called on the Thursday before to make a reservation, made it for 5:30pm on Mother's Day. Perfect. They called on Saturday to confirm, awesome. They reminded me to make sure everyone was on time because we wouldn't be sat until our entire party was there. \n\nTypical of our family, one of my siblings was running late - therefore they wouldn't seat us. My Mom was mad and irritated because to her it didn't make sense because we knew what they wanted to order. After practically yelling at the hostess, they still didn't seat us - I was embarassed. The hostess remained calm and tried to explain to my Mom why they wouldn't seat us. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know why they won't sit full parties - it puts their entire reservation schedule off track - if two people of a seven party table is late, it extends their duration at the table once the two LATE people do get there, and causes the table who will be using that table next a delay, and so forth throughout the evening. \n\n30 minutes after our reservation time, my late sibling and her guest arrived, I kindly let the hostess know that we were finally all there, she told me that the only table available that sits 7 is currently paying and as soon as they leave, she'd be able to sit us - this was \"the best that she could do at this time.\" - I thanked her nicely and proceeded to apologize for my mom's reaction and that I understand why they couldn't seat us. \n\n5 minutes later - she came to me and said that she had another table available and we could be seated right away. While following her she told me that she appreciated my apology and to enjoy my meal. \n\nFood: \nDungeness Crab Puffs - delicious - a great appetizer for a larger group, there were 6 in one serving. \n\nSalt & Pepper Calamari - a little too much salt on this one, still good though!  Next time we'll try the Grilled Calamari \n\nShaken Beef - HOLY MOLEY DELICIOUS - Meat was SO tender and so flavorful - definitely recommend this. \n\nSiagon Beef - Not my favorite - the rest of my family like this but unfortunately this dish did NOT please my taste buds - I felt as though maybe the ingredients were way above my appreciation but it tasted too bitter for me. \n\nDrunken Crab - this was delicious - a whole crab, dunked in a secret sauce of Chardonney... \n\nRoasted Crab - this was EVEN better than the Drunken Crab - amazing. \n\nGarlic Noodles - MUST HAVE AT THE TABLE. These are the staple dish of every visit, in my opinion. \n\nI really like this place - I've had the Garlic Noodles before on their An The Go mobile food truck. Definitely will come back here. \n\nPS. Parking is a pain - but they do offer Valet for $12.00 - valet guys are funny.", "author": "Cat G."}

Fortunately, we set reservations because this place was packed!\n\nSuperior service. We were told our table would be ready by 8:30 and our name was called right on the dot. For starters, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari. The calamari was good, though I'm usually used to having some sort of dipping sauce with it. Lightly breaded. Then we ordered to the Vietnamese traditional salad, which was the perfect starter to a heavy meal; it was light and refreshing. \n\nAs for the entree, each of us had one roast crab each. Previous reviews definitely reflected well; the roast crab is delicious. It seems as though they must marinade the crab ahead of time (probably why the restaurant doesn't open until 5) because the crab came out quickly but was still tasty. We paired the crab with two orders of the garlic noodles - great combo. The noodles are rich - garlic-y and buttery YUM - and went well with the crab.\n\nFor dessert, we had the fried banana with ice cream. Each order comes with two fried banana portions and one scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum! \n\nUltimately one of the best meals I've had since moving to the Bay.

I went in to have dinner with a few of my friends who had already sat down and when we went to be seated there was only four chairs at the table. We pulled another chair from a different table and added it to where we were being seated because there were five if us and after a couple of minutes the host comes and he tells us that we can't have the chair there and that he can move us to another table but that chairthat my friend was already seated in does need to be put back. Mind you my friends that were already there we're already in the middle of eating so all their food was set on the table crabs pulled apart excetera. So we told the guy is it okay if we just leave the chair there for about 10 minutes while we finish up eating and he said no and we told him should my friend just stand there? He goes on to reply yes he can stand there but he can't pull a chair and sit down there! Either way whether he was seated or standing he would still have been in the same position taking up the same out of space so it didn't make sense why he didn't want to allow us to pull a chair and add it to the table never mind the fact that the restaurant was empty.  Secondly since my friends were in the middle of eating already it made no sense for them to have to take all their food and move it to a different table. I started saying this is super rude I've never felt this this disrespected at a restaurant and the server comes up and he says well you can leave if you want. Never in my life have I had someone be this rude to me for no reason and I think it was because of what we were wearing and the people we were with. I receive better service at McDonald's! Ivy and I all kinds of high-end restaurant clothing restaurants like benu and honestly I am so disappointed at the service and that the mannerism of the people that work there it's just ridiculous how they treat people because of how they look.

Top 5 for sure.  \n\nMy friend kept raving about this place and how great the garlic roast crab is.  I L-O-V-E crustaceans, crab legs and lobster tails rock my world.  Garlic not so much.  I of course use garlic in cooking to enhance a dish and can appreciate its use, but you're not gonna find me eating at The Stinking Rose where that shit reeks of almost raw garlic, ew.   So, I was slightly skeptical as to whether I'd enjoy this garlic crab, and the garlic noodles that you can order as a side dish.\n\nWe walk into the restaurant, and I'm pleasantly surprised to find out it doesn't have an overbearing garlic smell to it.  Awesome.  I was tempted to stray from convention and try the Tamarind crab, or the Drunken crab (cooked in white wine and olive oil I think), but everyone kept stressing how legit the garlic roast one was.  Ok, I caved.\n\nBoy, I've never been so happy to cave into peer pressure as I was Friday night.  The garlic roast crab was sooooooooo delicious, I went to town on that motha.  I kindof pride myself on my waspy crab-eating skills, I can pick every single morsel of meat out of a crab leg, which I did again that night.  Honestly it's a lot of crab meat so many of weaklings out there might want to follow in the footsteps of the couple next to us and \"split a crab.\"  I don't know what \"sharing\" or \"split\" a meal means as I've never done it myself, but I hear some people don't experience the food coma afterward, so I guess try it if you want.\n\nOn to the noodles, which again sounded super dicey to me.  I envisioned half-cooked garlic which would make me vomit.  Ohhhh silly girl, silly naive Jo.  No no no no- the garlic noodles were exquisite.  They tasted faintly of garlic, and like McDonald's fries, had to have a touch of sugar in them b/c they were slightly sweet and addictive as fuck.  Score.\n\nAs a sidenote, this place is a nicer restaurant, you still get a bib but it's definitely not a hole in the wall crab joint.  With that said, I wouldn't recommend it for a first or second date, b/c most girls will squirm at the thought of cracking crab legs (which might mess up our outfits, God forbid our date's crab gets flung inadvertently into our hair), and the garlic factor too, just don't do it.

Now that I'm here in the bay, I finally got to try it and I now know why my cousins won't  stfu about this place. I can now join my cousins as we can't and won't stfu about Thanh Long.\n\nThanh Long is slightly far from the heart of the city, near 46th street.

We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, thanh long mussels, roast crab, and garlic noodles. The salt and pepper calamari was the first dish to reach our table. I didn't really enjoy the dish because the batter made some pieces taste stale while other pieces were crispy. I sat at the table thinking, OMG I hope this place gets better or else I'm going to scream at all my cousins for this shizz. The second dish we received was the thanh long mussels. It was mussels with a pesto sauce on top of a slice of buttered bread. YUMMY!!!! By this time I thought a good dish canceled out a bad and was feeling better about Thanh Long.

The spring rolls were good too, but nothing special. \n\nThe waiter was kind enough to let us know that we could easily share crab (instead of ordering one per person) and share the noodles. Both were very, very good. Definitely the best items on their menu. And since not everyone in my family is as big of a fan of crab as I am, we also ordered a combo fried rice and their shaken beef.  The rice knocked it out of the park; the shaken beef - not so much. It was a bit rubbery and much too sweet.\n\nOverall, a great experience at a high cost.", "author": "Roxane W."}

Since it is crab season, I was in favor of her suggestion.  I visited Thanh Long more then 20 years ago.  Back then, it was a dive with cheesy decor.  It has been up graded with a full bar and frescos on the walls.  The restaurant is well lit and comfortable.\n\nOnce you walk in, wading through the crowd in the tiny front lobby.  tip-make reservations for two or more.  there's a full bar on the right before you walk up to the host station.  \n\nWe started off with a traditional Vietnamese salad comprising of shredded cabbage, and shrimp in a kind of sweet rice vingarette sauce.  The crab was in butter with copious amount of pepper, tasty.  Ordered the garlic noodles too.  My companion added chili sauce to the already tasty noodles to, \"give it a kick.\"  Great idea!  Add the crab meat and Ooooo.  Don't worry about messing up your clothes, they put on a huge plastic bib on you.  They also give you hot towels to wipe your hands after eating crab.\n\nWe sipped a lemon drop with Chambord.  Good.\n\nDinner coupled with great company and it was a nice time and meal. \n\nService was very attentive, but not intrusive.  \n\nI would give it more stars except it was not spectacular in uniqueness.  Although I noticed there are varieties of other delectable items on the menu.  Who am I to say?  There were people still coming in at 9:30 for dinner.", "author": "Wayne L."}

We gave a number and had a drink down the block, before you know it its been about an hour. I call and they said our name isn't on the list... I get put on hold and a different lady said she called our names but we weren't here..... I mention that we left our phone number and I never got a call. She just responds just by saying that we can be seated right when we get there. \nWe get there and not one apology, and we did not get seated right away! We had to wait another 10 minutes. We finally get seated and still no apology, they were not even friendly!\n\nWe had a lot of issues with our experience, but we were not the only ones!!!! The couple next to us had to send back 2 dishes! One for not being hot and another for not having a certain side or something was missing. The couple behind us really got into it and it actually caused an argument between the two because the \"laid back guy\" didn't want to complain but the girl wasn't having it. Her soup was cold and he yelled at her for \"ordering more of something she didn't like\"... The guy though despite him not wanting to complain couldn't eat his crab for a half hour for some reason or the other. I thought it was his left over crab! When the manager went to go grab it he stopped him and said it was fine.... so he ended up eating cold crab by himself because his date left him. They brought out her soup and he just took it to go.. DRAMA!!\n\nWe had a pretty dim waiter.. I just wanted the garlic noodle with some chicken, to add meat you apparently have to order an appetizer and they just put it on top of the noodles. So the $9 noodle dish turned into a $20 dish to have 3 pieces of chicken on it... the whole place was grossly over priced (and I am talking about their non seafood dishes). \nTwo people who were seated AFTER us had got their appetizer AND their meals before we got our appetizer... when the waiter brought out ONE of our dishes we asked where the appetizer was? He said he will bring it out but we said never mind since our meals will get cold so we just want to cancel the appetizer. We ended up getting the appetizer for free so that made up for it.... however we NEVER got checked up on and when it came time for dessert we were hesitant, but I was celebrating a promotion so I wanted to go for it. We almost changed our mind because it took him about 20 min to come back and take our dessert order! We order the chocolate molten cake and 20 min later we get fried bananas... The guy even repeated our order!!! He takes it back and brings out the cake... and the cake was overpriced.. it was something you buy at Safeway and microwave, only we paid about 3x as more. Smallest molten lava cake I ever had at a restaurant. \nWe were their 10/5/13 got there around 8pm got seated sometime after 9 and left sometime after 10:20pm.... Dinner for two should not take that long of a process. This place sucks but I really wanted their garlic noodles, some girl had it for lunch at work and the smell I could not get out of my mind... she warned me of the bad service but I didn't know it was that bad!

But the mediocre, overpriced food at Thanh Long has beat out my laziness.\n\nI used to eat at Thanh Long as a child and absolutely LOVED it. We had reservations for 4 for my brother's birthday dinner two nights ago, and needless to say, I will NEVER return! The food was comparable to a buffet in Reno. \n\nGarlic Noodles were lacking. It didn't taste anything of fresh garlic. Instead, the noodles were soggy and overcooked, with the flavor of garlic salt.\n\nMango salad was probably the only tolerable dish we had that night. The vinaigrette was light and sweet, but the portion was pretty small.\n\nThe shaken beef was a huge disappointment. The entire bottom of the plate was covered in chopped romaine lettuce, but was hidden under beef, giving the impression that the plate was full of beef. In addition, there were ample chopped potatoes sauteed to LOOK like beef. There were maybe a total of 9 piece of actual beef on the plate, for about $20-$25. \n\nThe sea bass was absolutely bland. It was cooked with no seasoning, AT ALL. The saving grace for this dish was the accompanying sauce on the side, which had a slight sweet, citrus flavor to it. For $25, the serving of sea bass is smaller than the average portion for one person. There was ONE bok choy cut into thirds on the side of this dish. I'm pretty sure bok choy i s$0.79/lb at the supermarket. If you're gonna skimp on the portion of the fish, you could at least use more than one bok choy.\n\nThanh Long has always had a special place in my heart for their crab. No more. The roast crab we ordered came out lukewarm. This would've been tolerable had the crab actually had flavor. It looked like it was covered in black pepper, but had no taste at all = pre-ground black pepper. I RARELY use salt to cook, and my usual complaint when I eat out is that the food is too salty. This crab didn't have even a pinch of salt in it! They used to use so much butter in their sauce that when it cooled, the bottom of the dish would be covered in coagulated butter.

No, not really. This place is great. The locals know it. Tourists may end up at Crustaceans (Thanh Longs' downtown SF location), instead of the original location - but one truth remains the same: the food is good.\n\nNow we all know that the garlic noodles are Gewd. We all know that the Roasted Crab is GEWD! But what about the rest of the menu? I have this firm belief that if you deem a restaurant a good place to eat, and I mean OHSOGOOD to eat, its menu HAS to be delicious. Its what keeps us coming back, right? So into my foray into the deeper regions of the menu I found: Shaken Beef.\n\nNow coming to Thanh Long, the goto items are naturally the crab and garlic noodles, but if you accompany your meal w/ the shaken beef...*drool. Its a prime cut of meat saut\u00e9d w/ a sauce that makes this dish DELISH. You will usually see the shaken beef dish in higher-end Vietnamese restaurants, and Thanh Long's Vietnamese influence mos def shines through with this dish. Although a bit pricey ($20 at the time of review), its a trete de force for the red meat enthusiast.", "author": "Ed P."}

I didn't know a thing about the place and figured I wouldn't spend more than $20. I was told to get the crab and garlic noodles The noodles weren't special and neither was the crab. I never had to use warm towels so guess that was bretty cool for dirty crab fingers. I liked the atmosphere and service - it's just the food was not special for $66. For that price, I could have cooked creatures washed up on the beach over a oil drum fire, invited some of SF's homeless people and got $66 worth of $4 slices of toast while we laugh at people actually paying exorbitant rents just to find out when they walk out of their apartment building, they see the homeless taking a dumping.

I know it's a lot of work cracking the shells, but it's just soooo satisfying when you chuck out a savory nugget of meat from a chunky claw. It's like discovering buried treasure. I've tried all three of their crab dishes: roast, drunken, and tamarind. They're all amazing, but I like the tamarind the best because it has the most flavor.\n\nIf you're not a crab fan, the other dishes are also pretty amazing. The garlic noodles are always a must-order. The coconut prawns, satays, salt pepper calamari, and shaken beef are worth trying.\n\nTheir service is spot on. If you have crab, they'll put the bib on for you and regularly take away the empty shells. The only drawbacks for this place are It's not cheap and parking is a pain. Otherwise, I'd order a 10 course crab meal and spend half a day just cracking legs.", "author": "Jermaine R."}

I never knew that crab was such a staple of the Vietnamese diet, but the An's can cook the hell out of a crab!\n\nThere were 4 of us so we split 2 crab, 1 roasted crab and 1 drunken crab.  We also shared a plate of Shaken Beef, 2 plates of Garlic Noodles and 1 plate of seasonal vegetables.  Everything was very good.  The crab was messy but tasty but I especially liked the Shaken Beef.  Very sweet and tasty, similar to the Mongolian Beef at PF Chang's which I LOVE.  I even liked the garlic noodles.\n\nThe only downside was the price of the crab, $40 each!!!! Yikes.

Although the neighborhood was not great and parking was hard to find, it was definitely worth the trek out here. \n\nThe roast crab is sublime. The crab was very well seasoned with pepper and garlic and I love how it was dunked in buttery goodness. Maybe that's what makes the crab taste so good. We ordered the garlic noodles and shaken beef and lots of people say it was the best shaken beef they ever had. The beef was very succulent and full of juice -- perfecto! Garlic noodles are not bad, but it just goes really well with the crab.\n\nAs for dessert, I highly recommend finishing off with the fried ice cream. It's pretty big so you can split it with two or three people. Basically it's ice cream encased in sweet yummy fried dough. \n\nI don't know if this is a great date place, because you guys will end up smelling like garlic (might kill the romance), but it's definitely a good place to go with friends!", "author": "Emily C."}

They must infuse the noodle itself with loads of garlic, because the flavor is out of this world.  There is no way those are regular noodles sauteed in garlic.\n\nUsually 1 crab can feed two people- just make sure that at least one of you is willing to eat the head (innards) of the crab, cause that comprises a big portion of the crab and would otherwise be a waste.\n\nI do hate the location- it's so far out of the city and the train ride takes forever.

Crustacean Restaurant\n\nI have no idea how I forgot to write a review for Thanh Long, but I'm glad I remembered. I have been to both Thanh Long and Crustaceans in San Francisco. They're both are famous for their garlic noodles and roasted crabs.\n\nAppetizer: I ordered the muscles and FELL IN LOVE. Yes, it was THAT good. Thanh Long totally won the appetizer category. \n\nMain Dishes: Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles. I had really high hopes for their roasted crab and garlic noodles, but was sadly disappointed. It was no where as good as Crustacean's. Thanh Long's roasted crab and garlic noodles just tasted like it had been soaked in pepper. The garlic noodles were dry and cold as well. At Crustacean's you can actually taste the flavor of the crab and enjoy the crab and garlic noodles together and it doesn't feel like I'm choking down a mouthful of pepper.\nCrustacean's definitely won the main dish category.\n\nBoth are equally priced, both having great customer service, and both have a lovely interior. Crustacean definitely beat Thanh Long in my book. Sadly, the only thing I liked at Thanh Long was the muscles. The rest of the meal was an utter disappointment.", "author": "Olivia W."}

The only downside I'd have to say is that they require you to have your whole party there before they seat you. I got lucky and was missing a few people but they still seated me. Everyone ordered the garlic noodles (not greasy but I personally think that it could use a bit more garlic flavor, and still prefer PPQ's version). Also majority of us got the roasted crab which was AMAZING, didn't have to put in much work since the shell was soft, but not too soft which was good. The butter/pepper sauce was delicious. I did family style with two others and we also got the seasonal veggies and shaking beef which were both really good. We had three people share a crab, noodles, veggies and shaking beef and it definitely worked well for us. Waters were constantly filled and waiters were very attentive. One flaw for the night was some of the girls ordered sodas and they refilled them, and knowing pricey restaurants.. they don't tell you they charge for a refill until you see it on the bill.", "author": "Tiff C."}

The roast crab it to die for and that's actually what I usually wanna do after the massive stomachaches I get from butter overdose, but its oh so worth it. I've also had the drunken crab and it's an excellent option if you wanna skip the butter and be guiltless. It was flavorful and easy on the stomach.

We had their famous baked crab which was cooked to perfection with lots of butter and an excellent black pepper unlike anything we've had. Peppery yet not hot.

I would order both again and again.  The service is warm and friendly and overall a really pleasant atmosphere.  Worth the trek to the outskirts of the Sunset.  It's getting hard to get really good food in the city without having to wait and that wasn't the case here; we were seated immediately.  \n\nHow good they are at their specialities is the only detriment to other dishes that would  probably seem better anywhere else where they wouldn't have to stand up to that crab or garlic noodles.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-05", "description": "This place serves some very incredible food and some very good food, but it is very pricey.  For $38 dollars, you get one crab in a variety of styles.  The best here is the roasted crab.  It is delightfully buttery and peppery.  The sauce is so good, it inspired my sister to toss her entire bowl of rice into what was essentially a whole lot of crab flavored butter.  Calories be damned.  So, this dish was good.\n\nI was less impressed by the drunken crab.  It was a little on the bland side.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, but the broth was kind of dull and watery.  It could have used a lot more flavor.  The crab was fresh, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nWe also got the shaken beef, which is beef marinaded in a sweet, salty sauce served with vegetables.  It was very tender.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The vegetables complimented the meat very well.  But, the fried potatoes were a bit weird.  I would get this dish again.\n\nThe other good thing here is the garlic noodles.  FYI, it tastes like it has some fish sauce or oyster sauce or crab broth in it.  So, if you are vegetarian beware.  The presentation is really poor.  They come out looking like very ordinary tan noodles.  But, the flavor is salty and sweet with a nice garlic flavor.  It is a bit more on the sweeter side than I expected.  But, it was very good.\n\nWe also had the boulliabaisse, the salmon carpaccio, the soft shell crabs, the mixed seasonal vegetables and the sea bass.  The soft shell crabs are a definite miss.  They lacked seasoning.  The batter was not that crispy.  It was a below average dish.\n\nThe boulliabaisse was a nice fish broth with vegetables floating in it and some rock shrimp that were cooked well.  It was ok.  Just think Tom Yum soup.  Nothing really special.\n\nThe salmon carpaccio was tasty.  The shallots added a nice contrast to the sweet salmon.  But, the portion was very small.\n\nThe mixed seasonal vegetables were well cooked, but ultimately they were just roasted vegetables.  Nothing special.\n\nFinally, the sea bass was a little overcooked.  The sauce was nice and mild.  It was ok.  But, nothing special.  It came with some vegetables in a light sauce.  \n\nI also had a mixed drink.  It was a bit on the sweet side.  FYI, the food here is not spicy, so fruity drinks do not pair well.  It is better to go with one of the dry white wines.  For a Vietnamese place, they don't use a lot of sour flavors, so the dry wine brings a little acidity to the food and makes the flavors come out.\n\nThe dessert menu was not very exciting.  Deep fried banana, chocolate molten cake.  All the standard stuff.  Nothing unusual or complicated.  We skipped it.\n\nThe service was typical for an Asian restaurant.  Not very attentive.  But, everyone was well dressed.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and surprisingly modern inside.  Outside, it looks like a dumpy Chinese restaurant in the Sunset.  But, there are some nice silks and figurines decorating the interior of the restaurant.  This is a good place for a special occasion meal or for a date although the clientele is a bit on the older side (mid to late 40s).  So, it is not exactly hip.  But, your date will appreciate the decor and the high quality food.\n\nA word about parking.  Come early.  Parking in the Sunset is horrible.  You might have to walk a few blocks.  Our reservations were for 6 and we had to walk 2 blocks.  If you eat around 7, be prepared for a hike.  They have valet car service.  So, you have that option.", "author": "Andrew W."}

That's probably why I didn't think much of it when the staff completely looked down on us when my mom and I entered the restaurant.  We had been shopping all day so yea we did not have on our best clothes but we weren't wearing sweats either.  \n\nAnyways, when I opened the menu, I was a little disappointed with the lack of choices they had.  I guess, that's why people love this place because it isn't your typical whole in the wall Vietnamese place hat has about 50 different choices of pho and that's pretty much it- instead they really emphasize their crab.  But because we are both allergic to crab, we didn't have many options to choose from.  We finally ordered some dishes and they were all pretty mediocre but the worst ones were the Traditional Vietnamese Salad Of Cucumbers and the Saigon Beef. The chicken in the salad tasted like it had been cooked many days prior and thrown in the microwave a handful of times and the meat was way too chewy and lacking freshness.

Crustacean is more centrally located in the city and has similar prices, but less of a relaxed dress code (or so I hear).\n\nI'm glad the attire here is casual, because once the bib is on your neck and the crab is on your plate, you are literally digging in. Perhaps not the best spot for a first date, as your hands will be soaked in whatever flavor you decide to get for your crab.\n\nAnd you should get the crab, and the garlic noodles. Both are absolutely fantastic, and you can choose from drunken, tamarind, or garlic roasted crab. We went for the latter two, and decided the garlic roasted is the best. Get one crab per person, a side of garlic noodles is good for two.\n\nPrepare to pay for the experience, though. As much as I loved tearing that poor crab apart, you're looking at over $50 per person before drinks. It's absolutely worth it once for the experience, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to justify going back for the price.", "author": "Ross H."}

So when I came back recently for a birthday dinner, every single person ordered garlic noodles and roasted crab and a bunch of appetizers. Sad to say, it wasn't as good as I remembered. \n\nLychee Martini: for the price, probably not worth it. I was able to thoroughly enjoy it which isn't a good thing for all of you alcoholics out there, seeing as how I can easily k.o. after 1/3 a beer bottle.\n\nThanh Long Mussels: served on a slice of baguette with pesto sauce. this was pretty good, although I didn't appreciate how it was swimming in butter, but hey if you're going to eat at Thanh Long, the last thing you should do is count calories right?\n\nTraditional Vietnamese Salad: i'm glad we ordered some sort of veggie dish. for the most, it was tasty but the fish sauce was overly sweet and not salty/savory enough. it really needs more of a kick that \"Vietnamese vinaigrette\" usually has. \n\nWe also ordered a few more appetizers, but I can't seem to recall them, I guess they weren't too memorable in my book. Oh well!\n\nRoasted Crab: still freakin delicious. I love how no matter what time of the year you come here, the crabs are always ginormous and fresh! \n\nGarlic Noodles: Such a sad disappointment! What happened to the garlic in garlic noodles?? You can smell it, but for some reason you can't taste it at all. *sigh* what a tease! For the most part, it was pretty bland, and tasted like they only used garlic powder, so there wasn't any real, fresh, authentic garlic bite to it. So, so sad. \n\nFor dessert, we all shared a bunch, in case you go thinking my belly is some sort of bottomless pit (I wish). \n\nFried Banna a la Mode: It tastes exactly what it sounds like. it was good, but nothing mind blowing.\n\nOrange Sorbet: it was served in a frozen orange shell and was rock hard. Whatever shavings of this sorbet I manage to get before giving up, was light, and refreshing. If only it was easier to eat. \n\nTraditional Banana Cake a la Mode: Okay, I don't even know how to contain myself on this one. I'm not a crazy fan of bananas, but omg. This has become one of the best desserts I've ever had in my whole entire life. I dream of the day that I go back to Thanh Long just for this orgasmic worthy dessert. I might be over hyping it, but it was pretty damn good. The bananas in the cake added a nice caramelized texture, and when you eat it with a spoon of ice cream, the mixture of hot and cold, sweet and savory all just mixes in your mouth, making it a perfect ending to any meal.\n\nSo to conclude my dining experience, here's your take home message: do NOT forget to order the banana cake a la mode. or else you're just shooting yourself in the foot. Happy eating!", "author": "Thanh N."}

You don't realize the bustling nature and star power of this restaurant until you enter the door.\n\nI notice a crab (or two) on everyone's table as I walk to my seat. The room is fragrant with garlic and spices. This is the real deal, I say to my parents.\n\nWe order the salmon carpaccio and Thanh Long mussels as starter dishes. Capers give the fresh salmon a nice, salty hint. The mussels practically melt in your mouth. Mop up the remaining juices with your bread. Perfection.\n\nGarlic noodles are delicious, but they're nothing special without the crab. Isn't that why you came in the first place? So we order one roast crab. By itself the crab is meaty and fragrant, but the sauce is the extra level. It's like instant gratification when you drizzle that over the noodles.\n\nThe flavor's slightly more subtle in comparison to Boiling Crab, of course---especially if you love the whole sha-bang---but that's where the sophistication lies.

Every table is open in the front, and they stick as back here at the worst one?\n\nAnd really...the food was not mind-blowing. Famous garlic noodles? Please, they were sub-par at best.

We both look VERY young, although we are in our 20's. It was clear that they thought we were just young teenagers, and not worthy of good service. It was extremely insulting.

Even though I have not eaten here as much as I would like, the past three dining experiences were all very good including last weekend's dinner with friends. I have always remembered it being very crowded for dinner so I called to make a reservation.  After everyone has arrived, we were seated promptly at the biggest booth I have ever seen. \n\nI shared a roasted crab, garlic noodles and a bowl of rice with my boyfriend. I have tried some of the other dishes here before including prawns, fried rice and salmon, but in my opinion, the only two things worth eating at this place is the crab and garlic noodles. If you do not eat seafood especially crab, you might not like this place. \n\nThe whole crab is cracked open and cut into fourths so most of the work is done for you.  The crab claws are so big that it's so easy to get the meat out using the handy dandy tool, the cracker.  I really like the the garlic sauce (tons of minced garlic with butter and other spices), which is generously drizzled on the crab.  One order of garlic noodles is good for two to share.  It's yummy, very rich and tasty, but needs more garlic (that may just be because I love garlic)! The fried banana with vanilla ice cream for dessert was good, but I was a bit disappointed with the batter -- it was too thick (too much flour, I think) and was not crunchy. \n\nThe service was quick and friendly, but I felt that they wanted us out right away after we've finished our desserts.  Everything was cleared off the table in a flash and was hoping that the waiter was going to give me another glass of coke after taking my empty glass, but he never returned with it. Oh well, I guess it was a busy night so I understand. \n\nParking can be difficult, but we've been lucky to find a spot every time, plus they offer valet parking :-)!

The shaking beef could be a bit more tender cut.  \n\nAs for the main course (crabs, of course), I was surprised to be more critical (as I've gone 3 years ago to the more \"high end\" looking Crustacean in the other part of the city).  Very heavy garlic and very heavy tamarind flavor fo the two types of crabs that we ordered.\n\nBut seriously, what got me was how much sodium or whatever they put in.

The flavor of butter and cracked pepper just explodes in your mouth.  I'm a big eater so I always have to have my own crab and another entr\u00e9e.  Stick to the roasted crab instead of the tamarind crab.  The sauce on the tamarind crab is a little sweet for my taste buds.  The Thanh Long spicy eggplant is good, but nowhere near spicy.  As for dessert, don't get the bread pudding.  The orange sorbet was good and the presentation was clever.  It's a frozen orange sliced across the top with orange sorbet inside.  It's nice, light, and a good ending to any meal.  \n\nAt about $40 per crab, it's not cheap.

I even schlepped out on a rainy, windy miserable night where I could've just sat at home eating ramen and been happy.\n\nThe dinner started off well enough with the salt and pepper calamari and the mango salad.  My fleur de mango mixed drink was decent but tasted more like banana and coconut than mango.  Boyfriend's pineapple ginger-infused vodka was better.\n\nSurprisingly, though, the biggest disappointments were the restaurant specialties that have seemingly made this restaurant famous:  the roasted crab and garlic noodles.  The crab was small and mealy, and once you suck away the tasty salt and pepper sauce from the outer shell, you're left with bland, crumbly crab that did not taste fresh or well-cooked.  There was not much crab fat under the shell either. Perhaps they aren't sourcing their crab from a good provider.\n\nThen the garlic noodles arrived.  My impression can be summarized as the following:  meh.  I'm pretty sure I can reproduce the same dish with some spaghetti and a lot of butter and garlic.\n\nBoyfriend thinks that I should come back and give them a second chance because any restaurant can have an off night, but given how sad it was and given that the highlight of the meal was when said boyfriend sent a crab leg flying, barely missing the lady sitting next to us when he tried to pry it off the crab body , I'm gun shy to say the least.  His response actually was, \"Well, as least it's one less leg we have to eat.\"  If that doesn't speak volumes, not sure what else would.\n\nI'd rather blow all of my money on the salt and pepper crab at R&G Lounge.

Wow, it made us feel warm and fuzzy right away, a good way to start your \"family\" dinner! =)\n\nWe had reservations (that helps b/c it gets really crowded) and my sis ordered 4 roast crabs, 2 orders of garlic noodles, steamed veggies, 2 appetizers (forgot what they were), 2 bottles of wine, and honestly, I forgot how many dessert drinks we ordered. At that time, I was having my own party, yet again.\n\nOverall, service was great and food came out fast and steaming hot. Definitely pricey but really well worth every penny. The boy categorizes this place as really \"special\" occasions. I only paid $130 for my part, for a party of 6 but the boy said he saw my sis put down about $500...that's how pricey it is IF you get the same amount of food we got.", "author": "Cath M."}

That was a little annoying. Next up we asked about the Riesling by the glass and bottle, we opted for the bottle and had to inform the bartender to chill the remainder of the bottle while wait to be seated.\n\nInhale, exhale, I get over that. So my party of 14 were seated upstairs in the larger area, everyone pretty much ordered the salt & pepper crab or tiger prawns and garlic noodles or rice.\n\nI myself ordered the eggplant with prawns and chicken with a side of garlic noodles.  Can anyone tell me why all the crab and tiger prawn orders come out and people are chowing down and my plate is nowhere in sight? I was furious, I asked to speak to the manager, who didn't come upstairs after 5 minutes of me waiting on him. So I had to take it upon myself to go downstairs and asking him when and if my food was ever going to arrive. At the rate service is my party will have completed their dinners before I receive mine.\n\n10 minutes later they finally arrive with my plate and the manager says it's on him. Really, who else did he think was going to pay for my meal? In fact, I should've been given a comp to return for this horrendous service. \n\nBeing that the gratuity was included with the bill our waiter's service was just plain God awful. \n\nThis is hard economic times and when you go to Thanh Long you expect exceptional service.

The place is great, the meal the most memorable I've had in months.\n\nTo begin with: a full bar, which was nice for us martini-files. Began the meal with two starters:  the seafood dumplings and the shrimp toast. The dumplings: pleasant, light, delicate. More a tease than filling, but a nice tease.  The shrimp toast:  wow.  I've had countless versions as an former ny-er but this was a whole new trip. Lighter but still flavorful -- on slices of biegnet, a nice tip of the hat to the French influence of Vietnamese food.\n\nThen the main meal: Shaken beef, tender and succulent in its not-too-sweet sauce with a surprisingly perfect compliment of potatoes. Spicy eggplant, just spicy/savory enough to let the eggplant shine through.  Seasonal vegetables: mostly sugar snap peas, lots of mushrooms, absolutely wonderful. Now mind you I don't like mushrooms as a rule but I would have been happy to scarf these down anytime. Garlic rice: just pungent enough, wonderfully textured and sticky, enhanced all the other dishes.\n\nYes a little on the pricey side... and valet service is ten bucks, not five (thankfully we got street parking). Service was gentle and professional.\n\nI relished every bite and look forward to returning to see about those crabs and garlic noodles.", "author": "John Z."}

YES, I do!  \n\nHowever, please note that the Roast Crab deserves 5 stars.  The other dishes I ordered deserve a 4 star.  Also, since there was only 2 of us, we did not get to order a large variety as I would have liked.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n-Dungeness Crab Puffs\n-Roast Crab\n-Garlic Noodles\n-Lemon Sorbet \n-Jasmine Tea\n\nMUST-TRY!  The minute the Roast Crab came, it looked amazing.  My mouth started watering as I started to eat my first bite of the crab.  What seemed like the most simple of spices - salt, pepper, garlic, butter (of course I don't know the \"secret  spices\" haha), made the meat perfect, not overpowering in any spice.  It might be a challenge to crack the shell, but that's the fun of eating seafood!  \n\nOn to the other dishes now,  the Garlic Noodles was so-so, it was tasty, but not all that as others have raved.  The Dungeness Crab Puffs was good for a first try, but would not order again.  It actually tasted better without the accompanied sauce. For dessert, we tried the Lemon Sorbet, that was yummy, but I hope it really is homemade! Jasmine tea was a nice touch, but $5 for that was not worth it!\n\nA plus for this restaurant is the customer service, all servers were attentive and provided good service.  There is even valet parking service, strange for me since I rarely see this in the Sunset neighborhood.\n\nThe only thing now is I need to go back again and try more dishes.

I say, park a block or two down and use that money for an appetizer, but that's just me.\n\nI also strongly recommend that you phone in before you go, just to reduce your wait time. My brothers and I came on a Sunday night (8pm) and everyone who walked in after us had a 30 min wait time. Plus, there isn't much room in the waiting area besides a few chairs and the nearby bar. I do suppose that waiting helps build up your appetite because the restaurant is filled with its delicious aroma...\n\nFOOD-\nThe reason we came was for the crab, which everyone has recommended. We tried both the roasted crab and the drunken crab. Hands down, we all preferred the roasted crab. Shoot, I'd even say forget the drunken crab, the roasted crab has way better flavors and seasonings! You can decide for yourself. The crabs were fat and juicy nonetheless. I'm Filipino, so for anyone who needs rice, be sure to order some to soak all the yummy juices and seasonings. You're gonna be licking your fingers! Oh and if you're wondering about the cost, the crab is at Market Price per pound.\n\nThe garlic noodles were also recommended to us by family. One order is good for 3-4 ppl, but since I was with my two big brothers we ordered two. I wasn't as crazy for the noodles probably because all my attention went to the crabs. But as it is one of the signature dishes, you should try it. If you were on a budget and had to pick between rice and noodles though, I'd honestly say go with rice.\n\n33 beer is the perfect compliment to your crabs!\n\nLastly, we had the mussels and the calamari for appetizers. The calamari was lightly battered and really tasty. The mussels were exquisite!\n\nService was great. The waiters are always switching out the bowls for your empty shells. Also, at the end of your meal they give you hot towels for your hands, not to substitute you washing your hand but the hot towel helps with the crabby garlic smell on your hands.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

FRESH.  i have eaten a crapton of crab in my life as a good chinese person do, and this crab had clearly been dead for some time and no amount of delicious seasoning can hide that.  as for the noodles, if you like your noodles sweet (my japanese husband did), then maybe you will be okay.  they certainly give you a lot of it for $9.95. for me, it was way too sweet and way overcooked.  i tried to save it by dipping it into the crab seasoning.  \n\noverall, it was meh.  the portion sizes are good, but the dead crab didn't do it for me.  if it's $41.95 (it's a market price dish) at the height of dungeness crab season, i cannot stand the idea of paying God knows how much in july.  a nice experience, but i wouldn't escape 3 babies and drive an hour into the city for this.", "author": "alinna s."}

The place was nearby and it had crabs and garlic noodles, so we gave it a try.\n\nFinding the place wasn't hard, but looking for a parking spot is another story! I saw them offering valet parking for $10, but I didn't think it was worth it. Found a spot (lucky) after 5 mins of circling around. Went in and the place was PACKED! They told us that we might have to wait about 30-40 mins... I was tired so I waited. 15 minutes later we got a table (lucky x2!)\n\nFoods that we ordered:\n- Grilled Calamari for starter - pretty tasty and good. A good dish to start off with. In fact, most of their starters looks good too.\n- Roasted Crab (originally I planned to order the drunken crab, but the waiter asked if this was my first time here or not and told us that people recommended the roasted crab over the drunken crab). The crab was delicious, huge, and good for both my girlfriend and I. (GF is a small eater, so probably you might wanna order 1 crab per person). However, I did find it a bit dry.\n- Garlic Noodles, first time eating such delicious garlic noodle! I wonder if they do take-outs? If they do, I think I would drop by from time to time and just get this to go!!! YUMMMM!!\n\nThe price was on the expensive side! My total came around 70ish to 80? I forgot... but it was well worth it in my opinion.\n\nSUMMARY:\nPros - great food, cosy atmosphere, and some nice services!\nCons - hard to find parking, might need to make reservation since it is a small place, packed (our table were very close to the other customers), and expensive.\n\n5 STARS in my book!", "author": "Gordon L."}

The garlic butter taste gets really old after a while, and not to mention it solidifies pretty fast.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant is really nice, fancy and modern.

Crying inconsolably because his parents was too focus devouring their crab that I wonder if they were even listening to him. \n\nAbout the old lady; logically rejected after offering herself to take care of the baby once the mum finally clean her hands and carry him until he stops crying. This old lady already knew how good and addictive is eating those crabs. She had good intentions, she understood.\n\nAbout the Dungeness crab in the Bay Area. This poor things finish their life as stars in a runway one after another over a plate carried by the servers; continuously, like in a sad crab march. Roasted, garlic-ted, buttered, spici-ted and too delicious to be pro-crab.  And also because they must be confuse about what Green dragons means, or the corresponding Vietnamese words, Thanh Long, as I bet one of the first things this crabs learn is to be afraid of them when is in fact they are a symbol of Good Luck and the reason for the owner to keep this name after a typing mistake, as she thought it was a good omen, instead the original Thang Long (in honor to Vietnam's first capital city)\n \nReally sorry for myself, as crustaceans are not my favorite seafood to eat. But also because its a fact that they taste naturally good without any addition other than salt in the boiling water. And roast them with garlic and 5 spices sauce sounded like a crime to me. And also because messiness wearing white clothes sounded like a crime as well. And even more. A multi-million dollar restaurant empire, was uninviting too as superstars can be disappointing sometimes. And because to pray for a table would have decide me to turn back automatically. \n\nBut I didn't .. And I'm so sorry .. I think? ..  about how much I enjoyed the crab. \n\nBut sorry about the crab too because when I tasted the garlic noodles ...  I had a favorite already\n\nAnd sorry about you, the one who I shared the crab with, as you didn't have enough patient to take out as much meat as you can and mixed it with the garlic noodles. Because the crab is amazing but crabs are born tasting good already. And ok, I admit roasted in this way with the secret sauce makes them much better. But the noodles, that is all Thanh Long's work, and are incredible in texture, al dente and a bit chewy too. And flavor; juicy, comfortably greasy and very tasty. Add some crab meat. An improvement of what already taste incredible.\n\nI'm also sorry about the rest of the menu since the crabs and the noodles are everywhere. I'd love to go with a group as looks like is the only way to try more items. We still ordered the salt and pepper calamari. Very good. Lightly battered, soft texture but firm too with a hit of black pepper. \n\nAnd I am also sorry.. very very much.. as we couldn't avoid to order their Fried ice cream. A huge ball of warm, tasty, soft and light dough filled with a cold ball of creamy vanilla ice cream. Sorry because this was already too much food. But more sorry because I had space for just 2 bites. \n\nBut If I am really sorry. Really.. is about all of you that haven't taste this crabs and the noodles, yet.", "author": "Laura A."}

The sauce on them is something miraculous -- very salty and savory (defines quintessential umami). \n\nCrab is their specialty. You want to try a crab dish when you're here. They only have three kinds of crab: Drunken crab (white wine sauce/cooking liquid), tamarind crab, and roasted crab (We've tried both the tamarind crab and the roasted crab (butter and garlic sauce). \n\nThe tamarind crab was okay, but the tamarind sauce was good but so overpowering compared to the delicate taste of the crab meat. You can't even taste the crab with the tamarind sauce laced throughout this dish. It is so tangy, sweet, and sour. It was good for the first few bites, but I couldn't eat much  of this. \n\nThe roasted crab, however, was divine. Garlic and butter -- what could be better? Not much more to be said than that. The crab meat was very light and tasted fresh. Very rich, though, from the butter and garlic so definitely not something to eat too regularly. \n\nWe also tried the shaken beef dish, and it was pretty delicious as well. Very tender, juicy, and well-seasoned beef. Juiciness/tenderness is often a factor that goes wrong in this dish at many restaurants, because if you pan-saute small cubes of meat, they often get dry and stringy. No such problem here! If you have any people in your company who don't like crab or seafood, there are many options, including the shaken beef, available for delicious dining besides crab. \n\nThe calamari appetizer is something else that we've had here, and it's delicious as well. \n\nGreat food, okay prices (crab dishes are all \"market price\"), and a great spot in the city. You will have to get valet parking unless you want to walk a couple blocks, so bring cash!", "author": "Anh D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-08", "description": "We came here for a special family celebration and it was our first time dining here as well.\n\nThe food ordered for our dinner comprised of the following:\n\n1. Salt & Pepper Calamari - delicious except for the simple overdose of coarsely ground black pepper; will definitely tell them next time to adjust the black pepper with a lighter touch\n\n2. Mango Salad - fresh mango fruit sauteed with bell peppers, seared scallops & shrimp over mixed greens in a raspberry vinaigrette - this would make for an excellent  meal on it's own; the raspberry vinaigrette nicely tied the various flavors together effortlessly\n\n3. Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant - eggplant sauteed with jumbo prawns, chicken, fresh basil, baby corn, shitake mushrooms, & red chilies in a tamarind & chili-soya; I like spicy but it was on the low end of the spicy spectrum on this dinner outing though the overall flavors were good ~ will order it again but tell the server to make it spicier\n\n4. Villager's Favorite - Pacific prawns & pork medallions simmered in a caramelized reduction of soy and herbs; I liked this dish enough that I would order it again; a nice take on a \"surf and turf\" with pork instead of beef for the \"turf\" portion\n\n5. Shaken Beef - tender cubes of marinated New York steak flambeed in Chardonnay served with potatoes, mixed greens & cherry tomatoes; delicious in flavor with fork tender beef; the greens I could do without as it seemed more a \"salad\" than an entree\n\n6. Vegetarian Delight - silken tofu sauteed with asst. vegetables & shitake mushrooms; a standout as I love tofu and veggies!\n\n7. Roast Crab - a whole Dungeness crab roasted with An's garlic sauce & secret spices in the Secret Kitchen; regardless of what others may say, this in of itself is a delectable Dungeness crab entree!  Yes it's messy but who cares?  The flavors marry very well and our entire party enjoyed this dish.\n\n8. Garlic Noodles - An's famous noodles made with their secret garlic sauce (perhaps the one used on the Roast Crab?) & secret spices; this noodle dish is good when hot but at room temperature or worse, cold, it's not that good (something coagulates on the noodles when it's cold...butter perhaps?)\n\nDespite the large amounts ordered per item, we had lots of left overs (crab included) for our party of 18.  Would I go back to this spot?  You betcha!  I want to try the Tamarind Crab - \"simmered in a melange of Roma tomatoes & tamarind, seasoned with fresh dill & green onions & flambeed with cognac.\"  The ingredients for this dish make me salivate just thinking about it.\n\nThere is a full bar in case you want a drink while you wait and/or with your meal.  Two of us ordered the Fleur de Mango - pureed fresh mango, Malibu rum, a banana rum and freshly squeezed orange juice to the mix - this was the fave drink of the evening!  \n \nWhile parking is an issue, it's located in a neighborhood folks, get there early so that you can look for parking or just valet your car.  I would also suggest booking a reservation so that you are amongst the first seating for the evening.  Overall, the service was excellent/attentive and the food was delicious.\n\nThe name of this restaurant came about due to an error at the printer's.  It was supposed to be \"Thang Long\" meaning \"Ascending Dragon\" and also Vietnam's first capital city.  As \"Thanh Long\" it means \"Green Dragon\" ~ green representing happiness and prosperity while the dragon symbol is an ancient symbol of good luck.  I would say the An Family has enjoyed this for many years serving a legion of happy customers ~ myself being a newly minted one!\n\nNote - The An Family also owns the Crustacean group of restaurants with a Palo Alto opening targeted for this September 2010.

They cook the crab with chardonnay, sake, and brandy which makes it even more spectacular. (Secret, I could have easily slurped up the sauce/juice/au jus or whatever it's called. Actually, I probably did).\n\nThe shaken beef was tender, juicy, tasty, and all that jazz, but Thanh Long is famous for crab and there is a reason for that. It is a good sized portion. Great beef quality and very, very tasty, but I was just in the mood for MORE CRAB PLEASE.\n\nThe roast crab was also good, but I found it to be a little too dry.

It was BUSY, I assume any holiday you want to get there early and definitely have a reservation. We got there at 5:30 and by 5:40pm when we were seated (with reservations for 6) the waiting area/bar was packed to unmovable. We were seated promptly and we had the cocktails we ordered in about 5 minutes, for 4 people that's pretty good when they are slammed. I had an Ohio Punch, this drink is like a fruit punch long island iced tea, delicious and you'll be set for the whole meal, I debated having another sincerely since it was apparently strong, good price at $8. We also ordered two garlic noodles to share ($11 each). Honestly the noodles arn't anything to write about, even though it's one of things they are famous for. A little dry, not a ton of garlic flavor, but then again if you mix it with any of the dishes it seems to come alive. The Garlic Crab we passed over, $48 for one maybe 2 pound crab, no thanks, couldn't even smell garlic when 10 of them passed by (-1 star). I ordered the Saigon Beef, it was unassuming, and amazing. The dish looked like large tater tots of beef sitting on a salad with dressing. Anything but, the savory beef roll-ups were stuffed with prosciutto and swiss cheese, cooked medium rare, and smothered in a sauce that tasted like a peppery vinaigrette. It was warm and went with the mixed salad greens surprisingly well, I would order this again, big portion too. For dessert we had their Creme Brulee to share. It was out in less than 5 minutes, golden brown, crisp top, and so creamy, it was delicious. The atmosphere was great, from the outside you think it's just a hole in the wall place, but it opens up into the huge two story restaurant that is wonderfully set up to be sound dampening.

My pareng Jimmy kept telling me about this place called Thanh Long that had amazing crabs that were decked out in a nice garlic pepper sauce.  I've heard about this place for months now.  Being from San Diego, it took awhile to try it but it was definitely worth the wait.\n\nThe place seems like a hole in the wall from the outside.  The location isn't the prettiest in the world so it made me kind of skeptical of the place.  I walked in and saw a BUSY environment filled with people waiting at the door step.  We had reservations so we got seated fairly quickly.  \n\nThere's a full menu of things to order but we went simple and went straight for the crab.  At first we decided to go with some appetizers so we started off with the cheese wontons.  They're decent.  I'm not sure I'd recommend getting them.  I'd probably say just wait for the main course.  The crabs are HUGE.  We were a party of 7 so we decided to order 4 king crabs and some garlic noodles to accompany the crabs.  We went simple with our order.  We ordered two of the drunken crabs and two of the \"roast' ones that featured a nice peppered garlic sauce on it.\n\nWe got our order after about 15 minutes.  Not too shabby.  Good food takes awhile so I wasn't really concerned with the timing.  I took one bite of the roast crab.  WOW.  The peppered garlic sauce is AMAZING.  I don't think I've ever tried crab THAT GOOD.  I broke off a couple of legs and began digging in.  I dipped the crab meat into the garlic sauce and felt heaven after each bite.  What makes things even better was the garlic noodles.  They're SO GOOD.  I think I had like two plates of the garlic noodles to myself!  I ate so much food.  There's also a bunch of crab fat in the head.  Just writing this review is getting me hungry.  Unfortunately, I'm back in San Diego!!!\n\nI also tried the drunken crab.  It's alright.  I don't think I would order it again though.  I think my next trip would consist of roast crab, garlic noodles, and sapporo beer.  Keep it simple.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and EVERYONE.  \n\nIf you are in the LA area, I believe the owner of Thanh Long also owns CRUSTACEAN.  I think it's a upper scale version of Thanh Long.

However, it was still relatively small compared to other restaurants.  I thought the table arrangements were all packed together.  My boyfriend and I had one of the better tables, but we were still relatively close to the table next to us.  I felt like we had to whisper so they wouldn't eavesdrop on our conversation.  It was a really loud type of environment.  Everyone is talking among each other so you can hear constant talking in the background.  (which i didnt bother me as much)\n\nThe food came out in a quickness!  We had salt and pepper calamari for starters and I thought it was really good, but wish the portion was bigger.  My boyfriend wish there was ranch for him to dip it into (LOL-- hes a ranch lover when it comes to calamari)  Then we ordered shaken beef with a side of jasmine rice and tiger prawns with garlic noodles.  I was going to order another side of garlic noodles, but my boyfriend told me to taste his first.  Boy, am I glad that I didn't order a side of garlic noodles.  I'm a big garlic noodles kinda gal.  Their garlic noodles weren't so bad, but it was really buttery.  I love my garlic noodles to be more of on the garlic side.  But, I've had better garlic noodles.  Their prawns, to me, personally was too salty.  But my boyfriend thought it was perfect.  The dish was 36$ bucks and I personally wouldn't have ordered if it was 36$ bucks. I would have gotten crab or something.  As for the shaken beef, it was 23.95$ with a side of jasmine rice 2.75 and i thought the shaken beef was perfect.

The garlic noodles were decent but super small portioned. The \"garlic bread\" was a joke..it seemed like someone chopped up a baguette and just buttered it. Where's the garlic?

Of course we had heard about the roasted crab and garlic noodle hype so we wanted to try it for ourselves.  \n\nIn the beginning...we ordered the garlic noodles and the Shaken Beef.  We weren't sure if we were ready to share a crab that night but quickly changed our minds after we saw crabs being served to surrounding tables.  We called our waiter over and asked if we could change our order and without hesitation he said it was no problem.  As he turning around to head to the kitchen...the Shaken Beef was on it's way out!  We felt bad about switching our order at that point but he insisted it was no problem and continued his way back to the kitchen with the beef.\n\nOrdering the crab was definitely the better choice and it wasn't too much at all.  Along with the garlic noodles, I felt like I was in butter heaven.  Both dishes were superb and hands down the best crab and garlic noodles I've ever had in my life.

The roast crab melts in your mouth and the garlic noodles are seasoned perfectly.\n\nDriving up to the place you will think that your GPS made a mistake - it really is in the middle of nowhere. The residential streets around are empty but then you'll see a glow of light emanating from Thanh Long's front door, and inside it will be bustling with people. \n\nIt is pricey though, so my recommendation would be to save it for a special occasion.

A lot of people hang out at the bar and have a few drinks while they wait for their table.\n\nI have to say, of all the garlic noodles, theirs is my favorite. It has the best texture and is nice and moist, not too dry. The crab IMO is over hyped. It's just OK, not that special. Everyone around us had a crab to themselves. My parents and I got two crabs, and garlic noodles with jumbo shrimps. We got the original flavor crab and the tamarind one. I didn't enjoy the tamarind one too much, the alcohol flavor was a bit overpowering.

Initially I enjoyed it but after finihing half of it, I had the urge to regurgitate..too much butter and too much MSG...I was eating crab topped with butter, MSG and pepper...the crab itself..tasted just like steamed crab if you don't have buttery sauce..\n\nAnyhow my husband ordered the tamarind crab--which by the way didn't taste or smell like tamarind...but instead there were ginger bits in the sauce.\n\nThe restaurant claims to have secret Vietnamese ingredients but Vietnamese food usually do not contain butter.\n\nThe price was overly expensive and I think I may have been ripped off...the crab was just nearly 2lbs and costs $40 a piece.\n\nThey did not even give refills for soft drinks...$2.50 for a small soft drink...In addition, you would think for such an expensive meal you would get complimentary bread or dessert or maybe free refills on sodas, but you don't... \n\nTheir service was good with nice and polite staffs but the food was not worth the price. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless\nyou got lots of money falling from trees to spend.\n\nOh and did I forget to mention, for a pricey meal, there was no scenery at all...We sat upstairs in a room filled with people and with only 1-2 side windows...You would think that paying such a high priced meal you would get at least a better scenery.\n\nOur total bill was $110 and some change, tips included.", "author": "Tina T."}

And then there's my laziness for not wanting to buy the crab at 99 Ranch, bring it home, cook it myself, and make a giant mess of my dining room table with newspaper, crab shells, and melted butter, which I'm sure is also to blame for sustaining the exorbitant price point. \n\nRegardless, worth the splurge, and I got 2 huge meals out of 1 crab. \n\nNot to mention the bomb-ass garlic noodles and awesome giggling girl-time I got to spend with the fabulous ZT and JM. \n\n------------- \nMarket Price = Approximately $40/Crab as of this review. \n\nGet there early if you don't have reservations - we arrived 10-15 minutes before they opened, and there was a crowd milling about on the sidewalk waiting for the ceremonious door-unlocking to take place.

She absolutely was raving about the crab and garlic noodle here and suggested we make reservations for dinner at least one of the nights we were in SF. I must give her props because it was really good. \n\nA group of six of us came here and was seated at the back in a booth. The restaurant is pretty old and looks a little beat up. Decor was nothing fancy. But the food definitely made up for this flaw.\n\nWhat we ordered:  \n4 roasted crab: They were pretty large crabs and tasted very succulent. It was garlic-ky and buttery in taste. Your arteries were saying no..... but your tummy was definitely saying yes, give me more.  \n\n3 Garlic noodles, one of them had the large prawns added: The best garlic noodles I have had by far. This is their specialty dish and what this restaurant is known for. It was so delicous, my mouth is salvating just thinking about it. I highly recommend this dish. The prawns are pretty large and succulent also. If I remembered correctly, it cost $25 more to add the prawns but I thought it was worth the extra cost.\n\nShaking beef: I thought this dish was alright. I definitely had better elsewhere. The beef was not too tender and the flavoring wasn't great. It was just an average dish. \n\nFor dessert we ordered 4 orange sorbet that came inside a real orange. It was actually really good. Tasted tart and sweet at the same time. \n\nOverall it was a wonderful experience and the food was great. I would highly recommend making reservations. The night that we came, it was really busy and every table there was pretty much taken. We paid around $60 a person. A little on the pricier side but well worth it.", "author": "anna n."}

A crab specialty restaurant in the outer...OUTER sunset next to the cold, foggy beach.  A bit of a trek with many other similar places more east on Clement St.  You walk in and you will be greeted by the host (reservations are encouraged as it is a BUSY place even during the week) with a bar on the right.  It is fully stocked and we all got a glass of Oban for a pricey number.\n\nWhen seated about 10 minutes after our reservation was actually for we had a great server.  Surrounded by an interesting decor we ordered as appetizers calamari and oysters.  I didn't have the oysters but the calamari was well cooked but over seasoned if you ask me.  It was peppery which I do like but way too salty.   Because I love calamari, I ate much of the order but was invited to enjoy a long period of salty tongue and 2 glasses of ice water.  For the mains, we had crab which is the specialty, \"shaken\" beef, garlic noodles and seabass.   Crab was well cooked and tender.  The shaken beef was cooked medium to the \"T.\"  The seabass also tasty with the sauce it comes with but perhaps just a touch overcooked.  Finally, the garlic noodles were also very tasty if you LOVE garlic.  If garlic is only a passing notion in your home cooking you will think this is romantic disaster when it comes to post-dinner make-out sessions.\n\nLastly, because the portions are on the smaller side we had to order an extra dish for the 4 of us...the curry lotus prawns.  This had to be the worst of all our selections.  The shrimp were over cooked and tiny....oh whoops, weren't they called \"prawns\" on the menu???  In any case, the curry was bland and even if you liked it, there was barely enough curry sauce to mix into you rice like many expect in a Thai type curry house.  The veggies it comes with were....eh.  Water chestnuts were ok.  The baby corn tasted like canned baby corn.  All-in-all I'd leave this off your choices to order...\n\nSo in summary, a fancy, pricey Vietnamese crab house at the beach in SF.  A fun place to visit if you live locally and enjoy it.  Not something I'd cross town for though.  Plenty of better dining experiences / tastes closer to downtown.", "author": "Cary L."}

I was all worried about what I was doing with my life and sad about a friend moving away, and I had spent three hours cleaning the bathroom after my toilet had overflowed. Then I went to Thanh Long for dinner with a bunch of friends. The roast crab dish... there are no words. It was one of those rare moments in life where you just realize that every decision you've ever made leading up to this very instant has been correct.\n\nNo joke - it was so good that I noticed some meat left in one of the knuckles in the shell bowl and ended up literally picking through the trash for more meat. My friend is terrible at eating crab, so I basically had a handsome second dinner composed entirely of her scraps.\n\nWe got the roast crab, the tamarind crab, and garlic noodles, all of which were amazing. The vegetable of the day was sauteed green beans, also great, and the salt&pepper calamari, which was just okay. Oh, and lychee vodka! The only drawback is that the crab was about $42 each... otherwise I would have gladly eaten another two. Or four. Or ten. Seriously, the crab is really freaking good.\n\nWe went Sunday evening, and I had no problem street parking.

Of course we ordered roasted dungeness crab (one is enough for two people), garlic noodles and shaken beef. Needless to say, our table was loaded to the gills!!! I'm not much of a fan for eating things with my hands, like crab, but their roasted crab is delicious! I think they steam it first and break it apart, then bast it with their \"secret\" sauces and spices and roast it. It comes to you very hot! They give you bibs too for those of us who are messy eaters, like me, so you won't have to worry about looking silly when you leave and go into town or something... Or, maybe you could bring an extra shirt... hehe... As for the garlic noodles, well, I'm not really a fan. I just am not a garlic person, let alone having it cooked with noodles. Everyone else enjoyed it though. As for the shaken beef, it was cubes of ribeye or tenderloin saut\u00e9ed with onions and potatoes. It was very good, very tender.

Well, I can't say too much though because my first taste of the An Family Food was at their sister restaurant Crustaceans in SF 3/4 years ago for my birthday. So it was great to finally come to the place where it sort of originally started. Thanks to my friend Edmund, as we came here to celebrate his birthday!\n\nNote: I did not eat the crab because I was broke as a joke and market price for the crab was around 40 dollars. So I kept it light. I decided to just order the famous garlic noodles and I had also ordered the Broiled chicken which sounded delicious. However, the waitress has messed up my order and got me the Lemongrass Chicken dish. It sucked because I really wanted to try the Broiled chicken, I am not a huge fan of Lemongrass. Me, being a nice guy decided to just keep the dish because I didn't want to have the dish get thrown out and go through the trouble of making me a new one.\n\nAs for the garlic noodles, its not as good as what I remember having at crustaceans. Honestly, I felt like I could make my own garlic noodle at home that taste similar. Hmm, yea I was not too impressed. As for the Lemongrass Chicken, that was also alright. Again, I am not a fan of Lemongrass but I didn't want to have the waitress redo my order.\n\nOverall, I give Thanh Long's 3 stars. For what I had, I did not think it was worth the 35 dollars. Again though, I didn't have the famous crab, so I guess you could say my review isn't doing much justice to Thanh Long.

When we arrived, parking was hard to find, even for a Tuesday evening! Luckily we got to the restaurant early (around 6 pm) b/c by 7 pm, the place was packed with lots of customers at the door waiting to be seated.  \n\nThe ambiance of this place was really nice and dimly lit, the perfect place for a date if you're ok with getting down and dirty with some crabs.  The service here was just as good as the food - very attentive, fast and professional. \n\nFor the four of us, (in-laws, hubby and I) we ordered one Roasted Garlic Crab, one Drunken Crab, two orders of the Garlic Noodles and one shaken beef. For dessert, we had their deep fried pineapple a la mode - mmm, delicious. The shaken beef was also very flavorful and tender served over pieces of lettuce covered with some dressing.  \n\nFor Garlic Lovers, this is the place to go.  Everything was incredibly flavorful.  Although this place is known for their Roasted Garlic Crab, I personally favored the Drunken crab for it's more natural flavor cooked with the perfect complimenting wine. I would love to know how they are able to infuse the flavors so well into the crab meat.  \n\nWarning: the Garlic flavor lingers in the mouth (and breath) hours after you're done eating. Also, it's kind of a splurge to eat here b/c of the cost (we paid $38 per crab - seasonal price) It is more expensive to go during the non crab season.  \n\nFinal Verdict: This is a MUST TRY place if you love good flavorful crab and garlic.

The sauce was not salty and a perfect balance of black pepper and fish sauce.  The meat and the shrimp came out very tender.\n\nThe Buddha Roll was average.  The roll was poorly rolled and fell apart the moment we touched it.\n\nThe Roasted Crab came out too quickly.  We barely wiped our lips from the appetizers (10 minutes max), then out came the crabs.  Okay-- my first reaction was wow, they really want to turn their tables around.  Then my second reaction was these crabs were pre-roasted.  Then I wanted to hurt someone.  We did not drive all the way to the outer sunset for frozen crab!!!!  On top of all that, our \"smart\" waiter gave us the crab, without our garlic noodles.

Usually, these noodles do no retain heat, so I do not expect it too be hot, however cold is unacceptable.  \n\nIf Thanh Long is dishing out fast-food version of their food and service, they should dish out those same prices, so expectations will be lowered.

Disappointed by PPQ, I got really curious how Thanh Long measured up to PPQ. According to Yelp, they are equals at 4 stars, but PPQ had well over 100 more reviews. I had been to Thanh Long as well as its sister restaurant Crustacean a long time ago, but couldn't remember how they were.\n\nA couple of weeks after PPQ, we went to Thanh Long. We had mango salad for appetizer, and of course the roasted crab and garlic noodle for comparison purposes. Presentation-wise, Thanh Long's roasted crab was more appetizing than PPQ's, which came drowning in watery butter and garlic. Taste-wise, Thanh Long's was more flavorful, though a tad too salty and dry for my taste. Thanh Long's garlic noodle beat PPQ's hands down. Not too buttery, not too garlicky, and portion was generous. \n\nNow that I've determined the winner, I must say that this roasted style of crab is not really my cup of tea. I'd much prefer the salt and pepper crab of R&G Lounge. But that doesn't mean that Thanh Long doesn't deserve its 4 stars. It definitely deserves it much more than PPQ.", "author": "Aldo H."}

Ok, so after reading on yelp how good the food and service here, I decided to drive to SF to give it a shot. At the end of the night, I left this restaurant extremely disapointed.\n\nThe atmosphere, service was great (+1 star) but I don't go to restaurants for service or ambience, it for food! \"note the screen name\"\n\nSTARTERS:\n\nWe ordered garlic noodle, calamari, and mussle for starter. None of these starters tasted good. The garlic noodle was drowned in garlic salt while the noodle was very soggy. It was by far the worst garlic noodle I ever tasted, we all took one bite and the rest was going to the garbage. The calamari was also very salty and over peppered. The mussle was the best of the night, but it was mussle with butter, garlic salt, oregano and garlic bread nothing special.\n\nENTREES:\n\nWe had roasted crab and shaking beef. The crab had garlic salt, pepper, butter which made the crab meat extremely salty even after eating it with sauce. Us three can't finish a crab.\n\nThe shaking beef was sweet, undercook (for it softness), and that about it. Nothing special at all.\n\nDESERT:\n\nWe tried the fried banana with ice cream. Add whipped cream and you have the dish! No \"Wow\" factor at all.\n\nOverall, I won't come back to Thanh Long unless someone is paying and it have to be a pretty damn good occasion. I will give it a +1 star for the service, but sadly the food was horrible -4 stars.", "author": "Lovefood H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-22", "description": "Just went there on Saturday night on the recommendation of a friend.  We had 9 in our group, but with our reservation, there was no waiting.  They had valet parking for $10, which is a real saving grace.  Of course, I managed to find street parking down the block.  The place really doesn't look like much on the outside.  I honestly thought it was just some hole in the wall.  But when we got in, we saw all the excited and probably very hungry diners.  For decor and cleanliness, I'd rate it 3 stars.\n\nWe all ordered the roasted crab.  Several had to have a whole crab each, but I split mine as I wanted to try other dishes.  I also ordered the red snapper \"Thang Long Fish\" dish and an extra plate of garlic noodles.  The crab was really good.  They obviously manage their crab selection very carefully.  All the crabs were fat 2.5lb and very juicy, a sign that they bought the freshest and the best available.  Since I've had great crabs for most of my life, I can say that the crab was solidly above average.  Their garlic butter sauce that generously covers the crab is the defining difference.  It's not something you'd want to eat more than twice a month, but it sure feels good. \n\nThe only downside is the price.  $37 for one crab (current market price) and no sides is pretty steep.  I've done my own roasting in the oven many times and it's just as good.  I guess I can try soaking it with sauteed garlic in butter too.  Since crabs are in season now, I can probably replicate the crab for $7-9.  \n\nAs for the garlic noodles, I suppose the experience of having hot butter-covered noodles for the first time is close to orgasmic.  But, I've had and made my share of them, so their garlic noodles were rather underwhelming.  The noodles themselves weren't fresh or tasty.  There wasn't enough fresh garlic mixed in to deliver them from mediocrity.  For $10 a plate of unadorned noodles, I'd expected to be freshly made and tossed.  \n\nThe \"Thang Long Fish\" was equally bland and underwhelming.  For $20, I got two unseasoned and deep fried fillets and a side of garlic noodles.  Based on the menu, I thought I would be experiencing some of their unique seasonings and culinary expertise with fish.  Unfortunately, the fish was no more exciting than what I could get at Red Lobster.  About the best I can say is at least the fish wasn't dry.\n\nSo, if you must come, stick with the crab and just the crab.  If you want to try the garlic noodles, just sneak a bite from somebody in your party.  I can't comment on any of their other dishes.  However, we did try several dessert items, including fried ice cream.  None of them were very good.  The fried ice cream came with a thick graceless coat of fried dough.  The orange sorbet came in a kitschy hollowed-out orange peel.  It was frozen solid so getting even tiny spoonfuls was a predicament.\n\nFor their good crabs, I'd give them 5 stars, but with all the other short-comings, I can only manage to muster up 4 stars.", "author": "Michael C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-24", "description": "This place is delicious, but I give it 4 stars since I think PPQ Dungeness Island is better. \n\nI've been here 5+ times in the last 3 years... first couple times were delicious! I'd never had butter garlic crab elsewhere and the flavor was just too good! I'm guessing they steam the crab with salt, pepper, and garlic infused butter (as there's always glops of salt on top making some bites super salty). The sauce the crab comes in is just butter infused with garlic (I have yet to see garlic chunks anywhere...) which is good for dipping, but I think the crab itself has enough flavor. The garlic noodles are interesting to say the least -- every time I get them they are cold, so I don't know if they are supposed to be that way. The noodles are slightly sweet and no as garlicy as the crab... it just seems out of place to me as I am eating fresh hot crab with cold noodles. I've also had their garlic rice (obviously not as novel), which I like better than the noodles, probably just because it's warm and hence doesn't have a temperature difference with the star of the show. \n\nTheir vegetables are delicious! I didn't think I'd be ordering veggies at a seafood restaurant, but their string beans are cooked and seasoned perfectly with seasonable vegetables and a variety of mushrooms (yum!).\n\nThe most recent time I came the crab was not fresh - we were charged $40/crab (yes I know it's seasonal) and the flesh was not fresh. One person in our party even ended up with diarrhea the next day =/\n\nService is horrible... waitresses never come around. The place is ALWAYS crowded, and even when we had a reservation we had to wait 30 minutes (what is up with that?!) \n\nPPQ vs Thanh Long\nSo I find PPQ better and more price worthy. At PPQ you can get a full 4 course meal (appetizer, crab, noodles, dessert) for about $60. The crab and garlic noodles themselves are equally priced between the two, but PPQ offers a set menu which makes it more reasonable. The crab is different as it doesn't have much flavor itself, but the garlic butter sauce is WAY BETTER! There's garlic chunks in the sauce, making it all the more rich and savory. However, the garlic noodles are not as good. But hey, you're here for the crab!", "author": "Debbie L."}

For dinner we ordered roasted crab and garlic noodles. I was in pure heaven after eating my meal. Once our server helped us put on our bibs so we didn't get too dirty from digging into those juicy crabs we knew we were in for an adventurous ride. The crab was steaming hot, juicy, garlic, buttery, and finger licking good. If you weren't paying attention you would have thought I was talking about chicken but alas you are definitely mistaken. The garlic noodles were cooked to its absolute perfection...buttery, garlicky.  And the noodles weren't all mushy like when you overcook noodles and it just sticks everywhere and to anything. These noodles had the right amount of garlic and butter to compliment the dripping wet and juicy crab we were munching on.  Are you turned on yet? Haha. \n\nNow if that wasn't enough for you loosen your belt buckle a couple notches...well we ordered the fried banana with ice cream. This dessert was simply a perfect ending. The batter was light and crisp. The banana was hot and sweet. The ice cream was a great addition but maybe some chocolate for dipping would have been good too. I do love my chocolate after all. \n\nI could have literally died and gone to heaven after all that I had eaten. The dessert just topped off everything and I believe I had reached nirvana eating my meal...if that was even at all possible. \n\nI would definitely come back. I hope they have modified their set up though so we don't feel like a bunch of sardines waiting for someone to open the can so we could all jump out to freedom. \n\nThe wait staff was nice. Reservations are recommended. Cocktails are so so. Parking is okay. Food is divine. Great atmosphere and great people. \n\nI want to go back already. I'm craving garlic noodles.

I've been here a few times with friends and the food has always been consistent.  However, I guess I'm pretty biased because I fell in love with Crustaceans FIRST, (although they're sister-restaurants).  My only gripe about this place is that each time I've been here with friends, we've always been seated upstairs, which is fine because it was always during the busy dinner time, but I wasn't too comfortable sitting so close to other parties on the second floor. The tables were too close together...So close, that I had to squeeze between tables, rubbed elbows/arms with complete strangers sitting at the table next to us, just to get to the restrooms.  But I'm hoping this only happens during their busy rush.  Now, I'm going to be nice and just say that the restrooms were below my standards as far as cleanliness, but again, that's in comparison to Crustaceans' restroom.  Regardless, I would love to see improvements in their restrooms. Other than that, the food (my usual - \"roasted crab with garlic noodles\") has always been consistently good!", "author": "Anne H."}

Yum. \n\nBeing that I am reviewer #626, you might guess that we were served some pretty amazing food. We shared a Soft Shell Crab starter, which was very fresh and juicy- not quite as fantastic as the same starter at House, but still very good. The boy ordered a whole crab with garlic noodles and I had the Colossal Royal Tiger Prawns served on a bed of.. you guessed it- more garlic noodles. We thoroughly enjoyed our carb/ butter/ protein filled meal. I never thought I'd find myself eyeing some lettuce garnish carelessly left on a plate from the table next to us..\n\nThe crab was bathed in steaming butter- what looked like perfection, if I were a fan of crab meat, which I am not. I am also not a fan of lobster. And I don't drink. I am the ultimate cheap date, but despair not; what I refuse in seafood and wine, I more than make up in desserts and starters!! \n\nI am, however, a SUPERfan of shrimp. Especially tiger prawns. Yummy yum yum. As for my order, I'd have to say that the 'Colossal' in the menu name might be a little misleading- they are Jumbo prawns at best. The prawns are splayed open when served, but if you put them back together (like I did) just to gauge their actual size: I'd say they were Jumbo, not Colossal. Size aside, the meat was tender and moist. So, so good.\n\nSide comment on valet parking:\nNot sure where exactly they took the car once we handed over the keys, but we ended up waiting like fifteen minutes with no line when we were leaving. Seriously- we made a quick trip across the street to the liquor store because they were taking so damn long. Really makes me question where they take the cars. Back home to the An Family garage, perhaps? I'm sure they can fit a few dozen cars on their property with all the money Crustaceans rakes in.", "author": "Elaine T."}

We had a reservation for 8:30, but they still had us wait 15 minutes for a table.\n\nWe ordered the garlic crab and the garlic noodles.  I've never had garlic noodles before, but I was pleasantly suprised at how good it tasted. They are very buttery and greasy though, so I'm not sure how healthy it is. The crab was finger licking good. I don't think that I've had better crab anywhere else.\n\nThe food came after about 5 minutes. So when it gets busy I'm pretty sure the crabs aren't made to order, but prepared in advance.\n\nThe table they sat us at was really small and very close to the surrounding patrons tables. It felt very awkward to be sitting so close to other couples. If you are wanting to have a private conversation with your significant other, you might want to choose somewhere else.\n\nThis is not really the best place for a quiet romantic night out. The noise level was high, mainly because of the fellow patrons. I found myself having to raise my voice quite a lot to converse with my wife.\n\nThis is a great place to bring a group of friends who don't mind getting their hands dirty.\n\nThe mood lighting was medium. Nothing special.\n\nThe restrooms are something to note. The mens restroom was just a toilet and a stall combo. They seemed to keep it clean, but  only one person could be in there at a time.\n\nThe servers were excellent.

I was addicted to the garlic noodles then.  I'd long heard about this legendary restaurant and just never made it out to 46th avenue until last evening. Thanh Long has a long and venerable history in San Francisco.   It almost pains me to write this review because I came away with my socks still firmly attached to my feet.  I was not blown away as others have been.  I was very sad about it, too.  I wanted to have my socks blown off.\n\nThe meal began with salt & pepper calamari and it was tasty.  The best thing we ate all evening.  The vietnamese salad was generous but lacked flavor.  It was essentially super fine shredded cabbage.  The prawns on top were boiled, tender and split.  \n\nI ordered the Tiger Prawns over garlic noodles.  The garlic noodles were a known aspect, so I knew what to expect, they were as garlicky as I remembered.  The 4 prawns were butterflied and grilled and were tasty.  For a market price item I thought the prawns were very spendy, just a few bucks under the price of a crab.  Ouch!  \n\nOne of my dinner companions ordered drunken crab and declared it yummy but not mind blowing.  We all tasted and commented, however, the crab was not fresh but frozen.  So that was a bit of a let down.  Yes, Dungeness are out of season locally but can be had fresh farther up the coast.  If I come back to try to famous roasted crab, I'll come back when it's in season.  \n\nMy overall thoughts are this was tasty, but, a plate of garlic noodles and 4 prawns and salad set me back $60 and I came away unsatisfied.  I wanted to be blown away, I'd heard the stories and I just was not super impressed.  \n\nThe service was fine, attentive and not overwhelming.  Water was refilled and bowls were replaced quickly.  The hot towels were great and a must.\n\nThe place was also incredibly noisy.  Obviously a celebration destination, be prepared to have trouble holding a conversation.

I'm here in SF on a business trip and my boss (SF native) strongly suggested I have the roasted crab and garlic noodles, so I didn't argue. Apps included calamari, mussels and salmon carpaccio. Awesome calamari - hot, crispy and a hint of heat in the seasoning. The mussels were a bit tough but seasoned well and served with piping hot, crispy crostini. The carpaccio was amazing - perfectly sliced with capers and a hint of lemon.\n\nBut let's talk about this freaking amazing roasted crab. \n\nThey tell me it's locally caught Dungeness. Holy cow. This East Coast chick obviously doesn't know how good Dungeness can be. After the obligatory plastic bib was tied on, they brought me the crab. HUGE. FRESH. Smothered in a pepper garlic seasoning that made me lick my fingers, in public, numerous times. I laid waste to this beautiful creature in about 30 minutes. The staff was awesome - exchanged my shell bowl numerous times and did not comment on all of the bits of shell that were flying off my plate. Seriously, that's how good it was. \n\nI guess I should say something about the garlic noodles. The al dente, gnocchi like flavor was delicious, and if I haven't formed such a meaningful relationship with the crab, I probably could say more.\nI finished up with an orange cream sorbet served in an orange shell. Hints of  rose? lavender? I'm not sure, I was still garlicking over the crab. \nAlso finished with a green oolong since they were out of the rose tea. Only \"boo\" I have to this dining experience.\n\nThank you Thanh Long and the An family. This is one of the best meals I've ever had.", "author": "Trish K."}

We came here on the advice of an Inner Sunset resident who generally is spot on regarding restaurant recs.  Cutting to the chase, the roasted crab was a grossly overpriced simpleminded roasted/baked whole crab drowned in butter.  This is supposed to be something special?  REALLY?????  And then the garlic noodles---greasy, gooey, and overgarlicky, not to mention salty to the extreme.  Worst crab dish ever.  Just barely above the stuff sold as walkaway crab salads on Fisherman's Wharf.  Yes.  THAT BAD. And way more expensive.    Never coming back, no matter what.

I have no clue how people eat a whole plate of this stuff, let alone with their greasy seafood on top. Yuck. Not to mention, should this really cost 10$? Not worth it, at all. \n\n1 Colossal Tiger Prawns $34.95. The shrimp were splayed in half to make them look larger than they actually were and served on top of a giant bed of greasy garlic spaghetti. The shrimp themselves, were also covered in greasy butter stuff. They tasted OK, but also were very oily. \n\n1 Vegetarian Delight $14.95. This was possibly the last mistake we made: ordering vegetables at this grease-hole. This was inedible. They came covered in a sauce which reminded both of us of Chief Boyardee tomato sauce. Gross. We did not eat any of it, and they did not even ask if any thing was wrong with the food. This place sucks. \n\nWe will NOT be returning, and would never recommend this to anyone.

No one speaks Vietnamese here and menus are all in English (my poor parents had to translate from the English their own native dishes, not that there were many).   \n\nI don't get what the hype is all about. Paying $35+ for a crab drenched in garlic butter/oil? Garlic noodles = noodles (more like spaghetti) and garlic butter. Unless they're using organic noodles and imported butter, they're making a huge profit on this. I'm not saying the food is bad, which is why it gets 3 stars. But there's no way I'm paying that much for such simple dishes. \n\nSave your money. Buy a live $10 crab from your local Asian market, marinate with minced garlic and butter and roast it yourself in the oven. Their secret ingredients are probably a mix of common Asian spices. \n\nIf you're used to eating real Asian crab dishes (i.e. Chinese ginger & scallion, Singapore black pepper) with stronger spices, you will not be impressed.

I was a little disappointed because I had high expectations, but it was nothing that made it too much of an upset. It was just average to me.\n\nAs soon as we finished dinner we skipped dessert and left. Since parking around this area is terrible, we conveniently had our cars valet parked. Bad idea. The wait to get our car was inconveniently long, especially because it was freezing outside. It seemed like the people working the valet parking were driving each other to and from Thanh Long to a parking garage a few blocks away and retrieving peoples' cars for them.

The garlic noodles were also quite incredible, now I am very biased on this because anything with enough garlic to kill a small animal gets a few extra points in my book, but this was never overpowering, and was a perfect accompaniment to the crab. \n\nNow the part that has left biggest memory for me is the fried ice cream, one because it was absolutely amazing how you could tempura batter and fry ice cream and still manage to serve it before it has melted, and two because my family has since taken to replicating this particular recipe.

This is my Cheers, and I am Norm -- because hostesses Jennifer and Lhanh always know my name when I call.\n\nThe main event here is the Roast Crab, the best thing on the menu and the best crab in San Francisco.  Dripping with butter and seasoned to perfection, it is absolutely magical.  Order it with the garlic noodles.  My favorite appetizer is the mussels -- be sure to drip any remaining sauce onto the crisp rounds of bread.  The crab puffs are always a hit as well.  Order the Navarro Gewurztraminer -- it's light and crisp with a touch of sweetness and is absolutely perfect with the rich, buttery crab.\n\nThis is not a first date restaurant or a restaurant for high maintenance customers.  After all, you're going to wear a plastic bib, get messy, and want to lick your fingers.  (Hmm... maybe it is a good place for a first date.)  But for the true crab lover, or for anyone who just wants the ultimate in San Francisco food, this is the place.\n\nCrustacean and Thanh Long have almost exactly the same menu.

Living mere blocks away (and the fact that it is the Sunset, where parking is generally abundant), it's their whole roasted Dungeness crabs and garlic noodles that get me motivated!

I've seen friendships fall apart over less.\n\nThe cocktails and appetizers are somewhat lackluster but don't let this deter you.

From the restaurant's humble beginnings to a much larger empire and perhaps a mini conglomerate, their story certainly represents the budding entrepreneur's desire and passion to map and live out the American Dream.\n\nI had fond memories coming here during the early 90s, when this place was IT. Way before Yelp, Chowhound, and arguably Slanted Door, this was definitely an SF favorite and one of the greatest Vietnamese/fusion restaurants.\n\nBack then the neighborhood where Thanh Long is located wasn't a place overun by thugs and crime like it is these days, although the pain in the ass parking problems were somewhat there and I'm sure has not improved today.\n\nThis restaurant was at the time much smaller and less decorative than it is now, which gave this place a bit of a mom and pop feel, in addition to being a restaurant in a primarily residential area. Most kids who dined here at the time with their parents would rush over across the street to the 7-Eleven and play some coin-op games while their parents stood around like hapless sheep, waiting for their names to be called. So thanks mom & dad, for sticking around while me and my brother were wasting away our life in front of a coin-op machine for upwards of 30 mins each!\n\nWhile there were a variety of items to consume and choose from here, practically everyone ordered the signature items, which is the buttery garlic pepper roasted dungeoness crab, perhaps the garlic tiger prawns, the signature garlic noodles of course, and perhaps end with a banana flambe / fried banana with ice cream. There was never a need to mess around and try something else.\n\nAs seemingly romantic this place may seem to bring a date to impress, the idea of wearing bibs and getting your hands greased up with more grease juice flying across the table as you break open an arm or a leg (of the crab of course, not some thug ass off the street, try holding a lead pipe, Glock or Sig Sauer after your hands are all buttered up), and getting said butter garlic pepper grease all over your chin like a Dirty Gomez, is not slick (no pun intended) or smart by any means.\n\nI have to say that ever since SF's Crustacean opened, I've been witnessing a steady decline in overall quality and dining experience here as the decor and ambience upgraded (they have since added a much larger alcohol bar too for your frou frou drunken needs), both of which have been rather inconsistent. Although I have not been back in some years, the last visit circa 2001/2002 here just did not hit the spot.

Then again, at 36 years old and counting, and with a backstory worthy of legend (see their website), it's something of a landmark itself.  The place filled up fast even on a Tuesday, with a very eclectic crowd that, not surprisingly, included a lot of birthdays (hey, you can't afford to eat this stuff every day).  Major props on those green walls with the painted trees--I shall certainly nick that idea for my house...if I ever own one.\n\nOf course the crab & garlic noodles is obligatory here.  Don't bother with the appetizers or wine; they're uninspiring and you'll need to put that money towards the \"Market Price\" anyway ($35.95 in my case).  I was half-convinced the crab couldn't possibly live up to the hype, but it truly was an experience (the crab was huge too, plenty for the wife and I to split, especially with the noodles).  The tamarind sauce, while delicious, made things very slippery-sticky, and I thought my hands would never be clean again--until they brought out those blessed hot towels.

Thanh long is a delicious treat and every time I go (to both Thanh long and it's sister restaurant Crustacean on Polk), I look forward to meeting and devouring my delicious little crab. \n\nThanh long is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I prefer it to Crustacean because it's less formal, which lends itself to a more cozy atmosphere. Since it's a popular spot and a smaller space, you'll need reservations before you go but it's well worth it. Thanh long's specialty is their garlic roast crab, which is simply seasoned but DELICIOUS giving you a perfectly indulgent savory experience. The crab is always fresh and you have everything you need to get down to business: crab crackers, a miniature fork, bib and hot towel to clean up your filth when you're done. While the crab is the star of the show, the garlic noodles are definitely a scene stealer. Appetizers and dessert are also great. I'm a fan of the buddha rolls and deep fried banana with ice cream.

Even better than at Crustacean... maybe it is the more \"authentic\" atmosphere. Appetizers are ok, but nothing to write home about and really not needed if everyone has their own crab - more than enough food. One order of garlic noodles per 2 people is sufficient. The Vietnamese salad is great though, and the dressing is nice and light.\n\nThanh Long is a unique experience. Others may think it is overpriced, but the flavors are just magnificent.

Hills and SF Crustaceans... the only memorable thing was the aquarium walk way from the entrance into the dining hall in the BH location) I heard both Crustacean and Thanh Long went downhill but decided to give it a few tries before reaching any sort of conclusions. \n\nTwo of my recent Thanh Long visits were average / below average but  during the most recent dinner:\n\n1. The bartender (some dude with braided long hair) was rude, dismissive, and a jerk!! I've NEVER been treated this way at a bar. EVER. And I've lived in NYC, one of the most pretentious and snobby cities in the world as well as Tokyo, where a lot of the places are 10 times busier =(\n\n2. The appetizer was below average. 10 dollars for seafood dumplings with mushy, sticky, thick skin and icky dipping sauce = DO NOT WANT! I've had frozen shu mai that tasted better. No joke.\n\n2.The server spilled our beers on us and instead of immediately bringing napkins and or hot towels for our clothes, he disappeared towards the bar to clean himself up. We sat there covered in beer for a while before the hostess finally brought us extra linens =/ When he came back with extra napkins (5 min. too late) he didn't even apologize for spilling and said \"I have slippery fingers haha\" Um hello? This IS a fine dining establishment, correct? Am I mistaken to expect WAY more professional service?\n\n3. The crabs were fresh and meaty but WAY too salty\n\n4. The garlic noodles were not al dente and WAY salty  =(\n\nI was with a first time Thanh Long-er who seemed to enjoy his food but I was NOT happy. I almost complained but didn't want to ruin my date's dinner.\n\nI will never dine here again. Frankly, I'd rather go to a Chinese supermarket, pick up fresh crab, and season it myself.\n\nnote: I gave it two stars because zero is not possible. The 2nd star is for sentimental reasons. I frequented Thanh Long before it blew up and have quite fond memories of that place.

( Thanks Luan!!) \n\nNot only was I embarrassed that he beat  me to it..... but that I had not even heard of this place and its in MY hood!!! I even said out loud, \"oh this must be new\" so sure of myself that I haven't been out of the loop. I was waaaay presumptuous. A lady who stood by me rolled her eyes and smirked thinking, \" oh you don't know about crab.\"\n\nAnd she's right, I don't. Well, I shouldn't say that. As a child, every Thursday was seafood night at my house. And every Thursday we had fresh crab, crawfish, and mussels all in one seating. Needless to say, I passed my seafood enthrallment at the age of ten. \" Geez, loooooobster again!!!\",  I would say. \n\nSo as an adult, I don't skip and click my heels at the thought of going to a seafood restaurant (I get more excited eating spam because to me ,its more exotic).\n\nBut the Crab from Thanh Long had won me over. A Week after my first visit I was CRAVING. I ordered Crab with extra pepper and garlic noodles....... For take out..........

My husband and I ventured out on a Saturday night for our long-awaited visit to Thanh Long. What a waste of time! Let's start with the service - I've never felt so rushed in my life. My husband was still eating the appetizer when the waiter practically took the plate and fork right out of his hand! Then our crab and garlic noodles arrived on the scene and it went downhill from there. The \"secret\" spices on both? Come on - garlic salt on the noodles? That's no secret and the crab had so much pepper on the outside I felt like a crab at the end. The crab itself was over-cooked and under flavored. And, to top it off, the crab was $45!!! This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in this City. We will never be back.

But worth it for the crab.  More on that in a little bit.  Food was great, other things took points off.\n\nPros:  The crab.  The garlic noodles.  My favorite of the evening was actually the fried banana and ice cream.\n\nOur server was really good.  He came by enough to clear stuff away, but didn't hover and check on us overly much.  \n\nCons:  Parking is horrible.  We sucked it up and paid for the valet.  \n\nOur reservation got \"mysteriously\" pushed back by half an hour, so we ended up waiting half an hour for a table.  Their waiting area up front is pretty small, and it was extremely crowded.  \n\nWhen we were finally given a table, we were pretty packed in with all the other diners, and it definitely isn't a cozy, romantic restaurant.   Every time I said something to my boyfriend, I had to talk loudly so he could hear me.\n\nPerhaps I'm not used to all that grease which coated their famous roasted crab, but I ended up getting really sick after eating it.  But since boyfriend didn't, and it was the same crab, I'm not blaming the restaurant.\n\nBottom line: I'd come here again if I'm eating in a big group.

When looking for food near by we ran into Thanh Long and, on the recommendation of their garlic noodles, decided to have a bite to eat.  Service was fantastic.  We were seated quickly, even without a reservation.  Our waiter was spot on, didn't unnecessarily interrupt us, took our order promptly and returned with our app quickly.\n\nThe food was good but spectacularly overpriced. We ordered crab puffs as an app, with garlic noodles and shaken beef as mains.  Presentation of the beef was pretty weak.  As Tina D. notes they serve it with chopped head lettuce, not something worthy of the $23 charge.  Pretty lame.  I was also surprised that both mains were rich with garlic, not just the garlic noodles; I like garlic quite a bit but it felt like they were hiding their food with the amount they used.  Garlic is one of those ingredients that is easy to overuse because it tastes so good at first.  It's like eating cookies, the first couple bites taste great then after some point you start to have a stomach ache from eating too many.  Well after all that butter and garlic I ended up leaving with Thanh Long with a stomach ache.\n\nTotal dinner without drinks was $45. Ouch.  I was torn between giving Long 3 or 4 stars but ultimately they loose a star for food quality which was good but not sublime and they loose a star for not living up to my subjective quality / price metric.  That doesn't mean it's not a good restaurant, it is, with outstanding service and tasty food; just don't expect an enlightening meal.

It's also very loud and chaotic.  Feels more like a neighborhood eating joint with the cramped tables and noisy atmosphere.  \n\nThe service was kinda lacking.  I think the amount of patrons coming in and out ( and yes you do feel rushed) makes it hard for the servers to give you the same level of attentiveness you'd get at Crustanceans.  \n\nAs for the crab, somewhat disappointing.  It was still good but right off the bat I noticed mine was room temperature.  Unlike Crustaceans at Thanh Long the crab comes out of the kitchen in record time.   All night servers came out literally by the second, with the roast crab.  With as fast as they were bringing it out, it's easy to assume they were cooked before you ordered it. \n\nThe garlic noodles were great though, not overly greasy and great garlic flavor and portion.  I also liked their shrimp toast, as an appetizer but the calamari was forgettable.  \n\nThe main disappointment was in their dessert selection.  I was undecided and the waitress suggested I try the fried banana, which of course every other Asian restaurant offers.  At Thanh Long was probably the worst (and I've never had a fried banana I didn't like).  The banana- to-dough ratio was waaayyy off.  Too much dough.  I ate more of the ice cream because I could barely eat two bites of the fried banana.  \n\nNow that I've tried it there, I won't be going back.  Not a horrible experience but dims in comparison to Crustaceans.", "author": "Dorothy F."}

I was skeptical due to some of the Yelp reviews stating that service sucked, prices were high and so on.... but to my delightful surprise, we were completely taken care of and had a wonderful night. My husbands brother went before and said for 2 he spend $150... so we were prepared. We got there at 6, our friends were there early so they stopped in at the bar where Peter took excellent care of them offering them samples of his concoctions (which they loved). When my husband and I got there we just paid the $12 for valet and were done with it!! Still cheaper than a ticket or towing!! When we went in we were seated right away with our friends (we did have a reservation). They were prompt and courteous. We ordered a started dish of fried calamari... I don't eat calamari but I did this night!! it was AWESOME! cooked PERFECT!! Then our two orders of crab with garlic noodles and an order of shaken beef showed up.... we 4 split all the dishes and were STUFFED!! plus we all had 2 drinks each (beer and rum drinks) The bill was $200; about $150 less than we were prepared to pay for 4 people for a crab meal! Everyone was pleasant, fast and efficient ... will be back to work on the rest of the menu!!", "author": "Ange W."}

As everyone else has already said, the crab and garlic noodles are the best! When dungeness is out of season, it can be pricey (I think we've paid as much as $54 once - when we were desperate) but otherwise, on price (usually about $27 - $37), it's comparable to other places while beating the pants of other places in terms of flavor.\n\nI love the garlic roasted crab and hubs loves the drunken crab. I've made the garlic roasted for us at home but it never quite measures up. There must be a secret ingredient of some sort. Maybe the secret is those plastic bibs they give you. (BTW, is it my imagination or have those bibs gotten smaller?  Or is it just that my belly has gotten bigger??) Oh- and a tip for those who don't eat the crab but are dining with someone (or next to someone) who is: request a bib for yourself. Otherwise, beware flying crab juice, crab meat pieces, or droplets of garlic sauce. \n\nThe garlic noodles (also impossible to duplicate at home!) are delish and there's enough in one order to share between two - unless you're with a pregnant woman and then beware any who dare approach the plate until she's finished. I don't care if it's hubs or the waiter - hands off my noodles until I'm done!\n\nThe seabass is yummy too, but not nearly as fun or as filling as the crab. It was cooked perfectly and accompanied by vegetables that complimented the flavor just right.  The shaken beef is - to me - the best beef dish on the menu. Soooo tender and flavorful!  Seasonal veggies are good too, although sometimes they taste just like the beef. Must use the same sauce or at least the same spices.\n\nParking is definitely the only sucky part. But as others have recommended, go during off-peak hours and it should be easier to find a spot. Otherwise, at least there's valet. Small price to pay for an hour+ of crab-eatin' heaven.", "author": "Teri T."}

I went with a couple of friends for an early dinner at 5:00 pm on a Sunday evening.  We were about 15 min. early and so were about 10 other people waiting in front on the restaurant to open.  When the doors opened, we were all seated quickly.  My group's mission was to have just the Roasted Crabs and the Garlic Noodles and that was all that we wanted.  Our server was quick to get our orders in, we ordered one Crab each (yes, I can eat a whole Crab!).  We didn't have to wait too long before our server came back to place our Crab bibs on us and we know that the hot Roasted Crabs will soon-be-a-coming.  Our crabs came to us piping hot and not overly drenched in the buttery-garlicy sauce... oh looks soooo delish!  We dove right into our Crabs and there was nothing but the sound of cracking Crabs coming from our table for awhile.  Before we know it we had a mount of cracked Crab shells in front of us and we found ourselves licking our fingers clean from the buttery-garlicy sauce... oh sooo delish!\n\nOverall:  It's a little pricey for Asian cuisine, but worth it for \"Crabs Done Right\".  I can easily steam up some crabs at home, but why not indulge sometimes. The service was excellent and what I can see from the other tables, everyone was enjoying their meals with or without the Crabs!\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Miriam O."}

There was no disappointment here. I also had the beef tar tar (raw beef) which was good and my date had a leeche martini which was also had a unique taste which she enjoyed. \nReservations are recommended due to the large number of people eating here. The restaurant is more of a fine dining restaurant but I did not come dressed up. I did not feel out of place. \nThe best place to eat is upstairs near the windows due to the quiet ambiance. Downstairs gets really loud and noisy. I would only eat downstairs if I came with a group of friends. Price wise it was an expensive restaurant but worth the price.", "author": "Pete N."}

I made the bf finish it.  I don't think he liked it much...but hey, someone gotta eat it!\n\nGarlic Noodles were superb!

No offense but the Sunset District and fine dining are not interwined in my mind. Once you walk in, its a different experience. I especially love the murals of the ladies of vietnam with their respective ethnic clothing. I also loved the lighting --which is a stark contrast to the total darkness of their sister restaurant crustacean. We ordered the roasted crab and garlic noodles. Both delicious and our waitress was sweet and attentive. Bonus points bc she let us know that the garlic noodles should be eaten ASAP since the butter congeals as it gets cold. The crab is delish with the seasoning seeping into the actual crab meat. The garlic flavor is there but not overpowering and I love that you can still taste the natural saltiness of the crab. \n\nNext time, I will venture and order the sea bass which looked equally appealing.", "author": "Diep N."}

We were sat in the smaller table but I would of preferred to have been seated on the first floor, the overrall ambiance was nicer.\n\nHere is what we ordered/shared\n\nAppetizers\n\nSpring Roll- Just a regular Viet style spring roll, the portion was real tiny though, I'd opt on ordering this because it's $9.75. Save your money for dessert or more garlic noodles!\n\nCrab puffs- Light airy, wontons with crab filling inside, they were good but I'm not sure worth $10.75, the portions were tiny again.\n\nMain Courses:\nRoasted Crab with Garlic- So delicious, the market price that evening was $30.75\n\nTiger Prawns and Garlic Noodles: I also really enjoyed this dish, the prawns were butterflied beautifully and the garlic noodles were light and so robust in garlic flavor! YUMMMM! Market Price that evening: $30.75\n\nWe also ordered another side of garlic noodles, since there that good.\n\nService was great, adequate and to the point.\n\nA meal enough for 3 petite asian girls came out to be $109 that's including a glass of their pure grape juice.\n\nI'm a fan and now I need to learn how to make garlic noodles since a trip to Thanh Long is rather lengthy since i live in San Jose.\n\nP.S. you can wear a dorky plastic bib by your liking.", "author": "Wen C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-07", "description": "In another review, I mentioned this place as having better crab.  Then I realized that I didn't write a review on this place.\n\nI've been here twice. The first time was by accident.  A friend was visiting the City and wanted to go to some African restaurant that was supposed to be near this place, except that we couldn't find it.  We were driving around and saw this little seafood joint and figured to just give it a try.  Obviously we're not SF natives, because apparently EVERYONE else knows about this place.\n\nWe sit down and notice that everyone is having crab, so we figure it's the specialty. We order ourselves some crab, too. We got the original and the drunken crab. \n\nNow, I grew up in LA. Down there, we drive to Redondo Beach, where there are sidewalk restaurants that serve fresh crab. We take mallets and crack the crab, dip it in lemon juice from fresh squeezed lemons, and eat. \n\nBut here we are in a nice restaurant ordering crab, and the waiter asks if we want noodles. Now I'm confused. I've never eaten crabs with noodles before. So we ask, do people usually eat noodles with crab?  He says yea. So we order noodles just for kicks.\n\nThey put bibs on us, which is a nice touch. They also give us those funny little contraptions for cracking the shells.  Now I feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, when she's eating those oysters in the nice restaurant and one of the oysters flies out of the contraption.\n\nTo explain, I gotta take you back to my childhood, in Redondo Beach.  Like i explained, we got mallets to crack the shells. We don't use plates - they give us a sheet of wax paper instead.\n\nBack to SF, I'm looking at the crab and this funny contraption, and I figure, what the hell, nobody's watching me. I stick the crab in my mouth and crack it with my teeth.  I get right to the meat and have me a good meal.  Both types of crab are good, but I think I prefer the Drunken Crab.  I never did use that funny contraption.\n\nThe second time I went there I knew what to expect.  But I still don't use that funny contraption.", "author": "Robert L."}

I was hoping the noodles would be a little lighter but they were very sticky and thick.  They tasted good and had a field of garlic on them.  The crab was your typical dungeness crab and it was covered in butter, garlic and black pepper.  It was also good.\n\nThe problem I had was similar to what another poster mentioned.  It was SOOOOOO much garlic that I started to feel a bit nautious after a while.  I ended up taking a doggie bag and even in the car on the way home the smell was making me ill.

There were 4 of us, so me and gf shared a plate of garlic noodles and a roasted crab, and our friends had the other plate of garlic noodles and a drunken crab. \n\nfirst things first, fresh crab plus garlic plus other kinds of sauces = tasty crab even. I prefer our friends' drunken crab more since the sauce gives it more of a kick in the flavor IMO. When I return, I will try that .\n\nNow to the garlic noodles, I hope the following thing I mention will give you a good enough message - we ended up ordering a third plate to share.  Yup seriously, the way they prepared their food should be relatively simple, but the taste of these dishes totally overwhelmed me. The only complaint I will have on this plate, and others at this restaurant? If you can make the food look more colorful without sacrificing tastiness, Thanh Long, then I will come back and give you 5 stars. To me a plate with just crab and garlic or just noodles may not look so good in such an high-end, expensive Asian restaurant .....", "author": "David C."}

We were all big fans of the garlic noodles and roast crab, of course, and my friends really enjoyed the shaken beef too. The fish was bland by comparison to the rest, but was still decent and a great deal since we got more garlic noodles alongside the order.  One of my girlfriends was overwhelmed with the amount of butter in the noodles and crab, and had to lay off after a while... which meant more for us!  Yum :D\n\nI'd love to come back for another special occasion. It was a fairly loud atmosphere but also a nice, refined setting for older family members to join if need be.

When we walked by the restaurant it did look pretty run down and ghetto at first glance but whatever was cookin' smelled absolutely delicious =)\n\nUpon entering, I felt like I had been transported into another place. I guess it's true when they say \"don't judge a book by it's cover.\" The inside was clean, beautifully decorated, filled with lots of people, and had great ambiance. Their service was amazing...exceeded all expectations. We had about 4 different servers which made everything flow very nicely. Our orders were taken promptly and properly, plates cleared instantly, and our water glasses were always filled without us having to ask. They were all really nice and polite.\n\nWe ordered the Buddha Roll (vegetarian spring roll), Garlic Toast, Roast Crab, Garlic Noodles, and the Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant. The Buddha Roll had good flavors but one order of it is just one roll cut into 4 pieces and for $7.50 is so not worth it! The Garlic Toast was also a rip off. It was just half a baguette like the ones you get at Lucky's/Safeway, smothered with butter with hardly any garlic. You could easily make your own garlic bread at home that tastes a whole lot better for half the price. Their famous Roast Crab was alright. The crab was a decent size with a good amount of meat, but they could have gone a bit lighter on the seasoning. I don't know if we got a bad batch but the crab was a bit too salty. It definitely tasted better when paired with simple plain white rice. The Garlic Noodles were quite tasty and scrumptious, but the portion was small. The best dish by far was the Thanh Long Spicy Eggplant. The eggplant was cooked to perfection...the outside with just the right amount of crunch, with a soft inside. It went really with the prawns, chicken, and mushrooms that were mixed in with it. The portion was small too and it definitely left me with wanting more!\n\nOverall this place is just okay. The decor and service was awesome but the food was just okay in terms of taste, portions, and price. Very overpriced for the amount you get. It was about $40/person for us but I felt like I ate $20 worth of food. I would agree with some of the other reviewers that Boiling Crab is better for the price and value.", "author": "Karen C."}

They should address a few deficiencies:\n\n1) They use margarine, and if you ask for butter, you get margarine (they don't use real butter)\n2) I don't like to crack open crab, they wouldn't remove the meat from the creature for me (in Beverly Hills I paid $8.00 extra for this luxury - worth every penny) - no reason given\n3) Valet auctioned off keys to each table while people were dining so they could go home at 9:00, I almost asked for my $10 valet fee back - but then I remembered I could just let you know about this\n4) For my sister's 30th birthday, they didn't do anything nice for her - no special touch, complimentary dessert - just a lukewarm \"do you want us to sing?\" - when we ordered dessert, my sister had to ask for a candle\n\nWe are experienced diners, we tip well, and drink wine.

I remember how good it was, but I don't quite remember how good it was.\n\nIt was our anniversary and we decided for a seafood restaurant since I LOVE SEAFOOD! Like everyone else, we ordered Roasted Garlic Crab ($36), Tiger Prawns with Garlic Noodles ($32), Spicy Calamari w/ Pineapple and Tomatoes ($13), Fruit Juice Cooler (non-alcoholic, $3), and Mango de Fleur (alcoholic, $8.50), Fried Banana with Hazelnut Gelato ($7). Our total was about $100 for 2. \n\nI would recommend the Roasted Crab, but not the Tiger Prawns w/ Garlic Noodles. There were only 4 prawns with that price it's not worth it. Spicy calamari wasn't impressive because we were expecting it to be fried, but turned out to be just stir-fried. Mango de Fleur was good, but I didn't taste much of alcohol in it. It's too pricy for $8.50, since it was in a flute. I would definitely recommend juice cooler. Fried banana was ordinary, but the hazelnut gelato didn't click for me.

Like most guys, I'm pretty lazy when it comes to eating crab. I might eat the best parts by using a fork and completely ignore the legs and claws. TL's roasted garlic crab is to die for. Even though it's really unhealthy how they soak the crabs in butter before roasting, but it really is the tastiest ones around. I've tried the drunken crab, its ok, but nothing compared to the roasted one. It really is the best. I don't mind getting all dirty and oily at all. Some think one is enough to share with 2 or 3 people. I can probably eat two by myself on a good day, so do order one for yourself and don't share. \n\nAlso don't share the garlic noodles. It's pretty much spaghetti with garlic and butter, but for some reason, however they make it, it goes really well with the crab. I guess you need to add a little carb to the meal. I usually just get the roasted crab and the garlic noodles and I'm pretty much done. I've had friends order other dishes like fish or prawns, but those are just mediocre. \n\nI would have easily given it 5 stars, but the service wasn't all that great. Maybe because most of the evenings I've dined here were on weekends when it's really crowded and busy. But for the prices they charge, which are upscale restaurant prices, I expected the service to be better. Most of the servers act like they are in a pho place and weren't very friendly.

Back then they were relatively unknown, it was more a local place than the bay area famous and now expanded multi location family run business. (If you didn't know, the kids run the Crustacean's chain, with locations in SF, Beverly Hills and Las Vegas).\n\nOne day my friends and I had decided to go to Thahn Long's for dinner. Much to our horror they were boarded up and a sign said \"closed for remodeling\". It was really sad! We were so looking forward to the best damn crab on earth! \n\nNearly a year later they re-opened and to astonishment Thanh Long has become a very fancy place. They even had a dress code! Which they have done away with...which I think was a bad idea. The food is awesome, not one bad thing on the menu. But from time to time when I go there. I feel like I'm surrounded by the entourage of a ghetto rap star. People come in wearing track suits, shorts and sports jerseys or just jeans and a tshirt. Which really makes things awkward considering everyone else is dress casual, business attire or suit and tie/dress. Thanh Long has definitely become an upscale restaurant. I think it's kind of a shame that they don't require a dress code anymore. \n\n\nOK back to the food. \n\nI like to take friends and family to Thanh Long's who have never been before. I make sure that their first time they get the roasted crab....an ENTIRE roasted crab for themselves. I often see a table of four people get only ONE CRAB for all four of them! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!!! \n\nWhen you go to Thanh Long you HAVE TO GET ONE CRAB for each person. You will ALWAYS....ALWAYS want more. \n\nI've been several time in recent memory where I've been sat next to other tables of two and been just put to SHAME! When you go to Thanh Long for crab you usually want to eat it in a relatively short period of time so the juices don't cool down and harden on the plate. I usually make it ....but in the last few times I've been....I've seen younger smaller asian girls and even older asian women eat an ENTIRE crab for themselves in 20 minutes! Talk about jaw dropping shame and humiliation HAHAHAHAHA They just SCARFED the crab.....and they had DESSERT and were done and paid the bill in under an hour. That folks are SKILLS!\n\nGarlic noodles are to die for. Creme Brulee is one of the best I've had. I've had Creme Brulee in Paris and it wasn't as good.\n\nI've been to Crustaceans here in SF....the food is good but the recipe is slightly different. I prefer the original Thanh Long. Though parking is a nightmare.\n\nI highly suggest after eating at Thanh Long you make a trip to the 7-11 across the street for mints and/or gum.", "author": "Leo V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-27", "description": "We had tamarind crab. The crab itself is pretty fresh but the overall dish is not authentic tamarind crab at all. We could barely taste the tamarind in the sauce, it mostly had tomato sauce which is quite unexpected. If you Google \"tamarind crab\" you will see this is very different than the authentic one. The sauce is too wet for typical tamarind crab. The Asian bouillabaisse is not authentic either, not enough herbs, but has scallion instead, which is a little odd. Authentic dish normally doesn't have green onion. The mango salad was quite unexpected as well. Mango is not shredded but chunky instead, which might not be that big of a deal. However, the fried ice cream dessert had too much batter, very little ice cream while the ice cream is also melted quite a bit. And, it doesn't look very appealing either. It's a sort-of flatten dark looking ball rather than a nice round ball we normally see. It looks like it got overburned. The waitresses wear traditional clothes, which is kind of nice. That is about the only thing that is traditional at this restaurant. If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, this is not the place to go. The dishes are quite expensive too. A tamarind crab (market price) is for $48 and it's not that huge either. I think the restaurant is overrated because of its owners' fame and history.", "author": "A N."}

I love the version at PPQ Dungeness Island so I figured I would love Thanh Long.  Boy was I wrong.  \n\nThe crab itself was actually quite tasty but when I went to try the noodles I noticed what looked like cheese on top.  I was fairly surprised to see such a thing since we were in a Vietnamese restaurant, so I asked the waitress to be sure.  Our waitress confirmed my suspicions.  Since I really don't like cheese I asked our waitress if we could have an order of the garlic noodles without cheese.  She tersely replied that all the noodles were pre-made and could not be adjusted.  I am confused - are the noodles made in a factory in Iowa and then shipped to Thanh Long to be re-heated?  Is it possible that Thanh Long makes a bath tub full of cheesy garlic noodles at 4:30 in the afternoon for their entire dinner service?  Surely at some point in the evening the chef's must make a new batch of noodles.  Evidently not because our waitress made it very clear that there was no way possible to have an order of noodles without cheese.  \n\nWell turns out eating roast crab without garlic noodles really is not the same experience.  Given the high prices we were paying and the fact that we were celebrating a Birthday I was shocked that this simple request could not be met.  Turns out I was not missing much all those times I ate at PPQ instead of going to Thanh Long.", "author": "Dana H."}

Their world famous roast crab definitely lives up to the hype and it goes really well with the garlic noodles but you have to be able to get a little messy because you have to crack open the crabs yourself.  The yummy buttery goodness of the roasted crab is absolutely bad for your cholesterol, but at least your stomach would be super happy =]!  However, it's a bit pricey.  One crab would costs about 40 bucks depending on the season, so I would recommend that you share with someone so it doesn't make such a  big hole in your wallet.  But then again, the food is so good that you really wouldn't want to share with anyone.  \n\nThe customer service here was really good.  The waiters were really friendly but not to the point that you're annoyed of them.  The wait for the food was pretty decent, about 30-40 minutes.  Also before the meal they put on a bib for us and after they gave us nice and warm towels to clean up our hands and faces from eating the crabs like the savages we were.  \n\nThe restaurant is fairly small and it gets pretty busy here sometimes so it's best to make a reservation before you come.  And parking anywhere in San Francisco sucks, but there's valet parking right next to the restaurant and it's pretty cheap, around 5 bucks or so.

That's why I was ecstatic to learn about Thanh Long and its famous signature crab dishes. \n\nWhile I liked the modest interior and servers wearing traditional Vietnamese tunics, my first indication that Thang Long might disappoint was the menu's statement that Thanh Long is related to Crustacean - a place that fails to meet my standards for a decent Vietnamese restaurant. \n\nThe reality is that the An family establishments serve inauthentic Vietnamese food, which wouldn't be a bad thing if the food was pleasingly innovative. As it stands, the roasted crab in salt and pepper butter is nice but certainly nothing to write home to Vietnam about. The garlic noodles, sure, are delectable, but a restaurant cannot be judged by side dishes. The traditional cabbage salad tasted far from traditional with a watered down fish sauce vinagrette.\n\nThe only authentic and quite delicious thing I had were the fried bananas with ice cream. That was quite a treat.", "author": "Baochi N."}

What can I say about Thanh Long? \n\nWell, I have been a loyal fan of Thanh Long for a Long Looooooong time...I started going there even before they had their swanky renovation...EXACTLY! I remember the good old days when their crab was still under $20 a piece and before Valet parking was available. So there!\n\nNow about the food...Crab and Garlic Noodles are a MUST! Although they have a wide selection of food items on the menu, I can bet you a US $1 that every table you look around you would see people enjoying the Crab and Garlic Noodles. Okay, bets are off, I know there's always an exception to the rule...but I haven't personally witnessed a table that doesn't have the two things I mentioned above.\n\nAs for the Crab, you basically have 3 epicurean options (They are listed in the order of my likings - from top to bottom):\n\n1) Roasted Crab - lots of butter and cracked pepper cooked with their secret family recipe. It's Da Bomb!\n\n2) Drunken Crab - flavor is less intense than the roasted crab but it's still yummy.\n\n3) Crab in Tamarind Sauce - my least favorite of all (not because there's anything wrong with it, I just LOVE the Roasted Crab the best!)\n\nThen the Garlic Noodles...just YUMMY YUMMY! Though sometimes I just wanted to focus more on the CRAB and wanted to forego the garlic noodles...believe me, it's hard to do!\n\nI can usually finish one whole crab by myself (it's a good size crab by the way) and perhaps TWO on a good night...it's that GOOD!\n\nThe only drawback that I have personally experienced is that after eating the crab and the garlic noodles, I'll be too full to have desserts! Though, sometimes I'd go all out and ordered the Creme Brulee and some fancy tea (with Rose buds). It was a great way to end this wonderul dining experience. \n\nI forgot to mention that the few appetizers I have had there were all very good. The one that really stood out was their Salmon with Capers drizzled in Olive Oil served with toasted French bread slices.  Try it! It's GOOD!\n\nAnd the SERVICE was friendly and attentive.\n\nHope you get a chance to taste it...I can't wait to go back there myself!", "author": "Jen L."}

All part of the fun.\r\n\r\nNow for the crab: Huge, meaty, and delicious.  You should be hungry if you order one of your own because: a) it's quite a bit of work b) it's a fair bit of meat c) if you order the standard roast crab and you're slow, the butter on your plate will coagulate in an unappetizing manner (the drunken crab, with a wine sauce, doesn't suffer from this problem).  But a half crab alone isn't really enough for a full meal, in my opinion, so judge your own capacity accordingly.  I think the price for a crab on the night we went (early March) was $34.\r\n\r\nChardonnay is supposed to be the traditional wine accompaniment for crab, and I have to say, it's quite a delicious pairing.

Crab ravioli was pretty much the age old bastardized crab rangoon, so not worth the calories there.  Fried ice cream was sent back b/c the shell was undercooked and the ice cream half melted; happily replaced with the choco lava cake.", "author": "david l."}

We got the mussels, a veggie dish, and i forgot the third appetizer, but they were all pretty good. Small portions though. Then came the crabs.

We also all agreed that you could get better ones for cheaper at other places.\n\nThe noodles were super garlic-y and good, but I don't see why there's so much hype about them.

I didn't know what to expect, I've never actually had mango in my salad.  But boy was it amazing!  (It might actually be the best salad I've ever had!)  Immediately following were the garlic noodles.  I must admit, I wasn't exactly thrilled to see a slab of green noodles, but it was surprisingly quite tasty.  It definitely complemented the roasted crab-which by far was the best dish there!  Everything about the meal was perfect!  Nice decor, good customer service, and most importantly, delicious food!  \n\nSIDE NOTE:  I wouldn't recommend having a first date here because you really have to get hands-on with the crab.

We glanced quickly at the menu and decided to order everything the restaurant was famous for. For the four of us, we ordered rice rolls, 2 roasted crab, prawns on garlic noodles and shaken beef.\n\nThe rice rolls were teeny-tiny and not particularly great. \n\nThe Shaken Beef was tender, with perfect pieces of roasted potatoes and caramelized onion on a bed of lettuce and cherry tomatoes. It tasted so good we even ate the wilted bed of lettuce so we could get the last drops of beef juice.\n\nThe crab was ok - given that this is their signature dish, I have to say that I expected more. The roasted crab is basically a very large crab swimming in oil, salt and pepper. \n\nThe prawns on garlic noodles - heavenly. Four pieces of succulent roasted prawns on their signature garlic noodles, which are strangely addicting (but give you kicking breath afterward).\n\nThen we got the bill. The crab and prawns are listed as \"market\" price and in our hunger, we forgot to ask what the market price was. We were charged $72 for two crabs and $32 for the prawns. The price for the crabs seemed reasonable given the size of the crabs (one was perfect for two people), but the prawns - 4 prawns for $32?? Still, the prawns WERE awfully good....\n\nThe one other thing to note is that Thanh Long is deeeeep in the Sunset district.

The bread was buttery and the sauce was oily (since it's pesto), but it was pretty good.  We also had the Soft Shell Crab.  This was just deep fried soft shell crab with a tamarind-chili sauce on the side.\n\nOf course we had to order the roasted crab and garlic noodles (I'm a huge fan of garlic noodles, so we had to each get our own order).  It was delicious.  The crab was drenched in butter and garlic and black pepper.  \n\nWe finished with Grandma An's Banana Bread Pudding.  This was delicious.  The bread pudding is more like a slice of super soft bread pudding with lots of bananas, but that paired with the hazelnut ice cream was a nice finish to our fattening meal.  We spent about $140 (inc. tax & tip) for 2 appetizers, crab, 2 orders of garlic noodles, and dessert.", "author": "Ring K."}

So I was very hesistant to get down and dirty with some crab.  I was there on a date (UGH, I hate that word), and it was just the beginning of the night so I didn't want to have that distinctive crab smell lingering (feel me?)...  With a little bit of convincing I end up ordering the Drunken Crab.\n\nI'm going at it!  Crab meat in my finger nails, shells flying everywhere (one landing in my hair, btw), and juices dipping down my finger tips..  It was a MESS to say the least, but it was well worth it!\n\nSo you know me, I'm all about the sauce in dishes, right? At this point, I'm dipping my crab meat in my date's plate (Thanks D, for sharing).. haha!

The shaken beef was very tender.  We got our food surprisingly fast!...which was great cause I was starving!  I thought the chicken fried rice was just okay...again, a little on the greasy side than flavorful.

However, if you are going to charge me that much for the items on the menu, you better provide me with exceptionally great service. I'm just saying. \n\nAfter hearing rave reviews of this place, I had very high expectations going in. I went on a busy Saturday evening for a birthday dinner. We were seated in their upstairs dining room. Our waiter was a 30-something Asian man. Giving us a moment to look through the menu, he came back to take our orders. We ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari, 2 roasted crabs, 2 garlic noodles, the Vegetarian Delight, the Villager's Favorite, and our drinks. As we were giving him our orders, we asked for his recommendation. All he gave us was a uninterested look, shrug, and \"ehhh, they are good.\" Way to be proud of your restaurant, buddy! However, I was impressed how he took our orders without writing them down... until, he can back when he forgot our order. -_- It was a busy evening for them that night. For me it's a make it or break it moment for a restaurant. If managed correctly, it is great, you enjoy a great meal without a worry in the world. However for me, this was not the case. Our waiter forgot to bring us bibs & scrap bowls to eat our crab, he came with our drinks after we finished our dinner, he did not refill our water, he did not offer warm towelettes to clean our hands and he did not offer us the dessert menu. I guess the waiter \"made up\" for it by saying the Salt & Pepper Calamari was on the house. I could have passed on the over-salted and over-peppered calamari rings. \n\nThe good. The roasted crab and garlic were delicious! The crab meat fell right out of the shell. It was a good size crab too. Very tasty.", "author": "Pamela P."}

We decided to do family style dining and share a bunch of dishes . . . however, looking around the restaurant we noticed that everyone had their own crab and it would've ended up being a little cheaper if we had done that. Duly noted! We got the roasted crab (the best!), drunken crab (less flavor than the roasted one), and tamarind crab (sweet sauce). We also go the garlic noodles (very plain but oh so tasty - drenched in garlic), shaken beef (almost more like a beef salad), stuffed calamari (unmemorable), and fried blue crab (standard fare).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-28", "description": "I have heard about Thanh Long forever, but had never been until this night.  I knew they were a sister restaurant to Crustacean, but I have never been there either - though I have eaten their crab.\n\nThis restaurant is known for their \"roasted crab\" - and on this evening, Rob and I ordered an exorbitant amount of food.  As I gawked at what he was ordering, he said, \"Well we will reheat the leftovers for tomorrow.\"\n\nMade perfect sense to me!\n\nFirst, we ordered a bottle of Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($50).  We thought it'd pair nicely with all the dishes, and it did.  \n\nWe ordered salt and pepper calamari for an appetizer, got shaking beef, sea bass, garlic noodles, and roasted crab.\n\nI thought the calamari was excellent - lightly breaded, fried perfectly and while it's a deep-fried item, you don't feel like a hog eating this up.  Then came the garlic noodles - which was served along with the shaking beef and sea bass.  The noodles were outstanding - perfectly cooked and seasoned, tons of garlic (almost too much for my taste) and full of flavor.  The shaking beef was extremely \"Americanized\", if you will, being entirely too sweet for my palate, but it was good beef and went nicely with the noodles.  Sea bass, in my opinion, is a hard fish to mess up as it basically tastes great however you cook it as long as it's not overdone.  It does, however, need to be dressed up to really make the flavor stand out, or it risks being a bland fish.  While there was nothing wrong with how they cooked it - -  it was one of the few times I thought sea bass to be boring.  It needed a kick of some sort - desperately.\n\nThe crab arrives - and we dug right in.  The flavor was good, and it was served piping hot in a soup which consisted basically of butter.  Can't ask for more.  The crab itself was covered in pepper.  To say one will have to get messy is an understatement.  \n\nHaving said that - I don't consider this to be any better than Crustacean's crab.  Furthermore, perhaps because I have gone crabbing myself and had the freshest Dungeoness Crab one would eat straight out of the ocean and steamed alive on the spot - - it never crossed my mind that this was \"THE BEST\" I have had.  Very good - yes.  The best - - not quite!\n\nIt almost embarrasses me to report that not only did we finish every single thing we ordered - we hemmed and hawed over whether we should order one more crab.  After a few minutes, we did, and therein lied our mistake - - we waited too long to order and got fuller by the minute.  We ate about one leg each off the crab and packed the rest for home.  Well, at least we did have leftovers, like we intended.\n\nService was what was exceptional at this restaurant.  In particular, I am referring to our server - a young man who was the epitome of polite, attentive, friendly but professional all at the same time.  The few times we asked for anything - he got it immediately, and the rest of the time, we never needed a thing because he took such good care of us.  I was also impressed when he didn't bat an eye at how much food we ordered.\n\nYes, we ordered dessert.  (Don't forget, it's Rob and Grace here...)  Initially, Rob declined dessert but seriously, how does one refuse this:\n\n\"FRIED BANANA A LA MODE\"?\n\nWe ordered that and two Vietnamese Iced Coffees - - both were OUTSTANDING and a perfect grand finale to a gluttonous feast.\n\nThe meal was not cheap by any means - but it was a lot of food and we left happy.  The total bill closed in on $300 by the time we tipped.  \n\nWe had some plans to check out a few bars after dinner, making it a full date night.  The food comas that followed the meal prevented any outings and we headed straight home.  \n\nIn summary, Thanh Long is worth trying at least once.  While the ambiance is not \"romantic\" by any means, it's not grungy either.  It's ideal for a Sunday night family dinner (if you have reservations) or dinner with close friends.  It's nice for a casual date, but not quite up to \"impress the socks off\" level, if you know what I mean.  But with great service and good food, not to mention a pretty nice wine list, I am declaring that Thanh Long makes it onto my date list on Yelp.", "author": "Grace K."}

I've definitely experienced better at this place.\n\nFor years our family and friends enjoyed coming here. We have our regular dishes that we always order and have never been let down...year after year.\n\nRecently, we came for dinner mid-week, anticipating the same great experience and meal we usually get but had  a very rude awakening. \n\nFirst, we witnessed the male host/manager (whom we never seen before) treat a customer very rudely. A pregnant lady had let the male host know that they had a reservation and provided the name. He looked up the name and asked if she had a reservation, she said \"yes\". And he asked again, she said the name, he affirmed the name and asked AGAIN if they had a reservation. She again replied \"yes\". It was so bizarre that I was tempted to intervene and maybe help the host understand that she said \"yes, she has a reservation\". We were at the bar and could clearly hear him asking the same question over and over. And she was clearly saying yes they have a reservation under the name he said. Then he told her to wait until her husband showed up. WTF. Strange that he didn't just seat them. The place was not crowded nor was there anyone waiting to be seated. He definitely lacked basic customer service skills. And the owner should be ashamed that their host yelled a pregnant lady who was just wanting to be seated. \n\nThat was them. Now us...\nService was decent. It was not busy at all so we got our food quickly.\nWe ordered our usual appetizers: mussels and the shrimp toast. Mussels were great. The Shrimp Toast was garbage. Toast was not toasted and the shrimp was like rubber. \n\nMain course: Roasted crabs for everyone. The crabs were dry and the flavor was slightly off. All of us felt the same disappointment with our crab. Not the juicy succulent crabs they used to have. Could it be it was out of season? But that never affected the quality of their crabs in past years.\n\nGarlic Noodles: This is always a winner, except for this day. The noodles used to be flavorful, tasty and long. The noodles we got were shorter than usual (or cut up) and the flavor was not evenly distributed. It's like the noodles weren't mixed thoroughly and the sauce was missing something. Never in my wildest dreams would I expect them to mess up their signature Garlic Noodles. Another WTF moment. \n\nIt was a night of disappointments. I'm so sorry we had come out of our way to go here for dinner. The front was as poorly managed as the kitchen. Hopefully they bring back the former GM or change the one there last night. This place used to be a special place for us but I am hesitant to go back any time soon.", "author": "Stella M."}

The seats are comfortable with new clean table cloths. We ordered what most people recommend \"Roast Crab\" and \"Garlic Noodles\". Ladies don't forget to bring a hair tie if you hair is long because it can get messy... not to worry about your clothes because they put a bib around your neck. The garlic noodles taste weird, perhaps because it's not fresh (reheat-in-a-microwave taste) we probably had the leftover noodles from the night before, and for $9.50 it's not worth ordering the second visit. But then again it sort of compliments the Crab, which I must admit is one of the best crabs I've ever tried.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-12", "description": "We were told this is the authentic place to get crab and garlic noodles: less touristy than the Crab House on Pier 39, cheaper and better than its sister Crustacean Restaurant.  We made a reservation at 8 PM on a Sunday evening and waited maybe 10 min.  Plastic bibs are given to diners.  We ordered what they're famous for: the roasted crab and garlic noodles.  We also ordered shaking beef.  The roasted crab is a huge dungeness crab seasoned very little (salt and pepper) as all fresh seafood should be.  The garlic noodles seemed like spaghetti saut\u00e9ed with minced garlic and butter and then coated with garlic powder.  Super garlicky as in my breath was reeking well into the night even after brushing my teeth, but us Asians love garlic so we don't care.  The shaking beef was very tender and marbled--perhaps ribeye--and flavored well enough so that you didn't need the dipping sauce of salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  Everything was really good, and had it not been my second dinner, I would've eaten much more.  The dinner was expensive though--each crab was $40.  But we were on vacation, and when we vacation, we vacation big.  Like celebrities.", "author": "Christine H."}

I'd rather pay for the fine dining experiences at Crustaceans and put up with the parking in the city.  Although it is a fact that Thanh Long and Crustaceans is a family business, I just didn't feel all the raves from the other yelp reviewers.  I guess it's my fault b/c I walked in with high expectations of this restaurant since Crustaceans lived up to my expectations.  Don't get me wrong, the service is supurb.  We got this waiter who took our order by memory...and we ordered a helluva lot of food!!!!  Tamarind and Roast crab is a HIT!!! The drunken was okay.  Prices are the same in the Crustaceans restaurant.  Again, this restaurant is okay - the atmosphere is full of locals and people not from the area of SF but it is cramped.  I really like the Crustaceans restaurant in the city way better.   I don't plan to come out here again unless I was invited to attend a party.", "author": "Lyn D."}

Parking is hard to find...then again it's SF right. It's located in the corner. The outside was whatever, but the inside looks really nice and upscale. We got seated right away and the table that we got was so tiny. What I didn't' like was that we were literally right next to other people because the place is too tight & needs more room. Anyways, the waiter was very friendly. I got the garlic noodles ($10) because that's a must! It was REALLY good, but very oily and fatty. The roasted garlic crab wasn't that great for ($37) I rather eat my bf parent's crab but I gotta say it did have a lot of meat and when you use a small fork it makes you feel like your eating more? haha Lastly, we tried the shaken beef which had a lot of flavor and the meat was tender. I like how there was salad on the bottom which goes well together. I think it was way over priced because I'd rather eat at the one at Tasty garden, but it was all for the experience and since I was there I might as well try all the good stuff. I think I would only come back for the garlic noodles. Everything else isn't  worth that much. I feel like I was paying more for the atmosphere, but yes garlic noodles is a MUST!

But the food - rather the roasted garlic crab and garlic noodles are as good as ever.  I have never ordered anything else, I don't I ever will.  It's so darn good!  Over the years, we have \"mastered\" the way WE like to eat the crab.  We order one and split it between the two of us and as we're finishing it, we order our second crab.  It stays hotter and the butter (there is a lot of it) doesn't start to harden as it cools off.  Hard to say which is better - the crab or the garlic noodles.  If you want the real thing from the original secret kitchen, this is the location.  For those who want the ambience and fancier setting, go to Crustaceans in the city, I heard its just as good although I have never been.", "author": "Grover G."}

It was Sunday night. We had a reservation and valeted the car; neither gave us a long wait (however, it was still very busy inside). We split an order of spring rolls, then Mom ordered the Villager, roomie ordered fish fillet, and I got the stuffed calamari. Though the flavors were good (but not astounding) with mine, the calamari was too rubbery to be enjoyable, and the stuffing lacked pizzaz. Mom's and roomie's dishes were better, but overall I wasn't mindblown. We ordered a creme brulee and orange sherbet for dessert; they brought us the sherbet and some pastry-looking thing instead. We set the waiter straight and he said he'd be right back with the creme brulee, but never brought it (nor did he leave us the pastries lol). The sherbet tasted just like a dixie cup or cremesicle--nothing special. When the bill came (over $100), we were charged for the creme brulee we never got, so we had to fix that too.\n\nAll-in-all, I don't think we received the customer service that should accompany such a high-priced establishment. The food was just okay--but, in all fairness, we didn't order any of what seem to be the restaurant signature/crowd favorite dishes.

We got there, and it was pretty empty...with maybe 20 diners at about 5-6 different tables.  Barren compared to when Anhie T. and I came about 2 yrs ago.  We were seated immediately, and looked over the menu, and ordered the following:\n\nCrispy Rice Paper Roll ($7.50) - your standard Vietnamese Egg Roll.  But here you get once egg roll cut into four pieces.\nThanh Long Mussells ($10.95) - five mussells served with five slices of thin garlic bread.  This dish was delicious.\nSteamed Sea Bass ($24.95) - sea bass was flaky, moist, and really good.  The sauce was sweet and gingery.\nStuffed Calamari ($15.95) - lots of calamari stuffed with minced meat in a tomato based sauce.  Parents didn't like it so much, but I thought it was okay.\nShaken Beef ($20.95) - very flavorful, and a dish that everyone loved.  The beef was tender and potatoes were flavorful.\nGarlic Noodles (2 orders at $9.50 ea) - Garlicky and delicious! \nRoast Crab (I think it was $38) - really good crab...but compared to Crustaceans, it's not the same.  Not as flavorful, but still very, very good nonetheless. \nCreme Brulee (2 orders) - My dad and Anhie T. thought this was the best dessert dish.\nBanana Cake - I liked this dish and everyone else didn't like it.  Served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, a dallop of whip cream, this cake seemed to be made out of only bananas.  Anhie T. said it was bland.  I disagree.\nHot Chocolate Cake - served with Vanilla ice cream...this was good.  Really rich though.\nCoke (2 glasses) - served from their bar in a tall, slim glass.  No free refills.\n\nTotal bill with tax + tip came out to $218.\n\nThis was my parents first time here and they loved the crab, and garlic noodles.  They did say it was a bit oily, but c'mon, roasted crab and garlic noodles anywhere is a bit oily.  But here's a good sign.  As they left, they took some business cards.  That means they liked their food and they'll be back...probably with some family friends!\n\nDepending on my the mood (and thickness of the wallet), I would come back.  \n\nBut other substitutions are very comparable:  PPQ is cheaper and quality isn't far behind, while Crustacean is a tad more expensive, but swankier....\n\nTip 'o the day:  Avoid the valet parking outside.  Parking isn't too difficult in the Sunset.  And even if you had to walk one block after dinner, it may clear up your arteries after all the butter used in cooking the crab!", "author": "Daniel M."}

I would eat here several times a year, but haven't been here is about four years until this week. The roasted crab-still amazing. Not so much anything else.  I always have the crab, garlic noodles and fried bananas, These were my all time favorites hands down--DELICIOUS! However, I was so disappointed this time I will never return. So sad!  Don't get me wrong the crab was amazing! The garlic noodles were not. Very disappointing! I used to order a plate for myself and a plate to go, but they have gone down hill. The fried bananas had a really thick batter and the bananas seemed to be picked green right off the tree-kind of chewy and earthy tasting. They added whipped cream and chocolate sauce to the dish and destroyed it. Also, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari and it was so overcooked we didn't touch it after the initial taste. After 25 years of enjoying great meals here, I'd done. I won't return.", "author": "Rainey M."}

Upon arrival, we were bombarded by people trying to get their crab on.  Yes, entire families with babies, huge groups, people dressed like they were going to a ball game.  The host stand is probably a mere 12 feet from the door.  The fact that it took me 15 minutes to push and shove my way through the masses upon masses of people just to check in and say we were there, was enough to make me want to hit someone.  The fact that it was probably 45 degrees and windy outside didn't help because it drove everyone inside.  I just could not believe how many people were there.  It was like a cattle herd being corraled into a pin.  After checking in with the host, we had to wait for our name to be called.  We decided to call Crustacean, where we originally wanted to go, but couldn't get a reservation until 9, and they told us there was not a long wait at all.  So much for trying to get an early reservation.  We ditched Thanh Long and headed to Crustacean where we only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table and got to sit at the bar for a much needed drink.  This ended up being the best idea and we even sat next to Jerry Rice!  \n\nOverall, I hear the food at Thanh Long is better, but after that experience and how they absolutely, horribly handled the situation on Valentine's day, I never want to go back.", "author": "Vanessa Z."}

It came with noodles at a cost of $36 dollars (obsolutely a rip off).\nThis place is not in a good location and there are no street parking and they ask that you pay $10 upfront for valley parking. If you have a reservation and the party is not all present, you are given 15 min and you could loose the reservation...\nI have never been to a place where I ate noodles for $10 and noodle and 4 shrimps for $36.\nI have to say that the crab is good if you like a lots of butter on it, salt and balck paper at a cost of $40.

The restaurant was remodeled a few years back, and now it's got gilt finishing on the walls and swanky martini cocktails. I've been there many times over the last 10 years and I'm ashamed to say I only tried a handful of their dishes.  What I've tasted was good, but I thought over-priced for what it was, like the Prawns with the Garlic Noodles; I think that one was something like $18.  \r\nBesides, for me, the other dishes pretty much paled next to the Roasted Garlic Crab.  Wait for the Dungeness Crabs to come in season so the market price isn't so steep and you're getting more crab for your buck (starts around December). They serve your crab on a large platter SWIMMING in melted butter, crusted in sea salt and coarse black pepper. People dress up these days to eat at Thanh Long, but whatever, just make sure you can loosen the waistband, roll your sleeves back and tuck in.  Yes, very fashionable bibs are provided for the grub-down you're embarking on when you get the crab (there are other kinds of crab to choose, too, but again, I've never really noticed).

While I am not a big crab fan I do like the crabs here - ok 'like' is an understatement considering that I am drooling here just thinking about the crabs and garlic noodles. Just know that you will be getting down and dirty with the crab so it is not an attractive sight for first dates or any plans for a romantic evening, and you will be tasting the special sauce aka garlic for the next day or so, not to mention eau du garlic will be eminating out of your pores. Do order one crab at a time because congeeled butter is not an appetizing sight (not that it stopped us from chowing down).

We kind of have this unfinished business/ past history thing at this establishment.

For soups we ordered asian bouillabaisse, which was tasty, with just the perfect amount of tamarind. For entrees we ordered the steamed sea bass, which I thought was just a tad overcooked, but the sauce was good. The colossal royal tiger prawns were really nothing to brag about, but the garlic noodles.....wow they were delicious. I would come back here, just for the garlic noodles. The drunken crab tasted like soapy dishwater to me, I guess I should have ordered the Roasted crab. The service was great, but the silverware was dirty. I would come back here, but the food is just too overpriced. A lot of these dishes you can definitely order at another restaurant for half the price and will taste just as good if not better. It's kind of funny how some of the dishes are home style type of dishes, but the names are changed to sound a lot more sophisticated so that they can charge an arm and a leg.

She came to SF with her three daughters and with her money, bought a building ( the original site on Judah) and began to cook the recipes from her past. Her husband soon followed and now she has two resturants in the city ( Crustaceans) one in LA and one in Vegas.

Everyone agrees that the baked crab and garlic noodles are to die for. But you should also try the sea bass--light and fluffy, exquisite. And get the BBQ squid for an appetizer.  My only complaint is when crab is not in season, the quality of what you get is mixed--have gotten some frozen, tasteless crab.  But I guess that when you drown it in butter and garlic, it can pretty much mask everything.  In general, they are good and tasty,but can be pricey.", "author": "Nancy H."}

Perhaps it was the missing ambiance, but the garlic noodles just didn't make me go mmm this time.  The seafood combination fried rice did, though.  The scallops, crab, and shrimp were flavorful, yet it wasn't too overpowering.  The Thanh Long red snapper was fresh and seasoned perfectly.  The Villager's favorite however, was overly seasoned.

Just something about garlic noodles and crab.\n\nWe excitedly ordered the seafood dumplings to start, garlic noodles and roasted crab as the main entrees, and the molten lava chocolate cake w/ \"gelato\" as dessert.\n\n- seafood dumplings - were terrible. Mushy, overcooked. Something you would imagine a college student boiling frozen dumplings and putting out. One order has five pieces. Garnished with carrot slices and a dipping sauce.\n\n- garlic noodles - were every bit as garlicky and oily as other reviewers as presented. What they haven't mentioned was that it's presented as a dull lifeless dish. Looks like chowmein with nothing on it, on a drab white plate as if it was prepared in bulk. Tasted like it too. One plate will serve two.\n\n- roasted crab - I don't know if it was just our crab, but this thing was looked like it was rolled in black pepper. Sure, the description says salt and pepper, but this was ridiculous. I think the top of the pepper shaker fell off? Once you got past that, the crab was moist and succulent with garlic and butter. Again, one order will serve two.\n\n- molten lava chocolate cake - Everyone knows that dessert is the last thing you remember about a meal, because it's the last thing served. The menu mentioned \"molten lava chocolate cake\" with \"gelato\". For one, there was no gelato. Vanilla ice cream was served. The waiter did not bother mention that until after it was served.

I wanted to be able to savagely chomp into luscious limbs of crab (who needs crustacean crackers when you've got bicuspids?) while my teeth were still free of metal fetters.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, we had the soft shell crab appetizer, a roast crab, a drunken crab, 2 orders of garlic noodles, and the \"peasant's favorite.\" The soft shell crab was tasty with the tamarind sauce, but it was a bit small for $12. The roast crab was garlicky & buttery, with the meat juicy and fresh. The drunken crab was unfortunately on the bland and dry side, despite its wet-sounding name. The garlic noodles were a hit all around, and our hands got so greasy from the crab that we just ate the noodles with our hands as well. Good thing we were seated in a back corner, far way from the disapproving eyes of polite company. =P The pork in the \"peasant's favorite\" clay pot was tender and well-marinated. Everything was tasty but on the pricey side. Market price for crab that day was ~$40, and the small portion of pork was $17 or so. We dropped $40 each and walked out satiated but not stuffed.", "author": "Lillian L."}

Make sure you order plenty for the table because it will get eaten up quickly.  I also usually order the beef dish, its tender and tasty.  Like I said, the food is very flavorful.  Unfortunately I am not a crab-eater and prefer my meat already pulled.  Despite that, I've order several of the crab dishes (garlic and drunken) before.  These crabs are Gi-normous!

The sea bass was a disappointment as the fish was overcooked and chewy.  For garlic noodles at $10.50 ea and nothing else in it?  Too much to pay.  The bill totaled about $215 and that is without tip.  Would I come back?  Not sure as parking wasn't convenient either.  For those who don't mind, you can pay for valet which is $10. One thing that I did like about this place is that we had reservations and they were busy when we got there.  They honored it on time.  That's rare!", "author": "m c."}

The garlic noodles indeed have some crack-like attributes, as noted by other yelpers.  The Vietnamese salad we had was fresh and tasty, but I suspect de-chile'd for the largely non-Asian clientele, and therefore not as good as it could have been.  Sea Bass was also outstanding, buttery and perfect, with a lovely ginger fruit sauce accompanying it.  Bo Luc Lac (Shaken Beef) is only okay - Slanted Door and even Bodega Bistro do it better.  The crab and garlic noodles are what really make it, though.", "author": "Jes H."}

We played it safe and ordered their secret recipe favorites along with some appetizers.\n\nWe went with: coconut prawns, mussels, and salt & pepper calamari for the appetizers.  For our main entree, we stuck with three crabs:  two roasted and one drunken.  We also had two orders of garlic noodle and one chicken garlic fried rice.  With the exception of the fried rice, everything was really good!  The rice wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't as flavorful as everything else.  The garlic noodle is as good as it gets.  Gosh - just writing this review is making me crave that stuff.   Between Crustaceans and Thanh Long, I would probably say Crustaceans crab is more flavorful but Thanh Long will do just fine.  The service at Thanh Long was really good.  Our waitress was attentive and I felt like we were her only table because she paid so much attention.  One thing I do want to point out is that they add gratuity automatically for parties of 6 or more.  We fell in that category.  My only minor issue is that they add the gratuity after tax so we ended up tipping on the tax.  Essentially the waitress left with a little over 20%, which since she was really nice, deserved anyway so it wasn't a big deal.\n\nWe spent a reasonable amount - a little over $50 a person for 6 people.  It won't be the last time I dine here.  I recommend going here and having an appetite only for shellfish and carbs.", "author": "Jess C."}

The drunken crab was ok, but there wasn't enough flavoring inside, but nonetheless it was good. We also got the mango salad which was also pretty good. I guess I expected too much from this place after hearing about it from so many people, but don't get it wrong, this place is GOOD. Oh yeah, they have some good service as well.

In short, the flavors of the food are pretty good, the price of the dishes are comparable to the high-end Chinese restaurant but the portion are ridiculously small. We have ordered three appetizers: crab puffs, buddha spring role and shrimp toast. All of them charge at least  $7.95+ , but I was so surprise when the waiter delivered us the plates, the buddha rice role has only one thin veggie rice role and cut into four pieces, for 8 bucks? this is insane, the crab puffs plate came with 6 fortune cookies with crab paste. And the shrimp toast came with 5 slices of shrimp pate over bacquets.  We also ordered roasted crab which is market price on the menu, the crab tasted pretty good, but it wasn't difficult dish to make, after all it is only roasted with salt, black pepper and butter, and it is about 1.5 lb, the restaurant charged us $37.95, consider a live crab from supermarket is $4 a lb, they are charging 6x market price, but the decoration and ambience of this place is that high-end. The Shaken beef has pretty good flavor, but with $21.95, similar dish from R&G lounge will come double the portion, and R&G lounge is considered high-end and expensive. The Garlic noodle is very so so, the noodle itself was overcooked and kind of sticky. All in all, this is an overpriced restaurant with slightly above average food.", "author": "Daniel H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-25", "description": "First thing you say when waiter arrives to your table...\"Roast crab and garlic noodles with prawns please.\"  That's pretty much all you need to know when you place your order.  Depending on the number in your dining party, order crab accordingly.  Note to self: hold off on ordering the maximum amount of crab you want all at one time.  Ordering the roast crab one at a time saves the \"extra\" crab from getting cold and the butter to congeal.  Trust me, you don't want your crab to get the chills and the butter to coagulate...not too appetizing when that happens.\nFor appetizers, or if you're not into the whole garlic thing, try the Saigon beef!...excellent.  Think mini pieces of tender filet mignon and yummy mixed micro salad with caramelized onions and cherry tomatoes all in one plate.  I don't remember what the sauce is made of, but you've gotta try it!  The salmon carpacchio is very good also...thinly sliced salmon with capers served with sliced toasted baguette.\nYes, the portions of the appetizers (and pretty much the whole menu) are small and prices are high, but you get what you pay for...pretty darn good tasting food.\nIf you still have room for desert after all the crab and noodles, you've got to try the home made banana cake and chocolate cake...oh my!!  The banana cake has got to be my favorite...big chunks of banana and the cake almost has the texture of bread pudding.  The chocolate cake is rich and creamy.  Both are served with ice cream (French vanilla) and some type of vanilla cream sauce I believe.  I don't really pay attention to the sauce because the cake itself is SO good!!\nParking is difficult to locate, hence the valet parking located on 46th for those who don't want to circle the blocks for more than 10 minutes.

The dungeness crab was pretty good. It was very oily and garlicy. the meat was good and the portions were well sized. The garlic noodles were very good, but again very oily and heavy. Not  garlicy to the point where you are hesitant to speak, but still you should have a mint or something to be considerate of others.\n\nThe lemongrass chicken is nothing special. It was like a chicken fry dish that you could find at most decent chinese restaurants.\n\nThe service was okay. Dishes were brought out promptly and served hot.

I've tried other things, but these dishes are my fave!\n\nThe noodles cost about $10 and the crab goes for about 40 bucks each- a little steep compared to PPQ's or other similar places, but I personally taste the difference at Thanh Long's.  To me, it's more authentic.  Yeah, your breath smells like garlic the next morning, but it's so worth it. \n\nI usually go around 4pm, right when they open.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-21", "description": "We ate at PPQ one day before going to Thanh Long so that we could compare what's people been raving about these two places.\nWe ordered the peppercorn crab ($35.95) and garlic noodles ($9.50).\nCompared to PPQ, in my honest opinion, Thanh Long's peppercorn crab is not as delicious as PPQ's ($34.95).\nThanh Long's garlic noodles ($9.50) taste better than PPQ's ($6.50), although is not worth the price (it is good but not something to die for).\nThanh Long's peppercorn crab is apparently soaked in butter sauce which then congealed on the plate quickly enough as the food cools down that it looks disturbing reminding us of how this will contribute to the heart disease. The crab tastes kind of bland, however, the crab comes in a whole, not cut up. One good thing about the crab is that the flesh does not stick to the shell like PPQ's crab. The crab is overpriced considering that you will get the same result if you just steam crabs at home and make butter sauce with pepper dipping.\nPPQ's peppercorn crab is very delicious. I believe the crab is deep fried, then seasoned with sauteed garlic pieces, peppercorn, and spices. However, the crab is cut up, so you won't be able to see the crab in a whole, in case if the crab is missing a leg.\nThanh Long's garlic noodle is delicious however, it does not have any garlic pieces. Instead, they use garlic powder-infused oil. You can just go to Costco buy a big jar of McCormick garlic powder and buy cheap noodle at Ranch 99. $ 9.50 is overpriced.\nPPQ's garlic noodle has garlic pieces in it and it's priced at reasonable $6.50.\nI will not go back to Thanh Long for their peppercorn crab. I would rather spend the money for PPQ's peppercorn crab for the same amount of money (actually PPQ's is a buck cheaper - and BETTER)\n\nThe following weekend, I decided to give the tamarind crab a try. It was worse than their peppercorn crab. It lacked seasoning. For what its name, \"tamarind\", I hardly tasted the tamarind. I even thought the sauce tasted kind of like sweet and sour sauce from chinese takeout.\nThe crab flesh really didn't have flavor. Might as well I buy cooked dungeness crab from Albertsons and dip it in sweet and sour sauce for less than 10 bucks!\n$5.99/lb crab with oyster sauce from Manila Oriental Market on King Dr. would even do better for the taste and the wallet.\n\nThe secret recipe - kept in the vault - Thanh Long claim really does not live up to my expectation.", "author": "Oribel .."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-18", "description": "I've been going to Thanh Long for as long as I can remember. Over 5 years for sure and because of my frequent visits, majority of the staff knows my name and most of them know exactly what I'd usually order... scary I know, but I love it.\n\nI'm giving Thanh Long 5 stars because I feel that the overall experience is great. With a casual atmosphere, cozy modern Asian decor, a wide variety of French/Vietnamese inspired dishes and an amazing friendly staff, it is always a joy to come here. \n\nMust Haves: \n1. Appetizers - Thanh Long Mussels\n2. Entree: Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles. \n    (Large enough portion for two)\n3. Dessert: Vanilla Creme Brulee\n\nPros: This place might look small, but it can seat a ton of people so if you are looking for a great place to host your birthday dinner or celebration dinner, they can accommodate you. Make sure you make reservations at least a month ahead of time.\n\nCons: Parking is horrible, but that's because everyone wants to eat here. To save yourself from wanting to hit every car that is already parked with the bat that is in your trunk because you're annoyed from circling around for the 500th time... Park valet. Make sure you tip the valet guys good because these guys are outside in the cold, for who knows how long, to park your car while you're inside the warm restaurant ready to eat some amazing crab. Another con would probably be that the bar area is extremely small and since it's pretty much combined with the waiting area, being as crowded as it is, you'll feel like you're in a packed dance club trying to get a drink.  Better to wait outside.\n\nAdvice: Make sure you have a reservation, especially during weekends and holidays. It's just for convenience because you don't want to go to the restaurant with a group of people or a date after it took you about an hour or so to find parking and then find out that you would have to wait another hour and half before you get sat. Walk-ins do exist and if you do decide to go that route, you'll probably be waiting around for quite awhile drooling as you watch other people enjoy their meal.\n\nMajor Advice: If you don't like getting your hands dirty, you'd probably want to skip this restaurant. This place is known for their roasted crab and with that being said people... you eat crab with your freaking hands!! So for you dainty girls who are scared to get dirty... this place isn't for you! Eating the crab here is the whole fun experience because you can be in a nice restaurant and still be able to get down and dirty without feeling embarrassed. If you decide to come to this restaurant to dine on anything else but the crab... than you should just choose another freaking restaurant. By you doing that, it's like you deciding to go to a burger joint to order a salad... What the heck!? Don't get me wrong, all of their other dishes are great, but you have to at least order the crab... any crab. If you've already tasted the crab and came back to try the other dishes... please do so because they're just as delicious.", "author": "Violet N."}

I'm with one reviewer who said she has no problem shelling out big bucks for a good meal--neither do my husband and I, when we want to go somewhere nice with our little one after a heavy week. But the roasted crab was small, the sauce was just not that special and the garlic noodles? It reminded my husband of thick top ramen. Fried. Seriously, this was it? We noticed EVERYONE ordering the same thing--roasted crab, plates of the fried top ramen and wondered, WTF? \nIt's just not worth it. We felt completely ripped off. I'd passed by this place a bunch of times and my husband saw this reviewed on \"Check Please\". We were dismayed that this place is so highly recommended. We're completely baffled why so many people think the crab is so excellent, when we've had so much better--up the street, mind you--for much less. \nAlso, my husband was completely turned off when a waiter put a bib on him without asking. I thought it was just weird, why the bib anyway? Isn't that for the crabs that you have to smash yourself with a mallet? Or because we're drooling idiots for spending money here? \n\nAnd, why do they give you cloth napkins, then a bunch of paper napkins? What a waste. My husband didn't leave a tip, then on second thought, I went back in and left a tip since it's not the server's fault. I told the hostess we were disappointed with the meal, and she took the tip, mumbled sorry, and that was it.

And it really is a secret, the closest I got to any info was this past weekend when I sat next to their former food supplier rep and asked her what the secret was. She said they wouldn't tell her. As well they shouldn't. This place shows that hard work and industry secrets are a key to success, as well as great customer service. Roast crab, garlic noodles and champagne are all you need. Well, all I need...to enjoy the best that this place has to offer. Superb attentive staff and your dishes are delivered so quick it's astounding. You find yourself trying to figure out how it's all done when you know you should just sit back and enjoy that this place exists. I even love the location away from all the scene and hustle. People in here are friendly, chatty and happy to be there which make the experience that much better. I don't have many tips, but know how to demolish a crab and be prepared to get messy, bibs are provided. And, for people on dates...make sure your date doesn't eat just a salad. That's not fun for anyone. Pricey but well worth it and don't forget the desserts.", "author": "William R."}

The meat was very tender and flavorful, love the garlic butter!  The garlic noodles were incredibly tasty.  I'm already craving it.  I had this lychee martini type drink.  I don't drink much, but this one had more of the lychee fruity flavor more than the alcohol taste, so I liked it a lot.  I made reservations same day, got there on time, was seated right away.

Seriously.\n\nThe mango salad was kinda bland, totally un-Vietnamese... romaine lettuce with bits of mango and shrimp. I could have tossed it myself at home. The dungeness crab puffs were filled with mayonaise that you can't really taste any crab meat and they weren't 'puffy\". They were basically mayonnaise wrapped in wanton skins.\n\nThe only saving grace was the molten chocolate cake, but served without much flair. The vanilla ice-cream served on the side weren't scoped out properly, it came out all mushed up with the whipped cream. So, I understand that Asians don't do desserts well, but a little imagination on presentation won't hurt. Afterall, we do eat with our eyes first, don't we?\n\nNothing much to talk about.

I had heard about this place referred to previously as Crustacean (but cheaper).  \n\nAfter waiting for about 45 minutes to get in, I finally got the chance to chow-down on some crab - which was the only reason I was inspired to drive so far out of the way.  The service was decent, but not great, and the food would have been good if I stopped after the first 2 or 3 bites.  The problem with the crab is that because it's soaked in butter, the whole plate congels, and what's left is a plate of whitish congeled fat - on which sits a crab.  Not the most appetizing of food options.  \n\nOn the whole, I think I'd rather try this place on a weekday, when hopefully the wait is much shorter and the service is a bit better - which, I think should be the norm for a place that's as expensive as Thanh Long.  The crab dish is fine, but you need to eat it quickly otherwise it just loses its appeal.  I also tried a couple of the other dishes, but none were particularly memorable.", "author": "John M."}

It's so good that it's totally worth donning that humiliating bib to eat a whole garlic crab. It's kind of a dressy place, but that all goes out the window seeing as your hands will be greasy and your good clothes are going to smell like crab anyway. The service is always good and efficient, and we've found the food to be consistent throughout the 5 years of sporadic visits. The restaurant is a bit dressy, but I've come in there with a baseball cap and never got any crap for it. \nI've only gone to this place with my family and between the four of us, we will gladly fast for a whole day in order to eat here. And let me tell you, it can get kind of ugly. I'm totally serious when I tell you our usual order; four garlic roasted crabs(one for each), 2 garlic noodles, prawn wontons, one order of shakenbeer, one order of fried rice, claypot, and an order of calamari. I didn't count white rice, but you bet your ass we eat that too. We usually start with the two orders of garlic noodles, then work our way up. I drink a lot of beers, too. I am pretty sure they are '33'. \nIf there was one dish I had that I didn't care for, it was the drunken crab, which is a whole crab simmered in Chardonnay. It just didn't have that fatty, garlicky goodness of the garlic crab. And I love this 'you get the whole crab' thing. Sometimes, you order crab somewhere and you get the legs. Everyone knows the best part is the crab fat you scoop out from the inside of the shell, not just the wimpy-ass legs. \nAll in all, this is a pretty pricey place to eat in, but the meal itself is quite fun and the atmosphere is not stuffy. I take some strange kind of perverted delight in the cracking sound of flying shells and watching grease congeal from my hands onto my 7th bottle of '33'(pretty sure that was the beer I drank). This is just a great place to get messy, stuff your face, get drunk, and make your car smell like garlic crab for a couple of days.

I felt guilty for not having any veggies to aid in digesting the buttery garlicky goodness, but my experience was finger lickin' good. They say the crab comes from Monterey and Alaska, so expect the bill to be pricey. Other entrees are affordably priced but there is only one vegetarian dish. They give hot hand towels and provide your table with enough napkins and waste bowls. On top of that you get to wear a bib!

However, the roasted crab was understatingly disappointing.  The taste was good but the crab wasn't very fresh.  They serve so many crabs a day that I am not sure how they can be not fresh.  Everything else was soaked in butter and oil.  Dishes were overpriced.  This deep-fried crab wonton dish we had was $10.75 that would have cost about half that much in many other Chinese restaurants.  It was pretty much a wonton with cheese in it and had no hint of crab meat that was supposed to be in it.  The garlic noodle that they sell separate for $9.95 was plain garlic noodles that is more than 2x what you'd pay for in other restaurants, it seems.  The mussels were ok, and basically tasted like Escargot in a French restaurant.

The Parents are notoriously picky about food and the Dad is particularly so when it comes to crab. It has to be fresh, can't be over-seasoned and has to be meaty. Thank goodness for Thanh Long. We ordered the mango salad, Dungeness crab puffs, ginger calamari, Drunken Crab, Roast Crab and the garlic rice. The Boyfriend and I had heard that people loved the garlic noodles but the Parents didn't like the looks of it so the Boyfriend and I again followed the advice of our friend and ordered some garlic rice. In terms of food, Thanh Long gets five stars. The Parents loved the food. The ginger calamari was well-seasoned, not too gingery and not too salty. It was particularly yummy with the pineapples. The mango salad was delicious (it has shrimp and scallops as well) and the garlic rice was flavorful without being overpowering. The Dungeness crab puffs were a big hit but pricey. It was basically a tastier version of crab rangoon. Now for the crab: right before ordering, the Boyfriend and I faithfully checked Yelp and some had said that the Roast Crab was too salty. The Dad isn't too fond of wine-reduction so we tried the Roast Crab first. It was delicious and not too salty at all. The waiter comes over with plastic bibs and you get to cracking (well...the Boyfriend and the Dad got to cracking and then fed the Mom and me bits and pieces). One crab is about enough for one person to be full. One crab is about enough to make two grown men half-full so calculate accordingly. We ordered the Drunken Crab to mix things up and it was also good. It tastes much more Asian in that the wine reduction really saves the flavor of the crab - it's much more crabby than the Roast crab which is more seasoned. The Dad and the Boyfriend liked the Roast Crab a little better, though, so if you want to choose one, I'd advise the Roast Crab. Don't worry about messy/crabby hands. The waitstaff comes by with hot (caution: extremely hot) warm towels for you to towel off between and after crab eating. Finally, for dessert, we ordered orange sorbet. It's really cute - it comes in a frozen orange that's been beheaded and the lemon sorbet comes in a frozen lemon that's been beheaded! The only reason I won't give Thanh Long is that the prices are a bit high. The crab is market price (which meant $37.50 each crab as of June 7, 2009) and the other dishes are pricey as well.", "author": "Christine P."}

And the shaken beef was very good.  We even decided to have dessert and split the Fried Ice Cream and the Fried Pineapple with Ice Cream.  We only picked the fried pineapple because we'd never had it before, but I think we could skip it next time.  They only give you one pineapple ring and it's not that spectacular.  I'd stay with the Fried Banana.  So to round it up, still a solid 4 stars and I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Kris L."}

Ordered up a bottle of Chenin Blanc and the Asian Bouillabaisse for an app... yummy, light and fruity with pineapple, shrimp, and bean sprouts.  I couldn't resist getting the Spicy Eggplant, which was perfect and scrumptious, and the bf got the Drunken Crab... a bad-ass meal!  So good!  They bib you up, strap you with shell-crackers, put a huge crab in front of you, and make you work!  The sauce it's marinaded in is a yummy Chardonnay butter deliciousness, that goes great with the garlic noodles they recommend.  It takes a while to break that sucka, but oh so worth it!  The restaurant has a nice ambiance with high ceilings, authentic art, and succulent aromas.  It comes with a high price tag but where can you get a huge hunk o crab, done up in several different ways, on any given Sunday?  A definite must for those crustacean cravings!", "author": "Tara G."}

I think I perhaps had too high of an expectation after reading all the rave reviews. I did enjoy the experience of watching all my friends eat crabs with their hands wearing bibs. The appetizers were pretty good- we had the fried calamari (very good!), the mussels (also good), and some eggroll looking thing (not as good as the other dishes). We ordered three crabs for the six of us, which was plenty, and we got to try out the different flavors. We also ordered the garlic noodles... which in my opinion is pretty overrated, although unique. After the very garlic-y meal, we had the fried banana with ice cream, and the fried hazelnut ice cream. I felt both were tasty, but nothing extraordinary. All in all- I say that the experience was good, I am glad I tried this place out. However, I probably will not be returning for quite a while. One reason why- I was really thirsty for the rest of the night, I brushed my teeth and tongue twice, and my mouth still felt icky.", "author": "Orie M."}

What a random location for a pretty nice, high ambiance restaurant.  Per yelp recommendations, I made a reservation in advance so seating was easy.  Our table of five shared the famed roast crab ($36/crab), the garlic noodles, the jumbo prawns, spicy eggplant, salt and pepper calamari, Asian bouillabaisse, and banana cake for dessert.  The roast crab was a good size (about 2-2.5 lbs) so three of us shared one (alongside the other food).  Although pretty basic in theory, the garlic noodles were my favorite.  The roast crab was a close second - great flavor and juiciness.  Prawns weren't bad and calamari and eggplant were pretty standard (calamari was lukewarm).  Service was great, and the crowd inside was incredibly diverse (black, white, asian, everyone).  Although pricey, it's super closeby so I would go and try the drunken crab next time.", "author": "Melinda C."}

Came here this past Saturday to celebrate yet another bday.  Arrived around 8pm, a bit of a line for valet then we were in.  We were told it would be about a 25 min wait.  Not so bad about 20 mins into the wait the people after us were told it would be a 45 min wait.  We had the bar handy and were in no hurry.  We finally were shown to our table after the crowded waiting area almost spilled out even more out the door.  Eric our server for the night was on top of his game from his first visit to our table ready to take our beverage order.  In a quick minute he was back with our tea and water.  We were ready to go from there and went onto order the Asian bouillabaisse soup, Fresh tiger prawns on a bed of garlic noodles, Roasted crab & an additional order of garlic noodles.  The soup came out in no time and was served at a perfect temperature.  Soon after we finished our soup our entrees were making their way to us.  Every plate delish as always.  For a treat we shared a creme brulee to calm the garliciness in our systems.  I can't express how much more enjoyable our dinner was because of Eric.  These are the people that keep the customers coming back.  See yah soon Thanh Long.  I have a feeling we'll be back sooner than we even know!!", "author": "Stephanie D."}

We got there at 9:00 pm and the place was jammed. Everyone there is for one reason: get there fingers dirty with crab and suck down plates of garlic noodles. A great guys night out. Take a couple of your best buds and eat like kings. Also be ready to pay like kings. We had 3 guys  3 crabs 2 bottles of wine and total was around $240 with tip. Waiter suggested a great white wine. I was to busy stuffing my face with crab and noodles to catch the name on the bottle. After the meal we asked the hostess about the history of the restaurant and discovered the most awesome story of all time about there kitchen. Shady on the details but it is something like this.....Thanh Long was started back in the 70's by woman that lives down the street. Coolest part about the story is the kitchen. It is called the secret kitchen. only members of the family can go in and out of the kitchen.", "author": "John S."}

We came with a large party and had to wait for 30 mins to get seated (even with a reservation). We all ordered the Bo Luc Lac (Lemon Shakened Beef) which was delicious btw, and of course the garlic noodles (which was gone in 2 minutes) and of course the main dish, which they're famously known for..the CRAB!

The food was flavorful and there wasn't a ton of variety but it was a nice experience and I don't think that I will ever go back. Yes the garlic noodles were good, but let me tell you they were extremely garlic-y. I drank about a pitcher of water or so on my own. I had the butterfly shrimp with garlic noodles which ended up being over $30 - totally not worth it. The crab is hard work just to have a nice dinner.. many people favor the sauce but it's just a fatty, greasy, buttery sauce that if you know how to cook - can do it at home with fresh crab. Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible restaurant, just not for me!

I honestly didn't know what to expect because my friends from Hawaii who were visiting suggested to go to this place. Apparently this place has a reputation even in Hawaii. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place in my own backyard. I wasn't expecting this restaurant to be in the suburbs in the outer sunset. Parking was terrible so my friends and I opted for  valet. I think it was $10. We ordered the soft shell crab and salt and pepper calamari for appetizers and  the roast  crab and garlic noodles for the entree. The soft shell crab was very good. They give you one small deep fried soft shell crab with sweet & sour dipping sauce. The salt & pepper calamari was decent. I thought it was a little too salty for my taste. It left me wanting to take a sip of H2O every time I took a bite. The roast crab was DELICIOUS!! It was really good. I didn't enjoy it as much when the crab became cold. It's served in a puddle of butter that started to congeal at the end of the meal. It wasn't a pretty site. I felt like my arteries were clogging instantly. Every one there seemed to be eating the garlic noodles. We were curious and ordered it as well. I  personally wasn't impressed. It was a pretty simple dish. I think I could have gone without it.  Overall, I give this place 4 stars due to the fact that it was expensive, the lack of parking, and the buttery greasy taste it left in my mouth for the rest of the day.", "author": "Cynthia S."}

The roast crab taste is constant, gotta luv it.  The service last night is not what it used to be.  Servers are in such a hurry that when they walk behind you, a tornado spins around and you know a server just came by.  They sure forgot to smile too and are no longer hospitable, accomodating  the way they used to be.  Even the manager is not friendly anymore.  All just straight business, all dollars and cents. They have lost that \"family\" atmosphere and feeling we used to get from that place.  The other bad thing about them lately?  The reservation clerk.  I called after 3pm Thursday and made a reservation and who ever answered my call made me feel like I was talking to a drill sergeant.  She was in a big hurry and just way-too harsh when she speaks.  You know, the kind that shows, \"no respect\" to the caller/patron?  So I asked her why she's too harsh, she said she takes in some 300 phone calls a day.  I did not want to be rude so I said, it's alright, it's ok.  I was still nice to her.  But in my mind, unless she's doing these as a volunteer for no-pay, which is out-of-the-question, it is safe to assume that she is an employee who's getting paid to answer that phone to take and cancel reservations.  So she needs to learn how to be very nice, cordial and professional, talk slowly and gently to the people who are their customers, especially the famous Roast Crab now costs $39;  the Shaken Beef is $24; and Garlic Noodles at $10 each + tax.  My bill totalled up almost $400 and I still got the feeling that they are trying to rush me out of the door after we ate the banana ala mode, which by the way had a rotten-black banana inside that thick fried flour, that is why I had to ask for another.  They all need to chill out.  The clerk needs to enroll in some telephone etiquette class real quick, otherwise, people will get upset with their piss-poor manners.  Oh BTW, does the An Family (Danny) still own and run this business or it's been sold to those new owners?  I don't recognize anyone there anymore.  Not one familiar face anywhere.

The Thanh Long fish comes with An's garlic noodles, my first bite almost made me really mad that I had gone so long through life without tasting this. Seriously, it was one of the best things I've ever tasted, I couldn't believe it. The Thanh Long fish was also good, it had delicate Vietnamese flavors, very tasty. Of course, the roasted crab was amazing! Sweet, butter, salty, peppery and all in the right amounts.  I liked the two helpings of steaming hot towels they brought for the finger cleanup after eating the crab. I also had a really good Brandy Alexander as my dessert.

We arrived at just before 5 pm and there was already a crowd waiting to get in. I had the roast crab and garlic noodles, where my hubby got the tamarind version (surprisingly a little sweet). I would normally get the drunken crab but I wasn't sure if it was okay with a little one on the way. Because getting the noodles with the roast crab was a little too much butter for me. I should have had a side of white rice. Oh well. We had dessert which was really yummy, green tea creme brulee. I think that meal fulfilled my craving for crab for a while. On a funny note: my husband likes to crack his crab before eating it so he can wash his hands. While he was in the bathroom, the table next to us, requested garlic noodles with the crab already cracked. The waiter had to tell them, that it wasn't on the menu...sorry.", "author": "Jasmin D."}

That's what I like here, especially when I order the roasted crab and garlic butter noodles.  On the other hand, the prices are really high and I expect more refinement when I'm paying so much money.  PT", "author": "pearl t."}

On the plus side, the waiter was very quick to replace the bad crabs and the second round was ok.  Still, they definitely serve crab that's dead for some time here, that's a big no no.", "author": "Q L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-13", "description": "We went there because we heard the crab was really good. Reserve a table when you go. We made the mistake of not reserving a table, and when you are out near that restaurant, there aren't many options to eat that I knew about in that neighborhood. While waiting for our table, I read the description about the owner and the food. Its suppose to be Vietnamese influenced, but I could only find one item that was Vietnamese-like and that was the crab with tamarind sauce. I understand that this restaurant was the first to do this type of style, but another restaurant PPQ Dungeness Island Vietnamese Cuisine on Clement makes a better tasting Crab and Garlic Noodles. We ordered the Sea Bass and it was quite small for the price. I felt it was small enough to be an appetizer rather than an entree. If you are looking for a great place to eat Crabs and Garlic noodles, try PPQ Dungeness Island Vietnamese Cuisine.", "author": "Long T."}

Ok, so I'd pass by this place EVERY DAY before and after I go to work and when I would get home (which is around 8:30pm) the place is already busy and packed with people (especially on the weekends).  So I tried it with a friend, Wendy to celebrate our birthdays and I ordered their Mango Salad and let me tell you.. it was HEAVENLY!!! I normally don't eat scallops but theirs was THE BOMB! it was DELICIOUS! I LOVE their dessert as well, their chocolate dessert was rich and creamy... mmm, yummy! Then last weekend I went in there with my boyfriend, and we ordered their Salt and Pepper calamari, garlic noodles and roasted crab... my oh my, it was REALLY good!  And their bartender, Peter was very nice and friendly.  He made my drink (Pinacolada) just the way I like it. :-D  I would definitely come back again in this restaurant... Now I know why this place is always packed.... their servings are so good! And not only that, I like the fact that after eating crabs the waiters/servers would give you a HOT (and I mean REALLY hot) damp towel to wipe your hands... I strongly recommend anyone to go to this place and try it themselves, it's worth the long line of waiting although they make up by serving your food faster and efficiently.", "author": "Christina Z."}

If you love Dungenous Crab then please step inside.  This place is simply the best place to get roasted crab in the world.  Much has been said about the priciness of the food, however, at market prices your looking at $36 bucks a crab.  Don't let the sticker shock keep you away because this place serves up some mighty huge crabs that will keep you quite full.  My wife and I brought a friend who wanted to explore the menu a bit during our last outing.  After being seated at a nice table in the upstairs area we had a couple of Grey Goose martinis before settling into the menu.  These were great drinks at $8.50 each.  Our friend wanted to try some appitizers so we went for the roasted mussels, the Salt and Pepper Calimari, and  fried prawns  and a couple of salads; the papaya and the Vietnamese house salad.  These were all good, however, on our next visit we agreed  that we would just go with the Vietnamese salad to get our palettes ready for the crab.  Of course we ordered the garlic noodles. One for order each person and when they were brought to the table just before the crab our friend said that perhaps we ordered too much !   Little did she know. Once the waitress came over with our plastic bibs we knew what was coming. Our friend had never had the crack it yourself kinda crab and was in for quite a shock when the waitress brough over three huge ~ like 3 lbs huge - crabs to our table.  The top shell was polished and is really for show as we pulled them off and gave them to the waitress before diving into some of the meatiest crabs that you'll ever have.  Once the crab was on our table it got quiet, real quiet as we each took the task of getting into that sweet crab meat.  Our friend had no problem cracking into those thick legs and before long was totally immersed in the picking out the meat. One bite into the garlic noodles did it for her as we all agreed that it was totally unique.  My wife and I have tried to find a similer place , like PPQ, but when all is said and done Thanh Long is still the high water mark when it comes to roasted crab in San Francisco or anywhere else for that matter.  The glow of a great meal stays with you long after you've paid the check.  And you can't say that for most resturants.", "author": "Nick C."}
