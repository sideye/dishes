I'm not sure whether it was just an off day for them or what but I really wasn't impressed with the food I received. \n\nI ordered their \"ultimate burger\", which is a cheese burger with avocado and bacon, and they served it to me on *white sandwich bread*. Did they run out of burger buns? I don't know, but when I got home and opened my takeout bag there it was, all the fixings of an ultimate burger: patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, bacon, avocado, and condiments sandwiched between two slices of what looked to me like wonderbread. \n\nWhite bread is much more thin and weak than a bun and accordingly the sandwich was soggy and within the first or second bite the whole \"burger\" just completely fell apart. Clearly there's a reason burgers are usually served on a bun: burgers are too greasy for sandwich bread.\n\nI'm guessing they just ran out of buns that day or something, but they should have at least told me and not just thrown together a burger on sandwich bread. The burger in their pictures is definitely on a sesame bun. What happened with my burger? \n\nOrdered garlic fries with the burger which were also very soggy.

It threw off the bun to meat ratio for the roommate. I didn't care as I didn't eat the bun, but get ready for a bready burger! The wings could have been a little meatier, but they were okay. The extra spicy ones weren't very spicy and the lemon pepper ones didn't have much flavor. And they were rather oily. My favorite part of this dish were the carrots and celery. Fresh and crunchy! The fish and chips were pretty good. Nice and crispy. And so were the garlic fries. The salad was pretty average.\n\nIt took us a while to remember that we also ordered a Chili cheese dog ($4.95) which was missing. I reported it to DoorDash and they gave me $5.38 in credit.

I used to live in SF, and I frequented an amazing Buffalo wing place as a kid. I don't remember the name of it, but I loved it... and the sign above the restaurant reminded me of that old restaurant so I chose to give this place a try.\n\nThe menu had quite a few options on it. You can get wings (of course), burgers, hot dogs, fries, and a few other various items. In the mood for wings, I went for the spicy Buffalo wings and the lemon pepper.\n\nI love my Buffalo wings when they have a great tangy taste. It can be spicy and hot, which is fine, but there has to be that unique tang associated with Buffalo wings. These wings were definitely tasty, but were just slightly lacking in what I wanted from a Buffalo wing. \n\nThe lemon pepper wings were on par with the Buffalo wings - they were pretty good, but not great. I wanted a little more intensity in both of these wings.\n\nSo while I did enjoy the meal, I wanted just a little more from this restaurant.\n\nI did like the size of the chicken wings. They are on the smaller size... but that was perfect. Some places use a gigantic steroidal chicken with huge meaty parts. I'm not a fan of that. Now, I don't know what kind of chickens this place uses, but I think they wing size is perfect.\n\nI also ordered some fresh chips to go along with my wings. The restaurant of my childhood offered fresh chips as well, so I had to get these. The chips here were very good, and I enjoyed them very much. It seems like the fries here get some very mixed reviews... just go for the chips!\n\nThe pricing at Buffalo Burger is good, and it beats many of the chain wing restaurants in this area.\n\nWould I come back to Buffalo Burger? If I were in the area and was in the mood for some wings... yes... I would. It's a good restaurant that delivers good food for a good price.", "author": "Luke C."}

The fries are amazing, a small size is actually pretty large, and you can tell they make them fresh because you can see the bucket full of fries soaking in water in the cooler.  Perfect amount of soft and crispy. Plus, malt vinegar! \n\nThe first time I tried the grilled cheese. Admittedly, I was a little underwhelmed.  Bread-to-cheese ratio was a little off.  The next time was Christmas Eve, and in this part of town everything had just shut down at about 9pm. I called, on the off chance they were open, and the guy who answered said he'd make my order if I ordered right then. Two veggie burgers, two fries.  Walked on down, and I felt so bad because clearly they were already closed. (Lights out, chairs on tables).  I was sooo happy he made my order for me, because he didn't have to.  The veggie burger is just a gardenburger I think, but at $5 or so each, the price is right.  Just now ordered the veggie philly cheese.  So good. Perfectly sauteed tofu, veggies, and cheese on a soft roll.  Perfect fries again.  I kind of hope the word doesn't get out because the prices are so low, it's almost unbelievable!", "author": "Sara R."}

She went online and found this place that looked decent, but the prices were too low. What the hell -- we decided to try it anyway because the \"health inspection\" score was so high. All that either of us ordered was  a hamburger with mushrooms and although they could have used a few more mushrooms, considering the low price, we were both shocked by how good these burgers were! Everything tasted very fresh and excellent quality. In this town, I can easily pay double the amount (I have) for a burger that won't be as good. So I'll be back. The place was clean and the guy at the counter was exceptionally nice. Excellent hamburger at low price in clean, pleasant surroundings. What more can you ask for?\n\nLooking at some of the reviews below, I can see complaints about some horrible person that used to man the counter. They've probably been fired by now.", "author": "Gary S."}

There is nothing fancy or gourmet about this place, they are just making delicious traditional burgers at a good price and executed to perfection.\n\nTHE ORDER - http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FEvO7R8w1BDTUp_WibR7NQ/l.jpg\n\nUltimate Burger with a Buffalo Patty - 4.5 out of 5 - Buffalo meat patty with bacon, avocado, grilled onions, 3 kinds of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, and mayonnaise on a super soft roll.  Wow old school burgers really don't get much better than this!!  The Buffalo itself was well cooked and perfectly seasoned.  It is balanced well with the other ingredients.  The avocado is great and works well with the smoke and saltiness of the bacon.  The grilled onions are great as well.  I ended up really taking my time with the burger, enjoying each and every single bit.  I really haven't had a no frills burger this good in a LONG time.  Much better than Bullshead on West Portal.\n\nGarlic Fries - 4 out of 5 - French fries are thick... not quite steak fries but more than regular ones.  They have a very nice crisp to them, probably twice fried.  There is a good amount of garlic topping on them (I actually wouldn't have minded a little more, but I LOVE garlic).  Very well done and it really just felt so \"San Francisco.\"\n\nOVERALL\n\nWonderful experience!  It's the best Buffalo burger I've had thus far.  I really can't wait to come again.", "author": "Rob P."}

It's a really well balanced burger.\n\nThe menu is big, so there is a little something for everyone. Although if you come and don't get a burger then you will be missing out. Wings are a great side addition here. \n\nGet the homemade chips instead of the fries.

I placed my order - Chicken Tenders with Garlic Fries (what they're known for and for $.50 extra) he cashier asked me for my name for the order and then proceeded to ask me how my day was; to be honest, I was having a shitty day so the cashier just asking me about my day made me a bit fuzzy, so I dropped in a dollar for the tip jar. \n\nUnfortunately, this good service was short-lived. When receiving my food, there was a miscommunication about what sauce I asked for when ordering (I thought I said BBQ, and was given Buffalo) but it was so petty I didn't mind paying an $.50. But then looked at my fries, and turns out it was regular fries when I ordered it with Garlic so the cashier decided it was okay to not charge me for the $.50 BBQ sauce.\n\nThe chicken tenders were really yummy and had a lot of chicken too - 3 normal but thick pieces cut in half, so 6 were present. The garlic fries though were all sorts of inconsistent - some were okay while others were cooked too long(so biting into them was dry, hard and took about one and a half second to eat since it was really hard), cooked too short, etc. The garlic after eating the whole my meal left a terrible after taste that you can't get rid of until much much later.\n\nI threw about 2/3 of my fries away. And not sure how to feel, but the other table had a little girl with her two parents(I'm just assuming) and was given ice cream for free  (that's sweet of the staff but made me feel a bit left out, perhaps maybe should've waited until a left to do that sort of stuff and maybe would've made more sense to provide me some since I was only given \"free\" but not really free BBQ sauce and forgot my order too) \n\nPerhaps I had given my tip too early - and lesson learned - wait until after my meal to dispense into the tip jar.", "author": "Yeanne L."}

I used to live down the street but I happened to be nearby for work on Saturday afternoon and wanted to take my associate for a nice treat. Neither of us had eaten all day so we were pretty hungry. We both got vanilla milkshakes. He ordered a chili burger. I used to love getting the fish & chips, decided to change it up and got a seafood combo with fish, prawn, oysters and scallops (my favorite!) The thick-cut sliced potatoes fried up crispy were super amazing. Then I took a bite of a scallop! It was extra firm and tasted a bit funny but since I hadn't been in so long, I thought maybe it was a seasoning they used. We had to get back on the road so I took most of my order to-go and ate the rest of my delicious meal while we were driving. A couple hours later, my belly was full of gas and I was burping up foul sulphur nastiness which continued well into the next day. I don't know what exactly caused my body to react that way but I suspect a scallop a few days past its prime. :( I wanted to alert the staff in case more people had the scallops so I tried calling but the mailbox is full.

Buffalo Burger is located in the center of the Richmond District right across the street from that Blockbuster on Geary. \n\n[W] When you walk in, you can get a big whiff of food being cooked on the grill. As you decide what to eat from their menu, don't forget to ask for buffalo meat if you want it. Of course there's an extra charge for that as well. Mona wanted to get that option but I totally forgot to mention it during our order, especially since it was written clearing smack dab in the middle in bold lettering haha. \n\n[M] The buffalo meat would have been a better option but anyway, we shared a Supreme Burger [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Nvc1XZVJZhp2CHbh_hTLUw?select=2qBog85o7hAXqw6i3o0qCg] and an order of 9 lemon-pepper wings which comes with some veggie sticks on the side. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Nvc1XZVJZhp2CHbh_hTLUw?select=CKok9TWhauWGVRoQ5FXgzg ]Your meal includes a drink from their fridge as well so feel free to grab yourself a can of juice or whatever you like. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Nvc1XZVJZhp2CHbh_hTLUw?select=-3bfXJubDAjn1LHmvh4hMw]\n\nThe burger is made to however you want it to be cooked. We like ours medium rare and they cook the meat here perfectly. The only part that sucked about Wayne's burger was that it didn't come with a traditional bun and the juices from the meat were soaking through. \n\n[W] In my opinion, when you have the perfect burger, it has to come with a perfect unsaturated bun as well. Otherwise I'm just eating a slab of meat and wet bread... bleh. \n\nThe Lemon-pepper wings came right after the burger. Honestly, this didn't satisfy our palettes. I literally could've done a whole lot better job but I just wanted to compare this to Wingstops' lemon-pepper wings. Wingstop wins hand-down. Basically the wings were just fries and lemon juice was just squeezed all over along with pepper on top. The wings were too sour and again it's just something I could've done.\n\nOne disturbing thing about this place is that the guy that works there, probably the owner, was just chilling near the front door and watching the TV that was right above our heads from where we were sitting. I say it was disturbing because I can see at the corner of my eye that he kept staring at us. I was like WTF man! When the TV is bolted to the wall above our heads, normally your head is looking up to see the screen but she was just staring at us. That made me feel really uncomfortable but whatever, we just ate our food and tried to ignore that. \n\nAnyways if you come here during a weekend, good luck finding parking around this neighborhood because it seems like everyone's family including their baby and dog has a vehicle. That's the only thing that sucks when parking in the city is that there's one too many vehicles per household and they hog up all the parking. I would try this place again just to taste something else. Hopefully the guy won't be staring at us otherwise it'll just face my chair towards him and stare at him too haha.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-18", "description": "On my solo adventure to SF yesterday, I decided to have a meal here. It was quite the gamble because I don't normally go for American food. My typical food choices would be; Korean, Vietnamese, or Thai.\n\nAfter much deliberation and yelping near the Golden Gate, I decided to go for something different 'cause I had garlic fries on my mind. I also love chicken wings so I figured it was worth a shot. I ended up taking a few minutes to think about it since I never looked at the menu.. to then again stick with my original plan because it would have taken me forever otherwise...\n\nI went with a small order (1.95) of garlic fries and a 6 pc chicken wings (4.95) with spicy teriyaki sauce. I had forgotten my wallet in my car, so they were nice enough to make the food as I went to retrieve it. I decided to sit in the back corner and one of the cooks actually brought the food to my table. \n\nGood amount for the price. The spicy teriyaki was actually teriyaki and buffalo sauce together. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either; I'm not a fan of buffalo sauce TBH. I have this thing where I eat my chicken wings with 2 forks because I don't like getting my fingers all dirty, but I had to this time because the plastic forks were weak... Picked the meat off of all of them before eating for convenience, and leaving them to be drenched in the sauce was a bad idea... because I knew my salt intake was taking a sharp spike. I think that the chicken could have been cooked a little less because it was a bit on the dry side. The garlic fries were good, but I would have liked it if there was more of the garlic goodness. Even so, can't complain for the price.\n\nI honestly don't know if I'm going to make another stop here. That is a possibility if I decide to take someone if I'm in the area and we don't feel like the other options on Geary. If I do, I would probably go for a burger or a grilled cheese... or something.", "author": "Nga C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-01", "description": "First review I've ever written because I don't usually feel strongly enough about an establishment to write one.\n\nGood food. Of course, I had fish 'n chips so that's hard to mess up. Girlfriend approved of her supreme burger and I liked their fries--reasonably thick but still quite crispy. This alone would've been worth at least four stars to me, and it wouldn't have been easy to drop any lower. \nHowever, the not-so-gentleman/woman (for lack of definite identification) behind the register found a way to be the rudest, least helpful person in any food service establishment I've been to as far as my memory can take me. The interesting thing is that he/she didn't seem to be actively trying to come across as an employee that made me want to spit into their tip jar. \nMaybe you can decide for yourself:\n-Girlfriend and I approached the register and she began ordering her burger. He/she didn't bother looking up or making eye contact with either of us as my girlfriend was ordering, so there was never any confirmation that he/she ever heard anything she said until he/she finally said, \"Is that it?\"\n-I attempted to strike up some conversation with some questions about some items I was interested in ordering. I asked about the size of the fish pieces in their fish 'n chips and immediately received the answer, \"Don't know.\" Am I the first person in the city to have ordered this? Is this your first day? Not the best impression for your first day, so I imagine you're just not interested in being helpful in the least. There are other jobs for people with your level of customer service expertise, you know. I can suggest a job in advertising. A job involving some sort of edible-animal suit and a spinning arrow with a restaurant name on it.\n-I also tried to order a banana shake, and before I even finished, received another flat-toned, unenthusiastic response, \"No ice cream.\"\n-Before we got our food, he/she was cleaning a table up after some other customers didn't dispose of their trash by the door before leaving. He/she was very openly expressing his/her annoyance aloud to...no one in particular. Understandable, so sure, continue to enlighten us to how much you hate your job that you are incredibly ill-suited for.\n-After this, he/she brought us our food and tossed our baskets onto our table and basically ordered us, \"Make sure you throw your trash away when you're done.\" I responded, \"Sure!\" Naturally, it's obvious to throw your trash away when there's a trash can right by the door. And of course I would. But if I wanted to follow General He/She's orders, I'd join the military. But I didn't. I came to be served food.\n-Last one: As we were eating, a man came in and appears to have ordered what appeared to have been a shake, evidenced by he/she pulling out a large tub and scooping something into the metal container that milkshakes are mixed in. Wow, you guys must restock fast.\n\nIn conclusion, would come back again for the food. Oh boy, just tried a bite of my girlfriend's leftovers. Definitely want to come back to try some burgers. As long as it is during this lovely gentleman/woman's shift and I get to spit into the tip jar before leaving.\n\nNote: I don't mean to sound particularly insensitive about his/her sexual identity, and my problem is entirely about his/her attitude for the entirety of our encounter in this restaurant. My use of both male/female pronouns throughout this review is not meant to be insulting in any way, but merely to indicate that I was legitimately unsure of whether he/she would identify him/herself as a male or a female, and wished to be respectful of either scenario.", "author": "Kriz K."}

Fish and chips were deliciously crispy, served with tartar sauce but I preferred the malt vinegar that was provided on the table. French fries were definitely made in house, not the precut prepackaged frozen ones you get at other places; these were legit - golden crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

They were huge.  The bun was typical of the mass produced kind, complete with the smattering of sesame seeds.  But it was topped the way I like it:  two large slices of tomato, a ring of spicy red onions, two pickles and a leaf of iceberg lettuce.  I asked for a side of mayo, because that's just the kind of gal I am.  Not to mention, I like to dip my french fries in that creamy goodness.  The hamburger, slightly more medium to well done, was actually very tasty once I spruced it up with the mayo.  Our french fries were rough cut, with the skin still apparent.  Thick sticks of starchy hot delights.  As I took bites here and there, I noticed that once we were eating more people were actually taking the time to look in.  Perhaps the tables had been turned?\n\nTo cut any sort of silence between bites there is a flat screen on the wall.  At a point in time where my eyes darted to the screen, one player had two of a kind, Jacks.  By the time the flop was laid out, another Jack lay on the table.  Nice.  Three of a kind.  He won that hand, all in.\n\nI also ordered a soft drink which includes free refills for dine in customers.  Our tab was around $13 with tax.  Not bad for the two of us and enough to somewhat dull the muddled senses from the cop movie marathon.  Casual and quick, good for the late night munchies run.  Next time the buffalo wings will be my order.  I'm not comfortable to gnaw on a bone in front of my date yet  ;o)", "author": "Miika M."}

For example:\nMe: How was your day bra?\nHim: Busy...I went to school to print out some pictures then scouted some places for shoots...o btw...Buffalo Burger is so good\n\nThis abrupt shift in tangents leave me floored and flummoxed at the same time.  Buffalo Burger has also been a Richmond staple since I was a kid, however, I never had the urge to go...until yesterday at the request of lil Twist.  Walking in, this place seems to be the headquarters for many a characters.  There was a group of high schoolers taking up a couple tables playing cards, some couples in a booth enjoying NCAA and this boss elderly man craning his neck and speaking his order literally .5 inches away from the cashier's face then going outside to smoke a huge cigar.   Lil Twist and I ordered the philly cheesesteaks to go and when we got home, had trouble removing said sandwiches from the paper trey.  Philly cheesesteaks are messy by nature, but this was over the top messy.  Once I was able to remove half and take a bit, all the ingredients tumbled out.  There was a generous splay of beef, cheese, mushrooms, onions and bell peppers however, it just tasted bad.  The beef was sweet like it was marinated in teriyaki sauce.  In addition, the consistency of the beef was like mush.  It was soft to a point of 0_0 (wtf face).  We resorted to eat our sandwich with a spoon.  The cheesesteak tasted nothing like one should and was probably the worst I've eaten.  The sweet beef was just not cool.  Basically, if you come here ordering a philly cheeseteak, be prepared to get philly cheese soup.  \n\nOn another note, I don't want to bash this place completely.  Because this place is named Buffalo Burger, perhaps it should have been wise to order a burger, their named specialty.  It could be that I just ordered an item they are not known for, which is not an excuse on their part.  I will try this place one more time before I desist from biting my tongue.  Btw, they serve homemade potato chips which I do want to try.  This is the first place where Fish 'n Chips truly mean just that.", "author": "Brian V."}

My friend lived right by it (I live near it too now) and said he didnt like the cheesesteak there cuz it was hella messy. (actually i dont think he used the word \"hella\", thats just my brain translating, he's from Massachusetts)\n\nI got take out and much to my surprise it was one of the neatess least messiest cheesesteaks id ever seen. So i didnt understand what he was talking about\n\nUntil the other day I had another one there. The guy served me the cheesesteak with a fork, that gave a hint. The sandwich for some reason this time fell apart nearly immediately. They use colombo rolls which are tasty (but small), wonder if they used a different one before.\n\nNow to the actual taste...beside it falling apart super easily..the steak seems to have been marinated in some sort of sauce, similar to terriyaki or another japanese sweetish salty sauce. At first this sauce is tasty but as I predicted it gets old real quick. Besides real cheesesteak's steak should not be marinated or sauced, only lightly seasoned with salt pepper etc.\n\nSo the cheese steak is edible, but def not traditional and def not that great. \n\nI will not have another cheesesteak here again, though I'm interested to try their buffalo wings, they have many flavors. \n\nThe man who runs the front of the restaurant is very good with cleaning up and making sure the restaurant is in order, which is nice when you are serving such greasy ass foodz.

So the good thing was that they had onion rings, but it was $2.95 for a side of them which you can see in the pic I uploaded.  Then the ranch was another $0.50 as well -  that was a bit high it seemed, but I know how you have to maximize things as a small biz.\n\nThe burger itself was decent, but a bit oily and I guess when it's a thinner patty it's hard to get one that's actually medium rare as it was cooked much more thoroughly than MR.\n\nI think post-hangover this place would be better than just a straight up lunch/meal..", "author": "Gene X."}

Open until 10 every night, including Sundays.\n\nWhat it is: A dive burger bar with a huge selection of heart-attack.  \nWhat it isn't: Expensive.  Also- not cuisine.  But it's not as though they are pretending to be fine dining.\n\nThings you should try: \n\nGet some friends and split a 50 rack of wings.  They'll happily split the wings into at least 2 different flavors, and they came w/ all the condiments (ranch/blue).  The spicy wings were excellent and vinegary like a good buffalo sauce should be.  The lemon-pepper were good, but a bit greasy.  At the bulk rate of 50 wings, it comes out to be about 50 cents a wing. \n\nThe garlic fries should come with a warning that you'll be sweating garlic for the next day and a half.  Fries still retain their crisp shell while holding thick clumps of garlic.  A-mazing.\n\nThe Philly Cheese Steak is a mess, but the juices from the steak-chop combined with the onions and molten cheese is divine.\n\nI would pass on the Onion Rings.  They were passable, but nothing special and for the price I'd rather get the Garlic Fries every time.    \n\nThe best part: you can stuff your face for less than 10 bucks every time and leave hating yourself and checking to see if your gym membership is still in effect.", "author": "Richard Y."}

The answer to this question for the mushroom burger was a resounding yes.\n\nIf I still have time to consider the burger, I compare it to a Carl's Jr. burger and decide which one I would rather have.  Almost immediately, my taste buds pined for a six dollar burger over the one I was currently occupied with.\n\nThe burgers are mostly under 5 dollars, making it attractive for a cheap, on-the-go meal, but I would not revisit this place unless I were desperate.", "author": "Andrew M."}

The batter was nice and crisp, but I try to avoid eating too much of it.  The tartar sauce was AWESOME.  The fries is also AWESOME.  I also ordered a teriyaki shrimp with rice plate.

It's just rice with cabbage, carrots, shrimp all slathered in teriyaki sauce.  \n\nNext time I'd try the buffalo shrimp or something with hot sauce.  \n\nFive stars from me, but probably 3.5 from my husband.

I try to avoid burgers as much as I can, because, well, burgers don't go well with cholesterol medication.\n\nThis place was very different than I remembered.  Old dinky chairs and tables gave way to clean, efficient vinyl benches.  The interior looks cheap, just like a neighborhood burger place interior should, but tidy and even inviting.  There are about 8 tables in the whole place.  A plasma TV on the wall was the main attraction.  The patrons, patiently waiting for their burgers to arrive, tried their darnedest to feign interest in the Olympics crew competition.\n\nI don't know why I didn't order the buffalo burger, but I didn't.  I ordered a bacon and mushroom burger with Swiss cheese.  My friend ordered a mushroom burger with no cheese, and we split a basket of fries.  All this, with 2 cans of soda, cost less than $14.  That's really cheap, folks.\n\nIt took us a while to get our burger, but it was worth it.  Piled high on top of a slightly toasted bun were fresh veggies, quality Swiss cheese and slightly overcooked bacon.  The burger itself was a bit overcooked, but I suppose I should have asked them to cook it medium.\n\nOverall, good, solid neighborhood place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get a burger here.

I would say that it was nothing overwhelming, but it was tastey and cheaper than Bills down the way. The burger patty was a little thinner than optimal, but they tried to get the burger to medium rare as requested; almost. If you were to come back and get the combo (with fries order crisy) you would not feel cheated at all. Over the In-N-Out line? No.  But tasty. 6.5/10 \n\nBurger: Quarter inch, thinner than I like. Much more medium than medium rare. \nBun: Typical white bun, but grilled (Nice Touch)\nToppings: The cheddar didn't have the bite of a gourmet place, but their grilled onions were good.\nSides: No fries this time, but they are steak fries and quite good if ordered crispy.\nSidenote: I had a revelation about this whole burger list process as I was chowing down to my Buffalo Burger Burger... Cue Revelation: There are quickly developing two classes of burger on my list; the larger than 1/4 inch patty, and not. This is important as it is nearly impossible to cook a 1/4\" patty to perfectly medium rare... And thus the division line above and below In-N-Out on my list.", "author": "Matt C."}

Strictly speaking about taste, my spicy buffalo burger and garlic fries seemed like they had the right ingredients, but it's hard to make a good determination when the food shows up cold. Obviously my burger and fries sat somewhere for awhile before I received it. Sorry, that's a pet pieve of  mine. I order hot food. I expect hot food. Besides that, the fries tasted stale. Not sure if that's because they weren't hot, but it just seemed like they weren't made fresh, as if the whole garlic fries mixture was pre-cooked.

Seemed like there was no care into cooking the wings, just cook the chicken, dump sauce and take it to the table.

Personnel are always friendly and very nice to us. They are always interested in our opinion about wings. and lately they have even started giving us extra wings just because we are regulars. Also, the location is perfect for us. Since we are a russian couple we are able to visit all the russian stores on Geary before we grab some wings.", "author": "Margaryta M."}

The burger was excellent and one of the best I've had anywhere. The potato salad was pretty good and though it couldn't possibly compete with my mom's killer potato salad, it was much better than most of the potato salads I've tried at various delis throughout the city. They also are very generous with their portions and their prices are super reasonable. They have a fantastic menu and offer everything from burgers to wings to fish and chips to teryaki bowls and salads.

This restaurant use to be on Union St. between Columbus and Powell.  When I finally fell in love with hot sauce and spicy foods at 9 years old, this place was my haven.  So I found out they moved out to the Richmond district, and I finally stopped by to check it out.  I ordered 26 wings, extra spicy, and got my siblings all a vanilla shake.  When the wings arrived, I took a whiff, my nasal hairs probably all burned off.  My clogged nasal passages suddenly became clear.  I picked up my first wings and sucked the meat off it.  Took a sip of my soda and then, my tongue was on fire.  My lips felt like they plumped up with collagen.  I could barely talk cuz I couldn't move my tongue.  I wanted to eat more, but I had to stop after consuming half.  I was in pain, but oh was it worth it.  I am a hardcore buffalo wings fan and if you love'em too, to stop by and see what you're missing.  They serve burgers, Philly cheese steaks, and typical sides, but I don't care about any of that other stuff.  I felt like a kid again when I was here.

The restaurant is TINY--a true \"mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall\" establishment.  Even if diners squeezed in like sardines, I'd estimate that the restaurant could only accommodate 10 to 12 people at most.  In terms of decor, this place absolutely has nothing to offer.  It is truly a grease pit.  You can just feel the grease that the walls have absorbed over the years.  Needless to say, my expectations were quite low.  I only ordered a cheeseburger (although, reading the previous reviews, I now wish I had ordered some fries or chips).  It was fabulous.  The patty was 1/3 lb. and had a slight gamey flavor (enough to make it interesting, but not enough to make it over-powering).  (I generally don't like things that taste gamey.)  The cheese, which was a slice of American, was nicely melted onto the patty and had a nice, sharp milky/salty finish.  My favorite part, though, was the bun, which was yellow and sesame-seeded.  The texture of the bun was perfect:  it was soft enough to chew (not like a baguette bun or a ciabatta bun, which you have to work on), but firm enough to maintain a nice, spongy texture (not like some breads that crumble when you eat them).  The best part of it all was that my cheeseburger was under $5!  Fabulous price performance.  I'm definitely heading back for some fries and chips.", "author": "Sophrosyne Y."}

The fish and chips was ok.  The chips not so great, but the fish was crisp, moist and overall not bad.  We also had an order of the chili cheese fries.  Again, the chili cheese was good, but the fries were a disappointment.  The fries was too try and none of that oily fries taste, so it doesn't even taste like a fry.
