We had dinner on Thursday, August 23rd around 6:15pm. Not sure if she got takeout or delivery, but I believe it was delivery.\n\n*Angel Wings: Fried chicken wings with sweet garlic sauce and crispy basil ($11)\n*Tom Yum Chicken Soup: Spicy and sour soup with onions and mushrooms ($10)\n*Pad See You: Pan-fried flat rice noodles with broccoli, eggs, and garlic, Chicken ($12)\n*Crab Meat Fried Rice: Pan-fried rice with crab meat, egg, and onions ($14)\n*Eggplant: With Japanese eggplant and bean sauce, Served with Chicken $12)\n*String Bean Tofu: Sauteed crispy outer layer tofu with string beans and homemade spicy sauce, Hot and spicy, Vegetarian ($11)\n\nI didn't have anything to do with the ordering, but I believe we had the items above. (I found the prices online.) The crab fried rice had a good amount crab. And a nice salty savoriness to it. I'm a huge basil fan, so I was happy the wings and eggplant came with a good amount of basil. I'm big on veggies, so I enjoyed the string bean tofu. Plus, the green beans retained a nice crunch. I believe we ordered everything mild, so I added sambal to my plate to give the dishes some heat. I do love my spice.\n\nGreat option for Thai delivery if you live in the Chinatown area.", "author": "Elena N."}

Unfortunately, I either ordered the wrong dishes because the dishes I got were an expensive mistake!\n\nWhat I ordered:\nRed Curry with chicken ($13) - this dish was very rich with coconut milk and it had a strong flavor which I attributed to not just the curry but alot of salt (eeck!). The dish just had tons of bamboo strips and maybe a couple of pieces of basil. No other vegetable in this dish which made it very boring.\n\nSauteed Mixed Vegetables with Polk ($12) - trying to be healthy? Well this dish had baby corn, cabbage, onions, zucchini, carrot bits, green beans, bean sprouts and small oblong strips of pork in a brown sauce. When I opened the take out container most of the veggies were really limp. Eating some of this dish, I thought it tasted somewhat odd 'cause it was super sweet like there was tons of sugar in that sauce making it inedible after a while.\n\nWith these two entrees I got one order of jasmine rice ($2) and one order of brown rice ($2.75). Personally, I enjoyed the texture of the latter much more because it has some bite to it; whereas the jasmine rice is small grain and has a refined texture that really has a too soft mouth feel for me.\n\nOverall, I was highly disappointed by my entrees from Thai Spice. With a total cost of $33 for dinner and bad tasting food sadly I'm not likely to order from them again. :(", "author": "Joanna T."}

We had made reservations a few days prior for a 6:15pm dinner. The first few things I noticed when making a reservation at this place is that the employees are super chill. Some restaurants we checked out previously denied us because we weren't willing to pay the minimum amount per person or that they didn't take reservations. But the person I talked to on the phone easily booked us for Friday evening.\n\nThe restaurant itself is super quaint and the environment is extremely peaceful and romantic. Even on a Friday night, the place was relatively empty and I felt like we had the place all to ourselves. The lighting was dim and the seating arrangements were comfortable.\n\nSince we had a huge party, we pretty much ordered all over the place. We started with several appetizers (Chicken Sate, Roti, Spring Rolls) and went bonkers on the main dishes (Eggplant, tofu, more tofu, Pad Thai, Crab Fried Rice, etc.). It was hard to track how good each dish was, but from a very neutral perspective, I thought that everything tasted fine and we had an amazing time. \n\nIn short, I found that the service was decent - the waitresses left our party alone to indulge - and the food was very delicious.

You know that scene in Elf when Will Ferrell has pasta with syrup? It was like that.\n\nWhat's super-bizarro is that the waitress stopped by to see if everything was alright, and I told her it wasn't. She said, \"oh, the soup is too sour?\" And I said, \"no, it's way too sweet.\" I told her I didn't want it replaced. (We were on our way to a concert and even if it had been replaced, that wouldn't have fixed the rubber  chicken problem.)\n\nThe spinach/tofu/peanut sauce dish was edible, but it was literally a pile of steamed spinach next to a pile of fried tofu next to a bowl of peanut sauce that had the consistency of McDonald's mcnugget sauce.

Mostly because it is located one block away from home, it is open late (Mon-Fri till 10 pm... waddup!) and it appreciates take out/delivery orders. \n\nThai is a cuisine that just blends so well after a hard day's work... I don't know why, but it just tastes better from Monday to Friday after 6 pm. Maybe that's just me. \n\nAnyways, I enjoy ordering from here because the people are friendly and the portions are sizable. As for the taste, though, it's okay at best.\n\nI normally for the Chicken Pad Thai or the Chicken Fried Rice because I'm not adventurous when all I seek is a satisfying meal after work. Both dishes come in large portions and don't feel too greasy like some other Asian takeout in the region. However, they do smother their dishes with lemongrass, which I'm not particularly crazy for.\n\n3 stars because the prices are slightly jacked up for what you're getting and Modern Thai down the street definitely tops this place when it comes to Thai cuisine.

Golden Tofu- this was alright, you had to smother it with the sauce it came with in order to eat it.....or it was just dry fried tofu\n\n2.

This is a casual Thai dining experience with not a lot in terms of ambiance wow factor, however, what it lacks in the \"mood setting,\" it makes up for in price.\n\nIn other words, for the money, this is a good pragmatic weekday choice when you and significant other are facing the typical dialogue dilemma: \n\n\"What do you want to eat?\"  SO 1\n\"I don't know, what do you feel like?\" SO2\n\"How about a burger?\" SO1\n\"Nah, not unless you want to be a chubby chaser.\" SO2\n\nSo problem solved!  Go to Thai Spice.\n\nAs for what I had -- I typically default to Pad Thai...not always, but usually.  I was fascinated with the \"Green Papaya Pad Thai\" because I had never come across it before and not being the brightest guy thought it had chunks of Papaya in the Pad Thai.  The server patiently explained to me that instead of egg noodles, they simply replace them with \"green papaya noodles,\" which I thought was interesting.  I ordered it with chicken.\n\nGreen Papaya Pad Thai is served in a reasonable time-frame, attentive servers.  Pad Thai comes with chopped peanuts and bean sprouts on the side.  As the server explained, it definitely had a sweet sour flavor to it that I thought was delicious!  It left me feeling full, but not overly.  The consistency of the noodles was on the crunchy side which I hadn't experienced before.  Consider 'not completely done' spaghetti squash and that's probably the texture.  It really was good.\n\nAll in all a very good experience and I'll be back on the weekday soon to have more of the menu items and report back.", "author": "Jordan R."}

Food is not scary spicy here ( I wish it was but it wasn't even when we ordered extra Thai hot)\n2. There is no parking validation.\n\nWe ordered Tom Kha soup and it was a little too tart for my taste. The flavors were all there but the overwhelming tartness is the only thing we could notice. The spicy Fried rice was okay but a bit too lumpy for my taste and also had no veggies except for basil. It tasted pretty good but wasn't spicy.\n\nThe Red curry, though not super spicy was the best dish. The curry was thick and creamy and the flavors are balanced. Overall this place is an okay place. The portion size is decent, the food is flavorful albeit a bit tame.  One overriding theme of this place is big chunks of Tofu... I think if they were sliced a bit smaller/thinner in all the dishes, they would have absorbed some of the flavors.\n\n\n Like every place in the city, parking is the one reason why I might not visit this place again.. Apart from the restaurant tab and 20% tip, you have to spend $10 more for parking...I feel that's a bit much.", "author": "Ravi C."}

The garlic rice was absolutely not even worth talking about. At all. It was so heavy on the garlic that it was pretty much inedible. The roti prata was delicious, but absolutely not worth $7. Literally one piece of bread that wasn't much better than the stuff I can pick up at my local Asian market, and I can get 5 of those for $2. Jeez...\n\nI am actually never going to order anything from here again. How can you even mess up garlic rice? Overpriced food does not make happy times. It feels like the appetizers are the only things that won't be over-flavored (yes, there's bland, there's perfect, and there's \"I think this is how spices work so let's just add all the spices that should totally work!\"), but it's way too overpriced to make it worthwhile.

Roasted and glistening golden orange, the duck was presented on a bed of satay spinach, surrounded by boiled broccoli.  The dish also came with sweet soy sauce which tasted beautifully on the duck and really enhanced the honey flavors.  The portions were large.  The presentation of the dish artistic to a level I didn't expect from a Thai restaurant off of Polk.  \n\nAlthough the country style thai fish was good, it wasn't memorable.  The fish was fried whole (bones, head, and all).  Although this is how fish is traditionally cooked in Asia, it might be a little difficult for some of you to eat.  In addition, the fish meat itself was tough and overcooked.  The simplicity of the dish (literally fried fish with salt with two sauces for dipping on the side), the fact that it was hard to eat, and wasn't made particularly well means I won't be ordering it again.\n\nLove,\nFei", "author": "Fei L."}

It is an epic fail. It is worst than high school kids at McD's with no experience. I have tried to use the coupons they flood our building/mailboxes  with and only been successful with redeeming them half the time (even when mentioning the coupon at the beginning, middle, and end of my phone call, when the driver arrives he just claims there is no record of it on the receipt and therefore the coupon is nonredeemable). \n\nA few weeks ago I placed an order through Seamless with them and of three items, one was totally wrong (instead of eggplant with tofu, I got pad thai with pork). It was past their closing time when I got my order so when I called I didn't want to make a big fuss about it and asked them to just issue me a credit for next time. An older woman told me that the credit would be in their computer system and that as long as I gave my name/phone number/address, whomever took the order should be able to find the credit. About a week later I went into the restaurant to eat, I tried to use my credit and was told I wouldn't be able to use it for dining in. Um, weird, but ok. Fast forward to today, when I called for a delivery order and tried to use my credit and the girl on the other end of the line said there was no record of my credit and that there was no manager available to speak to and that if she gave me the credit the fee would come out of her paycheck. WTF?!\n\nLuckily Seamless customer service is awesome and they're going to argue with the owner on my behalf and get my refund. \n\nThai Spice, I have a couple of questions for you:\n1. Why waste time and hundreds of dollars in printing  fees to print coupons if you're going to make it nearly impossible to use the coupons.\n2. Why lie to me about the ease of using a credit based on your obvious mistake when I was doing you a favor by not making your kitchen staff stay late to remake a dish.\n3. Do you really think your food is that much better than Lemongrass and Modern Thai and Sai Jai that you can treat your local customers so poorly and still stay in business?! It really isn't. \n\nSome of your dishes are somewhat comparable to Lemongrass or Modern Thai (but Lemongrass has better Tom Yum soup and the chicken basil dish is better at Modern Thai) but your customer service is severely deficient , compared to either, and you really just don't even come close to Sai Jai for intensity of flavor.", "author": "Dani D."}

All the entrees are very reasonably priced, most of them ranging between $12-18.   The plating is BEAUTIFUL, it is what you would expect to see at a much higher priced restaurant. You can tell that great care is taken in preparing the food.  This was especially apparent in the fresh spring rolls we ordered.  Many places will throw ingredients together in these and as a result, the flavor will be unevenly distributed and the rolls will easily fall apart.  Not true here.  The spring rolls were rolled very tightly and you could taste a little bit of everything in each bite.  \n\nOur entrees were also delicious.  We ordered the Som tum, Mango tofu, barbecue beef, Vegetable delight, and Tom Ka.  The highlight was definitely the Tom ka.  Our party of four was all over it and I think the whole pot dissapeared in about 5 minutes.  I was only sad that we forgot to specify which heat intensity we preferred when we ordered so it was served very mild.  This was actually my complaint with all the dishes.  Everything tasted much too mild and \"Americanized\".  This was our first visit so we didn't think to ask for more heat.  The wait staff should remember to ask customers' preference upon ordering.  Other than this issue, the food was very delicious and fresh, the atmosphere was relaxing and our waitress was sweet and courteous. Definitely recommend!", "author": "Elisa F."}

It was only slightly spicy. There were no whole chilis. There could also have been more depth to the flavors but it was pretty good. From the description I did not expect the chicken to be minced. However, that is not necessarily their fault. I am not a fan of the texture of minced chicken. There was also the usual cucumber salad. It was refreshing.\n\nChicken Satay - This was a basic chicken satay. A little on the dry side. The peanut sauce was average. Delivery was prompt, professional, and polite. I will order again and try other dishes.\n\nI may eat here again. I think it would be worth trying some of their other dishes.

The eggplant dish is a particular standout.\n\nThe service is very fast and they are friendly.  If you're making subs or changes in your order, they may push back on you.  My friend likes to sub salmon for the prawns in her eggplant dish, and 9/10 times they tell her they can't do that but we remind them that they do it every time and then it's fine.\n\nI've ordered delivery from them once and the food was a little cold, so I haven't since ordered delivery from them again.", "author": "Caitlin T."}

I called the next morning and told them about the problem.  Chon took my contact info. and said the manager would call me back the next day when he's in.  Never heard back.  I called Thurs. morning and spoke to the manager (Ken?) and he was so rude.  He said I was supposed to call that night.  I said the restaurant was closed, so I called the next morning.  He acknowledged that he got my message, yet still didn't call me back.  He said no refund or credit for next time.  I told him my family has been in the restaurant business for 25 years and you just don't treat regular customers this way.  He didn't seem to care about losing regular customers or that I was going to post up a bad review on Yelp.  He said you do what you gotta do!

It was mostly potatoes, pumpkin, and chicken, and especially the chicken wasn't cut up small enough.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-16", "description": "I work at SF General Hospital. Today we decided to order Thai food for lunch.\nYAY THAI FOOD! \nThe food we received was not what we expected. About 10 people ordered. \nWhen we first started eating, everyone was saying \"This is okay\"...yet squirting Rooster Sauce on everything (Rooster Sauce that we provided)\nWe LOVE LOVE LOVE the person who suggested that we order from Thai Spice, so we didn't want to hurt her feelings because we didn't like her choice; however as our lunch hour progressed, the truth came out. No one was wild about the food. A lot of us thought it was awful. \nWhy this restaurant is called Thai Spice is a mystery, as the overall #1 complaint was that the food had no flavor. I ordered Yellow Curry with pumpkin and chicken. I specified \"Hot\". Sure, I didn't go for \"Thai Hot\", but I expected some amount of burn. I had to add multiple squirts of Rooster Sauce to my food. The curry itself was very disappointing: shredded chicken, 8 squares of squash and two chunks of potato (in a quart container of curry). There were no other ingredients. Yes, those were the ingredients that were listed on the menu description, but I'm used to menus listing the main ingredients, but having other elements as well... such as a leaf of basil perhaps? A slice of pepper or onion?. The curry flavor was more of an indian curry type flavor than a thai curry flavor. The curry was like a creamy mulligatawny soup. It was okay. I ate some of it, but it wasn't THAI CURRY. \nOne person got Cashew Chicken. The chicken was fried, so fried that it might as well have been bits of deep fried breading, because that's what it tasted like. Our guess was that it must have been fried, gotten cold, and refried. \nAnother co-worker got beef something, I don't know what the name of the dish was on the menu, but she said that it basically was hamburger over rice. No flavor. \nA similar complaint was made by the person that ordered basil chicken. He said it tasted like ground turkey. Period. \nThe Silver Noodle Soup was declared to taste like hot water with cabbage in it. There were two prawns. The Tom Ka soup was okay. But again, it contained only the ingredients listed on the menu. Onions, chicken, mushrooms. In my mind there should have been a bit of lemon grass and/or ginger floating about, perhaps some cilantro sprinkled on top? \nThe real kicker was Peanut Dressing Salad. Iceberg lettuce, sliced cucumber, a hardboiled egg and A STACK OF PRINGLES POTATO CHIPS on the side (the menu did say potato chips). The dressing was thick and sticky, like a dipping sauce for satay or possibly an eggroll. It was good... but not as a salad dressing. \nWe didn't understand why the fresh spring rolls had prawns AND \"imitation crab meat\" in them. Why? Unnecessary. Why put something fake on something that is delicious? \nWe teased and harassed our co-worker for the rest of the shift. She never, ever, again gets to pick where we order from.\nThe amazing thing about this order was that NO ONE liked their food. Usually most people are happy with what we decide to order. Sometimes people say that they wouldn't order from ___ again, but never before have we spent the rest of the afternoon cracking up about how bad lunch was. \nI have read other reviews about Thai Spice which report that this place is hit or miss.\nI guess we missed.

Life is tough.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the pricing of Thai Spice's menu, the portion sizes, and the speed of the food preparation. Plus, the decor was tolerably hip (i.e. not a club like Osha but not like being in some old lady's living room where you think you're going to break one of her religious artifacts). I had the vegetarian pad thai, which probably could have had a few more vegetables thrown in for good measure, but the flavors were delicious. And the dish was served with bean sprouts on the side, which are important to munch on when you've been stuffing your face with noodles. My friend had the green curry and gave it her stamp of approval. And we shared the spring rolls--you know, those awesome refreshing ones with the clear wrapping and the mint and the... I'm salivating--which I think I might consider getting several orders of for my next meal. \n\nI do have a few complaints, though. One, the waiter took forever to bring us our check. Like 10 minutes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-13", "description": "When I used to live in Russian Hill, Thai Spice's delivery service was probably a 2 star experience.  However, for a sit down meal, they are very attentive.  In the few times I've been here now, there haven't been a ton of people sitting in the restaurant.  One of my best friends lives around the corner from Thai Spice, so this is always an easy meal for us.  I've had their Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, and both dishes come exactly as they're typically served in Thai restaurants here.  Both of us usually order a Fresh Spring Rolls order to share, and this time we ordered a side of Chicken Satay as well.  The spring rolls are OK, it tastes like they've been sitting in the refrigerator for awhile since everything's a little on the firm side.  The satay skewers were surprisingly really good, especially with the awesome side of peanut sauce.  Rather than going with the usual, I ordered the Silver Noodle Salad.  It wasn't nearly as filling as some of the rice/noodle dishes, but I enjoyed every ingredient in the salad (silver noodles, ground chicken, shrimp, crispy garlic, onions, cilantro and lemon juice).  Since it was chilly outside, we also ordered two hot teas and it came out in these beautiful glass tea pots.  The tea was hot oolong tea, but it didn't taste like anything standard.  It was a beautiful cup of tea (be careful if you're wearing light colors, the tea is an orange-ish color and will stain if you get it on you).  I'll probably end up coming back to Thai Spice in the future, most for convenience.

DO NOT ORDER ONLINE OR OVER THE PHONE.\n\nFirst of all, they get orders wrong over the phone a lot.  You think online would be better?  Not really.  Well, I should rephrase - it depends on how much you're spending.\n\nSo I work pretty close to here, and when we order food for 6 at night online, they always have the food ready, eventually.  It takes a while and the food had not always been ready even 30 minutes after I arrive.  They also never include any utensils and plates, which can be a real annoyance.\n\nThe problem comes when you order anything less than a certain amount, and who knows what that certain amount is.  I had the misfortune of showing up twice with no food.  Tonight, I ordered online at 9:20 and showed up at 9:45 (they close at 10:00 this particular night).  Their door was already locked and no matter how much I gesture, point to my phone to try to say that I ordered online, they just stared blankly at me.  Finally, someone took the trash out and I walked in around 9:55.  My order was right on the computer screen, but the guy says, \"This computer doesn't refresh itself.\"  To which I responded, \"then why do you have an online ordering system?\"  Not an apology.  Nada.  They don't think they should be responsible at all.  It certainly wasn't my fault.  The problem is  if they don't think your money is worth their effort, they pretend there are technical difficulties.\n\nI think the food's okay, but I think they're REALLY dishonest.

Rice costs extra. \n\nCoconut Ice Cream (5 stars): I love coconut ice cream. And I really loved this ice cream. The texture was almost custardy, and I really liked how dense it was. Oh, and it came in a cute cone shaped glass in a pick ice mixture. \n\nThe restaurant is was cute and service was great.

Beverages were served and water was refilled promptly w/o asking and the food ordered was served in acceptable interval and the food (with one exception) was fine.\n\nOrdered Spinach Rolls ($8) and Angel wings ($12)  for appetizers and Lemongrass Seafood ($15)  and Pumpkin Chicken Yellow Curry ($10)  for entrees.  The spinach rolls were larger than I've seen before and had a delightful flavor w/roasted coconut flakes, peanut sauce and lime; the plate was also decorated w/orchid petals and a spice basil sauce that we couldn't resist.  The Angel wings were very large -- stuffed w/a mixture of vermicelli, chicken meat and other things -- and crisply fried; a pair of steak knives were provided to make cutting the wings easier.  The Lemongrass Seafood was the best dish of the lot -- a generous mixture of green mussels, shrimp, squid, scallops and fish seasoned w/slivered lemongrass and basil; only negative was that you had to be careful to pick away the lemon grass which is basically inedible and has the texture of straw.  The Pumpkin Chicken Yellow Curry was a disappointment -- the chicken was tough and dry -- as though it had been used to make broth and then thrown into the curry to cover it -- but oddly the pumpkin was tough and seemed undercooked.  The curry sauce on the other hand tasted fine. \n\nThe total cost of the meal including $3 for 2 small bowls of rice (which I don't think should be charged for) and a bottle of Thai beer for $4 (which was reasonable) plus tax and tip was $65.  Pretty steep for a late lunch..  So, if you can afford the freight, you should have a decent meal and dining experience at Thai Spice but if you're looking for something more \"affordable\" w/equally good food (albeit not as pleasant decor or food presentation) there are many options on the same block where Thai Spice is located -- particularly Sam's Chinese Restaurant which is located only a few doors away.", "author": "Martin C."}

One couple in our group said quietly to me, \"I wonder why we all came here instead of going to a 'much better' Thai restaurant just across/down the street.\"  Except for my brother, all these friends live within several blocks of this place.\nDecor was nice, staff was fine, and food?... well... meh.\nI found the som toam (green papaya salad) to be sweet with no hint of fire, which is how I like it.  When I ordered it, the waiter did not ask if I wanted any spice, in fact.  I ordered some sticky rice to accompany it, which is how I was taught by a friend who used to live in Thailand to eat the salad.  I thought that for the price of the salad, it was a very small portion.  However, a few others at the table tried this salad and rice for the first time, ever, and remarked they liked it.  \nAs my main dish, I ordered a fat rice noodle dish that had maybe 7 lightly spiced shrimps, fresh broccoli, matchsticks of carrot in a light, sweet gravy (maybe made from some fermented black bean paste).  This was alright, but again, not terribly interesting.  What was most unpleasant was finding the vein in each shrimp not having been completely removed -- Eeewww!  Yukky green stuff!  My brother was not too impressed with his pumpkin curry with chicken; said it was kind of bland.\nHuh.

It was the high point of the meal, next to the wine, which was pretty nice. The sticky rice came in these individual packets inside of  little bambo steamers.

At one point we were sitting there with empty wine glasses and empty water glasses, and short of standing on the table waving flags trying to get the attention of our waitress, a bus person, the hostess, to no avail. In fact it appeared as though the waitress who was in plain sight of me repeatedly made a point of not looking at me so she could carry on her conversation with her coworker. My companion finally did a \"YOOOHOOO\" in a high screechy voice and got the attention of the hostess who then summoned the waitress to work.\n\nGeee. So sorry to inconvenience you at your work where you wait tables with coming to my table. You're wearing an apron, that tells me that you are working.

The sauce for the satay was the exact same as for the spring rolls and once again too thick to really dip into. \n\nThe sauce that came with the crispy tofu was better but the tofu is completely unseasoned and just deep fried.

I forget exactly what was in it, but damn it was tasty.  I ordered it with the pork and medium heat.  Usually I can take a lot of heat, but since I hadn't been there before, I didn't want to kill myself unknowingly.  The heat was perfect.  It was the kind you felt around your lips about 2 minutes after your initial bite.  Then, if you keep licking your lips, they feel like they're on fire and you need to stick it in a bowl full of milk.  Luckily, I didn't get to the milk bowl stage.\n\nThe absolute best thing to wash down peppers with is a nice, tall Thai iced tea.  This was the best one I've had in a really long time.  I always have to pace myself or else I'll order another one and be bouncing off the walls later in the evening.\n\nAnd you know you're in an authentic Thai restaurant when your bill comes and it's all in Thai.

The place is clean and the service is pleasant.\n\nWe started off with the fried calamari appetizer which we were rather impressed by. They offer large thick pieces of calamari and a spicy-sweet dipping sauce. The Tom Yum Goong soup is another staple that offers the right balance of lemongrass and spiciness and filled with shrimp and mushrooms. Now something I haven't noticed on the menu before was the pan friend noodles with duck. This dish was fantastic and has become my new favorite over pad thai and pad sew yew.

So, I got in my car, drove over, double parked and much to my dismay there was a line of people inside waiting for their food.  My food didn't come out for 30 minutes and there were several other angry customers waiting at the counter.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how the counter staff handled (or should I say DID NOT handle this) well.  There was no apology and when my food finally came out I made a comment around the inaccurate timing (I simply asked him to be accurate in how long it will take next time) and the server just glared at me.  Literally death stares.  He didn't say a word and just handed me my food.\n\nI will not go back to Thai Spice because there are many other decent Thai places in town with much better service.\n\nTry Modern Thai just a few blocks down.

Though my culinary adventures sometimes resemble an episode of \"Jackass,\" even I balked at the very real possibility of being airlifted out of rural Thailand, delirious and bleeding from the corner of the eyes, with hemorrhagic fever, and so I kept to the safe mall Thai food most of the time. (And even that was fantastic, so no loss. I think.)\n\nSo I can honestly say that I'm not exactly in the greatest of positions to evaluate Thai food, but I can tell you at least that Thai Spice is a decent, tastefully-decorated, prettily-presented restaurant. No real outstanding dishes, but the Thai beef salad has the chewiness of the beef and the crunchiness of the vegetables and the pungency of the nampla just right. And the duck curry -- I'm a real sucker for duck -- is excellent, though it could have done with less sauce. But service can be kind of spotty. Thai Spice just isn't Thep Phanom, if you get my drift.\n\nParking: let me put it this way. If it's around 5:30 on a weekday, you'll be okay. After 7:30? Let me save you some time: There's usually a row of meters on Pine and Franklin, about 5 blocks away.

The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and peaceful rather nice after a long week.  Both dishes we ordered were delicious and the wait staff were very nice.

Which explains my love for glazed krispy kreme donuts.   \n\nBut when it comes to Thai food, I want mine spicy as hell.  And I didn't seem to get it at Thai Spice, despite the name.

I ordered the shrimp green curry, thai bbq beef, and pad thai.  \n\nThe green curry was very tasty and had an adequate amount of shrimp however it was filled with huge chunks of zucchinis.  The Pad Thai was less then desirable because they used the very thin cellophane noodles which is what you would find in soups more than pad thai.  Overall taste of the noodles was fair.  Lastly the Thai Beef dish was served with a tasty sauce but the beef was a bit tough.  Luckily they provided steak knives to cut the meat however chewing it was a bit of a challenge. \n\nThe atmosphere is very casual and nice but the service needs to improve just a bit.  \n\nI will give this another try and provide an update on my dining experience.   For the neighborhood it's a good place to get a quick bite.", "author": "Oscar F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-05", "description": "Ruam Mit (appetizer combo)  $10.95\nGang Kiew Wan (green curry with chicken)  $8.95\nPad Kee Mao (spicy pan fried noodle w/pork)  $8.95\n\nThe appetizer platter came with 2 pieces fish cake, 2 shrimp-in-the-blankets, 2 spring rolls, 2 curry puffs, and 4 pieces of fried tofu.  Although pretty much everything on the platter was fried, it didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling. In fact, I rather liked the fish cake and spring rolls (though I loathe to admit I liked the spring rolls since it's kind of like an Italian person admitting they like Sbarro pizza). The appetizer combo came with 4 different kinds of dipping sauce: all on the really sweet side but not overbearingly sweet. The pad kee mao had a good flavor to it, but I found the exorbitant amount of dried red pepper chili flakes to be too texturally distracting. The noodles itself are pan fried so they're already going to be dry, but then to make it even more dry by adding dried flakes?  Basically, the flavor was good and it wasn't too oily, but it was kind of gritty. The green curry was smooth, creamy, flavorful, and came with fresh chunks of chicken and zucchini which surprisingly weren't overcooked or undercooked. The curry itself had a nice kick to it but didn't overbear on the flavor of the dish. The spiciness on everything was pretty spot-on; We ordered \"spicy\" so it wasn't \"Thai spicy\" but it was spicy enough that we had to drink 2 glasses of water each (and we're people who could eat raw jalapenos as a snack).  All in all, the food itself is probably worthy of 3.5 - 4 stars.\n \nSo why only 3 stars?  Here are my peeves with this place:\n\n#1) They don't use fresh chili peppers, only dried flakes! When we ordered the food, we asked for a side condiment of Thai chilies in fish sauce. Her reply?  They don't have any fresh chilies, only chili powder / flakes. Somehow their food still managed to taste pretty good, so I don't want to pass judgment on this fact alone, but seriously, a Thai restaurant that doesn't have Thai chilies?  Kind of like a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce. At least a few jalapenos would have filled the gap somewhat, but they didn't have those either.\n\n#2)  Customer/client service is pretty bad. My husband originally ordered green curry with shrimp (not chicken). I heard him say it so I'm pretty sure the waitress heard him say it. When it came out with chicken instead, we told them we ordered shrimp. Did they offer to exchange it?  No. Instead, they merely said the order was written down as chicken, and left the table before we could even open our mouths in response. \n\n#3) This was our first time eating at this restaurant and only decided to try it based on the \"free entr\u00e9e\" coupon we received a la Valpak. One would think coupons are offered in order to entice people to try their restaurant (new customers = new + possibly repeat business), but somehow redeeming the coupon seemed to piss them off!  First, they gave us a bizarre look when I asked to box up the leftover pad kee mao. There was enough for lunch the next day but the look they gave was like I was asking to box up 2 pieces of noodle. When the cashier person came to drop off our bill, she also dropped off the pad kee mao box...literally. She dropped it right in front of my husband's face and it came tumbling out of the bag. She mumbled something resembling a sorry (hey, we all have our bad days, so we were willing to overlook this) but then as she was making a motion to try and put the box back into the takeout bag, halfway through she basically made a \"screw it\" gesture and then not very discreetly flung the box back onto the table in front of his face again.....  \n\nI really wanted to like this place because it's so close to the house and the food is pretty good, but don't know if we can bring ourselves back to eat here again because of the service. Normally we're pretty easy going on service and overlook a lot of things, but kind of feel like they almost didn't want us to come back?", "author": "Colleen L."}

I ordered the barbecue chicken and was surprised to be handed literally half a chicken on my plate. That being said, they're pretty generous with their portions. However, I was totally skimped on the sauce and only got enough to pour onto one chicken breast. That sauce was really good, so I don't understand why they gave me so little of it.

He began the call upon arrival at the apartment building with a threat to leave and charge us a cancellation fee if we did not get downstairs and pick the food up immediately ourselves. Incredulous, we asked that he please ring the front door and deliver to our apartment on the 5th floor, unable to believe that a food delivery person would refuse to deliver to the door. He refused, restated for us to come downstairs, then also insisted that the single bag of food being delivered deserved a much higher tip than what we charged to the card. Needless to say, after going downstairs ourselves, and him nearly refusing to hand over the prepaid food altogether, there was no additional tip in cash to go along with what had already been paid. The delivery guy's instruction to pay more tip next time was answered with a you-must-be-crazy-to-think-there's-going-to-be-a-next-time.

I'm rarely disappointed with my food, but I'm rarely blown away either.  I wouldn't drive to go to Thai Spice, but it's a very solid option if you are in the area.  The Pumpkin Yellow Curry with Chicken is one of the better options.", "author": "Luke P."}

I just tried to place an order for delivery and was told that there would be a five dollar charge despite the fact that the menu I am staring at says free delivery. I could understand the logic if I was far from the restaurant but I checked the distance and I am 1.4 miles from their location - not far at all (5 min drive max). I was annoyed by the response so decided to order from one of my favorite Chinese places the offers truly FREE delivery. Out of curiosity I checked the distance of the Chinese place and it is 4.8 miles form my house - almost clear across the City and no charge. I will probably give them an additional five bucks for making the trek - it is the principle. To bad I could not try the Thai as there were about four hungry people and a large order waiting but it was a five dollar charge and some false advertisement that separated us.", "author": "Oren H."}

I was super hungry so I ordered (online) 2 dishes for  a lunch delivery- chicken pad thai and coconut curry for $21 before the tip! The pad thai has no flavor and they used rice noodles instead of the normal pad thai noodles- unhappy with my pad thai I moved on to the curry- until I realized that they didn't give rice with the curry! Who does that? I have never had to order rice with a curry dish- shouldn't that be an automatic side? Will not be ordering delivery from here again.", "author": "Mandy F."}

It was horrible. My bf dragged me here one night against my will and i gladly changed my mind. The food was amazing. I had pad kee mao and bbq chicken. Both were absolutely scruptious and full of flavor. I have since returned numerous times, brought friends and plan to take my mom there when she comes this weekend. And a great thing about here is they deliver and send out coupons in the mail so I think it's like 20% off if you plan right. Not a bad deal for great thai food.", "author": "Sarah I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-11-17", "description": "Food is decent.  Don't get dishes that are primarily seafood (with clams or mussels) because the seafood is not the freshest.\nThe service is not too decent.  Some waiters are great, majority are not so good.  If you don't tip one guy well, he lets you know.  Need I say more.  I've heard this happened more than once.  Also when they're busy some of the waiters become irritated, which is understandable.  But if they get irritated before the customers do, that's not a good sign.  I was also served super watered down Thai Iced tea.  When I asked for a replacement, they said they were out.  Also, once I came in midday for takeout.  As soon as the waitress saw me, she said they weren't really open for business.  I asked if they were ok with takeout, she said yes.  As I was waiting that 8 minutes for pad thai, two people came in and sat down to eat.  She served them. Maybe the waitress was too shy to tell them to leave, I don't know.  In any case, it was a weird experience.\nOn the other hand, generally speaking more than half of the experiences I had here were ok.  I've been here a lot because of convenience and I'll still go, hoping not have a bad experience.  When I do happen to have a bad experience, I'm not surprised.", "author": "busy b."}

It then came back with dark meat chicken, (that tasted sour) and this dish is typically done with white meat.  The waitress agreed it is usually done with white mean, but said they do this particular dish there with dark (but she really understood why I was surprised).  Came back with white meat.  By now my rice was cold, and their was no offer of new rice.  It was ok, but I've had this dish other places in the City where it is much better.  The waitress was very nice and patient tho, and some of the other food looked really good, so since I'm in the area alot I will probably try it again.", "author": "G C."}

After tonight I changed my mind. We missed the delivery guy. I called 4 minutes after I missed their call. The delivery guy said he was already back at the restaurant and it would take 45 minutes to deliver our food. Uh, no thanks to the cold food. And if it took 4 minutes to get back there, why 45 minutes? I talked to the manager who lied to me about 8 times; (delivery guy is here, he already left, the food will just have to be cold, we will make new food for you....). After paying nearly $40 there SHOULD be better service. I asked to speak to his manager and/or get his managers name. He refused to give it to me. AWFUL service. AWFUL attitude.

Two stars for the meal, which was good, but as I have only eaten there once I have not had any other dishes there to compare. No stars for the attitude of the waiter. I was there in the afternoon on Sunday (5/25) and when I came to pay it was by credit card. The guy who served me also gave me the chit to sign. I put the amount of the meal in the Total section and he suddenly said to me \"It's not fair\". I said \"what's not fair\". His reply. \"You have not written anything down for a tip\". I was totally surprised and a little annoyed at his rudeness. I replied \"First of all you are not meant to ask for a tip, and second I was going to leave it on the table\". Now this was when his behavior became totally unacceptable to me. He said \"I don't believe you\". I was dumbstruck for a second and then asked him to repeat what he had said in case I misheard. He again said \"I don't believe you\". I told him that I was definitely going to leave the tip on the table but after this exchange I had changed my mind and was not going to leave him one. He said it was unfair that I treated restaurants like this. I said I didn't, that I usually left a tip for good service but as he was so rude he would not be getting one now. He kept on repeating \"I don't care\" to everything I said. I said it was obvious he did not care because of his attitude which I also told him stunk. I really enjoyed the beef dish I had but there is no way I would return to this place because of this server's attitude. When I recounted this episode to a friend he asked me if I had asked for the owner so I could complain. Normally I would have but I was so surprised by this guy's attitude that to do so escaped me at the time. Having read a few of the other posts now I am wondering if I got the 'family weekend' guy.  On reflection, I also had to get the guy's attention for him to take my order (he was not busy as I was the ONLY customer at that time) and he never took my plates away when I was finished or asked if I wanted anything else. I waited for him to come over but when he didn't I went up to initiate paying my bill. I like Thai food and have eaten in qutie a lot of Thai restaurants in the city but this is the first time I have ever encountered such rude service from a member of the Thai community.", "author": "mary f."}
