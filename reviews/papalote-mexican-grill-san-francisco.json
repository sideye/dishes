Bonus points for their amazing complimentary salsa for their chips!\n\nWhen you get the chicken burrito or deconstructed bowl, be sure to ask for the adobo chicken, not the pollo asado... the adobo is shredded and so tender, while the pollo asado I believe is just diced roasted chicken.

I wish I knew what Papalote was like before it was featured on Throwdown. Was the triple threat always $20? Back then, $20 was a lot of cash for a burrito and it still is now, but at least that burrito hasn't been affected by inflation in these past few years. Also, the hype has calmed down compared to those crowds after the episode first aired. \n\nTriple Threat - chicken breast, carne asada, prawns:\nIt's loaded with 3 types of proteins, but I don't feel threatened. The taste and quality is on par with most burritos, so in comparison, the price tag sure is steep. The grilled prawns were the best part. They're tender and springy with a nice char. Plus, the prawns are left whole instead of chopped up beyond recognition. The chicken and carne asada are nicely seasoned, too. \nIt is a very large burrito, so if you need a reason to justify spending $20, you can share it or split it between two meals. It's also a good decision if you have a tough time choosing between poultry, beef, & seafood, or if you're just curious to try it, but it is not a must have.\n\nThe Carne Asada & Pollo Asado burritos are pretty good too, sans shrimp. The single meat burritos are about $10, which is a little pricey. Adding cheese, guac, or sour cream are each $1. Kind of a bummer, since burritos usually include cheese. If you're going to add one, you might as well add all 3 for $2, resulting in a very creamy burrito. \n\nOf course the roasted tomato salsa is excellent. It is the true threat here. This thick & creamy, robust, orange sauce is like a flavor explosion of smokey, sweet, savory, spicy, and slightly tart. This salsa is excellent on their thin, warm chips, as well as on everything else. Jars of Papalote's various salsas are available for purchase in various local markets. \nOverall, I'm satisfied with the food, but the prices are high relative to other Mexican joints in the Mission, so I give it a 7.25/10.", "author": "Joy W."}

I was meeting a friend in SF for lunch and he asked what I wanted. I said I found this burrito place on a website that was named one of the best burrito joints so I was dying to try it out.\n\nHe confirmed that he had been papalote's before and said it was pretty damn good. \nThat got me even more excited than I already was... The day came and I walk in the restaurant. I forgot to mention, I went to the Mission location. The place is pretty small and very casual. \nI ordered the Carne Asada burrito with whole wheat tortilla. The price is definitely not considered cheap but it's SF so I wasn't surprised... about $10+ for a burrito and chips/salsa.\n\nI just have to say this first.. but the salsa was bomb!! It's not like any salsa I've ever had before... it's not chunky and does not have the consistency of your average salsa. It's very much like a sauce almost and is pretty oily. I can't describe it, but I just couldn't get enough of it.\nNow on to the burrito... it was delicious and nicely grilled which was a nice touch. \n\nMy only minor complaint is the size... it could've been a bit bigger for the price. \n\nHint: They sell the salsa they serve in the restaurant. There are many different salsas they sell, but be sure to ask for the fresh one they sell. Unfortunately for me, they were sold out of that one so I got what they said was the next closest thing... At $7 a jar, it's the most expensive salsa I've ever bought, but damn it was worth every drop. \n\nI'll savor every last drop until the next time I visit Papalotes again.", "author": "Milton F."}

Yeah they sell it separately in a jar. \n\nFive, and probably the most evident indicator of Papalolte's hipster affiliation, a burrito costs like $10 to $11 #damndaniel\n\nMy good friend, Salty P, swears by this place though. He loves pouring that creamy salsa on each bite of his carne asada while convincing us that Papalote is actually the best burrito place in Mission. But we can't trust this guy to give an unbiased opinion. Salty P. wears a beard, rocks an expensive vest, and has like, 5 hydroflask bottles (\"i need it\").\n\nAlthough i might not like Papalote, i do recommend it to my vegetarian friends though. I know other burrito places offer vegetarian options, too, but Papalote takes their vegetarian menu seriously. Unlike other places, you can be sure that the oil used for the veggie options is kept separately from the meat. You can sleep easy knowing that a piece of meat may not have snuck its way into your Soyrizo Burrito. How can we be so sure? Because unlike other burrito places, Papalote actually has something to lose. They got a chain store down at Fulton.\n\nSo yeah, if you don't have any dietary restrictions and/or if you're not a hipster, then i would go Cancun and El Faro instead.

As of a few weeks ago! I could have gotten so many free burritos by now!\n\nAside from free burritos, what makes this place great?\n\n1) Convenient. I live a block from this location. And when my friends and I are feeling like lazy bums...sorry, since we ARE lazy bums, we call in bulk to-go orders, wait 15 minutes, and send over volunteer tributes to pick up our stash.\n\n2) Quality. Their meat is GOOD. Tender. Moist. And they are so generous. One of my girls swears by two menu items: the mole and the chile verde. I've tried both, and I'm a much bigger fan of the CHILE VERDE because the pork makes my taste buds dance a happy dance. I get it as a salad to cut down on carbs and because the jicama and fresh salsa pair so well with the salty pork and the awesome green serrano sauce, which I drizzle errywhere. I've also tried their carne asada burrito and breakfast burrito, both of which are bomb. Oh, when they say scrambled eggs, they really mean pulverized eggs--it's pretty awesome.\n\n3) Customizable. Tacos, burritos, naked burritos, quesadillas, salads--meat/tofu vehicles of all types. Last I checked, their \"make it super\" option, which adds sour cream, cheese, and guacamole was only $1. Seems like the prices now are more expensive per online source?\n\n4) Crack sauce. When I first tried it, I wasn't a big fan because it's spicy. It's still spicy, but I've learned to better ignore my screaming pain receptors. There's something about eating crunchy tortilla chips with a creamy sauce that makes everything taste way better. I love this combination so much that I always save my leftover chips and sauce for future snacking. I even save my friends' leftover chips and sauce. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy, squirreling away all of those mini sauce containers in our fridge. I think I'm GENIUS. They sell jars of this stuff, and I'm getting it FO' FREE.\n\n5) REWARDS CARD. This perk deserves to be repeated. FYI: valid for burrito purchases only.\n\nDownside: seating. It looks like a seat-yourself situation, but one of the waitstaff will usually be around the dining room entrance to keep an eye out for tables. The room holds about 20 people, so you might have to wait for a bit during rush hours.\n\nBut srsly, Papalote is dope-alote. Time to reap some free burritos.", "author": "Adele F."}

They also sell the salsa at the cash register and I've actually seen it at some supermarkets on the peninsula. \n\nThe actual food I ordered were the nachos with shrimp, and personally I wasn't blown away -- the nachos were topped with a lot of melted shredded cheese, tomatoes, and beans, but not much else and they were somewhat skimpy on the shrimp (i.e. I can get more shrimp for half the price from a cheapo taqueria in the same part of town, or in Redwood CIty where I live within a mile from about 5 Mexican restaurants).

Larger than my forearm, this creation included chunks of tender carne asada, smoked prawns, succulent achiote chicken, rice, beans and slightly piquant papalote salsa. He made it super by adding fresh guacamole, cheese and  sour cream. The marriage between all of the ingredients worked magically, I wouldn't change a single thing about this burrito. Though the price is fairly steep ($19.99), it can easily be shared among two people and the quality and taste alone are enough for me to pay the whooping fee each and every time. The papalote salsa is pretty epic, though not as spicy as I'd like it to be. The roasted tomatoes and chili provide a bit of a smokey flavor, the salsa is a full-bodied/robust work of art boasting in both flavor and aroma. I purchased one to take home and finished it in three days. I built my own burrito as well and the menu allows for optimal customization if you don't want one of their signature burritos. I was able to chose between the type of beans, rice, meat and tortilla I wanted. I basically built myself a super healthy burrito (brown rice, wheat tortilla, black beans, chicken), however it was still ridiculously delicious and better than anything Chiptole could ever manufacture for me. I highly recommend any of their burritos, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nPrice: On the pricier end and they'll tack on more for adding any extra ingredients. However, the food here is certainly worth the price every time. \n\nAmbiance: Small, simple and clean.

Unfortunately the rest of their items are passable so I think I will likely be getting the salsa to go and getting my burrito/taco/quesadilla elsewhere in the future. Regardless, this salsa is absolutely \"as good as it gets\" and I will probably always have some on hand in my fridge.", "author": "Mark O."}

Major.\n\nUSA Today ranked Papalote Mexican Grill as the #1 burrito in the country. I've eaten quite a few excellent burritos and a lot of \"meh\" burritos, but actually not a lot of terrible burritos. The one I had today would fall into that last category. I'm pretty sure I actually enjoy Chipotle's burritos more, and that's saying something.\n\nI got the super \"Triple Threat Burrito\" -- chicken, steak, and shrimp. I should have known it was going to be a discombobulated flavor mess. First of all, among the three proteins, I only enjoyed the steak. The chicken, although obviously dusted in some spice mixture, was incredibly bland, and the shrimp was very fishy AND overcooked. I was burping up bad shrimp all night long.\n\nAs for the rest of the burrito, it could be that I just ordered wrong by getting the refried beans. They advertise the refried beans as being vegan, which should have been a red flag. Ask your abuela if she ever made vegan refried beans. She'd laugh at you. But aside from the poor taste, the texture was... saucy. Not goopy, not gloppy, not bean-y. Saucy. And these beans, which made up far too much of the burrito, melded together with the salsa, watery guacamole, and who knows what else to become a really drippy, nasty sauce. Burritos are meant to have all of the components stay separate while being wrapped together, not seem like they've gone through a blender together to become homogenized. It was really, really bad. I regretted buying this $22 burrito (Yes! $22!!!) two bites into it.\n\nOn another note, the salsa that comes with their chips is very unique. Very Romesco-y. The chips were stale.\n\nTips and tricks for if you go to Papalote:\n1) Don't get the shrimp. Or chicken. \n2) Don't get the refried beans. Just trust me on this.\n3) Park on the residential streets nearby.\n4) Actually, nevermind all that. Skip this spot and go to La Taqueria instead.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

But just because they were thoughtful enough to want to make money off of vegetarians, doesn't mean they aren't douchebags.\n\nIt's been almost 5 years since I have been there, but my last experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, and I have heard it has gotten worse, that I felt morally compelled to write a bad review.  \n\nLast time I went there I got charged about $10 for a \"super\" burrito, and it was TINY, and I had to pay extra for each of the tiniest thimbles of salsa I had ever seen (i went through three of them in the first few bites), even though I was eating IN HOUSE!\nI can kind of understand charging for salsa after the first few cups if its to go, but to charge $10 for a tiny burrito, AND charge for salsa to eat in house, and treat customers like trash, is just incomprehensible.\nThat's Donald Trump-like in its audacity, and I can't believe more people haven't called them out on their shit.", "author": "james b."}

Well I finally was able to have my answer this past week. \n\nAfter deliberating where to go, we decided to go to Papalote for their chips and salsa. While browsing their menu online I noticed something odd. Everyone on Yelp kept posting pictures of the Triple Threat Burrito however I saw it no where on the menu. Turns out it is their signature item that was featured on Bobby Flay's show Throwdown. \n\nBasically its a huge burrito stuffed with steak, chicken and shrimp however you do need to pay $1 extra to make it super. To me it is weird that isn't included in the price but ok. My friend and I agreed to split the burrito plus get chips, extra salsa and two beers. We both ended up paying $18 for just that so keep that in mind. \n\nFor what its worth, the salsa is unlike any other salsa I have had. From color, consistency and all the way down to flavor there is a complexity to their salsa that is well worth trying. The chips did not appear to be anything out of the ordinary but I would recommend trying the salsa at least one time. \n\nThe steak was sensational, the best I have had so far from any mexican restaurant. It was juicy, flavorful and fork tender. I would gladly go back for their carne asada burrito. \n\nChicken was fine, good portion and seasoned adequately but no real highs or lows.\n\nAs for the shrimp, the addition of the 4 pieces felt a little underwhelming, and left me wondering why was it even in there to begin with. The quality was good and cooked well but didn't find it be a valid \"threat\".\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nSalsa is delicious and well worth trying as well as the carne asada but be warned Papalote isn't a cheap grab and go burrito kind of place", "author": "Eddie W."}

Also, the staff is constantly preparing and queue-ing up the next tables for the guests waiting so you never quite feel relaxed. I prefer a sit down meal where I'm not rushed personally. \n\nThe taste of the vegan tofu tacos were good at first, but it was cloying after a while and hard to finish. My friend commented that his tacos were just okay as well. \n\nThe infamous salsa was okay, I don't know what it was about it but it was not my favorite. My friend had another kind at home, and that was spicy and delicious. We wished it were served in-house.", "author": "Charlene N."}

This is flat-out my favorite. They grill the meat fresh as you place your order - not ladling it out of some bin of mystery meat, like many of the other places - and all the ingredients are super top quality, fresh from the farm. The owner and staff are exceptionally friendly, and many of them greet me by name.

But there are so many great options in the area, does this one hold up to its reputation? I'm going to say no. It's getting a high rating from me because I generally love Mexican food, especially if it's in the Mission. If I say it's in my top ten, that's got to be a good thing right?\n\nI had the carne asada burrito, it's my go to. The taste is definitely there. It's packed full of flavor, the vegetables were fresh, the meat tender and cooked to perfection, the service was blazing fast (which mexican place isn't?). However, the portions left me wanting more. Or maybe it's my huge appetite. Other places give you a giant burrito that can fill an ogre. The burritos here were moderate sized, not enough for your average (read: fat) american. \n\nI had a jamaica aka hibiscus drink as well, but found it too sugary.\n\nStill, it's a good location, and the food was delicious. The portions were average size, but for the price, the value is missing.

There is a bunch of hype for this place and I was intrigued in trying this place. When we got there the restaurant was empty and the menu is a little hard to read. \n\nThe service at the counter was okay. It was our first time there and there were two people behind us and we felt very rushed. The girl that was taking our order was very quick when we ordered one thing saying \"okay anything else\" as soon as we said one item. We didn't have a chance to ask questions or even take a good look at the drink options because we felt like she was trying to cut the line of two down as soon as possible.\n\nAfter we got our drinks, we went and sat down. The place is very small but has enough seating for roughly 15-20 people. Our party of 8 sat comfortably. Within 5 minutes our guacamole came out with the house salsa. Roughly 5 minutes later our triple threat burrito came out. The guys that brought out the food were really nice.\n\nThe guacamole was absolutely fantastic. It is up there on par with Chipotle if not better and I didn't know if that was even possible. Chipotle's guacamole was one of the best I have ever had but this place takes the cake as far as guacamole is concerned. The $10 appetizer seemed expensive, but for the price you actually get a lot of guacamole.\n\nThe triple threat burrito is the size of a new born baby. It is large. I am glad I shared it because there is no way I would have been able to eat that by myself. The main event was the saddest part of our visit. As Scott L. mentioned, you can tell the meat is flavored and there are things working for it but as a whole it is underwhelming. I had better burritos at taco trucks. \n\nThere wasn't enough good things to warrant a revisit. I won't be back unless I am in the city craving some delicious guacamole.", "author": "Nicholas S."}

Seriously.\n\nGranted, I didn't necessarily have an issue with the way the perfectly grilled, plump, and juicy prawns were proportioned relative to the other ingredients in my burrito, and I'm sure the portion size would have done a better job filling me up if I didn't have the rice replaced with romaine to cut back on carbs. But my burrito was almost all tortilla: take your average Chipotle burrito (forgive the comparison), remove half of the contents, and charge twice the price. Oh and speaking of the contents, it was just prawns, romaine, and black beans..... For that kind of subpar value? Meh... I've definitely experienced better.\n\nIt's a shame because this is totally my kind of Mexican joint -- ultra fresh, high-quality ingredients simply and relatively healthily prepared but loaded with intricate layers of natural flavors.

Since we were in the area, I couldn't pass up the chance. \n\nWe got there around 8pm, an hour before closing time. It was nice to get free chips and salsa while waiting for our food. As I've already mentioned, the salsa is bomb!!! The chips, on the other hand, I didn't really care for. They were kinda stale. Then burritos came. I had the tofu mole burrito with refried black beans, wrapped in spinach tortilla and upgraded to super for just 99 cents! Super means they add sour cream, guacamole and cheese. I got mine without the sour cream. The burrito was delicious! That mole sauce was one of the best I've ever tried.

I've been to this place a couple times and I have never been disappointed.\n \nHere's why I gave them FIVE stars:\n\nPlus one star for the portion size.  I was looking around the restaurant and the portions that they give patrons are pretty hefty.  I'm such a piggy that I love big portion sizes (but of course without sacrificing quality!) We got the Triple Threat Burrito which is so ginormous that Loverboy and I were full after splitting one. You can even split that burrito into three and still be full afterwards.  You can save some of it for the next day.  It tastes amazing just sitting in the fridge overnight.  It's like the flavors magnified while marinating in the fridge. $20 for one burrito is not expensive if you can split that into three or four meals.  \n\nPlus one star for flavor. The beef, chicken and prawns were perfectly seasoned.  Everything inside that monstrous burrito is delicious. The meat pieces were so juicy and tender. The flavors of the three different kinds of meats really complemented each other.\n\nAnother star for beating that douche Bobby Flay. I just can't stand his show and how he goes around America telling people he can cook better.  Papalote really deserved that win and they were heroes for showing B. Flay that he ain't all that!\n\nAnother star for the sauce.  It is sooooogood!  I want to drink a whole jar of it. I am so happy that they sell jars of that yummy sauce. I just want to slather that sauce all over rice and you could even put that in a quesadilla or a sandwich.\n\nThe last star goes to the owners and the staff.  The cashiers were super nice and they had big smiles on their face when we ordered.  The owners are socially responsible and are good people. I went to a volunteer event for Project Pearls where we collected clothes and non-perishable goods for victims of Typhoon Sendong in the Philippines.  Around lunch time, one of the owners of Papalote came with a big box full of burritos which he donated to feed the volunteers. He brought us FREE chicken adobo burritos!

Yes, the salsa is very unique - creamy as though it is an emulsion of oil and tomato with chiles and a nice spicy kick. (almost like a spicy aioli).    The chicken nachos were very good - nice big serving with lots of grilled chicken and cheese.  But at the end of the day, there was nothing remarkable about this place other than the long line.\n\nI will say this - the staff is super helpful. The seating is very limited, so they will time your order if you tell them that you are eating \"in\".  They make sure you have a table first, then they sit you down and THEN they bring your food.  They won't prepare the food until you have a spot to sit.  This means that you get hot food and a place to sit, but it also means that if you order your food for \"dine-in\" then you won't get your food until there is a spot to sit.

I got pretty lucky and got a table in under 10 minutes. \n\nSat down after ordering food, and the waiter immediately came with chips and salsa.

I'm not usually a fan of fake meat, but I loved the soyrizo!! Would get it again for sure. It's a little spicy, so difficult to eat with their salsa which also has a bit of a kick. I came with someone who got the same thing without the soyrizo, which was still really good but I like the soyrizo add-on more!

If you responded \"Papalote\" ... ding ding ding!\n\nSeriously, as much as I like El Farolito (of which I am also a fan), Papalote will likely be in the mix for my go to spots for Mexican fare, even though I have mixed feelings.  As far as authenticity and value, Papalote is lacking, so I can see where others are coming from when they reduce Papalote as merely a fancy Chipotle, though I don't agree.  Also, Papalote's burritos are slightly smaller and pricier than its Mission counterparts.  \n\nOn the other hand.  It's hard to argue with the quality, especially the famed roasted tomato salsa. \n\nOverrated?  Nope, I don't think so.  Papalote's burrito and quesadilla were simply delicious, no exaggerated flavors.  In my view, Papalote deserves all the pub that comes with being named as SF Weekly's \"best burrito\" every year since 2007.  Now the Food Network has taken notice.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was off the chain, with tender beef and rich flavor and the burrito was not overly salted.  Plus it was just the right size that it wont leave you stuffed and bloated after the meal.\n\nHowever, the highlight of my meal was the camarones quesadilla, which features shrimp sauteed in white wine and butter with delicious melted cheese...seriously, this is very very good stuff.  Add to that the flavor of the roasted peppers, with a dab of roasted tomato salsa and a bottle of coke on the side...I'd say that's a winning combo.\n\nUnfortunately, the only damper was that the chips we got were too hard and they might have been a little stale.  It didn't matter too much in the end.  The roasted tomato salsa was so good that I could have dipped cardboard in it and I would have enjoyed the meal.\n\nThank you; Chef Escobedo.

The semi-long line moves fairly quickly, you place your order, take a seat, a person brings you chips with their signature orange salsa, and then your order.

Then, I wanted to try it even more when I read an article recently that named this place the Best Burrito in America.... I can't tell you the excitement I had inside- it was overwhelming.\n\nOf course, the place was packed inside. It's a very small, cozy place with only a few tables... The seating is somewhat communal style, where you may or may not have to share the same table with other parties... It has a cool, vibe to it- fits right in in the Mission neighborhood.\n\nYou order at the front counter and then are asked to wait outside until they are able to seat your party. \n\nObviously I ordered the $19.95 Triple Threat Burrito (Don't worry- I shared this with one other person) as that's the very burrito that beat out Bobby Flay and was mentioned in the article... P.s. It's an extra $0.99 for guacamole ... Why wouldn't a $20 burrito already have guacamole in it? (That extra $0.99 is actually for cheese, sour cream and guacamole but I don't eat cheese or sour cream) \n\nOnce seated, they will bring you chips and salsa (it more looks like a slightly thick, smooth orangey sauce)... The chips are mediocre, but the salsa is really unique tasting and really yummy! \n\nThe burrito was served very shortly after. It's huge! Thank goodness we decided to share.  So the burrito was really good... Really, really good... Probably the best meat I've ever had in a burrito- the pieces of steak and chicken are lean and big and juicy and flavorful; very different from many Mexican food places where the meat is always greasy, minced to an oblivion and full of weird, chewy and fatty bites where you aren't quite sure what you just put in your mouth (icky)... The shrimp is grilled to perfection and also bursting with flavor... All the meats are cooked to order and you really could taste the freshness in the cooking- it keeps you excited for each and every bite that you take.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal... The high quality of the meat is definitely the highlight of this place.... But to me, they really need to improve their chip recipe and the fact that this place isn't what you would consider to be typical \"Mexican taqueria style\" food threw me off a little from what I was expecting... Also, in my opinion, America's best burrito is definitely not going to have black beans inside it. \n\nOkay, so maybe it's not the best burrito in my book, but I would say this place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area. \n\nNote: This place has tons of vegetarian options which was really cool to me.", "author": "Gaby C."}

That works in your favor, because I'll help you avoid eating at places like Papalote.\n\nLet's start with the food, of course. It sucked. My girlfriend and I shared the carne asada plate. Let's talk for a moment about carne asada. Typically, but not always, made from skirt steak, prized for it's flavor, not it's tenderness. It's for this reason that they usually marinate the shit out of it to break it down a bit prior to searing it to impart some additional flavorful goodness and then cutting it across the grain to make it easy to eat. Did that make you hungry? Well then don't go to Papalote. The carne asada at this place is devoid of all of the qualities I've just described.\n\nAnd I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that all of the accompanying sides (with the exception of the refried black beans; those were surprisingly tasty) were mediocre at best.

I love mushrooms and have never seen them in a burrito so I got this one. I'm often skeptical of potatoes in a burrito, but these were fresh cut, as were the carrots, and large chunks full of flavor. I love that you can pick what kind of rice, beans and wrap that you want. The papalote's salsa is amazing! I upgraded to get cheese/sour cream/guac and it was the perfect combo. Comes with a small bowl of chips and salsa on side.  I would definitely come back here next time I am in the Mission. Also, not at all crowded at 3pm on a Monday!

I hadn't been here since all the hype last year made the lines insanely long.  But I came here yesterday with my coworker around 1pm and the line was practically non-existent.  I remember that I really liked the carne asada burrito last year more than the chicken adobo burrito.  But my coworker said he really liked the adobo one better.  So my wily side came out and I convinced him to half his adobo burrito with me and I'll half my carne asada with him.  The best of both worlds!\n\nI started my meal off with their nachos and signature salsa.  The spiciness of the salsa has a nice little kick to it that makes your mouth say, \"Feed me another....and another.....one more......aw hell, just keep going.\"  I balanced it out with their freshly squeezed cantaloupe drink.  I frikkin' love freshly squeezed cantaloupe drinks! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jwb3vTh8rn3OsN9wlI56-Q?select=Tk-JVGQ-oTYVcHBMxuxG5Q)\n\nThe chicken adobo burrito came out first.  I remember the last time I had it, it was kinda dry.  That wasn't the case this time.  It was actually pretty juicy.  The adobo flavor is definitely not the typical Filipino adobo flavor.  There's something different about it.  Maybe a Mexican touch?  I'm no chef so I can't really say what it is.  Either way, it still tastes good.  I'd get it again.  On a side note, my coworker ordered it with no beans and I think this was a genius decision.  I think beans would have messed up the harmony of the burrito overall. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jwb3vTh8rn3OsN9wlI56-Q?select=F-QEBmUZwDW3MJ-y1suNvg)\n\nThe carne asada was just like I remembered it.  Juicy and tasty all around.  You can really taste the grill flavor in the meat.  It was actually a little more saltier than before, but I'm going to overlook that cuz I still enjoyed it.  Overall, I was thoroughly full.  Afterwards, I felt like my stomach was bulging and wished I could lay down and take a fat-ass nap.  I think there must be a school close by because the younger gen started to filter in as we were finishing our meal.  And that meant it was time to go back to work.", "author": "Joe M."}

The chips and that salsa they bring over (and they also pack it in your to-go order) ROCKS!!!   I'm not sure what's in it, tomatoes, other vegetables mixed in and spices all blended together.

I couldn't be more puzzled as to how this place has been able to achieve its status as some of the best burritos and salsa in the Mission. I found both to be very mediocre and expensive.\n\nYou have to order something before you can sit down here. I arrived a little earlier than her and they wouldn't let me sit at a table while I waited for her even though there was space. Not a big deal, but worth noting. Ordering was painless enough, but boy were the prices high! I ordered a super chicken burrito and a horchata. I had heard people rave about their salsa/secret sauce so I also got an extra cup of it for 50 cents extra. My total was $16! My friend ordered guacamole and a naked burrito and her total was over $20. \n\nThe food came, and to their credit, they got it out to us incredibly fast! I tried some of my friend's guacamole and it was very good and fresh, but still not $8.50-good. The salsa was definitely not anything to write home about, but it was kind of unique compared to most salsas and tasted fine. The chips on the other hand were pretty bad. Not inedible, but bad enough to where I abandoned them after the first three or four. But they were also free, so I guess that's forgivable. \n\nThen came the burrito and honestly, there just wasn't whole lot going on flavor-wise. It had everything I usually like, but for some reason I just felt like it was missing something, like there was no depth to the flavor. On the other hand, they were generous with the chicken and the cheese was nicely melted. It was also pretty big so I was able to bring some home. \n\n+1 star for having extra pieces of tin foil out for the customers to wrap their leftover burrito up in.

With the plethora of amazing food in sf, scratch that- in the area, scratch tha-t ON THAT ONE DAMN STREET! whhhyyy oh why did I chose a place with mediocre food and insane prices? \n\nOk so their confusing weird menu offers 79 types of burritos or tacos at sort of decent prices or if you don't want a burrito you can choose an egg dish or a plate. When I ordered the Chicken Mole plate the cashier asked me if I wanted to make it super. I asked what that entailed and she said, \"sour cream salsa and guacamole for $.99\" Uhhhhh como-what? For SIXTEEN GOD DAMN DOLLARS you guys aren't gonna slap some condiments on my plate? I should have turned around and left at that moment or at least changed my order but I just declined the super-cision and moved on.

You give out 2 tsp of salsa and then charge if somebody consumes it in 5.2 seconds? There should be disclaimers galore on those little shot glasses of sauce! We paid the stupid 50 cents because we basically had to, for we had no condiments on our stupid, un-super plate. We were given either 4 or 6 tortillas for 2 plates, my man eats minimum 6 tortillas so I had 1 and he the rest and we just packaged our food up to-go since we knew we'd be in for another up-charge if god forbid we want more of their crappy hard chewy tortillas. Oh and if Papalote wants a lesson on how to make Mole I'd be happy to oblige. I mean, on Mondays you can get the nectar of the Gods at Los Compadre's in South City on Grand Ave, but not even comparing it to that, Paplote's sucked.  Lay off the crunched up bran flakes!

Papalote was the first recommendation given to me when venturing into this mecca of big burrito lovers.  I'm not going to just meekly accept the assumption that all burritos from this area are better than anywhere else without validating this myself though.    \n\nGoing on a picturesque Sunday evening in August, it was surprisingly not too packed.  I have had longer waits at Chipotle.  The clientele here included mainly tourists and hipsters, here because of their devotion to a good burrito.  \n\nPapalote is REALLY proud of the fact that their \"Triple Threat\" (steak, chicken, shrimp) burrito beat Iron Chef Bobby Flay's.  It's prominently advertised and mentioned by Papalote groupies.  And they charge $20.  I asked a friend who is a Papalote devotee if she wanted to split it, but was told it's not really that big.  But still $20?  Yeah, no thanks.\n\nSo you order at Papalote by telling them what you want, getting a number, taking it to your table, and waiting for them to bring it out.  I ordered the chicken burrito and got a Horchata too.  On to the chips and salsa.  The salsa is pretty awesome.  It tasted like a fire-roasted tomato-based red salsa, but is a little creamy too.  The chips were standard.  The horchata was a tad sweet for my taste.\n\nThe burrito came out after roughly 10 minutes.  Time to dig in!  Wait . . . no foil and it's on a plate?  Surely I don't have to eat this burrito with knife and fork? That's a little too formal for me, so I used my hands and picked it up.  First bite and I liked the flavor of the burrito.  The chicken seemed shredded.  A little dry.  As I continued to eat it, it was good, but it did not wow me or fill me up at the end of the meal.  A good burrito.  Add a little salsa as you eat the burrito and it's better.  But this experience has inspired me to try other joints in the Mission for my next visit.

I was new to the Mission burrito scene and needed to decide if I like Mission burritos or not by visiting a few of the burrito joints in the Mission.  Some may argue that Papalote's burritos aren't quite Mission burritos, but I decided to give them a chance as part of my experiment.\n\nSo, I got close to my standard burrito; carne asada, pinto beans, super, no rice. It was damn good.  It was very similar in flavor to the previous Mission burritos.\n\nAs mentioned, this was the last installment of The Mission Burrito Experiment.  This whole time, I was comparing each burrito to my favorite burrito of all time, the carne asada burrito at Mondo in Santa Clara.  And I decided that I'd rather have that burrito than a Mission burrito.  It was fun while it lasted, and I'm sure I'll be back for a Mission burrito again!", "author": "Nadeem A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-16", "description": "2 stars for the salsa (which is good) and the service, which was fine.\n\nThe answer to the question that many of you are wondering after eating here and wondering how this place gets voted the best burrito in SF may lie somewhere in the clientele that frequents the place and the people who do things like vote for best burrito.\n \nI have a general rule when eating in an ethnic eatery in SF: if there are not people of that ethnicity eating at the establishment, it most likely isn't authentic, is usually pricey, and is not typically good. \n\nI imagine (just my observation as a native Californian of Mexican decent) that Papalote is popular among people who are a) not from California/San Francisco or any state that borders Mexico b) have never had good Mexican food or c) lack taste buds.\n\nMy observation and 2 cents below: \n\n1. Papalote does one thing well: salsa.\n\n2. The chips are store bought dry and stale.  Fried tortilla strips = not that hard to make. But hey they are free. (But are they really at $9 for a burrito?)\n\n3. The pollo asada (chicken) burrito I had was bland and tasteless. Chicken had some sort of dry (emphasis on DRY) rub on it to give it \"flavor.\" I ordered my burrito with no rice (because that's how you do it) so I had a chance to get some beans which were ok when drenched in the house salsa.\n\n4. My girlfriend ordered a VEGETARIAN burrito which was MOSTLY RICE and even included some grill CHUNKS OF BURNED MEAT. Obviously, this Mission establishment caters to mostly non-Latinos, many of whom (just a stretch since this is San Francisco we are talking about) are vegetarian. However, they do not separate or clear their grill for vegetarian orders. Minor to me since I eat meat but the GF, not so happy.\n\nTo bring it back around to the \"best burrito in SF,\" Papalote is what I call a \"gentrification joint.\"  With the influx of non-Latinos into a traditionally Latino neighborhood, we see more and more places pop up that water down the \"tradicional,\" you know, to keep the neighborhood \"authentico\" and \"diverse\" with its new inhabitants. In come things like \"voting for best you fill in the blank.\"\n\nI have no advice for Paplote because they have found a niche and have even expanded into--surprise!--the NoPa neighborhood. \n\nThe best burrito in SF they are not. To get that, you now have to venture way past the \"best of\" signs further out in the Mission and find that little place where meat is still slow cooked, beans are painstakingly prepared for days, tortillas come fresh off the grill, peppers marinate forever, and the abuelita behind the counter has trouble understanding you when you make you order in English.", "author": "dude m."}

Is the salsa delicious? Absolutely. That's about all I can say.\n\nMy gripes:\n1) You can't \"mix and match\" your tacos - meaning, if you want to try two kinds of meat, you have to end up with 4 tacos. See, typically I go to taquerias and get 2 or 3 tacos, each with a different protein so I can sample. Much to my dismay, when I asked about this the nice lady said I have to get the 2 tacos.  That's kind of crappy.\n\n2) The chile verde was pretty bad.  Despite having some heat, it was otherwise bland from the flavor side.  The pork was fake-tender. By that I mean, you could break of pieces easiily with a fork, but it was still dry. Clearly it had been simmering for too long in too high of heat. Even I, the home cook, know this - poor technique in the kitchen.  The scary part? I asked the cashier if she recommended the chile verde or the chicken mole, and she said chile verde. I'm terrified of how crappy the mole might be.\n\n3) The tacos come covered in lettuce and tomatoes. What?  Why? There's so much of it too. I appreciate wanting to promote eating veggies and all, but I came here to eat a taco - with meat.  Not ok.\n\n4) Guacamole - was also bland. I had to add some salt. There was no limey zip, and I'm not even sure how but I didn't really get the flavor of avocado. \n\n5) Service - When the gentleman brought out my tacos, I asked about my side of guac. He looked at the ticket in his hand, which I also saw, and it clear said \"Chile Verde, Guacamole.\" He seemed very confused. My friend also pointed out that on her (separate) order, she had asked and paid for 2 extra salsas and those were not brought out either. He seemed confused and flustered. Eventually we got everything we needed but it wasn't like he was bringing out multiple plates of food at once. He literally was only carrying my tacos in one hand and the ticket that clearly stated \"Guacamole\" in the other.  Also, on an unrelated note - flies in the air. Not ideal.\n\nThis place is probably great for vegetarians/vegans who otherwise can't get Mexican food, but for us meat eaters, don't bother.  \n\n2 stars for the salsa. Good news is you can buy jars of that stuff and never eat anything else here. That's probably my go-to plan from now on.", "author": "Naoko M."}

The Grilled Chicken Burrito (with black beans, rice, and \"salsa\") is pretty bland.  Instead of their signature salsa, inexplicably you'll find a disappointing stand in of watery diced tomatoes and onions.  The Grilled Veggies Burrito is a misnomer as it barely had any zucchini.

Now I make sure to always have a couple jets stocked at home to have whenever I get a takeaway burrito (from anywhere!). So yeah, definitely try their salsa, and then take some to go. \n\nAs for the food, I came here first with some friends to get burritos for lunch. Let's face it, this place is small! And at lunch on a Saturday, it was busy. It definitely felt cramped as we are waiting in line and then being shuffled to a table. One of their workers was coordinating seating to for people at the right tables so everyone could sit. That being said, there was enough room, we didn't have to wait, and the tables were plenty spacious. \n\nThe chips and salsa were great, and the burritos were really good.

I'm usually a super burrito gal, so this plain version was new to me. The Mexi-Pino was still so tasty and I venture to say better as a \"classic\" because you can taste the flavor of the adobo.

Thank god for free water! It was nice and cold too. They take orders ridiculously fast and the cashier was very nice, so there wasn't much waiting in line time to decide what to get.\n\nThankfully this place was pretty standard Mexican so it wasn't too hard to go for the steak burrito to go. I don't live too far from here so I figured I'd rather eat it at home. The price point was pretty standard, although a lot of places like Taqueria Canc\u00fan are cheaper and (spoiler) better.\n\nWhen I opened the bag and took out the well sized burrito I was pretty happy, but still nothing out of the ordinary so far. Underneath the burrito I realized that the nacho chips (which are complementary like many burrito places in SF) were just lying out at the bottom of the paper bag, which was kind of disappointing. After a struggle to tear the paper bag in a way that would make it a suitable plate for the chips, I was only disappointed to find their spicy rendition of nacho cheese dip to be... well, mediocre. But complaining about a complementary side, maybe I'm just spoilt.\n\nThe burrito, this is where my still to be four star rating for the place dropped to three. It wasn't bad by any regard, but since burritos are quite the large food to tackle, I like them to be good to the very last bite. Unfortunately the first of this one told me this was going to be a challenge, albeit not a hardest one. It was rolled somewhat loosely, I didn't how ridiculously thin the tortilla was, and the ingredients weren't causing the orgasm in my mouth that other burritos have caused me to expect. I actually even payed the extra dollar or two it takes to get a super burrito with the guac, something I usually love, but something was just missing.\n\nBeing in the mission, unless you're ridiculously hungry and right outside this place, I'd reccomend going to one of the many other burritos around.", "author": "Mayank G."}

With the 7x7's best burritos in SF article to my coworker constantly dipping his broccoli in their salsa, I was just aching to eat here.\n\nI tried both a Carne Asada and a Camarones burrito, super'ed.  The shrimp pieces were small and really fresh.  The carne asada was a hit or miss depending on the piece I got.  I had initially picked out a piece and that was dry but when eating it with the burrito, it tastes pretty tender and fresh.  I like that even though the pieces are big, they rip apart easily.  \n\nUnfortunately, by super-ing it, you get grilled veggies (bell peppers?) in it and it doesn't really go.  Also, the flavor in the burrito was weak so the salsa is quite necessary.  Now the hype about the salsa is interesting because it is good and it is really spicy but the texture is weird.  It's very blended and not quite smooth but not quite chunky... a strange in between.\n\nSalsa comes from two places:\n1. Made in this restaurant - $5.99 \n2. Made somewhere else but still the Papalote recipe - $6.99\n\nI've had both and I would say #2 wins the initial taste test.  #1 still isn't bad though.\n\nSimilar to traditional Mexican restaurants, you can help yourself to pickled jalapenos but they have WHOLE pickled jalapenos here.

Some bites were all rice, some bites were all steak, some were all guac. The burrito came with chips and salsa. The chips were a little bland and the salsa was too mild for this spice-loving girl. Given that Papalote is right down the street from me I will probably give it another try, but I can't say I'll be craving this burrito like I do the Carne Asada San Francisco style at Tacko.", "author": "Angela C."}

You see, you have just steadily let yourself go.  At first, I started to ignore the warning signs.  The declining food quality, the increasingly shabby dining room, the non hygienic bathroom.  I chose to let all of this go because of that delicious, delicious salsa!  But now I am afraid, my last visit was the final straw.  I don't know if the Bobby Flay throw down went to your head or what, but the Papalote experience is just not the same anymore.  \n\nDuring my last few visits, I have become increasingly aware of the strange 'renovations' to your dining room.  Not only have you oddly mixed Ikea modern with Mission Shabby, but you have also managed to cut off the dining room making the lineup for takeout awkward and claustrophobic.  You have also managed to ruin the one thing that made your restaurant hip and eclectic, a naked, no-frills mason-jar filled lovingly with the best salsa this side of La Paz. This 'insiders experience has since been cheapened by adding a label and hawking it by the register (as well as Whole Foods)!\n\nAnd so for these very reasons, I must move on Papalote.  We had a torrid love affair for many, many years, and had some great times, but the fact of the matter is that I am simply no longer in love with you.\n\nLa Cumbre and El Farolito, how you doin'?", "author": "Trent L."}

I might have hyped this place up too much and I was a little bit disappointed. One mistake I made was to order something that the reviews were suggesting. Papalote is known for their Triple Threat Burrito and have high reviews on the prawn burrito, but I went with the Marinated Tofu. Typical me for always doing something different from the general population. The burrito was good, but it wasn't as good as the regular chicken burritos that I have had elsewhere. It feels like it's missing some sauce. It was really nice that Papalote is so generous with their ingredients and packed the burrito with beans, rice, sour cream, gracamole, and meat, but it tasted a bit on the dry side.\n\nTheir chips and salsa is good. Their house salsa is definitely their specialty. They sell them in jars at the restaurant. If I were to return, I will stick with what people like and try the prawn burrito.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Whoevers idea it was to put Chicken Adobo in a burrito is quite amazing in my book.\n\nThe Chicken Adobo Burrito is not on the menu but was recommended by friends who've been to Papalote before and boy I'm glad they did. I can seriously eat Chicken Adobo plain and having it in my burrito was perfect. The portions here kinda big for a small girl like myself so I split half a burrito- great advice for those sharing a meal. Plus you get chips and dip complimentary before your meal! Be careful the dip is a bit spicy, but addicting.\n\nPair your meal with a Jarritos or Pure Cane Sugar Cola!\n\nThough the food was delicious, our service kinda sucked to be honest. Half of the table got their food and decided to wait for the other half to receive their food. Probably 10 minutes later we asked 2 waiters about our food and said they'd check the kitchen only to come back saying it was coming out. The other half the table was famished beyond words to wait longer and finished. Then our food finally came out ... with no apology either. Huh?

But it could be oh-so-good. Why would Bobby Flay challenge them if it wasn't? Don't do it! DO IT!\") I finally went  *hangs head in shame*\n\nThe bf & I ordered: 2 prawn tacos, 2 carne asada tacos (.99 cents extra to make them \"super), & two bottled drinks. Total: under $21--well that wasn't too painful at all! \n\nThe salsa is definitely unique--it is creamy without chunks of tomato. I tasted a lot of heat but not a lot of real, tomatoey flavor. It's a nice change from regular salsa. When the tacos arrived, we were surprised (not to mention disappointed) at how it is Fresh Mex instead of authentic Mexican. Zero grease, zero salt. It's very similar to La Salsa (maybe the lack of Latino patrons should have tipped us off...) There was nothing wrong with the flavors but it's obvious that this place caters to a specific demographic who's palates are not ready for some dirty, real, greasy Mexican goodness.

Well it didn't taste anything, it was dry and hard to chew. I could only taste the avocado. The burrito tasted too bland, I had to put hot sauce and mix it with the sauce they gave me to have some flavor into the burrito, but still it didn't taste any good either. I wasn't even able to finish it. Honestly this place reminds me of Chipotle- Americanized Mexican food. I rather go to Chipotle since their meat has more flavor. Never am I going back to this place.

Erm, must be the alkie? :X  \n\nIt's 1 AM on Thursday Morning and while I should be \"attempting\" to sleep, my eyes are glued to  an episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\". For 26 minutes, my mouth was salivating at the thought of meeting the \"Triple Threat\" one day; needless to say, it was another sleepless night. *sigh*\n\nMy friends and I came here yesterday at 12ish and luckily, we came at just the right time before it started getting busy.\n\nFOOD:\n*Chips & Salsa (#46 on the 7x7 list): The chips were slightly warm, thin, and crisp with just the right amount of salt. Ahhhhh, the salsa....the BEST freaking salsa EVER! The salsa was emulsified to perfect creamy consistency. As it hits your palette and moves around your mouth, you can taste all the fresh ingredients (the charred tomatoes, garlic, onion, chilies, and cilantro) sink into your taste buds. It had the perfect blend of savory, smokiness, acidity, and fiery kick to it! This is the ONLY thing that lives up to the HYPE!\n\n*Triple Threat (super w/ sour cream & guac): HOLY MOLEY! $20 for a freaking burrito?!?!? The burrito was a regular size burrito that you would find from any taqueria. It was generously filled with rice, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. The rice was al-dente and the chicken breast, carne asada, and shrimp were perfectly grilled, well-seasoned, and tender. The sour cream and guac are a must as it added a slight tartness and creaminess to balance out all the flavors.\n\n*Ode to Poleng Adobe Burrito: FAIL! If you're expecting the garlicy, peppery soysauce vinegary taste that makes your lips pucker type of Adobo, you will be sadly disappointed. The chicken lacked all the components of what an adobo should be and was not well-seasoned. Errr, where was the garlic friend rice? The rice used was the standard burrito rice. The tortilla was the only thing that stood out. It was different from the typical tortilla used; it was crisp and flaky. All in all, the burrito lacked any real flavor and was quite dry b/c there was no sauce or salsa in it).\n\nDRINKS:\nPapalote has a selection of sodas, juices, and Mexican beer. I have to note that their refrigeration system was not working properly yesterday as our drinks were room temperature.\n\nPRICES:\nWAY OVERPRICED! A regular burrito is about $8 and an extra $1 to make it super (sour cream and guac). The size of their regular burritos are quite small (approx 7' and 2.5' in diameter) compared to other taquerias in The Mission.\n\nAlthough the Triple Threat was good; it was NO where near a $20 good! To me, Mexican food is just like Chinese food; you shouldn't have to pay much to get good-tasting food. And, I really think the \"hype\" has allowed Papalote to capitalize on its customers by charging such ludicrous prices. \n\nSERVICE:\nOrder your food at the counter, grab a number, and the server will being you your order when it's ready. The chips and salsa came first and it took about 15 minutes to get our burritos.    \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery funky hipster type feel with the bright red walls with colorful panting and reggae music playing in the background. \n\nPARKING: \nDifficult street parking around Valencia and Mission streets. However, Guerrero street seemed to have some available non-metered spots. \n\nWould I return? I would only return for the chips and salsa. Other than that, Papalote is WAY OVERYHYPED and OVERPRICED. I say bottle the salsa and bring it with you to the other taquerias like Pancho Villa or El Toro where you can get a freshly grilled steak and shrimp burrito for 2/3 of the price.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Come Sunday, after work, the wifey and my youngest picked me up from work and went straight here. Ordered three Adobo Burrito to go and was expecting something awesome. However, it fell kinda flat since it was missing the fat. \n\nDude....you need to add the fat to get some flavor in here. The protein was on the lean and dry side too, and it was just OK. The saving grace was the Hot Sauce that came with the chips.

Sure it's expensive, but it's way better than Frontera or any of that other hoity-toity stuff that tries to pass for gourmet salsa. Based on the quality of their salsa, I was very excited to try the Papalote restaurant in the Mission today!\n\nPapalote is a small restaurant on a largely residential block of 24th street. It's conveniently located a couple of blocks from the 24th & Mission BART stop and also a block away from a good friend's house. If I'd known it was this close, I would have gone numerous times already! Inside the restaurant are a handful of tables next to a large window which offers a good people watching view of the street outside. You order at the counter up front and then take a number and sit down.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and rice. The burrito was about average in size, but that's ok because I don't like overeating these days. The contents were very tasty with plenty of grilled beef and flavorful rice and beans. I only had one funny bit of gristle in the burrito, so I would call that a rousing success for the Bay Area. They also give you tasty chips and a cup of their salsa before the meal. HOWEVER, if you want more salsa to go with your meal, it costs an additional fifty cents for each refill. WTF?! Most places load you up on salsa without an additional charge. This is something they really should consider since it seems a little chintzy of them.\n\nMy two lunch friends had the pork chile verde tacos and the fish burrito. The tacos looked good, but seemed to be piled high with garnish which seemed a little weird. If I order the tacos in future, I'll get them with just meat and tortilla. The fish burrito looked like a winner and my friend swears by it, so I'm either getting that next time or trying the machaca which is hard to find in the Bay Area!\n\nPapalote is a very clean, stylish restaurant. Food gets delivered quickly and the staff are all super nice.

Since I was meeting a friend for lunch, I decided we would check them out.  The place is cute, small, and very clean.  You walk in and are immediately in front of a large wall mounted menu and the registers. \n\nFor lunch I decided to try the grilled tofu tacos.  I was surprised when they came out and there was only one tortilla underneath.  It was difficult to eat as a taco since they were loaded up with vegetables and tofu.   Overall they were good but the tofu was a bit odd (I've never had grilled tofu before).  My friend was happy with his carne asada tacos and promptly devoured them.\n\nWe ordered the guacamole appetizer which was far too large for two people.  If you have four it would be more appropriate.  We left about half of our guac in the bowl (I hate letting deliciousness go to waste).\n\nThe price was appropriate for tacos ($6.25 for two).

I ordered the Super (which is sour cream, cheese, guacamole for 99 cents extra) Pollo Burrito (grilled to order chicken breast) for about $8.50 plus tax. It was a hefty size. Not huge not small (maybe 6 or 7 in long, 4 in thick). The chicken wasn't too dry (which is good for me) and the extras were somewhat adequate, but for my personal taste I would've wanted more guacamole and cheese :p The tortilla itself was slightly crispy, not too soft at all which is what I'm used to. And the burrito was wrapped nicely, but if you aren't in the mood to pig out in public, they provide you with knife and fork to eat it more in a more domesticated fashion :p \n\nThe ambiance: almost cramped. The ordering space is quite small. You walk in, and the registers are right there. There's a sign saying wait to be seated, but I don't think that should be there because you actually look for seating and seat yourself. It's cafeteria style seating. We went around 2-3pm ish and it was busy. We were lucky to find three spots open. \n\nWhen you sit, someone serves you and each of your party with yummy homemade? tortillas and spicy salsa. And if you don't feel like spending extra money on a soda, they offer \"get it yourself\" water and small washable cups in the corner. I can vouch that they're clean.

My other friend said that they were featured on a show by Bobby Flay on the Food Network and Papalote won the challenge....... Ok. Let's go! The food must be really good then.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I was walking up the hill on 24th. I remember seeing Papalote. There was no sign..... It looks like they are renovating... the only way to find this place if you had the address because there was a paper on the window with the address... The inside looked like it was being renovated as well.\n\nWhen we entered, we ordered at front. One of my friends wanted In-N-Out instead, so we ordered to-go.... but one of my friend's burrito took 20 minutes to be finished, so my other friend had to order from here. We also decided to stay and eat at the restaurant because we were not going anywhere else for a while, and we were STARVING.\n\nI ordered a rice and bean burrito on a whole wheat tortilla. I was super happy to see the have the whole wheat option. Not many places I go to have that option of tortillas. It was a pretty good size. Not too big or small. Well... it was actually too big for me. I ended up saving a third of it for later. I also got complementary chips and salsa with the order.\n\nAbout the salsa.... OMG IT WAS SO GOOD! It wasn't too spicy, but it had enough of a kick for me to enjoy it. It was perfect.\n\nBy the way, my burrito was really good, but it wasn't super tasty. The pinto beans I had were kind of dry. I can see myself coming here for a burrito... but not anytime soon... Or at least when I come back to the city one day. I don't live here... :(\n\nI was really satisfied with the burrito.

They take card.  Woot! For a moment, after I stepped in, I panicked because I thought I wouldn't be able to get a burrito since I hardly ever carry around cash.  But phew!  They do!  And then I said to myself, \"Oh silly, of COURSE they take card!  Gringo burrito place, duh!\"  \n\n2. I got a chicken mole super burrito for $7.93.  The mole was pretty good, as was all the other fillings:\n+ Cheese = MELTED, I approve.\n+ Black Beans = Soft and flavorful, good job there!\n+ Chicken = Shredded and tender perfect chompos for me to eats!  \n+ Guac = Mush! Texture, flavor, aesthetically pleasing.  Who doesn't like avocados?\n+ Rice = Soft, just right. \n\n3.  Good location, close to the 24th/Mission BART.  Even though I work in the FiDi, I can easily BART here and back during a lunch break and still have time to spare.  \n\n4.  Hipster paradise indeed.  There were two very nice girls in front of me, with cute bags and flowy skirts and interesting hair.  Such a nice, appropriate place for the hipsters, hippies, and happy white people.  \n\n5.  So, I tried their chips and salsa finally.  It's on that 7x7 \"100 Things to Eat in SF\" list.  There must be something wrong with my taste buds.  The chips were not that great, nothing special.  You want awesome chips?  Tropisueno's got awesome chips!  The salsa, however, was bangin'.  Unfortunately, I can't take the heat, and one tiny taste set my entire mouth on fire.  It was good, yes, but painful.  \n\nSo, why the 3.5 stars?  This review seems to suggest a solid 4, maybe more, right?  Well, I mean, I definitely LIKED my burrito, but it was just...not totally 100% there. . .  \n\nYou know what I mean?  Imagine meeting a person, or attending a class, and even though he/she/it is perfectly fine and nice and all, you're just not blown away.  \n\nAnd you could go either way, go with it, or not.

I thought I was over Mexican food since Mexican food is so overexposed in the Mission, but Filipino fusion helps breath new vida into it.  The non-Filipino fusion food is good, but not by as large a margin.\n\nAdobo Burrito: This was my reason for coming here and it did not disappoint.  The chicken was even more fall apart tender than the traditional Mexican options.  The adobo flavor was thankfully high on the garlic, soy and pepper while not getting overly vinegary.  No beans because that would have been weird.  The garlic rice was a nice touch to add an extra bit of zing.  What a great, portable way to enjoy Filipino food!  Now if only they'd do pork adobo...\n\nChicken Mole: Chocolatey and pasty, this is pretty decent mole.  The chicken was a tad firm, perhaps they should stew it longer?\n\nRefried Beans: I liked the concept of refried black beans because pintos usually get all the refrying action.  Heavier than the pinto though.\n\nRice: Standard.  Was disappointed with my side since the garlic rice in the adobo burrito was way better!\n\nChips & Salsa: Pretty nice for free (with purchase of a meal).  The chips were standard, but the salsa was great!  Smoky and creamy.  No wonder why people rave about this compared to the more standard varieties all over the Mission.", "author": "Adam B."}

It was a little more pricey than most places at that time, but it was exceptional quality. The Brothers who ran it were generally around and involved in the operation.

And I'm talking about a quality cut of meat, charred with epic flavor.\n\nAbout a month or so ago they changed the cut they use and how they prepare it, so now it's just another typical burrito with questionable meat - very grizzly with mediocre  flavor. I can get the equivalent for $7 elsewhere. \n\nThe change was immediately apparent but I continued to go there for my weekly burrito. After about month or so of this, no more I say.  I hoped they'd finally realize how inadequate  there carne asada now is, but no luck - the low-quality meat seems to be here to stay. So disappointing. I'll just have to find my new favorite elsewhere.\n\nAlso, on a side note: what's the deal with piling all the meat on one end of the burrito? I know they're really busy back there but spreading it out would take about 0.5 extra seconds per order.\n\nAgain, so disappointed to give up Papalote.

It's not too far from the house and has been feautured on multiple food channel shows.  I figured it would have to blow away the other local burrito shops.   I was sadly disappointed.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  The food is pretty good. It's fresh and tasty.  The burritos are smaller than most other places, which doesn't really bother me.  At my normal burrito place my favorite is a  baby super burrito.  In reality, it's just about the same size as the burrito I had here.  However, at my normal place it is only half the price, and comes with a bit of spice.\n\nSo they are known for their salsa here, but I'm not quite sure why.   If you like salsa try Taqueria Guadalajara  8 different kinds to choose from and it blows this place away.  Here, there was only one choice.. and with my 2 entrees I received 2 small containers of salsa with my order.  I asked for a third ..and was told that would cost .55 extra.   I took my entrees to go .. I have plenty of salsa at home.  The salsa which was rather orange in color, lacked spice.   It tasted good and  the first container was gone before I was halfway through my burrito. Did I mention it was a SMALL burrito.  At most places, I get the hot salsa... at really good places I'll take the 2nd or 3rd hottest salsa as my main salsa and have a few drops of the hot salsa on my main dish.  \n\nHere I could drink the salsa like a milkshake. They sell it by the jar, but truthfully I'd rather have salsa that I can only take in small quantities.   \n\nThen there's the prices,  This meal literally cost $8 more than my local place.  That's nearly double the price .. and if I had bought the proper amount of salsa definitely more than double the prices at my local place.  What amazed me is the place was packed... true, I don't think there was a single Central or South American in the place besides the wait staff. But there was a line of the whitest people you will find in the Mission at nearly 9pm on a Wednesday night. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are a vegetarian.. the choices were good.  I'd still pick El Burrito Express over this place for the vegetarian options, but that's a long way to go from this neighborhood.  They had an eggplant burrito, a tofu burrito, and a few other options.  Far better than the bean and rice burritos vegetarians are stuck with at most places.", "author": "Cat C."}

Now, I know prawn burritos are always more expensive than say Carne asada but at $11.25 for a prawn super, it should be pretty darn good. \n\nPapalote got right what many places don't - flavor.  The ingredients and recipes were good. What didn't work for me was composition. They were nice and offered to cut the burrito in half because the cashier realized we were sharing. When the burrito came out it looked great. \n\nIt was the right size, had been toasted after rolled (good call!) but something was missing. Prawns for me, rice for my wife. \n\nIn my half of the burrito, there were no prawns. I took it to the counter (after unrolling on a search for shrimp) and told them there was nothing there. My wife had found three inside her half. I asked them how many prawns come on a prawn burrito and the said 4. Now, if these were true jumbo prawns (8-10 count/lbs), that would have made sense. They seemed like regular size shrimp to me.  Plus they were put in whole instead of being cut in half which would have helped the composition. \n\nMy wife's half had primarily beans and prawns but no rice. \n\nA burrito is like a sandwich - very simple. But simple foods require precision to be REALLY good. It was sad that they skimped on the prawns and that the ingredients weren't balanced. They had a 4 star burrito in the making.

The next few columns to the right then have prices for exactly what dish you would like your first choice to be and then you move on to picking additional ingredients. The additional($) ingredients are things like cheese and sour cream which come standard at most taquerias so the burritos that would be around $6 at those other places are $10 here.\n\nI got the soyrizo burrito partly because I heard bad things about the \"Veggie\" burrito here (Potato, carrot, mushroom) and partly because I wanted more flavor than a bland veggie burrito I've had at way too many other places. I added cheese, sour cream and guacamole to my burrito and there was plenty of all three in it. The burrito itself was flavorful and filling so I definitely wasn't disappointed with my choice.\n\nSo..the sauce. The sauce is slightly spicy, smokey, and delicious.

In a town like SF where there are plenty of Mexican/burrito joints, methinks this place is totally overrated. But I just had to try it and experience it for myself, esp if they threw down Bobby Flay...\n\nThe place is a little small but the tables turn pretty quick, as it's not really a place where you stick around and chit chat with your friends without getting dirty looks from ppl waiting for a table. Props for having an effective system waiting for a table which allows you to preorder your food and having it arrive shortly after being seated.\n\nOverall, the meal was pretty disappointing. The only good thing really, were the loaded nachos.  \n\nThe chips that came with the burritos tasted dry and stale. The touted salsa, was underwhelming. That's what I really didn't understand. There was no real taste, except a somewhat mild lingering taste. Sad to say, all of us added a little salt to enhance the flavor. I guess we all expected a little more. \n\nChile Verde burrito was not at all what I expected. It had no heat at all, but rather sweet. The rice had a weird texture, it felt almost al dente?? Palatable by me given that I added the slime colored habanero sauce they had on the table (i thought habaneros were orange??), but a total thumbs down by the hubby, who usually eats most everything.\n\nWe've had better burritos, both in size and taste, elsewhere in the city and for a better value as well.

My friend talked me into buying a jar of it on my way home, one of the best decisions I made all day. It's fresh with a definite kick, so beware if you're sensitive to spice. Also, highly recommend getting your burrito/taco to-go and enjoying it in Dolores Park when the weather's nice.\n\nSide note, they also serve Mexican cokes (pure cane sugar=the real stuff) as well as a wide range of cold beers to enjoy with your delicious Mexican entree of choice.", "author": "Emily S."}

I didn't feel like eating tacos (I always eat them in LA so I wanted something a little different) and I saw the mole and I knew I wanted it immediately. I love mole, I love the sauce, sweet, salty and delicious. And I got a nice hochata, I love horchata (although I wish they gave me a little more ice since it was pretty hot in the restaurant!). My cousin got the carnitas verde (I think- well it certainly had the verde sauce). \n\nI didn't realize how big the portions were until they gave us the plates, but it was huge and it came with rice and beans, mmmmm. They also gave us generous portions of warm tortillas. My cousin and I immediately dug in, things were bursting out of our tacos and the couple who just sat down next to us, waiting for their food were staring at us. I have to say I liked my cousin dish because it had a little heat to it, some spice, but the chicken mole was pretty good too. I wish I had more room in my stomach to finish it all or could take it to go if I was staying longer, but unfortunately I couldn't finish it all (yes I was disappointed in myself).\n\nI highly recommend people to grub here if they get a chance.

Coming from South Bay, I admit I'm kind of a Mexi-snob. Well Papalote...I gave you a chance with the hype, salsa, and big burrito on my plate ready to take in bite by bite.\n\nI got the Carne Asada super burrito, and I'd say the burrito itself was a 3. The burrito was as flat as a pancake, and it was empty and soft inside. I like my burritos dense, not sagging in my hands like its a chore to feed me. The only thing that redeems this place to a 4 star rating is their salsa. I wouldn't call it salsa, I'd call it sauce. The flavor completes any burrito, just try it to understand how they can get away with charging several dollars for a mason jar full.\n\nNOTE: for those of you out there who know what 'Orange Sauce' is from San Jose, this is the closest thing you're gonna get in the city. Hell, I think this sauce might even be better than La Vic.\n\nAnyway, props to Papalote for keeping the Mission charm. Dig the vibes from the art in there. Nice location in the Mission near BART.

The chips and creamy salsa were different and good in it's own way.

You couldn't even convince me to try another restaurant due to my traumatic \"taqueria\" experiences in the East Bay. Why not just stick to what works, right?\n\nSo I went with 2 friends for lunch last Sunday by one of their recommendations. You go into a small, cramped area with registers, order your food, pay and then sit down. The whole restaurant is encased in a small square room packed with tables and chairs. In the corner they have a roll of aluminum foil for your leftovers, and a self-serve water thingy (? brain isn't working well today) and a stack of cups for the cheapskates.  My friend (who made the recommendation) bought a whole jar of salsa that she started raving about. Now, I'm from Texas, and salsa means watery, tomato-y and pico-de-gallo-y. What she was holding in a jar was thick, almost creamy-looking red sauce... kinda like marinara. Honestly I was a little put off and couldn't imagine it being THAT good.\n\nWe sat down to small bowls of thick, crunchy tortilla chips and tiny ramekins of said salsa. Peeps, this salsa's legit. I'm not too picky when it comes to salsas (though I'm used to the Tex-Mex kind)... but it was amazing. And spicy!! Just the flavor that they pack into every bite! I should've written this review when the flavors were fresher on my mind, but it's been almost a week and I've forgotten, sorry! Just know that it's legit.\n\nI ordered a tofu burrito (because I've been on a vegetarian kick lately), and I gotta say that I really didn't miss the absence of meat. The tofu was flavored well, the beans were awesome (I ordered the refried black beans, and they tasted lard-i-licious even though they were vegetarian, too). I could only finish half of the burrito, but I took the other half home. It was the perfect, filling meal on that cold, rainy day. Just wished I could've taken a burrito-food-coma nap, and it would've been a perfect Sunday.\n\nIt just seems like a higher-class, healthier burrito than El Farolito.

They are known for their sun-dried tomato salsa, but it is somewhat one-dimensional in my opinion.  It lacks the freshness of salsa (they sell it by the bottle), and it has too much American jazziness to it.\n\nThe best thing by far is the fish, in any form.  The white wine and butter sauce is exquisite, and the fish is extremely moist and tender.  The quesadilla option is a bit pricey, though.\n\nThe chicken mole kind of stunk.  The sauce was pretty heavy on the sweetness; it could have used more chiles.  The chicken was not super moist, and it was $13.  The chicken burrito was a bit dry, but the chile verde pork was better.  The CV had a tangy, hearty sauce that paired well with the tender pork.\n\nThere is nothing to really rave about here, but I guess it is worth a shot if you are into unique salsas and stuff.

Tofu mole? grilled veggies? \n\nI nearly always get the soyrizo, sometimes with guacamole. Always AMAZING. And enormous for super-cheap. I work in the Financial District and have spent entire lunch breaks trekking to and from papalote to get an excellent burrito and get back in time to sit at my desk and eat while working -it's totally worth it. \n\nAnd the salsa. Did I mention the salsa? SO DELICIOUS. You can buy it by the jar at the store, or you can now buy it on-line for delivery. When I found this out, I sent the link to everyone I know, and they all reacted \"This is the best day of my life\". It's that good. \n\nWhile i've only ever gotten vegan burritos here, I've been told the non-vegan ones are also good. But can't really comment. \n\nTheir other location is also good. So good that when our office was in the Presidio, we would regularly drive over and get burritos for the whole office (~25 people). \n\nGo here!!", "author": "Sue A."}

I had a bit of confusion with the menu setup (they really could make that easier to read with little changes), but the girls behind the counter were helpful and friendly and pushed me in the right direction. I ended up getting a naked rice & beans burrito bowl and my companion got herself super nachos, both to go. The food came out less than five minutes later, and realizing we had far more to carry than we envisioned (with those bags of amazing chips tossed in on top) the counter-girls handed us a bag without charging us the silly ten cents. My only complaint is that I wish their packaging held up a little stronger. By the time we reached the park less than ten minutes later the beans of my bowl had soaked through part of their container and made for a pretty sloppy dish. Overall, both orders had a nicely balanced flavor to them though and no one aspect of the dish overpowered another.

Needless to say, I was already a little annoyed when I arrived...though it was nice to meet up with some of my friends (I digress).\n\nI walk in and WHOA...ok...the counter is now on the right, vs right in front of you when you walk in. I didn't see a menu on the wall (they actually hung it up when I sat down to eat), so I ordered from a printed post card looking thing that they had a stack of.\n\nI ordered a super prawn burrito and a horchata. Wait...what? No horchata? I had one last time I was...ok...nevermind. Give me an Orangina.\n\nIt was about 8:30 at this time, and the dining room was popping. There were open seats strewn about, but nothing really available to have three people (me and my two friends) sitting together. And what's this \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign have to do with anything? That's weird. I don't see any staff seating anyone.\n\nSo, I saw some built-into-the-wall countertops and we decide to pull some chairs up to it. \"I'm sorry, but you can't eat there.\" Says an employee of the place. So....hrm....maybe there should have been a sign. I'll admit I was thoroughly confused. We eventually waited for some other seats to open up (oddly, like 8 people left at the same time), and sit down. The table was still kinda dirty even though it was wiped down (food debris and what looked like some hair). I'm too hungry to care and brush stuff off with the number tag they give you with the order and I sit down.\n\nA few minutes later, they bring the food out. I eat, chat with my friends, then bail.\n\nExperience: 2 (\"Ermm....hurhmm)\nI would normally give a 3 to taquerias with their functional decor and spartan surroundings. But, the dirty tabletop, and counters that you can't eat on just didn't mesh well with my already annoyed mood. Yes, I'm sure my mood is influencing my rating here. But then again, even El Farlito with their plastic/cafeteria-style seating has clean table surfaces (every time I've been there). The bathroom, for the most part, is clean; save for all the patron-contributed art from pretty much floor to ceiling.\n\nValue: 2 (A little steep for what you get...)\nA prawn (all right, that's normally pricier) super burrito and an Orangina for $13-something? Really?\n\nFood: 3 (It's fine)\nThe prawns tasted a bit toasty/overcooked. But, I give them bonus points for having black beans. The portion is pretty on par with your standard Mission District burritos (read: big enough that a fork and knife are standard issue...though it's hand-holdable, still).\n\nOverall: 2.33 (Ugh...down to 2)\nI don't want to give this place a 2...as I had an okay experience here last time. But, when you go into an establishment, you don't want to feel worse than you did when you walked in. Granted I was already annoyed, but this experience made me more annoyed tonight. Maybe just my luck of the cards and perfect storm alignment of mistakes by the establishment. Yes, in Yelp terms \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"", "author": "Ellis A."}

They do a pretty big takeout business because of their small dine in space and their dedicated register for those takeout customers.  Menu is pretty straightforward, either burrito, taco, quesadilla, all with a healthy choice of different meats, tortillas and sides.\n\nI had the Carne asada that was voted and rated highly on 7 x 7 list of best Carne asada burritos in the city.  K had the shrimp burrito.  When we sat down, they brought us chips and salsa.  The salsa is this creamy roasted tomato salsa with a kick.  It was very different than I've tasted and was def a fan.  The burrito was a large size, mine was the \"super\" with guacamole, sour cream and cheese.  The Carne asada was actually very good, tender and tasty but the mush that they called rice ruined the burrito for me.  It just became this mix of poor textures. K was happy with her shrimp burrito and said it was flavorful, she didn't mind the rice as much as I did.\n\nIf I could take the Carne asada from papalote and put it into a el farolito burrito, I would be in heaven.

I ordered my food and sat down. When I got my burrito, I asked the person who served us if they can give me a fork and knife (which they should have gave in the first place) he says \"what?\" and i go \"can i have a FORK!\" and gives me a weird look. 5 mins later, still no utensils. So I go up to the cashier and ask for one, (same girl from earlier) and she just hands me the fork in a rude manner even tho I said \"thank you.\"\n\nANOTHER THING - i also ordered horchata. I thought they would have given it to me along with the burrito or when i paid but NOPE, nothing. So i went to the register AGAIN and asked the same server guy who DIDNT give me the fork for my horchata and he gave me the same weird look and spoke to other girl in spanish.

Unlike other taquerias whose burritos flavors are mushy and muddled, Papalote's burritos are flavorful and delicious - each ingredient stands out on it's own. \n\nA few tips:\n\n1) My fav is the prawn burrito. Get it super with cheese, guac, and sour cream. \n\n2) The salsa is totes amazeballs. You can even buy a jar of it to take home. \n\n3) Call in your order 10 minutes in advance to have your order ready when you get there!\n\n4) Even though it sounds enticing and delicious, forget the Triple Threat burrito on the menu.  It's $20 and has carne asade, prawns, and chicken, but is no larger than a normal burrito and not worth the premium price.  I suppose I'd pay a few bucks extra for the combination of meats, but it doesn't make sense to charge a ridiculous amount of money for a regular-sized burrito.  Maybe I ordered it on an off day, but it was the one and only time I've been disappointed with Papalote.", "author": "Jeffrey H."}

This time, I tried the Triple threat burrito, while my friend ordered the machaca.\n\nI had recalled on Food Network that the brothers who own Papalote entered their Triple Threat burrito into some competition and it won, so I figured - if I am going to give them one more shot, I might as well give them their best chance.\n\nFor $20, the burrito was ok.  It kind of laid there and acted bored.  For $20 for a burrito, I want a little more action - I just need a little more lovin' for that price ... for a burrito.\n\nI don't think they sell very many of them, because the shrimp actually had no flavor.  Yes - it was large - but size isn't everything in this case.\nInterestingly, my friend's machaca wasn't actually machaca at all, but chopped up carne asada.\n\nHis theory (he's Mexican) is that Papalote is for people who don't know what Mexican food is.

Apparently, you can call ahead and pick it up right away, which is what I should have done.  It's pretty tiny, you have to wait even longer for a table.\n\nMy theory about Papalote's excellent ratings:  Roughly half of San Francisco is vegetarian, if not vegan.  The vast majority of burrito places, even here, seem to think that a vegetarian burrito means \"beans and cheese only\" (recipe for an evening of stink if I ever heard one).  Therefore, Papalote gets amazing ratings from half of the city purely for using vegetables.  Like, real, fresh vegetables, which is nice, but not as nice as the reviews make it out to be.\n\nThat said, their mole burrito is delicious, and it was almost worth the wait.  Since I wanted both meat and veggies in it, they charged me close to $13.  It was enough for two meals, but still...$13 for a burrito of any sort seems a bit excessive, no matter how delicious.", "author": "Sydney H."}

The burrito was gigantic, and tasty, and a good half of it is still around for dinner.\n\nOverall, this isn't really a place you go to for ambience--even though it has it, and beer--but moreso for awesome food:\nFood: 5\nService: 4\nPrice: 4\n\nClearly, food carries the day.  I ordered a chile verde (pork) burrito, with guacamole and sour cream, on a spinach tortilla.  It was delicious, with the ingredients well mixed in the burrito (a big selling point).  I added a little of the well-spiced salsa provided with my chips to the burrito and it really hit the spot.  The pork was cooked that day, and fairly tender.  The guacamole wasn't spectacular in its own right, but mixed well with the flavors of the burrito.  And there was some form of pickled vegetable in the burrito that was just the right touch.  The burrito was gargantuan, though, so I brought most of it home.\n\nThe only detractors are as follows.  There isn't enough salsa to go around, and according to another review, you have to pay for extra.  Also, it may be that I was unreasonably hungry, but I felt the 10+ minutes I waited for my burrito was a bit more than needed, even for fresh ingredients.  Lastly, at $9.30 for a super burrito, there are cheaper places with quality that's just as good.\n\nNonetheless, it's scrumptious, plain and simple.  Worth going, worth the price.

BAD IDEA!\n\nwhat a waste of time and hype. First off, the 'triple threat' cost $20, seriously, 20 bucks for a damn burrito, not in this life time. \n\nSo, instead i was torn between the mole burrito or the chile verde. Per the cashiers recommendation, i chose the chili verde. While waiting i was brought some chips and salsa. \n\nHeard the salsa was great, what a disappointment. It is the better type, i think habanero; however, it just wasnt anything special. If you want a real good orange salsa, try Iguana in SJ, definitely the best. I mean my friends mom could make a better one in her sleep, and she probably has.\n\nBack to the point. well i was given the salsa with some chips, which were store bought (not the great house made ones at REAL mexican restaurants). Once my burrito arrived I asked for some more salsa, since I used the other on the chips they gave me. The worker told me I only get 1 salsa per order and I would have to pay if I wanted any more!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!? Youre telling me the salsa that came with my chips was the only salsa I got to use for both my super burrito and my dipping my chips? WAT A JOKE! \n\nany other legitimate mexican restaurant usually hands salsa out like its halloween or even keeps them in self serve so you can basically dip your burrito in before you eat, lol. Not this place, their are like the salsa nazis for some bland lame duck salsa. \n\nHavent even gotten to the burrito. So, i could barely even taste the green chili and the pork was rather dry and cut too large. I mean i have had chili verde cut that large before but usually its been simmered in sauce so long that it just melts in your mouth, not this one. Felt like I was eating over cooked chicken. \n\nOnly good marking this place gets is they allow the option of getting spinach tortillas and whole black beans.

The three of us all being foodies - talk of food was inevitable as dinner time approached us.\n\nJB mentioned a burrito place that had recently been featured on \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\".  Now, I like Bobby as a person more than a chef, and I do enjoy this show from time to time but I had missed this episode.  But my interest was piqued in learning that Bobby had lost to the \"triple threat burrito\" at Papalote, so we started walking to check the place out for dinner.\n\nWell, as we expected, there was a massive line of people wanting to try the place that had beaten the Iron Chef.  As it turned out, there were more people waiting for their placed order than wanting to order, so we were able to squeeze right through to the counter.\n\nAll three of us wanted the Triple Threat.  \nAll three of us gawked at the price: $20.\n\nTWENTY DOLLARS?\nThe first natural question was: how big is it?\nAnswer:  same size as the other burritos... that average out at about $7.50 in cost.\n\n*(looking around the room to make sure I'm on earth)*\n\nON WHAT PLANET DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?????????\n\nSame size - 1/3 portion of beef, chicken and shrimp....\nAlmost 3X in cost.\n\nFOR WHAT?\n\nForget that!  Do I have \"IDIOT\" written on my forehead?\n\nWe scored seating in the restaurant within 10 minutes, and that was good since our wait for the regular burritos would be over 30 minutes.\n\nOnce seated, we just paid $30 for a plate of fish tacos and a beef/chicken burrito, with a beer and a diet coke.  Examining the receipt, it became clear that we had been charged for fish tacos, a beef burrito AND a chicken burrito.\n\n(Annoying.)\n\nThe chips were decent, and their \"special secret sauce\" (salsa) was pretty good in concept but overly salted, and not quite what *I* want from \"salsa\".  Nonetheless, it was tasty.\n\nThe burritos arrive.\nRegular size.\nI was SO not a fan of the Monterey Jack cheese - in cold state, not melted - that they sprinkle on everything.  Yuck.  Took a bite of the chicken/beef burrito - and the only noteworthy thing was the chicken was well marinaded/seasoned.  The rest?  Unimpressive.  Overall, for the burrito, I'd have given it three stars.\n\nI tried the fish taco - and the fish was fresh and not deep-fried, the lettuce was crisp - but the cheese, as much as I tried to take it all off, ruined it for me.  If I had asked for no cheese - I would have given it three stars too.\n\nThere's a MUCH better burrito to be had at El Metate for a fraction of the cost and even better ambiance with better drinks and service, too.  ($5 for a burrito there - try it!)\n\nThe experience of eating at Papalote, due to the hype, was worth it.  The company made the whole night fun.  Perhaps, if we had been insane enough to splurge $20 to eat a burrito - my assessment would be higher.  But for a $20 burrito, I expect it to give me wings, and based on other reviews - nobody sprouted wings and took off.  It's unfortunate for the owners as they'd be making a WHOLE lot more money off the recent coverage if they charged $10 for the Triple Threat instead of attempting to price gouge their customers for $20.  Whatever number of Triple Threats they are selling right now for $20, they could sell 10X that amount had they charged $10.  Do the math.\n\nCoincidentally - upon arriving home later in the evening, the very episode of \"Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay\" came on TV and I watched it with the remnants of Papalote's burrito and fish taco in my stomach.\n\nBobby was as cute as ever, and based on ingredients alone, I'd have preferred his \"green burrito\".  That said, the two brothers were funny and seemed like nice guys.\n\nThey just happen to be out of their freakin' minds.\n\n$20 for a BURRITO?\nThat's just insulting.", "author": "Grace K."}

Can anyone tell me if ANY regular sized burrito is worth that much money?  Me thinks not!\n\nThe wait staff left a sour taste in my mouth.  Apparently they've become so crowded a hostess needs to seat you.  Fast food or restaurant, they can't decide.  Someone brings out chips and salsa and the food to your table.  The salsa wasn't very fresh tasting.  The worst part, the food took about a half hour to come out.  I get faster service at legitimate sit down restaurants.

But hey, I'll go along with the absurd price and fall into the tourist trap.  Turns out it's the customers who are the joke since it's not even that good...\n\nLike many others, I came to this place after watching Throwdown a couple days ago.  For those who want to come here for the Triple Threat burrito, the 1st thing you will notice is the $19.95 price which might be worth it if it used Kobe beef though I just wanted to try it once.  I think it might be less to just buy a prawn burrito, add chicken & carne asada, and make it a super though I'm not sure.\n\nI really do think this Triple Threat burrito is overrated, especially because of its price.  I found myself eating each of the meat separately because together it is over-seasoned with each of the marinade and sauce getting lost within each other.  Individually, the meat tastes great: perfectly grilled and marinated so well.  But together, there is just too much going on.  The secret sauce is good (maybe a rip off of La Vic's orange sauce) though, with some heat and tangy.  So it may be that it's better to just get a burrito with just 1 type of meat and hope it's not bland.  The food here is fresh though.\n\nThere are other places in the Mission where you can get just as good of a tasting, fresh burrito that's more authentic for half the price.. so I won't be coming back here.\n\nsmall dining area, so might not get a seat\nservice is good, but phone your order in so you don't have to wait a while\nparking isn't too hard to find, metered", "author": "John D."}

Papalote was the first place so far that hasn't left me feeling like that and I intend to go back frequently.  Reasons it was different than the others: \n1. HUGE menu that encompasses vegans, vegetarians (GREAT tofu!), and people who love lots of meat.\n2. Awesome mole- not spicy, so it might not satisfy some people, but it is so creamy and rich I don't see how anyone could complain. \n3. Free chips and salsa when you sit down but the salsa isn't just your ordinary tomatoes and spices- instead it's more creamy and bursting with flavors (though pretty spicy). \n4. Huge burritos overflowing with ingredients. !!! (I just got really hungry writing this and want to go now)\n\nI'd probably go for 5 stars except that I wish there was more seating (though we only waited for less than 10 minutes for a seat, I felt like we were rushed towards the end when they clearly needed our table) and to add sour cream to a burrito is $2.25 (probably the only expensive thing on the menu but i really love my sour cream).", "author": "Luthien N."}

Oh yes. The food. \n\nThe salsa, as others have said, is unique and tasty. It's on the spicy side, blended, and a little bit creamy. I almost ate all of it with chips while waiting for my meal, but saved some. That turned out to be a good thing. \n\nMy portion was huge. It came with more chicken that I could eat at one sitting, partly because it was pieces of white meat that had gotten very dried out during the cooking process. The mole sauce was amazing -- rich, complexly flavored, chocolaty and just slightly sweet. However, it wasn't enough to moisten the chicken, and the dry meat combined with the uber-rich sauce made the dish hard to finish (and I didn't). \n\nThe house-made pinto beans were very bland -- and adding the leftover salsa helped, but only a little bit. Their tortillas are store-bought; I was a little disappointed by that. And the jicama salad was teeny-tiny. I could have used a lot more greens on my plate to offset the rich/dryness of the mole. \n\nMy date had the pork salsa verde; he said it was \"just OK\" and had similar blandness issues with his black beans. \n\nThe service was friendly and fast. \n\nSo, a few stars for tasty sauces, but several stars taken away for crowds, dry meat, and bland beans.

Now I've been eating here for awhile and was never aware of the Triple Threat until the episode with Flay. Told myself that I was gonna try it next time around instead of my usual Chile Verde. Looked at the online menu and there was no Triple Threat. Had the little lady call in an order for us. One TT and one Chile Verde. 25 mins later, I show up to pick up my order and the nice young lady at the counter tells me the total is $32. I looked up at the menu board and there's a small plastic sign taped to it that reads Triple Threat Burrito $19.99. WTF? \n\nIt was a Wednesday night and the place was unusually packed...alot more than usual. All of the staff members were wearing Throwndown shirts and they looked really overwhelmed by the crowds of people coming in and the telephone ringing off the hook.

I never tried a more thick and savory salsa before. \n\nThe lack of a lunchtime crowd and the colorful ambience made the whole experience enjoyable.

But I did have a seriously good burrito. \n\nI was in a rush so I got my burrito to-go, so I may not have had the full Papalote experience. The place was very crowded, even at 2 in the afternoon. It's a small space. If you're going for a sit-down meal, my guess is that you could have a wait, and you're going to be in a small room at a little table. If you're getting your order to go, you'll do some shuffling as people move past you carrying food and trying to pay for their orders. These things should not surprise anybody, you went out in search of a tiny delicious burrito place, right?\n\nAs this was my second lunch, I didn't have room to try more than one burrito. I went for the chili verde (pork). I am lame and do not like sour cream or guac, so I did not go super. If you are not lame, I hear you should do so. I was pleasantly surprised to find some wicked good salsa and tortilla chips in the bottom of my bag when I got on the BART.

I'd been curious to try out the famous burrito also, but knew I wasn't going to spend the $ on it on my own.  Cue Papalote for dinner tonight.  \n\nFirst off, the place is tiny.  Not in a bad way, but just in the way that you need to know before going there assuming you can just sit down.  Even fewer seats than El Farolito around the corner.  \n\nFoodwise, first we got the chips and salsa.  Off to a great start.  Good chips, tasty and complex salsa.  Nice and spicy, too, but maybe a touch too much for the average person.  Also not impressed they charge for another bowl of corn chips.  Boo for that one.\n\nNext up: the Triple Threat.  Of course that's what we had to try.  It arrives taking up more of a plate than is reasonable for a burrito.  But that's what it should do for $20.  And yes, it did take ~15 minutes to arrive, but that's ok in my book, since it was clear everything was freshly cooked.  Again, not your average burrito.  We had to taste each element independently, and each was fantastic on its own.  The shrimp were nicely spiced and well cooked.  The chicken was not too salty (a frequent problem I've noticed with seasoned chicken), and the steak was simple but awesome.  Guacamole was also very good, as were the refried beans.\n\nSo on the whole, we enjoyed the food, were astounded at the size of the portion, and would likely come back again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-14", "description": "I will preface this review by noting that we should have called ahead and asked about the amount of garlic in their food. My husband has an allergy, & there were a lot of items on the menu he couldn't eat. That being said, we decided to share the grilled veggie fajitas. We received a small bowl of chips and a tiny amount of salsa when we were seated--it is nice to provide that complimentary appetizer, although visually it's perplexing to see the salsa served in the same size metal container that mayonnaise or ketchup usually come in. If my husband had been able to eat the salsa, it certainly wouldn't have been enough. \n\nThe fajitas came out pretty quickly. The eggplant, zucchini & carrots were cooked a pleasant amount--not mushy. Lettuce, diced toms, and jicama (I think) all tasted fresh. The refried beans were good (though on the runnier end of the spectrum, just fyi) and the avocado slices were ripe and there were a good number of them. Wish the same had been true of  the tortillas! The order came with 3 clearly mass-produced, traditional-sized (i.e. taco, not burrito), flour tortillas--not enough to deal with even half of the food on the plate. Though they did not charge us extra when we asked for more, this just reinforced the impression created by the salsa--that they were trying to give us as little as possible. I suppose this could be a considered strategy to reduce food waste (which we would support!), though, if that's their rationale, it would help to explain that, and advise customers they need only ask for more. \n\nOverall, the food was fine, but not what I expected after hearing my sis talk about having seen this joint on TV, and seeing it mentioned in The Rough Guide to Cali. Could not shake the impression that you're not quite getting your money's worth. I may go back for the tofu mole everyone raves about, but probably only if I'm already in the neighborhood. I'll give 3 stars--because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that the absence of garlic really impacted the flavor of the food.", "author": "S H."}

The Triple Threat is HUGE (I think it should have been split among 3-4 people) and is $19.95. Sad. $20 burritos are always disappointing, but I couldn't not order it. It has prawns, chicken and beef in it. I was hesitant when I saw the chicken and I assumed it would be dry. It was not dry -- it was amazing instead.  \n\nThe salsa is amazing and I had to ask for my own because I didn't want to share anymore. It's spicy and is great on chips, the burrito, a plain flour tortilla....by the end I was just spooning it into my mouth. \n\nTheir other burritos are very reasonably priced ($6-8) and the portions are also very large. And it's only 99 cents to add sour cream, guacamole, and cheese!  The staff is really friendly despite how busy they are and always wipe down the tables between guests. yay. \n\nBobby Flay definitely has nothing on this place. I'm excited to go back.", "author": "Desiree L."}

It was the first time I had heard of a Chicken Mole option for a burrito - and it did not disappoint! \n\nHowever, the best part of the meal cannot be overlooked. The chips and salsa, which is served by the bowl to each person, is unmissable. Easily one of the best salsas I've had. It's smokey, garlicy and has enough kick to leave a little warmth in the back of the throat. So good.\n\nThe only downside I saw was the Triple Threat's price. Why, El Papalote, do you have a $20 burrito on your menu if it is roughly the same size as your other normal priced ones? I get that is filled with good meat, but damn! You better get a whole pound of shrimp in there for that price. \n\nI'd def. come back to El Papalote! Especially after beating Bobby Flay.", "author": "Amanda D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-09-20", "description": "An experience that has shaken my faith in the taste of my fellow San Franciscans. I just cannot understand the hype around this place. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd come back here- it's just not a good value.\n\nI've tried Papalote's food before. I have vague memories of eating there before I lived in SF and I'd had their takeout at a friend's house before. I don't remember being blown away by it, but I don't remember hating it either. Then again, I'm from Socal, so Mexican food is one category in which SF tends to let me down.\n\nFast forward to last night. We get there and, though the wait was somewhat long, the staff was so friendly and attentive that it wasn't a bother at all. \n\nI ordered the soyrizo burrito (not particularly adventurous, but it's what I was in the mood for). It was just okay, not any better or worse than what I might make at home using store-bought soyrizo. I wasn't unhappy with my meal, but I wasn't impressed. I'd rate it 3 stars on its own. \n\nMy girlfriend's burrito was a different story. She orded the lime-seasoned prawn burrito, but the seasoning was so bland that she actually thought they'd given her the wrong burrito! I asked the (very polite and attentive) waitress if perhaps they'd prepared her the shrimp burrito with the butter-wine sauce by mistake, but it turns out it was the right burrito, just not a very good one.*\n\nThe other problem, besides flavor, was the number of prawns. This was an $11 burrito that had 4 smallish prawns in it. I don't expect it to be loaded up like a shrimp burrito, but I eat a lot of Mexican food and I know what $11 should buy me. I am not a diner with a sense of entitlement, I just don't want to feel ripped off. 4 tiny prawns just isn't gonna cut it in a huge burrito. It was basically a beans, rice and cheese burrito w/ a cameo appearance by some prawns.\n\nThe biggest surprise though, was the salsa. Papalote is renowned for their salsa. So I found it surprising that a Mexican place famous for its salsa DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY SALSA WITH YOUR FOOD.... YOU HAVE TO BUY IT. **\n\nI am, as my obnoxious use of capital letters might indicate, dead serious: Salsa with your chips is free, but you have to pay to have salsa with your food. \n\nYou get a small (maybe 2 oz) cup of salsa with your chips. The place is popular, so you wait with that basket of chips for quite a while before your food comes. When your food arrives, it does not come with salsa. As it turns out, if you want salsa with your food you have two choices:\n\n(1) Eat your chips without salsa, so you can save the salsa for your food. C'mon son. This might not be objectively unreasonable, but it's unreasonable in light of custom: what Mexican restaurant expects you to eat chips without salsa?\n\n(2) Purchase more salsa to go with your food, at the rate of $0.50 per small cup.\n\nAdmittedly, $0.50 is not a big deal, but the idea that the only way to enjoy salsa with your food at this Mexican restaurant is to either pay extra or eat your chips without salsa just reeks of, dare I say it, arrogance. It's like they're so gassed up over people telling them how dope their salsa is that they think they're doing us a favor by letting us eat there. \n\nI get it. You're world-famous for your salsa. You sell the salsa separately in a jar. People would probably consume insane amounts of the salsa if you didn't regulate it somehow.... but is it going to kill you to give me one cup of salsa with my chips and one cup of salsa with my food? I mean, seriously, that just comes off as really, really cheap. I purchase a $30 fast-Mexican meal for two and have to pay extra to get the salsa? How is that cost not built into my $10 burrito?? \n\nThis is the kind of disregard for customer perspective that causes once-great businesses to fail. Not saying I see Papalote failing anytime soon, but it was a *huge* turnoff for me and I probably won't eat there again because of that last straw. Two people can eat at Rubio's (which actually has very good food for fast-Mexican), spend $20 and enjoy several cups of their delicious salsas or free! The mind boggles.\n\nAlso, the salsa is tasty, but not something I would have thought to rave about if Papalote wasn't already well-hyped for its salsa. Despite really wanting to love my dining experience at Papalote, I walked away not understanding what the fuss is about. So disappointed.\n\n______________\n\n* I love my girlfriend, but I'm not the type to give a place a shitty review just because she had a bad experience (see my review of Sushi Raw if you have any doubts). That being said, her burrito was so skimpy on prawns that I was disappointed just *watching* her eat it.

After a rousing show at the Make-Out Room, my beau and I decided to grab a bite in the vicinity. And since it was dark, finding the San Buena Taco Truck was out of the question. So we booked it to Papalote and earned a spot as the last lucky party to score a table in the small dining area. A staff member brought us each our own handful of chips in two bowls, along with little containers of orange, creamy, spicy salsa--quite different from the tomato chunks I'm used to. \n\nI ordered a prawn burrito, making it a super for only 99 cents. I appreciated the tortilla choices (spinach, flour, whole wheat and Roma tomato), opting for the spinach, as well as the bean options (pinto, refried and black). I chose pinto, of course. \n\nI mean, the burrito was okay but not worth $10. The prawns, generously doled and flavorfully grilled, added a unique texture to the sour cream, guac and cheese. \n\nThe atmosphere set Papalote apart. The artwork, a fuse between Picasso and Rivera, adorned the bright red walls. Flying frogs and dragons kept watch from the ceiling. The arched entryway between the ordering and dining area added architectural pizazz. Plus, the bathroom, covered in blue paint and graffiti, reminded me of a catwalk per its long, narrow shape and mirror in front of the commode above the sink. \n\nBecause of the shrimp and tilapia filling options and unique decor, Papalote rises just a step above chains like Willy's.", "author": "Bobbin W."}

They have more veggie options than other Mexican places. I have had a regular veggie burrito, with potatoes, mushrooms, and carrots. It was really good, but I do wish there had been more mushrooms in there. The potatoes and carrots had been cooked nice and soft but not mushy and seasoned well. I also tried the soyrizo which was also awesome. \n\nIf you want some guacamole, sour cream,, and cheese in your burrito, you got to pay an extra 99 cents to get it super.

Papalote won all those Best Salsa/Best Upscale Tacqueria/Best Burrito awards for a reason.  Some of these reviews have it ass backwards - it's not made for the masses, it's just that the masses have spoken, and the verdict is DELICIOUS.  There's always a line out the door for a reason.\n\nI just moved away from SF, and this is one of the spots I am missing the most. It's not \"white people food\", ffs, it's just not the most authentic Mexican in the area....but so what?  It's not like you can't score that if you really want it - but you come here for a reason, and that reason is the bomb-ass burritos.\n\nAnd they are far from \"flavorless\", trust me.  The cheese is good, the fresh salsa adds nice saltiness and acidity, the beans are tasty and the meat is cooked to order.  Quite simply, they are just awesome burritos.  *Awesome*.\n\nNot to mention the customary free chips and salsa, and to reiterate what everyone else already said - it's almost worth visiting just for the salsa (which does have plenty of kick, contrary to someone's bogus assertion that it's lacking...if you really want *any* Mexican food to be spicy, you have to add hot sauce, so that is kind of irrelevant anyways).\n\n*Note:  the salsa does not, I repeat NOT taste anything like \"liquid Doritos\".  Good God.  The unique consistency in the \"orange sauce\" salsas in California are due to the addition of sour cream.\n\nI'd usually be a bit more judicious with the stars and give this 4, but the service is always friendly and they never messed up an order in 2 years of constant high-volume take out.", "author": "Bryan M."}

I agree with other Filipinos who grew up on chix adobo (and otherwise) that this specialty burrito us tasty and passable, but it needs a little help from Lolo to bring the magic. The burrito is served with chicken adobo, rice and tomato and you can even get beans or make it \"super.\" The chix adobo itself is tender and has just enough tangy Filipino (not Mexican!) adobo flavor. However, one vital component that is a bit weak is garlic. As everyone says a garlic rice is mighty tasty with chix adobo... As well you could throw in some caramelized onion. Perhaps, they could lightly paint a hot, garlic oil on the inside of the tortilla? A previous reviewer substituted a garden tomato tortilla with this burrito and that hit the spot.\n\nOverall this spot still gets 4 stars any day of the week.

The meat, chicken, & fish wasn't seasoned, just grilled. The Champion Burrito would be a goner w/o the salsa.\n\nWe got there about 1:30p and the restaurant was full - and this place is tiny(!).

It came out, nicely on a plate.  I picked it up and sunk my teeth in for my first bite.  GOO-OOOD = 4 stars, but where are rest of the rice & beans, guac, sour cream?  I only got to taste some meat, lettuce, and a little rice, beans..  I soon found out where they were.. all at the bottom-end of my burrito, thus giving me a soggy bottom and tearing my burrito apart at the end :(  That's why I took half a star away, for my soggy bottom.  Rather than that, it was a solid tasting burrito!\n\nI asked my brother (local in SF) what he thought.  He said that he prefers the burritos that you get from the trucks in the mission better, but this place was good.  All in all, I was happy with this burrito, but as the best I've had?  I can't honestly give you that.  I'm sure there are better burrito places in SF, I just haven't had time to take a whirl-wind tour of burritos in SF.. next time...", "author": "Thu V."}

That was THE best non-meat burrito I've ever had and I love Pancho Villa's tofu.\n\nMy girlfriend had a carne asada and grilled shrimp burrito which she devoured (all 100 pounds of her).  Needless to say, she enjoyed hers, too.\n\nWe met the owner, Miguel,  who also gave us a sample of his chicken adobo (over rice), which is a burrito meat option (and quite popular, I hear).  While I thought that to be somehow wrong, I have to admit that the adobo was absolutely delicious.   It was SO tender.\n\nThe eating area is small but the tables do clear quickly.

We stood in a short line, ordered our food and waited at a table for two. We were given two bowls of warm tortilla chips and a very creamy and spicy sauce to dip them in.

I have to say, the burrito was pretty good, was not bland, actual big pieces of pork in the burrito and there was that \"creaminess\" in the burrito that I tasted in the hot sauce.

Yeah, if I was in the neighborhood.\n\nSo back to why I came to this place, I sent a text to my friend Irv and said, \"I'm at Papalote, it's pretty good\" he txts back with \"Where?\" Thinking he's having a senior moment, I explain it's the place he's been going on and on about.

Prices have probably been readjusted to account for the recent influx of Google/Facebook/Apple employees (and Papalote is laughing all the way to the bank, no doubt).  To be fair, the fish burrito is certainly GOOD, but is it $13 good?  In my opinion, no.  For $13, I can do a lot better than a burrito, to be sure.  I know I could have just walked away & not paid such an exorbitant price, but I must confess, I felt myself oddly curious what a $13 burrito might taste like: Maybe it was sprinkled with gold dust or saffron, or maybe it came with 20 GB free storage on DropBox or something (it didn't come with any of these things, unfortunately).  I'd probably give Papalote 4 stars if I restricted my criteria to just the QUALITY of the food.  But when you also take into account value for money, it begins to fall a bit flat (I'd prefer to give them 2 and a HALF stars, but that does not appear to be possible here, so I'm only giving them 2).  Perhaps we're just in a new economy, and Papalote's prices are simply reflective of the new standard, but I think we collectively need to take a step back & pay attention to what a fair price really is, and how much markup is really acceptable.  Consider that you can get a fish burrito (with grilled Salmon, no less) at the Little Chihuahua on Valencia for only $8.75, or a fish burrito with line-caught Mahi-Mahi at Tacobar, on California St & Fillmore (in Pacific Heights) for only $8.50, then it becomes harder & harder to justify Papalote's prices.

The Triple Threat Burrito was the challenge, and boy was it also a challenge to finish. \n\nFirst off, the free chips as an appetizer are delicious! I don't know what's so different about them but they have a natural crunch to them that make them irresistible to turn away. Also, the salsa served with the chips is probably as close to perfect salsa I have ever tasted in my life. The salsa is sweet, yet not too sweet, and spicy enough to have a kick in it but not too much where you can only eat a bit. There's also none of that burnt pepper taste in it. \n\nI also split an order of fish tacos with my brother. The fish tacos were a lot bigger than other taquerias I've been to and they are extremely hot (temperature wise) when they come out. The fish tacos were recommended to us by the staff as their best tacos, and they were correct!\n\nNow on to the Triple Threat Burrito. This burrito is definitely not for the faint at heart. The sheer size of the burrito is comparable to other taquerias as maybe 1.2 to 1.5 times larger. They also recommend that the burrito be shared by two or more people, which I recommend as well. The shrimp inside is of the jumbo variety, and the chicken and steak are marinated to perfection in many spices. There is not too much rice in the burrito to mask any of the flavors, and for $0.99 more, they add in sour cream and guacamole to make the burrito perfect. The only downside to the burrito was the price, for $20 I could get 4 burritos at other taquerias, but I had to try this burrito at least once. \n\nOn another note, this place is probably the closest thing to a temple for those with hangovers!", "author": "Langdon N."}

In essence, the salsa is made with roasted tomatoes and pureed into a smooth consistence but packed with flavor.  Their salsa is different but I personally like my chunks of tomatoes in my salsa. However their avocado dip ($2.75) was chunky and delish!\n\nAt Papalote, you have the option of making your burrito as healthy as you'd like.  From your choice of wheat, spinach and tomato tortillas to tofu and veggie options, a burrito does not have to be heavy and give you food coma!!  Once you order food, you'll be seated by one of the friendly workers.\n\nThe bathroom is kinda cool. Almost every inch of the wall space and the ceiling is covered in graffiti.  They've used graffiti as an art and it brings in a cool vibe.  \n\nParking is kinda hard especially in the Mission but if you bike to Papalote, you can park your bike at the bike racks in front and watch\n\nWe tried the carne asada tacos ( 2 for $5.95) and Veggie grilled burrito ($6.50).  The carne asada tacos had huge cube chunks of marinated meat. The veggie burrito was definitely not as great as the burritos from El Farolito.", "author": "Shirley W."}

Deciding whether to go to Papalote is a dilemma that is probably experienced by many San Franciscans due to the fact that their burritos are damn tasty but getting one takes for-f*cking-EVER. \n\nBe warned, friends - if you are starving and need immediate gratification do NOT walk in to Papalote and order a burrito.  Your sorry ass will be waiting for at least 15 minutes.  I was there Tuesday and it took OVERa half an hour to get a standard chicken burrito (which was delicious - I ate the entire thing and would've eaten a second if I could).\n\nOrdering by phone seems to be the smart way to go about getting your food fast.  It kind of takes the spontaneity out of the experience but it'll save you frustration.

From the prawn tacos to the burritos, I've eaten enough now to say ENOUGH! Since my last visit, they have renovated the area at the cash register. As if it could not have gotten more awkwardly placed, the line now is forced out the door at a sharp angle. Papalote's blinding non-CFL lighting (which creates an unnecessary heatwave in the dead of winter) and glossy red walls create an anxiety in me that only rivals that of an interrogation. Because it is in close proximity to my friend's apartment, I reluctantly agreed to meet her there. (Any excuse to see her.) Miraculously, she was able to get 3 seats for all of us. Seating is at a premium.\n\nLast night, I had the prawn burrito. I was not given chips or salsa or a napkin or cutlery or my drink. I asked for all of these things, seeing that everyone else had them, and was told that \"extra\" chips & salsa were 55 cents. Seriously? I can get all the chips I want elsewhere and for free. Once I explained to the guy that I never got my first round, he gave me some salsa. I walked out of there having paid $14 for a burrito and a horchata. I could have gone to El Farolito and bought dinner for both of us. My burrito was dry, pretty bland, and I only found the cheese  of the way through my meal (same goes for the guacamole). I slathered every bit of my tiny salsa cup on my burrito for flavor. The prawns were large... all (4?) of them. I spent the entire night in agony. I remebered now why I never go there: I get incredible stomach cramps from their food. I can't explain it - no one else seems to have this - but the amount of acid created is so painful that the last time I ate there, I needed to swallow Pepto with lidocaine just to get to sleep. \n\nI will now leave Papalote to the hipsters who frequent it. A guy who sat next to us was visiting from NY. I mentioned to him that this was not my favorite place and suggested that if he was here for any length of time, he should try the many other burrito places that the Mission has to offer. I suggested El Farolito and the couple next to us agreed and chimed in. The couple on the other side of us agreed as well.

I am sick and tired of taquerias that claim to be restaurants. El Papolote has got to be one of the worse places I have been to in the Mission District! Being of Mexican heritage I take these places with a grain of salt. Through many other recomendations for this place I decided to give it a try. Now no Mexican household I have ever been in steams a flour tortilla?Tortillas are traditionally grilled or are fresh off the grill...Never Steamed??? the Chi\nlaquillas were the worse ever! the same dipping sauce was spread all over my dish! and the rice was spciy and the black refried beans were so watery and spicy. There was one flavor! spicy. I never tasted the beans or rice. It was a big mess!I looked around the taqueria and noticed that besides the workers, I was the only latino in the place!Nothing but young hipsters!....maybe the idea of a big sloppy undercooked tortilla is an someone's idea of reall mexican food? sadly these young people will never experience real mexican cooking.", "author": "bette r."}

Yesterday I decided to try the bean and cheese dip which turns out to be refried black beans with melted cheese. I asked if it came with a large bowl of chips and the gal at the counter ensured it did. So by my calculations we ordered two items for two people, one of which was supposed to have lots of chips. We got one bowl before the tacos and another bowl, same size with the dip. I kept asking the busser for another bowl but he knows the rules so he ignored my pleas. When I went to the counter the gal said they only have one size bowl. I reminded her she had said it came with a large serving of chips but that went right past her. She gave me another bowl but I could see contempt in her eyes as she handed it to me. Here's the thing, what is dip for if not chips? Secondly, the price for beans and cheese with a small bowl of chips would be fair at $3.50, still a huge mark-up. The actual price of $6.50 is just dumb, especially considering you don't get any type of garnish or extra chips. It's literally a plate of beans with melted cheese.

Partially hydrogenated oil is an unnatural substance created through a chemical process that is used because it is cheap and has very long shelf life.  It raises bad LDL cholesterol and lowers good HDL cholesterol.  it is the only substance on earth that does this.  Bacon grease raises LDL cholesterol, but it also raises or leaves flat HDL cholesterol.\n\nPartially hydrogenated oil has been linked to heart disease, heart attacks, diabetes, liver disease, and other diseases.   One 2007 study found, each 2% increase in the intake of energy from trans unsaturated fats, as opposed to that from carbohydrates, was associated with a 73% greater risk of ovulatory infertility.\n\nA Spanish study showed that Increased consumption of partially hydrogenated oil increased the risk of clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder by 48%.\n\nAnother study found that trans fat and partially hydrogenated oil increases weight gain and abdominal fat more than eating the same amount of calories in regular saturated fat like bacon, lard, butter, etc.  It is WORSE for you than just about anything.\n\nAnother study found that increased intake of partially hydrogenated oil increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThis restaurant has a $20 burrito.  It's not cheap for a hole in the wall place.  It is criminal that they charge a lot for their food and then use the cheapest possible ingredients.  If they use cheap ingredients like tortillas with partially hydrogenated oil and preservatives, then why not just go to Taco Bell where they use the same unnatural chemical ingredients, but give you a big break on the price.\n\nSome people will eat food that contains chemicals that have been shown to cause health problems because it's cheaper and they want to get a cheap price and they are willing to take the chance.

It's beneath the astrix.\n\nHere is my updated review for Papalote.\n\nI took a good friend of mine who lives in Oakland, has a kid and never gets out of the house to the Mission.  We had an erreand to run but she was craving a good Mission Burrito.  Said friend is vegan, so I suggested Papalote, since they have tofu options, soyrizo, and vegan mole. \n\nWe get there and decide to split the veggie fajitas with a side of guac, a side of soyrizo (for her) and some shrimp for me.  So I order and the total comes to 22 BUCKS!  Without drinks.  But whatever.  I tell her it's really good and I fork over some money.  So the food is brought out and I get the shrip and I say FUCK--what I really wanted was Prawns.  \nMaybe it's due to me being an unsophisticted Mid-westerner, but I ordered shrimp not expecting them to be those tiney nasty thing but the big jumbo ones.  \n\nI went to the counter and told the manager and he said tough luck.  I was kind of incredulous.  You think if someone has just spent a shitload of money--22 BUCKS for ONE MEAL at a fucking taqueria you could throw three prawns at them.  he was just an asshole and said you ordered wrong too bad.  So I walked back and spit out my WINE AND BUTTER soaked nasty ass shrimp that had no flavor.  \n\nThen they brought the fajitas out and they gave us ONE tortilla and I was so pissed by then I couldn't even complain for fear they guy would be like--\"well it only comes with one tortilla--tough.\"\n\nSo I left the place so pissed because I really wanted my FAVORITE taqueria to be my friend's favorite new place and maybe she would like it enough to come into the city more.\n\nI was so upset that I decided to call the manager--who was the rude guy to complain--and guess what he was a dick then too.  I even told him that it was my favorite taqueria and instead of eating near my school in Potrero Hill sometimes--there are porbably 20 taqueria between it and Papalote I truck there.  \n\nI was a regular customer--but that's what shitty customer service can do.

I remember the first time I stumbled upon this modern-looking, hipster tacqueria on a night roaming the Outer Mission.  Hipster places springing up in the Mission is akin to pissing on gremlins: I guess only children of the 80's may get this reference.  I was mildly surprised by the interesting 'Mexicant' menu, including healthy options like soyrizo and vegan mole. I was even more surprised after having a burrito there, that I not only liked it...I loved it.\n\nMyself, being a carnivore, love all of the meaty servings that they have to offer.  I personally love their Carne Asada and Chile Verde Burritos.  They are very flavorful, and not heavy at all: A combination in a burrito that you would think would cause a paradox that would unravel space-time.  However, it all works to me, and it doesn't feel I ate a truck when I leave.  Also, their Salsa is deserving of all the accolodates that it receives.\n\nDelicious and health-conscious food, reminds me of what I miss about the city the most.", "author": "Satoru Y."}

It means I eat a shitload of Mexican food.  I like all of it, including the somewhat more obscure fare like menudo and lengua (tongue).  My best friend who is Mexican won't even eat lengua.  She claims I am browner than she is (I am yellow).\n\nOn a recent weekend jaunt to the bay area, the aforementioned friend and her bf asked me what I wanted for dinner Saturday night.  After a couple days of light meals, I was ready for something that would leave me full for the rest of the week.  Thus, I suggested Mexican food.  First we tried to get to some spot that supposedly features bomb ass carne asada burritos, but alas, they are only open for lunch.  So we traipsed on over to Papalote, which they assured would be just as good.\n\nUpon arriving, the place was way packed.  Albeit a small space, that shit was pretty ridiculous.  The way it works is, you order at the counter.  As my friends and I were dining in, we proceeded to wait in the doorway, watching like hawks at people who are taking their sweet ass time eating, finally scrambling when a couple leave only to sit down at their dirty table.  Btw, it took us roughly 30 minutes after ordering to get a table.  And apparently, if you're dining in and aren't seated, they won't bring out your food (which means it was probably ready a while ago and is now getting cold).  However, this is hearsay, and as Lavar Burton would say, \"you don't have to take my word for it\".\n\nWow, I haven't even reviewed the food yet.  It's subpar and the best way to describe it is glorified Baja Fresh.  I'll even say that BF is tastier, and without the gaggle of hipsters and long ass wait.  I had shrimp marinated in butter and something else tacos and a side of rice.  The shrimp was so disappointing, lacking flavor and spice.  The side of rice could feed four people.  Too bad it was super dry and needed a load of lime and salsa to punch it up. \n\nI'll agree with everyone else that the salsa was good, but that was the only thing remotely noteworthy.", "author": "Karen T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-13", "description": "On the recommendation of a local, we headed to Papalote to sample what I've always heard to be superior Mexican food to what we have here in Boston.  \n\nCan I just interject and describe to you how completely obnoxious it is to live in Boston and, on a regular basis, hear San Fransisco transplants berate me about the low quality and in-authenticity of Mexican food in the Northeast?  It seems like every person who has ever even step foot within a 500 mile radius of the Mission district feels obligated to chime in and remind me that, yes, Mexican food in Boston sucks, and Mission burritos are tastier.  After years of this, I began to think that this was, in fact, a fact (yeah, intentional), and that my trip to San Fransisco would give me an epiphany and a fantastic culinary experience to boot.\n\nBack to the task at hand.  I went to the Mission and chose Papalote for my field research, as it seemed to be widely accepted as the \"best burrito.\"  \n\nI should have known that something was awry when the guy at the counter told me they had just whooped Bobby Flay in a Throwdown.  I call this the Flay phenomenon - The inevitable inflow of traffic post-TV-debut brings crowds to a Throwdown winner's establishment that the restaurant perhaps wasn't ready for (or ill-equipped to handle).  I fear this, as a once-fabulous place could go downhill quickly, choosing to ride the popularity wave.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not have such a great experience here, and whether it's the show's fault or the restaurant's, I left a bit let down.\n\nThe prices are steep - $5.50 for an order of two tacos, and this \"famous\" burrito now costs $20. WHAT?  What do you put in a burrito to make it $20.  I will tell you this - this place charges extra for cheese, sour cream, and guac, so I'm not sure what's left.\n\nWe did not go for the $20 burrito, but we had a more modest $9 version, but did not opt to pay the extra for the dairy and guac.  The burrito (chicken) was, as a result, a bit bland and very dry.  If the burrito only tastes good with these extra-charge add-ons, then why bother making the burrito at all? \n\nWe also had an order of fish tacos, an order of chicken, and an order of beef.  The fish tacos were the only ones that were double-wrapped with two tortillas each, and the other two orders were only single-wrapped.  Is this \"authentic\"?  I am not sure, as I am not well-versed in corn tortilla etiquette, but I thought the customary-two was the standard.\n\nThe sole-double-wrapped fish taco was really wet and drippy, but I enjoyed that the fish wasn't battered and deep fried to the point of nonrecognition.  Rather, the fish in the tacos was abundant, moist, and juicy.  The other two tacos tasted just like each other, and were both very dry.\n\nThe best thing about this place was definitely the creamy, spicy salsa that accompanied the chips.  Perhaps this has always been the practice, or maybe it was due to the new-found extreme popularity, but after the first complimentary order, the restaurant charges for refills.  I don't necessarily think that this is a bad practice, just an interesting one I'd not seen before.  Because we bought so much food, however, we were able to get 4 orders of these for free, and I opted to ditch the tacos and make a meal out of chips and salsa.\n\nYou can buy this salsa by the jar to go, and had we not been from out of town, I would certainly take advantage of that.\n\nI will say that the employees are ALL extremely friendly.  Everyone is kind, courteous, and polite.  We must have gone at a bizarre hour, because there was no line whatsoever.   Food came out hot and prompt, and I was very pleased with the experience aside from the taste of the food.\n\nI don't think I'd go back, but one great thing did come from the experience.  Now, back at home, when people launch a tirade about how much New England Mexican sucks compared to the beloved Mission Burritos, I am able to smile, nod, and smirk knowingly (and perhaps a bit judgmentally) as they ramble on, while silently thinking that Olecito is better Mexican food than what I found in SF.", "author": "Heather G."}

I got the Marinated Tofu (it was supposed to be on a spinach tortilla, but it seems that burrito places often advertise burrito flavors they actually don't have). \n\nThe burrito was heavy and warm, filled with tofu, beans, and rice. It was a little different than what I'm used to, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. The salsa was also unusual--rather than resembling pico, it was much smoother and creamier. And, in case people out there judge a burrito joint on its chips, I'd say they were above average. \n\nAll that for $6.30, which is slightly less than the going rate in Atlanta (a much cheaper city overall).

I guess its normal for SF carne asada burritos to not come with guacamole, but where i come from, that is an integral part of the burrito!  To get a carne asada burrito with guacamole will cost you near 8 bucks... for that i would rather buy 15 frozen burritos at Lucky's, they're almost as good! P-lote does have very good salsa, congrats...\n\n\"Son of a bitch Riggs!\"\nDanny Glover", "author": "John B R."}

Papalote should offer a great burrito, it wins \"burrito of the year\" in the weeklies all the time, and there's a line out the door most nights.  Sadly though, it offers only a middling burrito, elements of which are excellent, but which overall fails to hold together (literally if you order in house and the unwrapped log is served to you on a plate).\n\nWhat do I mean, how can I blaspheme so?  What I mean is that the rice is often clumpy and unspiced, the beans mediocre at best, there's sometimes odd \"salt strata\" in the filling, the lines are murder - cramped, endless murder, the prices are a bit dear, and worst of all, I've been given stale chips of several occasions [ the stale chip problem seems to have vanished as of 8/1/07].   As for the good, vegans can eat here (which seems to make them happy at least), they make a tasty mole chicken/tofu filling and the meat grilled to order is a fine touch(though marinating the beef would improve it greatly), the salsa is good (not the amazing miracle some claim, but tasty).\n\nThus, I approve on principle and like some touches (the owner is a nice guy as well), but since they don't really need my approval, or my burrito dollar, and there are some intolerable inconsistencies at Papalote, I'm going elsewhere these days.", "author": "Gustie L."}

I've tasted the fish tacos and not a fishy taste or smell about them.  A friend gives raves to the veggie burrito.  The chilaquiles are divine.\n\nPapalote is located in what I call N'mission -- on the edge of Noe and the Mission.  If you're not into kids, then beware of the Noe Stroller Set.  They can overtake the place with often times not so well-behaved children.  Or clueless parents.  And why oh why can't they leave their strollers on the sidewalk?

But anyway...\n\nThis is my favorite spot in the Mission (SF, for that matter) for a burrito. When I have visitors seeking culinary delights I take 'em here. The veggie burrito, loaded with potatoes, mushrooms, and carrots, is ama-to-the-zing. Add a little Paplote original spicy sauce, and you've got yourself a tastebud explosion! I love, love the sauce. It's spicy and delightful, and whether you're putting it on chips, a veggie burrito, fish tacos, or carne asada, it's the bomb. \n\nDon't be put off by the line or the small size of the restaurant.

Neither is particularly firm, so be prepared for some sloppiness. Service can be a little slower than other places, but it's usually worth the wait.\n\nUpdate: After having been here on and off over the past year, I've come to the realization that Papalote burritos get repetitive, very quickly - they have a very distinctive flavor, so if you have a burrito craving, it can't be sated by a Papalote burrito (and consequently, a Papalote Burrito craving can't be resolved by eating a normal burrito).

I recently tried the chile verde quesadilla and it was soooo good. It would be my new favorite except that it's pork, and I don't really eat pork. The pork pieces were tender and delicious though. Maybe next time I'll ask if they can leave out the pork pieces and just heap on that yummy green sauce.\n\nFor 99 cents, I always \"super\" my order because the guacamole rocks. You can't even get an avocado at the market for 99cents, and they give a generous portion. The salsa is smoky and just the right amount of kick to it. It's worth the 50 cent charge to get another helping! The chips are thin, crisp and always served warm. Yum. \n\nService:  awesome. \"Perdito\", who flashes his ever cheerful silver accented smile, is already filling my \"pepsi regular\" when I walk in the door. When the owner Miguel is there he always takes a moment to say hello.  Update: the Pepsi machine is \"out of order\" apparently because of a tiff with an incompetent supplies. Miguel refuses to do business with the guy and as a result, I'm going through some kind of Pepsi withdrawal. The homemade horchata is good, but sometimes I want that chemical kick of Pepsi.

Their tacos, perhaps reflecting their proximity to Noe Valley, lack the guts of their greasier contemporaries on Mission street, and are filled with lettuce, of all things.\n\nI've found the employees to be uniformly rude, and their attitude does not seem to improve with frequent patronage, friendliness or tipping, but given that it takes about 30 seconds of interaction to procure my food, I'm inclined to not care.", "author": "Mike H."}

It was cool when the brothers were around more and caring for the place. I really like their food BUT they've gone too far. Went for a breakfast burrito...they have 4 choices, all pretty basic without anything special and they are all $9-10. So I asked for the Denver (onions, bell pepps, shrooms and cheese) and asked to add Soyrizo. Was going to be $4.50!! Sorry but I'm willing to pay for quality and for food I can't easily make at home. I can make a Soyrizo burrito at home easy. \n\nSo I said no thanks and left. Funny how blatantly overcharging can put a bad taste in ur mouth. Had to run errands up in Noe, so stopped at a cool, sustainable little Mex place on 24th past Castro. Bfast burrito with roasted potatoes, poblanos, etc was $6.50 and added carnitas for $2.50. It was huge and delicious.\n\nNot sure if I'm going back to papalote for reg burritos or not. Hope u guys are paying attention and adjust your pricing. I might pay $15 for a really interesting, more gourmet bfast burrito...but not your basic one.", "author": "Steven M."}

Finally, I would have a chance to sample their \"practically-orgasmic\" salsa!\n\nPapalote is a taqueria with partial table service. You order your food at the counter, grab a drink, pay your way, take a number and head over to a table in the side room and eagerly await the server with your taco, burrito, quesadilla or other standard taqueria fare... which is exactly what I did. \n\nThe chips (still warm) and salsa were brought almost immediately - and for all intents and purposes, they were the highlight of the meal. The rich orange salsa was spicy, sweet and had a complexity of flavor not commonly found in the condiment. The texture was smooth with black flecks - possibly from black pepper or from the skin of roasted pumpkin or peppers (yep - the secret ingredient, I have been told, is pumpkin seeds). This salsa's only competition for #1 in San Francisco is by Orale Orale.\n\nThe steak for the Carne Asada (which got very high marks from my co-workers), as well as the chicken, is cooked to order on a grill instead of scooped out of a steam table bin... and though I didn't sample it, the meat certainly looked good: appropriately charred and tender.\n\nThe pork Chile Verde was also quite good, with distinct flavors of tomatillo, cilantro and citrus in the sauce. Unfortunately, this filling, when combined with refried beans, cheese, rice and guacamole and wrapped in a tortilla, didn't meld into that cheesy-goopy goodness that makes an excellent burrito. It was good, but not great. Certainly not on par with Victor's or Mexico au Parc - which just goes to show you: even if every component of a dish is excellent, sometimes it doesn't come together properly to make something amazing. This time, the components were better than the sum of its parts.\n\n$8.89 for a super burrito, chips, salsa and a bottle of grapefruit soda. 3 stars for now, but I will certainly be back to try a carne asada quesadilla.", "author": "Avery G."}

I'm not knockin' the more traditional (yes, yes, I know, burritos are not really from Mexico - but there is a burrito standard nonetheless, at least here in SF) burrito joints. I still go to them, they're awesome, but sometimes I'm craving a burrito but still want to sleep at night without feeling like I'm about to explode.\n\nSo I went to Papalote, just a few years back.

It was spicy and had a good taste, but Salsa it is not.  \n\nVery small place and we had to wait a little bit to squeeze into a table.  \n\nSo if you are in the Mission District try it out, if not don't make a trip over there just for it.", "author": "Adam F."}

On this particular occasion I chose the chicken mole, a nice blend of salt and spice, mixed in well with healthy black beans and really good rice, some of the best black rice I've had around the Bay Area and that says a lot. My buddy swears by the griilled chicken, and rates this as one of the top burrito places in the Mission.\n\nI reserved inserting that '5th star' just because, I don't know, a 5-star place should be really really awesome, and this probably is a really awesome, but I can't say that I was blown away, but then again, I don't know how a burrito could blow me away.\n\nThe place is colorful and filled with young idealists, the type who read Kant and look like they want to make a difference in the world. Oh wait, that was me. S***.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me was the water cooler, whose knob you had to turn 10 times, only to get it to spout  water at a flow rate slower than the Mississippi, or perhaps like a guy who has a hard time peeing. Perhaps it's a ruse to get you to buy a drink there. Sorry, I'm a cheapo.", "author": "Hubert H."}

Normally I'm not a hot salsa fan, but theirs has just the right (comfortable) amount of heat and you can't help but keep dipping chips and shoveling your face with food.\n\nOverall, the prices aren't bad at all.  I'd be willing to pay the $7 or so dollars for the special fish burrito I ordered.  As other yelpers attested, the ingredients are fresh and the combination is deeeeelicious.\n\nThe seating area was a little limited, and we had to enact the \"search and hover\" method because we were a group of five.  Luckily, a table cleared away just as our food came.  \n\nDefinitely worth a trip out to the mission - especially if you have a slow work day!", "author": "Shay F."}

Two years later I gave this place a second chance and it was more disappointing this time around. Before I go any furher....I must tell you I decided to become a member of Yelp just to post this review tonight. Last time, I ordered a Triple Threat Burrito and paid close to $30 and was still hungry. Triple Threat doesn't mean triple the size or triple the meat/shrimp. This time I purchased a Prawn Super Burrito for $12.50 and of course I was still hungry. Why? There was only 4 shrimp inside. The only reason this place is still in business is because it was featured on The Food Network with Bobby Flay's showdown. It was because the salsa is good and on that episode the burrito was much larger. Please if you don't believe me; look it up on the web. \n\nThe employees have attitude like they work at Gary Danko's except they don't! The chips are horrible and they couldn't more frugal with the amount of salsa and chips they provide.  I will never go back again!!!!! \n\nIf you want something good and filling even though not Mexican go to Phat Philly's around the corner. It was delicious although still pricey...worth the $12 for a large. \n\nIf you want real Mexican food or for that matter a delicous  burrito; go to La Cumbre, La Morena or La Tapatia. The last  two options are in South San Francisco.\n\nPlease don't support this establishment unless you think a shrimp is worth $3. \n\nGood Luck in your search and don't believe the hype on the reviews. \n\nJay", "author": "jay m."}

I had a standard burrito with carne asada, nothing to write home about.  \n\nHowever, as a USF student, it's damn close to campus, so I made a second trip.  And I wasn't in the mood for anything too heavy this time around, so I had the eggplant and zucchini tacos.  DAMN.  Tastiest thing I've ever had in a tortilla.  I had it to go, so when I finally sat down to eat, the juices had split my tacos in half, making it impossible to hold, and I had no fork available.  However, it was so flavorful that I very quickly forgave the cooks at Papalote.\n\n(I'm not vegetarian, btw.  I was thinking that perhaps they were making the veggie stuff taste so good to make up for not having meat... you know, to sell it to the carnivores, too.)\n\nI got a little wiser by visit #3.  I ordered the eggplant and zucchini BURRITO this time.  And damn, that was satisfying.  Lasted me two meals!  And I didn't need a fork this time. :)  \n\nPrices range from about $3-$7 for various items (thank god they accommodate for students).  I'm planning to make regular trips out there between classes.  Trip #4 will involve the marinated tofu at my classmate's suggestion.  \n\nOh yeah, and parking might be a pain.

For delicious, fresh, hot chips, there are simply not enough of them, *especially* with that salsa, that's too hot for me, but too tasty for me not to eat.\n-Bathroom location. Sometimes, it stinks up the whole place.

I didn't see the show and don't go there because of it.\n\nI've been eating at Papalote for the past 1.5 years and eat there at least once every other week. \n\nPros: \n\n1) The most amazing chicken mole burrito. (If you prefer you can get tofu mole instead.) I always get Super Chicken Mole burrito with black beans. It is my Go-To favorite burrito in the entire bay area. To me, this burrito is addictive as crack. I drive from Burlingame to San Francisco sometimes just to eat this burrito.\n\n2) The orange salsa that comes with your chips. They are pretty famous for this salsa. It's pretty hot but not enough to be super uncomfortable. It almost tastes creamy but there are no dairy products in it. Just pumpkin seeds or something like that.\n\n3) Well located, just a 2 block walk west on 24th Street from the 24th Street Bart, right across the street from the gas station at Valencia and 24th Street. Hard to miss since I think it is currently painted orange.\n\nCons: \n\n1) Really small and waits of around 30 minutes during busy times until you actually are eating your food. Hard to get a table. Best thing to do is order on the phone about 20 minutes ahead of time and then go 'cut' in line by picking up your food at the right-most register. It's so satisfying to pseudo cut in line and get your food to go.\n\n2) Crowd seems a little too trendy for my tastes. \n\n3) Price is a little high for a burrito, but you get what you pay for. After tax, I think it ends up being around 9 bucks for a Super Mole Chicken Burrito.\n\n4) AFAIK, no delivery, which would be awesome.", "author": "P. D."}

You have to purchase each extra measly little cup.  When we asked for the habanero salsa the busboy said they only sold it by the jar and only the mild salsa was sold in .50 cent size. He then pointed to a non-papalote bottled salsa that is worth $2 at safeway as an option.   It is very strange for a business who is proud of their salsa to make it so inaccessible.  I could feel the employees discomfort in having to enforce this nickel and diming business strategy, and could see that they deal with constant confusion and frustration.  You could walk all 47 square miles of this amazing city and not find one other restaurant that serves \"Mexican\" food but limits the salsa distribution to one small dixie cup that our chips do not even fit into.  This experience made Papalote look amateurish and suggested that they cater only to the yuppie community who do not know good salsa and therefore do not complain about being served only enough salsa for two bites. I did not buy any extra salsa that night.

Let's just say they failed the inspection - things like storing food on the floor, the refrigerator temperature was not low enough...basically they didn't get a score because they had to fix so many things. Should you be afraid? I haven't gotten sick, but it was a bit off putting so I am lowering my score to 3 stars.++\n\nWhy do I love Papalote in the Mission? A few good reasons. I am not a vegetarian but I have to admit that the soyrizo tacos are pretty tasty but my alltime favorite is the fish burrito - straight up, don't go super.\n\nWhy do I love the fish burrito? It's is sauted in white wine with your choice of beans. The usual garnishes of lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole are absent so as to preserve and highlight the flavor of the fish.  The burrito is hot (temperature) since there are no cold fillings. You can usually share a fish burrito, and maybe get a quesadilla in case one of you gets a bit hungry.\n\nThe chips and salsa are also acclaimed. I do like the salsa, but I have to say it is a touch too spice for my taste.\n\nThey also do a great takeout - they are on my speed dial.", "author": "Spoon G."}

I paid $8.25 for shrimp nachos, which for exceptional ingredients, I can handle. Their salsa, however, is the only thing exceptional left about this place. They skimped on the shrimp, and I forgot that if you want guacamole and sour cream, you gotta pay for it here.

I know that this plae was on the \"THROW DOWN\" food channel show with Bobby Flay. I thought the salsa was great! Out of all the places in the city I think this place has by far the best salsa. Unfortunately, I had a Burrito and shared a quesadilla and it did not blow me away at all. Plus I didn't like that the burrito was not in foil like what all the other taqueria places do. Burritos are meant to be eaten with your hands and not with a knife or a fork. \nSo what it comes down to, here's what I would do if you guys go on 24th street to venture. Go here to have the Chips and Salsa and don't order anything else. Then walk a block to EL FAROLITO and then eat a super suiza Quesadilla. If you are still hungry (which I doubt you will be) then go get a Torta at TOrtas Los Picudos down the street on 24th or walk to 19th and Mission and get a Super Burrito at Cancuns.

I always get the soyrizo burrito, it is one of my favorites - tastes like something I would actually make at home. Back in the day my mom would make soy \"chorizo\" for me, but she would mix it with eggs. It came in a box, it looked something like bacos - you had to add water and let it reconstitute. It was kind of icky if you think about it.  Thanks papalote, you remind me of my childhood. Also, the guy that owns this place is very good to the local community...what's not to like?\n\nOK, that being said I need to go on a rant about some of the reviews here. WHY do non-Mexican pendejos feel like they have the knowledge to call vegetarian options \"non traditional\"?, or to say that by \"adding\" vegan options it creates some form of  hybrid \"healty twist\" to Mexican food? Mexican food *is* healthy...or it can be, if you know where to get it. Burritos are NOT authentic Mexican food, so when reviewers complain that Papalote doesn't serve \"authentic Mexican burritos\" I can't help to roll my eyes.\n\nNewsflash - in Mexico we DO eat vegetables. As a matter of fact, in many parts of Mexico meat was such a commodity that 98% of the diet was comprised of vegetarian options - just adding a little bit of meat in the shape of local available animals.  Even in super crowded cement and iron Mexico City you can go to any marchanta making quesadillas and ask for Flor the Calabaza, calabacitas con elote, rajas, papa con queso, hongos and delicious huitlacoche.

And damn you love that salsa.  But they're too stingy with it, because they know they can sell it to us.  If they gave out more with the order, we'd be there for hours just drinking it and smearing it on ourselves.  I usually like a variety of salsas, but the one variety they have needs no siblings.\n\nThis place really stands out in the vast sea of San Francisco taquerias.  They have vegan mole--damn...  she's been looking for that her whole life.  It's really good, too.  And mole could be really bad.  But never get it in the quesadilla, because it just oozes all out the sides and onto everything around you, making it impossible to eat.\n\nThe chicken is marinated and grilled fresh, so you can avoid bin chickens.  I'll spend extra to get shrimp at other taquerias simply to have freshly cook meat, so it's nice to have some more options here.  The lettuce is fresh and green, the guacamole is brilliant, the beans are  perfectly textured and the options include refried black--good stuff.\n\nAbout the only thing I could think to improve (other than giving MORE SALSA) is that the corn tortillas could be fresher instead of the standard packaged variety.\n\nThe price is good, too.", "author": "Nicole and Kayvon B."}

They give you your choice of beans and tortillas for burritos, which I enjoy because I'm not partial to the typical, \"flour tortilla brown pinto beans\" burrito persuasion.  My friend says the vegetarian options are awesome, he likes soyrizo, and I guess some people look for that in their food, a vegetarian option that is.  \nThe chicken and beef are grilled fresh to order, its always tender without gristle or fat.  I love their burritos, yo.  \nThe best part is the Barbie size portion of chips and salsa they bring for you and and your four friends to share.  Its tiny, but the salsa is the best ever.

Papalote is a little trendier place with a nice dining area and cool music in the background (which some old guy was actually dancing to whilst eating his burrito...free entertainment, I guess).  Service was friendly.  This place seems like more of a sit-down type place as opposed to the plain burrito joint of La Taqueria.\n\nThey bring you chips and salsa to start.  The salsa was amazing!  Somehow they mixed creamy into the salsa vernacular and it works!  The burrito came a little later (the wait was a little long, but it takes time for good food) looking delicious with a little side of fruit compote of some sort.\n\nComparing the actual burrito next to La Taqueria's is a little difficult....I would describe is as \"nicer.\"  I'm not sure what that really means, but it is what it is.  I got the carne asada.  Overall, the burrito was delicious!  The carne asada was very flavorful and it was pretty \"clean\" to eat.  La Taqueria is  messier and felt a little more authentic and the flavors were just different.  I preferred La Taqueria's carnitas, but that's not to say Papalote isn't very good.\n\nThis is a great place to come with friends and enjoy a beer and burrito.

A couple of weeks back I went to Papalote to get my typical vegan bean burrito and I must say it seemed like something went wrong. Not sure what the deal was. They were crowded as usal and normally their service is quick never had to wait long on my order. On this, day December the 8th around 1:00 pm, I ordered a burrito that took much longer than normal and quality was much lower than normal. I wanted to write a good review because normally my experience at Papalote has always been great. However this time it seemed that my Burrito had some sort of black sticky substance holding together. It seems like some type of residual from the grill. After eating the burrito I had a bad stomach issues, aches and pains after eating food out makes you question the sanitary quality of the food. The reason why ate the burrito is because I was in a hurry and didn't have the time and tried to remove all of the black stuff that I discovered. I should have complained and I should have taken back the burrito as much as I loved papalote over the past year. I am considering never going back to this location. However I will say that because this is my only negative experience with the restaurant I will refrain from giving them a 100% bad rating. It's just a shame that this had to happen.

Getting a table looked like it was going to be tough, but were actually seated pretty quickly. they bring you chips and their homemade salsa to nosh on while you wait.  the salsa is very very good - unlike the red/green salsas you see everywhere else, this salsa was rich, smokey, and very very flavoful (for those from SJ, think La Victoria salsa, but less creamy, and the raw ingredients dont get lost in the whip)\n\nThe meats are grilled FRESH.  not pre-grilled, chopped, and thrown in a tin in advance.  and cuz of this - and the size of this place (small), getting your order will take a while.  this is what separates it from other taquerias (or is it a grill?), that they do this as you order, unlike other places that take less than 5 mins to throw your ingredients in a tortilla, wrap it, and get it to your hands/table.  so be prepared to wait about 15- 20 mins (this was when it was very busy, probably less when its not)\n\nmy GF ordered steak nachos: \nthe plate came and you could see the steam coming off the carne asada.  its a flank cut, marinated and seasoned to perfection.  she's a bit particular when it comes to taquerias, so to impress her was a big win.  the plate was fresh, hot, and all ingredients were very tasty.  refried black beans, ftw!\n\ni had the chicken burrito + cheese & guacamole: \nnot your run-of-mill burrito.  great size, its not HUGE, nor is it wimpy either.  the chicken is marinated very nicely; smokey & spicy, and it doesnt over power everything else.  refried blackbeans were nice consistency, not runny at all.  the salsa is awesome and the rice was nice and steamed, not al dente, or mushy.\n\nthe service is great.  one of the owners made sure the dining area was in check and that you were attended in adequate time.  kudos.", "author": "Ruben G."}

Once we were seated (remember, this is after a significant wait) - one of our party gets her food immediately...which seems \"about right\" timing-wise.  We wait a bit more, she starts eating...then the waiter comes out...and serves one person from the party that was behind us in line. Then he comes out again and serves another person - but from the party 3rd back in line.  So now he has 1/4-1/3 served 3 different groups & we're all sitting there wondering WTF.  I go up and mention that one person got their food 10 minutes ago (and order more beer so it's not like we're not giving them more $$).

What? For a burrito?!

This was amazing.  Period.  Super delicious.\n\nThe second time, I had the vegan mole burro with a side of guacamole.  The burro was great (I liked the veggie burro with soyrizo more though), but the guacamole was kind of lame.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but it didn't taste freshly prepared.\n\nSo, the food was delicious, but the store itself sucks.  It was packed out the door both times we went, preventing any possibility of actually sitting down to eat.  The first time we went, it was like 3pm on a Saturday, and the second time was abour 1pm on a Monday.  Weird times to be so completely busy.  It was really loud as well, and I could barely hear the server girl who was very frustrating to work with anyways.  She was just sort of rude, and kept turning around and joking with the grill guys while I was trying to order, then gave me attitude when I corrected her inaccurate record of my order.  I don't know, it just added stress to something that should be delicious and stress free (mexican food).  Oh, also, the bathroom is sort of gross, and they keep all of their produce in the common area where a thousand dirty hipsters assuredly wipe their gross hands all over my delicious cucumbers and tomatoes.

But you woulda thought the cashier would have mentioned this to us when we ordered? Will be back to try these again, and the nachos as well. But still not completely sold.", "author": "Purnima M."}

Their burritos are so damn good, there are no words that can describe the ecstasy that my mouth goes through when I'm eating one. I started off getting their veggie burritos, which come with carrots, potatoes and mushrooms. I was a little indifferent about the thought of eating a burrito with carrots, but OMG!!! And since I can't give up the delicious seasoning in the soyrizo burrito, I order the soyrizo with all veggies. I get the best of both. And no, I am not a vegetarian by any means... I just don't do meat in my burritos. It's one of my many food oddities. I haven't tried anything else but the burritos, however, I know I don't need to to give them the 5 stars they deserve. They are always friendly and quick with my orders (I order to-go with my co-workers just about every other Sunday) and they always get them right. Their chips aren't greasy, like many other taqueria chips are, and although they don't have chunky salsa, their hot sauce is so delicious and has a great spice to it.

Parking was surprisingly easy for the Mission and I quickly found a spot. The menu is very vegetarian friendly, with only two real meat options and a few fish choices to boot. I picked a grilled shrimp burrito for myself and a fish burrito for Abby. We both opted to make them \"super\" for an extra 99 cents, but my burrito especially had very little guacamole or sour cream (is there ever enough sour cream in a burrito anywhere? Please do tell). Both were super flavorful and had a very acceptable ratio of fillings, the shrimp were all nicely charred and the wine/butter sauce on the fish was pretty solid. The icing on the cake at this place is their roasted tomato salsa. While they don't have a salsa bar this one salsa makes up for it. It's pureed, almost more of a sauce really, and must have some kind of oil in it because it was too good not to have a fat content.

This better be an amazing burrito especially since every other burrito on the menu is only $8 or so!  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  A large delicious burrito filled with carne asada, chicken and shrimp arrived along with a side of hauntingly smoky yet perfectly spicy salsa.  The salsa is the perfect complement to the wonderfully grilled and marinated contents of the burrito.  Having three types of meat inside means each bite is a sublime combination of flavors and textures.  My only quibble is that a few pieces of the shrimp were noticeably saltier than the rest of the meats - though it wasn't inedible by any means.\n\nAnd for those concerned about portion sizes, this was one of the biggest burrito's I've eaten in a long time.  Unless you're Adam Richman, this should be plenty of food for anyone.\n\nSeparately, the guacamole is good - though I wish it had a bit more of a kick and the fish tacos are also very tasty.

I was also happy with the selection on the menu.  They have items that you don't normally find in a mexican restaurant in SF.  I had MOLE burrito (chicken) and while the chicken was a little dry, the creaminess of refried black beans made up for the dryness.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-05-31", "description": "OK update, the last time I was here the place was really clean. The food wasn't great, it was okay, so I upped the joint a star. One of my burrito eating pleasures is the \"roach\", the last couple of bites, or often one huge bite that has all the lovely trickled down essence with a fair amount of tortilla softened and flavored by the lovely essence. The burritos here don't seem to have that. They offer a doughy unflavorful last bite, and that just leaves me kind of disappointed. End of update until the next time I venture in. \n\nYeah, so what's all the chatter? This place is dirty and the food is okay, meaning it tastes good enough but there are issues. Like, why do they not have a tortilla steamer? (I'm guessing they throw it on the flat top to heat it up, thus the greasiness..and judging from the dirt sticking to the stainless above the grill, not a lot of cleaning goes on here). So all these publications, web writers, and other folks with now dubious taste say this place is\"the place\". Very wrong y'all, in my microbiologist/artist/burrito fanatic opinion. \nHave I ever met a burrito I won't eat? Well, apparently not yet. As I sat waiting for my food I had ample time to ponder this question as I played amateur health inspector. The waiting for yo' food chairs are next to the reach in (as opposed to walk in) reefer so you can see how dirty the food storage is. Then the eye is drawn to the hood, caked in grease immobilized dirt. I was beginning to think I should split, but, hey a burrito awaited me, a hyped burrito, so I decided to just get over it and \"take the burrito\". \nSo it was okay, just. Kind of pasty. Tortilla was what? Grilled? Not good. Mediocre with bad cleanliness means I will be walking the extra block and a half from the basketball court to La Corneta. Delicous, clean, and has one of the crankiest looking burritistas in the city. Dang, I love the cranky ones, as long as food is good.", "author": "James T."}

After  shelling out a hefty $14.50 for a shrimp quesadilla with rice and beans on the side, I was expecting a solid meal. I got the opposite, the quesadilla looked like an apple turnover, upon further inspection contained 4 shrimp? the rice and beans were portioned for an infant, and the \"platter\" itself represented nothing of a platter. the side of jicama and tomato salad I had mistaken as a garnish and the teaspoon of sour cream was only useful for adding some flavor to the beans.. which by the way cost $1.75 EACH rice AND beans totaling $ 3.50!.. oh and the waiter there wouldn't let us get another round of salsa.. 1.00 extra!  I'm not sure how this place gets away charging airport prices and serving Uno Mas quality Mexican food only 2 blocks away from Mission st, but next time I will stick to a place like Taqueria Cancun, get fresh authentic Mexican fare for half the price.. this place should check it out and take some notes....", "author": "Derek S."}

I was thrown back when she rang up $31. I asked how much each burrito costed my grilled chicken burrito costed  around $7 and change then she said the Triple Threat costed $ 19.95???????????? I could not believe it I ended up just takin it home could not think of my son not eating his burrito ahaha I thought for that price it HAS to be good and it HAS to have ton of SHRIMP and HUGE when I got home pulled it out and my burrito was small and his was big compared to mine I took a bite and thought ehh it's ok.... my son enjoyed it in the end I asked how many shrimp he said I counted 3...3 shrimp ??? For 3 SHRIMP they charged $20???? They have gone mad then I thought about t and realized I had been bamboozled NEVER again sad to say but this place is OVERRATED OVERPRICED...

Their salsa is easily one of the tastiest I've been able to find.  It's not spicy, though, so if you're into the burning tongue thing, it's best to look elsewhere.  If you love it, you can buy it by the jar, just be sure to bring back your old jar for a discount off your next refill.", "author": "Aldo K."}

I don't know if I went on an off day but it seriously did not live up to the hype I had built up in my mind about how amazing this burrito experience was going to be. I ordered the Triple Threat, mind you...a $20+ burrito...yes I agreed to pay this much because I believed it was going to be phenomenal. I've had $5 burritos that blew my mind, this $20+ one did not. Seriously disappointed. It was all meat, mind you, which wouldn't be a bad thing, except there was nothing in it to make it spectacular. A good burrito to me has a balance between the meat, cheese, salsa, rice, and beans. This was mainly just a tortilla of meat. the chicken was probably the best of the three types of meat in it. The carne asada, again, nothing to write home about, and the shrimp, totally lacking and overcooked, didn't taste very good at all, I picked them all out and set them aside.  I did enjoy the salsa that everyone is boasting about but the chips weren't great and that's half the experience when you're eating salsa. Overall, I don't think I'd go back. Bummer, I had such high hopes.", "author": "Jnzl D."}

Well, my sister decided to drag my dad and I there for lunch yesterday and I can't really say it was entirely worth it but it could be worse (like Chipotle, for example).  \n\nThe moment we got in, we ordered our food but guess what?  No seating.   I found this a little frustrating and sort of an unusual situation, since most taquerias I go to have at least some seating available.  Anyway, we finally got a table and sat down to some *delicious* salsa and chips.  I've never tasted anything like it and enjoyed it immensely.  Of course, I find out after I leave that they sell it behind the counter but oh well.  We finally got our meals.  My dad had the chilaquiles and seemed pretty satisfied about them.  I probably should have ordered that, because my shrimp tacos were shameful.  I got a measly four pieces of shrimp in each taco that I could barely see since it covered in a pile of lettuce and tomato.  I got a salad, basically, hugged inside a folded tortilla.  I grew up with TACOS: loaded with meat, dripping with pico de gallo and salsa.  These weren't tacos, not to me, at least.  \n\nI am still not convinced this place is worth all the hullabaloo, but you never know.  I might have to make a second trip.

I recently moved to the city but I'm pretty sure I have already figured out a few prerequisites to being one of the cool kids.  I've bought two pairs of tight pants, I'm looking for a hip (preferably ethnic) girlfriend, and I'm seeking to buy a vintage, multi-geared road bike.   Of course, I know a nondescript mountain bike would do me just fine, and a single speed would definitely be better, but I'm hoping for some kind of balance between style and city-bike practicality.  \n\nSo last night I was in the Mission to pick up a cheap bike I'd found on Craigslist, on my way to La Taqueria for a quick bite, when I noticed a crowd of people stuffed into a humble Mexican restaurant called \"El Papalote.\"  \n\nDespite my previous plans and a lingering nausea I thought might be the stomach flu, I decided to trust the mob's judgement, step inside and order a fish burrito.  This was the best  San Francisco burrito decision I've ever made.  These guys have figured out a secret that few of the city's other burrito-makers have discovered: if you prepare the food to-order, it actually tastes better.  The cooks pan fried the fish, slapped my tortilla on the flat top, and assembled the whole thing right behind the counter, resulting in a piping hot, delicious burrito.  The ingredients tasted quality, and the prices were reasonable.  The chips tasted fresh, and the salsa, different, but good.  On top of that, the staff was super friendly despite the crowd and I noticed they had quite a drink (beer, bottled soda, aguas frescas) selection.  Other notes: dinner entrees available, 99 cent for \"super\" burrito, and decent indoor seating.  Best Burrito I've had in the city so far.", "author": "Charles C."}

REALLY? \n\nso anyways my gf got soyrizo tacos and they were ok, but she actually makes a better one than they do. i enjoyed the \"complimentary\" side of chips and salsa, but i agree with some other reviewers on here, why are you so stingy on the salsa? if i go back and ask for more, are you gonna charge me $2? the salsa isn't your typical chunky tomato-wee cilantro type - it's more like a tomato-wee creamy kind. not much zip to it, but still good.\n\nanyways, i'm thinking i didn't order the right thing from here because my friends seem to know good food. i'm thinking i need to quit being a pussy and order a burrito with meat in it - most probably carnitas! mmm ...", "author": "James J."}

I love Mexican food, but there aren't many Mexican restaurants in the Mission that I enjoy spending any real time in. The restaurant is cute and nicely designed. Its colorful and small, but feels more cozy then crammed. The place is clean and, though it has the elements of other burrito spots around here-- you order at the counter, no servers, small place with a community vibe, it doesn't feel thrown together like other places. Its more of a spot I would go with a date I wanted to impress or didn't know very well, then the place I seek out late night when I want to stuff my face with a group of also drunk friends. \n\nThe food is good but, like a lot of Mexican restaurants, it lacks anything really distinguishing. EXCEPT, the salsa is super good. I feel the urge to repeat that last sentence. I live really close to Papalote and, on the day I moved in, two separate friends brought up the Mexican restaurant near by with the awesome salsa. The shrimp tacos were nice. The shrimp grilled in white wine and garlic. They are plated on a couple of open soft tacos with crunchy lettuce and pico de gallo, and taste very fresh. They were even better when I dumped the salsa all over them. The burritos are fine, Ive tried the carne asada, shrimp and the veggie. That's with pinto beans and guacamole. All were good, but not wet enough for my taste. \n\nThe staff are friendly. I came in with a group of friends the other night, and one of the guys put himself out for a little bit trying to reorganize tables so we could sit. \n\nThe place is pricier than its competitors, but you pay for the package. Or maybe you pay for the salsa (which, on a side note, I'm pretty sure you can buy on its own to carry out).", "author": "Roger W."}

You can pour it over anything! Oh yeah, it's served in little black containers opposed to the clear Solo cup every other Taqueira uses; it added a little piazzas. We had the Veggie Tacos..... with potato, carrot and mushroom. Very good, I give it 4 out of 5. Nice big corn tortillas filled to the gills with good stuff. Same goes for the Marinated Tofu Tacos....... Absolutely awesome! One of the best tasting achiote paste/sauces I've had in a long time. The Tofu was grilled then sauted with the achiote paste. Excellent blend! I'd go back just for this dish. Tofu gets my best rating of 5 out of 5. These guys set the bar on tofu. Tacos Mole with Chicken.....You can tell they didn't use the achiote paste here, the mole they used was in need of (never thought I'd say this) salt. The chicken was dry and not simmered in the mole to make it moist and yummy. I gave them 2 out of 5. Soyrizo tacos....were pretty good. They tasted like store bought Soyrizo with crispy chopped Romaine, tomato salsa with light onion and cilantro. Actually all the tacos had the same garnishes. I gave them 4 out of 5. Friend had a carne asada burrito.......Good Quality Meat but was tasting burnt. Beans and rice were okay, tortilla was good but a little flaky and tender, nothing to write home about. I gave the burrito 3 out of 5. \nThe food was great overall, a little slow but worth the wait. It was an order as you pay type place.

I took a seat to a few minutes later be given a brown bag with all my food in it lumped together, told that they were closing and i have to leave. At this point i was apalled and even noticed other people still eating in the restaurant. This, in my eyes, is completely unprofessional and violates the policies of proffesional establishments. I was then left to eat out of a brown bag in MY CAR. Still just thinking about it makes me angry. I urge people that there are many others eually or better places than papolote.

Based on a Bay Area DJ group, this is goodness X3 with the incorporation of carne asada, shrimp, and chicken. Only thing I couldn't believe was the price. It costs under $20. Holy shh..! My friend and I decided to split one, and also ordered some super nachos. That was already plenty, yet they threw in some chips and salsa with our order. I was able to get a bit of everything with each bite. The nachos were awesome as well. We barely got through half of it because of the Triple Threat.

I have never gone there and had my correct order handed to me. Not once have they gotten it right, and I went there roughly 20+ times. I'm visiting now and my friend & I decided to get take out. We got home and both of our orders were wrong. I was meant to have two tacos and I only received one, and my friend didn't get her chips and guacamole. So I called to complain. The girl I spoke with reluctantly said she would give it to us next time we came in. I called ahead the following day and talked with the manager. She wasn't very nice & kept stating \"it's not possible to only get one taco when it comes with two.\" She also wasn't really answering my questions. But she said she'd get it ready for us and give it to us. We drove back over there and picked it up & got home & my vegan tacos were COVERED in sour cream and cheese!!! I'm only visiting so I have no intention of ever returning. If you like getting your order correct and avoiding the waste of food by having to send it back I suggest going elsewhere. There are so many Mexican food places in SF that are capable of getting order correct and their food is equally as good, if not better. I suggest skipping Papalote unless you want to check your order thoroughly before heading home. But, like I said, they have never gotten my order correct the first time, and more than just this weekend have they gotten it wrong the second. Plus, most of the staff are VERY rude. The food is good, but not good enough to deal with this. As far as their salsa: it has always been gross to me so I never eat it. The location is good.

Many of these aforementioned neighboring taquerias serve nothing more than diarrhea wrapped in foil.  The others are by and large nothing to write home about, sans a couple gems.  Most importantly, Papalote's salsa continues to be a crowd pleasing delight that I cannot get enough of.  Although the price tag for extras thereof, and for jars to take home (a must for orders to-go, which are my usual modus operandi) continues to hurt my wallet, I haven't found a more consistently delicious and unique salsa (although for those of you who can still stomach Farolito or Cancun, here's a protip: up the ante by slathering some Papalote salsa on one those suckers, your mouths will thank you).  Because they have no qualms gouging me for this salsa and I'm still a cheap bastard, I can't quite bump this to a five, but the three-star rating I previously gave is far too low.

I like the fact that their staff is always cheerful and polite, both on the phone or in person, even though they are always super busy. I make it a point to call about 20 minutes in advance if I am picking up food because I don't want to wait in their little waiting area for a long time, hungry and watching other people devour their burritos and tacos. Their salsa is very different from other places - most people love it but I know a few people who said \"what's the deal with that orange-sauce they call salsa\".

They had a variety of beers so each of the 4 of us decided to get a taste of different ones.  Good selections! The owner Manuel was very friendly, chatted and joked with us as if he had known us before.  This was our first time here.  Now the food...we ordered a little of everything but the taco.  The popular $20 burrito, chicken dilla, and steak nacho.  I loved all of them!  Most especially the fresh grilled steaks and the smokiness and flavors of it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-05-03", "description": "While Papalote is probably one of the more gourmet Mexican cafes in the Mission, I am not sure I see what all the hype is about. I came here for an early dinner and the place was not terribly crowded- we were able to get a table without any wait. I ordered a quesadilla with grilled zucchini and eggplant. I also spent quite a bit extra ($2.75 to be exact) to have a side of guacamole with this quesadilla. Why so much  money for a little dollop of mashed avocado? Can't answer that one. The waitress was clearly confused when I placed my order, since the the overhead board said that additional sides were only a dollar. But then again I also asked her if the vegan quesadilla had cheese in it, and she said yes so I knew she was not completely with the program. After a few unsuccessful attempted inquiries as to why the guacamole was more expensive than advertised,  I decided to just let it go, as I was getting rather hungry. The food came relatively quickly- in the meantime we snacked on chips and some very spicy salsa. Again, I don't see what the hype is about. The salsa was just that- salsa. Nothing extraordinary. In fact, I prefer fresh salsa, if anything. In any event, when the much awaited quesadilla finally arrived I was very excited to see that it was chock full of roasted veggies and not overly greasy or soggy. The cheese was relatively light- a white cheese (quesa fresca perhaps?) and the roasted vegetables were a delicious compliment. I much enjoyed dipping the crispy cheesy confection in the oh so expensive guacamole. I'll probably visit this place again if I happen to be in the Mission, and look forward to trying their soy products.", "author": "Kate A."}

It was love, oh it had to be love, discovering your vegan beans, addictive salsa and mole with tofu and that glorious soyrizo.  Then there was my year long boycott because of \"Blondie,\" who on more than one occasion hung up on me, yelled at me and just gave off a generally sour and bummed out vibe that I don't really want in my life.

I walk in to Papa Lote, and the nice shorter girl smiles, says \"Super Soyrizo?\" I nod, and my food arrives a couple minutes later.  This means I'm probably mere weeks, maybe days, from going in and reaching the ultimate and ultimately revealing plateau--walking in and asking for, gulp, \"The Usual.\"  Due to my work schedule, I've reached this plateau at Love N Haight, and this, I'm fine with.

Really.  I am not talking about a scoop of pre-cooked meat from a bucket and onto the grill.  We're talkin' about a fresh raw piece of carne asada or chicken put on the grill especially for your burrito.  That's what Papalote is about.   Some people prefer McDonalds french fries over real freshly sliced potato french fries.  So if you wan't McDonalds, go to the taqueria down the street.  They're food is clearly fresh and delicious and some people aren't used to that.  They're salsa is also incredible.  For those veggies and vegans out there, this place is also the spot.

It's very exciting to look at the menu and try to decide what to get.  To me, though, most of the time, the food tastes like something a friend whipped up at the house.  There is something deadly ordinary about the flavors they coax out of the ingredients:  it never makes me groan in appreciation tinged with jealousy, wishing I could make something that tastes this good at home.  The salsa is great, but I wish they would serve it in a wide-mouthed container that would make it easier to dip chips.  And that tablespoonful of jicama thing they serve--I can't tell if it's a meager side dish or relish that lacks entirely in the zip department.  I wish they'd either drop it entirely, rework it, or come up with something else that adds excitement to the entree.  I do like that they serve good beers on tap here, in addition to the typical cerveza selection at a regular taqueria.

I really hadn't looked at the prices, but when the cashier ran up the total to 42.00 I about had a heart attack. I paid it. Then we waited, and waited and waited and waited some more. Finally got our order. It was now 3:00. We had an appointment, so I did not check our order. Enroute to the appointment my friend ate his \"shrimp burrito\"-oops, in checking the order we in fact got 2 carne asada burritos and one triple threat. Don't know how our original order translated to this...but to be fair we checked the reciept and we paid for what we got. We just did not get what I asked for. Yes, a triple threat is $20.00, but like what has been written about here before,they are the same size as the steak burrito. I will never order the triple threat again. It is really a rip.

First, the place is clean. If you care that your food is clean, this is necessary. Second, the food is fresh and not very greasy. It is simple, unassuming, and light. I recommend the fish tacos, and the seasoned tofu is surprisingly good (I usually do not like tofu). It reminds me of tandoori masala because of all the spices used. \nSo stay away of this place if:\nYou like extremely cheap and greasy Mexican food. \nYou care a lot about the people around you. Yes, there is definitely less Latin people but this is hardly the only place that has less Latin people on this side of the Mission. If you want to see Latin people stick to the ones by the Mission and to the East of it. \nBut if you are just a normal person looking for a clean and different taqueria, I recommend it.

I wouldn't mind the noisiness or the lines so much if the food had any real value, but by and large it turned out to be worse than the most mediocre of tacquerias in the mission. On my visits *(yes, I gave it two shots) I had two different kinds of burritos.  The first was a carne assada, well stuffed with thinly sliced, overcooked meat, largely tasteless, and combined with a mushy beans and rice.   The second trip was another burrito, this time a Verde, which left an even worse impression:  The pork was watery and overcooked, lacking any pork character, the sauce had an odd medicinal flavor and the beans and rice..well, you get the picture.   The only thing worthwhile was the salsa for the chips, which was both creamy and piquant.    Given the lines of people and the full (and noisy) tables, I wrote down a rule for myself: The quality of a restaurant, around Valencia anyway, is inversely proportional to its popularity (I can think of other overrated and popular mediocrities--Dosa and Beretta spring to mind).

The lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro and other auxiliary ingredients are always fresh, and the award-winning house salsa, which is made from scratch every day, is dangerously addictive and worthy of its reputation as the best salsa in the city. Unfortunately the meats -- namely, the chile verde, carne asada and grilled chicken -- tend to be dry and a bit tough, possibly because it appears that the pork, beef and chicken are cooked with virtually all their fat trimmed away; even so, they are well-seasoned and thus quite enjoyable, especially when dispatched in a super burrito, which keeps the moisture level up by way of sour cream, cheese and guacamole. Omnivores not interested in smothering their meats in such heavy condiments may want to steer toward the marinated seafood options: prawns grilled with lime juice, sauteed shrimp and sauteed fish. Papalote may not provide what most would consider traditional Mexican food, but it does offer satisfying, heart-smart innovations in Mexican cuisine.", "author": "Eugene P."}

But it's good and weird in a way so you keep going back to it until your warm, fresh chips are gone. Fear not because your carne asada burrito has arrived with that mango salsa on the side! One savory  cube per perfectly balanced bite, of course. (You can't waste the little gems, which are clearly rare given how much is on each plate.) I would almost initially dock a point for them not giving you more of that salsa, but once you master the burrito, you realize they give you the perfect amount as to not drown out all of the other excellent flavors. They throw a piece of meat on the grill  when your order it, cooked to your desire. None of that scoop-out-of-the-bin jargon. To be honest I haven't had any vegetarian here because when I think about Papalote, I smell that grill, get hungry and head over. Tall boys of PBR contribute to the 5 star rating as well.
