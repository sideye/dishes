I was in ahh once I walked in. The artwork on the outside of the walls will have anyone believing that it's an abandoned mural building (totally normal in a City like San Francisco). Walking into Foxsister takes you to a whole new world; a place where you can find delicious food, great service, and a festive atmosphere! Everything from the red booths to the purple glitter bar and the fun slushy machines definitely gives this place a unique look and feel. \n\nFor food options, we started off with the Foxsister Kimchi Nachos with the Pork Skins. The cheese reminded me of the queso sauce that was blended and topped with Korean Chili Flakes, scallions and jalapenos.  The Dungeness Crab noodles were EVERYTHING! Talking about DRUNKEN food, whoo! Make sure you order the POG slushy that goes well with all the tasty food items on the menu. Foxsister is truly known for their fun Korean vodka slushy drinks! \n\nFoxsister earns ALL 5 STARS because of their fabulous customer service. Once our lovely server found out that it was my birthday, the next thing you know, the server arrives with a birthday treat filled with ice cream, **coconut mochi, and other tasty toppings. It was the sweetest thing; THANK YOU TO OUR AMAZING SERVER FOR MAKING MY NIGHT! \n\nOther reasons why I truly love Foxsister...\n\n-Close proximity from the BART station\n-Parking is easy to find around the area\n\nLast but not least, it's a true hidden gem in the Mission! Do yourself a favor and go check this place out for yourself! \n\n*The coconut mochi was enough for me to decide that I WILL be coming back! I can eat that alone and be right in heaven; YUM!", "author": "Porsche C."}

I came on a Thursday to catch up with two of my friends, and parking wasn't too bad since it was night time. The hostess and servers were also friendly.\n\nThere were two items that we wanted to get but they didn't have it, so make sure that you have a back up dish in mind.\n\nKimchi nacho cheese dip - The chips were huge but this appetizer was a  good start before the meal. The cheese was tasty and the jalapenos had the perfect amount of spiciness.\n\nHalf chicken - We had two of each flavor, but I only tried the sweet and spicy since I was too busy talking. It was pretty sweet, but also crispy. One thing to note is that the chicken is a little smaller than many other Korean restaurants.\n \nSpicy pork bulgogi - These came with lettuce to wrap in which was nice since the pork was dry. I wasn't too fond of this dish since I've tried better at other places.\n\nSichuan short-rib egg noodles - We ate this dish last so it was somewhat cold. The noodles were a little hard and dry, but the short ribs were tender. There wasn't too much meat on it so I ended up only eating very little of this hard noodle dish.\n\nOverall this is a cute place but the food is not the best. For the price? I think I'd rather go to a spot that is cheaper and yummier.", "author": "Julian Y."}

It's really crispy and flavorful, and not overly sauced. They have a lot of other Korean dishes with a creative twist, and although we didn't try much everything tasted really good. And the soju slushies are super yummy! We tried both the POG and Blackberry flavors, and the POG was definitely much tastier (ie: less alcoholic-tasting) than the Blackberry.\n\nThe main downside is that everything here is quite pricey given the portion sizes.

The front of the restaurant stands out, painted with big, colorful geometric shapes. There's also a big window with a hanging Tiffany lamp and a neon sign that reads \"POW!\" \nI was immediately drawn to it. \n\nOnce inside, all the walls and tables are a polished black- which makes the perfect reflective surface for all the sparkling lights hanging from the ceiling. There's a black & white Audrey Hepburn mural, a Virgen Maria beaded curtain, and a disco ball in the bathroom! A cool playlist adds to the fun hipster vibe but it's not so loud that you can't have a conversation. \nI took all of this in with pleasure before I even sat down to eat. \n\nOn my first visit, I ordered the Dungeness Crab noodles. However, I didn't realize they were glass noodles, which I dislike very much. So after giving them a try, I apologetically confided in my server that I just couldn't eat them. She was super nice about taking them off my bill and asked if I wanted something else instead. And though I didn't have anything else that day, because the service was so good, I decided I'd give them a second chance. \n\nThe second time I came, I was equally impressed with the service and this time, my food and drinks were REALLY good!\nI had the Royal Mushroom Rice Cakes with soy glaze, pea vines, and sesame seeds. I couldn't get enough! The soft chewy rice cakes paired well with the crunchy greens and had a delightfully sweet, toasted flavor. \nIt was vegetarian and gluten free. Therefore, it was also Guilt Free. \n\nI wanted to order a Soju Slushie but couldn't decide on a flavor so my server suggested we combine the Pina Colada and the Passion fruit together. Genius! They were beautifully layered together and delicious! \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Neapolitan Banana Split. I expected the classic version but this was much better- The bananas were completely coated in a crunchy caramel coating! Topped, of course, with whipped cream, sprinkles, peanuts, cherries, and chocolate syrup. \n\nIt was the perfect way to end a perfect dining experience. The lights, music, food, drinks, and service were on point and I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Mitzi G."}

I made same day reservations for a Thursday and 6:30 pm and there was plenty of availability.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks pretty cool. It's very dimly lit with strings of lights and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. It's a large space and feels quite spacious, as the tables are fairly spread out and there is a lot of room to walk. We were seated in a booth in front of the small bar which had two TVs, so theoretically you could come here for a game. They were playing two different movies when we were there.\n\nSo why the low rating? My friends and I all agreed the food was way overpriced for the portion and taste. My small bowl of crab noodles set me back $19, and it was very mediocre. And did I mention the portion was pretty small? Good thing I wasn't hungry, or I would've walked out still hungry. I had asked the server prior to ordering whether it was spicy or not, and she said no, but it would've been nice for her to mention that it does come with some sliced red peppers and jalapenos. I had to pick out all the red peppers and accidentally bit into some jalapenos, so not a great meal for me.\n\nMy friends shared two dishes including the shrimp and chive dumplings. It was pretty ridiculous to all of us that you only get 5 dumplings for the $15 you pay, which averages out to a pricey $3/dumpling. Our server asked if we wanted to get an extra dumpling to make sharing easier, and sure enough, they charged $3 for the last dumpling.\n\nThe one positive I did notice was that their menu is very vegetarian friendly for a Korean spot with both veggie apps and entrees. I have some vegetarian friends, so it's something I've started paying attention to. \n\nI am generally willing to spend money on good food, but the whole experience here was very lackluster and not worth the ridiculous prices they charge.", "author": "Dianna H."}

Anyway, today the item was octopus?\n\n50 minutes later, I'm looking at a small takeout box of octopus rice cakes. Well, focus on the rice cakes. For $18, you get 10 penny sized pieces of octopus (really tender, well cooked), and a decent snack size portion of rice cakes. Edit: Actually, I found some more octopus slices below-- so maybe 15% octopus to 85% rice cake ratio.\n\nThe color certainly looked promising, but I found the whole thing to be quite bland for Korean food. It was slightly spicy, had good wok flavor / oily smell, but was lacking in the tastebuds department. The thinly sliced carrots and onion they threw in there added some good sour flavors to the dish. The rice cakes were a good amount of chewy and were decently separated.\n\nIf the prices dropped a bit, I think the place would be more appealing to a wider variety of people.

This was actually quite moist and tender, although correspondingly not as lean as we had expected.  Great dish\n- bok Choy and mushroom- bok Choy is hard to make exciting, so it wasn't, but it was their only real vegetable option so we chose it. There was a great sauce and the mushrooms were delicious.  \n- black bean garlic noodles - these were really saucy and tasty - nice to have the carbs/starch.  I think the dungeness crab noodles would have been a bit lighter.  But we enjoyed this selection. \n\nThe decor is definitely a little trendy and funky, and the music was pretty loud (we caught 80s music).

About 3 blocks from the Bart station, it's the most colorful spot there. It's pretty warm and dim inside. Also warning, your clothes will smell like you went to kbbq upon leaving this establishment. Service is great. Pretty pricey for the portion size.\n\nThoughts:\nPina Colada $12: Pretty good flavor. Your standard pina colada.\n\nDragon Bowl Z $15: A lot of ice on top. Fruity but decent. Best to share with the table if no one is sick (they give you straws to drink from)\n\nDungeness Crab Noodle $22: My favorite dish of the night. Prob because I like jap chae in general. An OK amount of crab. I just didn't like the small bowl portion for the price.\n\nA lot of chicken $36 (whole chicken): I tried all 3 flavors. They gave about 3 pieces per flavor, 9 pieces in total. Huge pieces tho. I wished they were smaller so we can get more pieces for everyone to try the different flavors. Like instead of 3 big pieces, have 6 smaller pieces. The garlic soy was the most flavorful in my opinion. So I'd get that over the other 2. The sweet and spicy was not really spicy at all. The OG recipe was super dry.\n\nPork Fried Rice $12: This was spicy but was good. Small portion tho.\n\nSpicy Pork Bulgogi $18: Not too spicy but was definitely spicier than the chicken. This dish was accompanied by lettuce wraps, radish, jalapenos, raw sliced garlic, and I think miso paste. It was ok, a lot of pieces were stuck to the plate and burned.\n\nOverall, price was high for portion size. I recommend getting the crab noodles. Everything else was just ok.", "author": "Benita M."}

The some chicken had pieces of breast, a drumstick, I think a wing, etc. We got two pieces each of the sweet & spicy and soy garlic, and one of the og. The og was actually my favorite. It was salty, savory, and crunchy. I normally love soy garlic, but it was a little two salty. My gf doesn't really eat Korean food, so she wanted to try the other two dishes. I enjoyed the kalbi, but part of the fun is eating the meat on the bones. I did miss that as this dish was boneless. I'm not a huge pancake person, but my gf liked it.\n\nAs for drinks, I decided to start with a glass of bubbly and then try one of their soju slushies. It unfortunately didn't taste very alcoholy and was too sweet, so I ordered a bottle of soju to add more liquor to it. Tasted much better afterwards. My gf had never had soju, so she enjoyed it. They bring it to you with a whole lemon which I loved. I didn't even have to use the cap to cut a hole as they already did it.

The staff kindly accommodated changes because Mr. Diva was being his difficult self (we all have that one friend who thinks they're Mariah Carey right?) Thank you, Kristina! \n\nI love Korean food so we went in a group to sample more things on the menu. Aside for charging for banchan, the prices are reasonable for Korean food in The Mission. \n\nFair warning, don't go in expecting traditional Korean food or anything similar served in typical Korean restaurants because you'll be sorely disappointed. It's has more Korean elements than Namu Gaji though. \n\nWe wanted to try a little bit of everything so our group ordered half of the menu (listed from Fav to Least Fav):\n\n*Banchan: Kimchi, pickles, snacks ($8): http://bit.ly/2yUHoaz\n*Garlic Fries w/ spicy kewpie ($7)\n*Basket of Wings ($12 each): http://bit.ly/2fXDF4s\n--O.G. Seaweed Salt\n--Sweet & Spicy\n--Soy-Garlic\n*Oxtails in Bone Marrow Broth w/ pickled daikon, [missing] rice cakes ($16): http://bit.ly/2zbl0L0\n*Grilled Pork Belly (Bossam style) w/ daikon wraps, spicy miso paste ($18): http://bit.ly/2i17cOY\n*Fried Oysters w/ spicy kewpie ($12): http://bit.ly/2yCHI1J\n*Kimchi Hellfire Soup w/ tofu, pork belly ($12 + $2 egg): Sorry, no pic.\n*Spicy Octopus Rice Cakes ($16): http://bit.ly/2yby2tM\n*Slow-Cooked Ribs: Braised, Grilled, Glazed (Stack - $14): http://bit.ly/2yCx8Yo\n*Pork Fried Rice w/ egg, scallion, kimchi ($12): http://bit.ly/2ycXaQy\n*Grilled Kalbi Short Ribs w/ garlic + pear marinade ($22): Never came so it was removed from our bill.\n\nTable favs was the banchan, particularly the kimchi which was perfectly fermented and very flavorful, and the dried anchovies w/ almonds. I know some people will shake their fists for having to pay for something that's traditionally complimentary and bottomless at all Korean restaurants but these were very well-made. \n\nWe also liked the Garlic Fries which were hot, crunchy, and had good garlic and onion flavor.\n\nI loved the O.G. Seaweed Salt Wings for the simplicity. The Sweet & Salty and Soy-Garlic Wings were too salty. \n\nThe Oxtails in Bone Marrow seems to be their take on Sullungtang. The oxtails were meltingly tender with a milky broth. Sadly, it was missing the rice cakes and it was odd to find pickled daikon in the soup. \n\nI was most excited for the Pork Belly (Bossam) but it was very chewy and oversalted. The daikon wraps were fantastic though...nice and pickley. \n\nThe Pork Fried Rice was wet and clumpy. It had lots of eggs + onions but missing the pork. \n\nUnfortunately, the other dishes were crazy salty or burnt. I hate sending back food and felt terrible for doing so but we had to send back the Kimchi Hellfire Soup (aka soondubu), Spicy Octopus Rice Cakes, and Slow-Cooked Ribs (strong acrid flavor) which were inedible. They ended up taking these off our bill which I appreciate. \n\nOhhh make sure to try their Soju slushies aka silent creeper. One glass of the Watermelon Ginger-Lime slushie ($8): http://bit.ly/2yCKLH1 and the room was spinning...in a good way. \n\nThe staff is really friendly and receptive to feedback which I really appreciate. Some of our orders were wrong and one dish never came but it's their first day so they'll get into their groove soon. \n\nCute, retro vibe with string lights and hooker red leather booths. \n\nParking...not bad on weeknights in this part of The Mission. \n\nDefinitely stop by Foxsister for their KFC and Soju slushies!

It's food for a part of 2-4 and they're on the heavier side being fried. But the flavors are amazing! \n\nTo share we had the: pork bulgogi, crab noodles and octopus rice cakes. Our fav was the bulgogi they came in a lettuce wrap with jalape\u00f1os and a sauce to add - very tasty! The pork meat came on a skillet I loved he flavors. The crab noodles were delicious but for price on the skimpy side. Although I felt like we ordered a lot of food the portions were kind of stingy for the inflated price. The octopus rice cakes weren't good I wanted to like hem but they lacked flavor and all fried and heavy. I wouldn't order this again! \n\nThe wine list is somewhat limited but given we went on a hot day they had some chilled red ones that paired well.\n\nOverall, good food and ambiance a little stingy on portions but a fun spot to try!", "author": "Priya S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-01-16", "description": "Restaurant is really beautiful with an existential hipster vibe. The banchan is thoughtful and super delicious, but it stops there. \n\nFor a Korean vibe restaurant, the banchan should be a part of your meal. It's not. You pay $8 for it and don't even get re-fills. I get that it could be costly to do so, but if we ask for extra kimchee, is it really going to break the bank to give us more? You should at least offer 1 re-fill. (We were 2 people) We thought our server was friendly-- but she wasn't great at attending to us. \n\nWe had to ask for white rice three times. Each time the runner dropped off the food, she looked stressed at how our table had so much stuff on it. If that's the case, please be thoughtful to shift things around -- or, the server should've helped you. (The restaurant was not that busy for a Monday) \n\nThe short rib was good (but they should clarify there's no bones), the soup wasn't very flavorful. Don't call it \"hellfire\" if it's not that spicy. Give the option for levels of spiciness. It's was literally just tofu soup, without much tofu. Then they charge you an additional $3 for pork belly and then $3 for egg (which was the best part of that meal). Make it that great so that we are licking the soup from the bowl.\n\nWe also had a basket chicken wings, all 3 flavors, which was recommended by the server. I didn't even get past 1 -- they were huge, over battered, and didn't have much sauce on it. I would've rather it be smaller and more flavorful.\n\nOverall, great vibe, first Korean restaurant in the Mission, but I won't come back. I love Korean food and go often in LA. If they're going to charge these prices, they need to be excellent about the quality of the food to match it. With so many other restaurant choices in the area, and the location not actually being on Mission Street, I recommend that they need to fix these things to get repeat customers. To reiterate, I wouldn't be so price sensitive if your food was extraordinary.\n\nOn top of this, for a $100+ bill after tip/tax-- our server didn't even remember to give us our leftovers.\n\nWe didn't remember because we left the restaurant to go to a divey bar 3 blocks away because the wine she poured me for $13 didn't even come up to half the glass. We would've stayed there for more drinks if you were more thoughtful about your pours. Also, $15 for a bottle of regular soju? You know you can get the same bottle at a Korean store for $3, right? Recommend re-pricing this. \n\nWe finally remembered about 30 minutes later about our leftovers, and didn't even bother to walk back to grab it. It solidified my thoughts on this place.", "author": "Cindy T."}

Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Loved that the \"stuff\" (ground beef, bean sprout, chive) was on the inside rather than piled on top. Dipping sauce was a lovely balance of salty, sour, and sweet. \n- Grilled kalbi short rib SSAM (lettuce wraps)--meat was flavorful, but slightly overdone (dry, charred). I loved the accompaniments--chili sauce was a healthy level of spice, and the thin-sliced daikon (white radish) added a refreshing crunch where the softer end of lettuce leaves can't. The pickled garlic was awesome--I was eating clove on clove by the end.  \n- Bok choy--bok choy was chopped up into small pieces, which made it difficult to eat more than a bit at a time. Would appreciate the choice between whole and chopped. On the oily side, though the flavors were nice and the presentation (microgreens are go) was lovely. \n\nDidn't have the chance to try the soju slushies, but from the menu alll concoctions sounded compelling, creative, and tasty!\n\nSERVICE:\nThe server was polite enough, but when we had gone 45 minutes without our food (and watched adjacent tables seated, receive their food and leave within our seating), we at this point decided to leave, and asked if we could cancel the check. At this point, the manager came over and offered to comp most of the meal. She was incredibly courteous and empathetic and apologized for the ait. The server for the rest of the meal maintained a strained but perfectly cordial relationship with us (sounds like she may have been reprimanded--it's definitely chaotic starting out at a restaurant, and I hope she knows we did not mean anything personally. We were just hungry.) While obviously the service was far from ideal, their handling of the situation was so graceful that I cannot ding significantly. This kindness ensured I would be a repeat customer versus Foxresister each time I walked by on 24th :). \n\nAMBIANCE: This is both a hip and cozy space--the exterior is a geometric quilt of color with a leather-upholstered bench outside for people to wait. Loosely strung chili and lantern lights illuminate the darkly painted walls, and artwork is loud and bright, popping sensation in your field of vision like good gochujang does on your taste buds!\n\nideal for a first date, especially if you don't have much to talk about (decor is stimulating and the music's loud.

I ended up having Korean food again the next day somewhere else and the total for three people was HALF of what dinner for two cost here.\n\nOne main issue is we ordered a bunch of items (Fried Oysters, Crab Noodles, Short Rib, Bubble Tea Flan for dessert) and the short ribs took FOREVER to come out. The staff had zero accountability on how slow it was to get to our table. The first two dishes came within the first ten minutes and then twenty five more minutes later the last dish finally comes out. The timing was sooooo off and we were awkwardly sitting there with no food for so long. Our waitress said they were purposely timing it like that but wtf? We were cold and hungry. \n\nThe drinks were good. We got a bottle of soju and two slushies. The slushies were bomb but the bottle was over priced. I do liked how they came with a lemon and the waitress squeezed the lemon into our shot glasses before pouring the soju but she also squeezed out lemon seeds into my shot glass and kept pouring soju over it like did she think I was going to take the shot with lemon seeds in it? They should get those lemon seed sieves I've seen at seafood restaurants if they're going to do that. \n\nThe decor was great and I love the disco light in the bathroom. It was very easy to get a last minute reservation here and was able to park right around the corner from it. I love how they label the GF options which is super handy but I can't get over how slow the food was to come out and the crazy prices. Around $140 for dinner for two.

Also, the pop-up brunch they've been doing all month, \"Benedict\", has been such a treat. And a hidden gem. Last day they may do it is August 12th so get in while you can. \n\nEight different Benny's: my favorites so far are The Mission (al pastor pork shoulder, avocado, lime, hollandaise) and the The Crab Roll (fresh dungeness crab, avocado, buttered brioche, herb hollandaise). They've got a burger, delicious bacon, and an amazing heirloom tomato salad with cucumbers, edamame, mozzarella, and fermented chili (it's refreshing and light, but has an incredible flavor that is very unique).\n\nHow could I forget...bottomless mimosa's and bloody mary's.

I had the peach daiquiri one, and it was delicious.\n\nMy friend and I ordered family style so we could try more food.\n\nBanchan (kimchi, bean sprouts, anchovies, mushrooms for $8): If you're expecting to get your banchan for free, Foxsister is not the place for you! You get four small dishes, and the best one is the kimchi. Not worth the $8.\n\nBasket of garlic/soy wings ($12): These wings are lightly breaded and incredibly delicious. They come with daikon (yes!) and they're crispy, hot, and perfectly flavorful. We wanted more than we got! In the basket, you get six wings, and it's the whole chicken wing!\n\nSpicy octopus rice cakes ($16): I love Korean style rice cakes, but these weren't the best I've ever had. They were mushy and not crispy, and the octopus was a little overcooked. The flavor was good thought.\n\nGrilled kalbi shortrib ($20): These are meant to be lettuce wrapped, which I personally dislike. The kalbi comes off the bone, and I wish they had given you the bone portion - that's where the most flavor is! The kalbi itself was a little burnt and didn't have any sauce or flavoring on it, so this ended up being a pretty bland dish.\n\nOverall, Foxsister is promising, but I would steer you towards trying some of their more unique and fusion-y dishes, rather than the more traditional-style Korean dishes. I'll definitely be back for the wings and the slushies!", "author": "Christina S."}

For the 5 of us, came out to $200+ for what amounted to 2 rounds of drinks and a couple of apps. \n\nIf you do want to come would recommend coming with a few people so you can share things, making reservations ahead of time and being prepared to spend a little more than you want to.", "author": "Sarina Y."}

Atmosphere definitely feels like a club/lounge...really dim lights and lots of lush decorations. We were the only Asian-American representation in the restaurant...and honestly felt a bit out of place at a supposedly Korean restaurant.\n\nFor a party of three, we spent over $100 and I left hungry. The portions are insanely small and the prices outrageous. We ordered:\n\n$14 - Pork Belly Buns (3) - This was a special that was not printed on the menu. This was my favorite of the night--good flavor and juicy pork belly.\n$19 - Dungeness Crab Jap Chae - Jap Chae was mediocre and served in a small bowl, but somehow adding a few pieces of crab in it justifies an outrageous price. Jap chae is often served as the free banchan at other Korean restaurants so it's outrageous to me that a SMALL portion would cost $19.\n$19 - Some Fried Chicken - We got the mixed flavors. They were alright. Chicken was juicy but I didn't find it to be especially crispy and this is supposedly what they are known for.\n$25 - Kalbi Short Rib - I suppose the flavors were good, but it was a small portion and I'm also used to this being served on the bone--more authentic that way! Also, they sliced it up super thin--maybe they're trying to make more pieces so it looks larger? This was a small plate and served without rice. The waitress kept on trying to push us to order rice...which was an extra $3 charge. Hard pass on that because umm...I can make rice myself.\n\nAlso, charging for banchan is just wrong to me on a philosophical level. The waitress explained it was because the ingredients they source are organic but it still didn't explain the hefty price tag.\n\nNow, I really don't mind paying more for good food. But, the thing is, is that this Korean fusion food was NOT all that great, served in outrageously tiny servings, and the price tags were literally double what I'd be willing to pay. \n\nAfter ordering 4 dishes for 3 people, and eating every last bite on all of the teeny tiny plates, dropping over $100, we each left unsatisfied. By the time I walked out the door, I was already hungry again. I would not come here again. This restaurant basically epitomizes everything that annoys me about SF food culture: cares more to be hipster/trendy than delicious/authentic and slaps on an outrageous price tag with less food.", "author": "Jess Y."}

Huge pieces, and super crispy, served with a side of warm cheese to dip, just lovely!  I wasn't too big on the wings cause they weren't as crispy as i imagined. The flavor was good though.

I understand for the other real food options you have on here, but that's stupid ridiculous. \n\nAlso, one of the waiters was extremely rude to a patron, when they were waiting for more than 30+minutes for their take out(might've been Postmates).

The mission district is a good  location, and they actually have a innovative blind wine list, certainly a novelty in a Korean restaurant!  While our discussion about the veracity of the cuisine to its heritage was at times overshadowed by the visual overload and music, we both agreed that this modern interpretation is in keeping with a good soju bar with fresh, imaginative street food.  \n\nOne of my favorite Korean restaurants (outside of Korea) is Modern Korean in Vienna.  When you travel to Vienna, it is a must try restaurant. There, the food is elevated to a gourmands palate, however both places strike me with their personal attention to their guests and shared joy in the complex flavors.\n\nA few of the standouts that we ordered were Oxtails in marrow broth,  spicy octopus rice cakes, and dungeness crab noodles.

It's a fun spot with decent food but don't come here if you are looking for a traditional Korean restaurant. My friend and I stopped in for a late Sat dinner around 9pm and were seated right away. \n\nWe got the rice cakes with octopus, the ban chan and some drinks. We liked the pina colada slushy (did I mention this place feels like the 90s?) and the octopus rice cakes; the sauce on the rice cakes reminded me of really good orange peel chicken - kind of sweet and citrusy while also being umami rich and just a little spicy.  The ban Chan ($8) were the only disappointment to me- the kim chi didn't taste fresh/sweet (more just vinegary) and the other sides were also uneventful - I think the usual stuff they serve in Santa Clara's K-town for free is better. \n\nStill, I'm happy to have a fun spot to satisfy late night spicy food cravings in my neighborhood!", "author": "Jean L."}

The rice cake had a very good sauce and the crispy sweet potato gave it a light crunch component that really put it over the top.  The bulgogi was sizzling, saucy, and perfect with the fermented miso and pickled daikon. (I wish there had been a bit more of a char on the bulgogi, the parts that had a little char were outstanding.)\n\nDefinitely recommend both dishes!

That was the only thing that was large.  Everything else was painfully small.  Delicious but small.  Tiny flecks of crab in the noodles, little bits of octopus in the rice cakes.  We decided we wanted dessert after since we were still kind of hungry, so we ordered what was described by one wait staff as lime donuts and another as lemon donuts.  They were actually completely devoid of citrus, just plain donut holes.  They came with a spicy Chocolate dipping sauce, that had nary a whiff of spice.  So why the four stars?  The place was really cosy and festive, and the staff was friendly.

Head's up, it includes 4 dishes: kimchi, bean sprouts, dried anchovies, and mushrooms. I wish the menu listed these.\n\nThe watermelon slushie was just ok for me. It tasted like watermelon that was too ripe (lol, I'm a princess, I know). But it's hard to compare another drink to the perfect froz\u00e9.\n\n- re: HIGH LIGHTS -\nThe service was great, especially for their 2nd day. Our waiter was attentive and fun to talk to.\n\nThe space had a fun party vibe. There were strings of little lights and fun artwork on the walls. The music is pretty loud, making this a great location for a group dinner. Probably not the best place for a serious date.\n\n- OVERALL -\nI can't get over how awesome the froz\u00e9 was. Can you tell? I've only mentioned it 3 times. While this restaurant seems great for groups, I can't wait to return to Foxsister and get a froz\u00e9 and basket of wings for myself.", "author": "Jiann M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-11-20", "description": "TL;DR food was decent but expensive. Wings are good, but slightly on the salty side.\n\nSoju was $15. I can't get over the fact that a bottle of soju was $15. At a Korean market you'll find soju at roughly $2 just for reference. At most Korean bars the price ranges from $3-8. \n\nThey also charge for banchan which in my book is a huge no-no for Korean restaurants. The only thing keeping this from being a 2-star rating is my compassion for restaurant owners who have to pay high overheads due to soaring rent and cost of living.\n\nPitchers are served here and are actually much more affordable to than the soju, so if you want to drink some beers and enjoy wings with friends this could be the place for you. The wife and I ordered the Garlic soy wings, sweet & spicy wings, pork kimchee fried rice, fried oysters, and a bottle of $15 soju. \n\nThe wings are good. 5 actual wings (or 10 if you go to an American wing place) are served with each order. Sweet and spicy was our favorite. Fried oysters were delicious, crunchy yet juicy on the inside. The fried rice was meh. \n\nIf I were to go back, it would only be for the wings and pitchers, and the fact that it's walking distance from where I live. \n\nThe restaurant is also located very close to the 24th/mission Bart station. Parking sucks in that area so try to take public transportation or Lyft.\n\nLastly there is a bar and TV if you want to come watch a game, but fyi half the restaurant is out of view from the TV.", "author": "Andrew E."}

Can't go wrong with that.\n\n- Pork Fried Rice: simple but great - the pork was nice and crispy\n\n- Grilled Kalbi Shortrib: excellent flavor; this is meant to be put in lettuce wraps with soybean paste\n\n- Some Chicken: half a chicken - delightfully spicy, and I liked the fact that they provided some boneless chicken pieces as well\n\nWe had the Soju Froze slushies which were good :) We also had the Hite beer - came out super cold which is awesome.\n\nService was a bit on the slow side but given that they just opened, I'm sure that won't be an issue after a week or two.\n\nWill definitely be returning!", "author": "Matt S."}

Went for a pre xmas family gathering, they took reservations and sat us in a comfortable booth. Very fun interior and concept-- ordered a ton of stuff but highlights were the bulgogi, anything with rice cakes, and those mushrooms in the box choy. Chef came out and picked up dishes just to check out the floor, seemed like a great environment to work.", "author": "Nina S."}

The red booths, the purple glitter bar and slushy machines are a nice pop of color. As for the food: The Kimchi Nacho Cheese Dip with Pork Cracklings was a great way to start. The Dumplings and Dungeness Crab Noodles were delicious. The Sweet and Spicy Chicken was fantastic. The Slow Cooked Ribs were my favorite. Fall off the bone, melt in your mouth tender. I should have ordered a rack instead of a stack because they were so good I ordered another helping. I might have ordered a 3rd but the Pork Fried Rice sent me over the top. Filled with big chunks of pork and lots of flavor. My daughter loved the chocolate cupcake with the sparkler. We can't wait to go back and try some more of the menu. Foxsister is a hit!

You may think it's another Korean place but you'd be mistaken if you think that. For example, take the wings, they're not just any wings but coated with sweet n spicy gochujang sauce was out of this world. Writing about it makes me crave it even more. Then the Dungess crab noodles, now these came with potato starch vermicelli that were actually clear. I'd rate these 4.5 stars but the five star dish and the winner of the day was spicy octopus rice cakes. If there's only one dish you're gonna order here, this is gonna be it. I wish I'd taken pics, but man the food is worth coming back again and again. Also, I've been told that the executive chef is from The Slanted Door so I guess the finesse in the food is understandable.", "author": "N N."}

The rice wine was unfiltered sake meets squirt so we didn't run it back but the soju kept pouring. They did this funny thing where they scooped the top of the lemon, which makes sense but think I will remain a wedge man. Let's see, also had crab noodles and fried chicken. Noodles were tasty but since this is the flour and water crew I expected avant-garde. Dried fried chicken, which I guess was the classic, was lovely while the wet was overwhelming with flavor.", "author": "Brendan M."}

The menu is a mix of some authentic dishes as well as some with a little more American flare. If your menu choices lean to the hotter side, be sure to get one of the soju slushee to quell the fire ( watermelon-ginger is my favorite). Had the same server on both occasions.

This all is just to get you in the mood for what's to come from the kitchen and bar. \nThe menu is playful yet true to Korean cuisine. Meant to be shared family style and enjoyed by everyone in your table. The fried chicken is amazing !!!! I recommend it you get \"Around the world\" so you can try all three flavors. (Sweet & Spicy, Ginger soy, OG). The Banchan, pork & beef dumplings, Oxtail Stew, Kalbi short rib, Pork fried rice was what we ordered. Every bite was on point ! One bite better the the rest.

Brought my fellow foodie friend to get an extra set of taste bud. To our disappointment, they were out of the glazed pork ribs and the spicy octopus rice cakes, but there were plenty of other mouth watering sounding items on the menu. We ended up ordering the kimchi nacho dip, the sweet chili chicken wings, the kimchi hellfire stew and the spicy pork bulgogi. The kimchi nacho dip came with lotus chips and giant pork grinds, very creative. The dip was pretty good but we really couldn't taste any kimchi. The kimchi hellfire stew had little spices, which begs the question why call it hellfire? The sweet chili chicken wings were large, crispy and juicy. However, they were too salty and really didn't taste sweet nor spicy. The spicy pork bulgogi we thought was on point. Had very good flavor! The lettuce leaf wraps were an interesting side as opposed to the traditional steamed rice. Overall, we both agreed the food was good but not great, being on the pricey side.", "author": "John C."}

I made reservations for 2 at 6pm without realizing the restaurant didn't open until 6pm so it was actually perfect timing! We ordered white rice, a Stack (5 pieces) of Slow Cooked Ribs, and Spicy Pork Bulgogi to share. The ribs had incredibly rich flavor and the meat was literally falling off the bone. They were well-cooked, well-coated in sauce, and we finished them off easily. The Spicy Pork Bulgogi was sizzling when it arrived at our table and came complete with lettuce wraps. It was a refreshing relief from all the heat (flavor/temperature) and my boyfriend was absolutely in love with the flavor. We definitely crave spicy foods so this pair was perfection. Our server was fantastic, checked on us multiple times, and gave us much needed extra lettuce wraps to eat up everything! I also loved the d\u00e9cor and ambiance. Normally I gravitate away from establishments that are low lit but with the mirror mosaic, candlelit tables, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony bumpin there really was nothing to complain about.

We had a reservation on Friday night at 6p when the place opened, and there was already a line forming when we arrived early. When we were seated, it seemed like entire restaurant was already full! We ordered the chicken \"around the world\", a few pieces of each flavor, octopus rice cakes, and the kimchi nachos for an appetizer. Everything was delicious, but I would say that the octopus and kimchi nachos stood out to me the most even though the place has been blogged about for their chicken. We split these items among two of us and had leftovers--I think this would have been perfect for three hungry people, or expect to bring food home. I found myself talking about this place for a few weeks after I went and have already recommended it to friends.

We shared a bottle and a Hite beer. The decor is so kitschy and awesome. The mural outside is punchy and gorgeous, and all the little decor elements inside make it feel funky and fun. The menu is hard to read - we almost couldn't find the fried chicken because it's in a different color than the rest of the items. The drink menu had a ton of great beer (some Asian brands and some local craft stuff) and soju slushies - it might be one of my favorite drink menus ever. The banchan were all wonderful - must order to go with everything else. Korean Fried Chicken was great - the sweet and spicy sauce was perfect with a citrusy note that made them addictive. The order of fried oysters was large (probably 10-12 oysters) and the breading was phenomenal. We got talked into the yuba bulgogi by the server but I wish we had ordered the crab noodles like we originally wanted. I think if served with rice the yuba bulgogi would be good but it didn't really work as a wrap. Service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be back - I want to try the crab noodles and kimchi nacho cheese dip! One small drawback is that it's pretty expensive - but Korean fusion in SF tends to be pricey.

I had a glass of Lambrusco and it was thee best I've ever had. We had the octopus rice cakes which were excellent, then we had the kimchi stew which had these delicious little chunks of pork belly. We also had the ribs that just fell off the bone, a little sweet and a little spicy. The Kalbi short ribs and pork Bulgolgi were served with lettuce wraps and were definitely the star of the show.  Everything was seasoned perfectly. It cost about $50 a person which if you've ever gone out to eat in SF ain't that expensive.
