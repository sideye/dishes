Of all the Thai restaurants I've been to so far, I'd have to say this spot serves the tastiest pad thai! I've only been here and ordered this once so I really hope it wasn't just a good day for them cause I plan to keep going back. It was really packed for lunch time on a weekday so I assume they're a pretty good restaurant overall. The pad Thai was sweet and flavorful and not dry! Cooked well even when it was a full house. They give a pretty decent portion size but it is pretty pricey for what it is. I'll definitely be back to order this again and also try other dishes! \n\nGiving this spot only 4 stars because they messed up on 2 of my friends' orders and the waitress rolled her eyes and tried to make them feel like they told her the wrong orders. I clearly heard their order but the waitress must have been too busy to try to make sure she got their order right.\n\nCame on a Friday during lunch at 11:45am and it was pretty much packed already if I didn't make reservations. Passed by on weekend nights and it's usually packed so I suggest making reservations! Parking can be a bit difficult.", "author": "Valerie T."}

Noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce wasn't too heavy. The vegetables and beef were cooked well and weren't just sparsely thrown around into the dish.\n\nFriend ordered the indian pancake and upon first sight, it looked pretty good. The taste, on the other hand, didn't turn out to par - the pancake was a bit too light and oily for my liking. Takes the cake for presentation though!\n\nOverall was a good experience as the food was satisfactory and ambiance was beautiful. Don't know if I would go out of my way to come back but I certainly wouldn't mind if I did.", "author": "Isabelle W."}

For the entrees, we ordered Pad Ke-Mao and the Jungle Beef - both of which satisfied our hunger.

I had even looked over their menu online to see what they served but it really was nothing like what we were handed when we sat down.\n\nMy friend ordered the Spicy Basil w/Chicken and I went with the Sweet and Sour Lover w/ Chicken. We also decided to go with the Chicken Fried Rice instead of the normal steamed rice. \n\nWhile my food was decent, he wasn't much of a fan of his. I think that had alot to do with his expectation of it being similar to the dinner dish he normally orders, unfortunately for him it wasn't the case. The fried rice was also ok. Overall, everything really lacked spice for me, from the soup to the fried rice nothing had any sort for spice or seasoning. With that said I would like to come back because I feel that if I tell them to spice my order up it would make a huge difference. Will be back one day.", "author": "Harman B."}

She ended up forgetting one of the drinks and we had to place another order in with another guy, who also failed to place the order.\n\nShrimp chips:  complimentary app from the restaurant.  Wish the waiter could have told us that after dumping it off at the table and took off without saying anything.\n\nPapaya salad:  solid.  Tart and spicy.  Strong flavors of fish sauce and lime.  \n\nStuffed eggplant with green curry:  interesting idea wrapping minced chicken with eggplant.  Texture's interesting and all but nothing special in terms of flavor as chicken was somewhat tasteless.  Green curry however was well balanced in terms of sweetness and savoriness.  Not too heavy nor too sweet.\n\nPad Ke-moo:  the spicy wide noodles lacked the heat as promised in the title. The skirt steak slices felt like they were boiled in water dumping into the plate with the rest of the greens and noodles.  \n\nAfter receiving the check, from the same girl that placed the order earlier, a credit card was placed in the plastic card slot.  Another ten minutes went by before we got her attention and she looked at us confused and frozen solid like a deer staring at the headlights of a vehicle.

We asked if we could return it and the waitress was super rude, fighting with us about how there was no fish sauce in the dish. I didn't know why they were so worked up, i thought they would offer to change it or be nice enough to take it back and not fuss so excessively.

This could have also been to my hangry state (to everyone's dismay). \n\nWe ended up spotting some seats at the bar and quickly pulled up seats. Side note, the bartender did not acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes (but it felt like 30, again, hangry).\n\nWe eventually put in food orders and moods were improved all around. We had some mild food allergies (peanuts and bell peppers) among the group and I was pleasantly surprised how easily they accommodated this/ were able to remove from our dishes of choice (even more impressed Bc this meant things were being prepped to order). \n\nMeal was good, my favorites were the fresh rolls and eggplant and shiitake dish. Would pass on the coconut braised pork shoulder curry which was a bit disappointing, I found the meat tough. \n\nAll in all, probably would not go out of my way to return, but if you find yourself in the area this is a solid choice for elevated Thai.

The food and drinks are definitely higher quality and the flavors are on point. That being said, it is a bit on the pricey end for what it is. Granted this is SF but having spent so much time in Southeast Asia, it is hard to wrap my head around the enormous difference in price.\n\nDespite the price, I have been to Basil twice already mainly due to the authenticity of flavors.

The praram rong song (grilled marinated skirt steak with house curried-peanut sauce and steamed vegetables) was tender and delicious, especially with the peanut sauce, and the kang gari gai (slow-cook 1/2 chicken, onions, & potatoes in mild yellow curry) was fall off the bone delicious and perfect after a chilly December day in San Francisco.\n\nDinner prices are extremely reasonable, especially considering we had enough of each entree to take home for leftovers.

We got the radish cakes, corn fritters, pumpkin pork red curry, and fried catfish. My overall impressions were that the food was on the oily side (this is perhaps we ordered fried things only) and that the herbs they used stood out compared to other Thai spots I've been to.\n\nThe radish cakes were basically like Chinese ones, except without the mushroom and sausage that are in the Chinese version. I didn't like that they were so fried, but my coworkers did. A 3/5 for me.\n\nThe corn fritters may not have been as crunchy as they could have since we got delivery. They were floury and the corn was more broken up. Tasty, but not too memorable.\n\nThe pumpkin pork red curry had a strong coconut base. The pork was of the solid variety, but fell apart easily when poked with a fork. The pumpkin could have been a bit more soft. A 3.5/5 on this.\n\nThe catfish was also breaded and fried, but felt too covered in breadcrumbs for my liking. Good flavor though. The eggplant in the dish was cooked well. A 3.3/5 for this. \n\nOverall, a solid 3.3 for me! It wasn't the taste that was missing as much as the oiliness / fried-ness. I would come back to try less fried dishes!", "author": "Nicole H."}

The Rum thai had very little Malibu or rum and tasted like ice water after the first two sips. The same goes with the Mojito. \n\nThey offered us Shrimp chips(with exactly 4 chips to be shared about 3 people)  which was on the house. We decided to ask for more and the owner ( who was serving us) did bring it to us but, did not mention that we will be charged for it. At the end of our meal we were really bummed that she did not mention it to us upon seeing 7$ for a few shrimp chips on our bill. \n\nThe other entrees we tried were the Crispy chicken and crab fried rice. They are okay and I would definitely give this place a pass and never give it a try even if I am around the block. \n\nThis is just my honest and personal experience.

Now, for the details:\n\nI made a reservation for 10 through Yelp for a friend's birthday. I called to let them know 45 minutes in advance that a few of us were running late because of the pride parade street closures. 5 of us got there at 6, and 5 of us got there at 6:15pm. No one came to greet us or offer to take our order until we walked over ourselves to ask someone to take our order. By this time, it was 6:35pm, and the waitress said we missed happy hour. We told her that no one came to take our order. She spoke with the manager and the manager was very rude and unapologetic and told us that she would only let us have 2 drinks at the happy hour price. Let me remind you that there are 10 of us here to celebrate a birthday. Because we were on a schedule, we couldn't walk out although I really wanted to. \n\nAfter placing our order, the food took forever to come out. We had also brought a cake, and there was a $2 per person cake cutting fee. While waiting for the check (which had to be fixed because she ended up not giving us the 2 drinks on happy hour is course), one of my friends was on a juicing cleanse and had her meal in a Mason jar (she was not drinking it at the restaurant but took it out of her purse and placed on the ground to make sure it didn't spill), but  accidentally kicked it over breaking it. The manager heard the commotion of us trying to gather the glass and ran over. We thought she was concerned about the glass, but she was more concerned that it was a Mason jar. She essentially scolded us saying they do not allow outside beverages. I apologized and told her that it was an accident, and it was clearly full meaning she hadn't been drinking it in the restaurant. The manager just continued giving us dirty looks even though we were genuinely trying to help clean up and felt bad about the mess. \n\nAll in all, the only saving Grace was that the food was pretty good. We were there for more than 2 hours, not by choice but because of the slow service, the bill was over $300, and the customer service was terrible. We tried to make the best of it for our friend's birthday and didn't want to make a big deal, but most of us were very upset about how much we had to pay and how poorly we were treated. I will never come back here again and would not recommend large parties unless you want to be disrespected, embarrassed, and treated horribly.", "author": "Margaret N."}

Who does not like something free to munch on while you wait for food... I love it.\n\nWe ordered the Crab Fried Rice, Pad Ke-mao (wide noodles which at many places is called drunken noodles and is one of the things that I use to judge the level of the Thai food of the restaurant) and Kang Gari Gai (slow cooked half chicken). We ended up making two orders of Pad ke-mao as we did not realize it was with beef as a default and had to order the chicken version also as our friends did not have beef. Out of the three entrees we ordered I liked the Crab Fried rice and Half Chicken the most. The Pad ke-mao was fine but could have been a little more spicy and tastier. But, the half chicken was the dish that I was impressed by the most. Well cooked, tender and juicy with good flavors of the yellow curry. It was a solid dish along with the Crab Fried rice.

When I do go to a Thai place, my go-to is some kind of fried rice, because almost everything else is either spicy or too sweet.\n\nHowever, I have frequented this Thai place quite a few times. I stumbled across it maybe 2.5 years ago, and I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed the crab fried rice I got. I loved the combination of the garlicky flavor with the very generous portions of crab meat that came with the rice. Since then, I have come back to this restaurant 3 more times and ordered the same exact dish. I always enjoy it, though sometimes it is on the blander side and I need to ask for some salt.\n\nI also love the complimentary basket of shrimp chips they give you. During my last dinner there, I went with a group of 5 other people, and for some reason they didn't give us shrimp chips. I saw neighboring tables getting it though, so I had to ask for it, but they're usually pretty good about bringing it out to the table.\n\nOne complaint about this place is that their menu is really hard to read. They have all these options that are closely printed together which makes it hard to read through the block of text. You can see this from the dinner menu PDF on their website: http://www.basilthai.com/dinner_menu.pdf\n\nService also isn't great at this restaurant. Despite the number of servers running around, it can be surprisingly hard to get someone's attention.\n\nPrices are about what you would expect for Thai food in the city, with most plates ranging from $11-16. I ended up paying $20 after tax and tip for my fried rice.\n\nParking in this area is all street parking (and mostly metered).

What I came to realize is that the food was decent, service was fine, and the overall experience was good, but there was nothing special about my meal or my experience there. \n\nThe portion sizes were relatively small as well. For example, when I order chicken satay, usually I get around 4 skewers, but this time there were only two and the shrimp dish that I got was also not as filling as I hoped it would be. They did give us delicious shrimp crackers at the beginning of the meal which were wonderful and tasted great, but the rest of the meal was just average. Probably the most disappointing part of my experience there was that I asked my shrimp to be extra spicy just because I want to see what each Thai place is capable of, and was sorely disappointed when my shrimp was only mildly spicy.\n\nAnyways, this place is decent if you're looking for a taste, but if you want to be filled up with food, this probably isn't the place to go.", "author": "Michael L."}

The meat is super tender and fresh. Must get this if you like to eat like a queen. It tastes great with white rice and my portion was big enough to share, but it's so good u kinda didnt want to. But I did......Everything else I ordered was pretty good but nothing that was like wow!!! The rice and noodles were cooked to perfection. I hate going to an Asian restaurant as an Asian female and eating partially cooked rice or noodles. So you don't have to worry about that here. The food was good. None of the dishes here was a disappointment. Everyone who works here is super nice. So the reason I gave a 4 star, was that we asked for a table in the front with windows, they didn't give it to us even through I also had reservations. I didn't understand it bc that table that they saved it for didn't come until we already paid for our meal. This place is a hole in the wall and the facilities isn't great. There was a smell when you first come into the restaurant. But it's all worth it for that one dish !!", "author": "Ciara N."}

Food was generally good. Using the more generic names, we had the spring rolls appetizer which were full of fresh vegetables and had a good sweet oil served with them. We then had the Jungle Beef (medium spicy is the norm for this dish) and had the chicken pad thai ordered as \"spicy\", and we clarified that as medium spicy as well.\n\nThe jungle beef was excellent. I ordered it partly because of other reviewers, and it certainly delivered. Every part of the flavor and dish was delicious.\n\nThe spicy pad thai was TOO spicy...and I like my spicy foods! It was just barely one notch below the level of my wife being able to eat at all, and even for me it was one or two notches above what I consider enjoyable because, after a few bites, the heat overwhelmed the taste of the dish. Consider yourself warned.\n\nThe restaurant is reasonably close to the Orpheum, maybe a 10 minute walk at most, with a decent amount of street parking available free after 6pm in between the restaurant and the theater. Neighborhoods could be better, but seem safe enough though dirty.", "author": "James W."}

While it may not be the most traditional, the food is spectacular and you really feel like you are eating in an upscale environment. I have been here for dinner twice now and both times, I have always left floating on cloud 9.\n\nBoth times I have come during happy hour which is every day from 5:30-6:30. All appetizers are $6, beer is $4, house cocktails are $6 and glasses of wine are 1/2 off. This is a fantastic deal and one of the best restaurant happy hours I have seen. While the time span is short, it is definitely worth it to try to make it in. The value is incredible. \n\nMy favorite items that I have tried are:\n\n-Roti appetizer: So good and the green curry has a really good bite. This isn't too heavy either and is easily shareable.\n-Pad Kee Mao: My benchmark for Thai food. Basil's is well above average and quite hearty! Definitely delicious\n-Kang Bpet: This duck dish is SO good. The red curry is delicious and the vegetables inside create a good texture. Highly recommended\n-Chocolate Mousse: I never expected dessert at a Thai restaurant to be so good. This dessert is infused with Jasmine so it has a very nice twist on traditional mousse. For $7.50, you feel like you are getting a much fancier dessert.\n\nOn my last meal, the 2 of us each got a drink (HH-priced), split an appetizer (HH-priced), 2 entrees, split a side of rice and split dessert. With tax this came out to $58 which seems steep but considering we had alcohol and 3 courses of high-quality food, this is a great value.\n\nOverall, I cannot wait to go back. I question why I am not there more often and would highly recommend it to anyone in the area for a great meal.", "author": "Carrie W."}

It looked promising, but if good service is important to you you might want to think twice. \n\nWhen I walked in at 11:45 there were only about 2 other parties here. So it was slow--before the lunch rush, which you would think would be a good time to get attentive and fast service. \n\nI asked for and received the cute little table in a nook by the front window, good start. \n\nAfter looking at the menu for a couple minutes, I waited...and waited, for a server to come by. \"Out of sight, out of mind\" apparently. When it appeared no one would come, I stood up, poked my head around the corner and finally got a staff member's attention. Two were deep in conversation so my wave was not recognized by them, another server kept her head down and at last someone acknowledged me and came to get my order. \n\nI ordered the wok fried shrimp and eggplant dish and asked for water. My water came and at the bottom of the glass was a food particle so asked for another when my food came. \n\nFinally, the dish was flavorful with just a hint of spice, but the chili sauce was a bit on the watery side. They were generous with the shrimp which was cooked well, and at the end of the meal, I felt basically satisfied. \n\nHowever the experience was spoiled by the bad service and it's unlikely I will return.", "author": "Alicia A."}

I don't know if the waitress could handle a big party of 15, but she was SO RUDE. All of my family members were being respectful to her, not once were we rude. Being a server myself, I understand that big parties are hard to serve, but you do it with a smile and respect. If you cannot do that, then DO NOT be a server. I asked our waitress for some napkins because mine was gone, and I did not know if I may have dropped it on the floor while getting up to the restroom. She says, \"your napkin is on the floor.\" So do you want me to pick it off the floor and use it to wipe my mouth? That was the first strike. The second strike was when I had given her my credit card in advance to pay, and she says, \"all of it?\" I don't know, I think I only want to pay for $10 of the bill. Obviously all of it. You think that because I have just graduated from college that I cannot afford the meal? It was honestly so disrespectful and it ruined my appetite. After paying, I asked one of the servers for the manager, and she points to the rude waitress that was serving me. I'm sorry, but if this is the type of person that is managing the restaurant, it will not go far. Yes, the food is good and it is located in a good area, but I am beyond disappointed in the service that I have received. This has happened on Friday, May 25th, and I am still livid.

At $11 it was very mediocre. The cauliflower was on the al dente side and the sauce was very bland. Definitely not worth it and I usually adore cauliflower. I had asked the waiter for assistance in choosing between three vegetable dishes - not sure why he suggested this one. I also had the pineapple fried rice. I could see scallions, cilantro, cashews, cherry tomatoes and half rings of canned pineapple. This was the most tasteless version of this dish I've ever had.

In fact, my first review nine years ago attests to that enthusiasm. Unfortunately my most recent visit reflected a gradual decline that I've been noticing with what was once very attentive and helpful service. The food has also lost a bit of its luster in the intervening years, and to top it all off, I am disheartened to find their health inspection score drop to 54, which ranks it as one of the lowest graded restaurants in the city while it rates an impressive average of four stars on Yelp. I wonder how many of those diners paid attention to the score.\n\nJamie W. and I sure didn't when we came here last month. Even though we came late in the evening, I couldn't help but notice that the complimentary shrimp chips were nowhere to be found on our table. I always thought of those chips as mandatory for all guests but I guess not. It wasn't until I brought it up after we ordered that they handed us a small bamboo basket with just a few in it (photo: http://bit.ly/1QQqNIa). Since it was late, we ordered a dish each to share. Jamie went for the $12.50 Pad-Se-Ew because he loves the flat wide noodles that are pan-fried with pork, Chinese broccoli, peppers, tomato, and black bean sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1PfkNHT). It didn't disappoint taste-wise as that's one of their signature dishes.\n\nI went for the $13.95 Grilled Eggplant stuffed with minced chicken and cabbage and then ladled in a basil green curry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1ipRg3p). It was my first time trying this dish, and i have to say it was rather lackluster with not enough heat to provide some kick for sport. Even though they were closing in a few minutes, we noticed how the staff has become less attentive over the years, and it took a while to get the bill. I think Basil Thai is capable of better than this particular dining experience, but I think they need a wake-up call on how some of their more long-standing customers are feeling about the place. Once I saw the '54' though, I can tell you I'm probably not returning until that score moves up dramatically.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...feeling some slippage here but the big shocker is the '54' health inspection score\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...still feels the same as it originally did...spacious and a bit dark\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...here the slippage is more pronounced\nTOTAL - 3 stars...sad to downgrade a neighborhood favorite but sometimes you just have to throw a Thai iced tea in someone's face to make them wake up and smell the basil", "author": "Ed U."}

Chicken and mushrooms in lemongrass, galanga, and coconut milk soup (dtom ka gai) - Very delicious soup, however small portion even for the large size. The large size will serve at most 4 people. \n\nEntrees:\n1. Pad - Kee Mao  & Pad - Sew Ew : Very simple and traditional noodle dish, nothing too special, but WOW is the portion huge!!!! \n\n2. Coconut braised pork shoulder and 'kabocha' pumpkin in tangy red curry * (kang kua mu) - Delicious curry! Very light in flavor and definitely a must have if you are a fan of pumpkin and pork. Entree does not come with a side of rice, which is $2.50 per order.\n\nI would come back here again, however the only thing I would suggest is trying the specialty dishes instead of the dishes where you can get at other regular thai restaurants.", "author": "Lydia L."}

They're all pretty good, but honestly they're all more or less the same to me. Basil Thai is no different. The food is good but not really distinguishable from other similar restaurants like Lers Ros or Farmhouse Kitchen Thai. Since the place is \"fancy\" Thai rather than authentic, it's on the pricier side for Thai food, especially given the portion sizes.\n\nAmbiance is also similar to other nice Thai spots. Dark/dim lighting like you'd find in a nice restaurant so it'd work for a casual date or a nice dinner with friends that's not too expensive. Service is okay. A little hard to get the wait staff's attention and they're not overly welcoming or friendly, but that seems pretty standard for this type of restaurant.\n\nAgain, food was pretty good for the most part. Nothing that would make me dying to come back, but I still liked it. If you want your food spicy (like Thai spicy), don't be afraid to ask them to crank it up. They probably won't take you seriously when you ask for \"very very very spicy\" or \"Thai spicy\", but if you ask them to redo it, they'll do it right.\n\n-GRILLED SQUID / PLAMUK PING ($8.95) - 2/5\n[chili, lime, garlic sauce]\nSkip this. I really like squid, but this was way too chewy. And the portion size was ridiculously small.

We ended up asking them to make it actually spicy, and it definitely came back REAL spicy. The steak was very tender and the portion size was pretty large (even the portion of meat), but the salad was a little too salty.\n\n-ROASTED DUCK CURRY ($14.95) - 4/5\n[snap peas, red curry paste, young peppercorn]\nPortion size was pretty small (smaller than the steak salad). The curry was pretty flavorful but the flavor didn't stand out against other curries I've had. The duck was very tender though.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Actually its more like your typical Thai basil dishes, and a bit oily.\n\nCrispy Chicken - A little too battered for my taste.  The red curry sauce was good, but the chunks of chicken could have been bigger, or better yet, this would have been a good fried fish dish.

Honestly, all my prior impressions of Thai food being not refined enough went out the door.  We had a friend's birthday dinner here and ordered several dishes that we ate family-style, which was a good way to get to know this restaurant. \n\nFirst, we started off with some amazing cocktails.  I had the Ginger Drop cocktail and it was the perfect spring-ey cocktail.  So refreshing, light, and delicious.  \n\nFor appetizers, we shared the Indian-style paratha with green dipping sauce and the turnip cakes.  Honestly, I could pass on the paratha, but the turnip cakes were a real revelation.  What a great way to elevate the lowly turnip!  Crisp, succulent, and an incredible marriage of flavors.\n\nNext, we split several entrees, including the grilled eggplant stuffed with chicken in a green curry; stir fried garlic noodles with prawns, mussels and squid; and tamarind prawns.  I honestly cannot say that one dish was better than another.  However, if I had to pick, it would be the eggplant stuffed with chicken in green curry because of the dish's uniqueness.  \n\nOverall, this restaurant is a great value for the high level of food it serves.  I highly recommend it.  Service could be better, but honestly, the food was so incredible that I can't even complain about it.", "author": "Anna S."}

I got the Chicken Satay skewers and they were yum. \n\nMy wife got a pumpkin curry dish and it was a bit too spicy for our taste but ah well. The pumpkin part is not what we thought.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-15", "description": "This was my favorite restaurant along SOMA.\n\nLooking back it had been about 5 years since my last review. And in that time I've probably visited Basil Thai more than 2 dozen times, easily.\n\nI'd noticed in my last few non-local trips that the service would sometimes have an off day. Things wouldn't get refilled, remembered, etc. This last trip was a toss up between Triptych and Basil. And sadly, I chose Basil.\n\nWe started off on a bad foot, with us waiting about ten minutes to have our order taken after being seated. This escalated to all out annoyance after a large party came in and they attempted to seat them horizontally to us, thereby having whomever sat at the head of the table be a mere two inches from the only side of our table left free and creating a dangerous crowding situation on the other side of the aisle.\n\nFrankly I had no idea how they were even going to go about serving us until the party quickly saw the issue and moved to a \"better\" table, after which they broke down the tables and it was no longer an issue.\n\nSince I've been to Basil so many times I'm fairly aware of how much time it takes to serve. I've been here during Pride and other high volume street faires - so when I say it took the main meals (two dishes, one of which was soup) three times as long as it generally takes on a slightly busy day understand that by this time I was regretting I'd chosen Basil Thai.\n\nAfter sitting through the aforementioned musical chairs and waiting patiently through a birthday celebration with a cake and candles brought out by a couple waiters, we finally received our food. Which was delicious. Basil was my favorite for a reason.\n\nIt should be noted that prior to stopping at Basil, since I was in SF and it was after 5pm I stopped at the local cupcake shop (which is my absolute favorite local cupcakery) and picked up a couple 2 for 1 tasties. See my review, they're awesome!\n\nWhen we decided to eat at Basil, I brought the box in with me in full view of the waitress. After requesting another plate of shrimp chips and waiting almost 20 minutes for them, to cut the taste of the rich broth I pulled one out and ate one. Not thinking much of it as I'd brought soda, and other drinks into Basil at least a handful of times before and never had an issue.\n\nAbout ten minutes later as we were waiting (again) to be noticed to get our check, a waitress (though not ours) bent down and whispered in my ear. \"Just so you know, we don't usually allow outside food.\" \"I'm so sorry!\" I said and she quickly said \"Ya.\" and walked away.\n\nI looked at the honey and pointed at the table behind us, \"but Basil doesn't serve cake...\" I said. He shrugged. We finally flagged down someone for the check and pulled out our Discover cards. After waiting another few minutes to be acknowledged we asked the waitress who came up if they took Discover (many places don't). \"No.\" she said and walked away.\n\nAt this point, we were done. With that final nail, my run as a Basil Thai customer was over. I won't be back. While Basil has been going downhill, the actions and tone of the servers and waitresses this last visit lost have finally lost a repeat customer.\n\nCupcakegate.

When we went to tell our original server, she looked confused and didn't offer much help whatsoever. There wasn't an apology or, really, even an acknowledgement of the mistake.\n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was clear that it wasn't made very well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-13", "description": "It's worth noting that I'm not a huge fan of Thai food in general, so depending on how you look at it that could make my opinion not as informative because I don't know what I'm supposed to expect out of Thai food or even more honest in the sense that it's purely whether I like it or not.. Anyway, pleased with this place! Went to an art show in the city one night, and decided to look up somewhere nearby to eat when hunger came around. Chose here out of convenience, mostly. \n\nThe service was not bad at all, but nothing extraordinary. Our server did exactly what you would expect your server to do on the job - took our order, checked on us every once in a while, offered to-go boxes, gave us our check. Nothing extra that stood out, but not unpleasant at all. Honestly, I don't think our server ever even told us her name. \n\nBetween my boyfriend & I we ordered crab fried rice (not pictured), grilled angus sirloin, & Japanese scallops, and I had a lychee Thai iced tea. My beverage was refreshing; still tastes like you would expect a Thai tea to taste, with just a hint of lychee. There is lychee pulp in it, which I don't mind, but jsyk. The crab fried rice was delicious, and you can order it with a fried egg as well! Not too fishy of a taste. The sirloin probably surprised me the most in that it didn't taste how it looks. Definitely on the tangy side, but good. Cooked well also; not too chewy, but not dry at all. The Japanese scallops were our favorite order of the night. The chili black bean sauce was a great sweetness with the smallest kick (there's some flexibility with how spicy you want it made when you order it). It paired especially well with the fried rice. Overall, left the restaurant super satisfied with our meal! Nothing to complain about there. Would definitely consider coming back next time I'm in the city.", "author": "Jasmine V."}

The restaurant was adorable, the service was great and the food was completely on point! Plus, you don't have to spend a bomb to have a great time, what's not to like?\n\nTo start of, the drinks were really, really good. My friend had the Ginger Drop cocktail which was AMAZING, it was a very light cocktail with a nice dash of fresh ginger that had a great kick. Definitely one of the best cocktail's I've had. I had the lychee saketini which was also very good.\n\n1. Fish cakes - The fishcakes were good. I really, really enjoyed them. I know you can get them at most places, but I think Basil Thai serves one of the yummiest.\n2. Tom yum goong - I enjoyed this soup - I tend to find that most places in SF make tom yum a little too sweet, this was nice and savory but I would have loved if it were a little spicier\n3. Brussels sprouts with garlic and chilli and pork belly - Mmm, this was as good as it sounds.\n3. Garlic noodles - I wasn't particularly impressed, they felt a little soggy but my friends loved it. Maybe I just am not a fan of garlic noodles.\n\nAll in all, we ordered quite a few dishes and dined family style. I enjoyed all of the dishes - this is definitely one of the best Thai restaurants I have been to in the bay. And I am looking forward to going back again. Unfortunately, as delicious as the dishes were, a lot of them were quite forgettable. I would definitely recommend Basil Thai for a good, casual dining experience.

I'm actually more of a fan because I think the restaurant is managed well. That's become a much larger component of my reviews lately, because I would rather have good food in a well-run establishment than great food in a hellhole. There isn't a single place in San Francisco that I think is worth waiting for more than 1 hour or tolerating poor customer service.\n\nThat being said, I really liked how they handled a problem with the chicken satay, which we thought was a little undercooked. Without arguing, they replaced the dish immediately, but the manager took the time to come over and explain that they do use dark meat, which can sometimes look raw. He wasn't making excuses or laying blame, he just explained that it's a common misperception. I ate some of that skewer, and I'm alive to write this review, so maybe he was right. Anyway, we got an extra skewer, and they had a happy group of customers. Win-win!\n\nPROS\n- Good variety of dishes\n- Great service, even when extremely busy during a lunch rush\n- Reasonable prices, good portions\n\nCONS\n- I feel like some of the dishes are \"Americanized\" to make them more palatable to a wider audience. Can't really fault them for this, but just bear that in mind.\n- Parking can be difficult, especially since there's frequent construction on Folsom and it's close to a couple of freeways entrances.\n\nTIP\nIf you happen to be down at the Hall of Justice for jury duty, this is a great option because it's only a few blocks away and takes reservations.", "author": "Drew P."}

Here is what went down:\n\nFirst of all, their menu is slightly overwhelming. It's literally just a huge block of text per page, the bolded words are in Thai, and I think it's pretty much the poster-menu of how not to ever design your menus. But that is no big deal.\n\nOne of my friends is recovering from food poisoning, so we were planning on just ordering two entrees, an appetizer, and some rice for my poor friend who cannot stomach anything at the moment. BUT THEN, upon further examination of this long block of text, we see fine print at the bottom: \"For our dinner hours, because of limited seating, each person must order at least $15 worth of food\" (or something of that nature). I was super taken aback - maybe I'm not used to city life, but I've never really seen something like that, especially in fine print?! Especially at a restaurant that isn't even fancy or super nice (maybe then, I would understand)?! And, looking around, there were a handful of empty tables around us at a peak dinner hour!\n\nWe called over the waitress, explained the situation, and asked if it would be alright for my friend to just order some rice to eat. The waitress paused for a long while then addressed my sick friend with, \"You can order drinks.\"\n\nAnyway, after a little bit of negotiation, the situation was all taken care of, and my friend didn't have to order anything besides rice. It was just such an awkward situation. Further, the $15 limit is super weird because most of the entrees are under $15, meaning each person needs to order an entree AND an appetizer each. Maybe that is normal for people. Maybe I am just not rolling in dough. I don't know. Like I said, though, this restaurant is nicely decorated, but would not be considered \"fancy\" or \"upscale\".\n\nThe food? I enjoyed the curry puffs (diced duck and sweet potatoes) a lot! They were flavorful and delicous. However, both of the entrees my friend and I ended up ordering (the crab fried rice and the pad se-ew) were super bland. Literally tasted like nothing.\n\nAll in all, not quite understanding the reviews of this place. Maybe I came on a bad day?", "author": "Ingrid A."}

I trusted Yelpers on this one, but I have to admit it was kind of a let-down. \n\nMy friends and I ordered food for delivery. Not only did it take longer than estimated, but the suggested tip (13%) on top of the delivery fee seemed a bit high - and it was not adjustable (at least, not that we could figure out). \n\nThe food was OK, but not at all what I'd expect for a four-star place. The basil eggplant was the best dish we had, and actually finished that one. We also ordered two versions of the pad thai, and they were mediocre at best - very disappointing. Not a lot of flavor, mostly bland noodles that seemed more like angel hair spaghetti than anything thai. I would suggest adding more flavor, more veggies, and more limes at least (if the pad thai is going to be bland, at least give me more than one lime slice to make up for it!). I ordered a spicy seafood soup which was an ok value for the money and was pretty tasty but nothing spectacular. We also tried the sides of brown rice (which you have to order separately).

But ever since I actually visited Thailand some years ago I stopped eating the domestic stuff since to me it just doesn't taste as good.

Dtom Ka Gai - chicken and oyster mushroom in lemongrass, galanga and coconut milk, soup: the chicken was tender, the oyster mushroom was tasty, but the soup was overwhelmed by the lemon, and I mean they must have used lemon juice because I could not taste the lemongrass. On top of that, it was not creamy at all.\n\n2. Kao Pad Sapparot - Thai pineapple fried rice with shrimp and cashew: yes there were about four full size shrimp, plenty of pineapple and some stale cashews, but it tasted like something from Pan** Express.\n\n3. Kana Mu Grob - Chinese broccoli, bell pepper and crispy pork belly wok fried in a chili-garlic sauce: they actually used a few chili peppers to give it more of a kick. Tasty, but, it's more like something from a Chinese restaurant.\n\n4. Pak Rad Kang - grilled squash, eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, tomatoes and chili peppers in a green curry sauce: even though this dish specified chili peppers, it was not even close to being as spicy as the previous dish. That said, this was probably the best and most authentic dish all night. The veggies were not over cooked and the curry did not overpower the taste buds.\n\nService was excellent. We were greeted promptly, the server came quickly and was not upset when we were not ready to order. They refilled our water glasses without asking and kept them topped off. They cleaned the table of empty plates and bowls promptly so our food was not cramped together on a smallish table. And finally, they were not overly pushy on dessert.\n\nAmbiance was very contemporary, although during our visit, Thursday night around 7:30PM, the lights were dimmed too much, to a point we could hardly read the menu, and the noise level made everyone shout to their dining companion.

The only thing I didn't like about it was the oyster mushrooms in it. Otherwise, it was really good. The pad thai was different from what pad thai is normally like. It was wasn't as sweet. I probably wouldn't order this again. The pad se-ew was really good with big pieces of meat and chinese broccoli. The Pak Rad Kang was also yummy, but I didn't like the strange squash it came with.

It literally took 25 minutes from the first person to get their food to the last. It's always super awkward when some people get their food and the feel like they have to wait... everyone is hungry so the smell of the food makes you more hungry for those who have to wait and then the person with the food has their food getting cold. I ended up being one of the last people to get my food. I finally got my pad kee mao with beef and all seemed well. At this point they would have gotten a 3 star from me because no one addressed the wait time issue even though several people came to check on it. What made it into a 1 star is how I feel right now- totally nauseous. My coworker mentioned your beef did look kinda  undercooked but he didn't feel comfortable telling me at the table.

We were ready for some sustenance and pysched that we could quickly get a table for the 5 of us at Basil Thai.\n\nWe decided to continue drinking and I chose a coconut cocktail which was pretty good but not quite as delicious as I'd expected. Others seemed to feel about the same about their cocktails (all around $9). We were VERY enthusiastic about the shrimp chip \"bread basket\" though and asked for more near the end of our meal (and our wish was granted!).\n\nFor food, I've tried several different dishes. I love tom yum soup and it's very good here (though I wish it were served as an even bigger pot!). We also ordered curries which were good especially with the brown/wild rice. One of my friends had the pad thai which also looked amazing though I didn't try it. \n\nI wish I didn't have to ask for chop sticks but I always do here (they are not provided on the tables) and it always takes a while to get this request granted. Then I just have to decide whether to dig into the delicious food with a fork or wait for my chop sticks! Bottomless shrimp chips would be great too!", "author": "Meghan P."}

Paired with a side of House Hunters International, this is what my dream weekday night in looks like.\n\nI placed an order for the soup, a red curry and a side of sticky rice via the Postmates app (check 'em out, by the way - they're crazy fast and professional!) and soon enough, I received a perfectly-packaged bundle of steaming hot Thai goodies. \n\nI set up shop in my living room and tried the curry first - a backward approach, but I have a difficult time delaying gratification and I predicted the red curry would end up headlining the show. And it did: with its tender chunks of coconut-braised pork shoulder, kabocha pumpkin and a rich red curry, this dish delivered the flavor profile I was seeking. Unfortunately, the curry lacked any real heat but admittedly, I think it takes a lot to take my taste buds for a spin.\n\nI found the soup pretty underwhelming, unfortunately. I expected it to be creamier, with a more pronounced coconut base. What I got was a thin rendition of what is usually my favorite soup - I'll skip this one next time.\n\nBasil Thai's definitely a solid option not too far from home, but for now I'm still looking for my HG Thai spot.", "author": "Jelena Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-09", "description": "I'd give them 3.5 stars if it was possible. At the recommendation of a friend, I ordered take out last night for dinner.  I called ahead and my meal was ready to go when I got there, for the most part. I do give them kudos for waiting until I arrived to box up the coconut ice cream that went along with my dessert (more on that later). My biggest complaint- I got back to my hotel room, put on my PJs and settled in for some good eats, only to discover that there were no utensils and no napkins provided.  I'm sure this was just an oversight but come on!  Definitely knocked my rating down a star.  I basically ate everything with my hands because I was not changing back into my clothes to run to the restaurant next door in pouring rain to ask for some. \n\nStarted with the spring rolls- I'll be honest and say I was expecting crispy vegetable rolls, but ended up with the fresh, raw ones.  Disappointed, yes, but it's possible I made a mistake when ordering.  Nevertheless, they were pretty decent, coming from someone who is not normally a fan of these. Tofu, noodles, carrots, lettuce and a pretty tasty dipping sauce.  \n\nAlso tried a small size of their Tom Ka soup.  THIS was one of the highlights of my dinner. A good portion of chicken and mushrooms in a delicious coconut/broth/whatever it is that almost made me almost forget I was slurping from the takeout container and digging out the chicken with my fingers.  Get this- you won't be disappointed.  \n \nMy entree (hey, I was hungry and on expense, don't judge) was the pad see ew, with beef instead of pork.  This was good.  Not great but good.  I've had it elsewhere where it tastes burned or scorched but this was cooked to perfection.  The sauce, IMO, needed a little bit more...something.  Sweetness maybe? There was something very slightly missing in the flavor that kept me from devouring it like I usually would at my hometown Thai restaurant.  Still a solid piece and don't let my pickiness deter you from trying this. \n\nAnd finally, dessert!  I ordered mango sticky rice (my fav) but was called back after hanging up to be told they were out of it.  Huge bummer. So I ordered the fried bananas and coconut ice cream instead. The bananas are not cooked as you might expect (as mini spring rolls drizzled with honey or some sauce) , rather, it was like chunks of banana that were breaded and deep fried- almost like I got 6 banana nuggets with a LOT of breading.  No sauces, but the coconut ice cream was amaze-balls.  I ate half of it on the uber ride back to my hotel.  Hey, I was worried it would melt before getting to enjoy it! \n\nOverall-  decent meal, definitely didn't knock my socks off but would definitely consider eating at the restaurant next time if I'm ever in SF with an urge for Thai to prevent any ordering errors!", "author": "Lola W."}

We parked a block down the street on this cold evening (so glad I brought my leather jacket). The front looked classy and elegant with dark grey and the windows was lit dark orange and red. Already setting the relaxation mood before I even walk through the doors (so far, so good).\n\nOnce through the door, we were greeted by a young lady. \"Two,\" we said and she seated us right away. The indoor was pretty modern; light walls, lamp fixtures, table spread and corner trims did not remind me of Thailand. I guess if it wasn't for the restaurant name, I would expect the place to serve sandwiches and steak (I like the chair though).\n\nI can tell my co-worker was in an unfamiliar territory so I decided to take point on this. I mention that this may be served as family style restaurant and told him to order a dish and I will order one and we'll share it.

I had my doubts at first cause all my favorite Thai places look more like delapitated hole in the walls. But this place pleasantly surprised me! They have a limited menu with less items then I'm typicall use to seeing at Thai places but they have the typical favorites - pad thai, pad see ew, curries and soups/salads. They bring out a little dish of shrimp chips once you order which was nice and appreciated. I don't think they make it in house though, it was similar to the store bought ones. We ordered:\n\nPad Thai - I got the spicy version and it was good! Spicy and flavorful. Good amounts of fresh shrimp and tofu. The sauce covered everything to perfection and it was really delicious. The noodles were really al dente though so if that bothers you ask them to cook your noodles more well done. I didn't have a problem since I like more of a chew to my noodles.\n\nPad See Mao - Beef dish similar to pad see ew. More sweet than the pad thai with a slight spice. Loved the basil flavoring on this dish and it was a nice compliment to the spicer more intense pad thai. The noodles on this dish was very well done.\n\nService is attentive and portions are pretty generous. I took half my pad thai home for lunch the next day. Overall a good go to thai place if I'm ever in the area.\n\n\nEDIT: I just heated up my leftoever and found a toothpick in the dish - which I DID NOT USE and had no where near the table.

If it's considered a \"busy\" night, I'd recommend bringing a small party (less than 6) because 1) your party better be hungry because on busy days there's a minimum of $15 per person, and 2) 18% gratuity on top of it.  Who charges a $15 minimum, seriously?  With my party of 9, half of the girls ordered appetizers.  Be ready to order at least one dish and an appetizer PER person.  I'm saying this because the most expensive dish is around 13.50, and the cheapest is around 7?  So plan to order dessert, drinks, appetizers along with it.  We didn't look forward to all the extra dishes that came out.  And couldn't reach the minimum so spent it on cake-cutting ($1.50 per person, FYI, in case you want to celebrate a birthday there, too)\n\n2.9 stars for food.  Pad Kee Mao wasn't good, Pad Thai way too sweet, Tamarind Prawns (supposedly a house recommendation) sweeter than the Pad Thai.  And get this, I have a sweet tooth!  Of the 8 or so dishes, I think the turnip cakes were the best.  I'd come back for that.  But not on a busy day.  Cute, clean presentation of the dishes though.\n\nAll in all, my party would have had a better time given notice about their busy day policies.  I rated it 3 stars because they didn't charge us $15 for one of the members of the group who came during the last half hour of the meal.  I really wanted to give it 2 stars because I do feel it deserves a \"Men, I've experienced better,\" but I'm kind of feeling indifferent today.", "author": "Janet T."}

Both are delicious. \n\nStuffed Eggplant Green Curry - not too spicy, just right. I would recommend you to order extra spicy if you like spicy. The chicken is soft consider most chicken curry in other Thai restaurant are pretty dry. I wish there are a bit more eggplants as they are sliced pretty thin. \n\nPad Ke-Mao - it is not too salty and they put in good amount of meat in it. Nothing special but surely tasty.\n\nThe only reason I gave 3 stars is because they listed their pricing wrong. \n\nStuffed Eggplant Green Curry listed $11, but they actually charged me for $12.95.\n\nPad Ke-Mao listed $10, but they actually charged me for $11.", "author": "Hunter S."}

There was dim lighting, bar, and candles lit on each table. A very cute place to take a date! \n\nWe ordered the chicken yellow curry and lightly fried prawns with peppers and onions. Prawns were delicious!!! One thing you should note is the yellow curry is served very different than other places I have usually gotten it from: sliced chicken, carrots, onions, potatoes and LOTS of curry sauce. This was served with 1/2 chicken (bone-in), potatoes, and a little curry sauce. It was hard to complain about it though because it tasted sooo good! The chicken came right off the bone and the potatoes were weirdly amazing. Just a note for those of you who like drenching your rice with curry sauce (like me) -- there probably isn't enough for that. \n\nTheir rice portions are also super small for $2.50 (brown rice) each. But you do get some delicious shrimp chips for the beginning of the meal!\n\nSo if you're willing to spend a little extra money I think it's definitely worth it!

First visit was decent (about 3.5 stars worth! had ordered the spicy beef salad & a curry). \n\nOn the second visit, the \"fiery lamb\" was neither fiery nor lamb. It was beef (or poor quality flavorless lamb) cooked in an overly sweet brown syrup (& no spicy kick whatsoever).  The waitress insisted it was lamb & didn't offer any explanation of why it didn't have any of the flavor or texture characteristic of lamb meat.\n\nThe coconut chicken lemongrass soup's broth was good, but they added the already-cooked chicken in at the last minute instead of cooking it IN the broth (the chicken was dry & flavorless...it had neither absorbed the flavors of the broth nor retained its natural juiciness). \n\nMost dishes were overwhelmingly sweet; the other flavors were lost in the syrups they cooked the meats in :/", "author": "Sandy J."}

Not quite four stars, but a solid 3.5, due to them having a very long list of okay dishes, with just a few worthy standouts.\n\nThe one dish I'd really suggest getting here is their pork shoulder and pumpkin curry, which is probably my favorite dish on their menu (when they execute correctly, as I've been disappointed once). Some other notable dishes included their duck curry, tom ka gai, and pad kee mao, although the latter was a bit too sweet for me. Their curry puffs are also pretty tasty. Personally, I'd stay away from all their \"from the wok\" dishes, as these have tended to be fairly lackluster whenever a dinner partner ventured to try one.\n\nService is not bad and waits are usually not terrible, but some people may find that their portions are a bit small. My smaller appetite doesn't mind, because it's enough that I'll still have some extra to take home, but, larger appetites, be warned. And for those who are inclined to drink, the cocktails here aren't too shabby (but, Bloodhound is right down the street, and is SO much better).\n\nFor those in wheelchairs, yes, the front entrance is up several steps.

We were nonetheless seated promptly. \n\nWe ordered pineapple fried rice, fried tofu skewers, pad Thai and pad see ew to share. The plates the dishes arrived on were huge!

However, I expected a tad more food for the price we paid. Granted we were in SOMA and basil Thai is practically the only Thai restaurant in like a 5 block radius. I still expected a bit better. For our dishes we paid about $45 not including tip. \n\nTwo hours later... We were hungry again.\n\nSo if you're here for the atmosphere it's definitely worth it. The service here is great!

However, Basil Thai exceeded my expectations and pleasantly surprised me! I can't give it a full 5 stars because I had some complaints, but overall, it was a delightful meal. The cocktail menu is superb - I definitely recommend trying some of those. I got 2 of the \"Ginger Drops\" because I'm a vodka gal and that was super tasty and refreshing. Of course, my meal wasn't complete without getting a Singha beer either. For food, we got:\n\nGreen curry/roti: This was one of my favorite things ever in Thailand. Of course, this can't be replicated here, but it was still pretty damn good. Note: if you're vegetarian, make sure to tell them that. Fish sauce is used for the green curry, so they can substitute it with yellow sauce, which is entirely vegetarian. Both are really yummy. We had 6 of us at dinner (and some people were vegetarian), so we got one order of the green and one of the yellow. It was more than enough.\n\nVegetable spring rolls: I think 8 pieces come in an order, which is perfect to share. Crispy and delicious, you can't go wrong.\n\nLarb Gai: I absolutely love this salad. It's hard to find that in the states, as this is a really common and popular dish in Thailand, but I was stoked to see it on the menu. It's minced chicken mixed with mint, lemon, leaves, etc. It's super healthy and has a ton of flavor in it -- the mint makes it excellent, in my opinion. I would for sure get this -- also, the portion is huge.\n\nVegetarian pad thai: Probably my least favorite thing. just tasted oily and unauthentic. I would skip out on this, it doesn't taste anything special.\n\nChicken pad see ew: Awesome. Way better than the veggie pad thai. \n\nPanang curry with chicken: Good, but a little heavy on the curry for my taste. \n\nTofu curry with yellow sauce: Again, they need to use yellow sauces for veggie dishes. This was good, but not great. The tofu chunks were huge.\n\nI would have cut one noodle and one curry dish out, as the portions were humongous, but I was still very happy with the meal.

I made a reservation in advance because I had read the reviews about it being crowded. The hostess  was super friendly and told us to wait about 5 minutes, but the table we were waiting for took their sweet time, so it took a little longer.\n\nThe portions were decent enough for 3 of us to share; then again we did order 3 dishes. I'm not usually into food cooked with pineapple since I like them separately, but the Thai pineapple fried rice was delicious! It had the perfect consistency and flavor. The Seafood Bamee was good, but I didn't expect it to be so spicy. I did enjoy the seafood in it though. The pad see ew wasn't anything really different than other Thai restaurants, so I would order it somewhere else for cheaper. \n\nSide note: It was dinner AND a show that night. I had just momentarily looked up and outside the restaurant windows onto Folsom St. There was a chick CHANGING in her apartment without any blinds/shades.

It's absolutely worth goin g out of your way for, and worth braving the long lines.  First time I went, I had the Pad See-Ew, which was delish, and sampled pork shoulder and various curries from around the table.  Nothing wasn't outstanding.  Try the fried Indian bread to start.  Cocktails, too, were fantastic.  The Rum Thai (pineapple and coconut milk) is a tropical delight, and even though I'm not crazy about ginger, I loved the sip of Ginger Drop I tried. \n\nOn my subsequent visit, I had the crab fried rice, which was also really good (although I think I prefer the Pad See-Ew).  I'm excited to try so many thing on their menu, and this is fast becoming one of my favorite places to eat.\n\nSo why did I leave off a star?  While the food itself is fairly reasonably priced, there are no free refills on sodas, which the server failed to mention both times I've dined there.  This can account for a little surprise on your check.  Second, cocktails are $9.  Reasonable food prices are counterbalanced by some craziness in the drink department.\n\nStill, though, I highly recommend this place if you're after great Thai food!", "author": "Erin W."}

Everybody in my party has a relatively small appetite and some of us weren't too hungry to begin with so we just wanted to order 4-5 plates of food to split before a night out in the city. However, our waitress very rudely told us that we HAD to spend at least $15/person (This is a rule they have, and we didn't know about it before we sat down). Of course, $15 is not much for a nice dinner out but we all were very irritated by 1) the service and our waitress who was extremely rude 2) this very unnecessary rule of having to spend $15 per person when all we wanted was to quickly finish dinner and head out 3) the 18% gratuity on TOP of the $15/person. \n\nAnyhow, there was no way around it so we ended up ordering ~4 more plates of food which were mostly left uneaten and 5 drinks that we didn't really want to begin with but got them anyway to minimize food wastage. \n\nAll 7 of us were really irritated by this experience and this definitely took away from our food experience.

I'm happy to review a place well, but if a place doesn't please or excite me, I consider it my own issue and keep my mouth shut. But this is the 5th time I've been to Basil, and every single time I've had a mediocre to terrible experience here. The only reason I've eaten here so many times is because it's near my job, and in this part of town there are very few restaurant choices. But after today, I can honestly say that I'd rather starve than venture into Basil again.\n\nFirst off, for a restaurant of its size, Basil should have more than two servers. But at the busy lunch hour, when the place is packed, there are never any more than two to be found. Actually, scratch that. There is really only one server, because the two servers on the floor each do only half the job of a complete server.\n\nOn one occasion I walked into the restaurant with a coworker, was approached by one of the servers to be seated and as I was speaking to her she turned around and walked away from me. She wasn't showing us to a table. No, she was just done with us for a while. Today, this same server completely skipped over me when it came to drink orders. She stood right behind me and took everyone else's order and then rushed off without giving me even an opportunity to say, \"hey what about me!\" Nope, she was outta there. Maybe you're thinking she just wanted to get our drink orders up. But I doubt it. She didn't come back with the drinks for 10 minutes.\n\nThe other server seems utterly oblivious to the needs of a diner. He never supplied us with enough silverware or napkins, and when a dish was brought to us to eat family style, it had chopsticks in it--there wasn't a serving spoon or fork to be found. Love chopsticks or hate them, you absolutely can't serve food with them. But he, too, was outta there faster than lightening, so I had to get up myself and take silverware from an empty table across the room.\n\nFood-wise, Basil is OK, but I have had much better in this city elsewhere. Sometimes the steak is tough and hard to cut. Sometimes the satay is made with cheap, dark chicken meat, like it was today. Sometimes there's more rice than main course on my plate. Rarely is the entire meal a delight. In fact, it's never been a delight. It's always seemed just a little half-assed.\n\nTrust me, I hate giving bad reviews. Hate it. But Basil has disappointed me for the last time.", "author": "Derek S."}

You can get a table without a reservation but it's nicely populated. \n\nThe menu is fusion & the food is inventive, at a good price point with very generous portions. \n\nFavorites are the fire calamari, any of their shrimp dishes and the beef dishes usually are excellent (although today the angus cubes in green curry were tough).\n\nAfter many good lunches and dinners here, I'll forgive 'em for that one blip!\n\nFull bar, great selection of sakis & probably the best Thai iced tea I've ever tasted.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

Also, the service is friendly and attentive and the decor is nice (modern but casual).  \n \nOn my most recent visit, we started off with the Som Tum (green papaya salad with peanuts, lime, garlic and tomatoes).  Tasty but a bit too spicy for me.  I love the spicy (hello I'm Korean, it's genetic) but here I thought it overpowered the salad. \n \nI ordered one of my staples, Pad Seew (rice noodles, meat or tofu, egg, Chinese broccoli) and it was good as per usual.  A LOT of garlic in this dish (which I love) but a little greasy this time.  I also tried the Basil's Eggplant (Asian eggplant, tofu, mushrooms, scallions) which I also liked.  My friend ordered it spicy and they definitely hooked it up. \n \nFor dessert, we had the Sweet Sticky Rice with Fresh Mango and it was perfect.  The mango was the right amount of ripeness and the sweet rice had little toasted grains of rice sprinkled on top and a sprig of mint on the side.

Was so going to order the pineapple fried rice but some dude Kevin L's review said that Stuffed Eggplant was the \"Best dish\".  Best dish you say?  I like me some eggplant, and I like me some stuffed.  Let's see what others have to say, I said?\n\nAnd the reviews of the stuffed eggplant were very high.  So I placed my to-go order and said \"okay, let's go find the place!\" to which I did not do my homework and had to walk over a mile through dark shady areas where homeless people shouted at me as I jogged by with my earbuds in.  The restaurant itself is not in a shady area, shadiness was just along the path that I apparently chose.\n\nThe staff was nice, my food was ready right away, and they even let me know that they don't think the bus takes credit card.  So I did the Uber thing for the first time and that just rocked, nice clean car, gentleman with an entertaining foreign accent, I just needed him to say the word \"family\" and it would've been complete.  But this isn't a review for Uber. \n\nGot back to my hotel and was sad that the to-go order did NOT include utensils.  I guess they assumed that I was going \"to go\" somewhere that had a fork and knife.  Fortunately my hotel accommodated, and it was time.  And I was hungry.\n\nOne bite of the stuffed eggplant and the first thing in my head was \"OMG this eggplant is BANANAS.  You know how good it is?  So good it's going to make me actually post a review on yelp for the first time in forever!\"  Then I thought \"saying bananas about a dish with no bananas may be misleading, hopefully bananas doesn't show up in the review aggregator\".\n\nBut anyway this one dish that I bought for myself was damn good.  I don't know what the rest of their menu is about but I don't care right now, I'd go back and get this AGAIN.  The veggies they included in it are great too, I think I identified zucchini, red peppers, maybe other stuff too but it's drenched in delicious green curry so I couldn't identify it.  I probably didn't need to order the rice since the dish itself was pretty filling for one person on its own.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED: at least the stuffed eggplant dish.

Although each occasion consisted of last minute reservations, we were always seated in a timely manner where our party never had to wait too long.\n\nWith Thai food, i usually order the same dish. It's either yellow curry with steam rice or pad thai. And both dishes are very tasty at Basil Thai. However, i should probably broaden my horizons because i'm sure this restaurant has more more to offer with the other dishes on their menu.\n\nMy friend (who lives 2 blocks away from the restaurant) mentioned to me that she literally goes there Thursday evenings just to order a dessert plate which is the slightly fried bananas served with coconut ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-17", "description": "Wow I rated them a 4 about five years ago. Well I don't know what happened to Basil Thai because the other night I didn't quite have the same experience. 2.5 stars and I was thinking about bumping them up to a 3 but the 2 star  description of \"Meh. I've experienced better\" pretty much sums up my dining experience to a T. Maybe I was expecting a lot more b/c of the rave reviews...I don't know but all I know is that I was pretty disappointed.\n\nFirst of all, don't say that there is no wait, to come on in when a customer calls in to ask what the wait time is for 2 people. We were starving and when we walked in minutes later (we live nearby) and there were several people waiting near the front benches. They told us they are waiting for other diners to finish their meal before we were seated. At that point, we ended up just staying as we had parked and it was freezing outside. But I was definitely irked to say the least. We probably waited a good amount of time enough to be irked because they flat out lied or the person just never bothered checking.\n\nMy other issue with dinner that night was that our side dish or veggie fried rice tasted like FISH. They either did not wash the utensils or the pan when stir frying the fried rice but I immediately tasted some fishiness in my dish. Gross when you're not expecting to taste fish. What if I was allergic? Even their curry dish lacked flavor and it was just not a good quality tasty dish that I've had from other Thai restaurants. \n\nService was attentive and the waitress/hostess was very friendly. I think that was pretty much the only redeeming quality of our experience that night.", "author": "Esther A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-09", "description": "I went here for a friend's going-away party that she threw. We had a reservation for 22 people (yeah, it was a super LONG table) and a set menu of 2 appetizers and 5 entrees and rice, for $26 per person including tax/tip. Pretty good deal for a nice restaurant and that much food, I would say...\n\nThe restaurant is small but decor is beautiful. As soon as I walked in, I felt underdressed. But then I looked at some of the people eating, and when I saw many of them dressed casually, I felt better (until my friend's other guests starting showing up in their clubbing attire). Our table was very nicely set, with candles, even.\n\nThe following was our menu and my comments on each (See photos for pictures of each):\n\nSTARTERS \n1. gai sate: marinated chicken grilled on bamboo skewers served with peanut sauce \n   * I thought this was good, especially the peanut sauce!\n\n2. Basil's rolls sampler: crispy rice paper wrapped tiger prawns + crispy spring rolls stuffed with vermicelli and cabbage, served with sweet dipping sauce\n   * I didn't like this so much, but I only had the spring rolls (didn't realize there were two kinds of rolls on the platter). I really didn't like the dipping sauce, so I used the peanut sauce from the other appetizer and it made it a little better.\n\nMAIN COURSE \n3. pad thai: rice stick noodles with prawns, tofu, beansprouts and chive\n   * Mediocre. I've had better pad thai even at the fast food thai place in Berkeley! (incidentally, called Thai Basil...lol)\n \n4. pak rad kang: charbroiled oriental eggplant, zucchini, squash, and tomatoes in creamy curry sauce (*spicy*) \n   * Actually, the curry sauce turned me off so I didn't try this. Sorry. Didn't hear anything exciting from other people though, except from the people who really hate spicy foods.\n\n5. tamarind prawns: light battered prawns wok tossed in spicy tamarind with crisp shallots and garlic \n   * OMG!!! THIS WAS SOOOO DELICIOUS! Thankfully the plate was right in front of me and I kept taking more...hopefully everyone still got their share lol. It's not spicy at all, despite the \"spicy tamarind\" in the description.\n\n6. gai-kra-prow: minced chicken sauted with fresh chili, basil and oriental eggplant (*spicy*)\n   * This was ok. The minced chicken looked like ground beef (which is what everyone thought it was), and the eggplant wasn't too bad (but I'm not a big fan of eggplant). Slightly spicy in my trained-in-Korea tastebuds' opinion.\n\n7. param-rungsong: grilled marinated skirt steak topped with peanut sauce \n    * DELICIOUS. I couldn't decide whether I liked this steak more or the prawns. They do a great job on the peanut sauce, I'd say. The steak was super tender and juicy, not dry at all. They were cut in pretty small strips though.\n\n8. steamed jasmine rice \n    * Can't really screw this one up. Jasmine rice has always been my favorite type of rice.\n\nI give 3 stars because I only really liked 2.5 out of the 7 dishes we had (rice doesn't count). The others were okay, but the price was pretty good for a dinner that contains a filling sampler of so many different dishes.\n\nRandom other tidbits:\nParking [street] is interesting. Before going, I checked yelp for parking reviews (just did a keyword search for \"parking\" on this page) and things looked pretty bleak. We decided to drive anyways and found a spot on the same block as the restaurant. Everyone else in our party seemed to have little trouble with parking. It was hard to tell whether our spot was legal since it looked like the sidewalk had been painted different colors at different times and it was all chipped off anyways. Other people were parked there so we figured it'd be ok - I guess it was since nobody got any tickets!\n\nBathrooms were single-occupancy only. Kinda annoying if you're a girl - pretty much have to wait every time, but it's a small restaurant so the line never gets that big. They have clever postcards for you to look at (and take) while you're waiting.\n\nWatch out for your jacket - the chairs are not designed for hanging jackets and they slip off easily. There's also 4 coat hangers in the back.\n\nOh, I forgot this is a Thai restaurant. From eating at a couple other Thai restaurants with my friends from Thailand, I'm pretty sure this isn't very authentic. Some dishes are pretty good and it's a nice restaurant, but don't decide your like or dislike for true Thai food based on this experience.", "author": "Esther Y."}

I had the Thai Pineapple Fried Rice, substituting chicken for the prawns.  The appetizer was delicious and had me in full anticipation for the main course.  Wow, what a let down.  While my wife's dish was very nice, mine was very poor.  The chicken had no seasoning and had no taste.  I actually had to use my wife's green curry sauce to make the chicken palatable.  Very disappointed, especially as I had barely eaten all day, anticipating gorging on quality Thai food.

I expected so much better because the restaurant's space is gorgeous, on a great street with after-dinner venues for cocktails like Raven and Bloodhound.  The hostess who seated us was very confused, at first tried to take us to a table that was still occupied and let us stand around awkwardly before ushering us back down the entire length of the restaurant to wait for a table...when there were several open two-tops ready.\n\nBusboys were very attentive with water but it took over 30 minutes for any waiter to show up to take our order.  It was unclear the entire time who was actually assigned to our table because at least three different waitstaff and possibly a manager brought our food/drinks, service was inconsistent.  At one point, after a disappointingly small bottle of sake for $8, my friend asked for the wine list again and that was never brought to us despite repeated requests.\n\nThe food itself: I have absolutely had better at probably a hundred Thai restaurants elsewhere in the Bay Area and on the East Coast--the greasy, paltry roti and beef curry actually made me pine for Penang in Cambridge, MA because Basil Thai's version is weak as hell.  Pan-fried dumplings appetizer was okay, as much as pan-fried dumplings anywhere are always good by their very nature.  The pad-see-ew was VERY bland and definitely needed a good hit of soy sauce and black pepper to punch it back to life as leftovers the next day.  \n\nOverall, we felt fairly ignored as a two-top while the larger tables had attentive service and the food was mediocre.

Shrimp pad thai was mighty tasty and I wish it were bigger! Duck curry was standard and the chunks of pineapple were a nice addition.

Decent Thai fusion food as well (would have given 3.5 stars if it were not for my particular experience). But I was Somewhat unimpressed with the service. I clearly spoke the entire line of my order (~7 words) when I ordered, but when the food came I realized it was not at all what I ordered, in fact it had some items mixed in that I shouldn't eat (some of the few things that cause me indigestion) or don't like too much. But I was hungry and with a group of people from work, so didn't want to sit there not eating so decided to poke at it until the server came. Except she never came to check in on us (this is pretty standard of  wait staff). Once my colleagues were more than half way through their food, I got up to fix my order. When I told the waiter it was the wrong item and again said what I ordered, she was still confused. She clearly did not know what I ordered was on the menu. She still didn't put the order in then and returned to the table to confirm I still wanted the right order and wanted to take the plate in front of me a way. I told her I would pick at it until my food came (so again, I wasn't the awkward one without food). When my food finally did come, everyone had finished eating, so it was still awkward. Not to mention that they added an extra filler to the dish that was not on the menu (I suspect they were running low on the  main ingredient - kabocha squash - because the pieces of it that I got still had green on the edge from the skin). All this could have been tolerated, but when she brought the bill, it had the extra item on it, so I had to get up and request it be removed!! This restaurant may have a nice ambiance, and good food, but it is not exactly a hole in the wall and isn't cheap so I expect them to operate like a proper restaurant and not charge people when the restaurant gets it wrong without being told what they have to do. Needless to say, I appeared like the problem one in the group and did not have as enjoyable a meal as it should have been since so many little things went wrong. I would have dismissed any one of these incidents as a one off but the combination of these events left me feeling dissatisfied and unsure of when I will return.", "author": "Kai J."}

Basil Thai is a run-of-the-mill Thai spot that has the expected items on the menu that you can always fall back on. My boyfriend and I tried the roti, the crab fried rice, and the crispy chicken entree with sticky rice. The roti was a little too fried for my taste, and it lost some of the buttery flakiness of a good roti. However, the green curry sauce was great for dipping, and I ended up using it to flavor my fried rice as well. The crab fried rice had a good amount of real crab meat, but the flavor was a little lacking. The crispy chicken was on the opposite end of the spectrum, almost drowning in a too-salty sauce that made the crispy chicken not so crispy anymore.

The decor seemed a little upscale but still had a casual feeling. Considering how late it was, they had pretty good business. We were given delicious shrimp chips to nom on while we decided on what to get. We had the Curry Puffs to start which had curried diced duck and sweet potato in a puff pastry (much like an empanada), so good! For my entree, I decided to go with the panang short ribs which was also really good and not too spicy. Both of my Dad and Sister's dishes were really good too. They got the pork shoulders and curry lamb. My sister, who had the pork shoulders, finished her whole plate without leaving a single veggie or garnish behind! Me on the other hand tried really hard to finish my food but just couldn't do it. Since we were staying in a hotel, we didn't have a mini fridge so I tried to eat as much of my entree as I could since I don't like to waste food.\n\nI wish I had room for desert though. Fried bananas with coconut ice cream was calling my name and all the reviews mentioned how good it was. Around 10pm, the waitress came to our table asking if we wanted dessert. She said that it was last call since they were closing soon. I don't think I've ever eaten somewhere where they had a last call for food. There was people who came in after she did this and they were served their dinner, weird. \n\nOur waitress was very hospitable though and made sure that a glass was never empty.

We ended up waiting quite awhile for tables and even at that, ended up sitting at three tables (4, 4, and 2 -- the table of two was far away from the rest of us), which is why they lost one star. \n\nMy vegetarian friend and I ordered pad kee mao and basil's eggplant (+ jasmine rice), both with tofu and no fish sauce, which totally deviates from what is stated on the menu.

I was never really a fan of pineapple fried rice, but this place's was really good; the flavors were evenly distributed and the sweetness of the pineapple flavor nicely balanced the prawns.  \nThe stir-fried garlic noodles with seafood was surprisingly spicy (but not too spicy) which was a nice.  The pan-fried rice noodle with pork and veggies was pretty good too.  I usually get Pad Thai when I go out to eat Thai food because it's safe and you can't really screw it up.  But the this pan-fried noodle of pork and veggies is now one of my new favorites  :)\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is really nice and feels kind of classy which I really like, because let's be honest, how many inexpensive Thai places are kind of fancy.\nA comment I would like to mention is the service was a little smothering.  I mean, the service staff here were very nice which is great, but my friends and I felt at times the servers were smothering us.  So I don't know if I would consider that a bad or good thing.\nI recommend this place to anyone to try :)", "author": "Angelica Y."}

Sauce was good with a bit of heat.  I prefer the rolls down the street at their sister restaurant, Basil Canteen however.\n\nAlso ordered their house romaine salad w/ onion, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  It too was served with fried tofu...now I know tofu does not have much flavor at all...but this had none.  Zip.  Zero.  I was a bit confused.  The salad had a warm peanut dressing which made the entire dish.  Loved it.  I was suprised about it being warm as I don't think the menu described it as such, but thinking about it in hindsight, of course it made sense.\n\nThe decor was odd I thought.  The wicker patio style chairs at the tables did not go with the cement bar top and dark wood chairs.  I've sat in those type chairs and find them very uncomfortable and awkward to sit at a table in-but I was at the bar-so maybe not the case?\n\nService was quick and attentive.", "author": "Teri X."}

I have been to basil thai about 15 times with non-minority friends. I came with my family being a minority. We were unlucky enough to have the manager yesterday at 8pm as a waitress. The most prejudice waitress I have ever dealt with. She was extremely rude. She refused to give me more sauce. Another waiter came and closed the sauces almost so we wouldn't touch them. Her and other co-workers were starring at us and laughing their asses off. I asked for the manager and she said she was the manager. I told her politely how I felt and she did not say anything with a smile on her face. When we were serve water it was almost spilled caused she had aggressive pours.

Chicken (gai satay) $5. - comes with 2 skewers and they were GOOD.  nothing really special or unique but you can't complain about good taste and good quality.  \n\n2. Chicken and oyster mushrooms in lemongrass, galanga, and coconut milk soup (dtom ka gai) $8. - love love love this soup but if you want THE BEST, i would go to Lers Ros for this.  It's got tangy, sweet, salty, smooth, and spicy all in one sip.  seriously amazing soup.  \n\n3.  Thai pineapple fried rice with prawns and cashew nuts (kao pad sapparot) $10. - good, but the portions are a little small.  we had a party of 5 so this definitely was not \"splittable\"\n\n4.  Flame grilled pork shoulder filet served with grilled pineapple and tomato (mu yang) - $12  - not the greatest dish i had.  preparation was good but didn't have full flavor and was actually a little tough.  i wanted it to be more tender as you should expect with pork shoulder.\n\n5.  Prawns, calamari, and mussels stir-fried with zuchini, onions, basil, and fresh chili * (pad talay ruam mit) - $13. - this was probably my second favorite dish.  they had lots of variety but again, portions were a bit small.  all the taste was great, the food was fresh and made to order!\n\n6.  Angus steak cubes, snake beans, and apple eggplant in green curry * (kieow wan neur) - $13. -  this was my favorite but it had more veggies than meat!  i want juicy bites of angus steak with every spoonful i grab.\n\noverall good, definitely a little on the pricy side for the amount of food you get.  nothing to complain about but i know there are better alternatives.", "author": "Sandy L."}

However, for $7.5 the volume of food should have been double. Not a good value. Priced like sushi.  \n\nkao pad sapparot (Thai pineapple fried rice with prawns and cashew nuts)\n\nI think something is wrong when pineapple is the only flavor I could taste (when a piece was in my mouth) amongst a medley of rice, prawns, cherry tomatoes, cashews, green onions, egg, cilantro, and oil and more oil and then some more oil and then a little more oil... resulting in a very heavy and bland dish. \n\ngai pik khing (Crispy sliced chicken, string beans sweet & spicy 'pik-khing' curry)\n\nI could not eat much due to the oil, again. Chicken was less like strips and more like remnants. The ratio of good meat to sugary battery covering was low and not appealing. \n\nOpened the left-overs after arriving home, to see if worth eating later. Yuck. Oily and disgusting. Straight to the trash. I wish that I had gone some place else. $35 wasted. \n\nPS: My particular server was somewhat flat or disengaged expressing little interest in my experience; but then acting happy and animated and visibly smiling/laughing at the place where the wait staff congregates at the order terminal.

Not sure what they will do about the food. \n\nBasil Thai's best days may be in the past, or maybe you will get a good experience based more randomly on which cook is working. It's hard to say.

Each one was helpful, but the main guy helping us was especially great - he didn't feel like he needed to be elsewhere when we asked for details on a bunch of menu items.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Minced pork and shrimp pansticker appetizer\n- Skirt steak with curried peanut sauce\n- Seafood curry (we ordered it with yellow instead of green curry)\n- 2 Thai iced teas\n\nThe appetizers were a great way to kick off the meal. My only problem with them is that the filling seemed to be more of a sausage that sat in the middle of the dumpling rather than filling it to the corners. Just a matter of aesthetics, though, as it was very very tasty. The sauce that came with was great, too.\n\nThe skirt steak with curried peanut sauce was most likely the highlight of this meal, if I had to name one. It came presented very well (as did everything else), topped with peanuts and garnished with ripe tomato slices. There is no way to describe how good this was. They don't provide you with a knife because you don't need it.\n\nThe seafood curry was good, but pretty similar to what I've had at other Thai restaurants. What set it apart was the fact that they made it milder than I've ever been able to get other places do - big thumbs up as we weren't in a spicy mood, so to speak. The scallops were done to perfection - not too flaky, but not too mushy, either. Much unlike any other Thai seafood curry I've had, the shrimp were actually still moist in the middle - most other places dry them out too much. The mussels were excellent, too. \n\nNow, Thai iced tea... I'd never tried it before going to Basil Thai, but my friend ordered one and we shared it to start out. If you don't like tea, Thai iced tea is NOT for you. It has a very strong Chai flavor, and the tea is sweetened (a lot) and then mixed with cream. The server explained that they buy a special Thai iced tea mix, so they do not make it themselves. However, it was very good and my friend said it was better than others she'd had.\n\nAside from the price - and it's not cheap, as we didn't get out under $50 after tip - this place is excellent.

The noodles in the Pad Ke Mao were just right - not too thick and not too thin.  The Jungle Beef was the best dish of the bunch.  Even though it wasn't spicy at first, the spicyness crept up on us.  The Gai Kra-Pow was also well done.  Everything was delicious.  If your looking for great Thai food in the area, I would highly recommend Basil Thai.\n\nThey also had a dessert menu which looked wonderfully delicious, but I was already full.

We got a big table at the back of the restaurant, which was unexpectedly freezing. The waitress showed absolutely no intention to improve our condition, and half of the table had to sit wearing winter jackets. After the second complaint we suggested she could provide us with complimentary hot tea, since it is impossible to heat up the back of the restaurant, which was welcomed with a blunt refusal. This made us feel unwelcome and significantly lowered our dining experience. I hope the restaurant will invest in their employee training/customer care before losing their guests.", "author": "Marina R."}

(Reservation at 7, sat down at 8.) Ambiance was nice, with a sort of modern elegance. Small but cozy restaurant with subtle overcast lighting. \n\nUnfortunately, we were served beautifully plated, mediocre Thai food. Service was spot on the entire night, constantly filling our water for us and making sure our finished plates were taken away. With so much potential and so much going for Basil Thai, it's sad to say that such a promising establishment falls flat on the most important aspect of a restaurant: the food.\n\nI had the Basil Eggplant ($9.00) and a side of brown rice ($2.00) but my friend accidentally ordered the pad thai ($10.00), which was not vegetarian, so we had a switch. They give more shrimp than usual, which is a plus if you enjoy seafood, but their bean sprouts were limp, and the noodles were not even equivalent to that of King of Thai. The bite of what I had previously ordered was bland, and the brown rice was overcooked.\nAnother friend had a platter of homemade red velvet cupcakes to share, but the servers quickly mentioned a $1.50 per person cake cutting fee for...cupcakes. To avoid any more extra fees (18% tax for 6+ groups) we refrained from eating the cupcakes until we left.\n\nIf not for the service and atmosphere, I might have given this place two stars.", "author": "Colleen M."}

I was worried about having dinner for such a large group somewhere in SF with reasonable prices given that most places aren't that big, but they made it super easy!   I called 2 days before to make reservations and it was suggested that we put in our orders so everyone could get their food at the same time.  Given such a large group, they gave me the option to have a standard meal, but with allergies, pickiness, and my personal preference of letting people get what they want, I opted to place people orders early.  The majority of my group placed their order, but the remaining folks ordered at the restaurant.\n\nThe day of the dinner, I called to let them know my party was running a few minutes behind but they simply thank'd me for letting them know and they were OK with us getting there 30 minutes later.  We arrived a bit after 7 on a Friday and it wasn't crowded at all.  We ordered drinks and the last of the food orders, and everyone had their food in 30-45 minutes.  Very impressive!  Ordering ahead was definitely the thing to do.  Everyone loved the food, many asked how I found the place so I only have Yelp to thank for that.  \n\nI had the Roti and Stir-fried garlic noodle with prawns, mussels, squid and fresh basil  (seafood bamee)..the noodles were quite spicy (I'm kind of a wuss when it comes to spicy food) but it was so tasty I didn't let the spiciness phase me..just drank lots of water.

You don't get all lazy and guilty when you eat...eggplant.\n\nSo I had the eggplant with peanut sauce. Anything that remotely contains a peanut product I will try, and blame my father for that. Also blame him for my growing need of good psychiatrists. But we're talking about food, and this food was fantastic. Their yellow corn cake fritters were also super bitchin. Did I seriously just say bitchin? Yes. Blame the dad for that also. \n\nI will admit, I wasn't soooo keen on their spring rolls. Then again, I don't know why. It just didn't taste...*right*. It was good, but just not *right*. Love-hate relationship with spring rolls. But I have a love-hate relationship with just about everything. So four stars.", "author": "Jaime L."}

That attitude has increased somewhat, although if you ask one particular friend she'll tell you I still don't eat anything.

I have never been a big curry fan, ever since a sixth grade school project where we had to make a dish from a country we were reporting on (me- Australia), and I completely overdosed on the curry.  Plus side is I now know how to make pavlova.  But I digress.  I figured after 20 some-odd years of being picky, I have to just suck it up (literally) and try new things.  I was very happy with the selection I made (granted, I had some help) and will most likely go back because I'm a big fan of pumpkin and peanut sauce.  Not together, mind you.\n\nThe three stars is for the service.  Perhaps it's because of my party's attire- 2 extras from a Culture Club video, one zebra hooker (me), and one normal fellow with a penchant for skinny ties- but I felt that the service didn't reflect the food.  Granted, it was the end of the night and it was blatantly obvious that they wanted to close, but I thought it could have been better.

He suggested Basil and upon reading a few other positive reviews, we thought we'd give it a shot. \n\nI would be lying if I said there is not a dearth of Thai food restaurants in the city, so the idea of a new Thai food restaurant seemed passable but not exciting. \n\nWe grabbed drinks at the bar as we waited for one of the tables to open up. Once seated, we started off our meal with the Grilled Indian Bread with eggplant, red bell pepper and green curry dipping sauce. Each of us agreed that green curry had a zippy heated finish with a slightly sweet under note. Our friend ended up ordering an entree with the green curry because he had liked it so much. \n\nOut came the entrees- the tamarind shrimp, suggested by the hostess turned out to be a coconut battered shrimp plate with the sweet-and-sour tamarind sauce drizzled over the shrimp, onions and bell peppers which gave the dish crunch. Next came the pad-see-yeuw- a wide noodle dish with bok choy and chicken in a savory brown sauce. My interest had been piqued by the braised pork shoulder with kabocha squash in a panang curry, as I have rarely seen pork offered in curry dishes at other Thai restaurants. The curry was rich as the pork and squash were tender. That last minute addition of chicken in green curry turned out to be one of the more interesting dishes of the night as it arrived in green curry slathered bundles. Each bundle was wrapped with grilled eggplant and zucchini slices and inside- surprise- was a chicken meatball grafted together with onion and cabbage. \n\nWe gave all the dishes two thumbs up and left with a few leftovers from an unexpectedly good meal. The wait staff bordered on being slightly aloof, but I'll give it to them that we were walk-in's on a Saturday night for dinner.  \n\nIf you're craving Thai, I would recommend heading down to Folsom to try Basil.", "author": "Annelies Z."}

The menu says it's served medium-spicy and it was definitely medium-spicy for me because after three bites I started to hiccup! That's how I know it's actually got a real level of Asian spice to it - if it makes me hiccup. The curry sauce was a nice mix of heat, creaminess, and sweetness. I think third-rate Thai restaurants tend to overload their curries with coconut milk in an attempt to make it rich and give it body, but I usually can't stomach more than a few bites of that type of curry. The curry sauce on my jungle beef was just right for me. The beef itself was tender, the portion was just right for me and I finished the entire meal and wasn't overly stuffed (although a little more food wouldn't have hurt). They gave me a choice of jasmine, brown, or sticky rice. \n\nFor $10 the quality of the food was very good. I think I might call in a pick up order for lunch in the future if I'm stressed for time. Would love to try the roti with green curry. Service is courteous, not necessarily overtly friendly or warm but I'm fine with that.

I ordered the following for takeout:\n\nGai satay /Chicken Satay -  2 sticks of chicken satay consisting of breast of chicken meat with peanut sauce and small cucumber salad.  Best part of the meal.  \n\nTom ka gai/Chicken coconut soup - Tasty soup with higher acidity than normal for this soup.  Just made me want to drink water to dilute the taste.  \n\nTamarind Prawns -  It's really just sweet and sour  shrimp(more sweet than sour!) IMHO.  The prawns are too small and really only qualify as shrimps.  There was about 8 shrimp per $12 order.  I think it was reasonable however the sauce is a little too sweet.  \n\nOverall, I like this restaurant.

Delicious coconut flavors with a tiny kick of spice on the end. Very satisfying. Pad talay, even being not a huge seafood guy, was delicious as the seafood absorbed the flavors of the sauce. Vegetables were nearly perfect, neither soggy or tough.\nPad rad kang - rad (I know, I gotta stop) but that green curry is just awesome. \n\nTwo favorites had to be the Pad Ke Mao - the wide noodes with beef in a chilli sauce. Awesome and satisfying - perhaps the ultimate thai comfort food. Jungle beef was a huge hit.\n\nI appreciated the thai ice tea because I could actually taste the tea for a change versus these concoctions that are 4/5ths condensed milk. \n\nService was good and pretty quick - never felt like we were waiting for much.\n\nGood experience overall.", "author": "Ross R."}

Basil manages to be everything that a restaurant should be: nice subtle decor, cool diverse crowd, good portions and quite affordable. It's good enough to be a nice first date and friendly enough to become a regular.\n\nFor starters, we had grilled Indian bread with green curry and oriental eggplant. The bread was slightly fried, crispy and flaky. The green curry was so delicious we cleaned up the plates. For entrees, we had the roasted duck & string-less snap peas wok-tossed with curry paste & peppercorn. The curry was amazing. The peppercorn gave it a subtle little edge. We also had grilled marinated skirt steak with peanut sauce. The meat was perfectly marinated and the peanut sauce on the sweet side. I only wished they would serve it with something a little bit more exciting than steamed broccoli and sliced tomatoes.\n\nIt is probably one of the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. It's not super authentic... I'd call it Modern Thai but it's definitely worth a try. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could!", "author": "Didier N."}

Our pretty, older sister version of Maggie Q, waitress made it a very unpleasant experience. Of course she felt she was allowed to act however the way she wanted because we were a group of 10 so 18% gratuity was already included. This waitress even slammed a bowl of rice on my boyfriend's plate which we all thought was odd but that wasn't all...\n\nShe kept reminding us that they charge $1.50/person to cut cake and we told her we just had mini cupcakes which were bite size. She said no outside food or else they will charge. We understood the first 2 times she said it but once my friend took a peek in the box, she came back and said it again. After ordering our food and waiting for the rest of our party, she suddenly said that on Fridays and Saturdays, the bill has to equal $15/person. First of all... there was nothing on the menu that said that. We couldn't even find where it said that in the restaurant. She should have said that before anyone ordered. Most of the non-curry dishes were just 10 bucks. The waitress said we should order drinks and most of us did but that apparently did not meet the minimum charge yet... so she kept shoving the dessert menu at us. Annoyed by her attitude, we asked another waiter if this $15/person was really required and he said they usually don't apply it to large groups like us. We told our waitress that and she said she's the supervisor and stood by her claim. All of us were stuffed so we asked 'what if we didn't want to order anything?' and she said most people just do it. Then she suggested we can eat our cupcakes in here so the charge would be more than enough... she crazy? Finally, we asked to speak to the manager but he was not there so she \"called\" him. Result: our waitress said the manager would let us slide this once but next time, we cannot. NEXT TIME?? I don't think so. Oh yeah, we found out that we ordered more than enough to meet the minimum charge... even though she said we were short $15... \n\nBesides this tip-grubbing lady, the food is good, portion is enough, and prices are reasonable. I mean the $15/person on Friday and Saturday is not too big of a deal if you order curry and rice since that's over $15 anyway. (Pad-kee-mao -$10- is pretty good btw!) \n\nBasil Thai might deserve more stars but the waitress made us leaving this place with such a horrible impression that none of us will ever come here again.", "author": "Pansy L."}

The service is spotless - they are attentive, timely and considerate.  I have never had bad customer service nor poor quality food at Basil Thai.\n\nBasil Thai offers consistently great Thai food at reasonable prices. When you dine in the restaurant, you feel like you're in a much more \"high end\" restaurant than most Thai places. My favorite lunch is the crispy bean curd & cashew nut -- and they do a fantastic sticky rice with mango. I also recommend the cellophane noodles, and the corn fritter. They do good fried and fresh veggie rolls (porpia and porpia sod).\n\nThey also have put some thought into the containers for take-out orders. Owner Arun told me \"Our to-go packing are totally recyclable.\" At lunch time for large order or a buffet style they use aluminum tray, for a smaller order or individual bento box, coated brown paper box. For dinner they use a combination of high quality recyclable, reuseable plastic container and coated brown paper.\nEdit My Review Manage Review \n\nThe lunches are fantastic.  I recommend getting the lunch specials - mostly rice plates - really nicely done with just the right amount of food (I'm a pretty big person and an athlete).\n\nI adore their kao pode tod (yellow corn fritters) -- I don't know of any place else in the city that does these, and they are not soggy greaseballs like corn fritters tend to be at Southern restaurants.  Their pad thai is fantastic, and the \"crunchy beancakes\" (aka fried tofu) are really nicely done.  The green papaya salad is always out of this world.

The place is located in a pretty convenient location. I know a couple of my friends walked just a couple blocks from the bart station over, so it's in a pretty good location if you're downtown and looking for a decent place to eat. \n\nWe had a party of 12 and a reservation for 7:00. We were seated promptly. The restaurant was packed, but there was no wait when I arrived. A party trickled on after us, and the hostess told them 15 minutes. Not too bad, I think, for a Saturday night dinner around 7. \n\nAnyway, we all sat, and were served extremely quickly. I think we were all impressed by the service. Most of our got pad thai, which some of my friends complained was a bit sweet, but I honestly have a hard time differentiating between bad pad thai and good pad thai, so it tasted pretty good to me. Some other friends ordered Pad Ke Mao and some Thai chicken salad and curry dishes. I think mostly everyone felt the food was decent, nothing not to rave nor complain about. It only took about 10 minutes, at most, to serve all but one of us, which was almost impressive, but the last missing meal was another pad thai which 4 of us got, so I guess they had miscounted the number of pad thais. Regardless, his meal took almost longer to whip up than all the other meals did... a bit strange. \n\nThe waitress and servers were all very courteous and prompt. One thing that sorta bugs me about restaurants: places that don't serve a small something for a birthday. I mean if a Korean BBQ joint sticks a candle in a 25 cent Chocopie for a birthday, I think most places can afford to put a little cookie down and top off more than half the dessert cup with whipped cream. We ordered him a Coffee dessert with whipped cream, shaved ice, and kahlua. Not worth it. \n\nAt the end of the meal, we thought we'd overpaid and of course, they had already added gratuity in the meal, so after the waitress took our check and the cash and card we put down, we seemed to be $7 short, which we were convinced we were not. But no one wants to make a complication out of something like that on our beloved friend's birthday. So we forked our money over and left. I'm not sure how situations like these are usually resolved, but I think most of the members in our party felt that they wanted to recount the money again, since more than a couple of us had counted all the money we put down. I guess it would have been a bit more courteous to come back with our money or at least grab someone from the table and deal with it by the computer than to come over and just straight up tell us we were down $7. \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience.

The flavor was good and the mussels and calamari were cooked just right.  \n\nI think the next time I make it back there I'll probably try one of the curry dishes because I wished that the sauce on my entree was a little thicker like the curry sauce that we had in the appetizer.  (That's just a personal preference.)\n\nIf the location was closer to my home or work I'd probably return more often.

The first thing you'll notice is the modern decor and soft lighting (see my pics).  We had a party of over 30 people and we occupied the entire rear section of the restaurant.  They decided on a set menu served family style.  I was drunk so I don't remember the specifics of the food but I do recall everything tasting good.  The dishes came out one after another starting with appetizers and ending with entrees.  There had to be more than 7 courses served.  I've eaten Thai food at a dozen other places and this place is probably in the top three.  The service was efficient for the huge party we had.  \n\nWe spent most of our time at the bar where we got our fill of moderately priced drinks.

Again, just a personal preference thing.\n\nOne additional note:  The white rice was surprisingly really sticky.

I took bart up there to meet him, and the walk was through the loveliness that is the tenderloin. I asked this elderly lady if I was walking in the right direction to get to Folsom and she said yes \"be careful hunney\". Haha great. that only worried me a wee bit. \n\nThe restaurant was really cute. From the outside it's a fairly simple looking grey building on a janky street. But the inside was beautiful. It's the perfect date place. Quiet, dimly lit with candles, and simply but elegantly decorated. The service staff was very efficient, which was an amazing plus. I hate going on dates and having a waiter/waitress trying to be extra friendly and strike up a conversation with you. Obviously we're on a date, so stop interrupting! Didn't have that problem here. They were polite and quiet, quickly refilled our waters a dozen times over, and didn't flash giant, toothy smiles that make you feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe food had it's ups and downs. Less of the latter. We had calamari as an appetizer and a duck dish and chicken dish for entrees. The duck was amazing! This is the first time I've ever had duck and I'm in loveeeee. The chicken was minced and not much to my liking, though it did have little bits of red chili in it. Every once in a while I'd bite into one and there'd be a 'pop\" of fire in my mouth.

Every aspect of the place is superior - stand-out dishes (two that I have to order every time are the corn fritter appetizer and, the roasted duck in red curry sauce), cocktails, service and atmosphere. The menu has both traditional Thai items that you find in all Thai restaurants (great pad thai, pad se-ew, etc) and a number of unique dishes that I have not encountered elsewhere. The drinks always come out great (I am constantly amazed at how many places can't get a manhattan right. Not a problem here).

The service is impeccable -Todd, Arun, Juju, Domingo, Tek and all the rest of the staff are great at what they do and are just great people. I have a great deal of personal experience that bears this out. When my 90 + year old parents lived with me, I would bring them here. The staff was so considerate and attentive, it became their favorite place. Whenever they saw us coming in the door, they would start making our manhattans without asking, and they would arrive at the table the same time we did. That's the kind of place it is.

First, I love the location, within walking distance of Davies Hall. Second, the inside is elegant with white cloth table covers, candles, and romance is in the air. Third, the service is outstanding. Fourth the food is tasty and reasonably priced. \n\nIf you are in a real hurry I recommend ordering 3 or more appetizers, woofing them down, elegantly, and then you are in and out in 30 minutes or less.

We had a surprise birthday party for our friend, they pulled out a divider and about 20 of us hid in the back of the restaurant.  He was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe place is clean and sports a modern decor.  Bonus:  It was a very quick walk from the Civic Center Bart!  They have a great full bar and some custom drinks.  Their mojito is mostly sweet and less with the alcohol, but minty deliciousness.  The Tuk Tuk was also mostly sweet -- so it might be safer for some to stick to wine or beer.\n\nOur food all came out hot and relatively at the same time -- pretty impressive.  I order the Panang beef, the meat was really tender and the sauce was delicious.  They brought me extra chili peppers -- I was very pleased.  The portion sizes weren't huge but I still ended up taking my food to go.\n\nI think the place was very understaffed but the service was still good considering such a huge group on a random Monday night.  They were apologetic even though I waited a very long time (30+ minutes) to close my bar tab, on top of the time to order and get my drinks made.  It took even longer to get a box for my meal, but since I wasn't going anywhere I was more than patient.  Another thing I appreciated was that we were not rushed out after we finished our meals.  We sat for a long time enjoying our drinks, conversation, and company.\n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy the food.  I was surprised how many dishes had egg plant though.  They also have brown rice!\n\nI think not going with a huge chaotic group would have easily bumped this review to a 5 star but it was still a great experience.", "author": "Van W."}

And oh, did I enjoy it!\n\nLocated just a few doors down from Bloodhound, we came over here after the porkfest to have our real dinner. I was surprised to see what a nice place it was, and wondered why I'd never been before. I could see it being a good spot for a casual date or a nice dinner with a group of friends. Plus they had a great looking full bar. I'd been to their sister restaurant, Basil Canteen down the street at 11th & Folsom, and although that space is a lot cooler (it used to be The Public), the food here was a lot better.\n\nThe menu had most of the typical Thai dishes, and everything was really inexpensive at around $10. We started with the roti, which was like a Thai green curry eggplant pizza. The roti was deliciously golden crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The four of us picked an entree and shared everything family style. We got 3 noodle dishes (pad thai with prawns, pad see ew with tofu and pad ke mao with chicken) and the pad rad kang (a vegetable green curry), and everything was very tasty. They ran out of the flat wide noodles for the pad ke mao, so they substituted with the thin rice stick noodle, and I actually enjoyed it that way more. I loved the amount of heat in that dish as well. The pad thai was excellent. \n\nAlthough I didn't have dessert, the girls ordered the mango sticky rice, and devoured it. For 4.5 people (the 1/2 had a beer but no food), the bill came out to $60. It's probably the best deal you'll find along this part of Folsom. Plus, you can go back to Bloodhound afterward to continue drinking!", "author": "Connie C."}

Our appetizers and salad were very good, an I had a great glass of wine at a great price. Our entrees were bad. The grilled \"Jumbo\" prawns were not very large, and the grill they use infused the food with a butane taste (much like the blow torch does when sushi restaurants incorrectly sear sushi) and they were drowned in sauce.  The cubes beef dish we orders had some pieces that were over cooked, some raw, with a gamey flavor that you don't want in a beef dish. The dessert, a fried banana with coconut ice cream, was sooo delicious...but they served it in a flat plate with only a spoon.

(Few places are.) I'm also a fan because they are very good about leaving out the fish sauce when requested, which is great for someone like me whose lips puff up at the slightest seafood encounter. \n\nEveryone I know loves this place, especially the curries. Me, I'm addicted to the pad ke mao, spicy wide rice noodles & sliced beef stir-fried with basil, garlic and Thai chili.  But tonight I started off with the tom ka gai (a bit tart for my taste but I managed to finish it nonetheless) and then test-drove the gai kra-prow, minced chicken wok-fried with fresh Asian eggplant chili, Thai basil, & fresh chili.  I was not disappointed--it was fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  The only reason I give Basil Thai four stars instead of five is that I have found they overcook their rice from time to time.

Now good Thai food is another story, and just so we're clear I do not think Osha qualifies as good Thai food. Thanks to its growing popularity there are many Thai choices in the city, unfortunately they seem to all blur together with standard dishes such as Pad Thai, curries and other mains. \n\nBasil has quite a good menu with lots of options. I highly recommend trying a few of their grilled vegetable skewers. At $4/order for two skewers (or veggie pieces) its a perfect light snack and totally delicious. A word to the wise: they come with peanut sauce so if you are not interested in that let your server know. There are many meat options and a lot of their curries sounded amazing. It's always safe to try the Pad Thai if you are not sure where to start.\n\nThe interior of basil is very nice, especially compared to most causal Thai places. It's a little more formal and very dim.

Not just undercooked chicken but literally strips of flesh, like it had been stuffed raw, the eggplant grilled and then plated. With this being a dish where the meat was hiding inside a wrap, I am just thankful that the raw garlic (which was also a red flag- as I have had this dish many times before) led me to tear this dish open to investigate further before I ate any more which was very hard to do in the dimly lit setting this restaurant has. I'm not sure what upset me more, being served raw chicken! that in itself being extremely dangerous OR the lack of apology about not only potentially poisoning a customer but ruining my evening out with an old friend. In the very least, I would have expected the manager to stop by our table  AND our entire check to be 'on the house' alas, the raw chicken dish was removed from our check as it should be but there was no verbal mention of that when our check landed on our table. Our evening out prematurely ended as I declined the offer to remake the dish and my friend didn't want to continue his meal alone so we paid and left. In all honesty, I was too nauseous/retching to start a debate about being billed for this horrendous experience. So not only is this a review about being served RAW chicken, it is also about the sheer lack of customer service and handling of this experience. It also makes me question the kitchen practices allowing a raw dish to reach the table. Needless to say, I will not be back here and I'm a very realistic person, accidents happen but this review may not have been written had they stepped up to the plate (pardon the pun) and brought their A Game in the customer service department.", "author": "K G."}

They are a little more upscale and a more refined decor, but the food is just to die for. The food here is anything but sloppy, everything looks as if a lot of thought has gone into it and can back that up with a wonderful taste. Many items that I am used to seeing show up on my take out menus are not offered here, but I like that as a chance to try some new dishes, and have never been disappointed. \n\nI am normally of the school of thought where you stuff yourself for dinner and forget about dessert, but here is one of the few places where you really want to make a conscious effort to save a little room for dessert because everything they have is worth it.

If the place had lovely painted walls or real wood paneling, it couldn't be good, and it was not authentic Thai/Chinese/Burmese whatever.   It had to have a hideous stained acoustic ceiling and the kind of fake wood paneling you'd find in a '70s basement.  If it was peel 'n stick wood wallpaper, so much the better.  The focus was on the food, not the decor, and if too much effort was put in to the decor, the food had to suck.   By this measure, we wouldn't have gone near the beautiful and elegant Basil Thai with a 10 foot chopstick.\n\nHappily, as more and more Asian restaurants have discovered the power of  - for lack of a better word - fusion, they have learned that people will pay for nice surroundings as much as they will pay for a little more creativity in the menu.  Basil Thai definitely got that memo.  In addition to being a nice relaxing environment, the menu is not your usual Thai menu and has a lot of very interesting dishes you won't find anywhere else.  Everything is very good, fresh and spiced just right. The wine list is impressive and the servers are attentive.   \n\nOne of the better Thai Restaurants in the area, and always a great standby when we're out of ideas for an SF dining spot and we just want a relaxing and tasty dinner.", "author": "Jay Z."}

So this review is about service at the bar. Points for having a little hook for the DC to use for her purse. Points again for actually having those  tables that were empty upon our arrival and denied to us fill up complete during our meal.\nService was good, but it's the bar and I expect everything to be quicker there. It's a very nice space, a little loud but not to a point of interfering with conversation.\n\nAppetiziers were very good. I love me some fried foods. Corn and bean fritters were crispy on the outside and creamy on the insides with a nice sauce that kicks at the finish like Sebastion Coe. Veggie springs rolls were the perfect size, perfect angle slice to put on just enough of a another kicking sauce (that WAS different). The rolls delivered just the right amount of greasiness to make me feel indulgent but not guilt ridden.\n\nHere's the rub: the noodles peanuts and greens salad probably had a fish sauce on it. It tasted kind of funny and the noodles rolled up into an odd shape. I asked the waiter if the spring rolls were vegetarian and he said yes. I don't want to be an annoying nudge so I do not query everything I order. I kind of expect the server to tell me if anything else is not veggie.\n\nThe DC enjoyed the chicken soup a lot.

They coulda said something in the beginning, while i was waiting or even when they saw us eating them? I dunno, maybe they were trying to be polite, but if it was my restaurant and that was my rule, i would have said something earlier. I thought that was strange.

So a note for your reference: Basil Thai does not allow outside food to be brought in, and eaten there...Sorry.\n\nOtherwise, their drinks were tasty and looked good. They were also decently priced for their size and being in a restaurant.\n\nThe set up of the restaurant was kind of cool, when you walk in, you walk up these stairs (so, sorry, it is not a wheelchair friendly place but then again, if you come in a group, maybe your buddies can carry you up the stairs, cuz there's only like 5-6 of them.) and there's the bar, and some seating straight ahead of you and then also to your left. and then there's also an upstairs area (which i assume has seating (didn't get a chance to look)).

Their food is slightly expensive by thai standards, but is actually very good with decent portions.  The service, however, is a different story.\n\nI've been here on three occasions now for large-group lunch (maybe about 15 people?) with coworkers, each time, the service has gotten increasingly worse.  On this most recent visit there were several customer service no-nos, that I couldn't, in good conscience, let slide without writing a review.  \n\nFirst, we were seated at quite a long table to begin with, which was fine.  The waitress came around and took everyone's drink orders and brought out drinks, except for the four of us at the end.  One of us actually ask if we could order drinks, which we did.  And I swear they came around with water refills I think only once. \n\nSecond, the menu specifically states that, \"most dishes can be made vegetarian.\"  Fine.  I wanted to order the lunch special, which consists of a choice of stir fry type dishes and a choice of curry.  I politely asked if I could sub tofu for chicken in the spicy string bean dish.  I was abruptly told that there are no substitutions on the lunch menu.  I said, \"it doesn't say that there's no substitutions here, but it does say that dishes can be prepared vegetarian.\"  She said \"sorry, no substitutions.\"  I asked her to come back to me after she'd taken everyone's order, which she did, but not after she actually collected everyone's appetizer plates and input everyone's order.  I was getting pissed at this point.\n\nFinally, when they brought food out, they brought out about 3 dishes at a time with about a 5 to 7 minute delay between each round.  As a result, many people actually finished eating before the final wave of food came through.  And lucky me, I was the last one to be served, my plate arriving a good 5 minutes after every other person at the table received their food.  When I began to express my frustration with the situation, I was  rudely told that when they have large groups, they encourage people to order from the prix fixe menu.  A) that's not true because no one said that to us and b) If that's the lunch combo, sorry buddy, I freaking tried, no substitutions, remember?  One of the most frustrating things about this was that this actually happened last time we all came to lunch, except I (thankfully) wasn't last.  Really ridiculous when the place was empty when we came in, and you were expecting our reservation...\n\nIf there's a next time my office decides to patronize this place, they can count me out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-13", "description": "Last night the Beloved, Fab Miss K and I went to Basil Thai, in part because it was near Annie's Social Club (yay Gord!) and in part because of reviews here and elsewhere. \n\nSome meals transcend mere food and become blissful memories. Last night was one of those dinners.\n\nThe cast of characters:\nYrs Truly, an omnivore who prefers to avoid red meat, adores curry;\nThe Beloved, who will order charred cow whenever it appears:\nThe Fab Miss K, a staunch vegan.\n\nWe were all delighted.\n\nFor appetizers: Miss K ordered porpia sod, vegetables & tofu rolls with crushed peanuts, chili, and lime vinaigrette. They were light and crispy, not at all bland or mushy. I ordered the keow wan roti, grilled Indian bread with a luscious green curry, garnished with basil, and translucent savory eggplant. The B ordered curry puffs, flat, dumpling-like pastries filled with duck and sweet potatoes. Unbelievable - fried crispy but not hard, with a nice kick of cumin. \n\nThe B and I split our usual tom ka gai, and this turned out to be nothing out of the ordinary - excellent quality meat, the coconut milk well-blended and not too sharply spiced or choked with bamboo shoots. \n\nNow to the main courses. First, the B's charred cow, nuer yang:  grilled Angus sirloin accompanied by a lovely smoked mushroom, tomato, & aromatic herbs relish. Now, I find most cow to be a waste of my chewing effort, but this was thin, tender and meltingly good. \n\nI had the kang kari gai, which was both ridiculously inexpensive and far too much chicken for one person. I was mostly delighted by the mild yellow curry, which I asked them to bump up to a medium-hot.  One-quarter chicken? More like half a chicken! The meat was well-grilled, but hard to cut and the presentation was a bit underwhelming. What was amazing was the yellow curry itself. I nearly floated out of my seat. I dumped the sauce and potatoes on my plate, added the cucumber side salad, mixed in some brown rice, and was perfectly happy. Next time I'll get a tofu curry. \n\nFab Miss K was the recipient of a small plate of jewel-colored vegetables. She had the house oriental eggplant, with tofu, shitake mushrooms, and scallions saut\u00e9ed with basil-chili puree. She couldn't finish it, but it was delightful. I loved just looking at it.\n\nDespite our plenitude, we did not resist dessert. And Basil Thai doesn't stint. The B, unsurprisingly, had the fried banana and coconut ice cream, which he barely restrained himself from slurping the last of. Miss K babbled her praise for the sweet sticky rice and fresh mango, and I had a pana cotta - your basic flan - a lovely milk pudding of coconut with mango glaze. \n\nAnd the price? Recall all this food. Realize that the B and Miss K had several drinks as well. The whole thing came to under $150.00.\n\nFor SF, this is aaaamazing. I'm pimping this place to everyone I know. It's an up and coming neighborhood, and Basil Thai is a must-go restaurant. You heard me. Go now.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

Note: the bill surprisingly included $4.50 for 3 servings of jasmine rice..this was odd since there were four people at the table...it was also odd since no one was asked if they wanted rice.\n \nThe calamari salad was a spicy sweaty fish/garlic sauce flavored fresh/large/tender calamari topping assorted herbal greens...a bit much with the raw white onion quarters though.  \n\nThe lamb curry was perfect with crispy string beans, carrots, basil and bell peppers in a tangy red/orange curry sauce that was saucy...very saucy.\n\nBecause of the din (and possibly some language barriers) someone's dish was ordered with 'fried tofu' but out came plain cooked tofu...this was mentioned and a small bowl of replacement tofu appeared a few minutes later. The tofu curry was quite good; apparently Basil keeps an enormous vat of butter in the kitchen carefully maintained in a fondue temperatures with some of the SOMA art students hovering around paintbrushes in hand that they dip in the tub every few seconds solicitously coating every edge of every solid food particle in every hot dish on the menu. When Basil closes they  sneak into the Metreon to pour the unused butter over all the unsold popcorn and then munch on it while taking in a late nite showing of Basquiat. \n\nIt could happen.\n\nSo, if you don't care about accuracy in ordering results, but love fresh thai, then this is just the pagoda for you...very saucy.", "author": "Matthew L."}

I visited this restaurant with some friends before the Mars Bar Elite Event recently, at 7pm. No waiting for a table, even though it was peak hours...I'm guessing it's probably much more crowded on the weekends. Also, I like the bar placement in this restaurant...it's long and smack dab in the middle--a good spot to enjoy yourself & dine with other lone eaters while watching the boob tube.\n\nThe service was great--our server continually checked up on us to make sure everything was going OK, but managed to walk that fine unobtrusive line.\n\nWe shared a few different things:\n\nPaupia: Crispy Veggie Spring Rolls...I especially enjoyed the dipping sauce.\n\nTom Ka Gai: Essentially it was Thai Chicken Soup, with both coconut milk & lemongrass. The dinner table opinion was mixed on this one, but I enjoyed it enough to eat my friend's portion as well.\n\nKan Kari Gai: Tender chicken on the bone with yellow curry & potatoes. The potatoes were awesome, the chicken & curry not so much.\n\nPad Thai: Run-of-the-Mill Pad Thai, nothing special.\n\n--------\n\nWhile I had the warm & fuzzies while dining at Basil Thai, it unfortunately was only from the cold sake we were sharing.

I discovered Basil when I worked in the area. It was by far the best place to eat in the 5 block radius, although my co-workers and I didn't go there too often because we cherished this place as our \"treat\" after a long, stressful week. \n\nThe restaurant is clean, modern, sunny and has a full service bar. It gets quite busy at lunch but it always accommodated our lunch groups from 3 to 12 people. They have great service with a friendly staff.\n\nAlthough Thai food is pretty much the same anywhere you go, I would say that Basil is a notch above the rest. They offer unique dishes you can't get anywhere else like the vegetarian Turnip Cake dish (in the noodle section of the menu.) I also had a vegetarian salad there I've never had anywhere else (I wish I could remember what it was called.) It had thin, clear, extra-wide noodles and was seasoned like a Thai shrimp salad with lime juice, chili, fish sauce and tamarind. I loved their Basil Eggplant dish, definitely one of the best in the city. Their appetizer menu is quite extensive.\n\nThey also offer great desserts. Their Mango with Sticky Rice is to-die-for!

We also split the chicken satay, and it was incredibly juicy and flavorful!  What a delight!!!!  Actually, I can't say enough about the satay, and even after filling my stomach to maximum capacity, I was still covering spoonfuls of rice with the DELICIOUS satay sauce, in an attempt to rupture my most precious organ.

I ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup and the Basil's Eggplant.\n\nThe soup was just ok. I've had better Tom Ka Gai at other places. This soup was a little bit more sour than I'm used to. The chicken in it was all very dry white meat. The mushroom portions in the soup however, were very generous and delicious. I wish they added more to the soup  besides chicken and mushrooms. Perhaps bamboo shoots or something else for some extra texture.\n\nThe Basil's Eggplant was very good. It was a really good blending of tastes. All of the food was cooked perfectly, especially their eggplant which tends to be mushy when overcooked.

We started with Thai spiced fishcakes and yard long beans served with cucumber relish.  I couldn't find the yard long beans in the dish (no, not because I didn't have my glasses), but it didn't matter because it was delicious.  The fish cakes had a slightly nutty, smoky taste that was offset by the sweet/sour and aromatic cucumber relish.  We also had crispy spring rolls stuffed with vermicelli and cabbage and wood ear mushrooms.  These fell into the \"darned good\" category by comparison to the fishcakes.\n\nWe ordered two entrees: ginger chicken: lightly breaded julienne chicken, cashew nuts, & celery with caramelized ginger sauce; and pad talay (shrimp, calamari and salmon stir-fried with chili, onions, zucchini and basil.  The ginger chicken just shone for me.  There was a great balance of sweet and aromatic flavors (the ginger having a foot in both camps) and the intensified nuttiness of the sauteed cashew nuts were great.  The pad talay paled by comparison, but the seafood was tender and the sauce had an inviting smoky flavor.  \n\nWe drank a Folonari Pinot Grigio ('04 I think) and it was crisp, without any sharp edges - just slightly fruity and warm as a second impression.\n\nTM declared it, \"...the best Thai restaurant...\" at which he'd ever eaten.

The very nice surprise is that the food wasn't bad - and not \"wasn't bad\" in a \"my drinks were yummy and strong and I could've eaten a Power Bar and given it 4 stars\" but solidly good. My friend sprang the fact that she was a vegetarian and only eating 1500 calories a day on me when I picked her up at the airport which had me frantically scrambling for something we could both eat. So when I saw Thai food and decent drinks in the same review, I was hooked. \n\nHave to say, for a meat eater from Texas the vegetarian based night out was not as soul crushing as I would have thought. Arrived starving and I promptly finished the entire basket of shrimp chips by myself (1500 calorie restriction for my friend, you know. Score one for me!) We started out with the porpia sod (basically tofu spring rolls) which had a nice spicy chile flavored dipping sauce. We shared the Monks Delight (tofu, oyster mushrooms and green onions) and one of the green curries (kang talay - apparently my friend is only a \"land vegetarian\". Whatevs). Both were really good, and I liked the fact that the green curry didn't taste as heavy and oily as some other curries I've had in the past. Can't remember the names of the drinks we had but I think we tried almost all of the specialty cocktails and they were all very good. The Saketini was my fave.\n\nAnd love the ease of parking.

Pieces are fatty but the curry sauce is still delicious, especially drenching rice.\n- Pla Dook Pad Pik (crispy catfish filet kaffir red curry paste): Wow, this was a great dish! the fish was really tender, and it was encrusted w/ the red curry paste which added a kick and just tremendous flavor to the palate. \n- Nuer Ta Cai (beef cubes w/ lemongrass): this was super tender melt in your mouth beef. Man, just writing about them makes my mouth water.\n\nThere was also a lamb dish (which I avoided) and maybe another curry. But honestly by the 10th plate, you start forgetting what you ate.

Basil Thai had the most reviews behind Osha Thai which made it a no-brainer. And Yelp did not let me down.\n\nBasil Thai's interior is classy, but comfortable. The menu is large and requires some perusing. The table had the Indian bread with green curry as an appetizer followed by the veggies and green curry dish, pad thai and a dish containing bamboo shoots, asparagus spears and mushrooms.  Each dish deserves a solid 4 on the Yelping scale. If I lived in SOMA, I would be eating at Basil Thai all the time,", "author": "Charles B."}

Everything we had there was tasty and flavorful, although the portions were a bit smaller than you would get at other Thai restaurants.  Be prepared to order more or eat less - the choice is yours!\n\nWe had deep fried corn patties (excellent), roti bread (oily, but still good) and beef cubes in two different sauces, green curry and lemongrass (both very good, very juicy and very tender).  All this delicious goodness, plus some steamed rice, one Thai iced coffee and one Thai iced tea cost us about $58 .  \n\nThe service was fine, too.  No complaints there.  Good food, but -1 star for small portions and high prices.  Koh Samui & The Monkey or Manora Thai give you a lot more food for less money.

It just so happens that we picked the best wine in the house for these dishes: a Ravenswood 2003 Shiraz from South Eastern Australia.   It was surprisingly one of the best pairings we have managed all year--- strange because this wine is not well-received by critics.   Whenever grapes leave their home and start traveling halfway around the globe for processing (for instance, to California), wine critics do nothing more than take a swig of the yield and spit it out. \r\n\r\nThe waitress was cute and humble, and she was all the more clever.  While we were enjoying our appetizer, she delivered the prawn delight and so gracefully verified with my friend that he wanted red curry with his lamb dish.  It came out four minutes later, most likely because they botched the original order. Oops!   We gave her a generous tip just for her sneaky finesse!   As we left, we realized that the owners, the chefs, and the staff choreographed a total experience, so we concurred that this was now one of the best Thai restaurants in the city.", "author": "Daniel C."}

I'll let my actions speak for me - the food here is so good, I'm willing to pay the ridiculous delivery charge for waiters on wheels just to get the Basil Pad Thai.\n\nBut if you want to save yourself the ten or fifteen bucks that WoW charges, head on out to Basil - it's \"in the middle of nowhere\" even for SoMa - the closest landmark I can think of is 1015 Folsom.  Order yourself the duck curry - make sure you spoon lots of the sauce over your rice.  The scallops with tempuura green beans is excellent, served super fresh and covered with a light but tangy sauce that really brings out the scallop flavor.  Even though some of my friends don't eat eggplant, they couldn't shun the eggplant and chicken curry.  And lastly, the Pad Thai...seriously, the best Pad Thai in the Bay Area.  Perfectly cooked noodles, just the right amount of tang, jumbo prawns, tofu, crushed peanuts...if any of you know of a place with better Pad Thai, let me know, and I'll try it out.\n\nThanks to Michael K for tuning me in to this place.", "author": "brian w."}

The \"Beans + Roots\" appetizer, with its crispy tofu and toro pieces was toothsome, if a bit bland.  The \"Crunchy Bean Cakes\" entree was the star performer of the night, with a pungent, spicy sauce and good consistency.  \n\nHowever, It's tough for me to get excited about my 8402nd Thai dinner in SF unless the food's amazing or a bargain, especially since I cook insane Thai food regularly (and dirt-cheaply).

Mainly pricing and the ubiquity of equivalent restaurants.  Also, I have to ding the place for naming itself after a freaking ingredient.  If I see one more goddamn place called something like \"Lemongrass\", \"Ponzu\" or \"Yak Snout\", I am going to SCREAM!  \n\nMy future restaurant will probably be called something like \"BLORNK\" or \"Hi-Colonik\", in protest.\n\nFeel free to visit Basil if you need servicable Thai food and are willing to pay a premium for an airy, tastefully appointed atmosphere.  Just don't expect any culinary miracles.\n\n---\n\n* If I owned a Thai restaurant, every table would have a condiment tray with fish sauce, rice vinegar, Sambal Oolek and a pepper grinder, at least.

I used to live around the corner and I would call to order takeout at least once a week on my walk home from the Caltrain station.\n\nI love taking my friends here because the inside is very classy and has a lounge feel that makes it seem a lot nicer than the average hole-in-the-wall Thai place, but food-wise, it has just as much flavor and tastiness as less-swankily-dressed Thai places.\n\nMust try:\n\n- The fresh spring rolls, served with a tangy peanut sauce\n- The crispy spring rolls are also delicious\n- The param rongsong, which is a wonderful marinated strip steak topped with cocount peanut sauce\n- Excellent pad thai (and I'm really picky about pad thai!)\n- The fire calamari -- a fresh calamari wok-sauteed with bamboo and lemongrass and chili sauce. Made me remember how tasty calamari can be even when it *isn't* deep-fried.\n- The bar makes a mean mojito, which would cause me to sometimes avoid calling in advance so that I could enjoy one while waiting for my takeout\n\nThe people there are also ultra-nice. They remember who their frequent customers are and are always extra friendly. I haven't once had a bad experience, and the service is quick!\n\nOh, and on a side note, Lisa W, seriously -- don't pick on Basil Thai just because you didn't realize that having spicy food immediately followed by swing dancing is a horrible idea. Next time, enjoy one of Basil's very delicious milder dishes, like the yellow curry. :)", "author": "Steven P."}

Well we came on a monday night and it was packed mostly by yelp elites form the bar next door. They took about 15 minutes to even take our order and I was starving. We got 2 flat noodle dishes, the fried turnip cake (This is not a noodle or a rice, why is it under that category?), roast duck curry, and garlic noodles. The turnip and roast duck was really good. Garlic noodles not enough garlic, and then the flat noodles, umm it was not flat noodles. We were in starvation mode and started eating after waiting another 30minutes for food to come out. Then I realized hey that's not flat noodles! We asked the waiter he said oh they ran out so you get that. Umm...if they ran out they should tell their customers and give them the option to change the order, correct?..Then to add insult to injury he said I can get you something else so we decided to get another turnip cake. Maybe we misheard but we heard him say sorry I'll take off the 2 flat noodles and charge for the turnip so he took the flat noodles away. We get the bill, they charged us for the 2 flat noodles!! Then he argues with us saying he can't remove it so we have to pay for it and he won't charge us for the turnip cake. Umm if that's the case why did you take away the food we will have to pay for? Makes NO sense! Then miracle he is able to remove the 2 incorrect orders and charged us for the turnip cake replacement order. I've never had such poor service in a long time!

Very rare in SF but we found parking right away and close by to the restaurant. The interior is very modern chic with large paper lantern bulbs over the bar area and soft blue lighting on the walls near the tables. Seating are booths or dark wooden tables and chairs. We were seated right away near the back of the restaurant near the bathrooms. Our waitress was very friendly! We decided to try an appetizer and ordered Porpia Sod which are rice paper spring rolls filled with vegetables, vermicelli, tofu and crushed peanuts on top. A chili and lime dipping sauce comes on the side. Very fresh and yummy! I loved them! For dinner I had the Kang Kari Gai which is yellow curry with chicken and potatos. Ok, I love curry so I have ordered it at so many places and never have I been served 2 breasts of chicken, uncut, on the plate surrounded by the curry sauce and 2 pieces of potato. I was alittle annoyed because I like my meat already cut for me. Call me a princess but I hate having to put the whole breast on my plate and start carving it off the bone. Thank gosh it was very tender so it was easy to come off the bone. But what also annoyed me was the lack of potatos. I love love love potatos. Why only give me two pieces!?!? That is a carb lover nightmare! Other than that, the meal did taste delicious and the chicken meat was vry tender. You have to order rice separate but you can choose white, sticky, jasmine, or fried rice.  I ordered a glass of wine with my meal and chose the Grans-Fassian Reisling because I love sweet wines. Highly recommend! I had two glasses because I couldn't get enough of it! Will I return again? Maybe but to try something else because I wasn't completely thrilled with the curry. \n\nOn a side note, they need to work on getting soup containers for take out orders of curry or anything with a soupy texture. What they did with my leftovers was put it in one of those fold-up cardboard boxes. While driving home, the curry leaked right through the box and through the paper bag it was sitting in onto my lap. I was pissed because I had to sit in a car from SF to the East Bay reaking of spilt curry all over my lap.

I've been to plenty of Thai places, and I just don't see how some of them get away with charging $12 or more for yellow curry chicken!\n\nBasil Thai serves a wide variety of flavors and dishes, even though they don't force you to read a novel to choose your meal.  While there are some dishes I like better than others (the stuffed eggplant is to die for), I've never been unhappy with anything I've ordered.  After trying nearly everything on the menu, I think that is a pretty neat accomplishment on their part.\n\nThe drink menu is quite excellent for a Thai restaurant.  They have wines, beers, specialty cocktails, and a full bar.  Gone are the days when you have the choice between only Thai iced tea and Singha.\n\nAnd for the crowning achievement, you can order sticky rice with your meal.

I've always been able to easily get tables for 6 at this place AND WERE NOT CRAMPED like most other thai places. \n\nThis place has killer curries and you will find yourself looking for more rice to soak up the last drops of curry sauce as the waiter trys to take the plates from the table - if you're not a Thai curry fan you will be when you walk out of this place.\n\nFor starters I like the fresh and crispy rolls as well as the green curry with eggplant and Indian bread (probably because I can soak up the curry with the bread).  Most all the skewers are good and the chicken usually goes fast. \n\nOn main plates you can be safe and go with the Pad Thai or other noodle dishes that you're used to ordering at the run-of-the mill Thai restaurants. But at Basil Thai you should try out a curry dish.  The curry peppercorn duck is excellent and one of my favorites.

We've been living in Oregon and Washington for a long time -- most recently in the Seattle area (Bainbridge Island, to be exact), so we'd gotten spoiled with the quality of Thai food. Then... Texas struck. Nearly two years in the Austin area numbed our tastebuds with fried everything and Tex Mex, and offered a very limited selection of Thai restaurants... and most were average at best.\n\nSo moving to the Bay Area gave us some hope that we'd once again find quality Thai food. I found Basil Thai through some friends, and made a reservation for my wife's birthday -- we were seeing a show at the Orpheum later that evening, so its location was really convenient. We showed up a few minutes early, and our table was ready for us. Not too busy, but by the time we left (around 7:30 or so), the place was hopping.\n\nOur usual measuring stick for Thai restaurants is their Tom Ka Gai soup. Yes, the stuff that smells like an old sweatsock but tastes amazing, and Basil's was fantastic. Spicy, rich, and when ladled over a bowl of rice, easily enough to be a meal in itself. The porpia sod appetizers were fresh and tasty, and the entrees were quick to the table, incredibly good, and more than we could eat by this point.\n\nWe hope we can find a good Thai restaurant closer to San Jose for regular dining, but we know Basil Thai is on our list for every trip to the city.", "author": "Scott G."}

I could see that all of the tables around us were being attended to quite actively, and slowly came to the realization that we were basically being avoided.\nFinally, a waitress came up to our table and, after not even saying hello, demanded to know whether we had decided. We politely placed our orders, and then the food started showing up right away, but I noticed that the attitude didn't change. The servers would drop things onto our table or take things away without any acknowledgment, and would turn their backs to us and walk away quickly, like we were lepers or something. Meanwhile, the waiter serving the table next to us was joking with his patrons. The same waiter scowled as he returned our check to us to be signed.\nGo figure, no one ever checked with us to see if we liked our food or needed anything else until it was clear we were done eating and ready for our check. Did they offer dessert? Nope. We didn't even get the upsell.\nAnd how _was_ the food? It was white-people-friendly Thai food. Osha is more authentic than this place. That's not to say that it wasn't edible, but I could easily get better food for a better price and with FAR less attitude than Basil.\nIn summation, to the owners of this restaurant: sounds like you have some servers to fire or some attitudes to set straight. To potential customers (especially for the under-30 set who actually are nice customers who like being treated respectfully), go someplace else, 'cause these guys are absolute jerks.", "author": "Erin P."}

To start off we had the kao pode tod (corn & bean cake fritter) and basil's panstickers.  The panstickers were OK, but the kao pode tod was divine.  I especially loved the tamarind cucumber salad that came with it.  Delish.\n\nFor the main course, we shared the gai ping (I think, it was the bbq half chicken).  That was forgettable.  I don't recommend it, it was a little dry.  we also had the crab fried rice, which was good as well.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the $15 tiny little bottle of Hou Hou Shu (sparkling sake).  Tiny and expensive, yet so damn good.  It was a cross between champagne and sake, but it was sweet.  I could have guzzled down that bottle in like 2.5 seconds.  But at $15 for a small bottle, I don't see myself buying it again there.\n\nI would come back, but I would definitely try something else like the curries or noodles.  The chicken and fried rice didn't do it for me.", "author": "Charlene R."}

We didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away at the corner table, which felt a bit stuck in the corner at first, right up against the wall, but then it didn't matter much after a few minutes. Most of the center and window tables for two had reservation signs on them, which suprised me to see. We ordered the fried egg rolls to share, which had a decent filling, but I wouldn't say they were anything special. My hubby ordered an eggplant curry which was rolled into fancy looking sculptures, surrounded by green curry. He ate it all up in minutes! I had the vegetable green curry, with a side of jasmine rice. This was delicious curry, maybe the best green style I've ever eaten anywhere. The portion was generous too, and I took the rest home for lunch. My hubby also had brown rice, which looked & tasted quite good as well. I had a Thai iced tea, which was sweet and perfectly mixed. The service was very efficient and friendly, but low key too. His water glass was constantly filled up, since my guy drinks like a camel. Haha. \nWe liked the unassuming atmosphere and agreed that dinner was a good value for superior food. We didn't have liquor, and skipped dessert, but the menu looked enticing for that too.

Everything on the Wok section sounded awesome and we definitely want to go back to try more of them.  After much discussion, we settled on the chinese broccoli and house cured pork belly and the pad ke mao with a starter of duck and sweet potato curry puffs.  everything was fantastic.  The curry puffs are fried and we were served 4 pieces with a generous cucumber salad that complemented the puff very well.  They came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which we appreciated as we were starving.  The flavor of the pork belly dish was great and reminded me of my mom's home cooking.  The pork belly itself was crispy and delicious with good meat to fat ration (more meat than fat...for those who like it that way.) and the chinese broccoli was slender and TENDER...(yay rhyming!) unlike many of the kai lan dishes served at dim sum which are often fat and doused with oyster sayce and hard to manage with chopsticks.\n\na warning for those who fear the heat, both our main dishes were served medium spicy as the menu says.  while we enjoy the spicy very much, i could imagine others would be a little taken aback by their BOLDness.  The Pad Ke Mao was what we expected with generous beef slices and a more spicy than sweet flavor...\n\nanyway, trying to keep my reviews short so wrapping up - the place is purdy: an aesthetically pleasing bar and nice rattan seats - very comfy - you can sink into them.  the recessed lighting gives it a romantic feel for an inexpensive restaurant.  I'd say this is a nice date restaurant... not as flashy /clubby as 2nd St Osha but the food is similarly exciting.  I'd like to go back for cocktails and more wok dishes. yum!", "author": "Mel L."}

As Best Man for my friend back in 2002, I was charged with among other things picking a place to eat dinner so that we'd have enough energy for the rest of the night. The only other bachelor party dinner I'd ever attended previously was at Buca di Beppo. Gross. Anyways, for the same money you'd spend at Buca, the food here is so much better! There were 5 of us, and we were able to try a lot of their menu. The stylish and contemporary interior of midnight blue walls, bright yellow columns, chrome wall sconces and enormous flower arrangements combined with floor-to-ceiling glass bricks attract a yuppie Asian crowd. Starters are very sharable. I had my usual tom yum gai of course (no tom ka for me, I don't like coconut milk in my soups, I'm Viet that way!). It was a perfect meal for our bachelor party.", "author": "Hao L."}

They've also got a full bar.\n\nDamn, this place is tasty.  Very comparable, food-wise, to the Valencia St Osha location - higher end Thai food, with comparably (but appropriate) higher prices.  Yes, a curry here is $11-13, but it's shockingly delicious.  The veggie green curry is fantastic - great selection of fresh grilled veggies of all sorts (multiple kinds of mushrooms, eggplant, peppers, etc) in a thick, rich, intensely flavorful curry sauce with the perfect amount of heat.  Curry puff appetizers are fantastic - curried duck (that has just the right amount of curry to enhance the duck, not overpower it) & (a bit of) sweet potato in a fried pocket.  Yum!  Would be flawless if they were just a bit less greasy, but that's a nitpick.\nThai iced tea (a personal favorite) is not the over-sugared beast you often run into; here it actually tastes like it's mostly tea, but with the expected added Thai spices.  And it's huge.\n\nThere are a ton of dishes you'll think sound amazing and want to try (many of which I still haven't gotten to), so do yourself a favor and go with a group so you can get them all.  It's worth returning to.", "author": "Don H."}

We had some pretty good thai iced tea, and the calamari for starters. such a good calamari dipping sauce. mmm. j and i have similar tastes and always end up ordering the same thing half the time. ug. but yes we did this time too and got the stuffed eggplant. it was stuffed with ground chicken and had zucchini. i dont know what they put in that because it was SO FILLING. both of us are healthy eaters and we could barely finish. We didnt even finish the rice. it was GOOD though!  We also brought home a to go of duck for N, because he was sick. I didnt try it (germs) but it looked good.

Each time we've gone, we've always gone away wondering why we don't come back more often.\n\nThey also have a full bar upfront, something of a rarity among Thai restaurants.

Recently I came here with a pretty large party before going to bootiesf, and the food was great and service was prompt. My end of the table shared family style and we ended up getting more food than we could finish. We started off with tom yum soup, which was not too sour but enough so to give the soup a nice tang. The chicken was tender and the veggies mixed in were delicious. For the main courses we ordered panang curry pad see ew, moo yang (grilled pork filet with roasted pineapple in a sweet sauce), and basil's eggplant. My favorite was the eggplant; I absolutely loved the basil-chili sauce and the shitake mushrooms with the eggplant. The roasted pork cutlet was so tender and flavorful and the panang curry tasted like a pretty standard good panang curry (how can you go wrong with panang curry?). The only dish that disappointed me was the pad see ew (minus one star). The noodles tasted a bit overcooked and was something I would have paid much less for at a Cantonese restaurant on Castro St. in Mountain View. The rest of the dishes were great though. My drink was fantastic, although I don't quite remember the name. I think I got a Mango Cosmo - not very strong but very fruity. I wish I could have had a few more of them throughout the meal. Overall, had a great time here and I am drooling just thinking about the eggplant.", "author": "Joyce H."}

Also, my subconscious is not loud , so I doubt they read my mind.\n\nI had 12 one dollar coins in my pocket that day (caltrain's ticket vending machine did that in exchange for a $20 bill). I asked if they would exchange them for paper currency, but the bartender refused - apparently it's against their policy to do that. I still am giving 3 stars, despite that.\n\nVerdict: Food was ok, price didn't match the food, service could've been better. Oh well it's off my list and subconscious", "author": "Vinod S."}

My sis raved beforehand about the slightly spicy crispy catfish filet sauted in kaffir red curry paste and fresh peppercorn and rightly so. It was everything you'd expect from a dish that's expertly pan-fried with not too much batter nor oil. Our noodles were a tad oily, but not rich enough to spoil the savoriness of the catfish.

They had gotten my rice wrong and therefore asked for them to fix it and switch it to brown rice. The girl came with a bowl, threw my fork on the table and then swooped the white rice off of my plate with her hand onto a plate I was using for my pot stickers that I wasn't even done with yet. The arrogance that this was done with was theatrical. Had the food not been excellent and the ambiance delightful (along with the company ;) I would rate this place ONE STAR for the unsanitary handling of my fork and plate.

(the duck inside was good, but, dry).\n\nthe chicken satay was good: large portion, juicy, cooked right, and the peanut sauce was great. you figure though, how bad would a thai restaurant have to be to screw up chicken satay. if i come back i would probably order this again because it real good.\n\nthe stuffed eggplant was mushy (i know that eggplant can become mushy when cooked (read: overcooked)).  on top of the mushyness it was a tad bit slimy (gross). the saving grace was the green curry. that was absolutely delicious and probably would have been delicious on anything.\n\nthe panang short ribs were easily the star of the night: tender, succulent, flavorful and offset perfectly by the crispy veggies in the dish. the short ribs were really well cooked and i just wish there was more in the dish--but then again for 14 bucks it was a reasonable amount.  the panang curry was phenomenal and although i usually enjoy a spicier curry, i think that this played well off the tastes of the beef. definitely a must have for anyone who enjoys short ribs and thai food.\n\nalso. i lied.\n\nthe real star of the show that night was the couple next to us. there was a white gentleman and an asian woman.  it was clear that it was a second date. yelpers- i wish i could share with you the awkwardness that was occurring just two feet from us in better detail than what i am about to describe, but please believe me, it was amazing.\n\nsome key topics of discussion:\n\ngentleman patronizing attempting to 'teach' his date to say the word 'train'. \n\ngentleman: \"you know, i have been thinking about this a lot lately. i just have to say. i really think my mother talks waaaaay to much. i mean seriously. she just doesnt stop talking.\"\n\ngentleman: \"i'm happy that i didnt scare you off with all of the crazy things i was talking about last time.  i though for sure that i would have.\"\n\ngentleman: \"are you uncomfortable--do you want to talk about something more comfortable to you?\"\n\ni honestly thought i was on a tv show and at any moment hidden cameras were going to pop out and the host was going to say, \"you were just on 'sitting next to the most awkward dates everrrrr!!!'.\"  \n\nunfortunately the cameras never came out. to her credit, however, the woman was a real trooper. i would have ended the date about five minutes in. \n\nthanks basil thai for offering such enjoyable people watching.", "author": "Jason B."}

Don't get me wrong--the food was good. I danced in my seat several times. But I really would recommend it not for Thai food specifically, but if you want to go \"out\" to dinner and feel like, or can only agree upon, Thai. It's, like, a solid place for a nice evening out. Not a destination, really. If you're really hankering for Thai, there's cheaper AND better.", "author": "SheRat R."}

This review is specifically for a lunch combo meal I just had: kang kua gai, a tangy red curry of sliced chicken breast and pumpkin, and the tamarind prawns. The prawns were quite disappointing. The tamarind prawns tasted like sweet-n-sour shrimp, only with no sour = way too sweet. I couldn't detect any tamarind flavor at all.\n\nHowever, the pumpkin and chicken red curry was absolutely delicious: mild, flavorful, and inventive. Leftovers were still delicious the next day. The fresh (non-fried) rolls and the fried spring rolls are also delicious. I've also enjoyed the turnip cake on other visits. It reminds of the daikon cake at Tung Kee noodle house in San Jose, only more expensive, but you don't have to drive to San Jose for it.

We sat at the long table in the front. Every dish ordered was fantastic, service was excellent, and they tolerated our rowdy antics. I had the monkfish with noodles which was new for me and tasty. I really liked the beef red curry with ramen-like noodles my friend ordered. It was spciy, flavorful, rich, in short, very delicious. I definitely will go back when I am in the area and the space it inhabits where the Public used to be is awesome--exposed brick, upper level dining area, nice bar for waiting for your table.", "author": "Snora E."}

There is a variety of delicious menu options. I can't wait to go back again so I can try some other things. I'm so happy to have moved to SOMA this month. Basil will be my new hangout. It's very reasonable. When I saw the sign outside and walked up to the door, I thought it was going to be a pricier place.  But, it's actually not. The decor is modern, clean and comfortable--even if you don't happen to sit along the booth wall. Oh, and I forget what beers they had on tap, but I had a Stella. (I'm a draft beer fan over bottled beer any day of the week.)  You will be kicking yourself if you don't check out Basil. It's delicious from all angles. Plus, even the name is cool.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-05", "description": "Basil is yet another \"upscale and trendy\" Thai restaurant in SOMA (others of this caliber include Koh Samui and the Monkey as well as Lingba Lounge). On a Tuesday around 12:30, the place is already quite busy, filled with business-y looking people discussing very important deals over curry and spring rolls. Our friendly hostess seated us at a table in the back and we decided on my two gold standards for assessing the quality of a Thai restaurant: pad see ew and curry- this particular dish being of the pumpkin variety (since I am a die hard fan of anything containing pumpkin). We also shared an order of fresh vegetarian spring rolls as an appetizer. The food arrived quickly at which point the spring rolls quickly disappeared. These fresh tofu, lettuce, mint, and bean thread noodle filled treats are wrapped in rice paper and served with a mildly sweet sauce laced with chopped peanuts- very similar to Vietnamese spring rolls, but without the basil (surprisingly so, according to the restaurant's name). The two other dishes were also quite good, although Hywel pointed out that the pumpkin curry did not have enough pumpkin- and I concur. If the dish advertised as pumpkin curry, one would expect the pumpkin to star- however I was disappointed to find much more chicken and pepper than squash. The red curry coconut sauce however, was delicious. The pad see ew, with chicken, egg, and broccoli passed my pad see ew approval, but I cannot give it as high a rating as the pad see ew at Little Thai, since the noodles were not quite as buttery. Overall though, Basil Thai offers a pleasant and modern thai dining experience, and if you happen to be in the area, I'd recommend paying a visit.", "author": "Kate A."}

About 22 years ago, this place was a run down warehouse which was later taken over by someone who transformed it into an Ital in Restaurant which was actually pretty successful. The closed about 15 years ago and I believe that they were taken over by a couple of other people before it became Basil's. The place looks pretty much the same as it used to with the exception of the bar which used to be a counter where you could watch the cooks make your food as well as the back wall is gone and now they have big black curtains. They also didn't have that wall to the left where it is all wooden with benches. Anyway, enough about that and now on to the food! The food is pretty good although expensive for what you actually get. It isn't in any way Superior over other Thai places that charge less. Now I don't mind paying more for better food, service, etc...unfortunately this place doesn't warrant the prices that they charge. The only reason I would go back is purely for some of the great memories that I had when it used to be Milano Joe's!", "author": "Diane M."}

It didn't put me off my food or anything, but the food itself fell a little flat anyway, so I ended up giving everything away to the other diners. I don't recommend the green papaya salad or the fish cakes (the oil tasted rancid in the papaya dressing, though I was told that it was just the fish flavoring, and the fish cakes were a gummy, chewy texture and there were no yard-long green beans on the plate because they'd been pureed and put in the cakes).

The waiter was not all that helpful for suggestions, but getting us our food and taking our order was done just fine. For the food, we got a soup (don't know the name but had coconut milk in it). Then we had a chicken curry, beef thing and vermicelli with prawns. The food was pretty good For drinks we had the coconut flavoured sake. It was pretty good and unfiltered.
