Made more famous from TV Shows such as Full House. I overheard that the architect lived in the far left home. \n\nI walked from a BART station to City Hall to Alamo Square to The Full House House to Japantown and back to Civic Center BART station. It is possible if you have the time and good health to walk miles. It is a nice walk through Hayes Valley and a bit uphill. I enjoy seeing the other Victorian homes in the neighborhoods. \n\nI am not sure if there is a time of day when tourists will not be in your photos. Maybe a rainy day. Early in the morning may be quieter, but may also be foggy. For picture enthusiasts, consider the lighting. SF is usually foggy. Low light shows more detail. Blue skies are great , but cast shadows on the homes. I bet you can get great sunset photos if you can time it right. I think the best sunsets are September and October. I got great Pier 39 sunsets in Oct before. \n\nThank you city of SF for adding the green grass so people can have a picnic there. There is a playground for the kids. A lot of space on the hill at Alamo Square to relax and enjoy the view.", "author": "Julie S."}

I grew up watching Full House and always dreamed of lying in the park for a picnic enjoying this beautiful view and the lovely and iconic homes that come with it. I couldn't help but skip up the path singing, \"everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there's a heart, a hand to hold on to...\" \n\nThere was a small crowd but since it was only about 9am, it wasn't too bad at all. I was in awe with these homes and this street and got lost in my imagination, wondering what it would be like to grow up here. After getting a look up close, I took a stroll through Alamo Square so I could get an even better view of the Painted Ladies and the beautiful cityscape behind them. To my delight, there was even a coffee truck up at the top of the so I was able to grab a cold brew and sit in the grass and enjoy the view. \n\nIf you're in SF I highly suggest you stop by the Painted Ladies. The nostalgia alone is enough to send your heart to the moon and back. If you didn't grow up watching Full House like I did, then the view is what you're coming for. It really is awesome seeing these colorful homes nestled in a cute neighborhood with the SF skyline behind them. It's pretty special.", "author": "Jayme H."}

This well known landmark near the Alamo Square has it all that many residents and tourists are heading this spot called, the \"Painted Ladies.\" These Victorian and Edwardian styled houses were built between 1849 and 1915 which makes these houses a place called home until the disastrous 1906 earthquake destroyed the portions of the houses; few of them were survived as of today. Finally, in the 1960s, Butch Kardum, a local San Francisco painter and artist had a vision to make these houses a splash of color, and it did successfully to make it more 20th Century pop art material and classic atmosphere combined.\n\nThere's nothing much about the Painted Ladies' houses although it was a magnificent experience to visit there for the very first time while exploring San Francisco on 4/29/2017. The view while walking on the incline hill of Alamo Square is simply breathtaking which you can see tons of skyscraper buildings of the 20th and 21st Centuries especially gorgeous view on Golden Gate Bridge and the 2nd half of San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge combined from sunrise to sunset.\n\nIf you want to explore The Painted Ladies, parking can be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking if it's available. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, The Painted Ladies is the most spectacular and historical landmark place that I've ever discovered and visited for this signature place in San Francisco!

It is actually a term used for \"Victorian and Edwardian houses and buildings that are painted in three or more colors that enhances their architectural details.\"\n\nWe actually just happened to stumble in this area by accident. The first time we passed by these homes were during Super Bowl 50. It had one of the golden number 50 on Alamo Square Park. These commemorative \"50's\" were placed throughout San Francisco during the Super Bowl City promotion and we wanted to take a photo of one. Parking was very limited so we just zipped through this place. One of the best-known groups of \"Painted Ladies\" is the row of Victorian houses at 710-720 Steiner Street, across from the park. The houses, the park... the scene looked so familiar! I wanted to come back to this area and actually stop and take photos. it is probably best known for appearing in the opening montage of the sitcom \"Full House\" you'll recognize this area where you see the Tanner household playing soccer, running uphill, and having a picnic on Alamo Square Park towards the end of the opening theme with the Painted Ladies on the backdrop. The season ran from 1987-1995. I'm sure this block appears many times in media and professional and amateur photographs and are one of San Francisco's most photographed tourist attractions. The Victorian houses are beautiful... so San Francisco. The park was not that well maintained, nevertheless, still attracts many tourists. Pretty cool landmark!\n\nReview #0478", "author": "May A."}

Honestly just think about it for a second, it's not like it's a restaurant...or a business or even something that was built for hundreds upon thousands of people to enjoy as a collective monument. So how do you rate this out of 5? \n\nIt's tough because these houses have become famous world wide for being on one of the most  iconic TV sitcoms ever made so it's a little hard not to have high hopes for when you come check them out. I am going with 4 stars because I expected to be taken back to the days of my childhood, coming home from school to seeing what lessons Danny Tanner would teach Djay, Stephanie and Michelle, What Uncle Jessie's hair looked like and what kind of Trouble uncle Joey would get into but I wasn't...it was more of a \"oh..that's it?\" but all in all it was still cool to be able to say I saw them.\n\n These houses weren't even used for filming, only in the opening credits and the actual house they depict living in isn't any one of these..it's about 20 minutes away..bummer.It seems like a lot of people expect the home owners to make sure the keep-up of them is just as they were during the 90's but seriously...why? It's not like the owners are responsible to keep the masses happy. Also some people think \"poor owners, having to deal with tourists all day everyday\" but c'mon...they knew and and still know what they got themselves into haha. \n\n\nSo...when you're lost out there and you're all alone..or with friends...or a significant other...or, well I think you get the point.

Anyway, they have been around forever. Even though I am from the Bay Area, I had not seen them, when I lived out there, but took me a move to Hawaii and Louisiana to finally make my way out there. They're up on a slanted hill, perfect for photo ops, when the houses are not under construction with scaffolding in front of them. If you are visiting San Francisco for the first time, you'll want to come here to snap a pic, since they are one of the more popular sites to visit in this city (up there with the Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard's crooked street, Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf, etc).

Glad I let the FTR get away.\n\nMy first thought every time I see The Painted Ladies is:  I wonder what it's like to live in a house that is a historic landmark and one of the biggest tourist stops in SF...?  Do you think to yourself that someone is watching you?  Are you in the bathroom realizing that a tourist from half-way across the globe is taking a picture of your home?  Do people ring your doorbell and ask if Uncle Jesse is home?  Is the guy who played Uncle Joey out front trying to cash in on his decades-ago fame?  It makes the mind swim with possible scenarios.\n\nOn the list of \"Things You Have to See When You Visit SF\", The Painted Ladies are pretty high up.  Why it is entirely worth the trip is not because of the houses themselves.  In fact, there are a lot of much cooler houses spread through-out the Western Addition and The Haight.  It is the vista you get while looking at the houses.  Driving by at street-level, you might kinda shrug your shoulders.  Standing across the street and up the hill on Alamo Square, different ball-game.  The houses are framed perfectly by a backdrop of downtown.  The juxtaposition of the old Victorian houses with the 21st Century City in the background is, in itself, a nice reminder of the history and dynamism we are at once surrounded by.  And on a nice day, it's simply a beautiful spot.  Hanging on the hill on the East-side of Alamo Square and looking down over SF is a great way to spend a few hours on the weekend. \n\nI'm still on the look-out for Danny Tanner.  OK...

The park itself was beautiful and was perched on top of a hill with gorgeous views that overlooked the city. If I had had more time, it would have been a nice place to spend an afternoon relaxing or having a picnic. \n\nWe didn't spend too much time in this area and after wandering around the surrounding neighbourhood to check out more unique houses, we caught a bus to our next destination (Haight-Ashbury). \n\nAlthough I enjoyed visiting The Painted Ladies, they were not the most beautiful or most impressive Victorian houses that I discovered during my trip. I walked around a few residential neighbourhoods and found many more unique, historic and gorgeous picturesque homes throughout them (The Castro, Mission District and Haight-Ashbury areas in particular). \n\nIf you are interested in admiring the beautiful colours and intricate architecture of these classic Victorian houses, I recommend exploring off the beaten path and visiting the neighbourhoods, in addition to The Painted Ladies.", "author": "Brittany T."}

The group and i waited in the park til it was the time where the natural lighting shines on each one of the houses. once we got the winner shot, mission was complete. \n\nthe parking here can be hard time find and is very limited since its all street parking only. i mean parking can be a hassle on busy days or weekends since this is an iconic tourist spot where people like coming here to snap a picture for SF memories. \n\nlets see during my relaxing time on the grass, it was very sunny and hot and i was in my shorts and a hat. i felt very relax while i sat their for over an hour waiting for the natural light to shine on each one of the houses. i saw tourists coming here with their tri pod and getting in our way for the photos. haha i just wanted to go over and ask them to move or just pick them up and move them over haha. i also see locals coming here in their bathing suit or shirtless tanning or trying toe ben their tans. i also see some locals bringing their cute dogs to come here and play frisbee with them. so i imagine this park is dog friendly as well. i also seen this guy doing his math homework right in front of the houses, we were amazed how he knew how to choose his spot to do his homework. just a very great place to chill or relax and read a book or even people watch. \n\n1. come here to people watch \n2. come here to play with your pets or dog\n3. come here to relax your mind \n4. come here to snapchat, fb, ig, twitter, or vine\n5. come here to take pictures for memories \n6. come here to tan or even your tan lines\n7. come here picnic and eat your sandwich or salads\n8. come here to meet your friend or love or buddy or whatever maybe even a date \n9. come here to take a walk after your meal \n10. come here just to be cool and explore \n\nhopefully i have pursade you to come check out the scene and the view as well. i bet you won't be disappointed. also vote for my review and have a nice day and thanks for reading. follow me or add me if you haven't because i love to meet new people.", "author": "Alex T."}

What I think makes these houses stand out more than anything is how it manages to gather so many people in a quite part of town. It's just as fun, if not more fun to watch the people watching the house. Where else are you going to see people try to pose like a model on the stairs of a random house? The randomness of the place, how its own reputation manages to bring people here is just impressive. There's no commercialization of these houses. You could literally buy them, but for the everyday person there's no caricature artists or silvery robots dancing nearby, which makes this landmark stand in sharp contrast with much of SF. \n\nI hear it's near some nice restaurants people like to talk about, so if you wanted to create a big contrast between your New American Sunday brunch experience, try going to the house where Full House is set in, the gap doesn't get any bigger.", "author": "Trevor N."}

I actually saw Danny Tanner grabbing the mail upon my visit and the weirdest thing, the Full House theme music was playing. I dont know where it was coming from, a giant speaker up in the sky seemed like. \n\nAnyone at the park a few days ago may have witnessed my Daughter and I taking turns doing the \"jail pose\" catching these wondrous houses and a gorgeous city in the back drop.
