{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-23", "description": "Knowing next to nothing about San Francisco and its dining scene, I think it's safe to say that Prospect is the type of place you'd come to impress a client. It's refined and upscale--very well-run. The folks who work here exude professionalism, the service is top-notch overall. I wouldn't say it has a ton of character as a space, but the food certainly does. I doubt they serve anything here that's close to mediocre, and the creativity in both preparation and presentation are outstanding. Come here for business, perhaps a late-in-the-game date, or if you're me, come with your sister because she's been here four times/it's close to her apartment/she's the one you're coming to see/she already knows what she wants here so don't fight the quirk. Last thing I'll say in the intro: this place is pricey. So if you do take a client here, they better be worth it. \n\nThe bf and I came here--yes, with my sister--on Friday night at around 6:30pm. The space itself is sprawling--sophisticated, minimalist and sleek. And while the restaurant is big, service is prompt. I was worried about feeling neglected (okay I know this not a forum for childhood trauma but whoops here we go) but thankfully we didn't run into that.\n\nMy sister raved about the wine here but the cocktails looked too good to pass up. I opted for the Queen Anne's Revenge (A\u00f1ejo Rum, Averna, Vanilla, Black Walnut Bitters) and the bf for the Pumpkin Smash (Bourbon, Pumpkin Spiced Maple, Lemon). Both were creative, seasonal, well-balanced and seriously delicious. I don't tend to like rum drinks but something about the richness of the vanilla and black walnut bitters made this oh so decadent. And the latter drink? I must find a way to recreate that pumpkin-spiced maple. I tend not to be one of those pumpkin-obsessed fall darlings but in this case, I got to try on that identity for a day. Not hating it.\n\nThe food here is fun, creative and tasty. I noticed and appreciated the risks being taken in the kitchen and the quality did not suffer as a result. The preparations here are elegant and beautiful, almost in that \"too pretty to eat\" category. Food arrangement is all the rage these days, and Prospect nails it. Cooking is an art, and they take that seriously here. Prospect does a great job of using seasonal ingredients in thoughtful ways. Each dish had some familiar elements with some innovative takes on accompanying elements. So don't be fooled by the stripped-down aesthetic of Prospect--the food is bold and impressively so. Eats, below:\n\nStar Route Little Gems Salad w/ Hosui Asian Pears, Garlic Spiced Baby Pecans, Fourme D'Ambert, Brown Butter Vinaigrette: A\nMy sister's favorite salad here, for good reason. In her words: it has a little bit of everything. Crispy, refreshing, all of the elements work well together. Spice, sweetness and crunch from the nuts, complexity and earthiness from the cheese, all goodness. \n\nLobster Boudin Blanc & Caramelized Ib\u00e9rico Pork Belly w/ Jimmy Nardellos, Soft Polenta, Sweet & Sour Onions, Chicharr\u00f3n, Sweet Pepper Jus: A-/A+\nThat rating doesn't make sense, does it? The A- is for the lobster, the A+ for the pork and the rest. Our waitress eloquently explained this preparation beforehand, making it sound far fancier than what it actually is in executed. It's a lobster sausage, plain and simple. Bound in pork casing, I feared this preparation didn't honor all that lobster could be. The flavors were still nice, but lobster isn't meant to be served in this way. The rest of the dish, however, was outstanding. The pork belly was unbelievable, as were all of the accompaniments. Excellent flavor profile, a lot of powerful stuff going on.\n\nSpanish Octopus A La Plancha w/ Roasted Escamillo Peppers, Fingerling Potatoes, Crispy Taro Root, Piment\u00f3n, Squid Ink Vinaigrette: A+\nAnother incredible, creative preparation that was executed flawlessly with bonus points for presentation. The flavors were divine, the octopus was cooked the perfection, and all accompaniments elevated the meat in a thoughtful, sophisticated way. The combination of the pimenton and squid ink was just heavenly. \n\nLiberty Farms Duck Breast w/ Smoked Sunchokes, Huckleberries, Wild Rice Pilaf, Bloomsdale Spinach, Mission Fig Mostarda, Sunchoke Chips: A+\nA gorgeous, fall dish (does San Francisco experience fall? Asking for a weathered New Yorker), creative and delicious. Presentation continued to be stunning and the food itself was just as impressive. Well-cooked duck with fabulous flavors surrounding it. Nice addition of those sunchoke chips for added texture. \n\nSeared Alaskan Halibut w/ Crispy Potato Hash, Butter Roasted King Trumpet Mushrooms, Early Girl Tomato Confit, Tomato Beurre Blanc: A\nAnother dish that came highly recommended by my sister. She's knows how to pick 'em. The fish was cooked beautifully and all accompaniments were powerhouses themselves. The crispy potato hash was essentially a glorified latke, and I was loving every minute of it.", "author": "Molly T."}

The atmosphere is sophisticated and up-scale, the service was attentive and prompt, the cocktails live up to their reputation, the food is tasty, and the deserts are a perfect finishing touch. Though, it's worth noting that the food menu changes daily for freshness, so it's unlikely that many items you may see on Yelp will actually be served during your visit. \n\nWe started off the evening with a Oro Azteca and a Peachy Peacock. The Oro Azteca was the perfect balance of tangy, sour, sweet, and gingery. The ginger candy really is a fun twist. The Peachy Peacock was great as well, and the peach flavors were not at all the overwhelming or too sweet. \n\nAs a starter we ordered the Lobster Sausage with Braised Pork Belly which was the perfect savory way to ramp up my appetite for the main course. The small plate included 2 pieces of lobster sausage, some peppers, a piece of pork belly about the size of a deck of cards, and fried pork skins. We only ordered one starter because we ordered large entrees and wanted desert, though it's worth noting that the starters are on the small side and are only enough for one or two people. \n\nFor the entrees, we ordered the pork chop and the duck. The pork chop, recommended medium rare, was tender and excellently seasoned with sides of quinoa and fruits. The duck was surprisingly tinder as well and very flavorful. I'd try both again! Both dishes were extremely filling and plenty to eat. \n\nFor desert we ordered the chocolate hazelnut tart to share. It was extremely rich and flavorful but not too heavy. The passion fruit jelly was a nice touch to cut the dark chocolate! \n\nOur server, Sophie, was very quick and attentive. She made some great recommendations and kept everything moving smoothly while also training a new person. Great job!", "author": "Julian S."}

A sister restaurant to Boulevard.  We were immediately seated in a comfortable, quiet table in the back of the restaurant.  The ambiance is upscale, with wood finishings, wrought iron chandeliers, very high ceilings and a mix of people dining with friends, lovers and business acquaintances.\n\nOur server was simply 5+.  She knew their daily menu cold, could recommend a great wine pairing and even took one of my dishes back to the kitchen without me asking, because she noticed it was served without one of the accent ingredients!\n\nWe tried a Barrel-aged Negroni (a good start to fall for you off the beaten pathgin drinkers) and the Il Sedano (for die-hard gin lovers that can't let go of summer),   I can 'still' smell the rosemary.\n\nThe menu has modern American cuisine and may seem sparse, but it is unique every day, and we loved our food.  The lobster boudin and pork belly sausages was a terrific plate, and the Hamachi crudo with avocado and lemon cucumber was refreshing (and went well with the Il Sedano!)\n\nWe settled down with a Williamette Valley Yamhill-Carlton AVA (Belle Pente) pinot with our mains. The ricotta dumplings were light and accompanied by tasty farm fresh veggies.  The wild king salmon was cooked perfectly with a very crispy skin and had a nice creme fraiche potato puree. \n\nWe split a 4-piece (two piece would have been fine) peach bourbon ice cream and oatmeal sandwich.\n\nWe were very pleased with Prospect, and will be back!", "author": "Bill H."}

Well, that's exactly what I did the last time I visited Prospect.  My server helped me pick out a tasting menu of three appetizers which left me room for a nice dessert.  The meal included:\n\n(1).  Hamachi crudo with smoked geoduck clam, pickled apple, lemon, cucumber, ground cherries, sorrel and olio verde (4.5/5) - really enjoyed the smoked geoduck claim for the texture. \n\n(2).  Crispy stuffed Maryland soft shell crab with fried green tomatoes, shisito and gypsy peppers, fresh garbanzo beans, salsa verde and pimenton (4/5).\n\n(3).  Artichoke ravioli and shaved summer truffle with Pasilla pasta, crispy artichokes, smoked creme fraiche and sherry beurre fondue (5/5) - lf you are a fan of butter and truffles, this dish is for you!\n\n(4). Dessert was apple strudel with cheddar ice cream and huckleberry compote (4/5) - love the mixture of textures and temperatures here. \n\nAs my non-alcoholic pairing, I had the ginger beer.  Bread and butter was promptly brought to the table. Service was excellent and I really loved the ambiance of this restaurant.  It's a bit on the expensive side - including tax and tip, this was about $125.  It's a really solid four stars from me. I'd recommend this for an elegant dinner in the SF financial district.", "author": "Andrew S."}

And both times I went before were pretty good experiences.\n\nBy suggestion from a friend, I had their Fried Chicken Sandwich and I was impressed!  \n\nFried Chicken Sandwich -- http://bit.ly/2O1pV7U\nIt was a pretty big sandwich, which surprised me because I was expecting something smaller since it's a contemporary restaurant.  The chicken was fried nicely and the breading had a good crunch to it.  The slaw balanced it out nicely too and wasn't too bitter.  Overall I was very satisfied and really stuffed after finishing it.\n\nProspect did not disappoint me with their lunch and I would definitely plan to go back again in the near future.

I was tasked with scheduling a work lunch with the restrictions of needing a last minute, early reservation (11:45) which was easily accessible for the group. I looked on open table and the options were limited but luckily Prospect had room for us.\n\nWhen you walk in the place is nice and open. You can tell that 99% of the clientele are there for business lunches.  The waiter was friendly and they sat us even though our entire party had not arrived. The service was overall good for the rest of the meal but it did take an extremely long time to get the check.\n\nWe started with a couple apps while waiting for the rest of the group:\n\nSpicy Halibut & Octopus Ceviche (Avocado, Chile-Lime Tortilla Chips) $15 -- ceciche is always hit or miss especially in restaurants like this, and this was a hit.  The flavor was great and light and I would recommend this.\n\nHummus (Labneh, Olive Oil Crackers) $11 -- this was also tasty. The flavor was what they usually call 'original' in the grocery store and came in long skinny flat crackers. This was also a small tasty treat that held us over until the group arrived.\n\nAs far as the entrees go everyone spoke highly of their dishes. We had a range of food from the burger and fries ($20.50) and Warm Roasted Chicken Breast Salad  ($19.50) to the Ora King Salmon ($24). \n\nI myself can only speak for the salmon that I ordered which was delicious. The only disappointment for this is that many people at the table ordered the salmon and they were all recognizably different sizes. \n\nI would definitely recommend trying this place out and I will be back if we have another work lunch however I am not sure I would want to come and spend this type of money on lunch I were on my own.", "author": "Danielle B."}

However, this is definitely more of a business dinner spot than a date spot. Will definitely come back here for business dinners though. \n\nWe arrived at 6:35 for a reservation at 6:30 and were seated by 6:40. The service started off pretty good. We got the seared scallops to share. The person I came with got a salad and I got the duck breast. They were wise enough to bring the salad alongside the main dish instead of the appetizer where it's listed (some upscale places still mess this detail up). Seared scallops were pretty good, although I liked the carrots more than the scallops. I was very happy with my duck breast as well. Everything tasted wonderful and complimented the taste well. \n\nThe person I came with did not like the salad much, although I'm not sure why. \n\nWe got the red velvet cheesecake panna cotta and rhubarb crisp for dessert. The waiter took 15 minutes to ask us for what we wanted after giving us the menu. They also got a bit sloppy and spilled some water while filling my glass. This was around 8pm when the service deteriorated a bit. The desserts tasted pretty good. I really liked the strawberry and hibiscus ice cream float that came with the rhubarb crisps (although the red velvet cheesecake was a close contender). We stayed pretty late and were the last ones to leave. They were very accommodating and put no pressure on us to leave. In my mind, this made up for the small slip in service. \n\nOverall, good food and would return.

We had a timing error, so I was able to call the restaurant and change it to the desired time. Thanks for being accommodating!\n\nAs we enter, I'm immediately calmed by the floor to ceiling windows, the cute waiting area up front, the neutral color palette and the happiness of all the staff we encountered. Even the tableware was beautiful.\n\nThe menu looked so delicious - I wanted to try everything! I settled on the Fennel & Mushroom Crusted Pork Tenderloin, and to the laughter of my team, I customized the dish for the first time! Two team members are huge on customizing, so it was my turn to learn the tricks of the trade. Alex, our waiter, was very kind and patient, as I decided to swap out the brussels sprouts with spinach (and to my coworker's curiosity, Alex learned from the kitchen that it was a special type of spinach that had high water retention).\n\nI loved my dish, from the beautiful plating, the unique texture of the sweet potato mash, the pomegranate and hazelnut crunch, and of course the juiciness and soft pork. Some of my coworkers ordered a side of fries, which I got to try. It was not my style: very thick, too much potato, and not enough crunch. Throughout our meal, people kept refilling our waters, never intruding in an awkward way.\n\nOverall, it was a very wonderful experience.\n\nVerdict: would love to come back!", "author": "Catherine W."}

At the peak lunch hour the place was pretty full but we managed to get a table without a reservation. The decor of the place tries to be simple yet elegant but ends up being more simple than elegant, almost to the point of being plain.\n\nAfter being seated we started off with some water and iced tea. The lunch menu seems to have a little bit of everything seafood, salad, steak and pork. I decided to get the Prospect Burger ($14.5) and added fries ($6) and cheese ($2). Our server was an old lady that seemed to be in a bit of a hurry and rushed us along. My bar is very low. As long as there is no attitude I'm fine. We got none so it was fine. My friend ordered the New York Steak ($18.5) but had it customized to such an extent that what came out looked like a glorified salad to me. The good news is that they allow customization's.\n\nThe prospect burger is slightly bigger than the size of a slider. It comes deconstructed i.e. with the pickles, lettuce and tomatoes on the side. The bun was nice and crisp. The meat unfortunately was a letdown. It was dry and overdone (I had asked for medium). The star of the dish was the fries. Thick cut and perfectly fried. They were crispy on the outside while being nice and soft on the inside. Overall the burger was a letdown while the fries were almost perfect.\n\nPrice wise this was one expensive burger. It was definitely not worth the price. I understand that this is a modern upscale place but for $22.50, I expect better. My friend was also not very impressed with his steak but I'll let that pass as he had literally turned it into a salad, so he should not complain. Pricey but not great, that's how I would sum up my lunch experience here. I'm not sure if the dinner service is better but I doubt that I'd be back for lunch.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Don't eat here unless it's going on your expense account. This means it's expensive/overpriced, and it's tame/safe food, in a business-friendly atmosphere. You'll be surrounded by suits and people talking shop. It's a little impersonal and cold, and everything will be fine but not great.\n\nI chose this place for a celebration dinner and really, it's my own fault. Given the location, I should have recognized that it's an Expense Account restaurant. But I really wanted to try a Nancy Oakes restaurant and can hardly afford (or get a table at) Boulevard so this was the next best thing.\n\nAs mentioned above, it's got the standard SOMA/FiDi business decor. Tables weren't super close together so you have some elbow room. The bathroom was amazing! Yeah, I guess that says a lot about the restaurant if the best thing was the bathroom.\n\nThe food was good, but not great. The beet and burrata salad was heavy on the beets, light on the burrata (which was disappointing for me). I had a pasta dish and it was fine. None of the food will knock your socks off, and I don't think it's meant to. Servers were great. I chose the wrong restaurant for a personal celebration dinner but I have only myself to blame.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-04", "description": "Updated Review:\n\nMaintaining my 5-star review of Prospect.  This restaurant is quickly becoming one of our favorites in SF.  The pork chops here are among the best we've had, but they also excel at other dishes and offer superb service.  All this in a classy yet low-key restaurant with big windows and real tall ceilings.  I also love the open, spacious layout of the restaurant.\n\nOn our second visit, we noticed some minor changes in the menu.  Its Italian White Truffle season after all, but still many of the flavors were familiar to us despite minor variations on the side dishes.  Service was still stellar. The waiter, Garret was super knowledgable about the menu, where various ingredients were sourced, and gave great recs.  Our water glasses were never empty and even the manager stopped by to visit.  \n\nThis time we ordered:\n\nGinger King: Scotch and ginger liqueur - good for a cold evening.\n\nMatsutake and Calamari - Excellent appetizer with squid ink pasta. Calamari was tender and texture-wise, paired well with the mushrooms. The \"sauce\" was an interesting mix of lemon butter with bee pollen. (5 stars)\n\nSeared Scallops - Perfectly cooked scallops with a side of parsnip puree and carrots. The oak fritters were interesting, almost like a lighter version of hushpuppies.  An excellent dish, though I somewhat regret not getting the white truffle risotto. (4 stars)\n\nPork Chop - A must-have dish whenever dining at Prospect.  The manager told us that it was brined 48 hrs, cooked sous-vide for a bit, and then finally grilled.  That way, the chop stays incredibly juicy.  There is some pink color, but rest-assured its fully cooked!  This time, they added potatoes and maple sausage as sides along with this mix of horseradish-rapini that sort of elevates the dish to a lighter, juicier version of prime rib, except its pork! (5 stars).  Wine pairing of Pinot Noir from Willamette Valley recommended.\n\nFarrotto - This is a playful hybrid of Farro plus Risotto, and is one of their Vegetarian options.  Lots of flavors here - sweet potato, kale, hazelnut, burgundy truffles, and a poached jidori egg. Rich and likely nutritious too.  A good dish if you don't want to be overloaded on meat. (4 stars)\n\nSticky Toffee - Desserts are awesome here, especially with their sticky toffee cake and (Irish) coffee ice cream. But wait, there's more - almond-quinoa brittle, chocolate-stuffed dates some some poached quince to top it all off (5 stars).  Pair with their house coffee, which is bold and smooth.", "author": "Daniel C."}

I started with a perfect margarita, not too sweet.  It went perfectly with the Spicy Halibut Ceviche, which was so good we had to have a second order of it. There were so many amazing appetizers, we kind of went overboard and had two rounds of starters. I had seen a photo of Squid a la Plancha on IG, that I wanted to try. Fantastic. We also had a flatbread with tomatoes and goat cheese that was delicious. And a Maine Lobster Tagliatelle, with big chunks of lobster, and a wonderful light coating of sauce. \n\nWe probably would have just ordered everything on the appetizer list for our table, but we also wanted to share the New York Steak. They sliced it up for us, and it was the perfect steak dish. Medium rare, perfectly cooked, and the quality of the meat they use shines in this dish. There were all kinds of yummy little sides accompanying the steak: morel mushrooms, peas, crispy potatoes. Lordy, it was so good! \n\nI also want to mention how warm and friendly the staff is. We are always greeted immediately, the wait staff is genuinely hospitable, and can answer all of our many questions about food, wine or cocktails. The service is perfectly timed, not rushed, and the staff seem very happy to be there. I love the balance of excellent, warm service, great food, and stylish atmosphere.

Everyone on the staff -- from Naomi, who managed the event for us, to the servers and, of course, the kitchen and the bar -- delivered an exceptional experience for my colleagues and our clients. I highly recommend the restaurant, and would not hesitate to return with another important group!\n\nExperience as a client\n\nFrom first contact to the farewells at the end of the leisurely dinner, the staff treated all us like VIPs. Naomi responded to my initial inquiry promptly and answered all of the questions I needed answered so I could book and plan the dinner. She laid out my choices clearly and made recommendations where I needed them.\n\nExperience as a guest\n\nThe front of house staff was friendly and was fully prepared to escort our people to our private room. Guests asked for and received drinks quickly, and the servers wit passed appetizers in our reception were never far away. Once we sat down, service was efficient but not rushed, and premium but not stuffy. The whole team showed great hospitality.\n\nThe drinks\n\nNaomi selected three excellent wines to pour at dinner, and many guests chose a cocktail instead. The bar (which I've seen is quite popular) creates some rather delicious cocktails, too. I gravitated toward (and stayed with), the Prospect Smash -- a delightful combination of bourbon, lemon juice, and maple syrup. Folks who wanted to sip something found a wide array of premium spirits available. No one was thirsty.\n\nThe food\n\nThe menu did not disappoint -\u00a0not in choices, nor presentation, nor taste. The bites that we passed as hors d'oeuvres (Naomi's specific recommendations from a longer list, by the way) were perfectly presented and in demand. Prospect offered a \"real\" vegetarian option (rather than something hacked together!) for those who requested. The New York steak that many people ordered looked delicious. My halibut was well prepared and tasty as well. From experience, I know that's particularly challenging to get just right, so hats off to the kitchen on that specifically!\n\nI'm sure I'll be back soon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-15", "description": "TLDR - Classy, modern and elegant. Food and service were impeccable. Perfect for a special occasion.\n\nWhen my friend and I made reservations for Prospect, I definitely wasn't expecting such a classy restaurant. It was recommended to me by a coworker and I figured it would be similar to the ambiance of other nicer, but still casual, restaurants in SF like Park Tavern. Needless to say, I felt a little underdressed when I showed up in a casual top and jeans. \n\nThe restaurant is modern and very spacious in contrast to most SF restaurants where you can hear every word of your neighbor's conversation. Service was outstanding. Our waiter gave us recommendations and detailed descriptions of the popular dishes on the menu; he checked in on us just enough; and our water was never empty.\n\nFood is definitely on the more expensive side here, but worthy of the price given the quality of the food, attentive service and overall ambiance. My friend and I shared the Seared Sea Scallops as an appetizer; I got the Duck Breast & Leg as my entree while my friend got the Alaskan Halibut; and we each got a glass of wine, red for me (the Syrah Blend, $12) to go with my duck, and white for my friend to go with her fish.\n\n* SEARED SEA SCALLOPS ($22) - 5/5\n[smoked oat fritters, carrots, parsnips, dill, cr\u00e8me fraiche)\nPerfectly tender scallops like cut like soft butter, paired with a lovely light, creamy carrot mash. The smoked oat fritters were dense and thick on the inside and crisp and airy on the outside. \n\n* LIBERTY VALLEY DUCK BREAST & LEG ($33) - 4.5/5\n[scallion pancake, huckleberries, brussels sprouts, tokyo turnips, cashews]\nThe duck was served 2 ways - seared breast and confit leg. The breast looked like a medium rare but a little on the tough side. The leg was tender and fatty. I loved the huckleberry sauce and wish there was more of it to pair with the duck and roasted brussels sprouts. I felt like the dish was lacking flavor without it. The scallion pancake was an odd addition, like some sort of attempt to make the dish Asian inspired, but I liked it anyway since I love scallion pancakes and having it in the dish made me realize I hadn't had any in a long time. \n\n* ALASKAN HALIBUT WITH WASHINGTON MUSSELS & RHODE ISLAND SQUID ($36) - 3.5/5\n[roasted kabocha squash, wild rice, wild greens, toasted coconut, thai spiced butternut broth]\nTried some of my friend's halibut and thought it was just okay. The broth was light and the halibut felt a little dry and overcooked.\n\nIf you're looking for a fancier, classier dinner spot, definitely check out Prospect.

I have heard of pumpernickel bread before, but it my first time trying it. It has the consistency of sprouted bread, and the sliced pieces were thick which paired very nicely with the avocado layer. There are times where wheat bread is too thin that the avocado droops and makes the bread soggy. This was not. \n\nThat was the centerpiece. The rest of the platter consisted of roasted baby beets sprinkled with black sesame seeds, smoked salmon, and a soft boiled egg.

The hostess was very friendly and flexible in terms of allowing us to be seated without the entire group being present. By far, the service was the best part of the experience at Prospect--every time I looked at my water glass, it was full!\n\nThe menu for this place reportedly changes very frequently. When I was looking on Yelp for suggestions, there were many variations on the menu items that were not present when I dined there.\n\nWe started with the Squid Ink Chitarra as an appetizer. This was delicious! It was very flavorful and had I believe it came with Chicken. This was my favorite dish of the night.\n\nMy girlfriend and I each got two entrees to share. She ordered the Pyramid Ravioli. This was originally an appetizer portion, but the waitress gave us the option to upgrade the size to an entree which was great. The raviolis were okay. It had a reasonable portion of filling, but the wrapping was slightly drier than we liked. Overall, still a great option though. We also had the Heritage Berkshire Pork Chop. The size of the pork chop was a LOT bigger than I had anticipated. It was cooked well, slightly dry, but a reasonable amount of juiciness and flavor considering the size of the pork chop.\n\nOverall, I would return to Prospect for another dinner with a group of friends. We had a party of 6, but they could easily accommodate more. The service was great, food was good, and the ambiance was fantastic.

The only reason for 3 stars was the dessert, appetizer and the service. If you order the duck, get it medium and not medium rare.", "author": "Emily P."}

We arrived promptly at our reservation time at 6 PM. There was a valet outside the restaurant for a flat $15 rate. The service for the valet was great. Upon entering, the restaurant, we were promptly seated. The restaurant had a very classy and modern appearance/atmosphere.\n\nLet's start off with the service--it was amazing. The wine list is quite extensive, but the waiter was knowledgeable enough to recommend us wines that accompanied our courses well. He also came around multiple times each course to make sure we were enjoying our meal, and our waters were full. Very personable as well.\n\nFor our appetizer, we shared the Dungeness Crab appetizer. The crab pieces were served on top of some avocado salad, with some blood orange slices and vegetables on the side. If you love avocado and crab like me, then you definitely can't go wrong with this one.\n\nFor our main course, we shared the pork chops, and the duck. The pork chops were brined and cooked to a medium. I'm so used to dry over-cooked pork chops, that I was surprised when they were recommended here. But, I've never had pork chops so tender and flavorful--it was almost like eating a tender steak. The sauce and sides the pork chops came with complimented them very well. The duck was also served medium, which was also unusual to me. But like the pork chops, it was another great dish. The duck was served on a long ravioli filled with more duck meat (I believe?) and some seasonal vegetables. \n\nFor dessert, we shared some dessert wines that the waiter recommended as well the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Overall the meal was quite the experience, and I would definitely want to come back to try some more of their menu.", "author": "Chris H."}

I highly recommend ordering this. I don't understand the purpose of the foam on this dish though. Our entree highlight was the grilled goat chop, recommended by our server, which was superb--luscious and flavorful.\n\nThe other delicious dishes that we ordered, the seared scallops paella and roasted Alaskan halibut were well prepared.

We have had lunch and dinner here, but what we really love is grabbing a table in the bar and noshing away.\n\nUpdate: We live two blocks away from Prospect, and recently our building was without power for four days. We needed somewhere to recharge; not only our spirits with great food and hospitality but all the electronics that we depend on in this modern age of connectiveness. The Prospect staff was eager to help, seating us at a corner table with a plug, and allowing us to keep their table for several hours during a rather busy lunch service while we had a power strip and seven devices plugged in to recharge. Granted, we ate and drank -- a lot, but still...\n\nThe restaurant business is first and foremost hospitality, which simply put is caring about the customer. It goes without saying that Nancy Oaks and her team put out great food. But the service and care that they put forth is second to none!!!", "author": "John C."}

Good atmosphere for a \"power lunch\" or a decadent lunch by yourself at the bar.\n\nJalape\u00f1o Deviled Eggs: The crispy prosciutto really set them apart from your typical family picnic deviled eggs.  A very thin and crispy texture. Plus a burst of porky goodness. The thinly sliced jalape\u00f1os were too small to give it much kick though. The egg itself was on point in terms of creamy filling.\n\nFried Chicken Sandwich: A thin chicken cutlet with a generous layer of crispy batter. The bread was soft and chewy like a hoagie roll, which is a good contrast to the fried chicken. I liked that it was pre-seasoned with hot sauce for a pleasant zing. The side of potato salad was a bit meh though; it was like typical family picnic quality.\n\nBaked Alaska: A very fluffy fresh meringue that was seared all over. The ice cream was firm, though not too firm. The seasonal flavor was white chocolate and pomegranate, which was decent but not a home run. The hard baked meringue candies made for an off putting texture, like so hard you wondered if you might crack a tooth. The fluffy cake bits were nice though.", "author": "Adam B."}

Chips were crunchy and the artichoke dip was smooth.\n\nI didn't know what to expect from my Fried Chicken Sandwich but it was huge! I expected something like the burger, small and delicate. Biting into the sandwich, the chicken was crunchy and the seasoning was savory. The aioli sauce was heavenly. Made the overall sandwich taste so much better. It also came with potato salad.

As of 830pm, there was no cocktail order in sight and we could not get our waitress's attention.  Eventually we were served our drinks with an explanation that \"the bar is very busy\".  Since the drinks with ice cubes were almost melted, we suspect they were sitting on the bar for 20-30 minutes waiting to be picked up.  \n\nAfter appetizers while waiting for our main course, our waitress came by and caught the signal from one of our party that he would like a beer. She immediately spun around and seemingly ignored two others that were signaling their interest in another drink. About five minutes after our mains, she did come back for second drink orders. In good restaurants this typically happens before mains are served so that guests can have their wine/drink with their main. Apparently not here. \n\nMy wife asked our waitress about several different red wines and wanted to know which one was bold, fruit forward. Our waitress indicated that those would not be quite as food friendly or appropriate and suggested something milder; she was very pretentious in suggesting my wife didn't know about wines and needed someone to set her straight.\n\nIn fairness to our waitress, she was handling a large number of tables.

I tried a few, they were good with a mashed potato like middle and a crispy outer texture. \n\n5 stars - Herb roasted chicken salad. I had this without the roasted chicken on top. So admittedly, it didn't look like much when it came to the table. Like a bowl of kale and a layer of brown rice, with a side sweeping of hummus. It's the type of meal you would see someone else get and think...oh man, how are they going to be satisfied with that sad looking dish?? Well, don't judge by looks alone, because this was the BEST bowl of salad I have had this year. These ingredients really sung to my tastebuds: Warm Wheat Berry, Brown Rice & Cauliflower Salad, Lentil Hummus, Lacinato Kale, Chicken Jus & Fennel Pollen Vinaigrette, and Pumpkin Seeds. \n\n4 stars - Arnold Palmer with iced tea and a passion fruit lemonade. Pretty good! Put passion fruit in any drink and I will order it, so I'm probably a little biased. Not quite a five because it was a little tart.

Service was outstanding.\n\n-Birthday dinner with two friends. The personalized menu was a sweet touch. Two halibut dishes and one sea scallop dish. The halibut had kumquats and king oyster mushrooms. We shared a bottle of champagne and a bottle of wine. We all had fabulous deserts as well. Great service.  We were in heaven.\n\n-Another birthday dinner (mine this time, and another friend's) with a third friend. For some reason it wasn't the best...I think it was the crowd.  We may have felt slightly rushed, the service wasn't as good. I don't remember the entrees or deserts we had. \n\nI would still go back!  Maybe for brunch or lunch next time.", "author": "Faith F."}

I ate here a couple of months ago with some co-workers.\n\nThe restaurant is a good size. It is exceptionally bright inside and the dining room is decorated nicely. The bar has a cozy feel to it.\n\nSince California is experiencing a drought they won't serve you water unless you request it.\n\nIt took a little bit for the waitress to come by. I had a pisco sour to drink and the rest of the group had wine and beer.\n\nI ordered the wagyu carpaccio sweetbreads to start with and the NY strip steak for my entree. The rest of the group went with cod and other seafood dishes.\n\nWhen the sweetbreads were put down in front of me I was enamored by the dish's beauty. I dug right in as I didn't want to waste any time. The egg was poached perfectly and the wagyu was in thin strips. The sweetbreads was charred and fried nicely. I can't remember the sauce that accompanied the dish bit it was fantastic and added an extra layer of wonderful flavor. I was in heaven with each bite that I took. It's funny because my experience with sweetbreads was always a nibble here and there when someone else would order it. The sweetbreads here changed me. I can't believe I have been missing out on this for so long. Alright the tangent is over.\n\nMy NY strip was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Unfortunately I did not enjoy the steak. It was quite bland and lacked seasoning. I ended up only eating half of it. Damn by that point I wish I had another order of sweetbreads. The potatoes that also came with the steak were just OK. \n\nEveryone else enjoyed their meals and were raving about them.\n\nThe only aspect that was disappointing was the waitress. I wish I could remember her name. She wasn't friendly and had zero personality. It's a shame because if she was I would most likely be rating this a five instead of a four.", "author": "Will G."}

Got a last-minute reservation with four friends. We had sort of forgotten what it was like to sit through a two-hour meal without our kids.\n\nThe food was excellent, especially the soft-shelled crab and tomato appetizer. Really enjoyed the monkfish as well, and my wife's hanger steak was tasty. All of their entrees come with a few bites of several different sides. Finished off the meal with some rather large desserts, including an ice cream sundae and a chocolate tart. \n\nIt's quite a large restaurant with nice natural lighting before it gets dark (as evidenced by my photos). Our server was really friendly and unpretentious; she was proactive about explaining some of the more obscure items on the menu.\n\nIt's close to the water, so we wandered through the ferry building both before and after our meal here. Definitely good for working off the large (for a nice restaurant) portions.", "author": "Wing Y."}

We live close by so we decided to give this place a go. There were no reservations available online but when we called them they were able to accommodate us (6 Pm). \n\nAs we were about to be seated, I asked the hostess about their happy hour menu and she said stated that there MIGHT be some drinks options and POSSIBLY some food options. Sorry, that's like saying we might serve food at brunch!\n\nMy husband has a gluten allergy so our server for food options. Unfortunately, he was unable to identify many options even despite stating there were plenty. \n\nWe asked about the scallops and he confirmed they were fine so placed an order; only to find out that it wasn't an option because the farro had some flour. My husband got creative and asked if the farro could be placed on the side and the server acted like such a request was novel approach. We are restaurant junkies and it amazes me how some servers can not simply adjust the menu by deleting one item off the dish or putting it on the side to avoid an allergy. \n\nFoods: \n\nScallops and octopus: fabulous. I will for sure return to try this dish again. The burnt oranges on the dish were amazing. The scallops were cooked to perfection. A bit spicy but amazing. \n\nTruffle burata risotto: great! We both loved it. Very creamy and simply delicious. \n\nKing salmon: it is wild caught (very important) and it's cooked to perfection (on the rare to medium side). The side vegetables are very tasty. \n\nConclusion: \n\nFood: great! \nService: Poor!", "author": "Ghazal P."}

So for folks like me that work late and solo, then we can chill out.  I will say I didn't feel welcome though when I sat down.  Bartender clearly saw me, made eye contact, but he was more interested in finishing conversation with another patron.  I respected that but even after that patron left, he took his time, went through his receipts before coming even to ask me what I wanted.  Nevertheless the wine I picked myself no help from him was the Beaujolais which was very good.  He was nice enough to bring me the bottle b/c he didn't know the answer to my question.\n\nFood-wise I only had the foie gras.  The brioche was more like a crouton, poorly paired.  The foie gras looked perfectly seared but was almost raw inside and cold.  Totally disappointed at my first return to this fav delicacy.\n\nI give kudos for the ambiance, the nice 2nd bartender whom actually paid mind to the patrons sitting around the bar, and the wine.  Everything else was disappointing so I didn't feel the urge to order anything else.\n\nWhen I left I asked the girl also by herself but being given what should've been the same courtesy to everyone at the bar.  Even she noticed the the disparity. She said she was not a food critic but understood what I did when I nicely said the attention they gave her should have at least partially been the same with everyone else.\n\nI honestly was there to chill after working a long and late day.  Had I been w friends, I definitely would not have only observed but said a couple of choice words as if I was back in NY.   Needless to say felt no guilt at the 10% tip.  Sad b/c I really hoped this was my spot after work to unwind and not feel like a workaholic lonely bum.\n\nAll in all 60 bucks for 2 glasses of wine, 1st pour by Scrooge 2nd was fair guy.  The worst was the $30 for a poorly cooked foie gras on top of a tasteless slab of brioche more like stale croutons.  Shame of it all.", "author": "Fong L."}

I read that they had over 275 different bottles on the menu, so I knew I was making a solid decision. We made a 7:30pm reservation and arrived a bit early so they told us to hang out at the bar for a bit. We snagged two seats at the beautiful 'square shaped' bar and ordered two yummy seasonal cocktails. I ended up not liking mine, so I went with a Pisco Sour instead but the cocktail list had some great options! At 7:30pm they came and sat us down. I loved the ambiance and the decor, the ceiling to floor windows, the high ceilings, very upscale/trendy crowd, my type of place. The menu was fairly limited but had some exceptional options. To be totally frank, I didn't even know what half of the ingredients were in some of the options listed. We started off with the main lobster which was to die for! A unique combination of flavors that exploded in your mouth. The Caramelized Sunchoke Agnolotti with the lobster and the sunflower seeds on top, wow, took my breath away. When the Somm came over I told him what we had ordered and asked him for a wine recommendation around $60, he was excellent and certainly hit the nail on the head. We had a beautiful wine French (similar to a Sancerre). Excellent wine menu. We had ordered the gnocchi too, but they totally forgot it and ended up bringing out entrees first. No biggie. I ordered their vegetarian option, \"Herb Roasted King Trumpet Mushrooms\". OMG, the flavor combination with the squash, mushrooms, quinoa, and the egg on top. I can't even describe it in words. Then heriloom carrot and potato gnocchi came soon after our entrees and was fabulous. I have never seen orange gnocchi before, and the combination of toasted walnuts, a cinnamon like taste with mint, and fried feta, honestly, I have never tasted anything like it! \n\nAll and I, I'm surprised this place isn't Michelin rated. It was outstanding! Thanks cab driver!", "author": "Shannon W."}

Theres valet outside but pretty easy to find parking in the evening. My friend John is a chef here and he really took good care of us. Hi John!!! The manager came out to say hi to us too at the end to thank us, he was so sweet :) We had so much food, and everything was prepared to perfection. Bread is from Acme and we were constantly offered more, and our water glasses were refilled all thru out our dinner. Our server was so friendly and sweet :)\n\nWe started with a dozen raw oysters and the tuna tartare as appetizers, the tartare was the best thing i had in a while. It was mind blowing. :O :O :O the sauces were so tasty, even a little tiny dollop adds so much flavor. We also got the grilled cauliflower and romanesco salad to share, its a tiny portion but so colorful and pretty, and the cauliflower croquettes were so light and delightful :) Entree we got the Kobe Beef Bavette. That beef was cooked to perfection, it was SO GOOD. So was everything else on the plate. That plate actually was a really generous portion. \n\nFor desserts, we tried the peanut butter and chocolate cake with vanilla huckleberry ice cream as well as the rhubarb buttermilk tart with brown butter ice cream. Both were divine! Our server also gave us a couple caramel candies to end our meal with. It really was an amazing meal and i cant rave enoguh about Prospect.

It also ended up costing around $10 less than the foie gras would have, so we were happy \n+/- Kobe Beef Tartare: Bf thought it was better than I did, probably not that big of a fan of tartare but I felt like it lacked in taste just a little bit! \n\n-- Entree(s?) --\n+ Liberty Valley Duck Breast & Truffle Sausage: We mentioned that we were sharing the entree when we ordered, so they split it into 2 portions for us without us even asking, which was really nice of them to do.

Our drinks were great, the food was mostly great (shared the scallops, carpaccio, beet salad, halibut and NY steak), the ambiance was nice, but our server single handedly took away from all of the above. She was short with us/not very friendly, we felt rushed, waited on drinks too long, and just looked like she would have rather been anywhere else except serving our table. The bussers and food runners really picked up the slack and were very knowledgeable of the menu and provided great service. \n\nAs for the food:\n-the beet salad was great, there were just hardly any beets in it.\n-the scallops were delicious.\n-the carpaccio was good, but the fried calamari may have made it a little too heavy.\n-the halibut dish was amazing with the gooseberries and sunchokes.\n-my BF's steak was order medium, but came out closer to well done (we felt like we would have really pissed off our server if we had asked to have it remade to how it was ordered).\n-shared the butterscotch tart and that was delicious, but the crust was too hard to break with just a spoon/fork. Almost needed a knife for it.\n\nAfter spending $300+ on our meal, it certainly didn't feel like we got our money's worth.

This restaurant has longed been on my list to try by I finally got a chance to try it now.\n\nDRINKS: \n\nSpicy Margarita (off the menu) - It was SPICY and just what I needed.\n\nWines by the glass are very reasonably priced.\n\nSTARTERS:\n\nBaby Beets, Peach Farm Figs & House Cured Duck Prosciutto - Fresh beets with light flavors of manchego cheese sprinkled on top. The one thing that made the plate was the pistachio brittle. I am used to a fig, beets and prosciutto combination but the brittle added a nice sweet flavor and texture to balance the salt of the prosciutto. \n\nMonterey Calamari & Potato Ravioli Nero- Slightly sweet but perfectly flavored calamari. The Ravioli  added a nice touch to the dish.\n\nSeared Sea Scallops- Perfectly seared and salted scallops. The citrus from the vinaigrette complimented the ssubtleness of the thai curry broth.\n\nPoached Local Petrale Sole- great piece of fish. They couldn't have cooked sole any better. Wasn't chewy and tough as most places and the flavor was on point.\n\nCrispy Skin Local King Salmon (Wild) -  Probably one of the best cooked piece of Salmon I've ever eaten. That's saying a lot since I don't order fish very often at restaurants because most of them cook it wrong. I could eat this dish over and over again. You can taste ever flavor of the fish without any of the fishy smell.\n\nSnake River Farms Kobe Bavette \"au Poivre\"- Just a good piece of meat cooked medium rare.

It was quite busy that night so I had to search for the waiter a couple of times to get a drink order or to order my dessert. Wait staff was really friendly and helpful.

This is my first time here, but for some of my other friends, they've been here. First, love the ambiance and classiness of this restaurant. Yes, you can have a drink at the bar whie you wait for your other friends to arrive. I started with the Pisco Fresca. It was so refreshing. The food and service was amazing. For dinner, I had that beef tartare and ribeye. Beautiful colors, plating, and good food. I got to try some of my friend's plates as well. I'm happy that they gave me a little tasting. The lamb was excellently flavored. The scallops just melted in my mouth. The duck - 2 ways was so delicious as well. Excellent flavors with the red wine that we ordered. We also had desserts.

I had a class of Sancerre ($14), recommended by the waiter when I asked for dry wine and it was sooo good!

It's hard not to have a great happy hour with their fabulous drinks.\n\nAs you can tell, this is a San Francisco gem with an amazing Happy Hour worth trying.

Having lived in the Bay Area for all of my life (excluding college) and having never heard of Prospect, I wasn't expecting much from this place. I honestly thought that it would be just another expensive but satisfactory restaurant in downtown San Francisco. Wow, I was so wrong.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is really modern, with tall ceilings and glass walls facing the street. Ambiance here is dim and feels a little luxurious while not overly fancy; it's great place for any occasion, whether it be an intimate date or a social get-together with a group of friends.\n\nAPPETIZERS\n- Wagyu Beef Tartare: This was surprisingly different from other tartares I've had before; it kind of reminded me of an ahi tuna poke, except with wagyu beef. Pretty refreshing.\n- Seared Day Boat Sea Scallop: Mmmm the scallops were cooked perfectly--crispy on the top, and soft and tender on the inside--paired with a nice flavorful sauce.\n- Seared Monterey Abalone with Crispy Pig Trotters: I still have no idea what a pig trotter is, and I don't care. This appetizer was my favorite. It comes with this green foamy soapy-looking sauce, which is also a mystery to me, but it pairs very well with the abalone and pig trotter. My only gripe is that it's so good yet the portion is too small to share amongst 4 people!\n\nMAIN ENTREES\nWe ordered the following entrees:\n   - Berkshire Pork Chop\n   - Snake River Farm Kobe Bavette\n   - Liberty Valley Duck & Lightly Smoked Sausage\n   - NY Strip Steak\nAll of the entrees were dressed with various vegetables and sides, and each component of all the dishes was packed with flavor. The stand-outs to me were the kobe bavette (partly because it comes with barley, yum!), and the pork chop, which was surprisingly moist and tender.\n\nDESSERTS\nAt first I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try the ice cream sandwiches mentioned in a lot of Yelp reviews, but I'm so glad we decided to order desserts anyways because we discovered something pretty great here, which is...\n- Chocolate Praline Bonbons with Valrhona Fudgesicle: I think this was one of the best desserts I've ever had because it has so many different components, all of which were spectacular. So many different textures--crunchy, crispy, soft, icy--like my cousin would say, it's like a party in my mouth!\n- Salted Chocolate Caramel Tart: This dessert was also really good, especially the soft, warm cookie, but unfortunately the chocolate bonbons and fudgesicle dessert stole the show. Still, this one is definitely worth getting.\n\nDRINKS\nOn top of all the great food and desserts, Prospect also makes really good drinks! Among us, we had the Il Terranova (mild and great for people with low alcohol-taste tolerance), I Am D.B. Cooper (super spirited!), Prospector, and Domino Effect.\nMy friends and I ended up liking our first round of drinks so much that we ordered 2 more rounds, and each of us stuck to our original picks!\n\nProspect completely exceeded my expectations, and I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. The tab can rack up pretty quickly especially if you also order drinks, appetizers, and desserts, but it's absolutely worth it. I can't wait to come back, and I'm constantly trying to find an excuse to dine here again.", "author": "Celia K."}

Started off sharing their soup special of the day: lobster and butternut squash soup with roasted rice bits on top - it was delicious! I cleaned my bowl with the quickness because it was so tasty and rich in lobster AND squash flavor. Second appetizer was the duck liver mousse with fig and pear dip - the fig and pear dip went really well with the duck liver on crackers. Eating the duck liver mousse alone is a bit salty but with the natural sweetness from the fig and pear evened out the flavor. Finally, the entree was a crispy fried chicken sandwich with jalape\u00f1os, cole slaw and tabasco - surprisingly not too spicy but the perfect amount to keep me wanting more.

I'll be honest and say that I left less than pleased.  The portions were very small, the food was overpriced and the service was less than stellar.   \n\nHowever, on a recent visit, I'm happy to report that I was very pleased with the entire dining experience.  I started off the the meal with an appetizer of scallops, which were  fresh, sweet and seared to perfection.  For my entree I ordered chicken that was prepared several ways including one piece that was sous-vide and then wrapped in bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=ZiVsUtPCllBRroSwqFJr6Q#Eq_AmvDlcOOWuH8EDsH4Mw).  It didn't seem like it was a huge portion, but for whatever reason I was barely able to finish my dish (even after a 7+ mile hike earlier that day).  It was some of the best chicken I've had in awhile.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the goat dish that was the special that evening.  It was tender and flavorful, but  not gamey in the least.  It had the texture of pork but looked like beef.  I like that Prospect changes it menu constantly and prepares its dishes in a manner different from what I typically see.\n\nFor dessert my friends and I split a dessert. If memory serves, it included a semi-freddo and a black velvet cake with meringue (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=ZiVsUtPCllBRroSwqFJr6Q#gS4RpSEwvnKVzAjXuuHCTg).  It wasn't too heavy or too sweet and a great ending to our meal.  On my prior visit, I had tried the ice cream sandwiches and the caramel popcorn and they are worth trying as well.\n\nThe service we received on this visit was excellent.  The wait staff was top notch, professional, friendly and helpful.   I would recommend Prospect to others without hesitation.", "author": "Melissa L."}

They push for the expensive dishes (the waiter recommended both foie gras dishes to a party of 2) and it's a little tacky.  The space is uninspiring and huge and I would probably not come back.  It's no wonder it's so easy to get reservations last minute.  We were seated next to two couples on a double date and they were so awfully loud and pretentious.  The crowd here is equally tacky on a Saturday night (we thought we were hosting out of town guests but they flaked last minute).  On the other hand, the savory foie dish was good.  The scallops were miniscule and were 3 for $18 or the recommended upgrade of 5 for $27.  The fried pork and octopus dish was ok but the meat was extremely stingy.  Prices are ridiculous for the quality and quantity of food.  Rent must be high.  You can dine for better quality and service elsewhere.", "author": "Chris L."}

I used to walk by this place every night on my way to Caltrain.  The place always was packed full of young business people drinking, chatting, networking, whatever moderately rich middle class seeming individuals do in that environment.\n\nWell, this guy got to go to that place finally.  I had heard great things about their burger.  A SF Top 5 burger according to many trusted sources on the Inter-webs. So reservation in hand, we went there and I had burger, burger, burger on the mind.  \n\nNot so fast!!!...as I entered, the words fried chicken were on the board outside.  Then inside, the same words showed up again...fried chicken...fried chicken sandwich specifically.  It was a bit pricier than the burger but I felt like risking it...so that's what I ordered.  I actually went halfsies with my coworker Joe so that we both could try each one.  Who says family style dining isn't dead?\n\nOh man, the fried chicken was so good.  The battered deep fried breast piece of chicken was so juicy that my usual aversion of eating fried chicken breast was completely forgotten. And the bun was too small to even cover the entire thing.  That, my friends, is awesome.  In comparison, to the burger, it was good but it paled to the fried chicken sandwich.  \n\nSince it was lunch, service was very smooth and attentive...not many of us were in there.  They even put a candle in the dessert and had a piece of chocolate with a scripted \"Happy Birthday\" lettering on there.  The dessert was a fruity bread pudding with lemon sorbet.  Also excellent.  Probably the only irritating thing of the day was that the person who boxed my coworkers food, didn't bring the box back to the table.  \n\nI can now cross Prospect off my to-do list and maybe one of these days, I'll be back here with all the other beautiful people during post work happy hour.", "author": "Ben H L."}

Went there on a Monday evening and it was so \"happening\" and busy and since we had made reservation we didn't have to wait. \n\nI enjoyed everything we ordered, including beef ribeye, salmon, ahi tuna tartar and a bread and salad dish.

The duck was well cooked, with crispy skin and nice medium rare center. \n\nWe shared the ice cream sandwich for dessert.

However, because of parking issues, we gave up and on a whim decided to come here instead. We were super lucky to get a table for 5 as the restaurant was packed, but we were seated immediately after our full party arrived on a friday night.\n\nAfter sitting down, we waited on my friend before ordering. The menu is pretty small, only one page and straight to the point. We ended up getting a bunch of appetizers and a few entrees to share, and the server was very insistent that we got two of everything. It was to the point where we felt like she was pushy.... was not too happy about that. We had told her we wanted to just order first and get more if we were still hungry, but she didn't really give us that option. Anyways, on to the food.\n\nHalf Dozen Shigoku Oysters, 21- The oysters were very fresh and had a light marination. It was a great start. \n\nBelgian Endive & Roquefort Cheese Salad, pears, pomegranate seeds, hazelnut brittle, pickled herbs, charred pear vinaigrette, 14- the salad was interesting yet good. The hazelnut brittle was my favorite part, and it was slightly fruity which was a great combination.\n\nMaine Lobster Pyramid Ravioli, golden chanterelle mushrooms, melted leeks, lobster nage, 17- this was one of my favorites. Loved the foam sauce, it really added a lightness to the ravioli. The put the chanterelle mushrooms on the side of the dish, which I thought was kind of random.\n\nAmerican Kobe Zabuton Carpaccio, shaved perigot truffles, pntarelle, peccorino, lemon aioli, baby greens, 18- this was my absolute favorite. The meat was marbled and super tender, and the truffles on top of the meat was amazing. Definitely recommend this dish! \n\nRoasted Berkshire Pork Chop, cabbage, baked potato puree, marble potatoes, apple and quince relish, pork jus 32- The pork was very succulent and tender; it was definitely one of the better pork chops I've had. Great entree.\n\nPan Roasted Organic Chicken Breast & House Made Chicken Sausage, lentils, foie gras,winter mirepoix, nettles, celery root puree, and rich chicken jus. 25- I dont know what's up with organic and not being as good, but this chicken was not that good. Kind of dry and bland. I didn't even taste the foie gras (maybe I didnt get it because it was a shared dish), but after eating one bite of the dish, I was like uhhhh... no. Stay away from this dish.\n\nWe also ordered a few drinks; I got the barrel-aged chocolate spiced negroni, which was too strong for my taste, but it was made well.\n\nOverall, our bill came out to be around $240. The food for the most part was delicious, and the service was good (besides the pushy incident).

We ordered the heirloom cucumber and avocado salad which was very light and had layers of flavors which prepared us for the next dish, wagyu beef tartare. It was AMAZING. It melted in our mouths. A must if you ever go. We shared the petrale sole which was like a seafood black rice paella. Very tasty and the foam was a nice touch. We also had the snake river farm Kobe with fingerling potatoes. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. We finished out meal with some chocolate bon bons. This was a bit too much for two people. The chocolate mousse was very rich and sweet.

When our waiter came back, we told him we wanted the spiced fries and foie gras to start.  He told us that the spiced fries were only available at the bar.  We told them it was on the menu, which he pointed out the bar menu was inserted into a few of our menus by mistake.  We were a bit disappointed we couldn't order the fries, but our waiter made an exception. \n\nWe ordered the following apps/entrees:\n\n-Prospect Spiced Fries,   Aioli - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=BP3q6sfToMw7Kd8nyghWeA#BP3q6sfToMw7Kd8nyghWeA\n\n-Foie Gras - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=sBeE3zeJ2RDkpLPXXtNA6g#sBeE3zeJ2RDkpLPXXtNA6g\n\n-Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette\n\n-Pork Chop (don't remember the name) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=Fefjiqp88VZ8kybp0S7t_w#Fefjiqp88VZ8kybp0S7t_w\n\n-Liberty Valley Duck Breast - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=5jkN59MfSXIoF8tX0m3X4Q#5jkN59MfSXIoF8tX0m3X4Q\n\n-Grilled Local Swordfish - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=VNYPynfldAwxyNtgTKv-Og#VNYPynfldAwxyNtgTKv-Og\n\n-Short-Ribs (don't remember the name as it was a special) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=or4mchzA1Bz7KhyGEMo5Bw#or4mchzA1Bz7KhyGEMo5Bw\n\nThe fries were served with an aioli sauce.  It was pretty tasty, but a bit too crunchy (I think it may have been a little burnt).  \n\nThe duck liver pate was decent, but I had better in France. \n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their entree as I didn't hear any complaints.  I ordered the pork chop, which I thought was DELICIOUS.  It was very juicy  and nicely brined, which was a plus.  It's probably one of the best pork chops I've ever eaten at a restaurant as usually pork chops come out dry.

Calamari with squid ink pasta - creative Japanese Italian fusion creation, but the pasta is a little taste less while the calamari on top is too salty. I don't think this would be an appetizer to order if you want something to start with. \n\n2. Grill swordfish - perfectly cooked, perfectly season, and the grill taste is profound. It's paired with dirty rice, which adds a perfect texture to the dish. There's also brocollini on the side; my favorite vegetables. \n\n3. Duck - the duck is cooked medium, just the way I like it. Duck sausage came on the side; I like any kind of sausage. The crunchy brussels sprouts pairs perfectly with the texture of the duck. The brussels sprouts has no bitter taste which will change the way you think about this vegetable ever again. \n\n\nTip: Make sure you make reservation or there will be no chance for you to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday night; weekdays will be based on luck.", "author": "Rosemary T."}

The service was great and they kept my coffee filled to the rim (much needed after a late night out). \n\nWe ordered Monkey Bread for a starter, which was basically a cinnamon roll. Didn't try it but apparently gauging from the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" emitting from my friends, it was delicious. I learned what \"epi\" is: a type of artisan bread that's often made at French-style bakeries. They have toasted epi accompanying many of their brunch items but I gave mine to a friend since I'm on the Paleo regime. My Short Rib & Smoked Potato Hash was very flavorful and the eggs were perfectly poached. Everyone else commented that their food was yummy and we had an enjoyable time.\n\nI would recommend Prospect highly for brunch!", "author": "Wendy N."}

We asked our server about the most popular lunch items and he recommended the fried chicken sandwich, the chicken salad, and the Chashu Pork Rice Bowl. We all opted for the chicken sandwich. They willingly replaced my potato salad with these amazing fries, super thick and piping hot. My coworker changed nothing and her potato salad was equally satisfying. The sandwich was huge and could've easily been split between two people, it was amazing and well worth the price. \n\nOverall:\n\nService - 4.5 stars, only because they left an identifying post-it on my plate to identify the fries substitution and they mistakenly provided us with a dessert menu instead of a cocktail menu when we sat down. \n\nFood - 5 stars, I can see why Prospect is held in such high regard with the critics. The prices were actually pretty reasonable considering the caliber of restaurant, particularly for lunch...~$30 for lunch, mixology cocktail and tip.\n\nAtmosphere - sophisticated, but inviting with booths on one side and tables on the other. The bar is appealing and away from the dining area.", "author": "Marcy A."}

Perfectly cooked. Coworker ordered the special grilled cheese and tomato soup combo which she said was one of the best she's had. Another ordered the donburi (Japanese egg, pork rice w new American fusion flavors) and loved it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-13", "description": "I don't say this very often, mostly because I can never decide on what I feel to be the \"best\" of anything, but Prospect has THE best brunch in San Francisco.  Brunch is always such a weird meal for me since I can never decide if I want breakfast and start the day off with a normal meal, or skip straight to lunch and enjoy something more savory.  Anyway, I took my parents here for brunch since a) I heard some fantastic things about the place, and b) it's close to where I live.  Anyway, I made a reservation for 12pm on a Sunday but it didn't seem necessary.  After perusing the menu (and Yelp) for appetizers, we came up with the following:\n\n- Monkey Bread\n- Deviled Eggs\n\nTwo very distinct dishes, but two OUTSTANDING ways to start off brunch.  The Monkey Bread, which has nothing to do with monkeys, was one of the most decadent things I've had.  It was like a cinnamon bun that got fluffed up to be the same texture as a cloud.  It took all restraint to not eat half the pan and then some.  The deviled eggs were highly touted on Yelp, so being that this is one of my favorite hors d'oeuvres, I had to get it.  The tiny plate of deviled eggs came out with a tiny sliver of jalapeno and bacon on top of it.  The texture of the filling was nothing I had ever had.  The jalapeno was also mixed into the filling of the egg and combined perfectly with the bacon garnish.  Yeah, I ate half the plate.  Moving onto the dishes, we all got something different, which translates into a sampler platter for me:\n\n- Me: The Prospector\n- Mom: Huevos Rancheros\n- Dad: Braised Short Rib & Smoked Potato Hash\n- Greg: Buttermilk Waffle\n\nSo, to start. My dish, The Prospector, was your standard eggs, bacon, sausage plate...except that it came with AMAZING corn skillet cakes which came off as pure tasty cornbread which was my favorite part of the dish.  I had a small bite of Greg's waffle, which was awesome, but I had to give up a piece of bacon and sausage.  We decided that it was probably best to stock to our own dishes after that.  My parents loved their dishes and at the end, and there were absolutely no leftovers.  Our server was great, and everyone always made sure we had enough coffee in our cups.  I absolutely loved Prospect and can't wait to go back and try something new!", "author": "Lisa I."}

Heck, even as I type this, weeks after I went there, I'm still not quite sure what to give.  Three?  Four?  Ugh.  I guess that's what happens when hopes/expectations aren't quite met.\n\nAfter hearing plenty of good things about Prospect, I was pretty stoked to finally check them out with a couple of friends.  Admittedly, I was a little disappointed we weren't going for dinner, but it didn't matter once I got a look at their brunch menu.  Since I've been on a bit of a potato hash kick lately, I went with the Braised Short Rib and Smoked Potato Hash (with Soft Cooked Eggs, Hollandaise with Beef Jus, Shisito Peppers, and Toasted Epi).\n\nOn their own, each individual part wasn't anything to write home about.  Combined, the dish wasn't bad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Sh-XNVgGDRwiN4K3UEQJA?select=ZiVsUtPCllBRroSwqFJr6Q#H8Eiw39uQHdvtpTfm5AE4A).  The chunks of short rib were pretty large (albeit a little dry) and the hash itself was seasoned and flavorful.  At the same time, it didn't enough to set itself apart from other hashes I've tried, and it was really the hollandaise sauce that tied everything together.  Not bad overall, just that it doesn't compare to my favorite short rib hash so far (Mission Beach Cafe).\n\nWhile my dish might have been more like THREE AND A HALF STARS, I rounded up because my friends were fans of their dishes and I liked the great ambiance and the friendly service.  Between the giant windows and the modern decor, I really liked the vibe of the place - nice, but not stuffy.  Even though I may not have been blown away by the brunch menu in the end, it was still a decent meal, and I'm still curious about checking out that dinner menu!", "author": "Mike L."}

The only thing that stood out was how perfectly fried the soft shell crab appetizer was.  The couple next to us thought the portions were too small, and the other couple thought their pork dish was so dry.\n\nI asked for more bread to the bus boy and he acted like I was being a burden to him. He eventually brought more bread but it seemed like it was leftover bread.  They were already cut up and spread apart rather than how it first comes when they bring it to you.  one felt awffully cold and old.  I informed the waitress and she brought more, but still it wasn't the same when they first bring you bread.\n\nThen to top it off, we waited forever for our dessert.  Then finally it arrives, but the ice cream was melted, so I asked whether the ice cream is supposed to be melted.  Obviously it was because it was just sitting at the kitchen waiting for someone to bring it to us.  My fiance was already impatient and said he's not waiting for another dessert.  So we cancelled that order.\n\nAt the end the waitress was apologetic and nice enough to give us popcorn to take home.  \n\nUnfortunately I will not be recommending or returning to this restaurant.", "author": "Sandy N."}

This time was for dinner and drinks with a friend.\n\nFirst of all, our server was amazing--he was super chill/funny/sarcastic while also polite and very nice (I wish I had caught his name.. I wrote \"you were awesome!\" on the receipt, though!). He recommended the scallops, which were a great choice. The scallops themselves were cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. The potatoes were really pureed, not mashed as you may expect. But it worked with the dish. It's not a huge dish, but it felt like the right portion size. In addition to the scallops, I got the bee keeper cocktail (gin, pear liqueur, pumpkin bitters, some type of soda water, and a lemon peel) which was super refreshing. I thought pumpkin bitters sounded odd, but it didn't have any real pumpkin flavor, so I'm guessing the bitters just helped round out the drink. I also got the s'mores bar for dessert which was decadent and a pretty unique take on a s'mores dessert. The graham cracker component was a more brittle cracker, the marshmallow was almost like a garnish, and the real start was the chocolate bar in the center (and the ice cream that came next to it).\n\nOverall great food, drinks, and service.

The rest of the food, when it finally arrived was very good (best pork chop I ever had).\n\n So why only two stars - the atrocious service.   About 15 minutes after ordering the waiter returned and said the computer \"lost\" our order so we reordered everything.  Well, that happens and since our appetizers came out promptly we thought no more about it.  After that, nothing!   We had to ask for bread (twice), refills on water and no one ever bothered to inquire why, after one hour we did not have our entrees.

It works! The sliced pineapple help cut down the richness of the foie gras and added a slight tang and sweetness to each bite. If you are into large portions, this burger isn't for you. It's definitely on the smallish side, if you have been to Unami Burger then you  would know what to compare it to. But honestly I am more about quality than quantity and the burger size was A OK with me. And this is without a doubt a quality burger. But it is pricey.

Hats off to this team for some of the best, coordinated service I have witnessed in many months! A perfect atmosphere for a work dinner- where all of the service details are taken care of and the guests are left to mingle!  The staff have been trained well to blend-in, seamlessly taking care of all of the details of ordering, water and wine service, the serving and clearing of dishes.   Regarding the food-  The hamachi starter was delicious! Please bring a spoon next time so that I can drink the citrus sauce.  Toasted masago- love that! The menu was intriguing, and the presentation very pretty... although overall the execution of the entrees seemed to fall a bit flat.  The salmon itself lacked seasoning and the puree a bit too sweet.  The steak needed a sauce- where was the bordelaise? I guess I missed it.  Desserts were pretty but not memorable.  I also wish the intrigue of the menu descriptions carried thru better to the execution.  I think this is the bane of the SF food scene... flowery or inventive menus that fall a little flat when it comes to delivering that magic on the plate.  Final thought- the menu was missing a few \"crave items\" that would make me dream of coming back.  But all in all, a really good performance and a packed house for a Tuesday night.  Well done!!", "author": "val b."}

If I were making a bit more per year, I'd come here much more frequently. BUT. Not making THAT much, I still didn't feel awkward, so bonus points to you, Prospect!\n\nScallops: Pretty nicely done. It was just a TOUCH less seared than I'd like (I kind of like that nice brown crust you get from a hard sear in contrast with the soft scallops), but the taste was really good.\n\nSoft Shelled Crab: This...had the crisp I was missing a bit from the scallops. It was to a point of overly crispy, but it might have to do with the fact that I only had a claw/leg of the appetizer. \n\nStuffed Quail: Only had a bite of this off my friend's plate. It was good, albeit a bit overly salty. The stuffing was the salty part, and it was SO good, but my friends couldn't finish the stuffing because it was overly salted. Maybe if they paired some bread...but I feel like that might be blasphemous. The quail was done very well and was super tasty. Lots of rosemary taste, so if you like that, it's a winner.\n\nPork: I had a bite of this as well, and it was good. Almost made me wish I ordered this instead.  The pork was done perfectly - just a touch pink in the center, which always makes me happy. It's terrible to overcook pork, and if you have good quality meat (which, I assume Prospect does), it's nice to highlight the meat. Juicy. Yum!\n\nSwordfish: This is what I decided on, and it was pretty solid. It came with some potatoes (papas = fried potatoes), which were good with the sauce it came in (aioli maybe?). The swordfish was cooked very nicely. I've had overcooked swordfish which is not good. This one was juicy, and cut like a fish steak. It was so good. \n\nOur service was good, until about the end. Our waiter was very nice and friendly, but near the end, he inadvertently became part of the table conversation. One friend mentioned something about hitting the table, and our waiter banged the water carafe on the table...which made my other friend laugh (with a full mouth). She couldn't explain, and he seemed to get a bit upset. Our service went from warm to cool, and there's no blaming him for that. Overall though, the service and staff were very good and on point. They were present when we needed them without being overbearing.", "author": "Lily W."}

I asked the server for two bowls and spoons and she whisked by, dropped off two spoons, didn't say a word letting us know she will return with the bowls, instead left then returned with the bowls.  \n\nThe duck mousse and calamari appetizers were excellent.  Don't bother with the lobster bisque.  It was way too runny and lack of lobster flavor.\n\nThe short ribs were very tender but you only get about four slices.  My companions said the special of the day oyster po boy was good but not the fried chicken ramen.  She said she had it better elsewhere.\n\nOrdered the apple pie sundae and came to my shocking surprise that the small cup of sundae cost $11!! The sundae had two small scoops of ice cream, one small scoop of whipped cream and about a table spoon of Apple meat with cookie crust.)   It's part my fault that I didn't pay attention on the price on the menu.  The point is I'd pay for a $11 dessert if it's worth the price but this sundae completely not worth the price.  It's not very often I felt ripped off but this sundae definitely was one so be warned.\n\nOverall, price is on the higher side comparing the portion that was given.

For lunch I got the pork rice bowl and it was delicious. I barely ate the pork because all of the other tastes in the bowl were so yummy I almost forgot about it!  For dessert we shared a few but I only had the strawberry ice cream sandwich which came with snicker doodle cookies as the \"cookie\" part.  Mouth watering!  My only complaint about this place is that I can't eat almost every type of fish and they seemed to be the only healthy options on the menu.  Even the one thing that looked to be the healthiest (chicken salad) came on a mound of bread and was more of a sandwich.  If you are eating paleo, your options are very limited and almost none.

Walking in, you'll notice how sleek and modern the decor looks like. The restaurant itself is pretty big. Our brunch was actually in the private room towards the back of the restaurant. The room itself was large enough to fit about 50 people, about 5 large tables. It had its own private bar in the room, as well as someone asking for coat check.

I've also had brunch here a couple of years ago, and really enjoyed that. I made my reservations a week or so in advance, and we were seated right when we arrived. The lighting inside is very dim, which makes for an intimate setting. We ordered:\n\n-Tuna Tartare w/Taro Chips (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw): Yum! The tuna was really fresh, and I loved how all the different flavors worked together for the tartare. My only complaint is that the taro chips break apart really easily, and they didn't give you enough initially. Our server let us know we could've ordered extra, but we didn't want to have to wait longer for them to arrive. However, I still really enjoyed this dish!\n-Green Goddess Salad (Mixed lettuces, Cucumbers, Avocado, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#vo4HuugO8TN1ZJNfVkJzuA): This dish was on the 7x7 2012 Big Eat List, and I loved this salad! It was a smaller portion for the price, so I wished they could've given you more lettuce/vegetables, but the cucumbers in it were super fresh and crispy, and I liked the taste of the dressing. Recommended!\n-Mushroom Soup w/Braised Pork Belly, Soft Cooked Egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#X8sZ-oqAbCR13tiTlJ1XLA): Deliciously rich! I had to share with the bf and didn't want to part with it. A must order if you love pork belly and soft cooked egg.\n-Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/prospect-san-francisco?select=pa-jJPSfDrYYrLkp-M2stw#DWNEpfqclUkz9WwWe4cxYg): Pretty good. The bavette was tender, but this dish wasn't anything spectacular or different like some of the other dishes. \n\nOverall, Prospect has some great food. You are definitely paying for that quality, but I think it's worth the cost. Parking in the Financial District can be difficult to find, but there is some street parking around this area. They also offer a valet service convenience. Service here is attentive but not suffocating.", "author": "Amy D."}

Service was a bit scatter brained and inconsistent (a few of us got plates ... the rest of us didn't until 10 minutes later).  Some of the appetizers they ordered didn't seem right (much too spicy to be the peppers the menu claimed them to be).

He chose the spot, and, despite his last-minute planning style, he was able to get a reservation within the week. Always a plus for SF. \n\nWe started with cocktails. I got something with the word \"Phoenix\" in the name. It was perfectly light and fruity without being too sweet. My husband got their twist on an Old Fashioned, and we both agreed that they really shouldn't have tried to tamper with a classic favorite. Pepper tincture? No thanks.\n\nTo start, we inhaled the duck confit pappardelle. YUMS. The pasta was lovely and al dente, and the duck/sauce was wonderfully flavorful. The portion was on the small size, but I think that's partially because the deliciousness made me want twelve times more.\n\nI had the pork chop. It was tender and savory with a yummy crust. Could have done without the oddly flavorless and dry spatzle that came with it, but the meat (aka the important part) was thumbs up.\n\nHusband had the roast duck. He seemed very pleased with it, but I was so involved with my perfectly brined pork chop that I didn't have time to taste it. \n\nFor dessert, my husband chose the peanut butter chocolate cake, and I chose their equivalent of a Grasshopper because sometimes I like to drink my calories. I ended up drinking all of my dessert and eating 80% of his. Both were amazing.\n\nThis was the perfect date night spot for us. The food was excellent and the ambiance was modern romantical without being too dark to see my food. Service was very attentive without making us feel rushed in any way.

We ordered a handful of appetizers and entrees, no drinks.  The appetizers took 45 minutes to arrive while we sipped on our water, and once they arrived, we realized that we were missing 1.  We asked the waiter, and turns out he forgot to put the order in (I guess he needed more than 45 minutes to remember).  A manager came over and apologized, and said that the missing appetizer would be on the house for the inconvenience.  Another 25 minutes later (sip, sip...water...sip, sip) our entrees arrived.  They were just ok.  We thought that maybe the restaurant is super busy, and that's why it took so long for the food to come, but we looked around and tons of empty tables.  We ordered dessert, and when it came time to get the check (2 HOURS LATER), we had been charged for the missing appetizer.  We had to complain again saying that it was supposed to be on the house, and they took another 15 minutes just to readjust it.  This place has a good ambiance and fun social vibe, but I wouldn't say it's a go-to place for service or food, especially for the prices.  It's a happy hours/drinks spot (at least to me).

If this were a horse race, Prospect just might win the Triple Crown...\"  ~Michael Bauer\n\nAfter reading a magazine article: \"Bay Area's Young Rising Chefs\", I found out about Chef Ravi Kapur and Prospect, coined as one of 2010's most anticipated openings. \n\nProspect is the little sister of Boulevard. I have not been to Boulevard, so I have no basis for comparison at this point. However, I read that Chef Ravi Kapur's menu at Prospect has a more inventive and modern take as compared to his alta mare, Boulevard which drew me in. \n\nInitially, my friend and I were going to have our joint Birthday Dinner at Prospect on 9/8/10, but one week prior to the date, she found out they were closed due to flooding. I had made reservations 2 weeks prior, but no one at Prospect bothered to call me to alert me of the flooding. Thank goodness she found out through a third party, otherwise, we would have been screwed when our party arrived there.\n\nDespite this blunder, we still wanted to try Prospect. On Monday, 9/20/10, my friend and I arrived promptly for our 8 PM reservations and were immediately seated.\n\nFOOD:\nDo note that the portion sizes at Prospect are small, so it's recommended to get an app, entr\u00e9e, and dessert (or 2 apps) which will set you back about $60/person w/o alcohol.\n\n*Seared Octopus & Calamari w/ Black Rice, Mussels, and Saffron broth ($14): OK. The octopus was perfectly grilled and tender w/ a nice bite. Albeit salty, the fragrant saffron broth was rich and savory w/ a hint of honey. However, b/c the octopus laid on top of the broth, some parts of the octopus didn't soak up the broth which resulted in the edges being tough and rubbery. \n\n*Garlic Roasted Quail w/ Roasted Almonds and Tabouleh ($16): DELISH! The quail was perfectly roasted producing a tender and moist center w/ a light crisp skin. The quail was a full of flavor w/ prominent garlic flavor that wasn't too overwhelming. The tabouleh and almonds added a nice texture contrast to the quail, as well as, a layer of nuttyness. The citrus tang from the preserved lemon brightened up the dish and brought all the ingredients together with the exception of the mission figs. The figs were too large and the sweetness overpowered the quail. Using golden raisins would have probably been a better choice. \n\n*Waygu Zabuton w/ Creamed Chippolinis, Smoked Trumpets, and Spinach ($29): OMG, OMG, and OMG! Ever since being spoiled by the waygu at Wolfgang Puck's CUT in Vegas, no cut of meat has ever compared. However, what made this dish stand out was the complexity of flavors. \n\nThe waygu was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The rich marbling gave way to a soft, tender and flavor cut of meat. The creamed chippolinis was heavenly and added a decadent layer of savory and sweet richness to the waygu. The smoked trumpets were tender and the smokiness was prominent w/o being too harsh. The richness of the dish was offset by the slightly bitter spinach and tang from the mustard seed au jus. One minor complaint, however, was the dish was too heavily salted for my taste. \n\n*Pink Pearl Apple Tart ($9): Meh! I'm very keen on various flavor, texture and temperatures combos. However, the ingredients in this dessert were NOT cohesive. Puff pastry was topped w/ vanilla applesauce and half a pouched apple. As I tried to cut into the apple, the delicate puff pastry smashed and crumbled into pieces. Apple granita was topped w/ rich and creamy spiced ice cream. All of the apple components were excessively tart and there was no sweetness to offset that tartness. \n\nSERVICE:\nThe staff is professional and friendly, however, a bit contrived. We were starving and it took over 15 minutes to order our food (we already knew what we wanted w/ in 2 minutes of sitting down). The apps came out w/in 10 minutes of ordering, but our entrees didn't come until 25-30 minutes after our apps were taken away. So, there were some timing issues, but nonetheless, our waitress made sure everything was ok and the wait staff made sure our water glasses were filled. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nAlthough Prospect is minimalist in d\u00e9cor, it is beautifully designed. The large open space is warmed up by earth toned color walls and rustic wood floors and jazzed up w/ colorful modern art. \n\nThere's a large bar area w/ a communal table that leads to the main dining room. A ramp leads you to a private dining area in the back. \n\nIf you want to impress a date, Prospect is a perfect place to take him/her. Tables are well-spaced out to allow intimacy and some distance from other patrons. And, even though it's bustling, the noise level is tolerant enough to maintain a convo w/o having to loudly raise your voice.\n\nAlthough I can't quite agree w/ Michael Bauer's statement about Prospect winning the Triple Crown, Prospect does excel in its infancy stages and I have high hopes for Boulevard's sire as it matures.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We loved how they had small portions, so we were able to sample lots of different things without filling up too quickly. My favorite was the porcini and ricotta gnudi, which was also beautifully presented with edible flowers! I also loved the tuna poke appetizer and the Kobe beef tartare- is it obvious that I like raw food??? My dessert, the pb milk chocolate cake, was the obvious winner. However, I also tried the Black Forest sundae, and it was so fantastic with rocky road ice cream and a black cherry sorbet. Such a unique dessert for a fancy restaurant, but they pulled it off!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "My chauffeur, Alfred, pulled up along the curb right in front of Prospect.  He opened my door... and as I stepped out with my beautiful wife, I made sure to put my elegantly carved wooden cane to use for my bad right knee.  To be sure I was on time for happy hour, I pulled out my Audemars Piguet classic pocket watch from my charcoal grey n textured custom tailored Zegna sports coat.  Ah... perfect 3:51pm.  9 minutes until happy hour menu would start.  I started to make my way to the entrance while Alfred closed my Bentley door behind me.  Before I even made it to the door, their entire staff including their chef, manager, and owners quickly gathered to greet me.  Swell.\n\nMy love and I made ourselves comfortable on their sofa while we thoroughly enjoyed their wood grains and contemporary decor throughout the restaurant... what grandeur.  We got things started with a happy hour sparkling for my lady... it was very acidic and sour as if it were a pure sparkling lemonade with no sugar.  To our luck, it was a very warm weekend so the sparkling turned out to be quite refreshing.  We most likely won't be ordering that again.  For a more substantial cocktail, I had the Booker's Old Fashioned, a very attractive mix of Booker's gin, agave nectar, prospect bitters, on 3 cubes of ice and lemon rind.  Quite the sipper... but they must've thought I couldn't hold my liquor because it was a small cocktail filling about less than a third of the rock glass maybe even a fourth if it wasn't for the ice.\n\nA few happy hour snacks before our fancy and lavish dinner to seduce our appetite for the night.  My palate danced with their devils of basil pesto and cherry tomatoes... egg? basil? pesto? devils?  Some of my favorite things in life all in one.  Exquisite.  Fried Shishito and Jimmy Nardell Peppers... accompanied by a wonderfully crispy pork belly and wasabi breadcrumbs.  Peppers and pork belly... mouthwatering.  Wasabi... irrelevant although the breadcrumbs were a nice light crunch.  The Saffron Arancini were fried to crispy golden little spheres with a fluffy risotto-like filling.  What was not to love?  Last, the Chicken Liver Mousse with dates and pickled shallots on crostini.  A little too sweet for my tastes but was enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nI'd say that was a successful happy hour...\n\nHOWEVER... Let's straighten out some fibs and confirm some truths to my story.\n\nI don't have a chauffeur and I drive a toyota.  The only Bentley I can afford at the moment is the one in my dreams.  I am not married... but I very well should be because my gf is just amazing.  I don't have expensive fancy Zegna tailored suits, a luxurious Audemars Piguet pocket watch, or a rich man's cane.  I had my cap on with blue jeans and a t-shirt.  My knee isn't in its best shape... that is true.  I wasn't headed to an extravagant dinner, rather it was going to be some quick home cooking.   I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that my beautiful gf and my bad knee wasn't enough to get any greeting whatsoever at the door.  We sat ourselves without being greeted even though they saw us walk in.  Maybe if I had a Bentley or a nice designer suit, then that server I approached would have perhaps given me better help with my questions about their happy hour.  No smile, no eye contact WHILE we were having a quick Q&A.  He looked rather flustered with wiping down the happy hour leather padded menus I so desperate wanted to look at.  10 minutes before happy hour would start, I asked the bartender if there was a happy hour drink menu I could see... he says it's not 4pm yet.  That was it... that was all to his answer.  I think it wouldn't hurt to let me see the menu though.  Funny because the server said the same thing when I asked to see the happy hour food menu while he was wiping them down but he didn't let me see a menu until I insisted he hand me one just so I know what I would want to order once their kitchen opens at 4.  They weren't mean about it or anything but the air about the whole place and the staff was a little snooty and arrogant.  Just stating the obvious.  Their happy hour menu is pretty tasty and pricing is very reasonable.  I've been here quite a few times for dinner and it's delicious!\n\nNormally it'd be a 4+ at my dinners but 3.5 this time and I will have to round down on this one for a 3.", "author": "Colin M."}

When we got there, the server had no clue and said the chef could \"though throw something together.\"  Well, he wasn't joking.

Prospect flooded a couple days prior to our reservation and I'm lucky I get emails from EaterSF or else we wouldn't have known.  Prospect failed to contact us to inform us that they would be closed due to flooding.\n\nMy friend and I decided to come here for dinner last night.  She booked an 8:30pm reservation and although we got there a little after 8pm, they said someone booked us for an 8pm reservation.  \n\nSTARTERS:\n*Garlic Roasted Quail ($16) - YUM!  I loved the quail, it was extremely moist and tender.  The tabouleh was good but it seemed like there was a bit too much lemon and the almonds added a nice touch to the dish.  However, I think the fig did not compliment the dish at all.\n\n*Seared Octopus & Calamari ($14) - The dish was okay.  The octopus and calamari had a slight grilled taste and although the menu says mussels, there was only one mussel.  The black rice was okay, but I wasn't a fan of the saffron broth the rice soaked in.\n\nENTR\u00c9E:\n*Dayboat Scallops w/Lobster Mushroom Risotto ($26) - Meh.  Although I LOVED the scallops and thought they were cooked to perfection, the lobster mushroom risotto ruined it.  The risotto was so salty, it became inedible at the end.  As my friends know, if I complain about a dish being salty and I have a high tolerance for salt, it must be EXTREMELY salty.  \n\nDESSERT:\n*JB's French Toast ($9) - DELICIOUS!!  Who would've though cornflake crusted bread, candied hazelnuts, and plums would taste as good as it did?  Everything complimented each other perfectly.  There was also hazelnut ice cream, but I wasn't a fan of that.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waitress was nice and cheerful.  Our appetizers came out in good time, however it took our entrees a lot longer to come out.  After ordering, we sat there as both tables next to us got bread and it took up until almost getting our appetizers to finally get bread.", "author": "Nicole S."}

If you come here for brunch on a weekend, definitely make a reservation. The restaurant was pretty busy. My first impression was that the restaurant is very elegant. It feels very open and airy with the large windows that let in the beautiful sunlight. Great environment to chat over cocktails and enjoy some good company over good food. There was an air of snobbery here though because it's kind of posh, so don't come wandering in looking like a bum. \n\nAPPETIZER: \nMonkey Bread: Delicious! This is basically a cinnamon bun type pastry that you can break off into balls like donut holes sized pieces. It's the perfect amount of sweetness without being overwhelming. The texture is light with a delightfully thin soft baked top that provides a slightly crisp contrast to the soft pastry. Highly recommended as a starter to your meal. This is enough to be shared between 2 people. \n\nENTREE:\nEgg Sandwich; crispy pork belly, egg served sunny style up, orange marmalade, English muffin, home fries-Good but not extremely impressive. I would give this a 3.5/5. The pork belly was good but it could've used a little something extra. The orange marmalade gave an interesting flavor to the dish. I liked the combination of sweet and savory. The potatoes were nicely seasoned but nothing to rave about. I liked the egg sandwich but I wish the portion would've been a little bigger. Their portions are definitely not suited for big eaters. \n\nDRINK:\nI don't like to drink so I was glad to see that they offer options without any alcohol. The combinations were very creative. I had the pineapple drink and it was good but forgettable. \n\nThe one area which was really lacking was the service. The food took awhile to come out.

We arrived on time for a 6:30 reservation and were greeted warmly and seated immediately. \nThe menu was great - the choices were both familiar and innovative. For instance, the market salad had fantastic little pieces of what I can only call intensified watermelon. (They juiced some watermelon, cooked it down, added a tiny bit of extra flavor, and somehow got it back into pieces of melon.)  The entrees were just as delightful - a pork chop that was served with a creamy corn pudding and apriums. Salmon served with amazing little bits of smoked trout. \n\nThe large staff is attentive and friendly without being imposing. A special thanks to the sommelier who selected an amazing Austrian cider. \n\nIt really doesn't get much better than this.", "author": "Eben O."}

Not loud (serious bonus points for this).  \n\nStarted at the bar with the best Raspberry Lemon drop I've ever had.  The BEST cocktail ever consumed.\n\nDinner was amazing.  Appetizers of pressed raviolis, squash blossoms and heirloom tomato salad.  Ravioli dish was to die for.  Main course, pork loin with pork belly - do not get the appeal of pork belly at all, but the pork loin was perfectly cooked and the perfect portion.  Came over a bed of sweet/nutty faro + black mission fig.  Really excellent.  \n\nMy mom had Snake River Farms Kobe Bavette steak...hands down BEST steak ever eaten. Perfect in every way.  My sister had the halibut.  great crust, perfectly cooked, but could have used more lemon and salt (which she added herself and then was very happy).\n\nOnly reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service.  Our server was Gabriella.  She was lovely, very competent, really knew the menu, the wine list, etc. very well spoken and obviously pro.  The problem was she kept running away from the table and we were struggling over wine choices and had to ask several times for help.  It shouldn't have been that hard to order wine, and we're wine drinkers!\n\nAlso we were told that two wines we wanted to try were not available for tastes.  This is a no no in my book.  It's not like these were $1,000 bottles, not even $100 bottles, so that should never be a no...just my personal opinion.  If you have clients sitting at your table ordering dinner, let them try what they want.  95% certainty they will order what you just poured them.\n\nAlso when ordering our food, we requested the squash blossom appetizer and were promptly told that it was only available at the bar (we had been sitting at the bar and looking at that menu) but that she would check with the kitchen.\n\nReally?  That was annoying.  Again, clients at your table, get them what they want.  Does the world end if you run out of squash blossoms at the bar?  No.\n\nAll in all, I would HIGHLY recommend.

This is a hardcore FiDi after-work crowd and I have to say, predominately male, on a random Tuesday night. Aside from the \"bizness\" atmosphere, the food and drinks were merry and mighty delicious. \n\nThe summer dinner menu skews towards seafood lovers but there was something that appealed to everyone in my group including a vegan. We split the ultra-fresh Heirloom Tomato Salad and battled over the creamy pieces of Burrata. The Seared Sea Scallops were accompanied by long beech mushrooms and okra, swimming in a surprising Thai curry broth. Prospect also had a daily special: a lovely risotto served with a fresh farm egg. Don't let the visuals fool you, it looked a bit like bland oatmeal but tasted far from it. \n\nAfter devouring the bread plate, I decided to order two appetizers for my main course. If you know me, that's a rare moment of restraint. The Monterey Calamari and Potato Ravioli were of course, appy-sized, but it was creamy and decadent. The Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho was definitely the star of the show. It arrives dotted with prawns, peppers and avocado mousse and they make a light show of it by pouring the chilled gapacho tableside. It also comes topped with uni (sea urchin) that you can request with or without. Plus, it is SPICY as all get out. \n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the fare and our NYC guests couldn't stop raving about the dishes so chalk another one up for the SF food scene!", "author": "Faith Y."}

But I suppose it's also due to all the decent to great brunch competition in SF and that corner of the city alone. The crowd was decidedly younger and more casual dressed; the restaurant was maybe half full at any given time. Brunch seems like a good ploy to lure in the younger crowd, and get them more intrigued about the pricier dinners. At least our super talkative waiter really hyped dinners up. On to the food:\n\nThe pumpkin beignets were pretty good, but I wish they tasted fresher. They weren't as warm as you'd expect if it came recently out of the fryer and into the sugar; oh wait, it may have been our over-caffeinated waiter being a tad extra enthusiastic about his accent and us not wanting to be too rude by stuffing our faces while he spoke, haha (he was cool though; just wish that if our food doesn't need a little cooling down when it's served, I'd love the friendly banter more during order/dessert taking ;). I'm guessing they also prep batches in advance given the volume, so they can squeeze in a little of the pumpkin sauce filling more efficiently. They come with a ton of chocolate and bourbon caramel sauces, but they can be overpowering relative to the pumpkin flavor if you use too much.\n\nPork cheek cassoulet was very tasty; get it. Heard they have a similar version using swordfish for dinner. The omelete of the day (chard and goat cheese) was a healthy portioned size, not overly huge like say, Stacks. That was good as well, although I most enjoyed their slice of their perfectly toasted buttery epi baguette, so simple and so good... It also came with roasted potatoes, but eh nothing special there.\n\nLastly, we topped it off with a bag of their cacao nib carmel popcorn. They gave it to us in a cute little Prospect brown bag, which was great for taking to go and munching along the bay. Hooray for brunch!", "author": "Linus W."}

The staff is warm & friendly, and the bartenders easy on the eyes; my eyes were riveted by the full height and still growing Madrone tree which sat just behind our table.\n\nWe started with the seasonal fried squash blossom and burrata salad, featuring hair-thin slices of squash in a delectably light pistou. The balance was perfect, with the crisp squash cutting through the nutty sauce and soft fresh cheese just so; the breaded blossom lorded over the dish like the sweet summertime duchess she is.\n\nNext we had cauliflower au gratin, lightly cooked brassica crispness enveloped in creamy jus with blended moments of peppery piquant.\n\nMy main was an entree sized version of the tuna tartare. An unexpectedly large portion of fresh, firm tuna interspersed with tiny cubes of crisp heirloom cucumber and carbonated minimally-sweet yellow mellon, topped with a forest of oignon frite and taro root chips, all plated over a bold swipe of fantastically spicy red curry. \n\nPerhaps the most pleasing of 2012.

I wished that I tried Prospect earlier as Chef Ravi Kapur, featured in the article, is no longer cooking here.\n\nMy friend and I went to Prospect two weekends ago for Sunday brunch and shared the Prospector (the cover dish, $15) as well as the crispy pig trotters with fried egg ($12). The Prospector was delicious. While I mistakened the corn skillet cakes as polenta cakes (love polenta), they were actually more like cornbread but still very tasty. The bacon, pork apple sausage, and home fries were great too. \n\nAlthough the pig trotters were highly recommended on Yelp, I didn't care for them; the pig trotters were more like fried croquettes since they were heavily breaded with not enough pig feet. I did enjoy the fried egg which was still runny, as well as the frisee and radicchio salad which offset the fried trotters. The dish had home fries, too. While the portion for the Prospector was large and hearty, the pig trotter dish wasn't very filling since it only had two small pieces of the pig trotters: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Sh-XNVgGDRwiN4K3UEQJA?userid=4FcfCT4WFGdNI_E09htphQ \n\nWe weren't full yet and wanted to order something else, but service was so slow and almost nonexistent that we decided to eat elsewhere. For the price we were paying, I expected more attentive service. Our server never dropped by to see how we were doing; she ignored us most of the time even after we've flagged her. We asked her for a coffee refill twice and after a long wait, finally the manager refilled our coffee. We asked to see the dessert menu, another 10 minute wait ... same for the bill. After we gave her our credit card, she forgot about us and just left the cards sitting at the register. 10 minutes later, I flagged her when she finally remembered, so she went back to the register to swipe our cards.

Very refreshing, although it could have been a bit stronger.  :)  \n\n- Appetizer: (1) Crispy pig trotters with housemade aioli.  This was absolutely delicious!  (2) Gnocchi with wild mushrooms.  I know it's just a starter, but that appetizer was terrribly small! \n\n- Entree:  I had the seared scallops, which were huge and super buttery -- highly recommend this.  My Mom really enjoyed her sole, too -- she said it was very light and cooked just right.  My boyfriend ordered the steak, and he thought that it could have been a bit more seasoned.\n\n- Dessert:  We ordered the vanilla creme brulee and salted caramel cake with banana ice-cream.

We were warned by friends the food has gotten much saltier (our personal bete noir) and to our horror, they were correct.\n\nThe soup was salty, and so scant it was more a sauce over the excellent black cod with mussel fritter. The prawns on the risotto were also oversalted, leaving a faint aftertaste of salt in the mouth.\n\nThe foie gras with grapes was ill-conceived. The grapes were merely sweet, with no acid to balance against the richness of the foie gras. And again, the foie gras was oversalted!\n\nThe pork chop was overdone and the mustard mashed potatoes were awful, as they always are (who invented this dish, and why haven't we executed this person yet?). It's lovely that it's an heirloom Berkshire chop, but when overcooked and unsauced, it's just a too-chewy piece of meat.\n\nThe goat mixed roast was terrible, mostly fat. I like fat, but this was too much even for me. I left most of the last cut on the plate. The sauce was intense, yet oddly flat, without any real depth.\n\nNone of these dishes or sauces was egregiously oversalted. But there was just that slight overall edge of sodium that coarsened the combinations. What came through consistently were various tastes, but they didn't meld into harmonious flavors. \n\nSeven months ago our first dinner here was perfect, with intense but balanced flavors, where there was a real depth and complexity to the food without overwhelming the great quality of ingredients. But this dinner never found that edge, either because we picked the wrong dishes or former ExecChef Kapur took all the inspiration with him when he left. \n\nWe will be going back to Boulevard before year end 2011 to evaluate the food at Prospect's sibling restaurant. We've got our fingers crossed.....Ms. Oakes was in the kitchen when we were there, but it clearly didn't help.", "author": "Jean K."}

Overall, the food was good, seasoned well, but nothing outstanding.  The portions are small, so don't come with a large appetite.  \n\nWe started with some appetizers to share buffet style:  Beet Salad - nicely done, mixed with a light amount of greens and some citrus slices (either orange or tangerine) to balance the flavor of the beets.  The sea scallops, while flavorful, were very small.  Not a fan of the Halibut tartare as the seasoning was lackluster.  It was refreshing with bits of cucumber, but the small pieces of Halibut did not stand out on their own.  The Kale salad was alright.  I like a softer kale for my salad, and the more hearty ones for a savory meal where it can stand up to heat.  These were a bit chewy when eaten raw.  If you want to share with your friends, you will have to order more than one or two appetizers.\n\nI was concerned when we ordered the entree that it would be too much food after having appetizers.  No need to worry, as the portions were small as well.  My girlfriend ordered the Monkfish with muscles and got two bites of the fish and a few muscles split in half.  My Petrale Sole was a fair portion, but they only served three mini-asparagus with it as a side.  Where is the balance in the protein to vegetable?  Not here evidently.\n\nThe decor is nice, service is attentive and good while the noise from surrounding diners a bit loud.  I can say that I have experienced Prospect but will not go back soon.  Its pricey for what you get.", "author": "Robert G."}

I ordered a diet coke, and I was charged $3.50 per refill. Sadly, I don't even think it was fresh coke out of a can, but rather flat soda out of a 2L bottle. \n\nWhatever, the soda thing didn't matter too much in the big picture. The worst thing about the meal was the food. I ordered the pork chop, which tasted pretty normal. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasnt mindblowingly good. It was a dish I could make in my own kitchen. I had higher expectations from reading other reviews. My gf ordered a tuna dish. The tuna was extremely underseasoned and very bland.

I was last here closer to its opening, a time when the d\u00e9cor might have seemed fresher than it does now.\n\nHouse cocktails were interesting but generally too sweet. We had the Anti-Hero, an almost candy-like drink where the sharpness of white rye is completely lost, and the D.B. Cooper, a much better concoction with good mouthfeel that just didn't quite make it from \"interesting\" to \"delicious.\" I would never complain about such a drink, though: I love trying interesting cocktails even if I might not choose to order one again. I wonder, though, how far the program must have strayed from Brooke Arthur's original vision to arrive where it is now.\n\nHouse olives were tasty.\n \nOysters (six for $21) were a variety I wasn't familiar with but which did have a surprising complexity. Some were so creamy the finish couldn't quite cleanse but overall I did enjoy them.\n\nGreen Goddess salad had great flavor and texture. The presentation was confusing -- with all the green goddess hidden inside a shell of lettuces we thought we might have gotten the wrong dish. In the end, though, we wished the chef had stuck with little gems; the baby lettuces added more bitterness than the dish called for.\n\nBurger was above average though the bun had no structure. The fries were disappointing (too fat and starchy) but accompanied by outstanding aioli.\n\nLater we asked for a dry Manhattan with Rendezvous Rye and got one made with dry vermouth. When questioned the bartender said, \"oh you meant dry like a dry martini.\" At least he made us a new one, but no color of Dolin vermouth is going to make a Manhattan worth paying $14 for. (We asked but no other variety of vermouth was available. What fancy bar in SF does't have Carpano or Punt y Mes?) \n\nBy the end of our time at the bar the bartender had apparently decided we weren't worth the trouble as we had to ask the barback for our check. After I placed the card in the presenter, another long wait was broken by the barback taking the check presenter and placing it into the bartender's field of view.\n\nLater that night as we got ready for bed, I couldn't help but compare two receipts in my wallet from this week: one from Wexler's ($106) where we'd just days ago had a truly wonderful and memorable meal and the one from Prospect ($112) where the experience dripped with disappointment.", "author": "Joshua P."}

The space is beautiful with simple neutral colors, high ceilings, large windows.  The restaurant itself is actually pretty low key.\n\nAs for the menu, it's more Californian with no tasting option.  We ended up with a bottle of wine, but the cocktail list looked really appealing.\n\nWe started with a wagyu beef tartare that was probably one of the most creative ones I've had, served with a spicy mustard ice cream, which mixes in really well.  There was crunch and tartness from the cornichons and capers, and it's all spread on warm pretzel bread.  There was also a truffle tagliatelle with light summer flavors (squash blossom pesto), but it was under-seasoned for my tastes.\n\nAs for the special roasted chicken breast of the day, it was cooked just right without being dry.  The beans underneath were a nice accompaniment, and it was presented nicely.  The highlight of the main courses was definitely the pork chop - well seasoned, topped an apricot relish to make it a lighter dish. The okra croquette was also creative and just the right amount of fried goodness. This would definitely be my recommendation for the night.\n\nAs for dessert, we had a strawberry and pistachio tart with creme fraiche ice cream and strawberry ice cream.  It's a good, lighter dessert for summer, and there are lots of textures with the nuts and other crunchy bits.  It goes well with espresso.\n\nOverall, food was awesome (wagyu tartare and pork chop).  Pacing was good.  Prices are reasonable, and it's not stuffy at all despite that most of the crowd was on the older side on a Monday night.\n\nWarning: the area is not ghetto, but my car was parked right outside on Spear near Folsom around 7:30-9pm, and the back window of my SUV was smashed (I had the trunk cover on covering the contents, and no I did not place anything in the trunk after I parked).  There are plenty of people walking around, and it wasn't that late, but you never know in SF :(", "author": "Marilyn H."}

We went on a Thursday night at around 8pm, and the place was humming with activity and extremely busy- both in the bar and in the restaurant.  After a short wait to be seated (and an excellent cocktail...), we had a nice table in the dining room.\n\nWe ordered two tasty starters- a delicious heirloom tomato salad dish, and a kanpachi & melon dish (good kanpachi but the melon didn't work for me...).  My wife enjoyed scallops and I enjoyed the duck for our main courses- both were exceptional.  While the meal was great, my dessert was even better- the pumpkin br\u00fbl\u00e9e- a creative creme-brulee inspired dessert with pumpkin seed brittle.  Very creative and excellent through-and-through.  \n\nOur experience was overall a 4-star affair, the service was just as organized and exceptional as that which I have seen on my many past visits to their 'big brother' restaurant, Boulevard.  The food (and prices) are just a tick below Boulevard (and of course there is no view), but this clearly has a very active and large bar scene, and one can eat in the bar as well.  Definitely a different look, feel, and energy than Boulevard's bar...\n\nIn summary, this is a great spot for a dinner with your significant other or a cocktail after work.  The beautiful interior and layout were all a hit with me as well.  I'd take Prospect over many other restaurants I have visited in the area- compares favorably to or better than RN74, Town Hall, Salt House, Roy's, Chaya.... I will be back soon for sure.", "author": "Andy S."}

(modern, expansive, not so much the homey feel you get more at SF spots)\n\n* Monkey Bread cinnamon butter - 3.5 stars\n($8)\nSeemed like everyone in the restaurant ordered this. It's like a wonderful cinnamon roll packed in cake form, and pre-sliced. Moist and soft, delicious.\n\n* Dungeness Crab & Artichoke Omelette - 3 stars\nNot a fan of artichoke, though I'm open to it (and well made entrees have changed my mind about it in the past. This one didn't). Not the biggest fan of the egg, which was on the hard side, and made in a large flat pancake that was folded in half over the ingredients. I like omelettes where the ingredients are cooked INTO the egg better. And I like a fluffier consistency of egg. The things that made up were the crab, which was fresh & delicious, and the toast which (though slightly over-buttered) had a perfect crunch to it.\n\n* Spicy Italian Sausage - 4 stars\n(fresh italian butter beans, braised escarole, fried egg, lipstick peppers and garlic crumbs. $13.50)\nLoved the sausage. Rich, spicy but not too much. And it even has rye - which I hate. But it works here. The beans were cooked just right, and the ingredients all mixed really well together.\n\n* Prospect Burger - 3 stars\n(with fries, pepper jack cheese, house made soft bun, pickles, secret sauce. $13.50. add egg $2.00. add bacon $2.00)\nSo I was really excited about this \"secret burger\" that's off the menu, and when I asked our server she said they only have it during happy hour, and it's a patty with a special cut of pork or something. She double checked with the kitchen and voila! They can make the special burger for me! I got it and even though the bun was buttery and awesome, the meat was fantastic (though much more on the medium side of the medium-rare I asked for), it seemed like a normal burger with bacon. I asked our server, \"what is it that makes this secret burger so special again?\" and she said \"it comes with slices of bacon\" - TOTALLY not what she told us earlier! Thus the downgrade from what would've been a 4 star burger to a 3 star. I was charged an extra $2 (ON TOP of the extra $2 for bacon) for whatever made my burger \"special\", which seems like nothing at all.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-10", "description": "Being that Prospect is the sister restaurant to Boulevard I thought I'd be debating on a 4/5 star review, not a 2/3 star review. Well, to explain briefly Boulevard won the James Beard award in 2012 for outstanding restaurant which in the culinary world is top honors for a restaurant to achieve. Also, being that I've dined at Boulevard and was thoroughly impressed I thought it was a \"no-brainer\" to dine at Prospect for I thought the entire experience would be equally impressive.  How times have changed....\n\nUpon arriving at Prospect for a 7:35pm dinner reservation I was told that our table would be available momentarily. Roughly ten minutes later we were seated. During the five minutes it took to be seated by the hostess to the time I was greeted by our server I had a chance to admire the decor and overall layout of Prospect. Tall glass windows with visual access to Spear St. surrounds the restaurant.  Designer went the hip, trendy route while incorporating soft, subtle, warm tones to give the restaurant a modern feel. \n\nAfter meeting our server and receiving our standard bread and water,  I ordered the Garden Of The Infinity Cocktail. (Square One Botanical Vodka, Cucumber, Lavender, Aperol Foam). Drink was ok but somewhat of a girly drink in my opinion. Not willing to make the same mistake twice I had to just stick with thee 'ol faithful  \"Goose Cranberry\" or in bartending lingo \"Cape Cod\".  \n\nAppetizers were the Monterey Calamari & Chili Glazed Pork Belly.(Bonito Aioli, Pickled Daikon Salad, House Made Kimchi). Calamari was tasty and delightful with spicy ingredients to really engage your pallet. \n\nEntree consisted of Brandt Farm Ribeye. (Roasted Whole Baby Cauliflower, Bandage Cheddar Sauce, Heirloom Potatoes, Sauteed Bloomsdale Spinach, Baby onions, Beef Jus). Ribeye was juicy and flavorful. Prepared, seasoned, and cooked well. Potatoes, Spinach, and onions together with the Ribeye was quite delicious. \n\nFor desert, House Made Sorbets. Sangria & Mango Sorbets. The Sangria Sorbet taste exactly like a glass of Sangria. Very pronounced aftertaste. Well crafted Sangria Sorbet. The Mango Sorbet was good but a little off. Had good Mango flavor but the aftertaste tasted a bit processed. I had a taste of the Strawberry Rhubarb Crepes (Yerena Farms Strawberries, French Vanilla Ice Cream, Oat & Almond Streusel) which were absolutely incredible. The whole concept of Crepe, Strawberry, French Vanilla Ice Cream & Oat is a masterpiece.  \n\nIn conclusion, Appetizers and desert were great while the drinks and entree were good. What really swayed my decision to give Prospect a three star review versus a 4 star review and occasionally a two star review was something so very basic and crucial. Service! Service was hit or miss, delayed, and somewhat shotty at times. Our server didn't seem too enthusiastic and at times I got the vibe that she was just \"going through the motions\". In any event service is something that should never be overlooked. Without quality service a restaurant cannot function properly. I would come back but I have other restaurants to visit. By the way the restrooms are quite far if you have a table in the front of the house.", "author": "Alastair G."}

(Thank you in advance, California Bar, for taking away 2.5 months of my life, including my 25th birthday.) \n\nAs if the law school god heard me, a generous stranger (I'll call him Michael the Investment Banker) surprised me with dinner at this restaurant the very next day. I could barely contain my huge head from bobbing with excitement. Prospect did not disappoint.\n\nAll the starters were devour-worthy (crispy pig trotters! foie gras torchon!), but I was in the mood for something wonderfully slimy like the sea urchin risotto. It was creamy and savory, yet so light and zesty. My only grievance was the small portion--not everyone eats like a girl confined by a size 00 dress. Michael went for the safe and sure black cod, which was tasty but, dare I say, dull compared to the uni. Unlike this banker, I take the same approach to food as I do with investments--with risk.\n \nFor mains I had the liberty duck and Michael had the veal chop. Besides the $13 roast duck I get in Chinatown, this has to be one of the best ducks I've ever eaten. It was like a Tchaikovsky symphony of flavors and textures--glazed turnips, pickled grapes, pistachios, rum raisin puree, very good and memorable stuff. The veal chop was juicy, tender, and monstrously large. Normally I'm \"that girl\" that picks at her dining companion's plate but not this time: my liberty duck was liberty-ringing delicious, Sleeping Beauty-waking great.\n\nDon't even think about skipping the cocktails. Despite bearing cheesy names like Love Potion and November in NY, they're so complex, balanced and delectable.\n\nBoulevard is one of my favorite restaurants, but sometimes it can be old and stuffy. That's why I love its modern, sleek, and younger sister, Prospect. I'll likely be schmoozing at Boulevard when I'm a 50-year-old equity partner, but until then I foresee frequent associate happy hours at Prospect.

The shellfish was cooked perfectly as was the risotto and the foam added a little citrus.  There were three pieces of scallop and lobster each.  For my entree I had the duck three ways.  Unfortunately the chef wasn't satisfied with the presse so he didn't want to serve it so I got an extra half piece of duck sausage making it only duck two ways.  That said, I appreciate a chef who will not send out subpar food.  The duck breast was fantastic.  The skin was crispy and the meat tender.  The sauces were a carrot puree and something savory.  They were wonderful.  The duck sausage was was also quite tasty.  I wish the presse had been up to par.  Dessert was caramel popcorn with cacao nibs.  It was a perfect ending for me.", "author": "Heather S."}

Go back a bit more, and you enter the dining room with their nice pieces of artwork and table set ups.\n\nChoice of Water: Tap or Sparkling, complimentary for both.\n\nWhat I had the privilege try:\n\nSeared Day Boat Scallops with truffle shavings and potato Gnochi: The scallop was cooked perfectly on this dish and its flavored enhanced by the truffle sauce and the truffle shavings. Not to mention the potato gnochi was nice and fluffy and soaked up the truffle sauce to top it off.\n\nSeared Monterey Abalone with Crispy Pig Trotters: The highlight of the dish was truly the crispy pig trotters. If they made a dish of that alone, I'd be all over it. The trotters were nice and crispy and was a mountain of flavor in your mouth. The abalone wasn't too bad either, but it was overshadowed by the trotters. Still a solid dish nonetheless.\n\nSnake Rivver Farm Kobe Bavette: This was my first time having bavette but I am a true believer now. The meat was so tender and juicy that it really melted in my mouth. Along with the mushrooms and potatos, it made for a well prepared dish.\n\nLocal King Salmon with Crispy Skin. The salmon was well cooked and full of flavor and was only made better with the addition of the nice and crispy skin.\n\nLiberty Valley Duck breast: the duck was cooked just the way i like it with the fat and nice tender bites. The flavor was all soaked into it and every bite released the juices of satisfaction.\n\nDessert: Unfortunately they just stopped serving the ice cream sandwiches the week before so we tried the Chocolate Praline Bonbons with Valrhona Fudgesicle, Caramel Cream, candied rice crispies, and chocolate sabayon\n\nI enjoyed the dessert very much. The rice crispies went great with the caramel cream and sauces on the plate. The bonbons themselves were deliciously chocalatey (emphasis on the chocolate part) and would satisfy any chocolate lover. Although i was looking for a softer middle (like vanilla ice cream filled bon bons), the more solid chocolate middle wasn't too bad either.\n\n\nAlthough the food was all fine and dandy, my only qualm was the plates weren't warm coming out and the food on the dish was at best luke warm.

But I am never one deterred by the environment, it is the food I am there for. \n\nThe sea urchin risotto was good. Not great, as the flavor of the rich, deep ocean of uni didn't quite come through as much as I had hoped. But it was good. Decorated with bright lemon-flavored seared bay scallops. \n\nM ordered a foie gras torchon, which was the downhill direction this dinner took. It was SALTY. The first bite was burst of flavor, the second was salty, and the third was inedible. What tasted like over salted olive juice overwhelmed our palettes. I have not drank this much water in my entire life. \n\nThen came the main courses. M had a goat three-way, which were mediocre. They relied on the sauce heavily to bring taste from the meat that is in itself bland. The sauce was too salty, btw. \n\nMy beef zabuton was awful. It was a pretty piece of meat, but the rub was insanely salty. So were the farro and the broccoli rabe. I wanted to hang my tongue out to catch the moisture in the air because my mouth simply cannot stand the saltiness. \n\nIt was so bad, I sent the dish back. Which I have never done ever before. And opted for the black cod appetizer, which was alright, I suppose. But after my tongue has been raped by the salt monster, there isn't much I can taste anymore. \n\nWhen I apologized for sending the dish back, the waitress said \"it's ok, some people are just more sensitive\". M and I looked at each other, and looked at the seemingly happy diners around us, and feel like complete crazy people. How is this sensitivity? It was like drinking the dead fricking sea!\n\n\nNever again. Maybe it's just a bad night. Maybe our dishes were prepared by the heavy handed line cook who managed all meats and have been too busy to taste what he prepared. But it s unacceptable.

So when my all-time favorite restaurant, Boulevard's \"sister\" restaurant opened I was one of the first through the door. It has gone through some growing pains over the last couple of years since its inception, but it has fully matured to be the little sister that gets noticed.  \n\n    This is apparent as you walk down Folsom Street and are struck by the sensuous display of back lit stone vases enticing one into the bar to explore their upbeat specialty cocktails.  Sometimes we just meet friends for tasting treats at the large wood communal table between the bar and the dining room, and have never been disappointed, they make even Deviled Eggs a delicacy.\n \n    Pamela Mazzola's signature style is all over the new menu, which changes all the time, so your favorite item most likely won't be there next time, but you will find something you'll like equally as well. \n\n    Recently we had the Monterey Bay Abalone, something I don't see often enough on menus, it was cooked perfectly and accented with a hint of chili for a little surprise.  Bavette is one of my favorite cuts of meat, and they prepare it in a classic way with all the comfort food fixings.  I always make sure to leave room for dessert, it's hard to choose just one to split with my hubby, last time we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and luckily he let me eat most of it.\n\n    I have yet to have tried them for lunch, will soon though, and I noticed they have a \"Grab & Go\" Sandwich menu, which should give those gourmet food trucks a run for their money. \n\n    Prospect has a younger crowd and vibe than its \"older sister\", but I like it when I'm looking for a more contemporary dining experience, the wait staff are casual yet attentive, and I like how the oversize pieces of original art changes from time to time, displayed on their expansive sized museum walls.  \n\n    P.S.

Finally came here last week week with my brokenhearted girlfriend. The place is huge, capacity of 385, modern, but very commercialized, not intimate at all, usually it's not my kind of place. However, the chef Ravi Kapur is a well-known and I was excited to see what he has in the kitchen.  \n\n         My blogger Chuckeats told me to order the beet salad and anything meat. So I came with certain dishes in mind.  I also brought in the 1994 Clos du Marquis Saint-Julien by Ch\u00e2teau L\u00e9oville Las Cases I got it at K & L Wine. The server came over, read the bottle & replaced our table with nicer glasses for Bordeaux. I appreciated that!\n\n        The place was jam packed like sardines in the can on a FRI night. Most people dressed casual, lots of big group and the noise level was high. Although enough spaces between tables, but we still had to raise our voices a bit to talk to each other.\n\n- Hand Picked Dungeness Crab - chilled beets, vadouvan yogurt, spiced onion rings - as my blogger told me, this dish was right on, refreshing, such a surprisingly pleasant dish to share.\n\n- Sea Urchin Risotto - nantucket bay scallops, maine lobster, meyer lemon - very generous dish, but the risotto was cool, so it was thicken, we picked out the seafood, and left the risotto there. I did mentioned the chef when he came by the table.\n\n-  Roasted Quail- gnocchi, crispy veal sweetbreads, black chanterelles - generous dish, the quail was perfectly pink inside, full of flavor; and the sweetbreads were just simply perfect. \n\n- McCormack Ranch Goat artichokes, braised butter beans, black garbanzo-black garlic sauce, gremolata - I asked the server to choose a dish for us to pair with our wine. I told him I wanted something bold and he ordered this goat this for us. It cooked perfect and was tasty, you can even use the sauce as dipping. \n\n- We had Porto for dessert!\n\n          The food was right on the tasty, except for the cold risotto dish. All other dishes were generous portions to share. Chef Ravi Kapur came by to say hello. He was very nice. I think it's incredible to have a resto this big of capacity, how the kitchen can be consistent? And how the chef can be attentive to each dish that brought out? I'm just saying, it's a big job for the chef. \n\n          Our server was attentive to us. Overall it was a good meal, although the place just too big for my taste.

Not a problem, they seated us at our table, we ordered some cocktails (the diabla and the prospector - both delicious) and waited. It probably helped that there were plenty of open tables in the restaurant, but no one seemed even the slightest bit annoyed that there were just 2 of us at a 5 person table. \n\nThen everyone else arrived and we ordered. The menu changes almost daily, but our server knew everything. They were amazingly accommodating when I requested my dish sans-mushrooms and substituted mustard mashed potatoes. Likewise with the olive-haters at the table.\n\nOut came the heirloom tomato and burrata cheese with a pesto drizzle. It was absolutely phenomenal. The halibut tartare with tiny chunks of tomato and watermelon with crispy rice chips? OMG. The Goddess salad (I think that's what it was called) was the only slight disappointment as I felt like I could have made it at home. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not quite as inventive as the other dishes which seemed to surprise me at every bite.\n\nOn to the entrees! The scallops were a popular dish at our table served on farro grain with crispy little chip things. The scallops were melt in your mouth unbelievable. SO good. We also had 1 duck and 1 salmon. I had a bite of each and was impressed. Everyone at the table was raving about the food, it seems anything on the menu is a safe bet. \n\nThe wine list is pretty extensive and well organized. It skews a bit pricey, but so does the restaurant so I guess no surprises there. The som was able to give us a really good recommendation, though I felt she was a little bit stuffy compared to the more friendly service we were getting from everyone else. \n\nWhich brings me to my last point, service was outstanding. \n\nIt's a really nice restaurant and that means it's a little bit pricey, but in my opinion it is 100% worth it.", "author": "Rachel E."}

The decor is contemporary, and lots of windows help create a nice open feeling.

I feel that this must be where all the old money in SF must come, as I don't think I've ever seen as many patrons over the age of 60 eating in one place, with most of the men in sports jackets or suits. (I swear one of them was Aaron Spelling...) Eating here reminded me of being back in NY, as the high ceilings and tasteful shades of tan/gold and greys/black made this place seem regal and sophisticated. That being said, this is not a particularly quiet restaurant.\n\nFrom the date experience, I had the duck liver mousse which was served with rectangular logs of toasted potato bread(?), which was not surprisingly a great vehicle for delivering the rich and creamy concoction. The sticky chicken wings are reminiscent of Bonchon or any other decently-spiced Korean fried chicken. From the cocktail menu, the Domino Effect is like a slightly spicy spiked apple cider, a great choice when chilled to the bone but not so wise an option immediately after working out and on a first date.\n\nFrom dining in the main room, we shared a bottle of wine that I sampled and was not particularly keen on but felt somewhat pressured by the sommelier to accept. (Never again!) A friend and I shared the seared abolone which would've been better if there was more of it to go around; the tomatillo puree and gin & cucumber emulsion helped make this a fresher and lighter dish than it otherwise would've been. Our other friends shared the burrata, which is hard to mess up. I had the skate wing, which was cooked perfectly but over-salted (is it just me, or does everyone over-salt skate?!) over a celery root puree that needed some salt for itself.\n\nI'd be willing to give this place a second chance as a dinner option, but overall I'm much more interested in ordering everything from the bar and people-watching for the rare SF celebrity sighting.", "author": "Gene C."}

The broth was so good my aunt took a piece of bread and soaked some of the juices up! \n\nEntree I had was the Double Veal Chop. It was HUGE!! Very good and my dad thoroughly nawed on the bone to get every last morsel. He had the chicken- super moist! Sis had the Waygu Zabuton. YUM! Who can go wrong with Waygu?? Auntie had the Goat 4 ways. Definitely loved the goat chop. The meatball and goat shoulder were too gamey for my taste. The Sea Scallops my mom got were cooked perfectly. \n\nDessert was the BESTTT part! They have the BEST s'mores I have ever tasted. Peppermint infused into the marshmallow and homemade choco sauce and homemade graham cracker! Usually s'mores have a really hard outside graham cracker and that is why I don't like to eat it. These s'mores are so delicious. I could eat a boatload. Ice cream sammies were delish as well.

It WAS a great place, incredible staff and so welcoming. \nTHAT CHANGED two days ago, Thursday 12/18 around 9:20pm....\nWe went there with a group of 10 people, I had called Amanda to reserve a table in advance. Then when we arrived, we asked to sit in the bar area, have drinks and apps. When the gentlemen came to offer us menus he promptly said, 'I will serve you food but not alcohol,' What? Are you serious?\nI was completely dumbfounded. What transpired after that is beyond comprehension. I have NEVER seen such incompetence from the manager/GM. They said to our friend, who lives next door and frequents this place regularly, that they wouldn't serve us because someone smelled like alcohol. What? What does that mean and no one was intoxicated, perhaps 1 or 2 had a couple drinks, call that buzzed but not drunk. We left, of course. We were all beyond livid. Then as if that wasn't enough...the minute we left I looked in the window and the GM WAS LAUGHING, laughing with her staff.\nProspect has not only lost a long-term customer, I will make it my mission to let others know the kind of treatment you can expect.

The sommelier was knowledgeable and attentive. The service was generally good - but this place needs to \"get over itself\". \n\nOne of our party is vegan and ordered the radish salad without the bread crumbles. Seems pretty simple...not so simple. What followed was a litany of excuses ranging from the pretentious to the absurd.\n\nFirst the server returned saying the Chef would not do the dish without the crumbles because it ruined the presentation. We decided to risk the aesthetic trauma.\n\nThen the manager came out and brought a picture to show us how integral the crumbles were to the dish. Seriously how could we be so gauche. When we explained that the request was based on a wheat allergy we were told to order something else, but we were never brought a menu. Apparently we were suppose to memorize the menu.\n\nThen the same dish was actually brought to another person in our party. The crumbles were just added on top. Not rocket science to skip the crumbles. \n\nWhen we pointed this out to the manager she then said that they misunderstood and could make it without the crumbles. Wait, not done yet. \n\nThen Chef came out and explained that the radish salad had radishes saut\u00e9ed with bread.\n\nOk, the fourth version of why we couldn't get this salad made some sense, and finally the Chef did offer to make a gluten free salad. It's really too bad they didn't start this way, because at this point the vegan diner was so put off she didn't eat at all.\n\nMoral of the story. Come here to eat and be grateful. Don't speak. Don't question and above all don't even think about altering the perfection that they place on a plate. Anaphylaxis is preferred to adulteration of any food combination. You're only the customer and in the relative scheme of things that's not worth much here.", "author": "Max V."}

I love food, and although the restaurant choice was not as important as business, I felt that business had to be done in a fashionable manner.\n\nNo Asian food, Chinese New Years is around the corner!\n\nProspect's dessert menu enticed me. Is there a word stronger than \"entice\"? Lured, seduce? Whatever, I am no English major.\n\nSo here is where we came. Just a few blocks away from the Embarcadero station, I shuffled my feet in my 4 inched heels to get there as quickly as possible, I was late. Unprofessional.\n\nWe were promptly seated and my feet clacked loudly on the ground. Clackity, clack, clack went gold Charles David.\n\nThe waitress swung by our table several times, only to be asked to come back later. When we finally decided on what we wanted to eat, the waitress had given us until the end of the world to order. I felt like a meager child in a third world country, so I drank glasses after glasses of water. Did I mention they have opaque black cups? I was too impressed.\n\nOnto the bread and butter. They give you a cup of butter and there is a man walking around with a tray of bread. The butter tastes like vanilla ice cream! It has a bit of sea salt sprinkled on top, so eating it with the focaccia is a recipe for high blood pressure. With the roll? So delightful. I think I ate four pieces of bread and generously slathered on the butter. The butter must have some kind of secret ingredient because I have never had such delicious butter. I was going nuts because the guy was not pacing by my table enough, I wanted more bread with my butter!\n\nMy appetizer was the roasted quail. I also had some of his calamari and octopus. Quail was an interesting taste, and not the bad kind. I'm not usually the adventurous type when it comes to food, but fine dining pushes me out of my comfort zone. This was good, I enjoyed my grilled quail. I also liked the spaetzle and other stuffs that came with it. The octopus had an interesting texture, though probably not the kind I would fancy. Calamari was yummy.\n\nEntrees were: California Halibut & Dayboat Scallops. California halibut, I really really enjoyed. Everything. Well, maybe not the garnish, but I always hate the garnish. The fish was crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. My knife over-butchered it. Paired with the hollandaise, I don't think I would have wanted anything else. Scallops were also very delicious, much better than the scallops I usually have at the Koi Palace. My, my.\n\nThen came dessert, the most anticipated part (well, on my end), and my favorite. Dessert took way too long, and I wanted it too badly. He told me he was not a dessert person, and that I could pick any two dishes I wanted and eat both. So I ordered the Mexican Chocolate Creme Brulee with churros and S'mores. It was a tough decision to make. When I took a bite out of the s'more.. Oh lawdy, oh lawdy. I think I might have peed my pants a bit out of excitement. Buttery cracker with housemade marshmallows with liquidy chocolate dripping all over my plate. Yeeeees. The creme brulee was chocolatey and moussey, yet not too sweet. Dipping the churros in was the cherry on top. Generally, I would consider myself a modest person, but in this case? As if!\n\nDessert was killer, #1 on my list.\n\nWhy only 4 stars? Service is mediocre.

A beautiful loft space decorated with warm tones, post modern decorations, filled with well dressed patrons, and a beautiful hum of polite conversation. To find out that it was opened by the team that conceived Boulevard, is not entirely surprising. \n\nMy coworker who lives in the city had chosen this place for dinner, and I was happy that she had. It was a Thursday night, and we had found parking relatively easily. She had also made a reservation so that getting seated wasn't an issue.\n\nTo drink, I would have liked to say I had the Catcher in the Rye (rye whiskey, amontillado sherry, amer, grand marnier, abbots bitters) , just because I adore the book, but alas I ended up ordering the Prospector (thomas waugh scotch, madeira, benedictine, bitters, burnt orange). I'm not sure how with age one just end up preferring scotch, whiskey, and bourbon to cocktails, but now I have fallen into that camp as well. The drink was smooth and refreshing to sip on slowly. \n\nFor an appetizer I had the corn soup, I didn't read carefully enough or I would have realized it came with duck in the center of the soup. It might have been slightly too heavy for what I was looking for that night, nevertheless it was cooked to perfection. \n\nFor main course I ordered the wagyu beef. I was going to order the scallops but since both my dining companions ordered the beef, I figured I shouldn't waiver from the course. It was served with butterball potatoes, creamed cippolinis, smoked trumpet mushrooms, spinach, mustard seed jus. The beef I ordered medium rare was divine. Delicious marbling ensured that each piece was so soft and tasty.\n\nFor dessert I had the Asian Pear Tartine. It was not bad as far as desserts go, since I don't generally have a sweet tooth. The subtleness of the pear is a really nice palette cleanser.\n\nI was impressed with Prospect, I would definitely go back for both dinner and to try the brunch which everyone is raving about.", "author": "Jessica C."}

I have already written one review and seriously question the ownership and hiring of the incapable staff I ran into on thursday night (12/18). We showed up with a group of 10 people for dinner and have never been treated so poorly in my life. We had reservations for 10 and waited in the bar where we were informed we could not be served due to some people being \"intoxicated\" by Kaeka who was one of the top 10 worst service workers I have ever seen. Our situation was then escalated to the manager, Cathy, who tried but was so indecisive and turned it back on me saying I \"smelled like alcohol\". Hmmm, I told her I just had a holiday cocktail party at my place next door...so of course I did (a few glasses of wine now gets you on the do not serve list??).  Most of us had a couple glasses of wine and were refused service!!!!   Yes, at 9pm, after a couple glasses of wine, we were refused.  Not one person acted out.  I can't say again how pathetic both Cathy and Kaeka were.  Smelling my breath and refusing to serve our entire group???  Are you kidding???  ....at 9pm during the holidays?  I think she needs to get off her pedestal and stop playing GOD!!!!  Cathy, you don't deserve to be in the service business!!!\n\nThe group of 10 of us walked to Ozumo and ended up taking out $1500 tab elsewhere.  I can't stress enough....STAY AWAY!!!!!!   There are way better places in SF.  They only reason I went back is the convenience of being next door...not any more.  I will put in the extra effort to avoid ever having to speak to people like Cathy and Kaeka.\n\nHappy Holidays to us :)  Here's to hoping Prospect changes ownership and hires a real staff.

It can be done thanks to the thoughtful staff who toil here without breaking a sweat. I am not a master of forethought, and in an impulsive move, I simply decided that Jamie W. and I should enjoy the quietly ballyhooed Prospect last Friday. I called to find we could try our luck at the bar or the community table. Fifteen minutes later, we showed up to find a bustling bar scene, and the hostess immediately seated us at a table for two next to the window across from the community table. Nice.\n\nIt's a cavernous addition to the dining scene, and in its third month of operation, enthusiasm has not abated. I can see why. Not only is it spacious in Prospect but it also offers a nice, manageable menu of neo-American creations that feel traditional and contemporary at the same time. For starters, Jamie ordered the $14 Seared Octopus & Calamari, which came with mussels on top of Venetian black rice in a saffron broth (see photo). The usually tough texture of the octopus was tenderized just enough to complement the squid in ways that surprised me, and the saffron brought a savory flavor that didn't overpower the seafood. I went with the $13 Heirloom Tomatoes, quartered and accompanied by bellwether fromage blanc and rustic, crunchy Caesar croutons with sprigs of arugula leaves laid on top (see photo). The sweetness of the tomatoes brought an intensity of flavor that was unusually compelling. \n\nEntrees were impressively presented. I was immediately drawn to the $24 Pork Belly & Cheek, which came with an assortment of flavors and textures - a confit fennel, diced Jonathan apple, slices of preserved oranges, scarlet turnips and \"ancient grains\" (looks like a mix of rice, barley and more unique relatives) (see photo). It worked somehow even if the pork portions were a bit paltry. Jamie scored by getting the $29 Wagyu Zabuton, a more straightforward presentation that encompassed butterball potatoes, creamed cippolinis (very unique), smoked trumpet mushrooms, spinach, and mustard seed jus (see photo). The beef was savory-tender, and everything else fell into place. Surprisingly, it was the dessert course where things slightly faltered. \n\nJamie ordered the $9 JB's French Toast, a clever twist on a breakfast dish that combined cornflake-crusted pain (bread) perdu, elephant heart plums (the best touch), candied hazelnuts and hazelnut gelato (see photo). For me, the taste was more predictable than tantalizing with the hazelnut flavor the overly dominant player here. Mine was an outright miss, the $8 Ice Cream Sandwiches, which consisted of four large cubes of frozen raspberry rocky road ice cream surrounded by a soft chocolate cookie (see photo). The overly fastidious flavor of the ice cream just seemed at odds with the home-style concept. It was like an \"It's-It\" that lost its way toward satisfying flavor. In fact, I would have preferred a straightforward \"It's-It\" with one consistent flavor. \n\nBut for the most part, Prospect was first-class. Housed in the shiny Infinity Towers, the food and decor match very well toward an upscale dining experience that aspires to be on the same level as Nancy Oakes' inarguable gold standard, Boulevard. With a few tweaks here and there, especially on the desserts, executive chef Ravi Kapur and his crew may just get there. I'll be happy to come back in a few months when I can collect enough shekels to try Prospect again. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...appetizers and entrees are close to stellar, desserts disappoint on the margins \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...contemporary elegance...a little more \"character\" touches could warm the place up and make it feel less generically upscale \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...genuinely thoughtful staff from front to back \nTOTAL - 4 stars...the possibilities of a fifth star appear within grasp", "author": "Ed U."}

Hence my empty savings account but wealthy closet. \n\nOn my last evening in San Francisco, our group decided to go out with a bang and we giddily chose Prospect. From the moment our motley crew walked in...we knew that we were going to be served by this sleek and refined dining mecca. My taste buds will never be the same again.\n\nAlthough our large group of 10 didn't have reservations, the hosts immediately went into preparation and had our table ready for us in less than 15 minutes. Our cocktails and wine were delivered within moments and the presentation began. Robin, our server was BEYOND professional and not only informed us of the specialties but made a special request to the kitchen for an enchanting Vegan dish for myself. The detail put into my impromptu mushroom risotto ($24) was impeccable and the taste was nothing short of divine. The wait staff was always buzzing around the table to make sure that our every whim was addressed and taken care of.\n\nOur table also ordered several appetizers and salads that included the notable Green Goddess Salad ($11) and the Heirloom Tomatoes ($13). The apparent freshness of the ingredients were very much appreciated!\nWe also literally ordered every dessert off of the menu and although I was limited to non-dairy, I was still able to enjoy a few delectable treats. The Asian Pear Tartine ($9), Black and Tan ($10), and JB's French Toast ($9) were all well worth the extra calories!\n\nLastly, the wine was AMAZING. I ordered a couple of glassed of the 2007 Skylark Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah ($15) and was daydreaming the night away. Not a frugal glass but well worth every gulp!\n\nThis is a fabulous place to bring anyone that you may want to impress or better yet.... request to go if you know they are trying to impress you.", "author": "Marcia M."}

Goat is evidently like lamb, but not quite as gamey or chewy, or flavorful. One of the cuts seemed to include goat belly or something that looked like bacon, but wasn't quite as yummy.\n\nThe duck, though, holy crap that was awesome.\n\nDessert was the ice cream sandwich, which was homemade and reeked of mint when biting in.

Well there's a lot more to this place, but they won my heart when I started the evening with Trotter Totts and my Coca Pisco Sour at their cleverly designed bar.  Let me tell you that it was an explosion of sinful goodness from the Trotter Totts that led us to ask they had availability for two in the dining room.\n\nWe finally decided to go have dinner we were seated in a beautiful dining room with a lot of Earth tones and elements.  This just makes you want to stay here until the next morning.  The menu was just right, and what I mean by that is it has all your basics for starters - salads, seafood, meats and more meats.  It was the same idea for the entrees.\n\nSo as I stared at the menu with my eyes glued to the deep fried trotters, my adventure here began.  We ordered the Crispy Pig Trotters and the Seared Calamari and Octopus w/ chorizo crumbles.  Delicious and complex.  It is really hard to explain the complexity and elements of pieces of lobster placed on top of the deep fried trotters. Maybe \"heavenly bliss\".  And the Seared Calamari and Octopus w/ chorizo crumbles blew away my palate with the right amount of sweetness from the fresh seafood and the salty bite from the chorizo crumbles.  Awesome.  Both of these starters are out of this world, but because I'm a meat eater I'd suggest trying the Crispy Pig Trotters.\n\nNow things get better when our seconds seamlessly placed on the table.  When I mean seamless, it feels like I'm having dinner at Delmonico's or Fleur De Lys with at least 3 servers to make your experience ever so enjoyable.  Well back to our seconds, she ordered the Braised Pork Cheeks w/ rye berries and spaetzle and I had the Wagyu Zabuton.  Yes I love pork, but since she ordered the pork dish I had to have the beef.  Hmmm?  What is this buttery meaty taste that melts in my mouth? The Braised Pork Cheeks was cooked to perfection with explosive flavors rendering in your mouth. I would have asked for more of their foccaccia and spread the buttery pork cheeks over it and just have it like that. YUM!  And the Wagyu  Zabuton was another melt in your mouth food orgasm.\n\n I have to stop here because I'm just getting that urge to go there tonight.  You're just going to have to make a trip down there and try their beautifully designed drinks and elegantly flavorful food.

For a restaurant to have such a grandness about itself I hoped that the food could elicit such favorable emotions. The food is well presented and properly cooked but it feels like someone is merely pushing buttons in the correct order. Although there are some subtle variations on familiar dishes, the menu is uninspired. The food alone would probably be about three stars yet the service drops it down a notch. I haven't seen such condescension like this anywhere in a long time. I cringed every time our waiter stopped by our table. It was actually a relief when our waiter stopped coming by halfway through our service. He only showed up again because we flagged him down to take our dessert order (I wanted to leave after dinner). The one standout dish was the foie gras with strawberries. However if you can't make foie gras taste good then you should quit early. Immensely overpriced.", "author": "Michael H."}

The meat was juicy and the presentation was fit for a queen. My date had the fish and from what he shoveled in my mouth, it was pretty damn tasty.

I thought the pairing of the pumpkin bread spices with the orange white chocolate ganache was unique and delicious, especially when paired with the salted caramel sauce (yay sweet & savory!).  I was a little leery of the pomegranate sorbet, but it actually worked very well.  Bonus points for having the slightly brulee'd bread pudding cake tops.

The food is good, but nothing life changing (especially with that price tag)...so 3.5 stars it is.\n\nWe ordered:\n--Prospect Eggs Benedict ($14.5) -- a pretty decent benedict but served with 2 pieces of SUPER YUMMY pork belly.  I also appreciated that it came w/ lots of cream spinach and not too much hollandaise sauce.  Felt slightly healthier -- thought can't be quite sure...\n--Prospector ($16) -- basically a big breakfast platter - 1 pork apple sausage, few strips of bacon, eggs, 2 corn cakes, and home fries.  Eggs were very tasty and bacon was of good quality -- but nothing call home about...  I think corn-cake lovers would appreciate Prospect's version as my bf loved it -- but I'm not big on corn meal treats so can't judge.\n--Monkey Bread ($8) -- it's their signature.  Kind of like 7 super-doughy donut holes wedged in a circle pan, and drizzled with cinnamon-butter-sticky-goodness.  It's definitely a treat if you've never had it.\n\nThe waitress looked like Rachel Weiss and was the nicest.  Only problem was that we waited a good 45 mins for our food, gave us the wrong check, and told us \"good night\" as we left at 2pm -- but they were very very apologetic with the wait and gave us zucchini bread on the house. Ms. Weiss must have just had an off day --so I forgive and forget!  \n\nAll in all, it won't make my top 10 list given SF is brunch haven, but it's a solid place for brunch if you are in the SOMA area.", "author": "Kendra W."}

This is an updated version of Boulevard  and a sister restaurant.  The food was great overall and the service was friendly.\n\nBefore we could order we asked our server to run down the menu because (and this is a common problem for me) I just am not imaginative enough to translate a list of ingredients to actual taste and texture in my head.  I wish menus would list a few descriptors to help with this process, but that is for another time.  The point is, our server was very accommodating in obliging our request and we each ended up with food we were very happy with.\n\nWe shared two appetizers, yellow tail crudo and potato dumplings.  We loved the potato dumplings, which were not your usual gnocchi but more like potato mochi, soft and well paired with everything on the plate.  Two of us got the Wagyu beef and at medium rare it was melt-in-your-mouth tender with buttery sweet reduction sauce.  One friend got the halibut served atop a puree of carrots and the vibrant color induced happiness just looking at it.\n\nAfter the main course we shared the Bing cherries for dessert (on the house for the birthday treat) and I loved it for the interesting combination of poached cherries, pavlova (meringue), and frozen greek yogurt, which added pleasant tanginess.  The server who brought it out even said, \"Happy 23rd Birthday!\"  with a smile, bless his heart.\n\nWe liked the contemporary decor in the open space, and the place was pretty full even though it was during the week.  We lingered after the meal and the dessert and did not feel pressured to leave.

The restaurant was really spacious and the hostess was super bubbly & friendly.\n\nHere's what we had:\n- Strawberry Shortcake Scone: w/ creme fraiche & fresh strawberries. (P.S. Creme fraiche will always remind me of Southpark) The shortcake scone tasted like a huge snicker-doodle. The scone was fluffy and crispy at the same time. I also loved the fresh strawberries!\n- Short Rib & Smoked Potato Hash: Short ribs were tender, the hash was super flavorful but could have been a tad bit crispier. I'm also a huge fan of shishito peppers so that was icing on the cake.\n- Tomato & Burrata Tartine: The Burrata, basil, tomato reminded me of a caprese salad. The prosciutto was delish and the italian batard was crispy and perfect. The confit garlic scramble was great on flavor but so-so on consistency.\n\nEach dish was ~ $14, which is pretty reasonable.

Nonetheless, I feel their service and quality of food is worth talking about.\n\nBefore I begin, you should know that Prospect is one of those restaurants where you should be ready to dish out a good amount of $ for a meal. Yet, I'm often surprised when people complain about price, as if they just popped into the restaurant during a stroll around the neighborhood. The menu is available online and the decor is swanky enough so that you know you're not going to get dollar tacos here. \n\nWe had a party of over 20 for a birthday party and they were able to accommodate all of us, albeit it took a while for us to get seated even with reservations. Once we were seated, I dived into the menu and ordered a couple appetizers that I cannot remember. This only means that I didn't think they were that great. Another person at our table however ordered the gnocchi which was excellent - warm, soft, delicious. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the special for that night, which was goat. Half our party ordered the same thing and I, along with everyone else, thought it was an excellent dish. We enjoyed it so much that the people who didn't order goat was regretting their choice. Hehehe. I love it when that happens.\n\nNext, we had dessert, my favorite part of a meal. I ordered a caramel cake of some sort that I no longer can find on their menu. Amazing. Best caramel cake I have ever had. I was practically melting on my seat. And this is coming from someone who has a major sweet tooth.\n\nFinally, I'd like to give thanks to the waiter who helped us.

But the nausea set in before I even had a chance to order a cocktail. I had brought in a beautiful chocolate cake for my dear friend's birthday, which we were celebrating at Prospect.  Upon my arrival I asked the hostess if she knew who our server would be for the meal (we came early for drinks and the group was still at the bar), as I wanted to be sure the cake got into the correct hands. She then asked me if I was aware of their cakeage fee (yes, that is a real thing in case you are wondering). I said I was not (as it is not listed anywhere on their website), but that I understand some restaurants do charge for bringing in an outside cake. At which point I said, \"No problem, do you mind me asking how much your cakeage fee is?\" - to which she answered, \"It's eight dollars a slice.\" $8 a SLICE!?!?! You must be joking! That is the most obscene fee I have ever heard. She assured me that it was a great presentation, with ice cream. EIGHT DOLLARS????? No way. I have heard of $2, at the absolutely max $4. But what are my options? I am standing there with a cake for the birthday girl, so I said fine, but be sure to put it on a separate check and present it to me only.  There were 14 people in our party, so in the end, my cakeage bill came to $115 - yep,  they taxed it.  Not to mention they botched the cake presentation as well. \n\nMy beautiful dinner with wine service was only $89 before gratuity, so color me confused.   \n\nAll in all, I would have rated the dinner and service quite high, but I just can't do it due to the ridiculousness of the cakeage fee.  \n\nTo boot, I also happen to book high-end group dinners for a living, but I certainly won't be booking them at Prospect any longer.

We were given a table at the back of the restaurant which got us away from most of the noise in Prospect's cavernous space.  Our waiter was calm, professional, and good humored...taking our tendency to talk with our friends--rather than pay attention to our menus--in stride.  The food was delicious and, important for large parties, well timed.  The kitchen was obviously working hard to ensure that all the food was hot and that nobody got left behind.\n\nThe only aspect of our dinner where Prospect dropped the ball was in our attempt to connect with the sommelier to pre-arrange the wine selections.  After an initial contact, our email with some initial thoughts and selections was ignored.  A request to have the sommelier contact us by phone?  Likewise ignored.  So, on the evening of the party, we were left to fend for ourselves.  Consequently, two of three selections, a total of four bottles, were big hits.  The third, the most expensive bottle we chose, a roaring dud!  And, had Prospect's sommelier deigned to work with us, we might have avoided an expensive mistake.\n\nOn the whole though...great food, pleasant atmosphere, an extensive wine selection, contributed to a wonderful, if not quite perfect evening at Prospect.", "author": "Kvatch K."}

If I took you there it generally meant that I really liked you :) \n\nWhen I found out that they were expanding into a new venture, I was excited. Then came the wait. It seemed like the announcement had been forever ago. Well the time has arrived. Prospect has opened its doors. \n\nThe space in the Infinity building is quite stunning. The entrance is flanked by the reception station to the right and a large lounge couch to the left. Past those two is the open four sided bar that was packed to the hilt with patrons. As you make it past the bar, there a nice row of seats in the middle and a slew of windows next to the large format windows where we were seated. There's a sleek private dining room in the very back. Unfortunately the kitchen is also hidden in the back so you don't get to witness the cooking in action. \n\nWe started off with a handful of the house cocktails and a bottle of Txakoli.

Being the first day open to the public, the only thing that seemed a little off was the timing. The appetizer line may have kicked a little too much ass as our appetizers came out really quickly, and then there was a long gap before the entrees. The food however was cooked very well. Servers/Sommelier were very knowledgeable about the food and wines. The host staff was also very friendly. Aside from the pacing I think it was very good debut for a place so big.

I'm kicking myself for not visiting sooner.\n\nThe food is damn tasty. It's not too fussy -- yes, I spied a foam on the sockeye salmon dish, but that's about as frou-frou as it got. Instead, even with a few exotic ingredients here and there, the preparations and presentation were solidly grounded in simplicity. \n\nFor starters, the meat eater in me was tempted to order the crispy pig trotters and buffalo carpaccio, but I ended up getting the dayboat scallops with diced bianca eggplant, sweet 100 cherry tomatoes, pine nuts and golden raisins. And with only a few weeks left in the summer, we couldn't pass up the heirloom tomatoes with Bellwether fromage blanc, arugula and Caesar croutons. Neither was huge, but they did their job: They whetted our appetites for the main courses.\n\nEnter the meat. We ordered the wagyu zabuton with smoked king trumpet mushrooms, spinach and mustard seed jus and the lamb loin and rib with butter beans, feta, olives, summer peppers and spigarello. (The pork cheek & belly looked inviting, too, but our server told us we couldn't order it without the accompanying ancient grains -- even after my Paleo-eating wife lied and told him she has a gluten allergy.)\n\nAgain, the portions looked small, but they were perfectly (and surprisingly) filling -- especially the mouth-filling, perfectly-marbled cubes of wagyu beef.

The entire Restaurant was phenomenon and not a single detail was left unfinished; from the French doors to the silver ware to the art work all around. We were really impressed. We were quickly seated after valet and coat check-in - major plus. After some time looking over the thought-out menu, we decided to go with a couple bottles of wine, appetizers and dinner choice. The presentation of each meal was set to perfection. The taste of each bite was orgasmic. We had a good time, chattering, laughing, drinking and it felt nice. \n\nUnfortunately, I have to report that there was a couple disappointing factors that would prevent us from returning or recommending your restaurant to others. Please hear me out and let me know your thoughts:\n\n1.) Our server, Gregory, seems extremely busy during his attendance with us. He seemed rushed and flustered when prompted with questions about the wine options. He failed to check on us during dinner time. We scanned for him in the vicinity of our table and when we found him, he was so busy; we could not get eye contact. We ended up flagging another server to request for more wine and water. This is very disappointing as this made the experience less enjoyable considering the stature of the restaurant. \n2.) After our plates have been cleared from our tables, we were left unattended for about 15 minutes. I was very annoyed by this point so I asked another employee to grab our server. When Greg arrived, I asked him what kind of desert is available for birthdays since he did not give us a desert Menu. He answered with \"Ice cream sundae but we have other options\". Seeing that he failed to even offer one desert menu, we just went ahead with the Ice cream option. After what it seems like poor customer service, we decided to just ask for the check. \n3.) Greg brought our check over; we gave him a couple cards in addition to cash as we split up the bill. . He brought back our cards to sign but failed to bring back any change. We were hoping to get some change back since we wanted to tip the Valet guy. I was really surprise and for the first time, the server doesn't return my change. What if I wanted to tip from my Card and Keep some cash for our next endeavor?\n\nOverall, I can not recommend this place whether it's a birthday, meeting or just a hang out. Not sure how to qualify to get better service as I see others on here giving them 4-5 stars.\n\n\n10/23/14 - After having a horrible experience the first time, I got in touch with management. Quickly Cathy turned things around for me. She convinced me to try again and apologize for my first experience. I brought my boyfriend to try it for himself and we were very pleased. The Staff were extremely professional, warm and helpful. Each made our dining experience a 5 Star. I was thrilled to meet Cathy as she was such a kind and sincere person. I'm glad she is part of Management because she truly handled this kind of problem very well. BTW, besides knowing how to fix a problem and providing great customer service, the food was amazing. My taste buds were going crazy with each bite. The Steak was cook to perfection. I'm definitely coming back.", "author": "Mindy T."}

Loved every component of my mushroom soup with the Mimolette cheese and parmesan crisps. The breading on my husband's fried quail legs was amazing- light, crispy, and sweet. Possibly the best fried piece of meat ever. Devoured my sole. I wish they sold their hollandaise in a bottle, because I would pour it on everything. My husband thought his duck was the best he's ever had (though I would argue Spruce might give them a run for their money). An excellent meal with fantastic service.

Not many people at the restaurant - quite empty for a brunch spot in San Francisco. \n\nService was slow - ordered coffees and juice and took more than 15 minutes to arrive. Last time I checked coffee takes only a couple minutes to make and I'm sure they aren't squeezing their own juices. \n\nFood was decent - started off with the deviled eggs (not bad) and monkey bread (pretty much a regular cinnamon roll).

Never made it for drinks but have now been to Prospect twice for dinner.   My friends and I really enjoyed our meals tremendously each time.  \n\nI had the yellowtail crudo (both times, because I enjoyed it so much!).  It has a really interesting blend of tastes, including a  seaweed cracker (which gives it texture), the pickled cucumber (which gives it pop) and the white miso (which gives it a slightly salty taste), as well as some other ingredients like sesame and dollops of some sort of mayonnaise.  I also really liked the black cod with red curry, as well as the diver scallops on risotto, which were perfectly cooked.  For dessert, the black and tan dessert was superb.  I liked the blend of the rich chocolate sorbet (sorbet, really?), butter-bourbon pudding, bittersweet brownie, and shortbread.  Very sweet but good.  \n\nBoth times my friends loved my restaurant selection.  They really liked the buffalo carpaccio.  The green goddess salad was a bit heavier than expected (it had an oily pesto green sauce, and no greens, just cucumber and avocado).  The halibut and the salmon were both given great reviews.  They also liked the Asian pear tartine with chevre ice cream, although it didn't look as good as the black and tan in my opinion.  \n\nOverall, the ambience is modern, and the place is hopping.  Both times we had to wait at least 15 minutes for our table.   But overall, the service was very good and I'm definitely making this a regular hang out in the hood.", "author": "Vivian W."}

The only reason this has 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food and drinks were fine, albiet small for the price (particularly the drinks -- if I'm paying $12, I want a drink bigger than a shot glass). \n\nWhat was really unpleasant about this experience was the attitude of the servers. My friends and I work across the street from Prospect, so we wanted to try them out on a Friday after work. Our office doesn't have a very fancy dress code, so we were in \"normal\" clothes walking into Prospect....which, according to the stares we got from the hostesses and the floor manager, apparently made us no better than street people. I kid you not -- I was literally looked up and down slowly by at least two different people working at this place, and got particularly disdainful glares for my sneakers.  I understand that the dining room is formal, and I probably wouldn't walk into dinner wearing jeans, but this was in the bar area at 5pm on a normal Friday, not in the main restaurant on Valentine's Day at 8pm. \n\nAfter being offended by the rude looks we all got from all the servers, we had to fight for everything we got -- they actually did seat us in the corner (I was SHOCKED, but then I noticed it was a table in the back where our casual attire wouldn't offend others at the front of the bar), but after that, it was a struggle. Had to ask for bread (they looked pissed). Had to ask for a bar menu for some food (was told that they don't usually serve off the bar menu at the tables, despite the fact that the table right next to us had the bar menu given to them). Had to ask if they had beers on tap (the waitress wasn't happy about telling my friend what they had). Drinks were literally snatched away as soon as we looked close to being done. \n\nAnd again, we were all stared at when we walked out...I swear we did not look THAT under-dressed. If Prospect can't get over themselves during happy hour, they are going to lose a LOT of business from our quite respectable (and large) tech company right across the street.

While it's modern it's just lacks a personality.  It's great for groups, lots of space, big tables and bar, the benefits of being in SOMA.\n\nWe start with the crispy crap, then followed by foie gras and then roasted qual.  All were great dishes, nicely prepared, served, everything about them was appetizing and well balanced.   The wines we had brought out some nice nodes as well.  The only thing was that I misread and though we were getting seared foie gras not the torchon, which is quite rich for me and was very salty.  There was also not enough bread and the sides to balance it ou.\n\nFor the entree we had the goat dish, that was our least favorite, there was just no flavor to it and it lacked elegance in flavor, it looked nice but tasted like a meat and potatoes dish.  The goat was heavy and not very tender.  I think there could have been more done with it and better sides paired to lighten it up.\n\nOne thing that really annoyed me was that the way the table was placed I was sitting right in the crack of the couch, it was also too low and I felt like a kit at the table and not in line with my partner.  Badly designed!  \n\nCompared to Boulevard, while the food was good, it definitely lacked a certain skill and refinement that their counterpart has.

I would love to knock the fact that this place is in the FiDi and that typically wouldn't be my jam... but I ended up picking this place based on the yelp reviews, and it delivered!\n\nNow remember, portions are on the slightly smaller side, so don't smoke too much of your medicinal marijuana prior to dining. Or do.. Anyway, a breakdown of my meal:\n\nOur waiter - A very knowledgeable and professional vivacious asian guy, (don't recall his name) who genuinely laughed at all of my dad's bad jokes throughout the eve.\n\nBread+Butter - I am gluten free so I can't personally attest to the amazingness of the bread, but the rest of my party (without trying to make me feel too bad) let me know that, as suspected, it was indeed good.\nI may be allergic to wheat, HOWEVER, I am not allergic to butter. Sprinkled with large rock salt chunks, I eased my knife into the pad of creamy goodness, took a quick look around to make sure no one was watching me eat straight butter and slipped it in. So, so good. I ended up eating more butter than the other 4 adults I was with. Ooops.\n\nDrink - Pompelmo Frizzante. I usually don't drink too much, but my parents were in town..and footing the bill.. so I opted for this one. It's made up of Vodka, Sparkling Wine, Grapefruit, Vanilla, Lemon. The alcohol is not too overpowering to the taste buds (but apparently stronger than I initially thought, due to the fact that I spit out a mouthful of water in a fit of laughter.. Can't take me anywhere. Anywho-) I was so glad that you could really taste the vanilla bean. ugh, so good.\n\nStarter - Summer Melon & Fig Salad. I can't decide if it looked as good as it tasted or tasted as good as it looked. Hm. It has everything I could ask for in a salad - feta, prosciutto, melons. I probably could have eaten 6 more servings, but that would have been wildly inappropriate.\n\nEntree - Pacific Sea Bass & Sea Scallops. Scallops were seared PERFECTLYYYYY. And I mean perfectly. That's why I put it in caps and added multiple \"Y's\". Golden, crispy brown on the outside and soft on the inside. I actually didn't even realize I had ordered bass because I was so focused on the scallops, so that was a pleasant and delectable surprise. My favorite accent was the corn and pea tendril fondue. \n\nDessert - Now that I go back and look at the menu, I don't see it so I'll have to describe it to the best of my abilities. So, It was like this creamy..um.. white... Really wish I could remember the name now.

The best thing about Prospect is the service-it's impeccable. The wait staff is extremely polite, warm, attentive, ready to make any recommendation and bring you anything you need.  The menu is not large, but there are a good number of dishes to try.  \n\nI ordered the salmon-the presentation in general in their entrees and small plates is wonderful.  But the portions are very small, and my dish was really quite bland and unimpressive. Those I was with ordered the trout and halibut-the halibut was supposedly very good.  For dessert, I had the chocolate gnash cake, which also strangely seemed to be lacking something. Maybe it was an off night or I ordered the wrong entree, but if you're willing to give it a try, it's an excellent place for an anniversary dinner, bringing family from out of town or for a client lunch/dinner.", "author": "Ronnie S."}

He was quite helpful when it came to picking wines (they have a lot to choose from!)\n\nI ordered the Albarino (which I loved) and he ordered the \"bartenders choice.\" He was pleasantly surprised!\n\nWe split the Maine Lobster and Potato Gnocchi appetizer.

We had 2 orders of foie gras pate and 1 order of trout mouse for 7 people and it was definitely too much, we probably should have stuck with one of the foie gras.  Maybe it just felt a lot to me since it was my third foie gras dish within three days. :)\n\nThey had several nice-looking cocktails on their list, but I opted instead for a bellini, since I saw that they had a drink with white peach puree.  It was made perfectly and went well with the meal (Bellinis definitely trump mimosas in my book any day).\n\nFor my main course I got the \"Prospector\", which was huuuge.  It came with 2 eggs, a giant piece of sausage, bacon, corn skillet cakes, and home fries.  The sausage was pork apple, which tasted kind of like chicken apple sausage but meatier.  The corn skillet cakes were like halfway between pancakes and corn bread.  Everything was tasty and perfectly cooked.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place for brunch, and hopefully I'll get to try it for dinner someday too.", "author": "Arlene M."}

What a waste of 30 mins. \n\nI ordered the seared quail and sweetbreads for my appetizer and the lamb tasting for my main course. The seared quail was pretty disappointing. To me it had some asian flavors which tasted too familiar for my liking.\n\nI enjoyed the lamb tasting. Everything was done well and the flavors were great but the portions were pretty small.

The ravioli had large white truffle flakes that just made the dish. I will definitely order this again - the ravioli is a bit eggy, but I didn't mind at all - tasted great.  The tartare wasn't exactly spicy or full of flavor.  I had expected more out of this.  The hnd-picked crab salad was very tasty - it was fresh and great balance of citrus throughout the dish.  \n\nFor the main dishes our group had ordered the ribeye with bone marrow, the grilled local swordfish with braised artichokes and smoked potatoes, the kobe bavette, and the local petrale sole with onion soubise.\n\nThe ribeye with bone marrow was delicious, although I wanted a bit more of the marrow compared to the size of the steak.

I had heard about this place for a long time, and reading the reviews beforehand got me all excited. I had also glanced at the menus previously (they change them every so often) and they always had something that sounded amazing. \n\nWe got there at 7:20p and the ma\u00eetre d' told us to have a seat at the bar as our table wasn't ready yet. We ordered 2 drinks and a side order of fries. The drinks were OK - we didn't get our fries till we got seated at our table at 7:55p.\n\nNothing on the mains really interested me, so I chose to get two appetizers instead:\nHand Picked Dungeness Crab: This was... not that great, unfortunately. The asparagus was cooked well, but I felt the crab and the creme fraiche just didn't pair well together. I would definitely not get this again. \nPotato Gnocchi: The gnocchi was good, nothing outstanding, but the mushrooms definitely did not taste smoked. I love mushrooms, but this had an odd taste to it. Another miss, sadly.\nBoth of the appetizers were really small - so if you think you can do 2 appetizers to substitute for 1 main, you can't. Also, they are pricey for what you get.\n\nMy bf got the Prather Ranch Berkshire Pork. This on the other hand, he claims it was delicious. The onion fries were a bit on the soggy side, but the pork was cooked pretty well. He said it rivaled NOPA's pork, which I think says a lot! \n\nI really wanted the dinner to end well, so we ordered the Tin Roof Sundae for dessert. The sundae comes in two sizes, a regular and small. Go with the regular - it's definitely not large at all. The sundae came in a sundae glass and was probably the best part of my dinner. Everything was very tasty and I could definitely eaten another of those. \n\nTotal came out to abou $100 after tax.

I went with four other co workers as we were celebrating the completion of a project. I was pretty excited about this opportunity because I knew this restaurant had gotten solid reviews. \n\nFirst of all, it is a bit secluded and out by the water near Folsom and Spear. The restaurant from the outside looked very classy and I was a big fan of the elegant look. Our group walks in and it is packed with people. The d\u00e9cor of the restaurant was upscale and classy and perfect for our business dinner. We were greeted with warm faces at the front and immediately brought over to our table. As we sit down for our meal the foodies at our table start perusing the menu while I peruse what I am good at which is the vino list. I was able to ask the server about a specific vino and he stated how it is different from what I was looking for. He was able to suggest the perfect vino showing knowledge which I appreciated. The foodies order approximately 4 appetizers to which we asked if they could be shared. The servers stated that they are large enough portions to be shared and that there should be no issues.  \n\nThe food comes out and the appetizers are tiny. Definitely not enough food. I even passed on some of my portions to make sure my team was able to eat the food because I wanted them to have the experience. So not a great start. The vino comes out and I am able to drink a few glasses and push aside my hunger from not being able to eat any of the appetizers. I had ordered the rib eye at the time (menu changes constantly so rib eye is not currently on there I believe after speaking with a colleague who went to prospect recently) which was solid. It was cooked well but not anything mind blowing. I had been hoping for more given the amount we were paying. My other co workers had ordered an array of entrees and it seemed to be either hit or miss for food which for me is unfortunate for an upscale restaurant.  \n\nAlthough I think the good dishes were solid, given the fact that it's either a hit or miss for the price you pay is not enticing.

To start, my girlfriend had the Foie Gras Torchon and she said that it was pretty good; about what she had expected but no where near what we had in Paris (which is an unfair comparison).  I started with the Seared Monterey Calamari, Gulf White Prawns, and Savory Clams all of which was good but not great.  I had the Prather Ranch Berkshire Pork and it was excellent.  My girlfriend had the Liberty Duck and while good, it lacked a bit of the expected gamey flavor that you would have with duck.  Dessert was the ice cream sandwichs.  This was interesting, not too sweet and a pretty good combination.  Definitely consider it if you're in the mood for dessert.\n\nService was great.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Spacing between courses was great; we did not feel rushed nor feel neglected and the pacing allowed us to enjoy the meal.\n\nOverall ambiance of the place was about what I expected:  open and airy with fairly well dressed yet casual clientele.  The atmosphere had an air of modern sophistication without being stuffy or taking itself too seriously.  This is a place that's good for a date or a night out with your friends.\n\nIn all, Prospect is a solid choice if you're looking for a place with good food, yet nothing too adventurous.  If you're taking someone out on a date and aren't sure what they might like, keep this on your list of safe choices.", "author": "Richard A."}

Servers were great, and I love the ambiance. \n\nFood - 4 stars - got to the bar early and tried a few happy hour menu items. Got the arancini, which was decent; fries, which were just ok; and the fried chicken wings, which were AMAZING. iced tea brined, cornmeal crusted fried chicken?!! who does that? Prospect does, and I would go back JUST for these babies. Now the actual meal my coworkers had was great. We got to pick from a menu of two apps, two entrees and two dessert options. The scallops, berkshire pork and chocolate cake w/ bourbon ice cream were pretty awesome. the gnocchi, chicken confit and strawberry shortcake were all good- not bad, but not bomb, they were just \"good\". gnocchi lacked flavor without the sauce, and the chicken was a little dry, but neither were bad.\n\nI would definitely come back, again, for the fried chx wings, but also to have a dinner with a smaller party where i can pick whatever i want from the menu rather than a prix-fixed menu.", "author": "Erica L."}

We ordered the green goddess salad to start, which was quite nice.  Refreshing and the avocado was perfectly ripe.\n\nI ordered the salmon and my two friends ordered the pork chop and duck dishes.  We all tried a bite of each other's food and agreed that the food at Prospect is delicious.  The portions seemed a bit small at the time, but more on this later.\n\nFor dessert, we decided to get two and share.  The first was the roasted apple and brioche pain perdu, which was plain awesome.  Not too heavy and great apple flavor.  We also ordered the chocolate blackout cake, which was flavorful but not too rich.\n\n\nBrunch:\nSo it so happens that I had the same server at brunch as I did at dinner a month before.  He seemed a bit \"out of it\" that day, and I saw that he made a mistake on someone's order at the table next to ours.\n\nWe ordered the ricotta donuts which were so delightfully fluffy you could probably eat all 5 on the plate without a problem.  The dipping sauces were also great.\n\nIt took quite some time to get our food.  There was definitely something going on in the kitchen since they gave us free banana bread to thank us for our patience.  Nice touch!\n\nI got the crispy pig trotters and they were heavenly!  Perfectly crispy but not greasy on the outside, with delicious porky goodness on the inside.  The dressing on the accompanying frisee and radicchio salad wasn't my favorite but it was prepared well.  My friends ordered the shortrib hash, baked eggs, and huevos rancheros.  I think the baked eggs were a little too simple and bland for my friend, but the other two dishes were well-received.\n\nOnto portion size: The main plates are a bit on the small size.  They really focus on the quality of the ingredients at Prospect and don't throw a bunch of stuff on a plate to make you feel full.  Truth of the matter is, you wait 15 minutes or so and we were all satisfied.  Not stuffed full and not hungry, it was a good amount of food.  At dinner, adding an appetizer and/or dessert should definitely satiate your belly.\n\nI love the layout of this restaurant, it's so open and spacious.  Despite pricey dinner entrees, the brunch menu is very reasonably priced at Prospect.  I would highly recommend coming here!", "author": "Naoko M."}

Atmosphere is nice more on the professional side I felt, so definitely a place to take a client or have a lunch meeting . We were greeted at the front by a very smiley hostess, then were seated to the main dining room where we were handed the menu. I already had my eyes set on several items when checking the website, however it was on the Bar Menu, which is only available at yes, the bar. The bar menu is a specific menu filled with small plate items and only available at the bar from 5pm - close, this is not the Happy Hour Menu, although they do have that at a set time as well. The main dining room menu had great choices for main dishes, but we were more interested in trying several different dishes to share instead of eating one big dish each. So we politely asked if it was ok to move to the bar area and was replied with, \"It is your dining experience so feel free to sit wherever you would like\". We were pleased and very thankful of his response, cause in all honesty we felt very naggy at that point. We were moved over to the bar area, which wasn't bad, had a roomy table with view of the dining room. The only thing we found weird is that the bar area was not as loud as the dining area, where as typically it would be vice versa. \n\nStarted off with the drinks, found the drink choices to be more on the manly side; no cosmos, mojitos, or anything girly. One of my girlfirends even said that their drinks seem like it would put some hair on your chest. After eying the cocktail menu, decided on the Il Terranova: Botanical Vodka, Cynar, Cucumber, Agave Nectar, and Lime. Thought it would be refreshing and light, however it came out to taste somewhat like I was drinking whisky. Then we ordered, and ordered a lot and to be honest it was really hit or miss and to the extreme. Some dishes were either really good or really ehhhh. \n\nTo the food: \nAhi Tuna Tartare - Hit: This was one of the faves of the table, fresh with a little kick due to Jalapeno and Black Siracha\nPork Belly Fries - Miss: Not what we expected coming out. We ordered thinking it would be sliced pork belly, mocking the shape of fries or pork belly w/a side of fries. It was actually minced pork belly and kimchee sprinkled on top of thick cut fries. This was disappointing because the fries were the main attraction but the least wanted. What we did try of the pork belly was really good, however not enough of. \nCrispy Squash Blossoms - Hit: 2 squash blossoms with a couple fried green beans. Squash blossoms were light, yet very crispy which I liked. \nMushroom Arancini - Miss: We were told they were out of, so asked if we would like to opt for the crab cakes. Sure!!! The server brought it out.. Wow someone said, and a giggle came another. Is this what they feed the crabs that they are using to make the actual crab cakes?!?! They were tiny, good but way to tiny.. \nDuck Liver Mousse - Hit: This had to be my favorite. Very smooth texture, not overly mineral in taste, and paired with the pickled rhubarb and shallots, mmmmmmmmmm.. The best thing I had there. \nSmoked Halibut Brandade - Miss: Texture was nice and smooth, but flavor was bland. So it made me feel like I was smearing seasoned mashed potatoes on a crostini\nCheese Plate - Hit: But I mean how can you get cheese wrong\nSteak Frites: Kobe Bavette was tender and flavorful. Then had another serving of those really thick cut fries. \n\nOverall, nice filling meal. However, was maybe looking for a better dining experience.", "author": "Candice B."}

I love fresh, light composed plated salads like this. It was delicious, but not too filling. I suppose it could have used a smidge more acid, but that's grasping at straws. The almond brittle as a garnish was an interesting nutty touch.\n\nMy entree was the duck, and it was probably the best duck I've ever eaten (and if I see duck on a reputable menu, I usually order it, so I've eaten a LOT of duck). The breast was PERFECTLY cooked, and even though it is breakfast time the next day, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it. If I had to critique something, I'd say that the duck leg was an itsy bitsy bit salty, and I would have like more quinoa. Also, again, I think it could have used some citrus or berry notes to brighten it up a bit. But honestly, those are both personal preferences, and not really faults of the chef. The jus on the plate was especially delicious, and even though I often say I despise dark leafy greens, these were rather tasty.\n\nAs a final note, the service and ambiance (except for the two loud drunk couples at the bar). were nothing short of exceptional.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Prospect.

The gnocchi was soft and pillowy and the short ribs were tender and moist.  The scallop dish was solid and delicious as well. The crab and citrus salad was a good starter with a tangy citrus vinaigrette.  Of course you have to save room for dessert and the picks were the vanilla panna cotta and red velvet cake.  The panna cotta had a delicious mandarin orange sauce which was light and smooth.  The red velvet was a layered cake with custard, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  They were both wonderful finishes to the meal.\n\nThe service was attentive but not overly.  You have your choice of still or bubbly water on the house in a carafe.

The pork chop with sous vide, then pan seared apricot halves with skin on, the perfect amounts of foie gras medallion and pate in the appetizer, the light sprinkling of bottarga on the peas, the way everything melds...\n\nI've even heard of a $30 3-course meal on Sunday nights, and seen blogs noting celebrities eating here.\n\nOnly downsides: It's not close to much else, so walking home late at night alone is a little nerve-wracking, and there seemed to be no beer list, but I can't say I missed it.\n\nOn my scale, Prospect gets a 3.\n\nScale:\n1: Would not go back alone and would protest if a friend suggested we go.\n2: Would not go back alone, but would not protest if a friend suggested we go.\n3: Would go back happily and willingly without being prompted by someone else.", "author": "Lauren J."}

The decor is clean and modern, the noise level is totally comfortable, the service was great from start to finish, and the food was delicious.  \n\nWe don't drink much, and I usually end up ordering a large bottle of sparking water when we're eating out, but they give you the option of either still or sparkling water for free.  Love that!  We started off with a couple of appetizers - the beef tartare for me and the crab risotto for my honey.  I liked my appetizer, but I LOVED the risotto.  I kinda wanted to steal it.  We did the \"sharing is caring\" thing, but I definitely know what I'm ordering for my starter next time.  \n\nFor our entrees I had the kobe beef bavette with cheddar gratin potatoes and spinach, and honey had the chicken.  The beef was so flavorful!  I almost never order chicken in a restaurant, but my boyfriend's chicken was super good, might have to try it myself in the future  My beef was perfectly seasoned and cooked, I was very happy with it.  \n\nFor dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake with the cocoa nib ice cream and salted caramel, and my boyfriend had the lemon meringue mini sundae.  Both were very tasty and the presentation was lovely.  I couldn't finish my dessert (it was very rich), but we managed to finish off the mini sundae (wasn't too tough!).\n\nCallie, the Asst. GM,  introduced herself and we chatted for a few minutes.  She was very personable and helpful, and really made us feel like we were valued customers.  Today my boyfriend received a voicemail from her thanking us for coming in for dinner last night (!!!).  Now that's a nice touch.  \n\nWe've already texted our friends and recommended Prospect, and plan to go back again ourselves.

Fresh and tasty, heirloom tomatoes are accompanied by light bellwether fromage blanc, caesar croutons, and wild arugula.  Tender and moist, but piquant from a hint of red curry, black cod ($15) is pared with a slightly greasy shiso shrimp fritter, shiitake mushrooms, and snap peas.\n\nWhile tasty, the small portion of day boat scallops ($26) with lobster mushroom risotto, cauliflower, toasted pine nuts, and chervil disappoints.  Overwhelmed by a too-heavy hollandaise sauce, northern halibut ($27) with green and zebra tomatoes flounders (pun intended).\n\nWhile friendly and well-meaning, service is a little confused:  a waiter swore that the establishment does not carry a brand of whiskey  that was had from the bar only 20 minutes before; water glasses went unfilled for quite some time; and drinks from the bar took forever to be delivered.\n\nNancy Oakes and company have a long-standing San Francisco icon in Boulevard, but their mojo has not automatically transferred itself to Prospect.

Although we enjoyed the dish, we probably would not order this again only because of it's size.  For 2 people, each of us got 2 mouthfuls... any more than 2 people and this dish would not suffice.\n\nEntrees\n- Prather Ranch Berkshire Pork: Impressive size of meat.  We were told that meat is purchased locally from Prather Ranch (avail at Ferry Bldg) and sometimes comes bone in and other times as just the loin.  The pork was tender, moist, and had a delicious smoky flavor.  This dish did not disappoint!\n- Kobe Bivette: 4 slices of tender beef cut over spinach paired with potatoes and mushrooms on the side.  This description, I should say, does not do the dish justice.  Admittedly, I had to consciously eat this dish slowly... if I ate it too fast, I fear that I would have been still hungry and craving for more.  Savoring each bite certainly helped this dish fill me up, and left me very satisfied!\n\nDessert\n- Pumpkin Beignet - recommended by our server, this dessert came with 4 sugared donuts filled with pumpkin.... I would have enjoyed even more pumpkin filling, but it was tasty.  With the applesauce and ice cream, it was a delicious mix of flavors.   I'm glad I tried it, but would probably like to try some of their other desserts next time.\n- Ice Cream Sandwich - Chocolate ice cream sandwich with crunchy nuts... tasty - solid choice, though not the most unique dessert\n\nOverall, I think everything on the menu was solid and this is a place I'd definitely love to come visit again.

Located in the Infinity Towers, the spacious restaurant was filled with well dressed older diners that really made us felt out of place.  But let's get to the food:\n\nFor a cocktail, we shared the Cora (11) tequila, pomegranate-ginger molasses grapefruit, creole bitters, and lime. Purposely going with the lightest cocktail on the list, I really enjoy the intense citrus flavor and light alcoholic touch.  Plus it looked pretty!\n\nFor the appetizer, we shared the creamy polenta with a slow poached egg and crispy cheese.  I forgot the original name of this dish but that was basically what it was.  Although I LOVE my polenta and my poached eggs, unfortunately the textures were to similar and the two entities were lost in the dish.  The crispy on the other hand was nice salty-bite to the extra creaminess of the dish.\n\nThe duck (28) came prepared three ways, a pan seared duck breast, a sou vide thigh, and a duck roulade with figs and nuts.  All three were tasty but in ranking I love the roulade (love the sweetness of the figs, the crunchy of the nuts, and the salty of the duck), then breast (juicy and moist), and finally the thigh (a little too fatty and not as savory as the others).\n\nWhile the duck's portion might leave something to the imagination, the Berkshire pork chop (28)  filled the whole plate.  The pork chop was moist, succulent, and flavorful fully living up to the expectations.\n\nThe espresso ice cream sandwich dessert came free for the birthday boy!

Food is class A, we had heirloom tomatoes with burrata, seared scallops and kobe short ribs - everything was extremely good. \nThe wine selection is one of the most complete I've ever seen, and I was really glad I could have a bottle of \"Rosso di Montalcino\", coming from one of my favorites Italian wineries (yup I'm from there, born and raised). Service is what you would expect from this class of restaurant, professional and timely. All of this doesn't come cheap of course, but you pay for what you get, and you'll get a lot.", "author": "Steve E."}

Below is the email I sent to General Manager.  \n\n2 stars for food and ambiance.  Service from assigned server and poor planning from events manager is what killed it for me.\n\nScott,\n\nI understand you are the General Manager at Prospect and am sending you this email about my experience as a first time diner of the establishment.  First off, I'd like to thank Prospect for accommodating my request to host a brunch to celebrate my 40th birthday with family and friends on Sept. 29.\n\nNext, I'd like to provide some feedback regarding my experience.\n\nHonestly, I had high expectations regarding this celebration from the moment I made the reservation.  When I booked the reservation, the representative was friendly and answered all my questions/concerns thoroughly.  Additionally, the menu items caught my eye.  I even met with Kathy King when I dropped off the paperwork to secure the day and time for the party and she was most helpful and friendly with the reservation.\n\nHowever, this all fell flat today and I departed rather unhappy and upset with the female server assigned to my party, not to mention setting up the menu.\n\nReasons:\n1)  I was told Naomi Smith would contact me to work on selecting menu items for the brunch in order to streamline the process, which I was more than fine with because of the party size.  I did NOT receive an email or phone call from Naomi to ask my opinion about the items I would like to have.  It would have been nice to have added some items that caught my eye on the regular menu. \n\n2)  The appetizers I paid for came out cold, namely the ricotta donuts and cinnamon rolls.  I felt they were a bit stale as well.\n\n3)  When the bill came, the server combined all the alcohol beverages with the food tab.  I specifically requested the alcohol and food items be on separate tabs.  This was requested from the very beginning and was ensured this would be carried out.  This was also confirmed Friday, September 27 when the reservations rep called me to finalize last minute details.\n\nWhen I brought this error to the (main) female server, her reply was \"this request was not in the notes.\"  Her delivery and tone was rather condescending and she did NOT offer any assistance to correct this.  At other fine dining establishments, the server would have taken the bill and corrected this, no questions asked!  I had to find a manager to resolve this.  Overall, she seemed unhappy to have been assigned my party - at least that's the feeling I observed.\n\n4)  Service from the (main) female server was cold and disconnected, in my opinion.  I would have rather had the back ups as the servers.  They were much friendlier and accommodating to small requests I needed.  When clarifying the payment details for the appetizer bill (which I was going to pay for as the host of the party), I explained my dad and I were going to split the tab on two cards.  Again, she was very one sided and said, \"I only have one card on file and will be using that one.\"  After trying to explain this to her twice, I gave up because she was closed off in my request to use two cards to settle the appetizer bill.\n\nIn closing, spending nearly $1,000 on this event has left me unhappy on a day that was to be fun and joyous.  I'm a fairly easy patron, however, with the above items noted, it all adds up, in my opinion, about the overall experience. \n\nI am not sure how you address concerns such as these, but I wanted to email this to you because it has bothered me all day, quite frankly.", "author": "Daniel Y."}

The restaurant is very modern but, even though it was filled to capacity on a Saturday night, the noise level was tolerable.  The service was attentive and friendly, the sommelier joined us in a taste of the wine we brought, and the manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. \n\nThe food was good - our entire party was satisfied with their choices and enjoyed the meal.  I had the scallop main course and the scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I really like this dish.\n\nThe highlight of my meail was the dessert - pumpkin beignets!!

We started with cocktails and then split the soft shell crab appetizer.  This came with a very tasty gumbo and was a nice appetizer to split.  For dinner, I had the pork loin, which was a quite generous cut of meat with collard greens, beans and some very nice battered onion (called rings on the menu, but more like a part of a layer).  My wife had the duck, which had a couple of different cuts + quinoa, turnips and walnut brittle (very tasty!).  We split the Peach Fry for dessert, which was really delicious.  We got the buttermilk ice cream on the side (my wife can't eat ice cream) and it was a bit too sweet on its own.\n\nThe service was excellent.  It was a pretty relaxed meal with plenty of time between courses.  The restaurant was active but not too loud, so easy to have a conversation.\n\nOverall a really great meal.", "author": "Richard M."}

Prospect might serve the best brunch in the city.\n\nSure, it's not dirt cheap, and there's nothing bottomless, but they have an amazing ability to cook eggs and pair them with delicious savory accompaniments.\n\nCase-in-point: corned-beef short rib, hash, and soft cooked eggs. My God, I don't know how they do that, but those eggs are life-affirming. The square of short rib hash is just enough, and the toasted epi is perfect, dipped in the amazing egg yolks.\n\nThey are also very serious about their cocktails. Personally, I can't stray away from the Strange Brew: Gin, St. Germain, Pineapple juice, lemon juice, and a pale ale floater. Refreshingly tart and delicious. Really gets the taste of last night out of your mouth.\n\nAnd speaking of the night before, Prospect is very hangover friendly.\n\n Long story short, I came in after a very productive night with 2 friends. One of my friends was trying to power through it in the morning, but was getting sick as the food arrived. They noticed he wasn't touching his Huevos Rancheros and the chef asked him if they could do anything. Once we told them he was hungover, they brought him some toast while he was puking in the bathroom. No judgement, they just really wanted to nurture. And offered to bring a shot as well. I friggin love this place.\n\nI'm dying to come back for dinner, but after party night in SF, I don't know of any better spot to recover than Prospect, and you don't have to wait in line or hover over anybody to get a table.\n\nAll you haters need to back up off the SF elitist Kool-Aid...this place is delicious.", "author": "Berg W."}

I was pleased with the ambiance.  Very nice setting and open space.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed with the bar service... you would think with a full bar setting that they would have the most asked cocktail of all in hand.. APPLE MARTINI.  To my surprise, they do not have that available which was quite shocking!  I did order the Posey, but definitely was not the same to the palate.  \n\nI had the rib-eye steak with the onion rings.  Nice portion for $29, but beware that if you order medium rare.. in reality.. it was was more RARE than it needed to be.  It was a bit on the salty side which most at my table ordered and agreed that it was tasty, but definitely salty... as most would say SODIUM OVERLOAD.  The focaccia bread they serve just right before dinner was very good.  \n\nAs for dessert, The Mississippi Mud Pie was possibly the only thing we all agreed tasted to perfection.  The toffee chocolate crunch was a nice touch.  \n\nThe plus side is the parking.  They offer valet for $10 BUT you can definitely find parking along the streets.  There is also a parking lot across the street for $8.", "author": "JADE L."}

Thanks for the great reviews because I agreed, it was a great dining experience! \n\nWe weren't able to get dinner reservations but we showed up exactly at 5:30pm when the doors opened so we were able to get seats at the bar. Just walking up to the entrance with the big beautiful doors, I could tell this place was going to be fashionable. And I was right, you walk in and the ambience is very hip and classy and the crowd is as well. \n\nThey had a bar menu but you were also able to order off of the dinner menu. For drinks we ordered the vodka Pompelmo - delish! - with hints of lemon and vanilla but not too sweet - and the Mr. White that had tequila and strawberry in it - what a great combination! For food, we ordered: \n\nDuck & Bacon Pate: Delicious! I rarely order pate, but this was flavorful and loved the bacon in it. \nFried Shishito Peppers: Super Delicious! Small fried peppers with tiny roasted garlic chips mixed in. \nAhi Tuna Tartare: Yummy! Served with taro chips. \nGrilled Chicken Salad: This was the only item that was not as expected. It was served as a cut up, cold chicken breast, with 4 tomato slices and 2 crostinis. There was absolutely no lettuce. Call me a traditionalist, but when I see the word salad, I think of greens! Oh well, that was the only disappointment out of everything we ordered so that's still a good ratio. \n\nThe hostess and bartenders were friendly, although not overly so - probably because it's a classy environment and they are more reserved typically - but overall, pleased with our experience at Prospect!", "author": "LuLu M."}

I had a Siren (gin based) and  a Mr. White (tequila based) and loved them both. Sister had a Viscious Circle and Hubby had a Prospector. The only drink I didn't really like was the Pompelmo Frizzante - not bad, just nothing special compared to the other drinks. \n\nAPPYs: Halibut tartare was ok; soft shell crab was delicous\n\nENTREEs: Rib eye, pork chop, salmon and veal chop (which was their special) -- all delicious! The pork chop was so tender and moist - I was skeptical since it's a rather thick cut, but they must have brined it to prefection. I didn't care for the polenta or the grilled fruit on top, but that's just me. The veal chop had a delicious mash that came with it and was perfectly cooked. The rib eye was delicious!

Nice architecture, great service, delicious food, but very LOUD and slow seating.\n\nOur reservations were for 7:45pm but we were finally seated after waiting 45 minutes.  That's worse than waiting in rush hour traffic on the Bay Bridge!\n\nWe waited at the cramped bar and ordered some cocktails: Pompelmo Frizzante and Pisco-Apricot Tropicana.  They were expensive and tasted too boozey.  Maybe you're into that?  I like me a drink that tastes delicious but can still make me feel gooooood.\n\nFor dinner:\n\n-Crispy soft shell crab- crisp and perfectly seasoned with a nice tomatillo sauce.  The black quinoa was obviously an afterthought.\n-Pork chop- best I've ever had!  Very moist, tender and brined to perfection.  The polenta was bland and the yummy peaches overwhelmed the entire dish, so I ate them separately.\n-Rib eye- cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The chanterelles tasted almost like smokey bacon- yum!  And the onion rings on top were so fantastic that we almost ordered a side of them.\n-Cocoa Nib Profiteroles- STALE and VERY HARD- DO NOT ORDER!!!  The coffee ice cream, chocolate fudge and cherries were divine but the profiteroles were the worst I have ever experienced in my life!  I would have never served that to anyone.

God.\n\nLast night 3 friends and I had dinner at Prospect after not feeling Waterbar post a few drinks in the cold...we wanted something hearty and warming and boy did we pick the right spot!\n\nWe started with the white truffle gnocchi (2 orders), seared scallops, and cucumber avocado crab salad. The white truffle gnocchi is a game changer, I could literally eat pounds of it. And then probably succumb to heart failure, but it would be well worth it. The scallops were also delightful and perfectly prepared, and the avo crab salad was fresh and delicious, seasoned perfectly with a Thai flair.\n\nTwo of us then had the Kobe bavette- so good. Whatever that sauce is...it is like crack! I couldn't stop scraping my plate to get one last taste! Another friend ordered the halibut which was also delicious, perfectly flaky and tender, not over seasoned so as to mask the fish. Wonderful. The last member of our party had the swordfish. Wow. This dish was killer! So much flavor, nice and steaky as swordfish should be, but tender as all hell. Just amazing.\n\nWe didn't stop there. Of course not- how could we neglect desert?!?! We got the bon bons, the mint ice cream sandwich, and the cheese plate. All were incredible beyond measure, but the mint ice cream sandwich really resonated with me. The mint in the ice cream was fresh and bursting with organic flavor, no mint syrup used here! So good. I am depressed that this meal is over.\n\nService was also amazing. Our server Anson was friendly, super helpful, and made legit suggestions without seeming to push anything. In a city where bad servers abound, Anson really shines! The Sommelier was excellent as well; the first bottle we ordered had oxidized a bit and thus I regretfully had to send it back. He was extremely accommodating, as was his assistant, and cruised right on over to help me select a replacement.

Cocktails were fabulous though our waitress forgot to put one order in so timing was off.  Two of us had the burrata salad appetizer which was amazing. The calamari was tiny portions and skimpy for what it was and left us wanting more.   I had a tough time finding a vegetarian plate that was appealing for a main and the risotto with truffle butter was amazing and the chef was kind enough to make me a side dish of brussel sprouts that were delicious.  \n\nOur friend had the chicken and sausage which was ample portioned and he loved it.  Two of us had the black bass and lobster special which was really over priced for the portion - 3oz of fish and a nugget of lobster about an inch or two long. My girlfriend is teeny tiny and isn't a huge eater and she was left feeling unsatisfied - as in still a bit hungry.  My husband felt same.  We had a great bottle of wine and split one dessert.  \n\nThe bill game and it was way over what you'd expect for what we ordered and what we received.  In other words - value for price, way way off.  What made it worse was our server couldn't have been bothered.  She never came back to ask how we liked our dishes - not once, after any course, didn't make eye contact and was just off her game; perhaps we should have known once the cocktail order got forgotten.  \n\nWe are foodies, eat out a lot, eat all over the world and have no problem paying amply for a great meal. It's not the dollars - it's when the dollars don't feel like they delivered what you paid for.  Service was a 1; meal was good but portions off - it felt like Prospect was more about hip vibe which is icing on the cake - the restaurant fundamentals need to be there and they were off last night. We won't write this place off and will go back but with all the options n SF we were bummed by the experience.

DELICIOUS!\n\nCrispy Pig Trotters - Roasted Shisto, Salsa Rosa, House Made Pancetta  10 - this was such a TREAT!  it's exactly how you imagine crispy pig trotters to taste.  little mouthfuls of crunchy, juicy pig pieces where every bite makes you close your eyes and say MMMMMMMMMMM.  they had just enough for all 5 of us which means 5 pieces and definitely worth the $10.  this is the STEAL OF A DEAL and i would come back just for this item.\n\nPrather Ranch Berkshire Pork - Bourbon Glazed Mini Sweet Potatoes, Cider Braised Red Cabbage, Bacon Apple Relish, Shaved Apple & Celery Salad, Pork Jus 28 - whoever cooks their pork is BRILLIANT.  this dish was the perfect amount of saltiness and if you think it's too salty that's what the cabbage and side salad is to mask that taste.  every piece is juicy and you really want to take your time and enjoy the entire cut.  it's well cooked throughout and you won't leave disappointed.  this is definitely the winner entree in my mind.\n\nStorm Hill Beef New York - Mustard Mashed Potatoes, Bloomsdale Spinach, Caramelized Cippolini Onions, Beer Battered King Trumpet & Maitake Mushrooms, Beef Jus  31 - this was just OK but i'm going to ignore this plate in regards to my rating because i loved everything else so much.  the steak was bland, not a very nice cut and just overall pretty regular.  nothing special.  if you're craving steak, for the price you should just go to Ruth's Chris!  I'd X this out of their menu so that they keep up their excellent ratings.\n\nIce Cream Sandwiches (4) - chocolate cookie, coffee chocolate chip ice cream 8 - i think everyone agreed that this was a winner dessert.  the sandwich was almost like a crushed espresso so every bite was a mouthful of chip ice cream mixed with espresso bean.  SO DELICIOUS!  plus at four pieces you can stuff yourself silly and be able to share with your company and not look like a little piggie!\n\nPineapple Cream Pie - pineapple jam, rum pastry cream, caramel baked pineapple toasted macadamia nuts, cream cheese ice cream  9 - very subtle pineapple taste and really wonderful texture.  i love the crunchy of the macadamia nuts mixed with the cream pie.  such an interesting concept!\n\nVanilla Creme Brul\u00e9e - lemon shortbread crust, meyer lemon curd, citrus in elderflower syrup, blood orange sorbet  9 - not your ordinary creme brulee and an extraodinary taste.  it was almost like we licked every last piece off the plate!  again, great texture and wonderful vanilla taste.  the lemon mixed with the vanila creme was quite delightful!\n\ni will definitely be coming back!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Sandy L."}

Be prepared though, the price tag is steep ($15 incl tip & tax) for such a teeny drink portion, but believe me, you'll definitely want more than one.  \n\nTheir architect and designer did an outstanding job - Prospect is modern and hip, and they actually installed effective sound buffering so it wasn't too loud (that is one of my biggest pet peeves).  Unfortunately, the vibe was totally snobby from the minute we walked in, starting with the hostesses.  Our waiter was very mechanical and not friendly.  And it didn't stop there - my friend inquired about booking a private party, and the manager treated her insincerely.  She drops tons of cash on private parties and is well-connected.  Big mistake.  \n\nWe sampled quite a bit from the bar food menu because neither one of us found an entree enticing enough.  We had the deviled eggs, fig tarte, fries, mussels, ribs & burger sliders.

In fact, I ordered a half bottle.  They couldn't find it and brought me a comparable glass while I waited.  Halfway into that, they told me they couldn't find the bottle, but brought me a whole bottle of better quality for the same price as the half bottle.  I went from 2 glasses up to 6.  They even corked up what I didn't finish.  Above and beyond.  \n\nThe food was also amazing.  I won't ramble on about it as I was already at 5 stars with the service, ambiance, and amazing wine.

If you peer around it, you can see the dining room tucked away just behind the bar.  I think it lends to the feeling of a nice bustling after work cocktail scene, with an intimate, more quiet area for fine dining.  \n\nThe food here was delicious.  I am not a huge fan of foie gras, but I would order it again and again here.  Light, smooth, and savory on warm brioche bread.  The duck main course was a bit bony, but the taste was good, and it was definitely filling.  The biggest surprise culinary wise was the dessert.  I was so looking forward to the meyer lemon donuts, but the chocolate chip mint ice cream cookies blew the donuts out of the water.  They were cool and refreshing, with fresh mint muddled into the ice cream that was sandwiched between two gooey delicious dark chocolate patties.  I would come back just to order that dessert alone.\n\nI can definitely see why this place is such a hit.  It has stellar food like its sister restaurant up the block, but a much more laid back, easy going, intimate feel.

Deviled eggs were good (though the best I've ever had is still at Marlowes), goat cheese crostini delicious, their spiced fries weren't very special, and the caramel popcorn was not worth $5. The roasted calamari was just okay as well, but the ambiance and presentation certainly made this place a memorably good experience. \n\nFor dinner, the Ribeye was pretty delicious, as well as the Liberty Duck.

The interiors are nicely decorated in very chic, contemporary milk chocolate brown tones with lots of wide open spaces. A mixed crowd of older patrons with younger, chic female customers in skin tight, mini, sleeveless clothing (it was 50 degrees outside!) \n\nStaff was very professional and nice, especially our waitress, Anna. She was friendly & warm but hubby said she was new as she didn't know if they accepted Discover cards, but she found out they do. \nThe only thing hubby said about service was when his napkin fell on the floor while visiting the bathroom & the busboy took it away and didn't bring him back one for dessert & he had to ask for one. \n\nHubby tried the \"Hearts on Fire\" (blood orange + sparkling wine) drink, $11.50. It came reddish/orange colored in a champagne glass, quite good. I had a beeline view of the bartender doing all this shaking not stirred action. All I could think of was wrist, elbow and shoulder tendinitis as he was quite vigorous. \n\nOur apps were quite good & I wanted more of my uni risotto, $16. They could make an entree portion of that & I'd be happy. Never been much of a fan of uni but this was quite good, Sm. chunks of uni mixed into the savory risotto topped with a row of 4 tiny scallops. \nHubs had the foie gras - a lge thick disc of pate' like foie gras, soft & tender, served with dk bread, a tiny disc of aspic and zest, $19. \n\nThe petrale sole fillet, $29, was seared just right & the white meat was not overcooked, served over round green tapioca textured grains. Hub's roasted duck, $29, was also very good. Crispy skinned and tasty. We both thought there was too much salt in the food. A little less and all the apps and entrees would have been perfect. \n\nNot impressed with the desserts which Hubby didn't really want because he was full but since he was not interested in sharing the caramel popcorn, he tried the lemon tart, $9. I didn't like the thick crust of the tart & the lemon filling was OK, topped with a creamy meringue, not what I'd order again. The tart sorbet with it was good, I think it was blood orange. \n\nFor $5, I got Cracker Jack..... without the peanuts. The popcorn came in a medium sized bowl, about 2 cups and was crunchy, caramelized but some pieces tasted near burnt. I was debating between this and the smores and I regretted my decision. Couldn't finish the whole thing & took it home & Jr. Yelper said it was like Cracker Jack. The bill includes SF Health Tax. \n\nI liked the bathroom. 3 stalls total, one ADA compliant, electronic flushing toilets. Bathroom was in brown tones with a trough sink. The lighting was very dim and I went into the ADA stall & thought if I was a disabled person w/wheelchair, it would be hard for me to see what I was doing because of the poor lighting. \n\nOverall a nice dining experience but I'd be tempted to ask them to cut the salt in my food the next time. Ample metered street parking if you come early (before 6PM). They do have valet parking.", "author": "Ry T."}

Fantastic bar program -- great liquor selection and well-made drinks. A great, balanced daiquiri made w Flor de Cana Rum was a nice way to start the evening.\n\n\"Heritage\" Tomato and Burrata Salad -- Evidently \"heritage\" tomatoes are heirloom hybrids (?). Sounds like marketing spin to me, but the tomatoes were good, and the burrata, evidently made from Italian milk in San Diego before flying north, was delicious. This high-flying cheese is the perfect example of this restaurant's weakness -- but we'll get to that later.\n\nHalibut Tartar w Watermelon/Radish Relish -- Great balance of flavors. Fresh. Evidently this recipe was developed over multiple years.\n\nSoft Shell Crab w Quinoa & Cucumber -- Fascinating flavor combo. Complex.\n\nPig Trotters w Shaved Pig Head, Peanuts & Arugula -- Rich and complex. Balanced. Sloppy presentation.\n\nCheese Course -- All Adante cheeses, which are amazing.\n\nSo the food was complex and balanced, but in truth the presentations were a little sloppy, and the ingredients were exotic but not always house-made. Lots of purchased items, which to me speaks to a lack of commitment from the kitchen. Purchased bread served with the cheese,  and burrata flown all over the place when it could easily be made in-house. Perhaps this will change when the management hones in on its culinary vision, but at this point the menu seems a little haphazard.\n\nThe wine list was well-chosen, but for the caliber of this restaurant it was noticeably short. I understand that the wine management is in the process of bulking up the list significantly, which I think will help move the program up to the next level.\n\nThe space is large, in fact a bit over-large. It felt too linear, and the seating is set up in long rows like a diner -- very unimaginative. The interior is not ugly, just noticeably boring and too spacious.\n\nAll that said, any other city in America excepting perhaps Chicago and New York this restaurant is easily a five-star place. But this is San Francisco, and standards are higher. Great food, but other little details need attention. Keep an eye on Prospect, though. It has great potential.", "author": "Paul S."}

I have a big sweet tooth though.\n\nFinally our entrees came. I went with The Lumberjack which had corn cakes and sausage that I still dream about!

Lobster mushrooms were also described on the menu for this dish but I didn't really see or taste any. They were probably cut very finely? The pinot noir we ordered complimented the salmon nicely. Our server told me the salmon would be medium rare, but I found it to be more on the medium to medium-well side :-/ Not a huge bother for me, but others would probably be a little miffed by this...\n\nMy husband enjoyed his duck very much.

Prospect, which I had never been to before, lived up to my expectations with the execution of their food and service. Even though none of us were very dressed up for the restaurant (which was my fault for not figuring out that the dress code was a bit more on the side of dressy than casual), the waitress was extremely polite, warm, and friendly. \n\nLooking at the menu, we decided to do three appetizers to share and one entree (for 3 people). We ordered the spaghetti (because it had razor clams), the lobster risotto, and the heirloom cucumber salad. These appetizers are definitely meant to be individually portioned, but I have to say I loved the flavors of both the spaghetti and risotto. The salad was a bit lackluster and the only thing that really stood out was the sweetness and freshness of the cucumbers (for the price, I wouldn't get it again though). The risotto had a copious amount of lobster essence and the roasted cauliflower married nicely with the risotto. The lobster bits of course were delicious, but I could eat that risotto for days. The spaghetti was also very nice, albeit a bit more on the acidic side. The clams in the dish were also tender and juicy, almost as if once you bit into them, they just popped and released that delicate clam flavor to compliment the spaghetti. I really liked this dish, as well as my friend, but my boyfriend found it too tart for his liking. For the entree, we ordered the kobe beef bavette and my oh my I think that is definitely one of the best restaurant steaks I've had. Being a skirt steak cut, that beef was so unbelievably tender and flavorful! I almost wanted to order another one because it was that good. I also loved that the potato crisps were actually made of creamy yet fluffy mashed potatoes. For dessert, we ordered a strawberry and pistachio tart that was absolutely delicious as well. It had just the right amount of sweetness and the tart had a beautiful texture almost like a meringue. The raspberry sorbet and sour cream ice cream were a nice accompaniment to the tart as well. On top of that of the wonderful food, all the dishes were plated beautifully.

The portion size was about right for the price.  Going for cooking 4 very different types of cuts in different ways again very ambitious but the cooking was very uneven. \n\nWife's meal started with foie gras torchon.  This was really good.  4 stars.  But her entree of dayboat scallops with asparagus just didn't work.  Cooking of the ingredients was very good, but the flavor combo just didn't complement each other.  Much prefer the more traditional pairing in spring of fresh english peas.\n\nFor dessert we got the s'mores.  There are 4 to an order, perfect for nibbling with our cappuccinos.\n\nWe will certainly come back again.  Always like restaurants that are pushing the envelope on what they are trying to do with high quality ingredients in unique combos or techniques.  Tonight they just weren't able to pull it off in the kitchen partly due to the skill of preparation and a couple times on risky combinations.  But I give them 5 stars for the attempt and friendly, professional service.", "author": "Bob K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-10", "description": "Finally, we made it for brunch.  The one thing I hate about brunch in the city is if you're not the first one in line when the doors open, it's guaranteed that you will have to wait a min of 45min+ for a table and usually the food is meh, so why lose half a day.   \n\nHowever, Prospect takes reservations!  There's no long wait in a tiny crowded restaurant with annoying people yabbering or shoving you aside.  Prospect is a large and airy restaurant where each table has enough personal space for you to have an intimate meal with a loved one.  We had nicely paced brunch spending 1.5 hours eating good food and having a ball catching up over the weekend's events.  \n\nAdditionally, many would think it'd be a snooty place to go, but it wasn't pretentious at all; everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating and its quiet and very laid back.  \n\nOur meal:\n\n1)Green Goddess Salad: $11\n- a mix of lettuces with cucumber, avocado and a caper vinaigrette; nice tang, well dressed and the crispiest and freshest salad I've ever had.  It tasted it was just picked from a garden and tossed for our salad.  My only complaint is the size especially relative to cost of the other items.  It was like eating a baby salad.  I'd probably skip this and concentrate on other items.\n\n2)Prospector: $15\n-pork shoulder with potatoes, corn skillet cakes and eggs your way (I had their \"soft egg\", which is their sous vide egg, much like a poached egg, but the yolk is a bit more solid).  This dish was delightful and the perfect dish if you can't decide between a savoury or sweet brunch dish b/c this satisfies both.  However, be fairly warned it's like eating a giant slab of pork belly b/c of the layers of fat and meat; it's practically a 1:1 ratio and I didn't trim the fat, I ate each bite enjoying the silkiness of the fat coating the meat. Mmmm Mmmm.  \n\nLiberty Duck Sausage: $16\n-house made duck sausage (you get two), with cheddar grits, broccoli and pecans and brown butter.  We also added a soft egg.  The dish was perfect, amazing grits with just enough tang from the cheddar and the broccoli had this nice coating of an acidic sauce that balanced and lightened the creaminess of the grits.  The sausage was a little mild in flavour, I would have preferred something with a stronger gamey taste.  \n\n3)Meyer Lemon Poppy Donuts: $8\n-these come hot to the table and have this tangy lemon sauce to dip of spoon over your donuts.  It was much like a old fashion donut with the crust and flavour.  It has the perfect balance of meyer lemon peel and poppy seeds in the donut.  I'd order this again in a heart beat.\n\n4)Rhubarb Vanilla Panna Cotta: $9\n-this dish was about different flavours, textures, and temperatures all in one bite.  It was amazing!  In one bite, you could have a cool tangy rhubarb sorbet, with a creamy panna cotta, a bite of tender rhubarb (not overly sweet or mushy; it still had enough integrity and stood it's own), and cookies of some sort sprinkled throughout the dish (sorry can't remember).  \n\nWe didn't get drinks after going to a wedding the night before and were really dehydrated, so we stuck with water and coffee for some kick, but it all looked amazing.  They had a good selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Can't wait to stop by for happy hour or dinner!", "author": "Miss H."}

When it came I was shocked to discover that the whole appetizer was about 1 mouthful of food. I had to call over the woman server who brought the food if this truly was what they regularly serve and not an anomaly. I mentioned that I was a yelper and what she brought does not resemble in anyway to the photos that other yelpers uploaded. I mean their black cod had a shrimp(an actual shrimp and not a prosciutto sliver of shrimp which she assured me was hiding under the heavy coating that it was fried in) as an accompaniment. What I got was a tiny sliver of shrimp covered in heavy coating, the shrimp was the thickness of a slice of prosciutto and the size of 2 quarters together.   Their black cod was the size of 4 quarters worth.  Maybe they should just measure their food by quarters.  Oh sir, here is your 5 quarters worth of food for $29!\n\n1 mouth full of food for $16 which including the tax and SF health tax came to $18.49(approx) At this rate it is more expensive than French Laundry. I guess the benefit would be you do not have to reserve 2 months in advance and have their sommelier rip you for $50/glass of wine. \n\nI asked for the check and went home and heated up my Lamb Vindaloos from Trader's Joe ($3) so I do not go hungry. \n\nI am all for fine cuisine, however this is a little ridiculous. I do admit that they were quite nice and service was good after a little prodding(I had to ask another server who my server was). I guess this was a $22 (after tax and tip) lesson that the state of SF dining is just not what it used to be. Extremely disappointing.  I know I have been ripped off.

The interior is sleek, with clean lines, warm colors, wooden floors, yet modern at the same time.\n\nWe arrived approx 15 min late due to rain and our table of 10 was waiting for us.

Good stuff.\n\nOne of the highlights for appetizers were the tasty crispy pig trotters which were lightly breaded and fried.  We also ordered the vialone nano risotto which consisted of burrata, hazelnut & shaved fresh burgundian truffle.  This was extremely yummy with huge thin slices of truffle a major plus (truffle lover here).\n\nMy main dish was the storm hill beef new york made with (taken from the menu) french onion potato cake with gruyere cheese, haricot vert roasted king trumpet & smoked maitake mushrooms, beef jus, in medium.  This was cooked to perfection and I would order this again :P\n\nOn another note the chicken dish my sister ordered impressed me.

One of the highly anticipated openings this year in the city, it features a contemporary American menu with an emphasis on local and sustainable ingredients (though, who doesn't nowadays in San Francisco?).\n\nWe started off with a few appetizers.\n\nYellowtail Crudo seaweed rice cracker, pickled cucumber, white miso - This yellowtail, pounded thin, was accompanied by crunchy pickled cucumber and a little bit of a mild miso flavor. These clean, bright flavors were complemented by the textural addition of the crunchy seaweed rice crackers.\n\nHandpicked Dungeness Crab chilled beets, vadouvan yogurt, spiced onion rings - The crab was in nice chunks, sweet and tasty. The beets were also good, while some onion rings provided a nice crunch. I would have liked a little more crab in this dish, however.\n\nSeared Calamari & Octopus house made chorizo, savory clams, aillade, confit garlic potatoes - This dish looked really interesting, and it didn't disappoint. Squid, octopus and clams were all present in this dish, and I really liked the slightly spicy, smoky chorizo.  The potatoes added some heaviness to this dish making it a filling, yet delicious, appetizer. I thought the octopus was a little chewy though, especially compared to the tender calamari.\n\nBlack Cod shiso shrimp fritter, shiitakes, snap peas, red curry - The black cod was extremely moist and flaky. Very nice. The curry added some extra depth of flavor.\n\nRoasted Quail wild rice, broccoli romanesco, fuyu persimmon, almonds, brown butter - Very nice preparation of quail here with a good char on the outside and a very juicy and moist interior. Lots of flavor.\n\nCalifornia White Sea Bass chanterelles, celery root & sunchoke puree, oyster bisque emulsion, crispy sunchokes - This was much denser and less moist than the black cod. I wouldn't say it was dry, but it didn't have the same moist flakiness as the cod.\n\nLamb Loin fingerling potatoes, artichoke, marcona almond romesco, green olive, mint & tongue relish - This was a nice preparation of lamb - very tender and flavorful.\n\nWagyu Zabuton butterball potatoes, creamed cippolinis, smoked trumpet mushrooms, spinach, mustard seed jus - I ordered this medium rare, and this turned out to be sort of on the lower side of medium rare. As a result, the meat was kind of chewy (not tough) for my tastes. The flavor of the meat was good though, with the mustard seed jus adding depth of flavor. The spinach and buttery potatoes were great accompaniments.\nNext we tried three of the desserts on the menu.\n\nPetit S'mores house made peppermint marshmallows, graham wafers, melted ganache, crushed candy canes - I really enjoyed these holiday s'mores. The cookie was gingerbread, the marshmallows were peppermint, and there were some crushed candy canes on top, all adding to the holiday theme. The ganache and marshmallows were warm and gooey - in tandem with the gingerbread cookie, these were comforting and delicious.\n\nIce Cream Sandwiches chocolate cookies, eggnog ice cream - I love ice cream sandwiches so this was a must-try. In keeping with the holiday theme, eggnog ice cream was the choice. While the cookie and ice cream were both good individually, the cookie was way too hard; as a result, the ice cream just squeezed out after each bite...defeating the purpose of the sandwich. I don't understand how this was overlooked.\n\nHouse Made Ice Cream chocolate brownie chunk - Lastly, we tried this ice cream. A very good ice cream with a deep chocolate flavor, though not exceptional.\n\nI was pretty happy with this meal. I thought the menu was interesting, and offered variety of appealing dishes that tasted good. While nothing was mindblowing, all of the dishes \"worked\" for me and were things I'd come back for.

I have come to expect a level of consistency that just wasn't there that night.

Our after dinner drink Kelt XO - great caramel notes...delicious! \n\nAfter we completed our meal we decided to stay and have a few more drinks at the communal table. We ordered Dom Ruinart Rose NV which we had to send back as my drinking companions were not pleased. The sommlier handled the situation professionally (as he should) and we opted for the Delamotte Blanc de Blancs Les Mesnil-Sur-Oger, Champagne 1999. YUM! Our last bottle that we tried was Rocche dei Manzoni Vigna Capella di Santo Stefano di Perno, Barolo, Piemonte 2001 which had to chilled a little for us. Not sure where the bottle came from (storage?) but it was pretty warm. \n\nOverall wonderful dining experience - but I think I enjoyed the wonderful wines more so. \n\nTip - if you bring your own bottle corkage is $25. But if you buy a bottle they will refund your corkage fee!", "author": "Julie F."}

Three of the four of us found little of interest on the menu, so we ordered appetizers. Their \"special\" appetizer, a polenta with mushrooms and egg yoke, came lukewarm with scarcely few mushrooms. The only happy member of our group ordered the steak, however he ordered the steak because nothing else appealed. We are well-traveled \"foodies\" and we all appreciate adventurous food. Perhaps this place should not try so hard. I think it works as a fun bar scene for the young, high earning twenty and thirty -something's.

I thought that was exciting, though as everyone knows there are bound to be mishaps along the way of experiencing a restaurants' first service. \n\nSo there were definitely more positive things to mention about Prospect than the negative ones.  I tried to make a reservation through OpenTable but they were all booked up.  I talked to the reservationist and she said they would be happy to accept us as a walk-in.  I really appreciated that, hostesses are rarely that wonderful.  We got and sat down, I enjoyed the space.  It was modern and bright, using a lot of natural light and had large windows allowing me to people watch. \n\nThe service was a little bit of a mixed bag for me.  She started off well, not a fan of servers wearing nose jewelry during service, but it's not my restaurant.  The menu read strangely, with the main dishes in larger font on the top of the menu, with the appetizers on the bottom.  The structure was odd, so we needed help.  Of course, we ordered way too much, but I do that everywhere I go..\n\nOur server did an adequate job coursing everything out for us, but of course being their first service there were obvious delays.  THE SMALL PLATES WERE AMAZING!  This place should be a tapas restaurant, because they were amazing.  We had the donuts, the sweet corn cakes, some slow-egg dish, we were enthralled.  I even told the table next to ours to order the corn cakes.  The larger plates absolutely sucked, honestly I felt that we were experiences to different chefs.  The prawns with jalapeno grits was inedible as was the omelette which was horribly undercooked.  I guess it didn't matter because the small plates were utter heaven.\n\nThe server did make a mistake in our order.  There was a grilled cheese with optional truffle and egg, and it came out without the egg and truffle.  I don't stutter and when she replied, \"I didn't hear you order it that way.\" and also didn't offer to fix her mistake, I wanted to hit her.  First rule, if you fuck up, admit it, apologize, and fix your mistake.  Don't just say, I didn't know and walk away.  Also, she knew we were in the food industry, and why would I just order a grilled cheese sandwich, did we look retarded?  \n\nOne more thing I will mention is that the bartending is a joke.  A master mixologist, who I have heard is great with her alcoholic concoctions was an EPIC failure when it came to non-alcoholic drinks.  I don't drink and I do expect the same amount of effort to go into a N/A drink as you would put into a traditional one.  (*sidenote* I swear to God, if I get one more lemonadesque drink I am gonna kill myself)  The second drink tasted like soda water and mint.  It was gross.  You are a master mixologist, you should be able to make anything.  I expect more from you and honestly I would have been embarrassed. \n\nOverall, 4 stars is how I felt my experience was minus the mishaps of the service, the entrees and the n/a drinks.  I still really liked this place.  The small plates were wonderful enough to warrant a return.  Its been about a month now, so you should have worked out your kinks.  I am coming in for dinner soon.

It came with this salty toast bread to spread the Foie Gras on along with two figs and a tasty apple compote. I have to admit that I used my table knife to threaten the wifey when she attempted to take more than what I judged to be her fare share of Foie Gras. For the entrees she had the duck and I the berkshire pork. We both gobbled the food on our plates down big grins and little talk. For desert I went with the ice cream sandwiches that were totally awesome and she had the sticky toffee cake. The toffee cake was not bad and it wasn't that it didn't have some redeeming qualities, but it just wasn't as awesome as everything else we had last night.\n\nI would totally recommend this restaurant for its delicious food, its super attentive staff (the busboy came over and folded my napkin while I was in the bathroom for gods sake), its your letting the wife know how much she means to you decor, and its general ability to make it feel like your getting a good value even after you have to clear your throat when the bill comes.

We were an alternating group of ten or so, who may have been a little too loud and a little too flirty with practically the entire wait-staff.  Robin was having none of it.  I thought at first I thought she was being rude. Surely it couldn't have been us?  Did she not enjoy our witty banter, our probable annoying questions and our prodding of who on the incredibly good-looking Prospect staff was single and who wasn't? Impossible. \n\nBut then I mistakenly order the wrong wine with my salmon, Robin looked at me sternly and said, \"No. You'll have the pinot because your ordered the salmon, right?\"  That's when I knew she was not being short, she was being awesome.  She's one of those professional servers that doesn't bullshit around.  No lingering, no over-chatting but not rude.  She knows what she is doing and is seemingly training customers on how to behave one table at a time. She is a restaurant etiquette vigilante.\n\nTopped with the most delicious salmon I have ever tasted in my life, I won't soon forget mine and Robin's time together.

(seriously, the sauvignon blanc and pinot noir we had were SO GOOD - I wish I could tell you what they were, but I just drank what I was given).\nWe tried loads of the food:\nBread with the salted butter is always a win, theirs was no exception.\nWe were graced with chips and onion dip to share as a treat - we were practically licking the bowl clean on that one.\nWe shared the trotters (don't be scared by the description - they were really tasty), the kampachi crudo (omg delicious), the day boat/Nantucket bay scallops (those Nantuckets were melt in your mouth tender, the romanesco was perfection, but the risotto just okay), the beef tartare (very good), and the wild nettle tagliatelle (omg omg omg).  Look - there were a lot of us at this dinner, don't judge.\nFor my \"entree\" I had the baby beet salad which while beautiful, was not the best choice for the evening.  I think it would have worked better for me as a shared plate: I only at about half of it (beet overload), and while the pistachio and cocoa nib crumble and frozen greek yogurt were good, they felt more like desert.  That prosciutto chip should be served with everything though.\nThe let down of the night was the bourbon ice cream, which was just a little bit too light for our expectations.  Maybe bourbon CARAMEL ice cream would've been more up our alley.\nThe sorbet (grapefruit, champagne, basil, kitchen sink I believe it was) was amazing - refreshing, delicious, and totally fancy.  Like, too fancy for me to be allowed to eat it, but so so good.\nI snagged a bite of the Valrhona chocolate cake, but was a little turned off by the mouthfeel from the cocoa powder all over the top of the cake - it just sucked every bit of moisture out of my mouth.\nAll in all, an amazing and highly recommended dining experience.

The overall plate is meat-heavy, and the fregola seems a little like filler.\n\nOverall it was very nice to see goat, a fresh approach to it, and great execution.  \n\nProspect is a bit pricey.  There's a veal dish that's $40 which seems a bit exorbitant; usually in that range you see \"money\" ingredients like foie gras on the plate.  But I'm sure it's worth every penny.\n\nBased on their food tonight I'd recommend Prospect unreservedly.", "author": "J W."}

Unfortunately, it's in one of the least cozy neighborhoods in the city - the financial district - and the decor, while nice, is glinty and generic in the manner of Fancy Supper Clubs the world over.\n\nThe clientele is glinty as well; ladies, don't skimp on the jewelry and heels. One highlight of the evening was watching the Marina girls chew with their mouths open.\n\nAll is redeemed by the menu. I had the pig trotters as an appetizer and then the goat. Frankly, I found the pig trotters to be on the bland side but sugar daddy tried them and told me I was crazy. \n\nThe goat was amazing. It was a complex, subtle dish with a lot going on, and every bite was a delicious adventure. Sounds cheesy, but I loved it. \n\nSugar daddy had the sea urchin risotto, which he seemed to like, and the pork cheeks, which he let me try and which were also amazing. I love pork. I'll probably order that next time. \n\nFor dessert, I had the Black & Tan. Though I thought the name was questionable (the Black and Tans were a paramilitary unit during the Irish Civil War), it was a delicious brownie-chocolate-cream extravaganza. It was really, really good. Sugar daddy had the molten walnut cake with vanilla ice cream and said it was good. Frankly, it paled beside my dessert.\n\nService was friendly and well-timed.

The preparations have always been spot on, featuring a really unique mix of complex flavors without going overboard or trying too hard.\n\nService has been good to very good.  It's odd, but there have been a few instances where the server had a bit of attitude--kind of a \"I am doing you a favor\" type of vibe.

We made last minute reservations for 4 people on a Saturday night and were pleased to find that they could accommodate us.  \n\nThe decor is modern/contemporary.  My only complaint is the width of the dining tables.  We found it really hard to hear or talk to our friends sitting opposite us.  The couple sitting next to us said the same thing.  Unfortunately, they were on a date.  SOOO, if you are looking for an intimate date spot where you can cuddle up or play footsies under the table - don't go here.  However, it would be great for a power business lunch.  \n\nFood:\n\n1) Black cod - not memorable \n2) Yellow tail crudo - my friend liked it (although it looked really rubbery to me)\n3) Green goddess salad - my other friend also liked it\n4) Wagyu beef - YUM! I had not had steak in awhile and it was the most perfect piece of meat.  The marbling was fantastic and cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Happy Camper! \n5)  Fish - My husband hated it.  It was drizzled with a yellow sauce that resembled Velveeta cheese to him.  He declared he's not coming back. \n\nFor dessert, we had the donuts and the berries with chocolate sauce.  I am picky about donuts.  I like them very light and not too sweet.  These donuts are the opposite.  The berries were yum but you can't go wrong with fresh berries dipped in chocolate. \n\nWhat disappointed the boys the most this evening though was the liquor selection.  They picked very expensive scotch (that was recommended by the server) and 2 types of tequila that they both HATED.  That's a strong word to use for Irish guys that love to drink but yes they HATED it.  We had to go over to Bourbon & Branch for a proper drink afterwards. \n\nThe service this evening was sporadic.  The bar drinks took a long time to get to us, but the food service and our server was pleasant and very knowledgeable.", "author": "Denise T."}

My companion knew one of the bartenders, so he made us some fun and interesting drinks.  \n\nI didn't get a chance to eat here, but looking at some of the reviews, I'd really like to check it out!  Some of the dishes sound amazing.\n\nThe cocktails were damn good.  The bar area is a bit crowded, but that could be expected for a Saturday night.  \n\nThe pricing is either a lot better than I would expect, or we got comp'd for one of the drinks.  The bill came to $26 and that was for three drinks.  Most cocktails are $10+ so something happened there.  I didn't look closely at the bill.\n\nOnly drawback, the walls are glass windows.  Which is nice.  Until you look out and see a homeless guy sitting on the curb throwing up.  It's not a bad area of SOMA, but it's not far from some so it's not unusual to see some of the skuzzy parts of the city out the windows.  Which doesn't do much for the appetite or mood.  But I won't blame the restaurant for that.

I immediately made reservations, and was able to get a table for a friend and I just a week after the restaurant's opening.  \n\nWe started with the potato dumplings over a bed of greens.  While the portions were extremely small, the flavors were not.  The dumplings were crispy and slightly sweet, and I wished for just a few more.  For my main course, I had the halibut, with root vegetables over a root vegetable puree.  As was the case with the appetizer, the portion was small (half the size of a normal halibut steak), but it was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The fish was lightly seared and the flavors blended well with the puree mixture.  \n\nWe opted not to have dessert this time, although if I had ordered something, it would have been the cheese plate.  \n\nI walk by this place everyday on my way home from work, and no matter what day it is, it is always busy.  The bar area in particular is high-energy, and I look forward to having my next after work drink here.

Hard to do both at the same time and especially if it is larger party.\n\nThe Green Goddess Salad was superb and felt like it was the right salad for this time of year.  Just the right amount of cucumber and avocado a slightly tangy and salty caper Vinaigrette.\n\nThe Roasted Quail was a perfect dish and set in an early Autumnal stage; roasted almonds, honey, micro bits of bacon, and black mission fig.  The Quail was absolutely delightful.\n\nThe Storm Hill Beef Ribeye, the third plate, a choice cut of beef, finished as ordered and balanced with a beer battered onion ring, smoked trumpet mushroom and roasted shallot butter.  This was a larger piece that I would have expected.\n\nAnd finally finishing with the Griddled Peach Crepe--a large plate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-21", "description": "When you walk into Prospect, you get the sense that every little detail about the place has been carefully planned out. The color scheme, the wood accents, the furnishings. All to create that upscale experience to impress the client or date. \n\nThe space is beautiful. It has a nice open layout, with the well-equipped bar the first thing you see as you walk in. The front area of the restaurant is occupied by bar seating and a small lounge area, which is a perfect place to grab a few of their signature cocktails. On a weekday, there wasn't an unmanageable crowd, so it was nice to hang back and take in the scenery as we waited for our table. The first thing I noticed was that the bar menu offers a few things not on the dinner menu. There's a *secret* burger that you have to ask the server about. That alone is enough to lure me back for another visit. \n\nOnce seated, we got right down to business with the menu:\n\n1) Stuffed squash blossoms and mussel fritters: I stand by my allegation that squash blossoms themselves have no taste, and are thus simply a vessel for whatever they're stuffed with. In this case, they were stuffed with an amazingly succulent preparation of lobster meat. How they are able to deep fry the squash blossoms without drying out the lobster is beyond me, but they were outstanding. The mussel fritters were also excellent. Plump and juicy, good flavor, but still crispy on the outside. \n\n2) Seared calamari and octopus: I have a soft spot for octopus and calamari. I guess I just like my cephalopods. The octopus was tender and well dressed, while the squid was stuffed with chorizo. Although I love chorizo, the flavor of chorizo is really so strong that it overwhelms everything else. While the textures complemented each other well, I would have preferred that they simply highlight the squid itself. \n\n3) Dayboat scallops:  The scallops were nicely seared, good seasoning, but scallops being what they are, are typically very simply prepared. If you like scallops, you'll like these. The fava beans and refried cranberry beans were very good, though. \n\n4) New York beef: A wonderfully cooked piece of meat. Medium rare, nice crust, extremely juicy and tender on the inside. Really good. Broccolini was a little salty, roasted potato cake was good. \n\n5) Caramel corn with cocoa nibs: Honestly, this was a major reason I decided to come here. Ever since my trip to Chicago and a taste of fresh Garrett's caramel popcorn, I've been craving caramel popcorn. This was kind of a fancy version. Caramel popcorn was light, sweet, crunchy, everything caramel popcorn should be. Cocoa nibs added that chocolatey accent, but it's not as rich as Garrett's. On the bar menu, they were serving rosemary caramel popcorn, so I'd be interested to know what that's like. \n\nHad a glass of Rioja that was outstanding with my beef. Service had a bit of a lag, but they were apologetic about it. Prices were probably what I would expect to pay at a place like this. Overall a great meal. \n\nCome for the popcorn, stay for the food.", "author": "Saunders C."}

The octopus is tender, grilled perfectly, and comes with delicious smoky mediterranean sauces - one tastes like harissa (smokey red pepper sauce). Seasoned perfectly. \n\nHAMACHI CARPACCIO: Super fresh and thinly sliced hamachi, yummy creamy sauce drizzled on top, and crispy chips! \n\nBUFFALO CARPACCIO: Such a surprisingly delicious dish - raw thin slices of buffalo (tastes like beef!) with 2 crunchy deep fried oysters on top! \nSOFT SHELL CRAB: Who doesn't love fried crab, it is sooo good here and comes with a creamy delicious sauce with corn in it.\n\nWAGYU BEEF: My second favorite dish here, perfectly seared and tender inside, a light sauce (looks like mustard seeds but not sure because it doesn't taste like mustard), perfectly seasoned. Comes with braised chard, simple red potatoes with a hollandaise-ish sauce on top of the potatoes that is surprisingly light.  Also comes with yummy trumpet mushrooms. \n\nSOLE: I don't have many details about this dish because I didn't order it but tasted it from my mom and it was soo good. I was surprised because I don't like to order sole from restaurants since it's usually a boring dish, but this one was amazing!\n\nLAMB: I'm not a big lamb fan but I loved this - not to gamey, perfectly medium rare, very flavorful. \n\nCOCKTAILS: My favorite is the Whaler- tastes alot like a Pisco Sour with the sweet and sour combination and foamy egg white top.

Will have to try with pig next time.\n-Yellowtail Crudo was fresh and light, yet flavorful.\n-Potato Dumplings - the wild mushrooms and arugula sauce were a perfect pair for the spot-on dumplings. Not too airy, not too dense...just right.\n-Black Cod. Delish. Need I say more?\n-Wagyu beef with spinach, baby potatoes and onions with a mouthwatering piece of beef. Yum!\n-Cherries with greek yogurt ice cream and thyme pavlova, made me want to crawl into my jammies and eat a couple more bowls.\n\nOverall: fantastic!!!", "author": "Erin K."}

And then they add some flare on top of that.\n\nOn what can only be described as a brisk San Francisco night, my family and I strolled in to this fine establishment.  I had previously sampled some of their dessert menu and some cocktails, but remained deprived of the true culinary delights this establishment has to offer.\n\nSmothered by a plethora of choices from the starter and entree menus, we decided to pick several of the appetizers and a couple of main courses.  For us, the Crispy Pig Trotters and Foie Gras Torchon scored high marks for the unique, rich flavors offered.  \n\nNot to be upstaged by their predecessors, the Dayboat Scallops and Wagyu Zabuton did not fail to impress, offering quality cuisine with sides to match.  The Zabuton (the American take on Kobe's world-renowned beef) was cooked perfectly, with savory juices flowing with each successive bite.  What really separated this dish for me was what complimented the unmistakeably tender meat: toasted nettles, maitake mushrooms, and farro.  I would order this dish again in a heartbeat and suggest you do too on your visit to Prospect, which is quaintly located in San Francisco's ever-transforming South of Market neighborhood.", "author": "D L."}

So it didn't take long for us to put in our order. \n\nIt was at least 40 minutes before the first item, Monkey Bread, was served. I am fairly certain that it is not baked on site. After we quickly devoured it since we were all starving, we waited yet another 20 minutes without food and decided that we want to talk to the manager about this ridiculous wait time. Then somehow all our food magically appeared! The manager stopped by and apologized. We asked if they were short staffed that morning and the answer was no. She said that she wouldn't offer any excuses for this delay and just kept apologizing. I wasn't even sure what to make of this explanation - they were not short staffed and that they really had no valid reason for the delay. So does that mean this ridiculously slow service is just normal? \n\nThe brunch was okay, just like any other breakfast food that you can get elsewhere.

If fractional stars were allowed, I'd say, hmmmmmmmm................3.625.\n\nWe were a party of two and we shared three starters, one main dish, a dessert, a bottle of wine and two glasses of dessert wine.  Three of our four dishes were outstanding in taste and presentation:  Green Goddess Salad, Potato Dumplings, and Pork Cheeks.  The fourth, Porcini Mushrooms, was less memorable.  I wasn't as thoroughly disappointed with it as J.W., but her/his detailed description did strike a chord of recognition with me.\n\nALL four dishes were \"outstanding\" in one sense:  they easily could compete for the \"Smallest Portion Imaginable\" award.  Without the dessert and dessert wines, I'm sure our stomachs would be growling with hunger even as we paid the check.  I probably haven't picked a restaurant based on food quantity in over 25 years, but I found the miniscule portions at Prospect almost comical.  Example:  The Green Goddess Salad had four asparagus spears, two cucumber wedges, two small cauliflower florets, and dressing ($12).  :-O  \n\nLook, my body fat is 13% and I don't have any eating disorders, so it's not like I want or expect to pig out -- whether at home or dining out.  But two additional asparagus spears in the salad, besides satisfying more patrons with normal appetites and expectations, would make Prospect's management look less ridiculous.\n\nThe space is chic and comfortable, with just the right acoustics -- a good, warm buzz of conversation, but not so loud you can't have a private chat over your meal.  I enjoy the look and feel of a dark, dense wood table, but given the refinement of the menu and wine list, I think the experience would be better balanced overall with the addition of tablecloths.  It's not that I'm particularly traditional or old-fashioned.  Tablecloths serve useful, underappreciated purposes:  they prevent tableware from sliding around and eliminate the sound of it being placed on bare wood.\n\nProspect's wine list is impressive, and so is the sommelier.\n\nThe servers were about as you'd expect at this price point, but no better.\n\nI predict Prospect will quietly increase its food portions soon.  The number of complaints on yelp about skimpy plates is notable, maybe even unprecedented.  The owners obviously are off to a good start, and they surely have too much invested to risk disappointing so many people just to save the cost of two asparagus spears and one mushroom on a $185 meal tab.", "author": "Francisco G."}

Also, if you're sensitive to high noise levels, you may want to think twice before making reservations, we had a large booth in the back and it was still a bit loud.\n\nI went here the other night with some friends from LA and ordered a 4 course tasting with no restrictions.

Chopin is NOT Russian Vodka, and a disgusting aperitif is not an 'acquired taste' it's just gross).\n\nWe started off with one of their specialty cocktails which wasn't drinkable.  We then ordered a ton of food.\n\nThe first batch took an hour and was out of order to how he stated that he put the food in.  The plates were hot, but the food was dry.  My wife claims that means it was stuck under the heat lamp for a while.\n\nThe second batch took another 45 minutes.  And was cold.  And had to be wrestled out of the kitchen by the manager.  The waiter blamed the kitchen, but I'm pretty sure that when the food comes out cold, it's been sitting there for a while.  I'm also sure that when it comes out immediately when you ask the manager for it, it's been sitting there for a while.\n\nNot to keep harping on the annoying waiter, how was the food?  Well, it wasn't good.  There was maybe one dish that was OK, but quite frankly, the rest of it was rather mediocre, and extremely expensive.  If the bill was 1/4th what it was, the food still wasn't that good.\n\nThe manager came over and as an apology told us to 'save room for desert,' and that it would be on the house.  Over 2 hours in, we weren't particularly interested in getting desert, but for some reason we soldiered on and ordered three deserts. \n\nWe got the stone fruit ice cream, the smores and something else.  The ice cream (and don't ask which stone fruit was used or you might get a snotty response) wasn't very good, but when mixed with a gingerbread cracker was gross.  The smores were almost unedible, and I didn't even try the third one.\n\nAs for the ambiance, it's a giant room with a lot of tables.  So if you like it loud and trendy it's perfect.  This place would do great in LA, but with so many good options in the city, stay away.\n\nI gave it two stars because the manager comped us about $40 worth of our meal.

The hostess was highly accommodating.  My friend and I arrived separately, and we were seated right away.  Our drink orders were taken immediately.\n\nThe ambiance was bustling in this swanky downtown scene on a Friday night.  We were given small complimentary apps...a nice welcoming touch.  My friend and I both ordered Pompelmo Frizzantes, an amazing sparkling wine cocktail with fresh lemon, grapefruit and vanilla.  You can taste and see the fresh vanilla beans on your palate.  We enjoyed a couple of these throughout the night.  \n\nI came from a work event and therefore did not have room for a starter.  However I did want to try the halibut tartar which I've heard is fantastic.  We both ordered the fresh fish plates (not the salmon unf I can't recall) as our main entree.  My plate was a little salty for my taste but I tend to eat fish a little more bland.  The potatoes were amazing.  My friend loved her dish and cleared her entire plate.  We of course had another fabulous Pompelmo Frizzante and skipped dessert, as we were behaving.  :)\n\nI recommend this restaurant to anyone who has not yet tried it.

I ordered a mint julep that was made really well and tasted great.\n\nBut its really about the food. Started with Foi Gra and it was just incredible. Smooth, buttery and rich just wish they gave you more than 3 small pieces of toast to go with it since it's a pretty generous portion of foi gras. We also got the Potato gniocchi. Light fluffy and really tasty. Definitely another winner. Both starters were excellent.\n\nHere are the true stars. We were both being pretty indulgent and she got the goat dish. Basically 4 different parts of the goat including a goat sausageand I got the rib eye. The rib eye was cooked to perfection medium rare just as I asked for and seasoned perfectly. I barely needed a knife as the meat was so tender. It came with some grilled veges and some sort of mushroom that was also really really good. Or course what goes good with a steak but something fried like the onion rings it came with. Can you tell I enjoyed my steak?\n\nHad I not had the steak in front of me I'd probably be ooing and awwing about the goat since every cut was delicious. But the steak was such a winner it was hard to compare.\n\nSo based on what I've said you'd think wow sounds like a 5 star experience. It was up until desert. We went all out and ordered the mud pie type of desert. Some kind of chocolate cake with ice cream. Wow what a disappointment. My gf never leaves leftovers when it comes to desert and we both got through about half of it and put our spoons down and looked at each and both just said \"eh not too good\". Surprising considering the rest of our meal was so good.\n\nBut don't let that small part about the desert we chose sway you from coming here. Everything else we had including the caramel popcorn was excellent. We'll definitely be going back to try the other tasty items on the menu. We also found out they have a more inexpensive bar menu that I can't wait to try.\n\n\nAfter all the talk about food let me also mention the service was on point. Not too in your face but at the same time I never had to ask for anything.

With that said, this comment is long overdue: PROSPECT IS AMAZING!\n\nI've had the opportunity to try a number of dishes at Prospect, namely the green goddess salad, black cod, yellowtail crudo, scallops, pork cheeks, wagyu beef, and the chicken.  NOTE: these are just a few of the dishes I've gobbled down.  I have tried almost everything on the menu but the above-named are the most memorable for me.  All in all, the food here is incredible.  Seriously, everything I've tried at Prospect has been cooked perfectly with fantastic flavors - my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  \n\nThe drinks and desserts are also worth mentioning.  I think I ate an entire bowl of the caramel corn by myself and I can't stop craving those hand-held peach pies.  I can't remember the names of the cocktails I ordered (because I ordered a different one each time!) but I think I've tried them all, and there isn't one I didn't like.  Of course, you've gotta be in a cocktail kind of mood because some of these drinks will knock you off your feet!  \n\nThere are so many things I want to say about Prospect but I don't want to bore you with the details, so I'll just sum it all up right here - beautiful interior design, easy parking (btw, I live in the South Bay, so I have to drive a long way to get there and if parking sucks, which it doesn't at Prospect, it always ruins the night), the wait staff is superb, and reservation times are honored.  But these are just minute details - if anything's going to get you to Prospect and KEEP you there, it's the food.  Try it.  You won't regret it.", "author": "Natalie C."}

Happy to say that it completely met my expectations! The space was much larger than I had expected and had a certain simple charm to it. Service was good as well, especially considering that it was opening week. On to the food and drinks! \n\nIf you go, please try the Mr. White - tequila, strawberry, mint...all come together beautifully and it was potent (just the way I like it)! Lucky for me, my sister's a lightweight and I was able to lend her a helping hand with her drink as well. :)\n\nIn terms of food, the winners for me included the calamari, soft shell crab, and all the entrees on the table (pork cheeks, wagyu bavette, and lamb loin and rib). All of the entrees were cooked perfectly and there wasn't any food left on any of our plates. \n\nI will definitely be returning soon.

Had a burnt orange peel scotch cocktail leading up to dinner while my friend enjoyed something frothy with egg-whites, both were great.\n\nThe dining room is enormous and feels like something out of American Psycho, which I enjoyed very much. Ask for a booth in the center of the dining room so you get to be surrounded and can look around. The booths are huge and can fit up to 6, but we sat there with 4 which allowed for plenty of elbow room.\n\nThe confit pig trotters were most notable. Any time a chef cooks an animal's feet in it's own fat I recommend you eat it. Chestnuts came with the scallops which was a table favorite as well. The rest of the food was lovely, but some dishes just lacked that spark to blow me away though still being plenty delicious.

From walk-in to dessert, this was a wonderful meal, and a formidable new entry on the SF dining scene. Despite a very busy and bustling bar scene, the restaurant maintains a nice understated nature about it, owing to its pleasant minimalist design. \n\nService was attentive, helpful and friendly without being the least bit overbearing. I like how drinks like water and iced tea are served in carafes on the table.\n\nThe food was stellar. The scallop appetizer I ordered was one of the best I've ever had: perfectly cooked with a delicious, multilayered flavors. The heirloom tomato and burrata salad, while certainly not new, was also executed very very well. My halibut was also outstanding... the hollandaise not the least bit heavy and the fried green tomatoes crispy and not the least bit greasy. Desserts were also well done; the berry cornmeal dessert was refreshing but not too heavy, and the root beer and chocolate dish, while somewhat ambitious, was also pretty delish.\n\nI can't wait to see what other delights Prospect will serve up as the seasons change and new options arrive on the menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-20", "description": "I recently dined at Prospect with four friends (two of them being professional chefs). Started off the evening with a couple cocktails on their menu...all well made and delicious. So delicious that you could hardly taste the alcohol. Now that's dangerous!\n\nSo we tackled the menu in the \"everything but\" approach which is an awesome way to dine. We basically ordered all the starters but a couple of them (believe the calamari wasn't on our order).  I love starters more than entrees since I always feel that the chefs can have more creativity with their starters. \n\nGreen Goddess Salad - A refreshing salad that I could eat every day. Chef Ravi Kapur did a superb job on this dish. Three different types of cucumber (English, Japanese and Lemon) with chunks of avocado. The green goddess dressing wasn't that rich so it was perfect. \n\nYellowtail Crudo - Delicious but not memorable.\n\nBuffalo Carpaccio - Loved the fried oysters that accompanied this dish. Mmm fried oysters.\n\nSoft Shell Crab - It was good but not much else to rave about. Guess you gotta make the most of it since they're in season. \n\nBlack Cod - Yum! Nicely done and almost melts in your mouth like butterfish. \n\nDayboat Scallops - Delicious but I'm a fan of scallops in general. Definitely would order again. \n\nPorcini Mushrooms - This was my absolutely favorite dish of the evening. The mushrooms were nicely cooked and paired with a crispy egg and bacon. The runny yolk with bacon and mushroom...like breakfast in my mouth. If Prospect ever does brunch, this better be on the menu. \n\nPotato Dumplings - my friends liked this dish. The dumplings had almost a mashed potato consistency. Not my favorite since I like potato dumplings not as soft.\n\nQuail - One of the top dishes. Cooked perfectly and favorful. \n\nOn top off all the starters, we decided to share one of the entrees. Their pork cheeks were calling my name. It was a nice portion and the meat was very tender. \n\nCan you believe after eating all that we actually had room for dessert?  We tried to do the \"everything but\" approach but had to stop ourselves so we just ordered four choices. \n\nPeach Pie - Delicious but I always like my stone fruits sweeter. Loved that the pie came out warm and looked like a turnover.\n\nS'mores - Pretty good but like my marshmallow more gooey and melted. \n\nChocolate Orbit Cake - Not a big fan of chocolate so meh.\n\nKulfi Ice Cream - Pretty interesting to see this on the menu. It had a very different flavor profile compared to everything we eat prior. \n\nProspect is definitely a winner and those living and working in SOMA should be happy. They provided great service. The ambience was great and not pretentious especially when they raised the shades later in the evening.  I'd be back to see how the menu changes throughout the year.", "author": "Michael N."}

When we arrived, they took care of us right away and complimented our dedication for making it in. Perfect way to make a customer feel appreciated.\n- Ambiance: large open space with booths down the middle and tables to the side and back. Liked that it was full of energy but not too loud or crowded even with a full dining room. Art was modern large colorful yet unobtrusive paintings hanging sparingly on the walls\n- Foie gras torchon: extremely generous thick disc of buttery foie topped with cocoa nibs. When introduced to the warm buttery thick toast strips, it elegantly melted a bit. Mmmmmmm... Instead if a typical fruit compote topping, enjoyed the gelee cube.\n- Chicken: was hesitant to order it in fear it would be boring, but did not regret my decision. Perfectly cooked tender round slices of chicken filled with housemade sausage using chicken thighs and spices. Few large slices of sweet potatoes and mini halves of brussel sprouts were a treat as well. \n- Presentation: plates were all beautifully composed with an artistic flair and use of empty space\n- Steak: heavily marbled so texture was between a new york steak and prime rib with good natural flavor\n- Teapot: numi teas were served in a unique squished red porcupine-looking pot\n\nMidlights:\n- Service: waitress didn't detract from the experience, but didn't add to it either. Several big gaps in service starting with when we first got seated and again when we were waiting to have our order taken to the hub's espresso delivery several minutes after my mine\n\nLowlights:\n- Burrata chicory salad: being a burrata fan (and having an excellent version last week), this was a bit disappointing being too watery/loose \n\nEnjoyed our dining experience here and would come back.", "author": "Eve K."}

The desserts were all so good, I would love to come back sometime and do a dessert tasting.  Is that possible?  Please?  \n\nThe one thing I would ding them on was the service.  We asked the sommelier to come back, and she dropped off the wine list, and then disappeared.  I mean, we're literate, so asking her to come back meant we wanted to talk to her.

Don't present yourself as a '10' when you are clearly a '6'. When your server can't count their money correctly, comes back TWO times and in an insulting matter, challenges or questions the amount paid (like 'are you sure you want to leave $ on X?'), you know this place is a not exactly the high quality place one would expect to eat at.  When I say awkward, I mean like coming back to guests and reconfirming the amount of the bill with what was left, yeah, that was awkward and unprofessional. Aside from that, apparantly, they are in a hurry to close down about an hour early. One of our guests was in the middle of eating, literally fork in hand, and yet the server and staff had the audacity to come by 4 times, yes, 4 times, and literally try to take his plate and food away and in the process, they robically ask if he is done eating. Let's not even bring up the fact that another of our guests ordered a glass of wine only to have half of it taken away and disposed as they tried to clear us out. Keep in mind there was a 10-top party still enjoying their meal and time across the way but a party of 8, us, we were too much and not considered as important.  What restaurant does that? $25+ plates and yet you can get more respectable service at your 'neighborhood grill' (Applebee's).....not that I'd ingest their food but at least the experience would be more enjoyable. Another iritating moment when paying higher costs for a food experience is when restaurants auction away food. If u take the order, know where people are sat so food is delivered correctly. No one wants to pay $40+ for a steak only to have someone shout and ask who the dinner belongs to...like a cattle call. It is all about the experience. I wouldn't bitch so much if i had gone to a commercial spot because i know what to expect. Long story short, not a fan. Never will go again and frankly, that $32 pork chop was bland and should be adjusted to $12.95 where it should be. I'd rather pay for a shitty steak at Outback Steakhouse and at least eat something that has a little flavor and get better service than to fork out what I did.

Haven't tried the full dining experience yet which sounds like from the other reviews may be better than the experience I had. The bar menu was not bad, food not memorable as neither bad or good. The one memorable part of the evening however was the fact that the bar did not carry any sweet vermouth other than Dolin's.  No Carpano Antica or Punte Mes, my vermouth of choice for a Manhattan.  It boggles the mind that an upscale bar/restaurant would not carry any vermouth other than Dolin's.  Perhaps they ran out? The bartender certainly did not explain that to us. I settled for the Manhattan with Dolin and I  have to say it was  one of the worst Manhattan's I've ever had. Also as a side note-- the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant made me feel like I was at a Marriott Airport Hotel.  Won't be going back anytime soon.", "author": "Fay D."}

Initially we'd been meaning to go for the cocktails, but it turned out the food was spectacular as well.\n\nThe look of the place shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with Boulevard, as Prospect is brought to you by the same good folks.  The space is large, classy but not over, and sports a communal table that seats maybe 15 or so in addition to the many booths & tables.\n\nService was fantastic all evening.  We walked in around nine on Saturday night & were seated immediately at the communal table, which we really enjoyed because it led to many recommendations from other patrons & even a few opportunities to taste other dishes & drinks.  Not a cheap night by any stretch, but didn't break the bank either.\n\nCocktails - At $11-$12 a pop, not cheap, but exceptionally well-made.\n\n40 Winks - Scotch, cocchi americano, pear-chamomile shrub, lemon peel.  A delicious, semi-smokey drink (as long as you like Scotch).  The pear could've been a little less subtle, but still very tasty.\n\nStallion - gin, orange curacao, barolo chinato, bitters.  Really nice for a gin drink, which I don't usually go for.\n\nThe Whaler  - jamaican rum, sparkling wine, honey, mint, lime, egg white.  Probably the best of the night.  A very interesting, well-balanced, and yummy grog-like drink.\n\nVieux Navire - calvados, Buffalo Trace bourbon, sweet vermouth, whiskey barrel & maple bitters.  This was the only one I was rather unimpressed by.  Okay, but a bit bland; I'd expected it to be more flavorful.\n\nFood -\n\nFor an appetizer, we had the Arctic Char Crudo with seaweed rice cracker, pickled cucumber, & white miso.  Arctic char is a fabulous alternative to salmon, and theirs was done incredibly well.  We could have eaten an enter second plate.\n\nFor entrees, we had a chicken dish with sweet potatoes & Brussels sprouts, and a goat dish with three different cuts of goat.  All the meat was super tender & juicy, flavorful, & perfectly cooked.  I don't generally like Brussels sprouts but these were delicious.  (It looks like their menu has changed since we were there, though - I don't see the goat option anymore.)\n\nFor dessert, we split the Molten Chocolate Truffle Cake, which came with chocolate sorbet, dark chocolate sauce, white chocolate cr\u00e8me, & pomegranate seeds.  Extremely chocolatey!!  I'm not a huge chocolate eater, so I only had a few bites, but my bf (who is a huge chocolate fan) could not stop raving about it.\n\nHighly recommended - will definitely go back.  :)", "author": "Angela B."}

This place is beautiful inside; between the dark woods and low lighting it's modern and classy yet warm and totally sets the right mood for an intimate dinner.  At the same time, there were plenty of large groups coming in and the atmosphere was lively.  \n\nDishes are set out family style in the middle of the table instead of in front of each person, and serving utensils are set out with them, all of which lends itself to either more romantic nibbling and sampling or to an everybody help themselves type meal.  The food was tasty, simple and fresh and there weren't too many choices on the menu, which to me is a good thing.  One, you know that you're going to get some of the highest quality in-season ingredients and two, it's easier to order.  We started with the ahi tuna tartare, cornmeal crusted soft shell crab, and heirloom tomato and burrata salad.  All were unique and delicious.  Out of the three, we liked the tomato salad the best because of how simple but balanced it was.  Entrees were the sea bass, prawn, and scallops over risotto and the duck.  There were some strong flavors here!  I really liked the seafood but the pickled fennel on the risotto was a bit overwhelming for me.  The duck was rich and delicious but again, some overpowering flavors in the sides were a little too much.  We did, however, clean our plates so overall, it was a delectable meal.  We ended with the double chocolate beignets...SO good we licked the plate clean and contemplated ordering another serving!  \n\nThe food is pricey but for an occasion or an evening with friends that's sure to impress, Prospect is a good choice.  Yes, there was an arctic wind blowing on our table and our waitress was about as cold as the temperature but for the atmosphere and the food, I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Christine E."}

I would have never imagined that a salad with cucumbers and avocado could taste so unique and delicious!  For entrees, we got the scallop risotto and halibut, both were cooked to perfection.

Prospect has a whole menu of them! My favs are the Roxana and The Whaler. They pack a punch, both in potency and flavor.\n\nThe space itself is warm and inviting, and the service is superb.

He must have paid attention to the particular way I order my Manhattan because before a cocktail server even came to us a woman brought over my girls favorite drink, and mine exactly the way I wanted it. This was over the top because we never spoke about early cocktails nor did I pay him for them. Very impressive.\n\nMy date was too happy to get her drink to realize the peculiarity of its arrival. After we were seated Aaron introduced himself then gave us time to finish our drinks and our conversation. Once we were done, he gave us the days amuse which was a tasty caviar bite to get us ready. Back to the \"letting us finish our conversation\". Even though the server and I had a report, he didn't bother us. I hate it when I go on a date and the damn server tries to tell us his/her life story. I'm here to eat, not make a new friend. Anyways, I digress. Back to the meal.  Once her drink was done, he brought out a buttery oak for her and a dry citrus for me, followed promptly by our appetizers served to the center of the table with share plates. A) They do not do \"tappa's style\", this was just a nice thing so we could share, and B) the Cod was a 10. I can't remember the other but it was a great compliment.\n\nThe two entrees were coursed out to the center of the table, each paired with their own glass of wine. They were the scallops, followed by the lamb... On a side note, I have a problem just like Mel Gibson in The Conspiracy Theory. He HAS to buy a copy of Catcher in the Rye any time he walks by a book store. Well, I HAVE to get scallops ever time I see them on a menu. So I am somewhat of an expert. I can say, other than Jumping Jay's in Portsmouth, NH, these are the best scallops I have ever had. The lamb was phenomenal as well, but lets face it, lamb is always delicious. The food was so good that I was getting jealous of it, on multiple occasions my date (unbenounced to her) was portraying Meg Ryan in Harry Met Sally. Ok, well, not to that extent, but still,.. it made me jealous.\n\nI'm sure dessert would have been great, but we skipped it. We were a fat, happy, and tipsy at that point and when she suggested that we get the bill and go home, I gladly said, the bill is paid, lets go.\n\n\n(skipping dessert and dessert drinks should have paid for our early cocktails, I wouldn't want that to come out of his pocket) What made me happiest was that she enjoyed everything so much, especially because people can be picky. I think that is a testament to how great the food was. Even though people might be afraid of scallops, or just trying new things in general, you can feel confident going out on a limb here and trying something you normally wouldn't pick for yourself because IT WILL TASTE GOOD. This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. On all fronts, they had it together.", "author": "Staycationer w."}

So when I heard about Prospect opening in the Infinity building, my family and I made a reservation.  With veteran chefs, this 4 week old restaurant is already a hit.\n\nAppetizers:\n\n- Green Goddess salad - refreshing and a great balance between the acidity and the creamy avocado.\n- Calamari - the crunch of the chickpeas added great texture\n- Soft shell crab - good, but not memorable\n- Potato Dumplings - soft, creamy and rich with mushrooms.\n\nMain:\n\n- Petrale Sole - the pancetta and beans created flavor reminiscent of navy bean soup, balanced by the lightness of the fish. Biggest surprise.\n- Chicken 2 Ways - light, seasoned well, and great sausage\n- Lamb 2 Ways - rich, peppery, and cooked to perfection.  Best dish.\n- Halibut - firm, well done.\n\nDessert:\n\n- ice cream sandwiches - just okay.\n- s'mores - points for creativity!  Great marshmallow, salty finish.\n- warm vanilla cake - espresso sugar was a standout hit.\n\nCocktails were well executed, and the wine service was spot on.

They were good but nothing I'll remember (since they are fading from my memory now, a day later).\n\nThen we had the foie gras torchon appetizer, which was the best part of the meal.  Foie gras is already decadent enough, but they give you buttered toast to slather it on and that puts it over the top.\n\nI had the uni risotto appetizer as my meal, and my friend had the scallops.  He didn't really comment on them so I'll just focus on the risotto, which, again, was \"good\" but not memorable - except that it was tiny.  I didn't mind since I had gorged on foie gras already and am trying not to overeat so the miniscule portion was fine.  If you have a healthier appetite, do not make it your entree.\n\nWe finished off with the s'mores dessert, which, again, was good but nothing special. \n\nI can't bring myself to give it 3 stars because I believe we in SF are so picky and this place is not \"mediocre\" at any stretch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-25", "description": "OVERALL: Solid 4 stars.  Although some dishes were better than others, each dish seemed well thought out, from flavor pairings to platings.  It was delectable, esp the peach pie dessert! Classy and sleek space, crowd, and decor. In short, it made an impression. Lovely dining experience.\n\nAMBIANCE:  The space is classy, open, airy, and fairly spacious.  The bar area has a communal table.  High ceilings.  Tuesday at 8:30pm, just a couple wks after they opened, and it was packed.  Noise level was a bit louder than what I'd prefer--found myself having to speak louder than my normal voice.  But the tables were all reasonably spaced apart.  Variety of people, from groups of 60 year olds enjoying dinner out to girls night out, to FiDi suits.  We were one of the last tables to leave, around 10:45.  \n\nFOOD!!\nFirst things first.  Portion size. Yes, it's true they are on the small size.  But honestly, for two people, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert (+ bread)--seemed the perfect amount without going up a pants size.\n\n-Appetizers:\nBuffalo carpacio topped with fried oysters:  Delicate dish.  The fried oysters paired well with the buffalo carpaccio, which simply melted in the mouth.\n-Scallops:  Delicious.  I love all scallops, so I may be biased. But these were fresh, tender scallops. Rich and buttery, cooked perfectly.\n\nEntrees:\n-Lamb Loin & Ribs.  I'm a seafood gal, but got the lamb based on the server's reco (thanks Matthew!) b/c the fish dishes didn't seem all that interesting.  And what a reco!    A combo of lamb loin & ribs.  The ribs were tender, fall off the bone, sweet/spicy, bursting with flavor.  I could eat those ribs all day. I want to sneak to the kitchen and steal the sauce they use for the ribs!\n\n-Wagyu Beef. I'm not a beef expert, but this was tasty.  Dining companion (beef expert) agreed the flavor was good, but thought it could have been more tender.  This fell short of his expectations, esp. given the Blvd association.\n\nDessert!!\n-Peach tart (pie?).  Sweet peaches, I love you peach cobbler!  The peach cobbler/pie was a rectangular pillow-- reminiscent of a big Gino's microwave pizza roll or a mini mcdonald's apple pie.  The combination of flavors was fabulous.  The pie was light, not too flaky, warm and had sweet peach filling inside.  On top, the pie was sprinkled with a bit of salt.  Plated with diced, sweet peaches, sprinkled with brown butter crumble.  Served with a scoop of muscovado ice cream. Lick-the-plate-worthy.\n\n-Next time I will get the warm vanilla cake (interesting since we usually see warm chocolate cake)...\n\nSERVICE:\nOur Server MATTHEW was awesome.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, just the right level of attentiveness and not overbearing. He recommended the lamb that I got and I loved it.  He also recommended the dessert. Although we were one of the last tables to leave, we didn't at all feel rushed.", "author": "Caroline I."}

It was a very nice dining experience. Four of us had dinner, three started with the green goddess salad. Very tasty. The fourth had the black cod appetizer. It looked delicious and she said it was terrific.  \n\nFor the main courses two had the rib eye. Both were cooked perfectly and the potato served with it was amazing. (I had a bite and I'm not one of those who dies for potatoes.)  Another got the duck. She is a big fan of duck and said their version was really outstanding. Fatty, but that's par for the course with duck, I believe. \n\nAs a non-meat eater myself, the main course choices for fish-iitarians are a little limited: scallops (which I detest) or sole. So I ordered the sole. It too was very nice. Served on a bed of small pasta in a light green sauce with some mushrooms and greens on the side.  The one thing that totally disgusted me, though, was that it was served with a little foam.\n\nCan we just move past the whole foam craze people? I can't possible be the only person who thinks foam on my food looks like spit. I'm sorry, but it does. And spittle does not belong on food. Ewe. \n\nThankfully there wasn't a lot so I was able to move it aside and cover it so I didn't have to look at it again.\n\nWe all shared the peanut butter chocolate cake dessert thing. For those who have reviewed this dish as boring -- I'm not sure where you normally get your desserts -- but this was one fantastic dish! There were many flavors in it (ice cream, chocolate molten cake, peanut brittle, chocolate sauce) but they all complimented each other. If we could have licked the plate we would have -- it was that good.\n\nI would likely go back to Prospect. My only beef with the place is that it's just a bit too pricey. $14 for a salad that's basically 1.5 cups of greens with a few pieces of avocado and cucumber? That's over the top.  The main courses were all close to $30 or over, which just seem a bit too high, unless you're there for a business dinner where corporate is picking up the tab and price is not a concern.  \n\nI get it. They use Heath dishware. They want to be considered a fancy place. And the decor is very modern and pretty. But overall it's just not all that unique or the food so special to warrant such high prices, which is why I gave it 3 stars vs 4.", "author": "stacy o."}

Initially, I thought I was getting that snooty NY restaurant scene impression when I walked up to the front desk, but I think they were just busy... because that's what they are... busy.

Don't get me wrong, she wasn't mean or anything, she just didn't seem to have it together.  She wouldn't check in on us... took a while to get our order right... And I guess there was a kitchen mixup and it caused a long delay in our order.  We didn't complain at all, but we were certainly noticing the wait.\n\nThe manager salvaged this from being another one star experience for me by proactively coming over and apologizing.  They also comped us a dessert for our trouble.  I think the waitress needs some serious training though, so I hope they've worked on that.\n\nNow, I love Boulevard.  I think it is a first class experience and I give it 5 stars on Yelp.  So having heard that this was the sister restaurant, I always use that as the benchmark for service.

Well, Prospect blew us away (this is saying alot since my man is an acclaimed chef that has worked at the top and hottest restaurants in the country). Right off the bat the service was impeccable. Both our server and the Somm spoke to us having light-hearted conversation but really making us feel as though we were the only customers in the building. The food came out in good time, the drinks were delicious as was our wine. Our favorite dish was the pork belly stuffed calamari. To die for! The stone fruit salad is also a perfect combination of sweet and salty and has great summer flavors. The goat cheese just makes it pop. The tar tar is also pretty decadent. We decided to split a pork chop which was a little under, the server noticed without us saying anything. We received a compliment from the chef before getting the chop back cooked to perfection. They were also kind enough to give us dessert wine and another delish strawberry/shortcake/sorbet dessert with yummy honey crunchies. I guess to sum it up, we experienced a fine dining experience turned casual without sitting and eating for 4 hours, paying a horrendously huge bill, and over the top service that just ends up being annoying and uncomfortable. \nIt was PERFECT!\nNot only will we be back, this is now our favorite date night spot and will also be where we will bring our friends/family in the future.\n\nGood job Prospect, hats off to you.", "author": "Tamira J."}

I found the combination to be unusual but yummy.  Definitely would have another if I went back.\n\nFor the starters we had the Chilled Beets - vadouvan yogurt, candied pistachios, spiced onion rings--those were not bad, but definitely a portion that was a bit on the small side, and i didn't like the chilled aspect of the beets (yes, i realize it said chilled on the menu description...).\n\nWe also had a gulf shrimp appetizer which i was not a fan of. The shrimp seemed a slightly undercooked and did not taste as fresh as i would have liked.\n\nLuckily, my entree made up for the sub-par apps.  I had the Wagyu Zabuton: butterball potato, creamed cippolinis, smoked trumpet mushrooms, spinach, mustard seed jus. It was incredible.  The meat was cooked perfectly and really well seasoned.  The portion didn't appear large but it was hearty and filing.  The creamed cippolinis were awesome, as were the mushrooms.  All in all, a really great dish.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool, definitely a new SF vibe--which isn't a bad thing.  They have similar lighting to RN74 but definitely didn't feel as trendy...so that was nice.\n\nFor dessert we had the Black and Tan--butter-bourbon pudding, bittersweet brownie, billionaires' shortbread, chocolate sorbet...Yep.  Would totally have that again.  it was SO good.  The shortbread was ridiculous.\n\nWould I come back?  Totally, but I would be much more inclined if someone else was footing the bill because although not the priciest joint, it ain't cheap!", "author": "Lu E."}

Now Nancy Oaks has opened a second restaurant nearby that in my opinion is better than Boulevard. Why? First an open, airy and pleasing dining area; second, a bar and cocktail area that can be used for their fundamental purpose (i.e., no one dining at the bar); third, a competent and friendly staff; fourth, fairly low noise level when full of diners; and finally, great food, well-prepared and nicely presented. For all of this I'd say the prices, which are a little high, are reasonable. I'm ready to go back.", "author": "Jym C."}

In sports, you normally think a prospect is one who has potential to become a star yet it will be determined through time.  This is how I feel about the restaurant; it has potential but it hasn't reached it.\n\nFirst off, decor.  There are floor to ceiling glass on one side where you can look into Folsom street which I think is pretty cool.  It has a very cozy feel to it with the booths, dim lighting, and what I believe is an apartment feel.  Perhaps this is because it is next to the Infinity buildings and even the walkway to the bathroom feels like one of the apartments.  I definitely like how the restaurant feels so pluses on this.\n\nFood.  I ordered the potato and escargot.  While pretty in presentation I felt this dish lacked any taste.  It was extremely bland.  There was a sea of green sauce which I dipped the potato and escargot in but nothing.  For entree, I ordered the pork belly and cheek.  Very meaty dish and the pork belly was a nice slab of meat with a good amount of fat.  It was pretty good.  My friend ordered figs for appetizers which he said were delicious and the scallops for entree and he raved about them as well.  For dessert I ordered the ice cream sandwiches.  I looked on yelp and saw some pictures of it but apparently what I saw wasn't the sandwiches.  I was somewhat disappointed in them since they felt like glorified oreos with ice cream in them.  The pieces were small but they do give you four.\n\nWe ordered wine and me not being a wine drinker, my friend mentioned how the wine glasses were poured on the not so generous side.  We later went to the W and ordered wine and the glass was definitely fuller than the one at Prospect.\n\nService.  Very impersonal and felt rushed.  The waiter didn't explain the menu to us.  The maitre d' or manager seated us and asked if this was our first time.  We said yes.  Then the waiter came, took our drink orders and disappeared for a while and then came back to take our orders.  He did come back to check in on us a couple of times.  He tried to be more personal at the end of dinner, not sure if this was because we were checking the Giants score.  Anyway I've had dinner at Boulevards and I think many would agree that their service isn't great.  The staff may be trained by the same group of people.  The bread guy only gave me one piece of bread and never returned to ask if I wanted another piece.  I only got a second piece because I was able to flag him down.\n\nTo sum it up, Prospect has potential.  It is a place with a nice comfortable ambiance, decent food (portions could be bigger), and so so service.", "author": "Pierre L."}

I believe it does have the quality of Boulevard but in a much improved, albeit hotel-like setting.  The dishes are beautifully prepared and everything tastes light and fresh.  The soft shell crab is excellent along with the yellowtail crudo.  The yellowtail was thinly sliced and came with a seaweed cracker that was unique (almost tasted like Trader Joe's veggie chips?!).\n\nMain dishes I tried were the Wagyu Zabuton (Wagyu for novices like me is beef, related to Kobe?) and the Northern Halibut.  Both prepared very well and rounded nicely with potatoes/carrots.\n\nDesserts were decent, but nothing that made the women at the table jump up and scream.  Excellent place and really close to lots of other spots I find myself these days.\n\nThe one downside is the service is spotty.  Our waitress must have had ants in her pants.  She would take half our drink orders and then leave. . . and then finally return without drinks and take the other half.

I swear there are over a dozen of them and i don't know what any of them do! Worst service I've had in the city in awhile not just at an \"upscale\" rest. \n\nDecor is completely out of place. Very asian, but no \"fusion\" going on here.\n\nBeing a huge fan of Boulevard I expected to be wowed or at least delighted by my dining experience here. I was neither after the meal. 4 of us dined. Started with Foie Gras (pate), sea urchin risotto, crab & beat \"salad\" with tiny onion rings which do nothing to expand the pallet. If you like Foie Gras prepared this way it was good, but the other 2 were bland and not pallet, and quail. Quail was amazing and if you like Foie Gras prepared this way you'll like it.\nAlso had a glass of the most expensive chardonnay  ($18) which was flavorless. Had much better wines by the glass at Hotel Biron.\n\nOrdered a bottle of Petite Sirah (only 1 on the menu, $60). It was good if you like Petite Sirah. Entrees came. Pork cheek (think short-ribs), chicken roulade and a basic salad. Pork cheeks were good, but taste like something i can get at Park Chow. Chicken Roulade was decent, but sides were over seasoned (less is more people!) Salad was $13 and very basic although dressed well.\n\nHad Coffee: 1 espresso, 1 capp., 1 latte & 1 decaf regular. all espresso drinks came quickly, but decaf took awhile. No complaints here.\n\nDesserts: Vanilla bean cheesecake was bland and too cold and the citrus did not mix well.\nAlso had the black & tan which was terrible. Nothing interesting about anything on the plate. \n\nOverall a terrible experience.

So yes it s a \"nice\" place and don't plan on getting out inexpensively. \n\nSo if you're up for $100 a head or more this place is every bit as good as Boulevard or other similar paces for food and service. It lacks the ambiance though - especially if you're sitting near the Folsom Street side window. They pull the shade down to protect your corneas from the afternoon sun, but the view - including the occasionally puppy on a bathroom break is weak, people are very close walking by and looking in through the shaded windows and lets face it The New Temp Trans Bay Terminal isn't much to look at. \n\nFood was excellent - Halibut, greens, nicely done potato was properly small portioned and excellent. A member of the party had Salmon and said it was very good - he previously had the halibut and liked it better but that's a matter of choice. The presentation was very good, the table service was good - friendly, helpful and not hovering. The place was full by 7:30 PM so it was busy and a bit noisy but had the right buzz without having to struggle to hear. \n\nDesert was OK, the weakest part of the meal. nothing special ice cream sandwich and a odd mix cornbread short cake which only I liked - because I love cornbread. \n\nSo 4/5 stars from me, its an excellent place but for me a little too pretentious on the menu, and a little to expensive for what you get (quality is good but its not uniquely great and there are so many other places that are as good nearby) and the ambiance is not a 5 star rating. \n\nSpecial occasion or client dinner for sure.

Doesn't help that its in the Financial District and on a weekend night it's a ghost town.  I bet its a good happy hour bar.", "author": "Andrea R."}

The cocktails were once again top-notch (in particular the Catcher in the Rye).   Last time I started with the crispy pig trotters, and while I was happy to see them on the menu again, I figured I should branch out from the pork for a change and go with the seared calamari and octopus.  While this was some seriously tasty squid, I couldn't help but long for some more of the crispy porky deliciousness.  The others in our group had the golden beet salad (with some creamy, airy burratta that melted in your mouth) and the soft-shelled crab, which I hear was great.  For my main, I went with the Goat, which was a selection of 4 different cuts: chop, leg, shoulder and belly.  The goat was tender and juicy, but was actually quite mild in flavor (for some reason I was expecting a gamier beast, but that's not at all what I got), so it benefited significantly from the pea/fragola/carrot/mint  butter/goat jus sauce that accompanied it.  We shared the craime fraiche panna cotta with vanilla poached rhubarb and rhubarb sorbet for dessert, which, like everything else at Prospect, had complex and restrained (not over-the-top) flavors, with beautiful presentation.  It was a terrific way to end the meal, as it wasn't too heavy.\n\nThe service - while friendly - was a bit uneven.  We tried to get in an order for another round of drinks before our main courses came, but our waitress took off in the other direction before we could get a word out.  Fortunately, the sommelier (who was already bringing drinks to 2 out of the 4 people in our party) was able to help us.  In fairness to our waitress, she came back a few minutes later and apologized for the confusion (we guessed that she'd gotten a talking-to by the sommelier, or one of the managers).  A small hiccup in what was otherwise good service, but when you're paying $100 per person for a dinner, you expect better.  Anyway, we still had a great experience and will go back at some point in the future.", "author": "Andrew E."}

The lamb three ways was fantastic, though i thought the accompanying white beans were not a great match--their thick taste undermined the subtle differences among the lamb choices. Seasonings also were bland.    The service, while friendly and professional, could not mask the too-long delays between courses.  And it was not overflowingly busy so seems like an operational problem. \n\nThe space is nice and modern hip, to the extent that hip can feel like a hotel restaurant. (e.g.St. REgis restaurant Ame with brighter lighting).  It is a bit generic and could be in anywhere USA, EU, or anywhere.  There is nothing that screams (or even whispers) SF.     \n\nThe only serious beef is with the greeters at front desk.  I was early for a reservation and the place was far from full.  When my dining partner was going on 12 minutes late for our 7:30 res (and after I mentioned to hostess  that she emailed that she was running a few mins late), a hostess came to me and asked whether my party was still coming, which given her tone I took to mean that if she did not arrive soon my table would be forfeited.\n\nProspect has potential, but the last thing they can afford now while they find their sea legs is attitude!!!

The hostess sat us on time, even though our entire party hadn't arrives -- there was none of this making you wait until everyone got there. The atmosphere in Prospect is very conducive to a relaxing dinner. It's nice, not too formal and not too loud.\n\nWe started with a round of cocktails -- they have a nice menu of specialty drinks. I enjoyed the Stallion, a concoction of beefeater gin, orange curacao, barolo chinato, bitters. It was really good. I'd be happy to make a more in-depth exploration of the rest of their offerings at a future date.\n\nThe food was very nice. We split the Black Mission Figs & Burrata starter, which was crunchy and sweet and creamy and savory -- nice contrasting flavors and textures.\n\nIn fact, everything we had was good -- wonderful combinations of flavors and textures. For starters, I had the Matsutake Mushrooms & Gulf Shrimp, Brett went with the Potato Dumplings & Escargot and Aimee enjoyed the Seared Calamari & Octopus. We shared tastes of everything, of course. The dumplings were light and wonderful and I really liked the seared calamari. \n\nFor entrees, it was Brett tackling the Pork Belly & Cheek, Aimee going with the Alaskan Coho Salmon, and the Wagyu Zabuton for me. I was expecting the wagyu to perhaps be a bit more tender but it was very, very tasty.\n\nProspect really shined with the desserts. Their menu there is inventive and everything was awesome.\n\nService was excellent, the wine list had a nice selection of reasonably-priced and the whole experience was top-notch.

My wife and I had the goddess salad and potato dumplings for appetizers,  and the chicken roulade and lamb loin/ribs for entrees. All dishes were exceedingly flavorful, but the entrees stood out.  The desserts were also excellent, and came with a free bowl of the caramel corn. \n\nPerhaps they do this for everyone, or perhaps it was in recognition of us being seated at 8:55 for our 8:30 reservation, I don't know.  They did not acknowledge seating us 25 minutes late at any other point of the night. Not even a simple apology.\n\nLastly, our server was a flaccid, emotionless fleck of dust that didn't seem to care about anything. Combined with the wait to be seated, I give the service 2 stars.

I must give five stars to the hostess that evening. Reason, I had reservations at 6:15, but the movie ran longer and we didn't get there until 8. So I told the hostess what happen and she was able to hook me and my friend up with a table, we were so happy! Not only we got a table, I got a table with the view the street. It was a very cool effect to enjoy my courses and watch the sun go down and cars just driving buy really cool!. On to the food!!!!!! There are so many great things to say, I don't know what to say. To start the adventure off my friend and I started with drinks I got the Prospector! What a grown up drink, Its a very heavy spirits drink with a great bitter orange after taste! I really loved it. For our first course we the the Foie gras and toast!!! I don't know how to describe this, saying it was rich, creamy, buttery with a hint of liver flavor doesn't do it justice. It is beyond that! Accompanied the Foie gras was pineapple gelee and bits of jalapenos. Once you pair all three flavors together my palate went into orbit! For our next courses I had the Rib eye and my friend ordered the Day Scallops with a bed of farro.  I ordered the Rib eye rare and boy it was perfect. I have been spoiled by Mastros with their dry aged rib eye steaks, but the rib eye here was amazing! (for not being dry aged) Fantastic crust, juicy tender full of beef flavor rib eye. When you get quality meats the flavor shows and as I was eating the rib eye it was screaming \"I am a top notch cut\".  The Day scallop dish was great too looking at it,  the sear on the scallops was perfect. I tasted a sample from my friends dish and it was cooked to perfection. It came on a bed of farro and it was my first time eating farro. I like it! In my opinion its better then Couscous. I like the texture of farro . After our excellent entrees we got  the ice cream sandwich for dessert. This was the perfect way to end an evening of well balanced flavored dishes. The ice cream was a raspberry, but the star here was the cookie outside. It tasted so fresh and so yummy! As I am biting into the cookie I can taste that there was lots of heart n love into it.  This is a long review and I don't care, I must give Prospect their credit!!!!  I can not wait to come back and have another out of this world experience again!!!!", "author": "Charlie C."}

Light, refreshing, and a good number of beets on the dish. The manchego cheese went nicely with the beets and the sweetness of the walnut brittle. \n\nBuffalo carpaccio: this dish is GOOD - get it. The oysters on top are fried and go so well with the carpaccio. You get two pieces, but they are pretty good sized. Definitley enough for two people to share because the dish is pretty rich. \n\nPotato dumplings: we got this dish because so many people on yelp recommended it. They were yummy. We actually ate these with our entree and they were a nice compliment to the meat we ordered. \n\nWagyu zabuton: we got the meat medium rare and it was delicious. The little potatoes that came with the dish were good, but our potato dumplings were better.\n\nPeach hand pie:  this dish was a yummy end to our meal. The crispy outside of the dessert was awesome, and the peaches were so sweet. The only bad thing: we chatted so much that our ice cream melted before we got a chance to eat it in it's solid form. \n\nThe staff was so nice and patient...

Not bad, perfectly decent, but for $30 a dish you should expect excellent, and this wasn't. \n\nWe decided not to stay for dessert and ordered coffee instead . . . good coffee, except for the fact that they filled our mugs about half-way and then (as seemed to be the MO of the servers here) walked away. \n\nI should note that several other tables had similar things happen . . . the moment we sat down our waiter asked the table next to us whether she had ever brought their after-dinner drinks -- she hadn't.

For a fine dining establishment, you'd expect them to reach over and place your silverware or plates down for you instead of having the customers get them from the servers as they hand them to you.  If I could give negative points for this it's for the principle and customer experience element. Knowing it was a birthday group, they (maybe purposely) failed to mention the cake cutting fee. I totally get it -- cost to serve, clean the dishes, opportunity cost of not selling your own desserts...and I've willingly paid this many times in the past...but they charged us $100!!! More than what we would pay for ordering desserts there. On top of the cost of the cake itself which they did not provide. I can understand a $25 change, even $50 or $60, but $100 is downright ridiculous and equal to the cost of food/drinks for one person. My friends are generous and kind.

Be sure to make a reservation because the bar and restaurant get crowded!!\n\nFirst of the Season Asparagus (pork belly tasso, crunchy farm egg, \"bulls eye\" fonduta) - The asparagus was perfectly cooked with no tough bits at the ends. The pork belly was incredibly crispy and did not overpower the entire dish like bacon can often do. The runny egg was the component that put this dish over the top. It makes any dish better :) \n \nSeared Calamari & Octopus (house made chorizo, manilla clams, aillade, confit garlic potatoes) - The potatoes were crispy and not too oily with too much garlic flavor. The clams had absorbed a lot of flavor from the chorizo. The calamari was very tender. \n \nSea Urchin Risotto (nantucket bay scallops, meyer lemon) - If you looked carefully, you could see the beautiful orange sea urchin scattered on top of the risotto. I hate when risotto is al dente, so the texture of this one was enjoyable. \n\nPacific Petrale Sole (nettles,king oyster mushroom, oyster nage, salsify, fregola) - The sole was seasoned well and not overcooked. The oyster mushroom melted in my mouth and the salsify was tender. The nettles added a nice textural element to the sole. \n\nKamelia - tasted very similar to a margarita with interesting flavors. \n\nThe Whaler - Loved this drink! The foamy egg whites is such a fun touch! Only downside was all the sediment that settled at the bottom of the drink. \n\nMeyer Lemon & Caramel Tart (blood orange sorbet, caramel, citrus confit, crisp meringue) - The tart shell held up to the lemon well. The filling was tart and not too sweet. \n\nCaramel popcorn: Yummy!!!", "author": "Esther F."}

Coast and this seemed to be a perfect place for 10 people.  Great food and great ambience.  It was my first time there but I have many friends in SF who rant and rave about this place.  As soon as we walked in they escorted us to our table and were ready to take our drink orders.  It was a long Monday in the office so we (all 10 of us) were super excited.  I ordered an extra dirty Belevedere martini and it was sooooo delicious!  We went on to order our apps and dinner and I got the Heirloom chicory salad with the most amazing burrata cheese ever.  I thouroghly enjoyed every bite of my salad and definitely recommend it if you like burrata!!!  For my main course I ordered the dayboat scaloops which were huge.  I always get nervous when I order scallops because they normally only come with 3 and they are ususally tiny (I have a HUGE appetite)  These were perfect in size and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe wait staff was great and very attentive to our needs.  Always making sure our water and wine glasses were full and very non-chalaunt about it.  Since it was a team event each of us had to speak and noone bothered us.  They went about their business and removed our plates or whatever they had to do.\n\nFor dessert I ordered a dessert wine and also the cheese plate.  I really don't like sweet wines so the waiter recommended a perfect pairing for my cheese although I forget which one it was.  (too many martinis and wine for dinner)  I had a great first experience and will definitely go here again when I'm in town and also recommend it to others!", "author": "Sonia D."}

And it got so bad that when we left one of my friends spoke to the host about her.  \n\nWe were seated next to the window on a cold night.  When we first sat down it was as artic as the char they were serving.  We asked the server if they could turn up the heat or something.  She said \"I'll let them know of your discomfort.\"  Oh dear, bad phrasing too.  \n\nBut the room then warmed up, cooled down, warmed up ... etc throughout the night.  Someone else mentioned the troughs in the bathroom and I think that is a good analogy for the entire decor.  Not comfortable, certainly not warm and extremely loud.    \n\nWe shared trotters, artic char and calamari/octopus for starters.  The clam with the calamari did not taste good at all.  Everything else was ~eh~ OK. I had scallops for an entree and it was quite good.  Had a bite of a friend's waygu and it was excellent.  Shared gingerbread donuts (just OK) and molten almond cake for desert (better).  \n\nI keep going back to the service.  They seemed in a big hurry to take orders.  We were still contemplating wine for the table when she wanted to get entrees ordered.  Then, if you haven't ordered in the perfect circle the runners have no idea whose dish belongs to whom.  Gosh, I've been in diners that do a better job than that. \n\nIt took a long time for food to be delivered but then we had to ask for the check.

Definitely loved the location (not the parking, or lack thereof, around it), the decor, and the modern feel of it. I felt really young compared to some of the other patrons there. \n2. The food I got, the Prospector, was awesome. It came with a chicken sausage, 3 corn cakes, 2 strips of bacon, and 2 fried eggs. Normally I dont like fried eggs, but since Im at a fancy-ass place I better freaking eat it. The bacon kind of came out unevenly fried as one piece was definitely crispier than the other, but it was still good. The corn cakes were deelishis as was the monkey bread they just randomly gave us.It was all very filling which is what I was aiming for, and especially it was only $15 which gave me a major wallet boner. \n\nCons:\n1. What's up with the wait staff? They all seem totally frazzled and confused and honestly afraid. I couldnt tell who was a manager and who was just some random customer...\n2. The food took FOREVER to come out. Granted that this weekend was a marathon or whatever, but they didnt give us a heads up or a warning. It just was us waiting for our food.  And it was a bit frustrating to see people who were seated next to us get in and out before us when they had arrived AFTER us.....\n3. Calculating the bill was apparently a major ordeal. The manager gave us the bill and it ended up being $10 more expensive than it should have and it wasnt until we really looked at it did we see the mistake. And this goes into a bigger question that if other ppl dont look at what they're paying for, they could totally just be charging people random amounts for things they didn't order. For example, we order a bottle of sparkling wine, but they were out. They offered us another bottle of wine and said they would give it us at the same price. But when the bill came out they gave to us at the original pricing which was $5 more than what as said before....hmmmmmmm \n4. This is going to sound totally trite and retarded, BUT, the whole reason why we came was because we read the article in the 7x7 magazine. In the magazine it showed the Prospector on a RECTANGLE plate which nicely framed all the items. However, when our food came out, it was on a CIRCLE plate....and we were like WTH? But we let it go. But then the people next to us got the same thing on the RECTANGLE plate which was a major WTF moment. All I can say about this is SEXISM.\n5. Also the magazine said it was a DUCK sausage, but the menu clearly states it's a CHICKEN sausage...whats up with this false advertising?!?!\n\nOverall though, I really loved the food and if I wasnt such a poor-ass I would come back and try it out again", "author": "Dustin H."}

The service, as others have said, is just atrocious which really puts a damper on the meal. We were a group of 6 on a Saturday night. Some of our friends had been there before, but it was our first time. The restaurant can clearly handle tons of groups - lots of large booths or ability for long tables.\n\nWe were seated shortly after our reservation time and greeted by our waitress, who then left us for at least 20 minutes. We did get her attention to see if she could open a bottle of wine for us as it needed to breathe. Again, gone for another 10-15 mins. When she finally comes back to take our order, my husband again asks for her to open it and after that, the sommelier comes by another 5 minutes later to finally open it. I get it, we're not paying for that bottle, but as my husband said, if they had opened that earlier, we would have easily finished that bottle probably before we finished our first course. We didn't even get to start drinking it until this point as we wanted it to breathe for at least a few minutes.\n\nThe other main problem with this place is the ratio of price to portion. I got the goat pasta to start, $14 and it was about 4 bites -- it was good, but this is just ridiculous. The serving of burrata that someone else got was actually pretty good. The portion size on the mains were actually really generous, at least on my pork chop. I really enjoyed that. But again, totally off on dessert. We figured at $6, the ice cream sandwiches must be bite-size so we got 3 orders between 6 people - nope, this time there were 4 decent size sandwiches to the order... so we left half of them. It would have been nice if that had been clarified before we ordered.\n\nWe saw our waitress only a few times - to greet us, take our order and give us the bill. And even for just 3 times, it was nearly impossible to get her attention. The courses came in good timing and overall the food was good, but the over-priced entrees and the poor service from the waitress will keep me from coming back.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Not sure I want a wide open dining room that kind of reminds me of a classed up college dining room, except super clean. Not much of a decorating theme, or I suppose my sense of culture and worldliness is low.\nValue: as with most high end sit down restaurants, tough to be even average for value. \nOverall: would have loved for the score to be higher overall and certainly expected that before I tallied the scores.

Nancy has once again made a place perfect for american blue suited salary men and tourists sans fanny packs and shorts ...like Boulevard this is casual but not really... unlike Boulevard the atmosphere is not as heavy or ornate making for a fun place for  dining and drinks.\n\ntasted across the menu- most of the notes here are correct- food is cal French based, rich portions are generous for the price and while there is nothing ground breaking or modernist here- no revelations or surprises, perhaps the point-  this is good san francisco food that is solid tasting with interesting components. \n\nThere are lots of comments about service... moving in the room you could not help but bump into servers or runners or captains or bussers- I mean physically bump into them, in constant conversation with each other clusters of em...it is a large room and I am sure when this place is firing full bore the amount of people on the floor may be justified...but during the shift we were there for it just was awkward ... this group needs to be taught how to be attentive and alert while not being in the way. Our waitress made a point of asking us how each thing was ...asking everyone at table- one by one... and interrupting flow of conversation on several occasions to ask if everything was ok... \n\nok so service needs work, food is good and not expensive for this level of cooking-this is good place to take out of towners and conventiers and your parents. The bar looks like a good after work place to rub elbows with what would of once been the bar crowd at Stars... and maybe in a small way that is what this can be -the new hang out for trendy suits...nice contribution to the neighborhood!", "author": "Ricote F."}

The one comment I'd make is that it's a bit hectic -- the dining experience is not intimate, so you should know before you go (we were with a group, so it was just fine for us, but I wonder about the couple at the next table over... who were nearly close enough to eavesdrop).

Similar to Andrew E.'s review, everything we ate was delicious, but the service was uneven, so they only get 4 stars.  We showed up about 15 minutes before our reservation, and they said our table would be ready \"shortly.\"  About 25 minutes later, we felt completely ignored, like maybe they lost our reservation, and we got our table 5 minutes later, 15 minutes after our initial reservation and 30 minutes after we showed up.  When we sat down, the waitress asked us about our water preference, but not drinks, which she easily could've done.  Then she took our drink orders... and disappeared.  Someone else brought the drinks over, and 10 minutes after that, we still hadn't seen her again!  One of the food runners / bus people saw us looking confused, and asked us if we were ready to order.  He brought one of the guys in suits very quickly, and he took our order.  We didn't see our waitress still for about 5 more minutes, when she came by and noticed our menus were gone.\n\nWe ordered the tuna tartare and crispy pig trotters to start, and the beef and goat dishes as our mains.  The tartare was very good, but the menu made it sound like it would have more kick.  The pig trotters were very delicious as well, but I thought they would be more trotter and less croquette.  The beef was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the four different cuts of goat were all good in different ways.  Not as gamey as I thought, but I really liked the belly and the leg roulade.  The sides were good, but I probably could've used a little bit more, especially for the cost.  \n\nNothing on the dessert menu jumped out at us, but they brought me a nice malted chocolate ice cream and cookie because it was my birthday.  \n\nOverall, we loved the meal, but hopefully they tighten up the service a little bit before we come back next time!", "author": "Pilan C."}

I mentioned this to the waiter and we waited for another one which after 15 minutes arrived with the server stating here is one with no salt????? Ok????

Although everything was very fresh, I would skip the first three,  the Quail was exceptional.\n\nThe wines by the glass were good but a bit pricey.\n\nFor the Mains we devoured the Pasture Raised Veal Chop, definitely the best entree  and most expensive.  Cooked medium rare, the inside was very moist and the tasty exterior was excellent.  The Scallops and Local rock fish were fresh and very good but nothing special. \n\nFor Dessert we had the Molten Walnut Cake and the Asian Pear Tartine both were excellent and not overpowering sweet..  The Asian Pear Tartine has very distinctive  flavors that really work together.\n\nService was just ok ,  must have been the waiter having an off day.  But really didn't bother us.

The food was excellent.  I had the arctic char to start which was very light and refreshing.  The chicken roulade was amazing.  I rarely order chicken when I am out and boy am I glad that I did.  The sweet potatoes that accompanied the course were cooked perfectly and had the best taste.  My friends ordered either the Rock Cod (excellent and light), the Waygu, or the scallops.  Everyone was impressed, but the scallops were probably the least favorite (which was one of the waiter's top recommendations). \nFor dessert, we had the gingerbread doughnut holes and the smores...preferred the smores.\nI wish the restaurant was a bit smaller and more cozy and that it wasn't located in a bank building, but it was definitely excellent.", "author": "Cathryn L."}

I also like to eat at buffets and fine dining places- I'm flexible. lol. With that being said, the food at Prospect were new flavors to me- they did a great job at mixing a few unexpected flavors and some I couldn't even guess. Crab wasn't as fresh as I like it. Black cod was small (larger portions at Ozumo DOH said). But smoked trumpet mushrooms and wagyu beef- nice combo. tumeric with crab and caviar and cream sauce- interesting- not the best- but it was a different flavor. It was unexpectedly nice to eat something different. And it was good. not the best, but good. Would I eat there again-  probably, if I'm in the same neighborhood and don't want to walk anywhere else. \n\n3. like good service. They didn't look at DOH (Dear Old Husband) disdainfully because he was wearing a gray hoodie, a HEART t-shirt that read \"burn it to the wick\" ( the same shirt he wears to dog training), and MY jacket because he forgot his. They even asked if they could take his coat. One thing though, as in most fine dining experiences, expect a little class stratification. For those who look like they could spend more or have reservations, they get to eat in the cozy, quiet back, with even better service. Those of us who look like we have mid range designer clothes on (that's bloomingdales/high end designer macys SF, possibly Zaras) get seated in the noisy front, with smaller tables. and those who look like my DOH, well, they'll serve you anyway, but in the front and not in the back. not a kid in sight, so you probably shouldn't bring yours (i'm pregnant and have a 5 year old- I would leave them at home). \n\nDon't eat here if: \n1. you want the most bang for your buck (which is most of the time me, but for some reason I was a little relaxed about that for prospect)\n2. don't think \"ambience\" should be 40% of what you pay for\n3. really really really craving seafood- not a lot of options and portions were small. \n4. generally eat A LOT. \n5. your palate is comfort food-y and that's what you're craving.", "author": "rb r."}

It was awesome! \n\nLet me set it up for you. It's our last night in San Francisco and the group wants to go out with a bang. Prospect delivered the wowee powee evening we were looking for from the moment we walked in the door. We didn't have a reservation, which for a group of 10 could have been an issue, but the hostess passed out some drink menus, ushered us to a plush sitting area, and said it wouldn't be longer than fifteen minutes. I went up to the bar to order some bevies and before I knew it, the hostess was behind me with the rest of the group and Mark, the Prospect drink carrying Adonis. Oh, Mark and your silver tray on which you transported my gin greyhound from bar to table. With your swagger and your strut, flashing your pearly whites the entire length of the restaurant. It was almost as if you were walking in slow motion Mark, letting the moment linger. But I digress.\n\nOnce seated we met Robin. What can I say about Robin? She is the finest server I have ever encountered in my time dining out. Huge statement, but she's totally deserving. She was efficient, accommodating, helpful and aware. Plates seemed to arrive out of thin air and dissapear within seconds of being licked clean. She kept the drinks flowing, the water going and swapped out dirty flatware seamlessly. I can't give this woman enough praise without it starting to sound creepy, so I'll leave it at this: Go to Prospect, ask for Robin, sit back and enjoy every second.\n\nThe food was just as incredible as the staff. Our group split three appetizers and then we each picked an entree. Some had halibut, some had beef, one friend had a special vegan meal prepared, and while we all went with something different, we all agreed that the food was some of the best we had ever eaten. And if that isn't enough to get you over there THIS WEEK, I leave you with this: Our group, admittedly quite full, ordered one of every dessert on the menu-nine in total! It was insane, and slightly emotion (it brought tears to my eyes). I can't in words describe the amazing sweets that were set down in front of us. I don't even like dessert that much and even I was forking around for more. They were incredible and I can't wait to go back soon.

Apparently the chef was out of town during my first visit which they explained was most likely the reason for the oversalting.\n\nThe staff at Prospect was incredibly generous and gracious when we went back our second time.

I'm Chinese - we know what salty means and I can tell when things are oversalted.  Needless to say, the food was great... my friend and I kept joking that it could almost be a tad saltier.

I ended up ordering the arugula and radicchio salad with burrata.  The burrata was good because that's just how burrata is, but definitely not the best burrata I've had.  I feel like it had the creamy character of burrata that I normally expect, but it was slightly on the bland side.  Then I had the gnocchi appetizer as my main course because there wasn't a vegetarian main.  The gnocchi was pretty decent, but I think I expected more since it was Prospect.  The nettles made the dish over-salty, which I didn't particularly like.\n\nIn terms of offering vegetarian fare, I called ahead and the person I spoke to said that the kitchen could put something together for me, but my server suggested against that, which I totally agree with.  I don't like ordering off-menu because unless it's a secret special dish, if it was good enough to be ordered, it should just be on the menu.  I don't want some random vegetables they happened to have thrown into a saute pan without any particular sauce or garnish.

Get the Mr. White. \n\nHowever, the restaurant was 30 minutes late seating us, without much of an apology. Ok, the restaurant is new and hip, so we forgave it as we looked at the menu. \n\nThe food was fantastic, I especially recommend the Heirloom Beets (Walnut Brittle!) and the Wagyu Zabuton.\n\nHowever our dinner ended on a really sour note (hence the 2 rating):\n\nAfter lingering over dessert for a while, we got the waiter's attention and asked for the check. He brought it, we put down cards...then he disappeared for 30 minutes. We were finally able to flag down the manager at about 25 minutes, who explained their credit card machine was down with a pretty icy demeanor. At 30 minutes our waiter finally appeared with our credit card slips.\n\nWe can understand that \"things happen\", however the fact that no one came over to let us know what was happening and apologize profusely for detaining us was not acceptable. This occurred at the very end of the night (10:30-11pm) and there were only a few tables left, so it wasn't as if the staff was extremely busy. On the way out, my friend who had made the reservation tried to talk to the hostess about our experience and give some feedback, which was received negatively (basically she was told \"we don't care\"). \n\nMy other friend asked to speak to the manager, we repeated our feedback and we got pretty much the same response from him - a pretty insincere \"sorry\". At the end of our conversation he did give us his card and said the next time we came back we should let him know...however after the experience we had, I don't think I'll be coming back. \n\nLet me be clear - the most negative thing about the meal was not the mishaps and delays, but the nasty attitude of some of the staff.\n\nEvery other SF restaurant I've been in where you pay upward of $100 per person for a meal treats you like royalty. I guess Prospect feels like because they are the new hot young thing on the restaurant scene, they can treat you like dirt. My prediction: if the restaurant continues treating customers this way, they won't be around for long.

Everything had a delcious sauce or garnish. I had pork chops,and each bite melted in my mouth.  The portions were small. We savored each bit.  Each member of my family had a different dish, and each was remarkable. The service was great and the waiter helped me deicide what to have. I was deeply impressed by the restaurant.

I've been waiting for Prospect to open for a really long time and it was definitely worth the wait!  Boulevard spin-off, with Ravi Kapur as the Executive Chef? Yes, please! \n\nBAR: My first intoduction to Prospect was at the bar.  Very creative and exciting cocktails on the menu, like The Whaler, Kingston Crusta and Mr. Smith. Ask how they named The Whaler, it's a good story!  I'm usually a beer-drinker, but these drinks...oh these drinks... My faves are The Whaler & The Roxana, though I've also had the Classy Lassy, which is really good too, but no longer on the menu (if you ask nicely, I think they might still make it) ***Bonus points for the bartender who does this mambo-dancy-thing while he shakes the drinks... tee hee***\n\nRESTAURANT:  Let's get to the food.  I've been here twice for dinner and also ate once at the bar.  I'll make this simple, everything is good. At this level in the game, it's about what's better and best, not what's good or not. My favorite STARTER is definitely the Pig Trotters with the Buffalo Carpaccio coming in as a close second. I've also had the quail, scallops and the beet salad, which were all very good too. For the MAINS, I've had the beef cheeks, the Wagyu and the Lamb (well my husband did, but I sampled).  Of the three, the cheeks were my least favorite, but I don't have a good reason why, other than the other two were just soooo much better. The Wagyu and Lamb should be rare if you want that melt-in-your-mouth make-you-do-a-little-dance-in-your-chair kinda bite. As for DESSERT, I'm not a sweets kinda person, in fact I only like sweet if it's mixed with savory.  Enter Kulfi Ice Cream, which is everything I've ever wanted in a dessert. You should try this because it's different and you're up for some excitement in your life. \n\nAMBIANCE: I love love love the music they play, although I could barely hear it last time.  I'm so tired of going to upscale places where they either play boring old-people music that makes you feel like you're in church or they blast europop so loud because they're \"trendy\" that you can't even talk to the person across from you.  Prospect played some nice Salsa and Latin Grooves, it was refreshing. \n\nSERVICE: I read the other reviews and noticed there were a couple of comments about poor service.  Of the several times that I've patronized Prospect, I have always been treated politely so I have no complaints whatsoever.  In fact, I love that the service and food quality are on par with Boulevard but it's less expensive and somehow feels less stuffy. I urge you other patrons to cut the staff some slack, they just opened!\n\nWRAP IT UP:  Ravi Kapur is an amazing chef and he has cool hair. Cocktails are delicious (and strong), music is cool and the food is so much better than I could have hoped for. Don't forget to try the pig trotters, wagyu steak and the kulfi ice cream.", "author": "Antonia W."}

It appears to be similar to a a NY style bistro restaurant, with seating for 250 ppl at a time.  We had already been to a couple restaurants before stubbling upon Prospect, so were not real hungry.  Thankfully we decided to try the black cod appetizer, it was amazing.  The fish was seared perfectly with a golden crispy exterior and a sweet juicy center.  The broth that acompanied it was loaded with flavor.  \nFor desert we had the molten chocolate peanut butter truffle cake. It is absolutely the best desert I have ever had!!!  The cake was sitting utop chocolate ganach, then topped with roasted banana ice cream.  Oozing from the center of the cake was a chocolate ganache and some sort peanut butter cream.  Simply delish!  Next to the cake was a small scoop of a delicious chocolate truffle sorbet, that just melted in your mouth.  The plate was garnished with a couple bruleed banana pieces and peanut  toffee chips.

The food was OK---good but definitely not great.  Service was OK---adequate but not great.  And the prices and portions were way out of line.\nFirst off, there were NO specials.  How does an upscale restaurant that reputedly changes with the availability of produce/ingredients NOT HAVE ANY SPECIALS??? Lazy.  Our waiter didn't ask the two of us who declined cocktails if we wanted anything else.  The serving person forgot our bread until we asked.  Then during dinner, the waiter forgot the bottle of wine we ordered until we reminded her.  Is this starting to sound \"overrated\" yet? Of the four appetizers we had---octopus, trotters, yellowtail and beets---all were good but non memorable and all were tiny.  We also ordered the salmon with risotto, veal chop, and lamb. The 2 meats were very nicely done, exactly as ordered and the chop surprisingly was very generously portioned.  Not so the other dishes. We shared the ice cream sandwiches, ricotta doughnuts, and the popcorn---nice but quite average.  The older I get, the more I resent businesses trying to skate by on buzz and bling.

Had a very pleasant experience....it didn't knock my socks off as much I thought it might...but it was definitely an above average dinner.\n\nHighlights of the experience: \n\n- the mostly incredibly friendly staff. They did a great job of making us feel welcome which in a large format restaurant like this gave it a little more 'homey' feel. I used the word \"mostly\" because our server definitely was giving some attitude about the food. She told us that their portions are small....but they most definitely are NOT small...in fact they are very generous. Guess that was to encourage us to order starters. The misguided advice did not make me trust her recommendations. \n\n- The entrees were all very delicious. Two people ordered the chicken, one the pork and one the duck. We all raved about them. The duck and chicken came with three preparations of each which created a terrific plate and creative tasting options. I thought the duck was too smoky flavored and preferred the chicken.\n\nNot so highlights.... Can't even call these 'lowlights' because again, everything is above average but a few things that kept me from giving them five stars:\n\n- beet salad was pretty bland. Beautiful beets and greens but it just lacked any 'oomph'. The currants definitely helped...still would have liked a little more.\n\n- bread. I thought some corse salt on top would have enhanced the flavor.\n\n- tin roof sundae. skip it. Based on another reviewer, we were not offered a choice of sizes (more server attitude?) regardless, it was a bit too much peanut-butter ish for me. Given the sophisticated starters and entrees, the dessert menu seemed very casual. I'm guessing the carmel corn is fabulous, but I make my home tequila spiked carmel corn at home and it ROCKS. \n\nAnother option is to sit at the bar and have a light dinner off their bar menu. We'll definitely go back and give that a try.\n\nWith all the great restaurant choices in San Francisco, should you put Prospect on YOUR list? I'd say yes. It was a very relaxing elegant restaurant with friendly staff and mostly exceptional food.\n\nps. on street parking in the evening was very easy.", "author": "Annie N."}

I attended the second), but what I can say for sure - I will be back.  Oh and yay for free champenge!\n\nMany places like Prospect bank on the fact they have a nice location + good ambience, and sometimes just gets lazy with the quality of their food.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got to taste their sample menu because the quality was definitely there.  I had a few tastes of the steak sliders; the beef was medium rare and very tender, while the bread was not too stale and easy to bite into (I feel that the major pitfall for mini beef sliders usually lies in small pieces of stale bread that's hard to bite into, which wasn't the case here).   The little tiny piece of seasalt on the bread was a nice touch.  I also enjoyed the yellowtail appetzier on top of a shrimp chip, I believe - it felt very fresh and the thin slice of cucumber on top was a plus.  I had a bite of the soft shell crab and I thought it was delicious but I was also really hungry so I may be a tad biased... but it was definitely good if not great.  The scallops were seared just right and the sauce was light and yummy.  We ended the night with their chocolate fudge.. thingy with raspberries and blackberries - they were creamy and rich in texture and not too sweet :9.\n\nOverall, my experience here definitely makes me want to come back for a real taste when they officially open on June 29th :)!  The only caviat is that it won't be free anymore ;)  But please believe when I say this place was definitely decent - not only because I got to feast on free food and booze :) \n\nOh their Candice (looks like a cosmo but not) was really strong.  It's supposed to have cantelope, vanilla, and lemon but all I got to taste was alcohol - so I personally do not recommend it.", "author": "Angela H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-06", "description": "Prospect is a good restauarant but for the price will not likely be my \"go-to\" place for a nice meal in San Francisco.  Though the food was excellently prepared, the flavors were not memorable to me.  \n\nMy partner and I had dinner here on a Friday evening with a friend.  Cocktails and glasses of wine run between $9 and $16, starters between $9 and $16, entrees between $24 and $40, desserts about $9.  We knew the restaurant was on the pricier side, so we weren't surprised after a few drinks, three starters, three entrees, and two desserts our bill came to $230.  Here were our orders: \n\nStarters: Burrata with risotto, mushroom gnocchi, and citrus salad\nEntrees: Duck breast, stuffed chicken, and new york steak\nDesserts: Caramel cake with salted caramel sauce and roasted banana ice cream, creme brulee with citrus and meyer lemon meringue\n\nThe food was cooked perfectly - steak, chicken, and duck all moist and tender.  The gnocchi was light and smooth.  The risotto had a perfect bite.  Despite the strong execution, however, the food did not wow me.  Some of the sides were oversalted, but more importantly few of the dishes had very impressive flavor.  I appreciated the excellently prepared proteins, but the sides did not really add anything special to the dishes.  Complimentary focaccia is served, and it wasn't my favorite.  Not great, not bad.  A true filler.  \n\nFor dessert, I loved the roasted banana ice cream and the lemon meringue - I would eat more of that for days.  The creme brulee was good but not the best I've had.  The caramel cake was disappointing - almost dry, and the sauce wasn't really a sauce.  With the name \"salted caramel\" I expected so much more flavor, and didn't really get any.  \n\nIn general, if food is good I don't worry too much about service or ambiance, but in this case both detracted from my meal.  The restaurant space itself I thought was nice, but almost too modern in a jarring, sharp way.  The music was loud, and it almost felt like it was trying too hard.   I also really don't like the huge dish tiny portions phenomenon.  I don't mind the smaller portions necessarily (though $14 for the citrus salad is on the weaker end of \"value\"), but because the starters came on such large plates we could barely fit them on the table.  The service was not very good - a little slow, and almost rude.  In many ways it reflected the decor.  Again, my primary interest in a restaurant is food.  I can eat delicious food in a hideous place and with rude servers, but in this case the food wasn't enough to make me forget the atmosphere. \n\nIn the end, we left the restaurant satisfied but underwhelmed.  I would return to try some more dishes to see if my first impression remains, but I would rather try other restaurants first when spending $200 on a meal.  There are better restaurants in San Francisco for the price and quality.", "author": "P B."}

From the greeting of the smiling hostess to our walk through the intelligently designed space, you know you're in for a treat. The room is sexy, edgy and distinct. The floor to ceiling windows gives you a different perspective of how San Francisco looks. The bar is always buzzing with over flow of financial district foodies and Mission hi-end hipsters as well as the intellectual SOMA-ites. If you go there first, be sure to power down a Roxana or Catcher in the Rye, 2 of my favorite cocktails. \nOnce you are seated, in either a cozy banquette, or a table, you can see this staff knows what they're doing. Everyone flows through the space with ease. You can distinctly see who is the manager and who is the sommelier. \nWe started out ordering the Heirloom Beets with Walnut Brittle (killer - I mean like amazing) and the Yellow tail Crudo.  My guest who refuses to eat sushi with me, was changed for good when he tasted the Crudo - spectacular. We also tried the Buffalo Carpaccio because neither of us had ever had it prepared that way. Topped with a Hamma hamma oyster and we are talkin heaven people. \nEntrees we had the Wagyu Zabuton and the Pork Cheek & Belly. \nThe chefs really know a med rare temp and it melted in our mouths. I love the accent of the king trumpet mushroom - earthy and succulent. \nThe Pork cheek was so incredibly tender, the knifes took a vacation on this one. The seasoning and flavor were perfect. \nI didn't think we could even try dessert as my waist band was getting tighter - but I went for it, and I'm so glad I did. \nI had the peach hand pie, smores and the stone fruit ice cream sandwiches. \nIf I was home alone, I would lick the plate that had the peach pie - I think I almost did, and then I remembered I was in public. The smores were divine and melted in your mouth. \nStone fruit was perfect and not too sweet. I love the crunch of the cookie. \nPolishing the night off was a strong cup of French Roast coffee presented beautifully. \nService from start to finish was spot on. Our server didn't over wait or under wait our table. He checked in when he saw us take our first couple bites of each course and then removed plates as we were done with them. Our courses were paced just the way I like. \nWhen we asked for the check he got things moving right away and thanked us for coming in. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was too our liking. \nAll in all, Prospect exceeded our expectations and I will be going back again, again and again. Maybe tonight?\nBRAVO!!!!!!", "author": "Erica C."}

After the long wait to build, open and operate, the restaurant doesn't disappoint. The room is vibrant but understated at the same time, with warm earth tones and beautiful backlighting at the bar greeting customers. I was immediately impressed by the welcoming, comfortable and young vibe. \n\nThe bar is truly a gem, attracting young hipsters and empty nesters alike. I would come back time and time again to have one of the inventive, fun cocktails. In my two visits, the drinks have been consistent.\n\nService is also warm and effortless. Open for four days, the staff behaves as if they've worked together for years. Host staff is polished and genuine.\n\nI sat at the table and watched servers, bussers and food runners work through the room. No one seemed to sweat the first few nights, or the pressure to succeed in these crucial days. People smiled, staff smiled, and everyone sank in the room. Servers on my two visits were both knowledgeable and down-to-earth. Both could speak intelligently to both wine and food preparation.\n\nFood is divine. You know you're excited about a new restaurant when you're already planning what you'll eat the next time you go. Kudos to the kitchen for being cutting-edge but not taking itself too seriously- or trying to hard to embrace the useless trends we watch on the Food Network or Bravo. It's just smart, but creative, contemporary American food. The crudo dish is a favorite, the cod is a dish I wish came as a double entree portion (it's that good) and the porcini mushrooms were wonderful.\n\nThe chicken is one of the best I've had in SF. The sole was perfectly cooked, and the halibut on my second visit was probably my favorite entree. Entree set ups are perfectly seasonal and sauces are memorable. Oh, and the Green Goddess salad? Great execution.\n\nMost importantly (for me), desserts were out of this world. With a nod to comfort food, the 'smores and ice cream sandwiches make you forget you're not sitting on your couch watching a rerun of Sex and The City. I'd go back next time and order one fewer starter just to save room to try more desserts.\n\nWell done, and thanks for bringing an interesting, classy restaurant into the SF scene.", "author": "k k."}

The food was very good, but very overpriced.  The service was extremely efficient, but I found our waiter to be a bit cold.  Also, the bussers could use a lesson in etiquitte.  I know that they have to reach over people to get their plates, but they should never touch you in any way.  So when I got the a close elbow to the head, I was like, \"Damn, that was close.\"\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing part of it all was the decor and the vibe.  It's not an intimate place.  Such a great space and they did nothing to make it feel warm.   Contrast that to Boulevard or RN-74.  Although I'm not a huge fan of RN's food, the atmosphere is a bit more \"down\" and intimate.  I can't help but get a bit of a cafeteria feel from Prospect's space.  \n\nFor the price point, I think that Boulevard is a better choice.  Additionally, I found the portions to be really really small.", "author": "Angela L."}

And both times, the services were simply superb. The waiters at Prospect were attentive and were certainly very knowledgeable about their menu (which is a trait that I always appreciated). \n\nI thought the main dishes themselves were good, but they were not superb. To me, they definitely tasted on a slightly saltier side, but it wasn't non-eatable. I suppose that's just to individual's taste bud to decide. However, their desserts were awesome! The first time I was there, my boyfriend and I tried the Petit S'mores (4 petite sized). One probably wouldn't think that \"s'mores\" would make it to the restaurant's dessert menu, but this dessert dish is one of the better ones I had in a long time! With the house made marshmallows, graham wafers, melted ganache, and syrah reduction, this dessert dish tasted like a little piece of heaven. Not too sweet, not too overwhelming, just the right amount to bring your camping memory to an elegant restaurant setting. I would totally recommend it!\n\nThe second time when I was there with a friend, we had the Asian Pear Tartine and the Double Lemon Souffl\u00e9 Cake. Both were so well balanced, again, not too sweet and not too heavy with the right blend of sweet/tart and warm/cold. Simply delicious.\n\nWhile I don't know if I would come back here to their dinner anytime soon, I certainly would drop by anytime for some great service and dessert menu. \n\nNote: Aside from dinner, Prospect also has weekend brunch and happy hour M-F from 4pm-6pm!", "author": "Erica C."}

Our entrees were just as delicious - salmon and lamb loin.  I really wanted to try the sea bass, but they were sold out, but I wasn't disappointed with the salmon.

It was a very simple and classy meal-just my style. Tho I must admit, I did question whether I made the right choice when someone at my table was served their Scallops. They looked amazing too, and apparently, they tasted even better than they looked! \n\nBoth main courses were perfectly prepared, presented, seasoned and accompanied.

The beet salad was amazing, and my buddy got a panko-encrusted poached egg that was terrific.  He asked about the cooking, and the waiter explained that it's cooked at 62.5 degrees for an hour in a water bath (this is also called \"chilling,\" but I guess \"cooking\" is OK) and then they roll it in the panko and flash-fry it.

I have been an admirer and diner of Prospect's older sister, Boulevard for 8 years and had not yet had the chance to visit Prospect. After last nights above and beyond experience I know that we will frequent this wonderful establishment often. Everything from the exemplary service, to the attention to detail, wonderful wine, and mouthwatering food lived up to the Boulevard standard. We started the evening in the chic, bustling bar that I recommend stopping by for a drink. Great crowd and contemporary, but inviting decor. We moved onto dinner,  sat at a great table and we were attended to pitch perfectly. We ordered a divine hand picked dungeness crab salad, the gnocchi and the burrata risotto as appetizers. We were also treated to some extra's from the very attentive manager, Scott Carr. Every entree was devoured, and presented to perfection. I highly recommend the sole, kobe bavette or pork. Having tasted just those three dishes, I can firmly attest to the perfection of each. The pork was out of this world. It was hard to keep the conversation going as we were so distracted by the delicious meal. For dessert we were brought a sampling of the ice cream sandwiches, and caramel corn, in addition to the banana fosters that we ordered and some sorbet. I have always been a big critic of the dessert course. Prospect's desserts were beyond the standard that I expect from a contemporary casual fine-dining establishment. In fact, I am really not a fan of banana's in general but the BF leaves me wanting more! I can't wait to get back and order it again. As I write this, I feel a mouth watering desire to return as soon as possible. The service was top-notch, very warm, knowledgable, arriving at the right moment each time - seamless. When you are experiencing expertly crafted cuisine, sumptuous wines and are in good company, having the perfect attention to detail with the staff is the icing on the cake.

I ordered the wagyu steak and my friends ordered the scallops with brussel sprouts and salmon.  I tasted both the scallops and the salmon. The salmon was pretty good, in my opinion nothing to write home about but my friend really liked it. The scallops were divine.  The wagyu was equally as yummy - it taste as if it had been slightly smoked and was cooked perfectly and served with porcini mushrooms and potatoes.  The potatoes were the one thing that we all agreed was not good - they had no flavor and were dry. We got the cornflake french toast for dessert and it was very good - soft in the middle, a bit crunchy on the outside, with plums skattered on top and some nut and a perfect sized scoop of ice cream. \n\nSo then we come to the service. The service is the reason I would not give it 5 stars.  When we ordered 2 apetizers for 3 people, our waitress commented, is that all, ONLY two (emphasizing only). We continuously felt like she was trying to get our next order out of us as if she wanted to rush us. She then made the same ONLY comment when we ordered ONLY one dessert to share.

It sounded good enough to us, so we walked over and easily being the most under-dressed customers we sat down.

She got our drinks and even chatted with our friend who was making no sense. Soon dayboat scallops, young quail and petaluma organic chicken. Let me start with the chicken because it was softest, most tender and juiciest meat without the meat actually falling apart I've ever had. Even the brussel sprouts were delicious and a little sweet. If I could describe ambrosia, it would be that bite of chicken with foie gras. My scallops weren't bad, a bit tougher. Otherwise seared perfectly with the right color. The sunchoke puree complimented the scallops well and they substituted my spinach with baby bean sprouts.This is actually a unique vegetable and can only be done one way, boiled in water with oil. Thumbs up Prospect for knowing asian vegetables!!

The service at the bar was fast, despite it being packed with professional-types from the financial district crowd.  The table service really needs to pick up their speed - we waited about 30 min. between being greeted by our server and having him come by to take our drink and meal orders.

The salmon with fava beans was good but immemorable.  After having dropped over $200 for this meal and  with one of us in a leg cast, I was frankly shocked that the snooty maitre d' outright refused to call us a cab (because we forgot our phone) and then noted that it's hard it is to get a cab in the neighborhood.

I went with four close friends, excited to have a night of great food and drinks. I honestly can't think of one thing about this restaurant that would make me want to go back, except maybe the beautiful modern design and cool sinks in the bathrooms. Other than that, here's why I'm so confused by the awesome reviews:\n\nFirst of all, the place is way too big. It feels like you are having dinner in a hotel ballroom. The night we went most of the crowd was over 60. Seemed strange and not necessarily a bad thing...just interesting. All four of us started with cocktails and they were all tasty but I don't think there was alcohol in any of them. \n\nWe order 3 apps, the trotters, cod and a green goddess salad. The salad was delicious. the trotters were overly rich and salty. The cod was good but again, overly salty and the portion size was ridiculously small.\n\nTwo of my friends had the massive bone in veal shank. It was VERY expensive and just mediocre. I had the scallops which we all agreed were the best entree of the bunch. Still, I found them overly salty and they were gritty as well. One of us also had the Wagyu beef. It was overpowered by some sort of smoky flavoring and very chewy and of course, salty. \n\nOur waiter was very cute but the service was terrible. We waited for about an hour in between our apps and main course and no one ever apologized or even came over to see how we were doing. \n\nAll in all, we summed up the meal feeling a bit bloated with salt and fat. I would take Delfina every time over this place. Just not good enough to be getting this hype in a city full of such amazing food.", "author": "Nina R."}

Mistake on my part. But I like to try out the latest and greatest. \n\nI first must say we LOVE Boulevard. World-class restaurant. So we were excited to try Prospect and sorely disappointed. \n\nFirst of all Prospect is located in an old office building and has retained that feeling especially toward the back of the restaurant through to the restrooms.\n\nSEATING/RESERVATIONS: \nWhen we went it was packed and although we had reservations, they had a 45 minute wait, so we ended up bellying up at the bar. \n\nFOOD:\nThe bartender suggested the Goat dish and it was right on - the best we had from the menu. We also tried the Petrale Sole, which was par, nothing exciting. One of the appetizers that was great was the Calamari (complex flavors and smoked potato that rocked).\n\nENERGY: Lacked energy and needs some music or something in the bar area to escape the sleepy quiet vibe. \n\nDECOR: \nI believe Prospect is trying to convey a theme of \"Modern Goldrush\". I get that from the hanging hurricane lanterns above the bar and the way the bartenders were dressed with bowties and rolled up sleeves high on their arms. They should have taken the theme further, but not to a theatrical point. The entry and bar is not bad, but it lacks energy.  The decor overall is bland, nothing pops. It appears they spent their entire decor budget on the front of the house and ran out of money in the back of the house and \"restrooms\" I like to refer to them, because they are so lacking any style... they seemed thrown together with the end result feel of a Marriott Hotel restroom, not a cool hip bathroom for a new restaurant in San Francisco. They also have very random plants placed throughout the back of the restaurant, a Palm and another bushy plant on the way to the bathrooms that just doesn't match the modern vibe of the restaurant. There is a long, long wood plank wall along the left side of the restaurant. Going with \"Modern Goldrush\" it should have been distressed planks, not looking like it could be the wall in a JCREW store.  It is just boring and they need a serious punch of color on that wall. From the right-side there are dramatic windows (which they got right) which reflect the bar shelving. There is one cool dining space I feel right behind the bar. A long table with 3 oversized hanging lamp shades. That is probably the only place I would want to sit besides the bar. Once you go into the back dining area, it feels like a diner, large and nothing interesting.", "author": "Tsuni S."}

The duck entree consisted of two slabs of well cooked breast meat and then some confit duck leg meat wrapped in cabbage leaves to form a small \"mini-cabbage\" on the place.  Makes for an adorable plating, but for some reason this dish didn't quite knock my socks off -- I thought the duck was a little gamy and that is could have used just a bit more sauce on this dish, but it was certainly satisfying.

Choosing Prospect was pre-meditated, but we still laughed at the irony of having dinner at a place of the same name as the candidates that submit 14,500 applications every fall.  \n\nSunday evening parking was a cinch (in fact, easier than scoring a reservation in the first place).   By the time we departed at 8:00 pm, every table in the place was taken.  The economic recovery is happening, Mr. Bernanke!  Just come visit San Francisco's newest New American culinary fixture where a $100/person budget means you might need to cut some corners when it comes to drinks or dessert.\n\nIn case you were wondering, Prospect = pricey.\n\nThe service was highly attentive and a substitution of spinach for cauliflower was seamless.  The heirloom tomato starter was succulent, but sad to say, heirloom season is basically over until next June.  You'll have to settle for the quail, which received rave reviews from a fellow diner.  I defaulted to salmon risotto for a main course.  The ratio of fish to rice was almost overwhelming (particularly for a nice restaurant where portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side).  Not that I'm complaining... (or am I?!)\n\nThe dessert list presented some major decision paralysis but after much consideration, I selected the java chip ice cream sandwiches.

But this being the brainchild of the touted Boulevard team, one expects nothing that falls short of perfection!  I was prepared for a high sticker price, but also incredible food.\n\nWe dined at Prospect on a January Saturday night.  Our reservation was set and we were seated in a timely fashion.  The venue is absolutely stunning, let there be no arguing about that! \n\nThe seating was exceptionally comfortable (we got a nice round table reminiscent of a booth, but dressed with a few additional chairs).  Unfortunately, it took over 15 minutes for anyone to approach our table, and on a cold wet night, we were all ready for a drink!\n\nEventually, we waved someone down and our server introduced himself.  He was curteous, but obviously rushed and a bit frazzled.  \n\nGiven a good half hour passed by the time we received drinks (from the time we arrived), bread and butter would have been nice.  We had to ask for that as well.  The bread was rationed one slice per plate, and although it looked like a gorgeous herbed focaccia, I soon realized it was more of an icebox cake.  Actually, the texture was phenomenal, and the flavor may have been, had the bread not been so cold that it felt as if it had just been pulled out of the refrigerator.  Perhaps this is intentional - for whatever reason I cannot understand.  I firmly believe that room-temperature bread is fine (I do not have to have my bread warm), but cold bread, not what i was looking for.\n\nWe ordered a number of starters that we shared.  The Foie Gras lived up to my expectations, and the sea urchin risotto surpassed any I may have had.  The sweetbreads were flat and one-dimensional.  A huge let-down.\n\nIt's safe to say that all of us liked our main courses.  I had the duck.  The outside was extremely crisp and the meat on the inside succulent - perfection.  The outer skin was too salty for me, though, even to be enjoyed as a foil to the sweetness of the duck meat.  I had to let it sit on the side of the plate.  The various accompaniments on the plate were interesting.  The pickled grape, the greens, the sauce were all extraordinary.  I still have not figured out what the \"other thing\" on my plate may have been.  It tasted like a glorified rice-cake - but not made out of popped rice... just wet rice (I know it was not rice....).  I found it drew away from the rest of the dish.\n\nThe mutton-eaters all loved their dish.\n\nThe wine list offers many choices, but the prices really hurt.  I understand they have to pay for overhead costs somehow, so I can excuse that....  Still, paying $60 for an $20 bottle of wine just doesn't feel good.\n\nDessert - I wasn't going to bother, but something about that molten chocolate cake with peanut-butter filling was beckoning!  It was really sweet and really gooey and really delicious, I must admit.  And the ice cream was phenomenal!  Generally, I am not a fan of very sweet desserts, but I expected this to induce sugar-coma, so that worked out fine.  \n\nOverall, it was a good meal.  The bill was astronomical and the service could have been a little better.  I give it 3 stars because, in a city like San Francisco, The Prospect of finding food that rivals even this... is a pretty good one... and at a better price.", "author": "M T."}

I was asked for my CC to secure the booking as it was a larger party (7) (and a business dinner) - no prob except they won't take credit card details over the phone so make you complete a form that is faxed and illegible (I'm not into emailing my cc details - call me crazy. \n\n2.

Nice. \n\n3.  4 days before the actual booking, they call me again to confirm the booking.  \n\nOK, so let's see, that's one, two, three times I have said I will be there plus they have my credit card.

However, in person it was very beautiful and spacious with warm tones and a non-fussy, comfortable furniture.  All the requisite necessities of a fine restaurant were present, including Riedel glasses and Laguiole steak knives.  \n\nFOOD: There were four of us so we decided to sample one another's starters, which included the Monterey calamari, soft shell crab, black cod and dayboat scallops.  All of these were flavorful, balanced, and downright AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  For my entr\u00e9e, I had the pan-fried halibut with carrots, pistachios and basil butter, which was perfectly cooked and really brought out the flavors and texture of halibut.  My friends had the wagyu beef and lamb loin and they were as satisfied with their mains as I with mine.  Finally, we again decided to order a bunch of desserts to share, which included the smores, ice cream sandwiches, vanilla cake and chocolate orbit.  Again, all the desserts were just amazing, and I don't even have that much of a sweet tooth.  I should also mention that a fifth friend joined us for dessert and our server made sure that 5 smores and 5 ice cream sandwiches were sent out, even though only 4 are included per order.\n\nPRICE: The prices are fairly reasonable considering the quality of the food and the excellent preparation and presentation.  I have to say though, the portions are on the smaller side, but my pants thanked me for that. \n\nSERVICE: Our server was amazing, even though his name escapes me.  He was friendly, knowledgeable about wine, and wasn't too intrusive ... in essence the perfect server!  However, the complete opposite must be said about bar service.  Since some of us arrived early, we decided to have a round of cocktails.  Although it wasn't too busy and we did find stools immediately, we sat there for about 15 minutes before any of the bartenders even acknowledged us.  After they saw my hateful stare (j/k), two of them approached us simultaneously and gave us cocktail menus.  We then sat again for at least another 10 minutes before they took our drink orders.  I don't even remember what I ordered, but my $11 cocktail was served in a martini glass that was barely 2/3 full.  Needless to say, the word I'd use to describe the bar is \"atrocious.\"  \n\nCONCLUSION:  Had it not been for our experience at the bar, I would've given Prospect a full five stars so my advice is AVOID THE BAR and spend that extra $22 on a second starter or dessert!", "author": "Doug V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-24", "description": "I've been to prospect twice and both times were quite disappointing. I don't plan to go again. I found much of the food unexciting but mainly the kitchen and service aren't up to par for a restaurant positioning itself like Prospect. There are too many other good choices in San Francisco to retry Prospect. \n\nThe first time I went,  it took 10 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order. When he finally arrived for our food order, no mastery of the menu was demonstrated but instead he simply said, \"everything we have in the kitchen today is on the menu.\" He came back again and simply asked, \"what would you like\"? That just isn't impressive. Later in the evening he came by to check on us, but it was after our plates were cleared and he asked, \"how did you like your dinner?\"  Unless he plans on writing a review, I don't understand how that is of any help. It sort of defeats the purpose of being a waiter. \n\nThe second time I went with my girlfriend; unfortunately the service was poor again. So much so, that she even commented on whether the waiter was going to come and take our order.  That is just unacceptable and I resented being put in that position by a restaurant positioning itself like Prospect. \n\nI admit that the duck and the lamb are quite tasty, but too many of the other dishes I tried were boring. For example, the starter of Dungeness crab ($17) contained two small bites of crab surrounded by something that basically passed for mayonnaise. It had some interesting onion in it but it was drowned by the mayonnaise. The other starter we had,  veal sweat breads ($17),  was very tender but devoid of flavor other than a very mild mushroom flavor. For dinner, my girlfriend had the pacific petrale sole ($28).  In general I find Sole to be a boring fish but I expected Prospect to make it more interesting with creative flavors, but all I could taste was excessive salt. It was a classically over salted dish with little else to help it.  You would expect more from the kitchen.", "author": "dempsy H."}

The halibut tasted a little dry, but was a real treat; and the char was very tasty.   Desserts, again, were very good.\n\nThe wait staff seemed to think we needed to be schooled, or something.  First, the apparent shock  from the server that not all of us would  have a cocktail seemed off-putting.  By the time she asked my wife to repeat 3 times that she wanted beer to go with her halibut, the service crossed over from frosty to theater.  We all thought about ordering beer with dessert just to watch her infarct.  Once we accepted the theatrical ludicrousness of Prospect, we enjoyed ourselves and had a fine evening out.\n\nRecommendation:  go to Prospect for fine eating.

When we first met, she was barely illiciting friendliness and seemed bother by us ordering food. HELLO, we are eating in a restaurant.

One of the best dishes I've ever had. If you don't like oysters, or perhaps you don't like Buffalo, I don't really care, you should eat this, it's absolutely delicious. Also had the soft shell crab, wasn't crazy about this one, not that it was bad, I just didn't think it was a strong dish. If you're looking for a salad when you go, or you're going with a vegetarian, the green goddess salad is nice. It's clean and leaves you ready for the next course. The pork cheeks were okay, but the highlight of the night and one of the highlights of dishes in the city of San Francisco is the Buffalo carpaccio with fried oysters. Go there for this and build your meal around it.", "author": "Hayden H."}

This is what we had:\n\n- Sea urchin risotto with lobster and scallops. Absolutely decadent, each piece of sea food was cooked to perfection and seasoned individually to produce a well balanced dish. Portion was meager.\n- Crispy pig trotters with shaved cured head. Savory and crunchy, with a great touch of acid (from capers?).\n- Pork cheeks. This dish was a generous symphony of texture and flavor. The meat was soft and beautifully glazed. There was a lot on the plate -- buckwheat, spaetzle, turnip puree, braised parsnips, apple brunoise, orange, herbs -- but it all came together beautifully.\n- Roast goat. Another extraordinary entree, interesting but delicate. It was served with white beans and pureed lentils.\n- Molten walnut cake with vanilla ice cream and poached quince. As good as dessert gets; the cake sat on top of a sumptuous puddle of dark caramel.\n- Chocolate extravaganza (brownie, salted caramel chocolate shortbread, ice cream). My bf had this and loved it. \n\nThe wine list is expensive and they skimp on portions for wine by the glass. So expect to spend $100 a head minimum for 3 courses and drinks.\n\nThe service was good, though they failed to call a cab for us (at this price point, I expect that much).

Along the way, the waiter never communicated the reason for the delay. No one brought any additional bread, which would have been nice given the time intervals. When we finally complained, the waiter, who we no longer recognized, said that the kitchen was backed up due to a large party. Not a good excuse for just plain bad service. Interestingly, we saw several waiters and staff come by, each time with their hands empty. Wonder where they were going? The unfortunate part of all this is that the food was quite excellent. But unfortunately the service was as bad as the food was good. We noticed that several of the other tables were equally perturbed about the service. Not a very good experience eating good food in a very very foul mood. And best of all, the bill was $410 for this very negative experience.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed and immediately directed to our seats.  The restaurant is open with high ceilings which makes the place feel comfortable.  Decor was a plus.\n\nNow, for the good, this is where the good stuff comes along.  Our waitress, Nahide, was a gem.  She was very friendly, patient with our questions, attentive and provided great recommendations on dishes and wine.  It was like she read our minds - ALL dishes we were thinking about, she called out as her favorites.  From that point, we HAD to go with it.  We ordered the following:\n\n- Black Cod: Wonderful.  Soft, buttery and just melted in your mouth.  I would say a bit on the small side, but it was tasty.\n- Foie Gras Torchon:  First question, \"do you like butter?\"  If so, this is a must.  I'm not a big Foie Gras fan (or butter for that nature), but this was good.  Not heavy at all and great with the wheat toast.\n- Dayboat Scallops:  Yum.  The mixture with the mint, cauliflower and curried potatoes made for a great combination.  Scallops were cooked to perfection.  One recommendation would be to perhaps have the curried potatoes mashed... but either way, great dish.\n- MCCormack Ranch Goat:  Never had goat - and a great place to try it for the first time.  Very lean.  \n- Ice Cream Sandwiches, Peanut Butter Truffle Cake and the Smores:  YUM, YUM, YUM.  Coming into the restaurant I knew were were going to pile high with the desserts, and this was no disappointment.  Great ending to a great meal.  Fresh, light and not too overwhelming.  \n\nAll in all, a great experience and I would definitely come back.

Our SF family of four arrived for dinner Friday night and were promptly seated.  Our server was not particularly solicitous when we ordered, but whatever.  Our first courses arrived and were good, I really enjoyed my ahi.  But then we waited and waited and waited for our main courses.  And with the time we spent waiting, we noticed that all other tables received an amuse bouche, but nope, not us.  Not sure why we were left out?   Would have liked to have had it!   After at least 15 minutes of waiting, but probably more like 20, our waiter came over and told us our food would be four or five more minutes, no apology, no explanation.    When it finally arrived, the risotto portion of my duck dish was over-salted and my vegetables had gone cold.   Having asked in advance for a candle to be placed on my husband's desert, we ordered desert, some cake for my husband and caramel popcorn for my 16 year old son.  Well the birthday candle was placed in the popcorn and given to my son.  No, I am not married to a 16 year old and the candle goes with cake, not popcorn!  Wow guys, way to ruin a birthday dinner!!!  Not sure how to explain this, we are maybe not the appropriate demographic being in our 50s with kids in their late teens.  But shouldn't the restaurant cater to all?

They have a very limited selection. Normally you order an appetizer  and an entree.  The appetizer is in general a salad which is around $12.  All their appetizer and entrees are mediocre and the portion is very small. The food may look good but is poorly seasoned and uninspired.  I tried the Blood Orange and dates salad which had no redeeming taste except for the cheese in it and very tiny pieces of blood orange. Then I had the roasted duck which had nothing to speak about. Desserts are good specially the Alaskan roasted ice cream or some such name, all expensive.   The ambiance is subdued and rather somber, with dimly lit dark walls it seems and very ugly pictures which add no value to the experience. Perhaps they have an older clientele and the owner is color blind.  The dining room is poorly decorated. What can I say, perhaps it would be considered good in Chicago where the food is in general insipid. The poor souls who go into this restaurant perhaps go there because of the high prices as the restaurant is located in a very expensive area near the water front.  Please fire the chef.and hire a decorator. The service is good and polite, for the price there needs to be some entertainment, perhaps some guitar and lire at least on Saturdays.", "author": "Dural L."}

That's the problem, it was just fine, not the spectacular meal or the hospitable service that otherwise matched the price tag we paid.  Here is the breakdown of my rating.\n\n-1 star: I ordered 2 non-alcoholic drinks, strawberry guava lemonade and a virgin mojito, both of which were sour beyond drinkable - I had to ask for sugar.  It was nice though that they have non-alcoholic option at all, so this was a plus for the restaurant on my part.\n-1 star: I ordered the sea bass for entr\u00e9e, and it was salty.  That was one of my big pet peeves - a restaurant of this caliber should not have this problem!  I didn't finish the dish so I asked for it to be boxed.  I said it twice to the server and he kept nodding his head & saying \"sure, later\".  I didn't want to say it anymore because it looked like I started to irritate the guy.  Anyway, when they're ready to bring us the dessert menu, one of them asked me if I'm done with my dinner and I said yes.  Well, needless to say, I never saw the rest of that dinner again.  Well, I didn't like it all that much, so I didn't make a fuss about it.\n-1 star: This part is really really bad. After dinner, many of our group had to take a cab back to their hotel.  One of my colleagues went to the hostess and asked if they could call a few cab for us.  Well, I didn't know how that conversation went, but when we finished, the rest of them ended up having to stand in on the side walk, in the cold and wind to hail their own cab.

The greatness of the menu and the food is lost on the aggravation of searching for the waiter. \nThere is a man circling with bread, but you can tell that he has been given specific orders not to put bread on the table until wine has been ordered, but we were ridiculously starving by the time we even saw the waiter for our wine order - and after that waiting the bread was cold and hard!  \nThe wine was not a good one, and the waiter did not come up with a more affordable wine suggestion; he just pushed the most expensive one on the list. \nNow finally onto the food: The carpaccio with shaved radishes was absolutely beautiful and the flavor was intense and fresh. The cod appetizer was really delicate and the red curry sauce was a great start to warm up the belly with comforting flavors. \nNext I had the scallops dish which was most definitely like art on the plate; from the bright green and orange colors, to the combination of nutty, caramelized sweetness, and fresh sea taste from the scallops and wild rice. Fellow diners had the goat dish that was so delicious and not gamey at all; and the cod with an amazing mandarin hollandaise sauce that gave a light creaminess to the fish. \nTo finish the desserts all looked great, but were only average. We had the lemon tart, mexican chocolate brulee and the ice cream sandwiches. All of them seemed a little too large and not refined enough. The star ingredients of each dessert dish did not shine through enough for me.\nAll in all, interesting dinner experience of new flavors and ingredient combinations, but a strange environment that was uncomfortable for the average diner.", "author": "Alexandra a."}

We decided to try this place for brunch after reading about all the hoopla surrounding it.  The space is very modern and spacious, something we appreciate.  We both ordered an egg dish, mine was the crab, artichoke and chive omelette.  I also ordered decaf coffee (have to ration caffeine intake nowadays, or else...) which was excellent!!  I'd come back just for that.  But then we waited and waited and waited for the food to arrive, and when we finally asked about it, about 20 minutes later, we were given 2 slices of house made banana bread that was quite delicious and held our hunger at bay until our food finally came, about another 5-10 minutes.  And, yes, it was worth the wait.  The omelette had so much crab in it and was cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of salt. The homefries were also seasoned well.  My partner's oven baked egg dish was also a big hit.  We are already planning of when we will come back!", "author": "Yvette F."}

I and two guests walked over for dinner after enjoying the Fisher exhibit at the MOMA, and had a wonderful time. We arrived before the dinner rush, but by the time we left (around 8 on a Tuesday) the place was packed. A BIG plus was that it never was too noisy to hold a normal conversation, may be the high ceilings but we could enjoy each others' company without having to shout over other patrons. The decor was tasteful and modern, and staff professional but friendly- not at all stuffy. One of my friends is glucose-intolerant, and the waitress was very helpful and detailed in suggestions, and the chef Ravi modified a dish (pork cheeks and belly-YUM!) for his diet. We were also impressed that the gentleman serving bread knew not to leave a roll at my friend's plate- excellent communication between waitstaff.\n\nFood was delicious, we shared everything from calamari, scallops, trotters and heirloom beets for appetisers to the pork cheeks and belly, lamb and halibut for dinner. All very good, but must say that the pork and lamb were most outstanding. \n\nCannot wait to go back, great food and wonderful ambiance, works for both entertaining clients and for romance.", "author": "Kathleen P."}

Starters, original, very well done but truly tiny, even for a very light eater.  Best taste of the evening was the Shrimp Fritter noted as part of the Balck cod Starter, only problem was it was one single bite.  Mains, while more substantial, are not as interesting as Starters. For my tastes, plenty of better alternatives, even within walking distance. My guess is much better for lunch, unless you are more interested in looking very nonchalant while you have dinner, a cocktail or casually saunter to the restroom, all while talking on cell phone or texting those folks who are more important than current company.

It was a beautiful red color and garnished with a sprig of rosemary that delighted my sense of smell with each sip! Nicely done mixologist!  The decor is beautiful- however I did notice one of the lamps was out over the bar... sorry but its a pet peeve of mine.  At the table we were introduced to our server who was knowledgeable, warm, and gave suggestions without being a pushy salesman.  I am sorry I can't remember his name but he was from Seattle I think.  Anyways- the stars of the evening were all the delicious plates of food.  So, for appetizers we shared the soft shell crab and the calamari.  Soft shell crab was cooked perfectly, still very juicy and tender but pretty typical served in a cornmeal crust with a corn salad underneath.  The calamari were delicious.  I loved the balance of the pureed chick pea with a little bit a greens and the acid of a lemony dressing. For mains we had the Patrale Sole and the Halibut.  Both prepared perfectly and very tasty.  I absolutely loved the dessert we had.  Cherries with a meringue and Greek frozen yogurt.  It was beautiful! And again, a great balance of sweet and tart.  Yum Yum. I want to go back just for the dessert!", "author": "Kimmy C."}

We threw some search terms at Google and came up with Prospect. I would now like to take a moment to bow my head in thanks to whatever spirits delivered us there. The ambiance is airy and modern but warm color accents prevent it from being cold. Our server was excellent - knowledgeable without being supercilious, friendly without being ingratiating, and she seemed to really enjoy her job. Every bite of the food, from appetizers through dessert, was absolute heaven! As the only male, I ended up finishing all the entrees, so I know that all of them were wonderful. My halibut was cooked to absolute perfection, with only a frothy bit of sauce that complemented the wonderful flavor of the fish without interfering with it. I had a Chablis that was a perfect match for my halibut. For dessert, I had the banana creme pie sundae, and it was fantastic. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth every penny? In my opinion, and those of my companions, YES!!", "author": "Randall S."}

The minute we walked in, the hostess was fab, speaking to us the entire way to the table. Our server, Kevin, was engaged and completely willing to walk us through the entire menu. At first glance of the menu, I thought, UGH, another Top Chef, winners delight deconstructed, blah blah, how many fancy adjectives can one use to describe overpriced boiled potatoes on a menu. Kevin made his recommendations and we started with a cocktail. Mr. White (the drink) is fantastic and I do not usually drink te-killa. Yummy, we all ended up skipping the bottle of wine to stick with cocktails. We shared a few starters, all yummy, but do the potato gnocchi for sure! Entrees included lamb, chicken and the beef. All entrees were umami. A root beer float cake, vanilla cake, and two of the most velvety cappuccino's later we finally finished. For the price, we could not believe what an amazing meal we had. In fact, we all agreed it was worth more than we paid considering the typical SF fare. We have all done Danko (still a favorite), Minna (still a disappointment), the Town Hall, A16, RN74, etc tour and Prospect is best of show.

The bar was packed to the wazoo with your typical neighborhood business people from all walks of life from the rich to the not-so-rich. The wine list was good and the food was above average.  Don't expect to have big portions; it's definitely your food sampler/tasting size. There were three of us and we ordered quite a bit: beet salad, tomato salad, soft shell crab, potato dumpling to start.  For entrees, I had the steak (forgot the exact name of it now), he had the fish (i forgot was it a halibut or sea bass?), she had the chicken with grits.  I enjoyed the beet salad and potato dumpling and my steak the most. The steak was superb!!!! I dont eat red meat often but whenever i'm at a nicer restaurant, i try to order to compare. It wasnt big by any means but after all those apps, you only need a small portion. The soft shell crab was rather disappointing, it tasted more like batter with skinny crab. The tomato salad was just okay. I've had my best at Scala's on Powell. The dumpling is a must-order -it was the perfect slippery soft dumpling. YUM!  I tried a piece of chicken; it was good but it's chicken so you cant really say much about that. His fish was really tasty.  We shared the smores and hand made peach pie. dont bother ordering the smores, it was nothing special. you can just make some at home and it would taste similar but the peach pie, YUMMMY!  Save a bit of tummy space for this.  After 250,000 calories later, I would recommend this restaurant.

They've only been open a week so have some service kinks to work out with respect to service (wine came a little late, our finished meals stayed a little long at our table, they forgot the wine list upon sitting down..).  \n\nI will say that the two appetizers we ordered were absolutely amazing.  I highly recommend the potato dumplings/gnocchi and scallops.  If we came again, we would just order wine and four or five appetizers instead of two main entrees.  Our fish main entree, a petral sole, was pretty bland but the Wagyu beef was full of flavor.  It was highly marbled and I loved the crisp exterior - I haven't had it like that way before - genius!  I would have appreciated a better cut though - it wasn't the best Wagyu I've had.  Alexander's in Cupertino has the best Wagyu in the bay but it is 4x the price of Prospect's.  People often assume that because it is Wagyu that it should be an amazing piece of meat so the term can be misused to pump up the menu.  One other thing, the waitress said that the Waygu was medium rare but I felt it was actually a rare.  Maybe that's a problem they face in order to get the exterior as crispy as they do... Anyway, I also applaud their use of interesting mushrooms found throughout the appetizer and sole dish as well.  \n\nI heard much about the desserts so ordered the \"brown cow\" but was dissapointed.  It was as if they overcomplicated the dessert to prove mastery in a highly critical food market.  It just had too much of everything - a root beer foam, some sort of light toffee crisp (you can tell was homemade), heavily whipped vanilla ice cream, a bland chocolate cake that needed an infusion of cocoa, etc., etc.,.  I suggest they get the basics of a dessert right first (just give me a really good chocolate cake people! Can you say Roy's?  Yes, I know but their chocolate is AMAZING.  Don't knock Roy's they know how to do fish and chocolate.) then you can go all Gordon Ramsay on me with the fancy dessert stuff (foam, crisps, nitrogen steam, fizz, etc).\n\nI agree with two other yelpers - Derek V and S P - who both had a problem with complexity.  I understand there is a need to show mad skills, innovation, and creativity in food, especially with such a public launch.. but it's so easy to go the way of Vegas instead of SF.\n\nThe interior is very trendy and sophisticated.  Some people are turned off by that scene but my husband and I enjoy it.  We love getting dressed up for a good meal, great wine, and a romantic but young and trendy atmosphere.  We'll probably come again.  The restaurant has been only open a week so I'm sure they'll work their stuff out since they're of Boulevard origins.  I'll update my review then to hopefully a four or five.", "author": "C C."}

We walked in at 8:30pm a little early for our reservation and we were asked to sit at the bar to wait. About 15-20 minutes later, the hostess came up to us and said \"The range hood was not working so they couldn't serve us food. The restaurants nearby are Boulevard, Epic Roasthouse or Waterbar.\" And that was the end of the conversation. I understand that things happen in the kitchen and they're not allowed to serve anymore. But the thing that surprised me was that this has happened to me before, but that time the restaurant called us before we left the house and offered to help make a reservation for us somewhere else. They were much more helpful. This time we were standing in the restaurant already and Prospect did not even offer to call the nearby restaurants to see if they could accomodate our large party.

We waited over an hour for our entrees, and got them separately as well...more cold food.  Each of the entrees consisted of 2 tablespoons of food and looked lost on the dinner plate.

The service was friendly and attentive, the space is inviting, with a wonderful large open bar in the middle of the room as you enter, and everything on the menu sounds fabulous.  Unfortunately the actual food did not quite live up to expectations.  Normally I don't complain about small portions, but obviously the effort here is to create a more informal, lower priced alternative to Boulevard and portion size is clearly one way they achieved this goal.  The tiny portion of black cod served as an appetizer was ok.  The cod had a slight fishy taste, but the tiny shrimp fritter was delicious.  The slightly larger main course of chicken was nowhere near as good as the chicken I had a few days ago at Lark Creek Tavern.  It was a bit dry and stringy, and the sausage patty it came with was undistinguished.  The best part of the dish was the amazing broccoli and the cheese grits, but one shouldn't have to single out broccoli as the outstanding feature of a dish.  The dessert menu also sounded amazing, but the vanilla cake with berries and sorbet was again nothing to rave about.  Drinks were fine.  Good water, excellent glass of Sancerre, and really good espresso.   All in all, I probably won't go back since there are so many alternatives in SF which offer a better cost/benefit analysis, but it would be interesting to come back in a year as they will definitely have to make some changes to the food if they want people to keep coming.", "author": "David T."}
