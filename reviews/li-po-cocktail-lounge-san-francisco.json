The mai tai, their specialty, was fantastic; the whiskey sour good but nothing special.

You basically walk in, order a Mai Tai, and then get the fuck outta here.  It's part of a series of bars that you must hit when you are a tourist.  I decided to become a tourist in San Francisco, the city I grew up in, for the first time in my life.  I must admit, it was a blast.  I could see how tourist could find this gotham city to be charming with that cold annoying air I grew up with and to this day, I must admit actually love.\n\nThis bar is rather special because it is an Anthony Bourdain haunt.  As you walk in, there are photos of him having a drink here.  It's not all that avante garde, but I will say it did have a unique vibe about it.\n\nIt's true San Francisco bravado at its worst.   Having lived in San Francisco from when I was 12 until I was 28 years old, I never once walked into this bar.  Back when I was bar hopping, it was the triangle, Yancys in lower sunset, Rat & the Raven on union and few other haunts in Noe Valley and then if we were really feeling tacky, the Peppermill in Daly City.\n\nFor tourists, I strongly recommend that you hit this and then work your way to North Beach with the night cap at Buena Vista for an Irish Coffee.", "author": "Tony U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-24", "description": "It was a lovely first-day-of-Fall, (9/12/2018) that my friend & I went out on a whim and decided to have an SF adventure, which started out in Chinatown.  After taking in some of the sights, sounds (and even smells) amidst the hustle and bustle to be expected on a Saturday at the famed indoor/outdoor marketplace where you find all sorts of art shops, Chinese eateries, fresh produce stands and probably everything and anything in between, we noticed across the street a very curious looking cave-like structure that seemed that it may have been closed as no one was seen entering, nor leaving.  \n\nOf course, that instantly brought out the inner curious cat I am and we immediately went over to check out the scene to see exactly what in the actual hell this place was.  When I describe the outside as a cave, I mean that.  Tucked between two gated-shut storefronts of some sort, it literally stood out as the exterior to me looked like it was designed to resemble an old stone entrance carved into a mountain.  As we approached, that was confirmed.  Mind you, we heard nothing inside from where we were standing at the entrance, we didn't see anything either entering or exiting, so we were slightly wary of what lay within.  I mean, it could've been a complete sh*thole, or something else... so what did we find within the bright red doors with golden trim?\n\nThere were so many people inside!  It was a dim-lit mecca of Asian decor, absolutely gorgeously ornate Chinese lanterns which adorned the ceilings and dragons on the walls which were painted in a rich, red & gold color scheme complete with an ornate shrine behind the bar area with several bamboo plants on either end mixed in with your typical light-up beer brand signs here and there, black scalloped with gold leafing wall accents as well as a small jukebox on the left side.  Nice & clean interior. \n Plenty of tables in house and even a larger lounge chill spot on the far wall available for you to pick whichever area called to you to be seated.  Bruno Mars was heard overhead \"This hit, that ice cold, Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold...\" The friendly bartender was the most adorable & sweet Asian lady who immediately greeted us and expertly created concoction after concoction at the bar.  \n\nOne of the very first things we noted when we walked in was none other than Anthony Bourdain had once popped in as there was a sign on the window with is photo!  How freaking cool is that?!  Had to research it to see more about it and confirmed 'tis true - as sighted in this article published in Miami New Times' entitled \"Anthony Bourdain's The Layover: I Left My Liver In San Francisco (A Recap)\", written by Laine Doss, 1/10/2012.\n\nI quote, \n'20 hours left. It gets ugly from here.\nMore drinking is in order, as Tony heads to Li Po Bar in Chinatown, where he downs a few lethal Mai Tai's and plays liar's dice (which is the same as liar's poker).\nTony is drunk. And cursing. We hear, \"holy shit these things are f**king lethal\" and \"I'm really glad I don't live in San Francisco because I would be f**king drinking here every night.\"'\n\nNow, if THAT doesn't instantly get you Chinese Mai Tai intrigued, you clearly don't have a pulse & you should probably seek medical assistance, asap. I, of course opted for one of them & my friend was encouraged by a friendly (& tipsy) patron who was seated next to us to try the Lucky Buddha Beer. \n\nThe Chinese Mai Tai went for $11 and was advertised all over the place as containing light and dark rum as well as Bacardi 151, a Chinese Liqueur (whatever the hell that is) & pineapple juice.  They had me at 151.  It was served partially blended and delivered just enough sweetness from the pineapple juice and a freaking KICK like no other Mai Tai I've ever been served.  I was an insta-fan over it!  If I stayed for another, I'm pretty sure I would've wanted yet another & I would've ended up dancing on the bar and belting out some cheesy karaoke song or would've found myself engaging in semi lewd behavior which would've ended me up in jail or on someone's lap.  Or both.  Needless to say, ORDER THIS!   \n\nThe Lucky Buddha Enlightened Beer came in the coolest emerald green beer bottle that literally had a smiling, joyful Buddha in 3-D on it!  My friend seemed to really like it and offered me a sip and it tasted like a very light & refreshing pale lager which was quite delicious.  I'm pretty sure my friend was feeling enlightened after finishing it.  Kinda surprised he didn't start changing \"Om\" and started levitating from his seat.  Another great find!\n\nBottom line:  It's the coolest, big-little bar packed to the hilt in gorgeous Chinese art where you can sit & chill and make friends with some of the usual's who frequent the place whilst getting shit-faced amidst your SF tourist playing!  It's a definite must, a funky little dive! I'd give it 4.5 stars, but I'm bumping it up to a full 5 since it was such a great accidental discovery!  \n\nGet your Li Po on!", "author": "Jeanie B."}

Welcome to Chinatown it where things can get you know a little bit bizzare. \n\nParking is street only which means there is no parking. This is one of the most pedestrian friendly cities in the world however, so there are lots of ways to get here that do not involve driving. \n\nAs I said earlier this local divey spot goes so far out past bizarre that it transcends the description. i mean just saying that this is an odd unique spot, doesn't even begin to cover what this dark, drink and art filled refuge from a prior era is. The lighting-what there is of it-is heavy on red lantern thingys. Once you've a drink and your eyes have adjusted a bit you start to notice things. Like the full temple size shrine to prince siddartha hidden-to the extent that you can hide something so large-behind a corner of the bar. The temple dragon on the ceiling. The so dark you can barely make them out mogul murals. The 1900's style friezes and cornices. The certification from the president annotating that the chinese mai tai's here are unique and copy written. The 1940's style beer ads on the way to the restroom, and the basement storage area that is the restroom itself, all of which look dirty even though they might not  actually be as grimy as they appear. Seating ranges from 1950's vinyl bar stools, to garage style table/chair combos to cozy little nooks, all of which have a non standard look. \n\nSo yeah all that with some of the best-and hardest hitting-chinese mai tai's evah? Yeah that's five stars right there. The beer selection is okay, and yeah they've a full range of spirits but really the go to drink here is the mai tai. It's made with Chinese whisky and it's magical. The service is of the don't ask don't tell style. Prices are on the low side-happy hour three dollar beer? Yes please! but if you are using a card it's a twenty dollar minimum, which is roughly two mai tai's, a happy hour beer or two and the tip. No biggie, but you better be sharing with  friend 'cause in this bar two mai tai's is a lot to handle.\n\n A solid chinatown dive bar experience any way you cut it.", "author": "Steven W."}

Keep in mind that these are completely two different establishments and two types of fun.\n\nI wasn't expecting much upon entering the premise. It's a discreet dive bar in the middle of a random Chinatown street, which is surprisingly calm at night. There wasn't much signage outside of the place except for a hand written sign denoting \"CHINESE Mai Tais\".\n\nWe entered and the crowd was mellow and sparse, but it was a Sunday afterall and who boozes on a Sunday?!?!?! Us.\n\nAlmost all of the patrons drank Mai Tais, how could you not? There was signage on the walls that highlighted the drink's ingredients although many of them were crossed off. I guess you can say this is a mystery concoction and you never know what you're going to get.\n\nThe decor was very stereotypical Chinese. There were dragons and the walls were gilded with chinese wallpaper - although there was a booth and the designs seemed more thai than chinese. \n\nThere was a middle aged chinese man manning the bar. We suspected that the random playlist filled with a mix of Top 40, hip hop, EDM, and alternative was his. Needless to say all of the songs were singable and recognizable. \n\nI had a surprisingly pleasant time here despite this place being everything that I wouldn't typically enjoy. First off, who orders mai tais at a bar nowadays unless you're at a tiki bar?! And I'm not sure what exactly makes THESE mai tais \"chinese\" but they tasted delicious and buzzy.

It is a fun walking tour of the touristy parts of town for my visitors. \n\nBut last night, I walked into the Li Po with three still-thirsty visiting friends, and pointed to the giant lantern, as I looked for a place for all of us to sit. The bartender lit in to me and told me to get the hell out and stop running tours in the bar. I said, \"Excuse me?!!\" So she just started yelling at me about coming in and not drinking--I mean literally, before we had a chance to all four get into the door! So I asked her if she thought I still wanted a drink after being greeted that way, and asked how the hell she knows what customers want--I mean seriously--you kind of have to stop and point out the charm, since while the Li PO is \"charming\", it kinda gives off a \"Shithole--RUN AWAY\" vibe when you first walk in.

Bar-hopping to Li Po, my coworkers and I could immediately sense that the location had a lot of historical background.  The decor seems very ancient but also has a lot of character to it.  We only tried the Chinese Mai Tai and grabbed a table in the back corner!  Although the bar does seem old, I'd say they were throwing some great R&B/Top 40s hits of the 00s.  This was awesome!  I'd give this a 3.5 stars just for the music.\n\nOverall, not a bad place to be in the wee hours of the night in Chinatown.  From my knowledge, there isn't that much to do in this area at night, so this could be it!  Also Anthony Bourdain was here, so at least it has some street cred?", "author": "Jana L."}

While I wouldn't say the Li Po Cocktail Lounge was anything like a true tiki bar, but it had a great dive bar feel to it.\n\nMe, being the tiki nerd that I am, I have gotten particular about how I like a Mai Tai.  If it contains orange juice, pineapple juice, grenadine, or coconut rum, it isn't a true Mai Tai in my opinion, and sometimes the combination of those things, make for a sickly, sweet tropical concoction. I'm sure there are some people out there that like that, but not me.  \n\nSo I had my reservations about a Chinese Mai Tai, but since I was there in Chinatown, I was going to have one, good or bad.  In actuality, the Chinese Mai Tai was not bad at all.  A bit on the sweet side, but not too much.  Whatever is in the Chinese liquor they add, helps balance out the drink.", "author": "Amanda W."}

The ambiance and decor recall a long-lost era when everything Chinatown was seen as being exotic and slightly seedy, if not outright sultry. Imagine smoke-filled rooms with suited, bow-tied businessmen sporting Clark Gable mustaches being served by svelte, immaculately coiffed Chinese ladies in form-fitting cheongsams.\n\nAlas, such an era is long gone, but Li Po manages to stick around. While the establishment just oozes history and an aura of glory days far in the past (even its website is one heck of a trip back to the Netscape/AltaVista/Lycos era of the internet!!!), these days it's pretty much a low-key dive bar that's known for its mai tais.\n\nThe mai tais are indeed good, plus they're cheap. This place is certainly worth a visit just for the conversation-starting throwback, like in a super low-key first date over drinks. Word to the wise, however: if you're sober enough to notice large bugs of a certain kind lurking in all the nooks and crannies of the walls and decor here, you might want to think twice about lingering too long.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I didn't like how sweet the chinese mai tai was, so I went with their tsingtao beer. I'm a beer gal, so I was happy chillin' with my beer. I heard that the mai tai was VERY strong. The only bartender was mixing a bunch of different rums on Lunar New Year's parade when we went out, and blended the drink like crazy so I'm not surprised.

If you don't immediately raise your hand, don't worry, you are not alone.  This is actually one of the better kept secrets on Grant Street.  (Tourists - Grant Street is what you think Chinatown is all about, although it's not.  Grant Street is souvenir shops, mediocre restaurants that REALLY try to pull you in, and basic consumerism.  I went to China and got a California license plate with my name on it.  ...sigh.  At least it was cheap.)  \n\nAlright, not every place is that.  Li Po is a (you know what's coming) Hidden Gem.  Maybe not so hidden since Mr. Bourdain stopped by and got lit.  Maybe having a few of the famous Chinese Mai Tai's was why he later went on to proclaim Sam's home of the \"Greatest Burger Ever!!!\"  (BTW, it is good, but Bourdain had some kind of goggles on ... not that there's anything wrong with that.)\n\nThe Mai Tai is pretty darn good.  Dark Rum, Light Rum, 151 (STRONG Rum), Secret Chinese Liquor and Pinneapple Juice.  Blend it.  Serve it in a plastic hurricane glass with no garnish.  It's tasty and strong.  And, I haven't found anything quite like it.  $9.  If you have two, you may not make the best decisions as the evening progresses.  Just a warning.  The rest of the place is sorta divey-shiek.  Not a lot of frills, but some cool decor and a good mix of folks from a range of different spots.  It's a little rough around the edges, but it is cool.  I'd probably go up to 5 stars if there was more than one good view of the TV and if they had a few decent beers on tap - bottles only for $4.50.

I think they're fun. I have been to Li Po a few times, and in my experience, the strength of the alcohol in their infamous drink depends on the bartender. The best one I ever had was on a week night, right after work, when it was pretty dead inside. The bartender was a lady, and the mai tais were strong. But my friends and I noticed that when an older man got behind the bar, the drinks were sweeter with less alcohol.

The bartender nabbed a drink from one of our party right after serving it. Bartender proceeded to defend himself though we weren't accusing him of doing anything intentional, just requesting he fix the error. The bouncer saw us complaining and after realizing we were normal, sober customers, who were just bewildered at horrible service, profusely apologized again and again. It was clear this wasn't his first time being forced to do damage control, and he was clearly uncomfortable with the situation. Minutes later, the bartender chose to taunt us about the incident unprovoked.\n\nLife is too short to deal with idiots. Rarely in this city, you find crappy service, and when it happens, it's great that you can just turn around and go one door over and know you'll have a great experience.

Actually, that's not really even true... I mean it might be. I really have no idea, but apparently at some point in time Anthony Bourdain stopped in here so this place is kind of a big deal as far as Chinese dives go. I'm not a fan of AB, so I could care less, but if Mandy Patinkin ever comes here and they put his pic on the wall I will upgrade this review so hard... you don't even know. \n\nThere's no food, so don't come here for that. You probably wouldn't want to eat here anyway. But there are some pretty b*tchin' Chinese Mai Tais ($9, and worth every red cent) that'll put you right to bed, despite their sugar content. For sure get this and then chase it with the Lucky Buddha beer (which really isn't that great but it combats the sweetness and it's just what you do here). \n\nThe music will be all the Ja Rule and Ashanti mash-ups that were hella cool at your freshman high school dance and it will be awesome. Never in a million years could I have imagined how flagrantly jubilant I'd feel hearing Nelly's 'Air Force Ones' in a  modern day public setting.\n\nThe crowd will be what you'd expect from a bar that plays multiple songs prominently featuring Ludacris in the year 2014... meaning, expect the unexpected. It's as mixed a bag of people as you'll ever find. All ages. All walks of life. All having the best and booziest time in recent memory. Super fun and super conducive to making friends (the guy who let me cut in at the bar to order my drink was actually a dead ringer for Mandy Patinkin, swoon). \n\nCash only, FYI.

Chick drinks aren't usually my thing, but I have to say, I wasn't expecting it to be good or to like it.  But I did.  \n\nAnd Amos, the charmer behind the bar, dealt with the motley crew of patrons  - one of whom continued shouting about how he broke the Mai Tai record of 12 by drinking 13 - admirably.  Professionally, with a smile and leaving everyone, even the drunk Englishmen with his new record, happier.  \n\nI will be back.

I honestly expected something to be really special about this place for it to have made it onto the Travel Channel, but I was rather disappointed.\n\nLi Po Cocktail Lounge has definitely become a tourist trap since Anthony Bourdain's visit in 2012. Just about every customer orders the Chinese Mai Tai (light rum, dark rum, Barcardi 151, Chinese liqueur, and pineapple juice). The bartenders seem to focus on making as many of these drinks as quickly as possible rather than friendly service.\n\nThe Chinese Mai Tai's are $9 each, cash only. They are really nothing special; they taste just like what they are, rum with some pineapple juice. Even though the rum flavor is present, they don't seem to be very strong in alcohol at all: this is a joke considering there are signs advertising just how strong they are.\n\nThe worst part about this place is the blaring outdated hip hop music. It just did not seem to fit the overall look of the place. It can also get really crowded and hard to walk through the bar. The clientele seem like the type to chug as many Mai Tai's as possible and let loose: there was a mini dance party in the center of the main floor of the bar. Not that anything is wrong with dance parties, it just did not seem to fit with what I expected out of the bar.", "author": "Lindsey D."}

The bartender knows me and she always remembers my order. I'm kinda bummed that they raised the price a dollar up from the original $9.00 though. The Chinese Mai tai consist of dark rum, light rum, 151 rum, Chinese liqueur, and pineapple juice all mixed together with ice in a blender. This drink is a creeper so watch out how many you consume. It's an awesome spot and they even have a cutty underground room full of sofas, a bar, and room to dance. If you're in Chinatown, you definitely need to check this place out now.

Buddha beer followed me that evening but it was all about the 'Chinese liqueur.' What?? Whatever's in that bottle broke the space/time continuum. I have no idea how long I was there. I might still be there. I had a deeper understanding of Trainspotting for having drank of the Chinese liqueur cup.

Nowadays, it's also become something of a tourist attraction in its own right due to the attention it has garnered since dive bars became trendy. That said, it's been here forever and however cheesy it is, however popular it becomes, it will always remain local and awesome. While Li Po lacks the underground status L'Amour Night Club had, it still impresses with those devilish mai-tais, the classic tiki cocktail based around rum and rum and some more rum. What's distinct here though is, they have been plying the mai-tai trade since circa 1997, making Li Po by far an early adopter of the tiki revival. \n\nSadly, more American, typical, pop/soul from the 1990s now than Canto-pop here, but still, fun times.", "author": "Mike W."}

While I absolutely love everything you produce, I hate you for ruining some really great spots for me.\n\nWhile I hit the bar with some friends, it was completely flooded with loud obnoxious guys and girls sandbagging their Mai Tai's.. which apparently the bar is famous for.  We plopped ourselves down by the bar and ordered a few to see what the hype was about.  Our bartender, who I can only describe as an Canotonese Tom Selleck, quietly went to work mixing our drinks.  Utter garbage, but in my defense, I don't drink anything sweet or fizzy when it comes to alcohol.  It either comes brown and aged or it doesn't go in my body.\n\nWhile admiring the mustache on our bartender ( I feel terrible that I don't remember his name ) I did my best to spark some conversation.  He was quick to brush me off, but since we were probably going to be there for a while, I decided to buy him a shot of \"Chinese Whiskey\".  He politely obliged and poured two shots of what I can only describe as tasting like Chinese medicine.. just burny gingseng and other roots.  It was disgusting, but it got him to talk.\n\nHe proceeded to be f'ing awesome company all night, pouring us shots after shots.  He basically explained how the mai tai has turned into some douchy hipster drink and how he was glad that I was ordering real drinks.  We continued drinking for the next few hours where I eventually got him to the point where he had to tap out or he wouldn't have been able to continue serving drinks.\n\nAll in all.. I love Li Po and I love that the bartender hates hipsters as much as I do.  Do yourself and don't bother dropping by if you're going for a mai tai.

Those Mai Tai's sure do come in like a wrecking ball, don't they!?\n\nDon't let those delicious, fruity and refreshing drinks trick you - they are packed full of Chinatown's finest rum. I learned that the hard way. \n\nLi Po used to allow for for small parties to rent out their small basement room. I attended a few birthday celebrations at Li Po before where the downstairs area was reserved - it was a nice little get away from the group of Mai Tai chasers upstairs. Apparently they don't offer the room anymore.. And when I asked about it, the woman I spoke to made it seem like this was common knowledge and I was ridiculous for asking. Missed a memo, perhaps?\n\nI have to say, the staff is never.. entirely friendly. Which is okay, their business is slowly being overrun by San Francisco's finest.

Cash-only is a really annoying way of screwing your customers just because you want to cheat taxes and avoid credit card surcharges. If you are going to play that game, share the wealth and have more reasonable prices on your must-try house drink that 95% of your patrons are obviously going to order.\n\n-----\n\nI deducted 1 star because it feels like a greedy cattle call; sit down, drink your overpriced mai tai, thanks. Nothing particularly bad, but this happens a lot when places get publicity; price often goes up and quality down for a specific in-demand item. The drink was good, but not on par with the price.

This place is located in the creepiest of empty dark streets. \n\nOn a Sunday night this place is empty.\n\nA thin, Chinese, well postured bartender in his 60s hooked us up with the house special...the Chinese Mai Tai. \n\nWhat else would you order here?\n\nAll the ingredients are predictable except for the Chinese whisky. \n\nI asked him what was inside of Chinese whisky.\n\n\"Herbs...it is healthy,\" he said. \n\nHe looked pretty good for 60, so I tried one with my wife.\n\nAfter a large dose of this I was mentally transported back to Shanghai (although I have never been there). \n\nI think this was at the drink they used to subdue unsuspecting people to passing out and then shipping them to China the next day from the underground dungeon. \n\nI'm not sure about the \"healthy' part, but this is a pretty easy way to get all bus'.\n\n\"I'll have another!\"", "author": "Michael M."}

They explained that it was one of Chinatown's many hole in the wall gems, with great service and a friendly atmosphere. This is a dive bar with some character and friendly bartenders. One that I definitely enjoyed my time at and would love to go back again. \n\nLocated in the middle of the block, you can't miss this bar because of its unique design and style. The exterior looks like the entrance of a cave, which I thought was a pretty cool design. When we arrived we had two bartenders. The first bartender I didn't get his name, but he was very down to earth and made us feel welcomed from the moment we stepped inside of the bar. The second bartender was an older gentleman named Peter. Peter was great and had the spunk and vibe of a 21-year-old. Cracking jokes and even challenging us to see sports trivia. He clearly knew a lot about the liquors he was serving and even gave us a brief history of each one of the drinks we were interested in.\n\nThe two popular drinks served there are the mai tais (which can sneak up on you if you're not careful) and the Chinese whiskey that is aged and comes in a really unique and awesome looking bottle. The layout of the bar is pretty simple and it wraps around to the back to revile bench seating & booths for larger parties. The Decour however is cool. It's a combination of Chinese artifacts and historical items combined with a flat flatscreen TV to watch sporting events on. However the bar is pretty dark and you can lose all track of time if you're not careful. Also because it's in Chinatown is strictly CASH ONLY, that means no credit cards, no debit cards are excepted there. Another issue that I had with the bar is the fact that they don't serve any meals there. So it's strictly only for drinking. Finally the fact that the back area is for seating bigger parties can me seen as a flaw in my eyes. Because if they replaced the booths with a pool table, it would make things there even more fun In-between drinks.", "author": "Donald W."}

Drinking one of these certainly gave me a certain hightened sense, knowing that in an another drink or two I would be on my way. Did it taste \"lethal\"? Not at all.\n\nThe difference here is that they incorporate a Chinese Liqueur into it (I don't remember what the name was). While the bartendress decribed it as tasting like gasoline, I certainly wouldn't describe it that way. She poured us a sample on its own to taste what it was like, and as best I can remember it was like vodka but slightly sweeter and fruitier. \n\nBut overall, a REALLY tasty mai tai that I would come back for if I'm in the area.\n\nAs far as the place itself, it's definition of what a bar is and should be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-04", "description": "From the outside, this place is somewhere nondescript - not that it's plain or blank on the outside, but it's got a design and decor that you would pretty much expect to find in Chinatown.  There's a sign outside that reads out the name, but otherwise, you can't really tell what lies beyond the doors until you actually get inside.\n\nOnce you do cross that threshold though, you find yourself in the middle of what you would imagine a typical Chinatown dive bar would look like.  Kind of dirty, yet homely sort of feel, relatively cheap drinks, Chinese alcohol galore, Tsingtao in hand, and a Buddha statue behind the bar.  Yup, that's right...a Buddha statue hanging out behind the bar, watching you as you order yet another round of drinks.\n\nThe bar definitely has an aged look and feel, with the worn vinyl booths, and the aged appearance of the walls.  Obviously, the place has been around for a number of years, like the rest of Chinatown, and you kind of wonder what kind of characters and people this place has seen pass through after all these years.  There's a dimly lit, narrow little booth that's tucked into the wall towards the back, and you start to think of the types of people that might have made that their regular table.  \n\nAwesome little place in Chinatown to grab a few drinks, especially if you're in the mood to try your hand with something like Chinese whiskey.  I had a fun night chilling with friends, enjoying a few rounds, playing cards, and having a good time.  The Chinese Mai Tai seems like their specialty, and one of my friends really enjoyed hers.  Even if you're a guy and you're curious, go ahead and order it...the Buddha statue won't judge.", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-08", "description": "After searching for a good dive bar in San Fran, I read several reviews telling me I had to try LiPo. Everyone suggested the Mai Tai and the Chinese whiskey. \n\nI wandered through Chinatown passing 30 Asians crammed into a small store scratching off scratchers like the world was about to end. I knew I must be close. I finally found the place (after challenging a small Chinese man to a scratch off) and ordered a Mai Tai and a shot of whiskey. The prices were decent, $6 for the whiskey and $9 for the Mai Tai. My friend and I conversed with the bartender, Jackie, about opium and happy endings (isn't that what you are supposed to talk about?). She was very friendly and even gave us a free shot of Chinese liquor, which tasted like shit. \n\nThe bathroom in this place is downstairs and is pretty creepy. I am fairly sure there is a another hidden room right next to it where they have bands sometimes. \n\nEverything was going good at the bar and I was on my way to a 5 star review. However, things took a turn for the worse when we paid our bill. They take cash only so we gave the bartender $60 for $42 worth of drinks. We received $12 back in change. Some may think it was an honest mistake. But, after speaking with Jackie about it, I am 99.4% sure she tried to play an ancient Chinese trick on us. You know the one where her English and math skills all of a sudden deteriorate into 4 year old level when money is involved. I asked her for the rest of the change and her reply was, \"oooooooh my math no good.\" Now, this may sound stereotypical, but I have never met an Asian who is bad at math. I mean, she even had a calculator out. \n\nAnyways, if you are in Chinatown and want a good Mai Tai, stop in. The drinks were really good and the vibe is cool. Just make sure you don't fall for the ancient Chinese secret.", "author": "Jared M."}

After all the shops close, you can pretty much park right outside.  The bartenders are pretty laid back and make decent drinks (a little overpriced).

If you're tired of listening to the mainstream hiphop/rap/club banger/house music at the typical clubs, PLEASE COME TRY THIS PLACE OUT.

Initially, it tastes like straight pineapple juice but once you get to the middle of the drink, you taste a little bit of the alcohol. All in all, the taste isn't as strong but you  feel the effects of it fairly shortly. 3 of those and that should suffice for the evening. As for the bar itself, it's located in the heart of Chinatown but if you looked at the clientele on a Friday night, it definitely did not feel like a Chinatown bar.

I don't know what it was about the place, but I immediately felt at home. It reminded me of Time Out or Yucca in Tempe.\n\nBartender was a pleasant young lady who didn't seem too chatty, but was quick to start up the jukebox when two more couples wandered in (I found it touching and mildly amusing that she chose \"Stayin' Alive,\" \"Hotel California\" and then a Whitney Houston jam - like she thought that's what us white folk/tourists might enjoy).\n\nI was also mildly amused to see that the bottles on display behind the bar were conveniently marked with a Magic Marker with their price for a drink (simply \"8\" or \"6\" or \"5\"). Pretty smart, really - every bar should do that.\n\nThe bartender at Bliss Bar mentioned that this place also hosts small shows in their basement. I got a glimpse of this area when I ventured down the steep steps to the bathroom (scary bathroom winner, with it's dim lighting that becomes near-darkness when you shut the stall door and cheap, tissue-piece-style paper like your elementary school had...it's also what they had for paper towels too: wha?).

Our bartender, Amos, eyeballed all the ingredients & poured two perfectly measured glasses with nary a drop left to waste. Which was good because the house special's fame is well earned.

Inside, the ceiling and walls are painted with historical murals and alphabetical motifs. Traditional Chinese lanterns hang and glow overhead, including one so immense in size that you could hide inside it like a cocoon. A buddha statue smiles mysteriously in an altar behind the bar. The room snakes around the corner, revealing dingy leather booths. And a staircase curls down to the basement, where dank bathrooms -- and, on some nights, a concrete storage room where punk bands blare away in amateur abandon -- wait with dilapidated patience for your inevitable visit.\n\nBut the best thing about Li Po, in my opinion, is that it's named after a poet. At a time when so many new lounges are opening with meaningless, glamour-sucking titles like \"Glow\" or \"Suave\" or \"Swank,\"  this old cocktail cave's honoring of a man who sought wisdom over wealth makes me happy. Besides, Li Po was also an infamous lover of alcohol -- a perfect role model for any aspiring bar owner.\n\nAnd so I guess I'll complete this review with the words of Li Po himself:\n\nAmong flowers with a pot of liquor;\nI pour alone but with no friend at hand;\nSo I lift the cup to invite the shining moon;\nAlong with my shadow, a fellowship of three.", "author": "John G."}

Thankfully the FUNK refers to an illmatic hip-hop soundtrack rather than odoriferous aire.\n\nSet in the low-ceiling'd basement with no windows and a solitaire electric-fan struggling to cool the room, SweaterFunk felt like one of those \"below the radar\" gigs: once a month on the last Sunday(?), an anti-\"ultralounge\" decor, music more rhythm than rhyme, and a patronage/vibe that brings all its heart to the dancefloor. 30 minutes of a hyped dancefloor in a stifling hot room, walking out into the deserted Chinatown night was a refreshing breath of air.\n\nWe didn't stay very long (it being the end of a long, lush Pride weekend), but its definitely on my list of \"must\" for hip-hop, dance, and good vibes...\n_____________________________________\nI'm very self-conscious, but it was so hot in there, even I rocked down to a tanktop. \n*farmer tan shame*", "author": "Mikey U."}

Here's a Tsingtao toast to fate's crafty ways!\n\nA year ago, a random night of barhopping in North Beach and Chinatown lead me to discover Li Po, a bar that my Grandfather was once part owner of--only my Dad had forgotten to tell me! \"What?\" you say. Exactly my point! Life never ceases to amaze me. Anyhow, let me paint a figurative picture for you, ala 80's Golden Girls style...\n\nPicture it. San Francisco, 1939. The Chinatown nightclubs had officially taken off with all its glamour and zest for living it up! We're talking hot babes in skimpy outfits and tap dance shoes, men in dapper suits, lots of drinking, gambling, and of course right in the middle of it all, was my Grandfather. He was quite the Ladies' Man, so I'm told. Sort of a Chinese baller from a bygone era. He was such a frequent customer at Li Po that he decided to buy into the whole scene.\n\nWalking though the arched rock facade of the doorway, it is more than easy to imagine what it must have been like. It hardly seems like a moment has past in its deep-seated red and gold flecked existence. I'm sure that many a big gambling games have gone down in the darkened booths that are so well hidden in the back. Perhaps it was even frequented by rebel gangs like The Tong, back in the day. The dimly lit Chinese lanterns hide a lot of history--who knows what else my Dad \"forgot\" to tell me! \n\nOnce a dive bar, always a dive bar! These days, Li Po's basement holds Free Sunday 80s Funk shows and also a bit of Punk and Rock. The relic of a bar upstairs is an intriguing mix of older Chinese men, hipsters and bar hoppers with 2 things in common: a yen for good, strong drinks and a place with character. You don't have to go very far inside to realize this is the Real Thing. From the timeworn wraparound bar to the gold alter quietly swirling incense into the air, everything about their decor says \"Authentic.\"\n\nDon't be afraid to take a dive into a little history with a bar that doesn't try to be \"Chinese themed.\" It just IS!", "author": "Kira R."}

The atmosphere, decor (and sadly bathrooms) are exactly what you'd expect in a dive bar. For the full Chinatown experience drink their mai thais (3 kinds of whiskey including 151!) and some Chinese whiskey, which tastes like jager and bourbon mixed together. I noticed the price of the mai thais varied depending on who ordered and which bartender we got. Even the signs on the bar conflicted, some said $9, some said $10. \n\nOn my first visit I didn't realize there was a back area with booths, which is great if you're there with a few friends. You will probably make some new ones too, like the gaggle of gasians screaming \"TWINSIES\" who made me take a picture with them because we were all wearing red plaid shirts.

My wife and I vacationed in San Francisco together for the first time and we decided to explore the wonderful expanses of the city. We walked and trekked through neighborhood after neighborhood, explored many wonderful small business, and ate at some great establishments. We tirelessly walked up and down steep hill after steep hill, and we enjoyed a couple rides on San Francisco's various forms of public transportation. But all of this was done in the drenching San Francisco rain and chilly weather. Chinatown was one of the last spots on our self-guided tour of San Francisco and needless to say after a day of walking through the rain and in the cold we were a bit tired and feigning for a stiff drink and a place to rest our weary feet. We of course Yelped a place in the area and we found Li Po lounge. We read that not only had Anthony Bourdain visited Li Po Cocktail lounge but we also discovered that they were known to have great Mai Tai's. Score and Double Score! So we waltzed ourselves into Li Po and sat down at the end of the bar. We were greeted with a smile and a warm welcome by a young energetic bartender. Now there were only a few patrons in the bar at the time we went but the bartender was one of the nicest guys we met in San Francisco. He told of stories of his family, his time living in states, he talked sports, politics, religion, and pretty much whatever topic came to mind. So in the time it took us to enjoy one incredibly strong and legendary Mai Tai, we were graced with great conversation, and much needed rest. By the time we left we were dry, relaxed, and functionally intoxicated.

There's a pretty decent sized flat screen that they usually play sports on.\n\nProbably the thing that brings me back every time is the staff. There's the presumable owner who's a pretty old Chinese guy who's either doing something in some back room, or playing free games on the the machines. The bar is staffed with only Chinese women who can only be summed up by the word \"cougars\". They dress moderately provocative and will really be friendly in order to get a good tip. They're very funny and if you have a group all drinking and tipping they'll credit you some free songs on the machine.\n\nAll in all it's a really fun dive to hit whenever you're even remotely close to Chinatown. Plus it's great to hit right before or right after Kan's for some cheap dim sum.", "author": "Mike N."}

We ordered a round and he basically threw a mixture of like 5 or 6 liquors into that blender, including 151 and some chinese liquor in a ceramic jug that looked like it had to be some kind of home-brewed moonshine.  plus pineapple juice.  Sure enough that was a delicious--and incredibly strong--little blended cocktail.  I don't think I had ever had a mai tai before that so I can't say if it was the best in the City, but I definitely was satisfied.

Kind of like a high school party in somebody's parents' basement. I think pretty much anybody can play there, you just have to put your band on a list or something.

Lanterns, Chinese Gods, protection and hope you get rich symbols all about.  And my people love golds and reds, so expect a lot of those colors in here.  I say stick with beers and shots here, cuz the bartenders, who look like a dad and daughter duo, aren't very good at mixed drinks.  In front is the bar area, with three booths to sit in the back.  There's an upstairs that's chained off, but look, a basement area.  Besides the typical nasty bathrooms down there, is an area where bands play gigs here.  No ventilation down here, barely any lighting with random couches (that Salvation Army probably wouldn't take) and coffee tables.  Went to a punk rock show and I can guarantee, it smelled like a boys locker room down here.  This place looks like the carpet hasn't been maintained since it was first installed, but hey, my people are cheap.  LOL!  Surprised that the crowd was an assorted bunch, but man, my ghetto redneck Chinese peeps were here too.  They sure were loud, cussing, bad fashion and definitely FOBs, playing dice games at the bar.  It makes me want to cringe just thinking of it.  Overall, its a cool spot to just grab a drink, admire the decor, chat up to an hour or two, but that's it.
