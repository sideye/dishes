We didn't plan on dining here, but we were taking a leisurely stroll on the Embarcadero just as the sun was starting to set on a quiet Monday evening. Just as we approached the absolute thick of the tourist zone, Maggie said she was feeling peckish. Oh dear, Fisherman's Wharf was the last place I really wanted to be as I expected to confront exorbitant prices and annoying tourists.\n\nBut then I suddenly remembered a recent episode of \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" where one of the guests, not an old-timer but a relatively young woman, raved about the freshness of the Dungeness crab and the reliability of the service. I've never been here. NEVER. Neither had Maggie. Do we steel ourselves for the height of culinary commercialism and give it a try? It was early enough in the evening that hardly anyone was dining yet, and we were able to snag a table next to one of the huge bayside windows. A band of boisterous French tourists already monopolized the shared binoculars the restaurant provides to take in the panoramic views.\n\nAh, the French. Good thing I'm a local. Sure, we saw the sizzling iron skillets go by, but there was no room for garlic butter for me. However, I caved when the complimentary crusty sourdough loaf arrived with chunks of ice-cold butter (photo: http://bit.ly/2ylkDyQ). Yeah, I took a slice. Sue me. We decided to share an appetizer, the $12.99 Toy Box Tomato, Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta drizzled with a balsamic vinaigrette and served with a mound of burrata and s couple of toasted baguette slices that needed to be quickly replenished (photo: http://bit.ly/2PG65R1). No surprise the fresh burrata made the dish. We then went our separate ways with our respective salads.\n\nMaggie ordered the $23.98 Crab Caesar where their traditional housemade dressing takes center stage over the chopped Romaine hearts topped with seasoned croutons, shaved grana, and fresh crabmeat (photo: http://bit.ly/2PDUDFf). She was pleased with her selection. I decided on the $27.98 Louie with Crab which arranged iceberg lettuce, avocado slices, black olives, halved cherry tomatoes, and a sliced hard-boiled egg on an oblong platter. The Louie dressing was served on the side, a mix of mayo, cocktail sauce, lemon juice, and pickle relish (photo: http://bit.ly/2EuLw8Z). It was definitely satisfying, though the total price tag for dinner reminded me we were on the Wharf. Still, our server was extremely attentive, and the French eventually retreated.\n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars...fresh crab was nice and the execution as well...but ah, those tourist targeted prices were hard to stomach\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...quite a huge standalone building with great views and it looks like it's been renovated recently \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...really stellar server deserves praise\nTOTAL - 4 stars...barely a 4 though keep in mind that Fisherman's Wharf brings its own set of lowered expectations\n\nRELATED - Looking for other sights and bites on the Wharf or in the Marina?

He has a very fond memory of this place, because this was the place where he had his first crab in San Francisco on his business trip 26 years ago. I flew him over from Seattle for his birthday, and made a reservation to have dinner with him and my aunt's family. There were two sizes available for the crab bisque; cup or a bowl. We ordered the crab bisque for the bowl size. The bisque came out in a bread bowl, which I suppose is by default. My aunt asked if it was possible to have the bisque in a ceramic bowl instead of the bread bowl. The server was a very young man; perhaps having a very bad day; got extremely upset at her. It seemed that he misunderstood her preference request as if he had been told he made a mistake. He started yelling at her that he got the order right, and threw down the plates and dishes very loudly on the table. His behavior got attentions of several tables around us and interrupted their meals. Another server, who seemed more experienced, came by and told the young man to just pour the bisque in a ceramic bowl and bring it back. The young man  came by later, and again put down the bowl very loudly on the table and left. For rest of the evening, we felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome at the restaurant. We didn't even eat the bisque, because after seeing his behavior, it would not have been a surprise if he spit in our bisque. It really was difficult to enjoy our time there, and completely ruined my father's birthday dinner. My plan was to bring him or my friends when they visit me in San Francisco. However, I do not think I will ever be returning here again.", "author": "Lisa O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-22", "description": "This restaurant was featured on Check, Please! Bay Area and decided to check it out for dinner since I was in the area. I made a reservation on OpenTable and all times were available, and I encountered no wait at 8pm on a Friday night. We were seated promptly and our server greeted us with bread and butter shortly after.\n\nGiven the higher prices on entrees, we decided to split a few smaller items: crab chowder, crab fondue with toasts, and a sizzling platter of mussels and shrimp. Of the three items, I enjoyed the mussels and shrimp the most. There was a generous amount of mussels and about 12 shrimp. They were seasoned and had a strong lemony taste to them. I was not as impressed by the chowder or fondue, though. The crab got lost in the broth or cheese/spinach dip, when it should be the main attraction. The soup had a minestrone/split pea quality to it that did not mesh with the crab. The crab fondue was full of cheese and spinach, but it was not creamy in texture and lacked seasoning. I would avoid those items. I think to really enjoy crab here, you should order it by the pound or in a sizzling platter. \n\nFor the high prices (prime location aside), I was expecting much better food. You're better off getting chowder and calamari at the stands outside, or going to Boudin Bistro or Alioto's for a sit-down dinner.", "author": "Edwina D."}

We brought my wife's sister and her husband to the Wharf for the day.  After a terrific harbor cruise we were hungry and came here.  I was expecting to have to wait but we were pleasantly greeted and shown to a window table.  We had great view of the Bay and Alcatraz.  \n\nEveryone always says the restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf are pricey.  Well of course they are but then again it's not a fast food chain!.. The Wharf is one of San Francisco's main attractions, rents are high and the food is terrific so when tourists flock to a place it's not going to be cheap.  Personally I felt the prices were reasonable and the quality of food is very good.\n\nWe had a terrific waiter who was attentive but not intrusive.  I had the Crab Chowder which was good with a creamy broth and the crab was shredded, I would have preferred it to be chunky.  Others had a Crab Enchilada, a Louie with crab and shrimp and a caesar salad.  We shared a delicious plate of calamari as well.\n\nThe only complaint I had was that our bus person needs a bit of customer service training.  She just reached in front of you to clear a dish  and clanked the dishes so hard I thought they would break.\n\nYes I'll go back here as the food was good and you can't beat the Bay views.", "author": "Russ V."}

Since we stayed so close to fisherman's wharf so this was a convenient choice of restaurant. This restaurant and bar on the water is very open and bright with nice ocean and Alcatraz views. \n\nHubby and I had a beer and mermaid Mary at the bar, the drinks were reasonably priced. When our entire family arrived we were seated at a window table, the binoculars at window seatings came in very handy to look out and see even clearer.\n\nThe menu was big with mostly seafood items, they were recipes too. We decided on dozen oysters, clam chowder, 2 lbs up whole roasted crab, lemon butter garlic caper way wild halibut and sea bass, also strawberry sundae as dessert. The food was hit and miss, crab was fantastic that was so fresh and meaty. Halibut was a bit hard and dry, sea bass was better, crab melt was great, chowder was not good, desert was yummy. Our server forgot to give us basket of bread! He wasn't attentive enough either. Instead the bus girl was very attentive and took care of us even more than our actual server! But the seafood prices seemed to be just a bit cheaper than LA especially the oysters. \n\nFood was good mostly but the service was lacking, I wanted to give it three stars but I really liked the whole crab! Would we come back here next time? Probably not!", "author": "Mimi L."}

The menu has pictures and ingredient list to accompany each dish, so you really know what you're ordering. The paper bibs are also a nice and much appreciated touch. You will need the bib if you're ordering crab (and you should be ordering it here). We shared this plate \"losta crab\" between the two of us; it was some of the best crab we've tasted, and the presentation was on point.

We HAD to order the beignets again (definitely try the creme that comes with it, it adds a little bit of sweetness that doesn't overpower at all)! \n\nYou would think that the fish combo would be a little more extra because you are getting more than one seafood option, but hey, I'll take the $9.99 and try a little bit of everything. \n\nHad to rate 3.5/5 because the first time they total missed our order as they were calling every number but ours and we only ordered beignets. Also, there was so much trash every where. We came on Memorial Day, it was hectic I'm sure, I'll give them that, but there should be no excuse for missing our order that was so simple.", "author": "Jessica S."}

I know this, but I took a chance and... well. Everyone is right. \n\nWe chose the Franciscan over other options because of the view and the menu. We wanted crab, and somewhere nice to sit and look at the water. \n\nThis place does in fact have an amazing view. We were seated promptly at a table with a bay view, and we really enjoyed the view. \n\nSadly, that is all that was enjoyable besides the bread. The bread was good; crusty on the outside and soft inside. \n\nTwo of our party did the Prixe Fixe menu. One selected the chowder, one the house salad. Both were alright, but not worth the price tag. We both went with the Dungeness crab legs in their 'special' garlic sauce. \n\nNever in my life have I had crab legs that were so brittle to deal with. The shell literally broke into shards, flaked and cracked away from the meat... the meat that was overcooked, dry, rubbery, and flavorless. Add to that the bizarre flavorless oil smeared all over the thing, and it was quite an unpleasant dining experience. \n\nWhy? I'll never know. A place like this should 100% be able to cook crab appropriately. I feel like we would have been better ofd at Joe's Crabshack. \n\nDessert came with this. It was described as a house made vanilla custard ice cream. It was served in a drinking glass, and it tasted like McDonald's soft serve.\n\nDon't let them view talk you into eating here, kids. Your $ is surely better spent elsewhere.", "author": "Ashley P."}

I tried eating here months ago, but the wait was too long so we left.\n\nToday we came for lunch. We were seated at a window, where there were binoculars on a chain I used to see Alcatraz, ferry boats in the water, and tourists in line for the bay cruise.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, sourdough bread and butter appeared at our table. I knew not to fill up on bread given all the seafood I intended to eat.\n\nWe were really tempted to have chowder, but it would have been really filling. So we had some appetizers instead. But which one? I narrowed it down to the crab cakes, the octopus, or the squid. The portion of squid looked a little large, and I was concerned the octopus was raw. So we had the crab cakes. And my cousin ordered the prosciutto di san daniele.\n\nThe we ordered the crab enchiladas and the crab sandwich melt. See a trend here?\n\nThe crab cakes were the pinnacle of our meal. Large and meaty, with no fillers. Seasoned perfectly, outstanding! The prosciutto was tasty, but didn't knock my socks off.\n\nThe crab sandwich melts were a little deceiving. Half the huge platter was covered by three baguette-sized sandwiches, the other half was full of grilled vegetables. Although the sandwiches were small, they were tasty and meaty. Just excellent. I also liked the grilled corn and potatoes.\n\nThe crab enchiladas were pretty good.

The first red flag was when I looked on Open Table and saw virtually all reservations were open.  However, when I called the lady at the front told me it was busy and at least a 15-20 minute wait.  When we arrived at our reserved time, we still had to wait.  She seemed completely overwhelmed and flustered to say the least.  It was a crowded restaurant and groups of people were standing or walking around.  \n\nThe highlight of the night was their service.  They were attentive, friendly and quick.  I have nothing but great things to say about that.  The food on the other hand... not so great.  \n\nI picked the prix fixe meal and I'll state that it was lackluster.  To start off, the clam chowder was not good.  If you're expecting something like Boudin's, this is not it.  It was thin in texture as opposed to creamy and tasted a little on the tangy/sour side.  I read plenty of reviews that raved about the crab enchiladas... again, it was disappointing to say the least.  It was mushy because of the flour tortilla and sauce and they stuffed lettuce inside with the crab.  The actual crab portion was good, just not with the rest of the dish.  My daughter's chicken fettuccine was not up to par either.  It tasted worst than pasta roni.  \n\nThe saviors for the evening were the mashed potatoes as a side dish and the vanilla ice cream dessert.  I'd say stick to the crab here...", "author": "Quynh D."}

Prices are a bit high compared to other options, but the A+ service, cleanliness, food, and retro decor definitely make up for the price.\n\nI ordered the Crab Chowder instead of clam & was very satisfied. Sourdough bread is served at every table and because it's soooo warm and fluffy, the waiters already expect to bring a second serving to the table.\n\nI'd recommend the Dungeness crab sliders because even the side of potatoes are special. 3 sliders are served but with the avocado, thick pieces of crab, sourdough bread served before hand, you're sure to leave feeling full.  The calamari tasted pretty average compared to everything else we ordered.\n\nHappy with my last minute Fisherman's Wharf restaurant pick & would definitely come back here.", "author": "Karla M."}

We had to not only ask our server to wipe down the dirty tables and seats but then we have to show them where the dirt was. And as we look on the floor if we could see the trend of tables and seats having been to swipe on to the floor and in the mess left there.\n\n\nCommentary\n\nSeated on the shores of San Francisco with the picturesque view of Alcatraz is the Franciscan restaurant. The restaurant environment seems as busy as the city streets themselves as the lack of abundance of servers makes it understandable why it takes so long to get serviced as needed in this restaurant. I will say the food will arrive, the food will be absolutely fresh, and you will enjoy the flavors. The recipe is in the mini you are a nice touch because if you do like what you had you can see exactly how it was me except for the sink with garlic sauce they don't give that recipe away. My wife thoroughly enjoy the crab and I absolutely adore the garlic noodles. She cannot stop speaking about them.She says they are rich and flavorful and the pasta was cooked just right.\n\nI Partake in the clam chowder myself. I thought the clam chowder had a generally good flavor, it left something to be desired. The lack of clam and the lack of flavor Made it a rather basic experience. I will deathly have to continue to walk the pier in search of clam chowder worthy of the name.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is the type of restaurant you go to so that when others ask you if you've been there before you can tell them you've been there and have a conversation. The view in and of itself is actually what is made this restaurant worth the journey to me and of course the company of my beautiful wife! \n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't come back and dine here again, I'm just saying that it is a rather mediocre experience in my eyes.", "author": "Sj B."}

The clam chowder was a little different from what I was expecting, it was good, just had a different taste from most clam chowders I've had before (I am from the east coast so maybe they make it differently where I'm from). The crab legs were okay. I had never had dungeness legs before. The crab legs themselves were good but it was very messy to eat because the butter mixture is placed on top of the crab legs on the plate instead of to the side. Crab legs are pretty messy to begin with so this didn't really help the situation. I'm not sure that the butter on the outside of the shell does anything for taste, but then again I'm not a chef.

Beautifully crafted menus illustrate their items and the decor is classy. The food was pretty good but it didn't make my top list of seafood restaurants. \n\n[The restaurant & service] \nArriving at the restaurant, watch your step as you ascend the stairs into a beautifully decorated space with large windows (lots of natural lighting), white table cloths, and a fresh crab display. Since my group was a party of 10 people including a toddler, we were put more towards the restroom area where it was more spacious and out of the way. Menus were handed and drink orders were taken. Service was on top of things, they even brought out complimentary bread and amazing butter. They had the freshest and most creamy butter that I have ever tasted! \n\n[The food] \nThe food was tasty but nothing special that exploded my tastebuds or anything. \n\n-appetizer // complimentary bread with butter // I LOVED that butter, but man did that bread make my jaw hurt. It was tasty but as a person who wears retainers at night to keep their teeth straight, this one definitely made my teeth crooked for the night haha....\n\n-starter soup // crab chowder in a sourdough bread bowl // 15.95 // Decided to YOLO and go with the bread bowl since there was only a 3.00 difference between the cup and bread bowl. The crab chowder has a different base than the clam chowder, so do not be fooled. It's still good but from everyone's reaction, the clam chowder was the real winner. \n\n-entree // wild halibut in ciopinno sauce // 32.95 // Overall a tasty dish, with tiny quinoa looking pasta, veggies, a generous chunk of halibut and the cioppino sauce. My only downfall was that the cioppino sauce was not as good as other places that I've been to around the wharf area. It was missing something and tasted more of marinara or canned stewed tomatoes. \n\nOverall, this restaurant has a nice ambiance and is appealing to the eye, however there was just a few flavor components missing in the food for me to truly feel like it was worth the amount of money spent. \n\nALSO, please don't forget to get your car tickets validated if you parked in the lots around fishermen's wharf.

When I return, I want to go earlier in the day to have the full experience. Also, the free parking (with validation) for two hours was a plus.", "author": "Chloe O."}

Everyone I knew that has visited San Francisco told me 1 million times that I have to go to the wharf to get the best food in town. After a quick walk-through of the old arcade we stumbled upon the Franciscan crab restaurant. We ordered the calamari and fries basket and a couple of beers to boot. It was super cool while we are waiting for food there was a group of break dancers dancing just upfront that kept us entertained. The food came out quickly. I snapped a quick photo and it was time to dig in. I took my first bite and oh no!!! It was super cold and not like it can be warmed up cold but like it's been sitting out all day in a ice chest. I couldn't figure it out how could something that's been deep-fried be cold. The only logical explanation  is that it may not be as fresh as I was hoping. Maybe it was an off day maybe it's just a tourist attraction that is lost sight of their quality but either way I certainly won't be back. \n\nThere is a silver lining to the story. I did happen upon one of my most favorite beers I have ever had in my entire life. It's called anchor steam and I will be looking everywhere to find this at my local store.", "author": "Eric S."}

It's this massive ship inspired structure with these huge windows, so guests are treated to a panoramic view of San Francisco Bay. That being said, this place gets pretty busy - lots of tourists. Thankfully we had a reservation, and were seated right away in a nice little booth facing the water. \n\nEverything on the menu looked good, so it took us awhile to figure out what to get. We ended up with the crab & smoked salmon bellini, the sea bass in a lemon butter garlic caper sauce, and the seafood fettuccine. The sea bass was a tiny bit over cooked, but it was nothing to complain about as it was still absolutely scrumptious. The pasta was made perfectly, and the bellini appetizer was light yet satisfying. We were planning on getting dessert, but we were so full, we had to pass. We'll definitely be back though.\n\nTip: Incorporate the Embarcadero traffic into your travel time. \nGood news: They validate parking for the first 2 hours and there's a lot right in front of the restaurant.", "author": "Mica G."}

The place has high windows and neon lights in the front. It has a great view of the bay and street lights of the Embarcadero. \n\nWe ordered the octopus carpaccio, calamari, some raw oysters, and crab fondue. Although I didn't try the fondue, it looked creamy and delicious. It was my first time having octopus carpaccio and it was pleasant. I wasn't a fan of the texture though. The oysters were perfect! The calamari was slightly spicy which made it different from other places. \n\nI ordered the crab louie salad which was larger than I thought from the picture. The crab was generous and the olives, tomatoes, boiled eggs, and avocado were all great additions. For dessert I tried the frozen custard which was crazy addicting. It had a smooth texture and wasn't too sweet. \n\nNeedless to say that everyone finished their meal. This place is a go-to if you're looking for some bomb seafood, especially for some crab. I cannot wait to come back again!", "author": "Jenna T."}

We spent $110 (before tip )for two adults and one child no drinks but we only got one appetizer. The main dish portions are huge. You need to get the sizzle plate: \nThe crab is pretty good. The shrimp is better than average. \n\nThe \"choose your own fish plate\" is highly recommended. You get to chose the fish sauce and sides for $28.  It's very good for picky people who like choices. It's one of the few times I didn't substitute or ask them to take out anything. \n\nIt's very crowded Bc it's in a touristy area. It's supposed to have amazing views but I only rate my reviews based on food and service ONLY ( not on parking or views etc). \n\nThe hostesss and host were not very nice but I got one real smile from one host after I said I had a reservation.  the wait staff and bus boys were sooooooo nice ! Extremely busy on a Friday night even late at 8 pm. We would definitely return but at an earlier time Bc after 6 pm I think it gets crazy and wait staff isn't as attentive. If they had been more attentive and came around more then we would have gotten dessert but it took them 15 minutes  to clean up our plates and we were figuring it would take them another 30-40 minutes for coffee and dessert and check so we just left after main course. It's not a fancy place but you should definitely dress something in nicer than jeans. If you go on the weekend nights it's Not good for kids younger than 4 Bc it's very crowded loud and can be a bit dangerous with all the sizzle platters on every table. \n\nAgain, excellent wait service, genuine hospitality and good food on 8/25/2017. \n\n4.5 stars !!!", "author": "Marwan Y."}

Our ritual is to ride a tandem to Tiburon and take the ferry back, timing it so we arrive here for a reservation ~30 minutes before sunset. All seats have a wonderful view of the bay. \n\nThis trip, the Clam Chowder was spot on and the Cesar salad was well made. But the star of the show was the sizzling platter of crab in garlic sauce! IMHO, No other crab compares to Dungeness, it is sweet and delectable while further enhanced with their secret sauce. Throw that on a sizzling platter and get out of my way. \n\nToss in a bottle of Stags Leap Merlot and you have perfection.

I walked in with two children under 6 and asked for the children's menu and to sit on the balcony outside. As we ordered I was literally ordering off of page 26 the children's menu and asked for two fish and chips. We waited some time for the food and when It came two full adult size portions and plates arrived not only with huge portion sizes but seasoning and potato's the size of golf balls with onions and olives baked into it all. I explained that I had ordered the children's fish and chips and had mentioned to the hostess that only the kids would be eating and we were fine outside. It was a little chilly out and not packed outside. Anyway when I called the waiter back over to the table to ask if these were the adult portions he said yes that's what you ordered - I asked you if you wanted two adult portions and you said yes. I looked at him dumbfounded as he made me out to be the one that had made the mistake - clearly he doesn't have two kids as a single care taker as I said I was ordering for two children multiple times. do these two five year olds look like they can eat this much food? I asked? He said no mama and offered to take them back and place new children's plate fish and chip orders - he left with the food only to return less than two minutes later with one of the adult meals split in half and put on two smaller plates and the seasoning side of the fish turned over so you couldn't see it on top. I again called him back and asked if this was the children's menu and he said yes. I didn't argue this time. We just left underwhelmed - since when does a child's fish and chips not come with plain fish and French fires ? The veggies had baked black olives and small. Circle onions with potatoes the size of golf balls - needless to say we didn't wait for him to fix this again we scraped off the seasoning eat the fish and left the potatoes.  It was a waist of $40 and a disappointing experience to say the least! Why have a children's menu if you don't make kid friendly meals?", "author": "Debbie L."}

The last time we were here, it was this restaurant that we said we'd definitely come back to. I guess a lot can change in just a few years because we were so disappointed this time that I seriously had to pray about it. Food is nothing short of tasteless. Clam chowder in a bread bowl is an expensive $13 joke! They cut out a very shallow hole and fill it with maybe five spoonfuls of runny chowder. I ordered shrimp & chips. The shrimp tasted frozen (like that nasty frozen taste food gets from being in a freezer that someone forgot to put a box of Arm & Hammer in), and was so oily. This place is right there on the Bay, and not only is their seafood not fresh, it is way too overpriced. \n\nThen there was the waiter who spoke English with a Cesar Milan accent but claimed to know very little Spanish. I'm not ragging on Cesar's accent either. In fact, my husband speaks English with a heavy accent. It just bugged me to see someone so blatantly ashamed of their heritage. How much more effective he would be if he used his ability to speak multiple languages especially when interacting with the public in touristy restaurant like this one? \n\nAnyhow, everything about this place doesn't even deserve the single star I've given it. Maybe the star is just for the nice view of Alcatraz but that's about it. \n\nOh, and if you want your parking validated, you have to park in the lot directly across from them, next to Boudin. We parked in the Pier 39 parking structure. They have signs that indicate they honor restaurant validation but don't indicate that only from specific restaurants. \n\nFinally, the restrooms are so horrendous, I decided to wait to get back to our room. Any restaurant with dirty facilities always concern me. My thought is if your bathrooms are unclean and unkept, what does your kitchen look like? The kitchen where you're preparing my food.\n\nTony Bennett sang he left his heart but we left too much damn money in San Francisco, starting at this crappy establishment.

They have a nice looking bar but like I said it's very cramped inside so elbow room is nonexistent. \nI ordered the Dungeness Crab, Mussels & Shrimp, all in garlic sauce. Everything was served on a sizzling skillet, drenched in all kinds of garlicky goodness.\nOh man! Best crab I have ever eaten. The sweetness of it just blew me away. The calamari was just ok. They use cornmeal & I think Old Bay seasoning for it which aren't my favorite things. But it was cooked really well & not chewy or gummy at all. \nThe draft beer is very good. I prefer mine colder but the Stella I ordered was right on. Great atmosphere, situated right on the Pier (41 or 43, I think) right across from the Boudin Sourdough Bakery. \nThis is a great place for a family dinner. Not so much for romance because the indoor seating is LOUD. The patio seating is small & the chairs aren't the nice ones inside, but u'll enjoy the better view. \nInside seating by the windows in hopes of getting a romantic sunset dinner will always be threatened with the legendary fog of San Francisco... \nSo sit outside, enjoy the breeze & people watch as you chow down.", "author": "Rafael M."}

Server was helpful in recommending right size portions for how hungry we were. Ended up having the Bruschetta, Crab Fondue, and a large order of mussels & shrimp for 3 of us. Had a little bit leftover of each, so could have ditched one of the appetizers, but I liked the variety. \n\nThe mussels were outstanding; some of the best mussels I've ever had, and no extra sauce needed. Shrimp was delicious, although pretty heavily coated in buttery sauce. Crab Fondue also excellent, and the tomatoes on the Bruschetta appetizer were seriously amazing.\n\nFairly pricey for a casual lunch (~$120 for above food and two beers) and in touristy Fisherman's Wharf, but well worth the occasional splurge for the food, view, and service.", "author": "Chelsea H."}

I shall quote Julia Roberts' character Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman regarding my decision to try it anyway:  \"Big mistake! Big. Huge.\" \n\nI ordered the Prix Fixe three course meal. I chose the clam chowder as my starter. It was not good, putting it nicely. It tasted old, as though it had been simmering all day. Campbell's makes a better clam chowder and packages it in a can for $1.59 at the local supermarket. \n\nMy main course was the crab alfredo. The crab alfredo was more like crap alfredo. As much as I hate to admit it to myself, this dish paled in comparison to a national seafood chain restaurant's crab alfredo. The linguine did not have enough alfredo sauce, and it was lacking flavor. I tried to keep reminding myself that this was Dungeness crab rather than snow crab, but the food was disappointing nonetheless. \n\nThe service was awful. We dined close to closing time, which is never a good idea. The server was absent for the majority of the meal. We had to ask other employees for refills on water and soda several times. We had to remind the server to bring our desserts that were ordered at the time of the main course, and we had to ask for our check when our dining experience was over. \n\nThe vanilla custard ice cream and the strawberry banana sundae with chocolate syrup added (per our request) was the absolute best part of this meal. If we had not had the desserts, I would have given only one star. \n\nBottom line:  The dining experience was fair.  The music was delightful, as it offered a nostalgic mood.

Never done PPQ but have heard they're pretty good too.\n\nIf you're in the South Bay and don't want to venture out, we have found KING WAH in Milpitas to have some pretty righteous crab - especially in season.\n\nLast weekend, we wanted to try someplace different and wound up at Franciscan Crab.\n\nWide open space with lots of seating and ocean views.\n\nHere's what we got:\n\nWHOLE GARLIC CRAB (5/5)  Tasted on par with CRAB HOUSE on Pier 39.  The server cut the crab up for me at the table to make it more manageable.  Great flavor, could have eaten more but I would have been called a pig or a glutton and didn't want to risk that.\n\nCRAB ALFREDO (5/5)  My daughter's dish but I tasted it and it was rich, simple and very tasty.  High in calories I'm sure, but I think worth it.  Wish it had more crab in it, but I wish that for every crab dish I've ever eaten or will eat in the future.\n\nYELLOWTAIL CARPACCIO (4/5) Thinly sliced pieces in a tangy soy-sauce mixture.   Pretty good, hard to go wrong with yellowtail.\n\nCLAM CHOWDER (3/5) Completely edible but not my cup of chowder.  It has a sourness that I didn't care for.  \n\nCRAB CHOWDER (2/5) Way over salted, we sent it back and it was comped. Lacking crab flavor.  Not creamy, one note.\n\nPROSCIUTTO W/BURRATA (4/5)  Sliced prosciutto served with  a very creamy burrata.  Comes with some bread for spreading.\n\nGARLIC NOODLES (added crab) (1/5)  Again, way over salted.  My wife's dish.  She didn't eat it.  She didn't want to send it back but didn't because she had just sent the CRAB CHOWDER.    She said it tasted like the crab chowder was the \"sauce\" for the noodles and I think she was right.\n\nPARMESAN/TRUFFLE FRIES (5/5) Addictive and enjoyable.\n\nService was good, although the place was pretty empty.\n\nWe got burned on a couple dishes (crab chowder and the noodles), but the other dishes were all enjoyable.  \n\nOn the water, kind of feels like a special place, worthy probably of a round-up to four stars.\nI'd go back for the WHOLE CRAB and the ALFREDO for sure.", "author": "Darien R."}

The food is excellent. We recently went with some friends who have gone with us a number of times; they also eat there a number of times a year. The last time we went we paid for our bills separate, our bill was about $120 and we paid cash and gave the waiter more than a 20% tip. The couple with us used a credit card. Later that day our friends received a text from their credit card company that they had two separate charges from the restaurant. After calling the management we found out that the waiter stole our cash and billed our friends for our check amount. It took a number of days to get the extra charge off of their credit card. Restaurant management did tell us that this was not a mistake and they have had trouble with the same waiter before. Needless to say we will not be eating there again; there are too many other good restaurants in the area.\n\nUpdate: Management apologized and sent us a voucher to entice us to try them again. So we did; you really can't beat the view and the food when it's on point. However this experience again started out disappointing due to a dirty water glass brought to me which had bright purple lipstick stains (not mine). I turned it out so hopefully the waiter would notice (it was that obvious) but he never did; I never said anything; I didn't see the point. The waiter was not friendly at all and provided the least amount of service possible; maybe due to a language barrier; we only speak English; he seemed uncomfortable in his server role. All in all, not impressed with this restaurant anymore; it's not worth the premium prices they charge. Much better food and service is around almost any corner in the city.

One of the places we kept seeing on the hotel tv program were various local restaurants that the reviewers were raving about.  One of those places was the Franciscan.  We tried it tonight...  to keep comparison somewhat consistent, we tried dishes that we'd find in other places - fried calamari, fish and chips (well, potato not fries) and shrimp/mussel combo.\n\nWell, for the high price you pay - yes it's a tourist location and has a decent view - and all the brilliant reviews, I expected great flavors and quality.  The fried calamari was so-so.  The flavor was off and I've had a LOT of fried calamari in many different places.  The fish and potatoes was also so-so.  Maybe it's personal preference but I'm used to cod/haddock for the fish but this was something like else (at least it tasted very different).  The potatoes looked overcooked and just unappetizing.  The mussels were decent but not the best I've tasted.  Shrimp was over-buttered and greasy.\n\nI had some fish/shrimp/chips at a very casual nearby joint and that was delicious.  Sometimes, price does not equal quality.\n\nI'm not dismissing the Franciscan as a restaurant overall but this is just my opinion of the dishes we ordered.  We went in HOPING it was more than just a tourist spot but we didn't get any evidence of the opposite.

However the Franciscan was our 1st & last. \nUnfortunately NOT good for kids under 10! The Children's \"menu\" is in fact not. All of 4 items to choose from normally not that much of an issue however the \"Fish & Chips\" is not chips at all. This restaurant doesn't have French Fries! Not even \"chips\"! Instead your children choose from a succotash combo with cubed potatoes, mashed potatoes w/zucchini or pearl pasta w/ snap peas & tomatoes or steamed veggie mix. For most some healthy options however don't state you have Fish & Chips if it's actually Fish & Veggies. And tell me if you have all these potato side options then why can't you cut up some French fries...seriously not that hard. And we know you have a fryer since the fish is fried. There ware a few other unhappy moments but I don't want to name names. Probably should have left when there wasn't French fries. But it doesn't stop there.....the grown up food was so.....so. I wouldn't brag about it by any means. Pasta dishes left something to be desired. And the chowders....we've had better. Go to Boudins for that!

I wish I got her name but she was attentive,  pleasant and accommodating.  \nMyself and 2 friends were here at 6pm on Thursday March 1st. They sat us right away at a window seat which was nice.  Wish the windows were cleaner, they had bird droppings dripping down the glass which didn't make good pics of the view but I understand this might be the norm for any ocean view restaurant. \nI started with a martini, the Ariel, which was delicious.  It had fresh cucumber, vodka, pineapple juice...very refreshing and yummy.\nStarted with the prosciutto & burrata cheese which was tasty but the presentation was amateur.  The prosciutto was place on a small plastic cutting board with the paper still under it, the burrata was in a metal condiment dish (like the ones you get when you ask for ketchup or mayo), a drizzle of olive oil. It would have been presented nicer on a bread plate & easier to get the burrata if it weren't in that cheap looking deep dish.\nI ordered the crab sandwiches, which came with three small servings. The bread underneath was soaking wet with juices that came through from the crab so I couldn't eat it because it was so soggy. There were still shells throughout the crab so I'm glad I didn't bite into the sandwich  as  I was picking through it. I ended up just eating the crab and avocado out of it. The vegetables that accompanied the sandwich were basic and nothing to rave about. \nI don't get to the City often so I was excited to try a new restaurant as the City offers so many amazing restaurants. This was a very disappointing experience and I would never go back based on the prices and the quality of the food as well as the poor presentation. The prices do not reflect the quality that is being served. They are very proud of what they were offering by the prices they were charging but the product didn't match up.", "author": "Kris L."}

We live in L.A, but we always come down to Pier 39 and end up eating around here several times a year.\n\nThis restaurant, even though is on the expensive side, in comparison to what's available at the Pier... always has good food. \n\nHowever, the service is BAD.\n\nThis time, to be fair, our server \"Leonard\" was attentive, when he was around. The problem is, he was not around that much, and the food constantly got dumped on our table by the staff in the kitchen, without the existing food and plates being cleaned off first. So while we are still eating our appetizers, the new food comes in and they drop it off and there is no room. We are trying to give them empty plates while they are walking away. It was very frustrating. \n\nLast time I came, the service was so bad that we wanted to walk out. We came back again because we really like the food. If it wasn't for the good food, we would never give this place a second chance. \n\nManagement, please do something about your operation.

We got in and stood by the host desk waiting to be seated. It was 4pm and the restaurant was still quiet. The host was talking to another employee for half a minute before he turned his face to us, and he looked unhappy with eyebrows twisted. \n\nI said we're a party of 3 and he confirmed \"3?\". This is the only word he ever sais to us. He then took us to the seat in silence, put the menu down and left.\n\nThey we had to keep sitting there for 10 minutes before our server came to ask what we'd wanna drink, btw he didn't look happy neither from what I could see on his face. Again the restaurant was not busy at all and there were a few people passing our table but none stopped or informed our server until 10 mins past.\n\nThen we ordered a big combo, octupos cappaccio, crab chowder in bread bowl and a seabass. The food didn't take long to come, but interestingly the server came to ask \"is everything okay?\" When the food runner was placing dishes on table. How would I know if it's okay when my dish was still in your runner's hand???\n\nAs for the food, there seabass read decent, octupos cappaccio was okay, and overall all the dishes were kinda salty, especially the crab chowder and grilled shrimps. The saltiness covered all other flavours. \n\nOur server never came back to the table. Another lady server passed by a few times I asked her fee for the check when we're done. She approached the table, heard what I said and nodded, when brought the check, took my card to swipe and brought there check folder back. She had a smile on her face but DIDN'T say a word during this entire time! None! It was silent again.\n\nIt was just wired, like I said the staff didn't look happy at all.\n\nI still tipped 15% but honestly, I won't be ashamed even I didin't give a dime, for this kind of \"service\".\n\nBtw, yes I know you might be really dissapointed to hear this, this is not the usuau case of your level of service, you take issues and concerns seriously, and you strive to provide excellent experience to every guest.", "author": "Keyi P."}

Besides this, our meal was delicious and the view of Alcatraz was so cool! The atmosphere and decor was awesome with retro style booth seats and photos covering the walls. The Lots-a-crab wasn't quite as much as we had hoped for but as I wasn't starving, it was plenty. The potatoes were ok but not exactly good and I only ate a few, enough to not feel bad about ordering them I suppose. Enough negatives, the crab was delicious and came out quickly.

For dessert, I shared the giant serving of strawberry frozen custard homemade ice cream (please see this photo).  It was gigantic and soooooooo good.  Needless to say, we ate it all (there were three of us)!  Wow; it is always a great day when dessert makes you happy! \n\nWhy only 4 stars?

Unfortunately, it was overpriced and average at best.\n\nWe hung at the bar while waited for our table and perused the menu, which was more like a catalog; full of pictures, recipes and quite wordy. The ambiance of the overall place is bright, almost too bright; I think some softer lighting would give it a warmer feel.\n\nTwo of us opted for the prix fixe option. In all the wordiness of the menu, they neglect to mention there are absolutely no substitutions for the prix fixe. You want some chocolate sauce on the vanilla ice cream dessert - nope. Even if you want to pay, the answer is no. You ask if you can get chicken instead of shrimp on the alfredo (on the regular menu) - sorry, Charlie.\n\nI started with the house salad. I was told the vinaigrette is homemade and very good. Frankly, I was unimpressed with the salad and found the dressing bland, as if it was heavy on oil and light on vinegar. My entree was the crab alfredo. It was good, but very heavy and rich as most alfredos are. The portion of crab in the dish was very generous, but I got crunchy bites more than once. I imagine it's hard to keep those out. Dessert was the vanilla ice cream, served in a highball. The presentation was vanilla (pun intended), buy the ice cream rich and very tasty. The portion is smaller than what's pictured on the menu, but it was more than enough for us. The person who opted to order from the menu got the chocolate sundae and it was huge, definitely suitable for two.\n\nPersonally, if I'm going to drop money on seafood in the Wharf, I'm probably going to Scoma's. I prefer the food and ambiance.", "author": "Mary T."}

We noticed a crowd in and around this restaurant so we decided to give it a try. (Side Note: we did check the ratings on YELP.. excellent) As we entered and headed up the stairway, we stopped to see all the photos on the walls of Hollywood's biggest and best actors/actresses of the past. Wow..very cool. We were told it was going to be an hour wait, but if we wanted to sit outside they could seat us immediately. We chose outside, which allowed us to see the entertainment on the boardwalk too. We were seated and offered water, and menus. While reading our menus and watching the entertainment, we decided which drinks we wanted and began choosing our menu selections.\nMy husband had the crab legs and mussels (double order I believe) I had the clam chowder bread bowl... how could I spend a weekend in SF and not get the famous Boudin bread... so that was my choice. (I knew I would sneak some of the hubbys anyway)\nThe waiter showed up and asked what we wanted to drink, and off he went before we could order food too. No worries we figured he would be back soon with our drinks anyway. Well... that was definitely not the case. It was at least 10 min. before he came back and then he took our order. No big deal right? WRONG!!! While the food came out pretty quick, but we had asked him for silverware and he never brought it. My husband had also asked him for hot sauce, again he never brought it. My husband, tired of waiting to eat decided to get it himself. He managed to find hot sauce, but had to find a bus person to find us silverware. Our waiter never came back to find out if everything was okay. Which by the way, the crab and mussels were outstanding. The buttery, garlic flavor was quickly rising as one the best seafood feasts I have ever had. My clam chowder was creamy and full of tasty clams. Whole clams not cut up pieces. The bread was outstanding, and made me want to eat the whole thing. Which I almost would have if not for the hubby wanting some bread with his food. (another note: everyone else had bread on their table while they waited for food, but alas not us) Had it not been for the amazing food we inhaled, I would have given this place -4 stars.\nWe finally saw our waiter again, but only to bring us our bill.

Thus I believe the menu choices changed and were updated to center around mostly seafood and the name of the restaurant emphasizing \n\"crab\" which is definitely in season this time of the year and appeared prominently on almost every page of the menu.\n\nThe view is one of the best overlooking the Bay in the Fisherman Wharf/Pier 39 tourist area.

We came early and it wasn't busy, but it picked up once we finished our meal. We came during lunch time and it was a hot day in the bay especially in the pier area. I don't think this restaurant has A.C because it got really stuffy inside and people were sweating and complaining. This restaurant was good about seating huge groups and I love the decorations in the building. They have a fresh bread station and they bring some to you while to wait for your food. We ordered a good amount of food and I really liked that their menu did include pictures of the food they have. Therefore you don't have to pull out your phone and yelp out the dish. You could easily decide what you want by looking at their menu. Price was on the expensive side, but do know that you are in the Pier in the tourist area so things will be expensive. I did like the crab was fresh, but the shrimp was on the smaller side. I did order crab sliders and loved it. I was so amazed with the decor and food I ordered. The view of the water and bay area was amazing in the day time. I would definitely like to come back again during dinner time to adore the view of the bay area and food.

I so five them that but while we waited they gave us some bread that been sitting out where anybody can touch by the tables. So, when they brought the food out, I was puzzle because I asked for fish and chips not fish and potatoes. So, brought up my concerns to the cook that brought out the food and he said they recently changed the fries with potatoes but he can go downstairs and get us fries after looking at our face expressions. We was really thankful  for him doing that. But, then the manager came and stated she can't send her employee downstairs to get the fries and she can substitute it for mash potatoes or an salad. WTF, I want what I order. So, my mother in law was like naw, we going some where else because  Im not paying for something that I didn't want. She saw we about to leave and she hope on her phone and said never mind she going to get us fries. What! So, you came and talk to us for what. To waste our time and yours to give us what we wanted in the first place. You need to put that its fish and potatoes because last time I checked fish and chips is fish and fries.  Not, only that the waitress never came once in checked on us. We had to ask who ever walk by who work there cam the bring us something to drink.

The crab was cooked to perfection and the three of us were just in heaven! \n\nThe restaurant had tons of black and white photos of famous celebrities. Lucille Ball was in the booth with us while we savored cracking crab, catching up and enjoyed our view of the sailboats sailing around Alcatraz. I made reservations in advance and they were quick to seat us even before our designated time. \n\nThis is a wonderful restaurant where you don't feel rushed to have your meal and service was excellent, attentive and most helpful with tons of wet wipes for our crab drenched hands. The table was efficiently bussed after we finished to make room for dessert. \n\nYes, you could go downstairs and grab crab for cheaper at one of the many crab stalls, fight off the pigeons and eat in the wind.

I asked one of the staff what was the story and he smilingly bent a fake branch and a pillow of dust popped off a fake limb.\n\nWe both laughed. Oh well.\n\nIt's a shame the faux-foliage detracts from the otherwise retro-cool interior. I loved the red leather booths, black and white, framed celebrity photos and maritime paraphernalia. \n\nSadly, most staff lacked any hospitality and had this slightly lost look like they didn't know what they should be doing. \n\nOur server, however, was relentlessly attentive and sweet, doting on my little boy like a woman who has a child that age. I gave her a huge tip.\n\nBut the real point of it: The food, hmmmm....\n\nWhile the Crab Alfredo was outstanding and perfectly executed, my son's meal and the soup appetizer were disappointing. The food was uneven like the service: One great experience with puzzling stumbles. \n\nThe cup of crab soup had a broth so thick it tasted like an enormous amount of flour had been measured into it. I was informed it was potato starch. Whatever it was, it overwhelmed the delicate Dungeness crab, at $12.95 a cup. \n\n(Even at the Wharf, the prices were sticker shock).\n\nThe crab Alfredo was on par and decadently delicious since it was made with a copious amount of fresh Dungeness crab, clarified butter and heavy cream. It was a smaller portion yet I could only eat half.  It was rich and delicious. \n\nMy little boy had the children's  portion of buttermilk fried chicken. It was chicken fingers; it wasn't buttermilk fried chicken. The corn on the cob and roasted potatoes that accompanied it looked dried out and unappetizing. My little boy didn't touch either and only ate a small portion of the chicken. \n\nOne appetizer, two entrees (choosing the least costly) and one Anchor Steam: $63 + tip.\n\nI wanted it to be worth it. Sadly, it wasn't. \n\nIf I splurge again at the Franciscan, I'll skip the soup and go right for the shrimp and Dungeness crab platter. Other Yelpers say it's off-the-hook.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

There were plenty of seafood options, we eyed the lobster rolls from the food cases but wanted someplace we could sit down. After scanning the various menus of the restaurants, we settled on the Franciscan. This was the best choice since it was cheaper than Alioto's and with no wait to boot, it also had a great view into the harbor with Alcatraz directly within view. It was mid-afternoon and their large windows provide every seat with an amazing view. We ordered the Shrimp Alfredo and the Fish & Chips. The Shrimp Alfredo was delicious and buttery. For the Fish & Chips, the fish was cooked perfectly along with the chips being comprised of smashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, and corn. My boyfriend had ordered a small Blue Moon Beer (but the small was pretty large and was the same size as the glass of water they gave us). We noticed later that there was something stuck on the inside of the glass and they made sure to give us a fresh new glass filled to the brim this time with beer. I was a little disappointed that the lemonade wasn't fresh but rather that Minute-maid stuff but it was still good and came in a glass larger than what the beer was in. The menu is odd and feels like a child's menu with all of the pictures and outdated Photoshop but it did help us realize what exactly what we were getting. What was also disappointing was that the bread was obviously sitting out for awhile in front of us pre-plated which didn't look that appetizing especially since the bread was a little tough to rip apart.", "author": "Isabelle C."}

I ordered the fixed price menu and chose the chowder soup as my appetizer, crab legs for entree and was served ice cream in a cup for dessert for $39. Overall it was a good experience. The crab legs were served hot in a skillet with butter. There was at least half a crab which was a good size for the price. The soup was also quite delicious. However I was slightly disappointed by how cold the bread was that was served in the beginning. My partner also ordered the fish and chips and it was not as expected. There weren't any fries! It was a just potatoes with olives and a piece of corn. The fried fish also wasn't drained/dried so it got super soggy fast. But he said the flavour wasn't bad and was overall decent.", "author": "Evelyn Y."}

Brian and I came here on a rainy day after having our shoes damped and feeling exhausted.\n\nLocation:\n\nIt's within the Fisherman's Wharf area. There's parking you have to pay for, but if you find a parking spot for free, good luck with that! Other than that, the restaurant is right by the bay and pier where you can enjoy the bay views and seagulls trying to hustle it up for some bread.\n\nAmbiance:\n\nI'm kind of confused with the decorations. It's almost kind of obnoxious actually... There's Italian with tourist decorations and Latino decorations... It honestly sounds like this poor restaurant is experiencing an identity crisis. However, you order at the front of the counter and pray to the lord you actually find a good seat especially during the lunch hour.\n\nFood:\n\nBrian and I had the Clam Chowder in a bread bowl. Sadly, I'm not a huge fan of the clam chowder. Even though I love the flavors combined, it was a bit too mushy and chowder-y for me to handle. It's not ideal for the individual who likes to slurp more on the soup rather than chew it like it's curry. The bread on the other hand was really good. I liked the inside of the bread bowl because it soft and wonderful to enjoy.\n\nCustomer Service:\n\nI have to give props to the ladies for their customer service. They were extremely friendly and offered us suggestions on what to order on the menu.\n\nOverall:\n\nI'll probably come back to try something different, but for now, I would rather walk another 10-15 minutes for some street seafood along the popular tourist trap.", "author": "Aubrey D."}

There is so much around the area with tourists, cars, and buses, it's better to just walk.  \n\nParking... Supposedly you can park across the street in the lot, IF they open it... The entrances to the lot were blocked by cones, and the attendants open the lot periodically.  So you have to time it, we missed our chance and got stuck in traffic again for another 30 mins.  \n\nWe had a 4:30 reservation, but they told us they wouldn't be able to seat us until a half hour later, and w/out the window table we requested for my Mom's birthday. Huh? Really? You mean we gotta wait AND we don't get a window table? \n\nI've worked in the industry. If you have reservations, you plan for those accordingly.

I'm glad we decided to give it a go.  The entry was filled with nostalgia from all the celebrities that had dined there throughout the decades.  The interior was brightly lit and had a joyful, fun ambience.  Yes there were many tourists there, but it was nice to be among them and enjoy the vibe, and they were there for a reason; excellent, fresh sea food!  The locale is quite spacious with plenty of seating to choose from, and there is few validated parking with the lot directly across which is a real bonus at the wharf. Of course the most famous dish is the local Dungeness crab which was presented elegantly with signature garlic butter sauce on a tower with shell bowl beneath.  The crab was cracked, clean and ready to eat.  Extraordinarily fresh and highly recommended, but only when in season and fresh; never frozen!  Prior to the crab, we had paper thin slices yellow tail carpaccio which was quite good, but it was saturated in too much olive oil and balsamic.  One of our friends had the fresh halibut which she really enjoyed.   Salad was a bit wilted and not very green; could be improved.  To end, we enjoyed complimentary vanilla ice cream. There were no corkage fees for our wine which was a pleasant surprise, and we enjoyed a beautiful view of the wharf and the bay.   UPDATE: Fourth time here was a miss.  Upon entry, we inquired with the host as to whether we may have a table and preferably one with a view.  Host not pleasant with reply and not many smiles with the wait staff.  Service not as attentive; had to ask twice for lemon and drawn butter; never did get the latter, crab was not cracked and no ice cream at the end :(.

I know it's a restaurant and people drop food, etc. but I have never seen such a dirty floor at any other restaurant. Their carpet is bright red, so maybe that causes whatever is on it to stand out more, but it's not a pretty sight and definitely negatively impacted my first impression. \nWe got seated and then noticed how HOT it was in the restaurant! I mean, GROSSLY hot, not just a little warm. Our waitress came by and was visibly perspiring on her face. We told her to please let the manager know that the AC needs to be turned on and she agreed about how hot it was and said she'd talk to her. \nWe had to change our son's diaper, so my husband went to the restroom with him to take care of it. (BTW, the bathroom was obnoxiously far from our table and the route to it is through the bar area so there are a lot of people standing around and having to go through the crowd is pretty annoying.) My husband finally returned just to inform me that there is no changing table. So I took my son and went to the ladies' room and, sure enough, there is a changing table in the ladies' room. I cannot even BEGIN to describe how enraging that was!!! I'm sorry, are we living in 1952?! You're basically saying that a MAN is NEVER alone with a child that needs a diaper change! It's outrageous. \nThe manager came by to speak to us because the waitress had told her about our complaint regarding the heat. She was very nice and by that time, the AC had been turned on, so it was much better temperature wise. We mentioned to her the changing station issue. She said that she apologizes, but the restaurant was built in the 50's. Well - maybe that's  an update you should make! That's not an excuse! She said she's happy to have my husband go and change our son in a side room of some sort and we told her no, it's OK, I already changed him (because, you know, I'm the woman and it's clearly my responsibility). \nWe were only able to get drinks and appetizers because our son was starting to melt down, and honestly, the food was... meh. Expensive - so I would expect more than \"meh\". We got the fried pearl onions, which were just bland and sort of tasteless, and also the crab and spinach fondue, which was much better. \nAll in all, I would NOT recommend this restaurant based on my personal experience. Especially considering how many fantastic seafood restaurants are in that area.", "author": "Marta H."}

We went in the mid afternoon so it wasn't busy.  The negative started as soon as we walked in the door. The Maitre'd was flat-out rude and snobby.  He gave a look that was almost  vicious!! The waiter was good, however, and when we told him we were on a time crunch due to the tour and he was quick with service.  The drinks were okay - hubby had wine and I had a cocktail which I can't recall the name of.  \n\nWe ordered the platter of seafood - crab and shrimp feast which the waiter kept saying was \"a lot of food\".  It filled us up but was not good.  The crab tasted kind of old, smelled very fishy which is never a good sign.  The shrimp were dry and old tasting.  We live in Colorado and we get better seafood there.  Neither of us were pleased with it.  The bread was good, however. \n\nThe view is great, the windows dirty.  The place was half empty and the rude guy tried to seat us away from the window. We had to beg for a window seat.  I mean, why are we here?  Not sure why others have raved about the seafood.  Maybe we got the literal bottom of the barrel?  Not worth the money.  We wished we'd gone somewhere less snooty with fresher seafood.

We had a big group and came in right at dinner rush and they managed to seat us quickly. Our server was nice, but didn't know very much about gluten free options. \n\nAside from the pure seafood there isn't much someone with a gluten allergy can eat. I settled for the crab and shrimp Louie salad and my server was nice enough to let me read the dressing ingredients, but then as she brought out the food told me the kitchen informed her they then add flour to thicken the dressing... Why do that.. And could you maybe NOT do that for someone who can't have flour?? I was given oil and vinegar which was really terrible on that salad unfortunately.. I picked at the shrimp and crab, which was a generous portion, but left most of it. \n\nMy coresidents and their wives had a variety of meals, the only thing I heard was that both people who ordered the crab melts didn't really like them. The others seemed relatively pleased. \n\nPrices are expensive, as is expected on the wharf. Portion sizes seem good though which helps make up for it. Service is good and the view amazing..

Then another couple comes. The girl (Marisa G) at the bar gave them all the attention a guest needs since she knew who they were, friends. Meanwhile I'm waiting to get a refill on my Beer. I left my glass in plane view and these bartenders just kept walking by. So much that my wife says my husband would like a beer because I was just seeing how long it would take them.

The view out the back of the restaurant is amazing. All glass, perfect place to eat seafood, have a cocktail and take in the unobstructed beauty. The decor is wonderful. Complete with hundreds of photos of A-list celebrities all over the walls and great booths, stadium style seating so everyone can have an unobstructed view. \n\nFOOD: they have some exciting fresh grilled crab/shrimp/mussel dishes that you have to roll up your sleaves and get dirty to enjoy. The rest of the menu offers everything from chowder, salads, charcuterie, pasta, grilled fish and steaks. Overall, the quality ranges from B- to B+. \n\nVALUE: you are paying for the location, view and experience.

We kept their choices to the Prix Fixe menu to manage our costs, since my now husband and I were picking up the tab.

Expensive meal, but you reap the benefits by the taste and in the tummy ;) \n\nService is very pleasant. The waiters are mannerful and enthusiastic ... They checked on our table several times, clearing out the plates expeditiously as well. The waiter even gave us a complementary ice cream :) Way to sweeten my palate and heart! \n\nNow to the main course. I recommend the prix fixe menu to get a comprehensive taste of the place. I ordered the clam chowder, crab Alfredo pasta, and vanilla ice cream for dessert. My family ordered a host of other dishes, including the whole crabs, which are a must try! The legs are full of tender meat. The pasta dish I had was the perfect portion, very scrumptious cream sauce with a small amount of crab meat. Many other options to try as part of the entree ...

Service lacked immense attentiveness from the very start. First, after bringing us our menus, he walks away with not even asking if we may, just want something to drink??? We then have to notion someone down that we need our server so we can get started with some drinks. My brother and I, had bloody mary's.  My mother had water and my dad had a coke. And, after he/our server, took our drink orders, we were just about to inquire about something on the menu when he just walks away...really? He finally brought our drinks over which might I say, the Bloody Marys looked stunning! But, he forgot straws?? ugh...then he comes back several minutes later to bring us straws...and mind you, the whole time he has a very impatient, ( not server) little attitude. He was then gone for a while after we had perused our menus to decide what we would be ordering....did he forget he was supposed to then take our orders??? We then had to notion down another nice server ( who I wish was ours) that we would like to order...lmao...he even laughed a bit noticing how frustrated we must be with him. He then comes over and we began to proceed ordering. I was asking him about the \" Basa\" fish they had for I thought it looked good; I asked him how the fish was/ what kind ect....He said \" I don't know\"... me \" Um, ok, could you possible find out a little more about it before I potentially order it? He then says \" Yes, I apologize, I'm new\" Ok, I think that fine, but please be a little more apologetic and sincere about it. Anyways, he managed to get some more info about it. We then placed our orders. My mom and I got the basa fish. You can choose what kind of seasoning/sauce to have your fish cooked in - we both chose the garlic butter way. It also comes with potato's and veggies, we both just subed for extra veggies instead. My father and brother got the Halibut. \n\nWhile waiting for our food to arrive, I sat back, took in the views, conversed with my little family- all while sipping on my EXCELLENT tasting bloody Mary. Both my brother and I agreed, it was stellar. Food then arrived also looking fantastic. After receiving our food, we had requested some more butter for the bread (that they did not deliver tell just before our dinner arrived)...smh. As well as some napkins and a fork my father needed to you know, eat....minutes passed and he never brought it....had to notion once again, to another server that we needed our server. He finally brought what we needed. Now everyone found their food to taste fantastic, I also thoroughly enjoyed my fish and found everything to be seasoned and cooked wonderfully, however, hating to go back to our \" Server\", not once did he ever come back to check up on us to see if everything was ok; and after needing some refills on drinks, with our server not being around, yet again, we had to hunt down the same server before, to get our \" Server\" who was mia and to only to find out he had went on his break....really? You go on a break without letting your customers know?? And at least not letting us know another server will be assisting us while you are on your \" break\" needless to say, we were all quite agitated by this point ; which lead us to requesting the manager. \n\nThe manager then came over and was extremely professional and understanding after sharing our disappointing experience. She sincerely apologized and agreed he could probably use some improvement;And to accommodate us, she comped all of our drinks. We had a couple Bloody Mary's as well as other drinks that were pricey, so I greatly appreciated that...she also asked if we wanted a dessert, but we were all quite full at this point. \n\nAside from the lack of service from our one server, we found everyone else to be pleasant and accommodating; and with the stellar views and decent food, I will probably continue to make frequent visits in the future - hopefully that \"Server \" will be gone :)", "author": "Shannon H."}

It was about 4pm on a Saturday, and for whatever reason, the crowd down by Fisherman's Wharf was incredibly heavy - even for a Saturday.  We had just biked the Golden Gate, so we were pretty worn out.  Let's just all agree that the seafood you'll get here will almost always be an incredible experience, and it will be different from any local seafood restaurant that you'll visit back home, wherever you're visiting from.  For me, the only minor disappointment was the \"cattle drive\" nature of the whole experience.  Due to crowd and noise levels, and just due to the popularity of this place and where it's located, you feel a little bit like you're part of a huge \"machine\" that brings people in and then shows them the door each day, by the thousands.  These days, I'm more into the intimate settings, where each menu item is carefully crafted by a chef who cares about each individual patron.  You won't get that here - it's just too high-volume.  But, you can't beat the location, the view, and the selection of seafood items on the menu.", "author": "Tom B."}

Acine de Pepe was the dish that looked like rice. It was almost inedible because there was a lot of oil and left as slimy feeling in your mouth. If they weren't so heavy handed with the oil it would have been good because the flavors were really good.\n\nAs for the crab, it was cooked well and the sauce that they cook it in was well seasoned.

The restaurant seems a little dated but it's pretty clean. There are windows all around so the view is great during the day. The service is very good. I had a cup of crab chowder for starters. For my entree, I tried the mussels, shrimp, crab combo which is served on a hot skillet. It doesn't include any sides.  If you're not really hungry, the combo is probably enough to share for two.

My wife had a good time tearing apart a two-pound beast.  I decided on the fish and chips.  Well-prepared and deliciously fried, it was a fun take on the British classic.  The \"chips\" were a bit overdone perhaps from sitting under a warming light a bit too long.  But the fish delivered on flavor and preparation.  The menu is schizophrenic and runs all over the place.  There are crabs, which I recommend, and Italian pastas, steaks and other items from all over the map.\n\nThe service was prompt.  In fact, we were shocked at the speed in which our entrees were delivered to the table.  We never had to ask for water and the wine glasses never ran low.\n\nThe prices are steep.

The items are expensive--small plates run from $15-$24 apiece. The entr\u00e9e had choices from burgers, sizzling seafood platters, to pasta. First off, the waiter was good. He was attentive and quick. We were seated quickly. \n\nSecondly, food--I had the pre-fix $39 meal with clam chowder, salmon with a slight variation of a cioppino sauce, and the ice cream. The bread was extremely hard to break apart so it wasn't a favorite. It could be because it was stale--I don't know but I would think having bread out in the open for awhile would cause the outside to get harder than it should be. The chowder was good--outstanding? No, I've had better walking along the pier. The salmon was delicious--perfectly cooked but the sauce was a bit salty. \n\nNow the dessert --what a disappointment for this quite expensive meal! I've had pre-fixed meals that were not as expensive but the dessert was delicious. But not here. We were served vanilla ice cream in a small water CUP! Nothing grand about it. I stopped eating it after my friend found a chunk of frozen water in her ice cream. Yuck! For such a fancy restaurant they mislead customers about the fancy \"custard\" vanilla ice cream that was reminiscent of a generic grocery store type of ice cream that can be found in a plastic ice cream container. \n\nWould I come back?

They make a great mermarita as well!\nI happen to be allergic to shellfish, I know why go to a crab restaurant, but I always find something on the menu. We ended up with the heirloom tomato bruschetta with the burrata (I think it's called ) it was phenomenal, my new favorite cheese! I also ordered the noodles off the kids menu, who doesn't like noodles with creamy cheese sauce. They made sure to go back and let the chef know I was allergic along with putting in the notes which I thought was very thoughtful. Prices were very fair and I thought the souvenir menu with the recipes is a great idea (I think it was $7). Everyone at the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food and the service! I was a little bummed there were no more souvenir wine glasses so I will be back in a few months and hope to pick some up.", "author": "Brittany S."}

I have never had calimari so good, but that's probably because I come from a landlocked state that doesn't have the freshest seafood. \n\nThe view of the bay was amazing, each table was equipped with binoculars so you can watch boat traffic and get a peak at Alcatraz.\n\nGreat service, delicious food, beautiful view!", "author": "Kassiah W."}

She was really attentive and friendly. She checked on us regularly, tied my bib on me, helped my dungeness crab eating excursion begin, and kept the wet naps coming.\n\nThey serve you some dinner bread with butter. In addition, we ordered the calamari and the surf & turf. It was a whole dungeness crab as well as steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes with a short rib. It was $60, and I think it was worth it. The crab was already cleaned out, so it was really easy. It was buttery and tasted just divine. It was also fun to eat. I don't eat beef, but I was told that the meat was worth $25.\n\nThe one thing is, if you don't like crustaceans, don't go here. They basically look like they were plopped from the ocean to the pot. They still have their crab fur on their legs and shell. They are crawling at this place (see what I did there?). But, it seemed like everyone went there for the crab.\n\nThe decor is really tacky/vintage/charming with amazing views of the bay. It has floor to ceiling windows that span 3 sides of the restaurant. \n\nOh, and did I mention that they also have heated patio seating?", "author": "Kira W."}

I was told that this restaurant had been here a while and it certainly looked and felt so. It was as if I was transported back in time to the 1950's (and not in a good way mind you). The place is in desperate need of a face lift to either achieve the nostalgic ambience it is so desperately trying to maintain or to bring it into the modern era.  The food was ridiculously over priced.  For two people, a half serving of Dungeons Crab (two pieces), a chicken fettuccine Alfredo dish (which left much to be desired) , two Sprites and a shared desert amounted to a bill of $111.00.  Not worth it.", "author": "Dennis J."}

I normally don't feel strongly enough about things to post, but my experience tonight pushed me over the edge.  The service was horrible.  Maybe it was the fact that this was our 3rd straight night at expensive San Francisco restaurants with horrible service. Our server Jose (poor young man with terrible facial hair but the beginnings of a fantastic combover) was the worst. The food was not the problem. We ordered the crab Louie and the salmon with spicy cioppino sauce. They were good choices. Maybe it was the fact we brought our kids for our daughters birthday dinner. Or maybe it was because we had a half hour wait and ordered a bottle of wine from the bar and closed out our tab. In any event, Combover Jose took our order and never came back to the table. Our crab chowders and entrees came out at the same time.  Maybe that was the kitchen's fault. I was a server for years and understand those issues.  But he never came back to see that we didn't have them first.  He never filled our wine glasses. He never refilled the waters.  In any event, the view was great and the food was good, so service is obviously not a priority.  I won't be back. I recommend you avoid it too.", "author": "Neal C."}

It was also the closest and we were hungry, so we decided to just come and grab some food.\n\nThe lower level is a much more causal seating and dining place while the upper level is more on the fancy side (I think). Because I wanted to try something new so I got the Shrimp and Chips instead of the usual Fish and Chips. My friends also got the Clam Chowder and the Crabwich, respectively. We wanted to get a bunch of things and to share and to try them all. We quickly ordered up front and just waited for the serves to call our numbers. It wasn't long before our orders were out, which was nice.\n\nWhen we got our food, I was a little disappointed at my own plate of Shrimp an Chips. I thought the Shrimps would be battered shrimps, which it technically was. But these shrimps were the tiny shrimps unlike what I had thought: the bigger, jumbo sized shrimps. I was pretty upset when I saw it and I kind of lost my appetite because I was just so sad looking at those tiny shrimps. But it was decent. The fries were okay, too. \n\nOnto the other food, the clam chowder was actually pretty good! I had a few bites and they were yummy. The crabwich, on the other hand, was a little disappointing. It was a cold sandwich. We kind of thought that it would be a crab patty, but I guess not. It was like a crab salad with two buns holding the salad in place. It had a weird taste in my opinion, and definitely not the greatest thing ever. \n\nI don't think I would be coming back. Maybe for the claw chowder and the Fish and Chips (someone else had that and it actually looked decent). But I would rather go to another place if I was in the area again.", "author": "Wendy Y."}

If you want to impress people from out of town, or for a special occasion, this is where you want to go (along with The View in downtown SF). This place has better food though.\n\nThis was the last night for a lot of friends I met at the Game Developers Conference this year and their reservation here was a great call. During peak season, I can't imagine how long the wait would be. Even in March, the second dinner time hit, the place filled up fast.\n\nWe ordered oysters, several rounds of cocktails, their signature crab, and various other dishes of seafood. The crab was delicious, as were a lot of the fish dishes. The oysters were great, but a little expensive for local fare. The cocktails were also good, but I'd recommend finding your favorite liquor (like Whiskey), and asking for that with a few rocks. The pours are generous - almost like how I pour 'em at home. \n\nDinner and drinks for a dozen game developers came out to over 1K. Pricey, but the ambience and quality are worth it. \n\nHopefully you stay on the Wharf after a night here, because if not and you party like it's 1999, you're going to be rocked out of your mind. Fortunately, cabs are waiting almost always waiting outside. My guess is that they've been here before, as well.", "author": "Byron E."}

I dined at this restaurant with my spouse and friends. We ordered the shrimp and crab combo. The crab and shrimp were warm, at best, and saturated in butter when the waiter delivered the meal to our table.  The crab and shrimp lacked natural flavor. We are optimistic people who give people the benefit of the doubt, so we figured that was the best the restaurant could do and we didn't complain. As our meal neared completion, we heard the sizzle and crackle (like tandoori meat) of the neighboring table's order. We peeked at their meal and, to our surprise, we discovered that they had ordered the same meal as my husband and myself. At that moment my spouse and Myself realized that our food was warm and saturated with butter because it had been sitting. It's likely that the server waited until all of our meals were complete before bringing the meals to the table. The waiter was unapologetic and did not acknowledge the difference in service provided to both tables. I do not recommend this restaurant because the quality and preparation of the seafood is poor and the quality of service is sub par, as well.

After a huge debate I settled on the sizzling seafood platter with mussels and shrimp. BF decided on the crab alfredo. The complimentary sourdough bread was very hard. Our food came out fairly quick though... probably in 15 minutes. My seafood platter was cooked nicely but was a tad bit salty with the soy sauce. I wish it came with a side or something to really make it a meal. BF was very disappointed in his crab alfredo because the portion size was very small.

The bread that they brought up front with butter was not fresh at all, as a matter of fact it was hard to chew on. You would think that if they are charging so much for every other dish they would at least have the courtesy of providing fresh warm bread up front (negative!). \nAfter seeing the prices my wife and I decided to share half an order of crabs and a cup of chowder. The cup of chowder was flavorful and quantity was ok, it was $15 (still pricey, but I would say still ok). The half order of crab was quite literally half a crab for $30. We lived in Baltimore for 6 years and we know crabs, this half crab had nothing on steamed crabs from a Shack in Baltimore. It came on a garlic sauce that was OK, but for $30 the quantity nor the quality was really there! (Failure!!)\nI also ordered a mermarita (or something like that), which was there take of an orange margarita and it was close to $15 too. All in all we spent pretty much $70 for what can be considered a couple of appetizers and a drink. WAY TOO MUCH for what it really was (I mean, there was not even a guy playing the piano or any type of live entertainment to compliment the high prices).\nMy recommendation is to go around the corner and you will find fantastic crab chowder on the bread bowl and it will be much much cheaper than this place. The service was not bad but nothing special either. \nWay overpriced and over rated! Will NEVER come back (not even if money is not an issue).", "author": "Ricardo M."}

We wanted to enjoy a \"fancy dinner\" one night and chose Franciscan. We dressed up and were excited to eat some nice seafood. Our experience was AWFUL! Our waitress was not helpful with questions regarding the menu and showed an extreme lack of customer appreciation; not friendly at all. We all decided to share a full crab (very pricey) and mashed potatoes. When it arrived at the table I asked for butter. She said \"which kind?\" Confused I asked, \"well what kinds do you have?\" She just said \"I'll just bring them all.\" When she brought them we asked what one of the butter's ingredients were and she just stated that she didn't know and didn't offer to find out. We had to ask for our waters to be filled-the restaurant was not busy at all and she only checked on us about 2-3 times over the course of 1.5 hours. The food got cold immediately and the crab was not flavorful and I was told it was not even from California, but Seattle! As I was still trying to finish my meal, (my only motivation was because of the expense, not flavor) one of the employees came over to me and asked if I was done as my fork was actively getting food off my plate! We asked our waitress to speak to a manager and after we were all done eating she came over and let us know what was in the butter after we complained to try and redeem herself. The manager finally came after an extended period of time and we let her know how incredibly disappointed we were with our waitress as well as the food. She told us that our waitress was \"the best waitress they have.\" (Ha!) And she didn't even offer to compensate any of our meal to make up for the awful experience. The waitress made one last appearance to start clearing our table and didn't even apologize.

Left a message and called all day to receive a recorded message all day. We asked our concierge at our hotel to try and she got through and they no longer had tables. We decide to go and put our name in and waited 40 minutes for a table. We had a nice table in the corner by the window and in looking around I was shocked by how dirty the windows and kinda run down the place was. Our waitperson was unprofessional and odd. I ordered the crab and it was flavorless and cost $50. The clam chowder was good. I did not care for the crab chowder. My daughter ordered the filet and got the short ribs. I paid $430 for 6 people, received below average service, below average food in a clearly dirty restaurant. All in all a huge disappointment. I will never go back. Oh and I hadn't mentioned that in the very small wait area there is a beautiful butcherblock buffet for slicing bread. It was not clear if this was for customers to slice off some bread while you wait especially where it's located. A few customers took a knife and sliced a few pieces. A few of the staff noticed and told them to stop. Another unsuspecting patron helped himself and an angry waiter came and picked up the knife threw it and the bread in the drawer, slammed it very hard and used profanity directed at the customer. There is not one sign to tell people that the bread is not for customers or to not \"help yourself.\" I wish I would have left right then and there.", "author": "Mary M."}

The upscale ambiance, especially the black and white retro decor is so cool. Even the walls lined with pictures of celebrities from one end of the place to the other is historic. Perfect for any special occasion and very spacious. Although the food is a little bit pricey, the dining experience is definitely worth the splurge and views memorable. Great place for taking tons of pictures and enjoying beautiful romantic sunsets.\n\nFor starters, make sure to order the crab cippiono which is a San Francisco original and staple dish. You get a generous amount of crab meat and rich broth is so flavorful and tasty. If you're a cheese lover then make sure to try crab fondue. The Swiss chard, Italian fontaine cheese and heaping amount crab meat is sweet, savory and delectable. Compliment that with their bread and you got a great scrumptious start to your meal.\n\nSince your here for the seafood, I suggest that you get the 2 pounds of crabs served with their secret garlic rub and butter sauce which is awesome. Roll up your sleeves and put on those bib cause it gets kinda messy. It requires a little work picking through all that crab meat, but definitely worth every morsel of goodness and finger licking good. The crab sandwiches are also great. Good amounts of crab meats, tasty and satisfying.\n\nIf you still have room for dessert and craving sweets, I suggest Verona chocolate sundae and chocolate truffle mouse cake. I was fortunate enough to try both with family and friends which we all shared. So decadent and sinful. You might need to spend a week at the gym.\n\nFranciscan is truly a great experience and I would definitely come back again.\n\nParking - 1hr free validation", "author": "Leo C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-16", "description": "Came back here after the positive experience last time, and what a disappointment it was! There has been a significant decline in both the quantity and quality of crab served.\n\nFirst, the quantity. My wife and I ordered the \"lotsa crab\" which is supposed to be 3+ pounds, for 2 people to share. Basically it's supposed to be 1.5 whole crabs, or 15 legs (each crab has 2 claws and 8 legs for a total of 10). The problem is that they served just the legs, and not the main body of the crab. Most of the meat on a crab is located where the legs meet the main body, and those parts were missing. And our platter didn't even have 15 legs anyways. When I called the server over, she proceeded to start counting crab legs. She got to 9, plus the 2 we had already eaten, plus 2 more that were sitting on our plates. She figured that it was \"close enough.\" Well, maybe I should just leave $60 on the table for a $70 bill since it's \"close enough\"? Bottom line, I know crab and I know how much crab corresponds to how much weight. There is no freaking way that what we were served would come close to 3 pounds, even before cooking. And there is no freaking way that we were served 15 legs.\n\nTo the server's credit, she allowed us to change our order and have it remade. We downgraded to a whole crab, which was pretty good in quantity (the legs were bigger and more full of meat). However, we now move on to the issue of quality. They have changed the recipe since last time (late 2014), and the change has been for the worse. It seems that the new recipe is geared towards convenience for the typical customer (tourists?). The crab comes out of the kitchen faster (suspiciously fast, in fact - it was most likely fried beforehand and quickly reheated), but lukewarm instead of sizzling hot. After finishing the first two legs, the rest of the crab was cold. There's also less sauce, which leaves your hands clean, but at the cost of less tasty crab. I remember having my hands slathered over with delicious garlic sauce last time - quite a mess, but worth it for the taste. This time, we didn't even need to use the plastic bib provided, but I'd way rather have to clean up in the restroom than pay premium prices for cold, tasteless crab.\n\nOh, and we also ordered some mussels. They also came out lukewarm and quickly went cold. Highly disappointing!", "author": "Bo D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-12", "description": "Came here for a fancy date dinner because my bf knows I love crab, and left disappointed in the crab. I grew up in the PNW eating fresh caught Dungeness crab, and definitely received a different crab product than I expected. What I expect from crab: tender, juicy, and sweet. What I got was crab cooked in butter and served steaming hot. It was: a little over cooked so not quite as tender as I expected, not juicy at all besides the butter juice, which tastes like butter and not delicious crab, and savory!!! The savory part was what got to me the most! The food was still good, but it just didn't taste like crab. And my date was spending a lot of $$$ for crab - I expected it to ya know taste like fresh crab. \n \nAnyways, I was still happy eating my hot buttery crab, if a bit confused. But after brooding for a while, I decided to bring the issue up to my server. \"Um... Excuse me. But the way this crab is prepared is a bit odd. It's still good, I guess, but I just am not sure why it was cooked in butter? The butter is overwhelming the crab. It tastes savory, and I sort of expect my crab to be sweet...\" To which he responded \"well Dungeness crab is supposed to be savory, it's blue crab that's sweet. Have you ever had Dungeness crab before.\" Unfortunately I don't have a picture of my face at that moment, but imagine the face of the mean girl in middle school when you invited her to your first boy girl, bowling themed, birthday party. A little disgust, mixed with a little astonishment, mixed with a little bemusement. Even though my expression spoke volumes, I was still quick to tell him that I in fact grew up eating Dungeness crab, fresh from the ocean, caught by my dad. And then he seemed to realize his mistake, and so mumbled that we should order the steamed crab next time and ran away. \n\nWell ok then, thought me and the honey, guess we should order steamed crab next time. And for the rest of the evening I was happy. (It was a good night!) but the more and more I think about how stupid that lie was the angrier I get. I also feel like the servers should be trained to let customers know how the crab is prepared, I can't remember if it is mentioned in the menu, but I know that even if it is we didn't notice it. Even if that's how they want to cook their crab, it's super unusual and should be noted!!!\n\nAs for the rest of the food: We also had the shrimp (we ordered the lotsa shrimp, lotsa crab platter (I think that what it's called)) and as an appetizer we had the octopus c-something Italian-. We also both ordered cocktails before dinner, and then split the chocolate mousse for dessert. The appetizer was really good, and I would recommend it. The shrimps were decent. They were also served sizzling and cooked in butter like the crab but that works with shrimp, although I do think they were a little over cooked. The cocktails were decent. The chocolate mousse was really good. \n\nAmbience wise, while the decoy is a little quirky, the view is super nice. The service, besides the weird and blatant lie, was good. They were quick and responsive. I might come back or recommend just by virtue of the nice view and location, but if I ever do come back I will be very specific about how I want my crab!\n\n\nA post note, I have actually been having a dream about that crab. In it I grab the cooks collar, bring him close to my face, shake him a little and tell him this: \"For gods sake if you love your goddamn butter sauce so much, cook the freaking tilapia in it!

I am not a seafood person at all - just the occasional shrimp dumplings or crab cakes however, this particular sandwich caught my eye as I walked by and I am glad I stopped by. \n\nService was super friendly. I liked that the guy that took my order was cheerful and commended me on ordering the ginormous sandwich for myself. I also ordered the macaroni and cheese for my little one. \n\nThe wait was probably 5 minutes. I grabbed a table overlooking the ocean. It was nice out but a little too windy to my liking but enjoyed and ate away, nonetheless. My sister ordered shrimp and chips and a clam chowder. I don't know how her selections tasted but she tried a bite of my sandwich and couldn't believe how good it was. The fish was flaky, fresh and the batter was fried to perfection. What I love most: the slaw. I did not care for the tiny ass roll that it came on but that maybe just my preference. I did not need any condiments as the sandwich was both flavorful and a tad tangy due to the slaw. I was so sad to box the other half home but you see, I started my \"eating only half\" quest that day so I had to adhere to it. \n\nNext to us was a guy that ordered the same thing. He was sitting alone, my sister took a slight interest but was too afraid to go up to talk to him. Results? I talked to him and opened the line of communication. I left for the restroom which was somewhat clean (always have sanitizer w/ you) but I found out after that she failed to get his contact information. \n\nAs we walked out, so did he. He went into the tourist gift shop next door and looked back at me but hell no am I going to follow him for the sake of my sister. If anything, they are both chicken! \n\nBack to my review. This place is awesome. \n\nTip: get the Famous Fishwich!!!", "author": "Tram N."}

This place is right on the water at Fisherman's Wharf. The entire wall facing the bay is a huge glass window with a panoramic view of the bay and Alcatraz Island that can be seen from almost every table in the place. It was very clean and was decorated in a style that reminded me somewhat of a 1950's art deco Hollywood hot spot. \n\nOur waiter (I wish I could remember his name, I think it was Eduardo) was great. Very friendly and personable, knowledgeable of the menu and just super professional on all fronts. \n\nWe started our experience with 2 cocktails. A perfect dirty martini on the rocks and a Midori sour which was good (takes talent to mess up that drink anyway). \n\nI ordered the whole dungeness crab, which was picture-perfect and cooked just right, served with a delicious garlic butter sauce. My date had the sea bass in a spicy cioppino tomato sauce that was also absolutely delicious. For a side we ordered these deep fried pearl onions which were everything that you ever wanted onion rings to be, only better... consisting of thick sweet hardy onion bites surrounded by a tasty thin batter. \n\nWhen the bill came it was as expensive, as we thought it would be, but definitely worth every penny!", "author": "Stacy S."}

Even though it is pretty pricey, the food here is absolutely worth it. I usually start with a plate of calamari and an order of clam chowder in a bread bowl. The calamari is delicious, and the clam chowder is probably the best I've had on the Wharf. We then usually proceed to order a 'crab feast,' which is a huge portion of Dungeness crab legs meant for 4 to share. Again, cooked just right and seasoned with some sort of garlicky buttery goodness that just hits the spot and fills us up every time. Granted, it takes some work to actually procure the crab meat from out of the shell, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty, the food is more than worth the work. Plus, what's more satisfying than licking those fingers clean after a hard dinner's work? The service is always great and never disappoints. The bonus? This place is situated right on the bay with stunning views of Alcatraz and the rest of the bay. Perfect place for a celebratory meal.\n\nPs: the butter here is amazing.", "author": "Zane K."}

But honestly, I'm not sure if we even received the \"Double\" because it didn't look like it. The shrimp wasn't anything special, it was regular size shrimp if not smaller? Everything was spread over a hot steaming pan. The crab tasted OK and the shrimp was okay.

Two guys ran the bar for a 3/4 full house, without delay, the whole time we were there.\n\n7:55 PM: Second round.\n\n8:10 PM: After deciding to order food at the bar afterall, we're brought a bread basket and place settings. To be honest the woman next to us when we sat down was eating crabs so we were doomed from the beginning.\n\n8:20 PM: She orders seafood combo (mussels, shrimp, crabs) and I order fish and chips. \n\n8:22 PM: Bartender brings over crab crackers, bibs, wetnaps, shell bowl, little fork. \n\n8:40 PM: Food arrives. We eat and chat with a nice woman from SoCal next to us. \n\n9:25 PM: I get a third drink. It's vacation whatev. \n\n9:55 PM: Settle up and leave. \n\n$$$ - 118. Seafood combo, fish and chips, two draft pilsners, two mixed drinks, and a Corona. \n\nDrinks - Blood orange mermerita. Basically a tequila sunrise with lime and lemon instead of grenadine. Our bartender was the man. One con is that the bar tab doesn't transfer to the table tab. Eh. \n\nFood - Seafood combo was overall great. Came out on a huge sizzling iron skillet. Crabs were excellent, mussels were slightly overcooked but good, and the shrimp were overcooked (shrimp flavor washed out by garlic). Fish and chips came with a huge piece of fish and was very filling. While both were very satisfying and delicious, I'm not quite convinced their prices were justified. \n\nService - Ate at the bar so this review is limited, but it was very fast and our bartenders were friendly. Not too talkative, but whatever. \n\nAmbiance - Very classy 50's throwback with black and white photos covering the walls, red vinyl upholstery, marble tabletops, dim-ish lighting with warm red fill. The real kicker for this place is the bay view. ~15-20ft windows cover the entire bayside wall giving you an excellent view. There is even a heated open porch seating area for nice nights.\n\nEDIT: Franciscan was a high 4 to begin with, but any business owner that will follow-up on and consider their patron's experience (as documented on Yelp!) gets a 5th star in my book!", "author": "James R."}

After feeling ripped off by the Golden Gate bakery, my hubby and i were feeling guilty and was hoping for a semi-modest dinner. This was not the place for that haha. P.S. I didn't see anyone eating the free bread - it was not very good and felt like it could chip my tooth if I wasn't careful. \n\nThe food:  \n1) Yellow Tail Carpaccio - the fish was fresh, and perfect with the ponzu sauce. I could have eaten two orders of this by myself and this alone made the meal for me. \n\n2) Cioppino - the marinara sauce was perfect. The crab, clams, and mussels were really good. If I get this again, I'll try to ask for no fish fillet pieces, shrimp or calamari rings. Those took away from the actual eating part more than adding to it although I'm sure they helped make the marinara richer and tastier. I got the regular size (the smallest one) which was bigger than the picture. I could not finish it due to the size. I would not miss the bread slice that it came with.\n\n2) Sourdough bowl - It was ok. Too baconey (the taste) for me. I prefer the seafood and cream aftertaste more than bacon for my chowder.

We also ordered some bread and dipped that in the sauce that the crab was drenched in and that was delicious.\n\nIt was pretty pricey though. It's a restaurant that caters to tourist so I understand the price surge but the dish we had was almost $60. It says that the portion is for two but it barely filled the two of us. We had to go get something else to eat not long afterwards. There's other less expensive options like salads, sandwiches, and small plates. But if you want crab, be prepared to spend at least $25 per person.\n\nOther than that the food was good, the staff was friendly, and the view was amazing. \n\nThe only thing that I didn't like was that when I tried to call in for a reservation for our party the phone was kept busy for over half an hour! I don't know if they purposely kept the phone off the hook or if there was only one line and it was being used the entire time I tried calling but I ended up using OpenTable to reserve a table.\n\nI don't know if I'll be back since I wasn't wowed and for the money that was spent I could be getting better food elsewhere where I'll actually get full for under $60.", "author": "CK G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-08-27", "description": "I have a theory about restaurants in touristy areas: they don't feel they need repeat customers, because most visitors are, almost by definition, unfamiliar with the neighborhood.  Situated right on the coast in the busiest part of one of the busiest tourist attractions on the West Coast, this place is VERY touristy.  But I really wanted to sit down and have some of San Francisco's famous dungeness crab, touristiness be damned.\n\nThe menu had a little bit of everything, but not a whole lot of one particular thing.  We all started off with Cokes.  An eternity or two later, we were finally able to put in our order.\n\nI had noticed they had oysters in the cold appetizers section, so I decided to have just a few.  If you eat oysters even on rare occassions, you'd probably know that oysters come in countless varieties: they have different shapes, sizes, and levels of plumpness, brininess, etc.  So when I asked the waitress what kind of oysters they serve, and she said, \"fresh-shucked and raw,\" I could tell they don't specialize in these delicous little mollusks... But I trudged ahead anyways.\n\nI also ordered the clam chowder and the whole dungeness crab.\n\nReally, the food wasn't bad.  I couldn't really taste the clam chowder, though, because they never actually brought it to my table.  (The server blamed it on a computer error, but had she checked on us after they brought our food to the table, this could've been easily resolved.)  The crab was delicious as expected, and I already want more.\n\nThe view was also spectacular.  Our table was right by the window, providing us unchecked views of the entire bay surrounding the wharf.\n\nWhy two stars?  Well, that takes us back to the \"touristy\" thing... The food was passable, but nothing to justify the price tag (crab, Coke, and oysters cost me something like $52 plus tip).  The service was horrendous: none of us had our drinks refilled, despite verbally requesting refills.  I tipped a below-average 17% or so, but only because the server cut my crab for me.  If this restaurant were located anywhere but the busiest place in the city, frequented by people looking for the exact item they built their restaurant around, they would be out of business.  Because they probably have very few repeat customers.", "author": "Jeremy P."}

The clam chowder had a thick tasteless broth with very little clam in it. I couldn't finish it. My coworker's large crab sandwich was filled with crab and a slaw which completely obliterated the delicate taste of the crab. He also left most of it on his plate. I had already purchased a beignet.

Maybe it's the homeless populations on the streets that clear the pigeons for me as I walk through the Tenderloin. Or maybe, I'm soooo done with the LA life, it's not even funny! Whatever it is, my old boss, Harry Williams said, \"Leena, you may be moving back to the Southern California sun, but you'll be back...this city gets in your blood\". And 5 years later, here I am, back in my city! Watch out for the new duchess in town ;) \n\n\nSo let me start by sharing one of my favorite eats in town. This place makes ditching my 2200 square-foot house for a 200 square-foot matchbox studio ALL WORTH IT! The Franciscan Crab Restaurant! Maybe cuz it has \"Franciscan\" in the name! I first came here with my cousin and sister. After we ate the crab, we were just so happy. See attached picture. We weren't sure what it was but the only common denominator was the crab! I call it... \"The Loopy Crab\". I'm not sure what those crabs were doing in the San Francisco Waters but they were seasoned so perfectly with lemon zest, butter, pepper, and pure deliciousness! I returned again and the crab just made me so happy again! See attached picture...again. \n\nLastly, the service is great, and the view of Alcatraz is breathtaking. Home. Sweet.

She finally returned to take our order and we ordered the calamari (which was impeccable and the highlight of the meal) and she went ahead and took our dinner order as well. Dinner came out before we were half way through the app. My colleague had the Basa which she said was good and I had the crab enchiladas. They were underwhelming with being on the cold side, the tortilla was soggy and chewy and there were large pieces of shell inside.

We had the combo mussels, shrimps and carb. Mussel was delicious with the garlic sauce they had.

My boyfriend ordered the seafood alfredo which was also equally amazing especially when paired with the sourdough bread. \n\nThe portions are quite large so we weren't able to finish our meals, but we were happy with our delicious dinner!

I'm missing out on a lot of good stuff from what a lot of people tell me.  Anyways, if I find myself at seafood place, then I tend to eat non-seafood stuff which defeats the purpose of going to a seafood place.  \n\nThe restaurant was big and almost every table had a view of the bay.  The menus were in a form of a cookbook which was different from what I usually see.  I think the menu had pictures of almost every single dish so that's always helpful when deciding what to order.  The service was fast and the waiter was helpful when we asked him about things on the menu.\n\nWe ordered the Grilled Onion and Cheese Short Rib Sandwich ($14.95), the Spicy Prawns ($19.95), the Lotsa Crab ($49.95), and two Clam Chowders in the Sourdough Bread Bowl ($9.95 each).  It wasn't long before we got our orders.  The Clam Chowder tasted good to me and that probably got me a little full before my meal came.  I tried some crab but stopped after a few bites. lol  The Grilled Onion and Cheese Short Rib Sandwich was okay and I barely finished it all thanks to the Clam Chowder.\n\nI thought this place was okay but I won't be back for awhile since I don't go to Pier 39 or even SF, in general, very often.", "author": "Daniel H."}

When in SF in crab season from late November till they run out around march I think... you need to get some of this local awesome eats. \n\nNow yes, this is tourist central.  But it's also the home of the crab.  The boats you see are real not fake Disneyland replicas.  They are fishing crab and pulling them in right here. Eat local.  Right.  This be as local as you can get!   So why not indulge in history and partake.  \n\nThe Franciscan is a classic of architecture on the outside. And the inside is a bit odd with a fancy diner type feeling.  An awesome view of the bay from every seat just adds another reason to eat here.\n\nNow some people may complain about this and that, but why order other dishes in a place known for its fresh crab.  So make it simple.    Get the crab on the skillet with the secret garlic butter sauce.  You have to work for your meal so crack away.  The sauce it the perfect balance of spice, butter and garlic.   You dont need much on your crab meat because you want to taste the nice sweet tender crab.  But take some of that nice fresh sourdough bread and soak up the sauce, scraping the bits of char off the hot skillet with the bread.  Thats the ticket right there.  Ohhhhh yeah baby! \n\nNow Im sure some of their other dishes are just fine and maybe even really good.  They have one of those menus with photos of all the food for all the foreign tourists, but some of them looked quite good.  But lets circle back to the world of Dungeness.\n\nI've had crab in all the best places and this is right up there with the best, no doubt.  \n\nAlso had a crab louie salad for those who dont like to \"work\" for their meal.  It was a nice presentation and quite good and again, I've had many a louie.  Starter house salad was also great, nice butter lettuces with some thin sliced avocados, heirloom cherry tomatoes, shaved onions with a nice vinegarette.  Dressing was a bit on the heavy side for my liking but not a deal killer.\n\nOur server Bianca was on top of everything with a great smile, and attitude, and there to please.  She brought us extra garlic sauce for dipping cause she saw how much we were moping it up with the bread.  So, spot on top service from her I would applaud.\n\nTo be honest ,  I was fearing a tourist trap not so good experience but it turned out I  was in crab heaven ecstasy very quickly with not a regret in sight. \n\nAlso being an older designed place it was not super loud where you have to yell to hear your eating buddies that are two feet away.  I almost forgot what being able to hear in a restaurant was like.  Kudos!  And to top it off,  the parking lot right in front was FREE for three hours with validation at the restaurant.  Free parking in San Francisco!  Holy crab claws!   \n\nBorn to crack crab and never look back.", "author": "Bruce M."}

Personally though, I've had better shrimp for less money, and the server wasn't overly pleasant.\n\nOverall, great place for a decent meal with by far the best view of the Bay and Alcatraz, but if all you are interested in is seafood quality, there are plenty of other options available for you.\n\nPro: Fantastic Views and Iconic Building\nCons: Limited menu unless an absolute seafood connoisseur, mixed service quality.", "author": "Christopher L."}

We ordered a salad and split it four ways; it's was quite large and had lots of great greens and veggies, not that blah iceberg. Then we all shared one of the extra large sizzling platters with three kinds of seafood, the seafood and pasta, and the crab enchiladas. Everything was good and the flavors were subtle and unique to each dish. Service was friendly and quick. Fairly noisy and energetic place. Sunset is a perfect time to dine here.

This place was very clean and professional, not to mention classy and yet not overly pretentious. \n\nMy table had a direct view of Alcatraz, which felt lucky. They weren't very busy at all for lunch on a holiday weekend, I guess because the competition is pretty fierce. I guess it would categorize as a little \"spendy\" at about $25 for a generous serving of crab which were apparently market prices at the time.

We had oysters to start off with and they did not even know where they came from and they were the size of a dime. We drove up to Napa and had the greatest oysters for the same price that were very big. Also they gave us one with an almost empty shell. They tasted like fish, and the meals were very small. Nothing was fresh and it looked like it was previously frozen. Terrible tourist area. Restaurant was dead and others complained as well. We have eaten at many places in Fisherman's wharf and it has been delicious, but this place was terrible. Do not go here! It's so expensive and a waste of money.

It will feed 2 comfortably, if it's an intimate setting or date, this is a wonderful place to introduce your girl/guy to SF and what is preserved here. I am a local 100% and I have only been here twice in my life. And each time is a unique experience to say the least. Set a reservation, it will be packed to the wall with people, especially tourists with having this uniquely exquisite dining experience. Start off with delicious Sourdough and butter, slow down rodeo king, you want to keep room in the tire, this bread is good, and will get you going. Second the bar, ok, it's small, tiny, no room to walk around, and most likely you will be standing with your drink if you are waiting for a table, but once you turn around, BAM the view, Treasure Island, Golden Gate Bridge, The SF Bay calm waters, tour boats, Hornblower, Black and Gold and dining cruise boats at your face in the open Bay gigantic romantic sexy windows. Then by the time you realize your hip is buzzing from the page to sit down, after a very stiff drink with mint(suggestion here people!), you always get a view of the gargantuan bay windows and a sexy exotic view of one of the most romantic cities in the USA. Then comes dinner, Crab, delicious Garlic Sauce, service so good, they crack your crab for you if you wish, they put a bib on you, and bon-a-petit. Ahh fresh crab, ask for lemon if you are not used to fresh crab, or you will pay later(Zinc/Iron is strong padiwan!). Ok lastly, you will leave full, content, and extremely happy. This is unique, cherish your dinner, who knows how long the Franciscan will be here. Your walk in and out, you will see the legends of past who were here, make sure you WALK out to see these treasured gems of legends of music, media, entertainment. Then you have the Pier, Wharf, among countless walking and touring to venture and walk off that full tub of a rollo you called a stomach before dashing into a tantalizing meal...Enjoy a treasure of The Golden Gate!", "author": "Phil H."}

We were talking and was almost finishing the food, but they just came right in and cleaned our table. Because the crab plate was big, they were busy cleaning. And then they asked us if they could get away all the silver wears, and I couldn't say no so I said sure. I mean, why were they in such a hurry? They could at least wait for us until the time they bring the check. The restaurant was getting less busy, but they were the only busy bees in the restaurant.

The restaurant is HUGE and decorated nicely and has the amazing view that nearly everyone mentions in their review.  Everyone who worked at the restaurant, with the exception of the non-verbal woman at the host desk, was pleasant and helpful.\n\nAmong the four of us, we had crab cakes, a crab sandwich, pasta with crab and a tureen of shrimp pescatore.  I was the lucky recipient of the pescatore, which was so good!  Really garlicky and spicy tomato sauce, filled with perfectly cooked shrimp.  The pasta with crab featured tons of crab, but was a little too heavy so that was boxed up to take home.  The crab cakes had a lot of bread added, and was served just plain on the plate - no tartar sauce or any other kind of sauce, and no lemon or garnish.in sight.  The crab sandwich was pretty basic, but my stepmother enjoyed it, and that's all that counts.\n\nThe really weak part of the meal were the salads.  They were comprised mostly of iceberg lettuce  and the greens weren't dried properly, which means that they were super wet and diluted the dressing.  Not only that, they were plated so messily - really amateurish.  For $7 for the house salad, and $12 for the blue cheese salad, you expect something that looked a little nicer.\n\nDessert was their frozen kustard, and was absolutely delicious.  Cocktails were big and strong too - yum!\n\nAll in all, a great place for Christmas lunch.  I just wish the salads had been better and the hostess nicer.", "author": ".Hon H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-24", "description": "The Franciscan was quite possibly the worst restaurant experience of my life. \n\nWe were recommended to the restaurant by the host at The Crab House on Pier 39 because their wait was about 2 hours for our large group (8 people).  None of us had been to San Francisco before and of course wanted to experience the seafood, especially the famous dungeness crab.  Surprisingly, we were seated right away at The Franciscan but now I know why they had so much availability. \n\nNow, I can usually deal with sub-par service but when coupled with awful food, it makes the experience ten times worse.  Our server was quite rude.  In the beginning, she seemed like a great server and took our drink/bar orders right away.  But as soon as we asked for water as well as our other drinks, things started going down hill.  She did not re-fill our waters or ask if we needed more drinks once throughout the whole dinner, which later on would have helped to down the disgusting food. \n\nI had asked her if they had a plate with JUST the crab legs.  She suggested I get the whole crab and that she or the kitchen would cut it up so that it was only legs. so that is what I ordered.  When my food came, the crab was whole.  I waited TEN minutes for our server to even come back to our table after we received our food to ask about it being cut up.  I know it sounds petty but I don't know how to eat whole crab and didn't want a mess.  Typically when you receive your food, a server is to check on your food to make sure everyone got their correct meal and it is tasting right (i know this because I was a country club restaurant manager for several years).  When she finally came back she rolled her eyes and said she completely forgot and will get it taken care of. \n\nThe food.  My crab was BURNT. As if the kitchen had placed it in the broiler for too long to heat it up. Some of the skin was blackened it was so burnt.  The crab meat tasted like it was boiled in plain water with no seasonings.  When I asked the waiter if they had any sauce or seasonings, she said no. What restaurant doesn't have seasonings or sauce?\n\nI can't specifically speak for the rest of my party but the general consensus was their food was sub-par as well. \n\nAt that point, we just wanted to get our check and leave.  When we asked the server for our check, she asked if \"we wanted the check split or all in one\".  Usually with a big group they wont split it, so we were happily surprised it was offered, so we asked her to split the check. Well our server didn't like that and got a serious attitude as said \"Fine, it's going to take awhile then to get your checks, I am super busy\".  wow. When she brought our checks we all just gave her our credit cards but she said she couldn't take them right away because \"she has a lot of other tables she needs to help first\". wow. \n\nWe then tried to get the attention of the manager because things were just out of hand and we thought he should know.  We did not want anything for free or any special treatment but just thought he should be aware the way his restaurant was being operated. He ignored us the first time and when he finally came over to us, he was also rude.  He got very defensive and said that if he had been made aware of this from the beginning of our meal, he could have fixed it. We explained that things just went downhill and that we just wanted to let him know.  He did not want to hear it and was very snotty. \n\nWe all just left and I requested the name and email of their general manager. \n\nI'm sure not all of the servers are like this but for what it's worth, the food is definitely not worth ANY of your time.", "author": "Ashley B."}

I liked the atmosphere and food.  It was also easy to order what you like because the entire menu has a picture for each food item.  So at least you know what it looks like if you were to order an odd ball entree.  \n\nFresh seafood served daily.  We had the raw osyters and fried calamari for appetizers. As for the entree, we ordered crabs and a crab sandwich.  I loved the crab sandwich a definite RECOMMENDATION, it was packed with Dungeness crabs, every bite I took was a mouthful of crab so this place does not skimp out on the stuff.  \n\nWe didn't get around to desserts but there are plenty of other places to go for desserts around the area.", "author": "Louie A."}

The booth we sat in, while it did have a nice view, was filthy and had remnants of crab and bread from those who must have previously dined in those seats. Our server, I cannot recall his name (obvious indication of lack of personality and hospitable demeanor), was prompt with greeting but our drinks took roughly ten minutes to arrive back at our table with said drinks. And the drinks! I ordered some kind of bourbon strawberry mint concoction that was terribly watered down (probably from sitting for ten minutes at the service well) and did not taste good. We ordered crabcakes and clam chowder to start. Crabcakes were small and unexceptional. Clam chowder: unexceptional. Now here is where I probably made a terrible mistake: I ordered pasta and a caesar salad as my entree. I know, I know...go to a seafood restaurant and order pasta: rookie mistake. But I was craving. Pasta alfredo was overcooked and so gelatinous it was sticking together in a pasty, gooey pasta blob. I asked for more sauce: arrival took forever and basically tasted like 2% milk with some salt. Caesar salad: SWIMMING in water. I should buy the Franciscan a salad spinner. I didn't eat but a few bites of my meal and the server never inquired how anything tasted. I handed him my plates and he made no comment on the fact that I hadn't eaten anything. (I should have said something I guess. My friend ordered shrimp, mussels and dungeness crab that came out on a hot plate: not hot. Melted butter was starting to solidify. Several of the mussels had not opened up. Also ordered oysters and there were bits of shells. Shrimp: lacked flavor. All her food was cold. Also, as I had a dead cell phone and asked if I could charge it so I could get an Uber and they charge for charging your cell phone! We had dropped almost $300 on a meal and I cannot charge my cell phone for a few minutes? DO NOT EAT HERE. You'd be better off at a Long John Silvers. Seriously.", "author": "Billie H."}

However, after having had the same thing for the past three years in a row, my boyfriend and I were intrigued by the Crab Alfredo.  Both of us loving seafood and Italian, it was a no-brainer.  I was a bit hesitant on the price (because I'm cheap sometimes), but after the first bite--heck, even the first smell, I was in love.  The sauce was so beautiful, and the crab was more than a fair serving!  We were sure that we had eaten the last piece of crab, but no!  There was still so much more at the bottom of the bowl.  It is WELL worth the price (which really isn't too much to be honest).  It is a generous serving size for one person, however, if you do have something to start off with, you will be more than happy to share it with your loved one.\n\nI am more than excited to visit San Francisco again, to have these delicious dishes!", "author": "Talea G."}

Having seen the menu beforehand, I knew this place was going to be quite pricey, but I had a little extra change in my pocket, and felt for some quality seafood. \n\nI was on my own, and got a seat right away--not by the windows, but near them to where I still had a nice view of the bay. But then I had to wait a little over 7 minutes for a waiter to take my order and get me some water. I'm used to being seated AND given water promptly, and when I was there, it was not as busy & crowded as it was when I left. Only upside to that unusual long wait was getting to thoroughly decide on what to eat.\n\nI started off with the crab chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. It definitely made up for that wait ten-fold. It's been ages since I've had such fresh-tasting crab. I had more bread than what I could finish, as I was also given a little loaf of sourdough to my chowder. Some 10 minutes after, my main course of the crab sliders with fries arrived. As expected, the sliders were on the small side, but it was fine since I scarfed down more of the soup than the sliders. Fries were wonderfully crisp and seasoned, and the crab was just as excellent here as it was in the chowder. \n\nFor drinks, I tried out the Sirens of the Sea. Fruit punchy, like I like my cocktails. Don't know if it was the best thing to have directly after a boat ride, since I still was trying to shake off the motion of the boat!\n\nThe service from the waiters is the only thing preventing this place from being five-star. Don't know the names of the male servers I had, but there were times when I needed them (such as a refill of my water), and I had to wait a little longer than I think I should have given its upscale atmosphere. I remember saying thanks and bye to my main server, and he just gave me a simple, \"yes, thank you--bye\" while his eyes were glued to the electronic device all the servers used to take down orders. I would have definitely wanted a more cordial farewell. The place got packed with the dinner crowd when I left, and I knew my server was busy, but it still would have been a nice finishing touch to this overall pleasing experience here. \n\nWill come back for more of that crab, fresh-baked sourdough bread, and bayside views!", "author": "Dee L."}

It was very busy but we were sat very quickly (about 20 minute wait) and I know why....the tables are turned over very quickly by the bussers and servers. I've eaten at many restaurants and these guys are fast.\n\nOur server was very nice and respectful. However, after I explained that we wanted the whole crab (shaping the body with my hands to show him what I meant) and an extra 1/2 crab, he suggested for us to get the Too Two Crab because its the same but cheaper. After receiving the crab, we noticed it was not the whole crab and thought they were bringing it out after we were done with the 1st batch.\n\nWhen we realized that we were wrong, I asked if that is what we ordered and he said yes. I explained \"again\" that we wanted the entire crab, head and all. But he explained that it was the whole crab but without the head. \n\nIt was a good thing he was nice, just wished we would've been told what a whole crab was.

We wanted to show them the Wharf and if you are trying to impress, skip this place. \n\nThe view and decor was perfect in theming and we loved that. It all went downhill the moment we met our waiter. \n\nHe was rude, rushed, borderline abusive. When asking for our order he yelled at us and was condescending. \n\nHe yelled at busboys and runners across the room in an abusive tone, rolled his eyes and dismissed guests when he was not stressing everyone out and yelling at them. He was equally rude to all his tables and all the employees. \n\nWe were a group of 15 last Saturday night and are a very patient and understanding group. There was no need to rush, no need to be so high strung and certainly no need to belittle the Global VP's and his team when placing their menu orders. \n\nTo top it all off he had the nerve to write on the receipt tipping guidelines. We of course did tip well out of principal however it is tacky. If the establishment puts a printed tipping guideline, that is acceptable. Written in ink pen by the waiter, that is uncomfortable and after the service..appalling. \n\nThe food had mixed reviews from our group.

And there is no better place to be a tourist than Fisherman's Wharf. Especially in the summer when it is super duper packed. It feels like I'm on vacation LOL\n\nI've always wanted to eat at this restaurant ever since I saw it across from Boudin Bistro when we took some out of town friends there. It looks like a boat! And it is nearly on the edge of the wharf so very close to the water. \n\nWhen you walk in you'll see lots of old Hollywood photographs in the walls, and famous people. Not sure they actually ate here though. As you walk up the stairs to the restaurant, you are greeted by a spectacular view of the SF Bay. Alcatraz is the focal point. I would say it was already worth going here just for the view alone. \n\nWe were seated by the huge windows overlooking the bay.. perfect. No wait as this was early lunch. The wait staff are dressed up, and the place has an upscale feel to it. But definitely tourist-y. Yay! Their menu is perfect for tourists.. it has pictures! Usually these are not good signs but a lot of people prob find it helpful to see pictures of their food  (esp foreigners) so I'm not hating . \n\nWe start off with the crab fondue.. with glass of sauvignon blanc (it is a Sunday morning!). The fondue was very good with lots of crab. Their menu is extensive and of course they have crab! I really love crab but just was not in the mood to eat with my hands LOL next time! So I opt out for the next best tourist-y item: clam chowder served in a bread bowl. My partner ordered the Dungeness Crab melt sandwich served with fries. Ok this was prob the best clam chowder I've had in SF so far. The crab melt was very good. But I have to say my favorite thing was the fries! Wow I can eat a whole order of that yum yum yum. Not sure what they put in it but it's pretty close to perfection. \n\nSo we had a pretty awesome experience being tourists in our own lovely city. The service was a little slow and the prices are pretty steep.. but you expect these things when you are a tourist. Overall though, I would take visitors here and may come back when we're in a mood to have that vacation a few blocks from our home.", "author": "Vol T."}

Was craving  1) a beautiful Bay view 2) great seafood. Did I accomplish the two? Well, read on...\n\nBecause it was a Saturday night and we had no reservations, the wait time they gave us was 30 minutes. Fortunately, another employee happened to walk by and mentioned that there was outdoor seating on the patio with heaters. In retrospect, this is the best thing that happened to us that night because the view was GORGEOUS. \n\nBecause every thing on the menu is offered in Small, Medium, Large, we decided to order three Large tureens (shrimp pescatore, seafood cioppino, and garlic steamed clams), crab cakes, fresh oysters on ice, a plate of Fish and Chips, and some cocktails to share. Loved the super fresh oysters and crab cakes had the right texture and taste.  \n\nThe cioppino, pescatore, and clams were only fair. Lightly spiced tomato base with a nice blend of your expected sea creatures. Had enough seafood for everyone to share and great portion size, but the cioppino and pescatore just tasted TOO similar. I would not order them together again, the pescatore essentially tasted like the cioppino but an only-shrimp version. The garlic broth for the clams was very, very buttery. The tureens were nothing to write home about, but enjoyed them nonetheless.\n\nSadly, the fish and chips is where they went totally wrong. Firstly, there was NO tarter sauce or vinegar with it. Just ketchup. That just seemed off to me. Also, the fish batter was well-flavored but not crunchy enough and every time anyone cut into the fish to eat it, the batter would come off. That tells me that they did not fry it in hot enough oil. \n\nI expect every seafood restaurant to have it's fish and chips on point. Sadly, Franciscan did not meet that expectation. They did however serve some pretty solid seafood fare and an uninterrupted ocean view.  Next time. I'll just go to the nearby seafood shacks or smaller cafes, unless I'm really willing to pay a lot for the view.", "author": "Arushi S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-21", "description": "I took another chance at The Franciscan after a bad experience and got a somewhat better one this time around. So I am giving it an extra star.\n\nThe downside ... I asked for a table with a view and was given a table next to a window overlooking some benches and trash cans with homeless people milling around them. And bright white flood lights. The same thing happened the last time as well. From now on, I will not ask for a table with a view and will look at the other diners instead.\n\nThe service this time was better ... our waitress was overworked but capable, and although she pushed the watered down alchoholic drinks on us frequently, she did a good job bringing everything out in a timely manner despite having a ton of tables to wait.\n\nThe crab was good ... although I would prefer more garlic butter for dipping. It is served on a hot stone type of thing and most of the butter sauce seems to have hardened on the top of the stone. The crab was bigger than the last time ... it seems that ordering a single crab will yeild a much bigger crab than if you order the crab for 2 or 3 people, in which case the price is doubled but it seems the portion is only 1 1/2 times bigger.\n\nFresh dungeoness crab is pretty amazing stuff and I didn't feel let down by the taste/size of this order. Last time, we got the crab for 2 and felt like it could have served 1 person.\n\nThe sourdough bread is very good ... but the alchoholic drinks here are useless. I warned my family not to get them but they did anyways and most said they were dissapointed that at $15 each, they didn't feel so much as a buzz after two or three drinks.\n\nThe other people I was with had fried seafood and said everything was very fresh and tasted good.\n\nI think the next time I am in San Francisco, I will try the Crab House because their yelp rating is a bit higher ... but The Franciscan is a lot larger and in a less crowded area, so it might be less of a wait to go here. The atmosphere is nice in a modern/sterile type of way and the food was better this time around.\n\nI wasn't blown away by my experience but it wasn't a bad one like the last time. I would recommend this restaurant to friends who were visiting San Francisco.", "author": "E T."}

I'm not especially proud that my life's journey has led me to that lesson, but here we are.  \n\nI've also learned that you can take any statement that follows \"I'm the kind of person who...\" and assume the opposite is true.  That one came in particularly handy when I was dating, but it's still useful at times, like when I get a new boss.\n\nThe other day, I learnt from PBS that Henry VIII had a velvet toilet seat. \n\nAnd -- contrary to beliefs at the very core of my existence -- last year I learned that there is great dining and drinking to be had at Fisherman's Wharf.  At The Franciscan.\n\nThe Mr. and I discovered The Franciscan on an odd odyssey.  Before taking an overseas trip last year, we decided to practice being tourists (it's not neurotic, it's called PLANNING), and we scooted down to the wharf for a little sidewalk crab.  But it was windy, and I don't like cocktail sauce in my hair, and I was very, very hungry.  Plus, there were way too many people walking around like they had nowhere to go, which drives me crazy, even though they're on vacation for chrissakes and that's totally my stupid problem.  Still, danger was in the air.  The Mr. had to think fast to protect the visored and fanny-packed.  He steered me into The Franciscan, against every remaining instinct my blood sugar could muster.  \n\nAnd it was one of the best lunches I've ever had.  Certainly not one of the cheapest, but absolutely wonderful.  We had the whole crab in garlic and of course wine.  The food was amazing, our server was a doll, the view is astonishing, and the decor is so retro glam, I kept waiting for Lana Turner to sit down next to us and bum a smoke.  \n\nSo the next time you're looking to break your routine and try something different, head to the wharf and have a few drinks while enjoying our beautiful harbor.  If you get hot flashes the next day, I guarantee it will be worth it.", "author": "Rosie W."}

Frankly some San Franciscan's and Bay Area folks are neighborhood snobs when in comes to The City, and in most cases I would agree, but I can't find a single thing not to love about The Franciscan Crab Resaurant.  The food is always amazing and fresh.  Hands down the best mussels I've ever had (roasted in their wood buring oven), service is on point...even charming, without being overly intrussive.  The views are out of this world, and almost every table has access to the view.  Parking is validated at the adjacent Fisherman's Wharf lot, which help defray the wicked cost of parking in this \"Tourist Trap\" area of The City.  \n\nWarm sourdough bread, excellent sea food, million dollar views and great for a family get together or a cozy romantic dinner.", "author": "Michele M."}

The calamari was the best part of our meal but they serve it with cocktail sauce which to me just seems like a lack of effort and originality, also tasted as though it came out of a can. The Louie shrimp salad was the most expensive part of our meal, the shrimp were extremely small and tasteless and it reminded me of a salad you can get at any diner. The foggy wharf crab sliders were good and had a good taste but the breakfast style potato side dish left me a little confused and didn't seem to mesh with the entree well, seemed just like a filler side.

I had gone to SF for a day trip and my mom and I hadn't planned anything in advance. We had just looked at WHERE magazine and since it boasted the best crab in town, we decided to ask the concierge at the hotel to make a reservation.\n\nWe walked over to pier 43 1/2 and at first didn't really want to walk in because it didn't look the cleanest. Right across from it is Boudin, another seafood restaurant, and it looked really nice. We actually walked over there first to check out the menu, but it didn't have any crab. Sure, it had crab cakes and crab sandwiches, but my mom and I were really hungering for freshly steamed crab legs. So we decided to give the Fransican a chance since we already had a reservation.\n\nWalking up the stairs, the inside was loud and cheerful. We were ushered to our table right away. Everything on the menu looked delicious: we ordered a medium skillet of mussels and shrimp and a pound of crab (about 9 legs). When it arrived, everything looked sooo good.\n\nThe crab legs were steamed in their garlic butter sauce, but it wasn't dripping with oil. In fact, it seemed like the restaurant knew just the right amount of sauce to put on to still get that great sea flavor. This was the first time I never dipped the crab in butter, even though we had a cup full of it given.\n\nWith the shrimp and mussels came a reduced balsamic sauce on the side; I really urge you to try it. It tastes so good with the mussels.\n\nI really recommend this place! It was FANtastic.\nMy mom and I ate until we were stuffed; without eating any of the bread, this was the perfect amount of food.\n\nCan't wait to come back!", "author": "Jasmine L."}

I'm going to guess that they get pretty busy on weekends so making a reservation would be a good idea if you plan on dining here. The most impressive part of the restaurant is the view. I requested a table overlooking the water and the view was beautiful. I got a great view of Alcatraz by the window. The service is also spectacular. Our server was very attentive and gave recommendations on the menu. \n\nAs for the food itself, well...it could've been better. My pasta dish was too salty but lacking in flavor. I also tried the clam chowder in a bread bowl and the chowder had a gritty texture to it and it wasn't very creamy. I also tried the crab and it was okay. My dad, on the other hand, loved the crab. The day after dining here, he was still raving about the crab, so that made me happy because he's a picky eater and it's hard to find foods that he enjoys. \n\nThe food is overpriced considering the quality.

My family has been to this place for a long time to eat, every time we are in SF. However, this time that we went was just different. What happened???? Let me define our experience in the following points:\n\n1. We never received the water we asked for. I ordered an iced tea, and everyone else in our party of 4 ordered a water. The water never came, and we didn't want to inconvenience our waiter since he was very rude and argued with me when I asked about the crab, which brings me to my next point:\n\n2. In the past, every time we order the half crab, or lotsa crab, or even the whole one, it comes steamed in their secret garlic sauce, which is absolutely delicious. This time, the crab was fried or whatever, and it was sizzling on a skillet. I asked the waiter why the crab wasn't steamed as usual, and he proceeded to tell me that I should have told him that unless I wanted it steamed then it won't come out that way. Fine. Maybe things have changed, that's OK, I can eat fried crab. But this crab was just horrible. Way too salty, and just did not have a fresh taste. \n\n3. Our appetizer, the crab fondue. I'm pretty sure they did not use crab in there. It tasted more like someone threw in fish with some cheese, baked it, and called it a crab fondue. For almost 20 bucks, I expect more than soggy \"fondue\" with burnt crostini thrown on the side. \n\n4. HOW DO YOU MESS UP FISH AND CHIPS? That was another sadly messed up dish. It was one of my favorites until this time that we went. The breaded portion was just so soggy and the inside tasted as if it were frozen and then microwaved. \n\n5. Our waiter. Looks like a french guy with grey hair (possibly his name was alexander?). Why would you raise your voice and argue about a dish with me? I politely asked you a question. In addition, my party of FOUR shared two crabs. And you only bring by one crab cracker? Why???? Between the four of us, it's hard to get to the two whole crabs that we ordered with only one cracker. Finally, he walked by our table a good two times per minute. And if you see that we have no water, then that's just a shame. \n\nPerhaps this is unnecessary, but I have unfortunately crossed off this restaurant as a go-to place on my SF travel list. Shame.", "author": "Becky K."}

We arrived and were seated next to a window probably within ten minutes of getting there so I was super jazzed. Our waitress, a woman with blonde hair and braces, came over to take our order, and that was literally the only time she came to our table until she brought us our check. I am a bread addict so when 15 minutes passed and we didn't have any I was a little disappointed but it was kinda busy so I decided to not ask for any. A couple minutes after the busser brought my boyfriend his soup he drank the last of his water and empty his glass remained for the entire rest of the meal... we shared the rest of my water over what seemed like an eternity. (I would've politely asked for more but our waitress didn't even acknowledge us since we ordered.) Our busser brought us food and it was delicious! Best Shrimp Alfredo I've ever had! We continued to try to get our waitresses attention to refill our water glasses but she was preoccupied with other tables. We sat after we finished and talked for quite some time and when I looked at my watch I realized we had been there twenty minutes since we finished eating we started looking around for our waitress 10 more minutes passed 15, 20, we waited until it had been a full hour after we had finished our food for her to finally acknowledge us and bring us our check. If it hadn't of been my birthday my boyfriend would have made a fuss in the restaurant but he didn't want to ruin the night. I don't know if it was because we look younger or got water instead of wine that night but I know that she visited the surrounding tables multiple times during our service and completely ignored us when we made eye contact or tried to get her attention. I know plenty of people who work in the restaurant business and that's why we always tip 25-30% and this is the only time we have ever left someone less.", "author": "Emily E."}

She was vacationing here in SF and has severe celiac disease. She went back to Houston and is still suffering from her unfortunate experience at Franciscan. Here's her story:\n\nMy daughter n I stopped in the Franciscan Crab Restaurant in San Francisco for a snack after lunch and wanted a Ice-cream Sundaes.I'm a Celiac & allergic to gluten. I talked to the waiter & asked questions about gluten in the strawberry banana Sundae, he checked & said the ice cream is GLUTEN FREE in that specific Sundae and it was GF. I said I was allergic & thanked him. He seemed a bit upset that we only order 1 sundae, it was huge. We were eating it & in my 2nd bite there was a piece of chocolate cookie(gluten)! It was hidden in d middle of the ice cream! I about fainted & was so shocked & upset because I ate a piece thinking it was walnuts. I put it on a plate & asked waiter why I had this Cookie in my ice cream. He looked dumbfounded & said he told the staff I was ALLERGIC . He said he was sorry & won't charge me! Duh!!  I had just gotten well enough to go on vacation & get off steroids after 5 years... Now I was poisoned by some inconsiderate waiter/chef. It had to be purposely put in my dish because I asked if there were cookies in it & he assured me it was Gluten Free. I was in such shock & I couldn't think to ask for a manager. I would not even rate this a 1 star, he was so inconsiderate of me & I'm guessing because I didn't order a $$$$ meal was his only reason to act this way. We were pleasant n enjoy our day & the beauty of the bay. I'm still sick 3 days later, my body reacted 20 minutes later & I could hardly walk.. Ended up laying on the grass near the street & getting a taxi back to the hotel. This ruined our last few days of our vacation... I had a difficult flight home . I was so bloated and looked like my 5 month pregnant daughter. And then there's the pain & now I'm back on the steroids . Not happy at all. Disgusted with this place. Not once , when we moved to be closer to the restroom, did anyone check on me! My daughter ate the Sunday & said not 1 strawberry or not 1 slice of banana in the strawberry banana Sundae.

The food is good.  They've got, logically enough, plenty of fish dishes.  I've had the fish of the day, some salmon pasta, I can't recall, but I certainly remember that there was not a single meal that I didn't enjoy.   That's not really what brings me back, but the food's good.\n\nHaving raised that point, what tends to bring me back is my family.  I've always come here when either my mother or my father was visiting.  It's convenient, and tourists always end up somewhere in or near Fisherman's wharf...  go figure!\n\nNow the service, though, sucks.   My theory is that they serve mostly tourists and figure they don't give a shit about building a rep.  Tourists will take abuses that locals most certainly would not.  Therefore, waiters here push as much as they can.   If occasionally they get caught, \"fuck 'em... cheap fuck can go back to Arkansas,\" is probably what's going through their minds.\n\nSo we had dinner here once, my mother and I, and we'd both ordered appetizers, both ordered entrees, and I think we'd split a bottle of Chardonnay.   We're probably talking $100 to $150 (Yes, as others here have pointed out... seriously overpriced!)   So the waitress brings us the bill and, sure enough, the little bitch had already rung up 20% tip and added it to the total.   My mother, who was treating (thanks mom!) asked what that was all about:\n\nMom:  \"Excuse me, but why is the tip already included?\"\nDumbass waitress:  \"Well, ma'am, that's just how we do things here.\"\nMom:  \"What do you mean?  Service is not compulsory unless it's a party of six or more, right?\"\nDumbass waitress: \"Errrr, well, we just add the tip to the bill as a convenience.\"\nMom:  \"Convenience for whom?

Mission accomplished.\n\nThe exterior is flashy- I was almost scared, but once we got inside my fears dissapated.  Our large booth facing the window was just what we needed to sit close and enjoy the view.  We got the cheesey fondue-like appetizer and a bottle of wine to start the evening.  The sourdough bread in San Francisco is amazing - and this was no disappointment.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful as we were picking through the menu.  I settled on salmon and my husband got the cioppino... He was ecstatic when it arrived.  I was pretty happy myself- the flavor of my fish was spot-on and it was cooked just the way I wanted it.\nI know it's touristy- and maybe even a bit over-priced - but San Francisco is a touristy place - and this was exactly what we were looking for. \n\nOh - and the silverware had fins on it... which I thought was cute/funny.

I just flew in from Chicago with my laptop bag and carry on in tow, tired and waiting on broil to scoop me up. Walked the Wharf a few times looking for the right place to eat, the Franciscan scared me off originally because of its high prices. In the end, this is where I enjoyed a freakin good meal. There are a lot of steps going up when you are lugging luggage and not sure what was going on with the elevator. The hostess wasn't nice or anything, hardly an entrance greet and sent me to a table in the back since I was solo. It was pretty early when I got there and after watching me come up those steps I'm surprised she took me on an escapade rather than seating me at any one of the many tables open and nearby. Although she wasn't happy with my request I asked for a table overlooking the water. Once seated everything got better. The fruity mixed cocktail was strong enough to send me into a nice haze. I've never had clam chowder so good and with real seafood in it. What the fuck have I been eating in Chicago! Fake chowder I suppose. Then the crab came doused in a garlic sauce which was heavenly. My problem was not knowing how much strength to use when breaking the shell and a bit of self consciousness, not wanting to soil myself too much in the process. An older couple seated nearby saw me struggling and the lady said simply.. \"first time?\" \"It's a messy job but just go for it, you'll love it. You can always get more napkins\" She's right! Fuck it, so I get dirty in a white linen cloth place, I'm just some silly tourist. Yes it was pricey, but the food was excellent. At the time I was there I was able to get in on the Prix fixe menu and dessert came at the end. A bit of their own home made frozen vanilla custard was the perfect end.", "author": "Jacob J."}

I did notice when we entered that there was a fairly large crab sitting near the hostess stand - baked out of bread! Looked really cool - I've posted a photo of it to this review...\n\nThere were 10 people in our party - we had a reservation and were seated promptly. I was a little unsure what to order as the menu is strangely organized and I was not sure just what the hell I was going to actually receive when I ordered something.\n\nWe ended up ordering a large mussels, shrimp, and crab appetizer - served on a massive cast iron skillet. The mussels and shrimp were pretty good - the crabs were so-so. I also ordered the Alaskan Pale Ale - which was tasty. Someone asked what made it Alaskan - I replied that Chinook Salmon had swam and pissed in this beer!\n\nWe then ordered dinner - I ordered the salmon with an olive oil dressing - had a bit of garlic and chopped olives in it - very tasty!

He stared at his inventory gadget more than he looked at our faces! We had to flag down our server multiple times to ask for things like utensils and napkins, because he would clear it away way too quickly, before the rest of our food even arrived. This might have been excusable if the restaurant was packed and busy, but it wasn't. \n\nThis place seems to be a bit over-hyped.

The restaurant itself feels like you've stepped back in time - really nice atmosphere. I didn't know if I could tackle a whole crab on my own and I had decided on a half crab. My waiter recommended to get their fixed price menu since I was already ordering clam chowder. So I got a cup of clam chowder (with a side of sourdough bread to make up for the lack of a bread bowl), Dungeness crab legs in their garlic sauce and a vanilla custard for $30.

What better place than the beautiful views of the Bay in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf?\n\nI contacted Franciscan via email and their General Manager, Craig, responded within a few hours.  He provided me with several menu options and event spaces.  The great thing I loved about Franciscan was their All-Inclusive per person rates. Each menu includes 3-courses, all non-alcoholic beverages, tax, and gratuity.\n\nWe reserved the Bayview Room and offered our guests the Cable Car menu which was $40 per person.  The kids were offered a separate menu at only $5.95 each.  The Cable Car menu included a salad and choice of Dungeness Crab Legs, Salmon, or Slow Roasted Short Rib. Guests also enjoyed a really creamy & delicious ice cream for dessert.  \n\nMy hubby and I both ordered the Dungeness Crab Legs.  Typically, I am a carnivore but considering the venue we had to try their specialty.  Though at first, I was a bit jealous of the surrounding plates of Short Rib at our table.  My cousin gave me a big piece to try and it was so tender, juicy, and seasoned well.  I started doubting my crab selection until I tried it.  I definitely went with the right choice!  Their secret garlic sauce is amazing!  The crab was succulent and easy to eat.  Our guests loved their entrees and the Bay views were breathtaking.  We were extremely pleased with the food, service, & ambiance.  \n\nI took off 1 star because upon arrival I handed my credit card to the hostess and told her not to accept payment from anyone else.  She happily agreed and took my card.  When the bill arrived, I asked to sign it and noticed my in-laws were paying the check.  It was a very nice gesture but I wish the hostess would have at least given me a heads up.\n\nADDED PERK: Validated Parking - 2 hours free during lunch and 3 hours free during dinner.", "author": "Nikki C."}

I requested a window with a view and they seated my family and I off in the corner with no view. When we got seated we ordered waters. Well, that took about 10-15 minutes just to come out. Then we waited another 10-15 minutes to place out appetizer order. I ordered the four meat sampler they brought out a board with meats just spaced out on it. Definitely not worth $38.95, then they forgot to bring out the bread so we had to remind our server that the appetizer came with bread. We also ordered a calamari order to share. That was probably the best part of the meal. Another 15 to 20 minutes passed and we finally placed our order for our main course. We ordered 3 clam chowders, 1 crab chowder, 2 double crab double shrimp, 1 chicken Caesar salad, and 1 kids fish and chips. The chowders all came out 25 mins later and the crab about 15 mins after the chowders. We had to keep asking the server where the salad and fish and chips were. Keep in mind the fish and chips was a kids meal... In my opinion everything should have come out together. Or the kids meal first. Well, the salad came out another 15 mins after the crab came out. And the fish and chips was the last to come out another 15 mins after the salad. That was just unacceptable.  The fact that the answer to why the fish and chips wasn't out yet was because the \"kitchen was backed up\" doesn't excuse it, the fact was that they lost the order... Or messed it up and sent it out with some other group. Just ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend this place! Gabrielle was the server that day", "author": "Maria S."}

The menu is actually a book with gorgeous pictures and recipes. Took one of these home to try and make the sizzling garlic crab. It's got a retro 1950s vibe throughout including wait staff in dinner jackets. Amazing calamari and oysters. My son loved his smoked salmon Caesar salad while my younger one loved the fish part of his kid's fish and chips but was disappointed that the chips were actually overseas ones salty potato chunks with olives. My filet was cooked perfectly and came with amazing mashed potatoes. The kids had a huge chocolate sundae between them while I enjoyed a Chocolate Fog drink. Service was efficient and friendly.

However, the food is lacking in flavor. I had the whole garlic grab and the clam chowder. The crab had no flavor. It just tasted like plain boiled crab. It needed salt and I tasted no garlic. They should boil their crab in a Old Bay crab boil seasoning packet or at least ad salt to the water. It's bad when Red Lobster has better crab than a water front restaurant in the city lol! My husbands home cooked crab tastes better than this place. I was also disappointed that they didn't offer an option to have the crab cracked, as other restaurants do. We had to put in major work for bland crab. The clam chowder was by far the worst I've ever had. It tasted like mushy potato soup with a unpleasant flavor. It's hard to get bad clam chowder anywhere in the City but they accomplished it. It amazes me to see so many tourist going there but they don't know any better. The service is good but they need flavor! I expected better for the price. My recommendation would be to go to the bar for a drink and take in the view. There are many other better restraints in the area. Try Alioto's.", "author": "Sarah L."}

I had planned an overnight event in SF to play like a tourist. As many who have lived here all their lives had never spent the night in the city and played tourist. So I booked us hotel rooms and planned activities.\n\nI picked the Franciscan as I like that it had a long term history, was good sized to hold a group, has wonderful views and of course because my favorite food is Succulent Crab.\n\nNow you all know if your gonna eat at a nice Seafood restaurant in the city the prices are going to be a bit higher so no need for me to even go there. \n\nWhat's more important is the service, the food flavor and quality.\n\nFirst let me say when I contact an establishment about  about group reservations it's when I get my first impression if I want to eat, stay or go to that particular place. I am very much about Fantastic Welcoming customer service. So when I contacted their General Manager via email he replied and was very welcoming to having our group come for dinner, so I decided to keep our reservation. I also said I could not give an exact count as our RSVP's flexuate but he said do not worry about that we will accommodate any size group you bring. So all correspondence up to our arriving was answered and I was always assisted, that's good service.\n\nUpon our groups arriving we sat at the bar it's not too big but the bartenders were very helpful in assisting us with our drink orders. I was not sure what I wanted and so the bartender asked if I like Martini's and of course I do. He suggested a Cucumber Martini and I said go for it. He made me one and it was so fresh like I had just had a fresh one from the garden infused with Vodka. Yummo!\n\nWe were then seated, I only had wished it were still light out so we could enjoy the wonderful bay view but that's for my next visit at lunch time.\n\nThe wait staff were quick and efficient, not overly talkative but that's okay we do enough talking ourselves. All of our food was flavorful and plated lovely. \n\nI do have to say thou I love Crab, I think I said that above,catch my drift! haha Drift and Crab in the sentence. But I really like it steamed with melted butter. So I ordered from the Pre-fixe menu what I thought read, and I never looked at the menu again to see if it said it or not. But steamed Crab and when it came it was roasted Crab, now I'm not saying it was bad it just was not what I had in mind and when I have something in mind to eat that is what  Iwant. So roasted was a bit drier then steamed so to me not as succulent. But of course I picked the shells clean, you thought I wouldn't??? The pre-fixe menu is nice you get a few entree selections, soup or salad and dessert.\n\nWe had a wonderful dinner and I would go back for sure. I want to go for lunch and just take my time dining and enjoying the views.\nStop in the Franciscan if you are in the city and say hi to the General Manager if he is there Craig, he actually seated us that night. And get J.C. to make you a Cucumber Martini.", "author": "Tina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-06", "description": "I wish I had come here on a day that San Francisco isn't raining or cloudy because the view of the Piers and Alcatraz would have been outstanding. But I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience here even though some menu items were a bit pricey.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here with two international students after a long day of touring around San Francisco's landmark locations. It's somewhat initially deceiving walking by this retro-glitzy-looking restaurant; my first thoughts were that this restaurant would be decked out and upscale. To my surprise, it looked like a fancier version of Mel's Drive-In: decorations such as old-fashioned photos and paintings, tiled counters along the walls, black cloths as our napkins, and menu items such as fish & chips, clam chowder, etc. Don't let these retrograde items fool you! The menu items sound mediocre, but WOW they did not taste like that.\n\nThe four of us ordered these items:\n- chicken and chips \n- prix fixe 1: cup of clam chowder, salmon in a spicy tomato cioppino sauce, and house-made kustard ice cream (vanilla)\n- prix fixe 2: cup of clam chowder, crab alfredo (with linguini pasta), and house-made kustard ice cream (vanilla)\n- wild strawberry Italian cheesecake\n- chocolate fog (basically a chocolate rum-like concoction with Godiva shot and a hint of mocha flavor)\n(Items we didn't order but were customarily included were water and sourdough bread & butter.)\nWe were all very pleased with each of the items we ordered--everything tasted above average. But I'd definitely highlight a few items in particular.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: chicken & chips\nHaving had a crab/shrimp cocktail snack from Fisherman's Wharf earlier, I was in the mood for something not as seafood-y. I thought the chicken and chips would be a simple strips and fries dish, but WOW was I so wrong! It was a single long strip of deep-fried chicken but didn't taste like the typical heavily-battered dry chicken. It was juicy, tender, and SO delicious! I'm not sure how I can even describe how pleasantly surprised I was to taste chicken like this! The chips were also delicious--it tastes like those flash-fried, addictive fries that you'd eat on cruises (as my boyfriend put it). \n\nHIGHLIGHTS: crab alfredo\nI had enough crab for the day from snacking at the Wharf, but this dish made me happy to have more, especially because of the linguini pasta. I don't believe I've ever had linguini pasta with texture to this perfection before! I love cheese from alfredo sauce to death, so looking back now, I wish I had ordered this (with chicken or shrimp) instead of my chicken and chips. I sometimes can't justify to myself to order an alfredo pasta dish in a restaurant because it's simple enough to make at home, but Oh My Gosh, I want this dish again!\n\nOther features of this place that will make me want to come back again: \nPARKING: \nThis place will validate your parking ticket if you're parked in the lot right outside it (2 hours off if you parked there before 6 pm, and 3 hours off if you parked there after 6 pm). This parking lot has several employees that give out/collect parking tickets at the entrance/exit, help guide traffic flow, and direct you to open spots, so it was extremely easy to park (minus the usual Fisherman's Wharf tourists that crowd the streets and walk through the lot occasionally). \nSERVICE:\nThe restaurant's host/hostess and waiters/waitresses are very attentive, polite, and easy to talk to. None of us ever had to ask for drink refills, extra utensils and plates for sharing, or wonder about when we'd be receiving food. They \"properly\" served us by serving us our food on our right sides and picking up our finished plates on our left sides--classy classy!\nOCEAN VIEW: \nThis restaurant sits right next to the docks, so you can get a front seat view of the bay and Alcatraz from your table. This place even chained binoculars to the window-edge counters so you can get a close up of Alcatraz and the bridges! \n\nThe best way I can describe Franciscan is casual-looking menu and restaurant with not-so-casual food quality and service. If it weren't for the fact that parking around the Embarcadero is so expensive and Fisherman's Wharf is extremely out of the way to get to, I would definitely come back to this restaurant again (and even refrain from snacking on seafood around the Piers and Wharf so I can make room for food from here)!", "author": "Stephanie C."}

The view from your table is of the bay which was amazing. We ordered the \"1 pound\" crab, 1 appetizer  and just Burger with fries NO ALCOHOL and the bill came to $ 94.

The food is always on point and I love it. But today I was SO disappointed I might not be back. The food was AMAZING, but the service was worse than terrible. The lady in the beginning was sweet, but the guy \"shadowing\" her was a complete sarcastic rude asshole. I didn't catch his name but he was shaved headed with a little facial hair I think I don't remember. He took over after the food was served, and made weird remarks while we were eating. Then stood over us and said \"I guess I should like take these..\" Still stood there and then took the plates. It was so awkward. And then he put the check down aggressively and walk away. Then we wanted to split the check (I put the cash and my sister put in her card) and he walked up and said \"ok.. This looks like it's ganna be complicated\" and rolled his eyes and we explained to him the cash then the rest on the card and apologized. He said \"sure.\" And looked irritated then walked away. As a server myself I KNOW that's not hard to do AT ALL. And his attitude was so uncalled for. Customer service was nonexistent. But the worst part was after we signed and left our FIFTEEN PERCENT TIP besides the shitty service, because I, as a server know the struggle of tips felt bad. Then he grabs the check OPENS IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE TABLE IN FRONT OF US. And makes a face and says \"wow....\" And stormed away shaking his head. HOW RUDE CAN YOU BE? NEVER should a server act that way. If I could of snatched the check back and took my money I would of . I was so angry and appalled by his behavior I don't think I'll be coming back for quite sometime. Which sucks because it's my favorite place.

We were seated by an elderly woman by the window, however, next to our table was all the kitchen equipment that was encroaching on our dinning space. I felt like I was in the middle of your kitchen. We requested to be moved and were sat at another location in the restaurant that had the exact same issue. We had been touring all day and were excited to sit down for an amazing meal. In addition to drinks, we ordered the calamari and crab feast for 4. As we began to eat the smell of rancid oil was overwhelming. It tasted like burnt rubber and oil that has been used for everything you've cooked for the last week. It was hard to get the taste of brunt, old oil out of our mouths. So we sent it back and hoped our crab dish would be better. But, that was not the case. The crab feast came out with the SAME overpowering rancid smell that the calamari had also. This was so disgusting we had to leave. Not to mention, we were starving. San Fransisco is known for it's bread and this bread was stale, hard, cold and then we noticed all their bread was sitting by the window just waiting to be served to guests. It felt like we were In a factory with pre prepared frozen food. Disgusting, if you're looking for even mediocre food avoid this place at all cost. If you wanna eat by the wharf you're better off getting a fishing pole and catching it yourself, it will definitely be fresher. The one positive note was the bus boy who was extremely apologetic and empathic with the situation. He was the only positive part of our experience. It is one hour of my life I can never get back.", "author": "Caitlin H."}

The service I have received on all 3 visits left much to be desired and necessary! 1st visit- after waiting over 30-40 mins for our initial beverage like you know ummmmm.... Water and then another 20 mins for my Pino, I should have taken the hint but I didn't, I ordered and ate and enjoyed the food but NOT the service (well lack of)! 2nd visit - almost exact service as the first visit except we had a window seat to distract us from being ignored by wait staff. Apparently we were supposed to get binoculars to view the view but lo and behold the wait staff failed to offer any exceptional service! 3rd and final visit was last night. The waitress paid us little attention, accidentally squirted crab juices in my eye while attempting to break it into pieces using a butter knife! Each time I visit the bill is no less than $200 for 3 diners. Franciscan's will not see that from me again! Thank you for what I can do at home!", "author": "That L."}

My drink was really strong and had tequila, made me drunk really fast. Seafood was pricy. They made us wait even though we made it to our reservation on time, wthHowever we at least did get a seat byt the window to view the bay which was nice.

The house salad was so fresh and the garlic vinaigrette was to die for. \n\nMy brother order the spicy shrimp pasta and I got the sizzling crab.

He was warm, attentive, smiling, helpful, friendy and personable. He attended to the little things which are really important.

I had been craving seafood for awhile and we thought being at Fisherman's Wharf would be a good opportunity to satiate that craving. Unfortunately, we were not able to get a window seat, but we got one of the booths right next one that was cleared not too long after our food came out, so it was nice to be able to look out into the bay while eating our dinners. The 50's-diner decor of the restaurant was nice. The booths and the little trinkets around the store were cute touches.\n\nThe food itself was quite delicious. We got the Surf and Turf with boneless short rib, seafood black linguine, and chicken alfredo. The short rib was very soft and flavorful, the seafood in the pasta was very fresh (although a bit messy to eat), and the chicken alfredo was very good as well.\n\nHowever, I must -1 a star because of the service. Service was noticeably slow and when I was eating my crab, I couldn't help but feel a bit judged by our server. I mean, yes, eating crab is not pretty business, but it is probably not an okay-thing for the customer to feel uncomfortable eating in front of the server.\n\nI might be coming here again some time in the future, but probably not any time soon.", "author": "Lynn K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-25", "description": "Four stars is probably just a bit much for this place, but it is surely better than three.  We had dinner during a weekday with some out of town relatives.  For tourists and locals alike, the view from most of the seats here are killer.  We had a great view of the bay.  Five stars for the view!  One negative was they seated the seven of us in a spot that normally seats six, even though we were early and the place was wide open.  That did take away from the experience just a bit.  \n\nThe food is pretty good.  Most of us had some sort of seafood, and I give it pretty high marks.  Not the best I ever had, but pretty darn good.  The plates did seem a bit skimpy on the side dishes, but I don't think anyone walked away hungry.  Took a little longer than I thought necessary to get bread and water, but no big deal.  The children's menu is pretty sparse, but both of our kids found something they liked.\n\nService was the one sorta weak spot.  The staff was very nice, but it often took some doing to get their attention.  I just did not feel like we were really being taken care of despite the fact they were not very busy.  Don't get me wrong, the service is not terrible, but for the prices they charge I would like have a little more attention shown to me.  Perhaps this is due to the fact it is located down in Fisherman's Wharf and they serve lots of out of tourists, but still.   Also be aware that even with a group of seven (two of those were kids), our gratuity was included in the bill.  Seven people seem like a pretty small group to hit us with that, but what do I know?\n\nOverall I enjoyed the place and would recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere to sit and appreciate the view while having a nice dinner.  The food is good and you won't get a much better view of the bay.  The prices are a bit high, but probably normal for that area.  If you drive, make sure you check to see if the restaurant will validate your parking.  The parking garages charge a bloody fortune down there!  I think the lot right in front of Franciscan's will validate, but you should check first. \n\nOh, and since your in the area, go and work off your dinner by playing some old coin operated games at the Musee Mecanique.  It is just a few doors down and well worth the visit.", "author": "Scott S."}

You're not paying for the food, in fact, I found that I've had a lot better food at other places for cheaper. You're definitely paying for the ambiance. My family and I ordered the crab, clam chowder, fish and chips, and calamari. Most of the food was decent but the crab was horrible. The crab I had, had an aftertaste of some kind of peroxide or ammonia. It was horrible. I expected a lot more in quality for the amount of money I paid for it.

The server served our needs. He took our order and refilled our beverages when needed. What you need to know is that this place is overpriced. My wife had the crab cake appetizer and a cup of clam chowder and I had the Shrimp & Crab skillet. Water to drink, and the bill was $90. The food came out quickly and I like the fact that the waiter uses a handheld device to put your order in, so it goes right into the kitchen. The crab cake lacked flavor and the shrimp & crab legs were drowning in garlic, lemon butter. It was a bit too much, especially for the shrimp, which were sitting in it. The crab legs were protected by their shells, so they weren't as overpowering. They even give you more of the butter to dip the crab legs in. I was expecting it to be regular butter. Nope, more garlic lemon butter. Must be a San Francisco thing.", "author": "Bill G."}

My friends came up from L.A. over the weekend and we walked around the wharf area a bit before deciding on The Franciscan for a late lunch, early dinner for some probably.  I loved the old-tyme photos that lined the walls as we climed the stairs to the restaurant but that's where the love ended.  Everything else was mediocre at best and the restaurant is too high priced for mediocre.\n\nFirst off, we waited at the table for about 10 minutes before the server even came to get our drink order.  No, it wasn't busy.  When he got there, we just gave him our drink, alcohol, appetizer and entree order all at once.  It took several minutes after that for the bread to even be delivered to the table.\n\nWe started with the calamari appetizer.  It was pretty bland but offered dipping sauces to distract from the blandness of the actual dish.  Then, there were 4 of us.  We ordered Crab legs, Lasagna, Prime Rib French Dip and Fish'n'Chips.  The best was the Lasagna (I'd have not put bell peppers in it though) and then the Prime Rib sandwich was good (not great).  The crab legs tasted really fishy to me and the fish'n'chips like no other I've had, unfortunately not in a good way.  They were dry so we ask for malt vinegar, only to be brought soy sauce in a little cup instead.  I secretly hoped that wasn't a 'joke' since my friend who ask for it was Asian.\n\nIf it weren't so high-priced it would get a 3 but I expect better service and food quality as the price goes up.  Also, it seemed funny that at a seafood/crab restaurant, the 2 items that were somewhat okay were... not seafood.", "author": "Susan D."}

The location is great and the decor is interesting, but the food I had wasn't anything special.\n\nI got the prix fixe meal with clam chowder, fish and chips, and \"kustard\" ice cream.  While the service was generally prompt, I was initially struck by how the guy bringing bread and water to my party's table managed to do so without even looking in our direction.  (When we got the bread, I'd kind of already wished that I'd gone to Boudin across the parking lot, probably because the bread was room temperature and not terribly soft.  To the Franciscan's credit, the butter was soft.)\n\nThe chowder came out quickly along with my dad's salad.  The chowder was different from the kinds I've had before - the potato and clam seemed more finely chopped, and it was a little more seasoned than usual.  I liked it, even though there were more hard bits in it than I'm accustomed to.  The fish and chips were pretty solidly underwhelming.  The fish was misleadingly crispy on the outside, as it was too wet on the inside.  The fries were either lukewarm or a little cold, and I think they only got the warmness from the big hunk of fish on top of them.  Finally, the \"kustard\" just seemed like ice cream in a glass cup to me, but I'm not an ice cream connoisseur.  It was okay - though the portions seemed kind of generous, you really do pay for them, so it's not a great value.\n\nAs an aside, my dad seemed to think that the bartender went above and beyond the call of duty by putting a lot of liquor in both of his $9 drinks.  On a totally unrelated note, he was thoroughly satisfied with his meal, which included the crab enchilada.", "author": "Ian M."}

The waiter looked at the receipts and said, \"it's just that these are kind of...nevermind.\" What was he expecting? We tipped him nearly 15% which I think is fairly reasonable. Plus, gratuity shouldn't be expected. It was pretty generous considering the service he actually provided us. It was very awkward and unprofessional when he brought it up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-30", "description": "So after a long and most hectic week, I found myself on a Friday night, trying to decide where to dine out.  I was a little tired and didn't want to deal with the see and be seen of the latest 'in' place nor did I want to go someplace too simple.  I did know that I wanted to dine out and that I also wanted to go somewhere different.  Well, after much consideration and changing my mind several times along the way, we ended up here.\n\nYears ago, I had a girlfriend from Wisconsin who liked this place so I recall coming here quite a few times back then.  Hadn't been back to eat in ages, but always remembered that as far as the wharf goes, it was one of the better places to dine, other than Scomas.\n\nUpon walking in, I was surprised to see that the light stained blonde wood was now gone and that it had been replaced with a lot of white paint and some dashing red lighting.  A little over the top, but all in all, I thought it worked and I actually liked it a lot better than the old decor before the remodel.\n\nFood-wise, I knew it wouldn't be hitting any new culinary landmarks, but figured it would be a comfortable and relaxing place to eat after a long and tiring day.  I ordered us a bottle of Ferrari Carano Chardonnay and also an appetizer of fried calamari.  It was odd to see that bottle of Ferrari Carano since it brought back memories of my evil ex-fiancee and how we used to order that all the time.  At $49/bottle, it was an inexpensive, yet satisfying choice which I felt was priced fairly, especially for a touristy place.  Only double retail or so I thought at the time.\n\nThe fried calamari was good.  Wasn't mindblowing like what I've had in Monterey or at high end restaurants, but all in all, it was tender and cooked nicely.  As for our entrees, she wasn't too hungry and ordered the Fish and Chips while I had the Olive Oil Oven Poached Salmon with asparagus, olives, rosemary, and garlic.  I've never been a fan of olives, but everything else was better than I expected.\n\nDisclaimer: To be honest, I didn't have the highest expectations coming in and it was actually a lot better than I had expected.  I especially liked the baby heirloom potatoes with accompanied the salmon.  It's certainly not a fancy place, not by a long shot, so I wouldn't dare compare it to the higher end places in the city, but for what it is, especially as a tourist place, I didn't think it was bad at all.  The salmon was cooked perfectly too.\n\nThe Fish and Chips looked good and I liked how it came on a long plate.  As with the calamari, I enjoyed the unusual presentation and felt that they were really trying to do just a little more to stand out.  She felt that the fries were salty, but I'm a saltaholic, so to me, they weren't salty at all.  As always, YMMV (your mileage may vary).\n\nWasn't sure if our server was new, but she and the rest of the staff that we came in contact with that night was really good, especially considering that we were at the wharf.  Most definitely didn't get the \"I'll treat you badly since you're a tourist and I'll never see you again anyway\" type of service that one sometimes gets in the area.  I liked the 'cookbook' style menu too.  Beautiful pictures of everything and with recipes as well.  The only negative about it is that because there are so many pages, it was hard to cut to the chase on what to order.  Perhaps an accompanying quick reference sheet might have been helpful although it worked out just fine as it was for me.\n\nI had been rushing to get there since I knew they closed at 10PM, but was surprised when I saw people get seated well after that as we were finishing up our meal so perhaps they can be a good choice for late dining on weekends.\n\nThe dessert offerings looked tempting, but I decided to make it an evening of nostalgia and decided to take us to Ghirardelli for an ice cream sundae afterwards instead.  \n\nAll in all, it was a good dining experience.  Better than I had expected and I thought really good compared to some of the other choices in the area.  For a tourist restaurant at the wharf, I'd say it's definitely a four.  Yet, with that said and done, when I compare it to other similarly priced restaurants in the city, I just can't do it (give four, that is).  Three and a half is pretty much what it is in my book, but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I'll have to give it a three which based on my experience that evening doesn't feel right either.  Regardless, I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again or bring out of towners here, especially if they are looking to dine in a nice relaxed environment at the wharf in pleasant surroundings.", "author": "Roy N."}

You walk around near where you are staying and find something that looks ok.\n\nSo there we are walking around fisherman's wharf, crab joint here, seafood joint there, plus a bakery (boudin's). \n\nWe chose this place 'cos it seemed to be set away from the more central tourist area, and hoped we wouldn't get 'ripped off'. \n\nWe definately did not get ripped off.\n\nThe service was fast and attentive. The food was good: lots of it and tasty.\n\nMrs Crash and I shared a 1/2 serve crab with 'special' sauce for appetizer. The crab was nice, quite mild taste tho, especially compared to our more familiar muddys. The sauce was a little weird to our taste tho' quite creamy and garlicky, but not really so nice.\n\nWe had a pasta dish each for main, and they were very tasty, seemingly fresh pasta, but both quite creamy/buttery sauces.\n\nSides of house salad and asparagus were great, very fresh and appropriately simply prepared.\n\nOverall for our first USA dinning experience we were impressed.", "author": "Captain C."}

The waiting area was right next to where the busboys cut the bread. One busboy was really friendly and offered a plate of bread and butter to snack on. I also observed another guy who was pretty clumsy and dropped the butter plate off its mantel, but he cleaned well, and disposed the contaminated butter away, so kudos.\n\nIts a gorgeous place, I cannot lie, but lacks romance in service and in the food. ESPECIALLY the food. It might have been what we ordered itself, recommend ordering the seafood dinners instead of pastas and sandwiches. \n\nOrdered the calamari platter, which was really good. There was alot to go around the five of us, and had a buttery, flaky taste. \nMost of my friends ordered shrimp alfredos, chicken fettuccine; I had a crab sandwich. Two of my friends were planning to share a crab sandwich as well, but was easily dissatisfied when it came out.. the sandwich looked so much smaller than what was shown in the menubook. My friend also pointed out that \"I had more fries than her\"....I felt whatever about it, and souped up my sandwich with a squeeze of lemon and some ketchup.\nThe chicken fettuccine was a little dry, and was sitting in oil, according to my friend.\n\nIt took a while for our waiter to come by with our check although we notified him that we were in a hurry. My waiter looked like a hipster Mario, not Luigi. I liked his hair though. \n\nIt was my first time here. Next time, I know now to order fresh seafood such as the crab or shrimp, or just get some clam chowda.", "author": "IC C."}

I showed them my hotel card - \"this does not mean anything to me = we need to collect the payment\". I finally left them my ID and got back to the hotel, got another card and returned to  settle the bill.

Looking at the menu, it was going to be a pricey affair, but how many times were we going to San Francisco as tourists?  So, we caught them as they just opened and were nice enough to seat us even though we didn't have a reservation (there were 10 of us, too).\n\nThe menu is mostly crab and fish related, understandably, but most of us didn't really like seafood to be honest.  Luckily, they had other options on the menu for us. The chicken alfredo I got was alright but very bland without any of the creamy goodness that you are supposed to get with alfredo sauce.  A cousin of mine ordered a whole crab, and he loved it.  This was no cheap crab place where you get the drawn butter on the side either, but rather the butter is cooked on the same skillet they bring it to you on.  They bring you sliced sourdough bread a couple of times as you wish, and the waiters are great about water refills.\n\nThe desserts are great looking, but only a handful of us had it.  They have a deal where you pay $25 for a soup choice, a medium-sized entree, and a cup of their custard ice cream, which was a deal a few of them went in on.  The ice cream is really good from what I heard.  They have a separate bar seating area which has around 6 cocktails, 5 draft beers, and 4 specialty foreign bottled beers, and good sized wine list (pause for the $10 corking service for wine........ok).

Because our fav wharf spot had a 45 minute wait... and we couldn't wait... we decided to roam looking for a spot to go to. \n\nWe walked over to Franciscan and stood at the front trying to decide if we should go in. A lady walked out and we asked what she thought and she said the food was fantastic. It was late.. and we decided, what the hell. Let's try it.\n\nUpon walking in, we were immediately seated down. The view is great especially with the sun setting. We went for the $30 pre fixe menu... of clam chowder, petite filet minion and frozen custard. We were given bread and a tiny cube of butter. I anticipated some warm soft bread... oh no! It was rock hard. I felt like a dog gnawing on a rawhide. It hurt so bad. I had to wait for my clam chowder soup to come out. However, I felt the soup tasted more of a potato soup??! It was super starchy and had a dallop of clams. The meal came out and I felt it was suuuuper salty. I couldn't even finish my meal, we had to take it to go. I'll give it up to the frozen custard though. It was a hefty size... a little too much... but if you were to order it for $6 off the menu, you receive a decent amount.\n\nI wouldn't return.... the customer service was blah.

If you just finished up the all american guided family tour of San Francisco and want to take the kids out for their first crab dinner and you're excited to take a selfie with the crab, this is the place for you.  If you want anything close to a fine dining experience, this is not the place.  I found this place on OpenTable and planned a romantic evening for two. I made a reservation online and asked for a table for two by a window at 7PM.  When we got there, they didn't set aside a reserved table, so there is no point in reserving a table. The ambience is akin to a 1950s diner replica.  The salads were served in a five star fashion - on a plate with a monstrous rim which would look wonderful with a carefully crafted salad of fresh greens.  But when piled with ice berg lettuce for all but one salad type, it's just not good.  And that other salad?  That's just a giant plate of arugula and a few spots of blue cheese and avocado hiding in there somewhere.  Crab should be prepared without excess oils to savor the flavor of the crab.  I like to \"LIGHTLY\" dip the crab into a succulent butter with garlic and lemon.  But here, the crab is saturated in butter or oil, or perhaps it's both.

Service to get our drink order was slow and we felt ignored.  Service the rest of the time followed the same course.  It wasn't awful, but we felt that given the hype, location, prices etc. it should have been spot on.\n\nOur gripe here is that we think the Franciscan seems to portray itself as a fine dining restaurant but lacks in the execution to do so in our observation.  Butter knives should be on the table.  If a salad is ordered in addition to an entree, a salad fork should be supplied.  The servers who bring the drinks and food should KNOW who gets what drink and what food.  It is SO, SO, SO ridiculous in a nicer restaurant that the server should stand at the table and ask who has what.  Get it together ahead of time, come up to us and put the food and drinks down just as we have ordered them and don't disrupt our time out together.  This should not be an issue as so many other restaurants deliever food and drinks to a table without interuption.\n\nWe felt that our waitor should have checked on us a few minutes after we recieved our entrees.  He was no where to be found.  We grabbed a server and asked him to bring me tartar sauce as requested when I ordered.  A few minutes later our server passed by, NOT to check on us, but we caught him to get the tartar which the server didn't bring.  5 minutes is enough time for your shrimp to cool off before you eat them.\n\nCome for the view which is incredible.

We stopped in various places in the Southwest and West coast states and each location we made sure to do something extremely touristy or eat something that we would never have a chance to do back in Austin, Texas.\n\nWe picked the Franciscan to do both and we ate as much as we could as well as had amazing views and decor to complete the experience.  The Franciscan is something straight out of either a mobster flick or a late 80's date movie.  The service was upscale and the food was gourmet as well as different than any other seafood restaurant I've experience on the east coast or the rare gems in Austin.\n\nWe stared off with smoked salmon carpaccio that was served with capers, avocado and burrata drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.  Followed by each enjoying a house salad which was a large bed of romaine wedge and fantastic pumpkin seeds for an added crunch just to name a simple ingredient in the salad.  For the main course we enjoyed 3 pounds of whole roasted dungeness crab that is first sauteed in chopped garlic, butter, olive oil and anchovies then sprinkled with sea salt and black pepper.  We paired our seafood dinner with a nice California prosecco that was really light for what we were eating.", "author": "Allie S K."}

Both were good but I wasn't such a big fan of the garlic sauce smothered all over the crab.  Still, I finished all the crab.  Mom got the clam chowder in a bread bowl.  I was originally going to order that but when I read the description, it said it contained thyme and I really hate thyme in my clam chowder.  Mom seemed to like the chowder so I tasted it and what do ya know! no thyme.  Instead it tasted as if it contained bacon and maybe cheese?  Good, but definitely not authentic New England clam chowder.  Anyway, our Irish waiter was very nice and attentive and even though we were there past closing, we weren't rushed and neither were the people at the other tables.  \nEach table looking over the water gets its own pair of binoculars which is a nice touch.  If you eat here during the day, you will have a nice view of Alcatraz. \nEach table also gets bread to munch on while waiting for your meal, but it was cold and not very appealing.  \nWe ended up spending about $80 just for the two of us.  \nMeal was ok but not too sure if I'd ever go back.", "author": "Anastasia E."}

We decided to eat at the pier and take the bay cruise instead.  The day turned out perfectly!  \n\nThe place looked pretty dumpy from the outside, but hey, if the food is good, I could care less!  But once you go up the stairs and walk in, the restaurant is actually really nice inside.  They have a great bar area with plenty of stools.  The restaurant is large and full with plenty of booths, tables, and these half booths where both people can face the water.  What a great idea!   All of those were taken so we were seated in a booth with a great view of the water.  \n\nEvery single appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and dessert has a picture that accompanies the description.  Awesome!  I love that.  Everything looked delicious.  We decided on the following:\n\nCrab Chowder- very good\n\nCrab Louie- AMAZING.  I got this as a 'starter' but it could really be your meal.  A hearty portion of crab is served on top of greens.  It comes with asparagus, olives, eggs, and other goodness.  Everything is topped with a thousand island type of dressing.  My description isn't very good, but trust me, you have to try this.  \n\nSea bass in a mild thai curry broth- This was excellent.  The curry broth sounds a little weird, but it fantastic with the fish\n\nSalmon oven poached in olive oil- My salmon was so juicy and tender.  YUM!  The olive oil was great, but I wish I tried something different like the spicy tomato conserva.  All of the fish dishes come with roasted heirloom potatoes, squash, and olives.  Since mine was in olive oil, it didn't keep my potatoes very moist like my boyfriend's dish.\n\nOverall, I would give Franciscan 3.75 stars.", "author": "Vivian W."}

They were long and rectangular...and the silverware was very tacky!  \n\n2.) The menu: One word explains the menu...excessive!  They should spend less money on pretty, overwhelming menus and more on fresh seafood!  There were about 30 pages to the menu.  It was like reading a novel.  The first page gives the items on the menu, but all of the following pages were pictures...\"Where's the crab?  Oh, it's on page 26!\"...ridiculous!\n\n3.) The service: Pretty decent...they kept the bread coming...mostly cuz my dad kept eating all of it!\n\n4.) Finally...the food:  Old frozen crab!  Fresh crab is tender and comes right out of the shell in one piece when you crack the shell.  Frozen crab falls apart and shreds...this crab did the latter!  The shrimp was okay, but only because it was soaked in melted butter and garlic.  The veggies that came with my entree were oversalted and mushy...The crab chowder is starchy and doesn't have much crab in it at all!  \n\nPeople would think that they would get fresh seafood at a restaurant that is located right on the water, but sadly, that is not the case with the Franciscan.

I was born here before 1950, so obviously the area was very different.  I have been to the Franciscan Crab Restaurant at least 7 times in the past two years.  Friends come from Oregon, and Florida; family members from NYC, and I bring them to this restaurant for lunch or dinner. The Franciscan is truly beautiful and has wonderful views of the bay.  The decor is ecclectic and colorful.  The ambiance is both friendly and sophisticated.  The service staff is amazing.  (Of course this may be affected by the attitudes of the guests. Certainly, this is reasonable.)\nI LOVE the food!  The roasted mussels and crab are delicious.  Until I tried the cioppino here, I didn't enjoy it at any restaurant.  It was super flavorful and authentic.  The fish entrees may be a little pricey, but the preparations are fantastic, and if you know what fish to choose, you cannot go wrong.\nI worked in a seafood restaurant in the 70's, and I am very particular because of the education I received while working there.  That, and the way my family used to purchase, cook, and eat seafood during the 50's and 60's lends even more specific preferences to my choices today.\nGive it a shot.  If you are looking to have a good meal in a festive setting, the Franciscan is the place.  Next time, I'm trying the salumi platters!", "author": "janice s."}

We were lucky to get a sunny table with a view of Alcatraz. I was under the impression that Franciscan is one big cruise ship  - it was that close to the water. I told myself that even if the food is bad here - nothing can beat the view. They even have binoculars at the table so you can zoom in to Alcatraz, sea lions and Golden Gate or Bay Bridge.\n     Surprise,surprise! Food was delicious! Every single dish we had from refreshing Foggy Wharf Crab salad to spicy Shrimp Pescatore... My friend was raving about their marinara sauce, which she said should be called \"heaven\". Olive oil poached salmon with rosemary baby potatoes and asparagus saut\u00e9 was phenomenal too!   \n     Oh and I forgot to mention their signature drink - Upscale Blueberry Margarita. Prefect balance of flavors - not too sweet, not too sour, but kicks right in!  Our waitress, who recommended us a drink, was friendly , energetic, but not annoying. She knew exactly what to say and when. \n      I came here mostly for the view, but now I will be back for the food and will bring more friends. Fisherman's wharf is extremely underrated destination for San Francisco locals. Everyone is under impression that the food is terrible and overpriced.  Every other review screams \"tourist trap\", I say give it a try. I've been living at the wharf for the last 3 years and never had a truly terrible dining experience here.

My wife liked it as it was a little spicier than normal clam chowder, not that it was really spicy at all.  I did notice that the actual soupy part was also more grainy than say clam chowder that you would find at the little stalls around Fisherman's Wharf.  My wife got the Basa and I got the crab legs.  The basa was really good, and I did like the cioppino.  The crab legs on the other hand weren't bad, they just weren't spectacular.  I figured \"Crab Restaurant\" can't go wrong with the crab!

The manager gave me a unsympathetic quick apology and assured me that she will have him bring over the check. Finally after waiting and waiting we received our check without any apology or explanation. \n\nI would recommend only coming in here to check out maybe the ambiance, but other than that I would say there are many other options available around Fisherman's Wharf that are extremely better than this place.", "author": "Thania M."}

I would say that my experience at the restaurant was good but I must say I tasted better particularly on the crabs.\n\nWe ordered crab chowder which was nice. The iron roasted mussels was also good but quite a few mussels were over roasted in my opinion as they were very tiny inside their big shells. The sauces that came with the mussels went very well. We had 1 dozen fresh oysters which I felt were really good; relatively big and really fresh. They were gone in minutes.\n\nOur entree was of coz the crab. Ordered lotsa crab which was enough for 2 persons in their signature garlic sauce. The crab was a little bland although you start tasting more as you eat more of the crabs. But I still couldn't really taste that signature sauce. I don't usually dip my food in the butter sauce but I did this time. The butter sauce was mixed with garlic and it did go well. The butter also helped to give the additional flavor which made me wonder if that was the signature sauce.\n\nAnyhow, the crab was really fresh with lots of meat despite being a little bland and the service we got was also good although we didn't get a refill on our coke. Maybe they don't do refills.", "author": "Cutiephinphin L."}

Although the food was good (except for the \"billy club bread\" served with my cioppino, which could have chipped a tooth when bitten into), the service was entirely too slow and completely uneventful.\n\nSince I'm in the service industry, it's hard for me to ignore when the only person to come by the table during our first ten minutes sitting is the busser/food-runner, who had merely dropped off some water and some bread.\n\nOur server, who showed up at about minute 15 or 20, took our orders in a quick manner.  The downside to this was that, given it was my first time here and their menu is about 45 pages too long and extremely confusing to navigate, only provided suggestions in a speaking manner akin to a live auctioneer, and the volume of his voice made it even more difficult to actually take him seriously.  By this time, the bread that the busser/food-runner had given us was already cold and virtually inedible.  Unfortunately, nobody bothered to offer us anything hotter or fresher at any point and time during the meal.\n\nOur server seemed to be simply going through the motions with us and, after watching him interact with some of his other tables, this feeling was confirmed.  One example would be that he only checked on the quality of our meals after 15 minutes with our entrees had passed... most places would notice you have your meals and check back within one or two bites to  make sure things were good.\n\nBeing a believer in karma, I did actually tip despite the uncertainty of who the tip was actually going to (the busser/food-runner did more work for us and the surrounding tables than our server did... I never saw him carry anything out of the kitchen except for one cup of soup, and only saw him pre-bus tables two or three times.  Hell, I overheard our server, who was doing very little at the time, ask this person to vacuum the surrounding area... as if he wasn't already doing plenty to assist this server in doing his job!).  Quite honestly, I hope that this place pools their tips and splits them between all of the tipped employees... I'll be sorely disappointed to discover that our server received 100% of our tips tonight, because he certainly did not deserve the tip that he received from us.\n\nNeedless to say, if I do actually return, I'll sit at the bar - at least the bartenders appeared both competent and interested enough in their jobs to pay attention to their guests.\n\nQuick addition:  Our check was opened at 6:45pm.  Our credit card was run at 8:19pm.  Given that we had water, a lemonade, a cup of soup and a salad, and two entrees, it really shouldn't have kept us in the building for any longer than 55 minutes.  It's a shame that the service bit a big one, because the food was, generally speaking, pretty okay.", "author": "Jay B."}

The place was packed so I figured, hey, if these people chose to go here, then maybe the crab is worth it. Hmmm. I've tasted some crab before and I'd say the Franciscan's crab is around a 3 on a 5-point scale. I've had better.\n\nOn the other hand, I love how they had a view of the bay, overlooking Alcatraz and Angel Island. They have a full bar but I didn't get the chance to get any alcohol since I'm the designated driver, as always! Haha. Speaking of parking, this restaurant validates your parking spot for 2 hours.\n\nI should also say that the seating on the higher level (where they have the booths) is very awkwardly placed. We were sitting at the tables near the ledge and a family of four came to sit on the booth opposite to where we were sitting. It felt weird because they were facing us while we ate. I know some people, like my sister, don't like it when they have spectators watching them eat. I personally have no problem with it but in our seating arrangement, it was pretty inevitable that the family was watching us. I mean come on, we were right there in their peripheral vision.\n\nBut anyway, all in all, 3 stars out of 5. Thank goodness for the prix fixe menu.

This restaurant is right smack dab on the pier, and it seems to be designed like a cruise ship. We had an early dinner at around 6, and the place wasn't too packed--very pleasant. We were seated in the middle (not bottom) floor overlooking the bay; there was also heated outdoor seating. It was my little brother's birthday celebration so our group consisted of 4 adults and 3 kids under 9. Our waiter came and took our orders, as I ordered the salmon (medium) cooked with the olive oil selection. Our food came quickly, only after about 10 minutes ordering. Our calamari appetizer was so-so, but it came quickly and satisfied our grumbling stomachs. For dessert, we ordered the house \"kustard\" which, when arrived was huge! Like a goblet of cream...MMMMM. Also, the MacGyver in me realized that I could place the rest of this \"kustard\" in my little brother's childrens cup. Which I did. On the way home, I had my custom \"kustard\" shake! MMMMMM!

Who doesn't like the retro feel this place offers? I swear it sucked me in or maybe I was trying to flee from the starving artist outside!\n\nI had to have crab so I ordered a whole Dungeness Crab and my friend had one of the fixed meals. Overall, I thought the crab was melt in your mouth goodness. However, I did not like the secret garlic sauce. Maybe it's because mine wasn't really sauce...it was overly cooked garlic sans butter. I had to ask for a side of butter. If I'm going to consume a whole crab, I'm going to smoother the hell out of it in butter too! :)\n\nIt's a little over priced here but come on, if Crab is what you want this is the place. Plus, people watching is at it's best both in and out of the restaurant. You've got a ton of tourist inside awaiting there fish feast and outside you've got a starving artist trying to guilt the tourist into supporting his meth habit.

We got Crab Fondue as an appetizer and prefix dinner menu along with some drinks. First of all, it took more than 40 minutes to get our appetizer. Then one of our drinks never came until we asked for it an hour into the meal. The appetizer was very good though.\nThe first course, salad/soup, came so late that we actually had to ask to see what is going on in the kitchen. The salad/soup finally came, and the waiter did not take away our plates for appetizer. Our table was unnecessarily overflowing with used plates.\nThen the main course came. To my surprise, the waiter tried to place the main course in front of me without taking away the plates from appetizer and salad. Does he not see all these plates on our table and there is no place to put the main course? We ordered prefix course dinner. Isn't it normal to remove the previous plates before putting a new meal on the table? We told the waiter that he should remove the used plates first before serving us more plates. \nTo top it off, one of the main courses was crab. We were never given crab crackers.  Were we at a crab restaurant? How can they serve crab without crab cracker tools? By this point, we knew that the service was ridiculous. We finally got the crab cracker after reminding the waiter that we need cracker tools. We were sharing the crab plate, so we expected to get 4 sets, but we were given only one set. We didn't even bother to ask for more because we were getting pretty tired at the service at this point. \nThe dessert was a plain soft serve ice cream served in a glass cup. Very disappointing. \n\nFood was fair - I wouldn't say it was worth the money though. But the service was probably the worst I have ever seen in SF. Considering that it's a pretty pricey restaurant ($45/person), I expected the service to be better. I don't expect the waiters to check up on the table frequently and be all friendly, even though that is what I would normally get from a restaurant in this price range.

Because it was my day off I didn't want to waste anytime by spending the day lagging and lounging around the house. My boyfriend and I decided to drive down to the pier and enjoy this bright sunny day. We originally were going to eat at Joe's Crab Shack, but decided on eating here at the Franciscan. Somewhere we've never been before. I've walked the pier numerous times, but have never stopped to notice this restaurant.\n\nWe walked up to the front and entered the restaurant without hesitation. The hostess greeted us right away.  She quickly sat us at a booth infront of their tall wide windows. As soon as I glanced to my left I was in total awe with the amazing view. The sky was lit brighter than ever and in the distance I could see Alcatraz. We sat down at our table and the hostess handed us our menus.  The menus looked like a thick book. It must have been at least 1.5 inches thick. The menu was very detailed with pictures and had full descriptions of everything ranging from anti-pasta, appetizers, entrees, and desserts.\n\nWe each ordered a cup of chowder. He had the crab chowder and I had the clam chowder. I didn't order a bread bowl, because they had already served us complimentary bread and butter. For our main course we ordered the Double Mussels and Double Crab on a sizzling plate for two. Let me tell you, it was great! The dish was bursting with flavors. Both the mussels and the crab legs were still freshly hot. You could see the steam rising from the platter. I ate slow and basked all the flavors of the spices and sauce in my mouth. Instead of scarfing it all down in one fast sitting I took my time without rushing one bite.\n\nAs a first timer, I have to say that my first experience here at this restaurant was excellent! Our waiter was extremely friendly and did not rush us. After we finished our meal they cleaned our table and removed all the dirty plates. Our waiter asked if we would like to look over the dessert menu, but I kindly passed. He then responded \"Okay, but if you'd like we have small dessert cups that we offer for free. Would you like two of them?\" I told him we'd take one. Only because I know I wasn't going to finish all of mine if I got my own. I'm not big on sweets. So, the boyfriend and I shared one of their dessert cups in which they gave a generous amount of vanilla icecream. By the time we were finish I definitely was full and satisfied with what we had ordered.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is interested in eating at a brightly lit restaurant with superb customer service. The restaurant has a 50's feel with black and white pictures surrounding the walls. Plus, who doesn't like crab? You won't want to pass on this spectacular restaurant and their delicious food.", "author": "Cassie D."}

Prices are mostly fair, keeping in mind that you are dining in the Wharf. Blood orange margarita it's perfectly sour with your preference of tequila; in my case patron silver. Ask for the Cucumber Gin martini as I don't believe it's featured on the menu anymore, but certainly packs a refreshing punch. I started off with the prosciutto plate along with octopus crustini and yellowtail carpaccio which the latter being my absolute favorite. Nice hint of pronounced acidity served with table bread to absorb all the good oils and flavors. Service was friendly a little slow if you're expecting a timely meal. All in all a well favored 4 *'s.", "author": "John P."}

However I don't know if we really received 3 crabs.  Didn't seem like it.  But the flavor was good, not as good as Mama's Garlic and Butter Crab of course.  But delicious.\n\nI had the mini Fillet Mignon with their Yukon Mashed Potatoes.  OMG!!! You have to try it, meat was like Buttah and the mashed potatoes, yup to die for!\n\nMy boyfriend had the Spicy Shrimp Pasta, also delicious.  My sister had the Thai Curry Halibut, which smelled like curry but was missing the curry flavor. \n\nFor dessert we had the Lemon Tart with Vanilla Frozen Kustard.  I don't generally like lemon but I loved this thing.  I'd go back just for dessert.  My sister and her boyfriend ordered just the Vanilla Frozen Kustard and it came out in a HUGE gauntlet, we had to help them eat it cause I don't think they would've finished it on their own LOL.\n\nOh, and be careful with ordering drinks they're not cheap.\n\nAll in all it was a delicious night.  Granted the bill came to $420 for 6 of us.  But we definitely recommend it!  Oh and I forgot to mention they have binoculars at the window seats so you can check out the view.  Not as useful at night of course LOL.", "author": "Nissa Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-21", "description": "Hubby and I got into town on Tuesday night and was starving. We wanted fresh seafood and decided to try this restaurant since it is in prime location. We called as we were walking over there in case it was busy. We got a busy signal during both times we called. Arrived at restaurant and walked up the stairs to hostess stand. Two girls were there and one led us to our table and took off without a word. I should have known what kind of dinner we were in for. I will break this down into two categories:\n\nFood - we were given a 6 inch loaf of bread with butter to munch on. It was hard and dry. We ordered a small size calamari which was greasy and the squid was not fresh at all. It tasted old. So disappointed. I ordered the seafood linguine which consisted of 2 small crab legs, 1 small crab claw, some clams, squid, 3shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce. The sauce was creamy and sweet which was described as a clam/Worcestershire combo. Every seafood item in the dish was not fresh. You would think that a restaurant that was in prime Fisherman's Wharf would serve fresh seafood. My hubby ordered the spicy shrimp pasta. He did not enjoy his dish either and it had a small quantity of shrimp. Both entrees were small portion for price. He ordered sweet tea and I had water. The water tasted gross and unclean so I squeezed 4 slices of lemon to make it better.  Total price tag was about $78 before tax. Way too expensive for the portion size. \n\nService- bad hostess- I see why the phone kept ringing- they were too busy socializing and playing on their smart phones to pick up the phone. Btw, they were not busy- plenty of empty tables. Our waitress was very nice but was not around much at the end of our dinner- we kept having to track her down. We received more attentive service from the guy who was the assistant waiter. \n\nLocation- we were seated next to the serving cart where they placed the prepped bread/butter plates. They also keep silverware and other items there. It was noisy and when they cleared tables, we could hear the banging noises behind us.\n\nOverall summary- bland food, not fresh seafood, slow meh service, expensive.  I would never come here again. Please be aware that this place did not serve fresh seafood during our dining experience.", "author": "C C."}

I was prepared to have a decent wait to get a table; instead our party of four was seated immediatly. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who seated us in a booth with a view of Alcatraz. I felt bad for our poor waiter who kept trying to welcome us to the restaurant and start us off with drinks; he was very polite and apologized for interrupting conversation (I was reuniting with my college roommate who was visiting from out of town and I had not seen her for 9 years). Eventually after checking on us about three time we decided on what we wanted to order. Our waiter also was able to have great conversation with us when we allowed him too lol. The four of us each ordered the 3 course meal for $30 a person. \nI had the house salad with a vinaigrette dressing. I usually am a honey mustard girl but sadly they did not have that dressing. The salad had tomatoes, sun flower seeds, onions, and avocado. Followed by the crab enchilada which was beyond amazing! Lastly we had the frozen custard. The \"custard\" was good but I think it needs to be renamed. I had expected a custard like texture but instead I really felt it was a cup of vanilla ice cream that had melted half way. \nAll the dishes had been presented in the appropriate type of plating except for the custard. I was disappointed to see it served in a glass tumbler cup. \nAll in all we had a wonderful dinner and meet up.", "author": "Kristen B."}

She had received some gift certificates that were good here and we decided to come here for a light lunch.\n\nWe enjoyed the decor which I can only qualify as well maintained 50s style with pictures of old actors and famous patrons adorning the walls.  The view was quite nice so we were hopeful after the great lunch we had the day before at Castinolas although the feel of the place seemed a bit cold and uninviting to me.\n\nThey brought us bread and butter and I was surprised at how good and fresh the bread was.  There had been comments in some of the other reviews about how hard the bread was but this style of bread is made to be crusty and was well executed.  I had similar fresh baked bread in New York and Costa Rica and this reminded my sister of the bread she would get in France when she lived in Lille.\n\nWe both ordered the crab sandwich with fries and an inexpensive bottle of wine to split between us to keep the theme and price similar to the meal we had the day before.  The crab was sweet and fresh, but the bread was reminiscent of the cheap store brand sesame egg hamburger buns you get at Safeway when they've been sitting around for a few days.  I didn't hate the sandwich but I didn't enjoy it, especially for around $15 each when I knew for the price of this sandwich I could get the ingredients and make four of these bad boys and have it come out 100 times better.  The french fries were pretty good but not as good as I had the day before.\n\nThe wine we got was okay.  I wish we had sprung for the Chardonnay instead of the wine we got which was a bit too sweet for our meal but we wanted to keep things about the same price for comparison. With tip the meal we had was a little over $60 for the two of us, almost exactly the same as our meal the day before at Castinolas only this meal was just okay and we didn't get dessert.  \n\nThere is a good chance that if we had spent $60 each instead of $30 each we would have had a much better experience but even if that is the case I think it is sad when a restaurant doesn't take the same care and pride in planning and preparing all of their offerings.\n\nI would not return here for lunch.  If this place serves mediocre to good food I would likely only come here in the right company for drinks, appetizers, and bread.  I could be convinced to try some of their more popular dishes provided the drinks are strong enough to loosen the grip on my wallet or someone else was paying and it wouldn't be my first choice by far.\n\nMeh.

I had a cup of clam chowder, crab enchiladas and ice cream for $24.95.  I don't think I would get the crab enchiladas again though because they were so rich.  I think I will stick with the crab legs which is what I usually order.", "author": "Holly R."}

But don't let that dissuade you, since you'll be missing out on a great view, old yet updated San Francisco charm, and surprisingly tasty food.\n\nParking is a cinch - they validate for up to 3 hours for nearby restaurants, and walking up to the restaurant is impressive enough - there is a sense of history here, neon sign and all. It's a large space inside, bustling when we went in on a Sunday evening. If you can, request one of the curved booths, great for four people, yet intimate enough for two.\n\nFood options are decided seafood-oriented, but there are some hearty beef options as well. This is not a place for vegetarians, nor does it need to try to be.\n\nWe started with the burrata, a house-made creamy mozzarella, drizzled in olive oil, that was literally like a spread it was so soft. A nice complement is an assortment of meats: prosciutto, coppa, mortadella, salame, all imported from Italy no less. You can choose all four, which is what we did.\n\nFor a middle course, we went with the crab & smoked salmon crostinis, which were a nice spin on a regular appetizer. For entrees, you can order all kinds of fresh fish and pair it with a favorite sauce or cooking style, and the servings are large. We actually opted to go with the iron skillet roasted mussels & crab, which honestly I don't remember having crab more delicious. Piping hot, seasoned just right, and with a bib to catch any of the excess glorious mess, we were in seafood heaven. \n\nOur waiter Tom was great as well, very friendly, checking in on us at just the right occasions, and that only added to the experience. We also tried a few different glasses of wine with each course, and these also complimented the varied dishes quite nicely (Tom was there to offer suggestions as well).\n\nFor dessert, and trust me you want to leave room somehow, make sure you to get their fresh made frozen \"kustard\" which is simply outstanding. Reminded me of Coney Island or something.\n\nFor a special occasion, or when the parents are in town, I'll be sure to return to the Franciscan. It's definitely a little pricey, but as with many good things in life, it's worth it.", "author": "Nish N."}

And you need a good view of the Bay, because if you make eye contact with your food, you're going to throw up in your mouth a little.  And no one wants that.\n\nIt is no surprise that the Franciscan is located deep in the heart of the Tourist District.  I'm sure that the fine folks from Oklahoma City and Des Moines just love the cuisine, since it's very similar to what they eat at Long John Silver's, Appleby's, and any restaurant whose subtitle is \"A Family Restaurant.\"  If you put this restaurant on Valencia, in the Castro, or in Noe Valley, it would be closed in less than a month.  My only regret is that when the tourists go back to Ypsilanti, they will talk to their friends about how they \"ate in a real San Francisco restaurant\" and will be taking about the Franciscan.  I shudder just thinking about it.\n\nOne more good point about this restaurant: you'll get absolutely awful food, but you will get an amazing quantity of it.  One of my fellow diners got the fish stew, which I think was served in a 3-gallon toureen.  Upside: your dog will have a lot to eat.  Downside: he'll hate you for feeding him this.  Even dogs have standards.\n\nIf you find yourself in the neighborhood of the Franciscan and an international terrorist forces you to eat food in 10 minutes or he'll nuke Greenland, either buy a chili bowl at Boudin's or eat your own left arm.  But don't go to the Franciscan.", "author": "Ben P."}

I remember glancing up at the Chihuly glass pendant lights, the hundreds of black and white celebrity photos from the '50s through the early '80s bedecking the entryway -- and retorting, \"WHO WOULD WANT TO EAT THERE?!\" I pictured that people who ate there were the sorts whose clothes smelled like mothballs, and didn't care about farting in public anymore.\n\n--- However, I did eat there about a week ago.\nThe bread (from Boudin Bakery across the way) was deliciously toasted and crisp and crunchy and tangy: classic San Francisco sourdough bread. The butter was a bit cold, like it was literally unwrapped in the kitchen and plopped onto a ceramic dish. They were placed on a wire dish rack which was a terrible idea as the bread dish was leaf-shaped, and the rack was clearly designed for round dishes. We nearly broke the dish while tearing off hunks of bread (while waiting for our orders) and moving the plate around was a bit annoying ... but the views were great, if you could get past all that neon.\n\nOur Octopus Conduti was fine. The seasoned beans were tasty and the sliced octopus tentacles chewy and rubbery, but otherwise fine. Maybe it was the 2-3 cocktails we had while waiting for our bread refills and meal. The actual entrees were decent, though I won't say that it was my favorite clam chowder.\n\nMy favorite clam chowder still comes from a can & a can opener.\nMy favorite breads, though, ...

I ordered fried skate, I think that's what it was, quite tasty. My wife ordered the seafood Chiopino (spelling not sure) and we loved it. The flavor, texture, amount of seafood-an unexpected delight. We could not stop talking about it the rest of the night, but we are unabashed foodies. We tried another place the next night and was disappointed, so we came back here the following night and ordered a large chiopino. Wish this place was in Chicago we'd go all the time.

We were seated immediately on a Saturday night. We must have just lucked out because a flood of people came in right after us. \n\nFirst, we were impressed with the menus! I'm a visual person and LOVED the fact that they had pictures of everything on the menu. I don't like surprises and as a result, hardly ever deviate from the norm. When I ordered the crab fondue appetizer, I knew exactly what I was getting!\n\nFood: Started with the SPLASH: guava juice+ champagne. I wished there was more guava, but it wasn't terrible. The crab fondue was wonderfully fattening and I felt the hours spent at the gym go right out the door. I had the dungeness crab with the secret garlic sauce, and it was wonderful! My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten the bigger portion. :) We also had the crab enchiladas which I had my doubts about but was surprisingly tasty! We ended with the house made kustard ice cream. A fresh, tasty, reasonably priced meal (considering it's seafood). \n\nThe our server was friendly but overworked. We felt bad for him but he was always tentative, friendly and if I he was in the middle of something when we asked for something, he was honest/polite about it with a, \"I'll be right with you\"-and he would come right back. Understaffed possibly? Maybe someone called in sick?\n\nWhen we asked what time they closed the hostess told us that, \"it depends\". She attributed it to the recession and said that they had been closing at 9pm since its been slow, but will stay open as late as 11pm. Not ideal, but it wouldn't stop us from trying to catch this place.\n\nIf you can find parking in the lot in front of the restaurant, they will validate! yay!

It came out on a hot skillet and from the first bite to the very last, it was so good! I would come here again just for the crab! We also had the crab chowder, and that was just MEHHhhh to me. It wasn't anything great or out of the ordinary for what we were charged for it. At 10$ for a teeny, tiny cup, you would expect something better. There was actually quite a bit of crab inside, but it was too salty for me, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.\n\nOne star off because our server TOM was horrible.

So one of those things was to eat seafood on Fisherman's Wharf.  After looking through the strip, Franciscan is always one that I forget about being so far detached.  So we looked at the menu and decided, that shall be the place for today.\n\nWe walked up the stairs and it was so fascinating seeing all the black and white photos of celebrities along the walls.  I think I was only about to name MAYBE 1/4 of them.  They sat us promptly and right next to the window for the seaside view!  The cookbook menus were a unique sight for me to see, there was a photo of EVERY FOOD ITEM on the menu.  Visual cues are always helpful.  He ordered a latte and we decided to split a half order of dungeness crab with their proclaimed \"secret garlic sauce\".  The sourdough bread to start was yummy, not the best, but it did the trick.  But the crab, that was truly divine.  We got to wear the oh so fun plastic bibs, metal claw crackers and mini forks in our hands to attack the awesomeness!  The \"secret garlic sauce\" was impressive and that 1 1/2 pounds was enough for the two of us to be content.\n\nThere was even binoculars bolted on a chain next to the window, so you were able to really look far out into the bay and get a better glimpse of Alcatraz.  That was a clever idea.\n\nOur waiter was very polite, even helped us tie the bibs on and opened out wet-naps.  Or maybe that just made his job easier.  Either way, he was quite courteous.\n\nAll in all, it is pricey but that's what you get for atmosphere and location.

Even the prices give the indication that this is better than your local Joe's Crab Shack or Hooters. However, the element of surprise that destroys the atmosphere is how everyone patron is under-dressed. This is due of course to the restaurant's location being centralized within the grand central station of tourist travels. Most have their fanny packs pushed to the side sticking out into the aisle and visor pushed up onto their head. \n\nNow onto the food. I had the Olive Oil Oven Roasted Tilapia. It was one of the fish options where you can choose a fish and then choose how it's cooked. A little oil soaked for my taste, but I'm a \"healthy\" eater, so my preference would be to just eat it without any oil... It came with a rosemary accent piece on top and potatoes/olives/asparagus on the side. \n\nMy friends ordered a side dish of asparagus and it was enough for two people to share rather than each person getting a separate side.\n\nThe free bread and butter was a little hard and crumbly, but it was a staple sourdough bread. \n\nProbably won't go back unless more friends come into town who want to real tourist feel, but it's probably one of the best places near pier 39.", "author": "Matt H."}

He apologized and told us it was accidentally given to the wrong table and another was being made for us. This really ticked me off because the whole night the servers kept coming to each table confused as to who ordered what exactly.

Not even close to what you would expect for the price. We ordered the \"lotsa crab\" which came out to us on a sizzling hot pan.

I asked for just some plain garlic butter and they brought me the same very stinky fishy smelling butter. My husband and I both had the same reaction. Pew. The crab itself, once I washed all the sauce off with lemon juice, was very Good!  Our food was not an anomaly. This is just the way they make their food, according to the waiter.

It was between here and the Fisherman's Grotto but the yelp reviews on the latter were less-than-pleased.  \n\nThe 50's-esque diner decor on the outside was somewhat gaudy, but we enjoyed the cozy red booths with dark wood trim.  Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a great view of the area. Though it was dark, it was still nice to be near the windows.\n\nA soon as we sat down, a crusty loaf of bread and a block of butter arrived.  I was disappointed that the bread wasn't warm but it was handy later on with the soup. We ordered a bottle of the Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($29), which paired well with the Crab Chowder.  As a native Marylander, I'm used to a crab soup but not chowder.  Creamy in texture, it also had large chunks of sweet crab meat. However, there was something still lacking -- blandness? in complexity? -- and I'm not sure it warrants the $10 price tag. I sopped up the rest of the soup with the extra bread we had leftover and was sated.\n\nNow for the main course - we are 3 small ladies, so we went with Lotsa Crab (3+ lbs for $50) and the Flash Fried Broccolini ($8) and Zucchini Fritti ($8) as sides.  We were in for a lot of FRIED things!  \n\nWhen the crab came out, it was steaming hot and (I think) soaked in butter. Again, mild disappointment as I would prefer to dip the crabmeat in butter myself, but it was still very tasty.  Broccolini had just the right amount of crunch and salt, as did the Zucchini Fritti.  Still - everything we ordered was fried and/or had a lot of butter so not the healthiest ideas.\n\nOverall, ended up being pricey but fun.  The service was prompt and there when needed.

The food...we ordered the short ribs which came with spinach and mashed potatoes - the ribs were so tender and flavorful as we're the other items.  My Dad ordered the Sea Bass with cous cous....it was delicious, delicate and the flavors came together very nicely.  My daughter ordered the fish and chips off the kids menu and I figured it would be your standard fare - something generic and average but no!  The fish looked flaky, delicious and the fries were SO good.  The coffee was fabulous and the strawberry sundae....\"pause\"...well...my husband said, \"there is something wrong with that....it's just TOO good....how can it be that good?\"  Need I say more?  The only not so great thing I have to say is that I was disappointed with the chicken Alfredo : (. It wasn't bad at all...it just lacked a little flavor.

Hubby couldn't decide and just picked a random place where there's cheaper turkey and found Franciscan.  His thought was that he got turkey and I got seafood.  (He HATES seafood, BTW.)  \n\nNow some of the reviews here were QUITE negative and some were very positive, so I said to myself that I should at least TRY it just to see what's going on and to say that I've been here.\n\nHubby ordered the au-jus steak sandwich instead of the turkey, since he was all fulled from brunch earlier today.  (The other reason is that the only thing he could eat off that Thanksgiving menu was the turkey with stuffing.  He can't touch the dairy in the clam chowder or the mashed potatoes or gravy... plus he hates seafood!!!  He does not like pumpkin pie either... though he could have offered the dessert to me instead!!!  *evil grin*\n\nUmmmm... he didn't look too happy with the au jus sandwich  And just to prove his point, he did NOT offer his fries to me to share, which usually means that it's REALLY bad fries!!!\n\nI ordered the crab/salmon crostini instead of the crab cocktail... I recommend staying with the crab cocktail.  The stuff came with this cheese and olive oil dip which looked disgusting.  I took a small taste of it and immediately went YEEEECH and asked our waitress to bring cocktail sauce for me.\n\nI also got the cast iron mussels.  Now... there's one problem... I ordered the garlic shrimp AND mussels, medium size.  Turns out I'm gladI didn't get the shrimp b/c the mussels were gonna be filling.  But again, the dipping sauce of lemon butter is NOT a good choice.  WAAAAY too heavy!!!  I would recommend getting a few wedges of lemon instead.  \n\nThe worst part is that when I left, my stomack was NOT happy at all and I was terrified that I ended up with food poisoning..  I am RELIEVED though that was the case -- just a bad case of indigestion.  But for a couple of hours, it was QUITE scary for me....\n\nTheir saving grace was the waitress was nice and service was pretty reasonable.

The house cocktails would be much better if they had a better selection. I had to name off several bourbons and single malts after scanning the wine list, before I finally settled on one of their house recipes, which as I said, was good, but it was made with Jim Beam, and I did not go to the Fisherman's Wharf to drink Jim Beam.

Dinner started with 6 decent raw oysters, a good salad and a so so cocktail (now know I'm not a fan of blood orange drinks). I thought with views like this, in one of the most expensive cities in the world how much seafood would a 39.95 mussels, crab and shrimp skillet be? I was wrong, it easily would feed two. Loaded with seasoning, salt, garlic and butter it was a Cardiologist's nightmare but oh so good! I sat at that table for two hours and finished it all while I watched the sun set over the bay. I never felt rushed, service was discreet but attentive. If you want a place to wow someone this is it.

They do not honor reservations so if you plan on going on a busy night, go somewhere else. We made a reservation a month earlier so my family and I would have somewhere nice to eat on Christmas Day.  We get there, it is packed, we push our way thru the crowd to the hostess and say we have a reservation and we'd like to check in.  She says check in is at the back of the line (at least 25 people deep) and doesn't even take our name down. Rude, rude, rude. So here we are, standing out by the street on Christmas Day, in the cold, waiting in a huge line.  No organization at all, people walking in off the street, half the people saying they have a reservation and being told to go back to the end of the line and wait to check in. Great way to spend your Christmas evening right? And now you have no choice but to wait because it's Christmas Day and everything else is booked or closed!

I believe it was even painted that awful Nassau green or whatever that popular blue green color was back then when even cars were painted that shade along with two-tone cream.  It used to just scream \"Tourists Only, Locals Beware!\" \nWell. \nSo when we came up with a group of 12  to tour the nearby USS Pampanito WWII submarine and the USS Jeremiah O'Brien\"Brien a WWII Liberty Ship that are moored practically next door to this restaurant, someone suggested we go in to the Franciscan or lunch. It was with great foot dragging that my husband and I accepted but  we were outnumbered and had been suggesting going to another place a block away which we knew was good.\nSo, in we went and spent a long time perusing the cute cookbook menus. While they are obviously an adorable gimmick, it takes too long to read them and figure out where the prices are and then have to try and chose.\nNot to worry. We both settled on the crab enchiladas. They were delicious in a strange sort of way since the sauce they came in was a marinara sauce and not a red or green chile sauce. Good, but more like fusion food than anything faintly Mexican, if Mexican was what they were attempting,\nOur service could not have been more expert.  Eva W. was our wait person  and she treated us as she had just graduated with her master's degree from the table waiter school of restaurant training, Excellent and adept attention to each member of our party and everything was carried out with finesse and graciousness.   She acted interested in us and making sure our every need was cared for and all but opened the door for us as we left. \nAnother thing we liked was that we had asked for separate checks and this was attentively seen to without complaint plus the management added an 18% tip-- as we were a group. I'd have sooner the management had gone ahead and just made it an even 20% because this gal made it worth while. \nEveryone was thrilled with the food and its unusual presentation, the only thing that was out of place were the glass rectangular plates on the tables, they were used to put our bread and butter on, the SF sourdough was very fine, by the way, but the plates should have been removed when the entrees arrived if only to save table space. Also each table had a large white bowl with wire contraption on top placed in the center and waiting as if all diners expected to be served a  cioppino  but all I could see was that these strange bowl contraptions took up unnecessary table space and were in the way. \nAll in all  I would say that if we find ourselves at Fisherman's Wharf again any time soon we will go back to the Franciscan.", "author": "Elizabeth B."}

So i i advise not to order the Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese Salad. The crab cakes look good. She said ther were good but i don't know. \nTo top it off we had the Wild Strawberry Italian Cheesecake. Now that.....that was some damm good cheesecake. I know in my review i said i didn't like light cheesecakes but i liked this one. It was so strawberry-ey!! I was like heavy heavy whip cream light. It came with some delicious vanilla ice cream too. I enjoyed every bite of that!!!\n\nIt is a tourist trap but the was my whole reason to go (and to have good food). To have my family see, eat, and enjoy San Francisco all at once.", "author": "RAy J."}

I was excited sitting at the bar waiting to be seated because the place looks realllly nice.  The view is awesome and it's really cutely decorated/set up.  Then I took a look at the menu, which was literally a little cook book with instructions on how to make the food and pictures for everythingg! I love seeing what i'm going to eat before hand. And I figured looking at the prices and the menu and the overall decor/location, that the food should match.\nUnfortunately, the fish wasn't that fresh, the clam chowder was really peppery and in my opinion had too many little things added to it like celery and potatoes.  The calamari was pretty good, nothing exceptional. But OH MY GOD, the squash/potatoes served with the fish in the soy ginger glaze were SO delishhh. Mmm. I stole them off of my friend's uncle's plate while he went to the bathroom. Heh. A friend said that she came the other night and the fish was like butter and super fresh, so maybe they were just having an off night.

Crab Louie & SF sourdough bread at The Franciscan became one of my favorite San Francisco mid-day meal traditions, repeated at least a dozen times since then.  This was my 1st return in about 15 years.\n     It's changed: greatly expanded in size, still great Bay views, has lost some of its intimacy and the bread is fresh, crispy & excellent French baguette but no longer sourdough.   Originally a family owned business, it's now clearly part of a larger multi-restaurant corporate entity.  The Franciscan's menu has expanded greatly from the simpler, but excellent basic seafood menu of the past.  But remember, basic in San Francisco represents a fresh & delightful variety for any seafood lover. \n     The Crab Louie came in a different presentation of the same variety of ingredients (plenty of fresh Dungeness crabmeat, Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, sliced egg, other garnishes and a superb Louie dressing).  In 15 years, the price has gone from 14.95 to 19.95.  \n     My wife ordered the black linguini & clams in garlic, olive oil and seasoning, and comments,  \"It was excellent.\" \n     The house [Franciscan] chardonnay was above average and worthy of a 2nd glass.\n     Our server was cheerful, patient & reasonably attentive. \n     Enjoy!", "author": "Allan A."}

We started the evening off with one half a Dungeness crab for an appetizer - it was out to us immediately, almost scary, \"did it even get cooked.\" they must have had them ready to go. And it did taste fresh still. It was very nice! When eating on the wharf, it's all about the fresh fish. You can get pasta or salads anywhere. I choose the Sea Bass, it was cooked sotto' Olio. Not sure what that actually means, but oh boy... it's surprising. A rosemary leaf laid across a healthy steak cut, still in its fry pan with squash, potatoes and the real olives, that have that tangy zest.

It was Sunday morning, and it took us a while to get ready, but we were off, and you could literally see how excited my friends were by them jumping up and down in the car. It was Mother's day, crazy time to find parking, so we ended up paying $20 to park at a lot with long lines going in and also coming out. \nOk, so we finally arrived at the wharf, what a mob scene; there were people everywhere, tourists and locals all walking around looking for over-priced food in dirty locations. We were walking around, and you can literally see the thought bubble above my friends' heads \"CRAB!\" \nAway from the mob scene, we found this restaurant, it was located in front of the water, and the location immediately caught our attention. \"Great location\", I thought, \"must be expensive\", so I studied the menu carefully outside, when I turned around, all my friends were already inside getting us a table. I thought to myself, what kind of restaurant would have seats for lunch on Mother's Day? Well, apparently this place is more than 80% empty, this should be another warning sign. The menu came, and my friends suddenly became quiet, they are not used to this kind of prices from their neck of the woods, but hey, I just followed them in here. We ordered: medium mussels on skillet, Crab cakes, and \"Lotsa crab\" to share. The mussels were pretty good, fresh and hot, you can't really screw up mussels, as long as they are fresh. The crab cake sucked! It was two tiny pieces of deep fried dough, yeah, I can see the crab inside, but com'on, these things were like a bite each! \nNow, for the main entree, crab. The crab was smothered in garlic and oil to make it flavorful. What I couldn't understand is why don't they just crack the shells a little so the garlic flavor can get to the meat? Instead, they overpower the dish with so much oil, trying to compensate for the bland crab meat? The crab dish was $50 and wasn't even that good. I didn't want to say this in front of my friends, but at least they got their crab craving out of the way. The bill was around $100 with tips and taxes, and we were still hungry. We kept on getting more bread at the end  because our stomach was still empty. I guess I should thank my lucky star because I didn't get sick after the meal, because that was probably the only good thing going for this restaurant, and the great location (this is why they got the two stars). \nThe worst part, they wouldn't validate our parking at the end.", "author": "Toshinobu K."}

They do have a good blood orange margarita...that is when you can get it.  My waitress would put in our order and we wouldn't see it come through for 20 to 25 minutes.  Got to the point where she had to start bringing the drinks out herself because the runners weren't getting it done.  Food was sub par.  Got the grilled shrimp and mussels for the appetizer.  The shrimp was crazy salty and I felt they were trying to cover the fishyness with to much butter.  Now on to fish and chips.  We were visiting from Dallas TX and I have had better Fried fish at a red lobster.  The breading tasted like something I would eat at a carnival.  It tasted like it had been dipped in funnel cake batter.

Yelpers recommend certain appetizers, so we all shared the crab fondue to start which was too cheezy.  The calamari wins again!  After warming up our taste buds, we moved on to entrees.  Halibut and Salmon were ordered by our fishy friends, while I got the crab enchilladas and the birthday girl got her mother of all -- filet mignon with crab.  Ow ow!  I expected something more of the crab enchilladas as it was too lumpy, if you can call it that.  Personally, the crab enchilladas at Don Ramon's are better to best.  Like the romantic couple that we are, we fed each other parts of our meal.  Her filet mignon was pretty good, but again, I expected something else of the crab.  The Franciscan Crab Restaurant is a member of a chain of other restaurants which include the Stinking Rose, Calzone's, and BoBo's among others in the Bay Area.  BoBo's does their crab differently, and by differently I mean heavy on the French influence (Butter!)  I believe that if we were served with the same butter experience here as BoBo's, then we'd come back sooner granted we don't have a heart attack first.  All in a call, our ressies here proved a great birthday treat for the little lady.  I recommend calling in for a seat early and absolutely near a window view during the day!", "author": "Michael B."}

I want to start with the good parts. The service and atmosphere were wonderful. The view was amazing. The waiter (Rhys) was great and attentive. Cocktails were done well. The appetizers were good. The prosciutto was awesome, the crab chowder pretty good, not amazing. Now for the bad. We ordered the \"Lotsa Crab\" and shared. The crab came hot and covered in this muddy substance. It was not a delicious seasoning although I think that is what it was supposed to be. The actual crab meat was cooked ok, but this muddy stuff really detracted from what is a delicious meat. My husband also bit into something that was so foul he almost threw up at the table. He is a little shy so he didn't want me to talk to the wait staff but I think the restaurant should know. I suspect that a crab burst in the water because he described a bile taste. Had the crab been done well this would have been a 5 star review", "author": "Amanda B."}

The salad was...ok...the crab was good, liked the roasted part, but was covered, I mean COVERED, in their garlic sauce.  It was messy and I was really tired of it by the end of crab fest.  The busboy that kept handing us wet naps was the savior of the experience, so we tipped him on the side.  Oh, and the windows were dirty, so the whole bay view was a little crusty looking.

Best location on Fisherman's wharf and every table has a view.  I would recommend ordering fresh San Francisco seafood:  fresh Hog Island oysters and the Dungessness Crab.  Oysters were fresh and excellent, and at $2 each I think reasonably priced.  The Roast Crab Feast at $100 is said to be for 4 persons, but I think it was enough for 6 people.

So we decided to eat at the Franciscan.  I opted for a half order of crab since I was still quite full from the clam chowder in a bread bowl from those stands.  The menu stated 1+ pounds.  When my crab came out 7 minutes after we ordered, it was a mere two small legs slapped onto an iron skillet.  It was clear that the skillet just came out of the oven, but the crab was luke warm, like they had nuked in the microwave for a minute.  The secret garlic sauce isn't great at all and actually tastes kinda curry-esque.  I was actually okay with my meal until we were leaving and the table next to us ordered the same thing and their crab legs were presented in a S pattern and was swimming in half a cm of butter.  WTF?  I was pissed, it looked nothing like mine.  Had we still been eating, I would have certainly complained, but it was too late.  Take your hard earned $ elsewhere.

It was very refreshing although a lot more tart than I expected.  One friend ordered the Redheaded Smoothie which was absolutely delicious.  The crab & chard fondue was great, although I would not call it a \"fondue,\" which implies something cheesy and saucy.  This was more like a dip.  My friends liked it too.  The soy ginger tilapia was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  One friend got the Thai coconut curry sea bass, also delicious.  To top everything off, they shared the chocolate mousse made with Valrhona chocolate that was to die for!  I had the lemon tart.  Both desserts came with their homemade frozen custard.  The service was perfect from start to finish.  The restaurant was not busy so we were able to linger over our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, courteous, and efficient.

This place was a disappointment in so many ways. It was obvious they rely on tourists for their business because they were not overly polite and had substandard food quality. My first impression was of the sitting area where they apparently have the bread service area as well. Well, let me tell you, if you are at all leery of health standards at restaurants, then the fact that bread service area is within easy reach of the waiting area will disgust you. While we were waiting a couple actually walked up the bread table and after putting their hands all over the loaf of bread that was on the table, they helped themselves to the butter. 2 seconds later a waiter walked up to the bread table, cut bread from the same loaf and delivered it to his table. My only thought was I dearly pray that the guy who was waiting had washed his hands!!! I told a waiter what had happened and I was appalled at his response, which was \"it's ok! You can have some bread too!\" I was shocked! I said, but the guy put his hands all over the bread, you don't know if his hands were clean! The waiter seemed confused so I just sat down. This was how my experience at the restaurant began. Not a good beginning! We ordered the fried calamari; it was oily but still good. Then we ordered clam chowder and bean soup in bread bowls. The bread bowls were old and hard, the clam chowder was runny, not at all what you would expect on the Wharf. For dinner we ordered the prime rib and tiger prawns. The tiger prawns were over cooked. How could you over cook seafood if seafood is what you claim to be famous for? The prime rib was ok, the mashed potatoes were good but don't you dare ask for substitutions. I asked our waiter if I could sub zucchini for the creamed collards and he said no, the price of the zucchini is higher than the collards. Wait a minute, I pointed out to the waiter that on the menu, the side items are all the same price, $7. So how is it more expensive? His only excuse after that was to tell me the restaurant does not allow subs. Well, The Franciscan needs to get with the times because most all restaurants allow subs. And please find a better excuse for not allowing it than what that waiter told me. It was an insult. All in all, the view was fabulous; the table was good, giving you the feel that you have some privacy from other patrons. The hostess could use an attitude adjustment but again, I think they cater to tourists so they feel like they just don't care. Only reason I will ever eat here again is if we have a relative from out of town who absolutely insists on eating there. Otherwise we will stick to what we know is good.", "author": "amy m."}
