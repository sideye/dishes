The woman who took my order looked at me super cock-eyed in re the beer thing, and I recommend she just let me live my life.  \n\nWhen I got home and took the first bite of the fish, it tasted fantastic because I was starving and slightly buzzed. But a few bites later I realized that everything was just OK.  I don't think the fish is cod, which really gets me down on fish and chips.  Not sure what it was, but it was a thinner, softer fish than cod.  Thank God it wasn't Tilapia though - gross.\n\nThe fries were a 2 out of 5 and the slaw was HORRIBLE.  What even is that stuff? I can't even explain it.  It was brown, but not like the cabbage was rotton, it has some brown stuff all over it but somehow it had no flavor at all.  How do you cover cabbage in brown stuff and have it be totally flavorless?  It tasted like water and the cabbage was slightly bitter (which means it was old).  Tower - you have got to step the slaw game up.  Just start over completely.  I would seriously rather have pre-packaged slaw than that mess you are serving.  \n\nSpeaking of pre-packaged: the tartar sauce is that horrible sweet stuff that comes in the bottle - like the Safeway Select one.  I understand that this is a burger joint, but fish and chips is the only thing on the menu aside from burgers and it's like FEATURED on their menu, so one would think it's a specialty. \n\nTwo stars for the decent fish, the rest is in between blah and bad.", "author": "Emma H."}

While there are a lot of trendy and hyped up places in the city to try, it's nice coming to a place like this that is refreshingly quiet and relaxed.  It's fun to hit the town, but it's also just as fun to be lazy and grab a simple burger without a hassle!\n\nIn nearly every way, Tower Burger is the epitome of a \"no fuss, no muss\" kind of joint.  There's a wealth of seating, the staff is friendly, service is quick, and the menu is simple yet functional - a variety of burgers, salads, fish & chips, sides, and shakes (with Mitchell's ice cream!).  It's a perfect fit, and quite popular, with the neighborhood as well - a lot of families and regulars stop in to both dine in and grab some take out.\n\n-- TOWER BURGER with Bacon, Grilled Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms, and Cheese...$7.99\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tower-burger-san-francisco#VFjwj84V5Y7NXcGATV5xZw)\nI wouldn't rave about it like how others have, but it was a solid burger nonetheless.  The bun wasn't the best, but the patty had a nice char and was decently juicy.  It could have used a little more seasoning, but the mushrooms, bacon, and cheese helped.\n\n-- CHILI CHEESE FRIES...$6.99\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tower-burger-san-francisco#PkGHWyGnR95N4BCOcJhN6g)\nA bit of a miss, to be honest.  The fries themselves were more or less fine, and there was a decent amount of beans and meat, but the chili was really, really watery.  The taste was okay, but it was so thin that barely any of it stuck to the fries. \n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS overall, but I (generously) rounded up in spite of the chili cheese fries.  The regular fries and onion rings my friends ordered were just fine, so those would probably be the better route to go.  In any case, even though Tower Burger may not fare well when compared to gourmet spots in the city, they're as solid of a bet as you'll find among \"neighborhood burger joints\".

Burger was plain, even with a description of \"Mushroom burger * Smoothered in mushroom's\", yes a few landed on the patty but not enough to tickle the taste buds. Environ. is plain, with about as much charm.\n\nTower is producer of a 'good' burger, if compared to the giant chain joints, not so good compared to the joints like Barneys Burgers which is a 5 minute drive down the hill to Noe Valley. Goodness is relative, part of the general theory of relativity...of Burger Goodness.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/barneys-gourmet-hamburger-san-francisco-2\n\nInterestingly both Barneys Burger and Tower Burger tout using the premium beef from Niman Ranch. Its a little like thinking a Chevy will compete with a Ferrari, cos'  they both are rolling on Pirrelli's. Like a burger, a car can be judged by the stuff that goes on top that makes it special, not what it is riding on.\n\nYep, this burger joint is for the folks who utter things like: \"My car gets me from point A to point B\", this joint will get a burger seeker from point A to point B. Its an amazing thing to see the 4 & 5 star reviews, for this joint... I guess it helps when a joint like this is on the \"friends & family plan\"....", "author": "Matsuo U."}

We ordered a turkey burger with cheese and mushrooms, and a chicken cheese sandwich/burger. Yeah I know we didnt get actual burgers, but we still want to be health conscious. I cant attest to the niman ranch meet, but the chicken burger tasted great. just enough meat, and with everything on it, the vegis were very fresh, crunchy, and tasty. \n\nThe Turkey Burger tasted good but the shape seemed too perfect, as maybe it was frozen packaged????... At Least it tasted good. \n\nThe place was super fast with service, friendly and clean. You have to add fries, and we shared from one small order which we thought was plenty, washed down with water. It was about 10$/person, and i am completely full, satisfied though i still think each burger should come with fries when priced over 8$, and a self serve drink menu. \n\nDefinitely coming back to try a real burger next time i have a cheat day.", "author": "Benjamin B."}

But after last night's experience, I doubt I'll ever eat there again.  \n\nTower Burger has been a regular place to get good, simple grub.  Last night, I and some friends arrived at 8:40 pm.  The woman asked us if we wanted take out or were going to sit down.  I said we'd like to sit down.  She said \"We close at 9.\"  Usually that means the kitchen closes and you can't order food.  \n\nI asked if we sat down, did she mean we had to leave at 9 pm?  \"Yes.\"  Not believing what I heard, I asked again.  If we order food and sit down, we have to leave at 9 pm?  \"Yes, do you still want to order?\"  \"No, not with that attitude.\" I replied.\n\nI strongly recommend they put up a sign at 8:30 pm which says \"Take out orders only\" or post a sign that says that.  I've NEVER been to a restaurant that tells you have to leave when they close.  Granted, most diners don't linger that long, or asking them to leave 30 minutes after closing is OK,  but telling someone they have to leave when you close?  \n\nMy first review was in 2008 and I've been eating at Tower Burger ever since. I'm sorry to have to look for another burger place that's nearby, but that attitude kills any appetite I have for their food.", "author": "Scott S."}

The cheese melted around the patty and in my mouth! \n\nMy friend ordered the 4 prawns + 2 fish and chips - OMG, even better than the burger were the prawns, sinfully crunchy and buttery! So good, the fish was amazing and the fries were addicting. I didn't get a chance to try the coleslaw that came with this meal, but then again, I didn't want to waste my stomach volume w/ vegetables (even vegetables swimming in mayo). \n\nThe restaurant is very low key, you order at the counter and they bring it out to your table - come eat, have a good burger and be on your merry way.

Their patties are all made from Niman ranch beef and their milkshakes are made from Mitchell's Ice Cream.... needless to say their ingredients are all top notch.\n\nFOOD\n\nTower Burger - 3.5 out of 5 - Comes with grilled onion, bacon, mushroom and cheese.  Very good burger.  The bacon, of course, is good and adds a nice bacon kick, grilled onion and mushrooms add a nice earthiness.\n\nWestern Burger - 3.5 out of 5 - Home made BBQ sauce and aged chedder.  The BBQ is very good with a nice tang to it.  The cheddar is good balances well.\n\nOnion rings - 4 out of 5 - Very well done.  They have a nice crunch to them but aren't crunchy... a sign they are made fresh.  Can't go wrong here\n\nAMBIENCE\n\nTower Burger is kind of an in between burger place.  It isn't a dive and it is far from fancy.  The layout is pretty generic and almost feels like a chain restaurant... not a lot of personality.  It is however very clean and a nice place to eat\n\nOVERALL\n\nI've been here many times over the years and have always enjoyed my meals, but that is mostly because it is so close to where I (now used to) live.

Tower Burger came up on one of those lists, and since I was close by, I thought I'd check it out. Walked in on a Sunday night, the cashier was very friendly. I ordered a mushroom burger with a side of onion rings and also decided to take the Mitchell's chocolate shake for a spin. \n\nVerdict: Not bad. Meat is advertised as Niman Ranch. People in SF seem to be obsessed with that Niman Ranch beef. Anywho, the burger was nice an juicy. It was topped off with grilled mushrooms, cheddar cheese, red onions, pickle slices, tomato, green lettuce, and mayo on a sesame seed bun. Overall a fairly average burger. Onion rings are the frozen kind, but I was hungry and they were good. Mitchell's shake was creamy, although tasted small ice crystals in it, possibly a sign that the ice cream had accumulated some frost. But I'll note that they opted to keep the shake in the freezer while the food was prepared so it wouldn't melt. That's some good thinkin' right there. Service was fast, too, although they forgot the grilled onions on one of our burgers. \n\nThe place is pretty spacious, and actually nicely decorated. Plenty of street/metered parking right in front.

I asked for medium on my burger but it was more on the medium well side.  Well, no matter though, as it was juicy and flavorful.  Price wise, it is almost priced right at $7 to $8 per burger.  Fries are separate and so are drinks.\n\nIf I do come back, I hope to get the portabella or a chicken sandwich just as a change of pace.", "author": "Ben H L."}

I asked for a tower burger what should be their best burger... The meat was ok but no sauce in there just a wishy washy. I really hate to put mustard or pepper on burger but I had too this time. The fries were not that good, I think I should asked for the famous onion rings but the fires was really common and oily... The ambient is good but the food is not that much... Only a really the layer of chews came with my burger instead of a melting cheese that you expect of a cheeseburger... Even McDonald's has thicker layers of cheese.. But since I was starving I ate it all.. But I had the feeling that I paid too much for a common burger", "author": "Breno R."}

Hubby says his hamburger was \"good\".  The Neiman Ranch beef patty tasted like any other decent beef patty I've had.  \"Everything on it\" came with a tomato slice, lettuce, and pickle slices. Hubby's meal came with bean chili (I didn't like it) and onion rings.  I usually love onion rings, but not these.  \nIt's not any better than a burger you can grill yourself on the 4th of July.

I have been eating there for almost a year and since I found that place, I don't want to go to any other Burger places anymore. I've tried almost all of the main dishes there so far, including Burgers, salads, sandwiches and other side orders. Since the first time I tried Tower Burger, I've never been disappointed about anything there. The foods are always great and there are many choices. The burgers are tasty and organic while the salads are healthy and delicious. You can also customize your burgers like adding some stuff that you love. My favorite flavor is California burger, which has avocado with bean sprouts and I enjoy adding mushroom to it. The meat can be cooked as your demand but let's try it medium rare so that you can still feel the sweet juice melt inside and the smoky flavor outside. In addition, the service is amazing, friendly and fast. All you have to do is queuing to take order and then have a sit. Even though there're peak hours or weekends, you'll never have to wait too long. The chef is professional and the cooking area is open-up so that you can see the food is made carefully and sanitarily in front of you. Moreover, the price is quite suitable compared to other customized Burger places, which is about $25 in total for two burgers, fried and two drinks. Consequently, Tower Burger is such a lovely tasty affordable place for everyone to gather with friends or family!", "author": "Dieu Nga T."}

The burgers taste nice and juicy, the fries always come out piping hot, what's there to not like? While reading some of the reviews on how the attitude of the employees suck or how the employees are rushing to go home, I have to say I don't blame them. As a student in the highschool 2 blocks down from Tower Burger I know that there are always students rushing in and making a mess of the place or rushing the cooks so they can get back to class on time (hence the fast cooking part of most reviews). The employees would be tired after serving a bunch of highschool students everyday! Who wouldn't be?!

Tower Burger was first up.\n\nSince it was my first day on the job I didn't really want a huge meal complete with a massive load of fries, so I just got myself a bbq cheddar veggie burger and a diet coke.  I will say however that the fries looked pretty amazing!  I will have to grab some after work sometime.\n\nOn to the burgers.  Since I only eat halal meat, I kept away from the beef, as incredibly tempting as it was.  This place has a relatively large selection of veggie burgers, and the bbq cheddar one seemed to call my name, and it definitely hit the spot.  The veggie burger patty was cooked just right, and the huge helping of bbq sauce with a melted slice of cheddar was the perfect accompaniment.  On top of that was a huge piece of fresh cut leaf lettuce, onions, tomato, and pickles.  Add in unlimited refills on the diet coke, and I was a happy happy camper!\n\nOnly down side was that a veggie burger and a diet coke ran me something like 9 dollars... yikes!!  The fish and chips also looked mighty tasty and are on the short list for next time I swing by.  This place gets pretty busy with the local school kid crowd around lunch time so be aware of that.

That's really all you need to know.\n\nTower has been around for about 10 years for a reason: they take the food business seriously. You should go because they offer brown mustard, vinegar and hot sauce in addiiton to the standard four condiments. You should go because the restaurant is very clean. You should go because the food is prepared quickly and consistently. \n\nYou shouldn't if you're heavily interested in the decor; it's inoffensive but unremarkable. Mixed in with pictures of landscapes and animals are large prints based on food still-lifes. Add in Montana and Young jerseys and you have the visual. (Now would someone tell all the bandwagon Niners fans who abandoned the team 10 years ago to buy Patrick Willis jerseys? He is your best player.)\n\nHere, a burger cooked \"medium\" really means medium....not medium well! Thank you!!! It was pink in the middle and held together nicely. I ate a California burger (avocado, swiss, sprouts) plus bacon. I didn't really want the sprouts but the roughage can't hurt.

The Fish N Chips smelled really good but I opted for a California Burger...the beef is really good, but they can use some better higher quality buns, or let them toast a bit. Like someone else said about theirs, my bun fell apart too.Other than that really good burger. I was a little annoyed about the side of fries being 4 bucks (not included with burger) but you get a generous portion so that's good. Service could be dramatically increased. The lady who took our order was trying to rush us when clearly we were off to the side looking at the menu since it was our first time, and she didn't smile. She looked rather annoyed. Girl like, CALM DOWN. There is NO ONE behind us in line and it is not busy. That's the problem with most local small businesses, they think they don't have to give good customer service just because they aren't big and corporate smh.

Our food was up in less than 10 minutes and of course we took it to-go. The onion rings and french fries were very good, the burgers eh not so much.

This is a great burger because of the seasoning they use.  And you can buy the seasoning.  They put it on the burgers, they put it on the fries.  I put extra in a little cardboard container and press my fries into it to get more.  \n\nThe meat is big but thin and served with really juicy vegetables on a grilled bun.  I actually think the fact that the meat patty is a little thin allows the flavor from the rest of the toppings to really come through in each bite.  And that's not to say they skimp on the mean, there's plenty of if on each burger.  \n\nThey are often in the running for best fries in SF.  If they don't win they at least make the list.

But the people are nice, and if you want takeout, your dinner will be ready within minutes of your call. The burgers themselves aren't heavily seasoned, but the extra fixings on top are generous. Yes, fries (not bad) or rings (better) are extra, but you get a mammoth portion that could easily feed two burgered adults. \n\nAll told, Tower Burger serves a satisfying, hot dinner for two that should set you back well less than $20 -- even less if you do take out and drink your own beer at home.

But honestly, I've been to other burger joints who don't say that and their burgers tasted just the same.  I guess it's not really about the taste then, maybe more about the treatment of the cows.

I watched them take plates from the dining room back to the kitchen, take food off those plates, put that food on other plates and re-serve it to other customers. The cooks were using their hands for everything from touching the dirty handles of cooking equipment to wiping surfaces with dirty towels, then using those same bare, unsanitized hands to grab a handful of fries to plop alongside a hamburger on the next plate that came their way.

Their fries are just plain fried potatoes.  Tower Burger is your average burger joint.  I would give three stars for being average, but their meat is bitter.", "author": "Eric T."}

This is simply the best burger you'll find in the Twin Peaks area...don't even bother trying to prove me wrong. Tower is family owned an operated by an extremely friendly and polite group of people. Both the restaurant and kitchen are always clean as a whistle, along with their delicious food. They use high quality Niman Ranch beef in all of their burgers, so eat with complete confidence. Don't be cornered into the burger though...I've never been disappointed with anything from Tower (except the gilled cheese...but it's a grilled cheese). I still have friends that drive across SF just to get a burger from Tower...so take the journey. I promise you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Jerry A."}

Second batch worse than the first, the young man curtly informed me that this is what their fries are like, said 'we're busy so Ill just give you your money back\"  and slapped $1.50 on the table. I watched the grill cook pull the fry basket from the oil and without as much as a shake or oil drain moment, dump them dripping into the fry bin. Gross! Tower Burger owners, don't leave the shop in the kids hands!", "author": "Charlotte F."}

Burgers are great and it's a plus that they use Niman Ranch meat (if you are ordering a traditional beef burger). Fries good, onion rings could do better but that is because I like the kind that are similar to Johnny Rockets, i.e. have crumbs on them or some such thing. Anyway, I think the only drawback is the decor. Really needs a facelift. Not cozy, wouldn't want to hang out there, kinda cheap and stark. But, the food is good and it seems like a nice, family-run place.", "author": "Shelley F."}

My bf and I really like burgers and thought that we would try this mom and pop place. When we arrived we were greeted with a smile. I ordered the Paris burger- with brie cheese and sauteed mushrooms. My bf ordered the Western burger. We had the order our onion rings on the side, extra.  We also ordered a milkshake- Mitchell's ice cream! Alas, the milkshake was watery and came in a drinking glass. It was a small glass. The weird thing about it was that my bf and I decided to share the milkshake and the server who made the milkshake decided that he would do us a favor and split the milkshake in two drinking glasses. So, both our glasses were half full when they arrived.  When I say drinking glasses, I literally mean water glasses, so they were small glasses. You know how milkshakes come in the tall glasses with whip cream and a cherry on top, with another container full of it, so you get like two full glasses, not so here. For the price of the milkshake.... so not worth it. It was so watery, it just tasted like melted ice cream. They get an extra star for having Niman ranch meat, but that really didn't make the burger taste any better. The meat was juicy, but I felt like it needed to be seasoned just a little. My bf said his burger just tasted like BBQ sauce and bun. I guess the BBQ sauce was potent. The brie cheese on my burger was tasty, I have never had this type of cheese on my burger before and I think I will try it at home when I make burgers. The best part of about our meal was when a lady came in and asked for a garden burger (which I suppose is their veggie burger) and she asked if she can have bacon on it. Huh? We got a good laugh out of that one. The restaurant is spacious and roomy. The bench seats can use a good makeover- they have electrical tape covering the holes in the seats. I would come here again, but would not make a special trip out here.", "author": "carebear l."}

There was no chili burger, but you can get a regular cheeseburger with a bowl of pretty watery chili on the side.  But that's not the restaurant's fault!  The place is family-owned, and the people are nice.  Overall it was a good place, very popular, but I don't think I would go back for the price...for the 2 of us it was about $17...compared to \"in-n-out\", definitely prefer the latter.", "author": "judy j."}

Powerbars, instant oatmeal, Fresh Choice, blades of cut grass...  And so it was with Tower Burger.  I'd been here before and thought it was good but not great, a perfectly fine place to have a burger if there are no higher quality options readily available.  But on this particular occasion, with fine reddish dust covering my legs and most of my clothes, and ample amounts of lactic acid coursing through my veins, that $7 Niman Ranch Texas Burger with a small side of chili, along with an extra-cost plate of freshly cooked fries, rocked my world.  Best.  Meal.  Ever.  Like I said, on an average day, you can find a more interesting burger if you want to (for example, the Niman Ranch 1/3 pounders at my workplace's cafe are at last on par for quality, and cheaper and bigger), but you could certainly do worse than eating here.  I'd really give this restaurant 3.5 stars if I could.", "author": "Chuck W."}

The first time i went there, we were the only people there around 4pm.  The second time i went there i practically had to fight for a table around 6pm.  Unfortunately they don't seat you, you have order at the register and seat yourself.  The staff is not rude but not out going either,  but i think that is because they need to be tipped.  There is a tip jar near the register which most people might forget.  I guess it would help if they sat you at a table and waited on you like a regular restaurant.", "author": "Cherry L."}

My husband says the fish and chips are excellent (he's from Canada, and VERY picky about this dish), and I really enjoy the burgers. I usually get the mushroom and swiss burger - it's cooked right, tasty. I am old enough to remember what beef should taste like, and sadly, I am still unable to find a truly GREAT burger, but this will do in the meantime. The side salads, by the way, are incredibly tasty and fresh, and the milkshakes are totally delicious (i don't do sugar anymore, but the chocolate shakes are awesome). I bring people here regularly, and everyone finds the quality more than acceptable. It's not a fancy place, but at least the benches along the wall are reasonably comfy (i have back problems, and need the soft support they give.). I have also always had good service here. I really like the older lady and a young man who typically takes my order. They are kind, friendly, and efficient. Haven't run into the \"kids\" so can't comment on that. Oh, and the onion rings! Yep, they're awesome. I prefer having less on my plate - we're all so spoiled with huge portions. No wonder this country is having an obesity problem!", "author": "Sophia B."}

They are cooked to order, come quickly, and have a 100 score for cleanliness. I guess I have a beef (yuck yuck!) about other things. First, when my child came skipping  in one day (as 3 year olds are wont to do) she slipped on the hard, stone/tile wet floor that had just been cleaned. There was no sign warning us that it was wet and therefore dangerous. The people behind the counter lifted their eyes for a second, possibly because my daughter was wailing loudly, and then they quickly looked down. This is not the way to win customers. They could have shown a bit of concern, given the child a piece of ice, apologized for the wet floor. Second, I think the price of the burgers are a tad high. Everything is al la carte, so it doesn't include a salad, fries or slaw. A bit pricey. And finally, there should be a kid meal price, or a discount if all you ask for hot dog with not bun. Please don't charge full price! You want parents to come back, right? Make us feel good about the pricing and floors!", "author": "annie s."}
