Buttery, flaky, light - honestly a perfect croissant in my mind. Though a croissant is on the pricier side - $5.75 for a ham and cheese croissant, it's well worth it and I would gladly come back. If you have friends from out of town coming, definitely hit up Arsicault Bakery over Mr. Holmes Bakehouse or Craftsman and Wolves.\n\nI've been told the lines can get pretty crazy on Fridays and the weekend, but I can't confirm or deny this. I visited Arsicault at 7am on a Tuesday and there was no line at all. In fact, there was a ton of parking as well.", "author": "Austin W."}

The line is usually out the door but moves quickly as its a order-pay-exit type of place. The bakery is pretty small and doesn't offer much more than the delicious pastries. To me this is a sign of authenticity- they stick to what they've mastered. During the weekdays they close pretty early so if you can't make it by 2 then you've got to try to make it on the weekends, but the line will be even longer. \n\nMy personal favorites are the ham and cheese and chocolate almond.

(I haven't been to Europe yet, sorry). They're extremely airy, flaky, buttery...both light and rich at the same time. I think the classic croissant may have actually been my favorite, since it allows the quality of the croissant to really shine through and at a solid price.\n\nMy first impression was that this bakery is a little pricier than I would typically like, but after comparing the numbers it's actually pretty on par, so I'm not sure why I got that impression. Perhaps because the selection is smaller and simpler? It's not one of those places with shelves on shelves of options, it's a pretty low-key operation. What they do though, they do extremely well. I feel like I def need to go back here again in the future to appreciate it as much as I think it deserves. Also to try that Kouign Amann that everyone else is raving about!", "author": "Edward R."}

With its crispy outer crust and juicy inside, it is definitely a fantastic treat to have on any day. Whenever I come here, I see a lot of bikers outside, which proves that it is a must-stop place for them as well to fuel up! \n\nI've tried all of their bakeries, but Kouign Amann seems to be my top choice followed up by chocolate almond croissant!

Usually, we pick up a few while running errands for a next day breakfast and trust me, it still tastes very good the next day. When slightly warmed, the buttery flakiness is still remarkable! Can't really warm the powdered ones, but those are pretty good too.\n\nToday, I finally had the chance to eat it on the spot after finishing an early morning appointment. There wasn't much of a line (score!) and tables were available (double score!). Mom bought a couple different pastries and a round of house coffee for us to share. The coffee is nothing to write home about, but the pastries were just heavenly!\n\nMy chocolate croissant was slightly warm (probably still fresh from the ovens) making the chocolate nice and melty inside. The croissant layers were also buttery and flaky and just SOOO GOOD. The traditional butter croissant was equally amazing despite having no chocolate within. It was also amazing watching the kitchen churn out tray after tray of the traditional buttered croissants live - definitely no hate against the powdered almond croissant or powdered chocolate croissant but it's not quite as good in my opinion. On this meal, we rounded off our pastry choices with a morning bun. While not as big as other bakeries (looking at you Tartine), it still had the right flavors - sweet, cinnamony, a delicious subtle orange zest.\n\nSetup to eat at Arsicault is a little inconvenient though. The eating area is very small, located up the stairs from the pastry cases and there aren't any utensils or napkins there so make sure you bring all you need. Also, if you buy coffee, make sure you top off with cream before you leave the register - it's a pain to double back for it. It would definitely help to have a little bar cart up top with these items. Given this, I think I'll just keep with buying to to-go moving forward.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

My favorite was definitely the ham and cheese, but that's because I'm more of a savory treat kinda gal. The moment I bit into the croissant, you can just hear that crunch, taste the buttery goodness and feel the flaky layers.

There is a Farmers Market on Clement on a Sunday, might be fun to combine with the trip to the bakery, but be mindful of driving restrictions and even more difficult parking.\n2. Don't be afraid of the line - I was there around 10am on Sunday and line moved fast (I waited 5-7min) \n3. There is a cute eating space in the back.\n4.

If you love carbs you love bread love bakeries like I do, you can totally tell the differences and your tastebud will know how deliciousness these croissants were! Each one costs around $5 and the croissant is huge! Definitely fill you up to stop the hunger. We've tried 1 savory ham & cheese croissant and 1 chocolate croissant. I would prefer savory one more than sweet one. Knowing me as a bad sweet tooth person, I felt like chocolate croissant was way too heavy and a bit too much and greasy! But, still very delicious though! The savory one was perfect and good buttery taste, flaky and perfect ham&cheese in the middle. I likey it more!

I would also highly recommend the ham and cheese croissant if you're looking for something savory and the chocolate almond croissant if you're looking for something sweet. \n\nThere's not much of an atmosphere - only about 3 tiny tables in front of the kitchen up the stairs - so I wouldn't advise coming here for chit chat.

I was wrong.... the Arsicault Bakery REMINDED me of the ones I had in France but it was different. In a good way...  it was like America x France. The texture was flakey and caramelized. The filling was almondy and not overwhelming. Just great!!!! The top was crunchy with a dusting of powdered sugar. The almond croissants I had in France were flat and had the same type of filling. They also had sliced almonds on top with powdered sugar. The Arsicault ones didn't have sliced almonds but that is okay with me. I also tried their chocolate croissant and it was heavenly. \n\nI came here on a Thursday afternoon around noon and I didn't even wait in line!!!!!

I will say that the most accoladed item, the almond croissant, was not my favorite--unlike the typical almond croissant with some almond slivers sprinkled on top, the almond flavor comes entirely from a thick spread of sugary filling in the middle of the croissant, which was too sweet and heavy for me especially together with the powdered sugar glaze. Good for dessert perhaps, but not breakfast. The chocolate almond croissant is even heavier, not that I didn't down the sucker much later that day as a midnight post-concert snack. My favorite croissant was the chocolate croissant, and then probably the plain croissant. The plain croissant has the right amount of saltiness and sweetness from the pure butter flavor. Oftentimes I think what makes the best bakeries stand out is simply that their items are incredibly fresh, which is true for Arsicault. All the croissants have a solid crust on the outside and are at the same time unbelievably soft and fluffy on the inside, and even warm from coming right out of the oven. Which means if it's a chocolate croissant the chocolate is slightly melty and lovely. I'm salivating right now just remembering it. At ~$5 per croissant, they are expensive, compared to say Costco, but they are also big and divine.", "author": "Amy G."}

The ham and cheese is also good, but not quite as good as the other two.  (Did not try the chocolate this visit).  While Neighbor Bakehouse in Dogpatch is very delicious and delicious across a spectrum of pastries, I think my fav Bay Area croissant until Ariscault has been b. Patisserie.  I'd say Ariscault's plain croissant is better (by a smidge) and the almond croissants -- it really just depends on the mood.  Ariscault's is richer / more caramelly.  b. Patisserie's is... well balanced -- great balance of almond and croissant and less sweet (which is a good thing when you're not quite in the mood so such powerful sweetness!).\n\nAlas, with croissants, they are all much better eaten on the same day.

With a few of my favorites such as ham & cheese croissants, chocolate croissant, and the super filling almond chocolate croissant, Arsicault is my #1 recommendation for the buttery flaky croissants.  Despite sometimes having the line out the door and past a store or two, it moves fairly quickly and they are always pumping another fresh batch of pastries from the kitchen during your wait.  Not sure if they have the Valrhona chocolate cookie as a seasonal or random item but if its ever there, definitely grab one of those.

Since then, they've come up with some variations such as their chocolate almond croissant. But, I really do enjoy their chocolate and almond croissants separately as well. \n\nAlthough less popular, their kouign-amann is just as fantastic as their croissants. It's actually a lot flatter than ones I've tried in the past, but just as decadent as their other pastries. I hear the ham and cheese is one to try for my next visit.

I'm sure one can guess the other bakeries I have visited. After finally tasting Arsicault's, I will never ever stray well unless I find myself in Paris. \n\nI have made three visits and I have never been disappointed. Hmmm, maybe I should say just once when they didn't have ham and cheese croissant available. But that's just simply supply and demand issues, not a quality issue! \n\nMy first visit was oh so memorable. The first bite into the pain au chocolat, I could immediately hear the delicate crunch of all those well laminated layers of dough and butter quickly followed by the lava flow of melted chocolate. The chocolate jolted my sugar levels and made happy dances in my brain. I was in love and made the \"mmm mmm sound\" and held the croissant in front of my face to admire it's beauty. Who smiles at their croissants? I do! \n\nMy second visit was more hit and run as I knew what I wanted and was not going to deviate except that ham and cheese croissant. We all know how that turned out lol!  \n\nThe third visit, I visited when it was opening. I was walking down Arguello and I don't know how far I was but I began to smell butter and fresh baked pastries! If you didn't know where it was just follow your nose! Then I bought pain au chocolat, kouign amann, and ham and cheese. I basically went crazy! Again why did i waste my time eating a certain kouign amann somewhere else! I was foolish oh so foolish! It was amazing first to last bite, the sweetness and the crunch, perfection on all levels.  \n\nI have luckily never had to wait in a long line so just time your visit right and you will not be disappointed.", "author": "April L."}

When I showed the menu to a Frenchman, he was pleasantly surprised to see Kouign Amann: a circular pastry glazed with caramel.

There aren't a lot of items of the menu, but each one is so good!! The plain croissant for $3.50 is well worth the price. It is made at just the right softness and creamy flavor.

I wanted an almond croissant, but since they were out of those and it would be another 10-15 minute wait, I asked for a simple chocolate croissant instead.\n\nI brought my croissant to the Palace of Fine Arts to eat, and boy am I glad I was eating it over grass, as it was so incredibly flaky that I made a small mess as I was eating it. But I understand the hype...it was the softest and flakiest croissant I've ever had the pleasure of trying!

Just above the Presidio on Arguello Boulevard between Clement and Cornwall Street, lies a small rustic bakery that has an intimate yet bustling feel. Do not be surprised if the lines go out the door. Even on a rainy day like this, people will suffer in the cold just for a bite of that tasty goodness.\n\nThe Bakery has a small seating area outside of the door, and another seating area at the rear of the establishment. Both are very nice spots to take a load off, but understand that with the popularity of the place, seats are scarce, and good things come to those who wait for a seat to open up. The prices are steeper, and would be considered a 'treat' place, rather than a 'bread' place.\n\nThe croissants have so many layers and easily come apart to show an intricate web of layers that contribute to the fluffiness of the bread.\n\nThe Kouign Amman (i suppose you could pronounce it like Queen A-mahn) is not something I've run across often before, but after today, I am a huge fan. The texture is soft with a sweet thin shell around to keep in the moisture. \n\nTypically when I travel to the Pacific I either do a layover via SFO or LAX - but after this time, I think I'll be purposefully making my long layovers in the foggy mists of San Francisco to do a little pick-up shopping here.", "author": "Glenn M."}

The croissants were excellent right away and even better when I saved one to lightly heat up at home in the toaster oven. The smell of butter was so intoxicating. \n\nThe chocolate one ($4.75) has gotten better? Or maybe it's because I heat them up now? The ham and cheese ($5.75) is a great all in one breakfast item. I like the compact, puck shape of the Kouign Amann ($4.25). All of the varieties are fun, but my favorite might be the plain croissant - although there's nothing really plain about it.   \n\nCroissants from the best bakeries around (Arsicault, Tartine, B Patisserie, Neighbor...) are all beautiful and unique in their own way.

It was nice and flaky, but it needed more butter. And flavor. The roommate who loves croissants said he actually liked Costco's croissants better. We discussed if it could be because we ate them in the evening, but the texture of the croissant was still great. The flavor just wasn't there. If anything the texture suffers from time, right? From my understanding, the flavor should stay the same. I'm not a huge chocolate person, so the roomie ate that one.

I loved this version, and the ham and cheese were perfect with the flaky croissant. The chocolate almond was my least favorite since it was too chocolate-y for me, and too sweet. They don't skimp on the filling though, and I'd recommend this for chocolate lovers, and to at least try it once. Their almond croissant was also delicious, and had the perfect filling to croissant ratio. The ham & cheese and almond croissants are must orders!\n\nI wish they had a menu posted outside so you can start planning your order before you enter the bakery, but that's a minor detail. It's definitely worth the wait to experience these amazing croissants, and I will be back! They do have some seating inside so that you can enjoy your baked goods there.

By the time I left around 7:15 the line had doubled. It was pretty quick even though there was only one cashier. The service was good.\n\nI wish they listed the prices on the board, but I actually expected my order to be more expensive (2 plain crossiants, an almond crossiant, a chocolate almond crossiant, and a kougin amann = $22.50)!\n\nSurprisingly, I liked the plain crossiant over the almond one. I love a good almond crossiant, but I have to give that award to Le Panier in Seattle. But anyways. The almond crossiants filling wasn't as almond-y as I like, nor was it as sweet. But if you like it then it's great!\n\nThe butter crossiant was just so wonderful. My favorite part was how light it felt to eat. Though the outside seemed hard, it was an easy break into fluffy layers of buttery love. Reminds me of big dogs, they seem tough on the outside, but they're just big fluffers. Only thing is you'll want to eat these crossiants as soon as they come into your hands. \n\nJust the experience of trying one of the best crossiants in the country also made this a worthwhile trip. It's a small bakery, but it's a must vis\n \nAlso, just tried the kougin amaan and chocolate almond crossiant. The crossiant has a very strong chocolate presence if you like that, and again, the almond is sort of subtle but a nice texture to contrast the crossiant. The QUEEN AMAAN wow I think I have a favorite pastry. Since it's different than a crossiant, I'll say it's about on the same level in quality. It's like a thick palmier, which is better than a regular palmier snack because you get to bite into the fluffy interior of the pastry. So so good.

Arsicault absolutely deserves the outsized assertion by Bon Appetit last Fall crowning it as the best new bakery in America.

Wait times aren't crazy. Fresh batches pop regularly...\n\nDat croissant, tho! The butter croissant is incredibly flaky on the outside and unbelievably buttery and tender on the inside. The sheen a tad darker than perfectly golden. But, it's the chocolate croissant with two bars of chocolate and disintegrating flakiness on touch, that's likely the best version I've had in years.

I've been here twice now - once on a weekday morning where we had to wait in line and were limited to 2 pastries, and once on a Wednesday around 11 am where there was no line and there didn't seem to be a pastry limit. I've tried the plain, almond, ham and cheese, chocolate almond, kouign amann, and morning bun. \n\nKouign amann - think flaky, slightly crispy, glaze coated croissant with the flavor of palmier cookies. So simple and delicious!\n\nCroissants - flaky, buttery, light and decadent cwoissants!!

The Pain du chocolat was nicely done; overfilled with chocolate with a nice dark chocolate\nThe other two were just ok for me.  I'm not a huge pastry fan, but my sis who is even stated she wasn't that impressed.  \n\nThe biggest disappoint was the coffee selection.  They had one selection: COFFEE.

They are, in short, probably the best in SF, but they come at too steep a price,  close to $6 each. The croissants are a treat, but take a stand against exorbitant prices for a fairly common baked good that could be bought more cheaply about anywhere else outside of SF. Enough is enough! Save your money. Eat breakfast at home.\n\nIf Arsicault really wanted to make a difference, it would sell its goods so that all people could afford them, rich, poor, and the middle class, the last two vanishing in SF as rapidly as a reasonably priced roll. At these escalating prices, no wonder the people who can only afford to eat here are the ones who are taking away the cheapest staple, bread, from the poor's reach!\n\nSo, better yet, instead of spending your money on a $6 croissant, save your money for what you really need or donate to a food bank.

Nobody who knows me would be surprised by my dedication to sweets. Bon Appetit magazine named it the best new bakery in 2016, and it's been on my radar for a while. I was expecting to wait at least an hour, but maybe I'm just super late to the game, because there were only a few people in line at 8:30. \n\nThey sell a small selection of pastries, the most famous being the chocolate almond croissant. It was absolutely divine, and there must be something wrong with your tastebuds if you disagree. My only complaint is that it's really large (like the size of my face) and rich, so I felt uncomfortably full after finishing it. I would've been more than satisfied splitting one with someone, and I don't usually like to share my sweets. I tried a bite of C's Kouign Amann and was not impressed. It's nowhere near B. Patisserie's level. \n\nOn the way out, we ran into some friends who are regulars here, and they convinced me to get a chocolate chip cookie. The guy at the counter gave me an amused look when I walked back in, like, back for more already? I'm so glad I did, because the cookie was worth every calorie. And it holds up well if you save it for later. I also got a regular croissant to-go for a friend, and he said, \"it's better than Tartine and Bouchon.\" High praise.\n\nI'd definitely come back to try the morning bun and other pastries, especially now that I know there's no need to sacrifice sleep on a weekend morning.", "author": "Karen S."}

We ran out of everything, sorry you drove for 25 minutes and wrestled for parking, would you like short bread cookies in a box? No damnit.

We decided on the plain croissant, chocolate almond croissant, kouign amann, and morning bun.  \n\nI know every review has said this but these croissants are just on another level.  The flakiness of it is something I have never experienced before and it was still warm and the butter was not as overpowering as I thought it would be.  I did not feel the butter was seeping through my pores after I ate it. You will be distracted on getting the flavored ones but you must, must try the plain!!\n\nThe chocolate almond croissant was very heavy, I would suggest sharing that with 2 other people at least.  It was very rich but tasty.  I could only eat so much of that, it is not something I would crave.  \n\nThe kouign amannwas good, reminded me of those palimer butterfly cookies.  The caramelization was very nice and it was flaky.  B Paterisse is still my favorite for kouign amanns though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-04", "description": "Overview: Arsicault is a small bakery in north San Francisco founded just a few years ago that was recognized by Bon Appetit magazine for being the best new bakery in the USA. It specializes in just a few baked goods such as croissants and kouign amann's (pronounced \"queen a-mahn\") located in Laurel Heights. It charges moderately high prices about in line with Tartine/Vive Le Tarte/Chantal Guillon which I feel is reasonable given the level of care that goes into each pastry. I've seen pastry junkies lined up, waiting for nearly an hour to get their pastry fix and this bakery should be ashamed for what it's done to the community. \n\nThe Establishment: This is a small place close to the intersection of California and Arugello and thus is relatively easy to get to using the \"1\" and \"33\" bus systems. There are a few tables for people to eat and drink their coffees but don't expect to bring a crowd here. Most people will buy and leave which is fine because this is a quiet, beautiful neighborhood that most will enjoy walking through with a croissant. \n\nThe Food: I heard that after you get your first bite, people will sit at their desks at work the next day and fantasize about the kouign amann's crunchy caramelized exterior and light fluffy interior with its hundreds of delicate layers. Sometimes these people might just yell at their coworkers telling them \"YOU'RE NOT A KOUIGN AMANN\" and then walk out of their office salivating a bit too much. I'd bet that some even write Yelp reviews to try to relive eating their last chocolate almond croissant with its rich, sweet, almond and chocolate interior and light flaky, buttery croissant exterior. Maybe some people come here at the recommendation of their wife, buy 3 pastries for her, but then give in and eat all of them in the bathroom at work. \n\nConclusions: Dangerously good almond croissants and kouign amanns.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Otherwise, I'd give the food 4.5 - 5 stars. \n\nThe almond croissants are so delicious that it has become my favorite coffee place for the last couple of years (after my children's school drop offs nearby).\n\nHowever, there are a couple of employees that can use an improvement to adjust their attitude and there is one employee in particular who constantly overcharges me. There is a tall brunette/African American girl with light curly brown hair who never smiles no matter what and she has overcharged me several times if not every time.\n\nAt first couple of times, I thought it was a mistake because they're generally so busy. But then again it happens more frequently than not. Almost every time this girl rings me up, she over charges me anywhere from $2 to $18 over the actual price. Be sure to double check the total before you pay her. She either does this to add to her tips or she is really bad with punching numbers into the computer calculator. \n\nAlthough the overall sum is not worth pursuing a formal complaint, it is pretty annoying when this happens to you time and again. I'm wondering how many other times I did not notice it.\n\nI began to notice this when once she asked me for $37 for 4 croissants. I asked her if the prices had gone up with a nice friendly smile. She frowned at me and said that's the total. I had to be more firm and say that the total did not make sense before she would review the accounting (as I seriously doubted that the croissants were over $9 there!!). She unwillingly counted the items and corrected the total - not once saying she was sorry.\n\nThe next time it happened again. I was getting 2 croissants and one morning bun, she asked me for $27.50. It seemed a bit high and so I asked if her account was for 2 croissants and 1 morning bun, she then said she thought there were 2 more croissants. I politely told her no and she had to correct it. I still did not suspect anything. \n\nAnother time, she overcharged me by $4  or something like that, but I didn't notice until I was in the car. I let that one go and considered it a tip for the staff.\n\nAnother time I asked for several croissants and she charged me $38.25 when it should have been $36.00. I didn't notice this small difference but as I was leaving the bakery, another girl from the bakery ran to me and said I was overcharged. I sighed and knew why. It was the same African American girl again who had charged me wrong. This time I had already paid them so I told the nice employee who ran after me it was ok and there was no need for a refund.\n\nI've gone through all my credit card charges and see so many transactions that seem to be inflated. I'm pretty upset and will be bringing this to the attention of the owner. \n\nWhat's interesting is that this only happens when this particular girl rings me up. It also only happens as an increase to my bill and never as a decrease in the price. Another words I'm always overcharged by her and never undercharged as would probably be the case for someone with poor math skills.\n\nI feel quite ripped off. Like I said, I've been coming here for the last two years and I've come here pretty frequently. Cash register's honesty and accuracy is a must and this place certainly lacks it. \n\nThe croissants may however be worth the risk so you may want to double check your bill before you automatically pay it.", "author": "M D."}

You truly hear the crunch when you bite into it but it's doughy and moist inside. The combination of crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside has always been my expectations of an excellent croissant. Alas, I have found it! \n\nThis place is definitely worth the wait. I got lucky that it was Friday morning and people were still at work so the wait wasn't that bad. But even if I had to wait, it's certainly worth it. \n\nTry their almond chocolate croissant and regular almond. It's so worth it!", "author": "Jackie O."}

Always whenever we pass by this bakery there are queues out the door.  I suppose too it doesn't help that they have limited hours and close by 2:30 daily which signifies that they have a limited quantity of goods.\n\nLuckily I visited today (a weekday) and while it was busy there were zero queues.  It's a tiny storefront with a tiny passageway and counter.  However, there's seating on a mezzanine level as well as a few tables outside. \n\nThere are not too many selections, and I decided to try the famous almond croissants and kouign amann.  Prices surely are steep:  $4.25 for the kouign amann and $5.25 for an almond croissant. Small coffee runs an additional $2.50.  \n\nHave to admit that I was a bit disappointed in the almond croissant.  Firstly it has powdered sugar sprinkled all over which is not what I'm used to.  Then it was not as flaky as I truly expected it to be.  I'm accustomed to the almond croissants in France which are flaky which each and every single bite.  Just a small touch and it will flake everywhere.  This one tasted a bit cake like in the middle with just the ends being flaky.  And the almond filling was overly sweet.  Haven't yet tried the kouign amann, but their coffee (reg.) is fantastic honestly.\n\nAs for service I found the middle aged woman serving to be not friendly, but the guy at the till was.  One thing I don't care for is if you charge your purchase there is an option to tip.  Not sure why you'd tip for takeaway.\n\nAnyhow, I'd probably go back and try the plain croissants and other items.  Although it's a great bakery if one is longing for authentic French pastry and can't fly to France I do not agree in all honesty with Bon Appetit naming it \"Bakery of the year\" in 2016.", "author": "Luisa T."}

Besides being pretty belated, they have so many more reviews now than when I first came here.  Not to say that this would be less helpful (I hope), but now, it might just sound like yet another review singing the praises of Bon Appetit's \"Best New Bakery in America for 2016\"!  Well, not that it wouldn't be true...\n\nLike so many others, I visited Arsicault after they received their heady distinction.  Truth be told though, I had actually heard about them a few days before the article came out while on a date.  Talk about good/bad timing - it backed up her taste in croissants, but it also meant having to endure crowds to see for myself.  What's more, the publicity also affected their range of offerings, as they had to pare their menu down to keep up with all of the demand (at least, based on what I saw and what she recommended I try).\n\n**NOTE: Given how some of the initial craze has waned a bit, I'm not sure if they still have the same restrictions on orders as when I came here.  At the time, you could only get up to four items total per person with a maximum of two of the same type., but I heard it might have changed?\n\nPhoto 1 (clockwise, from top left) - Ham & Cheese Croissant, Morning Bun, Croissant, Chocolate Almond Croissant\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arsicault-bakery-san-francisco?select=VkYsPEM8o0ySQ-ZKXKI8QQ)\n\nPhoto 2 (clockwise, from top left) - Raisin Kouign Amann, Almond Croissant, Chocolate Almond Croissant, Chocolate Croissant\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arsicault-bakery-san-francisco?select=kV7M5Zj-6SjqyLLXI-X18g)\n\n-- CROISSANT\nWhile this was definitely the best one I've ever had, I should note I'm not exactly a croissant connoisseur (Costco's is my go-to).  Still, I thought it was pretty tasty and had a nice flakiness to it.  Sadly though, I didn't find it as buttery as other Yelpers have and the outer layers felt a little dry to me.  Perhaps this was just a bad batch?\n\n-- ALMOND CROISSANT\nDespite the lack of luck I've had with almond croissants in the past (perhaps because they were all from Asian bakeries?), this one was terrific!  The texture throughout was moist and flaky, but the best part was the almond flavor, which was quite intense!  Yum!\n\n-- CHOCOLATE CROISSANT\nThough it isn't super unique, this was great!  It wasn't as moist as the almond croissant, but I thought the batter was flavorful and I really liked the chocolate.  In fact, I wish it had been stronger; the croissant was so large and airy, I felt like all of the chocolate notes got a little lost.\n\n-- CHOCOLATE ALMOND CROISSANT\nOf all of the croissants, this was easily the best one!  The almond and chocolate paired really well together, both in terms of flavor as well as in helping to keep the croissant moist.  You could argue the two also made this a little sweet, but I'd definitely get this decadent and delicious treat again!\n\n-- HAM & CHEESE CROISSANT\nI might not have gotten this one if not for Cherylynn N.'s recommendation, but I'm glad I did!  Although it wasn't as cheesy as I would've hoped, I liked how the salty, savoriness of the cheese and ham made for a huge contrast against the much sweeter chocolate and almond varieties.\n\n-- MORNING BUN\nThe thing to try here may be the croissant, but this was actually my favorite thing of all!  While I can't say how they compare to Tartine's, these were awesome!  It was slightly sugary, but I LOVED how the cinnamon, sugar, and orange/citrus essence complemented each other so well.  Plus, it was so crispy!  Definitely wish I could've ordered more of these!\n\n-- RAISIN KOUIGN AMANN\nHonestly, this completely missed the mark for me (I could've got another Morning Bun!).  In short, it was just lackluster all around - generic flavors, dry texture, and not very sweet.  I did like the sort of glaze that was on it, but meh.  I'm still kind of curious if their regular Kouign Amann would be better\n\nAll in all, while I certainly enjoyed most of the things I tried, I'm not sure I'd want in some of those long lines again.  Standing in line for 30 minutes at 7:00am on a Friday was one thing, but waiting three times as long at 8:00am on a Sunday?  Pass.

Has that crispy, flaky, sweet glaze goodness on the outside, but still soft and buttery inside.\n\n\nMorning bun: Another I think is better for people that really like things heavy and sweet. There is also a tinge of an orange flavor which I didn't like. I would personally pass but could see why other's wouldn't.\n\n\nScone: This was good. Not amazing.

Early on a Sunday morning before the 8am opening, the line is already 24 deep and grows by the second. The menu consists of 7 items: croissant, chocolate, almond, chocolate almond, ham & cheese croissant, morning bun, and kouign amann.\nLet me tell you, the early morning rise and the wait is worth it. The croissants are buttery because your fingertips are lightly coated after your first touch. The croissants are delicate because with any pressure applied, the dough flakes are appearing with every bite or hold.\nThe plain croissant is as expected which is a bit hearty and so so delicate, the chocolate shows itself as it appears from the ends waiting for your bite, and finally the ham and cheese has just a hint of melted cheese creeping out. All are perfect.\nA definite GO TO SPOT!", "author": "David H."}

I loved the almond and ham & cheese ones, the chocolate one was almost too rich, but hey, it's chocolate. The morning bun was the secret star here: I loved the hint of orange, it was not quite as rich as the other croissants. \n\nNow to the more practical details: Be there early. I was in line at 7.53 on a Saturday morning and once they opened at 8, I was in and out in 10 minutes. But I hear they sell out quickly on the weekends.

My third attempt and I think I finally mastered the timing. There was no line when I walked up on Tuesday right before noon. But, luckily I got there when I did because a flood of folks came in immediately after and no croissants were left. I even managed to get myself an outdoor table to myself, for like two seconds.\n\n$5.50 ham and cheese croissant | Good lawrd! Almost six bucks for a croissant. To my surprise, the croissant was warm. I ate it on an uncomfortable wooden chair that my ass swallowed while I stared at the Arguello traffic. And the locksmith that was sitting in his van with the door open like some weird croissant pedophile. The cheese was gooey and the deli ham was okay, but I gave it one tug and all the insides came out with my teeth. Most of my croissant shattered into the bag and I had to tip the bag of crumbs into my mouth like I was eating hot Cheetos. I saw a man dump the crumbs from his bag onto the ground, but that just seemed fucking stupid. That's like $1 worth of crumbs!\n\n$5 almond chocolate croissant | The Valrhona and almond croissant is a beast to be sure. It was so ridiculously rich and chocked full of thick chocolate filling and frangipane. The chocolate filling: you know when you're eating chocolate chip cookies and you hit one of the melted chip pockets? It's like that, but an entire schmear. It was almost too sweet, even with the Valrhona. Definitely eat half and keep the other half in the cupboard to eat the next morning with coffee, hidden from your spouse.  \n\nHonestly, I prefer Tartine's croissants. More honestly, I prefer Manresa Bread or the croissants from a relatively unknown bakery nearby Tartine. I like my croissant to keep its shape, a little crusty on the bottom so that it holds all of that delicious almond paste. These croissants are good, but it gets to the point where you're just eating buttery ass pieces of crepe paper.", "author": "Illyanna M."}

I expected more of a taste however, the ham and cheese flavors didn't kick like I thought they would. The almond croissant had a similar texture yet more dense and firm but in a good way. Both these pastries are very filling, I'll doubt you can comfortably eat two.

We didnt wait long to order but we waited a little while for a new batch of the almond croissants to finish baking. It's a small menu made up mostly of croissants. They have kouign ammans & morning buns as well. Coffee and a few other drink selections are also available. I had an almond croissant and a ham & cheese croissant. I had to go with one sweet and one savory.\n\nThe ham & cheese croissant was SO GOOD. How?? How is it better than all the ham & cheese croissants I have had. I have had hundreds! The croissant was so light and flaky. The ham was a little salty but also had a sweetness to it. The white cheese was light and creamy. It was so good together. I really really thought it was the best ham & cheese croissant I've ever eaten. Period.\n\nThe almond croissant. HOLY MOLY... This creation deserves a Nobel Peace Prize because it could probably end wars. It is the ultimate peacekeeper... It is so good. It's not shaped like your regular croissant. The flakiness of course is key but the caramelized bottom of the croissant and the crunch you get when you bite into it is heavenly. I have never used heavenly in describing anything, to my knowledge. Hea-ven-ly... The almond paste filling is outstanding. Oh how I wish I could have one every other morning.

I hate to admit it, but this place to me met all the accolades/hype. This is the best croissant I've ever had. First off the shop is very basic and simple, pastries being sold as they come out with a small selection of coffee/drinks nothing fancy. There is a small space for seating but I'd say its better to take out. \nFor my visit I ordered the plain butter croissant, the chocolate almond, and morning bun. The morning bun was ok, sweet and flakey with a hint of citrus nothing special. The chocolate almond was really tasty, I haven't really seen that combination very often but it was well done. Flaky croissant with a good balance of chocolate and almond with ample powdered sugar on top, I would get it again. \nThe best thing and my favorite was the simple butter croissant. It was just soooo perfectly done. The outer part was flaky and baked just right so that it wasn't too crisp or tasting burnt. The inside was even better, just a hint of chewiness with the the flavor of butter standing out. The pictures I took don't do it justice. By far the best croissant I've ever had, its a good thing I don't live nearby because I would be here a lot. Had I known, I would have probably just got 3 of the butter croissants but my curiosity got the better of me to try some of their other options.

This is the hands down the best croissants that have ever touched my tongue. \n\nI stopped in on a Wednesday around 11am, and the almond + ham/cheese croissants were sold out and still in the oven. We waited about 10-15 mins for them to come out (YEEES SO FRESH) and ordered an almond one to hold us down. As soon as I took the first bite of my almond croissant, omg. Heavenly. Crispy and flaky on the outside, so buttery and soft on the inside. I had heard about how good their croissants were, but I literally cannot describe it in words. It's a bit pricey ($5+ per croissant) but def my go-to place now for a quick breakfast before class.", "author": "Shana N."}

After reading through some of the yelp reviews I thought this place would be a definite hit but I was sadly disappointed. Parking was easy...the line was minimal which was a shock based off of the pics. We did visit during the week around 9 AM so I'm sure the crowds died down by then. The seating here is very limited...I'd say they have room to seat about 8 people inside and another 4/6 outside. I opted for a plain croissant and a ham and cheese. The plain croissant was nothing to rave home about. The plain croissant had a good buttery / flaky taste but was not served warm nor did I see a microwave or toaster to do so had I asked. The ham and cheese croissant was cold, had a weird slice of ham in there and some fancy cheese that did not help the flavor. Stick with Swiss, please for the love of God not all things in San Fran need some extra, weird, touch. The price point is also a bit much ... $11 for 2 croissants??? I can get better quality at my local donut shop for about half the price. A nice touch was the friendly staff. Overall, would not come back here nor would I recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Amanda D."}

At 20 minutes after its opening, there was already a line stretching for more than a block out the door. Also, someone I know went there at noon on a weekday and they were already sold out, so make sure you get there in the morning, because their pastries don't always last until the listed closing time.  \n-Keep in mind that there is a limit to the number of pastries per person, so choose what you want carefully.\n\nBecause there's so much turnover in pastries, new trays of each type are constantly being brought out of the ovens, so it's likely that they'll still be warm by the time you buy them. \n\nArsicault is known for its croissants, which are lovingly crafted and extremely flaky. The ham and cheese in the ham and cheese croissant are good quality and fresh as well\n\nThe pastries are amazing.

Pure simplicity at its finest. \n\nWifey works just a block away from this unassuming bakery and she couldn't help but notice the constantly long lines every morning and every day she goes to work. A few Sundays ago, while I was at work, she texted me a couple of photos that she was in line that took about an hour wait before she got to the front. She purchased 6 different types of croissants and would leave two for me. When I got home that day, I opened the box that contained two ginormous chocolate croissants that had been sitting on the counter for a while. I didn't reheat 'em or pop 'em in the microwave or anything, and I just ate 'em cold. \n\nI got a bite of chocolate goodness with a delicious and flaky crunchiness that immediately burst with umami goodness. Mind you, this was cold and I was wondering what it would taste like if they were fresh and hot. Fast-forward to a few Fridays later when I dropped her off work and I decided to brave the long line. At that time, it was still early in the morning and the dreaded long wait only lasted less than half an hour. They had since changed the policy that limited 4 selections (2 orders for each kind of croissant) per person to accommodate everyone. I texted the Wifey to ask what she wanted and she told me to get the Ham & Cheese and Chocolate Croissant. \n\nOff tangent: I don't mind waiting in line, but what irritates me is people who don't give personal space while waiting in line. There was an Asian lady (early to mid 50's) behind me and she was basically millimeters breathing behind my neck. Every time I stepped forward or stepped aside as the line moved, she was right on my tail like a shadow following my every move. I tried to give her a hint, but it just went over her head and her constant invasion of my personal space was driving me insane. I didn't want to be an asshole so I purposely shuffled inch by inch way from her to no avail. Even as I was paying at the register she was right behind me like dog poo stuck to my sneakers. \n\nA message to these types of people: STAHP IT!!!\n\nOK, back to the scene...\n\nAside from what the Wifey wanted, I also got the Almond Croissant. As I was walking to Wifey's work, I couldn't wait to munch on those things and I started with the Ham & Cheese. It stopped me right on my tracks as you can feel and taste each layer upon layer of buttery goodness and flaky crispness on each bite. Each of my senses were heightened from the visual appeal, sensual sensation, aromatic scent, oculauditory resonance of each flake crunching and the delectable delight of scrumptious essence dancing in my orifice. Or, the definition in Pidgen meaning - Broke Da Mouth!\n\nThen I got to the Almond Croissant and the same thing that happened mentioned above in the savory sense occurred in the sweeter version. Although it was sweet in the sense, it wasn't uberly too sweet. And the filling inside was just an orgasmic deliciousness of oozing creaminess of joy. \n\nDamn, and there's also a Chocolate Almond Croissant? \n\nOh. Mah.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-01", "description": "If you're reading this, you probably already know that Arsicault was named the best bakery in America by Bon Appetit. The predictable end result is a good old fashioned queue. I arrived at 9:45 am on a Friday and ended up with a 45 minute wait. I brought a book. It was a great time.\n\nSo first, a diatribe on lines. My first experience at a foodie queue was by way of 'cue, Franklin BBQ. The Austin legend has become eponymous with the interminable wait time, with people starting to line up by 7 am for an 11 am opening. I've seen lines grow, from Franklin BBQ to Halal Guys in New York (drunk foodies unite) to Au Cheval in Chicago (best burger in America according to Bon Appetit and Food Network) to San Francisco's own Swan Oyster Depot (Anthony Bourdain preferred spot to die eating), and the consensus is always the same. The place is extraordinarily good at what it makes.\n\nSo embrace the line. It's part of the holistic dining experience.\n\nHere's the deal with Arsicault. The popularity was unexpected, and economies of scale, very similar to 'cueing perfect brisket, is difficult. But Arsicault has handled it quite well. The wait is partially because it takes some time to bake those goods. As a result, Arsicault intervals its demand. The bad news is that if you don't queue up early enough, Arsicault will probably run out of whatever you wanted. The good news is whatever they do have just came out of the oven, piping hot and wholly delicious.\n\nI was there to try to croissant, and luckily those were still in stock, along with the chocolate and ham and cheese version. Everything else was sold out. As in the previous paragraph, it came freshly baked out of the oven, which only improved that first bite.\n\nMy barometer for the perfect croissant in America is Tartine, itself not an unaccustomed stranger to lines. Tartine's croissant is a heavyweight, the Mike Tyson of croissants. It's brash and bold, with a gradiose size and a firm, crispy, slightly charred exterior that is equal parts inviting and imposing. To carry the analogy, Arsicault's croissant is Sugar Ray, a welterweight champion. It's lightier, butterier, more open to your invitation. But come at the king, you best be ready for a mean flavor punch.\n\nOr, instead of writing all this, I could have just turned you on to the Bon Appetit review in question, which is basically a perfect summation (http://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-bakeries-2016). So here it is: a croissant that's simultaneously so preposterously flaky it leaves you covered in crumbs, so impossibly tender and buttery on the inside that it tastes like brioche, and so deeply golden that the underside is nearly caramelized.\n\nTell me you're not drooling for a dance in the ring with that.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

They make the best croissants, hands down! It's so flakey with the right amount of crunch when you bite into it and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I got the chocolate almond croissant, and I LOVED it. I love chocolate croissants, so trying their chocolate almond was such a treat to my taste buds. They use valrhona chocolate, which is so rich and smooth already, and as a plus, there was a lot of chocolate in it. Mmm. I got to try some of my friend's ham & cheese croissant and that was a delight as well. It looked like they were constantly making their pastries, so when you get them, they should still be nice & warm (at least ours were!). \n\nSure it was $5.50 for one, but it is so worth it. It's a small shop, and they only have a few seating spots. Also, expect flakes to be everywhere when eat their awesome croissants. My hair and clothes stood no chance against the flakes. I would absolutely come here again and try their other pastries as well :)", "author": "Katherine W."}

So the Valrhona chocolate makes it so much better. Another winner. $5.50.\n\nKouign Amann = Sticky & flaky. One of my favorite pastries and they did it well. $4.00.\n\nPrices = moderate. $18.00 for 4 pastries.

I don't regret it at all because today is the day that I ate the best croissant I've ever had. And if you know me, you know that I am highly food motivated (kind of like my corgi).\n\nWe got to Arsicault at 6:40am before opening time and were 4th in line. Even when it opened, there were only ~20 people and the line was moving quickly during the first few minutes. Since there was a 4 item limit (and 2 of each type), I ordered 2 almond croissants, 1 chocolate croissant, and 1 chocolate almond croissant. I ate an almond croissant right after I bought it and it was warm and flaky. \n\nIn an attempt to not over-indulge, I gave away the other 3. The recipients of the gifts were happy with their croissants as well.\n\nMaybe it was because we got there early but I was very pleasantly surprised by how reasonable the line was.", "author": "Yi Z."}

My dad and I waited about 30 minutes outside their little shop on a weekday after the morning rush. \n\nThe actual owner of Ariscault helped us; he was very friendly and down to earth. He would even go outside every once in a while to talk to the people waiting in line. The interior of the bakery is quite small and crowded. There is a little sitting area up a few stairs with 3-4 tables for people to enjoy their pastries and a few tables outside as well. \n\nWe were able to buy 4 different pastries between the two of us (2 per person) and ended up getting their regular croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and lastly the chocolate almond croissant! We wanted to try their Kougin Amann but they were already sold out and focused just on croissants for the rest of the day. \n\nMy favorite of the 4 was the almond croissant! I loved the filling and how flaky all the croissants were. The chocolate croissant was very tasty as well! I think they were good but I probably wouldn't go again until the hype dies down. \n\nIf you're a croissant lover you should definitely check out this little bakery!", "author": "Jessica N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-15", "description": "Last Friday, Eater SF wrote: \"EVERYBODY PANIC\". \n\nAnd, they did.\n\nArsicault Bakery, a TINY, unassuming bakery that can barely fit 8 people has been named the BEST bakery in the America by the prestigious Bon App\u00e9tit magazine. The article hasn't been released yet but there's been a SF media sh*tstorm and everyone is trying to get there before the wait becomes insane.\n\nWell, it's already insane. \n\nOn Saturday, I arrived 40 minutes before their opening at 8 am and was about 25th in line: http://bit.ly/2aWispT. By 8 am, there were about 80-90 people in line. One guy arrived at 6 am (!!!) and several neighbors came by saying there's never ever been a line until two days ago. My fault for waiting over a year to finally pay a visit. \n\nEverybody wanted to see what the hype was about from curious food lovers...to furbabies (the smell of baked goods wafting through the SF fog is intoxicatingly good)...to those who've just did the walk of shame. Nothing says, replenishment quite like buttery pastries after a drunken night of reverse cowgirl!\n\nParking was ridiculously hard even in the am because of almost daily street cleaning so depending on what time you go, allocate 15-30 minutes for parking. \"Easier\" street parking can be found in the residential area of Laurel Heights (around Euclid, Palm, Commonwealth streets). It's a 2 hour limit though. \n\nArsicault Bakery has about a dozen different pastries ($3.50 - $5.50): Croissants (butter, chocolate, ham & cheese, almond, almond chocolate), Kouign Amann (plain or raisin), Morning Bun, Scones, and Chocolate Chip cookie. CC's accepted. \n\nThey bake in small batches so by the time it's your turn to order, and you don't see what you want displayed on the small shelf...you're SOL. You can't wait for the next batch. They ran out of butter croissants by 8:30 am and I cried a little inside. Ok, I threw a silent hissy fit and begrudgingly ordered what 6 items I could (as of yesterday, the limit is now 4 items per a customer). \n\nSo if you want the best pick....come at least an hour before opening. \n\nIf you see the Ham & Cheese Croissant ($5.50) staring back at you on the shelf, GET IT: http://bit.ly/2bhKZbF! \n\nThe Ham & Cheese Croissant is the best I've had: http://bit.ly/2bhPPop. As you sink your teeth into the croissant, you can feel all the delicately crispy layers come crumbling down in your mouth. The interior is soft and uber buttery without being greasy. The salty ham and melty cheese heightened this messy deliciousness: http://bit.ly/2bhPPop. The crunchy edges were the best part with the nutty, caramelized cheese. Mmmmm... \n\nIn comparison to other top bakeries in SF, the croissant was better than Tartine's and less oily than Neighbor Bakehouse's.\n\nI wasn't fond of the other two items I bought or maybe it was better before the hype?\n\nThe Almond Croissant ($5): http://bit.ly/2bjW8F3 was not my cup of tea. There were lots of crisp, buttery layers and a thick layer of almond filling but it was very rich and sweet: http://bit.ly/2bsQaTq. I love caramelization and the flavor it gives but some parts were a tad burnt and left a slight bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nI also ordered the Kouign Amann ($4): http://bit.ly/2byh6oa. As others have said, this is more like a palmier with a thick caramelized sugar crust. I don't have a sweet tooth so it was way too sweet for me to enjoy. I prefer the light, flaky, intensely buttery layers of b. patisserie's Kouign Amann. \n\nThere's limited seating in their tiny mezzanine area above the counter area and several tables outside. It may be awkward to eat while others are hovering and salivating over your pastries though. \n\nI'm happy for a small business owner to receive such national acclaim and it's obvious that he's taken aback. I can't imagine how daunting it's for him to keep up with the demand in such a tiny bakery. Arsicault Bakery has big shoes to fill so some kind suggestions: \n\n*Try to manage customer expectations. They should have an employee periodically go outside to inform customers what's left. It sucks for those who come all the way to SF and wait up to 3 hours in line and leave empty handed. \n\n*The female employee (older lady with blonde wavy hair) at the cash register could learn some basic customer service skills. No hello, no thank you, no you're welcome...nothing. When I was waiting to pay, she just stood there staring at me. Apparently, you're supposed to tell her what you ordered so she can ring you up. Please communicate this to customers and be kind to those who have waited hours for a taste of the BEST bakery in America.\n\nInquiring minds want to know: Was it worth the wait?\n\nI'm glad I was able to try Arsicault Bakery once but it's NOT worth a 1 or 2 hour wait, and certainly not worth a 3 hour wait.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

And at Arsicault I've found one of the best (if not the best) croissant outside of France. So fluffy, flaky and buttery... So yum! Just as it's supposed to be! \nPlus they use high quality (Valrhona) chocolate in their 'Pain au Chocolat'. As for the Kouign Aman, oh my... it's plain, no fuss, no filling, but simply so decadent!\nSuper friendly owner who has a long and genuine baking heritage. Check the old family picture/mural upstairs on the mezzanine. I can't praise enough this awesome cosy bake shop - and I swear I don't work for them. It's definitely a little gem tucked away in the quiet Inner Richmond. \nLeave Tartine to the wannabe-hipsters and come down to Arsicault for the real French stuff.", "author": "Sylvie W."}

Of course when the outer layers are so crisp, they're too fragile to travel well.  Maybe this is why croissants here lack the flake.\n Finally I get by A. when it's open, but all that remained were almond croissants and scones.  I went for the almond and I can't rave.  The p\u00e2te was excellent, crunchy and flaky and chewy.  The filling, however, was too sweet and too abundant.  I expected something akin to a schmear of marzipan.  A gently sweet almond flavor compliments the delicious pastry.  This was more like a thick sugary syrup coated something?? That was at odds with its flaky coccoon. I was surprised, as I've not had anything so sweet here or in France. \nMust get by for a plain croissant.  Judging by the outside of the almond, they're probably very good.", "author": "Rob B."}

I placed an order for two regular croissants and asked to wait for an almond croissant. Lucky me - once I placed my order, one of the employees walked down with a tray of freshly baked almond croissants. I took my baked goods and was on my way.\n\nAlmond croissant: This may be severely biased because I got one fresh out of the oven (it was still warm!!), but it was on par with my favorite almond croissant I got in Paris. The pastry was flaky on the outside, but not too flaky where you loose half of it just biting into the croissant. The almond filling was just the right amount of sweetness and the dough had the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness.\n\nRegular croissant: Similar to the almond croissant, it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was very airy, not one of those dense croissants. It also wasn't overpowering with the butter. \n\nWhile, almond croissants are my go-to anyways, I think that should be your order if you only get one thing from here.

This croissant is also very buttery and flaky but I thought the flavor of Valrhona chocolate kind of overpowers the almond paste in this croissant. It is on the sweeter side as you got the sweetness from both the chocolate and almond paste. \n\nIf you like lightly or moderately sweet with a nutty flavor, definitely go for the almond croissant.

My friend who was so kind to introduce me to Ariscault's goodies said she heard a woman walk by and say, \"the only difference between these croissants and the ones in Paris is that these are better.\" \n\nAll croissants are a beautiful balance of butter, air, and body. The flavor is spot on and the texture is a beautiful balance of buttery goodness, tenderness, chewiness, and flavor. \n- Ham and cheese sold out the quickest, and are best eaten fresh. You may have to wait for the next batch to come out. \n- Pan au chocolat is a pillow of chocolatey perfection.\n- Almond croissant is sweet and a little on the heavy side as always.\n- Chocolate almond croissant--I always wondered pre-Arsicault why no one ever combined the almond and the chocolate. Now I know why--it's SO overwhelming. Don't get me wrong--it was absolutely delicious and one of the best indulgences I'd had in a while. It is quite sweet and very heavy. About halfway through I had enough. If I could do it again, this would be the one to share :). \n\nORDERING: Be ready to go when you're at the front of the line. If they are out of your particular croissant and you can bear to wait for the next batch (do it! There are few things more beautiful than a fresh, warm croissant), they will write your name on a slip and call it out when your buttery baby arrives. BEWARE the 3 croissant/person limit. Oh the pain of decisions!!\n\nSERVICE: polite and quick. This in my experience is great for a place that has only three people manning an espresso machine, one register, and impatient lines out the door. Somehow my almond croissant was lost in the shuffle, but I was able to get one quickly once I asked. \n\nAMBIANCE: Small entryway where people line up far out the door for croissants. Limited seating up a half flight of stairs on a platform with a balcony for you to people watch :). As the priority here is serving people, be prepared to bus your own dishes and don't be surprised to find some crumbs on your table.", "author": "Helen W."}

If I lived closer, I would be so screwed just eating croissants every day. This was the absolute best croissant I have ever had.\n\nSo we came on Christmas Eve morning, and I was frantically running around Clement looking for the long queue that usually will instantly indicate where the bakery is. Except it wasn't there, so I panicked and thought that they must be closed for the holiday. And then... I saw the door with like 4 people standing outside. A Christmas miracle. Plus, they didn't have a limit on the number of items you could buy! Too bad we were going out of town the next day, otherwise, I would have bought 'em all up. But I'm still confused about what's up. Did they revoke the limit because it's winter time and less people are willing to hang out in a line outside for baked goods? Or was it because a lot of people would be out of town for the holidays? I guess I'll have to go back in a week to solve this mystery.\n\nThe goods:\n++ Chocolate croissant ($4.50)\nVery good, but why get just chocolate, when you can get chocolate AND almond?\n\n+++ Chocolate almond croissant ($5.50)\nThis thing was loaded with chocolate and almond. Tons of delicious almond paste that was more gooey than usual almond pastes. And it's valhrona chocolate, so it has a really nice flavor. The croissant itself was beautifully slightly caramelized on the outside creating a flaky and sweet taste.\n\n+++ Ham ad cheese croissant ($5.50)\nLike this is usually something I would never buy, but I'm so glad I did. Eating a savory croissant before stuffing my face in tons of sugary croissants was a good idea. The cheese was pungent and so perfect all warm right after you buy it. Perfect flaky crust with a soft interior.\n\n+ Kouign amman ($4.00)\nThe one I was most excited for and most disappointed by. A little too sweet and buttery for me (is that even possible?!).

Thanks to the super efficient staff at the counter, plus the constant flow of fresh pastries from the oven, the line has wound its way out the door and down the block and STILL only taken 10 minutes. This is a huge improvement from waiting in an ever growing windy line outside of Tartine Bakery in the Mission (for the same price range of pastries $4-5/pastry).\n\nThe value here is that EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious because it is so flaky. Therefore, even with a limited menu - croissants: plain, chocolate, almond, chocolate almond, ham and cheese, and kouign amann, you can't go wrong. The pastry chefs in France say that a croissant \"goes bad\" after 30-minutes. The layers of air baked into it will have collapsed, and it'll be too dense. These croissants have comparable levels of flakiness, and takes hours to \"deflate,\" and is still amazing tasting even the day after.  \n\nDefinitely worth the wait (even though the wait times are well managed at this point), and I've been back every other weekend to get my carb-y croissant-y fix.", "author": "Kathy T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-31", "description": "Newly opened in 2015 and with a perfect 5-star rating on Yelp, Arsicault has been on the radar. Not to mention, it's the first search result in SF for almond croissants, which is one of the boo's favorites (a very important consideration!).\n\nI know that my 4-star rating is not going to make the slightest dent in Arsicault's stellar 5-star streak, but I'm writing a review anyways to share my thoughts and mark my Yelp territory. \n\nArsicault appears as though it has always been a part of the Inner Richmond neighborhood and exudes a local-business vibe--a simple storefront with a plain green awning, a limited but solid pastry selection, and general basicness. There were two staff members working, one handling pastries and one handling monies, and there was a small but steady influx of customers, most of whom appeared to be regulars grabbing their morning breakfast and coffee (quite different from the hustle and bustle of the notoriously busy Mr. Holmes). \n\nI walked in planning only on getting the famous almond croissant, but it looked and smelled like bakery heaven, and I ended up leaving with a box of three pastries. Whoops... at least it makes my Yelp review look more legit and comprehensive.\n\nArsicault has serious skillz--what stands out the most is the composition of rich buttery pastry layers. With air interspersed between the multitude of flakey layers, you get a pastry with the perfect balance of decadent flavor and fluffy lightness. What I dislike is that everything is glazed to a heavily caramelized finish, making everything overwhelmingly sweet. It tastes good for than first few bites, but I would like to appreciate more complex patisserie art than just sugar. \n\n(++) Almond croissant: The darker hue is perhaps due to a prolonged baking time and/or the caramelized coating, and indeed it has a tad of charred smokiness. Because of the endless layers, I want to describe this as literally mille feuille, with a crispy flakey exterior making it \"a croissant you can hear\", quoting the owner's words from a newspaper article. There's no doubt it's among the best, but I think it could use more almonds and a more custardy filling (it seemed mostly marzipan) which are the main reasons B Patisserie still holds first place for almond croissants in my opinion.\n\n(+) Kouign amann: Richer and sweeter than the almond croissant, making it more like a dessert. The concentric circular layers of caramelized pastry made this similar to a cinnamon roll minus the cinnamon. \n\n(++) Raspberry paille: I was intrigued since I'd never seen this pastry before, so I asked the staff which one he would recommend. He explained that the raspberry is more tart and traditional, while the blueberry is sweeter--bonus points for friendly and knowledgeable staff, and extra bonus points that he looked and sounded French, which made the French bakery experience that much more authentic ^^ The pastry itself reminded me very much of palmier cookies and is well complemented by the raspberry, though it seemed to be regular raspberry jam and not some house-made raspberry compote (what has SF done to my expectations...) Overall it made a tasty dessert but, like everything else, a bit too sweet for my tastes--if I could customize it to 30% sweet like milk tea, it'd be perfect.\n\nPastries are ~$4-4.50 each, which lies at the price equilibrium point for pastries in SF.

I ordered the plain croissant, the pain au chocolat and the chocolate almond croissant.  \n\nI started with the plain croissant.  It was dark caramel color and a good size with good height.  I tore off one end and proceed to take my first bite.  It was light, very light, very airy and very buttery.  It's extremely flaky so be prepared for bits and pieces to fly everywhere.  Yes, that is a good thing!  For my own preference I thought the croissant was too light and wished it was a tiny bit more chewy on the inside.  \n\nNext came the chocolate almond croissant.  Oh My Freakin' Goodness!  THIS is amazing.  Buttery, sugary, almond-y and everything that will contribute to a food-gasm in your mouth!  The exterior was crisp and crunchy, the interior slightly chewy.  The various components were balanced.  This was perfection.\n\nIs this better than B. Patisserie?  Tartine?  Yes.  I think both of those other bakeries are great but are better at making desserts and bread, respectively.  Arsicault takes my vote for their croissants.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I went on a Wednesday morning at 9:30am and there were still an abundant of people. Honestly, do people not work?\n\nLike any well crafted bakery, they love to impose restrictions (*being sarcastic here guys*). Arsicault limits 4 pastries and only 2 of one kind. Arsicault is actually pretty tiny in size and also limited in their selection. There's about 6 to choose from so the 2 of a kind isn't too harsh. One cashier and two helpers with packing the pastries. With such a tiny space, it's really hard to make the line any more efficient except by adding another cashier. \n\nI ordered two almond croissants, one ham & cheese croissant, and the chocolate almond croissant. If you only had one choice, choose the almond croissant. BY FAR THEIR BEST ONE! \n\nEver since a coworker brought in an almond croissant, I couldn't stop raving about the flakiness and sweetness of it. It's really no wonder they were rated the Nation's Best Bakery by Bon Apetit.

There is so much carmelization that the underside is harden crispness, this provides excellent contrast to the soft and warm almond paste. The flakiness of the croissant is legendary, many seconds pass with the sound of crackling of the croissant. \n- Chocolate croissant $4.50 - Simply excellent. Countless light layers of buttery goodness is meet with airy and holey pockets of dough. Their chocolate is high quality and they do not skimp on the amount of chocolate either. Best eaten hot with the chocolate melting. \n- Plain croissant $3.50 - A beautiful croissant with seemingly thousands of buttery layers and a moist and holey interior. \n- Almond chocolate croissant $5.50 - Can a good thing be too much? Possibly, the chocolate is impeccably decadent, the almond paste is fabulously rich and the combination of the two can a little overload.

The plain was maybe missing a trace of salt for me (but this could have easily been due to the freezing and defrosting process too). \n\nFor one reviewer who said the chocolate croissant is much more filling than in Paris (I agree by the way) my sense is this is due to the sheer size of these croissants.

And I say this after standing in line for over an hour, in the cold, while I was sick. \n\nThe wait is horribly long and slow.  They only have one POS so it takes forever.  Also they are constantly running out so you need to wait for the next batch.  They limited it to 3 per person, so we got the almond, chocolate, and regular.  Sure the 3 per person limits how many people can buy, but it also means pretty much every single person buys 3 each!  When we finally did get up to the register, we got a chocolate straight out of the oven.  I've never had croissants so fresh, and it was pretty amazing.  The flaky, buttery dough with the melty chocolate.  Worth the wait.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

(Late October 2016)\nThe lines have calmed down a bit, but the prime time to visit is within an hour of opening on a weekday. I walked in 15 minutes after opening today and the line was only 5 people long. They've also hired more people and  implemented a faster ordering system to speed things along. Still the best croissants I've ever had in my life. We just got back from Paris, where we attempted to find a better croissant (using multiple editorial sources as our guide) and Arsicault blows every croissant in Paris away. \n\nItem minimum is 5 per person now, so if you want more than that, bring a friend.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nMy wife and I live 2 blocks away and have come to Arsicault twice a week for many months, ever since we heard about its opening on the Richmond District blog (our neighborhood blog). Their croissants are the best I've had in my life... hands down. We love the owner and we have loved sitting outside on their little tables with our dog, feeding him leftover bits of croissant flakes and ham and cheese. But sadly, this is no longer a neighborhood spot and our days of casually picking up croissants and coffee on the way to work are over. \n\nIf you are considering coming here after mid-August 2016 (when a superlative article was published in a national magazine), expect a one hour minimum wait, regardless of time of day. An early morning start won't help you much and now there's a 3 item minimum. \n\nAs much as this inconveniences me, I am so happy for the owner, who is such a hard worker and brilliant baker. I'm glad he didn't have to wait long for his much deserved glory and I hope he figures out a way to bring his craft to more people.", "author": "Paul L."}

That's a big title to hold and I had high expectations! The place looks humble and the owner is a sweet guy who takes his time with every customer, handing credit cards back with both hands (very poilte!) and never rushing anyone to take their order. \n\nI waited half an hour and ordered the max number of pastries (4 pastries per person). The kouign amann didn't match up to B. Patisserie. The almond croissant was delicious (la marais has a very dense one as well, but I prefer Arsicault's). The chocolate croissant was average. However, the ONE baked good that sticks out in my mind was the chocolate almond croissant! Get it when it's fresh out of the oven. It's ah-mazing. The croissant is flaky and the almond paste is perfectly sweet with a bitter chocolate taste. I highly recommend getting that if you are to only get 1. \n\nI'm happy to see a mom and pop shop bakery doing so well! It's worth making a trip out to the Inner Richmond to try this young French baker's take on croissants.", "author": "Joanna S."}

Was SO sad because the best croissant that I had was at Arsicault and it was the first one.  Unbelievable though - almost better than what I thought a croissant could be. \n\nI think part of perfection is the fact that the croissants come just from the oven - there is very high turnover. As a result, it has a big edge over places which might be fantastic but the croissants have been sitting around for a while.  The outside is so flakey, buttery but not in an oily way.

Granted they were a bit squished by the time I got to Sausalito to eat them. I wasn't wowed. They're classic croissants but no special combinations like at Neighbor Bakehouse or Vive Le Tarte. Based on my late munching I'd rate them about the same as the defrost n bake ones from TJ. The almond croissants were noticeably smaller than everything else and also a little overbaked/burnt brown. I'd be willing to go back to try and get a plain croissant to eat immediately to better judge though honestly I can't imagine they'd be so great to be worth any wait (no, I don't wait in line at Tartine either).

Or so I'm told.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nOut of the misfortune of having broken my leg and needing to trek out to this part of town to see my UCSF doctor, came the good fortune of discovering and stopping by Arsicault before it blew up and became The Next Big Thing here in SF. Weekday mornings, at least the times I went, were notably lacking in the long lines that now seem to dominate the reviews on here. Blame the food zines for ruining a good thing!\n\nNow, with that said, my experience seems to have been a bit more lackluster than everyone else's, and I suspect that's largely due to not having ordered the right things, as the plain croissant, chocolate almond croissant, morning bun, and poppy seed rolls we got all fell just a little short. The plain croissant was nothing outstanding; the chocolate almond croissant was, to me, a strange combo, and one I would have enjoyed much more separately; the morning bun was quite citrusy, for those who are into that; and the poppy seed roll was, like the croissant, just okay.\n\nI'd certainly like to give them another go, and get more of the croissants next time around.

I enjoyed the classic croissant and loved the flavors in the chocolate almond croissant, but found the other pastries to be too heavy, dense, and cloyingly sweet for my liking. I'd love to try the Ham & Cheese croissant and Pain au chocolat, since those would be less sugary and lighter in texture. \n\nCroissant (4.5/5) - Light, buttery, good texture and not heavy or greasy. A very solid French croissant.\nChocolate Almond Croissant (4/5) - Very heavy and rich, filled with heaping mounds of almond paste and oozing with bittersweet chocolate. The texture inside is a cookie-like density inside which may or may not be your thing, with a caramelized bottom forming a harder shell. The slight bitterness of the chocolate balances it out better than the almond croissant but still too sweet.\nAlmond Croissant (3.5/5) - Flaky on the outside, filled with oozing soft and buttery almond paste, caked with almond paste and dusted with sugar. Intense marzipan almond flavor and overwhelmingly sweet for my taste.\nMorning bun (2/5) - Sweet, densely packed but yet dry, lacking a soft chewy interior expected of morning buns.

Not Mission, the other French bakery Tartine has created such a commotion over the years, which I go, if I really really miss good French baked good and could stand the average wait of 30 minutes. \n\nOwner is French. I called 1 hour before close, there were some goods left they told me, which was awesome. In France, everything is gone by 12. They open at 7 for a reason. Baker is also the owner. He tells us the story about this place, the history, the needs for a 3 am shift baker, and what he wanted to do in the future. A bread oven. Yes I said, must have baguette. I tell him that my place is also two hours south of Paris. Owner was born in Paris and raised south of it. For the first time in a while I cannot go to my home this summer as work beckons. \n\nKathy is right. She sent photo of her insanely happy blonde 4 year old eating a piece of au pain chocolate. She beat me to it. Darn it! Both she and I are die hard Francophiles and clearly this bakery bonds us further.\n\nParting thoughts. Most of the croissants baked in America are undercooked.  They don't have the golden flakey crust like you'd see in France. Or here. The almond croissant here is my favorite. It is perfect like you'd see in my burgundy town or any number of non-chained bakeries scattered around French country side. Tarts are dry and not moist. Not here. This place has amazing tarts. When do they have plum tarts? I want a box of that! \n\nThis place requires some refinement and expansion at 2 and half months old.

If you are looking for something savory, the ham and cheese fits the bill. It's definite more of a pastry than a sandwich, but the thin piece of ham and the melted cheese just enhanced the flavor of the buttery, flakey dough. The almond was incredible in its own way. One bite and I felt like I was in heaven. \n\nThe kouign amann was another story. It was not hot like the two croissants and although it was good, it would not be something I would come back for.

I arrived at 7:15 to a crowd of roughly 25 people already in line, braving the harsh 55 degree San Francisco weather in hopes of getting the best croissants in the US. I waited in line for 35 minutes, my reward was an almond croissant and a fresh out of the oven original croissant.\n\nThe question you're probably asking yourself is, \"are 2-4 pastries really worth 35 minutes of my time?\" My answer to that question is, it depends on what you get. \n\nThe Almond Croissant ($4.50) was AMAZING. Hands down one of the best almond croissants I've ever had. It was crispy and flaky on the outside, raining croissant bits on my car upholstery with each bite. The inside was soft and buttery, and filled with enough almond creme to strike fear into the hearts of diabetics everywhere. It was gone in a minute, tops. I would order this again in an instant. The quality of their croissants still really shines through in the almond croissant, even with the presence of the almond creme and powdered sugar.\n\nI also got the Original Croissant ($4.00). I was excited; Everyone was ordering them, so each batch was coming directly from the oven. The croissant came straight off the baking sheet and into my pastry bag. On the outside, the croissant was crispy, buttery, and flaky as well. However, the middle of the croissant, which should've been fluffy and buttery like the almond croissant, had a distinctly doughy consistency that wasn't very pleasant. The croissant seemed like it could've used a couple more minutes in the oven, or possibly a couple of minutes to rest.\n\nOverall, I'd say both were quite good, but I'd probably give Ariscault some time to cope with the massive increase in customers, as it seems they're cutting a couple of corners with the croissants right now to meet the increased demand.

You most likely won't be able to sit and eat there because the space is small and seating is very limited.\n\nBased on the quality of the pastries alone, I would give this place at least 4 stars but because of the annoying crowd, high prices, and limited seating, this is one of the last bakeries I would choose when I want to get pastry and I can't give it more than 2 stars.", "author": "keith s."}

I ordered the Ham and Cheese for myself and the Almond for a coworker. The Ham and Cheese was a bit cold and not as crispy and delicious as I expected, still good! but not amazing. My coworker never showed up to work so I shared the almond one with a friend.  This was the croissant that was freshly baked, OMG! Crispy on the outside, flaky buttery and almond paste slathered in the middle. We were in HEAVEN! Now that was one of the best I've had! \nFollow me on instagram: @salivate_sf", "author": "Karen T."}

There are better things to do than wait for warm bread. It's kind of sad that ppl wait an hour for this stuff. \n\nI was in&out in 25 mins and tried the almond croissant, kouign amann and morning bun. At 705am on a Tuesday the line quickly quadrupled in 10 mins. There's a 4 item limit and max 2 per item :/. There were only 7 items for sale. \n\nThe almond croissant just melts in your mouth. The unique buttery, almondy, powder sugary and crispy combination was Aaamazing. It was average size so I could easily eat two, however I saved one for my kids to try. I live in the Sunset 20 mins away but by the time I got home the croissant was hardened and the kids didn't want it. So I had to finish it. The croissant is not as good when it's not warm. The kouign was buttery and sweet but I didn't eat it until an hour later, so again not as good when not warm. I don't have a review for the morning bun since I gave it to my wife.

There is a short line out the door & I can see why: hole-in-the-wall, local, rave reviews.  The croissants are signature so I order one of each: almond, chocolate, chocolate-almond, and ham & cheese; I order one separate chocolate croissant for myself.  These are at a moderate price point and well worth your money. Flaky, warm, buttery goodness.  Larger in size that it can hold you over for a couple of hours, maybe even through lunch.

So ok, I'll just order 2 chocolate croissants and 2 almond croissants.\n\nI had my first bite of the almond croissant and absolutely fell in love so I decided you know what, I don't mind standing back in line (another 20 mins) to try those chocolate almonds! \n\nWhen I get here the second time, I see that it was right when the 2 new batches of chocolate almonds came out, so I was super stoked at the perfect timing. However the person I ordered from said it would be another 20-30 mins wait for that and I can't get any of the ones that came out. So I asked her are you sure? I don't think those are claimed yet, and she says \"I need to help the next person\" and proceeded to basically push me aside without asking if I wanted something else. Like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! I waited in line for an additional 20 mins to take your bitchass attitude? No bitch. You would think, oh that is probably because there's a waitlist, but no, right after I leave I see her put that batch out for people to buy, so they weren't the backed up orders, which is why I'm so pissed at them right, which sucks cos they have the best croissants. \n\nHopefully, they'll figure out communication better within the staff in terms of what's available and what the wait times are, and a more efficient way to get through customers, because right now they can't handle the hype.", "author": "Joanne Y."}

Ham & cheese (I love how flaky the outer shell is and once you take a bite, you can feel the croissant stretch as you pull away while the savory ham and cheese soaks in your mouth) \n\n2. Kouign Amann (this is my favorite sweet pastry. The torched sugar made a fine glass-like glaze on the pastry. Once bitten, its crispy and softness enters your mouth) \n\n3. Regular croissant (must try if you're a first timer. Experience the originality and chewiness. Beware, the flakes will leave trails on your cheeks)\n\n4. Almond croissant (the toasted almond and powder sugar leaves a memorable taste. Not to mention the center! You must reach the center!)\n\n5. Morning bun (words cannot explain how this bun tastes. It's chewy, flaky, crunchy, and soft all at the same time! You have to take a huge bite to receive all of this.)\n\n6. Chocolate croissant (great for chocolate lovers! Make sure to get it fresh, which it is always, to get the kick of deliciousness on your taste bud.)\n\n7. Chocolate almond croissant (this is the least of my favorites because there is too much attention grabbing flavors in one pastry. Both chocolate and almond tastes great separately, but once combined, which tastes the best?)", "author": "Stephanie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "So everything is relative.  Does Arsicault have the best croissants in the city?  Yes, especially considering the competition in San Francisco, which I think is overrated (I'm talking about YOU, Tartine).  I've had better, but none of them are in this country, so I can't speak to the \"best in America\" moniker.  \n\nSome have mentioned the $4-5 price tag per pastry.  Again, considering I'd have to jump on a plane with my passport to get another croissant this good I'm willing to pay extra for that. An extra dollar or two compared to a $500+ round trip plane ticket (depending on the season)?  Sign me up. HOWEVER, considering I paid $35 for a bunch of $4-$5 pastries I DO expect a pastry box, not a paper handle bag filled with pastries in their individual pastry bags, per-person limit or no.  Sometimes you want to impress, you know?  And a bag 'o pastries doesn't impress as well.  I knocked a star off for that.  Sorry I'm not sorry, Arsicault.\n\nIs it worth the line?  Again, relative.  I waited 10 minutes, a perfectly acceptable time period to wait.  Hours though?  You should think about what else you have to do that day.The service was nothing special - I didn't get a receipt, so I have to go again tomorrow, but if you're churning through a line of people as fast as they do, I don't expect much on this front. \n\nPro tip: On weekdays they relax the pastry-per-person quantity to something more reasonable (I was told 12).", "author": "Iris N."}

I gave the bakery three stars because:\n\n1) Plain Croissant exceptionally good with nice flakey texture and buttery taste.\n2) Almond Croissant is essentially the same as plain with almond paste baked in the middle and a thin layer spread on top which browns (over burnt on mine) during baking. The filling is not creamy as some reviewers have written and overall croissant too sweet.\n3) Ham and Cheese Croissant was OK. Basic savoury option in standard plain dough.\n\nIt's hard to justify Bon Appetit's claim that this is America's best bakery since there are several  options in San Francisco that can compete equally. \n\nThe lines at the bakery, due to the BA title, wrap around the store front. Servers try to be efficient to manage the waiting crowd but, during my visit, failed to provide adequate service. There was one server (younger guy with curly brown hair) that was very rude to many Asian customers who do not speak fluent English (his English was not fluent either).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-12", "description": "The PLAIN croissants are bomb, BUT I won't be coming back for the almond one. While most people rave about it, I found it to be WAY TOO sweet such that the sugar masked the almond flavor entirely. If I did a blind taste test didn't see the almond filling inside, I would have thought I was having a custard filled croissant. Would have liked some slivered almonds on top at the very least. It's not necessarily a bad pastry, it just doesn't taste like the normal almond croissant I'm used to. Much more like a Kouign Imann but with some almond paste inside. Again the almond paste didn't taste like  marzipan/almonds (I like when it tastes like what almond extract smells like~ hard to explain). Nonetheless besides the sweetness, it was super crispy on top and nice and oily in the center. Will definitely be back for more plain croissants but unlikely to ever have the almond croissant again.", "author": "Isabella L."}

Sometimes the line is 5 to 6 house-lengths down the block (I would estimate the longest line I've seen had well over 100 people in it).\n\nHowever, I walked by one day and the line was shockingly slim--only four people ahead of me. The pastries are not to be underestimated. They are flavorful, flaky, fresh, and delicious. If your typical croissant comes from Starbucks, you might not even recognize these masterful creations. These are the Jean Claude Van Damme-in-his-prime of croissants (The Best of the Best--a classic). On par with Tartine.\n\nAs far as the wait goes, however, I am not a typical San Francisco line-waiter. I would say these croissants are worth your time if the line is 10 people or less. Personally, I wouldn't consider waiting in a 100 person line, but maybe that's your fetish. In that case, don't let me stop you.\n\nIf you happen by and get the opportunity, these pastries are serious.", "author": "Will G."}

I got a Chocolate Almond croissant. (~$5) Somehow the softest and most buttery thing, but with the most perfect crispy flakiness. So many adjectives, I know, but it's hard to describe how delicious these are! Definitely a must-try if you're in the San Fran/Richmond area!!", "author": "Sara T."}

Their croissants are made to perfection.  \n\nThe tasty pastries have the perfect ratio of flakiness on the outside to stringy chewiness of butter and bread inside. My personal favorites are the almond, kouign-amann, and ham & cheese croissants.\n\nDon't let the inevitable long line deter you.

Would recommend the almond croissant and the ham and cheese croissant to everyone!! So delicious!\n\nI heard that the line is crazy on weekends but on a Wednesday morning there was no line at all and a full shelf of pastries. We ordered the ham&cheese croissant ($5.50), the almond croissant ($5), morning bun ($4.25), and kouign amann ($4). \n\nHonestly I would recommend getting just the almond and ham&cheese! The almond had the perfect amount of sweetness and delicious almond paste inside. The ham&cheese was also great! The croissant itself was fresh and fluffy and perfectly buttery.\n\nThe morning bun had a slight citrus orange kick and cinnamon but was a bit too sweet for me.

Arsicault's kitchen is tiny. They can only produce a certain number of pastries in that kitchen, not because of the oven capacity, but simply because they probably don't have enough refrigeration facilities. They also had no idea they were going to be named the top bakery in Bon Appetit or what madness would ensue.\n\nSame number of supply (they already sold out every day anyway) - and more people. The owners have had to hire more people to help with sales, but they're not selling any more croissants than before. Therefore their cost is higher. Yet they continue to try and produce croissants and make it so that they can have enough pastries for as many people who are standing in line. \n\nLet's face it, if they didn't put a limit on the pastries right now, they'd sell out super quick and not everyone would get a chance to taste their croissants. So for all those discontent with the purchase limit (which is devastating, because I used to be able to gleefully get as many as I wanted) or who feel that other places are better - yes, please go to the other stores and eat their croissants instead. With you out of line, that's one less person that I have to wait behind.", "author": "Mary M."}

I have no choice but to be critical here - we dropped $46 for 10 pastries, so these croissants must be FDA approved and tremendously potent.\n\nLine was not that bad. Arrived 10:00 am on a Saturday, queued behind about 7 people. Arrival to croissant in hand took ~15 minutes.\n\nSome details for those prepping for management consulting interviews, or those of you who are really particular about line mechanics: they serve about 1 customer group roughly every 3 minutes. Each customer group has 1-4 people, and each person buys 1-2 items. Each croissant costs $4.50+. The bakery's hours are on this Yelp listing. They appeared to employee three people at the register, and a few more folks in the back baking and moving pastries to the front. They can take the next group's order while the group ahead pays.\n\nThey do accept credit card.\n\nWe got the chocolate almond, ham and cheese, and regular.\n\nThe ham and cheese was really nice - crispy, flakey, buttery on the outside. Warm, soft, and savory on the inside. A tad too salty though.\n\nThe chocolate almond croissant had a less flakey and layery exterior. Inside was intensely rich and sweet - the filling oozed out. It was actually too much flavor-wise. Some restraint in terms of sugar added would have helped. Instead of concentrating all the filling in a big central pocket, would be better to evenly spread a thin layer across the entire pastry.\n\ntl;dr - it's a croissant, not a Patek Phillipe. \"Artisinal perfection\"?

We were in the neighborhood and decided to wait in line for 30 or so minutes\n\nCaveat. Since their peak in popularity, the owners now limit each patron to 3 pastries, and you can only buy one of each type of pastry. So if you love something, come with friends!!! \n\nThey don't sell baguettes. What kind of French bakery doesn't have baguettes? Ok moving along. \n\nFor two of us we were able to buy two ham and cheese croissants, two pain au chocolat, and two almond croissants \n\nI had dreams of trying their kouign amann, alas they didn't have any that day!\n\nFor six pastries we spent $30. Normal considering manresa bread is near us but no real wait for that and it's local and similar in pricing. \n\nWe first tried the ham and cheese on our drive home. We shared it during the drive trying not to make any crumbs in our car. It was A M A Z I N G!!!!  Maybe because we hadn't eaten all morning, and it was noonish, but it was so buttery and so flaky and filled with cheese and jambon. Mm. I have yet to get such a good ham and cheese croissant in the us until now! This definitely reminds me of being in Paris and in the south of France. Yum. Heaven. My hubby claimed I didn't give him half of that first croissant so he didn't really want to share half with me when we got home and got to eating our second one. Lesson learned. Don't share hear bad boys! \n\nValrhona pain au chocolat. Yummy! The chocolate is semi firm semi melted gooey and mixed up in that amazing croissant dough. I have never had chocolat semi melted before! Usually they are the hard bricks of chocolat and the hubs prefers it that way. But I kind of dig this melted goodness! \n\nAfter all of that we weren't able to justify the calories so we saved the almond croissant for the next day. Hubby had his in the morning and it was delicious. I had my afternoon snack and it was still crispy and sweet and so almondy! Not uber sweet, just right! \n\nWill definitely be back to try out the kouign amann that some claim is flaky and caramel iced like palmiers. If I'm in the area, We will be back! \n\nNow I need to find a place for kouign amann in Paris since we are headed there again in October! Recommendations welcome!", "author": "Judy N."}

It was crispy, buttery, flakey with a soft layered inside that you couldn't get enough of. It was also fresh out of the oven which may have helped but definitely wowed by this. \n\n1 Chocolate Croissant - 5/5: Incredible chocolate croissant, not too sweet, great texture and just solid. Also had just come out of the oven so the chocolate was melted which gave it an extra kick.\n\n1 Almond Croissant - 3/5: I would skip this personally. I am actually a big fan of almond croissants and although it was decent I just wasn't that impressed and given how good the other things are I would order something else.\n\nThe place is small, the line is long and it takes a bit of time to get your order taken. I guess the thing that is nice is that the staff don't seem to be rushing you, they are happy to answer questions about what they have and are warm and friendly through the whole process.

That would be where we would sit. \n\nI bit into the Ham and cheese croissant. Softness of a buttery croissant, crisp crackle of the crust, warm ham and the cheese still gooey and stringing. Amazing. I took a moment and put that down and like the fatty I am I bit into the other croissant.\n\nButtery sweet crunch, soft flakey center... And then it happened. I was taken. I drifted into the past to the first time I ever had a croissant and all the tastes and characteristics that made me love them. I thought of every croissant I've ever had in my life and how they couldn't ever measure to what I just tasted. My smile and daydreams must have had me looking quite silly as the owner came out of the kitchen and asked if he was the reason for that smile I had on my face. Quickly I exited my trance and wiped the croissant flakes from my mouth and exclaimed \"yes!\" \n\nWhat a win this morning to be brought to somewhere so delightful with a product that made my heart sing. I can't believe I'm writing this sappy and intense of a review for a bakery but it's truly something else.\n\nTo my understanding they have been making specializing and perfecting these croissants for several generations. In the seating area you can see a big photograph of their family many years ago at their bakery in France. Next to that is their original street cart from which they sold their goods. How cool!\nI will definitely be coming back here and telling everyone.", "author": "Paula P."}

Was it worth it? YUP. Very yup.\n\nThe biggest piece of advice you need when coming here is that they limit you to only four items and you cannot purchase more than two of any single item. I'm not sure if this is a weekend restriction or what. Most people in line won't realize this until they get close to the door where there's handwritten piece of copy paper hanging in the window. I was a bit confused at first since people were walking out with boxes yet I think the boxes is for groups of people combining their orders.\n\nThe line moves slowly. The main reason for this is coffee service and staff. Coffee orders really slow down the entire process. I'm not sure if the entire staff is French or not, but the service is very French. It's very \"I'll at the speed I like thank you very much\" yet once you get at the front they are very attentive and give each customer the same kind of care and respect. The line speed may be deliberate as the supply of goods is constantly being restocked. A guy with a pan will come from the kitchen and hand it over to the front to put in the window area.\n\nArsicault is small. There are three tables in front with chairs and the interior houses only the window counter with three employees. It seems like the kitchen is also crammed in there since they have to oddly walk down stairs to get to level ground.\n\nOn my visit I ordered an almond croissant, kouign amann, morning roll, and ham + cheese croissant. Depending on your timing they might be just out of a certain item or if you're lucky like me they'll be bringing in a fresh steaming batch. Once I got my bag I went to the tables outside to eat one. What's weird is that NOBODY eats at these tables. Everyone disappears into the ether like they didn't just wait 40+ minutes for some sugar, butter, flour, and water (don't forget the yeast and salt!).\n\nMy first bite in the almond croissant was heavenly. I did a reactionary hand-to-the-mouth like I just had witnessed public child abuse. The insides were still steaming! What makes their goods so good is the amount of caramelization. It's crispy, sugary, and oh so delightful. Not to mention the airiness and super flakey texture.\n\nThe other items in my box of golden treasures were just as high in quality. I would advise consuming everything the same day; even though that an easy take. Even when locked in an air tight container, the baked good loses about 25% of its airy magic the next day.\n_____\n\nPure magic worth the wait.\n\nFun note: Talked to a neighboring bartender who said Arsicault was struggling to get customers a couple of months ago.", "author": "Michael H."}

I waited probably around 5 minutes and ordered the max of 5 (can only order 2 of each kind). I got two almond, ham and cheese, chocolate and plain crossiants. They were super big, flaky and looked delicious. I was told to eat it right away so I had the ham and cheese and although it was hot and fresh it was a bit hard to eat because it was super flaky and every bite I had crumbs came rolling down. Also, I thought it didn't have enough ham and had too much cheese. The chocolate and almond crossiant was okay. I'm a chocoholic but not for choco crossiant I guess cuz it didn't blow me away. Same goes for the almond. Only some parts of the almond crossiant were good but most of it was too sweet for me. Overall it's good but not worth time and $$.

He got in line and waited 45 mins. for the limited 4 items/per person.  The woman in front couldn't wait any longer and left with her golf clubs.  A man left the line and was heard calling on his phone that he couldn't wait any longer.  Such is the price of fame.  \n\nHubby picked up 2 each - plain and choc croissants.  He saw the baker in the back working feverishly to make another batch of baked goods.  Such is the price of fame.  Hubby thought the staff was civil and helpful as he watched other customers point to each item, inquiring..\"And what is that?  And what is that?\"  Trying the patience of staff.  Such is the price of fame.  \n\nIt was a treat to come home after work to a white paper bag full of goodies.  We had the croissants for \"dessert\".  Why not?  When you have scored croissants from a bakery blessed by Bon Appetit Magazine and waited 45 mins. in line for it, it's elevated to a new food group. \nSuch is the price of fame.\n\nThe plain croissant has a chewy texture and when you pull it apart, the inside is airy, fluffy and the dough stretches, like a piece of chewing gum.  It's not as buttery as some of the croissants I've had in Paris, but it is good.  It's certainly not dry like the ones you get at other bakeries.  \n\nThe chocolate croissants are square shaped, looks like 2 pieces of smaller rectangular doughs pieced together and in the center of each is a 1/2 inch width chocolate stick extending the entire length of the croissant.  It was good but one of the best chocolate croissants I've had was when Costco bakery used to make them and it was full of rich tasting chocolate pieces.  \n\nOverall, I prefer the plain croissants to the choc ones here.  Wonder if Hubby is willing to brave the lines again for the other items.... Such is the price of fame.", "author": "Ry T."}

Which, even without contributing my review, has already happened on more than one occasion. Although admittedly I have never left without a treat or 2 in hand, as the great thing is they make a fresh batch of a few of the items throughout the morning as they do tend to sell out often! It's has indeed saved me a few times!\n\nI apologize for the lack of pictures, these treats never make it out the front door and are far too delicious to waste time staging them on a plate.\nThese pastries taste as though I am back in France. Consuming the crisp flaky outer shell that encases the buttery and mellow filling that is the Almond Croissant, just transports me back, bite after salivating bite!\n\nThe Chocolate Almond croissant is not for the faint of heart. The decadence that the chocolate lends to the richness of the almond paste...comprising a variety of textures throughout this pastry (they do not skimp on the contents)...The two fillings combined create such a...my god, words escape me! When you receive it warm and fresh, even if not fresh but re-warmed in a toaster oven. The chocolate often runs out from the ends as you try to eat it, reminding you to be ever so gentle, as not to waste the contents on the pastry bag.\n\nThe Kouign Amann(Queen Amman) flaky in nature as well, has been extremely crisp on the exterior with a sweet toffee brittle like composition when I've received it. A nice addition to tea or coffee for me.\n\nGoing to this bakery. Although a trek for me from the peninsula, is always worth the time and distance. I have on several occasions gone in with the mindset that I will allow myself to enjoy 1 treat and only 1, after walking away to go enjoy the farmers market down the street found myself waltzing back in the front door of the shop and pirouetting away with a box full of bake goods! haha Admittedly my resolve is fairly weak!\n\nSo I caution you fellow pastry lovers: Beware these treats are endearingly addictive!\n\nTo the owners, I want to say thank you and please keep at it!\nOh! And a stamp card for those fellow loyal customers would be nice touch! :)", "author": "Shannan M."}

Verdict: Best croissants this side of the hemisphere! Even my chef father said he's never tasted anything like it (he doesn't travel but did live in Montreal for 10+ yrs.).\n\nNot much more to add to what other reviewers already covered. Just a quick recap then...\n\n+ All croissants are so very very very flaky, buttery and airy--with just the right amount of chew.\n+ Fillings come in ham & cheese, almond, chocolate almond, and chocolate. A special shout out to the almond filling...smooth with just the right texture of nuts tho a tad sweet for my taste.\n+ Kouign Amann is a coiled caramel-y delight, different from B's version (which is still the best, IMHO).\n+ 4 items run slightly under $20. \n+ Line is still long on Sundays and early mornings before work starts, though moves quickly.\n+ Friendly staff.\n+ Croissant is still so flaky after two days if kept in airtight container...just pop it in a toaster oven or the oven on 350\u00b0F for 4 to 5 min.\n\nOnly gripe is that the chocolate croissant's chocolate filling rolls to one side so you don't get chocolate in every bite. And the high prices keep me away, but that's a good thing for the sake of better health I suppose.", "author": "Lil D."}

We are San Franciscans, having tried Tartines' pastries many times (and have over the years invariably suffered standing in line until my legs refused to do it any longer).  Here's our verdict:  Arsicault's morning bun is NOT the best and smaller than its rival's; their Kouign Amann is very good and its rival doesn't have anything equal; their almond croissant is better than Tartine's but their ham & cheese croissant is nothing to kill for.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-02", "description": "Move over Tartine, hellooo Arsicault!\n\nA friend told me about this secret bakery with the best croissants, I was doubtful considering Tartine is my go to bakery.  She was so secretive, would not even tell me the name of the bakery, afraid that more people would discover this establishment and buy out all the yummy pastries.\n\nSo we arrived and the croissants looked amazing.  I tried both the chocolate and ham/cheese croissant.   The chocolate croissant is by far the winner!  Liquid gooey chocolate made with varlhona on the inside, a super flaky croissant with nice crispiness on the outside.  Not to mention one croissant is enough to make you want to workout for the next 2 hours.  But surprisingly the croissants are lighter, less dense, and just as tasty and delicious as Tartine.  The ham and cheese croissant is also good, the cheese and ham is on the lighter side which is nice.  But I didn't like the balance of cheese and ham on the inside, felt it needed more cheese and a slightly stronger cheese.\n\nThey make a true French style croissant, it looks very similarly made to Tartine bakery.  The main different i noticed is that the Croissants here are a little more flaky, slightly less buttery, and less dense and heavy, as compared to Tartine.  The chocolate croissant here tops Tartine for sure, there is no comparison.  However i still do love Tartine's ham and gruyere croissant because they use a higher quality cheese and melt more of it inside.  \n\nThis place has ample seating, its more of a grab n go place, the owners are nice, there were no long lines or crowds at 11am on a Sunday.  Definitely a step above Tartine, which has an avg 30min wait!\n\nSo who takes the winner of croissants?  Well I think its a tie right now, you can't really go wrong with either place!  Tartine does offer much more variety compared to Arsicault, who only focuses on a few pastries (mainly croissants).  Price wise, both Tartine and Arsicault are about the same.  I would keep coming back to Arsicault for croissants, even though its comparable (if not better) than Tartine, only because I get indoor seating and there are no long lines for goodies!\n\nSo if you are around town and want a nice flaky French style croissant, don't want to wait the long lines at Tartine, come to Arsicault!  You won't be dissapointed!", "author": "Terence N."}

My first problematic visits were back in the Spring when they first opened. OK- I get it- growing pains, the need to gauge your peak customer demands etc.  Then I had a few fruitful visits, I enjoyed their great croissants- regular, ham & cheese, pain au chocolate, almond croissant.  All are great- the reviews are spot on- they are perhaps the best in SF- top 3 for sure! \n\nBut I've since recently been back, on a weekend, and they had NOTHING.  Kudos to Ariscault for making sales- thats a compliment to your product.  But when you have not a crumb in the store to sell at 11am on a weekend day when you are allegedly open until 1pm- thats a farce.  I asked the staff and it wasn't clear that anything else would be ready anytime soon, so again I drove out of my way to buy some baked goods, but nothing.  You would think after approx 6 months in business you would figure this inventory management out, but apparently not.  So sadly, I find visiting Ariscault to be a bit of a crap-shoot- you can get lucky and they have great things to sell you, or you could waste your time like I have on 4-5 occasions over a 5-6 month period.  I can understand selling out of some things, but EVERY SINGLE ITEM? Incredible and terrible at the same time.  Maybe some view it as a successful sign of a 'hot' business, I view it as a disaster when you have to turn people away with money in hand at a prime weekend time without a single crumb to sell.  Maybe baking more on the weekend makes sense, guys? Would it be better to have a few extra croissants at the end of the day, than to send people away with $$$ in their pockets they were ready to throw at you? I understand you aren't that big of an operation, and that lends to the high quality of your goods.  But imaginary/hypothetical croissants don't taste very good....\n\nI'd rather visit B Patisserie not far away on California & Divisadero- they always have a line of patrons but always have great products to sell- you won't leave bummed out and empty-handed.  They are larger but still toe-to-toe in quality with Ariscault. I won't say I'll never be back, but Ariscault- your stuff is great but when you have nothing to sell me more often than not, I'm unlikely to make you a destination again.", "author": "Andy S."}

Limit 5 per person, so go with your friends so you can share the happiness! There were a group of us so we were able to try everything on the menu and more! V(^ _ ^)V The almond croissant was my fave followed by chocolate almond croissant. I tried the ham & cheese croissant which was also really good and buttery and delicious oh so yammmyyy. I thought the kouign aman was better at B. patisserie and the morning bun was too sweet for my liking, especially so early in the morning too. So...note to self and others, just get the croissants!! You haven't lived until you try them. SO GOOD.", "author": "Natalia H."}

The perfectly understated neighborhood French bakery with hot-out-of-the-oven pastries and croissants run by a French owner whose grandmother owned the original Arsicault Boulangerie in Paris. I believe him! There is a large photo of his grandmother standing in front of the original bakery.  The name is pronounced AR-SI-CO. \n\nI only tried the almond croissant. It is an amazing balance of caramelized sweetness and almonds. From the looks of the people coming and going, there are plenty of other fans of Arsicault's almond croissants.  The other pastries look just as good. Next time I plan to try the savory ham and cheese croissant.\n\nThe staff is friendly and knowledgeable about each of their creations.

EVER. \n\nHave tried the kouign amann, plain croissant, ham and cheese croissant, pain au chocolat, almond croissant, lemon tart, and almond tart. ALL are amazing. Croissants are crispy on the outside, super flaky and light. My favourite is probably the almond croissant and the ham and cheese croissant. \n\nAs for the tarts, the flavour of each main ingredient (lemon and almond) are so well-featured and drawn out, and the sweetness is just perfect. Both tarts are simple yet SO perfectly balanced. An amazing treat!! \n\nThe owner is a very welcoming and friendly French guy.

Charge twice compare to  an item at the established place ($5 for a croissant?! Even in Paris you will not be charged this outrageous sum of money for a croissant)\n3. Make sure shipple are standing in line. They will line up starting at 5:30-6am. Tell them after after few hours: we are sold out.\n4. Your employees should be trained to spend at least 10 minutes per customer. I am not kidding you. Customer is spending  7 minutes at the register only.\n 5. Dont  underestimate your customers stupidity. They will wait happily extra 15 minutes for \"almond cruissant\" after paying for the order.\n6. No one will EVER tell they spent 2 hours in line and pastry was just OK. Every lemming will preach and praise the place after spending $40/order.", "author": "Victor B."}

They only sell a few items, but that just means they spend time on perfecting those masterpieces they bake. Its flaky on the outside, chewy and gooey on the inside. Due to the high demand, you are only allowed to purchase 6 per customer. Since they are constantly baking, you always get a fresh croissant right out of the oven. The Kouign Amann is tantalizing. The perfect combination of flaky and buttery, but my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE is the Chocolate Almond. There is a ribbon of marzipan and chocolate that goes through the entire croissant, then its dusted with powdered sugar. I LUV THIS PLACE! I give it a 4 thumbs up!!!", "author": "Mo W."}

I don't have a problem with waiting for something I have voluntarily chosen to try out. I do have a problem with arrogance and snobbery. I can even understand setting a purchase limit on your most popular items. Mr. Holmes has a purchase limit on their outstanding cruffins ( and yeah you will still have to stand in line for those...and when they are gone, they are gone). But to set a purchase limit and also force you do buy something you may not want is well, fascist. I witnessed with my own two eyes and ears as the lady behind the counter told an elderly lady who had been waiting longer than me that she couldn't buy 2 almond croissants and 1 plain croissant! The lady behind the counter's hubris went even further as she coldly repeated her \"no, you can't\" to tell the elderly lady she \"could buy a cookie or a scone\". If I hadn't promised my coworkers that I would bring something from the latest \"wait in line because we are awesome\" spot, I would have walked out. \n\nI actually considered pushing back on the preposterously draconian \"if you want the privilege of giving us your money you must buy as we say\" edict but, decided my time was more valuable than challenging the illogic of such a rule. The ham and cheese croissant was superb. The plain croissant was everything Bon Appetite magazine said it was. And, I here, the kouign amann (I promised my coworker I would bring one) was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe pastries at Mr. Holmes Bakehouse are equally delicious. There is a greater variety. You don't have a limit on the number of pastries you can buy with the exception of the curffins. And, wait for it, you can buy any combination of pastries you want. And if you love the feeling of doing the \"cool\" thing of waiting in line for the \"in thing\" you can get that at Mr. Holmes as well.\n\nI gave Arsicault 13 of my dollars in two types ( a 10 and 3 singles) and that is all they will get from me. I hope they are wise and sock away the additional cash flow they will be getting from this temporary pop in business. Best of luck Arsicault.", "author": "Rommel T."}

Get told after 20 minutes in line that the owner is confident we'll have a croissant by the time we get to the cashier. One hour and half later the persons in front of us take the rest of the croissant, of course why wouldn't they. Only 4 scones left, I'm already fuming, I take two so the next person can at least have some crumbs like me, and pay for it. The person behind me, as a gesture, can get both scones left, free of charge! Way to make it even worse! Congrats! I've never felt so dumb buying pastries!\n\nLesson learned, do not wait for so long for a pastry, do not tell your kid waiting with you that it will be fine since the owner just told you you'll get your chocolate croissant (to then have to explain why their incompetence resulted in him being disappointed), and finally more importantly, never come to this place again.\n\nAlso really appreciated the staff laughing about telling the other 20+ people outside, who waited their fair share and were probably told as well that it would be fine, to just forget about the two hour they've just wasted and leave. All of it in front of us as well. They clearly left an impression on me. Maybe their croissant is good but now they'll clearly have a bad aftertaste if I was to try one...\n\nIf you feel like gambling with your time, give it a try!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-16", "description": "Sorry, not the best croissant I ever had, and sorry Bon App, you are wrong. But then again it depends on what one looks for in a croissant. If you are looking for a gooey, hot, slightly oversized, burnt, way too sweet, buttery (fat), pricey, diabetes inducing, hipster attraction, then this is the way to go and you'll love the wait.\nIf you are looking for an actual croissant, than is an abomination at worst and an American misunderstanding of French baking at best. A croissant is typically made from a 50/50 yeast and puff pastry dough, hence yeasty, hence not entirely flaky. It also is not dark brown burnt, and overloaded with chocolate or gooey almond paste. It is just too much, too much butter, too much almond, too much sugar, too much burnt, too much wait, too much money. There are better croissants to be had in SF, the US and certainly at every bar or cafe in Paris. Too much hype.", "author": "Michael S."}

Prices are about the same for these other upscale bakeries. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. I would give 5 stars but was very disappointed in the service. No greeting, no thank you, just place my items in a white, flat bag. The croissants had a beautiful top, but crushed by the little bag given. If you're paying top dollar for pastries you really need to place them in a box. I was giving them to a friend for her birthday. Not very good looking and I apologized for the packaging of the pastries. If I'm in the area I would go back to try other things, but hopefully the customer service will improve.

You know ya girl gets hangry if she doesn't get her pastries. The line usually extends way out the door to the neighboring business, but there were only a few people ahead of me that day. The almond croissant is still good, but the almond filling seems to be a little overwhelming. You definitely get a lot of it in every bite. My favorite is still the ham & cheese!!

In a city of tremendously talented bakers and pastry chefs, one man brings us something truly extraordinary to raise the bar so that everyone else is forced to take note.\n\nYes this place will have a line out the door if you come on the weekend. Yes they close at one and will run out of ham and cheese by 11:30. Yes the croissants are like $5 each, and yes they are more than worth it!\n\nGo here early and get two croissants. Trust me on this, eating just one will leave you driving back to get another. It is rare to see anyone in line get just one. The regulars all know something that you're about to become hip to. This bakery makes the best damned croissants you will probably ever eat anywhere!\n\nSo on Bastille day I decided to make a bold declaration that I will endeavor to eat more croissants, lol. Seriously, you need these in your life. You don't know it yet, but the pastries here are mood altering, sweet life changing, amazing, and so darned good that Poets struggle to find words to define their delicious awesomeness.\n\nThe owner is the nicest man on the planet, or at the very least he seems to exude the aura of a holy man, then again that glow might come from the high you get eating these freaking croissants! The staff is awesome, super nice and helpful, & once this place gets their expresso machine it will surely be even more packed. \n\nGo here as soon as you can, before hipsters start migrating north to see it! Go taste what pure unadulterated happiness tastes like. Then eat that second croissant and enjoy the bliss that follows. I warn you. You might find yourself spinning and singing or dancing in the park, or skipping down the sidewalk. \n\nA visit to Arsicault will change your day. It is every bit as good as you imagine and more, so go... Now before they run out! Don't say I didn't warn you, these things are habit forming. Enjoy.\n\nCHAD", "author": "Chad L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-29", "description": "Arsicault makes good croissants, sure. But I have 2 problems with them: price and availability. A croissant, as its European bakers should know, is a staple breakfast item, but at $5-6, theirs are more of a luxury. I know, SF rents, high costs, bla bla, but the matter of the fact is that for me, and probably not only for me, it's a once-a-week kind of a treat. Which brings us to the problem #2: when you crave a certain type of a croissant for a day or two, come to Arsicault, wait in a queue only to be told they are out, or just sold their last one, all you can do is just raise your arms in frustration, as it happens 2 out of 3 times whenever I visit Arsicault. They are a victim of their own popularity. For locals and regulars, it's not a good thing, but for the bakery, of course, it's good enough so that they don't have to care to bake more of their more popular items to meet the demand. After all, there are enough technohipsters and tourists in San Francisco to keep them in business for many years to come.", "author": "Evg R."}

Let's give him a break!\nMany posters have remarked on the Almond croissant being dark...it's SUPPOSED to be EXACTLY THIS WAY as its twice baked with all it's crispy shatteringly rich with almond creme goodness! We are so used in this country to the frozen dough donut shop version with margarine (by the way that is much cheaper to make and therefore more profit) that cudos to this baker for not only sparing no expense in his butter or other costly ingredients but taking the risk to make products as they are classically made in France even to some customers that may not be familiar with them...risking the frankly ignorant comments some of the yelpers have made! Everyone is entitled to their opinion certainly but to risk damaging a business with real employees with real jobs especially to someone who has chosen CRAFT over PROFIT (when he's actually doing it right) as this baker has clearly shown is wrong in my opinion. It also makes no sense to slam him because he got \"famous\" through no fault of his own as he only got this tremendous honor by caring about his work AND his customers!!

I've since moved away and watched as Bay Breads grew into La Boulange, before selling to Starbucks and hitting an all time low when an employee last summer asked me if I would like my croissant \"heated up\". I believe my exact response was \"sure, I don't care, I don't even want it any more, just give it to me\". To replace the gap in my soul of a good croissant, I have since learned to make them myself, and so while I am not an expert on croissants, I'd like to think I know a thing or two. I went to Arsicault twice within a span of 4 days the last time I stayed in the city, and got to sample most of their menu: plain, chocolate, almond, chocolate almond, ham and cheese, and kouign amann. All of them were great. Chocolate almond was the stand out: it was superb. I haven't tried b. patisserie and so I can't compare, but I can't imagine their croissants could be any better. I've probably had croissants as good in France, and I did really like Bay Breads', but I can't say I've ever had better. The line is long, truth, but one of the times Larry Baer walked up, so that instantly made the wait worthwhile.", "author": "Michael K."}

(Just to make sure, we had friends straight from Paris taste them and they agreed). We like to go there on Sunday mornings, when the croissants come fresh and warm from the oven (I also tried close to closure time on a weekday but they were not as great = dryer).\n\nI want to command the owner who transitioned from working in Finance to starting his own bakery business, continuing his grandparents legacy. He and his staff are very friendly and unpretentious so it's always a pleasure to go there...and not have to wait for ever!\n\nNow, the 5 stars are for the croissants and I would give only four stars to the chocolate croissants because of the chocolate. Other places like Le Marais may provide better chocolate croissants (although they are a bit too flaky in my opinion and may not come as fresh as often). I think Arsicault has the right amount of butter/fluff/flakes but the chocolate could be darker and tastier. I also tried the Kouign Amman, which resembled more to a caramelized croissant than the Kouign Ammans I could remember from Brittany.\n\nOverall, this is a great...and odd place (a \"bakery\" that sells only a few patisseries items and no bread). If you want to sit down, they have tables on the upper floor and two wooden tables outside. They serve a few cold beverages and only drip coffee (so no caps, lattes or hot chocolates, which I think would be really great to add).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "We went yesterday at around 10:00, the line was about three buildings long (less than the length to the light post) and we didn't get our pastries until 12. Some people in front of us said that they waited for 3 hours+. They ran out of plain croissants at around 11:30 so I suggest getting there EARLY if you want a chance at the infamous plain croissants. The line paused for long amounts at a time because they had to wait for the new pastries to cool. If you go, I suggest waiting until around thanksgiving to allow them to figure out how to handle as massive of a crowd as shows up. They had so many people that we were limited to 3 pastries/person, so I recommend finding a 2 hr parking a few blocks away by the residential neighborhoods. Right now, they are understaffed and their kitchen/location are way too tiny to churn out enough to meet the demand. We ended up getting the almond croissant, kouign amann (koo-ween ah-mahn), morning bun, and the chocolate almond croissants. All were great and freshly made. The kouign amann was just like a round puff pastry with a palmier cookie type caramelized top--my favorite of the trip. The almond/almond chocolate croissants were great as well, but I'm not a huge fan of the almond paste. The morning buns were great and had a hint of orange zest (as told by the employees) although I couldn't taste much orange. A lot of people called in to order for pickup (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CALLING AHEAD). This is another reason why the line was paused so many times. Every time an order was put in, the fresh pastries would first go to the pre orders, and then to the customers waiting. As only 5-10 of each pastry are brought out every 20 minutes, you can imagine the hold up. The owner is very kind and down to earth--he came out several times to thank us for coming and shook several hands. He was completely overwhelmed by the crowd and apologized profusely for the 3 pastry/person limit and for running out of plain croissants. despite the wait, I suggest eating them as soon as you purchase as they were the best French pastries I have ever had.", "author": "Mara M."}

Each of the buttery layers are perfectly airy and distinctly visible, compared to some bakeries that have the layers all smushed together and are dense like a hockey puck. Not this place!  Compared to Bouchon Bakery, which is already superb, these croissants have an even flakier interior, more buttery fragrance, and are slightly bigger to! The morning bun is also wonderful; it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Love this bakery! The owner is also very nice, and the service is always great.

The ham & cheese croissant is so buttery and flaky, with a good balance of the ham and cheese filling. You may be lucky enough to get one still warm, just brought out from the kitchen. The almond croissants are decadent with a sweet disc of almond paste crust baked on top and a rich, generous amount of almond paste on the inside. They also have scones, chocolate chip cookies, unfilled croissants, chocolate croissants, Kouign-ammans, and some others. Prices are on the higher side, but in the realm as other high quality bakeries.  These are good sized croissants and make for a great start to the day as a satisfying breakfast.

They certainly deserve Bon Appetite's high praise for their pastries, but they are a small operation bound to have been overwhelmed by the sudden fame and should be commended for coping as best they can under the circumstances. I also want to thank Armando for bringing me a croissant yesterday after I got hit by a car in the crosswalk next to the bakery - he didn't know it was a previous customer who'd been hit, he just came with a croissant because he's a great guy! Even after waiting and being abused in the ER for several hours before being consumed, the croissant still retrained some of the 5* rating it undoubtedly had when fresh, so now I have to manufacture another excuse to come back to the city to enjoy a fresh croissant.", "author": "Cathy C."}

I was blown away when the Arsicault croissant ended up better than any I had tasted in the city of light. What a find! The interior of the store is dark and a bit shabby, but who cares when you are tasting genius. Truly incredible. Light, flaky, fabulousness. Run don't walk!", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

Same for everything else i have tried... the ham and cheese croissant is perfect, the chocolate croissant to die for, the almond croissant is bliss. Delicious, fresh, buttery, flakey, just the right amount of sweetness... I can't wait for them to expand their offering. Arsicault is hands down the best french bakery in San Francisco, better than many bakeries in France even. Thank you for bringing some joy and deliciousness to my 'hood!", "author": "rebecca p."}
