I'm sorry to start my review this way but I have two kids and we have garbage.  There wasn't a single garbage can to be found.\n\nI think you just leave your trash on a random table and someone is hired to come around and pick it up.  These said cleaning people walk around with giant carts for picking up the garbage and the random plates and they separate it all to be thrown away or recycled.  These carts are pretty big and they do not care if they are in the way of moving people traffic at all.\n\nAnother thing about this food hub, there really isn't that much to choose from.  We walked around twice and finally decided on the lobster place but we really didn't even want that.\n\nI think Ill go exploring other options when we visit again.", "author": "Ivy R."}

Working downtown, I make the occasional stop here to run errands and grab lunch.\n\nOn the Nordstrom side, I've tried both Ajisen ramen and Napoleon macarons. Ajisen is a good option for quick ramen. Not as good as some of the ramen shops in the area, but if I don't want to wait forever for a table, Ajisen fulfills that ramen craving. Napoleon's macarons have great flavor, but I found them lacking in texture. More soft and cakey instead of having a slight chew.\n\nOn the Bloomingdale's side, I've actually tried more restaurants than places in the food court. Bristol farms is a nice option when you just want a variety of hot food. Kind of like a buffet. I've been known to grab a mishmosh of things (such as pizza, poki, etc) and bring them home for dinner. Recently, I tried Lobster me. Though it underwhelmed me, I was happy there was a lobster option in the mall.\n\nThere are so many restaurants in the food court.

Perfect for San Francisco, where shoppers usually consider themselves foodies, locals and tourists alike. This is a good place to bring your cousin from Lodi and impress her with SF's city cool style, even in food courts! Of course, it is not hard to impress her if all she is used to is shopping in Stockton or Tracy. \n\nThis is on the concourse level of the Westfield Mall, or as most people know it, the Nordstrom Mall. Westfield Mall's are all over the world, and it is actually a huge Australian outfit that owns Westfield Valley Fair in San Jose, Westfield in Culver City, and a bunch more in the US, Australia, the UK, and other hotspots. \n\nCalling it the Food Emporium is a bit of an homage to the old Emporium, the 'Big E\", which for decades was a downtown SF department store fixture, and a regional chain with stores on the SF Peninsula. It was afflliated with the sister chains of Capwell's in the east bay, Weinstock's in Sacramento, and Broadway's in SoCal. The Big E in San Francisco had it's famous Dome, and basement specials, and had a Notions department. The entire chain was bought out and by Federated I think, and maybe parts were sold off to Macy's. \n\nI digress, but the name Emporium has a soft spot in many old San Franciscans' heart and wallet. So The Food Emporium name provides either some instant comfort, or confusion to the Westfield Mall shopper, depending on their senility. \n\nThe Big E was never this nice. The Food Emporium is nothing like your standard Food Court. It is closer to Macy's Cellar, but with many different food concessions. The decor is upscale, to match that unique circular Escalator this mall is known for, which really impresses those relatives from Lodi, or Manteca, or Modesto. \n\nThere are modern chandeliers, colorful decor, rich textures and better than Ikea furniture in the Food Emporium. And you can find better than Sbarro's TCBY, Annie's Pretzel's, and Cinnabon food sources here. Like Pete's Coffee (better than Starbucks) and Melt, for Gelato and Crepes, and many more lunch and dinner eateries. \n\nSo when in-laws from the great San Joaquin Valley come into town to visit, wow them with shopping and the upscale escalator in the Westfield Mall, and impress them with the fancy Food Emporium, and you will avoid having to take them to an expensive, real SF restaurant.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

It used to be a destination lunch spot for me because of the huge quantity of food, and the good quality. Well, the quality has certainly declined over the past several months but today really grossed me out. I had the Panang Beef Curry with white rice and Pad Thai. The beef was cubed and tasted old and dry. The curry sauce was ok but missing that distinctly nutty taste I look forward to with panang. The pad thai was gross. The sauce was obviously burned as it tasted bitter and the noodles were extra chewy. Yum, just what I wanted on my lunch hour -- old beef and rubber bands.

I should be more adventurous though. I usually order from the Korean place. There isn't that many Korean places in town. I don't think there is any near downtown SF. \n\nThey also have Thai, Italian, Japanese, burgers, steaks, etc.\n\nThere is a lot of seating also but I am giving them 4 stars because at times it gets sooo crowded its hard to find seats and the lazy leave your food at the table when you are done thing cause there isn't that many garbage cans around. They hire people to take your trash. \n\nO there is a Bristol Farms there for anyone who needs to do grocery shopping... Weird... I know.. I like browsing and looking at some of the ridiculously priced things they sell.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Staff is always floating around to bus your dishes and keep the place neat and clean. There are no harsh florescent lights giving everyone a ghastly pallor. Instead, the soothing decor and lighting almost invokes zen. In a mall food court, I know! \n\nFood vendors are also located in the middle of the seating areas, creating a nice flow and separation. But it does make it hard to avoid temptations when two of them are Beard Papa and Gelato stands. We failed miserably to resist Beard Papa. Trying to hold a meeting at a table next to Beard Papa as they crank out fresh and delicious pastries is not a good idea.

I see girls who look pretty classy arm in arm with these waif-thin, veiny, sallow-skinned punks with the standard unbent baseball cap, jeans around the knees, and UFC shirt XXLarge. Now, teenagers will always dress like assholes and that's fine and how it should be. But teenagers have been dressing like this for 20 fucking years. I want to see this evolve a little. If you're going to sag your pants, why not pioneer something new? I have some ideas. Sure you could increase the sag and drop them around your ankles, -- that's pretty brave. But if you want to take it to the next level, why not try the Ectopic Sag? You take a pantleg and tie it around your shin and just drag the rest of the pants behind you. \n\nNone of this really matters because I missed my own point: these teenagers are in their fucking 30's. \n\nThe guy from Hotchickswithdouchebags.com should assign an intern to camp out here. \n\nLet's look at some positives: this is a hipster-free environment.

The words 'MALL....FOOD....COURT\" strung together in a sentence bring to mind thoughts of awkward high school times, greasy fast food, free Chinese chicken samples, and maybe 80s movies..... but not any sort of date-related venture. \n\nWhile you may run into free chicken samples (and quite a few other delicious free nibbles to try), this is not your momma's food court. High end, TONS of options (yes, even for vegetarians like myself)- all of them delicious and for the most part reasonably priced. Bristol Farms is not exactly cheap, but this is the type of market that kind of makes me want to run around, pick up apples and toss them around and sing \"The Hills are Alive\".... or something. Anyway, it's nice. I recommend sandwich counter, pizza, fresh salad, or any of the fresh fruit & veggies.\n\nAs someone who is perpetually changing ingredients on menu items, I am also a huge fan of the SF Soup company's salads- SO MANY great fresh things to shove into, on, around, and generally all over your mixed up greens it could make you satisfied all day. \n\nThere's also a slew of other choices - Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Crepes... you name it, it's here. Just don't look for McDonald's, cause this place is too good for that.  \n\nAnd while, yes, this is still a food court- I'm not doing a total 180 here claiming they've got white tablecloths and candles- it is a much, much better food court than any other I can remember (save for one in Switzerland.... yes, SWITZERLAND. But they had really good icecream)- good enough even for a date. Well, a lunch date anyway. But not a first date.

You can get an $8 Vietnamese sandwich or a $10 burrito. I'm not going to bemoan the fact that most of the food is overpriced in a city that is saturated with great, cheap ethnic restaurants because we are, after all, talking about a mall food court. So, by that standard, this place is pretty fucking swank. All I'm saying is don't expect to find a Panda Express or Hot Dog On a Stick here.

Not even a Roman orgy.\n\nIf Westfield SF is supposed to represent the very best of San Francisco, what's a meh BBQ place doing here, or an unheard of place that does pasta, and pizza. Or a pseudo Korean Sorabol mall court place? Or a case of ID crisis of Mr Hana that's not so Japanese and not so Hawaiian (for sure not a little bit country and for sure not a little bit rock and roll).\n\nThe crepe and gelato vendor stop is probably the most attractive place of the lot, but does it really represent SF? Andale has fantastic tasting Mexican plates, but $9? Ouch. That's what you get for getting good stuff in a clean environment downtown. And Out The Door? C'mon Charles you can do something better than that....how about something authentic Vietnamese and not a cross fusion of Cantonese comfort food (like congee and oil sticks) with more cases of ID crisis.\n\nIf I were able to re-do or re-select vendors I'd pick something like:\n\n1) Get Zuni Cafe to do a food court stall, scaled down, but keep a few signature offerings. Let's face it, Zuni *is* an SF institution amongst foodies, snobs, and people in the know, and I only ate there once years ago (wasn't blown away then, but I respect what they do).\n\n2) Have one of the great Italian places come sign up, and also offered easy scaled down but good food. A16, Delfina, etc come to mind. Heck even Pizzeria Delfina sounds good.\n\n3) Get at least one of the vendors from the SF Ferry Building. Blue Bottle would make a killing here if they could set up shop there. Pranther Ranch would sell chicken sandwiches like crazy I'm sure. \n\n4) Get the best Chinatown restaurant to the \"Emporium\" and do strictly authentic Cantonese fare like won ton noodles, cha siu or BBQ meats over rice plate. MAYBE a little bit of dim sum but don't push it. No Mr. Chau's fast food, no Happi House Teriyaki, no Sorabol, no Panda Express, and no crappy steam table supermarket fare.\n\n5) At least several representations of the best ethnic food SF has to offer. I'm sure you have your faves, whether it be Peruvian, Ethiopian etc. But you won't find that in the yuppified mall court.\n\n6) Try to court Thomas Keller into opening an even more scaled down Bouchon kind of place here.

You don't have to go looking for the garbage...if you do, you'll get weird looks...like I did. Anywho, if you're not into shopping then at least hit the food court for a feel. If you're not into Asian food then go to the crepes/gelato stall! They make the crepes in front of you. Hope you enjoy!", "author": "Shirley L."}

Anyway, the food was great & it only cost $8.95 before tax!!  \n\nThe one annoyance I had was with the huge crowds.  I was with a group of 11 so it was obviously hard trying to sit together.  We managed to collect chairs & tables while people bought food so by the time everyone had their food, we had sucessfully acquired 5 small tables  & 11 chairs.

Just hear me out before you judge.\n\nI am one of those people who needs to eat every hour or I get cranky. I tend to walk home from work from time to time with my guy and the mall is right on our way. By the time I make it all the way over to 5th and Mission, I am STARVING! So one day on our walk home, a moment of cranky hunger (my man likes to refer to it as something else that begins with a b) over came me. We just so happened to be in front of the mall. I was dragged quickly downstairs to get a quick bight to eat. \n\nI staggered up and down the court checking the food out with my tummy grumbling. All I can remember in my daze, was that to my surprise, there was some pretty decent looking food. We ended up eating at Coriander Thai and had a yellow curry and a veggie tofu dish. Pretty yum yum.\n\nMy blood sugar started to rise and I looked around the food court area now a sane and somewhat rational person. Whoa. I noticed people drinking wine and laughing like they would at a restaurant. How cool is that? I also noticed a gelato stand right smack in the middle of court. Even cooler. I looked at the tables surrounding us, not everyone had a shopping bag. This meant people were coming here like we were, just to eat. Interesting. It dawned on me then that this place was not a regular food court. We continued our walk home that evening with full bellies and lots of cheer. I had found a new drop-in-and-eat destination in the most unsuspecting location.\n\nNow I regularly stop down here on my walks home with or without company. It's great. Of course I try to avoid the rest of the mall as much as possible.

The jewelry stores are very fun to window shop as well.\n\nI haven't used the spa before, but have heard its very nice....may get my girlfriend a gift there.\n\nI love the movie theatre, and the seat comfort puts the Metreon to shame.  \n\nBristol Farms has helped to redefine nice store shopping in the city and is a pleasant alternative to Whole Foods.\n\nThe food court is often too crowded, but has a great selection (not your typical mall food court with hot dog on a stick).  I can get a great burger, sandwich, salad, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Mexican, crepes, smoothies, etc.  I love it.  I can actually walk there from my place to grab dinner too if I want something tasty, don't feel like cooking and don't want to spend $100 at a local restaurant.\n\nFinally, you've got to check out the dome.  Its the old dome/skylight from the Emporium that closed down and this really pleasantly integrates historical elegance and modern luxury.\n\nAlso, this mall is a hop, skip and a jump from Union Square, for even more shopping and restaurants.\n\nHands down, five stars!!!", "author": "Aaron M."}

Sure the price is a little high...But after spending $350.00 on an amazing pair of Marc Jacobs, 4 inch, peep toe heels, what's another $10 for a great salad?    After all...shopping takes alot out of a girl!", "author": "Charisse F."}

Lots of wooden chairs, grey metals, etc.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS\nDid no one else smell the STRONG WHIFF of synthetic sweet/sour sauce smell??   My friends and I could smell that from all the way inside Bloomingdales while walking past the women's bag section.   It was so strong..it almost made us turn around and NOT go into the food court.\n\nThe cleaning staff around the food court were attentive and for the most part really nice.  Except for the guys toting out the big rolling  trash bins.  Those guys were from the wrong side of the hood rehabilitation program, and were mouthing off at patrons \"Get the hell out of the way...man!..Damn!\" as they carted their trash bins through.   Their manager seemed to look the other way.    I'm not so sure how long that will last before getting addressed.\n\nTHE PEOPLE (*sigh)\nAt the same time, if I had to encounter the patrons like the ones at this food court, I'd probably be yelling like those trash guys were too.  (Not to condone what they did..but I UNDERSTAND...=) )\n\nSNOOTY SNOOTY SNOOTY.  \n\nSprinkled all over the footcourt was like a casting call for all \nthe young girls who wanted to be on the show Laguna beach.\n\nLots of Abercrombie Blondes, and the token azn who could look very slender chic, or could be lumbering w/turnip like ankles.  Depends on which food they were eating =)\n\nLots of big sunglasses, tight jeans, rhinestones, and hoop earrings.\nOh and lots of purses w/Coach brand \"C's\" plastered all over.  Just spells CLASS.\n\nLots of blazer wearing sneaker heads w/a skull cap if you're hip hop..or spikey hair if you're not.  Holla if you hear meh!\n\nPeople sit, and look at or THROUGH each other..if you will..in a very pretentious way..as to check what other people are doing...but make a futile attempt at faking it =)   \n\nAmidst the faking funk, you'll find some upscale burger joints, salads, pastas, etc.\n\nThe most popular restaurants seemed to be Sorabol (the sweet/sour version of korean food..hence the popularity)..  Barebecue'd meats, sugary sauce w/brocooli and some rice.   Yum.\n\nCoriander Thai food (see..Sorabol)...Some of the smells there though..yikes..putrid.\n\nand Buckhorn.   Buckhorn was the fast food version of an awesome steakhouse chain up in the Sacramento area.    The meats are still very good here, and if you want to sit and oogle the cute laguna beach patrons..you'll find them here.\n\nThe foods around the foodcourt are more upscale than a regular run of the mill foodcourt w/corndogs etc....but you also pay for the upscaling.  Meals are 10 dollars minimum (that's w/drinks included)..which people happily pay ..for the ambience.\n\nCheck out the center aisle's gelato shop.  The ice cream is displayed in giant rotund containers and neately pack into thimble sized cups for 3 bucks a pop.\n\nPricey mall food, pricey ambience, overly blatant patrons fronting to the extreme.   But hey..maybe that's what you want??\n\nIf you drop 800 bucks on a ready made suit in Bloomingdales, or get a 800 dollar handbag there...what's another 20-30 for lunch?", "author": "Michael L."}

Still love it now, though I had a really bad experience at Corriander - the Thai place.  After finished shooping and feeling tired I wanted to go home, but thought I'd stop by at Corriander.  This was probably my fourth time going there.  I got the usual Chicken Basil dish with rise, eggroll and Thai ice tea.  This time I decided to take it to go.  I couldn't wait to eat when I got home.  After few bites, I realized myself kept chewing, chewing and chewing but the thing I chewed I thought was chicken, it just wont break away in my mouth.  I was curious I spit it out and examined what I was chewing.....until...then I realized...it wasn't chicken...or bone...or plastic that maybe somehow got in the food...but what I was chewing was......\"A huge frieking french manicure fingernai!!!!!!!\"  I was grossed out, I felt sick right away and I threw up big time.  I was feeling sick with the thought that i was chewing a human being's fingernail....someone's fingernail....that maybe belong to the cook?   That was pretty DAMN GROSS!!  I was thinking going to them and tell them what I ate and that it was unacceptable, but it was always late in the night - around 9 pm, so I decided to just forget it and not think about it 'cause it makes me feel sick everytime the thought of me chewing someone else's fingernails makes me wanna throw up and I did many times.\nSo, from then on, I decided not to go to back to Corriander.  It's too bad because the food was good, but after that point on, I don't think I can ever eat there again -I just think that whoever it is the cook that prepare the food, they should probably wear gloves.

Maybe things have changed & I've not been around to the food courts & shopping malls lately, but I can't remember the last time I ate at a food court off of REAL plates, knives & forks, and was able to get a REAL glass of wine (served in a REAL wine glass)!  As for the quality of food, I haven't eaten at EVERY place there, but what I HAVE tried was more than passable (and a lot better than I'd expect from the setting).  I went to Coriander Thai, and had the mixed vegetables & spicy green beans with fried rice (...and got a glass of white wine from another establishment, which was also better than I would have expected).  I must confess, my food was tasty.  Usually, in such a pedestrian, mainstream sort of setting, you would expect spicy dishes to be really toned-down for the masses, but my spicy green beans were PROPERLY SPICY and tasty, and my mixed vegetables were about as good as one can expect for such a boring dish.  And I would say that it was reasonably priced, as I got a literal MOUNTAIN of food for about $10.  Much more than I could finish.  Beyond the food that I had, the options in this food court all look like food I could actually CONSIDER EATING, unlike most food courts, which offer crap after crap after crap.  So, I won't be making any special trips TO this food court, as I will always prefer to be in a proper restaurant setting, NOT surrounded by all the mainstream, bridge & tunnel peeps & screaming kids, but if I find myself in the area again, I do know that I at least have decent options available to me when I get hungry.", "author": "Eric H."}

However, the food court was definitely something I hadn't seen before. There are so many food options, and they are all differet from the usual food court choices. also, the food at many of the places are actually pretty damn good. the food comes in generous portions, and if you got me take out from this place , i would have never guessed it was from a mall food court/emporium. ive only tried the japanese and mexican options here. both were pretty good. but i love how the gelato/desserts and tea place looks.. also, they have a beard papa's! WOOHOO! (:\n\nalso, instead of waiting in line waiting to hear your number, each place gives you the flashing/vibrating pods that you get at restaurants. neat for a food court. also, there are people who bus your trays and items. good service. i just feel bad that the majority of the people working in this area are on the older side. \n\n\nif you're in SF and dont want to spend a lot of money at a restaurant, definitely visit this place. pretty cool.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

The new side of the mall is the more expensive , more gorumet , and nicer part of the food court . The older side is the cheaper part of the food court and has more fast food . Overall , there's a little something for everyone . There's sandwiches , pizza , pasta , burgers , soup , cream puffs , Korean , Japanese , Thai , pretzels , etc.  I like the food court on the newer side of the mall more . I haven't seen a food court inside a mall in the bay area that has more gourmet foods like the one in this Westfield does . Most food courts only have cheap fast food . I haven't seen one with so many options either . I almost forget that I'm in the food court sometimes !! Why ? Because they have people cleaning up after you like in a restaurant . Also .. on the newer side of the mall ,  you can get your drink  or food \" For here \" and they will give you a glass cup and plate instead of a to-go cup or to-go box .", "author": "Eileen L."}

I wade through the swarm of people on Market and make way to your unusually heavy doors and to your escalators.  The molded plywood chairs are just high enough so that I can watch the people roll in and around between the tables and alleys of the food stalls.  There are mall workers and business travelers and tourists and local software hotshots and of course the gorgeous women refueling between bouts of shopping.  I am breathless and hungry for the seafood, the soup, the Thai fare, even Buckhorn who teases me with big chunks of beef but not that Askew place and indulge every so often, and once too many times, in a shouting match with that person who just cut me in line.  Don't get between me and the food court you animal!  Did I mention the folks at Peet's Coffee (OEM) are superb at pulling shots and making that Americano just right and hot?  Go forth; indulge your senses and feed.", "author": "Iqbal Y."}
