Upon walking in to the almost silent bar, we were greeting by edgy and judgemental looking clientele, but the bar tender was very nice and helpful. They serve a good range of beers with something for every taste. Draft beers are $7 each and bottles range from $5-22. $10 minimum on cards though!\n\nThere is seating upstairs which is nice if you want to talk; however, the artwork looks like something you would dream of in a nightmare. Very, very odd. They also have some games (apples to apples, cards against humanity, etc) at the bar you can take upstairs. \n\nOverall I had a positive experience and went twice during my four day stay in San Fran.

He introduced me to higher quality beers than what you normally find at your typical bar or restaurant.  These beers are not the cheap college-drinking brew you pick up from 7-11 or Safeway and pound when you get home.  These are ones which provoke your palette like wine does. This is what Church Key is all about.\n\nA few to try out if you are not much of a beer drinker but are looking to explore:  Tripel Karmeliet (which was on tap when I last visited) is a sweet Belgian beer.  The Chocolate Cherry Stout is also a great choice for those who have a sweet tooth.  Church Key has a very extensive menu which is always changing.  \n\nThere's room upstairs to sit and hang out with your friends.  It's fairly low key and not very noisy so you can actually carry a conversation.  The only thing I don't like is that it last call is at 11:30pm.

But there are those rare occasions, and the few times I'd been there the beer selection and vibes were always enticing enough that I wanted to check it out on a more languid weekday with a few close friends.\n\nA friend's sister, visiting from the UK, was staying in a North Beach hostel with her boyfriend and thus I decided on Church Key for post-dinner drinks. We went on a Wednesday. We sat at the bar. The DJ was playing upbeat jazz and soul and it was a gooooood!\n\nI really like the vibe here when its somewhere between moderately mellow and almost loud to the point where you need to start raising your voice. It feels vibrant, yet still relaxing- perfect for mid-week. \n\nAs for the selection, well the beers on tap are rotating pints of perfection and they have a great book of bottled as well. \n\nEverything up to this point is good.... but don't expect the bar tender to help you figure that out. This is where Church Key looses some stars.\nSee, I only know a little bit about beer- such as: I like it!!! Other than that, I'm pretty clueless as to what's what save for that golden beers are light and dark ones are heavy, and that IPAs are from India and a stout will make you fat :) \n\nWhen I asked the bartender about a particular draft I've never had, the answer I got was \"well, it's a pale ale, soo... it's kinda light.\" Well, what do ya know? A beer with \"IPA\" in the name is a pale ale? Reaaallly??? I wanted to know about the flavor or whatever makes the beer interesting and work $12 a pint! The bartender told me I could have a taste or two of beverages I was curious about.  This only half makes up for the fact that in an establishment known for unique beers, the person serving them appears to know nothing. He also acted aloof and disinterested in taking care of patrons. Not really cool in a small little joint like this\n\nObviously this guy isn't the only bartender who works here. But still. \nI'm also knocking off a points because even though I am one of maybe a handful of people that knows Church Key offers a half off pint to anyone checking in there on Foursquare for the first time, Mr. Charisma behind the bar didn't offer me the deal after bringing it up and explaining how I forgot my phone at home. The one day!!! He didn't even seem slightly amused I knew they had a Foursquare deal. Dude?!? Just indulge my geekiness a little when you see me geeking out! You know?

I don't know what it is about them, but I love to be incognito for awhile and drink my libations in secret. The past few months, I have casually strolled past the Church Key on my way to Savoy Tivoli, or Grant and Green or Gino and Carlo's, or Golden Boy, or...well, you get the picture (this is my 'hood after all), and wondered what the heck it was! The outside is dark, the windows tinted and there isn't any other signage other than a mysterious key hanging over the door. I was dying to know what sort of secretive behaviour was happening behind those doors. Did I need a password? Or better yet, a special key?\n\nLuckily, my intrigue was put to rest last night when my date suggested we check it out for a beer. A-ha! So it's a bar...good to know! We arrived at 7pm, and the place was pretty empty, which was great for us because we could chat and hear one another. We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely knowledgable on their extensive beer list. I told him I usually drink Stella and wanted something similar. He quickly offered up a Hawaiian Beer that was called \"Blonde\"-something and had a picture of a hula girl on the front. I'm easy...sold! My date grabbed his favorite German lager and we happily talked and drank our frosty brews for the next hour. We joked around with the bartender and wanted to know what the word was for a beer sommalier. Brewlier? Beerologist? Anyone have answers??\n\nThe atmosphere is simple yet cozy and dark. I loved the lounge-y music and low lighting. It appears there is an upstairs loft area to get lost in, but we did not make our way up there. They also claim to have pub quiz on Tuesday nights, so I will have to come back and check it out.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to meet someone for a drink, especially if you are an adventurous beer drinker. I think it would be fun to have a large group here as well for some after-work shinanigans.", "author": "Lynsey C."}

This place is so friggin awesome.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do in SF is host networking mixers, and Church Key was one of the best ever.\n\nI'm a bit of a beer fan, so when I saw Lost Abbey's Serpent Stout on tap, I knew that we'd found the right place. Extremely knowledgeable bartenders, lots of rare ridiculousness, appropriate glassware and friendly folks.\n\nAlso, they had the Black Keys album on repeat. *WIN*!!!\n\nThe place is a little small, but it's cozy. Upstairs has a low ceiling, which, at first, was oppressive, but after a few beers, it kicked ass. One caveat, which doesn't matter so much during the winter months, but during the summer it gets hotter than a supermodel in a Microbikini. Like, literally uncomfortable. Other than that the setting is great.\n\nThey have a pretty quick rotation of kegs, and their website is inaccurate. Just go there, ask them what's best and drink away. You won't leave disappointed.\n\nTL;DR: AWESOME Beer bar, right up there with Toronado, but a little smaller.", "author": "Joshua G."}

I looooove beer, and this place has all of my favorites plus some that I have never seen before.  Tonight I had two different beers that were both fabulous and super high in alcohol content.  The first was a spiced beer called Midas Touch which I had never before seen, and the second was one of my old time favorites from Canada, La Fin du Monde.   The beers come to you in the appropriate glass for the type, which is so very cool.  Another reason why I love this place is because the menu tells you everything that you would ever need to know about the beers that they serve.  There is an alcohol content, origin, and description of flavor listed for each.  While the overwhelming amount of beers makes it hard to decide, the menu allows you to decide with some certainty that you will like it.  \n\nBesides all of the great beer that they serve, the Church Key has an ultra cool environment.

The boyfriend and I have each been in San Francisco for over 20 years so it takes some really egregious pricing to shock us but Church Key managed to do it. And in these extremely difficult economic times, I find their prices pretty offensive. \n\nWhat's sad is that the Church Key has the potential to be one of the most unique, enjoyable bars you could ever have the pleasure of being in.  As the other reviews note, the ambience is very chill:  great lighting, colors, very cozy, and music that adds to the experience but doesn't drown you out.  I never made it upstairs, but down below there is no TV, which is also an  added plus.  My boyfriend and I did not find the bartender particularly friendly, although he wasn't overtly rude, either.\n\nFor unusual beer selection, there are a plethora of choices such as City Beer, Healthy Spirits, and Toronado. Or head to Lanesplitters in Oakland, Barclay's in Rockridge, The Warehouse Cafe in Port Costa. While these places not might have the ambiance that Church Key has - their pricing is much more palatable. \n\nIf you really want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on beer, go to Mays Field and watch Tim Lincecum pitch, head to the Cliff House for the view, or go the the Top of the Mark for a styley time out.", "author": "EE C."}

I walked up to the bar tender who didn't seem very busy and politely tried to get his attention. \"Excuse me\", I said lightly and got no response from him.

He finally decided to make eye contact with me after the 3rd try. \"Is the bar closed?\" I asked and he shortly answered, \"Yes.\" That was okay, life goes on. As we're walking out, I noticed the bartender was saying something in my direction.

The space is tiny and intimate and I wouldn't recommend bringing a big group of people...it isn't that type of place. The beer menu is huge and seems intimidating at first, but it's broken down by variety. Just close your eyes and pick a random page. I can say the hibiscus beer and the coconut porter were delicious! Props to the owner...there was a douchebag, drunk and obviously trying to network him, sitting next to the bf and I. The owner kept drinking his PBR, not having it, without being a shit to him. When my guy from Indiana, slightly awed, asked him some questions about the bar, the owner was the nicest guy. We went back twice in one week.

I think the owner was bar tending when we first arrived, and he seemed eager enough to help us find a good beer we would enjoy.  But as the bar got busier and the bartender changed, we were more on our own to pick out our next beers.  \n\nThey have a mystery beer for $2, which this night was Miller High Life.  I can't believe people come to a bar like this for a MGD, but even the owner admitted he drinks them (especially when he needs to drive later).  \n\nAs far as prices, I can't complain because my tab was half what it should have been. Some guy kept putting our beers on his tab (and buying us wine) and wasn't even trying to hit on us!  \n\nThe music was picked by the bartender and played on a turn table.  Started out with Johnny Cash, but then switched to something I didn't recognize (or enjoy as much).  The atmosphere is dark, but friendly.  \n\nWe gave ourselves a 3 beer limit because from past experience, these beers typically leave us with bad hangovers and lead to poor decisions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-10", "description": "Church Key is a great name for a bar.  Unfortunately I'm not really into going to church these days.\n\nIt's always good to find another place that has a devotion to providing a good variety of interesting international and local beers to the masses.  I had two draft beers while here; Hacker-Psorr Helles and Allagash Black.  Both were delicious and I have tasted neither one before.  There were a few other options available in addition to a healthy selection of bottles.\n\nUnfortunately i have to give the three stars based solely on those pluses.  The bar area is awkward; if you're not sitting at the actual bar, you're in a weird position because the one bathroom is at the end of the walk space behind the bar seats.  So it's nice to be close to the bar but be ready to move a lot.  Other than that the rest of the place looks like a cheap lounge not to mention there was an insanely overpowering smell of bleach emanating through the place.  The candle light was a little cheesy and the place definitely doesn't have the feel of your average beer bar (maybe that's a good thing for some people?).  The prices on some of the bottles were a little ridiculous too.  I know that the Schneider-Brooklyn Brewery collaboration brew called Hopfen Weiss is somewhat limited, but i thought it was ridiculous to see it going for $16 a bottle when I've seen it for $8 at other places.  It kind of makes me think the place cares more about seducing chumps too drunk to know better (well, it is North Beach) than actually sharing a love of beer with the rest of us.\n\nThe one saving grace is that while I choose to mostly dodge North Beach, if you want to meet in a bar somewhere in the area, I would make it be this one.  The place wasn't packed like a sardine tin and the clientele seem to be mostly enjoying themselves at a moderate pace instead of trying to get completely obliterated.  Just don't try to get me back across Green St. now...", "author": "Steven R."}

It's a very specific niche that they are going for, and it works incredibly well. Go to this bar if you want one thing, and one thing only: a really unusual beer that you can't get anywhere else.  If you are the kind of person that likes to talk about the subtleties of a beer for ten minutes, then this is your heaven. I must say that I am not that kind of person, but after drinking two of the beers, which had 9% alcohol content, I was happily drunk and ready to spend the rest of my life here.  This place is great.

My fiance brought me here on a date and I had this deeeeeelicious beer called the Duchess de Bourgeone. It tastes like...well, I can't entirely describe it, but, it's tasty as all get out! My man had this coconut flavored ale, which I stole a sip of and that one was amazing too. The mood everytime i go in is way relaxed and the locals are friendly. Plus the beers are all reasonably priced.  If you want to try some great beers at great prices, give this place the old college try.

WOW.  trust me, the taste of this beer (i think it was an IPA) was even better than its name.  denogginizer.  love it. \n\nbeers on tap range in price from $6 to at least $10.  seems like they have an even bigger selection of bottled beer, but that is something i'll have to check out next time.  the place is small and a bit uppity for a bar, in my opinion.  looks too \"loungy\", and space is small and there aren't too many places to sit.  not good for big groups.  \n\nladies, the guy-to-girl ratio at this place works in your favor.  i went with my two friends, one guy and one girl.  my female friend and i were the only females on the first floor, in the midst of approximately 15 men scattered about.  just an observation...", "author": "Christy I."}

It's perfect for when you're in the mood to drink a couple of beers and unwind with friends, but aren't really up to Going Out and stumbling your way back home in the wee hours of the morning (a different yelp review for another time). I usually come here when I want to grab a drink or two with a friend or a small group of people, but wouldn't really recommend going here if you're with a large group because it isn't huge and seating is somewhat limited. The beer list is LONG, so if you plan to come here with someone who \"doesn't like beer\" there is probably something on the menu even for these foolish people. The bartenders also let you sample the beers on draft, which helps you avoid the disappointment that comes with spending $9 on a beer you thought you would like but actually makes you want to gag. Ok, I haven't actually had a beer that makes me feel like that, but I could imagine. The bartenders I've encountered here have been pretty knowledgeable and helpful, so I've only gotten good suggestions so far. I just came here again this past weekend when a friend was in town, and he was both impressed by the local feel of the place and happy to see an obscure beer he loves on the menu (which made me look cool). It is definitely worth trying sometime!", "author": "Caroline T."}

Don't go to Church Key.  There are half a dozen not too shabby wines available, but you come here for beer.  That's OK, though, because the beer is amazing.  They have eight or so brews on tap, and at least thirty or forty more bottled from all around the world.  The list changes somewhat every two weeks or so, and covers more styles than I even knew existed.  The menus give great descriptions and inform your choices, the bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly, and funny (with great tattoos!) and the ambiance is great (if you like dark cozy places.)
