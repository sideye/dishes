The burritos were really big and had generous amounts of meat. The a la diabla was amazing! Huge shrimp and lots of them. Caution it is a little soupier, saucy on the inside, but the flavors and spice were amazing. It all came with a side of sour cream and guacamole which was cool. Only negative was that the chips were an extra $1. Will definitely be trying this place again.", "author": "Jeanette H."}

The order was initially for 2 caldo de res (beef soup). The delivery guy delivered our food and immediately stated that the restaurant had told him they had already \"called and spoke with the customer.\" \n\nIndeed, the restaurant did call me to say they only had enough caldo de res to fulfill one order, not the two orders I had placed. They had chicken the girl said. I asked if they had menudo. No. So I confirmed one order of caldo de res and one order of caldo de pollo.\n\nInstead, what I got was one caldo de res and one taco. The delivery man offered to go back to the restaurant if we called the restaurant and asked them to make another soup order. The delivery guy even called the restaurant on his own phone. When asked if they could make a caldo de pollo for him to pick up, the woman refused (a different woman than the one who called me), saying that Grubhub would charge the restaurant for another delivery. The woman then asked us to hang up with the driver's phone, stated she had to clear it with her boss first, and would call me back on my cellphone. I immediately called Grubhub customer service on my phone, while the delivery guy continued to wait to see if he needed to go back to the restaurant. \n\nGrubhub CS spoke to the driver when I told them the driver was still waiting, then put me on hold and called the restaurant. A few minutes later, CS came back onto the phone with me, telling me that the \"boss\" outright refused to call (get on the phone with?) Eat24 or Grubhub to make the order right. Not sure if they got this information from the woman I was dealing with, the same one who stated she had to get the OK from the boss. Both Grubhub CS and the delivery driver stated the restaurants claim that they would be charged again for delivery was false. \n\nAfter the 15 minute fiasco, Grubhub CS opted to refund me for the one missing soup order, and told me to tell the delivery guy that he could leave to finish his other deliveries. Grubhub CS also stated he was quite disappointed in the restaurant, and apologized to both me and the driver for the inconvenience. I asked Grubhub CS if there was a way of flagging the restaurant for other customers to know of the shady business practice, or at a minimum, the outright refusal to remedy the situation (offer the refund yourself! Or offer a dish at the equivalent price! DON'T refuse to get on the phone to fix the problem!) at which time CS stated I should leave a review for future customers to be informed of the bad experience, thus this review.\n\nShortly after I hung up with Grubhib CS, the woman at the restaurant called me back, saying Grubhub refunded my order. I'm not sure if she called to finally make it right, or was calling to protest the refund, but the way she was speaking sounding as though a protest was going to be made. I informed her she could take it up with Grubhub. She made a pffft and hung up.\n\nThe taquiera is completely unprofessional and unethical. My apologies to the poor driver who had to wait, and for any fellow Eat24/Grubhub customers' orders that may have been delayed as a result of this restuarant's unprofessionalism.", "author": "N M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-05-04", "description": "Poor me, right?  It takes a lot to make me write a bad review, because any bad press drives down business.  The last thing a long established Mom and Pop owned kind of place needs is negative feedback, but after many years of getting food at Blue Iguana, my overall experience can only be called negative.  Worst of all, it's because they're socially disconnected. If it was just the food, I might not even bother to write a review. \n\nI used to work in the neighborhood and get food there after a long day of driving, and I'm still in the area several times a week.  Good thing El Pollo Supremo is right around the corner, I say.  They're the opposite: almost always good. \n\nIguana Azul started out good.  This was probably 15 years ago.  Then it was like they changed owners or something, or stopped caring about who they hired.  Over time I saw cooks who clearly didn't care about what they were doing.  Cashiers were almost always friendly, polite and even attractive ladies, but the food got worse and worse. \n\nWhen before the burritos used to be fresh, not sloppy and poorly put together, the last three times I have gone over a stretch of 3-4 months, but also long before that, I got probably the worst burritos I've ever had, and I was born and raised in the city.  I have had the best burritos and Mexican food, and at Blue Iguana, now I have had the worst.  Undercooked chicken?  Over cooked?  Scrap meat and grease piled from the grill?  Tons of water in the salsa?  Old ass guac?  Way too hot?  Torn flour tortillas and you still shoved a burrito together?  Check all of the above.  \n\nBut even worse, and likely related to all of the above?  Yeah, I'm gonna go there: the gringo treatment... when the cook sees who he's making it for and does the worst job he can, on purpose. Yeah, I'm a white guy.  Yeah, white privilege is a thing, especially in San Francisco (only since tech culture came up), but I'm not that guy.  I'm not one of the guys guiltily pretending to fit in and dressing down like I could be from here and I didn't out earn for your apartment, which magically became a condo. I'm a blue collar worker who has worked with people of every background and kind  for many years.  You think I don't know it when I see it?  I don't like the way white privilege is shaking down in the city or the Bay Area either, but I'm not going to take it out on you because you look like one of them.  Why did this restaurant?  Somebody wasn't paying attention to the character of the people they hired, or if they did, they took a wrong turn somewhere themselves.  \n\nSo I ban myself from Blue Iguana, boycott them by telling my friends why they should pass and now I have made my voice heard more publicly.  I hope you will take this into consideration before you pay them a visit.  My mistake was going back when the food kept getting worse and worse... for what?  No reason?  You can't fool me.

It's good, but I don't think the delay in time is fully reflected in the final dish.\n\n2) The wrapping fell apart halfway through. For the time they take to make things I thought the wrapping would be better. It was a long burrito and maybe it should have been shorter and fatter because at a certain point i took a bite and both ends opened up. that's a burrito wrapping faux pas my Iguana friends.\n\nThe wrapping and not as quick as usual burrito making bumped it down for me. I also had a stomach ache after I ate here but I am not sure if it was what I Drank which I did not puchase here or the burrito or a mix. \n\nI read an earlier review about cash only. They do take CREDIT CARD now.

Know what you want before you step up to the counter and for God's sake people, the regular burrito does not come with cheese. Just like it says on the menu: rice, beans, salsa and choice of meat. You want cheese? Ask for it. Or better yet, get out of line and go to Taco Bell.\n\nI've had the carne asada, chicken, but never been brave enough for the carnitas (deep fried pork). I usually pop in here around 10:00 p.m. and at that time of day the meat is usually a little dry and pretty salty. I have a high tolerance for salt so I love it, but friends have said it's too much. The guacamole is good and freshly made, but be warned, towards the end of the night they sometimes run out.\n\nGood late night meal: One Regular Burrito with chicken, rice, black beans, and spicy salsa; one Tamarind soda; chips and a side of guacamole.

The meat is dry and chewy. although if you do decide to go there becuase you're starving and can't go anywhere else make sure you try the green salsa. it is the best! so for that i'll give them 2 stars! :o)", "author": "Jessica S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-21", "description": "Huge gigantic burrito, about 3 pounds, one of the biggest in town and big screen sports. Good if you are hungry and want to watch baseball and listen to loud mexican music on the jukebox simultaneously. One of my favorite things to do. Good if you are looking for a filling average tasting burrito, not so good if you are looking for a better tasting burrito. Closest \"better tasting\" burrito to this place is Taqueria Guadalajara at the corner of Mission and Onondaga, three blocks down Mission. They have big screen soccer and a fantastic tasting 2 pound super beef  burrito. But no baseball.", "author": "mark g."}

Well most of the time they are.  I always used to get the super grilled chicken burrito with everything, but then my sister in law got the burrito mojado ( a burrito covered in enchilada sauce) and i love that too.  But  i like to hold my burrito in my hands and eat it, rather than cut it up with a knife and fork.  SOmething just isnt right about that.....Anyhow, THEN i decided to try the chicken quesadilla, and omg, there is nothing better than a flour grilled tortilla with massive amounts of cheese, lots of chicken, and guacamole and sour cream.....too bad i am lactose intolerant, and eating it all made my stomach cramp up like i just ate a piece of raw chicken by accident, but the stomach pains were well worth the cheesy goodness of a quesadilla.  Oh and they give you tortilla chips  and theres a regular salsa bar with your standard salsas as well.  I like this place and i like to tell my friends and coworkers about it.", "author": "Janet R."}
