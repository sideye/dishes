The chinese donuts that we were served weren't crispy at all, they should find somebody new to source their chinese donuts from because those were some of the worst donuts i've had, they were too doughy and dense to be. These weren't it. \n\nBesides that, the waygu beef, the lamb is what we really kept ordering along with some of the seafood options like the fishcakes filled with roe, imitation crab, and more. Also, I was glad with the decisions to go with the combination of the spicy and tom yum broths.I'd come back and do it all again minus the mediore chinese donuts. The interior could use some work, I felt like I was eating out of a warehouse that they just decided to set up shop in the day of. It could use some kind of decor, lots of potential though!

I've been here many times and I've always left happy and satisfied.\n\nWhenever I come here I always order the pork bone broth and a spicy broth - I usually get the Tom Yum or the spicy miso, but I actually never end up eating from the spicy side of the pot. I also always order the signature Wagyu and prime beef - I find their meat quality really good and goes really well with the broths I've tried. I've tried all their other meats as well, and they are all of really good quality as well, but the other meats aren't my favorite. I love that this place also has my favorite hot pot staples as well - always go for the pea sprouts, Chinese donut, and bean curd sticks! I'm also a fan of their sauce bar as well - there's hella stuff to choose from and you can customize your sauce to how you like it! \n\nThe staff is also really nice and attentive, and their usually on top refilling drinks and getting your order out. Sometimes stuff is forgotten though, but it happens quite a bit at hot pot places especially when you're ordering in large amounts. \n\nHighly recommend this spot if you're craving hot pot!", "author": "Stacey Y."}

She sat us down immediately and we didn't have to wait that long. We had the AYCE and the soup was yummy we were separated into 2 different tables and got Spicy Tom Yum, Pork Bone, Chinese Herbal & Vietnamese Pho, my goodness the Spicy Tom Yum was on point! We had a variety of seafood, dumplings and meats to chose from. Jacqueline was helpful to our table as most of us had never hot pot before and she explained the process on how we should eat the food. She recommended us to start with beef first prior to having lamb since it would change the soup flavor and we took her advice on it, she was right! Every time we were low on water or broth she would come in to our table and refill it. Thank you so much for being so attentive to us and patient. \n\nWill definitely come back!", "author": "Yenni H."}

Simmer has become one of my favorite hot pot places in the sunset. For one, their soup bases are very flavorful. I love spicy food. The spicy mala is my favorite. A lot of restaurants have \"spicy\" soup bases when in reality the spicy level is like a 3/10. Simmer adds in (I think they said) thai chili peppers, which is a great idea. \n\nTheir wagyu beef is the best. That's all you need to order. The meat is all good, but the best is the wagyu. \n\nTo avoid the line, go around 6PM. No later than 6:30 or else you have to wait. August- weekday at 7, 45 minute wait. September- Friday at 6, no wait. \n\nOne thing I noticed from my August visit that was similar to my first visit is the servers seem to wait for 2,3,4 etc tables to clear out and then seat everyone all at once. I don't really like that because if I'm waiting for that long and next in line, I just want to be seated.", "author": "Darlene T."}

Doesn't matter if it's makeup foundation, foundation for a house/building, or for food (I.e. bread for sandwich or broth for hot pot).  That's one fear I always have when I try a new hot pot place.  Okay and the second fear is that I don't get my money's worth. I ate a super light avocado toast lunch, while he unfortunately had a big lunch and breakfast.  Fail hubs, fail!  We use to go to Simmer when it was Hot Pot Garden.  That closed down after a kitchen fire.  \n\nWe went on an early Friday night last month for my husband's low key birthday.  I didn't know what the wait situation would be, so we went early.  In fact we got lucky with parking right in front and had to wait the 5 minutes before they opened at 5.  I'm not sure if it just happened to be, but they didn't really start to get busy until around 6:30 or later.  \n\nFor the summer they offered discounted AYCE only (not AYCD which is fine cuz we can't do that), I believe it was only $25ish.  Standard 90 minute time limit, and subject to an added fee if you don't finish your food.  They don't charge extra for split broths, they ask you what two broths you want, and in fact I think their pots already have the dividers built in. We went with the spicy miso and Vietnamese pho broths.  Let me tell you, the Vietnamese pho broth was SO SO DAMN GOOD.  Like for real, it's probably the best pho broth I've ever had in my life.  I hope one of the owners also has or will consider opening a pho restaurant, because then I'd actually go back to having pho tai (it's been years seriously).  The spicy miso was pretty standard and had a good kick.  Great to have the contrast but for the next trip out we'll probably just ask for all pho.  \n\nWe ended up getting many of our usuals - waygu beef, pork belly, spinach, dumplings, spam, hot link, soft tofu, Chinese donut, ramen.  These are good old reliables and you can't ever really go wrong.  The Chinese donut was very hard tho so definitely had to make sure it got a thorough broth soaking.  The wagyu for the most part was good quality but I bit into one piece that may have had a small bone or something.  Otherwise though, same great quality.  And I think Simmer has a few more meat options.  We're pretty simple with hot pot though especially since we don't eat too much seafood.  \nWe use to be able to eat so much.  Sadly we only had two shared plates of meat (2 rounds of refills of items).  I guess it's really true about what they say when you hit the big 3-0.  \n\n\nPluses over their predecessor, HPG: custom sauce station, and that pho broth!  Service was friendly but was a bit more attentive during the HPG days.  4.5 stars rounded up due to the two big pluses!  :). We'll be back.", "author": "Cat C."}

I was curious if I misunderstand server's meaning. She never check and ask if we need more soup when our soup was almost gone. She did not tell us some of food (mussel & octopus) we ordered was out of stock. We waited hella long time and asked her, and she told us have none of them. Ok.... but few mins after, we saw other table have octopus, so we asked other server to confirm. Other server told us they do have. Restaurant is not busy as I thought she might busy with other stuff. She did not do anything as she supposed to do when she is a server, just talked with her frd or someone else. I don't feel like she deserve any tips tbh. \n\nSo this is all you can eat, but there are not many choices we can choose. Soup base is so salty, and become more salty at the end.

We used to do monthly dinners, but time got away from us and we realized it had been over a year since our last get together. Since hot pot was our thing, we decided to check out Simmer on Friday, July 6th around 6:30pm. I got here first, but they require the whole party present to be seated. It wasn't very busy, so once my gf showed up, they sat us.\n\nAll-You-Can-Eat: Adults $24.99 per person x2\n*90 Minute Time Limit\n*Choose Up to 2 Soup Bases: Spicy Mala, Pork Bone\n*Meat (choose up to 4 items at a time): Signature Wagyu x3, Prime Beef\n*Vegatables (most items are seasonal and portioned to party size): Beech Mushroom, Enoki, Mushroom, Napa x2, Pea Sprouts, Puff Tofu, Spinach, Sweet Corn, Tofu Skin Roll, Winter Melon\n*Balls / Dumplings (5 pieces in each order): Fish Ball w/Roe, Lobster Balls\n*Rice, Noodle and Misc: Vermicelli\n\nWe toyed with doing the All You Can Eat & Drink for $37.99. (Everyone must order AYCED.) But since we're older and not drinking as much, we just got Hot Sake ($6) x2 on top of the AYCE. Ended up being the better choice as we went to another spot afterwards to drink some more.\n\nIt had been a while since I had hotpot, so this definitely satisfied that craving. Both broths were good. The mala had a nice spice and the pork, a good meatiness. Out of the two proteins I liked the wagyu better. Fattier, so more tender. I adore pea sprouts, so I'm glad they offered them here. I completely missed the tripe (one of my favorite dishes) as it was in the meat section. (Normally, I think it's elsewhere on the menu?) Totally my fault, but disappointing when I realized it while recapping our order for this review. Their menu is not as diverse as some other spots, but everything was avail except their Kimchi and Tong Ho, so still a good amount of variety. Make sure to hit the sauce bar before digging in. I made my sauce with garlic, cilantro, green onions, jalapeno, house ponzu, hot sauce, and an egg yolk.\n\nI used to go to Hot Pot Garden all the time, so I'm glad Simmer took their spot.

One of the biggest things I noticed while waiting is that there are no small tables, the entire restaurant is pretty much set up for large format - so if you think you'll wait less just because you're a smaller party, it's not happening. They also have a bar area and this large rectangular table, neither of which have hot plates installed but which I think would actually be great for smaller parties if they ever add hot plates there. Currently, the rectangular table is just a sitting area for those waiting. \n\nAs for the food, I was actually quite impressed with the quality of the meats as well as the variety of veggies available. I also really liked how they also had fresh ramen as an option. As for the broths, we tried pork bone and pho broth and both were really tasty!

We walked into a restaurant that smelled like cleaning solution, and that was not pleasant, but thankfully the smell was soon replaced with that of food. We had a party of 8 and were seated when everyone arrived, as sitting at a table automatically starts the 90 minute time limit. Our waitress was Emberly and she was wonderful - super friendly, energetic, attentive, and quick to bring us whatever we needed. She even asked if we preferred to watch something else on the TV next to us. Side note - Emberly, your hair color is pretty awesome.\n\nFor soup bases, we chose spicy Mongolian, spicy tom yum, Chinese herbal, and pork bone. The spicy options are decently spicy, but the spicy tom yum had a lot of oil in it. There is a great variety of foods to order. Meats here are of great quality, and the group favorites were the wagyu and the prime. The Chinese sausage was surprisingly good and was recommended to us by Emberly. The baby in our party loved the fish tofu. The fish ball with roe was very good here, and the fresh ramen was popular in our group (just be careful because it can burn at the bottom of the pot and ruin the broth taste - we were already given a heads up by Emberly, but we still didn't watch it closely enough - good thing this only happened to us at the end!). There's a sauce station in the corner and I had a grand 'ol time concocting something like I was a lab scientist...four times.\n\nMy go-to AYCE hot pot restaurant in SF has previously been Grand Hot Pot Lounge, which is slightly cheaper, gives unlimited drinks, and has cooked food options on the menu.

Honestly, I think that's the best way to go - especially with a bunch of small parties waiting. Each table allows 3 pots so sharing tables isn't an issue. Our orders didn't get mixed up or anything. They were super on top of it.\n\nOnce we got seated, our waitress was super clear about the way it all works. It's AYCE for $28/person and you get 90 minutes.

I probably wouldn't do Brisket and Kurobuta Pork again - but just to make room for more Wagyu and Prime Beef.

It was my first time last weekend and had a pretty fulfilling experience. \n\nPros:\n-quite an expansive menu, a good variety of veggies, meats, misc. items\n-all you can eat hot pot (90 min limit)\n-8 tv screens to watch any sports game lol\n-wagyu beef is their signature meat dish, marbling is amazing \n-service is attentive and fast\n-DIY sauce bar\n-dry erase menu\n\nCons:\n-depending on your party, it can be a long wait. it was just me and my bf and we did wait about 15 min. There were empty tables, just weren't cleaned yet\n\nWe tried the winter melon and the bone broth. I really liked the bone broth as it was flavorful and added an extra dimension to the udon and veggies. For the most part, we received everything we marked down on the dry erase menu, but I think they confused an item with the one above it. We wanted \"A Choy\" but ended up getting \"bamboo\" instead. We didn't say anything though because we actually enjoyed the bamboo. My bf and I will eat just about anything and everything. LOL So we just marked \"A Choy\" one more time. Anyway, I'd come back and try different broths. Their wagyu is realllly top quality and definitely worth trying.

The spicy tomyum and the pho broths were the most flavorful to me, didn't even need to dip in sauce for these two! The mala and pork bone were a bit bland and lacking flavor. \n\nThe variety and quality are good, only downside is only being able to order 4 meat plates at a time for a large table.

Sunset doesn't make it easy choosing where to eat with all the different hot pot places available but Simmer is definitely a solid choice.  \n\nFor a Wednesday night, the tables were full but no worries.  There's a decent amount of waiting space available. You can head over at the bar for a drink as you wait.  My table of 4 was seated within 15 minutes.\n\nOur server Jackie was excellent and recommended the spicy mala soup base which was amazing.  Probably not for those that aren't able to handle spicy but for those who can, GET THE SPICY MALA! There is a separate station where you can mix your own dipping sauce as well.  The meat and veggies came out fast and were all fresh and presentable.  I love the fact that they serve fresh ramen other than generic instant ramen.  The wagyu had a nice amount of marbling.  I could probably eat it for days (definitely worth starving myself all day for).\n\nI was very impressed with the service.  Both Jackie and Diana frequently checked up on our table and was very attentive.  They even recommended different items for us to try out without being asked.  They made sure we always had food coming, water to drink, and broth in our pots.  The food was great but whenever the service goes above and beyond, it makes the dining experience so much better.

Wow the wagyu is the bomb! The rib eye is also good. The lamb and pork just ok. The broth is pretty good but not wow. Well my spicy mala is good. The sauce option is ok too but the sesame sauce still not as good as mama's hot pot. The service is ok and the one thing I rarely see or happen is when they tell us our 90 min is up. I understand all hotpot give you 90 min to eat but I have never experienced them actually giving us last call on meat plus it was not pack or busy too at lease let it slide. Minus a star . Anyway the wagyu beef was really good and consistent with each additional order. Usually some places after the first good order they knowingly give you the frozen no good so call wagyu after. 3.5 Star which is all for the wagyu. The wagyu meat even better than Shabu club and shabu shabu but I like the service at those places better. Hopefully simmer isn't hit or miss on the meat. I'll prob give them another try to see the consistency. \n\nOverall come here just for the wagyu and don't expect to much on the other food and service edobase off previous review. I'll come here just for the wagyu.", "author": "Christy V."}

About 8pm on a Sunday night, during what I would imagine is a fairly slow time for the restaurant, we walked in excited to try some new hot pot. There were a decent number of people sitting down, but the place was by no means full. Immediately when we walked in, we were hit with a strong odor of cleaning supplies and seafood. I would have expected to smell the delicious aroma of cooking soup! We were the only people in the \"waiting area\" and just stood near the signup sheet waiting for someone to come greet us or acknowledge us. At least 2 waitresses saw us, but did not come over. I decided to put our name on the sheet, even though no one else was around and it seemed like there were open tables, or at least tables that were just clearing up. \n\nSo we waited. After at least 5 to 10 minutes of being ignored, finally someone came over to us and asked how many in our party. They checked our signup on the sheet, and told us there was another party ahead of us (nowhere to be seen) and that the wait was going to be 25 minutes more! We walked out, and thought about coming back in 25 minutes, until we found another hot pot place down the road where we had a lovely dinner and great service.", "author": "John W."}

We came on a Sunday night around 8pm and only waited about 5-10 minutes. \n\nWe chose the Vietnamese broth and the spicy miso. I can't handle too spicy so the spicy miso was a bit spicy to me if you just drink the soup. It's spicier than other spicy miso broths I've had at the other hot pot places. The Vietnamese broth was very bland, but eventually tasted better after adding all the meat and stuff in there. We ordered the usual - meat, fish balls with roe, veggies, imitation crab, enoki, tripe etc. basically everything you would usually see on a ayce hot pot menu. Everything was pretty fresh and the fish balls were filled with lots of roe which is pretty good. I really like how they give small portions so that we can get different things on the menu and then just order more instead of struggling with a large plate of everything. They also have American wagyu beef which is pretty nice. We also ordered strawberry soju cocktail $10 and a draft Sapporo for $6. The soju cocktail came in a small container but it was pretty good with strawberry seeds in it - made with fresh fruit? \n\nThe sauces were really good as well. They have a sauce bar so you can get creative and mix things together and customize your sauce to your liking. I really enjoyed the house ponzu sauce with garlic, chili oil and cilantro and green onion. The ponzu sauce is better than other places in my opinion and has a unique taste to it. The sesame sauce with added chili oil was really good as well. It's not like the usual peanuty darkish kind of sesame sauce at other places, it was a light color and kind of sweet which interestingly went well with the items we ordered. \n\nThe service was pretty good as well, but it might because we came when it wasn't too busy. The waitresses were attentive and checked on us and added more broth for us without us having to ask for it which was nice.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed everything and would come back.

It was strange to me since they were having someone prepare new meats. Honestly, the first time I went, I was kinda surprised that it was better meats than what we usually get for ayce hot pot.\n\nAnyways, they have a lot of veggie options that my parents really like.

They give you a dry erase menu when you sit down and you can just check off what you want to order.\n\nSimmer is your standard AYCE hot pot joint, with familiar choices like beef, pork, lamb, however they have some goood wagyu! That was definitely my favorite meat, and my favorite sides were the fish tofu (always a staple), and the fish ball with roe. This was the first time I had the fish ball with roe and I fell in love lol. Luckily it's AYCE so you can eat and order to your heart's desire! Also loved the tofu rolls, bean curd stick, and of course some leafy greens to balance out the meal. I like that they have a sauce bar because the previous HPG only had one sauce. I chose the house ponzu, added some garlic, sesame oil, satay sauce, and topped it off with a ton of green onions. I also liked the sesame sauce because it was reminiscent of the sauce at Shabu House! I even tried the raw egg as a dipping sauce for the meat (tip: cook your meat in the hot soup, then in the egg, then pop it in your mouth!); it made the bite creamier and added extra dimension!\n\nSimmer is a good choice for big parties because you can try a bunch of items.

They were fresh tasting, clean, and delicious. I wanted to eat more shrimp but we somehow got sooo full before I could even finish my first order.\n\nService is great too! Our waitress was really sweet and made a bunch of great recommendations. The fish ball with roe and HK dumplings she recommended were some of our favorite things on the menu.\n\nOverall, great food and service in a chill space.

HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! \nYou know, I don't know why this place even have 4 stars. For the price of $27.99/adult, the menu is extremely limited, not much variety of choices and the waitress will tell you last call before the 90 mins mark. (basically trying to get you the hell outta there ASAP.) \n\nSauce Bar**\nThe sauce bar wasn't that great, it was mediocre. Their sauce is all SWEET.  Even House Soy Sauce!  Why?  Well,  because Sweet stuff will fill you up quicker versus Salty Sauce.  YES ITS TRUE.  \n\n Told the waitress that there was no more satay sauce and took them 15 mins to refill ( it wasn't even a busy night, there was plenty of empty tables) so I don't know why they couldn't refill it. Probably was busy talking shit about another table. Oh yeah... overheard em' talking about \" Table 15... was hella annoying\". OU...Girl... you do not say that while walking pass customers at other tables. That's attitude right there. Remember.... you are in Hospitality. \n\nService**\nhaha... SLOW..... This girl who served us, kept on turning our pot high and low.. like... seriously... we can probably do it ourselves??? like... just tell us... we ain't stupid, we been to other hotpot places. Besides, she never smiled one bit. NOT ONE!! idk.. if she was in a bad mood or she just hates her job!! Another story...My sister under 10 years old... They had the audacity to come and ask my sister questions about her age.. OMG are you serious?? Just because she's tall/looks mature doesn't mean she's over 10 years old. It's your choice if you want more tips or not with your rude service. \n\n\n\nThe MEAL***\nThe broth wasn't great... \n5 stars for the American Wagyu Beef ONLY! \nPlease do not get the pumpkin! They cooked it in the kitchen and when it came out, it was all soggy and taste like it's been there forever... GROSS!\nThe KIMCHI... yes... fucking kimchi!!! I can tell by putting it in my mouth that it's from those Korean Market where they sell kimchi in gallons. The taste was terrible. I mean, why do you guys even serve it ??! LOL\nSoda is $2... NO REFILL... if you wanna do good business, let customers get refills! So they get full quicker... idiots. \n\nOverall****\nThe place was big enough not to be cramped with other tables. There are better AYCE HotPot Places in San Francisco or in general around Sunset district. It's just that nothing stood out, and for the price, it's not worth it. Management should rethink their menu and include dessert afterwards. Many other places have dessert afterwards.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "I came here one evening with my husband and we have been familiar with this location since when it was still Hot Pot Garden (prior to the fire that burned the place down). They did a really great job remodeling it, and I really wanted to like it as much as I loved HPG before but...\n\nFirst of all it smelled strongly of bleach when entering. Not exactly appetizing, but I figured it was because of the fresh remodel, and hey, at least we know the facilities are clean right?\n\nSo we continue on to our dinner service, but we quickly found their ordering style is really not well suited for a table of two. My husband and I like a variety of things so we ordered things we liked such as mushrooms and veggies in addition to meats. When everything came, each item came in unexpectedly huge portions. We ordered some items like fish tofu, enoki, etc. but got enough for a table of 4+ people for each of these items. Since obviously we don't like to waste food, it meant we had little stomach room at the end for more meats. And on top of it all, they got one of our orders wrong and we got some sort of mystery fish instead of squid.\n\nAs for the price, it's typical for AYCE, but soda you have to pay extra. However, in comparison, my favorite AYCE hot pot spot a few blocks down from here is cheaper per person AND includes free soft drinks and dessert... and portions are much more reasonable for the veggies and meat quality is just as good. I feel like Simmer is still an OK spot, but for me it's not the same as HPG was before (great bang for your buck and excellent quality). I will say though, the quality of food is still good, and if you come here with a big party, you'll probably have a much better time than we did.

(See attached photo). I asked someone behind the counter (who was incidentally glued to her smartphone) to kindly refill. I was met with a cold reluctant look - it was clear I was an inconvenience. She asked me what I needed, I told her sesame sauce. She went into the kitchen and brought out sesame oil. I repeated the part about sesame *sauce*, she then puttered around, looked under the condiment station and declared they were out of sesame sauce (???!!!). I thought that was odd: How could a self-respecting hot pot place be out of something so basic as sesame sauce? Not to mention that when you have only ONE sauce station, it should be refilled constantly and no one should see the bottom of the container. But they were out of literally everything except a bit of soy sauce and some jalape\u00f1os. Two containers each of cilantro and spring onions were empty - it was obvious no one had bothered to restock at all. I was so shocked and flabbergasted; Should I be content with dipping my bland pieces of boiled meat in some soy sauce and sesame oil? I had waited for a table for 1.5 hours for a table I was too committed at that point to just leave. I then saw my waitress and asked her why there wasn't any sesame sauce. Consequently, a whole bunch of people started running around with no resolution. I decided to return to my table, and saw that a long line had formed behind me waiting for sauces. 20 minutes must have gone by and my waitress came to tell me that they found some sesame sauce and that the condiment station has been refilled! Woo hoo! But I had already been eating bland boiled meat for 20 mins and wasted 10 mins trying to get someone to restock the condiment bar. I understand this place has been open for only few months, but this can't be an isolated incident? Or has no one complained?\n\nAnyway, operational problems aside, this place was just OK. I don't mind that they carry a limited number of choices with regards to broths/items/condiments, but nothing stood out. I would frequent this place if I lived within walking distance, but it would not be a place I go out of my way for, particularly with the plethora of choices for AYCE hot pot restaurants in the Bay Area. I hope the management takes the feedback and works out the kinks - I wish all local businesses the best. But Yelpers owe it to each other to submit honest reviews - good, bad and ugly.

Luckily we only waited for 40 mind and not an hour. Pretty standard rules like $28 AYCE 90 min limit. Customer service was great our waitress was friendly and efficient. There's a sauce bar in the back where you can mix different sauce together. For the soup base we did half/half we chose spicy mala and pork broth. We chose lots of veggies like A choy, watercress, Napa cabbage, and enoki mushroom. All of them were really fresh. As for meat we got wagyu, prime beef, lamb, and pork. Surprisingly the prime beef was way better than wagyu. We thought the wagyu was a little hard. Maybe it was just us but I was a little disappointed. Bill total was $128 for 4 ppl Ayce. It's an okay place for hot pot but I wouldn't return. My favorite hot pot place is still little Mongolian sheep!!", "author": "Tina C."}

Meat was fresh and delicious, except for the chicken, served in big chunks. It should have been sliced a little bit more. You can order up to 4 meats on the table. It's unusual that they serve you the meat BEFORE serving all veggies. You can also make your own sauce. Minus for the sauce area which is not that great. Selection is limited, Soy Sauce was more like concentred and very salty. No extra oil or sugar, mainly garlic, cilantro, green onions, soy sauce and peanut sauce.\n\nService was pretty fast. This place is very popular so, waiting time can be a deterrent. A great place for family gathering, especially during Winter", "author": "Jean-Yves F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-17", "description": "I seriously don't get the 5 star ratings.\n\nTried it on a non-busy weeknight with my wife. It was a frustrating experience already. I couldn't imagine having to wait on top of that.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the food. There's not as many options as other places, which is fine if what they have is good. Well, I'd have to say the food was just okay. The cuts of meat were decent, but when you boil unseasoned meat, you need something to bring out the flavors.\n\nWe tried two broths - Sichuan mala and Pork Bone. Neither were particularly flavorful enough for broth-focused hot pot like real Sichuan hot pot or Mongolian a la Little Sheep. Then, if not broth focused, what about dipping sauces? Well, there's a soy based one and a ponzu based one and that's about it. Pretty skim on those options too. So overall I found the food to be a bit too bland. Fine, whatever. The have some okay craft beers at decent prices, so that's cool.\n\nBut the kicker is actually the overall experience. I don't care for service in restaurants, but this is probably the only? time it seriously affected our dining. We'll order things, and they'll just set the things down on our table without referencing what they are. So I'm not even sure which meats we liked due to that. We'll order things, and they'll give us wrong plates, but we don't entirely know that until we cook, because they don't explain what that are. We'll order things, and they won't come even after 15 minutes. When asked, only then will the wait staff tell you: oh we don't have that today. How about mentioning it up front when we place the order?\n\nThe most amateurish operation I've experienced and the food itself isn't particularly stand out. I question the integrity of these perfect reviews.", "author": "Terrence H."}

While I've had very good experiences here in the past, my last visit wasn't so pleasant.  To the owner, it's not a good look when three of your waitresses are glued to a smartphone while there are several customers in your establishment.  Also, your employees shouldn't be chomping down on their food and socializing in plain view of the customers.  It was apparent one of our servers was eating while coming over with trays of food.

Good work.\n\nOkay, the 2 star is really on something very silly. Because honestly, the food is great and the service was very good. If not for this silly issue, it's an easy 5*.\n\nPlease, if you have an AYCE place and you don't list drink prices, the assumption is that it's part of the AYCE. Not only that, you wouldn't expect each refill would cost money (this is America! Refill is always free). It leaves a bad taste in a customer's mouth. I don't mind paying for fountain drink or even paying for refills. You simply have to list the price. It's misleading and it's not worth harming your reputation over 2 bucks.\n\nI hope the ownership can respond to this and I'm happy to change my rating.

Soon after this was followed by the first host that greeted them to gesture them to come to a table that had just been cleaned and should've been given to another part who had been waiting for so much longer. Her friends seemed to walk to their table almost looking guilty that they were ALLOWED to cut before all the other costumers who have been wait from 1-3 hours BEFORE they had even arrived.

My wife had remove the big pieces of plain fat from the Wagyu beef, and the server told her that we had to eat the fat, or they would charge us extra for wasting the fat. Maybe some people like eating the fat, but my kids and I weren't about to eat the fat because she said they would charge us extra. This is the first time this has happened to us at a hotpot place.  My family and I don't really eat a lot, and always finish the food we order. This AYCE restaurant definitely made good money from us dining there.
