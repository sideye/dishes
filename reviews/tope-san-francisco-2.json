Yo me and my girls were dancing on the seats...\"\n\nDear Princess Privileged:  1st let me convey my sincere thanks and appreciation for your conviction to never return to Tope.  Tope is, hands down, the coolest chill spot in North Beach (and probably the entire city depending on which night you're there) and as such, doesn't cater to morons who think they have a right to act out any way they please.  While your Mommy and Daddy may have more than enough $$ to pay your hospital bill when you slip and fall off the couch and hit the floor, the person you hit on the way down may be injured (judging from your pic I'm guessing Husky+ might leave a dent).  You and your friends inappropriate immature behavior is a liability to any bar. If you don't believe me please step across the street and  try dancing on the couches in Grant & Green, Tupelo or Maggie McGarry's...what's that hollow echo in between your ears?  Ahhh my bad - they don't HAVE any couches. So when locals who actually enjoy the vibe of Tope want to come over and relax we should feel fortunate to sit on the ripped upholstery and dirt left on the couch by you and your hobbit hosed shoe-sized IQ friends?  Want to take a quick guess who gets sued when one of your friends falls and hits another customer?\n\nIt's a real 1st world  tragedy that you and your \"guy\" friend sustained such massive butt hurt when he was told to get off the couch but unless he's Tom Cruise he should have enough wattage of wit to understand  guys that have it going on don't need to dance on couches. Since he obviously doesn't have it \"going on\" (judging by the company he keeps). he can simply take solace in the fact that \"attention whore\" isn't a good look on a grown man. There's video surveillance in the bar (perhaps you noticed the cameras)  and from the looks of things your \"guy\" friend should be thanking whomever assisted in getting him down off the couch and preserving what little was left of his dignity.  I speak for all locals who've  enjoyed many a relaxing day/night at Tope when I say THANK YOU and your friends for NEVER  darkening the doorway with your heavy cloud-no rain of a shadow.  You want to leave?  TYA...and don't let the door Hit you where the Good Lord Split you....", "author": "Cordane C."}

My roommate and I were hanging out along the boozy streets of North Beach and we stumbled upon Tope and was immediately infatuated with the bay area slaps, if you're from the bay or grew up here you'll know what I mean! Like when e-40 makes a surprise appearance at a concert or that amateur DJ-for-hire is bumpin Too $hort at a Dubs game. The music here transported me back to my nostalgic college days when all my friends were playing bay area rap and hip hop at house parties. Good timez!\n\nTop is smaller than its nearby bar counterparts. It's fun nonetheless, depending on the crowd. Sometimes people get hyphy and other times they could use a big sized Redbull to perk them up.\n\nMy first time here there were two Spanish guys near us and as they were playing some Too $hort hits, they were getting all latin on us and acting as if it was salsa by swaying their hips in that latin motion. lol.\n\nI'd come here again if I were in the mood for that kind of music. Sometimes they weave in one hit wonders or more pop-like songs too so there's a little somethin' for everyone.", "author": "Connie M."}

Everybody was dancing and having a good time, so I thought to myself, why not elevate the fun even more. So I then requested my favorite song, Heartbreak Warfare by John Mayer, to the DJ. Instead of saying thank you for the awesome suggestion and playing it immediately, he told me \"he didn't have access to the song on his laptop\". Not only are there amazing startups out there like YouTube and Spotify who provide a service for this exact need, it also really disturbed me that he didn't have a local download of Heartbreak Warfare on his laptop.

It's super mellow during the week and earlier on in the evening, so you can get a drink at the bar and watch them make yummy drinks. Later in the evening things get busier and drunk people start dancing. However, service is still great. I came on a crowded Friday night for my Bachelorette Party and Casey still found the time to light some drink on fire and make me drink it - it was awesome.

(coz I'm so dope?)  :p\n\n* okaaay, the rhyming stops here *\n\nUnlike other North Beach bars that embody the dive/sports bar theme, Tope does the exact opposite: funky wallpaper, local artwork, fresh juices, fruit compote and bitters grace the cocktail menu.  \n\nThere were only 5 cocktails on the menu and 2 were for vodka fans. (I'm looking out for my peeps!) I wanted to try the Eastwood, a whiskey based cocktail with orange marmalade. I mean, marmalade is supposed to stay in the breakfast category, right?! I was concerned with this drink being too sweet (since it's also made with carpano antica) and when I expressed my concern to the bartender, he just smiled and said, \"oh no, it's not sweet at all!\" I was sold. The Benedictine and the fresh grapefruit really helped to counteract the sweet components in this drink and Templeton Rye has that smooth, lingering finish which stood up to the marmalade. \n\nMy friend's vodka based Fresh Prince had muddled cucumber and ginger beer. Can you say, oh so yummy on a warm day? \n\nSo the cocktails are good but scenesters maybe disappointed, because there isn't any in here! but if you're looking to have a mellow happy hour catching up with your girlfriend surrounded by local clientele and the occasional tourist, this is your spot.

That guy knows his stuff.\n\nThe cocktails were awesome but the crowd made this place worth staying for.  Everyone we met was friendly, fun and pretty hilarious actually.

I'm far from the authority on well-crafted libations though, so my input might not bear too much weight. The following are the cocktails we ordered:\n\n1) Basil Gimlet - I ordered this with vodka and that was all I could taste. I could hardly discern the notes of basil and citrus that I was expecting. Overall, it tasted incomplete and was synonymous with downing a couple shots of Smirnoff. \n\n2) Green Goblin - My friend got this one. It consisted of Hendrick's Gin, Fresh Basil, Lime, Green Chartreuse and Celery Bitters. It sounded interesting enough; however, my friend and I both agreed it landed somewhere close to awful. As my friend stated, \"It tastes like Thai Basil!\" And for the record, a cocktail reminiscent of Thai food isn't too tasty. This drink remained largely un-finished as nobody in our group could stomach it's taste. \n\n3) My Thai - Another friend got this one. This one consisted of gin, jalapeno, cilantro, mango juice, and celery bitters. My friend seemed to think this was alright, but I found it on the verge of nasty. I guess I just don't like cocktails that taste like food. Honestly, I enjoyed the cranberry vodkas the rest of our group ordered more than any of the specialty cocktails (sad I know). \n\nOn the positive, the bartenders were friendly and the space itself is cozy enough. There's a small dance floor too, so that's always an option. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, but I couldn't appreciate what Tope had to offer in the cocktail department.

You betcha!\n\nAfter more than a few pals hipped me to Tope over the past few weeks and months, this nifty little bar had been on my \"to-do\" list of sorts for much longer than it should have. I suppose I don't spend much time in North Beach, so that could explain why it's taken me so long to dip in... but now that there's a third player in the quality elixir game just a stone's throw from the better known haunts of 15 Romolo and Comstock Saloon, chances are, you'll find me in the 'hood a bit more frequently. \n\nTope seems to be flying under the radar on Grant Street, sitting just a few uphill strides from the hustle and bustle of Columbus... and that's a good thing because I want this place all to myself! It's dark, there's a real fun group of locals, they have free tacos from nearby Nico's at happy hour Thursday - Saturday, and best of all... nobody behind the bar takes themselves too seriously. In fact, I really wanted to try a drink on their menu called the \"Hey, That's My Tractor!\" Not only did the name strike a cord with me (I grew up on a farm in Southern California), the ingredients in this notable potable grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and begged me to indulge. While I'm not remembering every last piece to the puzzle of this interesting beverage, I do know it contained muddled dill, vodka, and Sriracha. If you know anything about me at all, you know how much I love the Cock Sauce! So naturally, that was my drink of choice. However, the bartender informed me the drink was temporarily unavailable because they'd just run out of Sriracha... so I offered my assistance in procuring a bottle elsewhere in hopes of sipping on my desired mixed drink. With the help of my gal pal Monica, we acquired a bottle with a little slight of hand (don't ask...), gave it to the bartender, and they made my cocktail with a smile. Not sure how many bars would play along with something like that, but Tope knows how to have a good time, friends. \n\nIn addition to my favored fire water selection, they have a litany of others that appeal to all types of drinkers, they have a TV that's typically fixed to the Giants game when they're playing, and again... it just has a relaxed, casual vibe that you don't normally find at bars with cocktails of this caliber.

Asked hubby if he would like to try this new place out with a beer and watch the Giants?  Ok...we walked in.\n\nNo greeting - fine.  I asked about a beer on tap - he explained and gave us a taste - like a stout with coffee note...not for me.  I opted for a hef and hubby had the Matilda - it was $11.  Doesn't matter but they should probably identify on their sign their $3 draught, like other bars do. \n\nThe beer was icy cold, which is great.  Before we can enjoy anything, two loud girls came in and stayed through our stay.  Youth can be so endearing yet so annoying - they loved themselves so much that the pictures taking were endless followed by their own admiration of the photo of how great they look.  Neither of them looked good but whatever.\n\nGiants is losing and my nerves are getting thin...time to down the beer and head out.  So, we didn't get to try the specialty cocktails - not to say that we knew they existed.  No friendly owner or bartender as experienced by others.\n\nIt's not a bad place - I like the tin ceiling tiles but wish they put it up using another method but staples which are so visible.

I really have no excuse other than a mixture of being extremely busy at work and simply falling into a rut of going to all my usual haunts that I already have reviewed. \n\nThis has made me realize what a creature of habit I have become ever since the boy was deployed to Alaska in January. I go to my usual lunch spots, grab dinner down the street from my house, and meet friends for Happy Hour at North Star and Columbus Cafe on the regular. While emailing back and forth with said boy a few weeks ago, we both realized that he would be home very soon (mid-April).\n\n\"What do you want to do for your first night back in SF?\" I asked him, although knowing his first response would probably be something endearingly childish like \"You!\" \n\nAnd as predicted, he quickly messeged back with a simple and to the point, \"You!\"\n\n\"No really,\" I giggled....I mean come on, that's obvious. \"Do want to go get dinner somewhere? I can cook? It's YOUR welcome home party.\" To my surprise, his response was quite simple but I didn't have even one suggestion in mind.\n\n\"I want to grab a nice drink in the neighborhood, maybe somewhere like a lounge where we could dance too\" he wrote. Hmmm, every place that I know of in North Beach is either a chill dive bar, a tourist trap or a bridge-and-tunnel-cover-charging-club scene. I would have to do some research. \n\nVery soon after this conversation, I heard that the boys over at the Boardroom had opened up a new spot called \"Tope\" on Grant not far from my house and my usual other hangouts. The roommates and I decided to check it out on a rainy Wednesday and ended up being the only people there. I love the renovations they have made, very comfortable and swanky vibe. The bartender whipped us up some yummy whiskey cocktails and told us to come back and try a weekend night, we would not be disappointed. So this last Saturday night, while wandering the 'hood for my friend and fellow Yelper Mindy M's birthday, I talked the crew into stopping in the check it out. \n\nThe place was PACKED, but we still scored the back table and never waited long to order drinks or use the restroom (these are important \"bar\" perks to mention.) They had a DJ spinning some awesome dancehall and reggae, and before you knew it we had a full on dance party happening into the wee morning hours. They offer a full bar and quite an eclectic selection of beers for you connoisseurs out there. \n\nLong story short, I think I found exactly the environment the boy is looking for, for a fun welcome home night on the town...and a fun dance party stop for me and the ladies on girl's night out. I'll be back! Thanks for opening up a cool new spot in the neighborhood!", "author": "Lynsey C."}

They consistently make unique, strong and flavorful cocktails.", "author": "Nic T."}

We popped in just before 10PM to get at least one round of happy hour drinks in.  Yes you heard right, their HH runs till 10pm.  For the 3rd, 4th & 5th rounds we asked the bartender what he recommended and he mixed this awesome, what we ended up calling \"the birthday drink\".  Friendly staff, laid back crowd and reggae music is what kept us here all night rather than barhopping around North Beach.", "author": "Stacey L."}

Its very small but nice and we had a good time dancing but we kept bumping into people because it was so crowded.. I would come back on a week night just to get a better feel for the place. Drinks were nice and strong!", "author": "Florence M."}

Also, not very crowded and in a comfy spot among many other bars in North Beach. Will come back there on a weekend to check the party scene. Not that big, but cozy! (That's what she said). Digital DJ is super awesome.", "author": "Dmitriy A."}

We ventured out that way and once we finished our meal we decided to find a bar for some drinks. We were drawn to Tope because of their happy hour special ($3 wells and drafts) until 10. We sat down and were merely acknowledged by a very disinterested bartender (older man with glasses). We order a couple drinks on HH prices. Long after finishing our drinks, the bartender does not stop by to check up on us. Instead he was huddled in a corner behind the bar on his phone the whole time. Finally my friend get his attention and we order two more drinks. No checking up on us after we finish those either. This was a Monday night, so the bar was very empty. Finally, we decide to leave. I left cash on the bar ($12 for 4 drinks plus $3 tip), but as we were walking out he stops us and says that we did not leave him enough money. Apparently we ordered the last two drinks at 10:05 and those drinks were not HH prices anymore. The bartender failed to tell us HH was ending when we ordered, and as most attentive bartenders do, he should have asked us if we wanted more drinks before the special was over instead of being on his phone the whole time.", "author": "Marite C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-18", "description": "The decoration provides a great setting, however, the gin and tonics we ordered were made incorrectly! The bar tender mixed gin with water which made our G&T's taste horrible. If I were a bar tender and screwed up drinks (with water!), I'd certainly offer to make new one's complimentary to correct my error. Not them, they just said,  \"sorry, we pressed the wrong button\". Don't think I'll be bringing any folks back to this place with all the other good establishments around this area!", "author": "Dahlia S."}

I took advantage of the $3 well drinks until 10pm and then decided to try one of their specialty drinks, the Monte Carlo, which was a welcome change.  I saw some people drinking some alien looking cocktail next to me and it turns out it was made with absinthe.  The bartender was very knowledegable about his liquors and I would let him pick out a cocktail for me any day of the week.  The place was pretty empty for happy hour but then livened up around midnight.", "author": "Scott G."}

But the thing that makes it is the bartenders, specifically the owner. Cool guy with great stories (ask him how he built the bar) and awesome specialty drinks. Love that happy hour goes to 10 for well drinks so you can either fancy it up or get your drink on for cheap. I recommend sitting at the end of the bar near the door so you can watch them making cocktails.", "author": "Codarus C."}
