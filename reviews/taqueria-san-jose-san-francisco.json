Never understood the hype around El Farolito anyways, but Taqueria San Jose can get it all day, everyday!\n\nTACOS! Get 'em! And super size them bad boys up if you really know how to get down. Their super tacos are delicious and they load them up heavily with all of the goodies. That sour cream, though! They give you SO much of it! Never a dull moment with Taqueria San Jose. Some people swear by their al pastor, but I love their chicken tacos. Call me boring, but that ish is so good. \n\nI love their salsa, especially their pico de gallo. Even at 2 am, they always seem to have the salsa bar stacked. Yes it gets crowded on the weekends, but not nearly as bad as El Farolito. The guys behind the counter work really hard and they are always super friendly! They'll remember you when you come in often, all the way down to what you like to order and how you like to prepared. \n\nThey keep it CLEAN! Hallelujah! Nothing is worse than coming from a party and then seeing all of the trash thrown around a restaurant from all of the lazy drunks nearby. They really try their best to keep it clean. I love that they're open until 3 am for all of the fat asses like myself that need a \"beyond midnight snack\" while out late in the city. It's on 24th and Mission, so super close to bart as well. \n\nIt's a hole in the wall, but the food is good and much better quality than many of the other Taquerias on the block. Because of this, they are priced a bit higher but trust me: for the portions, taste, and quality, it's worth it. An excellent choice for delicious super tacos in the Mission!", "author": "Shayla B."}

It's super convenient that it's located right next to 24th St/Mission BART, and I figured I wanted to try a place I'd never been to before. Around 9am on a Saturday it wasn't busy at all, as expected and I ordered the chorizo super breakfast burrito. Probably try to bring cash unless you're coming with friends -- they do have a minimum for credit card so if you're getting multiple items it'll probably be okay but I had to pay cash for my burrito. Nice salsa bar.\n\nThe breakfast burrito was super satisfying, and the portions were v generous -- saved a little bit for later. Unfortunately, the only gripe I have with this place was that it took ages to get my food. There was another party eating in that was waiting for their food to be fair, but I waited for what felt like 20-25 minutes for my breakfast burrito, which is a little beyond my desired taqueria wait time, especially when it's not so busy. I would come back here, but left here a lot less excited than I was when I arrived.", "author": "Brian W."}

The burrito was huge. I split it with my boyfriend but still felt like I had a decent sized meal. The ingredients were pretty straightforward: the standard rice, pinto beans, guac, lettuce, and cilantro. The cilantro was the crowd pleaser. I was sad that the guacamole wasn't more flavorful- I'm a lady who loves lime, and the beans left a lot to be desired. That being said, the tortilla was thick and could've been made in house. It was definitely fresh. Theres a salsa bar available too (of course). Definitely take advantage of it and find your fave. The salsa will add a much needed kick to your dish.\n\nAll in all, I got a lot for my money and the food was decent.

It was like upwards of $40 somehow and the real redeeming piece of the order was the carrot juice, which I found to be primo. \n\nIt took what seemed like 4 days for all our (my) food to come out and when it did, the quesadilla was for sure the least favorite.

I ate a lengua taco with guacamole here this weekend and I can't believe how much meat they load these things with. The portion of meat is beyond generous. There was so much lengua on the taco I can't even pick it up. Just a few bites and the weigh of the meat totally made the taco fall apart. This taco require utensils. The meat was nicely seasoned and tender. I wasn't very fond of the so called guacamole. It was more of a salsa and watery based guacamole. I was expecting chunks of avocado or even a thicker based guacamole. \n\nMy burrito with guacamole was the same. Loaded with meat, cheese, beans, rice, sour cream and the watery guac. Although the guac did not live up to my expectation the meal itself was still very satisfying. The total spent for a taco, burrito and horchata came out to $14.00. To be honest, the meal could've fed two people but being the overeating American I chose to devour everything in front of me. It is fair to say I left the restaurant with a very happy tummy.

I have no doubt Taqueria San Jose has seen better days and maybe I didn't give enough thought to my order here. After all, the little video snippet they posted under their Yelp business listing made the place sound so cozy, clean and family-friendly. Regardless, what Jamie W. and I had here was unequivocally miserable, and its proximity to the 24th Street BART station brought a whole transient element that made us feel like we were waiting for a bus to Bakersfield. And who wants to go to Bakersfield anyway?\n\nI wasn't very adventurous with my selection of a quartet of soft tacos at $2.66 each, and in response, they didn't put much effort in putting them together. It looked like they cut the tortillas in quarters and served them up like hors d'oeuvres at a Mexican fiesta party at a singles mixer. I ordered two of them Lengua (beef tongue) and other two Carnitas (fried pork), the latter of which they smothered in a watery red sauce with what appeared to be a bushel of cilantro (photo: http://bit.ly/1NqpNLQ). The lengua were better simply because there was less sauce and more chopped onion for contrast (photo: http://bit.ly/1MGGhRb).\n\nJamie ordered smarter by getting the $12 Tacos Dorados Platillo. He also got four tacos but his actually looked like tacos in crispy corn tortilla shells, each filled with grilled chicken breast and the same watery red sauce I had. It came with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, rice, refried beans and some very tired looking mashed avocado passing for guacamole (photo:  http://bit.ly/1k9Bjjf). There wasn't anything remotely fresh about his platillo, and the gamey aura of the salsa station wasn't helping much either. I'm afraid I did find a way to San Jose, and frankly I'm OK if I go wrong and lose my way.\n\nFOOD - 1.5 stars...disastrous tacos that didn't look like tacos and less-than-fresh sides\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...has my bus left yet?\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...they were fast, I'll give them that\nTOTAL - 2 stars...making the savory unsavory with less-than-fresh meats & lazy flour tacos that don't satisfy", "author": "Ed U."}

The few times I've gone here, has been after midnight. Never had a problem with my order. \nFood always tasted good. Saturday morning was a different story. I ordered a super carne asada burrito. With everything on it except lettuce and hot sauce. The nice lady assured me that it does not come with lettuce. Cool I thought. I HATE LETTUCE IN MY BURRITO!!! \nThen I ordered my friend's burrito. She's vegan. So I know how to order her burrito. I saw a sign for their grilled veggie burrito. It sounded perfect for her. The nice lady at the counter walked me through the burrito and what it all came with. \"This burrito comes with lettuce. Do you want lettuce? I asked for all the veggies it came with except zucchini and lettuce. Then she asked me if I wanted cheese and sour cream. I CLEARLY TOLD HER NO SOUR CREAM. NO CHEESE. \"No sour cream n cheese?\" she asked again. AGAIN I said NO CHEESE NO SOUR CREAM, NO LETTUCE. By the way, I ordered in Spanish. So I know there was no language barrier. The nice lady understood my order. I saw her clearly mark down the instructions for the burrito maker to follow. I ate my burrito there while I was waiting for my friend to show up. We had a long ride ahead of us. She decided to take her burrito (the veggie one) with her and eat it when we got to where we were going. An hour later. We get to our destination. She is hungry. She couldn't wait for that \"Grilled Veggie Burrito\" that I had described to her. She starts to unwrap her big burrito. She was talking about and waiting for this moment the whole morning. \nShe takes a big bite. CHEESE AND SOUR CREAM. CHEESE AND SOUR CREAM. CHEESE AND SOUR CREAM!!!! She almost cried. I was furious. It also had LETTUCE in it. I was an hour away so I couldn't just go back with that burrito to show it to them. We couldn't bring food and I wasn't about to carry a burrito with me all day.

We somehow ended up at Taqueria San Jose Sunday morning when I told my friend to drive to Mexico Tipico. I guess someone was drunkER than the rest of us. :T \n\nUpon walking into Taqueria San Jose and seeing all hipster and no natives, I already knew this was going to be bad. However, looking at the menu seemed a bit more promising because they had lengua and cabeza which only more authentic taquerias tend to have. \n\nSUPER LENGUA BURRITO w/ No Rice, No Beans, & No Cheese (crazy looks from the cashier not pictured)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r0N9vb7G4Us8HEG20v4NkA?select=6jk8Ka25SHFWq7F3hNbsvg\nMy burrito was one disappointing soggy log. The juices from the pico de gallo made the tortilla limp and wet. The copious amounts of crema was overwhelming and made each mouthful difficult to eat. The lengua? What very little lengua there was, were diced in microscopic cubes; the onions in the salsa were larger than the lengua pieces. The lengua was not braised long enough as it had a tough and hard texture. It was like eating a burrito after it has been weathered in a rain storm; several bites in, I threw in the towel.\n\nOne of my friends drunkenly threw a slice of carne asada in my basket which was equally as bad. The tough as shoe leather carne asada was cold, dry, and flavorless. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r0N9vb7G4Us8HEG20v4NkA?select=dTy_2rRSgJwpAaxu08YAAg\n\nJust because you're catering to the drunk crowd at 2 AM doesn't mean you can serve subpar food and for some of them to not take notice. Nothing can phase this drunktard's taste buds. \n\nOne star for being clean and well-lit. \nOne star for the delicious salsa verde. \n\n***HITS THE REMIND BUTTON***\n\nBack to the start of the review, as I was walking to the bathroom, I remember seeing a sign saying that Taqueria San Jose was the first taqueria to open in SF in 1980 (makes no sense even sober). To confirm that I wasn't being delusional, I checked their website which Taqueria San Jose does state themselves as the first taqueria in SF to open in 1980 under \"our history\". Ummm, if you're going to lie, please do a better job. La Cumbre was the first taqueria to open in SF in 1967.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-03", "description": "A lot of people review this place as a comparison to El Farolito, and while I can see the resemblance (open late, on opposite corners of the same intersection, and same category of food) I don't think it's necessarily a fair comparison as they offer rather complementary features. \n\n1. Taqueria San Jose has more space, bar none. So much so, they host a Friday night board game night (or maybe magic the gathering? Scrabble? I can't always tell, but I think it rotates or they host a mix). \n\n2. UPDATE: they no longer take credit cards :( Taqueria San Jose takes credit cards, and if it bothers them that I spend ~$6 each time, they never let on.\n\n3. Taqueria San Jose almost never has a line. I can usually order, pay, and be out the door with my grub in 5 minutes or less.\n\n4. Taqueria San Jose night shift rocks! I think the food is better after 8pm because it's busier, which means the food is fresher. I've only heard complaints from people not sober enough to judge, or people who came during the day... But this could totally be coincidence/superstition.\n\n5. Taqueria San Jose's super taco is my jam (I've never had anything else). I might get the pollo adobo or al pastor if I'm especially hungry/hankering for some grease in my gullet (if you're hungry but don't want the grease, the pollo adobo is your best bet), but the vegetarian super taco is usually a satisfactory quantity of food. It's a fork and knife endeavor when you eat it out of the to-go container, or on a plate you can try to separate the tortillas to make two large/messy tacos. My only (small) gripe here is, even though it's *exactly* the amount of food I want (which helps with portion control), it's about 2/3 the price of a burrito, but only 1/3 the amount of food. Evaluating price per calorie, this is not strictly budget-friendly, but it's awesome if you're looking to fill your belly to a reasonable bloat on less than $6 without leftovers.\n\nMostly I guess I'm just impatient. I think the food is (all things considered-- remember, I've only eaten the super taco, and that's not something El Farolito offers) just as good as their neighbor, but I don't like to wait in line/make sure I have cash/be forced to take it to-go because there aren't enough seats inside.

Nowadays the place has a fresh coat of paint, is much cleaner and the restrooms are pretty nice.\n\nTSJ has the the biggest burritos I have come across anywhere in the Mission, which is saying a lot. They are a bit juicier than others as well. That might turn some people off but I like the extra moisture. You're guaranteed never to get a dry burrito. My usual order is an al pastor super burrito, no beans. Most places will just serve you a smaller burrito if you order one without beans, but TSJ ups the amount of meat and rice to make up for it. Solid. The al pastor is always juicy and flavorful but can sometimes lack those crispy edges that make it something special.\n\nI miss living around the corner from this place. How much do I miss it, you ask? I once drove 10 burritos home to LA, froze them and rationed them out over the next few months. True story.\n\np.s.

It had just the right mixture of spicy and tangy to keep my taste buds happy for the whole burrito.  San Jose seems to go a bit lighter on the rice than El Farolito, instead opting for more meat, salsa, and grac to stuff their burrito.  This didn't write work for me, but I imagine for some people it will be awesome.\n\nPerhaps due to the lack of rice, the burrito also super greasy. I can imagine this might be a good thing if you're stopping by after a night out, but it may give you feelings of regret during the daytime.  It didn't ruin my experience, but it may for you.\n\nThe one area where San Jose is lacking is burrito construction.  The bottom of mine fell apart pretty quickly, so I was left to cleanup the leftovers with a fork.\n\nNonetheless, clean up all the leftovers I did, as the deliciousness of the Al pastor made up for all the downsides.  San Jose hasn't unseated El Farolito in my mind, but it's definitely a respectable entrant in the mission burrito rotation.", "author": "Jonathan M."}

San Francisco's claim to Roadfood fame is the burrito, the best examples of which can be found in the city's Mission district. Located half a block from the 24th Street BART station, Taqueria San Jose has been lauded year after year by various local publications for having the best burritos in the Mission and therefore the best in the city. It won't take you long to figure out why.\n\nFormica tables and plastic chairs crowd the unassuming storefront, decorated with the paintings of well-endowed senoritas and matadors, mariachi music or a soccer match on TV providing the soundtrack. But one comes not for the ambiance, but for the food. Place your order at the counter, pick up your basket of freshly fried tortilla chips, load your little plastic cups at the salsa bar (go for the outrageously fresh-tasting pico de gallo and/or guacamole), and munch away until your number is called to pick up your food.\n\nThe burritos are, in a word, humongous. Two-fisted eating at its finest, a massive fresh flour tortilla stuffed with your choice of meat, rice, refried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa and guacamole. If you're not burrito-minded, you won't go wrong with the fajitas, meat and peppers and onions heaped high, or the tacos. Think there's no such thing as non-greasy chorizo sausage? Then you haven't eaten a Taqueria San Jose chorizo taco, redolent of spices that are eased by sour cream and another freshly made tortilla and not a speck of grease in sight or on palate.\n\nTaqueria San Jose has two other locations closer to the touristy sections of San Francisco and I'm told that the quality is the same, but when in doubt, go to the original. I can also say that the leftovers from a carnitas (pork) burrito make a pretty darn good breakfast. \n\nPS--this is a re-post of my Roadfood.com review, which, I am proud to say, is now framed and hanging in the shop.  I wonder if I'd get a free burrito if I showed my ID ... ?", "author": "Patricia B."}

I had no idea there would be SO MUCH food in the box or I would have gotten just one or the other. But really I wanted both and didn't know the taco would be like 3 tacos. Anyway in the end I just ate the taco last night and then reheated the chile relleno today.\n\nWhile I would not say this was the best I've ever had, in SF or elsewhere, it was good. As I've said, huge portions. I was thinking it was not quite as cheap as some of the other local taquerias, but once I saw the size of the portions I realized that it is very cheap indeed. The chips were really good and fresh. I liked the salsas. The meat was a little dry though.\n\nOne thing I was not crazy about (although I have to admit it tasted good when I reheated it in the oven today) was that they put the chile relleno in the microwave. I don't know if it was precooked and they were heating it up--more likely, I think, is that they were melting the cheese on top (I hope that's why) but that is still something I'd rather see done under a broiler than in a microwave when I'm eating out.  Again, it did taste good today, much better than many chile rellenos I've had (and I've had a lot)--very big, a lot of cheese--and the refried beans and rice were tasty (though the beans were a tad on the salty side for my taste). But I'm just not wild about seeing anything put in the microwave at a restaurant.\n\nSo...I guess I would recommend it as...not bad...but I'm sure there are better places too.

Although I've enjoyed a number of offerings from El Farolito, sadly, they don't offer pescado tacos. So down the block I spied Taqueira San Jose and thought I'd give it a go. \n\nI ordered two crispy pescado tacos and one super pescado taco, and chips and salsa. It's almost criminal when a taqueria charges for chips and salsa. Chips were so-so, but the self serve salsa was on FIRE. And I am not usually one to shy away from spicy fare. It hurt in an oh so good, hit you in the back of the throat, need another Mexican coke kind of way. I suppose $1.50 for chips and salsa isn't going to kill me, and yet I will grumble anyways. \n\nOn to the tacos: My mistake for ordering them to go, and not devouring them on the spot. But minus one star for the craptastic packing. By the time I got to unwrapping them, my crispy tacos had been reduced to some crumbled soggy bits of corn meal mush hugging what I supposed was the fish. My anticipation deflated, and I was sorely disappointed.\n\nI was somewhat cheered by Pookie's selection of the super taco. A taco so laden with rice, beans, salsa, guac, sour cream and seasoned fish, that it had to be packed in its own little take out box. Pookie even noted that it was \"damn heavy\" and \"are you sure this is just one taco?\" We ended up downing this one with a fork, since it didn't led itself to the fine art of taco origami, and probably would fall apart at first bite. \n\nA little pricey for tacos, at around $4 each. I think El Farolito is a super cheap $1.95.\n\nThe Good: Bottom line, the pescado WAS delish, and the super taco was pretty amazing. My MO next time would be to order the super pescado taco CRISPY and eat it right there as it came out of the kitchen. An added plus? They take credit/debit cards, so you're not fumbling for cash at the end of a looooong night. \n\nThe Bad: Shitty packing ruined my crispy taco, and I ended up eating it with a fork and chips.

Our choices: Taqueria Cancun (the one between 18th and 19th) and Taqueria San Jose. Since I didn't feel like driving through a goddamn hurricane for tacos, we settled on the one that is closest to my house.\n\nI hadn't been back to my stomping grounds for a while (Luna Park definitely does not count), and I quickly saw that it was the same as I had left it. There were roughly 5 or 6 police cars all over this stretch of Mission street, sirens blaring and a mass of cops walking around like one of them had lost their keys. As we crossed the street in the rain, we passed by two police offers, who quickly ran down the situation:\n\nCop 1: \"So we still don't have a victim?\"\nCop 2: \"That's right, Lieutenant.\"\n\nNothing like tacos and random gunfire to welcome you home.\n\nTaqueria San Jose, as you might of guessed, is a 3-star taqueria that doesn't really have anything to write home (or on Yelp) about. The food is a bit greasy, the salsa at the salsa bar is not fresh, and the place is cold as shit. However, sometimes you kind of want that, or dare I say need that. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos with cheese and guacamole, and they were both great. Not taco truck great, not La Taqueria great, but \"it's 11pm and I'm glad I'm eating these tacos instead of gnawing my fucking arm off from hunger\" great. And that's all you can really ask for.\n\nWith so many taquerias in the area, why chose Taqueria San Jose over any other taqueria?

I can't explain it very well but the ratios of meat to other ingredients was off somehow. The meat itself didn't taste that good either. It was very dry chicken that seemed like it had been over BBQed. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but I've had quite a bit better.\n\nI would suggest many other taquerias in the Mission over this place.\n\nThe only advantage I found was that this place wasn't as busy at 1:30am compared to the overly popular competing taqueria kitty corner across the street, which seems to attract all the after bar/club hipster crowd. \n\nIf I remember correctly, the prices were decent-- around what you would normally pay for a mission burrito.\n\nOverall, it's probably a 3 star if I went back and tried it multiple times, but from my 1 time there, I wasn't very pleased and didn't even finish my whole burrito-- something I almost never do.", "author": "P.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-05", "description": "I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this place. Let me explain. \n\nThe Al Pastor here is outstanding... in the traditional divey taqueria way. It's nice and spicy, and the ample grease mixes with sour cream to form some sort of heavenly goo. \n\nSome people in the area (and the dudes on burritoeater.com) will claim that Taqueria Can-Cun and Taqueria San Francisco have better Al Pastor. Let me break it down like this: \n\n- San Jose has what I've come to expect from great Al Pastor. It's spicy. It's greasy. It has a few little crunchy burned pieces. It has a ton of flavor, and is downright satisfying.\n\n- Can-cun's Al Pastor often has the same qualities I described above. Other times, I get a load of Al Pastor there that's *too* *damn* *sweet*. Weird. It's ok, but it tastes mostly like paprika and brown sugar.\n\n- Taq. San Francisco is in its own world. I can't exactly compare their Al Pastor to others just yet, because it isn't what I'm used to. It's not all that greasy, and there are no burned pieces. The quality control is actually outstanding, and it's definitely delicious. It's just that I feel like I'm eating something else... not quite Al Pastor. I do love it, though, whatever it is. I have to go back again.\n\nThe grilled chicken at Taq. San Jose kinda tastes like the Al Pastor... spicy, but not so greasy. \n\nChoosing either the chicken or the Al Pastor will result in a solid burrito experience. \n\nThey have good salsa, too, and their pickled carrots and peppers are delicious.\n\nEverything else here is kinda mediocre. The carne asada is average, as are the quesadillas.\n\nSo, to summarize, go here for the Al Pastor or the Chicken... especially if you're planning to go \"super\". Otherwise, this place is just like a lot of other places in the burrito corridor.", "author": "Angelo B."}

I don't consider myself to have a huge appetite, but I can usually finish what's in front of me.\n\nAnyway, the food itself was OK. I really enjoyed the first few bites of my chicken burrito, but after a while I just didn't dig it. It was OVER-stuffed with meat (maybe that's your thing, but it ain't mine), and totally drippy and messy from the rather watery salsa they slopped on (even though I asked them not to).\n\nAll in all, it's definitely not TOO bad a place.
