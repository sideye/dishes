After I got seated, I waited almost 15mins for someone to come take an order. Their staff was standing around lounging and the restaurant wasn't busy at all, only 5-6 tables had people so the place was pretty empty. I soon realized that 15mins wasn't too bad. Since their tables are so close to each other, I could clearly hear people on the tables next to me. When I got there, couple sitting at the table to my right had already finished their food and had empty dishes. After I ordered my food and got it delivered to me, the couple on my right were STILL waiting for their empty dishes to be cleared and brought their check! Meanwhile, the server completely forgot that the lady sitting to the left of me had ordered dinner and he brought her the check (which she obviously had not asked for) for the one appetizer she had! I mean, how oblivious could they be to what was happening when the place is almost empty?\n\nAs for the food, I ordered butter chicken with plain naan. Butter chicken was meh at best and was super salty. The naan was under cooked. If I wasn't starving, I would have left without eating. \n\nThere's no shortage of Indian restaurants in SF so not sure why anyone should pick this place. Don't make the mistake I made, go anywhere else but here.\n\nEdit - Yelp just notified me that this place has a poor health score (68/100). \"Following a recent inspection, this facility received a food safety rating that is in the bottom 5% locally, and is categorized by inspectors as \"poor\".\" Wish I could give them less than a 1 star!", "author": "Mayank A."}

I ordered delivery through Yelp with an estimated delivery of 40-50 minutes. My order was confirmed at 7:38p and the estimated delivery time was 8:29p. The food did not arrive until closer to 9p, when it did arrive it was cold. The delivery also did not include any utensils. \n\nThe actual food was not only cold as stated before, but was lacking flavors that make Indian food a true standout. The chicken tikka masala was bland, and the chicken was dry. The chicken vindaloo was not spicy, the chicken was bland, and the spices were not what I've come to expect and enjoy from vindaloo. The garlic naan tasted like the frozen kind you purchase from the grocery store, as did the samosas. \n\nI would definitely not come here again the next time I'm in the area and the service received by the restaurant and grub hub makes me question if I will ever use Yelp for delivery again also. \n\nWith the many other options available for Indian food, I suggest trying somewhere else.", "author": "danyle w."}

It was pretty slow, we got the fish pakora, Tandoori salmon, pulau rice, and naan. We were pleased to find out the fish used in the pakora was salmon. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations. It tasted like they was refried from a previously fried batch from earlier. The batter soaked up excess oil, it was soggy, super salty, and had an odd taste to it. The tandoori salmon entree came out on a sizzling plate which looked appetizing. It was not tooo bad... \n\nThe green chutney and tamarind sauce was the best part of the meal. Customer service was ok too, they filled our drinks pretty often.\n\nI'm a little disappointed I did not CHECK-IN prior to dining in or we would have seen the poor food safety score notice. (Thanks, yelp for putting these notices up!!) I usually always try to checkin to check reccomendations for good entrees but we had such a good buffet lunch here a few years ago, I didn't bother.

The food is flavorful, ambiance is cozy, and it's usually easy to get a table so I find it reliable when I'm in search of warm Indian food :). \n\nI've come here both for lunch buffet and come countless times for a la carte dinner and takeaway. The lunch buffet is excellent. There is solid variety for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! It's a great spot for a team lunch. But, I'd definitely recommend a la carte over the buffet. \n\nBelow are my favorite dishes for when I order for dine in or takeaway:\n\nChicken Korma - this one is outstanding! It is so incredibly flavorful and zesty. It's different from your usual chicken tikka masala due to the almond base, but in an incredible way. I'd highly recommend trying it to stray away from the usual popular orders. \n\nDal Saag - An excellent healthy dish for the vegetarians that is much lighter than a paneer makhani or tikka masala. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - A timeless classic that is done well at North India\n\nMushroom Matar - This is a fantastically spiced dish of peas and mushrooms and again much lighter than the creamy tikka masala or makhani sauces. \n\nOverall, I love the food here! Deducting one star for service which can be slow at times, but I hope it is something that improves :).", "author": "Sabina S."}

I am not extremely well-versed in Indian cuisine, so both times I ordered the standard chicken tikka masala. My boyfriend got the Sunday lunch buffet when we went together; he also loved it and thought the quality of food was very high, despite it being a buffet. I think the Sunday buffet price was $14-15, but I don't remember the exact price, and chicken tikka masala was $13, with garlic naan and rice an extra $2-3. As it's located smack-dab in the Financial District, prices are not cheap but the food is completely worth it. \n\nNorth India's chicken tikka masala is one of the best dishes I've ever had, probably in my entire life (or maybe I just haven't had enough Indian food yet!) It is slightly spicy, buttery, and mouthwatering - managing to achieve that wonderful elusive blend of savory and tanginess, without going overboard. The sauce is not too oily and greasy, and the chicken is juicy and hearty. In addition, the sauce pairs wonderfully with the basmati rice! The garlic naan is incredible, and addicting - a perfect complement to the chicken tikka masala. Portion sizes are massive, and absolutely enough for two meals.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very pleasant, and service is efficient and attentive.

The customer service was bad from the moment we entered the restaurant...and it just gets worst. We were seated down and not served with anything (no menu, no water) for 10 minutes. Once we ordered the food the wait was 1 hour 10 minutes before our food was served. During the wait we have prompted them regarding our food but they did not seem to care. Our order arrived but was missing an item which we informed them right away so they can bring it out. We finished our meal and never got the item. Also, Our daughter was siting on a high chair and the waiter was holding knifes and folks walk pass at very close proximity to her head. Waiters didn't care, had no smile. \n\nWe are never coming here again. You definitely shouldn't come here if you want expect standard service!", "author": "Alice Sillon M."}

As always, it would be nice to have more pieces of chicken as well!\n\n- - - - -\nService and food were great! We got the chicken tikka masala, curry eggplant (or eggplant in a stewed, thick yellow sauce that had a nice kick to it in flavor!), kabuli (fruit and nuts) naan, and an onion naan. The food came out piping hot and the naan warm, the taste was very comforting and not overly spicy as some Indian dishes are.\n\nWe also ordered a nice full glass of mango lassi that was thick and sweet, tastes like they did use real fruit and quality yogurt to blend the drink!\n\nThe only reason I am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because there were stains on the water glasses and the plates and utensils were a little oily to touch. (I'm a bit of a germaphobe and a neat freak).\n\nOverall I liked the intimate ambiance of the place and how it was relatively quiet enough to talk in hushed voices and still hear your company talking.

I was such in desperate need of rogan josh that I decided to forgo cooking dinner one night and order in. DoorDash had quite a few options for Indian food, but I'm glad my roommate guided me in the right direction for good Indian food, because apparently he's made some mistakes in the past.\n\nTypically, ordering online yields lower quality food than visiting the actual restaurant, so if that's the case here, I really need to visit the physical location of North India Restaurant! I had rogan josh with garlic naan, both of which were phenomenal choices. The flavor was perfect. The order was still hot (thanks to DoorDash) and I had enough leftover food for lunch the next day.\n\nI selected \"medium\" as the spice level for the rogan josh, and I'm sooo glad I wasn't feeling ambitious because \"medium\" was plenty of fire. Both the curry and the naan were a few more dollars than I would usually like to pay for Indian food (especially after all the delivery charges) but it was worth it. They were generously flavorful.\n\nI suppose everything about my experience with North India Restaurant was unusual. I don't usually order food online. I prefer going into the actual restaurant. I also don't usually write Yelp reviews for food unless I've experienced the service and the environment of the restaurant. But the food compelled me to do so!

I did experience multiple delays with delivery which at the time felt understandable due to traffic, weather etc. On a few occasions, I had to do a weird dance with the delivery persons who asked for a cash tip though I had already tipped online. But the reason this is a 2 star rating not a 3 star (or more) rating is because of a particular incident I had ordering here a few weeks ago. I placed an order for a different dish than my usual - the seafood biryani dish. I received my food and was shocked to discover that the seafood was very clearly spoilt. I had paid for and been given what smelled and unfortunately for me tasted like spoilt seafood. I called Yelp/Grubhub and was informed that the restaurant refused to give me a refund and instead offered to redeliver the meal for free.

You are still wearing your jackets and holding your bag if your have one. \n\n2) the line is like a cafeteria line. So move fast bc ppl behind you also want their food. \n\n3) after you get your food then someone at the end tells you where to sit. The tables are so close together that I bumped someone's arm with my butt as I squeezed to get to my seat. My flat Asian butt doesn't stick out much so it wasn't the size of the butt that was the problem if that's what you're wondering. \n\n4) the restaurant is arranged so that if you want to get seconds you have to line up again. Going all the way around the restaurant. The area around the buffet is so crowded that it's really a pain to go back. So really people are piling their plates high and food running into each other and naan getting wet in your sauce etc. I guess only a problem during the lunch rush which is when we were there. \n\nPrice is good $14 per person but really the whole enjoyment of Indian buffet is getting multiple small portions and then going back for favorites. Again the food is fine. A big spicy including the nice shaved brussel sprouts and chickpea salad. As well as this carrot dish that wasn't labeled. I think they are popular and tried to maximize the seating at the cost of comfort and fret space. If I lived here i wouldn't go back but would find somewhere else. \n\nAlso bones was playing on the tv above the tiny bar which was out of place and somehow off putting.

The boy and I came for an early dinner one Saturday evening, enticed by the solid review stats--although, I maintain (more than ever, after eating here) that yelp rating stats are not so reliable for authentic Asian cuisine. Every table comes with the bright green chutney and the sweet tangy brown sauce. We ordered samosas, a new-to-me dish of small stir-fried paneer pieces, and the classic daal, with of course a variety of naan and good ol' carbs to make it a proper meal. My samosa was average but the boy complained that his was not heated all the way, but in fact cold in the center. So, not only are the samosas not fresh, but they failed to even heat them thoroughly so that they could at least appear fresh. The other food was similarly average at best; I've definitely had better Indian elsewhere. The most redeeming aspect of North India Restaurant is possibly that the curries come in large portions. Furthermore, most of the staff maintain the average level of customer service friendliness, but our main waiter never smiled, made eye contact, or really talked to us at all throughout the meal, as he went back and forth delivering dishes, which was a bit uncomfortable. And now, there is a Poor Food Safety Score alert here on their page...I'm not sure why this restaurant has such a solid rating in general--I certainly hope there are better Indian options around for SF employees!", "author": "Amy G."}

We hadn't had Indian food in a while, so we decided to try out North India Restaurant.\n\nWhile Market Street was teeming with throngs of holiday shoppers, the area a couple blocks east was much quieter. North India Restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, so we were seated by the window. The interior of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Bhangra music played lightly in the background and the booths along the window had soft, comfortable cushions. It was a nice respite from the clamor of Market Street.\n\nI suppose that this restaurant gets most of its customers at lunch time when it has a buffet. In the evenings, they offer an amazing Yelp deal for half off of a second entree. We were happy to take them up on this offer, and we ordered chicken tikka masala, Bombay chicken, and vegetable pakora as an appetizer. \n\nThe pakora was crisp and had a hint of spice to it. The cilantro mint chutney complemented the pakora well, and my girlfriend appreciated that they put the tamarind in a separate ramekin from the cilantro chutney (she is not a fan of the tamarind). \n\nShortly after we finished our appetizer, our main dishes arrived. The chicken tikka masala was rich, creamy, and sufficiently spicy (we specified that spice level to be 'hot'), everything that one would want in this dish. The sauce for the Bombay chicken was very similar to the tikka masala sauce but without the heavy cream. The piquant sauces tasted great with the crisp, buttery naan. The chicken was tender and juicy as well. \n\nOn top of the food being excellent, the service was really great too. What some people in other reviews may call \"rudeness\" was really just alacrity. Our waiter took our orders quickly (and didn't need to write them down), and our food was brought out to us promptly. \n\nAmazingly, with the Yelp deal our meal cost just over $30. You can't do any better than that in the City downtown. We will definitely be back.", "author": "Ravi S."}

My partner and I decided to come here not specifically for the food (even though I would label us as foodies) but for the ambiance as well- since finding an authentic Indian restaurant with tablecloths is not the easiest thing to come by.\nUpon entry I was very pleased with my surroundings and would say that this is a good place to have a long dinner if you desire.\nWe asked to look at the wine list and were surprised to not see any very light reds on the list since Indian is quite heavy but we settled on a Pinot and it was fine.\nThe food itself also was fine. I am vegetarian and ordered the Bengan Bartha, Paneer Jalfrezi, Goat cheese naan and Garlic naan for dinner.  The food did not necessarily stand out to me but it wasn't bad either. I had tried the Goat cheese naan out of curiosity and wouldn't get it again- I suppose I was expecting a more goat cheese flavor but it tasted pretty much like normal naan to me. The garlic naan was good.\nThe service was attentive in the beginning and then as the restaurant grew more crowded it was less so. I believe they were under staffed though so I know he was doing his best. \nAt the end of the meal I had only eaten about 1/3 of my food because I had ordered a lot and also because I had a headache and so was planning on enjoying the bulk of my meal the next day when I felt better. I asked to get my food to go from someone who was not our waiter but who had started clearing our dishes and he said yes and took my food away- and then I never saw it again. \nWe had paid our bill and finally asked our original server if my food was coming out soon and after a discussion with a lot of pointing in our direction with the man who cleared our dishes he came back to say that there had been some miss communication about my food and they hadn't saved it, but they were making my food again to take away. We didn't really want to wait for another meal to be made obviously, but I had had so much food left it seemed silly not to, so we waited and they came out with a to go bag after a few minutes and we were on our way.\nI wish I had checked the bag before leaving because when we got home I realized it was a bag full of regular naan and one thing of Butter Chicken which obviously as a vegetarian I can't eat. So I kind of feel like I paid for a meal I didn't eat, but I am not really sure what to do about that one now.\nI don't know if I will be returning to North India, but I wouldn't say don't go if you want to give it a try.", "author": "Holden C."}

I thought about getting their lunch box, but I don't really like eating curry with rice and I wanted variety. I figured their buffet was the best solution. I didn't have a reservation and just walked in by myself. They were about 5 other tables already enjoying their lunch.\n\nFrom the buffet, I sampled the following:\n*Palak pakur\n*Fish pakaura\n*Tandoori chicken\n*Malai kofta\n*Rice pilav: saffron flavored basmati rice garnished with green peas\n*Saag paneer\n*Lamb curry: lamb curry with garlic, ginger & onion gravy sauce\n*Chicken makhni: strips of tandoori chicken cooked in a mild creamy sauce\n*Nan\n*Mint Chutney\n\nMy first plate was a tiny sample of each of the above so I could determine what I really wanted to eat. I enjoyed the Fish pakaura, Tandoori chicken, Lamb curry, Chicken makhni, Nan and Mint Chutney so my second plate had a good serving of all of those. The tandoori chicken was moist and the chicken makhni had great flavor. I rarely get lamb curry as the roommate doesn't like lamb, so I enjoyed this. The naan was average, but I always need naan to soak up all the delicious curry!\n\nI actually have an Indian buffet option closer to work, but it's more expensive and and super crowded. You spent half your lunch waiting in line. I was happy North India wasn't really crowded. Great buffet option for $12.", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-23", "description": "The lunch buffet here is pretty decent, with a good variety, but the downside is that the restaurant is a complete a sh*tshow during the lunch rush and very chaotic. \n\nThey would ask people to stand in the long line for the buffet before the wait staff even find an open table for the diners. It's definitely more efficient, but it causes a lot of confusion when diners, with a heavy plate of food, try to navigate the dining room crammed with tables, trying to find an open spot. For $5 more, it's definitely worth it to go to Amber, but if you're low on time, this place will do fine. \n\nThe buffet changes every day, but they generally have 2-3 veg dishes, 2-3 meat dishes, 2 appetizers, 2 desserts and 2 salads. The naan bread isn't great, though. Definitely pile the plate high with food because you don't want to waste another 10 minutes standing in line for round 2!", "author": "Alice W."}

We were hungry again. The service was not up to par. The waiter gave us ice cream \"on the house\" but honestly. It was a slab of strawberry ice cream that felt like had freezer burn. At least give us something a little more authentic to the South Asian culture like coconut. My friend and I didn't even touch it since we were ready to go. Maybe I'll come back for the buffet, but knowing me. SF is not my favorite. I rather be on the better side of the bay.", "author": "Phuong V."}

I am somewhat suspicious of most Indian restaurants I encounter in the US since I am originally from the UK (which is renowned for its splendid Indian food).  Nevertheless, my friends and I were treated to a bounty of delicious and flavorful dishes, all of which did not disappoint.\n\nThe splurge of curries, naan bread, papadums, samosas, and basmati rice were all enough to make a grown man squeal in sheer bliss.  Sure I was hungry, but even the ravenous hunger which had overcome me could not hide the fact that this food was of the utmost quality.  The service was courteous and efficient.  \n\nAnd if you're wondering about desserts, well, let me tell you this.  If you are a well behaved man/woman and mind your p's and q's, I can almost guarantee the waiting staff will bless your table with complimentary scoops of coconut and mango ice cream.

Unfortunately the experience just wasn't up to snuff.\n\nFirst problem was the wait. It must have been close to an hour before we got our delivery (we were not far). This isn't a deal-breaker though. I don't mind waiting a bit longer for a quality meal.\n\nSecond problem was when they delivered the meals (to a hotel room, mind you), there were no utensils. This was really annoying and just seemed like a really thoughtless oversight. Luckily we were able to call down to the hotel and they sent up utensils, but it was really an oversight.\n\nFinally, we opened the dishes and realized there was no rice. We ordered a bunch of saucey dishes and thought it must have been a mistake because they typically come with rice. Upon calling the restaurant we were told that we should have ordered the rice separately. This needs to be made much more clear when ordering dishes because they were pretty silly to eat without rice and I didn't end up eating very much.\n\nWith all of that being said, the flavor of my dish was really good (though even the mild version definitely has some heat!). Additionally, the naan was delicious (they have a bunch of flavors).\n\nIt's too bad we didn't eat in the restaurant. Perhaps it would have been a better experience. But they definitely need to work on their delivery service so as not to leave customers as unsatisfied as we ended up.", "author": "Andi P."}

The only strange part was that they brought the main while the starter was still in play. Not a negative, it just surprised me. Having said that, again as a solo diner I appreciated that I didn't have to stare into space for any length of time - and I genuinely suspect that's why the meal was served in this manner as there was no sign of rushing me later on.\nAll in all, an extremely enjoyable meal with very attentive staff.

Their lunch boxes are very reasonable -- you pay ~$7-9 for 1-2 curries over rice. The portions are very generous; I inevitably end up with leftovers for the next day.\n\nFor a sit-down lunch, I would come earlier in the day (by 11:30am) to get a seat as it will get crowded in the middle of the afternoon. If it's a nice day, sit at the tables outside! However, the inside setup isn't too bad--there are small tables on the edge of restaurant, with longer tables for bigger groups in the middle. It's a little but cozy on the inside, so just be careful of knocking into plates at the next table. \n\nWhile the selection isn't as diverse as Amber India by Yerba Buena, the food is equally tasty and much more affordable. Try the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA, TANDOORI CHICKEN, and grab multiple pieces of crispy NAAN to dip into the sweet TAMARIND CHUTNEY & spicy MINT CHUTNEY. \n\nThe service is pretty attentive here!

The service was a bit slow but friendly. \n\nSince we liked the food so much, we decided to go back on our next work trip. This time there were four of us and we were seated right away. Service was again slow, but friendly. When our meals came out, they forgot one of my friends entrees. We had to flag the server down to remind him that we were missing a dish. They were apologetic and we're off to find the dish - I honestly think it just didn't get made because it took a while to come out. We were almost done with our meals by the time hers came out, but they were really nice about the error and hooked us up when it came time to pay the bill. \n\nOverall I'll continue to visit here when I'm in SF. I don't expect the fastest service, but the food is so good!!", "author": "Kristy P."}

Figure.) that serves up an average lunch buffet with the standard vegetarian options. Lentils, paneer, mixed vegetable kormas, etc. were all available.\nI was coming back from Yosemite with a friend, and we decided to see another friend in San Francisco before we flew out. He's Indian and recommended North India, though was worried it would be packed. He explained that during peak lunch hours, the line is out the door.\n\nNorth India was all very in line with expectations. It's the kind of place I would visit maybe once a month if I were working nearby and looking for lunch. The lentils look watery in the picture, but they actually tasted great. The mixed veggies and the saag paneer were very average. I found myself going back to the buffet only to get the lentils, rice, and naan. I love how the naan came out fresh here.\n\nI'd probably avoid returning here for lunch unless it were off hours when on my own, but wouldn't say no to an invitation to come back.", "author": "Chris O."}

That would also explain the long take-out line! Anyway, I came here for lunch with a friend around 11:40am on a weekday. Wasn't crowded at all, and we were seated immediately. They pack a lot of tables/seats inside, so there's not too much space between tables. You'll be nice and cozy with your neighbors. The lunch buffet is $15/person--very well-worth in my opinion! The food selection is great. I loved their fish, lamb, chicken, and curry/sauces (of course). Oh, and rice. Can't forget about the rice. I think at the end I was basically just getting hella rice and trying out the different sauces. Delicious!! Nothing was too spicy, or really spicy at all, actually. The flavor in everything was amazing, though. Gotta love Indian spices. I had 2 full plates of food. Not bad at all for $15. And if I was smarter about my choices and didn't fill up so much on rice, it would have been even more worth. But who am I kidding, rice and curry/sauce is what I live for when it comes to Indian cuisine. Will definitely be back! Will probably try their take-out option as well at some point.", "author": "Ashley Y."}

No where on your website does it mention your another location. Try going to your website and clicking on \"Location\" (Singular not Plural), you will see only one location there. Better yet, go on google and type in your business name to see how many locations come up. Thank you for offering me the refund but i'm not looking for free food or my money back.

I would not recommend this place for any North Indian looking to have some good food. I ordered some mix vegetable Jalfrezi with side of diced green chilies, forget getting the order right and caring about the customers special request, they literally made the curry taste like it was frozen vegetables boiled in hot water and topped it off with some red chili sauce. Curry had \"0\" flavor whatsoever, no masala or anything whatsoever. I have never tried such blad type of curry in my entire stay in Bay Area. This by far has been the worst food that I have ordered and so was the customer \"online order,\" I don't get how you can mess up online order that's in clear english writing in front of you. If it was placed over the phone or in person and someone couldn't speak clearly, I would have understood if the order was wrong but come on this is an online order. Also, their \"nan\" are actually thick \"roti,\" not truly naan so don't get fooled with those breads with your order.\n\nI wish there was a way to rate less than 1 but since yelp only allows 1 being minimum than that's what they get from me.", "author": "Harsh V."}

The first thing you notice is that it's a restaurant trying to look nice with the veneer of white table clothes, but look a little closer and you see stains on the clothes and a floor that looks like they just schemer the food around, leaving a greasy slime covered look. \n\nThe next disappointment were the simple drinks we ordered, a coke and ice tea. The tea wasn't even \"as good\" as Lipton and the coke was flat and came in a glass with food crumbs on the bottom. \n\nThe Aloo Ghobi tasted like they had kept the Cauliflower a little too long. I got the Lamb Vindaloo, which should be a joyous expression of Indian curry full of flavor, spice and heat and it was none of those things. It wasn't hot or spicy and it was just OK enough to eat, my wife couldn't eat her Ghobi. The garlic naan was decent.

Towards its North are the Himalayas which define the boundary between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau. \n\nI've been meaning to drop by this place for lunch for a while now, and finally got the chance to last week.  Let me preface by saying that I certainly felt I was lost in North India after my dine-in experience here.\n\nAfter entering the restaurant, I had to wave down someone to seat us.  Of course, we were seated at a table directly under the sunlight, so I asked if we could be seated at the empty table across from us.  The hostess said it wouldn't be a problem and told us to get our food first.  After shuffling through the buffet line, we ventured to our \"assigned\" table and to my surprise, another hostess had seated another group.\n\nAt that point, we just went to sit wherever there was an open table, and of course, there weren't any utensils so we had to flag down a waiter for forks and knives.  It wasn't until halfway until the meal that someone came by and offered us some water.  After going for seconds, we come back to our table to find that my coworker's forks/knife was taken away.  After asking for another pair, waiter #1 proceeded to cuss out waiter #2 in Punjabi (I think...? or some other native Indian language).  By that time, my coworker and I just blankly stared at each other, totally confused.  It took them another 10 minutes to give us another set of utensils.\n\nFor the actual food, their chicken is extremely tender and the naan is freshly cooked; options are limited for the lunch buffet though but can't complain about the price.  Service is non-existent and makes you feel lost like you're in the Himalayas, but the tandoori chicken and other spices are worth trying if you want a cheap lunch option in FiDi.", "author": "Kevin C."}

One bit of advice though -- lines can get long during the lunch rush so it may be a good idea to head over a bit early or later so you're not waiting 20 minutes.", "author": "Grant S."}

Their garlic naan was perfect though (off the menu) but their lassi was way too heavy.\n\nIf you're not wanting to take the time to dine in or go for the buffet, they have a cheap take out lunch option.

The obviously not-fresh papadum and more potato than anything veggie pakoras we received as starters didn't give me too much hope.\n\nHowever my doubts were happily proven wrong the second our mains arrived. We got Chicken Korma and Bengan Bartha. I was surprised with how wonderful the consistency of both curries were--not too watery, not too thick, just perfect velvety fluidness. Moreover, korma was very flavourful and chicken meat used was very good. I would have liked my Bengan Bartha hotter and did ask for it to be spicy but I guess the waiter may have got the wrong idea about our spice tolerance; still, flavour was spot-on and texture was pleasant. We also ordered garlic naan on the side and it was so good that we ended up ordering another. I was also surprised at how fast the orders came, especially given how good and well-prepared they were.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely my favourite North Indian restaurant in SF and the first place I'll go if I ever crave curry while in the city.", "author": "Bengisu K."}

You can choose lamb or chicken tikka masala and one of two vegetable dishes (which seem to rotate), or just go with the $5 vegetarian option. \n\nThe lamb is good, but it costs an extra dollar and is harder to chew. I recommend the chicken because as my coworker says, \"the lamb is not quite $1 better, plus the chicken is in nice bite-sized pieces.\" The chicken tikka masala is quite tasty and has just enough flavor and spice to get your nose slightly runny, but not enough to make you cry. \n\nThe lunch boxes are really filling, and maybe a bit rice-heavy. If you don't have a big appetite plan to take some home for dinner.\n\nIf you'd like to get takeout for lunch but are sick of sandwiches and sushirrito, North India's takeaway \"back door\" is a great option.

After all... tomorrow is another day.\" Well, fiddle-dee-dee, I didn't know Miss Scarlett done up and changed Tara to North India Restaurant. It must have happened after the credits. Tara was actually a fairly low-key Thai restaurant that had two dishes I liked and ordered often, the Hainan Chicken and the Prawn Mango Green-Papaya Salad. But that business done gone with the wind. Lawzy, we gots to have a doctor. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies. But I do know standout Bhindi Masala when I have it. Ever been to a hole-in-the-wall called Alhamra? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn, but North India ain't no Alhamra, Miss Scarlett.\n\nJamie W. and I gave it a try after work and had no trouble getting a table since the place was empty except for two other couples between whom we were strategically placed despite the fact that empty tables abound in the large space (photo: http://bit.ly/XZVKUg). The complimentary Papadum (normally $2) was a nice touch even if it didn't come with any condiments (photo: http://bit.ly/1wIxe66). We decided to share two dishes, the first being the $14.95 Lamb Korma, a paucity of tender lamb chunks drowning in a sea of yogurt and cream sauce topped with almond slices (photo: http://bit.ly/1x57cgt). No kick at all, none expected. The second dish was our old standby, the $11.95 Bhindi Masala (photo: http://bit.ly/1mH2ZMs). The okra was plentiful enough, but they were rather on the dry side with the chopped onions barely there and the cilantro way too abundant on top.\n\nWhatever Indian spices were in the dish were nondescript. It was a miss. We asked for the rice with peas, two servings of the Pulao (photo: http://bit.ly/1vb2kSR), which turned out to be too much. I wish the waiter would have offered some opinion on that to steer us in the right direction. The $3.95 Kabuli Naan turned out to be more dessert-like since it was filled with fruit and nuts (photo: http://bit.ly/1sVHJzk). No complaints from me though, I thought it was pretty tasty. It also didn't stop us from ordering dessert since they were the only bargain that evening, $3.50 each. I tried the Kheer, which was a decent handling of traditional rice rice pudding (photo: http://bit.ly/1mqg6Bj), while Jamie had the Coconut Ice Cream which was marred by over-freezing (photo: http://bit.ly/1uBKLe5).

I can't really describe why not as good, perhaps it was not as creamy, perhaps it is the spices. The veggie samosa appetizer was super spicy and I mean super, but overall good flavor, perhaps slightly overcooked. The naan bread and rice pudding were decent, but the chai was excellent.

The meat in the Chicken Tikka Masala and Rogan Josh (lamb curry) were tender and fresh but a bit dry on the inside (perhaps they would've been better cut into smaller pieces). The sauces they came in were delicious though, especially slathered over some garlic naan. I found myself wishing it came with more sauce and less meat!

Not the best first impression.\n\nMy sister placed an order for a sizzling lamb dish (the name I can't recall) and I opted for the lamb curry, extra spicy. After over 40 minutes of waiting our food came out. In all of my visits to an Indian restaurant I have never not been served rice or naan (dosa, etc. as a side) to eat my entree with. In this case--- nothing. Just a bowl full of meat. Perhaps he wasn't done bringing the order out.... so I waited 5 more minutes.... Nothing. So I ask him if my lamb curry comes with either rice or naan. He shrugs and mumbles something inaudible. I am assuming he put in an order of rice so I wait another 10 minutes. By now, both of our lamb dishes are getting cold waiting for something to eat it with. I try to make eye contact with the waiter to check on the status several times in an empty restaurant, without success.  Hungry and feeling ignored, I get up to walk to the counter of this empty restaurant, and ask him again if he could bring out naan OR rice to accompany our meal. He says ok and I wait 5 more minutes. Finally, he returns with BOTH naan and rice... and charges me extra for BOTH. To make matters worse, I was starving at that point and the lamb was cold and dry as can be. \n\nA plus would be that they have a check-in offer. But even that can be a hassle to redeem a % off of your meal. Neither my sister nor I live in San Francisco (so we had never been to this restaurant before) yet he interrogated us about whether we redeemed this offer already. Pretty disappointing experience. And I usually just love Indian food!", "author": "Helina G."}

(Asking, for real, cause I'm not sure.) Even when the delivery destination is a hotel room, you would think, right? Someone please let me know. \n\nOther than that, and a slight wait (it was dinner time, so not the biggest deal) the spicy Saag Paneer really needed the mellow rice to make it the fantastic dish that it was. Sure, I ate a lot of it alone, but damn, I wanted the whole experience here. Naan and samosas were good and had excellent flavor was well, but it didn't take away that overall disappointment. (We ordered 4 entrees, 3 types of naan and samosas and spent around 80 bucks, and we were introducing a friend to her first Indian food experience. \n\nSuper sad about the entire thing, so wanted to give you delivery order-ers a heads up, so you could avoid the womp womp and enjoy the meal as it was meant to be. \n\n(And pretty sure, I ordered from this place last year, and there wasn't this issue, so not sure if I just misread, or what.)", "author": "Allie A."}

Each curry flavor came in unlabelled plastic containers, causing headache and unwanted taste tests to figure out which was which. The naan bread pieces were not only soggy but were small too. No other side dishes came with the order, meaning the ratio from curry vessel to curry was /way/ off. Additionally, the chicken that I ate (Bombay Chicken) was dry and grainy. Frankly, it was a task to finish my meal and I am left extremely dissatisfied especially considering we paid an average of $13-14 per dish.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the takeout was disorganized, the meals were badly designed, the chicken was meh, and the dishes were overpriced considering what you get.

The lunch special was $6 and I think there was a choice between chicken or lamb (maybe also a vegetarian option) which is only ~$4 less than the buffet. If I had the time (and didn't have to go back to work), I would've tried the lunch buffet...\n\nPros:\n- Chicken tikka masala was good. Hearty, lots of chicken.\n- Great price point. $6! (Though a tiny bit annoying that they don't include tax, like their competitor Mefhil). \n\nCons:\n- Operational inefficiency. Granted, they had only been open a week or so when I went, but it took about 15 minutes to get my takeout and there were only two people ahead of me.

We arrived at 7 PM on a Thursday and there was no wait!  First thing I observed was that this was a pretty versatile ambiance. Indoor tables were elegant and great for business dinners/first dates, but you can opt to sit outside for a more casual environment! There was a Buy One Entree Get Second for 50% off coupon after we checked in so my friend and I feasted like hungry hippos. We ordered Garlic Naan, Baingan Bharta (Eggplant), Chicken Tikka Masala and Karahi Gosht (Lamb) and ended up with a sizeable amount of leftovers. \n\nOne aspect that stood out tremendously was the service. Water glasses were always filled and waiters constantly asked us if we needed anything. My friend and I had dinner for 3.5 hours and did not feel rushed at all by the staff even though the restaurant was about to close. Our waiter even provided us complimentary coconut ice cream! (Thanks Cooldeep!!!) \n\nI definitely want to try the lunch buffet if I'm ever in the City for lunch!", "author": "Erika L."}

The biggest issue with their food is the blend of spices; throwing a ton of turmeric into a dish does not make it 'Indian food.' The best Indian foods are made from a blend of spices that are rarely used in Western cuisine and impart a wonderful blend of flavors to the tongue. Instead I found myself tasting turmeric over and over in each of the dishes I tried - biryani, tikka masala and the channa masala.\n\nAdd in the unimpressive price point and some serious price gouging for the food accoutrements and you end up with a place I will not be returning to. After all, who charges $3 for a small container of raita or $5 for a piece of naan?!? I get that the SF price point will always lean on the absurd, but those prices are simply a naked cash grab.

I found North India to be slightly overrated as the food was poor to average quality. I came around 7:30 pm with 5 friends, and the place was reasonably full. We ordered the paneer makhani, the vegetable jalfrezi, and the chicken tikka masala. I am vegetarian, so I stuck to the paneer and the jalfrezi. The paneer dish was just passable (most paneer dishes are). The portion was a little on the small side, and the gravy that constituted much of the dish lacked depth of flavor. The jalfrezi was truly miserable--it was just a bunch of mixed vegetables that were cut too large and didn't taste very good/fresh. We ordered garlic naan on the side, which was below average. It looked a lot like garlic bread in that the naan was covered in yellow in the center part of the bread slice. \n\nService was decent.

Man on the phone was very rude and said, \"come. Is up to you.\" Well wife and I went there. We were the only customers. From guy at front desk to servers (except a young guy that serves plates and water) all are rude and have no smile on their faces. May be because its 10pm - well than don't keep longer hours than you have to or greet with a warm welcome and not lamented faces.\n\nFood: food quality is 2.5/5 - average. Yes, i do mean it as a person of indian origin who has not eaten indian food for the first time. Quantities are large but quality is average.\n\nAsked to have rice and naan packed as one of my sons did not eat there and we knew he would eat a bit later. Got all packed together (yes naan slapped on top of rice). I have never seen anything like that before. I guess they were just trying to save money by putting all unpacked foods in one container. Awesome job.\n\nPrice: about the same as other indian restaurants. \n\nOverall: 2 out of 5 stars\n\nWill I return again: absolutely NOT.\n\nReasons: rude staff, no warm welcome, sad to see customers come at 10pm when claiming to be open till 12am. Food is average and sloppy job packing the left overs. \n\nPS: thank you that server who gave us water and plates as you were the only one that kept a good smile on and thanked us for being there.\n\nPSS: find a different place to eat, yelpers.", "author": "Puja H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-20", "description": "FYI: The decent reviews are probably for the food - not for the customer service. If you have a lot of time.. like a lot of time.. and don't want to engage in conversation with the wait staff, give this place a try. \n\nI was led to this place after doing some yelp search and was super disappointed. \n\nAmbiance: Not bad. Dimly lit, one long stem rose and small candle on the table, cushions for the wall seating. As soon as you walk it, you get hit with the smell of fish..... o_o I don't like fishy smell but hey, maybe you do. \n\nCleanliness: Didn't feel too gross but I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place I've dined at. \n\nFood:  \n\nVeggie samoas - 2 for $4.95. They're a little smaller than tennis balls. You can  taste the different spices but it wasn't freshly made. I could definitely tell they were pre-made a while ago - the fried-ness wasn't fresh. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - not bad but very creamy. Got it with mild spiciness but didn't have a hint of spiciness. \n\nChicken Vindaloo - Description said it was spicy but wasn't spicy at all. This was ok but I preferred the tikka masala. \n\nGarlic Naan: Got two large pieces - put them together and you have a sheet of standard printer paper. Both were smothered with butter and cilantro. Kinda tasted like they've been out for a while too. \n\nPualo - basmati rice with peas. Maybe 5 peas? I'm pretty sure the peas are there to add some color. Rice was out for a while - I eat and cook rice quite often and know what old rice tastes like. Rice was kinda hard bc it was a bit dry. Ew. \n\nCustomer service - SUCKED. Made the entire dining experience HORRIBLE. Walked in and no one acknowledges us. Restaurant is maybe 35% full so not sure what the delay was. Stood around for about 5mins and the worker who delivered the food sat us down at a corner table. Sat down, looked at the menu, hung out for 10 minutes... and the water boy came to fill our water cups. Drank some water, sat some more, stared into space, thought about pizza, people watched through the window as the workers just walked right by.. Mind you, there was one table next to us but they had already gotten the check so in our area, we're really the only 'active' customer. Finally asked the water boy if he can take our order. He pointed to a man wearing all white. The man wearing all white came and took our order. No hello, no greeting, no smile.. fine, maybe he's having a bad day. Veggie samoas came out in literally a minute. I was surprised but go figure- they were pre-made. Tikka masala, vindaloo, rice, and naan came out in 5 mins. One plus is the food comes out really fast. I'm used to my waiter coming around and asking how everything is. Didn't get that from the man dressed in white but whatever. Fortunately, everything was fine. Towards the end of our meal, another couple was sat right next to us. The man dressed in white came right away, greeted them with smile, made small talk. Their food also came out fast and though we ordered the same rice, theirs were double the size of ours. The man dressed in white even asked them how everything was as soon as their food came out. What's up with that? Anyways, finished eating and again, waiting around. No one came around so my friend and I tried to figure out the organizational structure of the staff. Man dress in white is clearly someone in charge. He's the only one that really 'interacts' with the customers. There is one guy who always delivers the food from the kitchen. There's another guy who is in charge of filling the water cups. Let me tell you - this guy takes his job VERY seriously. I take a sip and he's right there waiting to fill my cup. There's another guy who is mainly responsible for cleaning the tables and setting them up. They're all very hard workers. Unfortunately, the laziest one is the one who interacts with the customers. After figuring out all of this, we waived down the water boy to get the check. The man dressed in white came and I flashed my coupon from yelp (check-in and you get 50% off a second entree after 3pm). H came back with the check and we were thankfully out of there. \n\nI think we spent more time waiting for the staff than eating. Wouldn't ever come here again. Food was alright but oh man, the customer service was non-existent. It doesn't hurt to smile, ya know.", "author": "Esther C."}

I was alone, and he tried to sit me at the bar when there was ample seating. I declined, so he gave me a table with a chair facing a wall. I declined that too and he was pretty upset. He snatched the other place setting and took off. All I could think of is Whateeeever! You just lost your tip. I went up just twice since I wasn't wild about the food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-22", "description": "I went to North India Restaurant with some friends, partially because the wait at the place across the street was too long, but we left feeling very happy that we went. We were greeted at the door by a server, and entered into a well-decorated space, complete with a fresh rose on each table. There was nice Indian music playing in the background, and it was the perfect volume, decently loud, but still quiet enough to carry on a conversation. \n\nService was very prompt and our drink and appetizer order was taken as soon as we appeared ready. We ordered a sweet lassi, a chai, samosas, and fish tikka, all of which were very tasty. I love how they served the accompanying samosa chutneys in miniature pitchers; this made them very easy to share and enjoy between three people. The fish tikka was unusual because it was fried, but it was well-seasoned. My chai was sweetened perhaps a bit too much, but the milkiness was lovely.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered navratan korma, lamb jalfrezi, dal, and garlic naan. The food came out fairly quickly after we finished our appetizer, and I appreciated that they took care to space the two courses. The presentation of the food was appetizing as well, and each dish had a sprinkle of garnish on top. The navratan korma had a pleasing gravy, with slivered nuts and an assortment of veggies. The creaminess was just right. We asked for medium spicy, but in the future I would probably request the dish to be hotter, as the gravy was still fairly mild.  While the lamb jalfrezi had a delicious sauce (similar to rogan gosht), the meat was served a bit too chewy for my taste. The dal was flavored with generous amounts of ginger, onions, and garlic, and was our favorite of the dishes that we ordered.\n\nThroughout the meal, the service was very attentive, so much so that I must have drank ten glasses of water! The server also checked on us to inquire how we were enjoying our meal and to ask if we needed any other items. When we were ready to leave, they brought us the check along with three (free) gulab jamun. So tasty! The gulab jamun were bite-sized, cardamon scented, and served piping hot. \n\nI would definitely return to North Indian restaurant to try out other items and to take in the ambience.", "author": "Mars W."}

We went to try their $11.99 Lunch Buffet and were very satisfied with good varieties and the decadent taste of food here. The green sauce on the Buffet table is really hot but it perks up the flavor of the food with good kick!  The ambience is modern, clean with nice natural lighting. Service is great. Love the Masala Chai (Indian tea) which is so aromatic and not so sweet. The Kheer dessert is the well-adjust to the modern palette as it is not sweet like other Indian desserts I've tried. A relax and enjoyable time in North India. Great value for money!", "author": "Jintana C."}

I guess the management ate it all so they were figting in the back for who get to use the restroom first.\n\nAnyways, after waiting for about 45 mins we wish to speak to the manager (who never showed up). Might be still using the restroom. 10 mins later we decided to call quit and not wait further. So I walked up to the manager (who by that time was done with his business in restroom) and ask for the check. \nTo my surprise, there were no aplogies and the check was for $100. Wow!! This is the costliest beer of my life $100 + 15% tip (which I added because of a good habit. I regret it later though..:))\n\nWorst restaurant at such a good location.

There was nothing stand out, but it was decent food - especially for the price. However the service was awful to the point of being laughable. We were told they were open still for lunch at 2pm and thought we were making it easy on them to just have the buffet. \n\nThen right after we sat down with our first plate, a waiter came over and told us they were shutting down the buffet and needed to get anything else we might want before they do. We didn't yet know if we wanted anything else, so took about 5 minutes to eat what we had in front of us and they came over again to tell us the buffet was shutting down - which was really annoying for a first experience. \n\nAlso, numerous times we felt like the staff were hovering and trying to rush us out of there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-22", "description": "I really like North India - the food, the music and the general ambiance is very ethnic. My majority experience with them has been around the lunch buffet time, and that's what this review is about.\n\nMy single biggest concern is their hygiene. From the plates to the silverware, everything feels like it's gone through a car wash, rather than a dish wash. You can pick up any plate or spoon, at random, and you'll, without fail, notice spit stains or chipped corners. Even the cola is flat, and perhaps out of a bottle that was opened in the previous century. That's the only piece that makes the experience unsavory.\n\nI know this isn't a fine dining restaurant, as such, but I am surprised that they get by during the inspections. Don't get me wrong - it's not teeming with bacteria - and maybe I am being overly pedantic. But I'd pay you a dollar if you don't notice the stains on your cutlery or the paint off your plates.\n\nOther than that, their lunch buffet is very generous and worth the money. The restaurant is packed to the brim between 1230 and 2 pm, so choose your entrance wisely.\n\nI really wish they paid attention to hygiene. It's not a one off experience - it is a trend.", "author": "Adi M."}

We had to ask several people for a box for our leftovers before someone acknowledged us.

Everyone in the restaurant was confused, including some of the staff.\n\nThe food itself was quite nice. It's another situation where I would give at least 3/4 stars if not for the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-06", "description": "In a city offering a lot of good choices for delicious Indian and Pakistani food, North India Restaurant is one of the very best.  The naan is perfect: not too stiff, baked to the right consistency.  Lovely!  Tandoori fare is mouth watering, melt in your mouth fantastic: chicken tikka kebab, prawns, fish, are full of flavor; spiciness at the right hotness, we chose \"medium\" and that is exactly what we got.  Samosas were great.  Someimes samosas can get soggy, not these.  Chai tea and sweet lassi were also right on point, tasty.  Delivery driver was courteous and friendly.  Fairly fast delivery for a dinner order.  All in all, quite pleased with North India Restaurant.", "author": "Alex C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-07", "description": "I was visiting San Francisco so we came here to have dinner. We chose this place because it wasn't as busy as some other Indian restaurants and it seemed to be geared towards a fancier outing. The d\u00e9cor was nice, the silverware and glassware were geared more towards a fine dining atmosphere than the traditionally casual Indian restaurants. \nThe food was good, not great, but definitely not bad. I used the Yelp check-in offer of a free entr\u00e9e, so that was a plus. The issue I had was with the employees. On more than one occasion, there was an individual who would stare directly in your eyes as he walked by. I'm not talking about a glance...it was a full on unwavering stare as he walked about 10 paces either toward us or pass us...very awkward. To make it worse, we were seated directly next to the host's area next to the entrance, and while we were eating, about 4 or 5 of them huddled over the host's podium, speaking in Indian, and would occasionally look at us, then go back to talking. It made for a very awkward dinner, especially since we were the ONLY occupied table in the restaurant. Furthermore, the employees proceeded to eat their own dinner in the walkway of the bathroom, meaning you had to break up their feast and walk inches away from their food and where they were sitting in order to access the bathroom. I understand it was 8pm, empty, on  Friday (what does that tell you?) but they should've eaten elsewhere.\nNow the employees were not rude, mind you. I believe they were trying hard to do their job the best they knew how. The issue, I think, is they are simply inexperienced and don't know what is considered acceptable in a restaurant.  I think with some proper training and rules, they can win back some business, but for now I will go somewhere else to eat.", "author": "McKay W."}

Loved sitting next to the glass and not stuffed into a room with deep carpets n heavy curtains to eat rich food. Glass on both sides as we had a corner table in the best corner of the restaurant. Great as this gave an open feeling without the chill of outdoors.\nMy husband and I ordered a thali that says it feeds 2 people. But it really serves 4 people we think. Big portions. Raita could be more though. It had about 4 veggies/curries and rice and bread, along with starters and dessert - all at $44. They changed some of the dishes in the combo to veg for us on request. After eating here we had to walk about quite a bit to work off the amounts we had consumed. Phew...\nThe people next to us got a sizzler.. hissing, crackling and hot from the kitchen... spewing steam. You might want to ask the waiters about that dramatic dish.\nWill be returning here.. with more people to do the eating :) Also will be asking them for some lightly cooked veggie food so that I can cheat on my diet but not cheat that big. One of our dishes - spinach saag had a good amount of cream in it I think.\nAnd yes, if they don't give it to you on their own, ask for the complimentary chutneys - mint and tamarind that really add nice flavors to the food :)\nThe waiters were really courteous, and sorta chill which I like at Indian restaurants.. not overly enthusiastic which is nice.\nOn our way out we noticed a sign that said - Lunch Box for $5. I think that may totally be worth a try!\nAnd did I say I loved the balance of this place.. not overly fine dining. But not casual. So.. perfect IMO. Elegant, not hoity-toity and good food :) Even the ethnic women paintings on the walls (a staple at all Indian restaurants) had simple lines and were not making one plunge deep into rural India just because you were out to eat Indian food. Loved the lightning too. Just correct.\nMy husband and I were thinking that you could do a date night here if you wanted to explore Indian food.. and mainly because it leaves you so satiated and pleased.. it is sure to help the date as well :) The ambiance totally works for a date night too. Soft, glowy, and intimate-ish with a bar. Order the thali n you will feat like you are doing an Asterix feast.\nNext time I go.. I'll be looking for lighter cooked veggies.. fresh and seasoned n not creamed n curried much. hope they have that! :)", "author": "Malvika B."}

We got a table right away but there were people waiting right behind us. The line to get to the lunch buffet was literally all the way to the door. This could either mean, the food was super good and fresh ( since they'd have to constantly replenish to feed so many people) or very slow service. Turns out it was the first one! Food was super yum and fresh out of the tandoor! ;)\nWe heaped as much as possible in the first round only coz there was no way I was standing in a line this long for a second serving!\nThe naans especially were fresh and steaming hot! The waiters even came to the tables with fresh garlic naans. The kheer  ( rice pudding) was yum too.\nAs for the flavors, they weren't overpoweringly indian and spicy for my Irish friend and yet as a north indian, i was happy and satisfied!

Service was patchy, no cuttlery at our table despite there being 3-4 servers wandering around. No server to be found when I was looking for salt & pepper to enhance my meal either. We ordered the chicken tikka marsala & the rogan josh. Two standard indian meals and the rogan josh was really underwhelming for a medium spice level. The chicken tikka had much better flavor but was still just missing some amazing layers of indian spices.

They do a ton of business during lunch, so much so that it's hard to find a place to sit down and eat.  Because they're so busy, they're constantly making fresh food that's absolutely delicious.  For lunch, they had a huge assortment of options, and everything was great.  Total cost was around $15 incl. tax.  Took a long time to pay because they were so busy, but that's the only negative I can cite.

First off, I am a repeat customer because their food is always fantastic. I am a customer for life because their staff and service is one in a million. One night as I was caring for my niece and nephew, I ordered Tikka Masala, Prawn Biriyani, Garlic Naan, and a Mango Lassi to be delivered to my home. After I made the phone call I realized my 3 year old nephew was acting strange and he then began to have a seizure. I rushed him to the hospital and as you can presume, had forgotten about the food. Norman, the wonderful man who took my order called me to check in (as his driver had arrived to an empty home) and listened to me hysterically cry over the phone. He told me not to worry, family first, and that they would leave the food for when I returned and I could pay later (I was supposed to pay cash upon delivery). Days pass and I had completely forgotten, he never badgered me for money, he never was unkind to me, he was only compassionate and understanding up until the day I called to complete payment. This place is spectacular in more ways than culinary experience and I promise you will never leave dissatisfied. Thank you for your kindness, Norman.", "author": "Natalie G."}

I went around the back and waited in the line. I have to say off top that being an African American and being told to go to the back to get my food struck a nerve with me. So here I am waiting in the back like some slave or someone only allowed in the colored section. And of course people of every nationality were in the lines but I still didn't like the feeling. They wouldn't let anyone step in the actual restaurant just had us standing there while a server blocked the entranceway and took orders. I think it is terrible service to serve food through a back entrance and not even let them step foot in the restaurant. Just because we are not spending an exorbitant amount doesn't mean we shouldn't get good service. Anyway the food was not good to top it all off.", "author": "Jenn G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-29", "description": "The food is good here. The problem is the service. My wife and I came in around 1 pm and ordered the buffet - sort of pricey for a buffet, but okay. At that point in the day, they were low on several things in the buffet. We figured they would replenish for our second trip back. Our second trip - there was no rice. and the sauces and a few of the dishes were very low. As well, they were still inviting people to order the buffet as they came in. My wife asked for more rice, so a waiter gave her a dish of white rice (rather than just replenish the buffet supply, which is what she meant for him to do) - much more than both of us needed. \n\nWe finished up, and since there was so much rice left over, my wife asked for a to-go box, which the waiter brought. That elicited a visit from the manager/owner. My wife explained that the rice was just going to be thrown away, but he jabbered 'If I did this for everyone, I would be out of business.' He went away, and I thought all was over. I paid a tip that was too much for what we got in return, and left. The bill that went to the credit card company included an extra buck, I suppose 'for their trouble.' This was after I signed the form. We could fight, but it is not worth the time, and we threw out the receipt anyway. \n\nWe will not be going to this place again - there are others that might not sell buffet lunches when there are only remnants left in the dishes.", "author": "Steve D."}

Not so much of a problem if you have a bunch of people sharing but a problem if you're a single diner.  A bigger problem was the incompetent service -- we ordered 5 things and the waiter totally forgot two of them, first the wine and then one of two main dishes -- which by the time we realized that he might have just forgotten it, we had to rush through eating and were still slightly late for our meeting to attend following the meal.  Further, no real apology let alone an offer of some courtesy compensation such as an appetizer or dessert or even something to nibble while we sat and waited.   They were also reluctant also to turn down the loud TV, let alone off, though, at the time we asked, the four of us were the only customers -- presumably because the staff wanted to watch  !

Unlike all the hipster Indian food joints in the city, North India Restaurant is a more typical fare (as it's lackluster name clearly suggests) - north indian curries, assorted varieties of Naans and a white-tablecloth, Indian paintings on the wall decor etc etc. I liked the variety and quality of the food. Not oh-my-god-this-is-so-delicious but also not this-is-awful. Just good enough for me to want to come to this place again. In terms of specific menu items, I thought that the veggie pakoras were fantastic, the Garlic Naan was spot-on (complimentary offerings with the buffet) and the Coconut Ice-cream was a nice little icing on the cake. One thing I really liked was  the fact that none of the veggie curries were too rich. They were neither dripping in oil nor smothered with butter nor exaggerated with spices.

Then before she returned with the check a third person came by and deposited a small bowl of rice pudding saying it was complimentary.

Saag Paneer was full of tasty cubes of cheese in a smooth pur\u00e9e of fresh bright spinach.  The chicken Vindaloo had a fresh, homemade tomato based sauce with just the right blend of spice and heat.  Not too hot and no unusual bottled red color.  It was also packed with boneless chicken and just a few potatoes.  Unlike lesser places that offer just the opposite.  Even the simple Basmati rice was cooked with great care and attention.  It's nice to eat in a place were the kitchen take pride in their work as evident by everything we were served. The prices may be a dollar or two above the competition but well worth it.", "author": "Mike A."}

We went for dinner last night and were impressed with the food quality, the friendly waiters, and the lovely atmosphere.  We ordered butter chicken with spinach in a clay pot, Navratan Korma, naan, rice and a mango lassi.  Prices are reasonable, food is very very good, and portions are generous!  (Oh, and a tip -- \"medium\" is spicy with a nice heat, not too crazy.  Perfect for our taste.) We had enough to bring home to our grateful daughters.  Used the Yelp coupon -- thanks North India!  And thanks for the complimentary rice pudding (the best I've had).  We can't wait to come back and try the lunch buffet.  Our new go-to Indian restaurant.", "author": "Karen L."}
