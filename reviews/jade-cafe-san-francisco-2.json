Then I had another friend who usually has good taste in food mention that he liked the place, so I finally went and I'm glad I did!\n\nFood:\nThey had probably the best chicken chow mein I've ever had (and I always order chow mein). The noodles were the perfect texture and the dish wasn't super oily. I also ordered the BBQ pork fried rice, and it was yummy but I would've liked the pork to be a little crispier and I added extra soy sauce -- not a huge deal though, I'd definitely order it again. I also ordered the succulent spicy pork with garlic sauce, this was good but I always forget that the garlic sauce for this dish is supposed to be a little sweet so just an FYI -- I'll probably order a more savory/salty entree next time. Lastly, their chili sauce on the table was good and would go well with potstickers.\n\nCustomer Service:\nI don't understand why this place gets such a bad rep for customer service. The waiters were really nice and would fill up our glasses of water often. One of them also came by and asked us how the food was. When you dine at an authentic mom-and-pop Chinese restaurant, you shouldn't expect good customer service, but this place treated my party really well.", "author": "Wendy V."}

So I picked Jade Cafe on random from the many Chinese restaurants on Postmates. There's always a risk doing this, but sometimes you get something great - unfortunately this wasn't one of those times :( The hot and sour soup wasn't \"sour\" enough - that vinegar-y flavor was mission, and it just tasted like plain bland soup with a bunch of vegetables and tofu.

If you are a Chinese grown up in China, you will know how beef with oyster sauce supposed to taste. However, this dish had a very odd taste and it's nothing close to the original. Maybe the chef is from other China province, it's not too big of the deal. Couple days ago  I decided to give it another try, so I ordered BBQ pork with tofu for lunch assuming there is no way to F this one up. Guess what? I'm wrong. The BBQ pork tasted OK, but they managed to use tofu probably expired long ago and already turned sour. I'm OK due to I didn't eat any of the tofu, but my co-worker got sick after lunch.

The sweet & sour chicken were smothered in sauce, so I ended up trying to wipe some of it off, but the flavor itself was good. The beef in the noodle plate was very tender, the broccoli was cooked just the way I like it, not too crunchy but not too soft, and the noodles were also very crispy (except the parts that were soaked in sauce at the bottom of the plate.\n\nThis place is definitely very affordable ($23 for 3 people) and the portions are huge. The service was good, except one minor blip where they forgot our potstickers, but upon realizing that the dish was missing from our table, they immediately brought it out for us.

But largely it was the snottiness of the staff. I placed an order with Yelp online which would not seem to take. I called the restaurant to see if they had a record of my order. When I called, a women who spoke fluent English answered and told me they had no record of my order. I told her thanks anyway, but Inwas giving up for the time being. An hour later, I got a call from them. This time, the woman on the phone barely spoke English, and I am deficient in both Cantonese and Mandarin. But, aside from the language barrier, this woman was plain rude. She asked me why I hadn't come to pick up my order. I replied that I had been told there was no order and that, in any case, I'd wanted to elect delivery when I tried to set it up on Yelp. She argued that there was no address and I offered to give it. She then yelled at me: \"How I can deliver when there no address!!!\" Again, I gave her the address with the cross streets. A half hour later, a young man called and asked the cross streets again. I told him. Then he called again and told me to come downstairs from my apartment building to get the food (rather than ring the apartment buzzer I'd given). I did go down and I asked the young man of he's gotten the message after I had been told there was no order. Again, there was a language barrier and he began to argue with me. In all, the service was just plain lousy. The food was passable. Won't order from here again.", "author": "Luke A."}

As I remember, the primary place was the Chinese Kitchen (no longer in existence).  This food is the food we all ate in those days before food became viewed as an enemy; something to assess, control and hold at bay; we ate what we liked, even here in San Francisco.  We've become too \"gormet\" and eccentric now for a variety of reasons.  That being said; I also was a frequent customer of theirs since moving into this neighborhood 19 years ago.  I usually ate Orange Chicken and steamed rice.  I haven't ordered take out in years, and hadn't eaten their food in about 10 years, but recently was desiring my old usual dish.  I checked out Yelp, and was a bit taken aback by the negative comments.  After a few days, I decided last Tuesday afternoon (I'm retired now and at home) to order delivery anyway.  I got Orange Chicken, double steamed rice, Sweet and Sour Pork, and decided to try the String Beans and fried Tofu, so I'd have leftoevers, maybe to share with my brother.  I received a pork fried rice too, as a freebie.  I did it on the internet over Eat24 at @3:00.  My doorbell rang @25 minutes later, it was here.  Simon, the delivery guy, couldn't have been more polite and nice.  It was like he was my friend bringing me food. I asked about the owner, (with whom I was always friendly as well), by name (I don't want to say his name in this review) and was told he's still there.  I had so much food.  Today is Friday, and I just finished the last of it.  Those four dishes have been all I've eaten for 4 days, reheated in the microwave, and the leftovers were more flavorful and delicious than the first.  This is the kind of Chinese food that characterized San Francisco, except it's less greasy than those kind of dishes use to be.   I will certainly begin ordering deleivery from time to time, now. Thank you Mr. A, and thank you my new friend Simon, daytime delivery guy.  I'm glad you are here.", "author": "Donald W."}

He told me the food was okay and the place fills up in the evening with many of the patrons who work out at the 24 Hour Fitness located across the street.\n\nThese folks must be working out pretty hard to be able to enjoy a dining experience here.  The floors are filthy and the place is loud, but it's not the restaurant patrons who are making all the noise.  The waitress managed to carry on a very loud conversation in Cantonese with members of the kitchen staff as she took orders and served food to restaurant patrons.  I would not have minded had the conversation's subject been a bit more interesting other than family gossip.  I was trying not to think of how much of her spit was flying into people's food as she carried on her conversation and served the food.\n\nTaste-wise, the food was edible and the portions are a good size.  Think back to my days in elementary school when the \"cook's choice\" served up every Friday was a combination of all the leftover parts of the lunches served on Monday through Thursday.  I think that's what I got on my Deluxe Seafood Chow Fun.  Chow fun was not meant to be served this way ... along with the flat rice noodles, I found a few coils of rubbery calamari, a few bits of scallops, a couple of shrimp, a few chunks of imitation crab, some zucchini, half a button mushroom, two straw mushrooms, water chestnut slices, celery, onion chunks, bamboo shoots, one string bean, two florets of broccoli, bean sprouts, two black beans, a few pieces of green bell pepper, and a single carrot slice.  What happened here?  Did the cook not find any cockroaches to throw into my plate because I was certainly anticipating it?  \n\nTry not to look too closely at the wood paneling because you will find that the walls are not cleaned very well either, and there are actually food particles stuck to it.  Gross!  Stick with a can of Coke because that was probably the best part of my meal.  You don't know unless you experience it, and this restaurant is a bad experience.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

This place is so dirty that the restaurant's fish tank needed some seriously cleaning. With algae, green gunk and other filth, the kids wanted to see the goldfish, but not being able to with all those nasty and clouded debris visibly on the tank.\n\nFrom the menu, we ordered the $5.50 Chicken with Chinese Broccoli over Pan-fried noodles and an order of $3.50 Pot-stickers (Gyosa). The noodle plate was tremendously crunchy and oily; the chicken pieces were unusually sweet, but the vegetables were very crunchy with four stalks on our dish. The pot-stickers were ok, but nothing to get excited about. We each also got a bowl of a knockoff to the popular Westlake soup as our house soup, which was decent. We bought two cans of coke. I'm sure the taste of the soda doesn't change. \n\nSince it's my questionable decision to come here, I charged our sub par lunch with a $10.00 minimum, which surpassed that requirement on what we order.

So I decided to pop into Jade.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nI ordered the duck and rice combo. It was oddly inexpensive. One bite and I knew why -- my \"duck\" was 90 percent bone.

When I was finished, I was left with a large pile of inedible bird bone and a miniscule pile of actual flesh.

The decor is nothing special, for sure, but I don't always want to pay for fancy styling which is usually designed to make a place purposely loud.\n\nWent with five other co-workers for lunch and everyone was satisfied with their dish.

Nights, I have no clue.  \n\nI was a customer of Jade Cafe Geary 2005-2006 and Potrero Hill since 2006, because they were conveniently near my jobs.  I chose Geary in the first place because they had the best Broccoli Beef in the region, a dish which I use to gauge all Chinese lunch spots.  I ended up going back to Geary repeatedly because they make what I can't.\n\nThe other dish which is very well done is the tomato beef chow mein (or jeen mein/crispy noodle).  it USED to be a sopping sweet & sour noodle dish WITH tomato chunks, which is utterly annoying for someone who knows how to cook tomato beef, but they've changed the recipe to be a very good tomato dish.  Very good flavor that I can't replicate.\n\nThe only thing they lack is a peking spareribs dish, which is kind of hard to make well.  If you taste ketchup, get the hell out of there man cmon.  \n\nI don't bother ordering duck, because of the skimps.  There's NEVER a good portion of duck on a RICE dish!  kiddding me? novice or something...  Even noodle dishes are like that, and that's only my exp with Chinese lunch places.  GO BUY A POUND from the markets on Stockton/Sac and microwave it at home.  so much more worth it.  \n\nyes I'm Chinese, but I'm not the harshest critic.  I'll eat most anything if I'm impressed, lazy, or clueless as to how they got it to taste so damn good.  \"no msg?  You sure?? hmm...

Yes, I was suspicious, but what do I know about line speed? \n\nIt had shrimp, certainly, but on closer inspection, contained dozens of chicken particles and even quite large chunks. Kind of sick. I'd rather have waited and taken home what I could not consume, had my partner been impatient. \n\nThe main question-what if I'd ordered the chicken because I was allergic to shrimp? \n\nI'd recommend this place if you're on a budget and have no allergies. Nothing I've had there is too greasy, and it's four blocks away, so I give them another chance, but check it, 'cause that substitution was wak (and we paid for it, anyway). \n\nMaybe politeness is the wrong approach, in some cases.

The restaurant is especially busy so i can understand if there wasn't enough of the staff there to tend to everyone, but I was completely ignored for a good 10 minutes before a woman shoved hot tea onto my table and rudely took my order.  I'm still not one to have this place be a one star review in my head only because I feel like I should give them a decent chance at wowing me.  So I am patient and I sip on my tea while the clock is slowly ticking away on my lunch hour.\n\nMy food arrives hot and fast which was a nice change from the silence I was subjected to at the beginning of my meal.  I thought the rice smelled a little funny but my eyes opened wide at the sight of the plate that was set in front of me.  The colors were vibrant and the food looked fresh and crisp. I couldn't wait to get my hands on one of my sweet and sour chicken pieces. Glistening Chinese ecstasy enveloped my taste buds as I crunched down on the crispy chicken pieces. It finally had been done.  I had finally found the most unforgettable sweet and sour chicken in the city.  I was hooked and the service I received slowly became a mere memory until I actually sat down to write this review.  \n\nAll in all, I gave the place 3 stars and that was based on the entire experience.  I mean, I could figure out a way to make extra crispy chicken pieces covered in homemade sweet and sour sauce, but I go out because its convenient and I am paying someone to serve me the goods.  If I could base this review strictly on the food it would get a 5 star rating hands down, but unfortunately for me I believe good service is at least worth 2 stars of a 5 star review, Sorry Jade!

(just use chicken broth!  chicken broth makes everything taste good, damn it!)  it had a film of oil and was so greasy that in the end i just ate the plain ol noodles.\n\nsigh, it was so disappointing.  halfway through the bowl i actually contemplated not finishing it.  but alas, the bottomless pit won and i finished the bowl, sadder and angrier with each tasteless worthless bite.\n\ni paid and opened my fortune cookie.\n\n\"today is a good day to be spontaneous!\"\n\nso i walked down to mission hunan and got bowl #2.  \n\ni am a fatass.\n\n(! happy holidays !)", "author": "Helen L."}

I was told that Jade Cafe is a good lunch spot for \"good and cheap\" Chinese food.  The cheap part I agree with but the good part is a stretch.  The food is inexpensive and the service is fast which usually makes for a good lunch experience but the missing ingredient was good food.  The food wasn't bad but just really generic.  If I am going to eat heavy Chinese food, it has to be good otherwise I rather just pop a lean cuisine in the microwave at the office.", "author": "Josh K."}

I wouldn't take a date here or eat here if you do not plan on smelling like Chinese food when you leave however for the price and the quick turn around then this gets a good rating.

Jade cafe has a very scummy vibe and really hasn't updated it's look in all of the years its been open. Lets give it one star for being authenticaly a dive with dirty walls and floors and pictures that hang at an angle off the wall, tilting forward such that they look like they are ready to fall on your head.\nThe clientel are typically working class and people who don't look like they are critical of the cuisine. I guess I'm a snob. I like to enter a restaurant and not be treated like a criminal. From the moment I entered this dump, the ladies that take the orders were staring at me like I was lower class then the food they serve. When my order was ready, the waitress handed my food to me from an extended arm while looking away from me. Kind of like when you hand a bag of dog shit to someone you are disusted with. I interpreted it as Tattoo prejudice as I sometimes get the riff raff treatment from asian food establishments.\nI ordered the green beans and fried tofu which is bathed in garlic and MSG. What followed my meal was two trips the bathroom, stomach cramps, heart palpatations and dizziness. Jade was the color my skin turned after eating here. If you enjoy the smell of bleach while you eat....don't hesitate to dine here.", "author": "Go Cat Go G."}

I guess you just kinda seat yourselves, and the waitresses will get to you. It's a definite dive, not that clean with mismatching dishes. But the prices are quite affordable, and the food portions are pretty sizable. I usually get the fried squid with spicy salt...a little heat from the jalepeno, a little crunch from the fried batter. I have tried other items from the menu like black bean fish (unmemorable, bland). \n\nDon't actively seek this place out; I would only recommend it if you are in the area regularly and have to choose from the limited dining scene.", "author": "Andrew C."}
