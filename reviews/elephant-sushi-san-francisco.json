Both me and my dinner date felt like the rice had been overcooked, to the point where it wasn't fluffy but kind of mushy.  This made for really dense nigiri that felt a little clunky and off texturally.  The rice was also served a lot warmer than I'm used to, almost like it came right from the rice cooker.\n\nThe sea bass carpaccio was really nice and refreshing, but the sizzling sea bass roll was super overwhelming and drowning in sauce.  I liked the non-rice dished the most.  At the price we paid, I was just expecting a little more quality.  Would also like to see more variety in the nigiri section.\n\nTips and Tricks \n-Room at the bar when we went at 7:30 on a Thursday\n-Stick with the raw stuff, fire cooked rolls are just for show\n-Cute date spot, you can grab ice cream up the street or walk to Ghirardelli square", "author": "Jessica L."}

And if you order the Flaming Seabass, it will literally be on fire.\n\nElephant Sushi is a small (VERY small) sushi restaurant that fits the capacity of 49 people (says the plaque on the wall), although they try to squeeze as many tables as possible in the small establishment so this is not for the claustrophobic. \n\nThe first time I tried to come here, the waitress severely overestimated the wait time so I ended up at their competition nearby. This time around the wait was around 20-25 minutes on a rainy Thursday night so I decided to stick it through since it looked popular. \n\nFrom the outside you can already tell this is a cramped place. It was cold outside and the inside was humid from all the breathing humans. As soon as I walked in my glasses fogged. \n\nWe got seated at the bar and it was great seeing the jedi masters at work upfront and personal. It was a real experience. We were delightfully seated in front of the older jedi master and you can tell he had years of masterful experience compared to the spring chicken apprentices beside him.\n\nWe ordered the Flaming Seabass because every gringo table seemed to order that, so why not? This was for production purposes clearly. Also ordered the Ya Man Roll because how can you say no to something named Ya Man?\n\nThe Ya Man roll was a salmon topped roll with fried onions inside and a sprinkling of fresh green onions on top. It was tasty but my breath was just in deep remorse after as I couldn't get the onion flavor out!\n\nThe Flaming Seabass was delicious just as it was showy! Not completely sure what was inside but it was topped with seabass and the flames cooked it into a chewy perfection. The sauce was tasty but I think they put a little too much and the flames made the rice really soggy and chewy but somehow it just works!\n\nDefinitely coming back here again maybe on a non busy night (is that even possible?!?!?!?!!)\n\nWhen I saw at the bar I noticed they had 3 security cameras on one side and 1 security camera on the other in the front. Is there really a need for that much security presence in such a tiny space?\n\nAlso outside if you walk to your left theres a projector towards the wall projecting the restaurant's name.

The atmosphere was nice, if a little small, and the service was good, but the food was overpriced and surprisingly hit or miss. If you order the right dishes, I think this place could be phenomenal, but overall I wasn't very happy with the experience given the cost. I would recommend sticking to nigiri or sashimi and skipping the rolls. \n\nTHE GOOD: \n- Blue Fin Fatty Tuna: just order a bunch of this and you will leave happy. It was truly incredible. It melts in your mouth, and even at 25 dollars (for about 6 pieces) it's hard to feel like you've been cheated.\n- Uni-Tama: Uni with quail egg. It was not the best uni I've ever had but it was quite good, although overpriced for the quality at 16 for 2 pieces. \n\nTHE BAD:\n- White Out Roll: This hamachi roll didn't really come together. It included seared butterfish, cucumber garlic and truffle oil. It was a bit loosely rolled for my taste and the truffle oil felt superfluous; it dominated the flavor of the roll and didn't combine well with the hamachi.\n- Naked Scallop Roll: scallop, crab and masago, wrapped in soy paper... But, surprise, it was full of mayonnaise too, and that's pretty much all it tasted like. This roll was actually really bad. I love sushi and I couldn't eat it. \n\nOverall, Elephant might be worth a trip for the nigiri/sashimi but San Francisco has no shortage of sushi and you could find a better overall menu for your buck.", "author": "Benjamin S."}

Their flame rolls are awful.... However, we decided to give them another try. So we met up and were just gabbing, sharing a bottle of sake, & casually ordering items to share. We had just placed another order when the hostess came up to tell us we'd been there too long. Not once had anyone told us there was a time limit. We explained that this was awkward and that we had just ordered another item. So we told her \"Fine- we'll leave so please cancel our order & bring us the check\"... After paying we then asked to speak with the manager. We are now awkwardly standing in the middle of their tiny restaurant and it is becoming clear that NO ONE has any intention of coming to speak to us. We then walked to the door and I bothered the hostess and said that we weren't leaving until we spoke to the manager. Huge mistake!! A very aggressive man came out and identified himself as the manger/owner. We expressed how rudely we were treated by his staff, and his response was to tell us \"I don't care!! I'm busy!!

We sat down at 9pm, ordered all at once like our server asked us to, and by 9:21pm, we were handed a bill for $96.  Our server asked us to pay now, so she could close the register.  We had most of our food in front of us.  It wasn't enough that they had stacked up all the chairs on top of the tables around us to let us know they wanted us to leave- that just wouldn't have been a big enough hint on their part.  When I told them that they shouldn't have seated us if they wanted us out in 20mnts, it was like talking to a stone wall.  We paid $96, left in anger with most of our food still on the table, and had to listen to someone say \"thank you\" on our way out.  Incredible.  They just don't care at all.", "author": "peter d."}

It's sushi is good, above average but not extraordinary and priced medium/high, so not great value.\n\nWhy I'm writing a review is because of the service both times. It's the bottom I've experienced in SF. Hard to flag down severs, no return except to bring the food (eg, water, check ins) and the feeling of being rushed. Many reviews share this vibe. \n\nThe environment feels high energy because of how small it is. I won't go back because there's plenty of other above average sushi restaurants in the neighborhood that seem to value customers and make the experience a multiplier for the dining. \n\nIf you go to Elephant expecting poor service, you should meet or exceed expectations.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

The most important tip I have is to come RIGHT WHEN IT OPENS at 6!!! Or else, you may have to wait up to an hour for a table lol... \n\nAll of the sushi and rolls are super fresh! My favorites are:\n- White out roll (hamachi, avocado, and seared butterfish = match made in heaven!)\n- Ya man roll (salmon here is sooo buttery and goes great with the onion chips!)\n- Walu carpaccio/trufflle hamachi, both are delicious! Both are the same ingredients (truffle oil, fried garlic, ponzu, and scallions) but the fish is different. \n- Double albacore roll (sweet teriyaki and honey mustard sauces are yummy)\n- Flaming seabass roll (it's on fiyaaaa when it gets to your table--also the only \"baked\" roll)\n\nOn my most recent visit, I got to try the hello kitty martini, which has sake, soju, yuzu (japanese lime juice), lychee, and a maraschino cherry! This drink does not sound strong at all, but my bf and I actually got a nice buzz from it! It also had a tasty lychee flavor. I would order this again! The sake bombs sound fun too (and only $2), but keep in mind the beer glass is only 1/3 full haha.\n\nMy last thing to add is the great customer service here! All the waitresses are really friendly. I dropped one of my chopsticks at one point (i'm so embarrassing haha), and right when I looked up, I guess the waitress nearby heard it drop and she told me she would get me another one right away!!! My bf and I were so amazed at her hearing because it's pretty loud in the restaurant haha. Another example of their good customer service was when one of our rolls (double albacore) was taking a long time, and a waitress brought us a complimentary half portion of the hamachi truffle to say they were sorry for the wait! Super sweet of them. :-)\n\nI will definitely be back!", "author": "Tara A."}

The red and yellow was probably my favorite roll, I was a little worried the mango might take over the taste, but it was really subtle and made it even better.

If they had asked us upon arrival if our whole party was there, I would have completely understood that they wouldn't seat us.

Elephant sushi has been on my list for a while, so I was delighted when my sister and I both agreed to go here. \n\nThe Wait: We figured that there shouldn't be a big problem getting in at 6:30 on a Saturday for 2 people especially when it opens at 6, but there was already a 45 minute wait. @&$! I was already hungry on the way to hangry at this point but we decided to walk around the area and wait. I really like that they take your number and give you a call when a table is about to open up. The wait ended up not being that bad and we got a great seat at the bar, which is so fun.\n\nFood: 3 words- Sashimi Garden Salad! Originally we ordered the carpaccio as our starter, but after seeing the couple next to us get the sashimi salad, promptly changed our order to that. If you like poke, you'll love this! It's like a poke bowl with fresh vegetables-think kale, heirloom tomatoes, and more- with a delicious dressing. It's also a pretty large portion. One of the most creative, refreshing, filling, and delicious sushi items I've ever had! \n\nWe also got the red and yellow roll and the Giants roll. Both were delicious and fresh. The rolls here are pretty big and filling compared to other sushi places. 2 rolls + the sashimi salad was enough for the 2 of us to be full and just have enough room for gelato after. I think the red and yellow roll was over sauced though. Fish and ingredients this fresh don't need so much sauce to mask the flavors plus there's already so much going on that it didn't need so much sauce or even soy sauce or wasabi. \n\nService: Our waiter was funny and very down to earth. He took our order promptly, wasn't overly attentive but it was busy and the sushi chef was in front of us, refilled our water, and gave us the check quickly once we asked.  I also didn't feel rushed despite that there was a long wait so that was good.  The sushi Chef was awesome. \n\nHot tip: It's on United Mileage Dining so you can get airline miles while eating here! Points + sushi, two of my favorite things. Also sit at the bar for a more fun experience. \n\nOverall: No it's not authentic sushi, but who cares!? It's some of the most creative food and is yummy in my tummy. Delicious, fresh, really unique and creative, decent service, worth the wait!", "author": "Alison B."}

Needless to say, we left happy. The sashimi is the golden child - fish that literally melts in your mouth. Our favorite item was a toss-up between the trout and the scallops off of the sashimi plate.

There's some serious hustle going on to keep the line of people moving, so I wouldn't plan on staying here past an hour and a half or you'll start getting some heavy-handed hints.

The service was nice and quick even though they were extremely busy. We ordered the chips n dip ($10) which was spicy tuna, garlic pita chips, scallions & honey mustard sauce. It was a great combo of flavors and reminded me of ahi poke. Don't expect a large tray of chips though it comes with 4 small servings.\n\nFor the sushi we tried the Ya Man Roll ($12) which was salmon and unique flavors of fried red onion chips, pesto and ponzu.

They wrap the roll in aluminum foil in a dish with vodka and light it on fire for about 10 minutes to cook. It was super saucy and baked when it was done.

I think so. 2 hours? Maybe not. To kill time, we hopped on over to Swensen's across the street. The waitress even gave us hot tea to sip on while we waited on a chilly evening, which was a really sweet gesture.\n\nI saw tables of 4+ being quoted 2-3 hours around 6:30pm, but tables of two didn't have to wait more than one hour -- something to keep in mind if you're planning to come in with a larger group.\n\nOnce we sat down, we immediately ordered the White Out roll, Ya Man roll, yummy pocket, Himalayan trout, and sizzling sea bass. Of all the items, the white out roll was my favorite. The sizzling sea bass is fun to watch (who doesn't like fire?), but it honestly was kind of bland and didn't blow my mind. I don't think I would order it again. However, everything else was fresh and tasty.\n\nNote to self: If (WHEN) I go back to Elephant Sushi, I'll load up on the rolls. I'll come well before 6pm to snag a table. And I'll drink some sake bombs because they're only $2.", "author": "Valerie L."}

Then again we came on a Wednesday night at 8:06pm and was quoted only a 1 hour wait, which miraculously worked out to be exactly an hour. The hostess does an amazing job in getting down names, bussing tables, and trying to be realistic about the wait but just be prepared that it could take longer...but it's worth it!\n\n#1 absolutely get the assorted sashimi platter. There's no frills & no imitation crab bullshit; it is straight up perfect size pieces of fresh fish.  They gave us fatty tuna, butter fish, yellow tail, & trout. They were all buttery and amazing!!!!! \n\n#2 I loved the chips & dip. It was a great starter & the amount of fish is generous!\n\n#3 the flaming sea bass isn't gimmicky. It's baked, absolutely flavorful & everyone orders it so instead of staring just order your own; you won't go wrong.  \n\n#4 if you're an uni fan (ie butter of the sea) the uni nigiri and the beastie boys are an absolute. The nigiri is fresh fresh uni. The beastie boy is a creative twist. My husband said it was breakfast in his mouth once the yolk broke. I sadly tasted more rice so basically you need to be strategic in how to eat it.\n\n#5 the service is efficient and great! It's as if they haven't described what they're going to do with the flaming sea bass a thousand times earlier in the night. \n\n#6 their bottle of Sauvignon Blanc is blan so opt for a different wine or beverage. \n\nBottom line. Go! Get there before the doors open at 6pm to put your name down for that night and again get the assorted sashimi platter for sure!! And don't overlook their homemade pickled ginger which is awesome!!", "author": "Jenny K. L."}

Not to brag, just to bring some perspective.\n15 years living in Japan, eating raw fish almost 24/7.\nI'm a sushi freak, but not a snob. \n\nSo when you have a Yelper saying, \"You won't find fresher fish anywhere.\" (I won't mention any names.) You have to realize that maybe that Yelper just got introduced to sushi recently. And to him or her, Elephant Sushi *is* the best fish that he/she has ever put in his/her mouth .\n\nContrast that with someone like me, who has been eating sushi in the Land of the Rising Sun since the early 80's.  Again, not to brag, but just to make the point, it makes a big difference to know the background and experience of a food reviewer before you swallow hook, line and sinker.  That goes for all food, not just sushi.  Experience counts when you're looking for an opinion. Just sayin.  \n\nMy daughter was born in Japan and knows her sushi stuff pretty well too.  She was with us at Elephant and made this comment about their fish:\n\n\"Dad, they don't know how to cut fish here.\"\n\nShe was right.  The way they cut the fish at Elephant was not maximizing the taste and texture of the fish (I have also worked at a sushi bar.)\n\nWe were very lucky to be seated as walk-ins.  Hostess said it was very rare.  We were an odd 3 people and they had a spot that worked for only us in the line.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nYELLOW FIN BITES (3/5)  Not bad, not good, just middle of the road.\n\nHAMACHI W/TRUFFLE  (4/5)  Probably the best of the bunch.  It had garlic chips and green onion.  It was a good twist on the usual trendy thing they're doing these days adding the jalape\u00f1o. I think Nobu in LA originated the hamachi/jalapeno combo.\n\nYA MAN ROLL (3/5)  Salmon cut a bit too thick for me.  But I liked the concept of red onion chips and pesto thrown in for good measure.  Still, flavors got too busy for me and the fish was no longer the star of the show.\n\nWe also had an assortment of nigiri which included:  MAGURO, HAMACHI, SALMON AND WALU (which is the Hawaiian word for ESCOLAR) which is basically a kind of tuna.  Different sushi places will call fish by different names and it can be confusing.  What is even more confusing is when sushi restaurants will mislabel their fish (sometimes deliberately and sometimes ignorantly) depending on the fish and how they want to market it to the customer. For example, some sushi chef might think it's more appealing to call it \"butterfish\"rather than its common name \"escolar\".  If I were a sushi chef, I think I'd opt to call it \"butterfish\" too just because it sounds more appetizing than the former.  Let's not forget too that some chefs will deliberately (and fraudulently) call a cheap fish by a different name just to make it sound expensive.  Wow, I got off on a tangent here.\n\nAnyway, I think there's def some hype going on here with ES.  I think, if you're not a spoiled sushi eater, you're likely to have a good experience here.  But if you've been around the block in terms of sushi-eating experience, then I would say you're not going to find your happy face here.\n\nI haven't been there in a long time, but look up KABUTO restaurant for some off-the-chart sushi goodness.  And if you're in the LA area, look up SUGARFISH.  SUGARFISH is completely affordable and unbelievably delicious.", "author": "Darien R."}

All were extremely tasty and fresh. The Flaming Sea Bass was set on fire so it's a fun experience while having dinner. The Beastie Boys was a new experience since I've never had quail eggs and sea urchin. \n\nService: the server was extremely nice and recommended the White Out Roll (great recommendation). \n\nThe only downside was the sun directly in my eyes the entire time (they obviously can't control the sun) so try to get a table away from the door.

We luckily stopped by around 5 and a waitress was outside taking reservations for 6. We snagged the last table for 4. Be warned, this place is tiny! And all the tables are really meant for 2 people. So this is not the place to come with a group. The owner has a 4 people max policy. \n\nThe sushi rolls on the menu were certainly unique compared to other spots in the city. I loved the flaming sea bass roll - to the point that i was scrubbing the rice of the foil. The white out roll was good, but certainly overhyped. We also really liked the red and yellow roll. After a few sake bombs, we started getting more hungry, and asked the waitress for a recommendation. She said to try the roll with the banana in it - sushi with banana sounded real weird but we decided it was worth a shot. And the roll turned out to actually taste pretty good, but not one I would get again.\n\nOverall, I would come back, the $2 sake bombs really make this place appealing.", "author": "Nikita K."}

There's a long wait, but you can check out the shops and bars nearby until they call you.\n\nStarted off with the Beastie Boys - uni, quail egg, ankimo and shiso. I highly recommend this. It's a party in your mouth. Also had their naked scallop roll. They wrap it in soy paper which gives it a nuttier taste.\n\nThe service was efficient which makes up for the wait. What sets this place apart from other sushi restaurants is their homemade ginger. They make their ginger in house and they serve it in a glass jar with tongs. It's thicker, crunchier and not as sweet as the artificial ones.\nI'll have to come back here for the flaming sea bass.", "author": "Helen C."}

I was right!!\n\nElephant Sushi is not your grandmother's sushi restaurant. It is a small place with a great vibe and a menu full of original sushi creations. As you read the descriptions on the menu each one sounds better than the last, which makes it difficult to decide on what to order. \n\nIn the end we settled on: the Hawaiian Poki salad, Yummy Pockets, Chips and Dip, Blue Fin Bites and Godzilla. The items are as creative as the names would suggest. All the ingredient were extremely fresh and delicious and it wold be a challenge to decide on a favorite. \n\nGiven the quality of the food the prices are very reasonable and the portions extremely generous. After the first 3 dishes were delivered to our table I began to worry that we may struggle to finish everything that we ordered because the portion were so substantial. Luckily this challenge was overcome by how tasty everything was and we managed to polish it all off. Unfortunately we were only two people so we only had a chance to sample a portion of the menu and there are so many other great items that we didn't get to try.

I would highly recommend getting this.\n\nFlaming Sea Bass: This is one of those dishes that your order for photos. It looks pretty cool since it comes lit on fire, but was drenched so heavily in sauce that I really disliked it; the sushi rice got pretty mushy. This roll also requires time to cook in the fire, so we ended up waiting a quite some time before we could finally eat it. \n\nOverall fresh fish but very catered towards those who like japanese/american fusion rolls.

Even if we had to wait without wine, it would have totally been worth it. This sushi is incredible! I will say the Nigiri is better than the rolls so if you're into Nigiri stick to that portion of the menu and you won't be disappointed. Each piece is really generous, I know you're supposed to eat in all in one bite but it was so large that I had to take two (the hubs made it work with one bite of course). His favorite was the Beastie boy, a unique mixture of quail egg, Sea Urchin and several other yummy ingredients. The Himalayan Trout appetizer was my personal favorite. It was served on a salt block and it was the perfect balance of fish with a tiny layer of salt on top. We also got the Flaming Sea Bass roll which is super cool to watch cook, but we both agreed that the fish was too cooked at the end and we would probably have preferred it raw.

It totally exceeded my expectations and I'm already planning on going back soon!\n\nArrived around 6:20 to three open tables. The hostess said I couldn't get seated until my entire party (my boyfriend who was parking) had arrived so she took my name down. In the 20 minute it took him to find parking, about ten other people had arrived so there went our no wait! The hostess was very sweet and sympathetic and assured me a table would be opening up soon and we only and to wait another ten minutes once my bf had arrived. \n\nIf you have an option to choose, try to sit against the wall and not near the entry way because it ended up getting packed with people! I had time to look at the menu while I was waiting and I was shocked at the $2 sake bomb. WTF $2! That is the cheapest drink I've ever seen in SF and was amazed not every single table was doing sake bombs! Well my bf and I ended up not doing it because he's stopped drinking beer and I opted for the Hello Kitty martini instead at the very low price of $5. A table behind us ordered sake bombs and got one for the waiter and we watched them down it all. Loved it! Our waiter was AMAZING and he was able to just memorize our entire order. What a pro!\n\nI wanted to get the sea bass that most people had at their table but was put off by the $16 price tag since it was just one roll! Definitely coming back and ordering it tho. We ended up ordering the Yummy Pocket, Hotate Nigiri, Giant's Roll, and the Spicy Hamachi Roll. The Hamachi roll was my least favorite. The scallop nigiri tasted way different than any other scallops I've ever had and I'm not sure why. Either it was amazing or it was not fresh but since I can't tell I'll just go with amazing. The yummy pocket was super cute and I usually never eat those rice filled tofu skins but its another story when its topped with spicy scallops! \n\nDisappointed there was no toro or fish specials. Also I love ginger and was really excited to see they made their own and it was awful. I really did not like it at all and kind of just forced myself to eat it between bites as a palette cleanser. Sorry I guess I like my ginger marinated in sugar! \n\nImpressed with the $40 bill at the end including my martini especially since we had a very mediocre $70 sushi meal somewhere in Rockridge and we didn't even order any alcohol and left still hungry. For the quality of Elephant sushi the price is ridic! They could easily charge double and people wouldn't blink an eye but I think its one of the reasons why its so popular.

Came here twice and with both times, I unfortunately had to wait more than an hour (ugh, boooo...!!!). Although their food is fantastic, I'm not quite sure if I would [want to] wait for that long again.. \n\nMUST TRIES: \n- For starters: I loved both the hamachi truffle and walu corpaccio. Of the two, I preferred the hamachi truffle but both were yummy.\n- White out roll: seriously, this roll is amazing!! Hamachi and avocado inside, with seared butter fish on top with an overall scrumptious flavor from the garlic ponzu. Must must muuuust get this!\n- Flaming seabass roll: I feel this roll is more for the cool wow factor experience of a flaming skinny-burrito-lookin' thing on your table. With most baked rolls, the taste of the fish is often hidden by all of the sauces. I couldn't tell there was sea bass or or tuna in there. Regardless, the roll was very smooth and bursting with flavors! It was different, filling and delicious.\n\nYa man roll was great too (salmon, avocado, pesto & ponzu sauce), and their sake nigiri was fresh and buttery.\n\nI would personally pass on the naked scallop roll and spicy hamachi roll, but if that looks and sounds delicious for your tastebuds, then go for it! They weren't bad at all - I just didn't think they were anything special and wouldn't order them again.\n\nFish tasted and felt extremely fresh. It's a little pricier here, but given the location, quality of food and unique take on sushi, I guess that's understandable. Most of the tables are situated very close together. Service is prompt and waitresses can easily be flagged down. If you're able to dodge (or you don't mind) the 1+ hour wait, then go for it!!!

We had to check in with her multiple times before she got our order right. \n\nWhen our friends chair BROKE INTO PIECES, they acted like absolutely nothing happened. Replacing the chair within moments, as though this happens regularly, not even asking him if he was okay. Not one apology was expressed. Not one. \n\nThe night was almost over, and we tried to pay our bill. They wouldn't let us split between cards, fine. We asked for a discount at this point. The servers had to ask their manager, as he stands in front of our table saying \"fuck no, fuck no.\" He sees us overhearing this, and gives us a condescending smile and wive. \n\nWe finally pay our bill. And tip, of course. We walk outside and two managers are harassing our friend that fell, luckily unharmed, out of their chair. They aggressively attacked him with: \"Are you a man bro? Did you break our chair bro?!\" We told them we wouldn't return any business back to them, and they say \"Good, don't come back,\" while they laughed. \n\nUpon getting in my taxi, I told them I was planning to leave a Yelp review.

The sushi comes wrapped in foil over a bowl of what I'm assuming is alcohol.  The servers light the bowl so that the flames cook the sushi for about 8 minutes.  Don't worry, a server will come back to put out the flame and unwrap the sushi when it's ready.  It was extremely flavorful and unlike any other sushi experience I've ever had.

I can also declare that this is probably one of the better (if not the BEST) Sushi joints in San Franciso. \n\nI took the Wifey here for her birthday dinner and I quickly realized that I should have made a reservation. In my defense, she picked me up from work and wanted to go out for dinner and my birthday plans for her was for the next day. Yeah...no excuses.  \n\nIt was a Friday evening, May 9th to be exact and the wind was biting; typical San Francisco weather and the line was out the door. The wait was over an hour and a half, but it didn't faze the Wifey. Parking is also a pain, but I don't care. I ended up parking four blocks away. Take note that the Cable Car runs in front of the place for those of you who are not willing to drive and battle traffic.\n\nWhile we were waiting, we were scrolling at the food pics, which made us hungrier and hungrier. By the time our name was called, it was under an hour a half wait but over an hour, and it was totally worth the wait. \n\nWe sat at the Sushi Bar and we got the coolest, laid-back and friendliest server we've ever encountered. I forgot his name, but he had long, curly hair and had that Japanese Surfer vibe to him. Told him it was the Wifey's birthday and he got her a free drink; it was a Hello Kitty Martini. \n\nThe Sushi Chef then gave us two pieces of Butterfish Sashimi as a FREE appetizer. Not only was it FREE, but it was HELLA good. It was well-balanced dish from taste to contrasting texture. It was so clean and fresh and the Fried Garlic Chips added a level of contrast and taste that made me do the happy dance. I knew that we were in for a treat. \n\nBased on Ethan Z's reviews, who was the first Yelper that highly recommended this place to us, we ordered the following:\n\nFlaming Seabass - Sushi roll served in a foil cooked in flame on your table\nHimalayan Trout - New Zealand Ocean Trout cured on a Himalayan Rock Salt\nYa Man Roll - King Salmon, Avocado, Scallion, Fried Red Onion Chips, Pesto and Ponzu\nBoom Box - Japanese Spicy Scallops, Avocado, Garlic Chips, Cucumber wrapped in Banana\nRainbow Roll - Assorted Fresh Fish\nBeastie Boys - Uni, Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Quail Eggs and Shiso Leaf\n\nThe Boom Box was a surprise since who would have thought banana wouldn't go together with scallops, let alone mixing it as a sushi ingredient? It wasn't too sweet, but the contrast of sweet and spicy was at work again balancing it off. \n\nThe Himalayan Trout was on a bed of rock salt that was seasoned lightly with sea salt. You didn't need to add soy sauce to add some flavor as the dishes were left shining on their own with the high level of freshenss and quality. This was also true for the Ya Man Roll. There was a nice theme of contrasting flavor and texture that were nicely married to form a union. \n\nFor the Flaming Seabass, you had to wait a while until it's cooked and had to time it precisely in order to get the best experience. Our server told us exactly when to eat it as it was still hot and told us not to let it cool off. I love how some of the rice became crunchy and I was happily digging them from the foil and popping them straight to our mouth. \n\nAnd for the Rainbow Roll, there's nothing more to add except to say that everyhing was fresh. This would be a great roll by itself if served in other sushi joints, \n\nAs for the Beastie Boys....I saved the BEST for last. I can honestly say that this was the BEST sushi I've ever placed in my mouth. The combination of Uni, Monkfish Liver, Quail Egg and Shiso Leaf was a delectable experience that hit my tastebuds like a frontal assault of umami goodness. It was silky, creamy and smooth and went down like the finest vintage wine that's over a hundred years old. \n\nWOW, simply amazing experience.\n\nI know where I'll be eating on my birthday.", "author": "John G."}

GET THERE EARLY, around 15-30 min earlier, if you want to be seated as soon as they open. They don't have a list but usually the people waiting go by the honor system, which is great! Or else you'll be waiting for a while, and I mean a while. \n\n#2 - parties are LIMITED TO 4 MAX! Make it a date, bring another friend or two. But no more than that. \n\nFood:\n\nHands down, you must try the WHITE OUT ROLL (if you love raw fish). It's freaking de-licious! The fish feels like it melts in your mouth. No sauce needed for this bad boy. \n\n$2 sake bombs for happy hour! What a deal! Great when paired with the sushi.\n\nCan't wait to go back already!", "author": "Christine N."}

To put it plainly - Elephant Sushi is the type of restaurant that gives SF a bad name.\n\nYes, I've eaten here before. And yes, the sushi is good. It's not amazing, but it's definitely worth a visit...if the employees weren't so awful to interact with.\n\nThe service once you're seated is okay. The place is always super crowded, very VERY loud and not exactly nice, but for a \"hole-in-the-wall\" sushi place it does just fine. The main issue is that the employees who work on giving wait times are awful. If they're taking names at all - yup, they stop taking names around 7:30 pm most nights - they will quote 2-3 hours no matter what. I've had that quote, left after putting my name in, and been called between half an hour and an hour. It has never been even close to 2-3 hours, and I have no idea why they consistently lie about that. \n\nLike I said, they stop taking names super early every night. They'll claim they're full and can't take any more people, but then if you show up a few hours later they'll be glad to seat you. I'm not kidding, I have seen this happen countless times. I've had friends who show up later and are seated when hours prior I'd been told \"no more tonight, sorry.\"\n\nAlso, I stopped in well before close on a weekday and was told they were sold out of fish. It was still over an hour until close, tons of empty tables, and clearly pounds and pounds of fish behind the counter. I kid you not, they told me they couldn't seat me because they were \"totally out of fish.\"\n\nI only stop by so often because I live nearby. I will never, ever try to eat here again and recommend you do the same. I simply cannot support an establishment that treats customers the way Elephant does, and there are plenty of awesome sushi places in the city that don't do that.

The wait for 2 people was around 30-45 minutes and we overheard the wait being 2hrs for groups bigger than 2. They take down your phone number and call when the seats are ready so you can spend time exploring the area instead of having to wait there.\n\nWe got seated at the bar so we could see all the sushi making action up close. Since we loved them last time, we ordered the Himalayan Sea Salt Trout and White Out Roll again. For our new dishes, we got the Fatty Tuna appetizer, Uni nigiri, and Walu nigiri. The only thing we loved was the trout :( The white out roll was good but not as flavorful as we remembered. There was too much avocado in the roll and it overpowered the fish. They were out of toro for the fatty tuna dish so the chef told us he would use chu toro instead. When he served it to us, he said it would be chewy but taste very good. Well it tasted okay but it was a lot chewier than other times we've had it so we were very disappointed :( The walu nigiri was good, the seasoning on top was lemon pepper I think? For the uni, he gave us a huge portion so I was excited for that but it was also just okay and there was a slight weird aftertaste to it :(\n\nSince we were sitting right in front of the chef we didn't really voice our disappointment to each other during the meal. Once we left though, we both immediately were like.. that was NOT as good as last time! The only dish that was like \"oo this is so good\" was the sea salt trout. Everything else was \"meh\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-18", "description": "I don't give out a lot of five stars, but this place is pretty incredible. Be prepared to wait, we put our names down for table of 2 (called earlier, but they only took walk-ins and you had to sign-in in person) around 7pm on Saturday and waited around 45 minutes. The restaurant is small, but the tables are spaced in a way that you don't feel like the next table is sitting on your lap. The wait staff is genuinely friendly and not snobby, which can be rare in popular restaurants.\n\nOnto the food -- while we were waiting, we saw a flaming roll on every table (the flaming sea bass), so we thought we should definitely give it a try. We also ordered the beastie boys (negiri of uni, monkfish liver and raw quail egg) and the spicy hamachi.\n\nOur waitress brought us a sample of two slices of barely seared butterfish with a truffle oil and ponzu sauce topped with fried onions. I've never had butterfish, and wow, where have you been all my life?! The fish tasted so fresh and is soft and just melted in my mouth. There was only a hint of truffle oil, so not to overwhelm the other flavors. Definitely 10/10! A very promising start of our dinner.\n\nNext up we got the spicy hamachi and the beastie boys. The hamachi actually wasn't spicy (it's supposed to have some jalapenos), but the fish was so fresh. There was a bit of ponzu that added some acidity and the avocado gave it more creaminess. There was a bit of cucumber for crunch to complete the roll. There were 8 pieces in the roll and it was a fattie. I like a bit more texture to rice in sushi rolls and the rice was slightly on the mushy side, so I gave it 8/5/10. \n\nThe beastie boys, in my opinion, is the best bite in SF. It's even better than the Scotched eggs from the Cavalier, and that's saying a lot. You gotta eat the whole thing in one bite. I don't think I ever had monk fish liver before and the flavor reminds me a bit of foie gras. It was rich, firm (but not hard) and creamy. The sea urchin was sweet and just a bit of brininess, very fresh. The quail egg yoke added more richness to the dish. IT'S A MUST ORDER!!\n\nThe flaming sea bass was roasting over the bowl for around 8 minutes. Our waitress helped us open it up and plate it after the flame went out. It's kind of like the lion king roll, I think. I thought it was too much teriyaki that overpowered the fish. It just tasted like a dollop of teriyaki sauce over rice. I couldn't taste the fish at all. \n\nAll in all, we loved our experience and hope to be back soon. The staff is so friendly, always a smile and the food is just amazing.

We trekked through a couple of intense hills just to dine here, so by the time we arrived, we were ready to eat everything. Unfortunately, that would not have been good for our wallet, so we settled on 4 sushi rolls. \n\nWe got the flaming sea bass roll, the spicy hamachi roll, the Giants roll and the spicy tuna. Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of the Giants roll because it had tomatoes, which didn't go well with sushi. I'm not a big fan of raw tomatoes, but my boyfriend loved it. The hamachi and spicy tuna were delicious, but those are the most basic sushi rolls so it's difficult to mess them up. The flaming sea bass roll was the highlight of the meal. They presented the roll wrapped in aluminum foil and placed it on top of a burning plate for 8-9 minutes. I wonder if anyone ever got hurt while ordering the sea bass because the flame got pretty wild. The presentation was really unique but the roll itself was dumped in sauce so that made it break apart easily. Real sushi is not supposed to break apart!  \n\nOverall, great service and decent ambiance. My total bill came out to $60 for 2 people so it's not too bad. I'm not sure if I would ever make the trek up here again, but if I do, I would definitely order the sashimi salad because that looked bomb.

Ordered some O-Toro, hamachi nigiri, himilayan trout sashimi, beastie boy, 8 piece assorted sashimi, and the flaming seabass roll.\n\nThe quality of fish was just very grocery store standard. The flaming seabass roll is more for presentation and tasted like a lion king (you're not missing out on much). I'm really shocked this place has such great reviews. We even waited 30 minutes to get seated here whereas Okoze sushi on the corner had no wait. \n\nThey don't have an assortment of special fish, and they don't even have saba (mackerel). They serve escolar fish as walu (aka butterfish). Be careful with escolar consumption! It's not good, just wikipedia it. \n\nAll in all, this place is not worth the hype. Nothing was wrong with the service and I don't have any ill will towards this place. I just don't think it's very good. Tried it once, probably won't come back.", "author": "Joanna S."}

SUPER fresh sushi - I highly recommend the chips and dip appetizer and the flaming sea bass roll. Also as far as price goes it was I would say it was really reasonable.

My friends who live in the area swear that this is one of the best places in SF for sushi, so I've known that I needed to at least try here at some point.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went here on a Sunday night without a reservation, and found ourselves in a HUGE line that went into the street before their 6pm opening. We thankfully got in and got seats at the sushi bar; usually something I look forward to at sushi places. We decided that we were going to share things, so we went with the Hamachi Truffle, Yummy Pocket, Naked Scallop Roll, and the Godzilla.\n\nMy conclusions on just about every single one of the dishes were that nothing here impressed me.  In fact, I couldn't really understand why people wait for hours for this place.  There was WAY too much sriracha on the Godzilla dish, and everything else literally left no impression on me.  So, fine, 3 stars for the food since nothing here was impressive.\n\nWhere this goes bad is the service.  I get that you have a huge line of people looking to get in to your restaurant.  But our waitress attempted to clear our dishes while food was still on it (I had to stop her from taking the hamachi off the plate since she was focused on clearing).  While we were were finishing the Godzilla, we noticed that we hadn't been sitting in our seats for more than 30 minutes before coming to the end of dinner.  That's how fast food was coming out.  One dish after the other, and by being at the bar, that means you have to deal with it. Noticing that we had finished fast, we asked our waitress for the banana ice cream.  Not more than 3 minutes later, a small scoop of ice cream showed up as we were trying to finish our fish items.  Yuck. SO yuck. The last thing I want on my palate is tuna and then banana ice cream.  Midway through the weird ice cream/fish experience, our waitress dropped off the check, which was a sign for GTFO.  \n\nWe couldn't leave fast enough. I most definitely will not be returning here. Thankfully, this place wasn't expensive, otherwise I probably would have said something to the manager that night.  If you appreciate good sushi, you'll steer clear of a place that has gained popularity because of their cheap sake bombs. No thanks.", "author": "Lisa I."}

This was our second visit to Elephant sushi but it would also be our last. \n\nThe first issue was the hostess- wifey stopped in to check the wait and was told 30-45 mins, the hostess took her cell phone number and said she'd call when they were dropping the check. Guess who's phone NEVER rang? After an hour at a wine bar across the street I went to inquire and was told she called and no one answered. We were starving at this point and watching her phone quite hawkishly so we're certain it didn't ring. \n\nNext, we're sat and delivered our bottle of ginjo sake. I stress delivered, not served, as our server placed it on the table and asked if we were ready to order- didn't even open the bottle let alone pour a glass. When I asked a question about a sushi roll our server just stared at me blankly as her English was not passable. Fail. Fine we'll just figure it out. \n\nOne of the rolls we ordered, the Flaming Seabass, was again delivered not served. They light the roll on fire at our table and we weren't warned that the bowl is extremely hot- yeah we figured it out without major incident but it seems like quite the liability to not at least warn us not to touch the bowl. As we watch this tinfoil burn we start to wonder- how long do we wait? Our server Moogii returned as she noticed us trying to unwrap the flaming roll and we asked her how long it's to stay lit, to which she replied 2-3 minutes. Weird. It'd been burning for at least 5-6! She leaves with it still on fire so we blow it out and try to get into it. Moogii eventually came to help us sort it out but as you can imagine, the roll was overcooked- falling all apart and the hoisin sauce is burnt. \n\nAll in all, the food was good but all aspects of the service were dreadful. Tip reflected and my wife's in the industry so she hates under tipping, but our server earned it. We let her know about it via guest comment card too. How else they gonna learn?

Judging from the decor and ambiance, the restaurant feels rather hip and trendy.  It's small, so you might want to make a reservation or go right when they open for dinner to avoid waiting.\n\nI highly recommend getting:\n\n1. The White Out Roll - Yellowtail & avocado roll topped with seared butter fish & garlic ponzu sauce. It literally melts in your mouth. You'll wonder why other foods can't be like this.  They just can't\n\n2. Scallop Nigiri - Super fresh & slightly sweet. This also just melts in your mouth.  Other nigiri that I've tried here have also been great, but the scallop is the most memorable. I normally get two orders!\n\n3. Truffle Hamachi - Come on. Hamachi in truffle oil, topped with fried garlic? Amazing.\n\n4. Kobe Dragon Roll - Seared Kobe beef, on a roll. What's not to like?\n\nThe Godzilla Roll receives an honorable mention. It's shrimp tempura wrapped in tuna, sitting in some spicy sauce (siracha? I can't remember).  The beastie boys are worth trying, but I'm not sure if I would get them again.  A lot of flavors, some great, some not so great. Loved the uni, quail egg & shiso leaf, but there was one other thing in there that was just meh.\n\nAnyway, if you're in Nob Hill, and looking for a moderately priced sushi dinner, this might be the spot for you. And by moderately priced, I mean about $100 for two people.  The service has always been fantastic, and they don't judge you if your boyfriend orders a Hello Kitty martini.\n\nFor those of you wondering...Yes, their menu is suspiciously similar to Saru in Noe Valley.", "author": "Grace C."}

My parents were visiting San Francisco and we wanted them to experience great sushi, so we decided to go to Elephant Sushi. The restaurant has a strict policy of not taking parties more than 4 people, which we were aware of. We had a group of 6 people and we're hoping that we could at least sit near each other or at the bar. When we arrived to the restaurant we asked the hostess if we could sit at one table of four and have two others sit at the table right next to it. Both tables were available and they refused to accommodate our request. We sat at the table of four and the hostess sat my parents across the restaurant. The table for two right next to us was empty the ENTIRE time we were at the restaurant. The hostess could not provide a valid reason as to why my parents could not sit at the empty table. We asked to speak to a manger multiple times and she refused to come out. Before we left, the waitress handled us a post it with an email address for us to contact the manager with our issue. It was extremely disappointing to see the lack of customer service and ability to grant a simple request. It was disgusting how spiteful the situation was handled considering there was an empty table right next to ours. It was as if they were trying to be nasty.   \nThis was my parents last night in town and our evening was completely ruined.

I continue to enjoy the bar seating,  which, as any sushi aficionado will tell you, is the only place to sit when enjoying sushi. I like this born again version more, perhaps because the memories created since the change-over seemed more relevant. The ginger in a jar and help yourself model works for me. The quality of sushi seemed to have improved, in my opinion. I would stay with the nigiri because good sushi needs no sauce. The fusion side of the offering in this restaurant is enticing enough, rolls are filled with ample fish and delightful sauces. The fanciful ones with flame always seemed to please the patrons. \n\nI never had to order when coming here. The person I'm usually with has been a long term patron like me since the late 90s as well, and has practically the same exact taste as I when it comes to sushi. He does the ordering, I do the eating. Pretty simple and hassle free. A good test for a decent sushi restaurant is the freshness of uni, and I noticed he tends to always order that wherever we go out for sushi, which we had been doing for as long as we have known each other. This to me is the place that had the very best uni, and they tell you up front that it's a one bite nigiri. Don't attempt to be lady like when consume beastie boys and / or uni nigiri, or you'd look anything but a lady after. \n\nWe never had to wait and there is always a good chance that we could be in and out in an hour, as the service is very prompt, so that we could get on with the rest of our evening without feeling that we had spent the entire evening waiting to get served. \n\nAnd of course this being a place I frequented in my 20s, does not hurt either.", "author": "Victoria E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-23", "description": "Elephant Sushi is THE BEST sushi I have ever had. There are many great sushi restaurants in San Francisco, but very few are memorable and worthy of repeat visits. \n\nWe came here last Friday and despite parking being a nightmare and the one hour wait outside, in the cold...I WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN. By the time we were seated at the bar, I was starving. Fortunately, one of the sushi chefs handed us a complementary plate of seared butter fish, which was absolute perfection (and a very sweet gesture!). I immediately became very excited because I knew if that one little piece of fish was THAT good, then the food to come was going to be amazing. And it was. \n\nTHE FOOD:\n- Yummy Pocket (House Special): Sweet tofu skins stuffed with spicy bay scallops, scallions, and sushi rice. These were really fun to eat and were indeed yummy pockets bursting with flavor! \n\n- White Out Roll: Hamachi, seared butterfish, and avocado...this roll was anything but monotone. Great texture, flavor, and presentation. Probably my favorite roll. \n\n- Ya Man Roll: Salmon with a spicy pesto; I love salmon and this one was a winner! \n\n- Flaming Sea Bass Roll: An absolute must-get! Very similar to a baked lion king roll, the Flaming Sea Bass comes out on a flaming bowl, wrapped in foil, and is cooked right in front of you. Creamy, decadent, and a little bit sweet. If there's a ton of rice stuck to your foil at the end, ask your server for a spoon to scrape the tasty burnt bits!\n\n- Monkfish Liver (Nigiri): The liver was mild in flavor and had the texture of pate. Very interesting, although probably my least favorite compared to the other rolls. \n\nWe were so pleased with our meal that we wanted to order more even though we were full. Unfortunately, when we tried to order some uni (sea urchin) they were sold out for the night.  If you're a fan of it, get here early! \n\nThe service was absolutely wonderful, from the hostess (who was gracefully dealing with the hoards of people trying to get tables) to the servers to the sushi chefs. A special shoutout to Miken for being our awesome server for the night! He was friendly, funny, super chill, and made sure we were well taken care of. \n\nOn average, the rolls are between $10-15, while some of the house specials and sashimi get into the $20 range, but the quality of the fish is so unquestionably fresh and delicious that the prices are more than worth it. They don't take same-day reservations after 6pm, so do call ahead of time! If you're waiting though, they take your number and will call you when you're on deck, so feel free to grab a drink at the wine bar up the street...or take a peek at Swenson's Ice Cream flavors for your after-dinner dessert! The restaurant is pretty small inside - about 8 tables,  6 bar seats, and one large table for groups. I was initially a bit disappointed we got bar seats, but they're actually some of the best seats in the house since you have a front row view of the rolls being made and an interactive experience with the sushi chefs. I cannot wait to go back! Highly recommend and one of my new favorites!", "author": "Deanna Y."}

I got there early expecting it to be busy and waiting for a table which was fine. But when I mentioned I was a group of 5 right away we were shut down. They said they only will take even numbers or a group of 8 at a back table. My group had accommodated by splitting 2 and 3 and hoping we would at least maybe sit close to each other. \nWhen we got back an hour later they completely split us up across the restaurant. 3 at the bar and 2 by the window. We saw a table opening up near the bar to see if we could at least sit close by but they said no! \nWe eventually sat down after trying to ask for them to accommodate something but still nothing was done to make us somewhat happy.  Eventually we ordered in our separate seats and then seats opened beside us at the bar. We asked if our friends could be moved and again they said no! Once your sitting and ordered you can't be moved. \nWe noticed a table to the left of the restaurant that clearly sits a bigger group. They had two groups of 3 sitting there which were not together... Clearly a communal table. We were quite disappointed that they did not offer that option for us 5! We easily would have shared with other people so we could of sat together. \nA friend in our group was gluten free and had been there before where there was no problem... Well they made it a problem for her that day saying they could not change certain meals for her (which was not the case with her visit before). \nThe kicker was when we had to pay our bill... they would not let us split the bill 3 ways with credit cards. We had to do 2 only. Which I get it can be annoying to split multiple ways on a bill... But just for 3 seemed a little ridiculous. \nWell to say the least I'm very disappointed!! The food there is incredible but due to the service my friends and I received I doubt we'll be going back any time soon. There are many other sushi restaurants that will make their customers happy.", "author": "Ela B."}

Also, I was never thirsty because our waitress was so prompt about refilling my water cup throughout the night. \nThe boyfriend and I shared three rolls and they were all so delicious! The fish were fresh and each roll was unique and delightfully presentable. I highly recommend the Ya Man roll if you are a fan of salmon, the White Out if you love hamachi, and the Flaming Sea Bass if you want a hot sushi roll. They were all so good! The Flaming Sea Bass comes out about 7 minutes before you can actually eat it so you can see it being cooked right in front of you. Cooked from flames ignited by alcohol- how exciting.\nElephant Sushi also has their own pickled ginger that comes out in its own mason jar- I'm pretty sure I ate a whole ginger by myself. \nI would definitely come here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sushi place in the city.

It is worth coming back simply to have more salmon sushi.\n\nI was initially pulled into trying this place because the Beastie Boys looked so interesting. Like many of the other review have said, it ended up being my least favorite thing. It just had too many rich flavors and textures going on for one bite. The poke bowl was fairly good. Most of the rolls have too much going on for my taste, but are well presented. I usually stick with the straight sushi.\n\nThe interior is dark and intimate, great place to take a date. Wait time was between 30-60 minutes, on weekends and week days. Luckily there are several great wine bars on the block to pass the time until they call you for your seating.\n\nOnly complaint I've had is with the service. The first time I went here we ordered drinks, waited 15 minutes without them showing up, asked again, waited another 15 minutes, and then asked a third time before finally procuring them.

The ambiance is awesome, the service is AWESOME, the food is A-W-E-S-O-M-E, and three of us left satiated with sushi and sashimi for under $100 before tip!  If I lived closer I'd be here on a weekly basis.  The only drawback was the lack of parking (welcome to San Francisco!) but the wonderful culinary experience made even SF's traffic and notoriously inadequate parking fade from memory.  The dining area is tiny, maybe a dozen tables and maybe eight seats at the bar, so make sure you make a reservation!\n\nWe ordered some of both the exotic and the more familiar sushi rolls and while the exotic dishes were the most memorable all of the sushi and sashimi tasted fresh and delicious and were beautifully prepared.  Each serving came with between six and eight pieces.  So based on our dinner tab the pricing worked out to roughly $2 per piece of sushi or sashimi. \n\nIn our opinion the best dish of the night was the Himalayan Trout - this consisted of New Zealand trout served sashimi style on a block of pink Himalayan salt.  This novel presentation on a salt block imparted just enough seasoning to the sashimi so that soya sauce was totally unnecessary.  We ordered this twice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elephant-sushi-san-francisco?userid=weI3gUj0DiKXkp8seBYKfw#pm-nWFG6Wt5AHULHGLDibQ\n\nThe flaming seabass (sushi wrapped up in foil and cooked at your table over an alcohol flame) is another Must Try here.  This was a totally unique idea, who ever thought of cooked sushi!  It was fantastic: fresh fish and steamed rice in a sushi roll!\n\nWe also tried the Boom Box which was sushi topped with ripe banana, another delicious and innovative creation - but only if you like bananas.    \n\nFYI, I usually bath my sushi in soya sauce and wasabi, but here at Elephant Sushi I barely used the stuff because each dish was bursting with flavor already!\n\nDespite a full house our orders came out fast (almost too quick!) and the hostess and servers were super friendly.

I dined here on a Friday night with 3 other friends. We put our name in at 6pm, and were asked to wait an hour. No big deal, I expected the wait. Returned as 7PM, was asked to wait another 20 minutes for a table that was finishing. Fine- still didn't bother me- i know this place has a long wait for good sushi. FINALLY we sit down around 7:30. We ordered our food which came out 10-15 minutes later. The sushi was very tasty, but hardly filling, We ordered 4 beers, 5 sushi rolls, two large bottles of Saki. About 25 minutes had passed and we had inhaled our sushi. Keep in mind the time line here, we had only been sitting for about 40 minutes at the table at this point. Also keep in mind we were at a SHARED table- a different group of three other people were at our same table. Our 40 minutes inside the restaurant from sitting to being done with our sushi goes by... we all still have half a beer left. \n\nOur check comes, I put down my card right away, and the check comes back in less than a minute. Great, but we are in no hurry- we paid $200 for a meal and all still had half a beer left. 5 minutes goes by since we have paid the check and WE ARE ASKED BY OUR SERVER TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE RESTAURANT!! Are you kidding me? NEVER in my life have I been asked to leave a restaurant within 40 minutes, when I still have a drink left, after paying a $200 meal. I get it- maybe if we ordered one roll of sushi and had been there for an hour and a half- ask us to leave because the table needs to be freed up. But FORTY minutes for a table of four and every single one of us has a drink left!! We blew the waitress off assuming she was out of her damn mind for asking us to leave, and continued our conversation and drinks. Is it a crime to casually finish your drink at the end of dinner? \n\nThree more minutes go by, we are asked A SECOND TIME TO GET UP AND LEAVE!!! THEY LINED UP 5 GIRLS NEXT TO US TO TAKE OUR TABLE!! We were all appalled at this kind of customer service. NOT EVEN AN HOUR HAD GONE BY that they had asked us TWICE to leave the restaurant because we had paid the bill and someone else needed to take our table. DAMN at least give us an hour to sit down!! \n\nI have absolutely never in my life experienced worse customer service than this. We non-politely let them know that this was a completely unacceptable way to treat paying customers, and let the girls standing next to us know that we had been kicked out of the restaurant so that they could take our table when we hadn't even been sitting for an hour. OH and they group next to us was there before us and still eating- but they were not asked to leave because they ordered one roll of sushi at a time as opposed to all at once, and hadn't paid their bill yet. \n\nMoral of the story- if you insist on eating here, be strategic. DON'T PAY YOUR BILL RIGHT AWAY or you will get kicked out, DON'T dine here with more than 4 people ever, they will be extremely rude to you and you probably won't fit. And don't expect to wait less than an hour to sit down. \n\nI truly hope that you train your servers to NEVER treat a paying customer this way unless they have disrespected you by ordered one roll of sushi and sitting down for 2 hours. But we ordered a $200 meal and had not even been sitting for an hour. This is totally unheard of and no way to treat your customers. I'm extremely disappointed. I live up the street and would have spent a lot of money eating here. But after this experience I certainly will not be coming back. I will give my money to the sushi restaurant across the street.", "author": "Julie F."}

If you're afraid of driving on hills... you may want to take the bus or you can drive a bit further to avoid the hills but walk a bit. Anyway, onto the dining experience.\n\nThe chips n dip was actually my favorite item of the meal. When we were ordering, I didn't think too much of it. After I ate it though, it was very flavorful and I liked whatever the \"chip\" was, which didn't get soggy and stayed crunchy the entire time. Kind of reminded me of tuna poke basically... but I'm sure their poke is flavored differently. The beastie boys was okay for me. I've only had uni 3 times in my life... once was here and the two other times were at two other locations... and they were disgusting. I decided to give it one more try since I assumed it would be fresh here and maybe I'll finally see what all the fuss was all about. It wasn't bad after I ate it. It reminded me of the sea? That's the best I way i can describe it. lol. The beastie boy overall was alright. Minimal seasoning, which I understand since they probably intended for you to taste the uni, fish liver, and the quail egg but I didn't care too much for it. For you purist out there, you may love it more than I did. The white dragon roll was my second favorite dish of the night. Tasty, seasoned well, and fresh. Mmmmm! The Ya Man Roll was pretty good too, nothing out of the ordinary, tasted like something I've had before though. The Yummy Pocket was probably my least favorite item of the night. All I tasted was the sweet tofu skin. The scallops weren't seasoned or something so I didn't really care too much for it, all I could taste was sweet tofu. Finally, we had to order the flaming seabass cause... everyone talks about it! It was nice to see, flavor wise, wasn't bad either. It was a bit too saucey for me, but it still tasted good. Wasn't overcooked even though it was sitting above a flame for a while. Overall, the meal was pretty good. Price is decent for sushi and the rolls are a generous size. Service is good too.

We stumbled into Elephant sushi while walking through Russian Hill late one Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was busy - luckily we were able to sneak two seats at the sushi counter without having to wait. The Himalayan Ocean Trout and Hirame Surprise are a must order! I would have gotten them again had my  boyfriend not wanted to try other items on the menu. The fish was extremely fresh and bright! There was no need to add any additional sauces, everything was exceptionally good just the way they served it.  \n\nService was good. I would recommend the counter as the people making the dishes were friendly and inviting. They took the time to explain each item served and you could see they took a lit of pride in their work. We also got sake (obviously!) which was served in martini glasses - a little weird, but hey, I'll take it! Can't wait to be back.", "author": "Elisa P."}

If you want authentic, fresh sushi, not sure. Majority of the items I ordered were rolls. They definitely have some creative ideas with their rolls, but honestly, I've had better ones that are cheaper, better taste and quality. What you need to eat here is the beastie boys, it did not disappoint me. It had enough uni and ankimo that blended well without ruining the good flavors of uni and ankimo. \n\nThe rolls I tried were: ya man, giants, flaming seabass and double albacore. \nMy personal favorite is the giants roll; the flavor combination of the roll was perfect and I think the salmon was good. I personally think if they added shiso leaf to it, or the flavor of shiso, it would taste much better. For the rest, it felt that something was missing in the flavor or the flavors does not blend at all.\n\nYa man roll: the pesto was just off and it shouldn't be there at all.\nFlaming seabass: overpowering sauce and the fish was ok. what makes this roll special is how it's prepared.\nDouble albacore: I don't think the fish was fresh, it tasted a bit fishy and I did not like the honey mustard taste on the roll, I personally think that it doesn't blend with the other flavor. \n\nI personally do not consider this place as one of the best sushi in SF so beware of those reviews that mentions it, because it really is not the best (based on my tastebuds). For the ones who thought flaming seabass and double albacore was good, they do not know what a good sushi is, or never tasted one. \nI would rather go to saru sushi (I think the price range of their food is about the same) for the rolls. Oh, or sushi zone is way better than this place and it's cheaper there too.\nBut, I would come back to have Beastie boys and if you don't order it, no point of going here.", "author": "Toni Rose M."}

Freshness fortunately doesn't suffer, so it's still worth it. I really liked the Beastie Boys - you get uni, monkfish liver and a little quail egg yolk served gunkan-style. It's very rich, but the rice cuts through the richness some and the ingredients just melts and oozes in your mouth.\n\nThe Flaming Seabass was also another excellent showstopper: it's wrapped up in aluminum foil and cooked tableside, so avoid singing your arm hairs/eyebrows. I'm not usually a fan of heavily sauced-up sushi rolls, but this roll was one tasty gimmick with the tobiko topping and sweet/savory sauces.\n\nThe Whiteout Roll had a briney taste to it, which I actually liked, but I imagine some people may not like it. I also had the Naked Scallop roll, which was probably the least worthy roll since it was rather bland and I felt like none of the components really served to complement each other.\n\nOverall, the Beastie Boys is a definite must-order - you'll just have to let your imagination guide you for your other choices.", "author": "Jin C."}

I've eaten a fair amount of sushi over the years, and food-wise this remains a stand-out, local favorite. The food has been consistently great over 1/2 dozen or so trips, and the fish is melt in your mouth good.  The menu is creative, and the guys behind the sushi bar are friendly and knowledgable.  Prices are extremely reasonable.  \n\nElephant also used to have extremely friendly and helpful staff. In my recent experiences, however, this was dramatically changed.  The last time I tried to eat at Elephant, I was turned away- told they had \"obviously\" closed their wait list a full hour before published close time. That's fine if you take reservations, but they don't, and no one answered the phone when I called to check on wait.  Don't make a customer show up to be turned away at the door, and certainly don't be rude when you do it. Poor form. \n\nTonight I gave Elephant another chance and went back with a friend in from out of town.  Expecting a long wait (per usual), we went to Bacchus next-door for a glass of wine (always a good plan).  When the hostess called to say our table was ready, she made sure to tell us to race over, or she would give our seats away and take us off the wait list, no exceptions.  I returned to Elephant while my buddy cleared his tab, and was told to wait outside like I had just violated the law.  She then refused to seat me without both of us there in front of her. There are so many ways she could have handled this without being rude / mean.  Going out to dinner is supposed to be fun...\n\nLater in the evening the same hostess decided to drop her rain cloud on us again by asking me to \"slide my chair in so servers could get by.\"  This was two hours into our meal, with not a comment from the actual servers, and enough room for a linebacker to pass between me and the guy seated behind.\n\nOur waitress was dramatically nicer, but had limited understanding of the menu- she recommended what she thought was \"popular,\" and was overly attentive- asking what felt like every few minutes if we wanted anything more or the check.\n\nThis makes me sad, because I am local to Elephant, and when they first opened, they were super nice and accommodating. Combined with fantastic food, it was a really special place.  Now the great food is colored by service which is close to the low bar in my years in San Francisco.  The food is worth a visit, but if you are in for the experience, look elsewhere.  Hopefully Elephant will fix this and return to the friendly, fun place it once was.", "author": "Ben M."}

The salmon sashimi is to die for and there are several pretty tasty rolls and apps. Beer is cheap and the setting is intimate and nice.\n\nUnfortunately the past two times I have come here it has progressively gotten much worse. It has taken my gf and I couple of tries but we will NOT RETURN. This is the typical type of place in San Francisco that attracts people that follow other people. The servers develop an understanding that no matter what they will meet their quota and therefore disconnect from providing good service or communication. Hopefully the following real life scenarios will help relay this picture.\n\nThe second time we ate there we ordered all our food and were abruptly informed that we needed to eat quickly because it was last call. Kind of awkward but we got the point. My gf and I both work in restaurants so this is completely understandable. However, our server may have had a communication barrier so she came across a little harsh and condescending. Once again, I was willing to be understanding.\n\nThis last time I went was about a week or so ago. After a fairly short wait I was seated with my gf and other buddy. Our server must have been new to the industry because she kept forgetting our order. For example, we started off by putting in our order for beer/sake, salmon sashimi and the flaming sea bass. We waited awhile, received our beer and sake, and then it happened...nothing!\n\nAfter ample amount of time (15 more minutes) we decided to place our entree order. 15 minutes later our entree appeared. Note we still haven't heard or received anything from our first initial order. \n\nMeanwhile there are 5-6 sushi chefs \"hard at work\" five feet away from us. Lets keep in mind there are only 10 or so two-person tables in this entire restaurant. We reminded her and she quickly disappeared back onto the floor. \n\nAt this point we are all a little annoyed but we knew the sashimi would be worth it. It finally came, thank god! It was as delicious as I remembered it and of course we wanted another order. This time it showed up almost immediately. I know you are probably wondering wtf is going on over there. Yup, me too...\n\nFinally it came time to pay. The 3 of us put our cards down and our server unconfidently informed us we could only split it 2 ways. Now I know how annoying it is to split cards. I have been serving for years and it is definitely one of my pet peeves. However, this server made so many mistakes it seemed audacious to create more problems with us. We were informed we could contact the owners. The whole line of staff were looking at us and we could see them talking under their breaths with condescending smiles. All of the sudden we could palpate the animosity being directed towards us. I felt so disrespected. One of the most unprofessional groups of staff I have ever seen. I have never heard of this sort of situation in my life. \n\nThe take home message is this group of staff collectively don't care about their patrons. They care about turning and burning you. \n\nIf you have any respect for yourself, partner or friends you WILL NOT give these bigots the benefit of the doubt. After all, there are plenty of sushi restaurants in San Francisco that will treat you with respect (even if they do make a couple mistakes). Keep in mind it is just sushi, there are countless combinations of delicious fish dishes and beverages here in the bay area. Why add the taste of disrespect and neglect to your palate when you could be treated with genuine respect?\n\nAfter all, sushi is a representation of Japanese culture; a tradition based on respect and order. Elephant sushi has lost sight of its original aim and for these reasons they have been CHOPPED! \n\nI hope this post helps you to learn from my mistakes, there are countless excellent sushi bars right around the corner...", "author": "Erronious M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-22", "description": "I'm disappointed that I am writing this, as elephant sushi was my favorite sushi restaurant in SF and I live one block away so I would frequent it quite often. I went to dinner with three friends a few weeks ago and we all experienced the worst service we have ever had in our life. Which is a lot to say for four people who've all had their share of bad experiences. It started with our waitress being generally rude and unhelpful when we were trying to ask a question or when it took her 20 mins to give us the bottle of wine we ordered. I have celiac disease so I am on a strict gluten free diet. Usually elephant sushi is great and can make most rolls gf with no problem. I ordered the famous chips and dip, but always get it without the chips. This time it came on the chips (which it has before) so I kindly asked to send it back (since I had explained to the waitress that I have a gluten allergy and have celiac and to inform the chef). She then takes it back in a fuss without apologizing. When she bring its back, I start to eat it and can tell the taste is off. I look at the bottom of the pile of spicy tuna and there are pieces of pita chip crumbs. I then ask to send it back again and she comes back the third time saying they've sold out and is horribly rude and walks away. It being sold out isn't true because most of their rolls have spicy tuna in it (including ones we ordered). Finally our meal comes and all seems to be ok. When she gives us the bill I ask for the other spicy tuna appetizer to come off our bill. We had ordered two to share between 4 people - since it's so good. She gets in a huff again and says she need to call the owner out. I was happy to hear this because I've never had someone be so rude to me about my celiac and so unapologetic if something was mistaken. Especially because at that point I had a high probability of getting sick later. The \"owner\" (still don't know if he is - was also a sushi chef that night) comes out and is even ruder. He said he was the one who took it off the chips and put it on my plate and told the waitress to then lie that they sold out because he was too frustrated to make another one. He then spent the next 5 minutes explaining that if we ate the food then we need to pay for it and couldn't have cared less that we had terribly rude service the entire night or that he had served me food that can make me ill. Multiple other things I'm not even taking the time to describe were said. Mind you, we had spend about $200 and were asking for a $10 appetizer to be taken off the meal because of our terrible experience during that course and I was a loyal customer who has recommended multiple people to go there.  He gets so fed up and eventually says \"fine! We will do whatever you want! I'm going home!\" And storms off. The waitress then comes and drops off the bill. I've never not tipped 20% - even for bad bad service. While debating, I signed, but had the tip blank. The waitress comes over and rips the receipt out of my hand. I call back to her and say I wasn't ready and she says \"you think I'm expecting ANYTHING from you!!???\" And then I asked for the receipt again and the huffs back and says - \"you think I'm going to steal from your bank account????\" - at that point, I left no tip and we all walked to our next destination so we could vent and cool off from this horrible situation we were just in. Nothing I could type could describe how terrible the experience was, but I'd warn ANYONE WITH A STRICT GLUTEN FREE DIET TO NOT COME HERE. I've never been treated so poorly and this was worse than a waiter once listing off issues I could possible have when asking what happens when I eat gluten. It has taken me some time to write this because I was so upset, but needed to make the time to. No ones deserves to get treated so poorly so sending this as a warning to anyone who wants to come here! #RIPnakedscalloproll", "author": "Natalie C."}

They don't offer reservations so if you wanna eat here, be prepared to wait - especially if your party is greater than 2. They only have 3 different seating options if you have a group: 1) small table in the front that seats 4, 2) the sushi bar, 3) a table in the back that usually gets shared between parties. The restaurant itself is pretty small, but very cute - I dig the atmosphere big time and in a utopian Corrina-restaurant-world, all restaurants would be something like Elephant Sushi. The service is A+++; I've never had a bad experience here, albeit waiting 3 hours even. The food is very tasty too - I recommend the Flaming Seabass, Giants roll, and the $2 sake bombs ($2!!!). \n\nNow the wait... it's awful. At least, it CAN be. If you don't mind eating really early or really late, I would recommend coming 10-15 min before opening or closer to closing time if you want to minimize wait. When you're waiting, do yourself a favor and head over to Stones Throw and grab some tasty drinks and apps (and say 'hi' to Jason - head chef extraordinaire). Even though I love this place, I would not bring a bigger group here (i.e. more than 2 people). \n\nRoy C. did good.  Fantastic date spot ;)!", "author": "Corrina S."}

Went around 8h30 on a Thursday night, knew about the wait from previous Yelp reviews so planned accordingly (found a place near by in advance to grab a drink). Waited 45 mins in total to be seated.\nFelt a bit pressured to order as we sat down as the waitress came to us a few times in a very short interval. \nFinally ordered the hamachi truffle, blue fin tuna and beastie boys to start off.\nHamachi truffle was disapointing as didn't quite ge tthe truffle taste as I was hoping for.\nBlue fin tuna was also disapointing as the slices were so thin. In my opinion,you need a good chunk of blue fin tuna so actually appreciated it's buttery texture. Cut it too thin and just tasted like regular tuna.\nThe beastie boys was quite good however, a bomb of richness and flavour in one bite! \n\nContinued with the red and yellow roll (not memorable at all as I had to look up what I had ordered in the menu...) and the flaming seabass. The seabass was delicious, rish and creamy sauce served warm. \nWe also had the white out roll but I can't remember what it tasted like to give a constructive feedback. \n\nBeing the bottomless pits we are, we were still hungry after this and wanted to order some more rolls. However, we were advised that the kitchen had run out of rice for the night and only sashimis and salads were available. Disapointed, but still hungry, we opted to try their mix sashimi plate (nothing out of the ordinanry from any other sushi joint, can't say it was fresher than what we are used to back home) and the anago (which was served without rice but very tasty nonetheless). \n\nOverall, it was a enjoayble experience given we were on vacation and got to enjoy a rice stroll in Russian hill. Some of the dishes were quite good (beastie boys, flaming seabass and anago), but the rest were just ok. Maybe it's just us who were too hyped out about getting the 'freshiest sushi ever' but it was not any different from the places we go to back home in terms of fish quality.", "author": "Victoria X."}

They don't serve lunch.\n(2) YOU MUST SIT AT THE BAR BECAUSE THE SUSHI CHEF IS AWESOME.\n(3) The Flaming Sea Bass is good, but don't pass up the White Out roll. It was my absolute favorite.\n(4) Ask the chef to recommend something, he won't disappoint.\n\n If I had to pick a \"favorite\" food, sushi would probably be it.

I called up my standard sushi spots but everything was over booked.  So I decided to turn to Yelp to see what other options were available, hoping to find a new spot.  \n\nThis place showed up with 4.5 stars and I figured, o.k., this has to be the best place ever!  It's anything but.  \n\nAfter being seated it took 10 minutes for our server to notice we were sitting there.  We literally had to reach out at her to find out who was going to serve us.  We ordered our food, which took another 10 or 15 minutes to come out.  First, they brought out my girlfriend's sushi roll without ours.  She had trouble ordering a california roll because apparently they don't have it on the menu (despite being able to create Rainbow Rolls which are effectively California Rolls with fish on top).\n\nAnyways, they brought out their \"flaming\" sushi roll which is all for show.  You have to watch your sushi cook for 5 minutes on the table when all you really want to do is eat the sushi because you have an empty stomach.   After you unravel the metal wrapping surrounding the sushi roll, you find a sushi roll which looks like a combination of eggs, bacon, hot sauce, and who knows what else.\n\nAs you try to reach in with your chopsticks to pick up the roll that is extremely unappetizing to look at, you find out that the sushi is soft and soup-like.  It's so soft that it crumbles as you grab on to it, resulting in a mess all over your table.  \n\nThe most significant problem with this place is that the fish was not fresh at all.  Between waiting 10 minutes or longer for each order to come out, the horrible fish, unexpected hot sauce on the sushi that wasn't described on the menu, the inability of the servers to figure out where to put plates (answer: on the table), and the server's lack of knowledge about sushi, this place is horrible.  \n\nSeriously: don't eat here.", "author": "Nick O."}

There are less than 10 tables in the entire restaurant, most of which are two seaters, which adds to the coziness of it all. When making the reservation, request for the two seater by the window as you'll receive the quintessential San Franciscan view of Hyde St. The interior is dimly lit and aiming for a more modern-rustic flair. \n\nI'm usually a specialty roll kinda gal when it comes to sushi and I'm wary with sashimi and the like. However, I tried literally everything from sashimi-based orders and nigiri to full fledged house rolls because every single dish was to die for. My personal favorite is a tie between the Flaming Sea Bass Roll and the Hamachi Truffle Appetizer. \n\nThe Sea Bass roll is served to you on a flaming platter inside an aluminum foil and all the hoopla about this is accurate. It's coated in layers of cream & sauces and wrapped around with fresh and deliciously flamed sea bass. Definitely a must-get order if you're dining here. As someone who isn't a huge fan of raw fish, I completely devoured the Hamachi truffle appetizer. It's fresh and cured so finely that it melts with the texture of butter in your mouth. And the accompanying sauce opens the natural flavor of the dish even more. I also enjoyed the beasty boys uni house specialty dish - it's creamy, has egg yolk and something that looks like tofu in it. Sounds like an ecclectic mix but tastes like it was made for each other. \n\nSo whether you're a fan of the cooked fishies or simply love the raw ones, Elephant Sushi has a wide quality selection for you in a unpretentious and casual ambiance.

So yes all the reviews are correct in that this place has the longest line ever when you show up with no reservations. They do take reservations but its only for a very specific period of time so if you want to avoid all the waiting, there is an option for you. The surrounding area is a nice neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant is no different. It is definitely on the small side hence the wait but the d\u00e9cor is nice. I will say that given it's a tiny place, its definitely on the louder side for a restaurant but that's just indicative of the place being filled up so quickly because the food is solid. \n\nI thought this place overall had great rolls and different combination ideas for the sushi. I was pretty pleased but let me not get too ahead of myself. We obviously ordered the hot sake (how could you not) and started firing through food orders. We ordered the Flaming Sea Bass roll, Hamachi truffle, beastie boys, and the White out roll. This place first starts you off with some house made ginger which is pretty delish. We received the Hamachi first which was a solid performer... probably not the best ive had but definitely worth the nod. The White out roll came out next which is really solid. Its very simple and fresh but just absolute solid dish. The Flaming Sea Bass roll was next and of course the presentation was fun to watch. I really did enjoy this roll but the sauces and everything was a bit too much for me personally. With that said its definitely something I would order again but simply have my counterpart take more of it down. Finally the beastie boys... which I must warn is really for those who love Uni I feel. I am a big fan of uni and the combination that they topped this off was just a great treat. If you are not a Uni fan however, I would recommend something else.\n\nAll in all, another solid sushi joint in SF and a spot I have already hit up a few times since going my first time.

We were seated with the first round of diners and the service was really great. The space is pretty small - around 10 tables or so plus a small bar area. Be warned though: the tables are tiny! I'm a petite gal and I felt like I had no room to eat. The food is served on plates that take up more space than necessary...Typical sushi prices and presentation - nothing really won me over so I doubt I'd return.", "author": "Jenny W."}

This is probably one of the top 2-3 sushi places I've been to in the city (its peers are: Zushi Puzzle, Okoze, and Akiko's)\n\nIts a fantastic cozy spot with a great ambience (though it does smell a little, and Im guessing this has to do with the remodel + fish -- please fix this) \n\nMy picks off the menu:\n1. Hamachi Truffle appetizer - hamachi in truffle oil, sprinkled with slices of fried garlic. My friend and I were blown away with the quality of this dish \n\n2. Sea Bass Roll - a sushi roll wrapped in Chilean sea bass and brought to the table in a flaming plate, inside aluminum foil. Once the flames die down, we were pleasantly surprised with a flame-grilled sea bass and flanking the sushi roll -- and it was DELISH\n\n3. Walu Sashimi - this fish was so rich, tender, and savory that it didn't feel like fish at all; rather, it tasted like game hen or chicken. A fabulous sashimi dish for those of us disinclined towards to the straight up raw meat \n\n4. Himalayan Trout - I'm not one for sashimi, but the way this meat was cured (with himalayan rock salt and garlic ponzu among other things) made it simply excellent\n\n5. Albacore Tuna Roll - the hint of honey mustard and the plentiful meat in this dish makes it savory with a little kick - love this. \n\n6. They made us an ice cream sushi dessert that was just mind blowing - probably one of the top 5 desserts I've had in the city \n\nThe service is friendly and very accommodating (thank you for all that iced water ;) ), a bit overwhelmed though (probably one of their first Friday nights). Overall, great staff!!\n\nI am so sold on this place that I actually suggested it for a friend's birthday dinner and I will be there tonight again. Can't wait!", "author": "Meghana D."}

When we were heading towards the table, we heard the hostess tell a group of 3 that it'd be a 1.5 hour wait. So yes, get there early!! \n\nAs for the food, we got 2 omakase sashimi. Delicious. The salmon especially was absolutely mouthwatering. The chefs were generous with their cuts, even with the o-toro nigiri! \n\nAll is all, with beers and tea, the bill came out to be ~$150 with tip for a party of 3. \n\nService was hectic, but expected when there's that many people in such a small space. The only thing that brought this down to 4 stars is that the other fusion foods were not done as well.

This is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. I was still eating and my group was still ordering drinks. Our bill was practically $200 so it wasn't like we were bums just loitering around to waste time. They should've told us the restaurant rule prior to us sitting down. \n\nThe group of 5 that we were sharing tables with, also got kicked out as they were drinking their beers.

If you like sushi you must try this place out. \n\nWe started off with a couple of Hello Kitty martinis, which were very reasonably process due to Happy Hour (all night) and the Hawaiian Poki salad. Poki was ahi tuna and wonderful. It's more of a salad so the tuna is mixed with seaweed. Mayonnaise dressing was good.\n\nThe sushi was the best past. We ordered the Flaming Sea Bass, Whiteout, and Boom Box. Very, very distinct flavors between the three. Whiteout has a very citrusy, like flavor, which you usually don't get with sushi. The Boom Box had toasted bananas on the top. Very sweet and probably wouldn't opt for that next time (tasted like dessert). Flaming Sea Bass is very unique and absolutely mouthwatering. It's cooked right in front of you on gasoline for 8 minutes. So it's hot sushi, which I've never had before. Definitely getting that the next time I go. \n\nService was five out of five.

Even when it was done, I just kept scraping the leftover sauce and rice from the foil. It was pathetic but worth it! \nThe yummy pockets were made of fresh scallops that were tossed in spicy mayo dressing and roe and it nested on the best tasting inari (tofu and sweet vinegared rice) in the world. \nThe truffle hamachi was just as beautiful. It had flakes of black truffle on top of the freshest hamachi in all of the land.\nThe last thing that came was the salmon roll and it was amaaaazing! The avocado, fresh salmon sashimi and the crispy garlic was just an explosion of awesomeness!\n\nOverall, if I could afford to eat ONLY elephant sushi food I would.

Immediately after we sat at the bar, the very friendly sushi chef started us off with a complimentary tasting of their delicious seared hamachi with truffle oil. We then followed up with a tuna and heirloom tomato salad, hamachi and albacore nigiri, and a whiteout roll (hamachi and butterfish), and washed it all down with a couple $2 sake bombs. Strangely, nobody else was downing sake bombs, but I guess the Russian Hill crowd is a little too sedate for that.  Elephant Sushi is definitely a great addition to Russian Hill, and probably has the best sushi in the North Beach/Russian Hill area. Definitely will be back for more.\n\nIt was very crowded on Friday night, but they do take reservations. There was a line out the door, but we were seated promptly after arriving on time for our 8pm reservation.", "author": "Allen T."}

But luckily there are wine bars around this place, so put your name down, leave your number and hit up one of the nice little wine bars around. Want to go to a bar? Head to Polk 2 blocks away, make sure you walk up and down Green street if you do decide to go to Polk, Union has a nasty little hill there. *Side Note* Make sure you don't bring a party of friends, it's best to come with 2,3  at most 4 people or you'll be waiting forever.\n\nBack to the restaurant- it delicious! The place is small, cute, a bit dark but definitely serves up some mean rolls. I went with two other friends, so we just ordered rolls and shared. It's the best way to go. Sake Bombs were $2. We ordered the the Chips and Dip, only 4 Wanton chips come on this dish with a spicy tuna poke and good mustard sauce to top it off. We also got the Flaming Seabass which is pretty much a hit at every table. They cook it up right in front of you for about ten mins and open it up with its ready for you to eat. It's nice and saucy. We also got the Double Albacore roll, it was great! Another saucy roll with fresh Albacore bites to leave you happy. You like fresh fish without a lot of sauce? The Whiteout roll is the thing for you! The butterfish which is thick and fresh and leaves you craving more. You can't go wrong with the Ya Man roll either, the salmon is amazing thick cut as well, simple and good! \n\nI wish we kept ordering. It gets a bit pricey but I must say, your in for a treat when you come here. None of this canned, imitation stuff here. We're talking about thick, fresh, meaty fish.

Himalayan trout, walu capprachio, basil salmon (off the hook), ya man roll,  and pretty much everything else on the menu is the bomb.\n\nService is awesome - Nesa at the front is so nice and so accommodating she's awesome. Sit at the front and the sushi chefs will give you tastings.  MAKE SURE TO BUY THEM DRINKS - they will drink with you.  \n\nPrice point is great for the quality of food.

They had good quality fish and the sushi was well made and professional. The service was good and you always sat down with some seared escolar in ponzu sauce and truffle oil compliments of the house. Now the service sucks, the quality of the fish is dubious and most of all, the sushi is terribly made!  A huge ball of rice with minimal amounts of the fish. And, sitting at the bar, those preparing the food had majorly dubious sanitation standards. Made me lose my appetite. Throwing pieces of fish on the ground, at each other, throwing raw egg white on the ground, wiping their noses with the back of their hand or the smock they were wearing. So gross. Never coming back.

The salmon avocado was the most boring of the rolls we ordered, but it's the first time in a long time that the salmon actually took center stage in the roll- it was very fresh and the taste balanced well with the avocado. \n\nThere was a bit of a wait when we got there so we eventually opted for the communal table, but this was great because we could scope out what others were ordering before making our decision.", "author": "Ivana J."}

In the meantime, we enjoyed our Red and Yellow roll - Tuna and Mango. That was very fresh and delicious. Finally it was time to dig into the Flaming Seabass - oh my goodness. I'm not the biggest fan of creamy sauces on sushi but this was perfection in every bite. The rolls were not rice dense, meaning we had room for a THIRD roll. We ordered the Ya Man - a fresh salmon roll.

Although not the most authentic Japanese cuisine, Elephant Sushi is one of my favorite places to come for rolls. They've gotten creative with their menu, while still letting the fish shine through. My boyfriend and I had the omekaze sashimi, which was a sampler plate of different slices of raw fish. Without the rice, it was a great way to really get a taste for the quality of their fish. Each piece was slightly different, and I loved how some were already paired with lemon zest and wasabi bits so you know exactly what flavors they want to blend. The Flaming Seabass is a popular roll, as it's baked at your table with a hot blue flame. Although I typically stay away from Americanized rolls that are dripping with mayo or stuffed with cream cheese, the Flaming Seabass was not this at all. The table bake gave the entire roll a smoky flavor that was delicious when paired with the freshness of the fish. It's definitely a saucier roll, but definitely something fun to try. Their more standard rolls like the spicy tuna and the salmon avocado are also really good, particularly with the perfect sushi rice.

I am not a salmon person, but the salmon sashimi was outstanding! I tried the white out roll... based on other yelp reviews and recommendations... while the truffle oil oddly worked, it was way to rich to have more than 2 or 3 pieces. I would recommend trying this if you come with a larger group (for 2 people it was a little overwhelming). The flaming sea bass roll was also great! The one thing we ordered that I would highly recommend against (in all fairness, our waitress also told us it wasnt her favorite) is the monkfish liver. We figured we would try something new... it did not pay off. OH! also... they give each table home-made pickled ginger in a mason jar (this could not  have made me any happier!) it was delicious! \n\nAlso, the staff was wonderful. Very friendly and on top of things. I would definitely come back here. Make a reservation if you can as we had to wait about 20 minutes, worth the wait though!", "author": "Jess K."}

I can't fathom eating it again.\n\nElephant Sushi is not like that AT ALL. Every roll was made to perfection.\n\nThe only downside to this place was they didn't have any miso soup on the menu :( I think this place recently opened so maybe it will be on the menu down the line. \n\nAlso, there weren't many maki rolls to choose from buy the ones that were on the menu were amazing!! The fish was so clean and fresh tasting. It really the best sushi I have had so far! \n\nThe restaurant itself is small but the ambiance really sets the mood in this place. Fun music, dark wood and dimly lit lights transform this place. The hostess working the night we were there was so nice and easy to talk to; almost like you were meeting a friend. Every table was sat but Within 10 minutes of getting there, we were seated and our waiter promptly came over to take our order. We ordered the spicy hamachi, flaming sea bass and boom box( this was a super unique roll with scallop, sweet soy glaze, garlic chips and a banana). Our server was also very understanding when we asked if we could have all the rolls sliced thinly. It might be an odd request but he did so without blinking an eye. Even returning after we received our rolls to see if they were sliced thinly enough. Extra points for also bribing over two sides of spicy mayo so my husband and I wouldn't fight over it.  We were hungry but snacked on the large jar of house made pickled ginger and soy. The rolls came over in record time. We devoured the spicy hamachi while our flaming sea bass cooked away table side. After the fire went out we opened up the tin foil and enjoyed the hot sea bass roll. The flavors were amazing and melted in your mouth. My favorite part was picking at the crispy sticky rice as the bottom of the tin foil that was covered in yummy sauce\nThe real star to me was the boom box. It is so elegantly put together and the combo of spicy scallops to sweet banana and flavorful garlic chips is a must try!!! \n\nI can't wait to go back to this place! Also, after your dinner you can take a walk up to swensens for some yummy dessert.", "author": "Whitney S."}

My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday night around 7:30 and we only had to wait 30 minutes before getting a table. The atmosphere was very romantic and trendy and we enjoyed our table in the corner by the window. The restaurant was full of people and was a little noisy since it is very small. After our amazing appetizer of the Himalayan Trout, I knew this restaurant was a new favorite. The fish was so fresh and I love the garlic ponzu they put on it.  We followed our appetizer with the white out roll, the red and yellow roll, and the sizzling sea bass roll. The white out was definitely my favorite out of the three because it was very delicate and delicious. The red and yellow roll was good, but the mango in the dish had no flavor and wasn't ripe. The sizzling sea bass was also very delicious and we enjoyed watching it cook right in front of us. We had a wonderful experience and absolutely loved the food.

Walking in, I noticed the nice dark decor which looked quite welcoming. So from there it should of been a good night of food and drink or so I thought...\n\nSo lets talk service... From the get go the service was sub par, I don't expect quick snap snap service but when you walk by without even a glance while I raise my hand to have my order taken? Yea thats not very nice... Other than that, I could care a bit less for the service.\n\nSo lets go food instead...so browsing through the menu I see a bunch of interesting items..And the ordering commences - \n\n- Hamachi Truffle - ok this can be good, but PLEASE lay off the truffle oil! You are drowning the fish and its taste! How unfortunate...sometimes less is more..\n\n- Whiteout - seared butterfish...hamachi..avocado..garlic ponzu. Now this would of been really good, but no it fell down flat too. Searing the fish with the torch can bring out different flavors. I can't taste the flavors though when you've overdone it and all I taste is the remnants of the gas from your torch. Whoa..another flop..what?!\n\n- Seared Mackerel - ok something really struck me hard now when I ate this dish. First off there really was not much of it. Mackerel is not an expensive fish, it is actually considered to some as the \"poor\" mans fish. But the flavors on mackerel can be quite simple but exquisite at times if done right. UNFORTUNATELY this dish did not do very well. The mackerel was overpowered once again with the remnants of gas and too much of this strange sauce. *sigh*\n\nBy this time I was quite displeased with my visit. I spent money on food that should of been good but was unoriginal and poor in taste. It actually makes me pretty upset. I mean think about it, you go out expecting a night of some good food and drink and you end up with a stomach that is full from food that was not even sub-par. And worst of all you had to pay for it....\n\nFunny thing is that after writing this review and reminiscing it hit me that I have ordered these exact three dishes at Saru Sushi Bar in Noe Valley...from the torched mackerel that I raved about there to the Hamachi Truffle. Now if I am not mistaken something seems a bit strange, already execution was a miss, as well as the presentation...but using the same names? I dont know...coincidence? I dont really think so..\n\nWell, I don't want to go back to Elephant Sushi to find out but if I'm going to get my fix of those dishes with some fresh fish especially the torched Mackerel I'm heading over to Saru Sushi Bar instead...", "author": "phillip w."}

I personally had the spicy tuna-$7, and the kobe dragon-$15. The tuna was melt in your mouth and for the price, a steal. The kobe dragon was a pretty unique mix of mildly sweet relish, mint flavors, backed by a crunchy and creamy cucumber/avocado interior, with the saltier seared beef on top. One of the chefs personally brought this dish out, which I thought was a nice touch. For the $15 you do get 8 rolls, so I would give the recommendation, especially for the non sashimi eating type. \n\nAnyways, two big thumbs up!", "author": "Moose T."}

On top of innovative rolls, they also have incredible sashimi- generous portions of buttery goodness. I had the Walu, Salmon and Tuna last time I was there and I left craving more.

We had to waive down a waitress just to even get the menu. \n\nIt wasn't officially on the menu, but I asked for a California roll. The waitress said they don't make California rolls. Seriously?!

She checked with the chef, and said they'll make it. I then asked to make sure to put tobiko on it. \n\nMy California roll was brought out first, way before anyone else's food was brought.

Of course, my California roll didn't have any tobiko on it, so I had to ask them to go add it. \n\nSo now to the eating part. I thought maybe the service is not good, but the food must be good!

We were the first in line since the wait is always over an hour. I was super excited to take my friends from out of town here. We told the host that we had 6 people in our party and she told us they didn't seat parties larger than 4. We asked if we can sit in a certain area that could possibly fit all of us, but it was reserved. We asked if we could put tables together and they refused because that was their policy and the size of the place isn't very big. We were very frustrated because they have a large table in the back that probably fits 8 people but they wouldn't sit us there. Instead they sat 4 of us at the large table and the rest of us close by, but not close enough to enjoy and engage with our friends. Then they sat 2 random ladies next to our group of 4, which makes no sense at all! The place wasn't even full! After a few minutes, the 2 ladies got up and told us they were leaving the restaurant and offered us their seats. We continued to ask the servers if they could sit us together. We knew they felt bad but it wasn't up to them. The lady, who I believe is the owner kept saying \"NO! Absolutely not!\" She was so unbelievably inconsiderate and wouldn't accommodate us what so ever. She was being very passive aggressive saying \"you don't have to eat here if you don't want to.\" I wanted to punch her in the face for her attitude and lack of customer service. After all this hassle, we got up and left. She gave us a fake ass smile and said \"have a good night.\" \n\nI work in a very high end salon in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-04", "description": "Woah. What a welcome addition to Hyde Street and the general void in the Nob/Russian/North Beach area between cheap, questionably fresh sushi and ultra-pricey, 'is that really a roll?' spots like Okoze across the street. \n\nElephant Sushi is amazing. Service was very attentive - though we went early (6 pm) and the whole space was filled by the time we left 1.5 hours later. Our waiter was helpful in letting us know what the more popular dishes were on the menu, and within 5 minutes of sitting down one of the chefs behind the sushi bar sent out a sea bass/pepper/ponzu sashimi plate (the Suzuki) on the house. Pair that with the discovery of a $2 sake bomb all night happy hour, as well as their amazing house-made ginger & soy sauce, and dinner was off to a great start.\n\nWe ordered the Crudo starter, double hamachi roll, assorted sashimi and the flaming sea bass, and all four were outstanding. I'm not the biggest fan of truffle oil, as most applications overpower whatever else you're trying to eat, but the hamachi truffle combo in the Crudo was done well. The scallops used for the Crudo, paired with a few drops of fresh lemon juice, were possibly my favorite flavors of the night.\n\nThe sashimi, as all other reviews have already covered, is outstanding - huge cuts of fish sliced expertly, and so fresh you can almost taste the ocean. To give you a sense of the freshness of the fish each night, we arrived right as they opened and the two chefs behind the counter were unwrapping dozens of just-packaged fillets straight from the market before arranging them under the glass.\n\nFinal notes - the double hamachi & flaming sea bass are so drastically different from each other that it's hard to compare, but if getting the flaming sea bass I'd recommend saving it for last as it's a much bolder combo of flavors than the lighter fish-focused rolls. Both were incredible, though I enjoyed the Hamachi more, and the portions are generous for the price.\n\nI think my GF said it best in her comment card: 'Elephant Sushi, I love you. Please don't change.' Assuming they maintain the portions, pricing, menu and momentum they've established in these first few months, I'll be looking forward to every meal here. And there will be lots.", "author": "Alan C."}

Then we got a table right at the back in the dark because of this.\n\nThen later on, we ordered another drink, we finished our meal and the check was brought over immediately, too quickly, as we hadn't finished their drinks. \n\nTen mins later the rude owner/hostess asked us to finish up as the next people were waiting! She had not said that there was a time limit on the table when we sat down and we had not been there for very long! When we said we were still finishing our drinks, she went away.

I had never had warm sushi before. \n\nWe also had the Boom Box, Ya Man, and one more that I can't remember the name, but it was spicy. Both of my friends loved all of them, but I didn't particularly like the Boom Box because it had a sweetness that I didn't care for. \n\nSeems like an American-take on sushi so if you're looking for authentic I would check the menu first.

I came here with friends on my birthday because we wanted to try something new. Let's just say we rolled the dice on a jackpot. \n\nFor starters, I LOVE sake bombs and this place has them for $2. Yes, seriously two dollars. That alone blew my mind and made me happy. I don't know if they'll be able to keep offering them at that price forever, but it's freaking awesome right now. \n\nThen there's the amazing service from server to chef. Our server was very attentive and super friendly. The owner/chef caught word that it was my birthday and sent us a surprise round of soju lychee martinis - they were terrific and the gesture was much appreciated. It also goes to show that this place really cares about its customers.\n\nOk and then there's the Flaming Sea Bass Roll - YUMMMMM! It comes out as described, flaming. Once the flame goes out, the flavor inside leaves you craving more and more. I only had one minor comment of improvement for them on this roll - to work to make it stick together a little better. Given how seriously they take customer comments, I'm sure they've already fixed this. \n\nThat's another thing, they ask for customer feedback. They're all about continuous improvement. This also impresses me. I wish more restaurants listened to their customers. \n\nOverall, I can easily give this place 5 stars.

I assumed this place would offer something more traditional or unique, but it very much caters to customers that load up on rolls and don't appreciate real sushi.  Overall quality of the fish was good.\n\nService - we (my husband and I) walked in at 6pm on Sat night and were surprised to get a seat at the sushi bar, but that's where the good service ended.  Once we finished our sushi orders (still had a drink to finish!) the hostess immediately brought us our check.  The server came over and apologetically encouraged us to stay and finish our beers.  As soon as we settled the check the hostess was over again, cleaning up our area and hinting that we should be on our way.  As we were finishing our beer, it wasn't more than 2 mins after we settled the bill that the hostess came over to us (again!) and said. \"um, excuse me, I've already called the next party for this spot.\"  Really?  After spending over $100, you're going to have the nerve to kick me out and tell me when its time for me to leave?  I could understand if we had been there chatting for another 30-45 mins and not ordered anything else, but that wasn't what happened.  We were told we needed to leave immediately after we paid the bill.\n\nI walked out of the restaurant and told my husband I will NEVER be back again.

Ask for some reccomendations, but everything we had was excellent.

It comes wrapped in foil over a dish filled with oil. The waitress lights it up and we see it cook for 7 minutes or so. Then the waitress comes back and takes it out and puts it on a plate.

Very nicely decorated spot with a fair amount of seating and a pretty nice casual ambiance that is great for a date. Our server was extremely nice and was really awesome with helping us choose our other plates, since we really only knew about the sushi roll that's on fire (disclaimer: The Flaming Sea Bass is actually just seared using vodka, sake, and salt as fuel for 4 minutes).\n\nI immediately asked about the $2 sake bomb deal since I was having trouble finding it on the menu. Its still honored so that was music to my ears. He even came out with some hamachi on the house from the chef!\n\nWe ordered a few things to try and nothing disappointed. Mussels were standard for an appetizer. The hamachi on a rock salt block was pretty deliciously memorable since it was very freshly cut and presented on a huge salty slab. You could rub the slices of fish on the slab to taste. The Flaming Sea Bass was good for a \"baked\" style roll but I would go for a baked lobster or salmon roll if I was to choose again.\n\nI'd come here again but there were no game changers. Great place to get a bite and drinks with a few friends before going out. The place was packed by the time we left at 7-ish, so come early or be ready to wait.", "author": "John N."}

I came here with the girlfriend on a Wednesday night on a whim and were seated right away. The place was about half-full and lively. Appropriately-volumed 80s/90s music in the background and a cozy setting make it comfortable to talk without feeling like either a morgue or a club. The waitress (co-owner) was friendly and chatting, the head chef (co-owner and husband of waitress) came around to the table and said hi and even dropped off a free appetizer to try while we looked at the menu.\n\nThe appetizer was a Truffle Hamachi -- the first bit was all truffle which then smoothly dissolved into great fish and citrus flavor, it was delicious.\nThe Double Hamachi roll -- A good start, but I felt was almost overpowered by citrus flavor drowning out the fish. Still tasty.\nThe Red and Yellow roll -- Thin mango slices on top of a spicy roll balance out really well, with great presentation in a bowl.\nYellowtail roll - Simple and fresh\nSake nigiri -- Fresh and tasty\n\n\nOverall the food presentation and style was a more casual, modern sushi with unique ingredients and flavors.

We have our go to (cheaper) sushi place we frequent regularly, but Elephant Sushi is our special occasion sushi place.  Tip #1: They take reservations for the first seating, but you have to call when they're open to make a reservation.  They aren't on OpenTable and you can't leave a message.  Get there when they open the doors and you won't have to wait.  Also they will not seat you unless your whole party is there.  I totally understand this policy.  It's a small place and they need to turn the tables.  They can't have someone sitting there not ordering because they are waiting for the rest of their party.  So plan ahead.  Tip #2: Take public transit or a cab, parking is tough in that neighborhood.  Enough logistics, on to the food.\n\nFlaming Sea Bass.  AMAZING!  Himalayan Trout on salt slab.  DELICIOUS!

The only negatives I can think of are that they might be slightly understaffed and it took us some time to get the waitress's attention on multiple occasions, and the temperature was either really warm (thanks to their flaming seabass roll that grills on your table) or super cold when they open the door. We would totally come back though and I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Karen T."}

They are correct that Elephant is not traditional. It's an innovative sushi bistro. At the same time, the tightly packed rice balls of canned crab these reviewers are looking for so they can dunk them in soy sauce and wasabi, are not traditional either. Neither is the bought-in, precooked eel, smothered in sugar sauce so unfortunately ubiquitous on sushi menus.

We landed on Elephant Sushi, as I had only been once when they had just opened. I arrived around 8pm without a reservation, and was expecting about a 45min wait. Almost an hour and a half later, we were finally seated. The place is really tiny, so I wasn't horribly upset or surprised. What was a bit unsettling was the pair of girls who arrived about 10 min before us, and got seated at the same time....although I know that wasn't the restaurant's fault...but rather the universe confirming my sense of poor timing. The girls were seated directly next to us, and were immediately brought a complimentary appetizer. We stared at them with sad faces for about 10 minutes until we finally received ours. We then ordered beers, which were served without glasses -- and let me just say...I'm a beer girl. I can drink it out of anything. But when I'm at a nice restaurant and have been dreaming about this beer for the past 90 minutes, can a girl just get a glass like the rest of the restaurant? Our waiter finally took our order, but not before he took the girls' next to us. He seemed annoyed by us (even though we had been nothing but nice) and way more into the girls at the next table. I mean, they were cute, I get it.....but I'm starving and at this point I really felt like I had worked for my meal. Aside from the service, the food was great. The roll with the banana is definitely my favorite, and the homemade pickled ginger was so good I basically turned it into my entree.

As it happens, they allow reservations only for 6:00 and we went last minute that day. While we were there (Saturday night), I should note that people seemed to be seated within 20 minutes, but I don't know if that's a fluke or not.\n\nI had heard outstanding reviews of this place and was eager to try it out after my bad experience at Tamashi on Union Street. We were greeted with a sample of their butterfish sashimi which was outstanding! I was also happy to see a whole jar of ginger brought out to us since my boyfriend and I love ginger, but immediately wondered if they bothered to change  and wash out the jars since I noticed people using their chopsticks to get ginger out instead of the tongs that it came with. Luckily, the waitress said that they change the ginger. I realize now I should have asked if they wash the jars in between!\n\nWe ordered a few rolls and nigiri. The bottom line is that the more \"fancy\" they try to get, the worse the roll was. But let's start with the basics: rice. The first order that came out was our eel nigiri. It was beautifully presented with the long eel folded back upon itself and the flavor of the eel was delicious, but it was unwieldy. The piece was too long to carry on chopsticks and to make matters worse, the rice fell apart! Not just with this piece, but with later orders. Rice should be a rudimentary skill for master sushi makers and our rice was falling all over the place. Minus a star!\n\nThe best of the evening was the \"White Out\" roll which had an incredible balance of flavors. We had another roll with that that I don't recall other than it was ok. After that, we had one more special which featured tuna and mango. We were told it would be mildly spicy, but it was not AT ALL. I'm not one for very spicy so that was ok. I LOVE mango, but in this instance, it completely overpowered the fish, which I don't like 1) because I love the flavor of fresh, raw fish and if we're paying for it, I want to taste it and 2) it makes me wonder why the chef would choose to cover the flavor of the fish... was it going bad? That said, it was a delicious mango dish, not a delicious sushi dish.\n\nI constantly saw the flaming roll again going out to almost every other table. What is it with these flaming rolls? It's already been admitted to me by servers that they're just for show so why order it? To each their own though. \n\nI like the idea of interesting combinations - crispy garlic with sushi is delicious. Olive oil overpowers it. WAY too heavy. However, I still prefer to taste the flavor of the fish above all else. Sushi isn't cheap so why cover up what we pay for? I think these guys should keep it simple or stay along the lines of what they accomplished with the White Out roll.", "author": "Maria Y."}

We sat down, ordered sake and told the waitress that we'd order from the chef. The waitress replied, \"The chef prefers that you order from the waitstaff.\"  Um.. What?  \"OK\", I replied, \"Just bring us the bill for our sake and we'll be on our way\". This seemed to shock the waitress and chef, so the chef agreed to serve us at the bar. I asked the Chef, \"What's the point of having a bar if you're not going to interact with your customers\". Bizarre. I almost asked the chef if he even trained in a sushi bar. But whatever... The fish was ok. The rice in the nigiri was pretty good. We won't be coming back.", "author": "Da Wei S."}

What a disappointment!\n\nIf your idea of a sushi restaurant is to go to a \"look at how hip we are\" place blasting loud hip hop in your ears while trying to order any basic sushi plate, hearing only \"oh sorry, we don't do this kind of sushi here. But look at our other overpriced items, don't they have COOL names like BEASTIE BOYS ROLLS!\" \n\nThen yes, that would be the place for you.\n\nReally? No California rolls? No miso soup? Oh right, they're trying to be \"different.\"\n\nEvery plate we tried tasted blend. The fish was clearly not fresh. All the time I was thinking to myself \"How can you mess up sushi?\" \n\nThis is very frustrating for a not-so-cheap restaurant.\n\nSave yourself your money and go to a more authentic sushi place in the Tenderloin.", "author": "Francois C."}

As it was chilly and windy out and there was no room to wait inside, we walked down the block to have a drink while we waited. The hostess called with in 15 minutes and unfortunately my husband didn't answer right away.  Seeing the missed call, we rushed back to find out our table had been given away.

I am planning to call my bank for dispute tomorrow and I am definitely not happy about how these guys charged extra for nothing. PLEASE keep your customer receipt just in case.\n\n Okay so where do I start? Although I've made no comments/reviews of such restaurants, I've been yelping since 2008 and it was my first time ever how 4 star restaurants in yelp have betrayed my expectation.\n\n There is no place to park nearby whatsoever so prepare to park 10 blocks away or take a cab. When we entered elephant sushi, we were informed that two customers have just left the bar so we can take a seat as soon as waiter/waitress cleans it. We waited about 25 minutes to take a seat, pretty much staring at an empty bar all day waiting for our assigned waitress to appear from the back room.\n\n We ordered assorted sashimi, salmon nigiri and double albacore roll. ALL of their food was salty to the max. I'd say their nigiri and roll was edible. But my god their sashimi was the worst piece of sushi I've ever had in my life. It was not fresh at all, marinated in a way that they've made the fish taste like a mixture of pure oil and salt. The waiter forgot to order assorted sashimi plate so we waited extra 30 minutes for this poorly flavored overpriced sashimi.\n\n Oh also this place does not have edamame, unagi (they don't have unagi AT ALL) toro and many others. I mean which sushi bar/restaurant does not sell unagi? UNAGI? The food is bad and overpriced, the service was terrible, they overcharged 8$ on top of my bill.

Maybe I'm a purist, but I don't like my sushi rolls drenched in sauce and BBQ'd over an open flame while wrapped in foil. I ordered a couple rolls and a bunch of different nigiri. The rolls are certainly creative and that is clearly their main draw, but the nigiri was just ok.

But, the way I was treated by your new hostess last night was ridiculous. I live across the street from this place and have come here many times for dinner with no problems at all. But last night was a different story. I went over to put my name and phone number on the waiting list per usual and came back an hour later to check where my boyfriend and I stood on the list. I pointed to my name on the list to the hostess which caused her to jumped back away from me dramatically.  Hugging her clipboard tightly to her chest, she asked me to recite my phone number to her....like I was lying to her or something to get a table sooner?? Do people do that? Anyways, later, after finally getting the call our table was ready, my boyfriend and I walked inside and headed straight for the two open spots at the bar. The hostess then ran after us and told us to wait until the table was ready. Confused, I told her that it was ready and pointed to the bar, and she said, \"oh sorry I thought you wanted THAT table over there...okay you can go sit down\". \"Thanks\".   We continue walking to take our seats at the bar and then the hostess runs towards us AGAIN and blocks my boyfriend from sitting down and tells him he has to put his name on the list first. WTF?!   I told her he is with me and she said, \"oh sorry I only noticed your face\"... whatever that means. I thought the torment from this crazy person was over but sadly not. As I was taking a bite of my (delicious) sushi the hostess comes up behind me and scoots in my chair like I was in HER way. Ew. This new hostess seriously needs a lesson in customer service.

The second time I dined here similar experience, but the third most recent time was super disappointing.  After being seated my two friends and I order a pitcher of Sapporo and the house hot sake as well as some appetizers. After getting our drinks we waited for some time for our food, after the pitcher and sake ran out we ordered another round as well as some additional rolls, at this point we were all very hungry.  A few of the rolls came out, some forgotten, no appetizers and really no confirmation from our waitress if we would be getting them.  About 20 minutes later after all drinks and the few rolls were devoured she finally came back and checked on us, we asked about our apps and she said they were coming.  Finally another 15 or so minutes later our 2 orders of salmon sashimi and the flaming sea bass came out (which takes at least 7 minutes to cook, reasoning for why I placed the order FIRST).  Food great but again server no where to be found.  And when the bill came my three friends and I all put down our cards, but of course she could not split the bill three ways, not a big deal but I have to say after such awful service I didn't really think it was fair to all of a sudden start going by some \"restaurant protocol\" bs.

There was a sign on the door saying open at 6 tonight. Oh well. We didn't wait long. They seem very popular. They have a very limited wine selection, sake, green tea. That's it, so we just stuck with the water they give you. I don't know if it was just us, but we received a sample of the butter fish app. It was good. I will say once the doors were open they were nice. We ordered 4 rolls; Giant, white out, flaming sea bass, and red dragon. The giant was the best. The flaming sea bass is interesting. It's brought out wrapped in foil, sitting on a bowl filled with the flammable liquid, and they leave it sitting for 7 min. During that time our bowl just exploded. Scared the bejeezus out of me. All of the rolls were good. It's not the absolute best I've ever had, but it was good. Going back to the flaming sea bass, in the end it was slightly burned to the bottom, and basically tasted like fish with a little rice. It really had no depth of flavor. In fact I thought all of the rolls were kind of one note. It was very trendy and trying to be. They have 4 young sushi geek guys behind the counter, a very young hostess that was wearing a giant ushanka. The music ranged from old reggae to serious rap. It has a very young vibe.

This place however, is doing a pretty good job on their not-so-traditional sushi. However it's sort of hit and miss. Some are really, really good, but some are terrible. 'Happy Together' is a huge miss for us. The huge chunk of sweet and sore mango ruins all the taste of uni (which isn't that fresh in the first place), however the flaming sea bass and the scallop appetizer were delicious\n\nI can't rate this place so high not only because of a couple of 'miss' dish we had, but also the quality of the fish. It's not that fresh compared to other places I've been to, plus the chef need to work on his knife skill.

When Sushi Groove closed we were disappointed to see it go, but were excited to try Elephant Sushi when it opened in it's place.  \n\nFirst the good....the food.  The food is exceptional.  TRY THE FLAMING SEA BASS--you will not be disappointed.  I can't say enough about this roll.  We had a few other rolls that were great as well, but the Flaming Sea Bass was the standout.  Also good, the servers and hostess were extremely friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe Bad....Service is a little slow, but I'm willing to get past that.  The hostess seemed a bit frazzled, but I'm also willing to get past that since the place is still on the new side.  The thing that really bothered me is that when I tried to make reservation for a return trip, I asked to make a reservation for 3 people but was told that the only time available was 6:30pm.  Were they completely booked you ask?  No, they only have one table that they will allow reservations for that will seat 3 or 4 people and there was an 8pm reservation (i was looking for a 9pm reservation and the table wouldn't be open by then).  Now having been there I know how many two person tables are in the restaurant and you're telling me you can't push two of those together for someone who days in advance knows they want to come to your establishment?  That just doesn't make sense to me.  The girl on the phone was really nice, but someone there should rethink their reservation policy and how they work their tables.  \n\nOverall, I will definitely be back because not only is it close to my house but the food is just delicious.

The fish is super fresh; the combinations of fish, vegetables and sauces are amazing and very unique.  The sushi chefs make their own ginger and brew their own soy sauce.  And on top of all that the people who own and run the place are super fun and nice.  I highly recommend checking out Elephant Sushi.  The restaurant is also ascetically pleasing; all the d\u00e9cor was designed by the two sushi chefs, who happen to be brother.  It's a family business, so the front of the restaurant is managed by one of the sushi chef's wife and the staff couldn't be friendlier.  I have been meeting 2 friends once a month for 8 years to have sushi around the Bay Area.  We have crossed many bridges, since each of us lives in a different part of the bay (North Bay, East Bay and SF) and have tried many sushi restaurants, but after last night's meal, I think we'll be come regulars at Elephant Sushi. I recommend if you are coming in after 8, to make a reservation. Please note: Their website does not represent the feel of the restaurant.  It seems to be a work in progress.", "author": "Ellen M."}
