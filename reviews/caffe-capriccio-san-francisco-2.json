While the staff here is nice and they offer a decent selection of breakfast and lunch options, the execution left me unimpressed. \n\nI ordered the egg and cheese bagel which has egg, melty cheese, and roma tomato encapsulated in a plain bagel. Sounds tasty enough--I've had a million bagel sandwiches in my lifetime and expected this one to be decent like the rest.\n\nMy sandwich looked really sad! It was the thinnest bagel sandwich, the egg was super flat and the cheese barely melty. The tomato wasn't roma. I had to ask for Tapatio to douse my sandwich.\n\nThe Cafe Nutella also left me unimpressed. I wish it would have had a more velvetty nutty flavor but it was flat. The iced chai here however is frothy creamy and delicious!\n\nThe breakfast parfait was decent but for that price I could go to Safeway down the street and make my own. I'm all about supporting local small businesses so I'll give them a try again so long as the offerings don't look like something I could whip up myself.", "author": "Connie M."}

There was one slice of lettuce, two tinyyyyy slices of avocado, and a maybe two thin slices of turkey...

Went to this cafe, ordered a bagel which was fine and then decided to take a Caprese salad to go for work.  Luckily I peaked into the box before I left as I was shocked that this was nothing like a caprese salad.  (Oh and its an 'italian cafe no less) . It was a bunch of mixed greens, mini cubes of cheap mozzarella, no tomatoes.  I thought they made a mistake!  when I went to the counter i was told, no that's the salad and the tomatoes were the rinds they obviously cut off for sandwiches etc.   I look at the menu description to make sure I wasn't mad and its says Mozzarella, tomato, basil and balsamic.  when I pointed this out they said 'yeah we don't have all the ingredients\" .  I said then take it off the menu! and wait for it, they threatened to call the police!!!

Cafe Capriccio is a nice little spot on the corner of a not particularly famous North Beach corner.  It is not a destination, and I think that this probably worked in its favor.  The result is a nice little cafe which is not jumping off the hook.  The things here are just fine.  And, they don't force a contrived environment - it's already good enough to be on a nice corner of North Beach, with decent Sandwiches, Coffee, Wraps, Quiche and Breakfast items.  Nice chill spot inside and a few tables outside.\n\nI've had lunch here a number of times - and I like their sandwiches.  It takes a few minutes, but the ingredients are tasty and it comes on grilled bread and with a nice little salad.  Says a Minnesotan:  \"I guess that's what they call a Panini.\"  ... I didn't grow up in North Beach, but I like good Prosciutto, Mozzarella, Basil, Olive Oil, etc. I like a chill place to have a cup of coffee in the morning.  BTW - They also have Iced Coffee, which is reasonably priced and packs a good pre-work punch.  \n\nI'll keep going back when it's convenient.  This place isn't going to become a scene so I feel comfortable recommending if you like the things that I just outlined,  I hope you drop by and enjoy it as much as I have.  I root for all good businesses to succeed, but I hope this place stays low-key.  They do a solid job.", "author": "Adam S."}

I ordered the California Turkey Panini, and when it arrived, it had completely different ingredients than I thought it would. It added in tomatoes that wasn't on the menu, which, if I had an allergy, could be dangerous. The arugula was substituted out for lettuce, which I was not notified of. \n\nWhen I went to ask the man behind the counter why the ingredients were different, he immediately got defensive and said that's the way they've been making sandwiches for the past few years. He acted as if I was the crazy one for not receiving the sandwich I ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-29", "description": "I was on an extensive hunt for the best coffee in SF as well as the best patisserie/boulangerie. Though I don't think I found THE best, I must say their baristas are AMAZING but their food is just ok, ambience is casual and warm. Overall, I would go back if I am in the area, but I didn't fall in love with it. \n\nFirst, we got a mocha and a hot chocolate. Take it from a barista with 10 years experience when I say you can't really mess up a hot chocolate, it was still perfectly balanced between sweet tasting, foam, and delicious cocoa (I think it is a sauce not a powder, fyi). As for the mocha, excellent. The foam was sweet and delicious with just under a half inches worth - perfect. They did some latte art as well, which I have NEVER been able to do - try as I might. The mocha was perfectly balanced with the richness of the espresso. The espresso itself was full bodied but not over powering, not too acidic, and very aromatic. Whatever their blend is, I appreciated. \n\nFood wise, I think the quality of the breakfast sandwiches I got were ok. Nothing to brag about. I was starving and just wanted something so I wouldn't be hangry anymore. I must say, their lunch menu looked more to be desired than breakfast - they also seemed to be lacking in the pastry/bread department but we got their around 10 so it could have been taken by the morning rush. I would be interested to try some of their lunch sandwiches and paninis.\n\nFinally, the location wasn't too bad. It was only two or three blocks away from Hotel Zephr (our hotel, go check out my review!!). So essentially 3-4 blocks away from the piers. \n\nI will definitely go back for coffee, skip it if you want something spectacular for food. I just try to support local businesses over chain places. I will still be on the look out for the best coffee place (the one I looked at was closed for renos). Honestly, the mocha sold me. Consistent?

She made some snide comment about how my coffee was probably cold because she was calling my number for awhile now. Um, you didn't think to go outside?!? It's not like this place is big or anything! The two young ladies that ordered behind me were now sitting at the table next to me, so they witnessed both of my scoldings. All three of us chuckled at how bizarre the barista's crappy attitude was and joked that she must be having a bad day. (On a side note, several yelp reviews mention this barista and her crappy attitude, so I doubt it was an off day) They decided that they didn't want to get yelled at by the barista so one of them went inside to pick up their drinks. \n\nAnyway, the coffee is excellent and the food is pretty good!

The atmosphere and the food have declined so much in quality that even though we live steps from the cafe we never go in, not even for coffee. The last several times we patronized Capriccio it was clear that the turnover of the staff is high. There was never  a manager around. Previous owners were onsite nearly every day. Staff were rude or indifferent. We wonder how they stay in business now. The presence of the San Remo Hotel across the street which does not serve breakfast probably contributes to some of Capriccio's staying power - at least during the early morning hours.", "author": "Scout F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-26", "description": "5 star croissants and other quality eats & drinks!  I can't give the place 5 because the prices run a little high to me - but it's a solid 4 for sure.  \n\nCROISSANTS-\nyou want these - especially first thing in the morning.\nStory round here: the owner wakes up at 4am to make sure these are baked fresh by 7am.  \n\nThis is probably the 2nd best almond croissant I have had in SF, a good contender for those in Marin County. Without exposing my dirty past here, lets just say that I grew up with mad croissant hook-ups in Sausalito, Mill Valley, Larkspur and San Rafael from establishments that cater to European tourists.  I was an overstuffed child with a mother who thought good parenting meant pimping European butter to me like I was one of her clients. And sadly, I've been bribed with food since I can remember - not naming any names, but I kept secrets for a certain baby sitter in exchange for bags of croissants from a touristy spot in Tiburon.  I hit em hard but I also flipped a great deal.  My point is that I have had my share of croissants and this ish right here is - bomB!  Worth blowing up for.\n\nTAKE EM HOME FOR BRUNCH\nMy girl sometimes brings them home when we prep brunch.  Anything within a block under $10 that makes me wanna sing, has the potential to become part of me.  I've been good about these until recently.  Your warning: these aren't sweet, but the toasted almond one can produce bad girl affects.  Butter, fingers, lips, hips, swallow, singing in public - \"pour some [butta] on mey.\"  Not sure you wanna hit this.\n\nSCENE\nWe have been neighbors for almost three years.  This is one of my go-tos to get stuff done because I like that my neighbors pop in and other students hang around to study.  They have wifi, outlets, pillows, and a fair amount of seating.  It can get busy, but I've never had trouble.  The staff is way kicked back even after a spill- I like that.\n\nThe music is always crack'n - a few times I have had to whip out Shazam.  I don't know who puts together their playlists but I would probably buy their mixed CD.  \n\nOTHER FOOD & DRINK TIPS - I'LL BE BRIEF\nDo get: mocha, latte, cappuccino\nDON'T get: regular coffee\nDo get: yogurt Parfait, salads, wraps, caprese sandwich, paninis, bagels w/ bacon egg and cheese, vegan donuts, warm baguette w/ nutella, pie, and pastries.\nBeer includes Big Daddy, Deschutes' Black Butte (love), Hef, Fat tire, Peroni.  Wine changes.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\nDON'T get the prosciutto sandwich if you don't like prosciutto - no matter how bomb it looks.  Really, it's a beautiful mountain of raw pig, everyone else is eating it.  However, if that is not your thing - stick to your guns. Pulling prosciutto out of your panini here will get you dirty looks like you're sacreligious.", "author": "Rayna A."}

It's nestled away on side streets, which means that it is normally quiet and has more of a neighborhood-feel than its competitors on the main street corners. The music is just loud enough to be pleasant, with good variety, but not so loud that it intrudes on your conversation or concentration. There is a lot of small-table seating and a plethora of wall outlets, so it is a great place to work. Also, the drinks are excellent. I'm not a coffee drinker, but it's the best soy chai in the neighborhood (outside of an Indian restaurant). No watering down the drinks here!\n\nThe only thing keeping this cafe from reaching 5-star status is the food. It's fine, it's decent, but its nothing great.

There is no decaf (because decaf is for suckers) but they do carry Mighty Leaf herbal teas. \n\nThey have a variety of croissants, including chocolate and almond. I wish they would get them from a better, local purveyor. They're fine but not exceptional like the ones you might get at Four Barrel or local North Beach bakeries.\n\nThe food is quite good for cafe-style fare. The sandwiches are hearty and the various entree-sized salads are tasty. You can get basic breakfast foods until 11am, such as bagels, egg wraps and parfaits.  They offer quiche with salad all day (or until they run out). The portions are great.\n\nAs of spring 2013 they started a weekend wine-tasting program Thurs-Sun in the evenings. Once they get some better storage for the wine and some higher-end producers, I can really see this taking off. For now it's just an excuse for the locals to grab a glass, sit outside and enjoy the evening. \n\nCapriccio could make little improvements here and there, but on the whole it is a great little neighborhood cafe with nice people, great coffee and tasty food.

The reviews for Cafe Capriccio were good and although it seemed that most people were fans of the drinks, a lot of mention was made about the food there. Since it was close by, my family and I decided to stop there. \n\nThe cafe looked quite cute on the outside, but when I stepped inside, it felt cramped and dark and muggy. (Granted, it was raining, so perhaps \"muggy\" isn't the norm there). Other Yelp reviewers mentioned baked goods in their reviews, but the baked good display case looked rather empty.  Seating was extremely limited - I suppose people were working from there since everyone seemed to have a computer.\n\nI ordered a caprese sandwich, which did seem to be fresh and was loaded with mozzarella - but even with fresh basil and pesto on the sandwich, I found it to be really bland and lacking in flavor. The sandwich was served with a side salad of mixed greens rather than chips, which was a nice touch, although the vinaigrette dressing was nothing to write home about. My meal was okay, I suppose, but it was a disappointment after seeing such great reviews and knowing that there were plenty of other outstanding places to eat nearby. \n\nEveryone else in my family seemed to agree with me - their food was okay, but bland and nothing special.", "author": "Tiffany T."}

As I write, I am sitting in a very comfortable chair in the front corner of Cafe Capriccio. And, of course, this is all made possible by the fact that Cafe Capriccio offers free Wifi (You get two stars for that CC!). \n\nI've just finished the Roast Beef Chedder Melt (as recommended by what seems to be a very helpful and decently nice staff), I hope the staff doesn't worry that I am judging them, even though I am. They're doing a good job. Handling customers swiftly and with a smile, I have been here for about 45 minutes and they haven't even shot me dirty looks despite the fact that I forgot to put pants on today. (Okay, I didn't really forget. I have dubbed this day \"No Pants Friday.\" Feel free to celebrate with me.)\n\nThe crowd is acceptable. No scary people. No crazy people (which is a nice break), There's a baby. But don't worry, the baby is with his parents. It's not like he's just a random baby grabbing a cup of coffee. That would be weird. He has two people taking care of him. Hope they aren't kidnappers. Hmm, better get a closer look. The guy does have a beard, but he seems to be on the up and up.\n\nOk, so back to my lunch. I gotta say, it wasn't far away from great. The roast beef seemed like it came from my mom's oven instead of a deli freezer. The cheddar was quite melty and the panini bread was crisp, but maybe a little crummy for my tastes. But then, I am a super sloppy eater, and I was destined to get flakes of bread all over my hoodie. So I won't fault CC for that.\n\nI'd love to tell you about the coffee, but I had to walk here, and I am a large man, so I was sweating when I got here. Therefore, I went for the iced coffee, which is pretty good, but isn't one iced coffee the same as all the rest? I say yes.\n\nWanna talk decor? I do. Hmm I am looking around right now. There is a very large painting of fish swimming around. I do not know what this means in an arty sense. There are some other paintings that make no sense. But they're nice. Then there is a giant painting of a rhino with zebra stripes. I don't know what this means either, but it is kinda cool. I mean, it's better than hanging up paint-by-numbers or your 5-year old nephew's (probably terrible) drawing of his family. They also have those lights that hang down. I don't know what those are called, but they make me feel like I'm in a trendy place.

I ordered the ham and cheese croissant and a chia because I'd read good things about both. The person I was with ordered an oatmeal and a hot chocolate. We got our drinks quickly, but they were ridiculously hot and my chia tasted like it had a few shots of espresso in it which wasn't what I thought I was ordering. The ham and cheese croissant was burnt and the oatmeal was kind of bland. The service here leaves something to be desired as they people working that morning were inconsistent in the way the food was delivered. They expected patrons to pick up drinks at the counter, but delivered the food to the table. Overall we won't be going back.", "author": "Megan P."}

It's quiet, the workers seem nice, and it wasn't too crowded.\n\nI had a single-shot macchiato and the roasted chicken panini.

It is an adorable little coffee shop that's a bit hidden when compared to all of the coffee shops on Columbus. The seats are comfy, decorated with pillows and magazines are provided to read. This place is a great place to spend a morning sipping on an artsy cappuccino (they put little hearts and pictures in the foam) and eating a granola mixture with milk and fresh cut up strawberries and bananas. Yummmy! They also have sandwiches for lunch but I've never tried them.\n\nFor the food and service, this place definitely gets 5 stars. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there have been a few times when I needed to get food to go because it was completely packed and because it could be a bit more lit.....But then I might spend hours studying there and they may never get rid of me. \n\nThis place is highly recommended.

Because they're stoners, they didn't want to venture too far from their hotel (in case they wanted to get stoned again) for dinner or breakfast (stoners!). This actually worked out in our favor.\n\nCapriccio is a cute little corner cafe with the usual coffee, espresso and pastries...but wait! There's more! Even a stoner can satisfy those munchies at a place like this. They have omelettes and salads and fresh fruit (yes, it comes with whipped cream, you stoner!). If you, like Matthew and I, are not of the stoner persuasion but indeed fancy yourself a bit of a morning boozer, Capriccio has your hungover ass covered with mimosas, too!\n\nI had the fruit, boy had the lox bagel, and stoned and stoneder had the omelettes and something else.

And I hear they're not nice to their employees.  What a shame.\n\n--Original review:\nIt really does take AGES to open a new eatery in North Beach, and now that Lisa and Tarek have navigated the treacherous shoals of the Tel-Hi Dwellers, North Beach Association, and the other myriad agencies, groups, and other interested parties, we can all be glad that they have FINALLY opened their doors.\n\nAnyone who lives in the neighborhood has surely walked by the bright red facade of the former flower shop and wondered: When the hell are these people going to open up?!?\n\nFriday, April 27 was their first official, full day of business.  They opened their doors for a few hours on Thursday to give an unannounced preview to friends and neighbors.  Here are my initial impressions:\n- Lisa and Tarek are both really lovely, friendly, and welcoming people.  As long as they're in the house, I anticipate a great vibe.  They have worked to be a neighborhood-friendly establishment and plan to host neighborhood events and generally turn their place into our second living room.  \n- The menu looks great!  I haven't sampled anything yet, but I'm delighted to see oatmeal as an option for breakfast (anything other than fat-laden pastries, please!), plus a caprese sandwich - a personal favorite.  It's a lengthy menu for a place of its size, so I'm looking forward to trying out the selection.  And the prices looked pretty reasonable.\n- Free Wireless.  There's a pay-to-surf station inside, but if you bring your laptop with wireless card, there's free wireless access from the cafe.\n- Beautiful south-west orientation for sidewalk seating!  The chairs are comfy and they've done a nice job with the flower boxes.  I predict that you will find me here many an afternoon.  Lisa tells me they'll be open 7 AM to 9 PM, so they'll have a great chance to capture late afternoon and evening business that earlier-closing cafes skip.\n- They have Ace apple cider.  Bonus point.\n\nI'll be back to post more once I've had a chance to visit a few more times and try out some of the menu.  For now, it was just a delight to sit at the sidewalk table and drink a free beer and chat with Lisa.", "author": "Jess S."}

I have been going to Cafe Capriccio a few days a week for the past few months and *looked* forward to it everytime.  This cafe had the best food and really felt like a cafe in Europe because of the ambiance and food quality. \n\nMuch to my dismay, I walked in today and was greeted by a new menu and new owners.  The menu had a few of the same items, but overall it was dramatically different. They took a lot of the really great salads (NICOISE) and paninis off the menu and don't appear to have a special of the day which was always tasty.   \n\nTrying to be an optimist, I ordered the Chicken and Bacon salad to go for $8.95.  When I opened it, I was very disappointed to see there was NO BACON.  It was basically iceburg lettuce, tomato and chicken for $8.95. I also bit into a piece of chicken that was crunchy like bone - not a good!\n\nI really hope the owners can make some tweaks and bring back the same food quality of the previous cafe.", "author": "A T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-07", "description": "What WAS a super friendly, cozy, wonderful place to get a cup of coffee and relax on any given morning has become just another crap-hole coffee house.  Since new owners took over, it's just not the same - from the loud, obnoxious music  to the rude staff, our Sunday morning coffee ritual will be changing for sure. Huge mistake in the changes, this place will be going under soon. Thanks but no thanks, Cafe Capriccio!", "author": "Cynthia H."}

The coffee is fantastic, and the barista knows how to make a cappucino that stands up to anything else I've gotten in the city. Sandwich is pretty good, the atmosphere is phenomenal, the wifi is fast, and the folks who work here are very friendly. Highly recommended. Outside seating, too!", "author": "Eric D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-06", "description": "I think this is the best place to get a cappuccino or latte in North Beach. Very consistent, very delicious and perfect foam every time. Not that airy, bubbly foam. It's smooth and creamy the way it should be. Only one thing wrong with the place is the owner - the blonde woman (I think it is a husband/wife team) is nice enough, but she's not very warm. I hardly ever see her smile and sometimes in the morning, you want to be greeted with a smile and recognition from your local coffee shop.", "author": "Lucie F."}

The food I have had there was quite good, and I like the European feel that the place has.  On the other hand, the guy behind the counter is not very nice.  I've seen him yell at employees and that's kind of awkward...I definitely would not want to work there!  As someone who has worked in the service industry I take that into consideration.  Not cool!", "author": "Scarlet P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-12", "description": "i have been here a few times, usually just for the drip coffee which is average..i mean, it's drip coffee. if it's not completely watered down i'm going to like it. i did try the nicoise(sp??) salad here which was good, their salami panini wasn't bad,  but didn't exactly rock my world either, the chicken pesto sandwich with goat cheese is pretty tasty. too much bread though..but i'm not much of a sandwich person anyway, and i like paninis with really pressed or thin bread so i can taste the insides. i do really like the employees. they have consistently been very friendly, and attentive. you can tell that they are making a real effort to give you a good experience, so i give em props.", "author": "Angie B."}

The latte I ordered today was only $2.71 and was outstanding.  So happy with the ownership change and the improvements!  I look forward to seeing them grow and improve even more.", "author": "Robert A."}
