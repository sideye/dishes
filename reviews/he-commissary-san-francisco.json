Everything about it from the decor to the service to the food is amazing!\n\nWe were seated in the \"kitchen\" room where you can watch the chefs prepare everything. Our group was about 10 people and we shared several tapas plates and mains. Prices are on the higher side, but the quality of the food is definitely worth it. The wait staff was taking wonderful care of us, even though we arrived late and stayed even after the kitchen staff had cleaned up for the day.\nOur favorites: oh so many! I loved the meatball appetizer, the crunchy potatos, the jamon spread (or was it chorizo???)... our clear favorite for entree was the pork chops. Getting soooo hungry as I write this!\nNot so great in my opinion was the octopus dish. It was almost not seasoned at all and very soft. I like my octopus with more bite to it. Think al dente. \n\nAnyway, the concept is great, I will definitely be back.", "author": "Alexa W."}

We sat at the kitchen counter in the back (best seats in the house) and were swiftly greeted by a lovely server and Chef Natalia, who guided many of our menu selections over the course of the evening. While the crowd was notably older (mostly 50+) and a bit on the \"loud drunk\" side, we really enjoyed our meal and service, so weren't flapped by it, other than a few knowing glances at one another.\n\nYUM!\n* Chorizo spread, grilled bread, pickled vegetables, fris\u00e9e\n* Cheese fritters, black truffle honey\n* Spanish pork meatballs en salsa, pickled raisins, almonds\n* Quinoa fritters, roasted autumn squash, charred leeks, romesco\n* Strawberry panna cotta, granita, crisp\n\n\nMEH\n* Spanish octopus, avocado, za'atar, confit potato, olive tapenade (the texture of the octopus was a bit squishy)\n\nOverall, a solid experience, all the more so since we live in Marin and dining in the Presidio means we're super close to home vs. getting stuck in the muck on a weekend. We will be back, though Coqueta remains our definite go-to if we're in the city and can snag a seat in their outdoor patio/bar area.\n\nOne final note, we had a 9pm seating and the kitchen closed by 10pm, so we did have to hurry through the end of our meal a bit (we were watching them clean for the latter part of our dining experience; our server comped us a glass of wine as a courtesy). Not a huge deal, but we were literally the last to leave when we departed shortly after -- just something to keep in mind.", "author": "Erin P."}

So I was excited to try the Commissary with my eating buddy.  The concept is Spanish-Californian and it certainly delivers.  \n\nWe were seated in the chef's counter right in front of the executive chef. It's absolutely the best seat in the house.  We ordered padron peppers, shrimp a la plancha, Spanish Octopus, dry-aged bone-in steak and the strawberry panna cotta.  Overall, the food was good.  The padron peppers were a bit overcooked. The shrimp and Spanish Octopus were excellent - highly recommended. The steak was HUGE and very, very tasty. I came here craving meat and mission accomplished.  The strawberry panna cotta was a great way to end the meal. \n\nService was great and the ambiance was excellent.  It's pretty pricey - the above meal including a drink and tax and tip totaled about $110 per person.  I think this is definitely a good restaurant and would recommend it when you are in the area.", "author": "Andrew S."}

Pricy menu but definitely worth it for those dishes that were indeed delicious. \n\nThe Hibachi is a must-order, the Chicken with kale is very good and tender, and the Honey Custard desert is exquisite. \n\nThe Patatas Braves with buttermilk weren't anything special, wouldn't order it again. Tasted like... well, potatoes with buttermilk. So expect just the flavor you imagined :)\n\nThe true disappointment was Branzino. It was very dry and cooked to the point that the spikes would poke your skin if you were to touch it! There was barely any meat we could salvage from it. Plus every piece was accompanied with a lot of bones. \n\nThe real blow, however, came from the mistake made behind the bar that we weren't reimbursed for. The glass of sparkling brute came completely flat, and when my friend kindly asked to replace it, the server did so. However, we didn't get anything that would show that the restaurant was apologizing for it. We were charged for every single sip of that drink. \n\nI've worked in the restaurant business back in my day, and when you mess up, you show your appreciation by giving the customer a free glass or something of the sort.", "author": "Sasha F."}

Well, parks in general.\n\nRecommendations:\n[I forgot to take a picture of the prix fixe menu, so here's me trying my best to recall our private dinner on 10.05.2017]\n+ Roast chicken with little potatoes, a green sauce, and I think arugula; 4/5\n+ Chocolate souffl\u00e9; 5/5\n+ Mixed greens with fruits; 5/5\n\nThe chocolate souffl\u00e9 is an absolute must. Small, not overly sweet or rich, and just perfect. The salad starter was amazing! I can't tell if it's just me and my latest cravings for salads, but I loved the mixed greens with small cuts of...peaches or mango? The fruits and tangy dressing were both refreshing touches. As for the entree, I chose chicken just because it's more of a cooking challenge than steak. The skin was not overly fatty and had a beautiful light crisp crunch to it. Meat was lean but not overly dry. Could it be a little more moist? Sure, but I think they did really well in keeping it light and flavorful without killing it.\n\nBeautiful space, great service, good food.

Mostly average to above average, but maybe it was just high expectation. \n\nThe biggest reason for the low rating was twofold:\n1. The prices. Not worth it for the portions and the slightly above average taste. \n2.  The booze. Why is it that expensive restaurants give some chintzy pours? I ordered a martini and a glass of wine. Both with average ingredients but almost half of what you would expect in an average restaurant (and 1/3 of a Cheescake factory pour). Why is it that the more you pay, the less you get?

The Commissary has been restored beautifully inside, with the original flooring still intact and the incredible towering double hung windows  They just don't make them like that anymore.  Though the day was warm, it's rapidly cooling down this night, and all the windows have been left wide open with the diner at each table deciding to leave open or to close.  I closed mine right away, but ended up having to keep my coat on until the folks next to us left, because they left theirs open.  I would prefer the staff make the decision.  I certainly didn't want to have to negotiate with our neighbors.  So that was not a great beginning.  The waiter was charming, friendly, but not too.\n\nWe decided to start with a couple of their signature cocktails.  The bar was hopping, by the way.  I had an\n INFANTRY ROW\ngin, cucumber, anise hyssop, lime, angostura, and a tarragon sprig.  Great cocktail, dry, refreshing and strong. \nT had a \nTWILIGHT\nrye, amaro, east india solera, cynar, hellfire bitter.  I think I liked his better, except it had a very large (hand carved, according to our server) ice cube.  As the liquid level in the glass went down, it became almost impossible to drink without having your nose in the ice cube!\n\nWe noshed on a shared order of\n Patatas bravas, buttermilk alioli $9 4.5 stars:  So many ways to make this dish.  Here it was small yukon golds which had been baked and then smashed lightly and fried.  Would have liked a little more crunchiness, but the creamy buttery potatoes with the aioli and what I think was a romesco sauce underneath were our favorite of the night.\n\nEntrees were\nBomba rice, mussels and clams, spanish chorizo, gamba $35, 3.5 stars:  OMG  Foamarama!  The entire top of the dish was foam, tasty foam, but way too much, too gimmicky, sauce would have been better.  The seafood was fresh and the rice and chorizo combined to make some great bites.  The one and only giant and beautiful shrimp was whole with head on, making it virtually impossible to eat.  I finally just had to pick it up and damn my manners.\n\nPork chop a la brasa, polenta, jimmy nardello peppers, $32, 3 stars:  Good quality ingredients, straightforward presentation, but as with the other entree, portions are small for the price.  The chop was well cooked, but just didn't wow us.\n\nWe each had a glass of the Tempranillo.  yummy, but at $14/glass, I think high.\n\nSo even with the little negatives, we enjoyed our evening, and I would certainly consider going back, especially with out of towners, because of the setting and the history.\n\nFood: 30/40\nService 18/20\nAtm/Intangibles:  16/20\nValue: 15/20\nOverall: 79/100\nAlmost 4 stars, but I'm not bumping up this time", "author": "Diane B."}

Family was visiting and I thought this would be a great and unique place to take them to on a Saturday evening.  That said, we were disappointed in our meal & service. The dining room is loud & we had to ask our server to nearly yell so we could hear him.  He was not very adept at answering our questions and seemed like maybe he was new and didn't know much about the preparations of the various dishes.  \nI started with the Alegrias Para Ti cocktail, which was completely overpowered by the Mezcal (& I really like mezcal), knocking out all of the delicate flavors of the fruit juice, etc.  The Rioja was served in a high ball glass.  We were told this is how they serve wine in Spain but, in our experience is not accurate. They did however offer a stemmed glass once we asked about it.\nAll of the food descriptions sounded amazing with lots of delicate spices and flavors. Unfortunately most were over salted. The Iberico broth we ended up sending back because it was so salty (& they failed to take it off the bill until we pointed this out).  The octopus was cooked perfectly but again, was over salted.  The Catalan flat bread was tasty but unremarkable.  After reading the description, I was excited to try the meatballs but they were overpowered by garlic and the sauce was heavy.  We ended with the tuna tare tare which was delicious & the most redeeming dish of the evening.  We passed on dessert.\nMy most positive comment is the design of the space is gorgeous and cozy and both the food & drink presentations lovely. Parking is also remarkably easy.\nOverall, it was just not as good as we were expecting with this calibur of chef and these prices.  Sadly, we won't be back.", "author": "Megan M."}

Things got off to a tenuous start; we weren't seated until almost 30 minutes after our reservation since the kitchen and restaurant were setting up for a private party that was going to be going on the same time at dinner. We were seated in the kitchen area, which was cool to watch, but dimly lit and hard to carry on a conversation. We asked our server how we should navigate the menu and she encouraged everyone to get their own larger entre\u00e9 plate and an assortment of the smaller plates.  It seemed like a lot of food, but we went with her suggestion.  Here's what went down:\n\nAppetizers:\n- Bombas de queso with black truffle honey: Easily the best thing we had all night and the only thing I'd come back here for.  The little cheese bombs with truffle honey are bite sized, making eating these at a rapid pace entirely possible.\n\n- Little gem lettuces, manchego, fried croutons, creamy piment\u00f3n\n- Canary Islands pulpo, potatoes, olives, capers\n- Patatas bravas, buttermilk alioli\n- Sourdough pan de aceite, marinated olives, sheeps milk cheese\n- Cheese plate\n- Duck p\u00e2te on toast with marcona almonds\n\nEntre\u00e9s:\n- Steak a la brasa, bacon roasted onions, spring peas, salsa espa\u00f1ola\n- Roasted chicken, medjool date, marcona almond, liver toast\n- Chickpea galeta, sugar snap peas, harissa yogurt\n- Petrale sole, manila clams, chorizo, fennel, saffron\n\nDesserts:\n- Double chocolate-sea salt cookie and olive oil ice cream sandwich\n- Fennel pollen churritos, sheep's milk crema, strawberries, chamomile\n\nTo start, we got way too much food.  The suggestion of everyone getting their own entre\u00e9 was not a good one considering how many appetizer plates we got.  We ordered two steaks and two chickens and we were left with almost two whole plates of food by the time dinner was over.  The appetizers we had were delicious and we loved everything that we had.  The steak entre\u00e9s were good, except that one of the steak dishes we had was better prepared than the other.  Desserts were a must order since we had all heard about the churros, and the olive ice cream sandwich seemed like a good thing too.  That being said, most of us had a hard time enjoying it since we were stuffed to the gills.  In any case, service obviously wasn't the best, but friendly nonetheless.\n\nFinally, while this wasn't the restaurant's fault, my group of friends and I were laughing and having a fabulous time together and was asked to quiet down by another person sitting nearby.  It's unfortunate that this is going to be one of my lasting memories of this place since I love Traci Des Jardin's cooking so much, but I think I'll be visiting her other restaurants instead.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Our last time at The Comissary, the temperature was a serious problem. It was just chilly in there. A nice place like this meant for dates for affluent people shouldn't have that type of cold. But we thought the fried bread was good enough to come back for.\n\nMuch to our dismay, when we came back, we got 2 breads, and both were overcooked. All the rest of the food was fairly off as well. The meat here just isn't well-cooked, how you'd expect a Top Chef-style restaurant to be. Tracy must not be very involved with this place anymore, as the food has fallen off. The most important thing for a restaurant of this caliber is to make sure each dish is stupendous and tasty. This place doesn't have that.\n\nAs a result, this place earned a lower review. It's still A-OK, but it's also expensive. It doesn't justify its cost. And therefore it's really 'Meh...I've experienced better.' We might give it one more try, but not unless we want to be cold and are just in the Presidio.", "author": "Aakash G."}

The service is worth a star. The food, while artfully prepared, interesting, unusual and tasty, warrants only a star because portions are ridiculously small and pricey. Four of us shared: canary islands pulpo (octopus), beet escab\u00e8che, mole @ $22 -- 4 tiny pieces of octopus (2 bites for each of us) and 3 tablespoons of diced beets; tagliatelle, english peas, parmesan  @ $30 -- about 2 cups of cooked pasta and peas; scallops, purple top turnips, passionfruit, squid ink, vadouvan (passion fruit puree) @ $34, 3 scallops and 3 pieces of grilled turnip; and short rib (1) a la brasa, potato, artichoke, bone marrow, leeks @$39. Satisfying, but far from filling. We're happy we had some wine, bread and cheeses at home beforehand. A one-time trip for us, and many diners, I suspect.", "author": "Steve K."}

This former mess hall built in 1895 greets you with its southern-style front porch then warms your heart with its casual California menu filled with items your mom likely made, but just kicked up a notch. For example, you'll find your mom's chicken, but with dates, almonds, and frisee. And that other meat dish you see? It's the bacon wrapped guinea hen breast with brussels, trumpets, and cumin rice. Definitely something I cannot cook at home!\n\nThe Commissary is a great escape from the city by being tucked into the Presidio right off Lombard. This makes it a great place to take folks who don't want to be overwhelmed by the city, especially because parking is quick and easy to find and the menu isn't pretentious. With a full bar, all are welcome in this work-casual restaurant that is also great for dining before special events.

We didn't realize there was going to be a prix fixe 5-course menu of $110/person. Out of the 5 courses, I only really liked 2 dishes: the watercress and potato soup, and the suckling pig tortellini (the latter was amazing!!!!).\n\nEverything else was pretty meh. We got the caviar tasting, which was good except it was atop a tater tot-like thing which was too much tater. It would be better on a blini. The octopus needed more of a char. It was a bit slimey. And the beef with the polenta was super fatty... There was like a feeling of a layer of grease on my tongue every time I took a bite. I just didn't like that the chef put such a fatty meat on top such rich polenta. I actually avoided the polenta, which I typically like, and tried to take a bite of meat with the brocolinni to balance things out. There really was a need for more texture on this plate.\n\nWhat I did love, however, was the service and the wine pairing. The wines were spot on! The guys who served us really knew their thing, so kudos to them! Unfortunately, we decided this is not a do-over. Too pricey for what you get.", "author": "Mariecar M."}

I came here with a party of 5 on a Saturday night. The place was busy, but not exceedingly so. We had a reservation at 8:45pm, but were not seated until after 9pm, which was weird because there appeared to be several open tables in the main dining room. While we waited, we ordered drinks from the bar. We were told to wait in the seating area and the drinks would be delivered to us. We obliged. When we were seated 20 minutes later, we still didn't have our drinks. \n\nWe were seated in a private dining room with four or five tables in it. The menu was impressive and most everything seemed appetizing, which you'd expect, especially with Chef Tracy Des Jardins elite reputation behind it. But here's another strike against them: We were informed immediately they were out of their signature bread, and this is the way it was explained to us. \"We have other bread, but it's not as good. We'll bring that to you. The good bread--the bread people come here for...we're out of that.\" I get it, sometimes these things happen. But they shouldn't happen on a Saturday night. We soon learned there were at least two other menu items they were out of as well. Boo. \n\nThe food we did order was very good...everything except for the mushrooms and onions. That could very well just be my palate though. Overall, the food was solid, but you do pay for it. I don't actually mind the price point, as you won't do much better at similar restaurants in San Francisco. Where you can do better is the service. The table next to us seemed to be having a similar experience, as members of their party took to getting up to refill their own water glasses across the room. \n\nIf service is important to you, this place may have more kinks than you're willing to deal with.

My friend and I sat in the back room on the bar-ish area where we could see all the food being prepared. There was so much going on, so you could see how much effort is being put into your meal. The waiter was incredibly attentive and charming - wish I could remember his name. My friend accidentally spilled water on her food, and they insisted on preparing another dish for her even though she had already made a decent dent in her meal!

I wish we had the option to sit outside, but apparently every table in the place was reserved (by ghosts?).  \n\nThe food here was really good, and it was obvious the chefs have a good amount of skill.  My appetizer was the p\u00e2t\u00e9 de cerdo, pickled onion, whole grain mustard, grilled bread (pictured), and I got the mushroom escabeche montadito with arugula as my main course (also pictured).  I also tried a bit of the pan roasted chicken breast, artichoke, kale, and chorizo vinagreta that was also ordered at the table.  Every dish was nicely plated and had just enough to leave you sated (but probably still have enough room for a dessert).  \n\nA few cons made it fall short of a solid 4*:\n- comparing the two things I got, the value didn't match up - the pate appetizer was $10 and the main was $13, but the main had significantly more food on the plate (I didn't finish it - more on this next)\n- my main (mushoom escabeche montadito - good luck pronouncing that right the first time) had good flavor and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly, but it got monotonous and was a bit rich/heavy halfway through the 2nd half of the open-faced sandwich.  Whatever cream-cheese-like spread they used, I didn't want to keep eating it the whole way through.  \n- the kale in the chicken dish was overcooked and soggy\n- there was also a burger ordered at the table, which was cooked to the wrong side of medium\n\nOverall I enjoyed the food but I probably wouldn't come here again due to the price.  The Presidi-tax strikes again!\n\n(3.5 stars)", "author": "Ben K."}

I know that's a big statement, and I need to return to find out if it is consistently great.

The number in our reservation changed a couple of times and each time we called we were treated with courtesy. \n\nWhen my husband and I arrived we were impressed with the feel and decor. It was both leanly elegant and also respectful of the location's history.  We were a little early and watched our table being set; we noticed the private dining room and asked if that might be available. It was! \n\nOur group made full use of the interesting menu, selecting and sharing 2 tapas, a salad and 2 vegetable sides. The flavors and textures were all delicious. Particularly interesting and flavorful was a mole bone marrow dish - but not everyone in our group was willing to try it. \n\nNext came the mains. Our vegetarian and one meat lover order the chickpea pancake entree. Both enjoyed it. The chicken entree on any menu is a good test of a chef's creativity and this was a home run, served with figs and liver pate on toast. I'm not sure what entrees were further away from me, but everyone reported being happy and impressed with the food. \n\nNext time I go to Commissary I will sit in the room with the kitchen.  This room had a whole different vibe that I will enjoy exploring with a smaller group.", "author": "LH M."}

The space is inviting and the food is excellent.\n\nTL:RL review\n\nThe food was excellent. We did not have a single dish we wouldn't order again. The octopus was cooked perfectly and was tender. The striped bass dish was a keeper even if it did have bacon in it that we were not told about (kind of a bad thing when the French Spouse is pescatarian). The kitchen was working smoothy and every dish was well thought out and delicious. Some could have used some salt but only minor tweaks are needed. The front of house not surprisingly for only 6 days open is still getting it's legs but the hostess and our server were both warm, attentive and helpful. Get here before it's hard to get into.\n\nLong ass review:\nWe got there early for our reservation and were promptly seated. We sat at the large chef's counter where most of the 2 and 3 people groups were seated. The first dining room is mostly large tables for 5-15 people some of which were communal tables, the back dining room is basically the kitchen with a counter wrapped around it on three sides, two of which have a chef's counter. There are also two large high top tables. On two sides are walls of windows. Even with the kitchen the noise level was good. \n\nWe ordered:\n1. Salt cod fritters $9- 3 balls with lots of creamy fish, no fillers, perfectly deep fried served with dipping sauce. \n\n2.roasted artichoke salad $14 which was served with a perfectly poached eggs that made a creamy coating on the nicely charred artichoke. It hit all the right notes and would have been a great lunch item.\n\n3.cured tuna, radish & fennel pollen $13 this was another salad and a tasty one but the portion of cured tuna was tiny and it was really just a radish salad which I make every week at home.\n\n4.octopus, potatoes,olives and pimeton $14 this dish was the one that reminded me the most of the dishes I eat in Spain. There was generous portion of octopus heavily coated in pimeton. \n\n5.striped bass, clams,roasted almond-garlic picada $23, this was my favorite dish, it had the right balance of flavours and the broth was amazing. Bread is not listed on the menu and was not offered but we saw some brioche and got some to sop up the broth. The fish was cooked perfectly with crisp top and tender meat. There was also bacon that added even more flavour but sadly the pescatarian French Spouse wasn't aware was in there. But it was good enough that she kept eating it even when she knew.\n\nWe finished with two desserts even though we were full.\n\n1.Churros and chocolate $9, tiny churros more doughy that I am used to but quite delicious\n\n2. saffron-vanilla ice cream, pine nut turron, chocolate $9, this was a scoop of ice cream served with a piece of pine nut brittle, a few bits of a dehydrated nougat that tasted exactly like a Nestles Crunchie bar with sweet honey crunch and some chocolate sauce. I would have liked more nougat but it was delicious as it was.\n\nWe drank strawberry agua fresca, a latte and a flat priced unlimited sparkling water ($4). There are wines by the glass and by the bottle. Not a huge selection but diverse enough that most people will find something they like.\n\nWe spent about $50 a person. They don't add a tacky \"health care\" charge. I would plan on spending 30-60 per person.\n\nService-The menu is constantly changing and the front of house is still adjusting to the changes. Overall they were quite good and it's professional but friendly service. Traci Des Jardins was at the pass checking all the food. \n\nThe space is understated but charming with solid wood tables and very comfy chairs including at the chef's counter. The lighting is good and besides the two dining rooms there is also a private dining room for 20.\nThe bathrooms are in a common area of the building and are unisex and wheelchair accessible although I didn't see a wheelchair ramp into the building. \n\nParking is super easy at the moment and we parked right in front of the building.\n\nThey are currently no longer taking reservation either by seat-me or open table so get there while you can.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-01", "description": "The Commissary is Traci Des Jardins' take on the mini-trend of Spanish-influenced California cuisine.\n\nLocated in a nicely refurbished Presidio building, the lack of signage makes the new venue a little hard to find, but patrons that successfully complete the treasure hunt are rewarded with a simple, yet casually elegant, dining room. Be prepared to be friendly with your neighbors, however, since most seating is at communal tables with only a few two-tops and four-tops thrown in. The best seat in the house is at the chef's counter where diners can get up close and personal with the chefs as they rapidly sear and saut\u00e9 their way through dishes.\n\nDriven by sustainable ingredients mostly sourced from local providers, the menu changes regularly. On a recent visit, the blistered early season peppers ($9) were delicious and simply seasoned with sea salt. The dry-as-a-bone salt cod fritters ($9) were barely saved by a large application of lemon aioli. The grilled octopus ($14) served with, potatoes, olives, and pimeton was good, but the portion was ridiculously small. Ordered rare, the New York steak with mojo verde (a chimichurri-like sauce) and potato-idiazabal gratin was tender and juicy. \n\nWith a melange of selections from Spain and California, the reasonably priced wine list features a variety of offerings well-suited to pair with des Jardins' dishes. On the other hand, cocktails are rather expensive and ultimately forgettable.\n\nSlow and confused, service is lacking. Service staff seem young and inexperienced: water glasses go un-refilled, drinks arrive slowly, and follow-up was non-existent. Perhaps this will improve as des Jardins focuses on staff training, not just on getting the doors open.\n\nWhile interesting, one expects more from award-winning Traci des Jardins. At least presently, Michael Chiarello and Coqueta need not worry about being dethroned as king of the Spanish-influenced trend in The City.", "author": "CJ G."}

For those of you who don't know, a commissary is the equivalent to a grocery store on a military base. So I already liked this place based on name alone!\n\nLocation: The restaurant is in a great location! We sat outside on the porch which overlooks a huge grassy lawn and the Bay. The Presidio (where this is located) is a great place to escape the craziness of the city. Also, parking is easy which is a huge plus is the city! \n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant layout is open and offers a variety of seating options including square tables (a personal favorite for groups) and counter seating around the entire kitchen in the back room. The whole place had a cool vibe about it and felt effortlessly trendy.\n\nFood: We were there for lunch and I ordered the burger (tapenade on the side) and it was delicious. The meat was the high point and every bite was satisfyingly delightful. The fries were equally divine. Perfectly cooked on the outside creating the golden brown crisp equally over each fry and the inside was just the right softness. The harissa aioli that is served with the fries was not our favorite. We asked for ketchup instead since the seasoning in the aioli took away from the awesomeness of the well made fries. I would have much preferred a simple aioli or an exotic mustard. Perhaps worth revisiting the menu pairing on that one. \n\nService: This is the area that needs the most improvement. The service was adequate, but definitely subpar. They were just kind of there, but didn't offer anything special or make you feel very welcomed. We tried to ask about the history of the restaurant for purposes of the blog, but this was met with shrugged shoulders and weak answers about when the restaurant opened. Every staff member should at least be able to answer that question.\n\nOverall: I would go back for the burger and those fries (although I may bring my own aioli next time!). Love the atmosphere and think it would be a great spot with a big group or for a small office holiday party. Definitely room to improve on service, but overall I would give this a low 4. \n\nExtra Note: Given their name it would be a neat idea if they offered a special discount to military members like the real commissary.

The Commissary,  a new Presidio restaurant by award-winning Chef Traci Des Jardins that features Spanish-influenced California cuisine is just that. Amazing food. Awesome scene. A fabulous team.  All in a charming Presidio location.   And, the Presidio is essentially in my back yard since I live in Pacific Heights.  What's more perfect than a fabulous restaurant close to home!!\n\nThe Commissary - After reading about the hype of The Commissary  I was ecstatic when it finally opened.  I was even more ecstatic to score a reservation for dinner with my Mom and my dear friend Katherine.  The Commissary seemed perfect for the occasion. I made a reservation \"requesting\" the Chef's counter (It's a request since they can't guarantee the Chef's Counter you can just request and hope). Upon arriving and checking in we were told there would be a bit of a wait. I had expected this since the Chef's Counter is always hard to score at restaurants . We all agreed it was worth the wait to be able to witness the creating firsthand.  Luckily, an old friend Malcolm (or a restaurant pal I should say) was taking fabulous care of us so when I realized the General Manager Malcolm was helping make the Chefs Counter happen I knew we were in good hands.  We were seated at the corner spot of the Chef's Counter (Spots #1, 2 & 3 which I later learned are the best seats because of the prime kitchen views and the privacy of the corner seats).   We had a view of the entire Kitchen and the two hot Chefs (as in the Chef's that prepare Hot Dishes); Chef Eric and Chef Preston.  After meeting Eric & Preston I soon realized not only was this going to be a fabulous tasting meal but also very engaging and fun. Both Eric & Preston were working extremely diligently, but also engaging us replying to questions and requests.  You have to give the Chefs props as on open Kitchen complicates their job tremendously. Not only are they expected to create fabulous food, they are also facing distractions from the Dining Room and Guests just a few inches away.\n\nOverall, the food was amazing. Between the three of us we tried a ton. We started with a simple yet deliciously Fresh Green Salad, a Diced Beet Appetizer with Cheese, a Fried Pea & Cheese Ball (unexpectedly one of my favorites), White Beans with Diced Tomatoes, Cauliflower and two Entrees: The Steak & Chicken (loved them both equally and will definitely order again if they're still on the menu next time).  After consulting with the Pasty Chef we chose (or shall I saw the Birthday Girl) chose the Chocolate Fondant for dessert. Also amazing, no surprise....\n\nI'm thrilled to report that what I thought would be a one time visit to a fabulous new hot spot close to home became me falling in love with a new neighborhood gem. A gem with fabulous food, an exciting lively scene, and an awesome team lead by a legendary chef. The only way to top this visit would be to meet Chef Traci on another visit!

The ambience is great. I prefer the Chef's Counter because I have a chance to see the Chef's prepare the meals and I can ask a lot of questions and actually see the dish before ordering it.\n\nI also like the counter because the Chef's are engaged with the people who are sitting there and talking to them eventhough at times it's extremeley busy.

It sounded like they were either watching a sports game or playing a video game.  \nOur waiter was efficient. Our appetizers and entrees in a timely manner but the dessert took a really long time such that even Jr. Yelper was complaining about the wait.  This happened when the restaurant started to fill up (after 7PM) with customers.\nOur choices:\nThe cod fritters were OK, $12.  It was slightly salty but when you bit into these balls of flaky fish, you could tell it was fishy tasting.  I wouldn't order again.\nThe fairly large size of empanada, $7, was pretty good.  Hubby said there were raisins in it, I could not tell from the bite I had.  \nEntrees:\n1. Trout - I loved this dish.  2 fillets of tender, orange fish with a nice crunch to the pan-seared skin.  Didn't like the vegts. served with it. A bit too tart. $32.\n2. There were 2 orders of the roasted chicken - pieces of tender, moist chicken.  I only had one bite but it was delicious.  Jr. Yelper said portions were too small.$27 each.\n3. New York steak, $35.  2 chunks of med rare steaks which looked a bit more rear than med rare.  The meat was also tender.\nHubby and I had sangrias. Red for him, White for me. I really liked the White Sangria, but would've liked a bit more fruity flavor to it, $8 each.\n\nDessert :  We were all full but decided to share an order of lemon ricotta.\nThe lemon ricottas, 4 small donut holes coated with sugar. I couldn't taste the lemon flavor but the dessert was good. And they gave you 4 tiny pieces of jelly pieces. \nWhat I like about this restaurant is the atmosphere, ability to find parking and the quietness of being in a federal park.

They forgot my special menu at first but brought it to me after we already ordered.\nSpeaking of menu, study up your French, kids, because it's only half in English. Had to use google translate to know what I was ordering. I guess that's not that big of a deal but our waiter never offered to explain it until he saw us using our phones.\nWe got the deep fried cheeseballs and they were amazeballs, and the lamb meatballs, which were tasty but a bit cold.\nThen we waited and waited and waited for our mains. Definitely over 30 minutes. We understand kitchens get backed up but our waiter never bothered to check in with us. He breezed by at one point to say \"2 more minutes\" but that turned into about 15.\nMy husband got the steak which was delicious. I got a bland very overcooked piece of bass. I asked my waiter for salt. He never brought it. Had to ask another waitress, who brought it 5 minutes later. I basically had to wait 10 more minutes to get my salt to eat my entre.\nThey brought me a little strawberry sorbet with a candle which was lovely. And we got the chocolate cookie sandwich with olive oil ice cream.

The food was solidly good, but not outstanding - definitely at least 3 stars but the service was incredibly inattentive and our overall experience wasn't a positive one.\n\nI was happy that we were seated a private table for 2 as I was really surprised to see on here that even if you have a reservation you are sometimes seated at the communal table (wtf???). It took our server a really long time to come over and get our drink order and then another long stretch to actually get our drinks. When she finally brought the drinks, she didn't ask if we were ready to order or if we had any questions about the menu - she was about to leave again and I had to basically stop her from walking away so we could get our order in. I'm glad I did because our food also took forever to come.\n\nLong story short, she totally forgot our bread order (we had to ask for it halfway through the dinner) and the food came out very very slooowly. She also never once asked if we wanted more drinks (we had both finished ours before the meal was over) and even the dessert which was not something that had to be cooked took forever to come out of the kitchen.\n\nThe food itself was good, but not great. For a Traci des Jardins restaurant I expected more in terms of service, quality of what you get for your money, etc. It's worth mentioning that the weekend evening that we went the crowd was skewed heavily toward the older side (50s-60s and up). There were several tables taking very bright flash photography repeatedly (it looked like it was someone's birthday) as well as a table of older folks who were using super bright flashlights to see the menu and kept accidentally shining them in our faces (it wasn't that dark in the restaurant). For being a tapas restaurant I also expected it to be romantic, candlelit and cozy or fun (upbeat music, etc) and it was very quiet.\n\nIt was not the fine dining experience I had in mind.

Not my favorite given how delicious everything else was, but I was also stuffed. The portions are also very generous, so make sure you come hungry and don't eat the bread they give you if you want any chance at finishing your meal. \n\nOur servers were great and super friendly, you can tell that they actually care about your experience (which is something that most restaurants lack nowadays), so the servers are a precious commodity. \n\nWe were seated in the back where we could walk the kitchen staff cook the meals and see the chef yell at the line cooks.

We went there as a big group for a birthday dinner, with a big cake. The dining room is beautifully done, busy yet still elegant.\n\nFirst we asked for wine recommendations, our waitress admitted that she's no expert but she'll send the sommelier over, which is a totally fine thing to do and say. We ordered a bunch of starters, appetizers, and entrees. The sommelier wasn't there yet when our entrees came, so boyfriend asked another server for the sommelier again since our waitress was no where to be found. The sommelier first recommended a $300 bottle wine (??), huh??, we were obviously planning to order more than 1 bottle, but that put off our desire to order more. We landed on a great wine at around $100, which is a good price but we did not order any more wines.\n\nAfter the dinner is served, we were waiting for our cake to arrive for a long long time, our waitress was drifting around as if we are none of her business at all. We were enjoying each others' company so it was OK. The cake came, we sang, they took it back to slice them. The cake was amazing but super rich, some of us wanted water, some wanted coffee or tea, yet the waitress was still no where to be found. This whole time, nothing was offered, no water, no coffee or tea. The waitress was still wandering around \"avoiding\" any eye contacts. The conversation at the table started to circle around the lack of service. \n\nFinally, boyfriend got up to talk to the chef, simply said the food was excellent, but the service was the worst we've ever had anywhere. The waitress came to apologize with her eyes red, nothing could really help her at this point. The check came, it was only $195 with all the drinks we had (pitcher of sangria, cocktails, and a bottle of wine), and pretty much everything on the menu, some double orders.

I've been there both for sit down meals, and for grab n go lunches.\n\nSit down Meal - had the chicken - it was good, and tasty, but not as good as my mother's chicken, and for that price, I want it to be.  \n\nGrab N Go.  I've gone here more than I'd like to admit when I just need to quickly grab something to eat and can't risk going half a block away.  But it is NOT my first choice.\n\nSandwiches here used to be expensive, then they lowered the price and they got really good, and now they've increased the price a bit again, but have by far decreased the amount of whatever is inside.  It's like a bread sandwich.  Plus their Serrano ham, which should be delicious, last time came full of gristle and way way way too much fat (I know that some comes with it, but no need to put a whole slab), and they put pickles in there... it made me actually gag into a trash can.  Not cute.\n \nLittle Gem Salad - area you freaking kidding me?! This is an extortion!  I feel like i have been hustled.  $14.50 for a salad that has $2 worth of ingredients - an egg, some cheese, fried bread and run of the mill lettuce.

Dined here at lunch and our bill was about $91 not including tip for 4 ppl. What did we feast on, you might be wondering? Our \"feast\" consisted of 1 soup, 1 salad, 1 side of fries, 2 burgers, 1 chicken \"basquaise,\" and 2 beers (bottled Anchor and Trumer). \n\nThe burgers and soup were relatively substantial portion-wise but the chicken was more like an appetizer despite being priced at the high end of the lunch menu ($14). The dish came with two measly lightly fried drumsticks sitting in a thin layer of tomato-y liquid. The drumsticks must have been taken from a chicken on a diet and tasted just okay. The accompanying potatoes were both soggy and hard at the same time....an accomplishment I wish I never had to come across. I was hoping for a hearty stew, but this dish would not have filled up a small child....who had just eaten.\n\nThe squash was just a single layer of squash rounds covered in greens on a salad plate. The fries were oversalted. Didn't try the burger....it comes medium rare unless otherwise instructed.\n\nThe service was excellent and the space is gorgeous.

The food in general is interesting and well made.  Some interesting combinations like pork and clams that worked well.  \n\nSome of the portions are rather small, however, like the cheese plate which consisted of 5 small bits of cheese and 5 small bits of bread.

I went in today for lunch shortly after they opened at 11:30 and while the location and service are great, the food is really lackluster.\n\nPROS: Great location in the Presidio, gorgeous interior decor, lots of alcoves and bar space to have an intimate meal or meeting in a big space.  Great service from the staff, very welcoming and informed about the menu. \n\nCONS: The food. Almost everything was mediocre to bad tasting, but came out looking very nice.\n - Burger: was okay but overpriced considering it doesn't come with anything alongside it but a handful of arugula. The bun on the burger was the best part, but the patty itself was pretty thin.\n - Fries: not outstanding, really expensive ($8) for a dish of plain fries with some seasoned mayo; frozen or prepared fries, not made in-house. \n - Trinxat: was from-the-fridge cold inside, and just two scoops of mashed potatoes with cabbage, scallion, and salt, also served with a handful of arugula. These are clearly scooped up from a prepared batch and seared as patties before serving, and they lacked any flavor and the sear was more just color than a crisp sear. I've had this dish other places and it typically has ham or bacon in it, with a crusty top or bottom to create texture and depth of flavor -- The Commissary did none of that. \n\nTL;DR -- dinner is probably their stronger suit here; the menu is much larger and hopefully better prepared. Lunch was overpriced for mediocre quality food. Service and location are great, but in a city with GREAT food everywhere (especially in The Marina/Pacific Heights) this place isn't gonna make it if they don't put out better food. I'd also say they should consider offering some olives or spanish almonds, etc on the table to much on before your food arrives.", "author": "Laura J."}

You get a good 10 to 12 slices with olive oil and salt. It felt like a small tapas dish.  It was well worth it in my mind. \n- Jamon wrapped trout: Delicious!!

I love meals where I can taste the chef's artistic experimentation, where the dishes are presented like works of art. I love crafting the perfect bite from those meals, knowing a lot of thought went into designing the right complimentary flavors. Like the gorgeous halibut: perfectly cooked and with a crisped skin, a subtle flavor with some flake and some crisp that was complimented by the crunch of beans, some acidity & sweetness from slow-roasted cherry tomatos, and moistened by a decadent, rich, savory broth. Washed down with their Albarino (their wine list has some great Spanish finds), every bite was bliss. My dinner companions had the chicken (which was roasted so perfectly that every bite, even of breast, was juicy, and with just a hint of dates and almonds), and the steak (an ideal medium-rare). The nectarine-plum sorbet was like Summer in a Glass Bowl, and the ice cream sandwich was very good, though the cookie was a bit too hard for one's fork to dig easily into.\nThe reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is for price--for the portions, the prices are pretty steep. Everyone's entree was appetizer-sized, and yet the cheapest was $27. The expensive appetizers are minuscule, and the sorbet is two, tablespoon-sized scoops. You even have to pay $5 for bread. I get that they're in an expensive space and that their food is art, but I think at this early point--before they've really established their reputation--they need to be careful of pricing out some of the very customers they wish to target. Don't forget, Commissary, that most San Franciscans right now are emptying their wallets on rent--when we have two pennies to rub together we'd rather a full belly and some free bread.", "author": "Ali M."}

Largely because it's opening week and giving them the benefit of the doubt I moved up.\n\nI have to start by saying first, I'm a little biased because I have eaten Spanish food pretty regularly. Additionally, I have a older child who lived in Spain and pointed things out that probably didn't look obvious. Secondly, this review is based off of The Commissary only being open about a week. First and foremost, the restaurant is very open and feels very comfortable. I like the soft leather seats, matching wooden tables following the theme of a old style army mess hall. We had 6 o'clock reservations. Arrived 15 minutes early, but were seated promptly.The host said it was okay as there were seats available. I noticed that the main dinning area was half full. Later, we noticed that the majority of the diners were sitting at the Kitchen table. Later it started filling up. Waiter arrived shortly with food and drink menus. He was very pleasant and informative.We went ahead with drink orders. We ordered  a glass of Finca Sandaval, a glass of Dos Tiempos,  a cocktail, a 24TH & YORK and Sangria. For my taste the Sandaval was the best of the two wines. The cocktail was a tequila blanco, orange, lime, agave, cayenne salt drink. According to my fellow guest, it was just okay. As for the Sangria, unfortunately, it was not ready and had to wait 15 minutes. In the end, didn't have much of an infused fruit flavor that Sangria is known for. I recommend they probably should make sure a batch is ready to go at all times.\nSince, we all wanted to try as much of the menu, we ordered family style and shared all the food Items. We had the crispy spring potatoes, romesco sauce, albondigas, little gems, manchego, quince vinaigrette, almonds salad and a artichoke salad (not listed on online menu). They ended up sending us the anchovies, vinegar and salt cured also on the house (nice touch). I think the toasted sour dough make it. Came here to try the paella. Saddly, they took it off the menu because it wasn't quite what they wanted to serve. We were out of luck on that one. So, the  entrees were new york steak, mojo verde, salt roasted potatoes, striped bass, clams, toasted almond-garlic picada and lamb sausage. Total of three entrees. For dessert, the churros with chocolate. Now my review. Pretty mixed. I think the Potatos in romesca needs more. Additionally, I've seen these in wedges rather than cubes. The albondigas were a little dry for my taste. Just Okay. Both the Salads were good. The Little Gems can probably add more vinaigrette. All the main course entree's were very good. We devoured all of the down. Only nit picky thing would be presentation. Bass needs to be in a bigger plate. Need to see ingredients. The Steak with potatoes was presented off to one side and not at center of plate. As for the Lamb Sausage, we think it needs more greens.\nFrom there it went a little south. We sat around for close to a half our....I think GM noticed it was taking to long so he apologizing sent a glass of pedro ximenez, rum. Waiter finally came over and took our Dessert order. It was almost a disaster. Churros and Chocolate, sent back twice because too doughy at center. Churros are not Doughy!  On third time, GM sent over Saffron Vanilla Ice cream which was very good to replace it. Overall, good food experience. Need to add more Spanish Options (ie. Olives, Chesses, tapas), Now the downside. Hopefully this gets fixed. Details, details, Details...Need more Wait Staff. We counted maybe two people taking orders for main area. Still looked like they were learning everything. One person bringing out food.

These were spectacular, but the others were nutty good too.  Ex:\n- asparagas salad - had an amazingly complex creamy avocado smear, I don't know what's in it but you just wanted to savor it.  The dressing was a smoky vinagrette, surprising yet fresh.\n- Salt Cod Fritters - salty, crunchy, and surprisingly light with a lighter bready texture - unlike a heavy fritter. Perfectly paired with a lemon Aoli.\n- Cuttlefish - super tender but served with arroz verde made from aborio rice with (I think) parsley, cilantro, mint - such a warm and well rounded softness to the flavor, a perfect compliment.\n\nWe had the jamon wrapped trout (super), the pork loin (amazing spanish spices and an incredible farro base) and the roast chicken- This is not your normal roast chicken, the preparation is outstanding- seems to be some sort of a sherry based brine or glaze..super tender, moist and succulant.\n\nI can go on forever, but if you have to try it yourself.

The location is wonderful but other than that, it was a big disappointment from appetizer to dessert. For the appetizer, we fried the fritters and the stone fruit with Serrano ham. Nothing to brat about. Tried the NY steak, halibut and chicken for entree. The chicken is the best but even that is not impressive enough to make up for the steak. It was cooked right at medium rare but the meat has no taste. Halibut was ok. Dessert was basically a piece of cinnamon bread with berries. Definitely not worth the money.", "author": "Mimi L."}

This is the worst cost-to-pleasure ratio restaurant experience I can remember having over the past few years.

Took almost 10 minutes for someone to come to the table after our party of 4 was seated.  Then took almost another 10 minutes for our server to inform us that they were out of the wine we ordered.  Appetizers came out in a timely manner, then 30-40 min. for our entrees to follow after the appetizer dishes were cleared.  Then compounded by our side dish arriving 3/4 of the way into the meal. Desserts were similarly delayed.  All in all, a three+ hour meal (not by our choice).  We watched tables on either side of us arrive later and leave before us.   Our server never apologized or informed us for the reason behind the delay until I asked him later in the meal and he told us  that the kitchen was not able to handle the prime-time reservation period (7-7:30) when 12 tables were full (then why accept all reservations int the first place, why not stagger better?).   \n\nNow to the food- appetizers were excellent (lamb meatballs, sourdough bread, cheese balls) - entrees were ok (chicken, steak and sole).  No wow factor. \n\nOne very positive note: The bartender was outstanding-  Excellent mixologist!   Would definitely come here for a drink (only)  in the future.\n\nConsidering the \"pedigree\" of this restaurant, I was expecting much better.

Unfortunately, he used pretty much every cooking utensil at his disposal to taste with, which he returned to his utensil holder without washing. He even used a small spatula to spread some tapenade on toast that he previously used to taste a dish with by placing the entire spatula in his mouth. Not sure if this is industry standard, but I personally liken it to spitting in a dish. I have no problem with a chef tasting my dish, but please use a new spoon each time!! I don't want your hep-a, b or c please.\n\nAlso, plates were dirty, and service was slow, but this is most probably due to management understaffing the place.\n\nFood overall was good, but not great.

Have you heard of salt and pepper? The basics would be fine. We don't expect a lot of seasoning but a little something would be nice. \n\n* octopus - this was better than the soup. Better seasoning. \n\n* bread basket - my husband asked several times for the server for bread and asked for it to be brought out with the appetizers. It came at the end. \n\n* roasted chicken - this was my  husband's dish. He was highly disappointed. Again, bland. I could make a better roasted chicken with just a little but of herbs and salt and pepper. Not hard to just use some basic items to add flavor. \n\n* jamon wrapped trout - this was ok. It had some seasoning but the flavor mix was lost with all the mushrooms on the plate. I love mushrooms but when they are all over your plate and making it drown the fish, i lose sight of what i ordered and flavor.

It's fun to have a location in an historic building in the Presidio, the design is lovely, and we enjoyed eating at the bar sitting around the kitchen. The cooks were amiable and gave us recommendations.\n\nThe food didn't live up to my expectations, however, particularly given Traci des Jardin's involvement. What did she do, walk through the kitchen once? There wasn't anything wrong with it, but it was like food by committee, not the expression of a chef's vision or passion. Everything was just a little off, like the chef just couldn't be bothered. \nThe gazpacho was good, but just a tad acidic even for people who love acid.\nThe \"little gem\" salad was romaine, and boring.\nThe much-haralded octopus was fine, but fine the way any Spanish tapas bar anywhere makes it.\nMy pork was overcooked.\nThe NY steak was not medium rare, as it was supposed to be, but barely pink.\nThe brussels sprouts were good; much better at SPQR.\nThe chocolate dessert was your basic molten chocolate dessert; good, no big deal.\nThe ricotta cheesecake with fig was good, but sprinkled with granola, which was like, um, pass the milk.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the wine glasses, which were like short little ramekins, and surely an indication of how no chef is presiding here. Why in the world would you serve good wine in a squat little glass where all the bouquet escapes? Half of the experience of the wine is the aroma, which is why--duh--people have been serving wine in rounded glasses since the Greeks. You want to capture the aroma. Big wine, bigger glass. I asked for a real wine glass because I refused to throw money away on an expensive bottle of wine and a little ramekin. You might as well drink it out of styrofoam.\n\nSo: Someone is not paying attention to actual TASTE here. We're a town of foodies. You can't put this over on us. Up your game or go home.

Other gems included the chicken with dates, salt cod fritters and all of our drinks. Couple the great stuff that is going on in the kitchen with an awesome location and space. Only thing that wasn't solid was the service. Our hostess was rude and wait staff had to ask our drink and appetizer order a few times. We'll definitely be back.", "author": "Steven W."}

We were able to park right in front with plenty of free spots available after 6pm. \n\nWe got a seat at the bar with a direct view of the mixology, but then we realized there's a chef's table in the back with a direct view into the actual kitchen.\n\nDrinks: \n- Sand and fog: I like that you can smell the fragrant eucalyptus and the lime leaf they top\n- Wet mutt: I like grapefruit bitters, sea salt, and gin, so this was a good drink got me, but the grapefruit was subtle \n- 24th and York: mezcal, agave, cayenne salt. This needed more cayenne and something to give it a little more depth - maybe some citrus juice like grapefruit?\n- A kiss and a promise: rye, lime, egg white. This was simple and light, a good drink to start with\n\nWe started with house bread which was served with a very green olive oil and sea salt. \n\nFood:\n- Salt cod fritters: smooth potato and salted cod, fried nicely, and the grilled lemon squeezed over the top really made this dish \n- Roasted padron peppers: standard, but beware of the larger ones because the seeds inside are still really spicy!\n- Ham and pea croqueta: probably my favorite dish. I was in the mood for fried food tonight. Initially it was just ok - you could taste the freshness of the peas inside, but then I realized adding some sea salt to it really brought out a ton more flavor (not just saltiness) and made the dish much better \n- Roasted cuttlefish: I liked the arroz verde and the squid ink, but I expected the cuttlefish to be more charred - it was essentially all white still, and I was looking for a more roasted flavor and appearance \n- Mackerel: with a cucumber, fennel, chickpea salad.  The salad made it taste healthy, but the mackerel didn't stand out \n- Corn: server on a cob, roasted, covered with cheese and quico (like corn nuts). The butter was a little overpowering for me and actually masked the corn's sweetness \n\nDessert: \n- I really liked my soy cafe au lait\n- Almond cake with tomato and plum caramel and almond milk ice cream: the olive oil almond cake was surprisingly light. The tomato part was interesting, but I didn't really like it; the plum was really good, though \n\nI know they just opened a few weeks ago, but I was expecting service to run a little more smoothly at the bar. We weren't offered house sparkling water, we had to keep asking for water, and they kept trying to take our menus away when we wanted more drinks.  Also, the food didn't blow me away.

There was clearly a lot of thought given to the noise level which is really good thanks to lots of hidden acoustic panels.  The light fixtures are from the Presidio gym and they used lots of reclaimed wood to make the tables. There's also a small commissary that sells some of the olive oils, vinegars and other products used in the menu.\n\nThe next room contains a huge open kitchen with seats at the bar on two sides.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-20", "description": "The newest place for delicious food in the Presidio is open, and while there is some dust to brush off, I encourage you to visit sooner rather than later, because this is a good time. They are blossoming and it's something to behold.\n\nThanks to the Army there is this amazing place right within the city where you can throw a frisbee & not hit anything at all. Why isn't this the most popular part of our peninsula? While there is ample & cheap parking with beautiful views there's essentially no walk-in traffic & no public transit access, so your crowd is mostly car owners who have a place to park the car again when they get home (because no one wants to an end evening with a 30 minute parking hunt) or folks who use Uber. That's limiting. Personally, I'd rather drive here than downtown...\n\nI know a lot of work goes into creating an atmosphere, but sometimes I think those in the know can forget that they are designing for outsiders. Crissy Field was formed into the shape it is not to resemble a paisley, but to evoke both the air strip & the race track it once was, but is there any information on site letting the casual observer know this? I thought about that during dinner. While the name, the decor, & the staff outfits all evoked a military base that you might see in a movie, with dapper officers & women in crisp uniforms, the menu seemed to not match.\n\nTake the pork albondigas. I don't know why one restaurant would call them pork albondigas & another pork meatballs & yet another would call them pork albondigas but follow it with a dash or parentheses & explain that they are pork meatballs in a delicate sauce that simply bursts with flavor. They were fantastic but I had to ask what they were when I was reading the menu, as did the couple next to us. I didn't grow up eating out a lot, but I've lived in four countries & hadn't seen the term before. I'm not shy, I'll ask, but I still feel for those who might be too shy to ask. What does mystery add to a menu? Maybe some day I'll find out. Certainly a menu that is too wordy is no good either. This menu was a good list. Not too long, not too short, easy to find something for your paleo meat-eating friend & probably for your vegan friend as well, but I while I saw great vegetarian options I didn't look for vegan menu items as I try not to eat out with vegans, & so really didn't care.\n\nBack to the part of the menu I do care about: meat! The charcuterie was curiously named as well, in that it had no name, just a list of what was on the board. I know I can order a dish by the main ingredient, if there are not similar dishes on the menu, & I'll often shorten a wordy menu entry, but honestly didn't know how to describe the \"fermin iberico sausage, aged manchego, cana de cabra, joyce's homemade membrillo\" as anything other than a charcuterie, so it was odd that it wasn't named. (Is it a faux pas to have a Spanish inspired menu with French words? Ce lest vie.) Meat & cheese plate, please. I guess I do prefer simple names. The Presidio of San Francisco has strong Spanish roots & I can see that reflected in the menu, but I guess the Spanish names without explanations felt like a barrier to me. Maybe it was meant to feel like a US military base in another country. I can dig that; I know I need to learn more Spanish.\n\nThe bar featured some of my favorites, including 209 & Old Potrero. The cocktails were really tasty, & met in a good place between not boring but not containing 18 ingredients either. The food was just right. The service has a few places where the dust will settle off... everyone was friendly without being too eager, but there's just some ways where you can tell it'll get better with time. We found a seat right away on a Saturday, which was lucky for us & too bad for them & I hope they'll both fill up soon & that they'll stay open later. Is this the sleepy corner of San Francisco? Maybe for now but hopefully not for long.\n\nThe space is acoustically bright which worked to fill the room with sound when it was light on guests. I never had trouble hearing the staff or my companion. If there was music I don't remember it, which is good in my book. There are items for sale, as befits an actual commissary, but it was unclear when I'd want to wander over to go look closer. (And these days, I need a lot of closer or a lot of lighting to see the details.)\n\nMy partner & I split a few appetizers & several drinks, & I'd like to return for a full meal. The lamb shoulder is still calling to me. Post-meal coffee was Equator, which I hadn't had before (there, I've just outed myself as Not A Hipster) & I enjoyed it tremendously. Really, the whole evening was delightful, & I'd like to go back with more people, more time & more appetite. \n\nFinally, in an attempt to offend even the last reader who made their way to this end, I would encourage The Commissary to take advantage of being on Federal land & thumb their noses at California's foie gras ban. I'll be there weekly when you do.", "author": "noemi r."}

The location is in a restored red brick Presidio building at the Main Post, an historic location dating back to the earliest city beginnings in 1776. The front windows look out onto the Main Parade Ground.  Parking is readily available.\n\nThe interior is spacious, with high ceilings, and with a flexible arrangement of tables, from 2-person tables, to community tables to bar seating. There is generous space between the table allowing a lot of privacy.\n\nWe arrived on-time for a 5:30 reservation, having just visited the Walt Disney Family Museum a few buildings down the hill, and were seated promptly without any waiting.  Service during the meal was attentive and friendly. Between courses the table was discretely cleaned and utensils set.\n\nWe shared 3 small plates: salt cod fritters, albondigas and  the octopus, potatoes, olives, and pimeton.  The octopus and potatoes were a tasty combination. We also shared a striped bass with clams entree. The broth was well flavored. We ordered bread late in the meal to use with the tasty broth. Recommend asking for bread earlier in the meal.  Had the JL Bonnacorsi and Bengoetxe wines by the glass. Food presentation was excellent.", "author": "David E."}

I'm generally not a big fan of Spanish cuisine/tapas, but I really enjoyed the food.  Our favorite thing was the heavenly gazpacho - liked it so much we ordered two to go!  The other items we had were also very good, including the two deserts.  Everything was tasty, fresh, well portioned and priced. \nContrary to some other reviewers, we experienced great service, starting with the hearty welcome from Malcolm when we arrived, which set the stage for the evening.  We were happily seated in the far corner at the kitchen counter (a wonderfully entertaining seating option).  Because we were a bit out of the way, we had to wave someone down a couple of times when we needed something \"off cycle\", but it was no big deal.  Our server and his \"assistants\" did a great job of getting things to us quickly.  They seemed a touch understaffed (especially by the time we left around 7:30pm), but were working efficiently and were very knowledgeable and friendly.     \nAs many have said, this is not a good option for a quiet and/or formal date.  It's a boisterous, open, casual atmosphere with largely communal tables and counters.  I don't think there's anything wrong with it - just something to know before you go.   \nMy only critiques are towards the drinks.  The cocktails are very small for the price, and I don't like the glassware for the wine.  Call me old fashioned but I don't want to drink wine out of something that seems like a finger bowl :)\nWe will definitely be back!", "author": "Ellen H."}

Last Saturday we celebrated our son's 30th birthday dinner party there.   I was a little nervous because I wanted everything to go right. To my delight, it was expertly managed with great service from their warm and courteous service staff.   From the moment we were served drinks and appetizers outside on the veranda to the special serving of the \"out of this world\" abalone sashimi prepared to absolute perfection (special permission was granted for the chef to prepare and serve the abalone that was previously caught by our son) by the chefs at The Commissary to the beautifully prepared entrees and sides that showed great care appealing to our eyes and other senses, we knew this was something very special.  Our family and guests were totally enraptured and impressed from start to finish.  We had brought our own dessert, a round 12 inch St.Honore cake, that the staff showed great care first to place the birthday candles then waiting for the singing the birthday song and blowing out the candles to finish to take the cake back to cut and serve each pieces of cake with its own puff pastry filled with custard!  Totally amazing experience with their delicious meat entrees with Spanish influence to their excellent service!!   I especially loved the strip steak cooked to medium rare perfection!  Kudos to the chef and staff of The Commissary!

We started with the salt cod fritters, if you love fried and you love salt, you will love these. Lucky for me, I do, so I was good to go. We also got the crispy new potatoes, super yummy sauce in case you were wondering, and the cauliflower soup which was good but if you're debating between that and something else, go with that other thing. After that, we were pretty much full but zero chance of not ordering more food so we fought over the chicken or the trout for a while, worked our appetites back up and went with the trout. Sidebar, I rarely order chicken at restaurants I'm excited about, but duuuuude it looked so good coming out of the kitchen. my pain in the ass friend was not on board, however.

There seemed to be plenty of staff, but not much happening.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is a bit lacking- cool wood tables and light fixtures, but bare white wall and very loud- just kind of blah.\n\nOur group of four was seated at a table designed for 6 or 8. We arranged ourselves on two sides so we didn't have to yell across the table, which was still awkward. Then the service was SLOW. And disorganized. We ordered a few tapas style starters, which did not come, and did not come...... We then decided to order our dinner to try to get a jump on it since the kitchen seemed to be working at a glacial pace. Then a runner arrived with what we hoped were our starters, but it was two side dishes that we had not ordered. An inquiry was sent back to the kitchen about the status of our starters. Two of three eventually arrived - salt cod fritters that were very good and a mediocre croquetta. Laster, we finally got the potatoes brava, which were delicious and the best thing we ate all night. Given the inordinate time for the order- they comped the potatoes.  The potatoes were so good that we ordered a second order which, unfortunately, when they arrived were so salty that they were inedible.\n\nAt one point in the evening a chef came out and wandered around the restaurant with a confused look on his face. We thought he might stop to chat with a table or two, but he just wandered and then disappeared again. \n\nAll drink refills took ages. They eventually comped us two glasses of wine due to the slow and confused service. We ordered the chicken as an entree per the recommendation of our waiter (who was so attractive that he was the highlight of the dining experience), only to be told minutes later that they were sold out. We ordered the steak which was supposed to be a New York strip - but it was not a strip steak and was so tough and flavorless that it was barely edible, and accompanied by some unseasoned broccolini and undercooked potatoes.

We both ordered \"medium\" burgers and they both came well done. We would have said something, but the patties were so thin (they had to have been the frozen kind) I don't know how you would have cooked them. Even forgiving the well doneness, it just had no flavor or juiciness. The saving grace was a nice olive tapenade on the burger. It was $14.

We loved the food - particularly the octopus, the ribs and the blistered local peppers.  Portions were more generous than expected - no complaints!  For entrees we shared the chicken.  Roast chicken is not an adequate description - it was perfectly cooked - even the thick breast meat was moist - and the accompaniments were terrific (including the liver mousse and the medjool dates that provided a sweetness complementing the richness of the mousse).  We also loved the halibut dish which included perfectly cooked prawns (not at all overcooked so these weren't just sitting waiting to be served) and the dusting of spicy chorizo corteza on the fish gave it a spicy kick without overwhelming the fish or the lovely beans and sweet roasted tomatoes on the plate.  We also ended on a high note with a fabulous ice cream sandwich (olive oil ice cream and the chocolate cookie were a great match).  \n\nThe service was generally very attentive, but unfortunately our server forgot our order of grilled sweet corn (we had so much food we didn't follow up), we weren't even asked if we wanted water (we did and had to flag someone down to get it), and our coffee was tepid (despite being poured fresh).  Drinks are custom made but getting the drinks from the bar to the table took more time than I expected given the fact the restaurant wasn't filled and the bar area was also not very busy.  However, our server was helpful in her suggestions about what to order and how to enjoy the meal, and the coffee wasn't charged to us.  \n\nAll in all, this is a lovely spot in the Presidio with fantastic food - strong flavors, authentic Spanish style and a welcome addition to the San Francisco restaurant community with its overweighted inspiration from the Mediterranean (in general), Italy (in particular) and Asia.", "author": "Bonnie L."}

I dined at the bar. Had to ask for water, utensils and a napkin. After 30 minutes, I had to ask about my salad course. It finally arrived and was a bunch of oversized, dry leaves. The main course was a mediocre New York strip that was not even close to the strip at Brazenhead or Bobo's.  The wines are served in stemless glasses that are supposed to be some sort of retro \"commissary theme.\" If you want a bath on the way out, then you will enjoy being sprayed by the Presidio sprinklers next to your car.", "author": "Rick R."}

Small uninspired menu; sweet but completely untrained server; the \"charred rosemary vinaigrette\" was just olive oil and salt - when we asked our server about that, she checked with the kitchen and was told \"we forgot to make that today\".  We've eaten at Traci des Jardin's restaurants in the past and were always pleased.  It's a little past time to be working out the kinks in this new restaurant.  Maybe they should stick to dinner.

There was a very hectic, disorganized feel to the service.  Bartenders and wait people were seen bickering over tabs and a beer question was answered by wait person saying that they did not drink beer so couldn't speak to the question.

We went with another couple and first impression of the decor was bland, people were eating their dinner on a Saturday night in sports clothes (which is fine and typical in SF for brunch or at Blue Barn for a salad but not so much at a $$$ restaurant on the weekend for dinner), and the waiter had zero personality. Service was slow, food was small portions for the price (we love gourmet / high quality dinning but this wasn't worth it), meatballs dry, potatoes boring, peppers needed more sea salt and to be charred / seared more, tuna was nice but small, deserts tiny (chocolate bar too rich - needed something to break it up like a light cream of sorts, and olive oil cake a non-event). The toilet has a broken tap and the lights were super bright. They couldn't get the lighting in the restaurant right (you could see them turning it up and down every 15 minutes which disrupted the ambience), they needed candles on the table or something to add charm. My husband didn't like the cod fritter appetizer. The corn on the cod was really good! The swiss chard didn't float my boat and the music was Pandora. Ahhh well worth a try but would not recommend it to anyone and feel bad for the owners as they didn't manage to execute on the overall experience. We walked out the door and no one said thanks or said goodbye. Better off going to the Presidio Social Club for an iconic SF experience.

No signage in Presidio and front signage is hardly visible. \n2. If you're one who doesn't drink/drive and prefer taxis, you might want to pass on this one, as taxis can't find it going there and won't come to pick you up afterwards.\n3. Communal tables can be fun for lunch and for some for casual dinners. However, if with a date or friend, I'd like to be able to have some privacy to my conversation.\n4. We were seated at a communal table with two other couples, both of whom had small children, who were misbehaving. We could have stayed home with our own noisy children!\n4. Because of the communal tables, waiters come up behind patrons to take their order and we had to turn our heads/chairs around everytime he came up behind us to bring/discuss something. In most restaurants with regular tables, you can actually face your server and not have to twist your neck everytime he comes up behind you.\n5. Service was terrible. When seated, server plopped down napkins, but forgot utensils. Had to flag him down for plates, wine refills, bill  and other requests. \n6. \"Small plate\" items were served in crocks that resembled pet food dishes. Rustic, but not exactly attractive!\nFood\n1. Most small plates were unattractive as ingredients just seemed mushed together with not thought to attractiveness of plating..\n2. Cod cakes were dry and flavorless. Chicken and mushrooms just okay. \n3. Others at our table seemed equally unimpressed. \n4. For prices, it felt like dining in a cafeteria setting. Nothing on tables to ehance experience. Someone kept turning lights up/down, obviously trying to find right \"ambiance\"...there is none.\nSuggestions:\n1. Please provide some tables for parties of 2 and 4, so patrons can have privacy and not get neck strain turning around to talk with servers and have to sit with children or noisy, unpleasant stranger tablemates..\n2. Bars and high backless stools are fine for drinks/barfood, but not comfortable for an entire evening. \nWould like to see this succeed and I'm sure it will as it's the only game in the Presidio.

The food was so flavorful--layered, complex, distinctive, and bright. We had trout, sablefish, pork, and chicken dishes at our table--all lovely. We had the artisanal bread paired with pasture 42 olive oil. This olive oil makes what you buy in a store (no matter how expensive) seem rancid and harsh. So this is what real Spanish olive oil tastes like--mild, silky, pure. The service was great; attentive, engaged.

I love the setting - they've done a really nice job on the space and I enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the chefs prepare dinner. Dinner was good enough, but not all that memorable. The biggest issue, however, was the service. A few issues in this area:\n\n- Our waiter disappeared for long stretches of time. It took probably 20 minutes for him to take our order. Our neighbors at the bar complained about the same issue.\n- It felt like the waiter was padding his tip. We ordered 2 starters, 1 entree, and 1 side to share between the two of us, to which the waiter said \"that's a really light meal\" and urged us to get another item. I added another starter and it ended up being way too much food. By the time our entree came out we weren't that hungry and left half of the dish and more than half of the side of squash uneaten. When the bill came there was an extra drink on there and when we informed the waiter he was less than apologetic. Instead, he seemed disappointed that we noticed...\n- We must have waited 20 minutes after our appetizers were cleared for the entree to come out. Since we were sitting at the bar we could watch what was happening and it seems that they batch prepare all of their dishes, so they waited until a few other people ordered the chicken before preparing ours. I'm sure this is standard in the restaurant industry but they haven't quite figured out how to time it right. \n- One final issue is that they charge for sparkling water (not bottled, but the kind that they make on-site). I wouldn't have an issue with this, except that they ask whether you want still or sparkling water before even handing you the menu, giving the impression that they are both offered free of charge, as is customary in many similar restaurants. It shows up in a carafe, so again, no indication that they will charge $4 for it. I would just appreciate a more upfront approach if this is the decision that they have made (for example, the menu clearly states that they charge for bread and olive oil). \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed some of the dishes but not enough to make me want to come back.", "author": "Emily S."}

I think my biggest issue is service. We were greeted a couple of times by 1 server but that server never came back to take our order which is ok. Server #2 came by answered a few questions and got order. He never came back to check on the food while we were eating. He did checked but after we were just about done. Never refilled our water or wine or maybe once towards the end. I watched him clear another table and as he was walking to the kitchen he dropped a knife it made a pretty loud noise and what shocked me was he walked back and never picked up the knife he just left it by the guest's feet and no one else made an effort either. Just surprised for a restaurant by Traci. I hope they work out the kinks soon.", "author": "Hawaii t."}

It's so nice to go to dinner \"outside of the city\" without leaving the city. Gotta love the Presido. Because of the location, I think this place would be GREAT for brunch. BUT, location is not everything, and sadly, I likely won't be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon for the food, or for the drinks at that. I came here with a friend and we ate at the chefs table (or whatever they called the wrap around bar surrounding the kitchen). If there's only 2 of you, sit here, it's great. Sitting in front of the pastry chef making desserts all night(most popular were the churros) was a treat, and we \"treated\" ourselves to the churros naturally. To start, I had the \"Wett Mutt\" cocktail which basically tasted like straight up Gin. Undrinkable, had to send it back. We ordered the sausage and cheese plate, pork albondigas, and sweet pea and ham croquetas to start. The sweet pea croqueta was delish(anything fried is good). For entrees, we had the chickpea galetta(vegetarian option) and a fish option. The galettas were too dry with a creamy something that really had no flavor. The fish was also quite average/bland. The churros, however were YUMMY. Dipped in chocolate and a delicious latte to wash it down, were the highlights of the meal. Service was totally decent and I loved the restaurant space.  It's worth trying at least once, again, for the location. Lunch and then some Disney museum action would be a great way to spend the day.", "author": "Courtney G."}
