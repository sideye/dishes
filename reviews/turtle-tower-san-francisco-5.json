We ordered:\n1. Small chicken pho ($9)\n2. Small pho with rare beef ($9) (because they wouldn't substitute anything for anything else or else I would have got the pho with rare beef, well done beef and tripe)\n3. Thai Tea ($4.25)\n4. Fried Imperial Rolls with Vermicelli Noodle, Lettuce, Mint and Cilantro ($11.50)\n\nWe had some doubts before coming from reading what other people wrote on Yelp. Be warned, the other things they give you to accompany your pho are jalapeno slices and 1 wedge of lime each. Because people seemed to really like the chicken pho, that is what le bf got. He thought that is was pretty good when compared to other chicken pho that he has had. \n\nI normally get pho with rare beef and tripe. This place didn't have that combo. I tried to order the rare beef, well done beef and tripe and instead of well done beef, I wanted to get another portion of rare beef. I was sadly informed that they don't do any kind of substitutions. That is unfortunate. My pho came with 5 very small pieces of rare beef. I would have expected a bit more, even in SF. Overall, I've had richer broth, and the pho was just ok. It was edible, but nothing special. \n\nThe Thai tea was laughably small for $4.25. It was just slightly larger than the small water glasses they provided. Total rip off. It tasted good, but had I known how large the cup was going to be, I wouldn't have ordered it. \n\nWe also ordered the imperial rolls, which came out after both of us had finished our small bowls of pho. On the plate, we saw 3 tiny imperial rolls with 2 leaves of lettuce, some mint, cilantro, noodles, and dipping sauce. they didn't even give us enough lettuce leaves to eat our  If we ordered just one imperial roll, it was have been $3.25 each. If you were thinking about it, don't order it. The imperial rolls were about 3.5 inches long and very skinny, like if you tied 2 of your skinniest fingers together.\n\nFor more than $40 (including tax and tip), this was super, super expensive Vietnamese food. When we got into our Uber, the first thing le bf said was \"that was super expensive\". Even though we finished every single item, I was still hungry so we stopped by Taco Bell afterwards so that I could fill my tummy with the 3 taco combo. Needless to say, we will NOT be back.

The meat did not have any flavor, the pickled vegetables were not particularly fresh, and the bread was nothing but an edible envelope for bland ingredients.\n\nThe sticky rice dish was even more disappointing. When a dish categorized as a \"Special\" is as poorly executed as this one was, I know I'm not going to take a chance on coming back and trying something else.

The size large isn't that big, probably the size of a small or regular elsewhere. The broth was extremely flavorful and aromatic. The noodles were okay, could have been a bit chewier, but were nicely cooked and not stuck together. The #10 has shredded chicken meat and skin which provides texture and fattiness to an otherwise very lean dish. The chicken giblets were fantastic, although I did not care for the toughness of the kidneys (but that's just the nature of eating the kidneys). \n\nThis pho is from northern Vietnam which means it's not served with the plum sauce, sprouts, and basil that you might be used to.  You won't miss them much, as the chicken flavor is so pure and rich. \n\nApparently the place has been recently remodeled and looks quite nice inside, although they have too many tables in a cramped setting, so much so that one of the tables needed to be left empty as no more customers could squeeze in around it.\n\nI'll certainly be back for the pho ga, and maybe the steamed chicken with rice. \n\nPro Tip: Please don't put your chili sauce / sriracha directly into the broth.

The limited spice and fish sauce added to the broth was not too salty and overpowering that it did not take the essential chicken taste away.  The rice noodles were wide and soft.  I normally like my noodles al dente, but in this particularly case, it matched really well with the broth and meat.  Finally, the chicken was pulled and cut into small bite size pieces with a mixture of dark and white meat.  It was a good contrast between the soft and more flavorful dark meat verus the firm but subtle taste of the white meat.  The giblets added a fulfilling crunch to every bite. \n\nThe nem cua was fried to perfection.  And in this particular case, I could actually taste the crab meat (There are a lot establishments elsewhere that would cheap out and increase the ratio of the pork filling). When eaten with the noodles and lettuce and dipped in the fish sauce, it's elevated to an whole new level.  Definitely recommend trying this dish here at least once.\n\nWhat's keeping me from giving this 5 stars was that the portion size were too small.  I judge a restaurant by the culinary experience I received versus the amount I paid.  I have no problem giving a shabby \"normal\" place a perfect score if the value accurately reflects it.  In this case I left the restaurant not hungry but not fulfilled.  In addition I don't think claiming that the chickens were raised \"free-ranged\" can justify the increase in price.  The USDA states that free-range only means that the animal has access to outdoors.  It does not regulate the amount of time the chicken is outdoors, the size of the outdoor space, or its food source. \n\nIn conclusion I definitely recommend this place to any pho lover.  I'm sure there are many non-Vietnamese people that would appreciate knowing there is a different style of pho out there.  Just don't expect to be stuffed of full when you finish your meal.", "author": "Chris W."}

I'm a generous reviewer and from this experience I have no problem dishing a bad rating.\n\nToday my lady and I visited Turtle Tower on 6th during lunch and had the pleasure *sarcasm* to be waited on by the biggest douchebag waiter/server I've ever dealt with. Viet guy with backwards baseball cap and jeans. Quite simply a jerk. Yeah you know who you are. And for the restaurant's sake I hope it was a heat of the moment thing and you don't do that again. \n\nEntering the restaurant just after the peak lunch crowd we were seated at a table for two by the door. Seeing that there were two tables by the window I asked if we could sit by the window to \"people watch\" and observe this part of the city I wasn't very familiar with. This guy says \"sorry you have two people and those tables are for four. Thank you.\" I'm thinking... well okay that sucks but it is what it is. No worries. He was polite up to this point. \n\nAfter ordering from him I look around and see a large booth with only two people on the other side of the restaurant. A customer then walks in and sits down gesturing another server if he can sit at one of the empty tables by the window, a female worker, and she gives her approval and orders food soon thereafter. Well alrighty then. The same female server brings us water and I ask her if we can sit at the other table and she immediately approves. Great! Well is it really? I believe around this time is where the male server started to mentally snap. \n\n\nI started to enjoy the view from my new window seat. Finally I get to try this Turtle Tower location even with its almost decent 79 health score. After all it's better than the other two right?! I've been to the Larkin location once and Geary location several times in the past and enjoyed the Northern style Vietnamese noodle soup. I'm from San Jose so I'm well versed in Southern style for almost two decades, so I like mixing it up from time to time. \n\nHere comes the food! Wait what is this? The female worker brings us two bowls and neither looks like chicken, what my lady ordered, and the other has tripe. The male server heard us and steps in front of the poor female server with a menu and insists on what we ordered. \n\nI don't like tripe and I didn't order the dac biet (special). I keep it simple and always ALWAYS order Tai Chin (steak brisket) or chicken. I've done this a billion times yet this guy tells me this is what we ordered. Okay buddy so you're straight up telling me that we are liars in front of all the other customers with a straight face. \n\nMy lady argues with him and he has the AUDACITY (I never use this word in real life!!!) to tell my lady what she said didn't matter and for me to speak. WTF??? I was only quiet at that point because I was blown away and annoyed beyond measure. I did my best to coherently explain to him (albeit in annoyed fashion) that we know what we ordered and what was brought to us wasn't it. I had enough and said \"let's just go\" and that's when the server dashed away. As we got up the (poor) female server. Was bringing the corrected order and said something along the line of \"so you're not staying?\" I felt bad for her. She was caught in the middle of all this and if I stayed at the original table none of this would have happened. Leaving in haste I replied to her \"no, that guy is giving us attitude\" and left. \n\nThere was 7-8 customers there when we ran off. I hope other Yelpers were there to see what disservice was done to us. Perhaps they could give me reassurance or perhaps another perspective. I am a fair person and would love to hear all sides. Many thoughts go through my mind, but as a customer I feel I was truly given bad treatment. I mean was it wrong to request a table by the window when there were plenty? Was it wrong to ask again to another server? \n\nIn any case this may be my first 1 star review for a restaurant and 2nd ever in my 10 years of Yelping.

I would give this place as 3 stars but since my husband and my brother liked the Pho here so I gave it a 4 stars. The Pho here is Pho Bac (Northern Pho) so it's definitely different than other Pho's I've been eating (we are from the South). Pho here has a very beefy aroma comparing to the herbs aroma at most other Pho places. This Pho doesn't come with basil leaves or bean sprouts. It's just beef broth, beef, and noodles. My husband and brother appreciated the simplicity of the Pho here but I rather the multi-flavored profile Pho with variety of beefy meats and tripe from the Midwest Pho.", "author": "Minh N."}

This location of Turtle Tower is right off of the freeway in SOMA and in a very industrialized location. We came pretty early in the night and were the only ones there but as we left, most tables were taken.\n\nI ordered the small #9 Pho Ga and A got a large #6 Pho Bo Ap Chao Nuoc. Our noodles arrived blazingly fast with the normal plate of bean sprouts, lime and jalapenos. My Pho Ga was exceptionally salty however the chicken was well-cooked and I imagine if you were sick, this would be a bowl of heaven. A small was the perfect size for me to finish but to be comfortably full. My boyfriend's food was also a bit salty but the beef was seasoned well and the grilled vegetables added a nice depth. He was able to finish his large as well.\n\nFor 2 people, this meal was quite cheap coming in around $20. Would I rush back? Probably not unless I was in the area where there aren't many other options. I do think that there are better bowls of Pho in the city but for this particular day, it worked just fine and hit the spot.", "author": "Carrie W."}

The secret beef item is the \"K6\" and the chicken is the \"F9\" which denote the variation since number 6 on the menu is beef and 9 is chicken. I tried the F9 which came with extra toppings such as sliced viet ham(I think), some other chicken meat and some bits of ginger. There was even more in the soup but I couldn't identify the frenzy of ingredients involved. What I do know is that it was absolutely delicious. The broth is richer and there's so much more meat that you get a piece with almost every bite. The broth is still clean and not oily despite all the extra flavors involved.

While I really don't mind performing my civic duty, clearly my nice, hot bowl of Pho Ga was the highlight of my day.  Well, that and not having to serve.  Which I probably just jinxed for next time as well...\n\nAlthough I've yet to try all that the city has to offer, Turtle Tower's Pho Ga has been the best one I've come across so far.  Nice meat-to-noodle ratio, tender noodles, and a fairly flavorful broth that's not overly salty.  For whatever reason though, it didn't seem quite as good at this location (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/turtle-tower-restaurant-san-francisco-3?select=qPxHdydcJr9tM9QTa4xC_w#pWGE4eqATQsTawjfLTXHEA).  I don't know if the broth didn't have enough seasoning or if the balance was off, but it just wasn't as satisfying as normal.  Still decent, but not satisfying.\n\nGiven its close proximity to the courthouse, it should be noted that it gets mighty busy during peak lunch hours.  If you're here on your own, don't be surprised if you end up sharing a four-top with someone you don't know, and for service to be hurried so that they can turn the table over for the next party(s).\n\nDespite the service, the Pho Ga broth is the main reason why this Turtle Tower location only gets three stars while the one on Geary got a four (haven't reviewed the one in the TL yet).  That said, even if the pho had been perfect, I don't know if I could ever give any Turtle Tower five stars.  Not when this tiny, mediocre-at-best imperial roll cost me $2.15 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/turtle-tower-restaurant-san-francisco-3?select=qPxHdydcJr9tM9QTa4xC_w#r8u6AjD3URInAosLik8zxw).\n\nThen again, I guess it's my fault for forgetting from my first time and ordering it again.

I wanted to try their probably-famous-pho, but it was such a hot day, I decided to opt for grilled pork over steamed rice ($7.75). The pork is the most important meal of the plate, and it was dry.

The noodles are wider and the broth is more simple. If you get one thing for lunch/dinner, you must get the Pho Ga! \n\n-- Food / Drink --\n-------------------\nPho Ga ($7): The pho came with lemon and jalapeno slices. I always squeeze at least two lemon / lime slices into my broth to top it off. The broth was not too salty and the chicken was surprisingly not dry. I never order Pho Ga at other places because the chicken has always been so dry and shreddy that it's disgusting and inedible. Also, portion sizes here are humongous! The small is more like a medium-sized bowl. I ordered a small and could not finish all my noodles. And I eat a lot! One thing that I would have liked -- the broth could have been warmer. \n\nFresh Spring Rolls ($5.50): Each order includes four mega spring rolls and comes with peanut sauce. One spring roll was more than enough for me. I liked the long pieces of green onion and how the roll had less mint than normal.  \n\nThree Color Bean Dessert($3.15): Compared to the dessert chain Bambu, the three color bean dessert drink is more watered down and less sweet. The jelly was also soft but maybe it's because we got the last two drinks and they were sitting there the entire day. \n-------------------\n\nI've heard mixed reviews about Turtle Tower but in the end, I liked the pho. I would come back to try the various beef pho's and also get another bowl of the pho ga! \n\n** It's cash only but there's an ATM inside.

After we were finishing up our meals we finally got our tiny imperial rolls that were 2.50 each. I'm not even kidding that these rolls were bite size. \n\nAfter we finished our meal we asked for more water.

However, I now date someone who lives in the Mission, and convenience combined with car access (convenience x2) has made this my go-to pho spot when I'm in town.\n\nThe problem? They're like, never open! Ok, I shall explain: they are NOT open on Sundays. That is stated... somewhere. I now know after showing up a couple of times on the Sabbath and being greeted with a sad \"Sorry, we're closed\" sign. Another time, we arrived just a couple minutes past 9pm, which is their closing time. As we left I waved forlornly at those customers who were finishing up their meals inside. Finally, one other time we came here at the ripe dinner time of 6pm, and they were closed for a private party. UGH. Perhaps this is just my bad luck, but this spot tends to be very picky with its hours! More so than I'd expect from a pho restaurant (which should be open whenever I want it to be, of course), but I guess it might have to do with its weird location. Anyway, thought I'd warn you.\n\nAside from all that, I'm definitely a fan of the pho ga (chicken pho). I find myself craving the wide pho noodles that characterize it... they're just so soothing to slurp. I haven't a problem with the broth, though abovementioned partner is Vietnamese and therefore an expert due to the millions of bowls of pho he has consumed over his lifetime... he says it's nothing special. I think it's worth trying, but perhaps you should NOT go out of your way and check out either the Richmond or Little Saigon locations first.\n\nOther happenings of note:\n* It's very clean for a pho restaurant.\n* Once they seated two of us in a booth and after ordering moved us to a smaller table to accommodate a party of 4 waiting outside. We did it without fuss, but still, kinda weird.", "author": "Kate V."}

Then with every spoonful of noodles, take a little of that jalapeno or sauce as well, and it's just super tasty. \n\nI've also had the beef and leek stir fry soup noodles, that's good but not as clean and savory as the Pho ga (chicken pho). The beef pho is also good, depending on your mood. I don't see many people getting the banh mi or rice plates here.

We decided to brave the storm and walk over anyway.\n\nI ordered their large pho dac biet, which is pretty much the benchmark of pho dishes and the basis for my comparison.  It wasn't served with any of the basil, bean sprouts, and other stuff that you'd expect since this is the northern style cuisine, and there wasn't even any hoisin sauce.  I was ok with that since I really enjoyed the combination of flavors served.  The all important soup was definitely unique but I liked how bold the flavors were in it so it really didn't need much seasoning.

It's located in VERY close proximity to our office, so it's always a very convenient lunch option as long as we go before or after the rush (which is usually 12-1 p.m.). If you come during the rush, expect a good 30 minute or so wait I would guess -- we just call in and let them know when we're coming haha \n\nThe small pho ga is, I believe, about $6.95. It's a good price for the bowl you get, which comes with a good amount of chicken and plenty of noodles. The broth isn't as flavorful as Quan Ngon (my holy grail chicken pho on Noreiga), and not as consistent. One day it was more watery than the other, bleh. I do, however, like how they slice up the jalapenos super thin and give you a lot!\n\nI ordered a rice dish to go once -- it was absolutely terrible.

How can two Turtle Towers be this different in execution and still have the same menu? It's kinda when Patty Duke played identical twin cousins who were total opposites, then they played each other to fool others and knee-slapping hilarity ensues. No hilarity to be found here. Just a standard Vietnamese place in a location that isn't the most pedestrian-friendly at the relatively barren corner of 6th and Bryant. It feels downright suburban compared to the more densely populated Little Saigon location (see my review - http://www.yelp.com/biz/turtle-tower-restaurant-san-francisco#hrid:idtbVotN081VoyQb9aXurw). \n\nI ordered the same thing I order at the other location. Jamie W. and I shared the $4.95 Goi Cuon (Spring Rolls), which are impossible to fail with fresh prawns and basil leaves peeking through the near-transparent rice paper. It comes with with addictive peanut dipping sauce (see photo). We both ordered the same entree, the large $7.95 bowl of Pho Bo Dac Biet, which has strips of rare beef, tripe, flank and brisket (see photo). This is where it went wrong - the broth didn't taste right like it was watered down considerably. Pho with only marginally satisfying broth just shouldn't exist. That's when pho should be spelled with an 'F'. \n\nAnother disappointment was the $7.05 Ga Luoc, a small plate of steamed chicken served with a ginger dipping sauce (see photo). There was an unwanted gamey (...or should I say farmy) flavor that made it almost inedible. When a dish as high-risk as steamed chicken tastes not quite right, you just stop eating it. There's no saving it. Bummer. Customers here are more of a melting pot with not only Asian families but lots of mechanics from the nearby car dealers eating lunch here. The rainbow blend is a plus, but it's too bad that they're coming to a place where the food can be subpar. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...darn disappointing compared to the original Turtle Tower in Little Saigon, especially the pho broth \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...feels like a mall court place \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...appeared more focused on turnover \nTOTAL - 3 stars...worth strolling to the Tenderloin to get something more flavorful than what they have here", "author": "Ed U."}

The official grand opening is scheduled for next Wednesday, June 1, but I couldn't wait one whole week so as soon as I heard what the limited menu was I stepped in to try it out.\n\nFor the record the 4 items served on the Wednesday I visited were the Well-done Flank and Beef Brisket Noodle Soup, the Rare Beef Noodle Soup, the Chicken Noodle Soup and Imperial Rolls.\n\nThose four choices suited me fine as all I really wanted was a hot bowl of beef noodle soup so I ordered a large Rare Beef Noodle Soup and a couple of Imperial Rolls.  As I've come to expect from their Geary location the service here is just as speedy with your food ready in mere minutes after your order is placed.  Accompanied by a lime wedge and some thinly sliced jalapenos plated separately the clear beef broth seemed just a tad too oily (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KAHDxIOccnc1P1m5abjM0A?select=qPxHdydcJr9tM9QTa4xC_w), but once I dove into that bowl the extra oil on top seemed unnoticeable.\n\nThe flavor-rich broth was perfectly seasoned and I loved the hint of ginger in it.  The portion of noodles and beef to broth was perfect.  The Imperial Rolls can be ordered as an entr\u00e9e with vermicelli noodles and fresh veggies, but I elected to order just two on its own (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KAHDxIOccnc1P1m5abjM0A?select=zdAwClljoGD8NWdEzZUlDg).  These were very good as most deep-fried goodies are, and since I do no deep-frying at home you can bet I'll order these again on a future visit.\n\nSo far in 2011 I've done a lot more cooking at home, and brown-bagging my meals for work have become the norm for me, but I know for a fact I can't make pho this good at home so I may need to rethink this whole not-going-out-to-restaurants-too-often thing thanks to the new Turtle Tower Restaurant.\n\nAs mentioned by another Yelper in her review some culinary surprises available only at this Turtle Tower location awaits you.

One of the few to offer a fried egg option, others are Bun Mee, Little Green Cyclo food truck, and Banh Mi Ba Le in Oakland.\n\nMost prices are similar to the Larkin location, including the imperial rolls for $2.15 each (ouch!). Except that most Pho (small $6.20-$7.20, large $7.20-$8.20) and entrees costs about 25 cents more here. Not by much, so I think it's okay.\n\nI'm concerned that this area has no foot traffic on weekends. Except for a few places like McDonald's, most eateries are open weekdays for lunch only. So I don't think it's wise for TT to have weekends hours. A soup business is different from other eateries. The stove remains on for long hours to keep the soup hot, so their utilities bill is high even when they have no customers.\n\nI'd like TT to remain in business, so they need to make some wise decisions from the beginning. Otherwise they'll suffer the same fate as all the previous tenants that went out of business at this corner.\n\nHours: daily 9am-9pm (revised 2013)\n\n** Update 2013: In case u ever found this shop closed, when u thought it was open. Here's a brief synopsis of the schedule changes. Initial operating hours were 7am-5pm, later extended to 9pm, with a break between lunch and dinner service. Later it changed to continuous service, to match their other locations. Then on January 2013, the schedule was cut to Mon-Sat 10am-4pm, closed Sundays.

Parking was easy to find although traffic was pretty bad since they're right by the entrance to the Bay Bridge.\n\nWe walked in around 6:30pm and there was only one couple ahead of us waiting to get seated. The tables were filled save 3-4 tables that were waiting to get bussed. There were two servers - male and female - running around serving up food, taking orders, dealing with the checks but no one took notice of the crowd growing waiting to get seated and the dirty empty tables. I notice that the girl was doing most of the running around - she seated the couple ahead of us - while the boy was just hanging around behind the counter. We stood around for about 10 minutes without getting acknowledged until I had to walk up to the girl and ask if we could get a table for two.\n\nFinally the girl started cleaning up some of the tables while I guess some of the kitchen staff took pity and had to come out to help her. I don't understand what the heck the guy was doing behind the counter doing nothing. \n\nFood-wise, everyone knows Turtle Tower has bomb chicken pho. It's always tastes the same to me no matter which location I go to but for service I would prefer the Geary or Tenderloin location. Service picked up and became more efficient since the restaurant got quite crowded after we got our table.

We always get a solid amount of meat and a nice portion of noodle.  And the noodles...flat pho noodles.  These are life changers.  Taste way better than any other pho noodles I've had before.  And the broth?  Lovely flavor.  And it smells good.  Yeah, they always provide you limes and jalapenos, too.\n\nWe also get fried eggrolls.  Sometimes they're overcooked, but most of the time they're on point.  On point like their friend to golden perfection.  The vermicelli is soft and sticky.  Sometimes it's hard to pull it apart but it's no big deal.\n\nThey're not that expensive either.  For the two of us to get a small and large pho and the rolls, including tip, it's normally $30.

Come on, I am vietnamese and I know what good pho tastes like. I have to admit though that the broth is pretty refreshing and light, but nothing is comparable to the classic beef pho. \n\nThe bf and I ordered two pho ga and spring rolls. Firstly, the pho ga is super simple. They do not even have hoison sauce! I MEAN COME ON.. i grew up using that stuff for every soup I eat! Then they tell me that they do not add any veggies like bean sprouts either!! WHOA DER.. thats the sole reason I come for pho! And on top of that the spring rolls were a little less than $6 but really cost .50 cents to make. They were sparse in every detail, there was definitely not even noodle, sauce or shrimp. SOOOO LAME. Overall, I would probably give it a better star if I had eaten the beef pho, but to be honest.. I really NEED HOISON SAUCE!!! :( Plus the wait may be really long considering the small tables and you might have to share a table with strangers as they have these signs that say \"sharing table\"\n\nOn a brighter note, the lady that runs this place is SUPER nice and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-02", "description": "Turtle Tower is unique because it serves northern-style pho, also known as pho bac. Its simplicity sets it apart from the southern style pho you'd find in most restaurants. You don't get the plate of garnishes considered standard with southern style, so you can't customize your pho. Northern pho is designed to eat exactly as is - though there were actually some sauces on the table and jalepenos brought on the side, so maybe pho bac isn't as strict as I thought. Or Turtle Tower has made a few compromises. Either way.\n\nI always think of parking in San Francisco as a big pain. Parallel parking and meters prevail, and I'm too lazy to deal with it all, so I rarely make it into the city. Parking here wasn't too bad, though. After a few laps around the block, I found a nearby spot. The SoMa location is on a corner easily accessible from the freeway and has a sunny interior, with shades of yellow and cool old photos on the walls. It was noisy, not a place you'd like to sit for hours, but comfortable enough.\n\nThe menu features pho, bun, cm, banh mi, and a few special items like chao (rice porridge) and even xoi (sticky rice). Though I've been advised to try the pho sot vang, I had to first try Turtle Tower's specialty, the pho ga. It turned out to be an amazing choice.\n\nThink of it as the best chicken noodle soup you will ever eat. A fragrant, flavorful chicken broth deepened with the wonderful spices that define pho. Excellent quality, though quite oily. Thick, fresh noodles that render you incapable of understanding how any restaurant can serve anything else, finished with a generous topping of green onions and cilantro to brighten the dish. It's heavenly. If you were hungover, sick, or depressed, I think this would fix you right up. It was damn near perfect, but the serving of chicken, though ample, was a tad dry.\n\nTender, moist chicken would have made this pho absolutely flawless, and would probably have had me on my knees with tears streaming down my face. I'm kind of glad it wasn't, so I could keep it together. But the one flaw could be overlooked, and I'll still consider this one of the best bowls of pho I've ever had. The portion was huge, too. We both ordered smalls, which were only $6.75, and were more than satisfied. I couldn't even finish, which was unusual for me!

I get it, I have been to Vietnam (north and south) and have had pho from both. I am not disappointed in the noodles because I knew what to expect. Turtle towers website states \"Turtle Tower's specialty is its broths. Strictly northern-style, the soup comes with no side garnishes or bean sprouts, common accompaniments of Southern and Americanized pho.\" While I acknowledge the approach, I wanted some damn garnishes and siracha! I was hungover, I wanted to sweat into my soup and be on my mary way. \"Americanized\" pho? You're in America, bro. let me garnish this bish!\n\nInstead, what I got was a so-so bowl of pho. The broth was good in the pho ga but it didn't blow my mind like they think they do. Size wise, the \"large\" was equivalent to Kevin's noodle house's medium and came into $10 after tip, which is about \"Americanized\" as pho gets. In Vietnam it's considered \"poor man's soup\", so simmer down guys. When asked if I wanted a water or hot tea, I asked for both. He looked at me stern and says, \"no, which one?!\"... weird. Theyre both free, but okay.\n\nNote: I went at lunch time which was prime time. I waited about 15 minutes for a table of one and many others waiting as well. Two older Vietnamese gentlemen walked up, said something to the owner/manager and got seated before everyone else without ever putting their name on the list.

This is why i'm dissing your grandma in such a pubic place.\n     If you are new in town or just visiting SF, here is how I order it;\n\nLARGE PHO GA  (That's their chichen pho of course!)\n     - i ask for less noodles because its always more than enough noodles and i want all the beautiful broth i can get.. \n     - if you or your friend are squeamish about chicken skin, you can ask for no skin or just breast meat for a little extra $)  \n     -everyone gets a side of sliced jalapenos and lemon wedge. Dump the jalapenos into the soup (if you are into spicy) and ask for some extra lemon.  I squeeze one wedge in the soup and one in the little condiment dish, where I will add fish sauce and pepper to taste. This is your \"house-made\" dipping sauce for your chicken:)\n     -please note  this is northern vietnamese style so you dont get that plate full of bean sprouts and herbs\n\nIMPERIAL ROLL \n     -entree order so you get the lettuce, vermicelli, and herbs to make wraps.\n      -order comes with three rolls.  But you can order them individually (without the sides) if you are alone or want a just a little more.\n     - I use a drizzle of sriracha in the dipping sauce for a little kick.\n\nVIETNAMESE COFFEE \n     -thank God they still use the individual drip method (i hate it when it comes premixed) \n     -after brewing, I will sometimes carefully spoon out some of the sweetened condensed milk at the bottom of the glass. Then of course stirring together the coffee/milk and pouring it over the ice. (Its sometimes too sweet if you don't...you\"ll understand when you see it) \n\nHOUSE TEA\n     - its free and good for you \n\nPost Scriptum:\n     \"But joe, my boyfriend is in the mood for beef and he gets kinda crabby when he's hungover?\"  I hear ya! No worries, when I'm in that red meat mood, their beef Pho is a very good arternative. But actually i would recommend:\n\n PHO BO AP CHAO NUOC (Stir-fried Beef with Celery, Carrot, Onion, and Leek) Its pan-fried with the same noodle and then soup is poured over.  I love this one too!", "author": "Joseph C."}

They acknowledge the Scoutmob deal and were really nice about it. My brother had trouble getting on the app, but they took his word for it even though we insisted that we properly check in.\n\nWhen our spring rolls and three hot steaming bowls of pho ga came out, we dug in right away cause we were starved.\n\nThe spring roll was a clear rice wrapper of greens, strips of sweet pork, vermicelli, and king shrimp. It comes with a satay-ish sauce with chopped peanuts, which was different cause usually it comes with a clear fish sauce with sweet, pickled carrot. I didn't really like the combination of the two and for four pieces for $5.50, I cannot justify ordering this again.\n\nThe pho ga did not have the classic rice vermicelli that is used for pho. I think this was cause we showed up late in the day and after a full week of free pho promotions, they ran out of those noodles.  However the broth and chicken did save the entree! The chicken is actual just-minced chicken, not some stale pieces chicken breast cutlet that's been sitting around for ages. It's not dry, it actually quite moist. That's a plus cause I honestly cannot stand eating dry sandpaper chicken. The stock used for the broth is flavored well enough that I didn't add any condiments, just a squeeze of lime to bring out the tanginess.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add is that they are CASH ONLY. They had one of those ATMs that charge a hefty fee for withdrawals and the nearest BoA or Chase is miles away.\n\nOverall, Turtle Tower is good for your quick pho craving. It's not what you would go to for the best pho around SF, but it satisfies you when you're doing jury duty and the only other fare available is McDonald's.", "author": "Anna F."}

As an example, think of a standard less-than-$5 chicken Vietnamese sandwich. It has bread, chicken, mayo (or something like it), cilantro, jalapenos, and shredded carrots, all included in the less-than-$5 price. This exact sandwich at Turtle Tower sets you back $10.70. Those following my Vietnamese math will recognize that this amount can get 3 sandwiches at Saigon Sandwich or a whopping 4 at Cam Huong. #justsayin\n\nAnother menu notable is the side dish \"Long Ga: Chicken Giblets\".

I do have to say, their rare beef was exceptionally on par - soft and tender, melts in your mouth, just the right amount of redness, and complimented the soup base well. Though I finished all of my soup (an anomaly for me), I did feel as if it was missing...something. Let's just say, an extra kick. Bean sprouts, basil leaves, and/or lime wedges sure would have been perfect! \n\nOverall, my friend and I were satisfied with our noodle soups on a such a chilly and rainy early evening.

I took my mums here when the place hadn't relocated yet and after trying the pho ga soup, she exclaimed that, \"dis style of cooking bringing me back to the nort\". Sure, whatever that means. \nI had no clue what she's talking about but after a few more dinings here, I was hooked. Why? Because it's just like how my mums cooks her pho! Yes, it's a very simple yet complex dish. It's essentially broth from beef bone marrow with some spices and herbs but it takes a long time to cook as with any bouillon extraction. In any case, this soup is Bac (northern) style cooking (usually lean, bland and simple). \n\nI come here strictly for their pho tai (flat rice noodles with beef in beef broth). I find that the homemade noodles have just the right amount of consistency to them; not too chewy not to mushy-soft, a little slippery with a light bite. The taste is very light and you can definitely taste the freshness of noodles just made. With the slightly sweet, subtle taste of the broth with simple garnishes like green onions and cilantro (none of that beansprout nonsense), it is really the soup for the soul. That with the semi rare slices of beef, that gets cooked in the hot simmering broth to give it the right tenderness, is seriously some good stuff. I can't help but feel at home with my mums whenever I eat a bowl of this stuff. I can really relate to my mums when she says that this reminds her of home in Vietnam because a bowl of this belly good stuff brings me back home, where my heart is- with my mums! \n\nOh, it's very casual, good for solo lunches and cash only.

I usually don't like these types of drinks, but my mom wanted one- so I tried it out.  It was very sweet, but pretty good overall.  There are beans and jelly in the drink.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, with maybe 10 tables or so.  It seems like they do a lot of to-go orders.

It consisted of a tiny piece of lettuce, a slice of a vegetable I didn't recognize and five peels of a carrot (yes, I counted).

And what i don't like was they put little pieces of chicken fat strips in the soup..that's kind of disgusting no?\n\nThe weird thing was my friend ordered his with no cilantro..the soup tasted better but it was also oiler.  It was almost like a different soup base because his was more cloudy and mine was a cleaner clearer broth.  But we both ordered the same thing!   \n\nI would only come here if i was sick and needed a light and clean broth.

I understand they have expanded their hours and are now open later.  \n\nWe decided not to have our usual Pho Tai and try some of the different things on their menu and I'm really glad we did.  My wife had the Bun Cha and that was by far the best dish of the night.  It was wonderful and the pork and sauce were just wonderful.  I got the Ap Chao which is a Beef Pho dish with pan fried noodles, vegetables, and stir fried beef.  It was also very good.  We also tried the Bunh Cuon, which was not out favorite dish, but still good.  Everything was flavorful and fresh.  The waitress who was working that night was very friendly and helpful in guiding us through a number of different options on the menu.  One of these days I'm sure I'll get back to try the Pho Tai, but with all the options on the menu I may end up trying something else.

Their consistent service of having only one waiter on duty REALLY irks me.   Each and EVERY time it takes them at least 10 minutes to get me water and take my order after I've been seated, and that's pretty ridiculous to me considering it'll only take me 10 minutes to eat.  I've never spent an hour at a pho shop until I came to this spot (from being seated to paying and leaving).

Your order will come with sliced jalapenos and lemon though.\n\n3) The noodles are flat and wider then your typical Southern Vietnamese styled Pho.\n\n4) Remember to bring CASH, unless you want to use their ATM.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the food and it was solid 4 stars. I was disappointed in the wait time and the service offered at this location so I slightly lowered my rating.", "author": "Jason H."}

But what's NOT okay is that after you were told that there's hair in the soup, your waitress don't apologize and shows no regret as if it's normal to find hair and we are the crazy one for requesting for a new bowl. Start some customer service training or acting training, at least pretend that you care. Your soup is good and people love it.

It was different from any other pho I've had and I have to say I liked it. \n\nFirst off, the broth was fattier than your average pho broth. \n\nSecond, the noodles were wider. I liked this better than the skinny noodles because they still had some pull to them. The skinny noodles often soak up too much of the broth and become mush - so I liked their wide noodle choice better. \n\nThirdly, rare steak pho often comes with a thin slice of meat that is very dry and flavorless. Here they served it in a patty like form and it was much more flavorful and tender. \n\nThere is a bus stop right outside the restaurant so it's pretty easy to get to from the financial district. \n\nI wouldn't say it's cheap but only because we're talking about pho - any other food and I would think that such quantities were a bargain.

Especially when I wear long sleeved shirts, eating hot soup with spicy red spicy spice can be a near-death-by-dehydration experience.  Simply put, it's really embarrassing to watch me put away a bowl of hot anything.  Everything is fine until I start sweating, without warning or a build up, SUDDENLY sweat is pouring down my brow.  And my neck.  And my upper lips.  It looks like I'm having a hot flash, sudden death, and food sweats all at the same time.  Really quite frightening.\n\nThis brings us to the reason why I have never eaten a meal at Turtle Tower.  I usually order my chicken rice soup to go, then find a drafty, solitary location.  Maybe I eat fast.  Though not as fast as my BF.  And apparently Jessica T. is a hoover when it comes to food.  \n\nThe Chicken rice soup (it might go by another name but right now, I'm too lazy and unmotivated to lift a finger to research what the proper menu name might be) is made with chicken broth, rice cooked until it is quite loose but not yet paste, cilantro, chicken parts and water.  The cilantro makes it better.  All you people who cannot taste the true enlightening flavor of cilantro should feel sad that you will never know the grace of god in the form of cilantro.  Has anyone realized that the issue of cilantro has divided the world as much as the religion?  I think I just found a conspiracy!\n\nAs with most viet restaurants, MSG is a common seasoning in the kitchen.  When I eat MSG, it feels like someone put ruffies in my food.  One minute I'm chatting and doing fine, the next minute I've passed out, face first on the desk/floor/bathroom stall.  I won't remember anything when I wake up.  It's like those few hours of my life were stolen from me.  Now, what girl wouldn't like a decent black-out every now and again.  However, it's really frowned upon when that happens at work.

He was nice about it and offered to bring ready made coffee if it didn't finish filtering in a few minutes.  Against my internal wishes, my friend decided to order one too and now both of us were waiting for our iced coffees to finish filtering drop by drop.

The broth was flavorful, the chicken tender, and the noodles clean. I thoroughly enjoyed my bowl and wished the deal was for a bigger bowl after I was done with it.\n\nThe location itself isn't ideal. It's still in the TL and the streets can really smell depending on the time of day. The space is small inside and when it's crowded, the hostesses will ask if you mind sharing a table with others. \n\nOverall, if Norther Vietnamese cuisine is your thing, definitely stop by for a bowl.

They have longer business hours which cater to the late dinner crowds and also gives the SFPD a healthier option to McDonalds or Subway. \n\nWe had to try this place out also because of their extended dinner menu offered here aside from the usual chicken noodle soups and beef stew noodle soups at the other locations. \n\nWe ordered their chicken noodles soup (of course), with a side of 2 imperial rolls (dinner menu ones have crab and pork in them) and one order of their rice rolls with diced mushrooms and marinated pork. \n\nChicken noodle soup : excellent soup base, tender pieces of shredded dark and white chicken meat.\n\nImperial rolls : not my favorite. It had a onion infused taste to it and I do not like onions at all. Imperial rolls at PPQ on Irving still gets my #1 vote.\n\nRice rolls with pork/mushrooms: very fresh (waitress made sure we knew they made a fresh batch of these rolls around noon.) The rice noodles were soft and not too chewy. The marinated pork and mushrooms inside were very tasty and I couldn't stop munching on the left over scraps that were on the plate. This is a dish I would recommend trying out if you want a different type of appetizer to go with your entree besides imperial rolls or spring rolls.\n\nThey also had whole roasted crab on their dinner menu, which I plan on trying out next time! \n\nService here is where I had to knock off one whole star! Maybe because it's still new, they don't have a full staff for waiters/waitresses, but that night, they only had one server/waitress/hostess. She practically had to multitask all night.

How does a Vietnamese restaurant mess up rice??? It was sticky and not fully cooked... My vegetable dish with tofu was ridiculous. The tofu came in a separate plate and had no flavor! I added hot sauce to it and made it a bit better... The vegetables looked more like a soup with some tomatoes here and there and long string greens that were not cooked well at all. The soup was tasteless as well...\n\nMy bf duck dish was just as bad if not worse. The sauce looked like gelatinous, slimy, clear, slime. We couldn't even cut through the meat.

Unfortunately, my hopes were all shattered.  \n\nThe wait was excruciating.  With a long list on their whiteboard, I would think they would make every effort to turn their tables quickly.  I hate getting my check before I ask for it in a nice high end restaurant - but at a casual joint like Turtle Tower, they should be dropping those checks on the table as soon as the customer takes that last bite of banh mi or swallows that final spoonful of soup.  Not to say that they need to rush their customers but sometimes, a nudge in the right direction is just what you need.  Better for revenue, better for tips, and better for the people waiting in line.\n\nThe staff seemed confused.  If you ask for a simple change in one of their menu items, they have to check with the boss first.  That is something you can prep your staff on beforehand.  I noticed one customer ordered a small bowl of noodles, received a big bowl, was charged for the big bowl, and when he questioned it on his bill, the server looked doubtful and asked another server for help.  I thought they would adjust his bill and only charge him for a small bowl but they didn't.  That doesn't seem like a smart business decision.\n\nThe banh mi is weird and not exactly authentic.  I'm not normally concerned about the cultural authenticity of my food - as long as it tastes good.  Turtle Tower offers banh mi with butter, mayo, veggies and a choice of 3 items: pate, jambon, sausage, grilled chicken, grilled pork, and a fried egg.  But how can you offer pate and jambon for banh mi if you don't have cha lua??!!?!  It's a disgrace to the banh mi.  I'm not even going to discuss the randomness of having a sausage and fried egg option.  \n\nBtw, if you want to pay an additional $3.50 for extra chicken for your pho ga, you should know that it comes on a small condiment dish.  I also don't like how the banh mi comes in a basket.  Considering how it's a sit down lunch, shouldn't my food at least come on a regular plate?\n\nI give it one star, partly because yelp is making me do it, partly because they pour their water out of a Brita pitcher, partly because the disposable chopsticks are the good kind.", "author": "Peggy N."}

It wasn't the cleanest restaurant, but there wasn't anything that grossed us out. I am pretty tolerant of dirty places.\nAfter our last visit to this location, sadly we will never return to any of the Turtle Tower locations. We came for dinner at around 6:00 and I asked where the restroom was- they pointed to a room where I had seen a guy on a ladder. I figured it was a closet because he was putting things into cabinets, but no, that was the bathroom. When I got into the bathroom I saw that the cabinets were storage for their food containers, napkins, etc.. About two feet next to the toilet, sitting on top of a trash can was a bag of to-go sauce lids. Health code or not, I find this super gross and unhealthy. Food-related anything does not belong in the bathroom.\nMy wife had already ordered and we had a super sleepy kid with us, so I decided not to say anything to my wife and go ahead and eat.\nRegardless of the bathroom experience it was a terrible meal. I had the #1 well done brisket and beef pho. The broth was not hot- just warm and the beef was nasty looking- like somebody had chewed on it a while and spit it back.\nMy wife got the vermicelli noodles with imperial rolls and it super sucked. The imperial rolls were burnt, and the noodles were slopped onto a plate and spilling over the side  and when the waiter brought it to our table he was touching the noodles with his fingers. Gross.\nOn top of it all, mediocre service by distracted waiters.\nOne of the most depressing meals I've had in a long time.", "author": "mack h."}

You do get some jalapenos.\n- Meat is actual pieces of chicken, as opposed to the thinner shabu shabu style chicken. I liked that.\n\nOverall, this is the best chicken pho I've had in SF.

There was jar of red pepper paste which I opted to use in place of the Sriracha.  When I asked about hoisin, all was explained:  Hoisin is not an authentic condiment for Pho. The choice of toppings is northern style (basil and, I'm assuming, bean sprouts are typical of southern style).  They do have Sriracha, but the owner prefers to use the uncooked paste rather than the cooked Sriracha sauce, a personal preference but he will bring you Sriracha if you ask.\n\nSo basically, it is very tasty Pho, good quality meat, but no hoisin, basil or bean sprouts leaves me a tad torn.  \n\nI would go back since its close, cheap and good quality, but maybe with a hidden bottle of hoisin in my purse ;-)", "author": "Annette W."}

I came here at 8:15pm and there was two other table. A table of 4 that was already eating and someone that was eating by themselves.. I'm usually not a fan of eating alone but I said screw it I'll do it anyways (that's how badly I wanted a bowl of pho). The gentlemen at the counter ask me how how many and I said one he told me to take a seat anywhere so I sat down. The moment I sat down I think he for caught up with other things and forgot I was sitting there.. thought to myself really there's only two tables.. ugh no menu no water until someone else walked into the store before he realized I was still waiting for a menu.. I knew exactly what I wanted but I wanted to check out their menu so I told him to give me a min before I order in case I wanted some appetizer. Ordered the pho ga and I asked him if they have the thick noodles and he said yes and I told him I wanted the thick noodles.. when he brought me my bowl I was a little disappointed because those \"thick\" noodles isn't really the thick 'hoa fun' noodles that I expected it to be.. regardless was still looking forward to having something soupy. First bite into the noodles and I was pretty pleased with the texture but my next bite with the soup was a bit salty. I thought maybe cause it wasn't mixed correctly or something so I tossed the noodles around and just took a scoop of the broth the next bite. Omg the soup was still so salty.. I couldn't bare it. Waited for the waiter to come back and I asked him for a cup of hot water. Really heavy on the hands today with the salt.. I literally poured the whole glass of water into the bowl of soup before I could eat the noodles again.. cravings not satisfied.. I still ate all the noodles though because it tasted better after I added a whole glass of water. Walked up to the counter and ask for my check paid and left to McDonald's to get some ice cream because my mouth felt salty still.. pretty disappointed because this is my second time here but I don't remember it being this bad the first time (I haven't been back since two years ago even though I'm in the neighborhood all the time)", "author": "Lily Y."}

Although the service was \"okay\", it is also nothing to rave about. This is why:\n\n1) I don't know ANY vietnamese place that cooks pho with the wide noodles, similar to chow fun in Chinese food. So that was already turnoff number 1.\n\n2) Vietnamese hot coffee - did not come in the dripping filter that I'd expected as the full authentic experience. It came a pre-mixed glass. For $3+ coffee, I'd expect a little more. The taste was \"okay\", once again.\n\n3) AND PROBABLY THE MOST DISTURBING POINT: THIS PLACE DOES NOT HAVE HOISIN SAUCE! I don't know maybe it's my Chinese side or just my experience with multiple Vietnamese restaurants. What kind of Vietnamese restaurant that serves PHO doesn't have hoisin sauce??? And I'm not even sure the hot sauce in the container was sriracha. The worst part is that the waiter knew very well what I was talking about since he repeated it perfect in prounciation back to me, and just said \"No we do not have hoisin sauce\" WOW... really? WOW!\n\n4) Cash only - this is a bit of a minus point since most places accept credit card but it's also not too surprising. There is an ATM on-site but be prepared to pay a $2 ATM fee plus whatever your bank charges you. \n\nSo all in all. with a $7 bowl of pho + $3 \"vietnamese\" coffee + $2 ATM fee (which I understand it's kinda my fault for not carrying cash on me) + $2.50 bank fee (also my fault), my whole lunch experience with pho not really being like pho, turns out to cost about $18 with minimal (yes, MINIMAL) tip. Pretty pricey for Vietnamese food, if you ask me.\n\nNeedless to say, I will never come to this restaurant again and maybe after reading this, you won't either.

I'll be blunt: it wasn't the dish that was sold to me. Sure, the broth was balanced and the noodles were supple and well-cooked, but everything was just average. I wasn't blown away. The pho ga is good for a quick bite and a warm dish on a cold SF night, but that's about it. As for the banh mi, it was generously loaded with the meats and eggs, but almost too generously loaded. The pickled vegetables and cilantro were really afterthoughts in this sandwich, causing it to be very heavy and laden with fat. Sure, the banh mi was good, but I could barely stomach a half before calling it quits.\n\nAll in all, Turtle Tower was just another dining experience, nothing noted positively or negatively. It was just a forgettable meal, for better or worse.", "author": "Frank Y."}

For a small venue, they seemed understaffed and bit overwhelmed by an average lunchtime flow. I waited for about 20 mins to be seated even though tables were available, they couldn't clean and set with any predictability. I would recommend you NOT order the rice porridge. For all the chicken bits, skin and fat I found in the porridge none of it registered any taste or flavor. At the risk of hyperbole, it reminded me of gruel from Oliver Twist. I might suggest Turtle remove it from the menu altogether and continue to focus on the pho. The last bit of my experience was humorous, but should serve as a caveat to diners looking to order off menu and snack on imperial rolls. I asked if I could place an imperial roll order to which the cheerful waiter said okay. I didn't realize he was going to bring out a single imperial roll the size of my thumb. And needless to say, the roll came after I was done with the porridge. I asked, \"Is that all?\" Thinking surely a dog must of swiped the other imperial rolls on the way to the table. Without an iota of hesitation, he replied, \"It's what you ordered, right..? One imperial roll\" Sheepishly, I had to chuckle aloud and channel more Twist, Please Sir, I want some more.\nSomething was certainly lost in translation", "author": "Aaron Y."}

I have had Vietnamese food before and it is by far tastier. I ordered the Beef saut\u00e9ed in red wine (#17?), and what a bad choice I have made. First the meat was served in a small bowl that has \"wine sauce\", which is far from it. I think the way it cooked, is after boiling the meat, they added some red wine and cooked for couple of minutes and poured it in the bowl. Second the meat had a lot of fat on it more than the lean, it was like treasure hunt to find beef. The soup that came with the order was OK, since all of them taste the same, some made up broth (nothing special). I also tasted the Chicken Noodle soup that my friend was having, and it's the same as everywhere else, Broth, Noodles and pieces of chicken (with skin - yuk). We also ordered the Imperial Rolls and they were aaaaay, barely ok, nothing special. So save your money and look for a better Vietnamese restaurant, there are a lot of them in the SF.

They didn't even offer sprouts or basil either too.  Aren't they economical.  So I wanted to give them the benefit and thought, maybe their sandwich is good at least.

I've gone to this place 3 or 4 times since they've opened.  In the beginning, there were some opening pains with handling the crowds and the quality wasn't up to the one on Larkin St, but I went there today, and the quality was excellent.  I think it takes awhile before a new location gets its footing if it ever does.  For a restaurant that gets so much traffic, I cannot figure out why they didn't rent a larger space.  I will give the complainers that.\n\nI can tell anyone who hasn't been to Vietnam that this is indeed real Pho.  Like any food, such as pizza or gumbo, there are many variations of Pho.  Most people have only experienced the southern flavor that is more aromatic and served with a side of herbs.  TT serves the northern style, the original version.  If you go to Vietnam, the northern style is the most favored version, even in the south.  It's actually harder to make good northern style Pho, and I wouldn't say TT has achieved the goal of matching northern style Pho that I've had in Vietnam.  With southern style, the herbs and spices sometimes cover up for mediocre soup.  Having eaten at the best Pho place on the planet many times, I can honestly say TT doesn't measure up, but it's pretty good for Pho in the USA, and it's the only northern style place I know of in America.  Also, Pho Ga isn't just the Vietnamese version of the chicken noodle soup.  They've been eating it for hundreds of years.  As for the best Pho on the planet, it's a northern style place in Saigon, which I won't name since it's already too popular among the locals in Saigon.  The flavor of that Pho is so vastly different and better than any Pho I've tasted across the USA.  It's really hard to describe.\n\nAnyway, I like this location because it's in a better neighborhood and forces me to walk 6 blocks to get my meal.  A healthy tasty meal after a nice walk, how can you beat that?  I love the chicken version.  After finishing the noodles, I just sit there and sip on the soup base.  A very good meal for the winter weather.  When it comes to their other food, I have little experience.
