Instead of old timers playing bar side GM for the Giants, young handsome men in dressy button downs are drunkenly singing along to Mr.Brightside. Pretty ladies are slinging bottles with skirts and dresses short enough for the occasion. There are carry over christmas decorations to keep the holiday feelings alive, and for tonight only, a party of balloons are bobbing joyfully on the ceiling.\n\nThe alcohol pours graciously from the bar. Big shoutout to the two warriors working behind the counter. Unperturbed from the volume of work and the task of working NYE, their smiles and patience keeps the walkway of Durty Nelly's a makeshift dance floor for the inspired and the spirited.\n\nIt's 10:16pm and group selfies are evident as brief flashes are scattered here and there. Hugs and shaky hands, sips and mouth-to-ear whispers, outside pizza and outdoor smokes. No one seems to understand each other, but it's an understanding fit for tonight.\n\nThe ups and downs of 2017 are forgotten in this one last hurrah. It's a heartfelt way to ring in 2018. Foggy memories and a slight hangover are all anyone will take with them. From one degenerate to another, few experiences are more beautiful.\n\nIt's 10:25, and i'm going to call it a year for Yelp.

Yay! \n\nOn my last visit with my son (which happened to fall on Super Bowl Sunday, which I had forgotten about...!) it was understandably loud and boisterous, still I felt comfortable with my seven-year-old sidekick and we enjoyed our intimate meal in the corner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-14", "description": "Nice friendly bar with good Guinness (3/5 green stars)\nQuick review today: Durty Nelly's has perhaps one of the most welcoming storefronts (Barfronts? Facades?) that I've ever seen. Bright yellow and blue with window boxes and a red door. Sounds a bit garish but it works. We had Guinness and a few local beers (Anchor, I think, and an IPA), some garlic fries and a cheese toasty with more fries (!). Friendly barman and good atmosphere (although too many TV screens for my liking). \n\nI'm also giving them 3/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:\n* My main problem was that, while Guinness was served in a proper glass, the Anchor and IPA were served in plastic cups (with Bud Light logo). WHY?? Update from owner, Odie: it turns out that they only use plastic on their two busiest weekends (Hardly Strictly and Outside Lands). \n* The barman was helpful in explaining that the curry sauce was not vegetarian, so we ended up with the cheese toasty and fries, being almost the only veggie things on the menu. There's plenty of vegetarian food in Ireland these days, so why not serve more in an Irish bar? There's no shortage of vegetarians and vegans in SF.", "author": "James K."}

She was obviously upset about something else and taking it out on customers, unless that's just the way she always is. Horrible!\n\n*In their response to this review they are trying to say that I was mad that I got carded. Nothing like this ever happened. I'm in my thirties, I'm used to getting carded and I've never made a big deal about it. So I don't know where that comes from, unless they are mistaking me for someone else. The reality is that the lady behind the counter was just plain rude and it came out of the blue, and it had nothing to do with getting carded or anything like that. But it shows the attitude, doesn't it? Rather than apologize and offer to make amends, they accuse me of something that never happened.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-19", "description": "My first negative experience here was after work with colleagues. We sat down, ordered food and beer, and then when the food and beer came out, they asked for our IDs. At the time, we were all ladies in our mid-20s, arguably pretty young looking, so this was clearly valid and in good practice. However, when he saw our IDs, the bartender accused us all of having fakes so we offered to show him our teacher IDs and a corresponding credit card to validate our identities. He refused and said he was still going to charge us for the beer because he had already poured it, but not serve it to us. What. So we ate, tipped him on the food (why? we shouldn't have since he charged us for drinks we didn't get to drink), and left, vowing never to come back.\n\nFlash forward: I come back. Everywhere is worth a second chance, and the food *was* tasty. So my friend and I order, over the course of a night, 2 beers each and 1 mixed drinks each. We close out. The non-itemized bill is over $60.00. What? We know we didn't drink that much. We ask for an itemized, but the bartender ignores us until we put a card down. Upset that she won't show us the itemized, we tip $6 ($1 per drink, which isn't The Best, but is also somewhat standard). Two days later, I check my email and see a receipt from Square. We were charged for two extra drinks that we didn't order AND the bartender tipped herself a total of $16 (MORE than 20% on a bill that was already over-charged). \n\nTwo strikes, this bar is out. Unfortunate, considering the food is good, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the clientele are *super* friendly.\n\nUpdate: As you can see, the owner threatened me privately because I left a one star review. He made false accusations against me regarding illicit drug use and told me he would send video footage of me drinking and doing drugs to my boss to have me fired. As someone who has never used drugs recreationally, I'm not sure why he thought this was a way to get me to remove my review. \n\nI also have a picture of my receipt, written trying to get a near dead pen to work, and the picture the owner showed me does not match mine. It's unfortunate when a business can't handle a $10 dispute with professionalism. \n\nThe security footage also apparently shows my friend and I drinking \"30 glasses of water,\" which is certainly hyperbole. But yes. We did drink a lot of water because one drink should always be followed by one water. I'm sorry this was viewed as \"belligerent.\" Happy to share screenshots of the direct messages he sent to me.\n\nAlso, please do read my other reviews. I've given a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews for places in San Francisco that I would highly recommend! I even stated in this review the positives of Durty Nelly's. I won't be back, but new clientele is certainly welcome to. :)\n\nDay 29: The $10 still has not been refunded, despite claims from the owner.", "author": "Tiffany S."}

We decided to sit on the bar. The place was dimly lit which kind of bothered me at first but got used to it. There were some tables and some booths. What I liked was that there was a fireplace and they lit it during our stay.\n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered the curry fries and the durty balls.\n\nDurty balls: 4/5 - I thought these were amazing! It's mashed potatoes in a shape of a ball and deep fried. What made it taste better was the sauce that it came with. I failed to identify it, but it had a bit of a spicy taste.\n\nCurry fries: 5/5 - Their fries were amazing! With and without the curry. It had so much flavor I highly recommend getting this!\n\nI also ordered a Guinness, which was very smooth. It was a bit bitter, but smooth. As someone who prefer sweet drinks, this was totally manageable. It got worse towards the end though so I stopped drinking it.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nThe service here was average. I was going to rate this place a 3 but the food definitely compensated for it.

I'm not joking... \n\n10 years ago my now husband and I were looking for something to do in San Francisco. We had just move to the outer sunset a week before we stumbled upon this place. Our first interaction:\n\nGuy gets kicked out of the bar. Lights up a smoke and we walk in. Not 3-5 minutes later comes back in and orders a pint. We look a little puzzled but went with the flow. The guy that kicked him out said \"he just needed to cool off\". From that point we were intrigued. Not knowing it was a cash bar we ordered beers and shots. At the end of the night they said it was a cash bar and as my husband was going out to the ATM, the bartender said something we had never heard before in the history of bar hopping. \"Welcome to San Francisco your drinks are on the house\".  We had at least 3-4 shots with beers. \n\nFrom that point on we were loyal customers and going out almost every weekend, we got to know the owner and the head bartender well. There were nights that were just crazy there and then there were nights where it was a nice chill environment. \n\nThe one thing that sticks out to me the most was at the end of the night everyone sings the Irish national anthem and somewhere over the rainbow. I hope they still do this because it was an awesome tradition and one we talk about to this day. \n\nOut of all the restaurants and bars we visited this place sticks out the most with some of the best (and worst) memories.

If you read the part of the menu \"Nelly's Favourites\" you wouldn't be able to tell you weren't in Ireland or Britain enjoying a meal at your local.\n\nHowever, I came here on a friend's recommendation for the burger. I had Nelly's Burger which was fantastic, with good meat and garlic mayo and real bacon.

Firstly the real pub atmosphere extends to the restrooms (toilets), which are as disgusting as the toilets back home would be. Given I wanted to wash my hands after the burger this was unwelcome.

The crowd is mostly a weird mix of locals - mid-aged regulars, totally wasted drunks and wandering youngsters alike. But the surprising part was the music and the atmosphere. Was so fun to hear the latest club numbers playing in an Irish pub in the far Sunset! It immediately pumped everyone's spirit;  the crowd went crazy dancing on top of seats,in the floor and everywhere possible! Everyone was just having a good time. Didn't care must about what we drank as came out buzzed and rock and rolling.\n\nThe second visit was on St.Patty's Friday and hell , surprised us again! This time there was live music playing. The singer sang a good mix of popular classics to romantic numbers and song requests kept flowing all night. In between breaks were club numbers that got us dancing again! Made random friends, danced with the neighbors sitting beside and got free jagerbomb shots from the bartender, ohooo this place rocks Sunset! \n\nThis place has its own crazy nights and if you in on one such night expect a few drunks stumbling around or in their crazy acts, the jolly Irish singing aloud, locals in their dancing shoes and no one here cares about anything else!

DELICIOUS.  There was a shift change.  And in that time frame it was clear that a large local crowd was at the bar.  We felt kind of ignored for a bit and when the new bartender approached us, after having empty drinks for 20 minutes, the inquiry was \"are you guys waiting on something?\"  I don't really feel like that's how you treat a customer who's been ignored with empty glasses for 20 minutes.  Not \"can I get you another ....or get you something?\" This was the only factor that kept me from giving 5 stars.  The atmosphere is very quaint, fireplace and Irish decor.  We both ordered Fish & Chips and IT WAS AMAZING!  So as we sat there we jokingly decided that because the first bartender was a rock star and the food was so amazing that we would ignore the secondary service we received. We then ridiculously over tipped....and ta da.....everything was suddenly overwhelming friendly.  So we chatted some more....I think it was because we weren't locals or regulars...and maybe the second bartender was just taking care of the regulars....and I certainly can't blame her for that.  Either way....we both highly recommend this place for delicious food and a nice local not loud atmosphere.

The only problem I have with it? It isn't a dive.  It's actually a *very nice* pub. Management has pulled off a delicate balancing act by making the place clean and tastefully accented, and has done so without sacrificing the authentic, old-world feel that all too often winds up a casualty during a poorly executed pub re-model.\n\nA massive wood map of Ireland graces the East Wall to the rear of the bar.  Artwork that is both tasteful, elegant, and appropriate adorns the other walls.  Particularly intersting are several large scale pencil drawings in the back.  \n\nThe patrons here seem to be a pretty reserved lot.  They aren't the rowdy, hard-drinking Irish.  They aren't the bubbly, congenial ones either.  Talk amongst the patrons is quiet and civilized...foul language is rarely if ever heard. Regulars have a tendancy to sit in circles at the bar, making it difficult for strangers to slip into a conversation.  I met an Irish woman later that day that filled me in on the different cultures of Irish drinking establishments.  She told me that Durty Nelly's was \"Very Cork\".\n\nNice place.  Cute barmaids.  Authentic, tasteful decor unrivaled by any other pub in the city.  What's not to like?  While all these blessings may appeal to many, the place is a little too smooth around the edges for me.

That being said, I've always felt welcome and the bar staff is really friendly and cool.\n\nI've tried the Irish breakfast, Cheeseburger, Curry Fries, and Fish and Chips here.  All were excellent.  My two faves are the Irish Breakfast and Cheeseburger (weird, right?) tho.  The Curry Fries are awesome to share at a table.  It's that thicker brown curry over thick steak fries... yum.\n\nYou can wash it all down with a good selection of whiskeys or beer on tap.\n\nI think  Smithwicks and Cheeseburger w/ fries cost me about 13-15 dollars and was worth every penny.", "author": "Joseph H."}

I know they just tell you what you want to hear, but I am OK with that because they do it with an accent and a wink.\n\nOn to the actual review.  This is the kind of bar you can go to all day everyday  and never have to leave.  They serve food and drinks and what else besides air do you need?  Nothing.  Exactly.  So, I went with a girlfriend and we sat at the bar and ordered some Magners and fries.  We sat and talked to Rauiri (bartender) and he was fun.   Then, he got off work (we were there THAT long), and his cousin Odhran came in as the next bartender.   I lust Odie so much, but unfortunately I spotted a wedding ring after about 2 minutes.  Wedding ring means I can't take him home with me, but doesn't mean I can't be friendly and gaze at him longingly!  \n\nI am pretty sure that my friend and I were the only 2 in the bar who were not Irish.  All the people in the bar are super friendly and most are super Irish.  So many regulars come in throughout the day/evening and although I have never been to Ireland, I consider this the closest I have been.   I live in low pac heights, so it isn't exactly my neighborhood bar, but they always have parking and it is totally worth going to!\n\nGreat drinks\nGreat bartenders\nGreat prices\nGreat bartenders\nGreat fries\nGreat bartenders\nGreat regulars\nGreat bartenders\nGreat parking\nGreat bartenders\nGreat music (live, ipod, and jukebox)\nGreat fun!!!

Being the ONLY female in there I would have that a would have stock out. I ordered a burger through one the people dropping off the food because by now I had been there 15 minutes with no recognition. I ordered a bacon cheese burger med rare. 25 minutes later which I thought was strange seeing as there was no other food coming out of the kitchen so why should it takes a med rare burger to come out of the kitchen, I receive my burger. At this point I am so starving I'm beginning to start drooling of the thoughts of food. I byte into the center of my burger. Dry and well done. Oh noooooo. It's not often I send back food but over cooked beef is a deal breaker. I finally flag down the bartender who then makes me feel very uncomfortable and not welcome.  But I understand how she might value her male customers but I am a paying customer. Showed her the over cooked burger. She then responds condescendingly \"so do you want him to make u another one\". I have been serving/ bartending for the pat 10 years. And u shouldn't make your customer feel uncomfortable or judged because my burger is over cooked. I say yes but ask if I can keep my fries because at this point I wanna grab a snack box from quicklys while I wait another 25 min for my refired burger.  She just gives me a look and then takes the whole plate, fries and all  about 15 min later the chef comes out and asks what was wrong with the burger.....WHAT?! you havent even started making it yet?  how difficult is it to get a well-cooked burger around here?!  i then ask him as i hear my stomach start to growl if he would bring me back the fries, which he did, which were now cold and gross.  The burger came out about 15 min later and was cooked correctly.  This whole time i have not been offered a water or other beverage.  The only time the bartender came over was to hand me my check and rushed me to pay her,  i was int he middle of put the money on the bar when she scoops it up when i hadnt even paid in full  I dont remember the last time i felt so unwelcome and offended by someone that works in a restaurant, i mean this is my industry, these are my people, but not this place  i will not return", "author": "Lizz M."}

In some ways, Durty Nelly's is a more than decent Irish pub. The building is cute, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the bathroom isn't disgusting. But something weird happened when I was there. The music switched from cheesy 80s (which I like) to country-ish. Everyone spontaneously got up and began pseudo-square dancing at a frenetic pace. It was as if everyone was vying to be the craziest, quirkiest dancer. I really didn't understand. Is this what always happens at Durty Nelly's on a Friday night?

As a kid I loved the opportunity to go to Shannon airport to pick up or drop off a relative or friend. Not because I like airports you eejit, but because it meant we could go to Durty Nelly's six miles outside the airport. What a great place to eat and drink.\n\nLo and behold when I heard of an Irish bar in SF of the same name, sure I had to go and check it out. What a treat to find such a warm, welcoming little pub in our often too hectic city.  I have been to just about all the Irish pubs here and none compare to Durty Nelly's.  While I can find something positive to say about all the other places, only Durty Nelly's can transport me home for a brief respite. \n\nI don't say that lightly, and to be honest I would rather be there now than writing this stupid review.  I went to the pub last month and returned there tonight.  The barman, Brandon is quite the Irishman and a great character. He was attentive, funny and professional.  It is quite obvious he loves his job and that is one of the most important factors in having a successful business.  He was running around doing a hundred things at once, all of it seamlessly. Kudos to you sir.  \n\nBut wait, there is more..........\n\n....... Bacon and Cabbage!      Thank you Jesus for Daniel and his culinary talents.  I don't mean the corned beef garbage often passed of as bacon and cabbage here in the U.S.    I mean real cured back bacon just like my mother made every Saturday for dinner in Listowel, while we all waiting for dad to come up from the pub.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you Daniel for going to all the trouble of curing the bacon and offering it on the menu as a special. What a nice guy to talk to as well.  \n\nYou should call to see when it is being served next, and then go get a nice piece of bacon and a real taste of Ireland at Durty Nelly's.  My friends ate the fish & chips & BLT, they loved their meals and said they would order them again. The menu is short and sweet, just perfect. We had a great time here again.\n\nI am not going to describe the interior, furnishings, fireplace and all the other trimmings because they are unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  Anybody who knows Ireland or an Irish person will understand that it is the people who make a place and you will find the spirit of our great country right here in this little pub.\n\nSo if you are looking for a real Irish bar with real Irish food head over to Durty Nelly's. If you are looking for a fake, glossed over, stage version of an Irish bar then go downtown SF or perhaps back to the Marina.    \nGo raibh  maith agat!", "author": "Cheeky Monkey A."}

It is, in no way, about how my parents thought it a good idea to send their kid off to learn to shoot guns in order to have some peace and quiet every summer. No it is about band camp. No, wait, it is about Durty Nelly's......but whatever! \n\nThough church camp would appear to be the logical first choice for worst experience, it comes in second to band camp. The reason being the people I was surrounded by, who relentlessly teased me for \"being where I don't belong\" and actually going to a camp to play flute, when clearly I had no fucking idea what I was doing. As if this was my choice. I should have brought my violin....but I hadn't started playing it yet, so I guess that would have been just as bad. \n\nWe had a camp counselor who was a drunk, who would sneak out of our tent at night to drink with the boy counselors, and who had a general disdain for us campers. Since my fellow campers had a general disdain for me as well, it was a fun summer all around. Which brings me to the clientele at Durty Nelly's.\n\nLast time I was here (interject useful part of review) at this somewhat run down, dark wood, occasional DJ in the corner, average priced, Guinness and Magners heavy, often crowded bar with some booth seating, I heard someone talking about the awful time she had as a camp counselor. She was drunk, she was surrounded by boys. She reminded me of my counselor. Had she been 10 years older, and not Irish, I would have thought she was my counselor back in 82, or whenever it was I was subjected to the hell of band camp. She may have been my counselors younger Irish sister...maybe.\n\nIn addition, I am pretty sure that my fellow campers at \"Camp Nelly's\" had the same disdain for me as my former camp pals. I assume this because they made comments to the effect of me \"being where I don't belong\". This time it wasn't about my lack of musical talent though, it was about my being American. Strange, I thought California was in America. But, I also thought it was okay to try to learn an instrument at band camp. What do I know!!!??", "author": "Drue C."}

They did still have curry sauced fries available, and these were just fantastic.  \n\nAs an Irish bar, my biggest disappointment was that there was no Middleton, a whiskey some would say is the best that Ireland has to offer.  They did have some Scottish whiskeys available, but not Talisker or Cardhu or Craggenmore or Oban.  Oh well.  \n\nThe bar is fairly small, but has a great vibe, and Brandon and the other bartenders were exceptionally attentive and fast until the final invasion crew doubled the number of folks in the bar.\n\nIt may be against some sort of city code, but a few chairs and tiny coffee tables would have been a nice touch, especially to get out of the sardine crowd in the bar for a bit.  But it was all good.\n\nWill I be back again?  Definitely.  But since I won't be back often because of the distance, it's hard to give a perfect score.

Shaun pushes her hard and she gets impaled on a steel pole, but then she gets up and starts walking towards them again, while Shaun and Ed stare at her wide-eyed.  \n\nThat's what the drunk people are like at Durty Nelly's.  It's absolutely hilarious to watch.  I saw two people nearly pass out, and then five minutes later they were ordering another drink.  Incredible!   One girl saved herself from hitting the floor by holding on to my purse.  I couldn't move, and she didn't move for about 10 minutes until her friend grabbed her by her waist and propped her up on a stool.  Time for another pint!\n\nThe bartenders here are excellent - I have never seen drinks poured this well or this fast.  They are working so hard, there is no time to clear the bottles - it's like that game \"100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall\" but they are on the tables and bar.  The bouncers have their hands full with the  people who do cross the line (but some of them make their way back in...just like those zombies, you can't keep 'em down!).  Really, though, everyone here is just fun-loving and harmless and there to have a good time.\n\nAt one point, some folks were standing on one of the tables, and the bartender just threw a towel at them to tell them to get down.  It was awesome - like disciplining animals.  And it reminded me of this scene, where Shaun and Ed are throwing old albums at the zombies:\n\nEd: \"Purple Rain\"?\nShaun: No.\nEd: \"Sign o' the Times\"?\nShaun: Definitely not.\nEd: The \"Batman\" soundtrack?\nShaun: Throw it. \n\nWell, unlike our heroes in the film, we were bitten and soon participating in the rowdiness all around us.  There is nothing more fun than an entire bar singing along to a live rendition of \"Dirty Old Town\".  Young and old, male and female, arms around each other and singing their hearts out, present company included.\n\nOhhh, that was fun.  But through the mayhem, I also recognize a great bar when I find it, and I  will definitely be back during a more quiet time to enjoy a creamy Guinness and some pub grub.  \n\nI'll leave you with this bit of wisdom:\n\nShaun: As Bertrand Russell once said, \"The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.\" I think we can all appreciate the relevance of that now.\nLiz: Was that on a beer mat?\nShaun: Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.\nLiz: I won't say anything.\nShaun: Thanks\n\nIf the world is ending, I am going to make a beeline for Durty Nelly's.

I'm not sure if that's true, but I could believe it. The problem is, almost every Irish pub in SF is a caricature of an Irish pub. Sure, they have the Guinness, and sometime the Harp and Smithwicks, and sometimes the right whiskeys. But most pubs in this town are so kitschy and outwardly glowing about their \"Irishness\" that I just can't take it anymore.\n\nThat's where Durty Nelly's comes in. THIS is the trust, most justifiable and most honest Irish pub I've seen, not only in SF, but anywhere in this country. THIS is what an Irish pub is. This is how an Irish pub should act and function.\n\nNow, on this street, which is 95% asian businesses, you wouldn't expect this. But I'm fairly certain Durty Nelly's predates those establishments and remains a fixture of old San Francisco. The neighborhood is not conducive to pub crawling, drinking, or even fine dining. I would never come out here if it wasn't for this place. But, it's worth the trip and it's worth the struggle for parking.\n\nSo what's the big deal? Durty Nelly's has every element that is required of a true Irish pub.\n- Owned and operated by actual Irish people\n- Frequented by actual Irish regulars\n- Proud of Ireland but not in a brash or \"St Patty's Day\" kind of way\n- They have Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's, and a Cider on tap\n- They pour your Guinness properly, giving it the 120 seconds it deserves\n- They serve everything else \"Irish style\" such as serving a glass with ice along with your cider (this is one tradition I did now know prior to visiting)\n- Customers mingle with each other and buy each other drinks...regularly\n- They have musicians sitting in the corner, by the fireplace, playing music (some Irish, some U2-type pop)\n- They serve everyone with an equal amount of general interest and disinterest\n- They serve Irish pub food, which I've heard (but haven't confirmed) is pretty good.\n\nAgain, THIS is what you want from a quality Irish pub.

The kitchen is basic but satisfying, but be aware that the portions of some items are not going to be \"steakhouse sized.\" Personally, the Irish Breakfast as well as the fish & chips are my favorites.\n\nThe jukebox is something that KFOG, 107.7 The Bone or Alice@97.3 radio would be fine playing, plus some folk and other mixes, in addition to the staff's ipod. The crowd gets a bit mixed later on the night, but there is a mix of clientele that usually ranges from the late 20s to the 40s.\n\nThis is place that I go to in order to meet up with friends, to have a quiet pint, or a leisurely early-evening dinner.

One of them was swinging around what looked like an ornate metal door handle he'd torn off something which let's face it is kind of awesome. But on the other hand the people were a little too crazy for me and there were like three girls in the bar out of like six total girls that were obviously drunk and being passed around and manhandled amongst all the guys which is frankly kind of gross. I think I'll give it a middling three stars.", "author": "Cathy T."}

Maybe I am a little bit biased since I know most of the bartenders (well, all of them actually) and get awesome treatment while there. I stopped going for awhile after moving to the east coast, but what I love about this place is that you can go back after 4 years of being away and all of the regulars remember you, and welcome you back with open arms! I also love trivia night, their food (steak sandwich, fries, everything!) and best of all the bartenders and the Irish lads and lassies (and non-Irish people too!) perched on stools, dancing on the booths, or just sharing intimate chats in the booths as the fire place glows in the background. Ahhh, there is no place like a bar that feels like your living room.", "author": "Catherine C."}

The burgers and Irish breakfast are satisfying. Chicken sandwich was bland, don't bother. Obviously you're here to drink though, and they do their alcohol and beer well. There's usually a fun crowd, and if not you can entertain yourself listening to U2 and people's Irish accents. Definitely worth checking out.", "author": "Jasmine O."}

The location is perfect for me (as I live down the street) so I can't complain.\n\nThe food here is no ordinary bar food.  It's actually the best American food around.  The burgers are crazy good -- throw an egg on top for a good treat.  The steak sandwiches are actually made with steak.  The curry fries give you a unique lunch.  The fish and chips are crispy and to die for.  Everything comes with \"chips\", which I guess are just really tasty and fresh french fries.  As a bonus, everything's cheap.  If anything, the food is a bit of a downside because it's so good, people are bringing their families here.  You will usually find 2 or 3 kids running around this place around dinnertime.  :(\n\nThe service is totally spot on.  The bartenders quickly make you a regular and have your next drink ready before you can ask.  The prices are totally reasonable for the city and are lower than more populated areas.  The owner is an awesome dude known to buy rounds for the regulars.\n\nInside there are enough booths that you can usually get one.  It turns into a club type place on the weekends, but I prefer to come here in the middle of the week (if not the middle of the day.)\n\nDurty Nelly's -- the Cheers of the Sunset.", "author": "Dean A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-09", "description": "Nelly's is an enduring element of the Sunset around Cal 1.  Yes it is an Irish bar, for better or worse, however it is a great place to have lunch or a late dinner.  The food is better than most pub fare in San Francisco.  The chicken sandwich, in particular, is phenomenal (yes, in terms of pub fare).  Late nights can be a bit iffy, especially if the lads who frequent the establisment are hot-blooded; still, it's always interesting to hear the songs they sing at 2am.\n\nDurty Nelly's has both beers on tap and bottled beer, they also have an extensive bar.  One has the impression, however, that much of the hard alcohol has been sitting untouched for years; well, the alcohol that isn't whiskey anyway.  The clientele are VERY Irish, and the bartenders reflect this.  There is live (cover) music most weekends; the choice of music reflects the Irish clientele.\n\nThe bar is packed on weekends, and it is a local gathering place for the Sunset Irish.  On weekdays it is rather less busy, and a good place to grab some grub if you have time for lunch.  The kitchen closes rather early but given the crowds at night it is completely understandable.\n\nIn all, a great place to have a pub-style lunch during the week and a must for anyone who wants to get a taste of the Sunset Irish culture.  Weekends in particular have a good crowd, full of songs and great stories but relaxed and safe, as far as San Francisco Irish pubs go.", "author": "John B."}

Plenty of curry sauce, lots of moist, white meat chicken on a mountain of fries make this a winner. Not the most complex curry, but very very tasty bar food. I liked that an older couple (in their 70s maybe) came for a few beers and appeared to be regulars. I wasn't expecting the music though!

They pour a perfect Guinness.  I had the Shepard's Pie and loved it.  My buddy had the burger w/ cheddar and said it was \"better than Polker's\", which means pretty solid.  The atmosphere of the bar is awesome -- I think the fireplace really adds a lot.  Granted, I was there on a Sunday night, but the clientele was not a real selling point -- a little older, but that shouldn't be too surprising given the neighborhood.  Also, while the girls they hired to greet were pretty, I found the whole putting green beads around my neck a little annoying.  It was Sunday night, not Mardi Gras.", "author": "Luke P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-09", "description": "came here this past Wednesday night. my brother suggested durty nelly's as he needed a drink after a long day at work. when we arrived, there wasn't anywhere for everyone to sit ( our party consisted of 3 guys, 2 girls). we saw an open table for 6 except there was a backpack on the far end of the bench so we thought someone may be sitting there so we waited for someone to sit there, no one showed. so, i sat down at the very far end, upon doing so, this woman who was drinking at the bar turned around, saw that we were about to sit down and, raced to sit at the table. she grabbed some coasters from the bar and meticulously laid them out, showing us that she was waiting for her party to show up (?) i got up and  we all sat at some loose small bar tables, ordered some drinks and finally another table opened up. during the entire time we dined, this lady's party (at the biggest table in the place) NEVER SHOWED UP! WTF. oh well, it was really more funny than anything.  so once we sat down, we ordered our food. the only veggie option on the menu was a grilled cheese sandwich, so that is what I ordered. my bf ordered the Grilled Ham and Cheese and the rest of the table ordered the following: NY Strip Steak (which was well received), Shepherd's Pie, and Fish and Chips (which got rave reviews about how amazingly moist it was) and they all ordered salads (which all 3 didn't have enough dressing). I ordered a snakebite and a guiness, boyfriend a couple ciders, the rest of the table ordered a bombay Sapphire martini (up), a couple smithwicks and another 2 Guinness's. after we were all full and happy, we got the bill which was over $100 (but not too bad for 5 ppl. and drink orders). We decided to put it all on one card and upon paying the bartender was very snippy and said that they only accept cash. 2 ppl. in our party ran out to the bank, we payed the bill and left. Overall it was good food in a nice small locals bar atmosphere with some excellent food and beers, but you have to  get there in time to procure and table and bring plenty of cash. so, because there was no apparent sign age stating that they did not accept cards, i give this a lower rating.", "author": "Robin H."}
