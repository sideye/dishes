I usually arrive as they're closing or forget cash but today I made it and im glad I did. I ordered the \nPan con chicharron sandwich combo meal.\n\nThe sandwich was really good. Quality bun that didnt fall apart topped with alot of tender juicy lime and rocoto sauce sliced pork with onion and fried yam. I had to get an inca cola for my drink and the side of sweet potato fries were good but id have prefered if the more traditional yucca fries were still on the menu.\n\nGood food but being a food cart make sure you check the location on the website, find nearby seating, and bring cash.", "author": "Sean G."}

I know their prices have gone-up a bit, but you get a solid meal that packs a lot of flavor.  The Lomo Saltado is tender cuts of NY Sirloin, with tomato, onion, cilantro and soy sauce.  Plus they top if off with french fries and cream de rococo sauce.  It's my fave sandwich, it's well seasoned and always cooked just right.  Plus, they use an artisan roll on their sandwiches, which is also a nice touch.  \n\nFor you pork fans, feel free to try their Barbacoa, which is their BBQ pulled pork.  If you like pork loin, go with the Pan con Chircharron, which has amazing flavor.  \n\nI know they have bowls too, but I always opt for their sammies.  They can get a bit messy, but your taste buds won't be disappointed.  For their sides, try their sweet potato fries.\n\nService is friendly and fast on this truck.", "author": "Lon H."}

At the peak lunch hour there was a line about 3 deep. As this was my first time I was taking a little too long to decide on what to order, which did not go down too well with the impatient server manning the register so she prodded me on. I decided to get the special of the day which was Peruvian style chicken curry with rice and decided to add a fried egg to it bringing my total to $14 with tax.\n\nMy order was ready as soon as it was placed and I was on my way. I got a small container which had about a scoop of rice on the right and about a ladle of chicken curry on the left. There was a small amount of Peruvian style lime picked onions and a blob that filled in for a fried egg. Taste wise the chicken curry had an overwhelming taste of raw peanuts. There were a couple of pieces of what seemed to be boiled chicken that were folded into the peanut based sauce. In addition, it was extremely salty. The rice was of decent quality and was cooked right. The fried egg was a cold hard blob that was probably fried earlier in the day and then frozen before being served. The best part of the dish was the pickled onions. Overall this was a poor excuse of a dish.\n\nPrice-wise, it was not too high considering FiDi and food truck (which itself adds a couple of bucks to the price) but it was not worth the food that I got. Goes without saying, I did not like it at all and have no intention of returning.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

This truck serves the obligatory Lomo Saltado over rice (traditional) or on a sandwich bun (not-so-traditional).  Pretty solid quality for a food truck, though I'll take a hole-in-the-wall Peruvian restaurant any day.\n\nLomo Saltado Bowl: Good flavors and tender meat, but a tad dry.  I suppose that's somewhat understandable because their primary usage is to put this on a sandwich, but it'd be nice if there was an excess of that soy-based stir fry sauce to soak into the rice.  Somewhat related, I would have preferred if the fries were stir fried with everything else so they soak up some more flavoring and soften a bit.  But the creamy sauce on everything was very nice and helped moisten things.  I kinda respected their choice to use the New York Strip cut over the Tenderloin to keep prices reasonable.  I mean, this is a food truck, not a trip to La Mar.\n\nPlatano Frito: These are ripened plantains, maduros.  Sticky and crunchy.  Kinda like a dessert, except for the bits of salty cheese chunks.  Works as a pairing though.", "author": "Adam B."}

I ordered the Lomo Saltado sandwich for $10, plus a fried egg on top for an extra dollar. I don't know how authentic it was to Peruvian cuisine, but nonetheless it was delicious! The protein was a stir-fried NY strip sirloin and then there were also fries, a delicious white cream sauce, onions, and cilantro, all on a French roll. Wow, what a blend of flavors and textures! The meat was wonderfully cooked and juicy and the fries added a bit of crunch and substance to the sandwich. Onions were well-marinated and between the onions and soy sauce, neither overdid their flavor contributions. \n\nHowever, the fried egg on top was somewhat of a disappointment. I wouldn't get it again, nor would I recommend this addition. The egg was entirely cooked, so the yolk was completely solid. It would have been fantastic if the yolk was still fluid, leaving it to drip and add a little additional wetness to the rest of the sandwich.\n\nAnyway, for $11 this was a pretty good sandwich. If it were close by I'd go here again, but not before trying other nearby options. Next time, no fried egg though!", "author": "John B."}

Well, other than Halal Cart and NY's Halal Guys, but those aren't really food trucks (more like food carts...).  I guess that's what happens now that I've found a set of trucks that I like (and fallen hopelessly behind on reviews).  Then again, it's not like I've written reviews for favorites like The Chairman.  BTW, did I mention that I'm hopelessly behind?\n\nThe first time I ever saw Sanguch\u00f3n, I was quite excited to eventually check them out.  OTG used to be somewhat lacking in variety (even I can only take so many types of Asian tacos), so seeing a Peruvian food truck was pretty refreshing.  Especially after learning it's a sister eatery to Piqueo, which is a favorite of one of my friends.\n\nAlthough I had planned on trying the Lomo Saltado sandwich, I caved to my love of pork and audibled to the PAN CON CHICHARRON - Sliced Pork Loin with Fried Yams, Lime Juce marinated Onions, and Cream de Rocoto ($9).  The taste as a whole wasn't bad (I liked the tartness/acidity of the onions), and the yams were okay, but the meat needed some help.  Fat obviously isn't good for you, but it certainly would have added some flavor and juiciness to the lean (and dry) pork loin.\n\nDespite being underwhelmed by my sandwich, Sanguch\u00f3n deserves some points for their sizable portions.  While food trucks in general have a reputation of being overpriced for what you get, the sandwiches are a decent value (taste aside).  In fact, I ended up only eating about half of my sandwich and bringing home the rest (which actually tasted better when I reheated it the next day).\n\nGiven their generally favorable reviews and their connection to Piqueo, I wonder if I just came on a bad day.  It's also possible I just ordered the wrong thing, as my friend seemed to enjoy the Lomo Saltado I shoudl have ordered.  Perhaps that's the way to go, though I'd be lying if I said making a point of finding out was high on my list.", "author": "Mike L."}

Every time the food is consistently amazing. \n2. The thought of lomo saltado in a sandwich struck me as genius! They are the first ones I've ever heard of putting this awesome Peruvian dish in a sando. Also, their bread is on point and made exclusively for them and the quality of the meat is really up there. Practically melts in ur mouth and joins hands with all the other flavors going on (which btw, includes French fries, soy sauce, the rocoto sauce, and veggies). This sandwich Can hold its own with any fancy sit down restaurant sandwich. It's really that good! I also really appreciate that they have a bowl, because although the sandwich is absolutely 100% the way to go, the healthily inclined can still get in on the action. I did once but I missed the bread. \n3. That rocoto sauce is money. And goes especially well with the sweet potato fries you should be getting a side with your lomo saltado sando. \n4. Passion fruit juice and Inca Kola and chicha morada (definitely try the chicha at least once. It's made from purple corn and it's awesome) aren't necessarily things you can find anywhere. They are all perfect for washing down that lomo saltado sandwich and sweet potato fries. \n\nAlthough they don't park necessarily close to my office I have no problem taking the walk out to wherever they may be. The trucks schedule is posted online and has always been accurate. \n\nIn sum, get you a lomo saltado combo, with sweet potato fries and a chicha morada or maracuya ( passion fruit).", "author": "Thielson D."}

I try popular, well-know vendors with long lines and over-hyped food items (ie: Senor Sisig, Curry Up Now). But what particularly drew me into Sanguch\u00f3n Peruvian Food Truck was their (new) adorable pig logo! The original logo was a silhouette of a realistic-looking pig. But the new one is a cute, chubby, cartoon-like pig with a chef hat.\n\nBut carrying on...\n\nSanguch\u00f3n's food is delicious and very satisfying for a food truck. They offer sandwiches, wraps, and a few sides. I'm not a big fan of wraps, so I've only tried their sandwiches. The Pan con Chicharron has pork loin, fried yams, marinated onions, and aji rocoto aioli. There was a generous portion of tender pork loin, the yam added a mild sweetness, the onions were strong, and the aioli was creamy and good, a little peppery without being spicy. I wished there were more sauce though, because I found the sandwich to be overall a bit dry. The bread has a slightly crunchy exterior and soft inside. The Barbacoa has pulled BBQ pork, with coleslaw and potato chips. A generous portion of meat satisfied my quickly, but I was disappointed with the inconsistency. Some pieces of pork were tender, and some were very tough and chewy. The coleslaw and chips and cabbage added some nice crunch though.\n\nThey offer sandwich combo meals (sandwich + sweet potato fries) for $10. The sweet potato fries weren't anything too special. I wouldn't order them on their own, nor would I order them in a combo meal again. I'll save myself the $2. Yucca fries seemed to be a popular side item, but I didn't enjoy them. Some pieces were undercooked and almost crunchy in the middle. They were a little bland without the dipping sauce. Overall, these fries reminded me of why I hate thick-cut fried potatoes: there's just too much starch.\n\nIf you have the rare, secondary dessert-only stomach, try the alfajores. Sandwiched between two crumbly shortbread cookies is a luscious, creamy, and smooth dulce de leche filling. $5 for two of these cookies is steep, but it's worth the price tag because they're so good! I wished they were packaged differently though; upon opening, it gets messy because the powdered sugar spills everywhere.\n\nSanguch\u00f3n specializes in sandwiches and a few snacks, so overall the menu isn't very extensive.

Kind of took me back to my childhood days of having potato chip Sandwiches. The Pork was quite sweet and worked very well with the Slaw but was incredibly messy, I suggest bringing extra tissues with you when you visit this truck because you will probably need them.\n\nI also really wanted to try the Alfajores (Cookies filled with Dulce de Leche) but they had ran out really early into service. Noooo! Sad Emmalou. Maybe next time.\n\nThe lady taking orders was very nice and they worked through the vast amount of orders quickly and with ease. Can't wait to try more.\n\n* Update August 2012 *\nI've returned to Sanguchon a few more times now and just as impressed as I was the first time around! I've also now tried the Alfajores (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/40V85s2E2nJdcoNLVl7eKQ?select=yu4CIaIF7-fCJst_46yxKg#isjW3WJzsQpNIBkkFYI2lg) Flaky, buttery biscuits filled with smooth Dulce de Leche and dusted with a huge amount of powdered sugar. Delicious! The only thing I wasn't so keen on was the amount of sugar on top, I had to scrape most of it off as it was just too much for me but best food truck cookie so far!", "author": "Emmalouise B."}

All I can tell you is that the Chicharron sandwich, while being Peruano, tastes like a carnitas burrito, sans tortilla. Or, a torta, sans avocado. Their buns are, where do they have these specially made? They're very Vietnamese baguette textured. They're light, but substantial enough to hold all of that satisfying porky deliciousness. They have enough crevices to let the beautiful Peruvian aji rocoto, resembling a bell pepper, turned into an aioli, seep into them. Let's not forget the lime marinated onions and cilantro. It just wouldn't be the same without the onions. However, those fried yams basically could have not been there. They didn't provide anything extra, and they were flacid. Yo, Sanguchon, 86 the yams unless they're crispy.\n\nThen, they have yucca fries and yucca balls. Look, white people, I love you. But, it's not pronounced yuh-ka, it's you-ka. Don't let Alton Brown and those other babblin' blanquitos on the food channels make you feel self-conscious about saying it the proper way. I hesitated on the yucca ball special, due to my adversity with olives, so by living vicariously through my dining companion that bought them, there wasn't much of an insurance risk. Low and behold, they surprised me, for two reasons.\n\nI was surprised that they weren't as crunchy as I expected them to be, so that satisfying crunch thing wasn't happening. But, they had that wonderful earthy, nutty flavor that yucca is supposed to have when cooked properly. I was also surprised that the olives are basically non-existent. Instead, you have a well-balanced, hyper-flavorful filling with Spanish chorizo and raisins. If they were only crunchier, these things have the possibility of being extremely addictive. And no one wants to see a gorda pacing on Park Street trying to hook herself out for yucca balls.\n\nNo one.", "author": "Illyanna M."}

Before heading out to OFG, I already lowered my expectations because I was going towards the end of the event. It was about 1:20 and OTG ends at 2pm. Despite scaling down my hopes, I was still shocked at the poor quality of food. I ordered the Pan con Chicharron sandwich combo with sweet potato fries ($10). I literally received my food right after signing my receipt. I get it, not all food trucks prepare their food on the spot when the customer orders. But can't you at least try to give the impression that you do? My sandwich was cold and my sweet potato fries...well they were the worst sweet potato fries I've ever eaten in my life. They weren't even worthy of being called fries because they were basically flimsy and soggy strips of sweet potatoes. \n\nI was suspicious when the young lady handed me the container because it wasn't warm. I flipped open the lid and disappointment immediately drowned any excitement I had for my meal. The fries looked like a limp pile of orange sticks. They were cold and not crispy at all. A soggy fry is a sad fry. And this made me sad. \n\nFine, I'll suck it up because the sandwich looked promising. The Pan con Chicharron consists of chunks of pork loin, fried yams, and marinated onions sandwiched between two pieces of French bread. A zesty aioli sauce welds all of the ingredients together. It was actually pretty tasty and Sanguchon does not skimp on the meat. However, my sandwich was cold. Everything was cold: the buns, pork, yams, sauce. EVERYTHING. The pork loin wasn't roasted around the edges or moist in the middle. The French bread was hard and stale, zero crunch when you bite into it. The sandwich would have been excellent if it was served hot and fresh.\n\nSanguchon probably wanted to avoid running their fryers or stoves after the big lunch rush in order to conserve energy and money. But seriously? That is no excuse to sell crappy food. It wasn't 10 minutes before closing, there was still 40 minutes left! Maybe Sanguchon could have at least microwaved my food (as gross as that sounds). I'm extremely disappointed that this business would serve cold food that was pre-made and sitting around for God knows how long.", "author": "Judy H."}

Anyways, onto the review:\n\nPan con Chicharron, $8 (Pork loin slivered, fried yams, marinated onions & aji rocoto aioli): very filling and carby because the bread is thick, which makes it a little difficult to eat.  The pork/onions/aioli isn't bad, but overall the flavors just don't really come together to make an amazing sandwich.\n\nSweet Potato Fries , $4 (Sweet potato fries with sweet rocoto sauce): pretty standard sweet potato fries, probably frozen seeing how homogenously perfect they were.\n\nI got the combo for ~$10 because I wanted to try more food, but it's probably not recommended because it's so filling.  Enough carbs and sodium for a week :( :)\n\nSorry, no photos!  With Off the Grid, it's just too difficult because you need to hold your food, and the bright sunlight makes it nearly impossible to see your phone screen.

There's no sensible way to hold it without having chunks of pork fall out the bottom. It definitely made a good first impression before tasting it. Unfortunately, the pork was super over-fried. The outside was crispy, but the rest of the meat was very dry, sinewy, and bland. I could feel all those little muscle fibers nudging in between my teeth, and I knew I was in for a vigorous flossing session later that night. The pork wasn't seasoned very well and didn't really have any strong flavor. \n\nI think they relied only on the aioli and onions to provide flavor to the sandwich. The aioli had a good acidity and complimented the marinated onions well. However, those flavors didn't penetrate into the pork, and the overall flavor with everything mixed together ended up bland. On the plus side, it did provide enough energy to dance the rest of the night away.", "author": "Nei N."}

I JUST had Peruvian for the first time the day before and loved it.  So I was stoked to see this truck at Edgewood Eats.  The lines were crazy long, but it was worth it.\n\nWe had the Lomo Saltado (steak sandwich) and it was super flavorful.  I LOVED the bread they served it on because it was hearty enough to take on the steak without being overwhelmed, but at the same time it was soft and tasty.  I will definitely order this one again.\n\nWe also tried the Pan con Chicharron.  I am a huge fan of chicharron.  I also loved how this sandwich came with yucca which is a great compliment to chicharron.  However, my problem with this sandwich is that the huge cuts of chicharron didn't really lend itself to eating it sandwich style.  I wish they would've chopped it up a bit, maybe even did it pulled pork style.

I ordered the Pan con Chicharron, a pork tenderloin sandwich with fried yams, onions, and a spicy mayo on a homemade roll. \n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with my sandwich. The pork was plentiful and was appropriately seasoned & spiced; you can tell it was slow cooked! The mayo had just enough kick, and the onions gave the sandwich a little sweet complement. I had a hard time tasting the yams bite per bite but liked their contribution to the sandwich's texture. The style of roll reminded me of a dutch crunch, which, according to my preferences, I'm not a fan of. However, I think Sanguch\u00f3n's effort to present something homemade and authentic is admirable. It might require a couple tweaks (i.e. caramelizing the onions or adding bell pepper), but the pan con chicharron is a good sandwich and one I'd order again. \n\nMy sandwich was $8, which is appropriate given the preparation of the meat, the homemade roll, portion, etc. It was an innovative combination -- or at least one Americans don't think of (I like my yams with turkey and gravy on sourdough!). Sanguch\u00f3n has some other delicious items on their menu, from varieties of fries, to homemade drinks, to pulled pork sandwiches. With many trucks offering their own take on a similar type of cuisine (i.e. there are many Korean trucks, taco trucks, sandwich trucks, etc.), I think Sanguch\u00f3n offers something unique and more exotic to our California taste buds.

You can't really mess up on fried yucca...but this place made them in a way that just hit the spot.  Perhaps I was just super hungry, but they were perfectly fried, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside! Yum!  The lomo saltado sandwich was pretty tasty as well... the meat was tender, but I think what made the sandwich mouth watering was the sauce they used.

I found Sanguchon at Off the Grid: Upper Haight. They had 4 types of Peruvian sandwiches served on French bread (lomo saltado, pollo ala brasa, barbacoa, pan con chicharron), 2 wraps, sides, drinks and some daily specials, including empanadas. I didn't know what some of the drinks were (and the menu didn't provide a description) but they sounded Peruvian. \n\n* Pan con chicarron ($8): Porktastic as some would say...massive chunks of lightly spiced luscious, tender pork...there was so much pork that I had to take some out to bite down on the sandwich. I liked how the slices of fried yam added some sweet creaminess. \n\nThe bread is a warm, round white French roll (so the sandwich resembles a hamburger). The bottom of the roll was really hard and it fell apart a bit but it was still a good roll. The bread is made for Sanguchon. \n\nThe sandwich was a bit too tall but I was happy with the filling to bread ratio, the crunch of the pickled onions and the creamy aioli. I think it would be even better with sauce on the side (something spicy and/or full of fresh herbs).", "author": "Lolia S."}

It has LOTS of chunks of pork meat; little fat, but enough to give good flavor.  \n\n2.  Loma Saltado - Stir fried New Yoirk steak with tomato, onion, cilantro, - soy sauce and fries (yes, fries).

Saguchon's line was moving the fastest so I hopped on their line. I wanted my bang for my buck in terms of dollar to calorie. The Lomo Saltado sandwich seemed to accomplish this, \"Stir fried New York steak with tomato, onion, cilantro soy sauce & fries.\"\n\nThis sandwich is great! I thought about going back to the truck and buying another sandwich for later. The Lomo Saltado is one of those great sandwiches that you can have with a beer, after partying, or if you're just really hungry. The bread is especially made for the sandwiches and it shows. It's so fresh, pillowy, and it has a delightful outer crust. The big chunks of beef combined with the carboliciousness of fries and veggies is delectable. I've never seen this food truck before but if I see them again I'll be pleased to jump on line again.\n\n_____\n\nNot the most elegant of sandwiches, but it satisfies mad hunger.", "author": "Michael H."}

No veggies & no sauce. I did ask for no onions but it was lacking some acid maybe a slaw. Overall first time experience was disappointing. \n\nI decided to give it another chance.  This time I got the Lomo Saltado. Here's a tip for you- When you read the description it sounds like you are getting fries on the side. Actually, the fries are in the sandwich (like 4 pieces). So, don't get all excited and think you're getting a sandwich and fries for $8! \n\nThe Lomo Saltado had tender steak, peppers, onions, tomato all tossed in a lime sauce. The sauce really helped to soften the otherwise hard bread. The bread is toasted and gets rock hard after 5 minutes. Best if eaten right on the spot! \n\n3 stars overall because they are overpriced for the serving sizes and because the wait for food is on the long side which is important when you only have an hour lunch break.", "author": "Giovanna F."}

The meat portion was appropriate, and they give you a fair portion without having it be a gut bomber, though it wasn't piping hot. \n\nI asked for extra sauce, and it looked like they threw a tablespoon on it; I didn't see the value of the aioli sauce because there wasn't enough on it in order for me to decipher the taste.\n\nThere were less than five onion slivers, which tasted like they had been marinated in something sweet; there were prob less than five sweet potato slices inside of the sandwich.\n\nThey give you order numbers when you pay, yet they don't call 'em out when the orders are ready.

They were thinly sliced and added a hint of sweetness to the pork.  \n\nMy colleague got the sweet potato fries - super tasty.  Crispy on the outside soft on the inside, the way I love my fries.  The BBQ sauce it came with didn't really taste anything like BBQ - it had a gingery taste. \n\nThe plantains on the other hand were gross.  Not sweet at all (only the pieces that had honey on them) and weren't fried like the El Salvadorian type plantains.  It was more like they were...baked.  And unripe.  Very mealy and starchy.

I found this to be slightly pedantic especially since I was only a dollar short. They don't list the minimum anywhere that I could see and maybe some people may not want to spend $10 on a meal (since most people I know don't carry cash). I ended up purchasing two water bottles so I could pay for what I was now excited for.\nThe sandwich itself was very very good, probably the best I've had as far as pulled porks go so I would definitely recommend.

The beef was cooked a perfect medium and seasoned well.   \n\n-Yucca fries $4:  The box came out big, but the portion was a lil small.

I talked with a couple of people who tried it and liked it, I read the online reviews......and from what I was hearing, this is one of those trucks with some amazing food!  From a few of the reviews, it sounded like you had no idea what good food was until you tried this truck!  Boy what a let down!!  Either that, there must be some other secret Sanguchon truck that everyone else is eating at because I can't figure out what the hype is!!  \n\nI went there with a friend and I paid for the both of us.  I ordered two $9 Barbacoa sandwiches and two cans of Inca Cola and the total came to $24.  Hmmm......$24 for two sandwiches and two cans of soda??  Oh well, no worries I thought.....it would all be worth it after I got to finally taste this \"to die for\" food!  I don't mind paying a premium when you get food that's really good.  When I finally got our order, it turned out there was a serving of sweet potato fries with the order in which I was charged for.  I didn't order those!  My friend said that he didn't hear me order those either.  No worries, I am still anxious to try this amazing food so I didn't say anything about the order mistake.  I take my first bite and WTF!!??  This sandwich tastes like those tubs of BBQ beef mixed in BBQ sauce that you buy in the refrigerated section of the grocery store!!!  I paid $9 for this cr@p!!???  The bread was fresh and slightly toasted, but that was about the best part of the whole sandwich.  I then tried the small order of sweet potato fries which I didn't order and cost me $4.....they were okay at best, but definitely nothing to rave about.\n\nAfter leaving, I couldn't help but feel ripped off!  There are frozen dinners that I've enjoyed more than this!!  I honestly never felt so ripped off from a restaurant vendor before!!  I still feel a bit irritated about this and it's been 3 weeks since I ate there.  I held off, but I finally felt I had to write this review!  I don't know where the \"Peruvian\" part comes into this BBQ sauce sandwich, but this is NOT Peruvian food!!  I don't know wtf it is!!  Maybe a \"wanna be\" McRib sandwich with BBQ sauce and pork meat??  I would have rather bought $24 worth of McRib sandwiches vs these Barbacoa ones.  I've been to Peru before, enjoyed the food there, and I also have Peruvian friends that make authentic dishes.  From the food that I tried at Sanguchon, this has nothing to do with Peru!  \n\nGranted, I haven't tried everything on their menu, but since this first time has left a bad taste in my mouth (literally), I am not in the least tempted to waste more time and money to even try anything else from here!!

I got to try the yuccas and the tamales, my daughter enjoyed every single yucca while my nephew and I had the tamales (we got three instead of two since they ran out of yuccas too).  \n\nWe also ordered the Alfajores (a delectable powdered sugar cookie filled with dulce de leche) The Alfajor was the best I've ever had!   La mar restaurant in San Francisco recently featured an Alfajor dessert and it did not compared to El Sanguchon's food truck!  The ratio of dulce de leche to the cookie was what I considered greatness!  I had to scramble to get more cash out of my purse (all of my parking quarters) so I can buy some more and bring them home to my husband to try.  Being american and loving chocolate, Alfajores typically don't impressed him, but this one did, so much that he wants me to call and order more! \n\nI was so impressed with Sanguchon, I just wished they had not run out of sandwiches so I could try one.

The best part of this truck is the the peruvian cookies.  I think they recently raised the price on these... they are delectable and to die for !  you only get two cookies... they are two shortbread cookies sandwiching rich dulce de leche gooey goodness topped with powdered sugar!  I ate one of these and it satisfied my sweet craving for the rest of the day!  They aren't cheap though.. $4 for 2 cookies but they tasted so fresh and soft they were probably made that day.", "author": "Margie C."}

I had the purple corn juice ($2)..something I'd especially wanted to try. They make it themselves, and yes, it really is purple. It tastes of cloves, like a cold mulled apple cider, not made of apples. Really weird, but I liked it. I think having it once was enough for me, more of a novelty thing. I also had the pan con chicharron, which is on bread made just for this truck, pretty good bread, not anything special. I read that the pork was very lean, but it managed to be both dry and fatty at the same time. I even had a bite of just fat, which I had to spit out (fortunately, I was eating alone!). I did like the yucca, I think it was, that was in there, but there was only about a bite, it wasn't spread around enough. The sandwich is $8, but it's big, with a lot of meat, so I guess it's a good value. I feel like you have to be more of a meat eater for this..to me it was just dry, bland, kinda tasteless, except for the sauce, which still wasn't too tasteful. I rate this lunch an OK. Not bad, not awesome, not worth returning for me, but worth you checking out to see if you might like it better than me. I almost rated it meh 2 stars, but the drink was cool.", "author": "Merredith L."}

My good buddy and veteran yelp reviewer lead us to the first set of food trucks that I was going to experience for the day. I opted for the barbacoa pulled pork sandwich. When I finally heard my name called, I was presented with a sandwich overflowing with tender chunks of pork with just the right amount of barbecue sauce, both sweet and tangy. I was also able to sample a few pieces of the fried plantains with honey and cinnamon. I couldn't help but to try and scoop up the remaining honey and cinnamon at the bottom of the container. Good beginning to an afternoon of eating.", "author": "Mark Y."}

Just ate here with my coworkers in the Portero. and it didn't turn out well. I had the chicken wrap, it didn't have much flavor the beans inside were not fully cooked. One coworker had the BBQ sandwich and had to pull out large chunks of chewy cartilage from every bite. Sweet potato fries were not awful, but were definitely the least tasty fries I've ever had. Only thing that made me happy was the plantains. Hoping I won't be feeling the wrath of this one later on tonight... sorry Sanguchon, I wanted to love you but it just wasn't a good fit.", "author": "Jayde C."}

Last night when I was with my sister she saw a post on fb saying that they were in el Cerrito, I had gotten so happy cause they only showed up in sf, my sister had already eaten one and said it was good and that they accepted credit card, it was around 8:00 and the food truck closed at 9:00 we rushed to the food truck in our pj and slippers( lol ). When we got there, there was a lot of food trucks around. we finally reached the truck, me and my sister ordered the combo of pan con chicharron and it came with sweet potato fries, when my sister was going to pay they said that they weren't accepting credit card at the moment, We didn't have cash with us, luckily there was a bank around the corner. we finally got our sandwiches. when we opened them they were so big I would recommend to share half if your not so hungry. it was good and I would definitely come again however I think I will bring cash with me just incase. The reason my review isn't a 5 star is because well we didn't have cash with us, it would have been good to know that their credit card wasn't working at the moment, also the fact that the combo didn't come with a drink so buy a drink or bring your own. My experience was pretty good over all their sandwiches were good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Vale T."}

I ordered the chicken wrap ($8) because I wasn't in a sandwich mood and I was never fond of sandwiches being served on hamburge-bun-like rolls. I'm really glad that I did now that I've read the reviews complaining about the bun. The wrap was great! Very flavorful in the Peruvian way I suppose. It had just enough spiciness but not too much (I'm a low spice person). It had more carbs (potato, rice?) than meat. I would've preferred dark meat chicken myself but I know that's probably not what the masses want. On a whim I also decided to buy a pack of their Alfajores cookies--WOW! It was like eating a pastry, very delicate and definitely was hand made. It was very rich as well so I gave away the other one. I'd come back.", "author": "M Y."}

I went to Larkspur, with wifey (from Mexico), eager to try it all. We missed out on drinks, but she ordered a pollo a la brasa sand and I had the lomo saltado. Mine was great, meat tender, good fries, tender but not soggy, and the bread was perfect. I needed more aji, more spice, but that could be my fault for not requesting it. Her sandwich was a bit less impressive, with a few gristly bits of chicken mixed in and super soft on seasoning of any kind. Our theory was that they might tone it down - seasoning that is - for the crowd, which would be an oversight, an underestimation, and a mistake, but who knows. I tasted it twice to see if I got a bland spot the first time, but it was forgettable. Not bad, but not great. The platanos fritos were really good for both of us, and we gobbled up the alfajores, although I am spoiled from having really good ones all the time growing up. I will return, and she will try something else.", "author": "R. M."}
