Fortunately, we were well fed with empanadas, mofongo, and lechon. There isn't a ton of Caribbean food in the area as far as I know, so this was a good opportunity to order something a little different.\n\nThere's no liquor here, but the sangria is tasty. I'd come back for a casual dinner when I don't have a reservation and don't feel like waiting in line. The service was also very good.", "author": "Sara M."}

I've had plenty of mofongo in my life and this is definitely one of the better ones! The sauce was so tasty and good and full of flavor with some nice garlic and saz\u00f3n. The mofongo itself was excellent, not dry at all and the pork that came with it was very well flavored. \n\nI also ordered the habichuelas (red beans) and arroz con gandules as my sides and this was enough for two people. Both of these sides were really tasty but the arroz con gandules was definitely the highlight. \n\nPicking the dessert at the end was a very hard choice but I ended up going with the tres leches and was very happy. It was a big portion and really nice and sweet and just everything you'd want from tres leches. Put waiter was super nice and patient, especially since we were being indecisive about a lot of our order. \n\nWill 100% be coming back to try the Vaca Frita and a few of the other items on the menu.

I've been coming here for years, especially for family celebrations.\n\nLet's me just say, my father hates eating out and is very particular of where we go if we do eat out, but yet this is one of the few places he loves coming to. \n\nThe food is delicious and better than the few places around for Puerto Rican / Cuban food in the city. The ceviche, tostones, and mofongo are some of my favorite dishes along with their dessert empanadas. \n\nThe management is very nice and beyond accommodating.

The food is good, the server / management is suspect to some criticism. \nWe ordered the TOSTONES CON MOJO which were tasty. The \nMOFONGO with shrimp was a bit over priced for the amount of shrimp given. 2 whole shrimp with a small amount of chopped up shrimp.The POLLO A LA ESPA\u00d1OLA had  a nice  house Caribbean butternut carrot spiced sauce. The white chicken was a little dry of the sauce saved the day. The LECHON HORNEADO was a nice  dish with good amount of pork. Both main courses came with Puerto Rican rice and black beans.\nTo begin our meal our server took our order and just left the menu on the table which I though was odd. The sever came back and told us one of our appetizers was sold out but was not taken off our bill . Our food was given to us without plates We asked for  some and was given 2 small appetizer plates for the main courses. \nFinally right before we were about to finish our meal the manager came over and said \"cash only\". Our credit card system is down. Since my credit card company gives double points per dollar I lost out pretty good on a $60 tab. A little annoying since I don't like to carry cash on hand.\nWe were never asked if our food was good or needed anything else. Poor customer service.\nYour not going to get repeat business with that kind of service.", "author": "Alan L."}

You always have to try the sangria in a latin/Hispanic/cubano culture lol, it helps to judge the rest of the night.

Then we had the Ropa Vieja! We shared all three plates so it was the right amount, obviously you can order just one plate for yourself and still have a great meal. I would definitely recommend those 3 to try out, however I have to go back and give the Yuka a try again. Wasn't impressed considering in Mother land Nicaragua they are cooked a certain way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-25", "description": "I remember first trying El Nuevo Frutilandia when they were at the San Francisco Street Food Festival a few years back.  I had their Lechon and it blew my mind (bit.ly/1kKi5zG).  The pork was so tender and flavorful!  So after totally enjoying that sampling,  I was really looking forward to visiting their restaurant.  Well it took a while, but I finally made it over with a few friends.\n\nEven though I was completely set on ordering their Lechon, there were a lot of things on the menu that sounded tempting like their Cubano Sandwich, their Tostones Con Mojo, their Garlic Shrimp (Limon Ajo Camarones), and Chile Relleno.  I still stuck with the plan and ordered the Lechon Horneado, and then decided on splitting their specialty Veggie Mofongo with my friends.  We also ordered a pitcher of their Guava Sangria.\n\nGuava Sangria -- http://bit.ly/29VYBpT\nWhite wine, guava\nVery refreshing!  And it paired well with everything we ordered.  If you're going with a small group of people, definitely order the pitcher!!\n\nVeggie Mofongo -- http://bit.ly/2a49ngu\nHand mashed garlic plantains topped with a tomato sofrito\nThis was really good!  The plantain mash was moist and had some good flavor together with the tomato sofrito  I was really surprised with the portion size because it was huge!  If you're dining here solo, unless you have a huge appetite, I wouldn't order this if you plan to order an entree after it.  This really could be a meal in itself.  Especially if you get one of the mofongos stuffed with meat.  I was definitely glad I was splitting this with my friends.\n\nLechon Horneado -- http://bit.ly/29IaNI4\nSlow roasted pork marinated in garlic, pineapple, caribbean spices.  Ordered with Arroz Con Grandules which is Puerto Rican style rice with pigeon peas, smoked ham and bacon\nFinally!!  And the first bite I had of the pork took me back to when I enjoyed it at the SF Street Food Fest.  Just like I described earlier, the Lechon is so tender and the flavor just explodes in your mouth!  They have it down to a science!  The Arroz Con Grandules is a must order with the Lechon.  It's almost like a ham and bacon paella and just completes the whole pork trinity.  And I must mention the portion size, it's a lot of food!!  Because I had the mofongo earlier, I was only able to finish half of my dish.\n\nOverall, I say El Nuevo Frutilandia is must try in the Mission!  It's a really good spot when you're in the mood for some Cuban comfort food.  The food is delicious, huge portions, and the prices are easy on your wallet.  I definitely plan on returning again to try their Cubano Sandwich, and also all their other entrees since the whole menu sounds amazing.  It will be extremely hard to resist ordering another Lechon Horneado though.  It's so good!!!", "author": "Rodney H."}

It's a classic hole in the wall with little signage out front.  Apparently this Puerto Rican restaurant has been here for many years.\n\nTo be honest I know very little about Puerto Rican food as my only other dining experience was at SOL in San Rafael which I enjoyed.  However, El Nuevo Frutilanda was a much different, at least to my taste, cuisine.\n\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\nWe began our evening dinner with the Ceviche a wonderful mix of shrimp and fish that was marinated with a unbelievable tasty pineapple salsa that was heaven to my taste buds.  Most of their dishes are served with Taro Chips which is a fried root vegetable sliced like a large flat potato chip and lightly salted. I think it was the first time that I've had one and I must say that it was delicious\n\nOur entrees consisted of the Pollo A La Espenola which was nice cubes of chicken breast saut\u00e9ed in onions and red bell peppers in a butternut carrot spiced sauce. The sauce was both sweet and tangy very delicious actually.  The entr\u00e9e was topped off with a portion of rice. My partner ordered the Ropa Vieja which was marinated shredded beef in a tomato based sauce with rice and black beans. The sauce was very tasty and was totally different than the sauce that my dish had.  Like in all the great regional cuisines such as New Orleans it has been my experience that the sauces really make the dish and at El Nuevo Frutilandia it is all about the sauce.\n\nOur dinner was topped off with a wonderful freshly baked plantain tart which melted in our mouths. \n\nSan Francisco is a fabulous culinary destination full of multi ethnic cuisines  El Nuevo Frutilandia is a fine example of that - offering up great food, at reasonable prices in a neighborhood rich in fantastic dining alternatives.  We found it to be one of the City's best kept secrets.\n\nWe will be back.....", "author": "Nick C."}

EVER.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nShowed up a little after 9 last night (Yelp says 10pm close). My GF had been interested in it for some time, so we decided to check it out. We waffled on sitting near the door (my GF gets cold) but a seat opened up near the bar and we took that.\n\nWe ordered, switched to another table by the wall when it opened up, and otherwise enjoyed the meal. The food was really good. I was looking forward to coming back again and trying the other dishes. The ambience was nice too, and, up to this point, the server was friendly (mostly) and accommodating. There was an odd tic from her when we asked about moving tables (makes sense now) but otherwise the service was fine.\n\nThe problems came as the meal was winding down. The 4-top had filled up, so there's a group of 5 there and the 2 of us. My GF is not a fast eater, so we she's hurriedly trying to finish her food. The server (woman in black pants and shirt, with dark hair) started being very pushy. She was grabbing plates with food on them, etc. I was scrambling to push the food onto plates we still had. It was weird -- she made it seem like they had a plate shortage in the kitchen. She was very impatient. Things escalated VERY QUICKLY.\n\n* She asks for our carafe of sangria, saying we should pour it into our glasses.\n* I said we'd do that in a moment (my glass was 1/2 full, the rest was for my GF but her glass was already full).\n* She replied that she needed the carafe and was going to take it no matter what.\n* Stunned by her answer, I said \"no, you aren't, we aren't done with it\"\n* She said \"Yes, I'm going to take that carafe\"'\n\n*insert awkward stand-off here*\n\nStunned, I pour the rest into my glass (leaving none for my GF). Carafe is taken. Waitress comes back with the check.\n\nMeanwhile we're wondering WTF just happened. We had never been treated like that before. She wants a tip? I've never in my life left less than 15%, even for the worst service. I wrote as much in a note on the back of the receipt (with a frowny face) and left 10%. I felt shitty leaving that little. I know servers work hard, but this was unbelievable treatment. I didn't know what do.\n\nI signed the receipt and put it in my pocket, planning to leave it (with the note) as we were leaving.\n\nWaitress comes back and demands the signed receipt. I said I would leave it when we left the restaurant (I didn't want to get into with her if she read the note on the back before we were able to depart). Things escalate AGAIN:\n\n* She said she needed the receipt\n* I said I'd leave it as we left, and asked for a to-go box\n* She said we couldn't have a box since I wouldn't give her the receipt\n* I said if we couldn't have the left-over food then I needed to leave less money\n* She then said she'd CALL THE POLICE since we weren't paying (she'd already run my card, btw...)\n* I said of course we're paying, but I'd leave the receipt as we departed.\n* She then said they DIDN'T HAVE ANY TO-GO BOXES (clearly lying)\n\nThis is just dumb. What if I just hadn't signed the receipt yet? In retrospect, I should've waited to do so. But I'd already signed it so she's standing there demanding I hand it to her.\n\n* She stood there impatiently and awkwardly, then said \"I'm going to have to ask you to leave\"\n\nNow I'm confused. Does she want me to pay or to leave?\n\nAt this point it's clear she's having some sort of power trip. The whole thing is freaking surreal. My GF got up and walked to the back by the bar and asked for a to-go box. She was given one. The server walked off as this was happening.\n\nAs we're hurriedly trying to collect the food, a 300 lb. morbidly obese fellow comes to the table and asks me to \"step outside\". Those were his *exact words*.\n\nWTF? Are they really threatening to _ASSAULT_ me over her bitchy behavior? WTF is going on? Fed up and not wanting to aid in her completely unnecessary escalation, I left and waited outside for my GF to collect her things.\n\nHonestly, we were nothing but polite the whole meal. We just wanted a to-go box and to finish the things we ordered without them being forcefully taken away from us. Either that, or be able to depart with them.\n\nI don't know what her problem was. In retrospect, she seemed to have a chip on her shoulder the whole meal. Maybe it was late and she was in a hurry to leave, but the 4-top was still sitting there, unmolested, with a 1/3 carafe of sangria and half-empty plates.\n\nWe were excessively polite, even as I was being BOUNCED FROM A RESTAURANT and THREATENED WITH ASSAULT and a CALL TO THE POLICE for doing nothing more than wanting to-go boxes and holding on to the receipt until I left because she was so completely rude and unprofessional.\n\nPeople like that should not be servers. Are you kidding me? How can you treat customers like that?\n\nI'm now unhappy that I gave her an $8 tip. I want that back.\n\nShe was awful - ruined an otherwise good meal.\n\nAvoid!", "author": "Iago D."}

Let me preface this by saying I have never given a 1 star review before but the service and food I received here yesterday warrants this. They had one server for the whole place. I ordered a glass of wine, waited about 30 minutes and never got it. Then I see her giving other people drinks who got there after me so we flag her down and I order two at once, knowing I will probably never see her again. Then I proceed to order my dinner and guess what? She also forgets to put that in! So after I waited about an hour and a half for dinner and I never even ended up getting it! I did get the empanada appetizer at the beginning which was mediocre at best--honestly more fried dough than any filling. I tried some of my friend's dinner (since I never got mine) and it was so bad that I was actually relieved I didn't get mine.

She's friendly, funny, and attentive, a winning combination in a waitress! Skills possibly honed through her past gig as a bartender. ;) Anyways, if you're having trouble deciding, you should trust her judgment. Vaca Frita vs. Ropa Vieja? Hands down, Vaca Frita, said she. And we couldn't get enough of the crispy, citrusy pieces of steak or savory taro root chips. \n\nWendy's recommendations turned out to be more winning than my fellow Yelpers. I got the much touted Mofongo (with pork) out of curiosity, and while it was interesting, I wouldn't order it again. It was a mush of plantains and pork in garlicky sauce that wasn't evenly seasoned. A dish that struggled for direction and just sort of collapsed into a heap. \n\nThe portions here are pretty small for what you pay, but there are few places to get a clean but authentic Puerto Rican experience such as the one at Frutilandia.

I wish someone had prepared me for the fact that great Cuban food would be ridiculously hard to come by in this otherwise incredibly international city. I'm talking real, solid Cuban food that tastes just like the stuff I grew up with and not a weird fusion.\n\nAnd that's exactly why El Nuevo Frutilanda is such a treasure. It is one of the *very few* places in San Francisco where I can get my all-time favorite Cuban dish, vaca frita (literally \"fried cow\"), and it's absolutely outstanding here! \n\nIf you've never tasted vaca frita, you're missing out. Shredded, tender garlicy-lime-marinated skirt steak that's been fried until crispy like bacon (mmmm!), served with carmelized onions, rice, and perfectly seasoned black beans. \u00a1Riquissimo! as my mom would say. One bite and you'll want to start a revolution. ;-)\n\nNot only that, but Frutilandia serves something from my childhood that's even rarer -- mamey smoothies. Not familiar with mamey? Wondering what it tastes like? There's no way I could compare to anything because it's probably a flavor unlike any you've ever had. Just order it, live a little. It is one of the most delectable fruit flavors out there. Frutilandia's version of it is slightly watered down compared to the way my mom made it, but it is so refreshing on a warm day anyway. You won't find this kind of smoothie at any project juice or any Mexican restaurant. In fact, this might be the only place in town that serves them.\n\nI realize that going on and on about foods from my childhood might not necessarily appeal to most Yelpers out there who didn't grow up Cuban, but I really don't think it's just the nostalgia talking. Cuban food is practically designed to comfort and nourish you. El Nuevo Frutilandia captures this so well, I hope they stay in business through the ages.

The ropa vieja flavor was heavily dominated by green peppers, was tough, and the sauce was too runny. The cuban sandwich was fine though!\n\nFurthermore, the service was pretty paltry too. We were quizzed about if we were willing to pay the $1.25 for pink beans instead of black when we'd asked for the former (this at a restaurant where the alcalpurrias are now $9!), and when we confirmed we wanted the pink beans and were fine to pay for them, black beans were still brought to our table - and when the situation was remedied, the beans themselves tasted terribly burned! Our \"appetizer\" arrived by the time we had almost finished our entrees.

I've been craving mofongo, alcapurrias (although a bit overcooked and hard, they were still delicious), and a real deal Cuban Sandwich for quite some time now. I've had pretty bad luck with Cuban Sandwiches lately in the Bay Area. The last one had arugula and tomatoes and no Swiss. It was a hipster ABOMINATION. Cuban Sandwiches are absolute perfection and the ingredients should NEVER EVER be altered. The only thing that should vary is the amount of love one puts in em. And not the amount of arugula like Habanas in Alameda. Yuck!\nWe did have to wait 10 minutes to be seen when we sat down. The young waitress, seemed to be a bit distracted by some young bucks sitting at the bar. She did, however help us a lot after our 10 min wait. The co-owner was super helpful and nice as well. \nWe're from the East Coast and my wife is Boricua, so we know what to look for.\n\nThe mofongo was delicious, but they brought us 3 very, very little shrimp with garlic sauce to add. The cuban sandwich was good, but a bit salty.\n\nHad to drop my review by 2 stars because the restaurant was closed when we showed up at 6 pm on a Wednesday for dinner. Drove all the way from Oakland took 30 mins to find parking and BAM CLOSED for no apparent reason. Sign on the door stated \"Open.\"\n\nStay thirsty my friends", "author": "Themane D."}

Being myself from Cuba, I expected the food to be as good as I have had in restaurants in Miami . We had for appetizers tostones they where typical, the fried yucca; fried as if you where eating french fries with a mojo that was very bland. The mofongo was good for it being Puerto Rican. My Son had the vaca frita and that was delicious! The rest of us had the Cuban pork. It was tender but had no flavor of the common garlic/ cumin mojo as typically expected in chunks of pork at a Cuban restaurant. In fact it had the flavor of what you would expect carnitas to taste at a Mexican restaurant. We also ordered fried plantains on the side, unfortunately they where so chard/ black they where not edible. Unfortunately they made no attempt to rectify the situation, so I merely told our nice waitress not to charge us for that and they didn't.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-12", "description": "Even though there has been a cafe of one kind or another in this space for over three decades, it wasn't until I passed by during the recent Sunday Streets event that I happen to notice there are new owners who now serve Cuban and Puerto Rican cuisine. That's great news in a city seriously bereft of it. There's Paladar on Kearny, but they don't serve hot food after 3PM. There's Chan Chan west of the Castro - which I've never tried - but am a bit wary because of their constant Groupon deals. There was Charanga in the Mission and Laurel's in Hayes Valley, but both quietly closed. I didn't realize I missed them until they were gone. Gee, I sound like Joni Mitchell. Cuban, when done wrong, can get pretty greasy, a calorific nightmare, but when done right, I've liked it a lot like at the late, lamented Charanga.\n\nMaybe Cuban food is too rarefied to catch on here, but owners Rafael and Tyrisha Frias and their chef Gary Millar are certainly putting their best foot forward in this space. From my recent solo dining experience there, the results are promising. I started with a house specialty, the $4.50 small bowl of Chicken Soup (Sopa de Pollo) which was definitely chock full of vegetables, a bit disintegrated from probably being in the pot for a while. There was also a tad too much oil in the broth since I noticed bubbles, but the soup was hot and flavorful with plenty of shards of chicken to satisfy and pepper sauce on the side for an optional extra kick (see photo). For my entree, I happened to be there on a Wednesday, so I took advantage of the daily special, the $12.25 Arroz con Pollo.\n\nThat was a nice plate of chicken pieces cooked with sauteed peppers and onions, and lots of spices. The saffron rice, which I assumed was cooked with the chicken, was especially delicious when mixed with the black beans (see photo). Satisfying home cooking for sure, although I was hoping the chicken parts were a bit bigger than they were, just my preference. It's a nice casual place, sadly not that busy, and the owners are quite friendly. Rafael is from Mexico, but he, his wife and Millar appear to have a sure hand in preparing and presenting these dishes. The $5 Yelp deal was definitely a good move, though they may want to up the amount like Arabian Nights does if they want to bring in more new business. Some trova musicians could liven the place up, too. I'll be back when I feel like a touch of Habana in my soul.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid home cooking, Cuban style, just needs a tad more refinement\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...pretty low key, maybe a bit more music from the Buena Vista Social Club could help\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...really friendly and attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I liked it and I think Ricky Ricardo would, too", "author": "Ed U."}

The staff and the owner were so welcoming and friendly it was like visiting friends.  It is by no means a big or fancy place but the food was solid.  I had the yucca and veggie empanada as starters.  I love yucca and it's hard to find a restaurant that gets it right.  The yucca here was perfectly fried and came with a nice sauce for dipping.  The empanada was also tasty and the crust was near perfection. It also came with a good sauce. I mixed it with the yucca sauce and the combo of the two was even better.  I split the ropa vieja with my dining companion. It was well cooked and with a little hot sauce spritz quite tasty.  Oh and don't pass on the sangria.

The vegetable filled mashed fried plaintain dish was topped with this creamy garlic sauce and served with white rice and beans. The crispy/crunchy/ soft combination of textures of the mofongo and the burst of flavor from the sauce gave me a mouthgasm. Even the rice tasted fantastic and was textured perfectly.\n\nThe service was phenomenal. The owner came over to chat and was super friendly!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-25", "description": "Sorry to report: El Nuevo Frutilandia is not even mediocre food at best.  \n\nUnfortunately,  I struggled giving this spot 2 stars. Came here for dinner on 11-25-12; I ordered the Puerto Rico sandwich which was bland and they skimped me on the steak meat (see pics). Also, the fries that came with the my meal were loaded with so much grease they shined.\n\nMy wife ordered the Spinach empanada con queso (1 of 3 veggie options). Ten minutes into our wait, our server informs us they are out of empanadas- grrr.  The server then recommended the only other vegetarian options which were the chili relleno or mofongo vegetariano. Since my toddler son was sharing the plate we opted with the mofongo vegetariano (consisting of plaintains, rice, beans). \n\nMy sandwich came soon after we got my wife's order straightened out which left me in a small dilemna.  Either let my food get cold waiting for my wife's meal or chow down in front of her. Our server saw my hesitation and informed me that I should eat since her meal would be a while. \n\nAs I am munching down on my Puerto Rico sandwich, I realize my sandwich looks nothing like the pics on Yelp and how terrible it tastes. With each bite of my sandwich I taste more bread and lettuce than any meat.  Where is all the savory meat? Did they run out of this also? I decide to take inventory, so I open my sandwich to reveal less than six strips of steak meat (see pic). and for over $10. Verdict: F-\n\nThe second entree (mofongo vegetariano) eventually arrives and that also is not met with satisfaction-- not much flavor, small portions.  \n\nBut a huge plus is in order for the house made sangria (white wine) which I was looking forward to (1st star).  However I was craving a red wine sangria but the white wine sangria was pretty awesome served mixed with apple, orange, lemon slices, etc (see pic). But at $6 a glass... well let's just say, they can do better. \n\nSpace is tight in this restaurant.  My little boy wouldn't sit still and without the availability of a high chair (the only other one was occupied), he had to eat on our lap during dinner.  Tip: Be prepared to wait.  Usually, I am pretty patient when it comes to wait times, but I did observe the couple next to us grow frustrated from the wait, and finally they paid and left without the food they ordered. \n\nIn terms of ambiance/vibe, there was Latin music playing, but with all the yelling and clamor from within the kitchen and amongst staff, it made it hard to have a conversation at the dinner table.\n\nMaybe I came on an off night, but with so many choices in the area, I cannot see myself returning or recommending this spot.\n \nThe deal (2nd star): Used a groupon deal I purchased for $20 that got me two sangria drinks and two entrees.  \n\n(+) Latin music playing\n(-) long wait for dinner\n(-) cramped restaurant\n(-) limited veggie options\n(- -) My Puerto Rico Sandwich was a huge disappointment.

It really is a don't-miss.\n\nI was tempted by the Saturday special, but decided to risk fish, which is so hard to get right and so easy to get wrong. Am I glad I went for it! I ordered Filete De Pargo-- red snapper fillet sauteed in olive oil, garlic, lemon and parsley.  It was the best fish dish I've had in years; delicate, moist, skinless, perfect done-ness. The olive oil, garlic, lemon and parsley were so subtle as to allow the fresh fish itself to shine. Yum. \n\nIt came with a large-ish plate of al dente black beans and steamed white rice, again allowed to shine in subtlety and simplicity.\n\nI'm not familiar with Puerto Rican or Cuban cuisines, so can't draw comparisons with other chefs, or with this same restaurant under previous ownership. Today's food was so spectacular and reasonably priced that I will be back. I'm glad that the new (7 months, he said) owners decided to take it over, to keep the restaurant open.\n\nThe restaurant is tiny, with very \"live\" acoustics, so not so easy to carry on a conversation; one happy family with lots of laughter pretty-much dominated the soundscape during my meal.

When I moved into the neighborhood. Yes, it's been around that long. Shows how old I am! I haven't been there in a couple of years. So I took my niece - her first time to El Nuevo Fruitilandia. As much as I love this restaurant, when operated by the former owners, I really believe the new owners have tweaked some dishes, making them just as good or better. And added some new dishes and appetizers on the menu.\n\nMy niece and I went mostly for appetizers (tapas). We ordered (2) papa rellena, mofongo, alcapurrias, empanadas, and the appetizer combo (tostones, yucca con mojo, platanos maduros). And another appetizer like a tamal, Puerto Rican version. Made with plantains/platanos, tara root, and more! We ordered one main dish we shared - paella. We both ordered tropical smoothie drinks. Like smooth tropical milkshakes. Made with Caribbean tropical fruits. I'm lactose intolerant, so I ditched the milk, and replaced with water. Still so good. All that was mentioned, you're going to have to cross-reference the menu to the pics posted on Yelp! to see the actual plates.\n\nDid I eat everything we ordered? I could have! But I just wanted to sample and gave the rest to my niece to take home.\n\nThe decor hasn't changed much since the last owners' remodel. Actually, some of the same wall decor from the very orignal restaurant, 25 years ago. The restaurant is clean and quaint. They no longer have a guitar player in the front window area, like they used to on Friday and Saturday nights. Would be nice to have. The waiter/server was very friendly and helpful.  We ate lunch when they opened. I know dinner must get crowded.\n\nEl Nuevo Fruitilandia is an even more special place to dine for me. If you want to try Puerto Rican-Cuban cuisine, El Nuevo Fruitilandia stands out! I give them a high-5 rating! They compete well with all the new restaurants on lower 24th St (Calle 24/Veinticuatro). I think they surpass a lot of the newer trendy places. And it still has the flavor of the Mission heritage. El Nuevo Fruitilandia has been there longer than folks know. And I hope it will be there for many more years!\n\nI showed my Yelp! coupon on my smartphone and got the discount. That paid for an appetizer+.

The shortage of Caribbean and South American food in San Francisco always drives me crazy and Frutilandia capably fills a giant void. Before you balk, let me clarify, Mexico is in North America and El Salvador is in Central America and the cuisine in both is very different from what is common in other regions of Latin America. The only other Caribbean spot in the city that is as authentic being Parada 22. Frutilandia is Caribbean in multiple ways, one of them being that the place is very casual and unrushed, you never feel like you are expected to eat and leave. The emapanadas here are perfectly done, perfect texture and flavor. The lechon horneado (oven roasted pork) is incredibly flavorful and juicy.

I was able to find the restaurant using the Yelp app and reading that it's a Latin American restaurant I was pretty excited to eat there. \n\nIt's not in the best of neighborhoods and it's surrounded by Mexican restaurants and liquor stores. Parking is hard to find but then again parking is always hard to find in San Francisco. From the outside the place doesn't look very appealing but on the inside it's a very quaint restaurant.\n\nI ordered the Cubano, which is their Cuban sandwich that consists of pork and ham. The sandwich was good but the presentation was awful. It looked as if the sandwich was made as if the cook was given a time limit. Just an awful mess and the fries were just as bad as they were soggy. \n\nOn your very first check in you will be given a Yelp deal that gives you 25% off your order. That's a plus given that I wasn't thrilled about the look of the sandwich and the fries were bad. Just make sure that when you check in and the Yelp offer appears to let your server know right away, as there is a time limit. \n\nThe staff was very accommodating. Both the manager and the waiter were nice and easy to talk to. The bottom line is this. If you happen to be in this neighborhood that is surrounded by countless of taquerias and Mexican restaurants and you want to try something different then I recommend this place. Otherwise I'm sure you can find plenty of other Latin American restaurants.", "author": "Yong Jae C."}

Being that my family and I are Puerto Rican, I was really excited to try authentic nostalgic food. It took approximately 20 plus minutes to get waters and to be greeted at our table.

It came down to us having to cancel the order because we were waiting at that restaurant wayyyyyy too long. The alcapurria was very hard and difficult to eat and the best item was rellenos de papas. The prices are somewhat reasonable. I didn't appreciate the woman not warning us prior that we were going to be waiting over an hour and not all of our food come out at once.

It makes me sad that I am not recommending a place that serves my cultures food but there are other restaurants in San Francisco that you will have a much better experience and the food wouldn't be less than amazing. As patient as we were you would think they would of just given us the pasteles even if we cancelled the order out of the inconvenience of us not receiving the main entree ordered. Its safe to say they don't take pride in the service provided. If you have 2 or more hours to waste and you don't mind mediocre tasting good then you might be pleased.", "author": "Melissa R."}

Craving \"cuban food\" and came this way to get my fixings. I've had cuban food before and always enjoyed it because the dishes are very flavorful. I wanted to give this place more stars, i really do, but something in the food kind of lacks.\n\nHEFFER STATUS.\n\nROPA VIEJA ($14.25) - Shredded flank steak cooked in creole sauce, onions, tomatoes, wine, and bell peppers. includes rice, black beans, and soup or salad. I chose soup because i see other yelps ranting about how good the chicken soup was. OMG THE CHICKEN SOUP (even if it was a small side cup of it) WAS THE BEST!!!!  When the dish came out the portion was decent, not sure if thats their average size or they docked off some because I was purchasing on a Living Social deal.Very good and flavorful. I think I'll just order the chicken soup by itself next time LOL. I didn't really see raisins in my meal, which was fine i prefer to eat raisins by themselves then mixed with a main course. The meat was tender and shredded easily, the flavors of the sauce mixed well with the meat/rice/beans however kind of lacked the strong flavor that I'm use to when eating cuban food, also came with a side of crunch plantains which i wasn't too fond of. I prefer the nice cooked plantains, not these plantain chips with no flavor. \n\nWill I be back?

With that said, overall the food was delicious. It lacked a bit in the true Latin flavor but I am assuming that it may be harder to get some of the ingredients on the west coast because I cannot find them. We ordered several items off of the menu. Plantanos Maduros and Alcapurrias. Unfortunately, they did not have any pastels. The plantains were nice and sweet and the  Picadillio was well seasoned. We each ordered a main dish. The Lechon and the Bistec. Everything tasted great, it just lacked flavor. Both meats were tender. The reason I give this place 4 stars is because their service was superb and their drink specials (pitcher of Sangria) was just what we needed to quench our Sunday thirst. I would say, give it a try, it's probably the closest in Puerto Rican/Cuban food you will come in contact with in the Bay Area.", "author": "Claudine P."}

When we sat down, the server informed us that several menu items were unavailable. Okay, totally normal. We ordered two entrees from the available menu items and then later were told by the server both dishes were also unavailable. Since we already had our drinks, we decided to stay. We improvised and ordered vegetarian empanadas and salad and asked for any dish at all that they could make with fish or with chicken, whether or not it was on the menu. (I don't eat pork and my friend doesn't eat shell fish). When the server came back, she informed us there was no chicken or fish improv options AND that the vegetarian empanadas were also unavailable. The cook did improvise a Maduro empanada for us, which was delicious. The server was extremely kind and apologetic and they gave us a significant discount on the sangria and appetizers we ate. Still, by the time we finished our drinks, it was too late to get food anywhere else and I went home hungry. I would give this place another try to see if this was a fluke. The menu *looked* exciting and the server was really nice, but otherwise this was a total bummer for us, and probably for them too because they lost significant sales and it must have been really hard for the server too!", "author": "Gabby G."}

After hearing some hype on the joint and remembering I got a quite delicious Cubano sandwich from them at the San Francisco Street Festival, I was excited to try the place especially after being turned away a week ago because its was packed, close to closing time, and claimed \"they were out of food\".\nTonight there it was only about 20% full, perhaps because its a holiday weekend.\nThe standard most be low on 24th Street because I ordered the  Bistec De Palomilla (Tender thin top sirloin steak sauteed with orange-lemon sauce garnished with onions and parsley. includes rice, black beans, and soup )and I can't even say it looked good.  It was Not tender and a bit flavorless.  Like a rubbery chip steak.\nMy partner had the Ropa Vieja (Shredded flank steak cooked in creole sauce, onions, tomatoes, wine, and bell peppers. includes rice, black beans, and soup).  It wasn't even actually what he ordered but it was comparable as far as the menu was concerned so he just went along with it.  I tasted it and though I liked it better then my order, it was certainly nothing to write home about.  Presentation was that of a school cafeteria and there wasn't even a plantano on the plate.  Portions were small.\nI may go by there again for the Cuban Sandwich during lunch hours someday if I'm in the hood but don't hold your breath.  \nWe will stick to our favorite in the Haight for this style food from now on.  It has price points, atmosphere, and presentation.  None of which I could vouch for this place.  Go to Parada 22 instead.", "author": "John W."}

Perhaps too strong for the food in this case. Underwhelmed might be more appropriate. However, disappointed is probably not a strong enough descriptor of the service. \n\nI arrived about 30 minutes before my wife and ordered a beer while I waited. Knowing that she would be starving when she got there, I also ordered one alcapurria and some maduros. When my wife arrived, I had finished my beer and the waittress came over. We ordered another beer, a water for my wife, and she commented that the apps would be right out. 10 minutes later when she finally came to get our food order, none of those three things had come out yet. She said they would be right out. 10 minutes later, my beer came. My wife asked again for her water. 10 minutes later, still no water and no apps. We asked again and finally got the water. Eventually the apps came as well, but by that time it had been almost an hour since I ordered them and they were really no longer necessary. No apology or even acknowledgement of the wait. I cook maduros all the time at home. They take 5 minutes; cut and fry, it's really that simple. \n\nUnfortunately, the maduros were not very good either. They were really dry and not greasy or juicy at all like they are usually served, negative stars for the wait and disappointing presentation. The alcapurria was alright, but lacked a bit of flavor, 3 stars. I also ordered a pastel, which I had gotten to go before, so I knew not to expect much, meh, 2.5 stars. I got the mofongo, which was alright, but nothing compared to the version at Parada 22, another 2.5 stars. The wifey got the special of the day, fricase de pollo. This dish was alright, 3 stars is fair. I make a better version, in both of our opinions, but it had decent flavor. \n\nThe services just really killed it. It literally took an hour to get the apps. The waittress must have been newish. She seemed very uncomfortable with the names of the dishes on the menu, not to mention the Spanish pronunciations, always referring to them by their English descriptions (e.g., \"oh, so you want the sweet plantains?\"). She seemed confused a lot and, for some reason, was struggling despite there being three servers and only 5 small tables. \n\nWe will not be back for dinner.

Now I can't say how they do PR food or sandwiches, but I can tell you they don't do Bistec de Palomilla well at all. And that's enough for me to know not to comeback. Why? Bistec de Palomilla is the quintessential Cuban dish. White rice, black beans, and steak. Done. A Cuban joint messing that dish up is like an Italian restaurant doing lousy spaghetti and meatballs. \n\nThe palomilla at Frutilandia was greasy, the seasoning was all wrong, and it was pounded way too thin. If that wasn't bad enough, the white rice had some rock-hard, bottom of the dish grains in it. As for the black beans, they were passable. \n\nThe entree came with a salad which consisted of lettuce 2 slices of tomato and Veg-all corn, carrots and green beans. It was kind of a travesty, actually. The best part of the meal was the warm bread and the nice server.

Delicious Caribbean flavors! I was craving Cuban food on a sunday night and found this place here on Yelp. I saw the menu and immediately jumped on Bart and walked the streets of the Mission to find this small and cozy Cuban/PR joint. Since the minute I walked it I was like, ok, this looks good! the music and the art in the walls was authentic from the island. I ordered the Papa Rellena which is Cuabn and it was very flavorful. My favorite was the Mofongo, I would eat this all day every day when Im at home. and this one was very delicious as well and the presentation was super cute. Portions were big, big, big! The chef is Puerto Rican so he knows about which flavors to incorporate one each dish. IS definitely a most go if you are craving a delicious meal from the island. Prices are good as well.

Went for dinner on a Sunday, never again. The place had just opened for the evening, we sat down and began to drool over the selection. We placed our order only to be denied at almost every request. After finally completing out order, of what we could order, we waited.........and waited. A party of six walked in about 20 mins after we were seated. As soon as they were seated, They had appetizers served. I glanced over to the table, those are the same appetizers we had order over 20min ago.  Then a party of two were seated, they received appetizers as well. By this point I'm trying to scowl my eye contact with staff with no effect. \"That's it\" I belched! I walked to the counter to tell them we were leaving. \"Here is your bill for the soda\" he sang out with a look of glee on his face.

Mofongo was a bit dry and there was only maybe three shrimp in there made it a little less dry with the sauce on it. Black beans were decent, could have used a little more flavor but it was better than the last time I went which was almost 5 years ago (judging from the review I am looking at). Also, on the menu it should say that the pink beans have pork in it because friend of mine almost ate it and she is vegetarian. She discovered this after a bite and could taste the pork. At least the server should have informed us but they were fairly busy when we got there so I guess some important details were missed. Life goes on.

My Puerto Rican partner's craving for home cooking and his desire to give this caucasian American a taste of the Island finally won out and I decided to give it a try with an open mind, and I sure am glad I did!  \n\nWe arrived Sat. around 1:00 PM and only two of the 12 tables were occupied, with one waitress on duty.  After an hour about half of the tables were filled, all with what appeared to be local Mission folks, including a charming elderly couple, which I took as a good sign of authentic food.  On this day, service seemed casual as opposed to slow (as other reviewers have reported), but I could see it perhaps slowing down if it was too full or if too many people arrived at once.\n\nFood-wise, everything we ordered was delicious, including the each-piece-separately-toasted French table bread.  I ordered the Pastel app. on Yelp's recommendation, which I enjoyed quite a bit but wished was more tamale-like for my personal taste.  The Al Capurria was like a yummy meat-filled yucca donut which I'd definitely order again.  The complimentary chicken soup was as good as I'd want a chicken soup to be, properly salted and with very soft, moist chunks o'chicken.\n\nFor entrees we had Ropa Vieja (which my parter swore was properly cooked and had an authentic flavor), and Camarones al Ajillo, seven perfectly cooked shrimp in an amazing lemon-butter sauce.  We also tried the Chiles Rellenos just for the sake of comparison, and although they were much wetter than I expected or have had before (served in a casserole dish filled with sauce), they tasted great.  The breading was of course not crispy due to all the sauce, but it was still discernible and added to the flavor and texture of the peppers.  \n\nRegarding the side of beans which others have reviewed as \"watery and bland,\" my partner says the thinner sauce is the authentic Puerto Rican style.  I don't personally like watery beans, but I found this sauce to be just thick enough on its own and was especially good with the addition of rice, which I mixed in to all the sauces we were served. I felt the beans were \"delicately spiced\" rather than bland, meant to be a basic accompaniment, not a main flavor feature.\n\nSome reviews on here have negatively critiqued the decor, though I found it to be basic but charming, likening it to a restaurant you'd find along the road while traveling in the Island countryside.  It at least appeared to be very clean.  I didn't give the restrooms a try.\n\nI don't know if time of day or day of week are factors in some of the inconsistencies people have reported, but I'd recommend making your own decision.

This place is probably the first hidden treasure I found when moving to the Mission a few years ago. My father lived in Puerto Rico and has always grumbled about the lack of Puerto Rican food in the bay area. So when he requested Carne Guisada (a slow cooked pork stew) for his birthday dinner, I thought, \"hey, I'm in the Mission, I can figure this out.\" We were not dissapointed. El Nuevo Fruitlandia is now a family staple.\n\nTheres a whole list of fried goodness for appetizers: the tostones (smooshed and fried slices of platano) are my favorite, although I wish they had some homemade salsa and not just tapatio. They bring you warm toasted water bread while you're waiting, too, which my sister adores. \n\nYou can tell they've made an effort to cater to vegetarians, which I really appreciate. The chile rellenos (about $7) are the best I've had, in a rich tomato and chile sauce with bell pepers and onions. The mofongo (smashed fried yucca)we get the vegetarian) is also very good, if a bit greasy. The platanos maduros (sweet) are reminiscent of fried bananas but somehow savory and delicious with lots of hot sauce and the white rice and black beans that come with every entree. Yucca con mojo is always perfectly cooked, creamy and so tasty with the lemon they give you squeezed on top. We usually order the salad, too, which is simple but fresh and good, with cucumbers, corn, onions and romaine.\n\nThey also have lots of juices and shakes. I like the juices, but last time I got the shake and it tasted like frothy milk and sugar -- I could barely taste the fruit at all, which was weird. \n\nThe service is very slow but that's because they make everything fresh right when you order it.\n\nThis is one of those unique little gems that reminds me how damn lucky I am to live in San Francisco.", "author": "Suzanne S."}

Keep in mind, I'm Puerto Rican -born and raised- so I know what most of the dishes should taste like.  Trying to be reasonable I don't expect them to be up on \"tastes like when grandma makes them\" status but at least I expect them to taste like if I went to a hole in the wall place in NYC.\n\nWe drive by slowly to check the location around 6:45pm when I see the sign that says CLOSED... Hmm, their website says the hours are until 8pm...  Circled the block and decided to get out of the car and look to see if it was a 4th of July weekend thing but nope, no hours on the door either, hmm.  Then I see her, the waitress inside.  I proceed to knock and signal her to come on over... Success, she heeds my call.  Busted out the Spanish to seem more convincing and she explains that even though they are cleaning they could serve us if we didn't mind.  Score, we go in.\n\nI had looked at the menu online and had pretty much an idea of what I wanted.  There were a couple of things they didn't have (won't hold it against them since they were closing after all) which were the guava juice and the chicken soup that you can have instead of the green salad.  Order for two looked something like this:\n\n- 1 alcapurria\n- 1 pastel\n- 1 side of amarillos (ripe, fried plantains)\n- 1 order of tostones (green, fried plantains)\n- Camarones a la criolla (shrimp in creole sauce)\n- Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in tomato base sauce)\n\nThis came with side of white rice and black beans (Cuban frijoles) and some bread.  Ok here come to complaints...  The alcapurria, the \"dough\" tasted unbalance, meaning they used too much of one ingredient (in this case the baby green bananas) and it was overpowering....  They were also oily.  The pastel was ok, certainly lacking the usual kick of flavor I am used to.  Tostones were ok, I make better.  Amarillos are impossible to screw up so these were good.  I have never been a fan of frijoles but these were bland.  The camarones were ok... although the criolla sauce was bleh at best.  Ropa vieja was again ok, nothing to bring me back.  The mamey and pineapple shakes we got were yum though.  Too bad they didn't have guava....  All of thise for around $45.\n\nI might come back and try to aim for when they are busier to see if then the quality of the food improves even if the service is slower as some reviews mention.  All in all, super sweet of them to seat us when they were getting ready to go but the food...

The appetizers and the pasteles are really authentic, but the mains are less so.  \n\nFor instance what they call Pernil seems more like Spanish food than Puerto Rican.  Real Pernil is usually one of those traditionally poor person cuts of meat such as pork shoulder marinated for about 24 hours and then roasted until it has a crust with some crunch but is still juicy inside.  Something like that would be difficult to make ahead for a restaurant when you have no clue how many people will order it, so compromises end up being made.  At Sofrito in Oakland they leave it roasting all day, whereas at Frutilandia it has been turned into a flattened sauteed pork chop.  It is not bad, but it is not quite right either.\n\nIf you want something more authentic go to Sofrito in East Oakland.  If you have been there already and are looking for something better buy a copy of Puerto Rican Cookery by Carmen Aboy Valldejuli (for Puerto Rican food its a cultural institution in the way that Joy of Cooking and Fannie Farmer was for a generation of people here), the instructions are easy to follow although you need to drastically cut the salt if you would like to live past 50.", "author": "Toy W."}

She, who is far more familiar with the city, suggested that my friend and I try this place, that it was the best Puerto Ricense/ Cubano food that I'd ever find in a restaurant.  Well, I took her word for it and we went and tried it.\n\nI cannot remember what I had, for it was almost three years ago, and I've only been back once since - but I remember leaving content and not poor both times I went, which is a big deal in my book.\n\nI love Latin American food - the spices, the flavors, the contrasts and the staples.

It was about 4pm and the restaurant was all but empty: we thought perhaps it was just a downtime before the dinner rush.  Now we know that maybe there was something else to it!\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but it was really nothing special.\n\nBut what disappointed me the most was the complete and total lack of service by the one waitress in the restaurant.  I think she visited our table a total of 3 times.  Once to take our order, once to bring the food, and once to take our money!  I'm not even sure she refilled our water glasses during our meal.  What really got me was that even when I asked for assistance, it was hard to get any attention.  Mind you, there was only one other couple in the restaurant at this point.  I needed silverware, and because the waitress was so busy playing with her phone, I needed to get up to get her attention. So I got up, walked to the other side of the restaurant to ask for silverware.  Rather than just hand me some, she directed me to the metal cup on the table which was supposed to have silverware in it.  Well, since ours didn't, when I returned to the table I had to get up again to hunt down a fork from another table.  After checking the three tables immediately around us and finding only butter knives, I had to walk again to the back of the restaurant to take from another table.  Oh yeah, and then I had to do that whole process again to get napkins....\n\nI wouldn't have minded as much, but there was nothing else going on in the restaurant at that time.  The waitress wasn't prepping, cleaning, organizing, refilling the empty silverware and napkins on other tables....she was playing with her cell phone the entire time.\n\nAs I said above the food wasn't anything special, so I can't even say there was a saving grace for our whole experience.  In that neighborhood, you can eat at any number of places with similar food, and almost certainly better service.", "author": "E S."}

I realize that I'm not in Little Havana or Spanish Harlem, I get that, but having Cuban food on the menu doesn't make you a Cuban restaurant. I think the owners are actually Nica's or something, but they're not legit. If Wang Foo's Chinese restaurant served spaghetti and meatballs could they be classified as an Italian restaurant? The bistec palomilla was way off, the chicken soup is some kind of Mexican/ Peruvian hybrid, and the black beans were straight out of a can. Also, when you order papas fritas from a legit Cuban spot, you get thin fries that then get thrown onto the steak and get taken down in one fowl swoop, not some steak fries with old bay seasoning that have to be ordered separately. \nI gave an extra star for the effort, because this is after all San Francisco and no one knows good Cuban food around here.", "author": "mario p."}

The maduros was okay but a little over-fried as well. The yucca was okay. I then ordered the baked empanada with spinach, ricota cheese, and onions since they were out of the cheese, tomato and basil one. They come pre-made apparently. It came out looking like cafeteria food. The empanada was smallish and hard, almost like it just came out of the microwave. I've had better hot pockets than this!! It was served with a small plastic bowl of flavorless black beans and a side of rice. I didn't even get the cilantro chutney with it but it's my fault for not reminding the waitress. It also came with a salad that was very skimp on the dressing. Overall, very overpriced for the crap they serve on a plate. Can't remember a worse meal I've had in the city, literally. It was my first time having Puerto Rican food, maybe I'm just not a fan but this was almost insulting.

I would say the service was a bit slow but they were very friendly and tried to accomadate all our needs and they were quite busy before closing.

And so, no way was there going to be a ridiculous MEATFEST for my bday this time!  We loaded up instead on plaintains at El Nuevo Frutilandia, in the form of their Aperitivos Surtidos and Mofongo.  I'm not sure which item was what, but the tamale looking thing on the combo dish was great, and the Mofongo (it was like hash) was REALLY good with the accompanying tomato-ey/brothy sauce.\nOkay - we are talking about MY bday - so there was plenty of protein coming thru the kitchen.  The Fried Pork Chops were AWESOME, just like grandma used to make.  Yes, my grandma is Chinese, but nevertheless, it was JUST like how she used to fry it up - simple salt and pepper yumminess. I got the Picadillo a La Habana Vieja - which I enjoyed - can't go wrong with ground beef, tomato sauce and pimiento olives. I also got a bite of their Ropa Vieja - which was just ok to me; I mean it was moist and flavorful, but over-hyped to me.\nI wish I could say how the dishes my other companions tried were, but they ate it all :-\\\nIn conclusion, it was classic home-cooking w/Puerto Rican spices.  I could probably make a lot of the stuff myself, but being the lazy fuck that I am, I'll pay the very reasonable prices to have El Nuevo do it for me.  Just be forewarned they take that treat-you-like-family-thing to heart: they'll take their time, you gotta bug the waitress for what you want, but she's gonna give you a big ol' kiss and hug if it's your bday.\n\nAs I get older...but not really wiser...that worked out just right.

It might take a while for your food to arrive and you might be half done with your fruit shake, but once you hear those pounding foot steps getting closer, that means that you're foods comin'.  I love the bistec, and savoring the traces of garlic, the black beans, tostones, yucca frita, sandwich suisso (toasted bread with ham and swiss cheese, not a lot of ingredients, but damn tasty,) and the fruit shakes.  On the walls you can see that Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez have already eaten there. Not much has changed from the time I was a six to now, except they added \"Nuevo\" to its name.", "author": "Glu C."}

Ever since I moved out here from Florida, I've been missing good Cuban food and I finally found it!  I had the mixed appetizer platter, which was HUGE and delicious, and the Vaca Frita, which was so good it much be a sin.  Only reason I can't give 5 stars is because there was only 1 person working the WHOLE restaurant while we were there, so service was slow, and she didn't really speak English so I ended up with red wine when I ordered white.  Otherwise, though, an excellent restaurant and I'll definitely be returning!", "author": "Liz P."}

No one there to help her...the food is so bad...unbelievably bad, just awful.  The Coco Rico was warm, the Alcapurria, she cook it three times, thinking that she had it right.  The first time cooked, she burnt it, the second time is was raw and the third time it was over cooked to a crisp.  The owner/cook is from El Salvador not Puerto Rican...!  If there was a half a star I would have given it that!", "author": "Dianne L."}

The Mofongo was delicious! I ordered the Bistek de Palomilla which was a bit lemony for me. It was still good, but having only tasted a few different versions, I could not say if it was more or less authentic than the other. I will definitely return to this place as I want to try the ropa vieja and other entrees. My friends had the vaca frita and a pork dish The pork was a bit dry, but I also enjoyed the vaca frita. The Mofongo though was the hit for me!", "author": "Berna P."}

I've always been curious when I've walked down 24th St.  A couple friends and I went in. I knew something was off because while there were lots of tables open, only 2 were clean.  Ah well, perhaps their busboy was sick that day.  It seemed there were only two people working, the cook and the waitress.  The waitress must have been stressed out.  When she finally got around to taking our order, it was rushed and she was too busy to even ask what we'd like to drink. I felt like we were just stressing her out by being there. The food got there. It was good enough, but not great.  What was worse was the stomach ache I got about an hour after.  Something just wasn't right.  What a shame.", "author": "Anthony C."}

We recently moved to the area and I have been craving a taste of home.   We found our corner of Miami here in San Francisco!  Everything we ate was FANTASTIC!  My favorite dish is Vaca Frita and it was made exceptionally well here!  Make sure to get black beans and rice and some yuca - delicious!!  The mofongo (you are supposed to eat it with the broth!) as an appetizer was FANTASTIC!  And if you have room make sure to get a cafe con leche and some flan to end your meal just right!\n\nIt's a dive but well worth the trip and cheap!   We will be back often I am sure!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-11-11", "description": "The greatest crime committed here against Cuban gastrocentricity es el cafe Cubano.  Just skip that menu item altogether.  At best Frutilandia is ok, other times it is as if the head chef is on vacation and they gave a handful of recipes to the guy at the taqueria down the street who has never even eaten Cuban food.  Speaking from the perspective of a Cuban raised in Miami, this place is disappointingly the most authentic Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant in SF.  I keep going back because I don't always want to have to cook everything myself, but each time I leave more and more disheartened.  Good Cuban food, like good Cuban people, should give everyone hugs and kisses, but Frutilandia is a cold, weak handshake sin gusto.", "author": "Q Q."}

We had the mofongo appetizer - yummy but a little on the heavy side; the ceviche - great flavor, lots of fish and hot peppers; and the special, which was a roasted pork dish called Lechon Horneado. That was the bomb. Melt in your mouth succulent. Amazing flavor that easily rivaled a cubano pork dish I had in Little Havana. And the meat was also extremely lean. I didn't see a speck of fat. Service was a little slow. Good prices, lots of food. I'd go back and try other things on the menu.", "author": "Lisa M."}

The 2 of us shared an order of  pork chops (2 decent size and succulent pieces).  The chops were accompanied by black beans, rice and choice of soup/salad.  We also ordered a side of plantanos maduros (sweet plaintains) which is my idea of heaven on earth in a 3 x 2 dish. An extra bowl of black bean soup which was oh so lovely and shared the fresh batido de fresa (strawberry milk shake).  Get this--the tab was $21 total.
