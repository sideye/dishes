It's a small neighborhood sushi place, with mid-range prices and an average menu.\n\nI sat at the bar last time and was able to take my time, partially because my sushi took a while to arrive. The place was busy, and the fish freshness was mediocre.

No one at the sushi bar, and one other table occupied, shulda been an omen that we paid attention to. On the table:\n\n- Hamachi Kama: was dry & tough, not what it should be. Seemed like it had been frozen for quite some time\n\n- Edemame: not cooked properly (not firm, nor salted), had to ask for a salt shaker which seems to be in short supply at this joint, it took the \"server\" a while to locate it\n\n- Agedashi Tofu: a poorly done rendition. Completely submersed and  soaking in the sauce, it was SOGGY. No topping at all, usually something like thinly sliced green onions or bonito (fish) flakes\n\n- Nigiri dinner assortment: ok, thin slices of fish, some seemed to be a bit past their expiration date\n\n- Bento box (chicken teriyaki, salad, etc.) Gets the BIZARRE dinner award for having a BLUE RUBBER BAND in the salad. Server ( owner/waitress ) responded with, \"oh that must have come from the green onions\" and turned and walked away... leaving the small bowl of tainted salad on the table for us to marvel at. 10 minutes later she reappears and plants a replacement salad on the table (with no BLUE RUBBER BAND), again leaving the BLUE RUBBER BAND salad on the table. \n\n- Various Nigiri: reported to be \"ok\" although this table-mate is too polite to complain\n\nNot many customers at this prime dinner hour, so we were surprised & disappointed at the slow the service was. Good news is there was no uplift charge for the BLUE RUBBER BAND salad.\n\nAs other reviews point out, this joint is near by many Polk Street bars, and frequented by the same clientele.  Perhaps inebriation provides the necessary haze that masks the poor quality food and slow service.\n\nFor me my 2nd visit is my LAST.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

I was quite happy with my late night dinner except for the fact that both my soup and rice were served warm.  This restaurant opens until 10:30 PM on Mondays thru Thursdays and later on Fridays and the weekend.\n\nThe very friendly Chinese-speaking staff greeted me and asked me to take a seat at the sushi bar.  I was pretty hungry.  I had just walked from the Moscone Center to this spot after doing a One Brick volunteer project for Under One Roof, and the only thing I had eaten in 8 hours was a crappy slice of oily pizza from North Beach Pizza at this volunteer project.  I browsed at the menu and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki dinner along with a Phoenix Roll which was posted on a specials board.\n\nThe hot tea they brought me was soothing.  The miso soup looked very good.  I expected it to be hot like my tea, but it was totally warm.  Bummer!  The soup was tasty too with lots of little tofu cubes which had settled on the bottom of the bowl, but damn it, why was it warm?!\n\nThe salmon teriyaki arrived on a big round plate with a large side of salad made up mostly of leaf lettuce.  It had just a bit of carrot and red cabbage with a tart miso-based dressing that had the significant flavor of sesame seed oil.  The salmon was grilled up beautifully slightly charred on either side; it was moist and flaky.  Us Chinese boys like our steamed rice hot, but damn it again, the bowl of rice was only warm.  Why can't these people get their food as hot as the tea?!\n\nThe Phoenix Roll combined eel, minced crab in a mayo mixture, avocado and cucumber wrapped in seaweed then rolled in soft rice and topped with shrimp and tobiko.  It was very good.  I even managed to take a very blurry photo of it that I've posted.  No, it wasn't the camera's fault.  I was just incensed that I got warm soup and rice.\n\nAs I mentioned above the restaurant staff is super friendly, and the lady must have refilled my hot tea at least three times, but sorry lady, four cups of hot tea doesn't make up for warm soup and warm rice.\n\nThe meal ended nicely with a plate of cold, juicy orange wedges.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Hungry for sushi on a Sunday night, my wife and I stumbled across this place and really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at the bar as all the tables were filled, and got to see the chef making the rolls, which is always fun. He was also very nice, as was the rest of the staff. On that note, service wasn't noticeably slow, as I've seen several reviews mention, though I imagine if the place were slammed, things could get dicey. \n\nWe started our meal off with two Miso soups, which were hot and delicious, with nice thick pieces of seaweed included. Then the rolls began to come out. All of them were very good, though I think the 'Crunch Roll' might have been our top pick in terms of both taste and value.\n\nOoh, that reminds me - pricing needs a mention. While the special rolls will run you the standard painful sushi prices of around $12, the regular menu items are all very reasonably priced and quite tasty. We tried a large sampling to get an idea of the place, but we could have easily taken a roll or two off and had a filling meal.\n\nHouse of Sushi isn't blazing any new trails in terms of sushi, but they make a variety of rolls very well, most of them for decent prices. If you're in the area and craving some tasty seaweed-wrapped snacks, then by all means, make the time to stop on by!", "author": "Matthew L."}

It is not too busy and it has a good selection of sushi.  My favorite roll is the Godzi(ll)/(r)a roll that comes out deep fried and dripping in sauce.

My other favorite its the house special roll which is very very reasonably priced and is a staple of my orders.\n\nThe sake comes in a pretty unique serving vessel that has a big old ice cube in the middle to keep it cool the entire time you are sipping it.

I frequently eat here.  I've brought my sister, parents, partner, and a co-worker there on different occasions and they've all enjoyed it.  My father in particular is a kind of Japanese food connoiseur, and he was quite pleased.  My sister is the kind of picky eater who eats maybe three dozen kinds of foods, and yet she will sometimes suggest we go there because she loves the teriyaki chicken so much.\n\nNo fishy smells or bugs in my salad and I've never gotten sick from the food, either.\n\nI enjoy the rolls a lot.  The eel in the swamp roll is nice and tender.  \n\nServing time is pretty fast, too, both at tables and at the bar.  Personally I like to get my check quickly after I'm done, and this place likes to give its customers time to sit and relax after the meal, but I can't really complain about that.\n\nIn fact, my one complaint would the rest of the clientele.  Don't go there right after work on a weekday, it's not pleasant to listen to.", "author": "Argonaut A."}

Pardon the Full House references.  Gyoza was tasty, but that could have been that they just deep fried it a bit much and I'm a sucker for most things fried. As for the sushi, mediocre at best.  I would come by for a quick tuna roll or something of the sort, but our hamachi roll was $12!  The menus are discumbobulated to say the least... there are some 'specials' on boards throughout the restaurant, and multiple menus floating around with different items.  Many lacking prices.  We got the hamachi lovers roll.  The menu indicated it would be spicy.  It wasn't spicy, and I would have guessed it was going to cost a maximum of $7.  But $12?  Come on.

In fact, I came home and explained to my boyfriend that I found it underwhelming at best. My boyfriend ended up going with a friend a few weeks later, only to tell me how GOOD it was... okay, there was clearly a mix up somewhere! Recognizing the real possibility that I just placed a bad order, we went back together and I let him do most of the ordering. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that the first time I went in, I didn't really see the special rolls on the boards (my eyes are bad, gimme a break), but that's where the deliciousness lives. Those rolls are exceptional. Huge, satisfying and fairly affordable. We ordered two special rolls, one regular roll, miso soups and sunomono and were totally satisfied. I left a much happier camper than I did the time before and am happy to report that this will likely be one of our two sushi go-tos in the area now (Nara being the other one). There are lots of sushi places around but it's somewhat hard finding a place that's not overly trendy, fairly affordable and has the quality that you want when eating raw fish (am I right?).
