Maybe they just threw it together too quickly or the lack of reheating each slice. Either way, the slice they reheat when you walk in is FAR superior.

I set the alarm on my phone for 20 minutes. Never received a call, walked over to Prontos, didn't see my pie on top of the oven and knew we had a problem. The guy at the counter said there was not a pick up order,the guy making the Pizza had one order in front of him, he agreed. I said I know there's an order I have an email, that's when counter guy checked and found my order. \"We'll have it for you in 15 minutes\" counter guy said. I replied, \"You should already have it ready from 20+ minutes ago\"!! I walked out, around the corner and had a subway sandwich. \n\nNot sure what the problem is at Pronto, maybe they need to rig their take out order machine with an alarm so when they get an order they are aware of it,  twice now they have not made my order! Guess I should have followed my own advice and called to make sure they got the order but instead I think I'll just take my hard earned money elsewhere. Pronto's loss is  another establishments gain.", "author": "David P."}

I asked if I could get one of the coupons deals without the coupon since I was staying in a hotel and did not have printer access and was told no. then when i went to pick up my order (they have free delivery but i figured it would be quicker, easier, cheaper etc to pick it up myself) there was a menu with the same coupons I had seen online.\n\nanyway, since i ordered a lot of stuff I tried to pay with a $100 bill and they could not break it. so, i had to use smaller bills. the pizza itself is average. toppings were great and the cheese was good, but the dough tasted generic. they sell pizzas by the slice too. so, if you're looking to fill up on the cheap this is a good place. otherwise, if you're looking for some more upscale try other people's recommendations on yelp.\nthey have small tables inside, but unless you're just eating a slice, I'd take it to go. the location is kind of depressing. \n\nthe desert and coffee menu was laughable, so i wound up walking up the hill on van ness to the most Amazing (no embellishment) bakery.

So I took a walk in store and ordered two slices, the chicken pesto and the hawaiian.  For the pesto, they just poured pesto sauce on top of the pizza, which I thought was a little weird but tasted alright.  I really wanted to try Sarah's favorite but they didn't have it listed on their board.  Actually, they didn't have any of the specialty pizzas listed in store.  I think it may be just an online thing, which sucks cuz I wanted to try them.  Note for those who want to try their specialities, order online.\n\nThe two slices were huge.  I was stuffed after eating one.  So I took my leftovers home.  They were warm and the bottom was crispy.. mMmMm~ Perfect combo.  The pizzas were delish and I was sober when I tried them.

Two weeks ago I waited 3 hours and had to make 3 calls to follow up on my order (a small pizza and some mozzarella sticks) .  I was repeatedly told it was on the way.  I told them just to cancel the whole thing and not charge my card, but they wouldn't.  When it did show up, it was cold.  The manager actually called me to apologize and said the next order would be on him.  So I tried again last weekend and 90 minutes later only have my order arrived (a small pizza).  The guy said he'd go straight back, get the mozzarella sticks and soda and be back in 15 minutes.  It took an hour.  To add insult to injury,  the pizza was wrong.  Wrong kind of crust and not all the toppings I paid for were there.  Checked my account today, and I was charged... they didn't comp anything.  Prior to this I received hit or miss service over the years.  Sometimes the food was fast, hot, and good.  Other times it was a mess (undercooked/raw dough).  No consistency.

So I moved on, hoping the burger would be better, but I found onlt disappointment. The bun was burnt from being toasted too long, the lettuce was brown and wilted, and the whole thing had no flavor, it might as well have been made of cardboard. OK, so maybe the fries would be my last chance for a decent lunch. Wrong again. Ice cold and completely undercooked.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs!", "author": "Chip N."}

Somehow (and very creepily) the pizza boy got into my building - our buzzer doesn't work, mind you. I don't care if someone let you in - that just weirds me out. So we open the box, and the toppings are only on one side of the pie and it looks like some dumper sat on the pizza because it was flat and smashed. Grease was oozing everywhere. The slices were cut unevenly - I'm not perfect, but fuck - a 1/2 inch slice? Are you kidding? \n\nBut here's the best part: we ordered garlic bread with a coupon, and when I opened our second box, there were fries with ketchup. What the fuck? I ate a few anyways because I felt entitled to and was thinking about calling back to ask about my bread, thinking I could get more free food. Instead, pizza boy calls me back to ask if he could switch the fries for the bread. I was confused...was he really planning on giving the other customer the fries after I pawed through them? Did he really think that a person who orders junk food wouldn't touch the fries? Five minutes later, he's back. I hand him the fries, and he gives me the garlic cheese bread. Great business practices, Pronto.\n\nWhatever, I want my bread, so I'm dipping away in the ranch and ripping into this guy when I feel some hair floss through the cracks of my teeth. Usually I'm not grossed out, but this was too much. I could feel the hair - it wasn't just that I found a hair hiding in the sauce. \n\nWORST PIZZA JOINT EVER. Slow, expensive, dirty, waaaack.

I've never been to the shop: DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY.\n\nI almost feel badly giving Pronto only one star. Almost. The pizza is generally good and they make the best wings I've ever had delivered. (Baked, brushed with spices and oil and are nice and crispy skin and juicy meat) and they deliver for free.\n\nSo how is it I can give them one star you ask? \n\nLike a few posters before me, I'm really not sure what happened. I used to look forward to my Pronto Pizza, but the past few times I've ordered, something major has been wrong... \n\nWhen I was first introduced to Pronto by my neighbors, it was when they had a guy standing in front of their door holding a fantastic smelling pizza that was obviously nice and fresh, as I could see the steam escaping from the box. Neat. Then I actually got to enjoy several similar deliveries of my own tasty pizza and/or wings. \"Hooray\" I thought. But it wasn't to last long...\n\nEpisode1: I now recognize what was the begging of the end...Rather than the more typical 45mins, my delivery was well over an hour. By the time my pizza finally arrived, it wasn't nice and fresh, but all congealed and the crust was soggy in the middle.\n\nSigh. I thought it was just because it was a busy weekend...\n\nEpisode 2: Delivery took over an hour. I answer the door, buzz the guy in and he just sits there waiting for me. It shouldn't matter that I live on the 3rd floor. I'm lounging around in my sweats, relaxing and watching movies...If I wanted to find my jacket, put on shoes and go down to the street, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO MY OWN DAMN CAR AND PICKED IT UP MYSELF. Delivery means *to my door*. Not to my building, to my street or the bottom of the stairs at the end of my building. To top it off? He was surly with me for having to wait. Are you kidding me? I did pizza delivery for 4 years full time. It's not hard work you lazy fuck.\n\nBut I was probably just unlucky. Off night with a driver who clearly wouldn't last long. Besides, everyone has an off night right? Wrong!\n\nEpisode3: I'm planning on working through the weekend and want lots of leftovers...and some dessert! So I ring up Pronto for an order of wings, pizza and a couple slices of cake. Again, over an hour to deliver, same bum of a driver won't come to my door, and it appears they've charged me $12 for two pieces of cake?!? So now I have to stand around in the cold while this guy tries to call back to his office to work it out....\n\nIt eventually gets done, but too little too late. If I want delivery, I want an effing delivery. If I have to walk down to my car anyhow, what's the point? There are much better places I can do take out from.\n\nSorry Pronto. I won't be calling again.", "author": "Erich N."}

As we stumble back to my friend's apartment, I have the sudden craving pizza - particularly Pronto Pizza because it's probably one of the only pizza places still open in the area. After a good half hour of discussion, we decide to spontaneously order 4 extra large pizzas for pick-up. Total cost is $60 for less than 10 people. We weren't thinking straight and thought it was a great deal. We phoned in the four orders: mushroom and sausage, pesto, ham and pepperoni, and another one which I can't remember. At the time, the pizza tasted like the best thing on the planet, but then again, we were hungry and our standards were off par. Not a bad meal to end a drunken night of debauchery. The mushroom and sausage was the best followed by the ham and pepperoni. They place the ham and pepperoni underneath their cheese so is a pretty nice surprise to bite into.

My order shows up without the drinks I ordered, I get phone calls asking how to get into my building (hint: try the intercom, like every other downtown SF apartment building that has that funny little phone on the gate), and last time I ate in the restaurant, I saw the guy making pizzas burn his hand/arm on the oven and then shortly thereafter plunge his bare hand deep into the toppings to put them on top of my pizza. I'm sure it was just psychological, but christ, I can't get over the fact that I potentially ate some dude's hand-skin. GROSS.\n\nPizza used to be great. Now it's so-so. Delivery is usually timely.

Very appreciative of the business they get, and totally recognize you if you're a regular there.  \n\nI haven't had the sandwiches, but a coworker said they're pretty good as well.  If you get a pizza delivered, it's still pretty good, but I recommend going in if you can stand the neighborhood.  \n\nGood pizza, REALLY cheap.  That's all you can really ask for.", "author": "Adam C."}

The pizza isn't anything amazing, but you don't expect it to be at 1am.  Delivery guys are quick, and pizza is always piping hot.  Online ordering is convenient as always.  Prices are a LITTLE high, but the late hours and good service justify them in my opinion.", "author": "Joshua W."}

My favorite is the Greco pizza, I highly reccomend it. I also had the bbq chicken pizza, which is also very good, except it comes with A LOT of onions, so beware. \n\nAlso, you can't beat the deal that they have at lunch time of a slice of pizza, a salad and a drink for around $5. The pizza slices are huge too, which is amazing. Pronto pizza always has nice clear english speaking people working the phones, which is amazing.", "author": "Chad D."}

When grabbing for a slice, all of the bland toppings sadly slipped off leaving nothing but dough and a thin layer of sauce.  \nWe had hope for the mozzarella sticks...until we bit into them.  4 out of 6 were EMPTY!!! Nothing but fried dough.  Which I ate.  Because I was hungry.  \n\nThis all happened mere minutes ago, and we immediately hopped online to warn our fellow Yelpers.

Definitely the best in the SOMA area in that department and also the best tasting... Yes I am talking to you SOMA Pizza, et al. I think the longest I have ever waited on them is 20 minutes. Best feature though is that you can order at sfprontopizza.com and not have to worry about them hearing something wrong over the phone. Plus there are lots of coupons on the site that you can apply to your order and no matter what you want to eat, one will always apply to you.

I love the spaghetti and meatballs, the meat lasagna (a must-order, the sausage and ricotta are fabulous). I had a grilled chicken sandwich that was tasty but too dry. Their chicken wings are nothing special, but I enjoy them. Once, the delivery person was lazy and wouldn't get out of his car. But the second time they buzzed my door and came up the elevator to my floor. Which was very nice. Also, once they forgot my salad and made a complete return trip to deliver it - thanks Pronto!

He had the spaghetti with meatballs dinner; came w/ garlic cheese bread and a small salad. I had the veggie sandwich (no marinara sauce). Used my \"free 2 liter soda\" coupon. Total 15.61  + tip for a grand total of $20 The food was all really good. The spaghetti sauce was surprisingly delicious - just the right amt of chunkiness and not at all watery. The garlic cheese bread was super - lots of flavor without any grease. The delivery guy had a hard time using my front door entry system and also couldn't find my apartment.

No other similar pizza place I've been to in the City--you know, the fast, by-the-slice, seedy delivery place--can measure up to Pronto. Fat Slice is greasy and disgusting, New York is too thin and carboardy, the place a block up in TL is always too crispy, but somehow Pronto always does their slices just... perfect.
