I can't say for how this place turns out on a weekend since it seems like it becomes a club/lounge, but it's a decent bar with cheap happy hour on weekdays. The space has a dark and swanky feel to it. If it's your first time, note that the bar is a bit hidden around the alleyway on Minna St.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

The downside is that a lot of these deals are on kind of \"meh\" product - their draft selections and $5 shots are just not great stuff. I'd happily do a $5 shot of well tequila, if they offered it,  for example...but they don't. But at least they still got the deals on well drinks! So I'll just take that tequila shot in some OJ and grenadine, please :D.\n\nI love the decor, too; very inventive. \n\nThe super weird thing about this place was the crowd. It was very chill and relaxed, but everyone was smushed up against the bar with their backpacks left at their tables. Uh...guys? This is a major city with a pretty big theft problem; you might not wanna do that. Especially considering like 99% of the people were yuppies, so there were probably shiney macbooks in most of them. \n\nI also had to push through a ton of people to get anywhere - to the bar, to the seating, to the door. It felt like everything I did interrupted about 4 conversations because people weren't aware of their surroundings. I dunno if 25 people all from the same company invaded the bar or what, but that crowd was a very odd experience. \n\nAnyway I got my cheap beer; would totally come here with coworkers anytime.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-16", "description": "Well this is an old story, but still needs to be told. It has been well over a year, but the experience was so egregious, I think at least some of the Bay Area nightclub goers should be aware of the problem I had on my only two nights attempting to gain entrance to this establishment. I think  the upper level management should be aware of this too. In June of 2017, I was enthralled to go to Harlot because the Golden State Warriors (my favorite NBA team) celebrated their NBA Championship party there. I wanted to see where my team was partying and check out the club. I drove all the way from the mid peninsula to San Francisco. When I got to the door, the bouncer looked me up and down (I was well dressed), and said \"what do can I do for you?\". I must have had a perplexed face, because I thought it was obvious, that I wanted to go in. He said it was late, and the manager will have to make the call (It was barely 1:00 am). Seriously, most clubs do not officially close until 2:00 am. I asked him to get the manager, as I wanted to politely ask him myself, which I did. He came out and said \"We are winding down, so we are not letting anyone else in for the night\". I said okay, and went home. The next night, I said I will try Harlot again, as I wanted to experience where my favorite team who brought another championship back to the Bay Area had their victory party. I drove a half an hour plus drive back up the peninsula to SF. When I got to the front door, a new bouncer (who had a thick British accent), said \"Yes?\" as he looks me up and down (I was dressed nice again). I am thinking what dreadful customer service and terribly impersonal impression he gives off.  I told him I would like to go inside and check out the club. He said \"Ah, sorry man, you have to have a woman with you to get in here\". I said \"Huh? I have never head that in all my years of attending night life events and clubs in SF\". He said \"At this club, you need to come with a lady to get in\". I told him that seems really strange, because they never told me that last night when I came try to get in. He looked befuddled, and shrugged his shoulders with a clueless look. I walked off shaking my head. This is very unprofessional as an establishment to not maintain consistency with rules each night and communicate any changes with their staff members. They really need to educate their staff on their customer service and interpersonal relation skills. If there are rules that state you must accompany a woman as a single man, then this should be visibly stated on their website and the on the front door (or at least one of those places). Seriously, this is not like trying to get into the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles or Studio 54 back in New York back in the day. If it is not a private, members only club, don't act like one.", "author": "Hamilton B."}

There was a group of six of us (1:1 ratio male to female, and our first time here), and I feel pretty stupid for even having to mention that. To be honest, I was slightly fearful that we wouldn't even be able to get in considering the horror story reviews I have read here on yelp about racism and getting turned away even if you've bought a ticket (and I say this as a black patron who also bought a ticket for this event). To my delight, there was no problem getting in and the wait was like 2 minutes.\n\nCoat check was right there and it was $5 (for NYE the price got jacked up by $1). It says that they're not responsible for lost or stolen items which I think is silly considering we're paying you to watch over our items?? Why am I paying then if I'm not guaranteed my item will still be there under your possession? \n\nThere's also an ATM and a smoke room which was the only place besides the VIP tables that you could sit. No sitting room? So you want more girls in the club, who are probably wearing heels, but can't accommodate if we wanna sit and rest our feet? Boo! \n\nDance floor is the size of my living room and I think no dance floor should be the size of a living room unless you live in a mansion. In other words, it's small.\n\nThe crowd consisted mostly of older people (mid 30s, some 20-somethings sprinkled in the crowd). Furthermore, no one barely danced. Most of them just stood there in a circle thinking they looked cool. Like, get off the dance flooring you're not gonna dance!\n\nBut, I can't blame them because the music was a little dry. I felt like I was at a cheap EDM concert, not a club. Who actually plays Taylor Swift in a club? I couldn't take the DJ seriously after that. Not that Taylor Swift is bad, just not something you dance to in a club? Totally unexpected. As each song came on, the worse it got. The DJ dropped the beats all wrong and mixed certain parts of the song that didn't make sense. It made for an awkward set list. At one point the music got so bad that I went from actual dancing to just head nodding, and that's when I knew it was time to go. I mean If the DJ can't keep you dancing...\n\nBar service was quick but terribly over priced ($12 for a watered down amaretto sour). No thanks.\n\nNYE decor was Dollar Tree sale bin special. \n\nBalloon drop was cute until all the crazies started popping them in people's faces and to top the night off, there was an altercation between two drunkards on the dance floor!\n\nOverall it seemed to be an average experience but something was missing; probably better music and a more diverse crowd. Leaving, walking by all the clubs, it seemed every other club we walked past was 10 times more lit than Harlot. Just saying.\n\nMost exciting part of New Years was getting a bacon wrapped hot dog on the way back to the car from one of those street food cart ladies that you always see at large or popular events.", "author": "Alexys E."}

Instead of giving me the tickets back so I could find out what she wanted, instead, he took the drinks and stole the tickets. Curly blonde haired douchebag.", "author": "Matthew L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-02", "description": "In a town hardly known for great nightclubs, Harlot holds the distinction of being the worst.\n\nDespite having a young, affluent and cool population, San Francisco lags far behind most cities of it's caliber of nightlife. If a nightclub is supposed to be full of attractive, young, cool people who can dance, with a balance between men and women, then San Francisco is a tough. But, most of those reasons for why this is the case are most exquisitely demonstrated in Harlot. \n\nFirstly, Harlot is a total dump. I would imagine that the place is a serious cash cow, none of it has been reinvested in the club itself.The entire place has a cheap, dated feeling that tries to cover the poverty of the surroundings with low light. The VIP area provides some respite from the overcrowded bar area and dance floor, but it provides no direct access to the dance floor. Service is reasonably good, but nothing special, as it's the worst club in San Francisco. The bathrooms are disgusting, and poorly maintained throughout the night. (There's staff there, so I think that's  a problem of management.) The prices are as expensive as any club in the city.\n\nThe crowd is overwhelmingly single males, without any sense of style. At Origin, they'd be denied at the door.. The ratio is probably 60% single males dressed in dress shirts, jeans and loafers. It's mostly guys who work in tech, who clearly have just gotten off work, who believe that the best way to attract a girl is to apparently hang out on the edges of the very crowded dance floor, creepily dancing by themselves and avoiding eye contact with anyone. It's the sort of look that suicide bombers must have when they're attempting to blend in at a nightclub as they move to the center.\n\nThere are a lot of fights and tense encounters. Most of the guys are harmless, but what makes Harlot special is that there's a frustrated thirstiness to the crowd that gets worse and worse as the night progresses as the decidedly unsexy crowd and atmosphere prevents any kind of romantic encounters. While virtually every club in San Francisco is full of this type, Harlot actually seems to be more prone to fights and rude behavior than any other club I've been to. I've seen fights break out here virtually every time I've been there. Virtually every time I've been to Harlot, I've seen some guy freaking out on a girl. It's a bizarre atmosphere after midnight. Security is fairly light handed, so it's a good place to check yourself. \n\nAfter around 1am, the place can get pretty tense as most the guys in the club realize that they're not going to meet anyone that night (and their best hope is likely to be an arranged marriage) and tensions flare.\n\nConvenient to mass transit, though.", "author": "Michael B."}

We also emailed the club the names of our guests, so to make for an easy experience.. or so I thought. \n\nWe get to the club at a decent time, 10:15 - only to be told by Jeremy the apparent professional \"manager\" that they overbooked for the night of Harlot, and our reserved table space had been given to someone else (even though we had already been charged for the expense) - we were told that we would be given an upstairs \"VIP\" table which normally goes for $1000, at the cost of a table downstairs.  \n\nWe agreed to that - as we didn't want to waste time, and awaited the birthday boy - even though our names were all on guest list - we were told we had to pay cover or we could wait until the birthday boy showed. When he showed - Jeremy looked at him, and the three guys with him and said \"No, you are now paying full price - there are guys with him\". \n\nMind you - we had mentioned this to him already and had provided him with a guest list - in addition to this, the professionals that they are - Jeremy said \"you can take it or leave it, but i'm not letting them in\" - when I spoke up, about how it made no sense and how unprofessional the entire situation was - Jeremy said \"You are not coming in no matter what\".\n\nAgreed, clubs have the right to reserve entry - however I didn't realize that a club manager's ego and pathetic unprofessionalism was going to be the reason I was told I was not going to be allowed in. \n\nAnywho - my friends talked to the other bouncers, and all ended up well - we were guaranteed to go back in, the entire situation had resolved and then Jeremy (clearly lacking excitement in his life) - stated that he wanted a public apology for me.\n\nAN APOLOGY. FOR WHAT?! For calling him out on his unprofessionalism? You'd have more luck convincing a boy scout to litter than you would convince me to apologize. \n\nI did NOT apologize, and my friend told Jeremy to simmer down - which he ended up doing - and we all walked in. \n\nSounds like a bad episode of Jersey Shore huh? Except I'm no Snookie, and Jeremy is definitely no Pauly D. \n\nFrankly, I'm shocked by the unprofessionalism, and utmost rude behavior displayed by the bar manager. It's one thing to be overbooked, and another to be underintelligent. \n\nAs for the club - the music was normal, the alcohol was flowing, the crowd was a bit eh, and it's a smaller spot. \n\nMy advice?

Harlot typically hosts an EDM event called Animal Party on Friday nights. It is also a venue for select EDM DJs to play awesome small shows. Even though it can get super crowded and so hot to the point that there's \"raver rain\", it is such a fun party going environment. I especially love how lax the security is rather than being uptight beezys. The one feature that is pretty cool is the box-like smoking area, that gives people a chance to get a breathe of fresh air, meet new people, and indulge in various types of smoking situations. Overall, going to this spot always guarantees a good night.", "author": "Cristal C."}

At all. There were a lot of advertisements for a theme night at Harlot, and the event never materialized, so we ended up killing an hour at this tiny 'ultra-lounge-ish' place. It filled up quickly with the usual suspects, and although it seemed billed as a dance club, the floor's about the size of a decimal.\n\nAnd this is where I\"m torn. The decor was awesome, the music was tight, but with so many tables (for all the bottle service, I'm sure), there's no room to mix and mingle. Everyone ended up packed uncomfortably in the open areas and although they were able to get plenty of people in the door (there was a line down the block when we left), I heard several other people inside complaining that they thought this would be totally different. \n\nMoral of the story, Harlot tries very hard to be both a dance club and an ultra-lounge, and doesn't really succeed at either.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Here are some of the reasons why we will probably never come back (and will continue telling all our friends the same):\n\n-Harlot decided to give away our pre-reserved table after making us wait outside for an hour: \n\nWe had pre-reserved bottle service and a table, yet when we got there, they actually made us wait in line for an hour and then said \"Oops, sorry... we're out of tables now\" even though we had payment ready up front.  What's the point of reserving bottle service if the club is just going to give away your table? Also, if they're going to give away your table, why not say so immediately, instead of making the birthday girl + all of her friends wait outside in the freezing code for an hour?? Finally, we gave up and went to 5a5 (a much better / more upscale venue with better drinks, better looking people, and no drama)  instead, where we were well taken care of.\n\n-Harlot promised our group we were on the guestlist but then we weren't:\n\nWe were promised free entry for our group of 80+ people and had emailed our list (and received confirmation that everyone was on the list). However, while still at dinner, I started getting calls from many of my friends saying they were there and apparently weren't on the list (although we had received supposed \"confirmation\").....\n\n-Incredibly non-helpful /rude staff: \n\nThe staff was rude, even though we arrived dressed to the nines (girls decked out in cocktail dresses, and we had some guys in suits even) with the appropriate guy/girl ratio AND had bought a table (until they gave it away). I was literally near tears and about to cry from dealing with the rude staff (who were NOT helpful nor even apologetic about their screw-ups)... seriously the worst experience I've had on a birthday or ever in SF. \n\nIf not for our entire group moving to the classier 5a5 a, it would have been a complete disaster / failed birthday. (Thank you 5a5.) Even so, it was hard rounding up our rather large group to inform everyone of a last-minute venue change, since there were over 80 people in our party and not everyone arrived at the same time.  I've never had to wait in line like this at a lounge (and especially not with bottle service)....I've decided that I'll probably go back to sticking with venues whose owners I know or promoters that I know will take care of me from now on.\n\nSummary: \n\nBOYCOTT Harlot (unless you want to encourage places like this).

I understand that Harlot needs to make money, but come on, filling your club over capacity does not make anybody happy and ruins everybody's night. \n\nIn the middle of the night the speakers on the first floor stopped working for about 20 minutes, pretty incompetent if you would ask me.\n\nAnd last but not least is the clubs security, which seems to be non existent. Not only they let everybody in the club no matter how drunk or under dressed you are, but they also don't supervise what is going on on the clubs floor. Drunk people stumbling and falling on the floor dragging people with them, people that should be kicked out, brawls breaking out between guys by the bar. Pretty ghetto... \n\nFew words to Harlot's management, guys you have a pretty small club that could be very enjoyable to be in. Get it right before its too late, seriously its not that hard!", "author": "Oleg Z."}

Oh, wait, that's just the bald douchebag of a bouncer.\n\nWe get it, you want to maintain Harlot as a hip and swanky club as it once was. But here's a reality check - you are NOT that anymore. And you'll never get there if you continue employing such deploring behavior at the door. You are not a Marquee or an  XS in Vegas. You are in front of a parking lot on a dingy street.\n\nSo what was my experience?\n\nOur party of about 15 people, almost even number of girls:guys, all dressed to the nines, wanted to go out dancing on a Friday nite. We were all in a good mood after spending a few hours at the District. So for whatever reason we chose Harlot (I've been a here a couple of times before). As with any large party, we got to Harlot within 10 minutes of each other. The \"privileged\" few entered the club, while the other people got stuck outside around 11.\n\nOk, so there was no cover, and not a soul in sight outside, and the inside of the club was empty (according to my peeps who were inside). So Mr.Moby tells us that he can't let us enter because were 3 guys and 1 girl. We were like, we already have our group inside full of girls and guys. Apparently, that did not help, instead Mr Moby recommended to get a table service. SERIOUSLY? REALLY?  Do you think this is the first club we are ever going to in our lives? Buddy, first off there's nobody inside, there are 15 people about to give you a shitload of business but you decide to hold us up?  Charge us a cover for god's sake if that works for you. \n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, he happily let some other people inside. I hate, hate, hate to pull the R card especially in SF, but man, this was pretty close. Especially after seeing the way he was letting other people inside. And of course, I'm not even going to start with the rude attitude issues. Again, you are not in Vegas or NY where there;s a line around the block to get inside. \n\nAnyway, we tried to be nice and negotiate and it did not work, so we called our party out and went to 111 Minna - paid a $5 cover and had a blast! In the mean time, Mr Moby and his bunch at Harlot lost at least $1000 worth of immediate business, a really bad yelp review, and a permanent boycott of Harlot by 15 people.

I enjoy deep house, so I was on board with going, but had no expectations for the club itself. For someone with no expectation, boy was I disappointed.\n\nFrom the outside, the club is nothing to scream about. We were using our phone's GPS to find the place, but had to ask for directions because the entrance to the club is in an alleyway between two buildings, next to an open ditch, bordering an construction site. Inside, the scene isn't much better. Like many SF venues, the interior is a narrow hole in the wall, with double tall ceilings. Above the bar and dance floor, there is a small upstairs VIP lounge/balcony. On the floor there is limited seating and the dance floor is all naked cement. In the back of the room is the DJ booth, which overlooks the hot, sweaty masses.\n\nPipes leak on the ceiling, annoyingly drop down onto the dance floor. The crowd is mostly fat, balding men who have just got off of work in the business district.

The times I've been here for a free event or open bar were great! I really like the decor.\n\nFREE Nights:\n\n\"The Rumble\" used to be held here one Wednesday a month before they moved locations. The vibe was chill and relaxed. I even won an ladybug ipod docking station one time, but that's more props to The Rumble than Harlot. During these parties, usually two bands would play and there'd be a DJ. It was never too crowded either. It was a really intimate spot to see a live band!\n\nI've also been to a Metrowize open bar party here. It was super crowded, and one (actually two) of my friends got way too trashed. The indoor club security were actually pretty cool, and helped me get her to the back area to chill out for a bit. One security guy offered to get her water, but forgot, so then one of the managers came by and gave us some trouble for being in the back. My friend was crazy drunk and making a scene, and the bouncers really didn't give us any trouble or hassles. Major props for that because honestly, at the time, she did kinda deserve what she could have had coming to her.\n\nTypical night:\n\nNow, the only time I've been here for a typical night, was on a Saturday for a friend's birthday. This was our last stop of the night, and we rolled in pretty deep. No cover charge. Everyone got in fine, but it was *way* too crowded. \n\nThe layout of this place is weird. There's tons of big chairs and low tables in the middle of the floor, so there's not really any place to move. This is fine on weeknights, but on a weekend, when it's packed, this is really obnoxious. There's nowhere to move, nowhere to dance and you're tripping over people and furniture constantly. \n\nThe DJ wasn't very good either. His transitions were awful, and halfway through a song, the music would just abruptly stop, there'd be a long pause, and then an entirely new tempo/genre would come on. Come on, it's all about beat-matching! Or at least, continuous music. My ipod can do a better job.\n\nI don't know. This place isn't bad considering it's got no cover charge, but I'd skip it on weekends. It's nice chill bar for weeknights or private events.

Many have stated that table service was required to get in (but if Harlot actually does it, they really only have like 5 tables in there... so it'd definitely IS lame if they did that). Also, regarding the racist doorman, my girlfriends and I did not have a problem getting in and we were probably the most ethnic group in there.\n\nMy experience:\n\nMy coworkers and I decided to go here on Friday night for a girls night. Got in super easy. There was no cover charge at all! Drinks are around $10 for a shot. There's a bar on the left when you walk in and the lounge area to the right. At the end of the place is the mini-dance floor. LOVE the ambiance of the place - great gothic decor.\n\nThe DJ was amazing (whoever was the DJ on Jan 27) - please bring him around often! We danced all night. The bass to the right is hella loud so if you don't want your ears to die, dance closer to the bar. The crowd wasn't at all pretentious and no one gave us a hard time. \n\nBy the time we left, which was around 1:30 AM, the place was still packed. We all had a really great time there and plan to bring our friends there, too.

Beau G. asked if I wanted to crash their parties for free booze and possible appetizers, which just added to how awesome this all was. I'm not an iPhone application developer, but dammit I will drink like one. \n\nOn the first night, Monday, Harlot hosted a big party. Beau and I got in, no cover, received drinks and went upstairs to observe all the geeks and nerds that either tried hitting on girls or spoke excitedly of various technologies. I guess you could say we were nerd-watching. \n\nOther than the fact that it's an alright space, I'd much more prefer it for a cocktail party for a wedding or something, because at least then you can control the amount of sweaty individuals invading your personal space...good LORD it was hot in there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-05", "description": "After years of clubbing, my days of waking up Sunday mornings with a stamp on my hand are pretty much behind me... unless 1) the club really is hot or 2) it's a special occasion. Last night was a special occasion.  We went to Harlot to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday.  I haven't been to San Francisco in years, and never as an adult, so I was eager to see how the city's nightlife scene panned out.\n\nWe got there sort of early (around 10:30 p.m.), but the club was already starting to fill up.  Inside, Harlot was medium sized with three large, strange paintings prominently featured: one of two women with strange feathered headdresses looking at each other and wearing undies; another had with a gladiator-meet-viking dude standing ominously in the foreground and a woman sitting in the corner with her hand outreached slightly behind him; a third painting on the main stage area was that of a naked woman covered in what appeared to be blood and a bird leering behind her.  From the ceiling, antler chandlers hung and on the floor, people with glowsticks, glow bracelets, and various battery-operated jewelry danced their hearts out.  At any one time, you could catch at least four to eight brides-to-be determined to cash-in on free drinks for the night and their girls equally drunk.\n\nThe music at first was questionable at best.  As someone who loves club and techno music, I still wasn't sure where the DJ was going with his choices.  It seemed disjointed. He even played a version of Tupac's \"California\" that was so sped up, it made me feel like I was suffering from tourettes. Watching people dance to it immediately made me feel I shouldn't be there. It felt more like 2001 than 2011 and I longed for a chill lounge with good wine rather than a club with wack versions of former hits and pushy people who didn't mind knocking my drink around.\nTo add insult to injury, they didn't even knock my drink for a good reason.  I mean, if your going to bump into me, at least bump into me on beat. My word!  At least the drinks were cheap and the bartenders were fast.  That was a plus.\n\nI had all but written the club until I got to the second floor which was roped off for V.I.P.  It was much less crowded and decorated with pristine white chairs and couches in further-roped-off private lounge areas.  On the white walls hung fresh, fun artwork of various city skylines that completed the space rather than overtook it like the giant paintings did to the first floor.  However, from that vantage point looking down, even those paintings looked better.\n\nRight around midnight is when the chicks in sailor-suit bikinis (complete with sailor hats) got to work.  Slathered in glitter lotion and wearing cheap, wide fishnet stockings, they 'danced' in faux window ledges on the first floor.  And again, I use the term 'dancing' loosely.  It looked more like  vogue-ing or what I imagined Vanna White would look like if she had fallen on hard times and needed a new gig. \n\nThe bright side is that once they came out, the DJ completely stepped his game up.  In fact, the DJ single-handedly changed my night from a 1-star night to a 2-star.  At one point he even mixed Beach Boys \"I Get Around\" with Tupac's \"I Get Around\" and it actually worked.  That takes some skills, my friend.  Who would even think to attempt to mix those two? \n\nNo, I didn't like all the music the entire night, but the crowd did. And, since his job is bigger than just pleasing one club snob like me, I would say he did his job well.  By the end of the night, I was dancing and having a good time (and no, I was not drunk... only had one drink the entire night). I am glad I didn't leave early like I wanted to because in the end, it was an ok night.  I am definitely going to have to check out more of San Fran's nightlife though because if this is it when it comes to clubs, I'm not impressed.  I've been to better in even smaller cities.  I definitely expected more.\n\nPROS:  By the end of the night, you will have an ok night\n             Drinks are cheap\n             Bartenders are quick\n             Nice V.I.P. area\n\nCONS: Cheesy... even has the cheesy lady in the cheesy outfit selling cheesy items in a tray (at least there was candy in there)\n            Can get crowded\n            Pretty much no one can dance here (and that goes for the patrons and the paid dancers)\n\nQUICK TIPS:  Get there early, but bear with the DJ until at least 11:30, because the music won't be really good until then.  Try and get the hook up on V.I.P. because at least you can breathe up there and people watch the folks below.  It's pure comedy watching them.  LOL!", "author": "Elsa M."}

The Transbay Terminal construction happening right across the street doesn't help to the appeal of Harlot too. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the lounge at night definitely gets more rowdy than its peak times for happy hour. The sound system is great and there is typically a DJ. However, like most bars and lounges downtown they don't play hip hop.

Clever, clever!\n \nThe first time I came to Harlot, I was pretty impressed by the ambiance and space. The worshipped/condemned dichotomy of the whore is done tastefully, with that huge painting of a naked chick dripping in blood (nice.) and tables matted with photographs of models, all sultry and seductive-looking. I quickly realized, though, that because of its swank nature, Harlot tends to be the kind of place where people like to sit and stare at each other in their nice clothes and sparkly hair; not the kind of place conducive to a kick-back happy hour or even a wild night out on the town with the girls (dancing is limited and very NON-dropitlikeitshot). In other words, meh... most of the time I can go someplace better.\n\nHowever, for Halloween this year, my girls and I were scouring about to find a venue in the city hosting a nice, FREE party. Harlot was the only place where we were able to find one, so we signed ourselves up on the guestlist. Though initially I was a wee bit disappointed at the choice (I had wanted to stay away from the pretentiousness of the downtown danceclub and actually have some fun this Halloween), it turned out to be quite a nice time at Harlot. Per our confirmation email's instructions, we arrived early and were able to enjoy the club before it got too crowded. It wasn't hard to get a drink, and the dancefloor was poppin' with good, dancey music (they normally only play loungey or house stuff).\n\nWe left and moved onto the Castro when it began to get packed (and when my poor friend who arrived just 20 minutes after us called me from the line outside saying she didn't think she'd ever get in). But despite Harlot's minimal departure from its VIP-vibe this Halloween, I really appreciated the free event, seeing as how most other places downtown were charging 30 bucks and up (oh heeeyell no!).", "author": "Kate V."}

Never heard of or witnessed such a   rude, arrogant and disrespectful manager ever. \n\nMy first experience was for a booking that was gladly expected for few of us at $ 600 for a table and all seem to be going well as a bunch of guys ahead of us  went in easy and while me with my 4 south Asian friends were held back and asked to pay up $ 1500 dollars for the same table which was $ 600 a minute back. \n\nThe rude reasoning by this guy  Jeremy was that we were too many guys and hence the price now is what it is. While we understand the reason we did mention that we were confirmed $ 600  on phone and we had mentioned we were 5 guys coming in. He turned rude and disrespectful instantly and mentioned the price is what he says take it or leave it. We are a group of valley professionals leading medium to  large businesses and face numerous situations on  day today basis. We chose to move on feeling a little surprised on his un-provoked rude reaction. Giving him the benefit .....felt he might have had a bad day  \n\nWe returned a month later  as we had friends and family visiting us from overseas and again joined by my Asian friends and their wives ( this time more girls than guys). We were escorted in by a nice lady and the table was  given to us at $ 1000 overseeing the dance floor. Once in and settled for few minutes our old friend Jeremy came by and asked us to move to another table at a dead corner and when we asked him why... he came back as his usual self rude saying he wanted to make that change and asking us to cancel and leave if we didn't like the second table he was offering. He didn't have the basic courtesy to behave well in front of ladies even.\n\nThis was really embarrassing for my guests and their family and this time around .....we left vouching  never to come back here and I encourage all my friends reading this  not to patronize this place while such a rude behavior is displayed.  I have told my teams and few hundred employees working for my organization to patronize the nearest clubs like Temple, Vessel, Infusion . I have conducted 5 corporate events in the last 3 months in these clubs and I would rather take my business elsewhere than give it to an organization that encourages such rude , irrational, un professional and arrogant individuals as Jeremy.\n\n\nWhile I see many comments here showcasing him to be  a RACIST I am not sure but planning to seek some advice here.  The behavior of this individual is not what is representative of a beautiful city like San Francisco or its citizens and in fact I don't think the rest of the employees at Harlot are to be held for this behavior too. But somebody needs to get this on track. The world's most loved city doesn't need such a clown of a  character who can't treat women and diverse nationalities with respect and regard.\n\nI see he has been given one too many chances to redeem himself as a professional now but he fails...... I encourage through this note that the Harlot Management  take these reviews seriously and do the needful lest you damage your own reputation as one of the most preferred places.", "author": "Master B."}

Here's the summary from the disappointed birthday girl herself - way to go, Harlot.  What in the WORLD is the appeal of the 1:1 ratio rule?  What are you, a sordid Noah's Ark?  Gross.\n\nVeto!!\n\n\"Harlot ruined (part of) my birthday!! :( It was so awful that we actually left and went to 5a5 instead. After an hour of frustration (despite having bought bottle service, signing up for the guestlist, and showing up well-dressed with the appropriate male/female ratio), we actually gave up and left to go elsewhere. \n\nWe had pre-reserved bottle service and a table, yet when we got there, they actually made us wait in line for an hour and then said \"Oops, sorry... we're out of tables now\" even though we had payment ready up front.  What's the point of reserving bottle service if the club is just going to give away your table? Also, if they're going to give away your table, why not say so immediately, instead of making the birthday girl + all of her friends wait outside in the freezing code for an hour?? \n\nWe were promised free entry for our group of 80+ people and had emailed our list (and received confirmation that everyone was on the list). However, while still at dinner, I started getting calls from many of my friends saying they were there and apparently weren't on the list (although we had received supposed \"confirmation\").....\n\nThe staff was rude, even though we arrived dressed to the nines (girls decked out in cocktail dresses, and we had some guys in suits even) with the appropriate guy/girl ratio AND had bought a table (until they gave it away). I was literally near tears and about to cry from dealing with the rude staff (who were NOT helpful nor even apologetic about their screw-ups)... seriously the worst experience I've had on a birthday or ever in SF.\"", "author": "Shay F."}

I then decided to celebrate my birthday here with friends by reserving 2 tables with a minimum tap of $1,000 (gratuity not included yet) and will probably end up spending more. Below is a summary of my disappointed experience with Harlot or more so with Jeremy, aka the so-call bald looking manager that discriminate and/or racist. I despise referring anyone as racist since it is a harsh accusation but it wasn't hard to labeled Jeremy that way since it is the truth.  \n\nDISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE:\nEven with table reservation and advance guest list, Jeremy will not let any guys in (in my case Asian male) even though we were with more than 15 girls and few guys that dressed appropriately and willing to spend over $1000. The venue was absolutely empty at 10:45 pm. He immediately let other Caucasians male in that came right after us.\n\nReason for not letting us in...Jeremy exact word is \"because I am the manager and I am not letting you guys in.\"\n\nOVERALL COMMENT:\nI am hoping that the owner will read all the negative reviews on Yelp because Jeremy is the way he is because the owner allow him to be, in this case extremely unprofessional. Like other reviewers have mentioned, owners must not care about the negative reviews and the people who represent them. The funny thing is Harlot is trying to promote themselves as a place to host corporate/major events which they will have to realized that some of the people that Jeremy discriminated against are actually working professionals for fortune 500 companies and//or in the public relations/media industries that do have final saying/influence in where they will host their next event, which will not be Harlot.       \n\nBased on my recent experience, I will never come back here for any reasons unless Jeremy no longer work at Harlot or at minimum he's not allow to be the voice and face that represent your venue.", "author": "K N."}

(If I could give negative stars I would.)\n\nMy friends and I waited in line for over an hour waiting to get into Harlot. We had 4 very attractive women and 3 guys. When we finally got to the front of the line we realized that they were not letting anyone in from the line we were in, and only letting in people who were on the list.\n\nWhat club has people stand in line for over an hour and does not even bother to tell the people in line that it's guest list only? Harlot.\n\nSpecifically there is a short bald guy who holds the guest list who is a complete prick on a power trip. Multiple times he yelled that he was not letting in \"Lawyers, Scandinavians or French people.\" After waiting for over an hour, when I politely tried to get his attention he just looked at me and said \"it doesn't look good buddy.\" WTF. After an hour of waiting, we left and went to Temple, which let us right in.\n\nDuring the time we there, we probably saw at least 100 people yell at this guy and storm off. I have never seen a bouncer/host incite so much anger from so many people.\n\nI will never go to Harlot again and I'm guessing that most of the people who came to Harlot tonight won't be coming back any time soon either.\n\nIf you want to have a good night, I would recommend Temple, Eve, 330 Rich or any of the many better clubs in SOMA.", "author": "Dan S."}

It's not super bougie, but the crowd is older. \n-I wouldn't come here to look for hot guys or girls. I mean, if you're into \"older men and women\" then come here.\n-The music was ON-POINT!\n-Get there around 11pm and you should be fine, at least if you're a girl.\n-Call ahead of time to get on the gueslist just in case.\n\nI've been wanting to go to Harlot for almost two years now and last night my wish FINALLY came true! A friend of mine highly recommended this place and she's always out and about in SF, so I couldn't wait to go. I was a little hesitant about coming here after reading the reviews on Yelp, but can I just say....none of the below reviews are true...well at least for me.\n\nI arrived a little after 11pm with my two girlfriends and we got in no problem. I did call earlier that day to see if I could get on the guestlist and a nice gentleman on the phone put me on, then told me my last name meant \"black eye liner\" in Arabic. \nUmm....okay...hey, at least I get on the guestlist! \n\nHe then suggested I should arrive at around 10:45-10:50 because at 11pm it begins to get crazy. Well, since I'm always fashionably late I showed up at like 11:15pm and there was NO line. The bouncer didn't even check to see if we were on the guestlist. We got in no problem. BTW: This was a Saturday night, too.\n\nI was expecting this place to be much bigger....and it was actually pretty small. Not as fancy as I was expecting. The DJ that night was DJ Sam Isaac and he was amazing. He played almost all my favorite songs, so after that night...I wanted to marry him.\n\nThe crowd on the other hand......not very aesthetically pleasing. Let's just say a bunch of Santana Row cougar and craddle-robber rejects frequent this place and a bunch of nerds who don't know how to dress. \n\nPicture this: You're listening to \"No Hands\"-Waka Flocka Flame and dancing next to you is a 40 year old woman who is probably a friend of your mom's raising the roof and doing some kind of dance routine from a Richard Simmons video. It's just odd.\n\nSeriously, some of the ladies that night were wearing what I wore to my 6th grade graduation 14 years ago. And these ladies were NOT in the 6th grade! \n\nFrom the Yelp reviews I was expecting everyone in this place to look HOT and there were NOT. I wasn't discriminated against for being a minority and I never felt like they favored the better looking people because none of the people who were there were cute and some people were just wearing graphic tees and jeans. \n\nSeriously, I felt that none of the previous Yelp reviews were true in my experience here.\nMy friends and I somehow befriended a bouncer who looked like a cute Gucci-Mane and he helped ward off crazy hipster dancers from bumping into us and WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK HIM TO! He stepped right in to make sure we had a good time. It's like he saw that we were irritated by the annoying crowd and he helped us, no questions asked. \n\nThe crazy hipster woman dancing like she was having a seizure? She didn't like him so much.\n\nThe kind man then brought us some Voss waters because he saw that we were really hot bc the dancefloor was so crowded. (You know Voss water is the shit and you want to buy it when you're out because the bottle looks cool, but your cheap ass ends up asking for a glass of H2O because it's free.)\n\nNeedless to say, I had a great time!

So I fetch the bus boy and he goes and grabs the host. She walks up and the first thing out of her mouth is: \"it's a 600$ minumum\". It's not like I said I want just one bottle or anything.  So clearly they intentionally wanted to f**k me. This is why I hate bottle service.  They try to fuck U EVERYTIME.  So I said what happened to 300$ minimum and she said there aren't any 300$ minimum tables left, they're all reserved. Ok fine. Order a bottle of goose and patron and 4 red bulls and cranberry juice. Comes out to 850$ including the 100+$ that they automatically tip themselves. This waitress poured us like 5 drinks and bounced and we never saw her again. But the bus boy guys were on point and kept coming by.  Like this is a cool spot and like the vibe... But I don't like being f**ked! And the whole night there were only 4-5 tables that were actually sold so they clearly were on a mission to shaft their customers that night.  So to the owner or management of this place, I understand U got expenses and rent is high, promote ur shit properly and pack the place rather than shafting ur customers.  Actually, from my experience here I think they still would do the shafting even at full capacity.  Not coming back here again, but if I do I won't get a table and I'll sneak in a flask of vodka so I can f**k U guys a lil bit. Hahaaha.", "author": "David S."}

No pretense and she made everyone feel at home.\n\nSadly, after that, the place just didn't do it for me.  We were there early, so the place wasn't much of a scene yet (hey, we don't need a scene...we can make our own!), but beyond that the place had an oddball clientele.  Certainly not  goth or 'the beautiful people', yet not quite douche either.  More than anything, it was nerd geeky (as Seinfeld would say...not that there's anything wrong with that!).  Then again, it was early and we didn't stick around too long so I can't say if it changed for the better or the worse.\n\nDrinks were tasty, although the prices were steep!\n\nAnother disappointment was that I was under the impression that the place had a downstairs or was bigger, but such was not the case with Harlot.

The lounge itself looked good, lots of leather couches and pretty nicely decorated.\n\nSo when one of my friends decided we should head out here on a Saturday night, I thought it was a great idea.  Wrong!  It was terrible.  My boyfriend and I got there before the rest of our group, and checked it out -- at 10PM on a Saturday night, it was totally dead.  We thought it might've been reserved for an event again, so we asked the bouncer/doorman (other Yelp reviews say his name's Jeremy & he's the manager?) and he said nope, it's open.  So we decide to head in and wait for our friends inside, and he asks, \"Did you get on the guest list? If not, you're going to have to get a table\".  Granted, we had six friends coming and probably COULD have gotten a table... at a completely dead lounge.  Yep, sounds like a lot of fun.  I end up calling my friend and letting him know that what's up, and as soon as my friend showed up, the guy started giving him lip too, telling him \"We're really busy, you guys NEED to get a table/bottle service\".  Er... we're not blind... there is literally NOBODY in your lounge.  Anyways, after my friend argued with the guy for awhile, he let us in, but was continued to be rude to my friend's boyfriend, who was running late and whom we told to meet us at the lounge.  We had to send a few people out to argue with the bouncer-doorman-manager to get him in, and the b-d-m mouthed off to them, telling them \"Tell your little friends that this is the LAST person we're letting in from your little group, nobody else gets in\".

After inquiring about bottle service for Harlot, we were contacted by Sarah.  She was extremely professional and patient.  With only two days before our planned birthday event, I agreed upon two bottles (2 bottle minimum) for a Saturday night.  I let Sarah know I would be paying with cash just to make things easier.  I made sure everyone arrived early, right before 10pm.  I was greeted at the door by Sarah and was shown our table options.  We chose a corner away from the dance floor and we were taken care of all night by our server.  I ordered two bottles of Vodka at $250 per bottle, plus the 20% gratuity made my bill $600 total.  I ordered several shots as well and ended up spending another $200.  I NEVER was asked to move or to pay for a better table like some people have been saying in their reviews.  \n\nAfter reading previous reviews I was a bit worried.  However, my experience here was nothing but great.  I'm Asian and had no problems like I read from other Yelpers that keep making \"Asian\" references.  I walked right in and talked to the bouncers a bit, my friends and I drank a whole bunch, we danced our butts off to hip hop, and left with nothing but smiles on our faces.  Service was superb and I even got a follow up e-mail from Sarah thanking me.  Would I come back here?  No doubt.  The laser lights alone would make me come back.  I felt like a stoner staring up at the lasers every 10 seconds.  My only suggestion is to get here early to avoid any lines or waiting.  The same goes for any club really.

The music was surely not my kinda music but I had a great time watching my friends have a great time and watching the other folks jamming to what appeared what their song.  lol\n\nAlso, it wasn't quite diverse.  I was surely the only black girl in the place.  \n\nThe best thing of the night in that place...OMG...Was this totally HOT guy with an accent was jocking me.  Thank GOD by the time he was shouting his conversation in my ear I hadn't gone deaf yet.  I found out he was from Scotland.  I made a mental note of me having to get to Scotland one day before I die :)  As we were leaving to continue our bar hope I said my goodbye to the Scottish guy.  Unfortunately I didn't get his name cuz I was loosing my hearing by then.  Right as I was going to shake his hand saying nice meeting him, he reached as though he wanted to hug me, no harm done right, so I hugged him, and then...HE KISSED ME.  Dead smack on the lips and seconds later I found myself tongue kissing a stranger!!!! OMG...not only has that never happened to me EVER before but that is the first time I've come remotely that close to even being near a white guy or his lips.  LMAO!!!! \n\nLike I said...Interesting place :)", "author": "Sandra S."}

My first review was kind of bias..I went really late so there just drunk people all around and also I'm from Manhattan so I set the bar high..\nAnyway, I'm updating this because this time around the DJ was better, the prices..well I didn't pay for anything- you know the right people things are free..and location is great! The doormen didn't give my friend and I any troube. Just walked up and velvet rope opened quickly, the music was hot- the DJ was so nice!, and the crowd was sexy.

If you seriously hate your job or yourself that much, you should just stay home. \n\nFirst drink: Makers and ginger. All seemed fine to me. \n\nSecond drink: my roomate brought back a Makers and soda. So I went up to the said \"bartender\" and asked her for a fix. She pulled out the gun, threw in a splash of Coke and 7up and said 'Now you have a Makers and Ginger.' I responded, 'well actually it isn't.' She very argumentatively responded, 'well we don't even have ginger.' \n\nPerhaps you should have mentioned that when I ordered my first drink?

What was it?  80s?   \n\nThis is half an office building in one big room with a balcony overlooking the floor.  The famous painting on the back wall was OK, but I was much more impressed with the pictures in the table tops.  \n\nNow, when a living legend declared the end of one of the most famous happy hour gatherings in America, the DYL, whose name is known coast to coast, I decided to show up.  I felt like I might be attending the last Monday Night Class with Steven Gaskin, or something like that.  \n\nIt turned out the room was spacious enough that we could all walk around, and the music was just turned up to a point where we could still hear each other.  I also found that in the glass smoking cage the music was shut out well enough that we could hold conversations at normal voice levels.  \n\nWhat was nice about walking into this spacious lounge was that I immediately recognized about 1/3 of the people.  It was great to have a starting point of kind of knowing each other; that broke the ice really quickly.  Social comfort led to honest dialogue, and I found my inner child talking directly to other persons' inner children.  At times I was brought up to a more intellectual conversation, sometimes about multiple relationships and sometimes about the value of honesty in all interpersonal communication.  Along that line, I got a lesson or two in how jokes can be misinterpreted, and how when I don't get the joke my perception of reality is seriously distorted.  I'm one of those people who can dish it out, but can't take it.  \n\nThe crowd was reserved, for the most part, and there wasn't much for the bouncers to do except repeatedly ask the ladies to stop making out with each other.  \n\nAs the happy hour wound down and we drifted to other bars, I thought this was a very nice bar to have right downtown.

I was stoked by my experience of being shown the iron pillars embossed with turn of the century \"Carnegie steel\" by Jeremy, the Carnegie of cyberspace.\n\nStar 3: The elegant decor from the cowhide chairs to the pictures of Harlots from different cultures, subtly appealing to the archetype of Harlot embedded in our collective unconsciousness.\n\nStar 4: For the choice of drinks and for the choice of those who provide the drinks a.k.a  hot bartenders and staff. I casually complimented a staff on the taste of a piece of chocolate and lo and behold, she tracked me down after half an hour and gave me another piece.\n\nStar 5: Harlot is located at 46 Minna(which, along with Jessie St, is also named after turn of the century harlots).

I really enjoyed the DJ and the music he was spinning last night...from current club bangers...to old school hip hop and 80's party jams...to rock and house.  He played it all and his skills made the genre shuffling seem effortless.\n\nHOWEVER...I am not a fan with how this place is laid out or how crowded this place is.  I think they let way too many people in.  The dancefloor was SO packed that you couldn't move without bumping someone.  Luckily it was a pretty chill crowd.  Also, the line at the bar was at least 6 deep.  Later on in the night a guy mentioned it took him over 20 minutes to get to the bar and get a drink.  Ridiculous.  Luckily we had VIP tables with our own liquor.  (more on that later...)\n\nSo as I was about to say...trying to make your way through the crowd was nearly impossible without running into seemingly random pieces of furniture.  I wish I could have seen the set up before the club got packed...maybe it would have made more sense.  They also had their \"VIP\" tables all along the dancefloor which made the place even more crowded.  \n\nAnd speaking of the VIP table service, we were a large group of about 17 women on a bachelorette soiree.  We were supposed to get the upstairs VIP section...but were \"bumped\" into one of the ones on the floor which was **entirely** too small for our group.  Ya, we weren't happy about that either.\n\nOverall, this place wasn't terrible...but I don't know if I'd be in a rush to get back here either.  I'm with OBM's POV...not really my scene, but it's cool.  The extra star is really because the DJ was on point.", "author": "Angela N."}

You're hands down the coolest looking bar in San Francisco.\n\nBut your attitude, your elitism and your attempts at exclusivity are a joke.  You make your mezzanine a VIP area, and won't let anyone without a wristband come up to check it out, even though there are only 5 people up there?  You keep a line outside when you are at half capacity?  And my personal favorite - you have to pay to reserve a seat else you're left standing?  Loved those empty tables with reserved signs on them while the remaining parts (other than that VIP area) were packed.\n\nNice work Harlot.  So now you'll be left with those who think they're better than everyone else, and those willing to pay for it.

But I thought I'd check Harlot out because it was the second week it had been open, and everyone said it was different, and  I  knew someone who knew someone and was promised I would not have to stand in a long-ass line waiting to get into a club, feeling miserable about myself.  \n\nSo while my tendancy is to rate these places on the lower end of the absolute audrey scale, I'm an open-minded chick and on the relative clubby scale, Harlot does score some points.\n\nFirst off the decor actually has some flair to it.  The NY-wannabe modern minimalist look is so overdone.  Come on SF clubs, let's get some character, some diversity!  Represent your awesome, unique, free-thinking city!  While I can't say the giant paintings of multi-racial  harlots on the walls delivers on that cry for diversity, I can at least say that the effect was evocative.  \n\nSecond, the entrance is pretty neat.  Not the valet-only massive parking lot outside, but the convenient coat check and swank smoking room just inside makes you feel like the owners put some thought into what their patrons might need.  Even though I don't smoke, the coat check was a nice touch.\n\nAnd third, it's a small space but it doesn't seem crammed.  It feels like you've walked into a SOMA loft converted into a bordello.  It almost feels intimate which I thought was near impossilbe for a club.\n\nOn the down side, the hip-hop-ish music was quite crap that night, and the people were extra pretentious, even for a club.

I booked a VIP  table at Harlot through friend's recommendations and what the heck you only turn 30 once. I was told I would be taken care of.   From the moment that I set foot outside the premise it was the birthday from hell.  Here's the recap:\n\nAt the door- they wouldn't let my guests in who were part of the guest list.  They claimed they were at  'full capacity.'  Ugly trolls walked by and got to go in without a problem?  The doorman knew it was my birthday and I had reservations for a VIP table and yet yelled at me and treated me rudely.  By the time we got in my blood pressure was already up - I don't think that's a great definition of being taken care of.\n\nIn the club- we had these uninvited  'girls' sit at our vip table.  I don't know if they were part of the ambiance of the place or what not- but if I'm shelling out money to for a table and we don't want you there- LEAVE.  We didn't get the receipt.  We did have some fighting words for the bouncers, waitresses and all.\n\nThe only pro I would have to say is that they did play good music.  Ladies - there are no hot guys here so don't bother.  Guys - if you can't get a girl to talk to you on a daily basis or don't have enough cash for a lap dance or hooker - then this is the place to be!\n\nIf you want to go all out for an occassion, don't spend your money or your time there.

This 'theme' kind of continued in the 'vip' section upstairs. It didnt really give me a very 'vip' vibe, it was also over crowded, unorganized.. although it did have a nice view of the downstairs dance floor.\nI might go there again, b/c the dj played some fun old school tunes, but i would definitely never pick this place to buy a bottle, b/c you just dont get your money's worth.", "author": "Shadi N."}

Bartenders with more personality than attitude quickly make $9 top shelf drinks, a considerable accomplishment given the women are squeezing varying body shapes into matching lace up bustieres.  A food and fresh fruit drink menu, they promise, is coming.\n\nWith deer antlers, mirrors, one way glass (by a fortuitous and hopefully irreversible miscalculation looking into not out of the women's bathroom), a cheeky talkative men's lounge attendant in a well fitted suit, artistic naked women artwork, the place pays tribute to bordellos and speakeasies through the ages and continents without overtly copying them.

It turns out they couldn't let us in or at least not at that moment, so we could \"take our chances\" and just wait in line.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-08-20", "description": "I have to say, Harlot is a special place.\n\nIt's the kind of place that leaves a lasting impression on you.  It's the kind of place that speaks volume on its beliefs and shows no restraint.  It's the kind of place that would bring a Yelper out of retirement.\n\nCause first, you gotta love where their location is at.  Across the street from a shady parking lot where it would be so awesome if you got mugged there.  And 20 yards away is a sight to behold, where lies about 20 homeless people trying to get some rest while Harlot thumps their music all night.\n\nBut that's not the best part.  The quintessential aspect of Harlot is the service.  Get ready you line waiting lovers.  You will wait long here and you will be ignored out of existence.  If you suffer from too much attention, then you should go wait outside in this line without a reservation.  But I correct myself.  Whether or not you have a reservation is a moot point.  I came with a group of 20 and after some shuffling around to make the regulations to enter this mystical place (more on that later), we were finally able to get our table reservation that we put money down on (about $300 I think).  We waited and waited, then were told to move over to the side of the building where the bouncer could no longer have eye contact with us, then waited and waited some more... oh man, it was great.  I just kept staring at that neon H sign for over an hour until that image got burned into my retinas.  Then as the party planner went up to ask the guy about how come we haven't been seated to our table yet and the guy tells us that they gave it away and told us and the rest of the remaining guests to go back in line or leave.  Don't you love just getting dicked around because that was one of the greatest I've experienced.  At that moment, I was hoping to see Ashton or Snooki or The Situation walk right into the place, but alas they did not.\n\nAnd back to the regulations here, you can't forget about their 1:1 ratio policy.  Harlot doesn't f*ck around.  You can have 100 guys, 99.5 girls and that will not let you in.  Because Harlot is the sh*t (and I mean sh*t).  I don't swear in my reviews very often, but Harlot is that special case where I'm at a loss of words; absolutely speechless.  They put Las Vegas clubs to shame.  In fact, LV should be stricter cause there is no way SF clubs can out-douchebag LV clubs.  That's almost insulting especially since naturally there are more guys than girls in SF than there are in LV.  Time to step up your game, Vegas, if you want to play with the real big dogs of Harlot.\n\nAfter all that, and almost 2 hours worth of being outside, I never did step foot in there.  Well, I have for happy hour before, but Harlot doesn't have the balls during that time period to be douchebags to not allow people in.  Which is underwhelming.  Why couldn't they just have a bouncer outside 24/7 whether or not it's closed.  Or better yet, have bouncers on the corner of the streets to stop people from looking at the place.  I'm disappointed that its not even harder to get inside, they could have attack dogs that chase you for wearing certain types of colognes or have trap doors open when a camera detects your shoes of not being worthy or a big Indiana Jones boulder that chases your group when you don't meet the ratio.  If you want to be even more efficient, why even have a door?  Just replace it with a brick wall instead.  Plenty of missed opportunities here.\n\nWhenever I want to feel used, punked, trampled, defecated on, Harlot will always be on the top of my list and it will be on top of yours, too.

This establishment runs some sleazy business practice.  I checked out their website for pricing on bottle service before I contacted them to get reservation for a party of 20 people for a birthday celebration.  The price was confirmed when I received the email from their alias tables@harlotsf.com.  \n*Basic table on main floor: $500 (2 bottles) up to ten people\n*Roped-off table on main floor: $750 (3 bottles + complimentary bottle of bubbly) up to 15 people\n*Upstairs VIP area table: $1,000 (4 bottles + complimentary bottle of champagne) up to 15 people\nAfter several emails exchange, it was agreed that I would have to spend minimum $1250 + 20% gratuity to reserve an upstair VIP table for the 20 people.  So I assumed, the extra $250 was to cover the 5 additional people.    Spending $1500 for 5 one liter bottle of alcohol is a bit steep.  Hesitantly I emailed back one week before the date of the party to confirmed the reservation as didn't want to try to find another place to accommodate 20 people.  3 days before the party, I received an email from a different person in response to my reservation stating that the price quoted is wrong and that their VIP table on seated 10 people and that I have to reserve 2 tables and each table is $1250.  What? Not only the number of people per table changed from 15 to 10, the price went from $1000 to $1250.  I emailed them back thinking that this is a mistake as who would have thought of enforcing 2 people per bottle service.  Their response is that the first person that helped me was the floor manager stepping in for the bottle service manager while she is on vacation.  That's seems to be such a bad excuse because that doesn't explain why the price the bottle service manager quoted is inflated and the maximum number of people were reduced as what was posted on their webpage.  Funny thing, I went on their webpage today and on their \"Table Service\" link there is no more listing of prices or table info..only an email address.\n\nIt's hard to think that with all the internet savvy people and online reviews, a business would still try to cheat customers to bring in a few extra bucks.", "author": "Vu T."}

She was a sweetheart that night.  So was out hostess, Genevieve.  Top notch service throughout the night.  There were some earlier confusions about the reservation process, but Christy immediately cleared everything up.  \n\nThe crowd belongs there, not like some other place with creepy dudes stalking out everyone.

I was on the guest list, but had to attend another function so I was a bit disappointed.  Since I know one of the owners/designer/architect of Harlot and his wife, I was able to get into the special guest list any day I wanted.  Friday night is when my friends and I decided to go.  We arrived a little before 9p.  \n\nThe space is nice.  Dark, yet sophisticated and very classy.  Beautiful interior design with huge paintings on the walls.  I especially liked the tables with portraits of women.  2 floors of fun, a smoking room and two bars.  Sexy bartenders and a good mix of crowd.  Dance floor and great music -- techno earlier in the night mixed with 90's pop hit including Snoop Dog and Warren G.  The place was packed after 11pm, but my friends and I settled upstairs in the corner booth right across the bathroom.  This place is cozy and perfect for people watching.  Check out the cool bathroom downstairs with the one-way mirror.\n\nOne of my friends and I were making our way outside to smoke when she realized that she needed a lighter...\n\nFriend: \"Do you have a lighter?\"\nRandom Guy: \"No, but you can check the smoking lounge.\"\nCeleste: \"Hey, that's... what's his name?\"\nFriend: \"I don't know...\"\n\nThe Random Guy turned out to be...former Mayor Willie Brown.  I can't believe that my friend just asked him for a lighter.  It was awesome!  \n\nLeft the bar a little before 1am and people were still trying to get in.  It was truly a wonderful night and I'm really glad that I was able to check it out.  I'll probably be back here once or twice again before it finally opens to the public in mid-May.  Harlot is surely a great addition to the nightlife in the area.  It's a very unique place and I know it will become a popular hang out.   \n\nMiss Celeste's Alcohol Count at the end of the night:\n2 Vodka Gimlets\n2 Kamikaze\n1 shot of Fernet", "author": "Celeste M."}

Harlot is a nice space, music is good, crowd is classy, but there are some bad apples working there that spoil the entire experience. \n\nMy story. It was about 1:50am on a Saturday, and I was in front of the bar on the left lower floor asking for a drink. This girl that was bar tending  kindly told me that they stopped serving drinks, and only shots were available (as in small glasses with liquor). I turned to talk to my friends to check if they wanted shots, and they said yes. I tried to get the attention of the waitress again, and a few seconds later, she told me shots were not available any more. I then decided to just order a red bull, since I was feeling pretty thirsty. I tried to get the attention of the bartender again, but she was pretty busy, so I called another bartender, a guy this time, that was nearby. I asked him if they still served alcohol and he told me no (even though he was drinking a shot).  He then moved to another customer. I tried to call him again to order the red bull, but he completely ignored me, I then asked rhetorically if he spoke English, given that he was just sitting on the back of the bar ignoring my request for a red bull. I gave up at that point to order anything and decided to close my tab. I tried to call the same bar tender again signaling I wanted to close the tab, but he completely ignored me.  I then started talking with some of the friends I was with, and suddenly the same bartender approaches one of my friends (that apparently knew him), and asks her (in front of me, without even looking at me): \"Did this dick head just asked me if I speak English?\". I completely ignored his comment despite being insulted in front of my friends, since I didn't want to create any drama and just wanted to close my tab.  The bartender was Asian, and I was told afterwards that apparently he decided to take my comment as a racial insult. This doesn't make any sense to me because 1/ I'm not racist and I don't do racial comments and 2/ my comment is pretty common in the context of someone that is trying to express something and not being understood, it does not have any racial connotation.  \n\nIn any case, I finally managed to close my tab with another bartender and left to meet some other friends close to the dance floor.  About thirty minutes afterwards, this tall security guy grabbed me and said \"I need you to get out of the club\". I didn't know what was going on, and I asked him why did he want me to get out. He didn't reply and started to forcefully drag me out of the club. I told him my friends were still there and I had to grab my jacket that I had checked in. He completely ignored me and he managed to drag me out of the club, despite my protest and my request to pick up my jacket that was still inside. I had no idea of what was going on. I had never been thrown out of a club in my entire life, and I'm not exactly young. I tried to talk to the bouncer at the door to see if I could get some sense of the situation, but he rudely told me that he was just doing his job. After insisting several times with him that I had to pickup my jacket, he finally went inside to pick it up. \n\nI then asked to see the door manager - Jeremy -  that I had met the previous week at the club. (one of my friends had an accident and broke the leg inside the club, and Jeremy drove us to the hospital at the time). I told Jeremy that I had just been kicked out of his club, and I had no idea of what was going on. He was very rude and unprofessional to me, and his first response was \"You are very lucky not be permanently banned from this club. If you talk to me again you will forever banned and will never get in Harlot again\". I was stunned. This was the same guy that last week had been so nice by driving us to the hospital in his own car, but now he pretended he didn't know me. It was already late and I was tired of the entire situation and didn't want to create any drama, so I just left. I was perplexed by the entire experience, I seriously had no idea why I was kicked out of the club, and I was disgusted by the behavior of the people working in this place - very rude and unprofessional, and treating customers bellow animals frankly. The ironic part is that I heard from a friend that Jeremy expelled me out of Harlot because of a racial comment, and there are several reviews on Yelp calling Jeremy out because of his racist behavior (and for being rude and nasty as well). Needless to say I'm not going to set foot on this place again while people like Jeremy or that bar tender work there, and I strongly encourage people to think twice before going to Harlot.", "author": "Ricardo O."}

I got there a little before 10:30, and there was no one in line. Three of us (2 guys and a girl) walk up to the promoter and tell him we're on a bday list. we tell him our names and he casually glances through the stack of papers, and then he tells us we're not on the list. I ask him if he's sure or if there's someone else I can talk to, and he says no. Okay. so i call my friend who organized the get together and ask him whether they put us on the list. They said they put us on 3 lists. We were on 3 lists and the promoter was unable to spot our names. As i'm talking to my friend on the phone, the promoter tells me not to block the line when there's no one behind us. We ask the promoter to check one more time and he gives us so more attitude. So we decide to just wait till the rest of the party gets here. when we come back a little before 11, there's a ton of people in line and they won't even let the people on the table reservation in. At this point, we decided to just take off and go to another place. Later that night, we find out that the table reservation was given away. Lets just say that out of the 80 people that were trying to celebrate a friend's bday , not one person from that group of 80 ended the night at Harlot. Thanks Harlot for the memorable birthday celebration! \n\nI just don't understand how Harlot and the promoters can run a business like this. Why have a guestlist if the promoters can't even read the list? Why take a reservation for a table when it is given away?

Reservations and organization that were done with the actual promoters. Harlot and the promoters essentially defecated on 80 people. They will continue to get other customers, but this is really bad business. What ever happened to customer retention?", "author": "Kevin H."}

They had VIP Service so we got seated right by the dance floor. I have actually been having dreams of coming back here because I just loved the music. I always love it when DJ's mash and mix songs together. The DJ was playing a lot of my favorite music and putting an electronic feel to it. I loved it and me and my friends all had a great time here.\n\nThe club isn't that big but I like the Dance Floor area and it got busy early and stayed busy for pretty much the whole night!\n\nI also like the decor, their are lots of fancy chairs and couches which is always a big plus in my book. I love clubs with nice comfortable couches. For some reason I always end up lying down on them towards the end of the night! HAHA! The whole feel is very sophisticated with kinda a goth/dark feel to it. I really liked it. I like all the paintings on the walls as well and the way the tables are decorated.\n\nI will be trying to convince my friends to bring me back here, until then I will continue to dream about it.", "author": "Luis Q."}

But there may have been some \"laughing at\" along with the \"laughing with\" if you catch my drift. \n\nDo they bus people in from like Paramus, New Jersey to fill this place? I have never seen so many men with schelacked hair, bedazzled t-shirts and flared desginer jeans in one place. What's more, who seem to GENuinely enjoy dancing to Britney and Rihanna but also believe that the song \"Return of the Mack\" applies to them. Automatic three stars for playing Return of the Mack.  \n\nAlso, for a club called Harlot, it struck me as oddly...PG. The music was pretty bad, yet inoffensive, like what they would have played at my (CATHOLIC) high school dances. The bathrooms were oddly clean and not crowded. The security guy was...kinda nice!? I can't put my finger on it. Maybe I've just been going to the wrong places. Maybe I have developed a hostile personality disorder meaning that when I go to certain clubs I expect to get into fights and go home pissed.\n\nOne big extra star for the awesome chick visiting from LA who declared that I was \"too hot for SF\" and allowed me and like 20 of my friends to crash their table, drink all their vodka and mingle with their posse of ibankers. Seriously, thanks! \n\nMinus one star for the lame list guy who resembled an aging member of Creed.

Definitely an older crowd... Upper twenties. Apparently the upstairs was VIP but I somehow managed to get up there... multiple times. Basically if you're a girl and you smile at the bouncer, he'll happily move aside the velvet rope - no convincing necessary. I actually spent most of my time here staring down at everyone, since that's what you're supposed to do when you're VIP. But really, it was just OK - I wasn't a big fan of the random music, but that's just me. Everyone else seemed happy. Just annoying since there was literally no where to sit.\n\nAlso - just FYI, it wasn't THAT pretty. It's also kind of small.", "author": "Leily P."}

The young'ns with hot bods giggling and flirting with the bouncers, slurring speech, uneven steps.   The dudes, while witnessing the short skirts in groups stumbling inside, wait anxiously outside, half hating not knowing the owner, half hating having to bribe the power-tripping bouncer.   Even then, one dirty look, one pair of sneakers, you are out. \n\nInside, shit will happen.  Someone will serve you a weak drink, someone will step on your already in pain toes until they bleed.  Someone obnoxious will hit on you, someone pretty will reject you.   You may get elbowed, you may get into a cat fight.  You snicker at the quality of the clubbers there: too ugly!  You complain about the ladies dancing in a circle who are oblivious to the social aspect of a club.  Go mingle!\n\nBut all in all, you can't really judge a club on these aspects.  As much as they want to promote their club as a fantasy venue where all women are gorgeous, all men are rich and sophisticated and occasionally modelesque, they have no control over the crowd.   The irony is that the clubs don't provide the people, yet that's the single most important thing on which people judge. \n\nWhat you CAN judge though: is the line speedy?  Is the bouncer letting people freeze outside to create an illusion there is a line?  Did the bouncer let in creepy perverts? are the bartenders speedy?  is the space good for moving around?  Is there a smoke room so smokers don't scatter outside and take over the sidewalk?  Is there good ventilation? Does the DJ play good music? \n\nI think Harlot does well on these marks.  We went early and weren't on the list but got in for free quickly.  Although we are a group of attractive women for a bachelorette party, I have known clubs that would reject us or make us pay.  I especially appreciate the fact that it was airy inside.  I was sweaty and I had 20 drinks poured on me, but I wasn't dying from suffocation as I normally feel in other clubs.  \n\nAs for the crowd, it's older and diverse, which I liked.  I didn't feel like an ultra old bachelorette amongst a group of underaged hookers.", "author": "Candice B."}

When I started to feel sick from that Kobe beef burger at Circolo, I ran to the bathroom and politely asked the two bouncers back there if there was another restroom because the line was 30 girls deep. They said, \"NOPE!\". I very nicely said I was going to be sick and they directly me to the alley and told me to get outside. How classy.  When I asked if they would let me back in, they said yes but proceeded to leave their post and left me outside in the cold. Bastards.\n\nOverall, I had a good time.

The DJ should be banished to the gates of hell...or south jersey. \nCrowd - A bit better but still ok. \nDecor - Great. I do love this space and they went outside the box with the decor (ie - naked women on the walls). \n\nOn a side note, I went a while back for a private event and the bouncer actually had the gall to insult the patrons inside. He said something to the affect of 'glad you're coming in, the chicks in there are ugly'. !!! What kind of jackass says that about the place he works at, and to another patron?! Highly unprofessional. Then he tried to tell me I should call him. I asked if his number was 1-800-I-SWEAR-THIS-NEVER-HAPPENED-BEFORE! and that pretty much put an end to our conversation. \n\nOverall this place is hit or miss.

But I had a lot of fun not becuase of this venue but because of the people I went with.  Harlot is definitely a nice venue, very nicely decorated and some awesome table hostesses.  But the attitude of the people who work there, rude bouncers and bartenders really made this place subpar.  Its a shame because a club like this that tries to redefine SF nightlife gets so over its own head that it fails to remember that the customer is the most important aspect to a business.  If only management realized that the NY attitude just doesnt fly in the west coast.  If only they realized that a venue like this with nicer individuals and no bs wannabe exclusive attitude would go a far way, this place would def. rock.  \nFinally, this place is stuck in the middle of no where.

I'll definitely need to take a nap to re-energize for Kickball drinkathon today (Go Suck My Kick!). So last night I went to the Involver pre-launch party. Involver amazes me with how successfully it brings a great crowd together, they are amazing! (Take a break, goto involver.com and sign up for an account. Now! You won't be sorry). Onto the review, this is an amazing venue! I made a brief incursion into the same party as Nancy W. (Go Sharks!) but she's right it was super-crowded. Downstairs was a perfect mix of busy, but not to busy.\n\nThe amazing things here are small details. Antler Chandeliers, a systematic shift between Black and White motifs  from upstairs to down. The DJ didn't ruin the night, and played what I would call my favorite club song (Lovemakers remixing 50 cent, YEA!).\n\nI did do some key research for my soon forthcoming book, \"Stand next to the photographer stupid!\"  Idea is cute girls like being photographed in clubs. You get a disproportionate amount of photos with cute girls, and instead of looking like a drunk donkey stole your 2MP Kodak to snap the pic, it looks like Ansel Adams was following you around all night because, hey, you're just that popular!  That's basically all I got, but I plan on fleshing it out to 90 pages with silly reiterations, pointless add-ons, and the occasional small experiential insight (i.e. doesn't work as well when he's moving around a lot, definitely works better when your buddy knows to suggest putting you in the photo, \"for composition\").\n\nAnyway the event was great and the club staff was friendly (one off-duty worker volunteered to give me a tour!)

Nothing but top shelf service, from the VIP coordinator to the busboy who personally retrieved several nicotine-addicted people in my group cigarettes. That was impressive. The night was a drunken haze, so I can't comment on the caliber of the crowd...and I was almost never down on the main level - I just know it wasn't LA/NY level, but as aforementioned, this is SF. Music got better as the night went on. Taking off a point for not having the fireplace on in the upstairs mezzanine. That would've been nice. $250 for top shelf liquor (keep in mind, 1 liter bottles)\n\nIn summary, if you got a VIP spot in the mezzanine, and you're with a small group of good friends, I don't see how you cannot have a good time at this place.", "author": "Brian N."}

That being said...\n\nThe place was crowded, but in that annoying-crowded-kind-of-way. Everyone always seemed to want to be over there, or right where you were standing while you were standing there.  Maybe this is related to the unoriginal faux-mashup, genre-confused soundtrack provided by DJ A to D. There were three guys messing around with the DJ set-up.  I'm not sure who was the \"real\" DJ, but the guy with the white hat seemed to play the least offensive tracks. Oh, there I go, talking about the DJ...\n\nThe friend that told me about the place was with a group who had a table.  That area was a little less trafficked, so it might have been more pleasant.

If you're not well-connected, good luck getting into a club.  Specifically this one.  The ladies will have no problem getting into Harlot, but the door staff is just plain cruel to the gentlemen.  Guys:  get thee on a guestlist!  Or if it really matters to you, receive a blessing from the owner, then drop his name at the door.  But I think this only works if you're a huge douchebag.\n\nI want to love Harlot, but it just won't let me.  They're in the business of generating an exclusive atmosphere and reputation, but the result is something so chintzy that I don't want to come back.  Though the space, drinks, and music were good, the exclusivity created this really REALLY odd crowd that, to echo another reviewer, was too concerned about ruining their hair/makeup/clothing to have a good time.  For real: everyone on the dance floor was step-toe, step-toe-ing side to side in zombie unison.  I kid you not.  To a pretty solid hiphop mix.  I was amazed.\n\nThe club wasn't at capacity when my girlfriend and I arrived, but it was a huge bummer when my boyfriend and his male friends weren't allowed in when they arrived, so I gladly peaced out.

The lighting (all important) is light enough to see who you're talking to without losing that \"sexy glow\" vibe. The decor is edging toward aristocratic, but not too much so. Where Harlot loses its star is in its layout, which makes it very difficult to move from the front to the back.

No big deal, we'll just hang out outside for a bit. 10pm rolls around and the club manager comes out with his iPad and asks us if we're on the guest list. Apparently eye contact and a cordial demeanor are not this guy's strong suit. But attitude sure is. Might want to take it down a notch, guy. The doormen are pretty laid back, though. We walk in and the place is empty (glad we were on that guest list). We order a couple of beers ($5 apiece), the bartenders are pretty cool, although one of them seemed to have some issues with pouring the draft beers. Look around, no place to sit unless you were one of the lucky few to drop $500 for a reserved table. Luckily we were with one of those groups. Table service is probably about the same as others around: 3 bottles of vodka/jack/something else with all the mixers. There is a smoking patio with some stools, so that's ok. Over the next few hours, the place fills up quickly. Fairly mixed crowd, guy/girl ratio seems pretty decent too. Probably agree with others that the crowd can bend toward the older side. Dance floor is big enough for a small crowd. There's an upstairs too, although I couldn't figure out how to get up there.

A bit crowded on the event I attended, but it is to be expected for a venue opening of this quality. Upstairs and downstairs levels are alluring. The layout of the staircase / bathrooms led to a bit of bottle-necking in front of the bar and along the wall, given the level of patronage, but hopefully this will subside somewhat as the spot settles in to the SF nightlife scene. Positives are great DJ's and nice bouncers, good service and neat smoking room (clearly a homage to the Rye \"smoking cage\", but in this case executed better with clear walls inside). The service in particular was astounding given the crowded and boisterous crowd -- no lip from the bouncer, attentive bartneders, and very friendly (and attractively corseted) waitresses.\n\nWhile it currently has the \"ultra-lounge\" feel of a Mr. Smiths, Dolce, etc., albeit with a much improved decor and layout, I hope it will settle down some and become a bit more of an intimate lounge in the near future. If you're into the crowded/dancing scene, this is a great spot right now.

It was a great crowd and very friendly and attentive bartenders who served up wonderful drinks.  It was fun to look down at all the people dancing and one of the best points - it was air conditioned!  So often the upper floors of places get hot and stuffy, but not here!  Thanks to everyone for a wonderful time!\n\nOriginal Review: I have to give the bouncer credit for letting our large party in last weekend.  We showed up with a group of about 20 people, only about 5 of whom were on the guest list.  Granted, that's our own fault for not putting more names down, but he did let all of us in fairly quickly, and that is including all the guys we had with us (who had to pay $10 cover, but that's not too bad, right?).\n\nAnyway, once we were in, the subdued red lighting and great music quickly put us all in a good mood.  It was fairly easy to get up to the bar, and the drinks were made quickly by the all-female bartenders outfitted in black corsets and red bras.  I have to say that I have no idea how much drinks cost, because it was one of those wonderful nights were I didn't buy myself one drink and still left the bar quite intoxicated.\n\nI have to give the DJ and his guys a huge thank you for letting me and my friend dance on the stage next to your booth.  The dance floor (actually, the whole bar) was way too crowded, and having our own little personal space up there was perfect and a ton of fun!", "author": "Lindsay B."}

That's when I decided, yeah, this is going to be a classy night in SF.\n\nArriving at the VIP entrance, we merely flashed our IDs and then left the small line of 10 waiting outside. Walking into Harlot is like entering some scene from Eyes Wide Shut, without too much of the kinky. Cow skin couches, leather miniwalls, antler chandeliers. Mixed drinks were good, neither tasting like all alcohol or juice.\n\nThe music was alright, and by that I mean every other song was good. I think the one awesomeness was seeing the glowing Apple from the Macbook at the front of the room. A friend of mine tried to ask the DJ to play some more mainstream tracks, to which he replied to her that there were other places one could go to hear mainstream music. But alas... 2 songs later when all the people on the dance floor literally stopped dancing and started talking, the DJ took his own cue to play some good music, and that's also when some really drunk woman in a tube top decided that dancing was waving a tissue up and down to the beat. lol.\n\nNevertheless it was fun if you have a reserved table, and I enjoyed it primarily because we left before it got way too crowded.", "author": "Jessica C."}

When the combination of company and conversation is just right, you can lose yourself in the seductive glow of this place. It's swanky in an sexy, underground speak-easy kind of way, but it's definitely at its best when it's not too crowded. The drinks are nice (nothing too stellar, but they do the trick and hey--who doesn't enjoy having your drink mixed by a hot girl in a corset?!) And the vibe (and a few easy-to-sip drinks) will seduce you into the comfort of intimacy. Be forwarned that drinking here might lead you to divulging your darkest secrets to new-found friends, or sharing a suprisingly sexy but unexpected kiss.\n\nIt's a great place for an after work drink (I've bonded with many a co-worker here) or to get the party started with a group of friends (we went here as the first stop on our bachelor/bachelorette party bus) and took over the VIP seating area in a plethora of sexy drunken fun.

Getting inside the lounge was a breeze since we had RSVP-ed. The lounge itself is attractive and well done -- seats are plush, music was decent without being obnoxiously loud and crowd seemed interesting and hip. \n\nHaving said that, ordering drinks at the bar was like trying to make the Sphinx smile. The bartenders were incredibly inept, very standoffish and downright unfriendly. I realize this is a predominantly straight bar so getting people to stand in lines (to order drinks) might as well result in a constitutional amendment, but seriously if the bartenders don't even attempt to find out who is next then they need a new job.  \n\nOh and what's with the stepford guys that all look the same, and have gay undertones?

Fridays seem to be pretty popular so grabbing a seat might be a problem, but the overall environment is chatty and bubbly so standing up and getting into a conversation isn't a problem. It seems that as a late night place, Harlot maybe falls flat, but for a Friday Happy Hour, I was pretty pleased.", "author": "katie k."}

(This is coming from a bar manager by the way guys I ran three bars successfully for years and never would've let this attitude and outrageous behavior stand) \nI (and my crew of models hairstylists and make up artists) were subject to screaming and threats of being thrown out, DRAGGED OUT and otherwise forced to leave this club, by the head doorman. While I was in the process of putting on a show at their establishment.  Apparently the doorman cant do his job without threatening violence on patrons of the club. Well I should add... he wasn't doing his job very well. We were upstairs using the VIP area for a model prep and we continually had strange men and drunk women sauntering up the stairs to gawk at models and take pictures of people getting changed. I was politely asking people for hours to please head downstairs to drink and hang out while the doorman whose job it was to mediate the stairs was nowhere to be found. Around about oh lets say three hours later he comes storming upstairs and begins screaming in peoples faces (the staff) to get downstairs or get dragged there. NICE. That's a great way to treat the people bringing PATRONS TO YOUR BAR. \nAs if that wasn't enough when asked to calm down and if it was absolutely necessary to yell at people I was told that I could get kicked out too, then this charming staff member went and got his droog the head bar dude to come and \"explain\" his rudeness to us and try and convince us  that it was our fault he was screaming and out of control. (This man was also screaming and the last time I was at this bar he was possibly the rudest bar staff Ive ever come across.) Including ignoring me and other customers to hang out with his crew of friends at the end of the bar and shoot us dirty looks.\nAt this point I was ready to pack up my show and  take it elsewhere because the last thing patrons or anyone wants is to be treated like crap for coming to your bar. \nDrinks here are extremely overpriced,served by people who act like its an inconvenience to take a drink order.  Never at anytime did anyone come upstairs to ask us if we needed anything, or wanted any drinks. Which is traditional for the club hosting your event to do.\nThe musical talents booked here are lacking to say the least, and whomever is the booking agent needs to get out more and check out the SF music scene post 1998. Disco house and 4 on the  floor is great, but do we have to listen to the same type of music all night long. I swear it always sounds like the same record is on repeat at this place every time I've been there. HORRIBLE\nI cant stand the people who come to this place, they are  to say the least a large mob of unintelligent drab office drones. Intent on making asses of themselves and dancing around badly to lackluster musical styling's. Combine with pretentious VIP bottle service people who think they own the place because they bought a bottle of Grey Goose and are sitting upstairs next to the non working fake fireplace. \n I will NEVER attend any event at this bar again, and I will make sure to mention to anyone in ear shot exactly why when asked. \nHORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE STAFF, HORRIBLE MUSIC, attracting crowds of HORRIBLE people...

The downsides are the size, it's pretty small, Harlot gets pretty crowded after 10:30 p.m. and kind of hard to navigate and dance with so many people crowded together.", "author": "Ros S."}

The eye candy is pretty good for both men and women and there is great diversity although the age range is a bit all over the place.

Drinks were considered to be on the pricier side but not expensive by any means; especially when you consider the fact that their drinks were pretty potent. And everyone likes potent drinks. \n\nIn general the club was crowded. It was really hard to dance at all without accidentally elbowing people. This was kind of irritating. I got my friend and I into the VIP balcony upstairs where there was MUCH more room to roam around and dance. VIP balcony area was well decorated and in all white.\n\nWhat surprises me is the negative comments here from guys complaining that they didn't get in. Clubs in any city you go to usually have stricter door policies if you roll in with a group of guys or if you're in a larger group mixed with guys and girls so you shouldn't be shocked that you were rejected or had to wait in line with everyone else. Having an ego or attitude doesn't help you get into the door. \n\nI actually found the door men and security people at Harlot to be friendly, nice and without major attitude.

I like all of it, really, but it's just not a SEXY space!\n\n\n I guess this is my usual reason for taking away stars - I am taking off a star for DISAPPOINTMENT.

Super negative stars for bald Moby wannabe door guy who was on a total power trip. Puhlease, why you tryin' to keep it all exclusive if you let these other d-bags in? This place is worse than Vessel in how they try to create hype outside for a sub-par population inside. We were more than happy to roll up to J. Collins for a happier vibe instead.\n\nSo a warning to the bros out there, you better arrive with a girl guy ratio of like 3-1 and then be willing to be uber nice to Moby if you want a chance to get in. More than likely, he'll turn you down and try to sucker you into buying a table.

It is definitely one of my fave HH places and is super close to my work.  They make one strong vodka gimlet and always have my fave Effen Black Cherry vodka on hand.  I started going here pretty much as soon as it opened and have seen the crowds escalate in the past 2 months. The bartenders are really cool - and I am talking about the guys who seem to work the HH circuit.  I think they save the corsetted ladies for the night shift.  And I never make it to the night shift since I will have already consumed 8 Effen Black Cherry and Sodas and will be sure to pass out by 9:00 pm. And that is what I love about this place, it keeps me in on Fridays and ready get up and go on Saturdays.\n\nPros - Stiff drinks, good bartenders.  The last time I was there with co-workers they gave us cheese plates.  They don't give everyone cheeseplates, but if you ask you may get lucky. Oh, and it is connected to the Salt House which makes for an easy transition for some yummy dinner.\n\nCons - I think this place gets super L.A. at night and is gaining popularity so may get super crowded for HH too.

What it has going for it is the music and the space. It's definitely not a mega-club where you can expect to have a ton of room to dance and party; more of an ultra-lounge where there's space to dance but more space to hang around your table while you get table service or chill by the bar. The DJs have been good during the week and on the weekends - rock, house, hip-hop - a good mix.\n\nThe downside of Harlot is that it's not always a great experience. For example one-time when I went kind of early they were serving some sort of food that included wings and other finger foods, which doesn't really go w/ the vibe of the place. Also, often if you don't go early then you have to deal w/ the bouncer, which can lead to you getting turned away if you're just w/ the guys. Also, the drinks are kind of expensive for SF.\n\nAll in all, not a bad place. But usually if I want to hang around this type of scene, I go elsewhere...", "author": "Michael P."}

Have been there on a few occassions at varying times/days and I can say the place is nicely decorated.  I dig the harlot theme.  There are tables reservable with bottle service or you can be like the rest of the crowd and roam around.  The small dance floor in the back functions well and the glass-encased smoke room is a nice addition.  Although small, the upstairs lounge area is a good addition.\n\nThe one drawback to the lounge/bar is the restroom.  You have to go into a hallway of the building in the back and wind your way into it...and it's shared by Salt House patrons.  Not thrilled about that.\n\nOtherwise, the bar staff are beautiful and mix awesome drinks.

DJ Morse Code is already spinning his fabulous beats so we have a few drinks upstairs before heading down to get our dance on. The place gets crowded QUICK, but since we know a few folks we hop on stage with the DJ and start shaking our little money makers. Friday the 13th never looked better! Then disaster strikes....\n\nI wish I could say that this disaster is something funny or cute or even slightly off-key cute. No, truly a disaster strikes. So Bestie says she's gotta go to the bathroom so we make our way around the corner. We enter the bathroom and I look down and I have blood covering my hands, body, legs and feet. I look at Bestie and she is the same, yet has it on her face and in her hair. True horror story moment. Turns out, somehow, somewhere, Bestie gets cut with glass across her wrist and up the forearm. Blood is everywhere. Crisis mode! I apply pressure while an ambulance is called. At this point we can't wait any longer for an ambulance so the owner's GF gets us in a town car and we race to the nearest hospital (St. Francis) for emergency care. GF leaves us at the hospital and Martel (owner) drives over our jackets and purses that have been left at the scene.

I was able to boob my way to the bar in no time at all and the bartendress happily dumped out several ounces of tequila for my ladies and myself.  We danced, we people-watched, we socialized.  The crowd was awesome at worst...Everyone was friendly and the whole energy of the place was very positive.  As a matter of fact, I had so much fun last night, I'm putting myself on house arrest tonight to give my liver a chance to recover.  Good suggestion Phil and Frisco!", "author": "ellyk E."}

A few months ago I helped plan a bachlorette party and Harlot was on the list of potential places, I heard it was the new hot spot in SF.  Boy am I glad we did not go there.  This place is small, teeny-tiny, if we were playing 20 Questions \"Is it larger than a bread box?\" I'd answer no.  The crowd was LA, fashionable young ladies in fake leather leggings hovering on the dance floor.  I use hover because they couldn't dance in their super high heels.  The door guys, well put it this way, when it comes to attitude, there is nothing worse than a Jersey girl who moves to NY.  This is coming from a Jersey girl, we know attitude when we see it.  We showed up and were let in immediately. It was because we were three girls.  The bouncer specifically asked, just you three girls, right??  Standing in front of the velvet rope was a crowd of guys trying to get in, trying is key.  The place was a quarter full, maybe a third.  I was flabbergasted, ugh typical LA club bulls**t.  When we left 15 minutes later some girl in a small dress was begging the bouncer to let in her guy friends, but its my birthday she whined.....the bouncer held strong, no!  It was ridiculous, I guess having guys stand outside losing their integrity by the second is worth more than 5 guys in your 1/4 filled club buying drinks.  These people actually wanted to be there, we did not!  No I will not be going back.  It has potential but they need to lose the attitude and find a way to grab more space.  By the way the bottle minimum for the tables is a complete rip off, go to Mr. Smiths, you get more space, one bottle minimum and better music.", "author": "Kristin Marie S."}

The bar is just a bar, nothing fancy, no exotic drinks, the DJs were average, the sound system was pathetic and the service was below sub-par. Nothing about Harlot reflected the cost of reserving a table.\n\nThough it tries to be, it is not Miami. Well the whole reserving a table is concept copied from Miami, but they should have copied the entire philosophy behind doing so. In Miami, the clubs always treat their guests with respect and consideration. If you have every been in Miami, you know what I'm talking about. And let's face it, this busted ass bar in SOMA that is failing; just look at all the reviews.\n\nThe Harlot is just not worth it.  We had a $500 table and were treated like second class citizens. We were threatened by a regular at the club and mistreated by the bouncers... not really a fun evening for a small group trying to have a good time. \n\nNext time you are looking to have a good time, I recommend a different venue. The Harlot is a waist of money, and they treat you poorly. No body in our group will ever return.", "author": "Fausto G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "Not being familiar with the SF nightlife scene/club/lounge/whatever else you have, my friend suggested that we go here.  I was all over Yelp prior to taking the Office out for our conference week in SF, and I gotta say - the SF Yelpers are harsh. There are not too many 4 stars and above, so I thought this place would be okay. \n\nWell we went with a big group from our company, and we really had no problem getting in. When we got in, the ambiance was great. There were burlesque dancers dancing along the walls and the DJ posted at the back stage(?) of the club. It fit the name well, and I liked it.  We got our drinks really fast, and I had no idea regarding price cause someone else in our group picked up the tab. The house music that was spinning wasn't really my type, but I think most people enjoy it. And most were having a good time.  The VIP door guy let us upstairs cause we were all Texas exes, so that was cool of him.  But the VIP area wasn't too bumpin if you ask me. But the lure of \"VIP\" made us go upstairs anyway. \n\nThe only reason I give this place 2 stars is mainly cause the door guys were really getting on my nerves. Two of my friends who weren't part of our original group and came separately later on ended up waiting at the door for-EVER it seemed like. There was no reason they should've waited for that long outside when there was NO line and not too many people inside. They were told they weren't on the elusive \"guest list\" which we weren't on upon entry either.  I think the only reason was because they were guys and on their own. I'm not sure if this is characteristic of SF clubs/lounges, but I thought it was quite ridiculous. I know some clubs in Houston often don't let groups of guys in (mainly my Asian guy friends), but I was disappointed in a SF venue to do so. I guess cause I have some elevated perception of the city's weekend scene versus that of the weekend scene in Houston. They eventually got in, but mainly cause we had to beg the guy to let him in, and my other friend's friends showed up as well and the guy was a local DJ who was on the guest list. \n\nI'd probably go back on a hip-hop night and with plenty of girls in tow to ensure entrance.", "author": "Jen T."}

Cool location and surprisingly friendly door man which is the face of the club.  Tiny inside but that adds to its charm.  I wasn't drinking so no first hand experience with the bartenders.  Music wasn't great but more on the night than anything I imagine. Good energy so all and all pretty fun.  Only bad thing was a few super nasty observations of a cocktail waitress.  Problem #1, the place is tiny so its going to suck to walk through with a tray or anything all night.  Problem #2, waitress needs to walk across dance floor to get to tables.  How is that going to be a recipe for success?  Granted I'd be unhappy if I had to deal with that but then again I wouldn't cocktail because of things that make up the job in general.  None of which is acceptable for a patron to experience or observe.  I'm the first to say, \"asshole, just add alcohol.\" SO thoughts for staff or mgt, if you don't like your work environment or you don't have the patience or flexibility to deal with drunk dancers...GET A NEW JOB and save the patrons the experience and save the mgt. having the whole world read about their nasty cocktail servers.", "author": "Todd O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-05", "description": "\"You Know I'm no Good\" should be Harlot's tagline. Amy Winehouse's dark, soulful sound totally meshes with the sexy, sensuous feel of Harlot. Harlot feels badass. You know she's probably not coming home to meet your parents (black leather and naked paintings and corsetted bartenders oh my), but she definitely makes you want to keep coming back for more.\n\nI love New York, and Harlot is the closest I've gotten to it in a really long time. Even the Studio 54-style survival of the fittest line was in place. Oh the nostalgia. On Saturday past 11:30, don't bother coming with greater than a 1:1 guy to girl ratio unless you're prepared to bribe the doorman. (Tip: it helps to bring a girl wearing a low cut top, pull it down a little further than it was meant to go, and get her to stand with her chest pushed out next to the rope. It's not subtle, but you'll be inside in no time). \n\nI loved the fact that the lovely DJ not only was nice enough to dig through his music collection to find my alltime favorite song Hiphip Chinchin, but actually mixed it amazingly with another techno song. It was heaven. Do you even know how hard that song is to find? The DJ was so good, I was dancing for 2 hours and didn't even notice how much time had passed. For all the people complaining about the lack of dancing, all it takes is a couple of people tearing it up out there for the entire club to decide it's cool.\n\nDid I mention they took my request for a chocolate martini with nary a \"what?\" \"how do you make that?\" \"does that involve chocolate syrup?\". That definitely propelled Harlot into its last star. Anywhere that can make my favorite drink without even a quickly suppressed questioning glance has me for life.\n\nPositives: No \"a bay bay\" here, or \"damn girl\" or \"hey shawty.\" If you feel neglected in that area, Suite 181 will fix you right up.\n\nNegatives: The reason people aren't hollering is because they're too self-conscious to risk rejection.\n\nAlso, note to the girls: on Thursday, Harlot's pretty dead so beware the multitude of older men (think 40ish) attempting to be your sugar daddy. A quick \"nice wedding ring\" should do the trick.\n\nWell done, martel & nabiel.", "author": "Lisa V."}

Took a while to get a drink and I don't care how busy your bar is, you damn well better be able to handle a crowded bar...either that or get some more people behind the bar.

Make sure you check out the bar area upstairs, just note that it can get claustrophobic since it's tiny up there. At Harlot we always get our drinks quickly, and the last time we were there the girl bartender was nice enough to hold our drinks at the bar while we went to the restroom too.

I guess the guy cools down and tells me I can stay, but at that point, I am so annoyed that I just want to get as far away from them as I possibly can.  \n\nBasically, if you want to be yelled at by the \"guardian\" of the VIP area\"  and you want someone to go crazy on you for no apparent reason go to Harlot.", "author": "KC G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-06", "description": "I literally created a profile to write this review. I really like to party here. It's a beautiful venue, but like any place it certainly isn't perfect. \n\nBut here is the deal. I've read a lot of reviews (read: whining) about this place by guys who can't seem to make it past the door. If what follows below seems a bit harsh I apologize. It's meant to be more of a cheat sheet than a slap in the face. \n\n1st off: Don't arrive at 8:30!!! There are plenty of places to \"party\" at this early. They're called dive bars. Go get a heater rolling at a hole in the wall THEN go to a club. You standing outside ANY club at 8:30 tells the bouncer that either you are clueless; or you think that the only way you're getting in is to be there ridiculously early. Self consciousness/insecurity is not becoming, only your sister and your mom think that it's cute. \n\nMore importantly: PUT IN SOME EFFORT. Your going out. Don't look like a slob (unless you're going to the mission, I love the mission). An over sized collared shirt is not \"dressed up.\" Try a Vneck sweater over said collared shirt; and maybe push the boundaries of your comfortability by adding a tie (bow-tie for extra points) between aforementioned collared shirt and Vneck sweater. It can't hurt. \n\nAlso: If you are going to grease a palm, DO NOT \"OFFER\" to kick down some cash. It's tasteless and in some cases borderline classless. Simply shaking the door mans hand with a bill neatly folded in your palm will suffice. Think of it as showing them your appreciation for having been done a favor. Everyone likes feeling appreciated. I don't know anyone (besides strippers) who enjoys feeling \"bought.\" Remember the old adage that the more public the favor, the more private the pass? Save the C-note waiving for your daydreams.  \n\nLastly: Keep in mind that while some doormen are total as***les, in the end they keep out all the even larger pricks. There is a reason why you are trying to get into a nice/fun/\"cool\" club: the women, and (hopefully) the lack of an over-abundance of as***les that make meeting people and having a good time that much more difficult. \n\nSide Note: Take this with a grain of salt. But a little attitude adjustment and some of you may be as lucky as I was to meet a lot of beautiful women who were out of my league. I'm about to turn 30, and I'm about to marry one of those women. Just a thought.", "author": "M.F. J."}

I GO OUT TO BARS AND DANCE so that I can infect people with my viral infection. My hacking also keeps the creepy men who attempt to talk to me at bay. TAKE THAT, SUCKER!!! Did I mention that I might have pink eye??? Wait, it has been confirmed; my ophthalmologist told me so today. \n\nMy friends and I walk down Minna St. attempting to find Harlot. We pass by construction zones, bicycle shops, Narnia, piles of dirt, etc. Then all of a sudden a red \"H\" glows like a beacon in the deserted alley and we run towards it. No, wait, we are too cool for that. We stroll towards it. \n\nWe are here at Harlot for a dance party that all of us thought was going to be F-U-N because Going.com told us so and Going.com is always right, right??? Going.com was wrong. The nice and friendly door guy basically told us there was nothing going on inside. He tried to convince us to go in anyway because \"the bar and dance floor are empty. This is the best time to be here.\" Righhhhhhhhht. \n\nPros:\n+The interior of the bar is sort of amazing. Gothic but not of the Hot Topic  variety. The place is dimly lit and has 2 floors. There are oil paintings on the walls and ceiling. Cow hide couches and throne like chairs are scattered around on the lower floor. Think of Medieval Times but about 10 shades darker. I sorta wish I had a crown on my head, a giant turkey leg to chew on and a goblet full of wine. \n+Nice size dance floor.  I basically could have spun with my arms outstretched like a helicopter and still have had enough room. Maybe it was because there were only 10 of us on  the dance floor.\n+Good DJ set from the drummer from Every Move a Picture. Yes, I will dance to and sing  to Interpol's \"Slow Hands.\" How fitting, Harlot would probably be a place Interpol would hang out at.\n+ A friend of a friend is the coat check girl here. She sits in a little room/closet as she watches over your J.Crew sport jacket. She is very talented.\n\nCons:\n-There were free vodka drinks from 8-9pm. I got there at midnight. Cynthia=sad. Who goes out and drinks at 8? I start at 5:31 when I get off work. Yes, I am an alcoholic.\n-It was a slow night. I thought the best time to go out was midnight but apparently everyone is in their flannel pajamas at home by then. It was also a Wednesday night which meant everyone stayed home for America's Next Top Model and Gossip Girl. My sister did.\n-The crowd. This place seems to attract mainly the older after work crowd. I guess this place is more like a lounge instead of a dance party kind of club. People occasionally did look up from their drinks to watch my friends and I dance. FINE! Sit there and watch!  I will chomp on this turkey leg AND dance. I am a multi-tasker.\n-The girl who had her dress hiked up to her hoo-ha so she could get closer to her boyfriend. When I mean closer, I mean have sex. Thanks.\n\nOverall, an \"OK\" experience. I might come back Harlot if only to fulfill my dreams to live one day in a gothic castle.", "author": "Cynthia L."}

We needed two tables which would have been $1,000 or more.  The \"VIP Services\" reservationist had the audacity to request that our party (mostly guys) be evenly mixed between guys and girls in order to be let into the club with no problems.  \n\nWhat a bunch of douches.

I know this place has gotten a lot of bad reviews, but it seemed fine to me. Do check it out if you like Trance/Electronica.", "author": "Tushar V."}

For one thing parking is really easy to find.  If you can't get one on the street (which I did) then there is a lot right across from the club.  There is also a smoking \"patio\" but it's pretty small and it can get nasty in there with too many smokers.  Drinks were easy to get as I never had to wait too long for the bartender and the music,  well this was probably an exceptional night because it was an Om party for Samantha James' cd release so it was all house.  From what I know other nights aren't always all house (my preference).  The bathroom might be a bit hard to find because you have to go to the\n\"Exit\" door and there are no signs.  The sound system isn't bad but it isn't great either.  The crowd is a bit more trendy and upscale than I like it to be, but the way Harlot is positioned that's the type of crowd they will draw.

The first time I went was back in May with work people and we got a table up in the mezzanine section so I didn't really get the full experience of the place.  There is no bar upstairs, only waitresses that service your table, but the plus is that there is a bathroom.  The bar is decorated in sort of a Gothic theme and is very, very dark.  It's not plush at all, but nice enough.  \n\nLast Friday I went with two girlfriends and arrived around 10:30pm.  There was no line or cover.  The place was comfortably packed, but not so crowded where you can't get a drink at the bar or move.  The bartenders are pretty speedy and drinks costs aren't cheap nor are they too expensive.  One apple martini and two vanilla vodkas and Cokes were $24.  There are no seats to sit down on (typical for a bar like this) unless you book table service.  But it was okay since I had planned on staying for only an hour or so.  The music was terrific!  It was very fun and danceable.  There is a small dance floor towards the back of the room near the DJ.  Only a small number of people were dancing since Harlot's not really a club, but more of a lounge.  I felt the crowd was relatively attractive compared to other clubs in the city.  Parking can be hit or miss in the area, but there is a flat fee lot right across the alley (literally 15 feet from the entrance) that is $10.

I gotta throw my 2 Yelp cents in about Harlot.\n\nYes, Harlot is an almost painfully trendy/shi shi hot spot in SF, trying to claim and maintain exclusivity with LA-ish/upscale clientele.  Whatever. That's beside the point.  What REALLY matters here:\n\n- No cover.  \n- The bouncers are cool.  The bouncer that most folks complain about is the one that looks like Kid Rock.  But if you're a chick - and, even better, if you're a chick sportin' something short and cute - he'll let you in w/o any trouble or drama.  Last night, our crew consisted of 4 girls and 5 guys, which isn't the best ratio.  But, the girls and I chatted up Kid Rock + the other bouncer and, after a few folks exited Harlot, they let us in.  \n- More than a handful of tall guys there. Oh. Mah. Gawd.  Somebody pinch me.  A club in SF where a majority of the guys are NOT at eye-level to me?  I'm not saying they were my type (too pretty, too pretentious, too much hair gel and too many dang blazers) but, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually had to look UP to make eye contact.  \n- DJ Zhaldee + DJ Solomon, among my Top 10 favorite DJs in SF.  If you want some dope and danceable hip-hop, house and Top 40, go when either one is spinning.  I done mama proud last night and shook what my mama gave me, almost hurt myself dancing.  \n- It's kind of refreshing to see so many hottie women in cute dresses.  The typical jeans/dressy top outfit will get you in but, you might feel slightly out of place at Harlot.\n- Lovely interior. Swanky.\n\nNow all I have to do is examine and comment on the bartenders.

I was with the only girl with 3 guys.. odds were against me. Anyhow, we turned the corner and opted for drinks at Salt House. One of the guys heads to the bathroom, comes back & says Harlot and Salt House share it, we can head over to the Maxim party just walk the opposite way. So we head over the guys walk across to the Maxim party while the bouncer at the door stops me and won't let me in. SERIOUSLY? I thought it was the funniest thing.. only in fuking SF I swear ... I don't argue, I honestly don't care and at this point, I'm ready to head home. I go outside to catch a cab, no cabs I start walking towards the \"W\", I eventually end up there after being hit on by every Tom, Dick and Harry along the way.

They would not let us in even though we were there for a birthday party. Stood outside, while no one else was in line, and they still refused to let us in because we had too many guys.\n\n3) It was our friend's birthday party. She had a decent sized group. Part of the reason they didn't let us in is that they said her party was too big. Please heed that warning if you ever want to have a birthday party at this location.

We had a mixed crowd of men and women. We waited for more than one hour at the front of the unmoving line. Although the bouncer was minimally not-too-rude, the manager/supervisor (who was also outside) was rude and completely indifferent to the (at least) couple dozen of us who were waiting to get in, stating that the club was just too full to let other people in. While we waited, a lot of people who had ordered bottle service arrived and were let in (legitimate) and the manager, rather crudely and rudely, stated that all \"the girls\" could come in....maybe (not legitimate). Our guy friends, including the birthday girl's boyfriend, would have to remain outside.\n\nWe left after shivering outside for around 75 minutes, never having gotten into the club. I have little use for the idiocy of places with bullshit sexism of \"girls\" being allowed in while \"men\" have to wait outside. (Yes, I'm well aware that many \"trendy\" places catering to the heterofabulous crowd do this.  I just watch and comment on the bullshit.) Aside from that, I DEFINITELY have no use for any business, of any sort, which treats patrons as dispensable. Yes, they may not need all the patrons queuing up on a Saturday - but those same patrons, if treated well, may want to come back on less popular nights (or to order bottle service, book the VIP room, etc., on another weekend - things I'm not averse to doing for special occasions).

Seriously, a business should care more about customer service. First of, the bartenders are NOT FRIENDLY and need to go back to bar school to learn  that they are supposed to ACTUALLY ADD ALCOHOL TO A $9 DRINK! The staff is completely inexperienced and immature.

My girlfriend and I wanted to party since we were already dolled up, so we decided to try Harlot since she was curious.  We arrived down the street since the club entrance was in the alley.

Entry was simple, since we were 2 chicks, but after that, things started to go downhill for me.  Granted that usually I liked hanging with the asian crowd, the diversity of this place was sufficient, but I began to get flashbacks to the mid-western town I grew up in.  It felt like a trust fund kid's playground/frat house.  Majority of the population consisted of upper suburbia/yuppies, and when I say yuppies (flash to pretty in pink where guys are wearing polos and a sweater over their shoulder tied right in front of their chest).  Shudder...next the dj (dj sam issac) was a newbie..or at least he played like one.  The dj was switching back and forth between different types of genre along with after playing a fast song, would go to a slow song.  I mean, what good dj does that?  If you want to keep people happy, you get them dancing on the floor!  Besides that, he didn't know how to spin, so in between songs, you'd hear silence.  Lastly, though the place was small, but nice decor and clean, we did get hit on.  I remember the guy introducing us to his friend b/c it was his \"friend's birthday\"...could I not have felt like one of the girls on the show The Pickup Artist and just have fun with my friend?...Please guys, if you're going to try and pick girls up...be smoother and at least funny or interesting...", "author": "Eling H."}

When I expressed my feelings to the staff, then told me to be quiet or go upstairs.  At a place where the drink prices are at the higher end, the dance floor is small, and the music is average, you expect a little more friendliness from the staff.

But, it still maintained a modern look with its sleek couches and chaise as well as a simple facade for both bars. One of the most notable things this place will be known for is the smoking area, which is a glass (floor to ceiling) room that opens up into a porch...keeping the smokers in touch with what's going on inside. Plus, all of the tables have a picture of a fashionista as its tabletop which I'm sure will add to many a conversation. And even though it has an upstairs area, the space is pretty small so I can see it getting crowded pretty quickly! The drinks were good though...my cosmo was great and my bf's drink was strong, so you know they don't skimp out on the alcohol! Tanqeray and Johnny Walker were the drink sponsors the night we went but since I don't care for either, I decided to pay for my drinks! :p Overall I think it was nice and I'd probably check it out again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-02", "description": "I went here for New Years Eve. It was okay. Bar is fine, but the place feels quite small - plus an awkward dance floor. For $50 a person, I was expecting something far more extravagant. DJ Sam Isaac was spinning some pretty weak stuff. Going to Slide the week before was so much more fun. The location of Harlot is pretty shady...if you go the wrong way towards 1st, you'll run into some slightly aggressive homeless folks. Go somewhere else.", "author": "Jay E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-18", "description": "The decor and ambiance was so beautiful very burlesque, and fitting since Harlot basically means whore.  We were admittedly one of those groups of girls that the door man looked at and let in right away. Nice but still cheesy. We got there around 11pm and the place was relatively empty. However the people that were there were quite attractive, and even though the after work crowd should have gone home by now some delicious men in suits were still lingering. This was a pleasant surprise. By midnight the place was pack-ola. But the later crowd seemed pretty bridge and tunnel. Drinks WILL cost you an arm and a leg. The bartenders are punky and fun. The music was retarded. My six year old niece could mix better.", "author": "Anna F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-10-10", "description": "it really isn't a place to dance. \nit took a while for the crowd to start dancing and the first couple of hours were just unattractive ppl dancing. \nthere were way too many old men checking out people from the second floor and that was a bit creepy. \ni was with a big group of ppl and had reserve seats and one thing that got me was the waitresses would stop by and constantly checked on your drinks and wanted to take them away if they got empty. it was almost every 5 mins. this really distracted us from having a good conversation so I was not really pleased. \nalso when i started dancing, the bouncer asked me and my friend to get out for a while. i knew that i was drunk but i clearly knew what was going on so i didn't like how i couldn't have the choice to just stop dancing and go back to my seat. I guess it really was for older crowds. I'm too energetic to dance and I didn't fit into this place...very sad. The drinks were okay, overall you should see this place as a lounge and not a place where you can dance and move around a bit. I learned my lesson.", "author": "sarah m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-18", "description": "we had HUGE expectations for this sultry SOMA hot spot...... even as we were leaving the office yesterday our coworker yelled  \"oh yeah, you girls are going to loooove harlot!\". we were excited. we wandered down the alley and saw the red scrolling H above the door...... finally. we sauntered in and looked around. not bad, cute space. immediately loved the dramatic windows and dark gothy colors, plus its intimate. it was friday night and packed. i wanted to go up to that loft area perched above the bar, but was wearing a very short dress last night and got nervous about going up those stairs with so many guys standing down below. instead we got comfortable lounging with some goose & tonics in the crowded area right in the center of the room. the men were ok. not bad.... so we tried to work with the situation. we sipped our cocktails, socialized with everyone standing around us and yelled at each other over the music. inevitabley it was like a balloon slowly deflating though, we just got bored. something was missing in the energy here...... we were barely there for over an hour and it seemed like forever. sorry we tried. the people seemed to be a mix of corporate slaves drowning their sorrows from a long work week or guys scoping the crowd for a hook up.... typical for a friday happy hour i guess, but not really what we were looking for on this particular night. so... as pretty and provocative as the artwork was to look at, we just didn't find our groove here. we fought our way up to the bar to close out our tab and left our weakly made drinks on the table. then we moved on to Johncolins..... you know, a fun bar. sorry harlot, but i'm really easy to please. especially with a cocktail in my hand. one more thing i would like to mention: as we were exiting this place, the door guy offered his hand to make sure we didn't fall going down the step. a very nice touch... will give them another shot later. i can see potential.", "author": "Michelle I."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-09-10", "description": "The people who work at Harlot are pretentious, rude, seriously lack customer service know-how, and have their noses waaaaaay up in the air.    This past weekend, my friend had planned to have a birthday party here.  When we got to the door, they finally told us that not everyone who were expected to come will be guaranteed to get in.  This is after knowing for some time the number of people that were expected and after weeks of correspondence. Not once did they tell him that this was a possibility.  As my friend was trying to explain his dilemma and confusion to the hostess, she haughtily turned to the doorman and rolled her eyes.  Is this not enough reason to never come back to this place?  They obviously are greedy for their patrons' money (otherwise, they would have told him of the situation), but they have no concept of valuing their customers.   If I could, I'd give this horrible place ZERO stars.", "author": "Josephine V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-12-13", "description": "Perhaps the owners need a dictionary or thesaurus. \"Harlot\" conjures images of plush decor and furniture, deep/warm colors, and a risque environment. The actual club is instead, a cold, sparse, warehouse of a room. A couple semi-nudie pictures does not a harlot make. To make it worse, the DJ seemed to have trouble with the concept of spinning one tune into another, often leaving the platform for 15-20 minutes at a time leaving a song or a pre-mixed tune to entertain. This happened all too much in the space of a few hours. The drinks were not well made enough to make up for the overall disappointment. I think everyone is pretty much onto the scam of keeping a long line outside while the inside is empty. Everyone knows this, it seems, except for club owners. The spirit of a harlot was only carried out by a a majority of girls in skirts so short it made me wonder if it was sanitary to sit in the same spot that one of them just vacated.", "author": "Maria Y."}

Wasn't terribly impressed with the power trip door dude that had \"THE LIST,\" we called ahead for a birthday party of 10 girls- told we couldn't be on a list unless we bought two bottles ($600 minimum-kiss my ass!) then ended up calling a friend of a friend that worked there to help us out. We got there and got in without any prob but the people who came later in our group got the \"you're not on the guestlist treatment.\" When they offered to pay to come in they were told \"guestlist only.\" When we were told earlier there wasn't a list. WTF? We're not UGLY. In fact, me and my friends were probably the best looking group there. Sometimes San Francisco just needs to get over itself. Anyways to make a long story short- VIP area looking down on you is simply retarded. Charged a difference price for the same drink on 3 seperate occasions. The glass smoking cage was plain weird. Bartender chicks not that hot, sorry, and the music was all over the damn place. Oh and the crowd... BARF. I've seen more attractive people at the DMV for Christ'ssake. Only reason this joint gets 2 stars is because the drinks I got poured were semi-decent and there was plenty of parking once you actually find the alleyway where this place was located. Probably not coming back unless I absolutely have to though. I'd rather go to a dive over this place.", "author": "Danielle M."}
