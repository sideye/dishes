I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I am so happy to have this little piece of home out here on the west coast. I go here almost every weekend during football season for the Steelers games. It gets very packed and is a lot of fun as the place is FILLED with west coast Pittsburgh fans. I recommend this place for any playoff sports game really. The Steelers' playoff games are so much fun here. It's loaded with people and tons of TVs for the game. Lots of fun and good drinks w/ a nice selection of beer.\n\nThe bartenders are cool & it's an interesting one or two steps above a dive bar but has the feelings of a dive bar. The place is also decked out with Pittsburgh memorabilia. \n\nThe Food! They're somewhat of a loving copycat from Pittsburgh's famous Primanti Bros, as they feature the same frenchfry&coleslaw stuff sandwiches. They're spot on with it too. Man these sandwiches are so good. You can't go here without ordering a sandwich.\n\nI love this place and it's one of my most frequent spots since I've moved here from PA.

Coupled with the great happy hour prices ($1 off draft and select bottled beers), you've got yourself a winning combo. My friend and I split an order of the wings (which were solid) and shared the pastrami and beef sandwiches. 1/2 for each of us.

I heard they had an\"primantes\" style sandwich which had coleslaw and frieson the Sammie  with your choice of meat on it. We had chosen the Turkey sandwich and Chicken Verde soup which was a Chicken tortilla like soup. I particularly liked the soup because it had great flavor and had a little kick. Since it was a bar/ restaurant, I had also ordered a beer on draft. I got an IPA called Heroine which was tasty. Waitress was really friendly and didn't bat an eye when we rolled in with a bunch of teenagers.

Needless to say, as good as the food is, the staff (one of the guys) there (ain't what it used to be) was a bit rude about not saving seats when clearly its only for people who \"look\" to be the kind of customer they want.  So apparently I'll be watching Warriors/Giants/Bay Area sports games elsewhere.\n\nProbably all the people from North Beach who think they are better than everyone else.", "author": "Cliff S."}

The bouncer is a really friendly dude since he let me in, I'm 20 so one more year. There are 5 tv's in the dining area and tv's in the bar area. The food options are great too with fries wings among other things. My friends and I chose to order their specialty: Pittsburg sandwiches. I went with the coppa while my other friend went with ham. The fries added great flavor to it, but it was pretty salty. Definitely need a cold one along with it. This was the first sports bar I've been to in the city. \n\nReally glad I got to watch game 6 of the nba finals here too! The atmosphere is lively and enjoyable.

You need to order double meat for a normal portion, which is not cool. Hot Cap with double meat and a fried egg is fairly substantial. White bread that must be a flyover country specialty. Never seen wonder bread used before in SF in a restaurant. Food seems like something we would perceive Midwesterners to eat, but not bad if you order right. I am guessing food will be soggy if taken to go, keep this in mind. Coleslaw will soak through the bread quickly\nLosers that work here generally seem unhappy. They are too old to have this job and take it out on customers. Bar menu is great, best thing about the place. Seems to be a hopping sports bar more than a great place to eat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-12", "description": "So I usually don't leave reviews because for me, whether the service is good or bad, the tip I leave is telling enough.  I am not knocking people who do, but i usually tell the cook or chef they are great in person or give a fellow patron a suggestion when I am there, based on what I have had in the past.  \n\nHowever, the experience I had at Giordano Bros on Sunday night (12/11/16) was way too negative and I want to make the management aware (when I asked for a manager, I was told there wasn't one on duty).\n\nWe sat in the far right corner close to the restrooms and patiently waited for service.  We could tell it was busy, so we were understanding when our waitress took some time to give us menus and take our orders.  Anyone who has ever worked in the restaurant industry can understand the struggle when things are short staffed.  We were a group of 4 and we decided to order some sandwiches and finish the Giants and Cowboys game.  Drinking alcohol was not something we were doing because Santacon was the day before and much like other folks who may have participated, we were recovering.  \n\nEnter a second waiter, who ultimately ruins what was suppose to be a pretty laid back evening.  \n\nHe initially greets us, which I thought was pretty cool.  I thought they were about to pick up the service after some staff confusion.  I can respect a slow start with a strong finish.  He then comes back a second time, but during this interaction he asks us if we had ordered a beer from the bar, which was a firm \"no\" because this was our post santacon recovery day as i mentioned earlier.  He continues the interrogation a bit, asking if we were sitting in a nearby booth previously and aggressively asked \"what's on your tab right now then?\".  We tell him our sandwich orders and he says \"ok\", so i'm thinking theres some more confusion in the back that he needs to clear up.  We let it go, but we mentioned among ourselves that it was a bit uncalled for.  \n\nWhen he comes back the third time, something must have made him snap.  He came back to our table with a pissed off look on his face.  Usually waiters who bring out food, verbalize the particular orders that they have in their hands, but he was just standing there with the same angry look on his face.  When we ask him, \"what do we have here?\", he tells us \"I HAVE ONE WITH FUCKING FRIES, AND ONE WITH FUCKING ONION RINGS\".  I almost wanted to laugh because it was so outrageous, but we told him who each order belonged to and he then angrily slammed all the orders down on the table.  \n\nSo to review the experience.. we didn't get greeted until 20-30 plus minutes of our arrival(this is ok we know its busy), we get interrogated because the male waiter probably thinks we are people who walked out on the bill earlier (people who dine and dash usually don't forget to \"dash\"), he uses profanity when he comes out with our order (I could have let this go, i'm a big boy i've heard bad words in my lifetime), but slamming the food on the table was too disrespectful.  It was also uncalled for, because we obviously weren't the people he was looking for and we're also ridiculously sober.  This is ironic because if you knew us, that is not usually the case with this roster.\n\nOur original female waitress circles back with us and we tell her what happened and she was very apologetic.  I think what makes it worse is that when she asks the male waiter about what happened, he tries to lie about it and make it seem like he innocently put our orders on the table and we were overreacting for no reason.  I would have respected him if he at least owned up to what he did or kept cussing at us and showed some conviction.  \n\nWe end up not touching the food and walking out, which I regret hardcore because the sandwiches looked great!  We also apologize for causing a bit of a scene.  We had one member of our group that was irate after everything that happened (his review should be up by now). We were a relatively quiet group that was talking amongst ourselves the entire time.  Our female waitress can also confirm that we were in the same spot for the entirety of our time in the restaurant.  Even though she kindly offered the food to be on the house, it didn't make sense for us to take it.  \n\nThis would be a 1 star review if it weren't for our waitress who was great.  She was doing her best with the resources that she had.  It's sad that in this scenario the waiter who was suppose to back her up, ended up losing her a table (I noticed that a group of 9 or more people next to us also left after the male waiter interrogated them).  She also followed us outside to continue to apologize, even though it was her coworker who should have been doing that.  \n\nThere are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from in the area, and I was disappointed that I received this kind of service at a place that came highly recommended.

And good Lordy, did I have a great time going to town on that gorgeous morsel of heaven-sent meaty goodness. Any of my compadres can tell you I am a lover of sandwiches, and I need to have chips or fries with said sandwich. So the thought of having that combination in one dish was a tad mind-boggling. \n\nI sipped on my cold Gin and Tonic as I waited in the warm outside seating area, chatting with my dining companion about this 'n that. Suddenly, from the dim depths of Giordano's bounds a young tattooed man, holding two shiny silver trays with sandwiches piled HIGH, only failing to fall apart due to a trusty toothpick, skewered through the center of each half.\n\nI split my sando apart to survey the melty cheese, oozey egg yolk, hot Capicola, fresh, crunchy cole slaw, and crispy French fries. I smooshed my sandwich down and bit in. The Capicola was rich, salty, and decadent. The cole slaw added a refreshing change from the meat. I loved it, fully. My friend had a Pastrami sando without the egg, which was good, but mine was way better, he even said so himself.\n\nThen we played shuffleboard, they have a full length table inside, $3/hour for play time, along with tons of TVs for ample sports viewing, the bartenders are super friendly, there was a guy with a little dog, oh man, it was just the best place ever!

Scratch that, how can I forget about Kaepernick? I think the ESPN photographer forgot to have him turn 45 degrees to the left. *coughFULLFRONTALcough* Hey, a girl can only dream right?\n\n\"Yelp Queen, go find us a place to watch the game\", my friends said. \n\n*Shrugs*\n\nShiet, while I may know my restaurants, I know jack shiet about sports bars. \n\nGiardano Bros (GB) was listed under \"sports bar\" on Yelp so that's what I suggested and crossed my fingers that they there was actually a TV. You know one without an antenna wrapped with foil to enhance the reception. I would never hear the end of it since GB sounds more like an old skool type of joint. \n\nWalking into GB, we were welcomed by a packed house with multiple flat screens everywhere. Just in one part of the dining area we were in, there were 6-7 TVs. There's also another dining area, a bar, and an outdoor patio. Only two bathroom stalls here so expect a long wait for the restroom during game day. \n\nWe came an hour before the 49ers and Green Bay Packers game and snagged the last table. I was pleasantly surprised that the crowd was very diverse and not hipsterville like the rest of this stretch of the Mission. I didn't see one skinny jean in sight. Come to think of it, how can one fit into skinny jeans with the food they serve anyhow?\n\nGB are known for their all-in-one sammies (13 varieties) which are stuffed with fries and coleslaw. They also have other bar food like pierogies, wings, fries, onion rings, and fried pickles. Unlike most parts of the Mission, the food is NOT overpriced. For example, their sammies and shots (Jameson) are $7 each. During Happy Hour, Monday - Friday from 5 pm- 7 pm, beers are $2 off (tons of beer options). \n\nInstead of order a sammie for myself, my friend and I decided to get one sammie, double the meat, and add an egg to share. The Hot Cappicola ($6.95 + $2 add'l meat + $.50 egg) was our poison: http://bit.ly/1alakc7. I normally like to eat all my food separately but the fries and the coleslaw worked exceptionally well together. The tangy coleslaw helped to balance the richness from the spicy cold cut and egg while adding some crunch. My two gripes were the fries as the didn't taste fresh out-of-the-fryer and the egg didn't have a runny yolk but it was good nonetheless. My friend ended up ordering another sammie for himself so GB definitely serves up man food here. The other two dudes annihilated theirs. \n\nA must order are their Beer Battered Onion Rings (L - $4.95): http://bit.ly/1albS5E which tasted like Funyuns but so much better of course because there's actually a silky sweet onion wrapped around the crunchy batter. \n\nI cluck for wings and I would have clucked for more of GB's (10 piece - $7.95) if they weren't so salty: http://bit.ly/1d0wYXf. They otherwise, were pretty meaty and had a good crunch. \n\nAside from solid food and good prices, GB offers excellent service. Food orders took about 10-15 minutes despite being slammed.

GB was insanely packed and there were only 3 waitstaff for the entire place but she still took the time to check on every single table and make sure everyone was ok.

Each TV is labeled with which game will be shown. That was nice when choosing our seat.\n\nWhen you have a menu in hand, there are several waitresses available to take your order. (This is a good system they have here, very fast drink/meal ordering)\n\nWe figured out the system and in less than 2 minutes a waitress showed up to the table we had selected and we gave our drink order: Beer selection is very solid. Something like 15 solid brews on tap and about 20 bottled beer selections. They have house made cocktails as well, that looked pretty intriguing.\n\nThe menu is really simple: pick what type of meat you want on your Pittsburgh style sandwich.\n\nThe food:\n\nI picked the pastrami sandwich.

You don't want to hear anymore beyond that night. \n\nBut I do enjoyed the second Giordano's bar much better than the original North Beach location. This one is more of a sport's bar than a North Beach deli/restaurant. It all depends on what you like. \n\nWith twenty-five (25) gourmet domestic and imported micro-brewed beers on tap and my left eye on a college football game and my right eye with an offensive friendly World Series on the huge TV, what is there not to like?\n\nI had the Deuschutes: Green Lake Organic Amber Ale. For $6.00, the Oregon-micro brewed beer has a smooth and crisp taste in a frosty mug. I actually enjoyed this beer very much. I'm due to go to Portland, OR sometime next year and may find this brewery. If not, I know where to get that unique beer close to home. My beer: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/X43AJ7rTKiAS0vuuKRNVjA?select=ZWNkk8BV-IHYkYlAYPVvPg\n\nI also added a small order of Cheese Pierogies to nibble on with my brew.

Loads more tvs out here, and separate bar and dining areas. This place can get busy, and they generally only have one person working each side of this place, so don't expect super fast service. The food comes out really quickly though, which leads me to believe that some of it is pre-made and just re-heated, especially because of their specialty sandwiches that include slaw and fries. I'm sure they have huge batches of their fries waiting to be piled into their sandwiches when things get busy. Huge beer selection here (indicative of where you're at versus NB) with rotating drafts and guest taps. That's definitely an added bonus over their NB location, but you know what you're getting - a huge sandwich (thick white bread) with vinegar, fries, and slaw.

So I went to the bar and told the Bartender your waiter did not tell me about the wine, can I change it. At that point the bartender gave me an attitude and did not say sorry for the misunderstanding. My friend arrived and we went to the bar and as we were looking at the menu I notice they had well drinks on the happy hour menu. At this point I have  not had a drink from from my glass of wine and ask the bartender can you put my wine glass aside and I will pay full price for it because I would like a cocktail. The bartender said you can't stock up on happy hour drinks. I explain to him what the waiter told me about your HR menu. Again the bartender repeated himself with the same comment. Ok I'm a grounded person but I held back from being his mother. At this point we just left. Shame on you young man for not acting like a gentleman and a person.

Randomly walked by last weekend and happened to notice a server being totally rude to some customers outside, noted. When we came for dinner we ended up getting the same server but I didn't realize until we were leaving and talking about how bad the service was, I had a sudden aha moment.  There's a hand painted notice on the wall that says seat yourself and it totally blends in to all of the other stuff written all over the walls. We stood there clueless for like 5 mins wondering why were being ignored before we noticed it and followed directions.  After sitting, I noticed every single other group that came in did the same thing and I watched our moody server look at them annoyed and then ignore them. Oh god forbid customers don't read ur dumb sign, maybe if 10/10 stand there clueless- it's not us, it's ur sign. \nI could go on and on about the service but eff it, let's talk food. \nThe sandwiches screamed, yearned, NEEDED that damn bread to be toasted!! Come on! It was falling apart and the sloppy slaw inside and pile of other ingredients were busting out! Speaking of slaw, while it is refreshing to see a vinegar dressed slaw, the only flavor this had was sweetness, needed more acid and seasoning. The meat wasn't very tender and just not that tasty but the worst was the fries. I reeeally think they are using Yukon gold potatoes which are a roasting or mashing tater not a fry tater. Too sweet, creamy and moist. They make weird fries. It took us so long to get our check that we stood up and considered just leaving without paying. I won't be back and it's unfortunate because the atmosphere and outdoor seating was nice, I liked the brewery atmosphere, reminded me of home.", "author": "Emma H."}

It seemed that there was only one waitress. Bad sign, should have gotten up a left after we were sitting at the table for 10 minutes without as much as an acknowledgement. \n\nBut just as I was about to suggest that we walk out, the waitress arrived at our table. \"Ready to order??\" No hello, no smile. \n\nSo we ignored the rudeness and proceed to order since we were all hungry. My friend had a question about one of the sandwiches, and my poor friend had such an attitude answer from the waitress. A big sigh and rolling of the eyes type of answer. At this point we were just fuming. THEN she got two of our orders wrong -- turkey sandwiches came out instead of steak sandwiches. AND my friend was missing the fried egg that was supposed to accompany her sandwich and had to send it back to the kitchen. Not very good for business, if your waitress messes three out of four orders. Three wasted sandwiches. \n\nAnd by the way, the sandwiches weren't that great either!

After all, what's not to love about good food, your choice of good or bad beer, and people who manage to remain polite in crowded situations? Sadly, most of us who choose to seek our fortunes elsewhere have to leave this experience behind save for the occasional trip home to see the parents over Christmas.  In the heart of SF, though, we can still gather at Giordano Bros. to come together as Steelers nation and grab dinner with one hand, leaving the other free to toss back a brew or wave a Terrible Towel.\n\nThe staff has always been super friendly, every time I come in. Even when the place is crowded it's possible to get food or drinks without too much effort. The bar is stocked with all the beer or whiskey one would need, and your food dollar goes a pretty long way here.  The only anomaly longtime Primanti's patrons will notice is the lack of tomatoes on the sandwich. I am willing to overlook this and give the place top marks.

Maybe the layout makes it hard for a lot of the seats to see TVs? They have a bar side with TVs above the bar where you can watch the game but unfortunately that side didn't have my game on (Eagles...Steelers weren't playing so that wasn't the case).  We sat at the other side in the corner and it was very hard to watch the TV in the middle of the room.  My bf had to watch his game through the reflection of a picture.  They have long, high tables that sit ~10 that you can share with strangers.  I mean, an alright place to watch the game...\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the food. I had eaten before at the location in North Beach and I remember liking it in my drunken state.  I tried the hot capicolla (~6.50) sober at this location and it was two chunks of white bread w meat, cheese and fries inside.  It was just kind of bland.  I guess the spiciness of the capicolla gave it a bit of a taste, but I wasn't a huge fan.  We also got an order of pierogies. I was super excited to see 'homemade' pierogies on the menu, and for $6 I was excited and expecting 3 giant ones.  Instead, you get 3 the size of Mrs. T's (you could get 2 boxes of Mrs. T's at the store for $6). We chose the combo (sweet potatoe, cheese, and pepper and cheese or something) and they were so greasy that you could hardly taste the real flavor.   \n\nSo, chill little joint, cool location, nice place for a beer/watch the game, but not a fan of the TV placement (maybe they just need more...replace the fish on the wall) and not a huge fan of the food (we should've listened to the waitress when we asked her which sandwich she preferred...coppa or capicolla...and she said neither). Maybe I just need to try it w different bread if they have it bc I'm past white bread after eating all the great bread in this city.\n\nLastly, okay selection of beer (about 9 on draft, but like 6 IPAs...yuck~ I like my hefs so had to go w Hoegaarden...but they serve it in a nice tall glass).", "author": "Jessica S."}

Here they make all-in-one Pittsburgh style sandwiches that are made with your choice of meat, coleslaw, and french fries on a soft sourdough bread. So if you're the type of person who likes to cram your side dishes into your sandwiches (or even if you're not) you'll love the selection of tasty sandwiches at Giordano Bros. I tried the Coppa sandwich and instantly fell in love. The french fries add great crispy texture to each bite and the coleslaw is just the right amount of tangy.\n\nI heard this place really gets poppin' during sporting events (note: does anyone actually use the word 'poppin' anymore?) Anyway... my group arrived shortly before the end of a playoff game in which the Pittsburgh Penguins lost, so the mood was surly at best... definitely NOT poppin. You ever been to a funeral attended by a large group of drunk people waiting to attack anyone wearing the opposing teams' colors?? Something like that. If you're a sports fan you'll understand, so I'm not going to deduct any points for that today. Better luck next time, guys.\n\nSo we stood in a corner anxiously waiting for some Penguin fan to stumble out so that he could cry into his ketchup stained Lemieux jersey in privacy. The place cleared out and the waitress was quick to clear a table, offer us menus and take our drink orders. You gotta love fast service like that. With the tension decreased we were soon surrounded by chatty locals and other visitors who had made the trek to enjoy some delicious grub. Then we all lived happily ever after...\n\nNo, wait, hold on a second.... I should mention that this is a Steelers / Penguins bar so if you want to show up on Sunday wearing your Niner red and gold, or your Raider silver and black, you'll be disappointed to know that they give priority to Pittsburgh games. \n\nOverall, great food and a good selection of brews, and the atmosphere was perfect for a night out... that's all you can really ask for, right? Oh! AND most importantly, the bathroom was clean. You heard it, CLEAN. I don't know about you but bathroom cleanliness is a big thing for me, and after my visit / inspection, you can literally rest easy knowing you'll do it in a clean environment. \n\nThey have another location on 303 Columbus avenue, so if you're ever in the city try this place.

The menu is short and to the point with 10 different sandwiches, as well as few add-on's, and side dishes. I debated on either the turkey or the steak and went with the latter.\n\nThe steak sandwich for $7 is a flavorful bargain. The sandwich itself: two thick pieces of French bread, sandwiched between steak and melted cheese, coleslaw and fries. When I heard the fries were IN the sandwich, I was hesitant, but decided to not mess with their formula. I'm glad I didn't. The end result was amazing. The coleslaw was not mayo based, but instead was drizzled with olive oil and pepper. The fries were crispy and not overstuffed in the sandwich, and somehow, someway, the sandwich held together with the French bread.\n\nIt's no wonder why Giordano Bros. always has a steady crowd. The sandwiches are excellent and the beer selection is top-notch. Furthermore, the prices are more than reasonable, especially for the quality of food.

The fries are pretty good (it's hard to mess up fries) but the sandwiches...man. The combination of white bread, greasy meats, mayonnaise-laden cole slaw and fries should taste delicious, right? But it doesn't. It's like the worst of all possible worlds: heavy, bland, and gummy. \n\nI have no problems with drinking beer in a pleasant patio on a hot day. I just wish the sandwiches -- which is basically the entire menu -- were tastier. \n\nMy theory is that the sandwiches are basically designed to sell more beer with the minimum investment in sandwich ingredients. White bread, fries, slaw...it's all pretty cheap. And they save in volume by varying only the meat inside and not providing different condiments or vegetables. It's a good racket, I guess. And most of the customers don't seem to be complaining. So while I'll never be going back to Giordano Bros, I think they'll probably stick around.", "author": "Elizabeth G."}

Having lived and gone to school in New England, I adopted them as my second home team. Plus, Tom Brady is a Bay Area native!\n\nThe bar spans across two different rooms, and one room had a huge projection screen showcasing the game. Additionally, there are about 5-7 LCD flat panels all throughout both rooms of the bar. There are not a lot of tabled seats in the left bar, but the right part of bar has a lot of seating. You'll also see a large list of the beers on tap that this establishment carries on the right side.\n\nBeers seem reasonably priced. I had a couple drafts of a Guiness Dark. Made a large order of Chicken wings and that was enough for 3 dudes to snack on during the game. The Chicken wings came drenched in BBQ sauce, which was a Gift & Curse all wrapped into one. The sauce was good, but it was just so much it was gooping all over the place. What's that Carl's Jr. motto, \"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\"?\n\nAnyway, the bar filled in with a lot of over zealous New York Giants fans, and the Patriots threw a Hail Mary pass on the last play of the game. Rob Gronkowski was 2 ft from catching it and that was the end. I came head held high.

Now that's comfort food. Grad school and those Primanti Brothers sandwiches are a long way off, in Pittsburgh to be precise. But with Giordano Brothers now in residence in the Mission, those good memories are just a few blocks and a few bites away. They definitely know how to make a good Pittsburgh-style sandwich. The fries are crisp, the slaw is cold snd tangy, the bread is soft and cut thick, and regardless of which one you choose, you need both hands. My double egg was delish. I also enjoyed the pierogies, which were topped with sauteed onion just the way mama Mikus used to make them. I kind of wished for a bit of sour cream, but it was ok to go without. With all those tvs and guys in plaid, I almost felt transported to the south side or the Strip district. The Pittsburgh experience would have been complete if only they had some Yuengling on tap, but I don't think it gets distributed this side of the Rockies:( My Scrimshaw pilsner worked just fine, but it just wasn't the same. We had pretty good service. I especially liked the guy from the kitchen who was super excited about the pierogies. He rattled off several other kinds he makes that weren't on the menu. All of which sounded pretty yummy. Thinking about pierogies also got me thinking about the pierogie pizzas from Church Brewworks.

The history behind this sort of sandwich was that it was made for truckers, who always had one hand on the wheel and one hand on the sandwich.\n\nGo for the Coppa. Salty pork that was almost serrano ham-like in flavor, along with sweet and fresh coleslaw that wasn't overly mayo'd or vinegar'd up, hot french fries that were thicker cut, yet still crispy, and a tomato slice for more freshness sandwiched between two pieces of white bread. This thing was amazing. A lot of heavy flavors from the fries and pork being balanced out nicely by the slaw and tomato. I recommend putting a ton of crystal sauce... crystal sauce is freaking awesome. My only gripe was that the white bread got mushy after awhile... but man this thing is good.\n\nThe onion rings were also very good. Crispy beer battered circles of awesome.\n\nThe periole? I don't know how to spell it, but its similar to gnocchi inside a ravioli. Freaking delicious. Potatoes combined with garlic and parmesean cheese, steamed, then pan seared, create this amazing doughy/garlicky/potatoey goodness.\n\nThe chicken wings were fairly standard, but very vinegary, so if you're into that stuff, you'll love them.

The chicken wings, which we are also kinda snobby about having lived in Buffalo, smelled legit.  Will have to try those next time.\n\nService was good.  Waitress was very busy and apologized for the long food wait.  She filled my soda several times as we waited so we gave her a nice tip.  Tell those cooks to move their lazy butts!

We came in to the new Mission loc on a Wednesday night with no major sporting events so Giordano's was mellow. For the Pittsburgh style sandwich, just stick to the Italian choices, Hot Capicola or Coppa. We got a good inch of sliced meat (winking at the cook on my way to the restroom paid off apparently). It's a whole meal in itself and the balance is perfect with salty meat, French fries, and tangy coleslaw. \n\nThe most expensive sandwich is $7.50 and totally shareable. In a town where a normal deli sandwich is the same price and adding an egg onto anything is $1 (an egg sheesh), here it's 50 cents extra. Not a big fan of the white crumbly sliced bread, but it doesn't look like they'll be changing the formula for Californians who prefer whole grain, cracked wheat, sprouted seed bread. I just had an idea that next time I'll flip my sandwich upside down as soon as I get it so the top dry piece of bread gets some juicy meat lovin' too.\n\nPierogi come in all different forms and Giordano's is like a potsticker dumpling filled with potato or cheese. I loved the dough but at about $2/piece, my curiosity has been satisfied. Wings were spicy and messy and we even got an extra one. I was super full but I can't believe I missed the all-in-one cookie with rice krispies, choc chips, and peanut butter... I'll be back!", "author": "Mimi L."}

The place is very clean, very friendly, lively, but laid back type of atmosphere. Even when it gets crowded, there is usually somewhere to sit. There are tons of TVs, although the ginormous projection screen is pretty low quality, Especially in comparison to the ones they have at other places like Jillian's. That being said, they have 65\" HD TVs on the wall and the atmosphere and prices are a million times better, so I'm not complaining. \n\nThey have a vast beer selection, which is true of many places. What is different here is that they have a variety of local beers that most local connoisseurs have never even heard of. Personally though, after discovering the Grand Teton red ale, I am completely sold! The beers are $4 and up for pints, Happy Hour is $1 off pints M-F from like 4-6 I think, don't quote me on that. Pitchers are a slightly better deal, maybe save you $2-4. \n\nThe food menu is the only reason they lose a star. They mainly focus on \"Pittsburgh style\" sandwiches. That's cool. Didn't know Pittsburgh had a sandwich style. The problem is that they just aren't very good. At least the one I tried wasn't. The coleslaw on the sandwich thing, that just made everything really soggy. I know this will make me very unpopular here, but I just really prefer the Philly style of sandwiches much better. The fries were pretty bad too. Moreover, the food is pretty over-priced for what it is. I would have ordered the hot wings, but the price tag was just way too high. \n\nDespite my food complaints, this place is pretty dope. I don't really go to bars to eat, but if I can find a place that has good food, good beer, AND good football, I am in heaven. For now, I'll settle for this.", "author": "Miguel V."}

I like places that allow for cheering and booing. (places that have sports on and don't allow for patrons to be loud should perhaps not serve alcohol)  Ample seating, The items on the menu were perfect for watching the games and eating.  \n\nHad Buffalo wings and 2 of the \"Pittsburgh all in 1 sandwiches\", 1 was turkey and 1 was pastrami.  Both came with melted cheese and a nice non creamy slaw and FRIES, all on very soft yet crusty Italian home-style bread. (Very good sandwiches, the slaw and fries together are a nice pairing)  The wings were tangy and with just enough kick. Had a bottle of ginger beer that was a good refreshing washdown.\n\n All of it was reasonably priced and prepared rather quickly.  \n\nDo go if you want hands on food, loud and interactive sports viewing, \nDon't go if you want to use silver ware and seeking a quiet quaint PBS atmosphere. \n\nNot 5 stars because I am a Raiders fan and this wonderful place is I think owned by steelers fans.", "author": "F And J Consolidate D."}

Definitely not fine dining but terrific if you want some bad for you food.\nWent here with 3 friends.  We just wanted beer and salty snacks. I like the space  --- it's welcoming. Service was very personable - patient - attentive --- we liked our guy. \nWe split the egg sandwich, some pieroghis, fries, and a side of wing sauce. \nThe other kids also spilt the coppa and sausage sandwiches. The thought the sausage sandwich was the bomb. \nI liked the egg sandwich - you could taste the contract in ingredients/texture - eggs/fries/slaw-  slaw probably could've used a little more salt. And the bread is perfect for a hearty sandwich -  I rarely eat sandwiches/bread and this was worth the calories. \nI don't eat chicken wings but I love the sauce.  Their sauce is the bomb - made with Frank's Hot Sauce. Much better than ketchup with fries! \nThe pieroghis were pretty good. Decent filling to dough ratio.

The idea of french fries in a sandwich has intrigued me since I got a doner sandwich somewhere in Greece.  Let's do it American style now.  Sadly, the Giordano sandwich had everything rocking besides the meat.  The fries, coleslaw, vinegar and pillow soft bread all worked well together, but the roast beef was ever so limp.  Perhaps I should have gone with the Coppa or Turkey.  The onion rings, like the sandwich, was piled mile high.  Though far too low on onion and a little too high on batter.  So why four stars?

One bartender who was in the weeds from the beginning of me sitting down at half time for Monday night football (7:30ish pm). The Steeler's weren't playing and the place was truly dead. I managed to catch a drink during the \"rush\" 10 minutes in. \n\nProceeded to order a standard sandwich off the menu with my beverage (the Coppa @ $7.50). Being from Pittsburgh I was momentarily excited to get a taste of home. I gave a double star to this review because of the price, cheap sandwich. Unfortunately the fresh Coppa with it's crispy fries and juice slaw came to the window and there she sat. I truly believed it wasn't my sandwich because it came up pretty quick. But there it sat as I watched it die throughout the 3rd quarter (about 40minutes). The sammy that I hoped and prayed wasn't mine was presented to me as cold as I thought, about the time I was finally asked if I'd like another beer.  \n\nWhat a waste of a good setup. Great location, great menu (Pittsburgh style) and the original in North Beach isn't bad.

After I asked politely whether kitchen was still open at 8:30pm, I placed an order for wings.  She paused and said \"Uh, I guess\"  when I asked if I could have a half-and-half sauce on my order.  Strike!  About an hour later, there were still no wings, so my friend went up to ask about them---since the bartender had already forgotten to give him the beer he ordered half an hour before.  He said the bartender would be able to comp some of the cost, and she even came over to apologize.  Said she'd be able to take half the cost off the wings, which was more than sufficient.  At this point, I didn't care about the cost, I was just wondering what the hold-up was.  I felt pretty bad for badmouthing her beforehand, and gave a sincere \"thank you\"....but when I went to close out the tab, she let me know that I had to pay full price AFTER she swiped my card and gave me the receipt to sign.  Walked out of there flabbergasted, and am never going there again.", "author": "Andres G."}

I had steak, and they put cole slaw, oil and vinegar and crispy frenchfries on each sandwhich, and the bread is thick, fluffy, and sweet. Was not expecting such a good sandwhich at this price point and I had a seat on a wall booth with a pillow to watch a football game while eating. Staff was very generous and checked on us periodically to make sure everything was to our liking. Definiely recommend this spot to anybody, the looks of the place are welcoming like cheers but may imply the food isnt great but it really is amazing! great food, great help, great price, right by all the tourist action in dt San Fran!", "author": "Joey G."}

The bar is loud during Steelers games, but pretty chill and not douchey at other times.  This place is my new weekly hangout. Convenient location that beats going up to North Beach.", "author": "Rich L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-12", "description": "The sandwiches are good portioned..not too big and not too small. We shared a hot sausage sandwich, a hot capicola sandwich with fried egg, large beer battered onion rings with ranch dressing as a dip and a large order (6 pieces) of potato perogie with a side of sour cream dip.  \n\nThe sandwiches are a great mix of crunchiness with the fries and the sourness of the slaw..great combo and different from your traditional sandwich. The beer battered onion rings were done perfectly with the perfect crunch while the perogies were a bit interesting as it was my first time trying it..it's a bit bland & doughy for my taste.\n\nCasual sports bar atmosphere with bar stool tables and big screen TVs surroundings.\nStreet parking is not great but plentiful if it's not on the weekends.\n\nI gave this a 3 stars because of two incidents on service. The place wasn't busy, they had 4 tables and the waitress came by to check in on us soon after our food was brought out but didn't offer refills on our fountain drinks so we figured there's no free refills..one would think that all 4 drinks are tapped out with a table full of food that one would be thirsty? So I decided to ask and the waitress took 3 of our glasses to refill..the only problem was, not all of their glasses are the same..some glasses have 'Steelers' printed on them and some without..when the glasses were returned to us filled with our original straws and at after much sipping, I realized that my glass initially didn't have the word 'Steelers' on it and noticed that the glasses were swapped with my friends glass. First reaction was ew but it's ok since we're all friends but still, ew. Can you imagine if your glass was swapped with a stranger? \n\nFor those of you who may think, well, maybe she replaced our glass with new ones..negative. If that was the case, we'd probably get new straws. Again, stressing the ew factor.  It makes me appreciate restaurants that refills your glass by either coming to your table with a pitcher or giving you a new glass/straw altogether.", "author": "Sophia M."}

Sooo good, I get a side of buffalo sauce (always, whenever, wherever) and choice of any meat.  Good place to grab a beer and watch the game also.", "author": "Emily M."}
