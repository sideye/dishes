They put in a lot of effort into their ice cream making process and it shows. We were served by the owner herself and she let us try so many flavors. \n\nGarden Creamery has some unique flavors like salted plum,  pandan coconut, hojicha, and jasmine milk coffee, and those were just some of the dairy flavors! There's vegan and dairy-free ones which would appease my mom who's allergic to dairy #blessed #thankyougardencreamery. I personally loved the matcha and aube pandan as a huge matcha fan. \n\nTLDR flavors are diverse and great, prices are reasonable, bathroom is clean, service is friendly, and their long production process shows in the flavor.", "author": "Lizzie S."}

Just the right texture: not too crunchy and not too soft. It didn't have too much sugar on it so that if you order a sweeter ice cream it wouldn't be sweetness overload it would be just right! Basically this cone was perfect if you want something new and different to try, but in general I'm not a fan of cones in general, but I would make the exception for this edible cone! So good!\n\nAs for ice cream, all the flavors I sampled were delicious! I tried their matcha flavor (delicious! not too strong or sweet), their roasted matcha (also delicious, like matcha but with a twist. I think I preferred the regular one better though), I also tried the thai tea (amazing! especially because they made it non dairy so that was great in itself.), the black sesame flavor was pretty good, and the mint was delicious as well and slightly tasted different then most at different ice cream places, but in a good way. I ended up going with classic mint just because at that moment I felt like getting that but I definitely would've ordered thai tea and matcha at another time with a chimney cone again :)\n\nCustomer service was great, and quick even though there was a line out the door. Its out the door because of how popular this place was and also because the floor space is kind of small- limited seating but enough for a least two big groups to sit in the back and a few more people by the window in the front.", "author": "Kelsey Y."}

My main reason for coming here was to try out their chimney cone, which is only available from 2-4pm I think. From a different location, I've tried one before yet Garden Creamery's cone pleasantly surprised me. It was really soft and fluffy with a hint of citrus. Super good. \n\nI chose the salted plum flavor for my single scoop and it was really good on it's own. Sweet and salty, but it didn't necessarily mesh well with the sugary chimney cone. It's a solid refreshing flavor and something different to try too. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed both. $8 isn't that bad considering how much you get and how much it fills you up. I just recommend getting a complementary ice cream flavor if ur getting a chimney cone.", "author": "Leslie S."}

I came here on a sunday at about 1pm and it was pretty empty (though I was told it's SUPER busy on Saturdays 2-4pm when they have their chimney cones). It's a super cute shop with a few tables and seating by the window. The service was great, she let me try as many flavors as I wanted and even suggested some! There are so many unique flavors- they have seasonal flavors (like ones based with fruit), a main selection, and few flavors that are on rotation every few days. \n\nI got a single size black sesame and mango sticky rice ($4.60... $4.50 for dairy, and $4.75 for non-dairy and I got one of each flavor) in a sugar cone (no extra cost, $1 more for a waffle cone). The black sesame is so good, with a strong flavor that's not overpowering. The mango sticky rice though was by far my favorite. It's dairy free, but you couldn't even tell!!! It was so creamy and weirdly reminded me EXACTLY of mango sticky rice, which is my FAVORITE dessert. Absolutely loved it. I don't know how the ice cream could be so creamy yet so light! \n\nI also tried the \"Flavor King\" Li hing- which is like sweet/salty plum- which reminded me of home (I'm from Hawaii and we put li hing mui on everything....I also found out the owners are from Hawaii). The matcha toffee was also good and the matcha had a strong matcha flavor. Thai tea tasted exactly how thai tea tastes- not watered down or anything! The Kalamansi lime was a new one they had on rotation which had a strong lime flavor- good but personally not my favorite. Strawberry fields was another good one that was very creamy and fresh. The Cardamom had the PERFECT balance of spices and I was so tempted to get a scoop of that one as well. My friend also got cookies and cream which she loved and is also a classic.\n\nI will definitely be back to try more flavors (and maybe get a chimney cone!)", "author": "April L."}

It's so adorable and has many unique Asian-influenced flavors. The workers were also very friendly and encouraged us to try as many flavors as we wanted (I was grateful that they didn't make me feel like a burden for trying things). It was incredibly difficult but I ended up choosing li hing plum and black sesame because both were WEIRDLY accurate to a childhood memory flavor in a way that I can't describe, especially the plum (and I've had black sesame ice cream before but I've never felt so ..viscerally connected to childhood in that way before?

Like Salt and Straw, the crew here highly encourages you to try ALL the flavors you're interested in.  This was my first visit and they did not need to tell me twice, haha.  I sampled the nian gao, ube pandan, black sesame, macapuno and banana lilikoi (passion fruit).  Unlike Salt and Straw, I find Garden Creamery's flavors to be interesting AND delicious.  While I admire Salt and Straw's creativity, the actual execution of flavors usually leaves much to be desired.  Garden Creamery, on the other hand, actually delivered on intriguing flavors.  Sample after sample of perfectly captured favorites... I honestly still can't believe they got nian gao so spot on!\n\nAfter my sample frenzy, I decided on the ube pandan in their signature chimney cone.  At first I thought I would only order it for the 'gram, but I began to unravel and dip it into the ice cream and ended up finishing the whole thing.  One tip - there's a hole at the bottom of the cone and your ice cream will drip through; make sure to ask the people at the front for a bowl.\n\nThere are some seats inside, but you'll more than likely take your ice cream to go.

Ultimately I just chose the flavors that I liked best and guess what, they were dairy free! \n\nThai tea- favorite #1! This was so amazingly creamy and it definitely made me feel like there must've been some sort of full fat cream in there\nMango sticky rice- favorite #2! I'm not sure how they made this but it actually tastes like mango and sticky rice\nHojicha- you can definitely taste the roasted flavor but was abit strong for my taste\nMatcha/ pandan with ube- super yummy!

It also helped that the waffle cone was fresh and added a nice crispy crunch to later bites.   \n\nOn another visit I had the hurricane popcorn and mango sticky rice which were also amazing.

Is it my favorite ice cream spot in SF? I can't say. You see, I don't feel qualified to judge, since I'm not a huge ice cream person and haven't tried some of the classic spots such as Mitchell's, but it definitely was very good and I walked away impressed..\n\nI came on a Saturday afternoon as their chimney cones are only available from 2-4 every Saturday. It was a day in SF (i.e. perfect ice cream weather!) so of course there was a line out the door when my friend and I arrived around 2:30, but the line moved at a decent pace and we were at the front counter within 30 minutes.\n\nPrices were as follows:\nIce cream: 1 scoop (1-2 flavors) is $4.50, 2 scoops (2-3 flavors) is $6.75\nSorbet: 1 scoop (1-2 flavors) is $4.75, 2 scoops (2-3 flavors) is $7\nChimney cone with scoop is $8.50\nSugar and cake cones are free, and waffle cones cost an extra $1\n\nThey had other items too, such as popsicles and ice cream sandwiches, but I didn't look too hard at that side of the menu.\n\nI tried a number of flavors of both the ice cream and sorbets, and while everything was delicious, t I was instantly blown away by a flavor called mango lihingmui. I didn't know what lihingmui was and tried it out of curiosity since I love anything mango flavored, but it turns out it's the Chinese sweet/sour/salty dried plums I grew up eating and absolutely adore. This flavor mixed with the mango was phenomenal, since the sourness of the lihingmui perfectly balanced the sweetness of the mango. \n\nI immediately decided to get a chimney scone with the mango lihingmui flavor, and spent the next 20 minutes very enjoyably finishing it off. To be honest, if there was any special flavor to the chimney cone, I could not taste it over the mango lihingmui, but I did enjoy the texture which was slightly crunchy on the outside but soft and doughy on the inside. \n\nI liked that were was some limited seating inside. My friend and I got lucky as a table opened up right as we were paying, so we were able to leisurely enjoy our ice cream inside out of the sun.\n\nParking in this area is all street (and metered along Mission), so good luck finding something!

We sampled a few flavors, but decided on the hojicha. She normally doesn't like ice cream, but inhaled the whole thing even the churro cone that the ice cream came in. The few bites that I managed to come up with, I noticed that the ice cream captured that distinct roasted tea taste, while maintaining a silky smooth texture. That is how you know it is good when the ice cream has that perfect balance of flavor and texture when consuming it. Staff was friendly and seem to really enjoy helping all the customers sample the unique flavors. There were so many unheard of flavors probably because all the ice cream was made in the back.

It was much more fragrant and smooth whereas I've found Mitchell's version to come off as too sweet at times. The Japanese Milk Coffee was also great. Tasted like Milk Tea in ice cream form!

This ice cream shop has many asian inspired flavors such as matcha and hojicha(both types of tea); they have ube, and many other flavors.  They have a vegan ice cream section which uses coconut milk to substitute the regular milk base.  \n\nOn Saturdays, they have a time where they have the chimney cones, which is a pastry in the shape of a cone and covered in cinnamon sugar.  It is often likened to a churro, but the texture of the pastry reminds me more of asian bread, which is fluffy.\n\nI tried the Ube and pandan ice cream in a chimney cone.  The Ube flavor was distinct and the pandan flavor made this different from other ice cream shops which offer Ube.  It was quite delicious.  The chimney cone was slight hard to each with the ice cream as it towers over the pastry.  The cone itself was quite fragile, so be careful not to squeeze too hard.  The cone also has a small hole on the bottom, so if you eat slowly, you will drip(like any other cone). \n\nOverall, a welcome addition to the many ice cream shops in San Francisco!", "author": "Jacky C."}

I have bookmarked this place because of their CHURRO CHIMNEY CONES! Yes, their famous log-like cones are deliciously cinnamon-sugar'd and fluffy. Apparently they are only on sale on Saturdays midday like 2 to 4PM, but we've been after 4PM both times and they still had chimney cones--AND both were hot days. Anyways, get the chimney cone just to try it...but I think the fun factor is what I paid for. I have no desire to get the chimney cone again, so I just get the regular cone which allows for 1 or 2 scoops for the small size. How generous.\n\nThey have a variety of flavors from matcha gold (matcha and toffee bits) to sour plum and thai tea. I am obsessed with the ube flavor, and we got that scoop with the sour plum. The combination is delicious AND the colors are so vibrant. I also like the matcha gold, even though I'm not a fan of toffee. They have a variety of matcha flavors like hojicha (roasted green tea) and genmaicha. I've had their black sesame and pumpkin (seasonal) too. It's like a neverending stream of flavors...how exciting! I am always excited to see what different flavors they're cooking up. It's great when your local ice cream shop serves the variety you want, but keeps them edible and delicious too.\n\nBecause I stay in Mission a lot, I think Garden is my #1 ice cream spot. Bi-Rite is just not my favorite texture--the ice cream always melts by the time I walk to Dolores Park...and a lot of other places are pricier, and scoops are just too small. PLUS the greatest thing about Garden is their service and people. The owner's birthday was very recent. She is clearly loved by her workers and neighborhood friends--we sang happy birthday to her, her friends brought her a large cake and they shared it with us!! RANDOM CUSTOMERS! It was so sweet. I have seen the same workers working on both weekends I have gone, and they are always SO patient and kind...which is the HARDEST thing to do in a ice cream shop. Tip them, smile, and be friendly.

I mean, check out the line at Bi Rite... what's Bi Rite?--ask that and you'd probably be shunned out of all SF social circles in existence.\n\nBUT, that also means SF loves to overrate ice cream parlors too.  And in this case, CRAY CRAY overrate.  Yes, in some ways we all drink the same juice--as long as it looks old-time modern, has a slight hipster flair, and triple the correct price, and most importantly serves flavors you cannot pronounce, you probably got a winner.  Doesn't even matter that the strawberry ice cream tastes less flavorful than Dreyer's/Breyer's from Safeway, let alone whatever non-GMO organic free range free lovin' college-learned cows were used.\n\nA single scoop of ice cream will cost you $4.50.  Two scoops?--damn... hope you are tech salaried cause you're out $6.75.  Your kid wants a cone?--$1 more........ oh wait....... that's actually reasonable!\n\n1. [Strawberry Something]:  As I said, it was probably the worst strawberry ice cream I've had besides the cheapest of the cheapest that you buy in bulk.  Most importantly, it had little strawberry flavor.  Secondly, there really wasn't any fruit, though I guess it's not a requirement.  Really don't get how you could screw up strawberry ice cream!?!?  Anyway, it sucked.  1/10\n\n2. Agua de Jamaica (Hibiscus Punch):  This was actually pretty good.  Definitely taste lots of jamaica flavor, exactly how you would think it would taste.  And I guess that's the thing--it's just jamaica flavored ice cream.  $4.50 for one scoop?  6/10\n\n3. Banana Salted Caramel:  I like this one too.  The banana flavor is very strong, yet inoffensive.  Tastes like real banana too, not some crappy artificial flavor.  However, neither of my 2 friends nor I could taste the \"salted caramel\" part.  7/10\n\n4. Mango Rice:  Yeah it tastes like mango.  Couldn't tell you what prompted them to add \"rice\" to the name.  3/10\n\n5. Brownie Supreme $8.00:  Two scoops.  Brownie chunks.  Drizzled chocolate sauce.  I have to admit, their brownie is damn good--extremely moist and rich.  Anyway, otherwise nothing all that special.  5/10\n\nBottom line--it costs more than 31 flavors, perhaps has some more exotic flavors but most are hit and miss.  And costs more than it's worth.  I think I'd rather go to 31 flavors, but admittedly it would be like going to Whole Foods after Amazon drops their prices--then I wouldn't get that I'm-better-than-you feeling no more.\n\n2/5\n\n#icecream #sanfrancisco", "author": "Dean C."}

The white honeycomb shaped tiles and bright seating area cushions manage to be simple yet aesthetic. The owner and employees were all smiles, cracked jokes, and I enjoyed seeing them interact with regulars. It was very warm and gave me a sense of community. \n\nAs for the ice cream, very good flavors. There are several Garden Creamery staples, as well as seasonal flavors. I would usually prefer ice cream over sorbets, but the Earl Grey tea sorbet was my favorite flavor. It tastes like an earl grey milk tea, and is very creamy. The texture is almost like ice cream! \n\nAnother flavor I loved is Matcha Gold. It's got a pretty strong, almost bitter matcha flavor, which is offset by the toffee bits. The combination is excellent because it's still creamy and not grainy at all. I really wanted to try the Hojicha and Genmaicha, but they weren't available to make room for the holiday flavors. My friend highly recommended it, so I'll trust his (good) taste and say it's probably pretty good. There's a holiday flavor that's a spiked eggnog (called Santa's something, forgot the name whoops) that was also pretty good. I didn't get to try the chimney cone, but if you're interested, keep in mind it's only on Saturdays from 2-4PM.

As mentioned, wth their widespread selection, I decided to go with the guava habanero in a chimney cone. I think separately, they taste pretty good, but together, it wasn't the greatest. The kick from the habanero and the cinnamon just didn't mesh well. It was my poor judgment thinking \"ooh! I like guava\" and \"I want a chimney cone!\" would work well together. Just wished it didn't melt so quickly that I felt like I had to rush to eat the chimney cone. \n\nAnother time, I came and tried their black sesame and that was pretty good!

It's incredibly difficult to find a non-dairy flavor that isn't simply a mango sorbet -- I sprung for a single scoop with the non-dairy fresh mint chip and banana lilikoi, which had passion fruit. You're allowed up to two flavors with a single scoop and up to three with the double scoop. My boyfriend went for their dark chocolate, ube, and strawberry flavors.\n\nAlthough the chimney cone looked tasty, we really couldn't justify paying $8.50 for one scoop in it. It might be cute for the 'gram, but the fresh waffle cone tasted just as good. All of the non-dairy flavors are delicious and creamy, rather than being icy and disappointing, and I find that the fruity flavors were the best of the batch. The banana lilikoi was nicely tart and my favorite of the five flavors I was able to taste.

(There serve their ice cream in traditional cone options as well as in a cup). The chimney cone made for a nice IG, but it was super good.

My favorite was the Japanese milk coffee, which took coffee ice cream to another level for me. They offer a handful of non dairy based options which I found to be just as tasty as the dairy based.

This is largely due to Bi-rite having years of fame + prime location next to Dolores, but I'll take the shorter line a couple blocks away from Dolores for ice cream that tastes just as good\n\n- Vegan friendly: Yes! For those vegans, lactose-intolerant, and those looking for healthier options, you hit the right spot. And they're not limited to just a few flavors, there's a whole SECTION dedicated to it. Thai Tea, Early Grey, Kona Coffee, just to name a few. Flavors that usually have dairy in them. A++\n\n- Chimney cones aka CHURRO cones: Saturdays only! These look large, but you only get one scoop because the churro is so soft and fluffy that it cannot sustain two scoops before meeting its demise on the ground. I was VERY surprised at how good these were. It was warm and fresh - fluffy on the inside and crunchy with the perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar on the outside. For maximum eating pleasure, get a paper bowl so you can lay it down and rip the cone to eat the ice cream at the same time (too barbaric? ... we did make a mess). Worth the $8.50 IMO! \n\n- So many UNIQUE flavors: I am in love with Ube and it is a shame it is not served nearly enough as it should be. They also do a creative job at mixing different flavors together as one flavor, for ex: Saffron Rose, Thai Peanut (with Coconut), Strawberry Lychee\n\n- More seating: And a bathroom!

The hojicha was great but the lychee black tea definitely stole the show! It was sweet and fruity but had enough flavor from the tea to balance everything out.

At 2:30, the line wrapped around the corner but the wait wasn't long at all (roughly 10 minutes). Two employees to help sample each flavor. I really regret not trying more flavors (felt bad...) Matcha and black sesame are sooooo good though. Didn't care for the ube. Unfortunately, you can only get one scoop (I really wanted both on there HAHA) per chimney cone. \n\nWhile the ice cream flavors were delicious, the two didn't necessarily compliment the cinnamon cone. My friend thought vanilla might be a good flavor... I think strawberry might be a good one! Anywho - I'm sure you won't be able to go wrong with any flavor. We still killed it super fast because it was really delicious. \n\nI am hesitant to give Garden Creamery five stars because at $8 per cone, that is one expensive ice cream dessert.

They have unique and inventive ice cream/sorbet flavors with lots of them being asian-inspired. The flavors I chanced upon are as follows:\n\nMatcha gold - I almost always order a matcha scoop if one is available. The matcha was on the milder side but the nugget provided a nice bite.\nJapanese milk coffee - you know the plastic bottle coffee with the white cap you normally buy at the Japanese market in Japantown? It tastes exactly like that.\nEarl Grey - very lovely and potent.\nBanana salted caramel - you definitely have to love bananas because every lick is like a banana smoothie. So good.\nFresh mint chip - not that seafoam green goodness but that yeah-you-bet-I-made-this-by-blitzing-a-handful-of-fresh-mint-leaves.", "author": "Lisa Z."}

They are known for the chimney cone, which is basically a cinnamon-dusted bread roll, that is available on Saturdays. The chimney cone was $8, and I couldn't justify spending that much for ice cream, so I opted for the regular small scoop on a sugar cone. \n\nI tried all of their tea flavors, including earl gray, thai tea, matcha and hojicha. The flavors that most stood out to me were the earl gray and hojicha; the other two had only a faint tea flavor. The ice cream consistency was smooth, but nothing too special --to my surprise, the thai tea flavor was actually somewhat icy when I tried it. I decided on the hojicha and the ube, which was a vibrant purple color. The ice cream tasted good, but it was honestly nothing special.\n\nThe lines were also super long!

Just comparing the black sesame flavor with the one at BiRite, I get much more black sesame flavor with less sugar and it's a little more grainy so you get more of a mouth feel for the sesame in the ice cream. \n\nToday I got the Mango Li-Hing Mui and Guava Serrano. Wow o wow that Guava Serrano is fantastic!

The toasted sesame flavor paired nicely with the creaminess of the ice cream. \n\nEarl Grey - I was surprised by the prominence of the Earl Grey flavor. Usually the subtly of the tea flavors get lost in the ice cream but the Early Grey is forefront and not an aftertaste.\n\nGenmaicha - Similar to the Earl Grey, I was surprised that the tea flavors were so prominent.

We sampled the majority of the flavors available (we shared samples kkkk, we weren't thaaaat annoying!), and they were honestly ALL good!! \n\nA single scoop can have two flavors, and I ended up with matcha toffee and hazelnut crunch. Very generous portion sizes here! I found the ice cream incredibly creamy-- perfect texture. It wasn't too sweet, yet still flavorful at the same time. I can't wait to come back to try other flavors I haven't yet!\n\nService was also super friendly, and our lovely ice cream scooper constantly encouraged us to sample other flavors and gave suggestions. Oh, and the churro cone is only available Saturdays 2-4pm... I wish they had it on an everyday basis, but I believe they make it fresh and it takes a while to make.. so I guess it's understandable.\n\nWill be back, for sure!", "author": "Kris C."}

Literally one of the best ice cream experiences I have ever had in my entire life. I'm not sure how they make their ice cream, but dang they do it well. \n\nI dropped by just before opening time (3:00 pm) on a Wednesday. There were a few eager souls *like me* waiting at the door, but not much of a line. Once the doors opened we were all greeted warmly and allowed to sample a plethora of flavors before deciding on what we wanted. The great thing about Garden Creamery is that they have something for everyone. There are a variety of flavors from thai tea to cookies and cream and there are a good amount of dairy vs non-dairy options. You can enjoy your ice cream in a cup, cone, or chimney cone (only during certain weekend hours). \n\nCake and sugar cones are free whereas it is $1 for a waffle cone. I ended up getting the thai tea (non-dairy!) and the japanese milk coffee in a waffle cone. First off, I was thrilled that my waffle cone was literally still warm! Definitely made me feel like I was getting something fresh for that additional $1 charge. I say that the waffle cone is a must! It was flaky, buttery, and sweet. It held together well and didn't overwhelm the ice cream in terms of flavor. \n\nI highly recommend this place to basically everyone who likes eating delicious food items.", "author": "Lakshmi M."}

A lot of my friends on Instagram have been raving about this place and they did a good job doing PR work so I figured it was worth a shot. I arrived about 20 minutes before 2pm so the place was still pretty empty and they let us try samples until we knew what we wanted. They had 3 different matcha variations and we decided the Genmaicha (matcha with toasted rice) tasted the best and decided to get that for our order. With the chimney cone, you can only get 1 flavor which was unfortunate. It's also a whopping $8!! It is without a doubt overpriced. \n\nWe then patiently waited for it to turn 2:00 while the place got more and more packed. There is only a few counter seats and about 4 tables so the place doesn't accommodate large crowds easily. I figured the staff knew how to handle the large crowd but it was so hectic and there was no line formed by the time the chimney cones were coming out. The cool thing was that we could see the cones being made in the kitchen through a window. Luckily, I got to make my order quickly before everyone else because I had come in before the rush. I then ate it as quickly as possible because it started to melt so quickly!! To be honest, the chimney cone actually tasted better than I expected - it was doughy inside like bread, which is my favorite. It wasn't good enough for me to come back and I do think they should work on their organization of handling crowds for the future.", "author": "Catherine S."}

There is a great variety of flavors here with many asian/hawaiian inspired flavors as the owner comes from Hawaii! I definitely enjoyed the ube pandan, black sesame, matcha gold (which was matcha with toffee) and japanese milk coffee flavors. The ice cream was rich, creamy and flavorful.

The Hazelnut Crunch tastes like a cross of Nutella and a Ferrero Rocher so basically freaking amazing. The little bits of hazelnut also provided some nice crunch and texture. The hoji-cha had a delicious roasted taste and had a natural sweetness from just the tea flavor so it didn't feel too sweet on the tongue.

I would've like a more authentic bitter matcha taste so the ice cream was just okay. The chimney cone reminds me of a churro + cinnamon roll. Its dusted with cinnamon sugar.

They have various unique flavors of ice cream including non-dairy ice cream for you vegans and lactose intolerant ice cream lovers :) Parking is unsurprisingly hard to find considering it's located in the mission district, but we got super lucky and grabbed street parking right across this joint. \n\nICE CREAM: \n2 full scoops of ice cream is their \"Single\" price at $4.50 including a cone or cup OR both if you want to avoid the mess and keep the cone. THIS PRICE IS AMAZING, compared to many similar ice cream parlors. I promise, you'll stand in front of the ice cream bar and want to sample every flavor. Their flavors seem to be Hawaiian/Asian oriented including: \n+ uji mathca \n+ hojicha (roasted green tea) \n+ hawaiian butter mochi w/ sesame \n+ mango sticky rice \n+ roasted soy \n+ coconut pandan \n+ banana papaya \n+ MUCH MORE\n\n(non-dairy) \n+ earl grey \n+ strawberry guava habanero \n+ thai tea \n+ banana lilikoi (passion fruit)\n+ Kona coffee  \n+ MUCH MORE  \n\nOther than ice cream they have sundaes, pops, ice cream cookie sandwiches. Unfortunately we missed the time for the chimney cone (offered 2-4pm on Sat). You can also ask for pint sized to go. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nDecently sized with single window seats and some group seating along the back that can seat up to about 4-6. With the large windows I would imagine that it would be very bright during the day. \n\nSERVICE: \nVery friendly staff who do not rush you while choosing your flavors. They even offer suggestions for flavor pairings. yes! \n\nVerdict: would definitely be back to test out their other flavors and possibly new flavors.", "author": "Samantha F."}

Recently transitioning from a mobile ice cream truck to a brick-and-mortar, their delicious creamy treats are now more visible and accessible for everyone to enjoy. I have to admit that I was initially skeptical their ice cream could compete with the likes of Bi-Rite and Mitchell's, but that completely went out the window after my first visit. \n\nThe shop is welcoming and bright with clean white tables topped with tiny potted succulents,  cucumber-infused water, and a glass case filled with 24 heavenly flavors. About half the case is devoted to coconut milk or water based vegan sorbets, which is great for those who are lactose intolerant or have nut allergies. Their regular ice cream is made with organic milk from Straus Family Creamery. Churro Chimney Cones are currently available on Saturdays from 2-4pm (I hope they expand those hours!). \n\nThe intensity, accuracy, and uniqueness of their flavors took me by surprise. Mango Pico de Gallo, Thai Tea, Coconut Lemongrass, Banana Lilikoi Passion...and Genmaicha?! Only my favorite tea EVER. Genmaicha is a toasted brown rice green tea and is rather subtle in flavor, but they captured it perfectly! \n\nI settled on Matcha Toffee, Black Sesame, and Genmaicha and they were all creamy, dense, and flavorful - not to mention a great combination and completely Instagrammable! I couldn't stop \"mmm'ing\" after each spoonful. They're really something special.\n\nIn a city with fierce competition and high rent, your product has to be top notch, and Garden Creamery's got it. I love Bi-Rite, but their ice cream isn't nearly as creamy or densely flavorful. GC's prices are slightly above average, but on par with shops with similar concept and quality, starting at $4.25 a scoop. Totally worth it. I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Deanna Y."}

They're undeniably popular, a line formed out the door and onto the side street. It was a good 25 minutes as we anxiously waited to order our ice cream. Half of the flavors are made with coconut milk, so it's a great option for people who are lactose and cannot have the delight that is ice cream. The other half is made with organic Straus milk, you can find the menu breakdown on their website. \n\nThere is a variety of different and unique flavors to choose from. I got a single scoop (1-2 flavors) and picked Hojicha and Earl Grey. The Earl Grey flavor was absolutely delicious, I love Earl Grey ever since I tried it with boba. This flavor is vegan, but it tasted no different from regular dairy. The Hojicha was an interesting flavor and one that I would get again. The texture and consistency of their ice cream was great and the sweetness level was good.\n\nFeel free to ask for samples until you are ready to choose. Despite it being busy, the workers didn't rush us and were happy to provide us with more samples to try.

I was bummed out to hear that you can only have one flavor in the cone, especially since it's a whopping $8. While the churro cone was tasty and definitely instagram-worthy, my bf and I finished it craving more ice cream.

They're open until 10pm (!!!!) and it's on my way home so it's hard to not stop by now that I know what's up. \n\n[ As an aside, kinda funny because they're on my way home that I saw this place being transformed with bright pink paint from the Mexican Bakery into something new and never thought anything of it. I guess I should have paid more attention! ]\n\nCame by Wed just a hair before 10pm and they were nice enough to let me taste as many flavors as I wanted. Of course I took ages and then more people came in and though I was still tasting and it was now getting past 10pm, they didn't seem to mind. My favorites were the coconuts (coconut macadamia nut, coconut pandan) though the roasted soy bean and sesame were also really good. Today was super hot but I really really really wanted to stop by and try the chimney cone.\n\n*** Hot Tip: request the chimney cone with ice cream in a tray, makes it much easier to alternate eating the ice cream and cone.\n\nThe line was short but still around the corner at 3pm today. It took about 15-20min and there's orange ice water which is nice. We went for the strawberry guabanero (guava + habanero) which was a sorbet but oh so perfect on a hot day. The chimney cone was a nice yeasty sugary donut like thing. It was like 2 treats in one! It's so decadent I'm not sure I would get it every time.

I LOVE this ice cream shop and dream about going back every week, but new years resolutions got me holding back. :)\n- The intriguing and unique flavors that always rotate are absolutely spot on in nailing the taste of each flavor. Anthing with pandan from here has been A-mazing. Other top flavors in my book include: mango sticky rice, thai tea, almond, candy cane, coconut pandan, ube pandan, earl grey. The ice cream here isn't overly rich, just the perfect amount of refreshing satisfaction for dessert.\n- You can't beat the pricing in comparison to the other local hipster ice cream shops. Portion size is great as well. \n- Seating with tables inside the shop with water dispenser for water too\n\nImprovements\n- None really, there will be peak times when there is a line after dinner, but it's not that bad and it moves quickly. \n- I like to get ice cream in a cup and put a cone on top, since I don't like my cone with ice cream melting all around dripping nor do I want to be stuck with a flavor at the end that I did not prefer, yes, I'm complicated. Although a sugar cone is free by itself, they charged me $0.25 extra for the cone and cup. No biggie, but something to note.\n- I wish the chimney cone was offered during all days of the week, only limited day and time.

Didn't add any of the toppings, but tried a bunch of flavors. I really enjoyed the Japanese Milk Coffee and Genmaicha (match & toasted rice). Velvety and smooth texture, sweet but not overly sweet.

There are a variety of dairy and non-dairy flavors, ranging from your basic strawberry and cookies and cream, to hojicha, Japanese milk coffee, and mango sticky rice. All were pretty delicious, but if you want them in a chimney cone, you'll have to pick just one scoop.\n\nFor $8, I would not get the chimney cone again - the concept is cool, and the pic is totally instagrammable, but the warm freshly baked cone gets soggy pretty quickly, and your scoop of ice cream immediately starts sliding down into the cone and creating a soggy, soupy mess at the bottom of the paper sleeve. Granted, this is less of an issue in normally cold SF weather, so just something to take note of! I'd rather get a delicious pastry somewhere else and a scoop of ice cream in a regular cone.

Unfortunately for us they had neither when we stopped by tonight, but the guy behind the counter was so gracious and patiently let us sample basically half of their offerings. \n\nFor $4.25, you get two flavors; my girlfriend had the banana lilikoi passion fruit and earl grey and said their earl grey is the best she's had, even beating out the one at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous. I had the hardest time narrowing it down to two flavors but ultimately went with matcha gold (matcha with toffee) and the Thai tea (vegan). Hands down the most creative flavors in town, and yes, I've been to all the popular ice cream spots.

It's definitely not easy to find parking here either so carpool, take public transportation or rideshare. There was a short line out the door when I arrived with sister and cousin so it was cold standing outside waiting for the moment we could be warmer inside. They provide samples and flavors change often. We got to sample a few before landing on our single scoops that allow 2 flavors max for $4.50 and $4.75 for single scoop (max 2 scoops) for sherbet. Mango sticky rice was interesting but not exactly the flavor of the dish, matcha toffee was good but I landed on the hojicha (roasted green tea) and ube pandan on a sugar cone. It was delicious and I believe hojicha is a usual flavor at this shop. They have a few green tea variations, so if you're a fan, definitely try. The hojicha was a rich & strong green tea flavor that I enjoyed so I liked it. I also tasted my sister's single scoop that allowed 2 scoops - guava habanero and Japanese coffee. The guava habanero was a sherbet which was interesting when it had a kick of spice at the end of a bite in your throat. Doesn't linger too long but definitely interesting. The coffee was a lot sweeter than regular coffee since it's Japanese coffee. Really enjoyed my ube pandan and hojicha enough to want to return to try other flavors. The milk ice creams were super rich and the sherbets were refreshing. They have seats in there but only about 4-5 tables. Highly suggest but I hope they make pints one day to sell so I can take home :p", "author": "Amanda C."}

That being said, service was friendly and moved at a pace to match the crowd. We were not made to feel bad about sampling a few different flavors each, and ended up being happy with our orders. \n\nFor vegans and lactase deficient folk, the nondairy selection was strong. I ordered a small, with one scoop of coconut and one scoop of apricots and cream. It was a delightful combo, and the coconut flavoring was on par with Holy Gelato, which is my gold standard for coconut gelatos. \n\nIt seemed like the creamery was family run, which made me happy to see. The interior is small, but clean and stylish, with maximized seating area. Prices were steep for ice cream, but reasonable in the context of San Francisco. I believe the small costed $4.75. \n\nFriends got a lot of the ice creams, and those were excellent as well, based on my nibbles of their scoops. Highly recommend this little family run joint.

It seemed like time wasted since I had no plans to be anywhere in the vicinity of this Hawaiian inspired ice cream shop. \n\nThen yesterday, as my friend Paul and I made our way to dinner at Yuzuki I asked him to look up how far the restaurant was from Garden Creamery and much to my delight the answer was mere blocks! After finishing up our mushroom rice we headed for a much anticipated dessert. We arrived to find just a couple folks in front of us and a plethora of tasty treats before us. Despite my menu stalking, what we encountered in store was even better! Paul was especially pleased to find ube, a tropical taste he'd grown up with in the Philippines.\n\nWe both opted for single scoops (which come with your choice of two flavors). He had the ube macapuno and banana lilikoi and I had the haupia macadamia nut and the banana lilikoi. Our cones left us positively giddy. \n\nGarden Creamery, you live up to the hype!

Because when I got to Garden Creamery the line was so much shorter. And that shouldn't be the case!!\n\nWas there still a line? Yes. But the line was only about 10 people deep, shorter than even the Boba Guys I walked by as well (which is a chain, so I don't care how good that might be, it doesn't deserve a longer line).\n\nThe line moves fairly quickly, because people are dumb and don't try all the flavors.

The black sesame was top notch and the macadamia nut had some lovely coconut flavoring going on.\n\nFor a total of around 6 or 7 bucks, Garden Creamery delivers.

After seeing Garden Creamery's chimney cones trending on Instagram almost non stop.  I knew I had to try this carby treat topped with one of their signature ice cream flavors.  \n\nWe finished up brunch nearby at Hog & Rocks last Saturday about 45 minutes until GC serves these hot treats which is only on Saturdays from 2-4 (or until they run out).  They're fresh baked onsite.  We got there early to scope it out (a little before 1:30PM) and chatted with a really nice couple there.  They said they didn't know that it was served starting at 2, so they were waiting around, and we all decided to wait around and sample flavors.  Until more couples came in waiting for the cones.  Since it got a little crowded with waiting for the chimney cones, the nice gentleman told us to wait outside on Lexington.  \n\nThey surprisingly were done making the chimney cones and brought them out, letting us in, before 2 (I believe it was 10 minutes prior).  We got ours in a few minutes since we were second to the other couple.  I knew I was going to get the banana & lilikoi, and he was going to get the butter mochi toasted sesame.  I'm not sure if the banana & lilikoi was sorbet or vegan ice cream, but the flavors popped.  And I like how it's a not so common combination.  I enjoy banana ice cream, but the lilikoi shined here more and worked well with the banana.  The butter mochi is definitely unique, but we enjoyed it.  Not sure if I could taste much sesame but I tasted the butter and mochi.  We also sampled the cookies and cream, and the mango sticky rice.  The mango sticky rice was strong in mango flavor which I love but since I could easily get that anywhere, I passed on it for my cone.  The cookies and cream was a little faint in flavor for my liking.  \n\nI think we chose the right flavors for the cones.  Since the chimney cones have a light thorough coating sweet dusting of cinnamon, if we had gotten something like chocolate or the hazelnut crunch it would've been a bit overkill on the sweetness.  They gave us a good size scoop of ice cream and the cake was light but still very filling being so big.  While it was good, I think next time I'll skip the chimney cone and get instant relief with just a regular scoop or waffle cone.

And for those kids who are, well kudos to them for their fancy pallet.\n\nEven though you feel the pressure of the line growing outside, the staff never makes you feel bad for tastings. I mean, with so many fun flavors how can you not ask for a few tastes of goodness? They even use actual mini spoons, instead of the plastic or wooden stuff.\n\nI went with the Ube Pandon Coconut and Earl Grey in a warm waffle cone. Both were made just right, the Ube was not overly sweet and the hint of coconut was perfect. The Earl Grey, while the color was kinda weird, was really flavorful and delicious. I really enjoyed my ice cream. The cone was warm and had the perfect taste, yet it was crazy delicate. It broke many times, before I could even eat the first scoop. The cool thing about them is if you order one scoop, it really translates to two -- and you can have two flavors.\n\nI really enjoyed the pricing here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-27", "description": "Fascinating flavors phenomenally executed. For a one-of-a-kind experience, try the Hawaiian butter mochi. \n\nFOOD: \n- The basics: there are ice creams and sorbets at Curbsite. While called sorbets, the dairy free but coconut rich ice creams are every bit as indulgent as their dairy counterparts. Vegans, rejoice! I am in love with the texture of the ice cream here--full enough to savor the dairy but light enough so that the flavors can shine though.\n\n- Many cones into life, I thought I had come to understand the realm of possibilities when it comes to ice cream texture... until the Hawaiian butter mochi. My best guess is that they've added mochi rice flour or starch to the base. Whatever it is, the product is a light flavor with a rich texture: an indulgent ice cream with a touch of mochi's elastic texture. \n- I believe similar rice-powered forces are at work in the mango sticky rice flavor, as there were no discrete pieces of rice. Separate from texture, it is one of the best flavored mango ice creams I've had in the Bay Area (tastes like Philippine Alphonso mangoes w/o an overwhelming amount of cream). \n- COCONUT PANDAN--I am biased here. I love pandan and rarely find it outside of Southeast Asian pockets. Pandan is a grass with a delicate, fresh flavor that that enhances tropical ones like coconut or mango without a bitter aftertaste (looking at you, wheatgrass). (Update: ube coconut pandan is also bomb. Plus it's purple!)\n- The coconut based Thai tea sorbet I loved--the tea flavor was prominent (often the ice dairy fat dulls the flavor with every lick) and complemented well by the coconut. \n- Mint chip is exceptional--and I don't even like mint chip! Garden makes it with fresh mint (none of that \"essence\" business) and it makes for a refreshing rather than the usual toothpaste feel. Chocolate flecks are just the right size and distribution to impart flavor without chipping a tooth.\n- Earl Grey ice cream and sorbet were great, but I like milk in my tea and the richer consistency of the ice cream version won out in my book.\n- This place is a matcha connoisseur's dream (ceremonial, sencha, and even genmaicha). \n\nI have yet to try a flavor that doesn't wow. \n\nThe waffle cones are a buttery, crisp delight. I had one warm last night and I might just have to camp out there from now on for fresh batches :). \n\nConsidering the quality, the price is phenomenal. A single scoop (4.50) gets you two flavors and what I consider 1.75 scoops. I am dreading the day these lines rival Bi-Rite's. \n\nSERVICE: I love how upbeat and smiley everyone there is. What is outstanding is the sample service! Both times I've been, I've been guided toward an unexpected gem of a flavor by the staff. Even with a line ahead of me and behind me, I didn't feel rushed.\n\nAMBIANCE: Very cute! Small store with painted wooden signs in fresh colors.

They offer many dairy free options and going in I didn't think I'd walk out picking two dairy free choices but I couldn't resist. You wouldn't think it's dairy free either! I got the guava li hing mui and macapuno. The macapuno is coconut based with coconut meat in it! My boyfriend got the hurricane popcorn (!!!) and black sesame. So so so so good! The hurricane popcorn had a subtle popcorn taste and literally tastes just like hurricane popcorn without being overwhelming. I can't describe it but overall Garden Creamery nails the flavor profiles perfectly. It was nostalgic of my childhood and comforting tasting these unique ice cream flavors.

They started off as an ice cream truck and finally have a store in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco. Those of you who are lactose intolerant, you're in luck because they have vegan ice cream that tastes just as creamy as the dairy options!\n\nGarden Creamery creates all their ice creams, vegan ice creams (coconut-based) and sorbets all on location in small batches from locally sourced ingredients. They pasteurize their dairy on location. I love that they have exotic and creative flavors that I haven't seen or tried anywhere else! Below are some of my favorites so far.\n\nCoconut Pandan - Those of you who aren't familiar with pandan, its a plant used commonly in Southeast Asian cuisine, and combined with coconut, makes a deliciously fragrant dessert! I love it in Vietnamese style desserts and tasting this ice cream was so satisfying.\n\nGenmaicha - Matcha green tea with toasted rice flavored ice cream. Tastes just like the genmaicha tea you have at Japanese restaurants, this ice cream had the perfect balance between the tea and with the aroma of toasted rice, mild and refreshing.\n\nEarl Grey - Vegan option! I was afraid that it wasn't going to be creamy enough, boy was I wrong. The tea flavor was intense, aromatic with hint of sorbet texture but perfectly creamy. If its made from coconut, I couldn't taste it at all!\n\nFresh Mint Chip - always a favorite of mine. I've never had it anywhere else except at a local Hayes Valley ice cream shop or if I make it myself. Here at Garden Creamery,they make it exactly how I like it. The cream is steeped in real fresh spearmint leaves and the chocolate chip is shaved so that they're flaky and not hard to bite on when frozen. Oh my God, its P-E-R-F-E-C-T.

To all my green tea ice cream lovers, the day I came they had 3 variations of green tea! They also have a relatively large selection of non dairy ice creams that looked amazing! \nI ended up getting the buttered Mochi with sesame and genmaicha. I have never had either flavors in ice cream form before, and there were so many others that I've never seen in the many many ice cream shops that I've explored in my lifetime. The buttered mochi perfectly captures the texture of actual buttered mochi in ice cream form. And the genmaicha tastes just like genmaicha tea, which satisfied my lil Japanese American soul. I still have yet to get their chimney cone, it's a lil pricey, but I will definitely be back to try it!", "author": "Nina W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-19", "description": "If the idyllic Garden of Eden had a creamery, it probably be Garden Creamery P: I apologize if the punniness offends anyone, but Garden Creamery is seriously heavenly. Although small batch/organic/from scratch/unique flavors have become quite the standard for SF, the quality and thought put into the ice cream here is apparent. There's even a window in the back where you can see them making ice cream, which makes the ice cream seem to taste even fresher than it already is P:\n\nGarden Creamery specializes in Hawaiian themed flavors, including Japanese (matcha, hojicha, black sesame, ucc milk coffee), tropical (haupia macadamia nut, pandan, coconut), foodie-oriented (saffron rose), and guilty pleasure selections (Butterfinger, cookies n cream). Besides ice cream scoops, they also have hand-made pops, ice cream sandwiches, sundaes, and an epic-looking signature chimney cone, but I like to ensure adequate stomach space for ice cream.\n\nThe generous, friendly attitude makes the place feel very homey and welcoming, in contrast to the all-too-common pretentiousness throughout SF. The servers are so polite and gracious, and you don't feel the least bit judged in sampling different flavors. I also applaud the $4.25 single for 1-2 flavors and $6.25 double for 2-3 flavors, which means you get an impressive (and incredibly photogenic) three scoops for a double! \n\nThoughts on the flavors:\n(+++) Haupia macadamia nut: Woaw it is no wonder this is among their most popular. It is an extremely likeable and satiating blend of toasty coconut and macadamia nut; recommended especially if you have a sweet tooth.\n(+++) Thai tea: An aromatic blend, centered more on the spices and the tea than the sweetness of the condensed milk. You even see the little dots of black tea leaves! \n(+++) Kinako (roasted soybean): Delightfully mild, almost zen-like. It was the least sweet, which I actually liked because you notice the subtleties of the soybeans layered with light overtones of roastiness. Pairs excellently with everything, especially the more decadent flavors because it helps to tone things down.\n(+++) Mango: I think there was mix-up because I asked for mango stick rice but didn't notice anything sticky-rice-like in my ice cream. In any case, the mango flavors were amazingly fresh, similar to Mitchell's except I think Garden uses the local variety of mangos (Mitchell's uses the sweeter Philippino type)\n(++) Saffron rose: Fascinating! I think my palate isn't sophisticated enough to gravitate towards this advanced flavor, but it was a memorable mix of floral and a tantalizingly complex degree of aromatic. \n(+) Matcha and hojicha could use stronger tea flavor, though I may be unrealistic standards from being used to tea ice creams in Asia. Also, I'm not a fan of the murky brownish-green hojicha color, but such is life in the all-natural world.\n\nI like how their ice cream is generally not too sweet, the flavors taste distinctly fresh and nuanced, and the texture is decently thick and holds together well but is not overly creamy. Although I do have a weakness for the lusciously creamy ice cream of Humphry Slocombe, I appreciate the focus on the flavors and more down-to-earth style (no pun intended) of Garden Creamery. \n\nI do think they should wrap the cones in a napkin, especially since you are handling money and then are given a cone. Otherwise, in my opinion everything is quite perfect already without any kinks to work out, despite the store's recent opening in early 2017.\n\nDespite the small space, the seating is sufficient (for now at least), with a counter by the window and a few tables in the back. Color schemes and decor are basic but trendy, with an easy-to-locate bright red corner storefront, hexagonal white tiles, minty teal chairs, and fresh flowers/succulents. Seeing that no one would really want to bring their ice cream into the bathroom, I personally think they should move the cool ice cream mirror from the bathroom to the store--ice cream Instagrams would be completely *lit*.", "author": "Edna C."}

The girl who helped me out said one of their most popular flavors was the mango with sticky rice, which was really good.  \n\nI ordered the earl grey and kona coffee for myself, the earl grey and thai tea for my cousin and the mango with sticky rice for my son.

We got there about 10 minutes before they started serving the cones and stood in line. Most people if not everyone was trying to get those cones. Which was kind of the problem since they could not keep up with the demand. So they took your order down and you had to wait for the cone. While I waited, I tried a few of their ice creams. And they were all pretty good. I ended up getting the green tea with my chimney cone. Because they couldn't keep up with the crowd, the chimney cones came out very hot and when they topped it with ice cream, which you can only get one scoop with the cone, it just melted in seconds. For that reason, I give this place a 3. The ice cream itself was a 5 but the execution was poor. \nI'll be back for the ice cream though.", "author": "Celia Z."}

The ice cream is so smooth and creamy and I love the island touch to their product.\n\nThe owners, Erin and Donny, are the kindest and friendliest people I've met.

This isn't your classic \"Oh let me a scoop of Vanilla and Sea Salt caramel\" place. This is \"let me have a scoop of Mango Sticky Rice on that beautiful chimney cone\" place.\n\nOne of the perks of living in San Francisco, is that we have amazing ice cream spots, especially in the Mission (heard it was 11 last time). That's why you have to be incredible, just to get noticed by people. Aaaaaaand Garden Creamery is incredible, just fantastic.\n\nI've discovered this place accidentally, wondering why the hell there was such loooong line (so uncommon in SF right?) but then of course gave up and got in. Turns out it's that sweet 2 - 4 PM time period where they make their infamous chimney cone. Think about a churro, croissant and ice cream cone, combined in the best way possible. \n\nAfter checking flavors (and no I will never forget seeing Yam and Black Sesame as flavors) I decided on Mango Sticky Rice and rest of it was history. Unbelieveable.\n\nI came back again just to discovered that their Cookies & Cream is the best one I've ever had so far.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-24", "description": "Partner and I ended a jam-packed day in San Francisco with ice cream here since they seemed to have the most vegan options available.\n\nHe tried chocolate and coconut. He appreciated the texture and flavor of both the flavors, and the fact that they actually made vegan ice cream and not just fruity sorbet. His major gripe (other than the whole place not being vegan lol) is that most of the vegan options were fruity flavors, and he would have liked more non-fruit options than just chocolate, coffee, and earl grey.\n\nI tried one of their matcha flavors and the Tahitian vanilla. The vanilla was slightly above average, but not spectacular. The matcha flavor, however, was out of this world good and made me think I made a mistake not just getting more of that. Definitely high quality matcha with a lot of complexity of the flavor. The texture was probably the best of any ice cream I've had, it was as soft and silky as soft serve without actually being soft serve or having the airiness of it. Mine had toffee pieces in it and while I didn't get a lot of flavor from the toffee, the pieces were the perfect size (read: easy to eat) and added a delightful juxtaposition of texture. My only gripe was that the cone didn't taste housemade to me. I could be wrong but either way, the flavor seemed a little too generic.\n\nBeing in the Mission, the flavors are definitely a little more Asian influenced than your typical ice cream spread. When we went, they didn't have strawberry for example but sweet plum, taro, and three separate matcha based flavors. I like the fresh take but it may not be up everyone's alley.\n\nService seemed on par with what we received elsewhere in San Fran.", "author": "Christy G."}

Dammit, all those Mission Dolores Park hipsters discovered this place. Jealousy? They discovered *my* secret ice cream spot. Sadness? Yea mostly that - I didn't have time to wait to get to the front of that wrapping mob of ice cream seekers who had managed to get their earlier than me. \n\nAll that aside, Garden Creamery is great. I was remarking to some coworkers recently: coconut has really blossomed into its own the last several years. Went from some weird gross flavored Jelly Belly that you avoided at all costs right to the most in-demand cocktail ingredient, trendiest water product, and now, an essential part of some delicious and creamy dairy free ice cream at the Mission's newest dedicated frozen dessert spot. (A crowded market: they're competing with at least half a dozen other detour-worthy great treats within two blocks)\n\nAnyway....on to the skinny (or maybe the fat if you go here as much as I seem to be these days)....\n\n-about half their flavors are completely dairy free, either coconut milk based ice cream (you can't even tell, I swear) or delicious sorbet\n-ownership / staff is incredibly friendly - and Hawaiian! No qualms whatsoever about providing samples of absolutely everything, including the multiple variants of black sesame or matcha (between the two like six flavors in the case)\n-that banana caramel and earl grey is the stuff dreams are made of. The Hawaiian/Asian influenced Haupia mac (like coconut pie) and Thai iced tea flavors are also excellent. Classic cookies n cream and their very own extremely rich vanilla are both plenty good too!\n\nSo in short - get there quickly, or you'll be waiting long. You might be too late to beat the Bi Rite creamery like lines, but hey-they don't sell by the pint yet, so at least you'll know you did it for the unique experience value.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

I can confidently say Garden creamery offers the most natural flavor and is the closest thing to the real taste of the fruits. Other places' being too synthetic tasting or just taste like ice.

Garden creamery now brings back very stressful memories and a mix of many emotions. The ice cream here is pretty good, a lot of unique flavors, and if I ever get over my PTSD, I will be back to try them all. But you should come here and try their ice cream and infamous chimney cone. The price point is a lil steep tbh, it costs like $10 for a scoop plus the chimney cone.\n\nMy traumatic experience all started with IG. My friend and I have been eyeing this place since it opened because of all the IG hype and posts surrounding their chimney cone. If you haven't seen the photos or heard of it yet, it's essentially a churro cone, so it's a bready cone doused in cinnamon sugar.. what can go wrong right?? It sounds right in every aspect.. ice cream n a churro come, BOMB. Moving on, did my research, chimney cones are only available on Saturdays like 2-4PM or until it's sold out. Something like that. My friend and I set a date, Sat @ 2PM to try it. I show up on time like 1:55PM cus you know I'm serious about my ice cream and I'm pumped. This was going to be my first meal of the day. I get in an already lengthy line (bc what's SF food without lines? Nada) and wait for my friend to show up. It's 2:15 and she still ain't here, finally I get a text from her that she's looking for parking. UM GIRL THERE AINT NO PARKING IN THIS AREA AT THIS TIME OF DAY ON A SAT. But I let her go around, I'm almost at the front of the line and I text her like hey, hurry up. She says, just order for me and I'll pull over and get you, then we'll eat it elsewhere, okay, I'm cool with that bc I didn't want them to run out of cones! I finally get in the store, and was greeted by smiling faces and I decided to try each of their 3 different green teas! Ma dam, they were pretty good, potent tea flavor! I get 2 matcha golds on chimney cones. Paid via credit card and texted my friend hey pull up, got the goods, I'll hop in your car. And I'm handed my two cones. TELL ME WHY THESE CONES WAS WARM AND MY ICE CREAM HAD ALREADY STARTED MELTING OMG. So I run out the store frantically looking for a lil blue subie. no. where. to. be. found. Finally I see her pull up, I signal her with my face bc my two hands was holding the two melting cones. This girl really just looked at me, shook her head, and kept driving....?????????? HOW WAS THAT HELPFUL??? So I'm like well there goes that, I can't possibly text you with two melting cones. So I stand on the corner like a doofus while everyone in this line is staring at me like why does this girl have two of the same cones?? But ain't eating it? Lemme tell you, my mama raised me right, I don't start eating without you unless you give me your blessing to. So I waited, through the green sticky mess that was now becoming my hands. So I put my thinking hat on, and I ask this little boy to hold my cone while I called my friend. I told her pull up, ima hop in, and we gna park somewhere, anywhere, cus this ice cream is getting out of control. She pulls up like 4 minutes later and how was I to open the car door???? I beg an innocent civilian passing by to help me, she was about to but my friend swings her door open, I get in and the civilian tucks me in and closes the door. All is good right??? WRONG. My friend starts driving away, with my seatbelt off, y'all know I'm all about my safety first so I'm freaking out then the ice creams began dripping all over the car and my legs. I yell we gotta pull over!! Anywhere! We pull into someone's driveway and hop out the car and we immediately began eating. Half of the ice cream had melted into the bag holding the cone bc guess what else, these chimney cones have a hole at the bottom... but whyyyyyy? Ventilation??? IONO. We leave behind a green sticky puddle in front of this person's house (sorry). And I'm still panicking and hangry so I downed that ice cream and cone faster than I ever eaten anything in my life. It was good though, the warmth of the cone and the ice cream is a wild combination. The ice cream itself was also pretty good! Then I grab the alcohol wipes from my emergency bag and clean our hands, legs, and car up. SMH. That's my garden creamery chimney cone war story. I wrote this with the intention that someone would learn from my mistakes that day, go there, get one cone per customer, with the intention of eating it as soon as it's in your hand or you too may end up with green tea ice cream PTSD.

I arrived with a skip in my step and high hopes. Needless to say, this is NOT the way I left. This establishment advertises for its \"the chimney\" cone, and many people come for this reason. HOWEVER. It was not snooty enough for this place to serve its most highly advertised menu item only one day of the week (Saturday); they serve \"the chimney\" only 2 HOURS each week (2-4). This creates a lot of buzz and attracts hopeful customers like me only to serve them a freezing disappointment, confusion, and sense of loss.  Their ice cream is cold, I'll give them that. If you are looking for some senseless, no-strings attached matcha ice cream to light your waning fire, this might be the place for you.

To avoid long lines, avoid Friday nights or Saturday 2- 4ish (unless you want to try their chimney cones).\n\nI'm so happy Garden Creamery has come into my life (and I'm sad I didn't know about their products or ice cream truck earlier!). I love this place from the amazing, delicious flavors to the fantastic, sweet and kind owners. \n\nMy first experience there involved my friends and me struggling to cut a cake that one of us had brought in. Donny noticed we were struggling and brought out a knife from the back, cups, and spoons. No questions asked. Him and Erin are so nice. Erin is always so enthusiastic and will bring a smile to your face when she greets or serves you or is switching out the ice cream.\n\nFlavorwise, I was initially overwhelmed (in a good way) by the wonderful assortment. As many of the other reviews have commented on, they have awesome flavors. They consistently have threes of green tea (ceremonial/uji matcha (occasionally with toffee), genmaicha, and hojicha), pandan coconut, haupia macadamia nut, black sesame, mango sticky rice, Thai tea, Earl grey, and have several rotational flavors like sencha, banana liliko'i, strawberry lychee, mango li hung mui, strawberry ume (my favorite!), ube pandan coconut, and Hawaiian butter mochi, among others. Like I said, it's overwhelming. But the workers are all nice and have great recommendations and let you sample until you are set on what combination to get. You can get two flavors with a single and three flavors with a double. A single is a generous amount and good for most people. \n\nAdditionally, there are also often tasty looking ice cream sandwiches and ice cream pops! Haven't tried one yet, but will do so soon! \n\nThe atmosphere is lively and welcoming and they have nice backdrops for all your Instagram and Snapchat pics (of grave importance, I know :p). If you're in Dolores or exploring the Mission and want some ice cream, pass up Bi-Rite and definitely try out Garden! You won't be disappointed! And because there are so many great flavors, you'll just have to keep coming back! :D", "author": "Mario Z."}

Different in its simplicity and Asian flavors, but nothing 'artisinal.'\n\nYou probably will find little crossover flavors with this place and Poly-Anns, which also does Asian flavors and Mitchells. This place has 3 different types of Matcha; Hojicha, Matcha, and Matcha w/ toffee chunks, so if you're a matcha fiend then this place is for you. I'd probably come back here for the Hojicha flavor to reminisce about the ice cream in Japan.\n\nFlavor wise for the ice cream it's pretty simple and straightforward; you taste what you get with no complexity. I do not think their milk quality is as good as other ice cream places since you can't really taste the milk. Texturally the ice cream here is not to my liking. It's very soft and sticky and has a gummy texture that may have been stabilized with some gum extract for the texture? It's creamy but a different kind than Smitten; taste test them side by side and there is a difference in texture that's due to their churning process. \n\nOverall I'm ok that I tried it since I was in the neighborhood but I don't foresee myself recommending this place as an SF essential or going again.", "author": "Chad S."}

They have some really unique flavors including vegan sorbets made with coconut base. I was torn when I was trying to choose my flavors. I went with a single scoop (two scoops of ice cream) of black sesame and hojicha. \n\nCan't wait to come back to try more flavors. They also have ice cream treats (popsicles) in addition to sundaes. They'll be offering their chimney cones again soon too; it's a hungarian cake with crunchy exterior and soft interior!", "author": "Katherine S."}

My boyfriend and I waited in line on Saturday for their limited chimney cone from 2-4pm. We waited about 45 minutes to reach the front of the lines and they let you try as many flavors as you want. We tried about seven flavors before deciding to get the mango sticky rice and genmatcha with the cone. The price however is pricey for the chimney cone- $8.50 for one, but we got 2 which ended up being $17. I like how the chimney cone with the ice cream didn't end up being messy to eat. Overall, I would recommend coming here to try their ice cream and try their specialty cone at least once.", "author": "Tracy Y."}

So if you don't have the same luck with ice cream places as I do, I recommend going here between 2-4 on Saturdays to get the chimney cones.\n\nThe variety of ice cream flavors (both vegan and non-vegan) made it nearly impossible not to be a tasting hog... but after sampling a handful of the options, I landed on cookies & cream in a chimney cone. It. Was. Amazing. \n\nI'll be back for seconds (thirds, and probably fourths) real soon. Looking forward to trying some of the vegan options!", "author": "Madeline K."}

I also love that everytime I go there they have new interesting flavors but keep some of their popular flavors out. Some of my favorites have been ceremonial matcha, hazelnut crunch, and Haupia. I also love that the staff is very friendly. I still have to try and get to garden creamery when they have the churro cones. Every time I am in the mission I always stop to get a scoop of ice cream!

Having seen so many pictures of their infamous soft cone, I knew I had to try this place. However, when I got there, I learned that they only sold the special cone for 2 hours on Saturdays. However, I saw all their interesting flavors and I knew I was already sold. As a tea person, I was pleasantly surprised by how many different tea flavors they had. I only tried a small variety but I loved everything and I wish I tried more. I ended up choosing a matcha gold (green tea + toffee) and hojicha (roasted matcha). I also tried their genmaicha (toasted rice tea) and black sesame, which were both really good. My boyfriend ended up choosing their black sesame, which is rich in flavor, and the ube pandan coconut, which was a little too sweet for his liking, but very unique indeed. I noticed they also had a bunch of other delicious flavors, such as strawberry lychee, earl gray, li hing mui and much more. Can't wait to come back to try the other flavors and with their chimney cone!", "author": "Cindy C."}

Erin reached out to me before the day ended, promptly addressed the overcharge, and explained that the error came from their collaboration with Mochi Muffins. \n\nI appreciate Garden Creamery's honesty, transparency, and customer support. Moreover, their ice cream is pretty good and you can taste the high quality ingredients. (Get the black sesame!)\n\n\n------\nNot sure how I feel about $10 ice cream for a single scoop with mochi in a cup.\n\nEither the kid sitting at the register over charged me or the price is jacked up. I even asked for a receipt and it wasn't even an itemized one that broke down the cost--it was just a confirmation that I paid $10.\n\nI tried calling their number several times for clarification but they don't pick up.\n\nThere are better options in the city for ice cream.", "author": "Song Y."}

So glad that they have an actual location now! I came here on a Saturday night after dinner and surprisingly there was only a short line. I really like how they have many interesting ice cream flavors that other ice cream shops don't have! We shared two scoops of the Genmaicha and Coconut Pandan ice cream. Genmaicha (matcha and toasted rice) was light enough that you can still taste the toasted rice flavor. For those who don't know what pandan is, it's a plant used widely in cooking as a flavoring in Southeast Asia. We had chose this ice cream flavor because we loved pandan waffles (from vietnamese bakeries) and were very surprised to see it as an ice cream flavor. It had a light fragrant taste. Both ice cream flavors were creamy and refreshing. Perfect way to end the night! I want to be back to try their chimney cones, which unfortunately are only available on Saturdays from 2PM - 4PM. I hope one day they will expand those hours! Definitely will be back to try more of their ice cream flavors!", "author": "Philana C."}

And who could resist all the enticing flavors that garden creamery has to offer!? Hojicha Tea! That's the one that got my attention and got me into the store. Everyone has green tea and earl grey, but not everyone has hojicha and after our most recent trip to Japan, I feel in love with hojicha tea! Next up, mango sticky rice!!! Pretty tasty if you ask me! The only other flavor that I didn't order but sampled was Butter Mochi. Being a devoted mochi connoisseur, this didn't hit home for me the way I had hoped but still, A for effort. A few of the other flavors that caught my eye were Thai Tea, Earl Grey and Lilikoi!

I didn't mind though because I actually really enjoyed it. It had the perfect amount of tartness to it. Their ice creams aren't too sweet and it's actually the only ice cream sandwich I've ever finished. I usually just like taking pictures of it and then it's too sweet that I never finish it.

We had a coconut pandan flavor which was amazing. Also good mix of dairy and non-dairy (sorbets). Could improve the line traffic flow by adding another door near the back. Everyone walks in and out the same way creating traffic jams near the front. Great ice cream shop!", "author": "Michael C."}

Ran by Erin and Donny the perfect duo to think up and execute unique ice cream flavors. They have recently added the chimney cone which after going twice I still have forgotten to order because of my excitement and rush to get my ice cream. This is definitely my go to ice cream place and I am trying to get as much as I can before the lines start busting around the block.", "author": "andrew p."}

I'm dairy sensitive so typically ice cream options are limited everywhere I go, but no anymore. They had seven dairy free options that were just as delicious and creamery as regular ice cream, including Thai ice tea, earl grey, fresh mint and dark chocolate. I hope they start selling by the pint because this is the best dairy free ice cream I've ever had.", "author": "Liz H."}

This is exactly why I'd really like to go on vacation to Fiji, (where hawaiians go for a beach vacation), but, I also don't want to forever more think all beaches are 'meh', cause I've now experienced beaches in FiJI!  Yum.  Great ice cream great customer service!  Try the Houpia Mac nut on a brownie, they call it a brownie sundae, guys, it ain't a sundae unless its got whipped cream. (Hoping you'll rethink not supplying whip cream.  Now I gotta find the truck.  ... thinking of putting my Tile in the truck so I can always find it.  A rabid fan.", "author": "M M."}

The texture is phenomenal, better than many conventional ice cream stores, creamier, and it is sweetened with agave. I went there today and they were closed, but the owner was so sweet he not only let me in, but when he heard I was visiting from Brazil he gave me a scoop of the Earl Grey - the other flavors were all too frozen to scoop - and I  didn't even like Earl Grey tea, I guess until today!!\nHe didn't even let me pay, great ice cream, great people", "author": "Estela S."}

And they let me taste many flavors before I made my selection. \n\nI'm looking forward to going back and trying more flavors. They have lots of interesting and unique flavors.

This place reminded me a lot of bi-rite creamery but they had non dairy choices as well. When it was finally our turn we asked the person helping us which flavor was their most popular flavor and he said everything which didn't help us much. I came here mainly to try the chimney cone but I was disappointed to find out it was only available during a certain time. The employee seemed to be rushing us to order so we ended up choosing japanese milk coffee flavor. Because of the service I will not be returning here.", "author": "Lorraine N."}

I got the matcha gold and Japanese milk coffee and both flavors were excellent. To be fair, I'm a green tea ice cream lover and avid bubble tea drinker so the flavors were right up my alley but they were done well -- very rich and bold. Tried the mint chip which tasted like fresh mint and was delicious as well. The line was just out the door when I was there around 8pm on a Sunday night but it was well worth the ~15 min wait.

I'm very particular about the matcha ice cream I get. Usually, I find places either make it too sweet, or it just does not taste like matcha at all. I got the matcha gold and the japanese milk coffee. I wasn't able to try the chimney cones unfortunately, but I really enjoyed their waffle cone. I liked how their waffle cone wasn't as thick as most places make it, and it seems like their cone was coated with sugar so it was really pleasant to bite into. Although the line was out the door when we got there, the wait was not bad at all. We also got to try many different flavors. If you're into Asian ice cream flavors, this will definitely hit the spot for you. They have flavors such as Matcha Gold, Japanese Milk Coffee, Hojicha, Thai Ice Tea, Ube, Mango Sticky Rice, etc. Their ice cream is very creamy as well and I would definitely come back again!", "author": "Sandy Z."}

Took us awhile to find parking but it's SF so I wasn't surprised. The line was out the door & down Lexington st. It moved pretty slow, we stood in line for about 30 minutes. Worth the wait? Yes and no. When we got to the door we could smell the cone that they sell. Forgot what it's called & I'm too lazy to go look for the name on other reviews. Anyways, none of flavors really stood out to me and they have a lot of flavors. My bf and I decided to go with the chocolate brownie with the special cone, $8.50 for the whole thing. The ice cream was good, i definitely enjoyed it. However I wasn't a fan of the cone. It smelled good but it didn't taste any different than the churro they sell at costco. And for just one scoop of ice cream? The ice cream was at the top so when we finished the ice cream we still had half of the cone left with no ice cream. My bf seem to enjoy it however he did say next time he would just get the regular cone. As for service, i get that it does get annoying when every customer is literally asking for samples & when someone want the special cone you gotta run into the back to get it but part of your job is to smile, make the customers feel welcomed and I did not get that feeling here. The workers seemed so annoyed and you can just tell that they would rather be anywhere but there. I will probably come back for the ice cream itself but when I do I hope I get a better experience.", "author": "Kristina N."}

The chimney cone is warm, chewy, crunchy and covered in an aromatic cinnamon sugar!  You can smell your way there!!  Too many interesting flavors to decide on so I got 4!  1) Japanese milk coffee was amazing!  Super smooth with a subtle flavor. 2) mango coconut just as smooth man my family would be able to devour a tub of this! 3) man ha green tea with burnt rice was soooo good. Same creaminess meets br\u00fbl\u00e9e burnt rice crispier. So yum! 4) vegan strawberry lychee has a great smooth consistency too. No icy at all. And not too sweet. You could taste the fresh fruit and real color!  Mmmm so satisfying!  A must if you are hitting up the best SF creameries!  I'll be back fosh!", "author": "Marilyn K."}
