Overall rating: A\n\n\nMy friend and I really enjoyed this restaurant. It wasn't too loud or crowded. The music was at a decent level too. Bonus points for me. I pretty much loved everything we tried here. Here's what we got:\n\n-COMPLIMENTARY BREAD+OLIVE OIL: I love my carbs! I appreciate they put out flavorful olive oil too. \n\n-SCAMORZA AI FUNGHI appetizer (Melted smoked mozzarella with mix sauteed mushrooms): This was not what I was expecting but it was still delicious. Basically, it's sauteed garlicky mushrooms mixed into melty cheese. Ask for some complimentary bread to go with this. I think it was drizzled with olive oil too. Heaven! A+\n\n-PAPPARDELLE SUGO D' AGNELLO entree (Homemade pappardelle with lamb Bolognese sauce): My favorite of the 2 pastas we tried. I loved the al dente chew of the noodles and the lamb Bolognese sauce was perfectly spiced. Not too salty. A+\n\n-GNOCCHI AL CINGHIALE entree (Homemade potato dumplings with 5 hours braised wild boar sauce): This was good too. Only thing I wasn't super enthused about was that the gnocchi itself was too soft for me. But the sauce was amazing! A\n\n-TIRAMISU dessert: I got this to go for later and it didn't disappoint! It had the perfect soft texture and had enough coffee flavor. Usually at other places, the ladyfingers is too dry and there isn't enough coffee flavor. This was just the right balance and not too sweet. I just wish there was more! A+\n\n-MONTEPULCIANO red wine: I'm not a huge wine fan but this was pretty good. A\n\n\nGenerous portions so we took half of each pasta to go. Our original waiter disappeared at one point and I had to flag down a different waiter for the dessert menu/ordering and check. We got 1 appetizer, 2 pasta entrees, 1 dessert, 1 wine, and 1 gingerale and it only came out to $42.58 per person after tip! I'm so happy we got such a great meal at affordable price! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I would love to go back next time I'm in San Francisco!", "author": "D D."}

We ordered an antipasto special involving crostini, cheese, vegetables, and meat, along with our individual dinner items. My penne all'arrabbiata was deliciously spicy. We ended the night with a shared chocolate, raspberry, and gelato dessert. Throughout the night, our server took such great care of us, making sure to graciously cater to our individual questions and requests. \n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful experience.

It was rudely communicated we could either come in now or later; initially leaving a sour-taste, we were going to write-off the restaurant and dine elsewhere. On New Years day, a lot of restaurants had closed early, and with the cravings so strong, we called back and were able to quickly reserve a table for 4 at 9pm. That ended up being the best decision of the night. \n\nLate at night, it was a little difficult to find as it was tucked away surreptitiously. Look for the bright round Little Chihuahua sign and the restaurant will be immediately to the left. Parking was ironically easy. \n\nWalking in was just as I had imagine a local restaurant in Roma would be. Small dark wooden tables, dimly-lit with candlelights, and warm hues shadowing the wine walls and the open kitchen in the very back. \n\nWe were immediately seated by our server, same man who reserved our table over the phone.... through the accent, he was SO much more hospitable in-person. It wasn't on the menu, but he requested us a special order of seafood spaghetti, with clams, mussels, and squid! All dishes that came and went were so fresh, and intricately simple in flavor. Absolutely no guilt. \n\nDO NOT SKIP DESSERT! It is a must here! We ordered tiramisu and panna cotta to split between 4, along with a couple of coffees, and it was perfect in portion sizes. \n\nWe were in and out in one hour by 10pm.

Definitely exceeded our expectations!! My new favorite Italian restaurant in the area for sure. Between the two of us, we ordered two pastas and an entr\u00e9e. Lots of food, but totally worth. You also get free bread (of course). I got the bucatini for my pasta dish. It was amazing!! The pasta is thicker (which I personally like), and they used just the right amount of sauce. Lots of flavor, and serving size was good! Doesn't look like a lot but the thickness of the pasta definitely makes up for it. Also tried some of my bf's tortelloni (larger version of tortellini)--really good as well, but I prefer long pastas :) Now...the highlight of the meal for me wasn't the pasta actually. It was the duck!! So so tender, and it was cooked perfectly! Slightly red on the inside. It had so much flavor!! And the sauce that they used complemented it perfectly. Best duck I've ever had. I've been craving it since! \n\nOverall, I can't wait to come back (99% for the duck, haha). Prices here are reasonable. And the restaurant is super cozy. We were seated right next to the fireplace. I'd recommend making reservations if you can. It's not a huge restaurant and does get reasonably crowded during dinner, even on weekdays. But you've got to try this place if you haven't already.

I am a lover of all edible fun ghi, so I got the Fettuccine Tartufate. The fettuccine was really dry (I prefer fettuccine in a creamy sauce). There wasn't much of a truffle flavor, and the only flavor I could get from the other fungi was the sour flavor you get when you eat shitake and oyster mushrooms semi-raw. I tried adding more cheese after digging in a bit, but the cheese didn't help much. A suggestion for the chef is to add more truffle flavor and if that is economically infeasible, then figure out a way to make the porcini flavors come out better since that's the second most valuable fungus in the recipe.\n\nI also tried the duck both medium and medium rare, and coupled with the sweet tangy sauce, it tastes basically the same as American meatloaf. My suggestion is to order this well-done (something that shouldn't usually be done with duck) if you want to avoid memories of school cafeteria lunch.", "author": "Darwin L."}

Other than that, let's start with what we ordered:\n\nThey have olive oil for the bread. There was some weird taste once you put it in your mouth. They probably serve with lower quality olive oil or the mixed olive oil. The black pepper has no taste, aka old pepper. When the server came with fresh pepper, I was hopeful but less than 2 seconds I was disappointed again.\n\nThe carpaccio was like the rare beef on the side at a Vietnamese noodle place. The cut was thick, chewy, and not fresh. \n\nMussels and clams were disappointing, but the sauce was ok.\n\nThe fettuccine with truffle sauce was acceptable. However, the veal (daily special) with prosciutto...wow, not sure what to say. The veal was like the meat you would use to make soup, they were just thin cut not real veal. The prosciutto is really not prosciutto or very cheap one. It was bigger than the veal itself. The mashed potato is obviously powdered, super watery, also very salty.

Classy.\n\nThankfully, I've grown out of the embarrassing \"THAT Girl\" stage. Well, more like my wallet has. *sigh* These days, Girls Night Out consists more of a low key restaurant, followed by hitting the sheets by 10 pm. Hey, don't judge. The best feeling in the world is being able to sling that bra off--am I right, ladies? FREEE the boobies!\n\nMy gfs and I had planned a dinner months in advance only to find out that we never choose a restaurant days prior to the date. I was easily able to make last minute reservations (2 days prior) at Lupa. Even though there was hella times available on OpenTable, it was fully packed on a Friday night. DO make reservations as Lupa seems to be a favorite standby for those who live in Noe Valley. \n\nLupa's Roman-influenced is very affordably priced for SF and the portions are generous (we all had leftovers). For a party of four, we ordered 3 apps, 4 pastas, 3 desserts, and a glass of wine each and it was just $55 pp (including tax & tip). Lupa is pretty solid...for a \"neighborhood\" restaurant but not Flour + Water, Tosca Caf\u00e9, Seven Hills, Cotogna, and Delfina (a bit overrated) caliber. \n\nA P P S\n*Beef carpaccio, arugula, capers, shaved parmiggiano ($13): http://bit.ly/1P7Lgc8\n*Imported Burrata, Tyrolian speck, arugula ($13.25): http://bit.ly/1MkC4vQ\n*Prince Edward Island mussels, Manila clams, spicy tomato broth (app - $13): http://bit.ly/1RCOYcO\n\nMy fav app was the carpaccio which was silky soft. I love burrata and Lupa's was decent. It wasn't as soft and creamy as I would like it. I would skip the mussels and clams in spicy tomato broth as the mussels were minuscule and there wasn't much broth for bread dipping.\n\nP A S T A S\n*Housemade ricotta gnocchi, sausage, tomato sauce (special - $16.50): http://bit.ly/1kdWqAn\n*Fettuccine Tartufate: Housemade fettuccine, porcini, shitake, oyster mushrooms, black truffle sauce ($17): http://bit.ly/20d0ZvR\n\nWe ordered the Gnocchi main to share and it was ok. I like airy and fluffy gnocchi and this was a little dense and the tomato sauce was one note. For my main, I ordered the much raved about Fettuccine Tartufate. Just like many, I'm a sucker for truffle everythang even though truffle oil is gimmicky and most aren't made from real truffles to begin with. Don't get me wrong, this dish was earthy, hearty, and satisfying but not spectacular. The housemade fettuccine was perfectly al-dente with a wonderful toothsome chew but the black truffle sauce was merely truffle oil.\n\nD E S S E R T S\n*Panna Cotta w/ berry sauce ($7.50): http://bit.ly/1kVKnsf\n*Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($7): http://bit.ly/1MWx1T0\n*Tiramisu ($7): http://bit.ly/1M3mfhB\n\nMy fav of the three was the panna cotta which was custardy and deliciously creamy. The cr\u00e8me brulee was good as well but nothing special. The tiramisu was disappointing, it was way too wet and the ladyfingers had no texture. \n\nService was efficient but a bit brusque. Even though it was a packed house, our apps came flying out of the kitchen. Ours main arrived shortly after our empty apps plates were taken away. The kitchen is definitely an well-oiled machine so if you're on a time crunch for dinner, Lupa is a good option.\n\nDining at Lupa is like dining at someone's living room. It's casual, warm, and inviting--there's a fireplace in the front dining room and an open kitchen in the back. One major negative is there's no ac. It was unbearably H-O-T (it was cold outside). We had to fan ourselves during dinner and every time someone would open the front door, it was like having a phuckin' body orgasm. Acoustics aren't the best either so not recommended for a quiet, intimate dinner.\n\nEasy street parking on the weekdays before 6 pm. Allow an extra 5-10 minutes for finding parking on the weekends.

It does have a good amount of space and can seat a large group. \n\nService - All the waiters speak with a lovely italian accent and they are so nice. We didn't have to wait long to order and all the food came out quickly.\n\nFood - Really good. We had the burrata e speck appetizer, which the cheese was so creamy and light. It paired very well with the arugula. I had the duck tortellini special in a creamy sun dried tomato sauce - soooo good. My husband had the meat lasagna - again really good; layers upon layers of pasta filled with a delicious meat sauce and super cheesy. The pasta was so fresh and thin.\n\nPrice - It was a little pricey. For 2 people, the bill was about $100 (including a glass of wine each).\n\nA wonderful spot that is walking distance for us. I gave it 4 stars just because I do have incredibly high standards for italian food after living in the northeast for so long and because it was a bit pricey.", "author": "Lisa D."}

Speaks for itself, at least for me. \nAlways nice to have a reservation as they aren't a big joint, and can be full on a busy night. OpenTable makes it easy. It's got a nice Italian, candle-lit atmosphere. You can be dressed-up if you like or you don't have to be. You'll never feel out of place.\n\nStarted off the with mussels/clams. \nMussels - definitely cooked right with all of them opening. Not the most amount for $13, but it does the job. The spicy tomato broth (not spicy) is all right. I like white wine cooking for my seafood. I feel like this tomato broth was not too special, but you can imagine using the bread to dip in is always a nice touch.\n\nNext up pastas!\nI usually get the Fettucine Tartufate. Absolute truffle magic! Aroma is trufflicious. I feel like one of the those truffle sniffing pigs. So many mushrooms too! If you at all like truffle, you gotta try this. If you've never had truffles, you gotta try this. If you hate truffles or are allergic, probably not a good choice for you.\n\nAlso had the Risotto special (what kind..? Truffle of course) - this one wasn't as great. I don't think the truffle sauce and rice go that well together...\n\nOf course desserts:\nCreme brulee - Pretty standard fair. Had the nice caramelization on type with the soft, custard below. I liked it.\n\nPanna cotta - Amazing! It had raspberry drizzle on top. All I can say is that Lupa, you could probably ditch that. The Panna Cotta itself has the right taste and texture. Rolls down the pharynx elegantly. I loved it. \n\nCome here if you like Italian. I'll be back for a fifth.", "author": "Edward L."}

There was no early dinner crowd as we were able to get a table right away a little after 6pm. When they gave us bread to start, it was cold and I thought this might be trouble. My biggest pet peeve is cold bread. Can't restaurants at least throw some heat on and warm it up a tad? I mean really, it takes like 15 seconds to give customers the illusion that it's freshly baked. They also gave us a platter of virgin olive oil without balsamic vinegar to dip but my request for some was quickly accommodated. \n\nThe rest of the meal was actually quite delicious.  After I got over myself, I ordered the table three entrees to share; the pork chop, the spaghetti with seafood, and the ravioli with ricotta cheese and spinach. All three were decent but the pork chop stood out for me. It was succulent and not overly cooked. The white wine sauce added tremendous flavor and the bitterness from the brussels sprouts cut through all the richness.  My only minor complaint is about the seafood in the spaghetti dish. It looks like they gave me the children's seafood edition because all the clams and shrimp were miniature. I would've like a little more fish and less shells, if you catch my drift. \n\nService was decent as our waiter did check up on us throughout the meal to make sure it was to our liking. We ended the night with the tiramisu to share and when is tiramisu a bad thing? Never. So we inhaled it, paid our check and left to explore the rest of Noe Valley.", "author": "Quoc N."}

No really, I'm serious--if I could, I would gorge myself on different types of food 24/7. That being said, I generally don't like going out to eat Italian too much. It's not that I don't like Italian food, I absolutely LOVE it, it's just so hard to find Italian restaurants that serve quality-Italian food that satisfies. Anyway, Lupa Trattoria was a great little gem (thanks Tina)! \n\nThe food was amazing, and our waiter told us that their mozzarella is actually imported from Italy. I'm swooning, and I need more of that mozzarella in my life! It's literally melt-in-your-mouth goodness!!! All of the entrees were amazing as well, though the truffle sauce for my mushroom Fettucine (Fettucine Tartufate) did seem to be a bit too overwhelming towards the end of the meal--I have no complaints about the any of the dishes. My friends and I each sampled everything amongst us, and the general consensus was that everything was incredibly good! The house special was tortelloni (stuffed with duck, and some other ingredients, but it was SOOOO GOOD). \n\nUnfortunately, we had no room left for dessert. But, hopefully next time I can manage to order the panna cotta--it looks heavenly in the other reviewers' pictures! \n\nThe only reason why this isn't a 5-star review is because we weren't offered any bread, at all--even after being seated for 45 minutes. Everyone around us were given bread and it wasn't until we asked for it (twice) that we finally got it. I think the busboy/bread person (not our waiter) was a bit overwhelmed that night.

My husband Matt B. and I ate at Lupa Trattoria while we were in San Francisco, and if this place were near our house, we'd be here every weekend.\n\nWe made a same day primetime reservation, for Friday night at 7:30. One of the many advantages of a good neighborhood Italian spot--top tier food without the heat and hassle. We showed up a little bit late, but were shown to our table right away. The space was lovely, unassumingly appointed, with a vibrant, cozy ambiance. Busy, with tables close to each other, but in a good, cozy kind of way. I spied pretty shamelessly on our neighbors' pasta. Service was great, warm and professional. We had red wine by the glass--a primitivo and a falco rosso, I think were the designations--and enjoyed a wonderful meal.\n\nThe food was outstanding. We ordered the burrata and speck to start, and helped ourselves to the fresh bread in the basket. The burrata and speck were unimpeachable, great separately, and great together. There were three generous globs of milky burrata, and a nice sheaf of silky Tyrolean speck, over a bed of lightly dressed arugula. I ordered the bucatini amatriciana for my entree after ogling it so openly that I just went ahead and asked the guy at the next table if it was as delicious as it looked. He said that it was, and he was right. The pasta was cooked a perfect al dente, tossed with caramelized onion, pancetta, and Romano cheese in a tomato sauce. It was everything I ever want from a red sauce pasta, flavorful, robust, and just deeply, deeply satisfying. Matt's ravioli alla modenese was also great, pillowy homemade spinach ricottta ravioli with fried garlic chips in a rich brown butter and sage sauce.\n\nLupa isn't really a hot spot for out-of-town visitors--we only found it because we had after-dinner plans in the Castro and looked specifically for a place to get pasta nearby. Next time we visit, it'll be more intentional. I'd go out of my way to eat that bucatini again.", "author": "Steph C."}

My rule is to go to a restaurant at least twice before I give it a rating, unless it's absolutely horrible.

I do not appreciate the negative rants from rookie foodies. \n\nSo, my wife and I have had dinner at Lupa twice in the last 4 months with either friends or family. We enjoyed both times because the restaurant is small, quaint and in a good neighborhood. The parking is easy, meaning that you can find street parking within 2 blocks. \n\nWhat I appreciate the most is that the restaurant will accommodate my low sodium & vegetarian diet (call ahead) plus you get to speak with the cooks and the owners. Our favorites are: RAVIOLI DI ZUCCA (I requested my sauce to be marinara), FETTUCCINE TARTUFATE, PENNE ALL`ARRABBIATA (beware that it's fairly spicy, which I love, but most folks will probably think it's too spicy). \n\nLooking forward to coming back again.", "author": "Al G."}

With a hungry stomach and a craving for some carbs, I went with the hearty Fettuccine Tartufate. The description on the menu sold me when I saw MUSHROOMS and BLACK TRUFFLE SAUCE.

Stumbled upon Lupa Trattoria by happenstance while trolling for some Italian food on a recent trip up to SF.  We were just glad to bolt into a warm space on a particularly frigid night, but Lupa serves up an unassumingly good dinner.\n\nThe entrance area is lit with a wood-burning fire and the space opens up into a larger-than-expected dining area.  The restaurant is cozy, quaint, and is a good place to come with friends, family, or a date.  \n\nWe started off with the Crostini Sampler (a special that night) and it was a hit.  The crostini was good and crusty and the high-quality mozzarella was warm, milky, and just chewy enough.  There were 3 varieties: sweet red bell pepper, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and prosciutto.  Of the three, the mushrooms had the most flavor, but I liked prosciutto the best.\n\nThe table got 3 pasta dishes to share family-style.  The special of the night was a Spaghetti di Mare-- mussels, clams, and shrimp in a light tomato-based sauce.  The Pappardelle Sugo d'Agnello featured homemade pappardelle in a lamb bolognese and the Fettuccine Tartufate served homemade fettuccine with porcini, shitake, and oyster mushrooms in a black truffle sauce.\n\nAll the homemade noodles were outstanding in texture and doneness-- ribbon thin and just the right amount of chew.  The pappardelle in lamb bolognese, in particular, was really great.  The fettuccine dish was bursting with a lot of mushroom and truffle flavor, but the dish became a bit too heavy and one-note after a while.  The seafood spaghetti was perhaps my least favorite-- the sauce was under-seasoned and the shellfish was overcooked. Would pass.\n\nService was spotty throughout, but overall, I enjoyed my wonderfully carb-y meal.

It's intimate and cozy without being dull.\n\nThe menu is equally simple but quite good, two pages filled with about two dozen creations.  I had the tortellini alla cardinale, filled with ground beef and pork and smothered in a pink cream sauce littered with chanterelles, peas, and prosciutto.  It was excellent.  The other standout was the penne alla rugantino, drizzled with warm olive oil, caramel isles onion, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives and Romano cheese.

Even the olive oil they served with the bread tasted much better than it does at other restaurants. I ordered the fettuccine tartufatte and it was out of this world! The pasta was incredibly fresh and flavorful and there was a generous amount of mushrooms all cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the penne all arrabiata which was supposed to be spicy, but wasnt spicy at all. Instead it had more of a smoky flavor. That was disappointing, especially since we requested they add vegetables to the dish and the waiter said that would compromise the flavor of the dish...\n\nIt's a cute and cozy space, however you're packed in so tightly you can't have a conversation because of the noise. You feel like you're having dinner with multiple people and over hearing way too many conversations because it's such a tight fit. Lastly our waiter was a little rude.

Flavor wise, it tasted better than the $300 white truffle pasta dish I had in Rome near the Pantheon, and the similar priced black truffle one in New York. This one is only $16.00.! What a bargain. It's oily, yes, but that's because it has truffle oil so expect it to be.\n\nTheir Caesar salad is just okay.\n\nTheir pasta is what I've always had, and to be honest, I've only tried their pasta with lamb meat sauce, or their lasagna. All of which are consistently good, but hands down their Fettuccine Tartufate is the best.\n\nSure there's no Roman Coliseum nearby, or Trevi Fountain to throw your loose change into afterwards.\n\nBut you're paying for pasta; tourist staples are something different altogether.\n\nI'm saying 4 stars because the service has been hit or miss the 5 times or so that I've been here.", "author": "Jack R."}

Lupa is a quaint and unassuming trattoria on 24th Street in Noe Valley with excellent service and very good food. \n\nBecause it was our first time there, we decided to order a lot of food so that we could sample many dishes and  flavors etc. \n\nDrinks: \nPeroni- beer (my favorite Italian beer--always psyched to see it offered on menus) \nMontepulciano d'Abruzzo- wine by the glass (hearty and tasty) \n\nAntipasto: \nWe split a very fresh and tasty spinach salad that was dressed with a light raspberry vinaigrette, walnuts and goat cheese. \n\nPrimo Piatto: \nWe split the Bucatini Amatriciana which was $15.00  It's a straw shaped hollow pasta (like a thick spaghetti noodle) with caramelized onion, pancetta and Romano cheese in a tomato sauce \nThis would have been enough for a main course. It was seasoned beautifully. The onion/pancetta combo was perfectly partnered with a rich tomato sauce. \n\nSecondi Piatti \nWe ordered separate main courses and shared everything. \n\nThe Saltimbocca alla Romana was $21.00. It's veal scaloppine topped with sage and prosciutto in a white wine sauce with mashed potato and swiss chard. This is going to be my order again the next time I am at Lupa.  What a wonderful dish!   Saltimbocca literally translates to \"jump in the mouth\" and that's what this entree did! \n\nWe also ordered the Filetto di Maiale al Vino Rosso which was $19.50.  It's a pan roasted pork tenderloin wrapped in smoked bacon, mashed fried polenta and swiss chard \nAgain, this was an entree that made both eyes and mouth water.  The wine reduction glaze was very good. \n\nDinner started with warm, crusty bread to be dipped into a delicious olive oil . When desserts were offered we really didn't have any room left--but, I did order the Torta di Limone (white chocolate/lemon cake) \"da portar via\" ( to go)! \n\nLupa is a great find.  Dinner came to $110.00 after taxes.", "author": "Thomas D."}

We asked for water when we sat down and were ignored by the guy lighting the votive candle and then our waiter came over a few minutes later and again, we asked for water. He brought us water and a loaf of BURNT bread! with a very pedestrian and flavorless plate of olive oil. Why would you let a charred loaf of bread out of the kitchen to serve your diners unless you just didn't care?\nThe menu looks good, but don't be fooled. \nI was hungry so I ordered an appetizer of pears with mascarpone cheese wrapped in prosciutto, on a bed of greens. I didn't want to believe it, but the pears were from a can! and I was finding dried, dead stems of parsley everywhere in the salad which was dressed in with the same tasteless olive oil and what tasted like distilled vinegar dressing.\nMy main was the gnocchi with \"wild boar\" ragu and my husband ordered the special of seafood pasta. The gnocchi came from a package and so heavy you could build a cabin with them. The \"wild boar\" ragu was so salty, it was all I could taste and I could not taste wild boar, at all; actually, all I could taste was salt. Hubby's dish was ridiculous...over cooked shrimp and calamari which tasted frozen and old. Actually, all of the seafood tasted frozen. \nOur waiter asked how everything was and my husband told him exactly what was wrong with his dish.

Lucky for her, Lupa is the total package: charming, attentive Italian waiters who keep their lips to themselves. Also, the food was really good.\n\nI was immediately struck by the cozy and warm atmosphere here. The fireplace was particularly welcome on the cold, rainy night as we waited for a table. The bread was warm and chewy--superior to most restaurant bread. My duck was good, if not memorable, but the pasta dishes got rave reviews all around. And the latte was possibly the best latte I've had in a restaurant.

A had just gone here (for the first time) this past Wednesday night, loved it, and wanted to go again with me.\n\nAlthough we decided pretty early that we were going to make a date night out of it, A didn't check until we were about to leave the house (at about 5:30pm) whether there were any reservations available.  There weren't.  The earliest available reservation wasn't until 9:00pm. \n\nWe decided to head out there anyway since it was early and just hope for the best.  If we couldn't get in, there are plenty of restaurant choices in Noe Valley to choose from.\n\nLuckily for us, when we got to the restaurant, the host was hanging outside and cheerfully opened the door for us.  We told him we didn't have any reservations, which he seemed completely and totally shocked about, but he said he would look and see what he could do.  \n\nAt this time, it was about 5:50pm and there were only about 4 or 5 tables occupied.  I'm guessing most of the tables were reserved.  He found us a cute little table next to a window where we could see a little fountain.\n\nOur server was excellent and constantly stopped by to see if we were ready to order or to make suggestions.\n\nWe started by sharing the Insalata di Zucchine which consisted of thin shredded zucchini soaked in a truffle oil topped with some cheese and an olive crostini.  Super yum and flavorful.  But I LOOOOOVE truffle oil.  Just cook anything in truffle oil and I'll probably love it.  Except asparagus.  I probably wouldn't love that.  Even if it were soaked in truffle oil.  Asparagus and I do NOT get along.\n\nSpeaking of asparagus though, for my entree, I picked the Anatra Al Marsala, which was a pan roasted duck breast in a marsala sauce, farro and grilled asparagus.  Yup, I picked a dish with asparagus.  I didn't want the asparagus, but the rest of the dish sounded delicious.  Lucky for me, A loves asparagus, so he ate mine (which he said was delicious for you asparagus lovers out there).  The duck was cooked a perfect medium rare and the farro was delicious.  I've never had farro before, but it kind of reminded me of brown rice, but fluffier and definitely not as hard.\n\nI can't remember the name of A's entree, but it was basically spaghetti with seafood, i.e., mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp.  He said it could've been a little bit spicier, but that was just a personal preference.  He's not crazy about mussels and/or clams, but he still ate them and said they were delicioso!\n\nWe shared the profiteroles for dessert.  I recommend getting this.  There are four on a dish and the chocolate sauce smothering them is absolutely YUMMY!\n\nDefinitely make reservations because lots of people were getting turned away while we were there and the restaurant was packed.  Price was about $80. including tax/tip and one glass of wine.", "author": "Kris L."}

Parking was relatively easy for us as we were early. \n\nWe had reservations for 6:30 and walked in at 6 and were seated immediately. For the apps, we had the mussels & clams and the melted smoked mozzarella cheese with the sauteed mixed mushrooms. The mussels and clams were pretty fishy tasting. Nothing too special. I was actually expecting the mushrooms to be sauteed together with the cheese, but it was a round dish with the melted mozzarella on one half and the sauteed mushrooms on the other half. \n\nFor the entree, I had the tortellini and when it came, it was absolutely drenched with sauce. I began to regret not going for a run that morning. The tortellini was good overall, but the sauce was too overwhelming and I was feeling so full. One of my family members got the fettuccine with the mushrooms and I wanted to eat hers instead since the sauce wasn't that thick and I love mushrooms. I got a taste of some of the specials that my family ordered. There was a chicken that was seasoned well, though the white meat was a little dry for my taste. The ahi tuna entree tasted great. And the pasta with the seafood was pretty standard. \n\nThe service was great. Our waiter kept returning to check on us and refilling our water jug.

He leverages the skills he gained at his family's restaurant to create some very delicious and authentic Italian dishes.\n\nWhile the menu is filled with ingredients common to Roman-style cooking, it is definitely influenced by the bounty of fresh produce available in the Bay Area.  Served on a bed of spicy arugula, the burrata with Tyrolean speck ($12.75) was good, but not quite as creamy and soft as it should be.  Insalate misticanza ($7.75), a mixed salad of organic, young lettuce with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar was fresh and tasty.  Rich and savory, the gnocchi al cinghiale (potato pasta with wild boar, $16.00) was a perfect dish to warm diners on a cold summer evening in The City.\n\nServers are Italian through and through--welcoming and warm.  The Italian-centric wine list is well priced with a sufficient, but not overwhelming, number of selections available by the glass and bottle.  The only downside was the lack of a sparkling option by the glass.  An Italian restaurant without a Spumante or Proseco by the glass, what gives?\n\nAcquerello need not be worried:  Lupa is not (and is not intended to be) a fine dining establishment.  Lupa is a good example of what it was intended to be:  an enjoyable, affordable, homey choice for a casual Roman dinner.", "author": "CJ G."}

Must note, I've only been here once.\n\nI ordered the fetuccine tartufate- 4* dish- mushrooms and truffle oil with fresh noodles.  It was a larger portion than expected which is great.  I rarely get to eat fresh made pasta, but from what I noticed, it has a more solid texture or \"bite\" than the dried pasta.  That was different for me and I didn't really care for it, but don't worry, I will learn to appreciate (like coffee) the taste of better, higher quality food items.  The medley of flavors with a hint of truffle oil and assortment of mushrooms were delicious-  it did not make me miss meat. \n\nNow onto my cousin's dish- tortelloni alla cardinale- was disappointing.  There must have been old cream because the sauce had a gross sour taste to it.  The portion was a lot smaller than my order and for the $16, I would expect a few more pieces tossed in.

The menu was simple, and the specials were truly specials.  You know this because they ran out of one dish.  The wines are imported too.  We opted for the gnocchi and the risotto specials.  Mi piacci!  I felt like I was sitting at the Segnora's table once again.\n\nLupa is truly a neighborhood gem.  It is far away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Parking is easy if you look, and the prices very fair.  Just remember to make reservations.  It's cozy for a reason.", "author": "Marichelle M."}

One of the best pastas I've ever had!  Rich, sweet, fresh.  I'm officially an addict.\n\nMr Mo gets the fish usually and snarfs it up.  There are plenty of vegetarian options.

Before I even left the restaurant, I was looking forward to my next visit-- and I can't wait!\n\nMade a reservation for 4 on a Thursday night-- didn't seem necessary although halfway through our meal the entire restaurant was full.  We were a little late to arrive and the host/server(/owner??) wasn't bothered! \n\nCarafes of water on the table-- and never a moment when it was empty.  House rosemary-infused high quality olive oil and fresh baked crusty italian bread.  Wine or beer offered, but not pushed! Love that!\n\nWe started with the special celery root and fennel soup-- amazing.  It doesn't sound all that exciting but the soup came out beautiful, layered with flavor, and hot! All for only $7-- and large enough for two.  We also started with the Pear & marscapone wrapped in proscuitto served with some greens & olives lightly tossed in a vinegarette-- simple and delicious, again, big portion-- suitable for sharing.\n\nWith our appetites pleasantly wet, we ordered the lasagna, pappardelle with lamb bolognese(2 orders) and the tortelloni with pink cream sauce, peas and proscuitto.   Every dish was mouth watering!  The fresh, house-made pastas make all the difference.  The bolognese had intense and perfectly cooked lamb-- I could eat the bolognese by itself its so good!  The lasagna was on point-- no frills but delicious all the same, a classic take!  The tortelloni-- a huge plate, stuffed full of beef and pork.. with a pink sauce that I believe is a similar to a vodka sauce that has depth!  Portions were just right here! I have a feeling almost every menu item is as delicious as the next.\n\nAfter such a perfect meal, we couldn't leave without dessert.  We ordered the chocolate tarte and the creme brulee.  The creme brulee lacked in sweetness for my personal taste but was creamy and crisp-- a surprising raspberry buried inside.  The chocolate tarte had vanilla gelato, a raspberry coulis and almonds baked inside.  The star of the desserts, I'm sure-- one bite was not enough.  So many tortes are extremeley rich, but this was perfectly balanced!\n\nWhen the restaurant filled up the service slowed down a bit, but every staff member was busy and happy to do whatever we requested.  I don't mind waiting a bit longer when it's obvious the staff are busting their butts to make customers happy! It's hard work you know!

Overall our table of seven enjoyed the experience. \n\nFOOD:\nAntipasti to share: \n1)Vongole-mussels and Manila clams in a tomato broth - nice size portion (we each had 3 or four pieces), mussels and clams were tender and juicy, broth was great for dipping the bread. Small deduction for temperature-it wasn't hot enough. \n2)Burrata-Daily special salad with arugula, fresh creamy mozzarella and  prosciutto- super fresh and delicious. A delightful dish and again, good size portion.\n\nEntrees (I tried some from everyone and the rest were duplicates):\n1) I ordered a daily special entree - pan seared ahi tuna on a bed of spinach and potatoes. The tuna was perfectly cooked, lightly seared on the outside and rare on the inside. It was a tad bit salty, but still delicious. A little too much olive oil on top for my taste, but hey its an italian restaurant so what else should be expected? Overall a good dish.\n\n2) My wife ordered the Spaghetti alla Pescatora - seafood (clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp) of which I ate half. \nA big portion, seafood was fresh and sauce was tasty. Again a minor gripe for temperature-wish it came a bit hotter. \n\n3) Fettucini with crab-I just had a small taste of it, but the pasta seemed well seasoned and perfectly cooked. \n\n4) Tortelloni with beef and pork- tasty filling and the cream sauce was good.\n\nDesserts:\nTiramisu - creamy and delicious, although we all noticed that a portion of it was much sweeter than the rest. Somehow the sugar was mixed improperly but I must say that the part that wasn't overly sweet was very good.    \nChocolate Torta - nice flavor and consistency.\nProfiteroles with chocolate - divine, perfect little cream pastries with chocolate drizzled on top. \n\nService: Our waitress was sweet and hard working, but seemed a bit overworked. Seemed like she was covering too many tables and was running around quite a bit. Didn't know if the place was understaffed or just hectic. Had to asked the busboy several times for more bread and water. One time He refilled one bread basket while neglecting the other (obviously meaning our table had two). Overall I would just say that service was at the 15% tip level, meaning just ok/average. I think if they hired one more busboy, it would help a lot. \n \nLast minor gripe - I always have extra affinity for restaurant that serves their bread warm.

The four of us all had different meals and each one of us were extremely pleased. I had the gnocci dish that was to die for. Definitely will be going back as this will be a neighborhood favorite!\n\nThank you Lupa!", "author": "Erika v."}

Our friends ordered a ravioli dish and the other ordered a vegetarian pasta dish.  All was fantastic and we scarfed it down quickly and happily.\n\nI could not stop eating the bread though.  It was so crusty and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I couldn't stop eating it...and I finally asked the waiter if it was baked in house or where they purchased their bread.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they baked their own bread.  Fantastic!  Not only is the food delicious, but the break was great.  A few minutes later the waiter drops off at our table a loaf of fresh bread wrapped in a plastic bag and said \"for you to take home.\"  I was beyond thrilled!\n\nI think this may be my new Italian go-to place.

That being said the reason I can't give it more than 3 stars is because the food was a little bland, there was something lacking from each dish that could have made the whole thing amazing. \n\nI got the seared tuna, and I was surprised by the portion. It was a large slab of fish! I will give them that. But just because it is a lot of food doesn't mean it was great. They seared the tuna perfectly but didn't give anything out of the ordinary in terms of complimenting the tuna. \n\nMy sister got the mushroom pasta (all types of mushrooms in a cream sauce with truffle oil). It was surprisingly bland... I don't know how but it was. \n\nMy mom got the lamb bolognese pasta which was good, but again very bland. \n\nThe main problem with this place is that they don't go out of the ordinary.

I had the tortelloni w/pink sauce which was amazing too. Last time we had the lasagne and bucatini which was so flavorful and cooked perfectly as well.\n\nMost of the wait staff and the owner (who was there tonight) seem to be Italian which lends the restaurant a more authentic vibe...loved hearing all the Italian spoken between the staff. And the service tonight was superb...our waiter was a guy w/a soul patch and small ponytail from Genova. He was incredibly attentive, without being intrusive, and was really wonderful with our 3 yr old son too. The last time we went there, we had a different server, an older gentleman whose service was very efficient but not as warm. And all the busboys were super friendly too and paid special attention to our son as well.\n\nThe decor is casual w/lots of dark wood and a very neighborhoody feel which we appreciate even though we don't live in that 'hood.

We also had the prosciutto, pear and mascarpone appetizer which was delish and I had the special soup which was carrot and ginger. The soup was very good. I had the fettucine tartufate and my man had the lasagna all bolognese. Both were very tasty and we each had some leftovers which we'll enjoy tonight.

We told the waiter about the special occasion and he shrugged it off with a comment about his own age. We watched the wait staff sing happy birthday to another table but at the end of our meal the only thing we got was the bill.

We had wine to start. They bring you a basket of great bread and the most out-of-this-world EVOO for dipping. Seriously, the bread is merely a vehicle for the olive oil and yet, the bread is wonderful too.  I love good olive oils and this one is stupendous. Apparently, it is infused with rosemary, garlic and chili pepper. Leaving the heaven of this, our group had salads and the fungi fettuccine, pasta with sun dried tomatoes, and the gnocchi. We all raved. For dessert, I shared the gelatto. One member of our group had the lemon tart with white chocolate. I can't tell you about that because he would not share! Ha! We liked the attentive but not obtrusive wait staff. The only complaint I have is that the tables are a bit too close together - so much so, that you may be bumped as people come and go.

Lupa was fantastic.  Reservation was easy to get, place was casual, food was top notch.  Great for kids, the children at the table were treated very well, and we saw other families with kids of varying ages.\n\nWhat we loved:\n-  The really fruity olive oil they poured for bread dipping:  super tasty and complex\n--  The mushroom pasta:  Very umami.  Excellent.  Wish we'd ordered this for the adults, instead we had to watch the little boy at our table scarf most of it down (what can we say, he loves mushrooms).  Our plaintive \"can we try some, darling?\"s were met with laughing dismissals, though we managed to sneak some when he wasn't looking.  \n-- Wild boar pasta. Mr. T. adores meat-sauce pastas, and it's the yardstick by which he judges Italian restaurants.... he said this was one of the better ones he's had.

(You can't go home again....)  Last night I found myself walking into Lupa.  I used to walk past this little eatery every Sunday morning on the way to Mass at St. Phil's.  (Mom...I swear I went to Mass every week back then!!!  I swear!!!)   So how does a nice Italian boy not go into a local Italian restaurant after walking past it every Sunday morning for a year and a half?  (This is not a rhetorical question.  I am inviting you to answer.)  The only answer I could come up with is that from the outside this place looks as tiny as Chris Daly's brain.  How do you disabuse yourself of this notion?  Walk in dummy!\n\nThe restaurant is much bigger than it appears from the outside.  It has a ton of tables that can be used like a Tetris game to mix and match combos.  We had a table of four adults and one baby.  Behind us was a hooooge combo of about 12 adults.  Most neighborhood joints cannot handle large parties, but Lupa can.\n\nThe menu is large enough to warrant multiple visits.  What I was impressed with was the large selection of specials.  Usually a local place has one or two per night.  Lupa had four different entrees and three different ant-pasti.  We started with the Scarmoza ai Funghi.  Damn that was good.  It is a huge portion of melted smoked mozzarella with a generous portion of mushrooms swimming in the cheese.  Delicious.  We also shared a salad special of artichokes and shaved romano.  Good, but it paled in comparison to the other appetizer.\n\nFor my main course I had the risotto special.  It had small pieces of asparagus throughout and a generous portion of eight shrimp arranged in a circle in the middle.  Very filling and very tasty.  The bread that came in endless supply was soft, warm, and delicious as well.  We all ate so much bread that dessert was not an option, so I don't know how good or bad their dolce is.  We ordered a nice barbera for the table.  Even though someone else ordered the wine, the waiter pegged me for paisan and brought the bottle to me.  Thumbs up for keeping it in the family.  \n\nMy only complaint was that the wait staff had a heck of a time getting the division of the check correct.  We actually had to tell them they had undercharged us.  Several of them spoke more Italian than English.  Since this place is a block away from St. Phil's, I'll extend some Catholic forgiveness to my swarthy Mediterranean cousins.  \n\nEver wonder why Rome ruled the world for a thousand years?

There were 2 adults & 2 preteens in our party and we were seated at a 4-top right by the open kitchen counter. It was a lively atmosphere and exactly what I'd expected in that respect.  Simone (male server, not sure of spelling) was busy but attentive.  We ordered the scamorza ai funghi appetizer (melted smoked mozzarella with mix sauteed mushrooms) and it was a small crock of cheese of molten cheese with a smattering of mushrooms - tasty but not worth the $12 price tag; 3 pasta dishes - gnochetti special with rock shrimp & asparagus, ravioli special (sorry not memorable enough for me to recall) and risotto special with shrimp & calamari - and all three looked - pink & creamy - and tasted the same; and the veal scaloppine, which looked and tasted like pork and had to be cut with a knife.\nFor dessert there were 2 gelatos (1 all chocolate & 1 vanilla & cherry combo) both were creamy & delicious, and an order of profiteroles. I prefer my profiteroles with a bit more \"crunch\", these felt and tasted like they'd been filled long before they were served.\nWe ordered a couple of glasses of \"house merlot\" and I must say it was quite good, perhaps the best thing on the menu!  Unfortunately despite asking several times we never found out what it was.\nPerhaps a busy Friday night was not the best time for a first run and I know some people LOVE this place, but in all honesty I'd rather take by $150 and go somewhere else.

This stands in further contrast to other restaurants in the vicinity, where my memory recalls me consistently paying more, oftentimes for less food.\n\nEnough focus on thriftiness, and Noe Valley.

We ordered family style and shared everything which they split and had the most amazing fettucine with a tomato mushroom sauce. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! The bomb!\n\nWe started with the proscuitto, pear and marscapone and it was delicious.

My wife and I joined some friends here for dinner a couple nights ago and we were astonished at the quality of the food, the amazing (but somewhat rare) combination of friendliness and service offered by our waiter, and our overall experience here.\n\nWe ordered what turned out to be way too much food (but were glad we did) and we ordered strategically so that we could share and try more things (also glad we did!).\n\nBetween the four of us, we ordered:\n\n. scamorza ai funghi (amazing melted cheese and sauted mushrooms in a ramekin - so delicious!)\n. insalata di spinaci (typical but excellent spinach salad)\n. gnocchi al cinghiale (regular potato gnocchi (vs. ricotta gnocci below), great texture, delicious sauce)\n. ravioli di zucca (not at all too sweet, as butternut squash ravioli sometimes tends to be)\n. saltimbocca alla romana (perfectly cooked)\n. a breaded sole filet from the daily special menu\n. homemade ricotta gnocchi with italian sausage, also from the daily specials (super soft gnocchi in an outstanding sauce)\n. for dessert, we all shared one panna cotta with fresh berry coulis (amazing texture -- I've never been a huge fan of panna cotta but am now a convert, at least as far as this one is concerned)\n. various espressos and teas along with our dessert\n\nWith dinner we had a chianti that the waiter recommended, and we all agreed that it was exceedingly delicious and amazingly went with all of our food.\n\nI unfortunately don't have enough time right now to describe each individual dish, which I know would ultimately make this a more useful review, but everything was excellent.  The one exception to this was the sole filet, which was still better than average, but is not something that I would write to mom about (although apparently I will write to the Yelp community about it).   Besides this, though, the flavors were full and rich.  Maybe a bit salty, but I seem to think the same thing about EVERY restaurant, so it's gotta be me, not the place.   \n\nAnyway, I just checked and their website has their menu complete with fairly meaningful descriptions of the dishes so you can get more info on the dishes there.\n\nWe loved our waiter because he was friendly and attentive, and also not afraid to make suggestions when asked.  My wife, Karen, asked which of two main courses was better and the waiter unhesitatingly recommended one over the other (I can't remember which things), and although we didn't try the one he guided us away from, the one she chose was delicious.  Our waiter (whose name I never got) made our experience more fun by occasionally good-humoredly joking with us.  Never annoying or over the top, just low-key and fun.  \n\nWe hadn't seen our friends in a long time, so we ended up lingering a bit longer than we would have otherwise, and on this particular Saturday night, although the place was packed the whole time, we didn't seem to be keeping any hungry customers from getting a table, so they let us linger as long as we wanted to, and kept cheerfully refilling our water glasses until we left.\n\nUltimately, when it came time for the bill, I actually gave a 30% tip.  I don't usually get so hardcore on tipping like that, but I'm also not very often that impressed with the excellent combination of factors that led us to have a spectacular time.  My only concern now is that next time I go back they'll have an extremely high bar to live up to!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWent back again on Saturday night, and this place kicked a** again.  I definitely still give this place two thumbs up, and I'd give it more thumbs if I had more thumbs.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOK, so updating my review for a third time is bordering on being either like a psycho Yelp! stalker or a Lupa brown-noser.  But I just can't help myself.  We went back here again with new friends, and 1) I discovered that our favorite waiter's name is Stefano and 2) I realized why he makes our experiences here amazing.  He actually watches what's going on and times his appearances accordingly.  We were dining with friends who we hadn't seen for a long time and who had just gotten engaged.  So lots of lively chatting going on at our table.  \n\nBecause I happened to be facing in the right direction, I noticed that Stefano always waited until just the right time to show up (waiting for a pause in the flow of conversation), never interrupting us except to bring the food that we had ordered (delicious as always, so much so that our avid cyclist friends even ate the fatty melted cheese dish!).  Stefano's careful consideration to the timing of his appearances was so well executed, though, that I don't think my dinner companions noticed -- they just enjoyed themselves.  His conscientious service really made our dinner wonderful, so much that I decided to risk my fellow Yelpers thinking that I'm a dope for updating my review a third time!", "author": "Chris S."}

Immediately upon walking in, the server came and greeted us and gave us a warm welcome.  Oddly they don't have a hostess, but maybe that's a good thing.  I really liked the atmosphere - nice, simple, elegant Italian restaurant that felt casual, cozy, but not bumping elbows.\n\nOur family shared a couple of appetizers to start - Bruschetta w/White Anchovies and the Beef Carpaccio.   The bruschetta was very tasty even though I'm not the biggest fan of anchovy.  The beef carpaccio itself was ok, but the accompanying arugula was very fresh and delicious.  A few of us shared salads and tried the fennel and blood orange salad and also the caesar salad.  The fennel salad was very different, but quite tasty.  I really enjoyed the juicy blood orange.  The caesar salad was very classic and had a good anchovy taste.\n\nFor entree, I had the Fettuccini Tartufate.  Their homemade pasta is really good, and the combination of different mushrooms with black truffle sauce was delicious!  However, I must warn you that it is a very heavy dish.  If I had known it would be so rich and heavy, I probably would've ordered something else.  But if you enjoy mushrooms and truffle sauce, it is definitely a quality dish.  I also has a bite of the Tortelloni alla Cardina which was also pretty good, and the grilled rack of lamb was very tasty.  Throughout the dinner I felt that service was very good, and our server was friendly and made our evening very enjoyable.  He even remembered that a couple of us had been here before!\n\nAre we done yet? No, of course not.  Can't leave without dessert!  We ordered a Tiramisu and trio of gelato for the family to share.  When our server brought out the dessert, he also gave us the white chocolate lemon tarte on the house!  How can you not be happy about free dessert?  The Tiramisu was pretty good, although I prefer my lady fingers to be a little bit more soaked, but still a great way to finish an Italian meal.  You can't really go wrong with gelato, and the white chocolate lemon tarte was very different and delicious!\n\nOverall I had a very enjoyable dinner and I never felt rushed or cramped.  You could almost forget that you're in SF and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of Lupa.  I definitely wouldn't mind going again!", "author": "Mai S."}

Initially, I was suspicious why we can always get a table, but after many visits -- usually during weeknights -- I am just happy to waltz right in for good food, good service at a good price.  3- course dinner for two with a bottle of wine around $100. Go back? Si!   \n\nPlace.  Located on 24th Street between Diamond and Castro, you can easily walk by the low-key entrance of this narrow space, but just look for the image of the She-Wolf suckling Romolo and Remo (thus the restaurant's name) stenciled on the window.  Once inside, you will find a split level dining area in warm hues, soft lighting, delicious smells and happy chatter.  The upper level with a view of the open kitchen is my preferred area.  \n\nService.  No host table or snooty receptionist to face, just a hearty \"welcome\" from whichever waiter -- and yes, they really are from Italy -- is around, who then grabs menus and invites you to choose a table.  Generally friendly service, sometimes spotty when it gets busier.  Full of Noe Valley locals and their visitors, it's a super place to relax, chat, dine, linger... not a place if you are in a rush.\n\nFood.  Not to be missed is the daily risotto special.  I have had many variations and have never been disappointed with the perfectly cooked rice with whatever ingredient is reflective of the season.  One of the most memorable was on a cold, wet evening, when it was wild mushroom risotto with a drizzle of truffle oil -- OMG!  thought I was in heaven.  (Tip: it's way too rich to eat as a full course by oneself, so order it as one of your \"primi piatti\" maybe together with a salad and share it with the table.)  \n\nAll of the pastas are good and hearty; the meats are nicely done -- nothing fancy, but definitely tasty.  Take the duck or the lamb: medium rare; generous portions; flavorful sauces; accompanied by a starch like mash potato or farro.  But what makes the dish for me is the braised dark greens -- chard or rabe -- that just exude goodness and health.  (The cornish game hen is good too but a little tricky/messy to eat on a date night. ) If you can manage it, try the warm apple struedel with honey or chocolatey profiteroles for dessert.  Yum!  \n\nWine.  The wine list has an interesting selection of Italian wines.  I usually stick with a glass or a bottle of Argiolas (only $32), which is a simple but earthy wine from Sardinia.  \n\nBene appetite!", "author": "Yan L."}

And it wasn't until I stepped back out into the chilly, autumn night that the warmth dissipated...\n\nBoth literal and figurative, warmth emanated from the fireplace, the hostess/waitress, and the incredibly comforting homey appeal of the interior.  I felt like I had just walked into my Italian friend's dining room, which happens to be outfitted to seat 50 or so of their closest friends.  This feeling was enhanced after I was greeted by our oh-so-amiable waiter, complete with the Italian accent.  He was kind and helpful and clearly loved the food he was serving, and just so very pleasant.  Thanks to him, I ordered the most delicious fettuccine with mushrooms galore in a delightful truffle sauce.  I took my first bite, and that was it.  I knew I had found a near-perfect place, and more than that, I knew I would be back again to experience the joy of the atmosphere and the food.\n\nWith an entree like that, I couldn't just stop.  There was no question about it - we were ordering dessert.  And when I discovered everything was housemade???  And I thought I was hooked before, but now I was beyond beyond reeled in!  The white chocolate lemon torte was...  light, with a mousse-like consistency, and lemony.  And the white chocolate managed to remain innocuous (keep in mind, I don't like white chocolate, but I just LOVE lemon that much, to order such a dessert...).  As we were enjoying our dessert, the restaurant was clearly closing up and the staff was having their dinner.  But in no way were we made to feel rushed and unwanted.  And when we left, our waiter even stood up from his table, where he was enjoying his undoubtedly delicious dindin, and shook our hands as we made our way to the front door.\n\nLupa is such a lovely find.

It's a simple, well-balanced dish. The first time I had it, I was blown away. The taste of fresh pasta is as perceptible as that of fresh seafood and this dish had it. The second time I sampled the pappardelle, it packed less punch but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\nOther pastas I've tried include:\n\n- The penne with carmelized onion, sundried tomato, kalamata olives and romano cheese. I thought the pasta was overdressed in olive oil and after a few bites, I got sick of this dish.\n\n- The homemade gnocchi with rock shrimp and asparagus in light tomato sauce had a lot of potential. The shrimp was very fresh, and the sauce was tasty. But I was horrified to discover that half of the gnocchi (potato-based pasta dumplings) was overcooked, resulting in a mushy texture that was unpalatable.\n\nI've tried two salads from the appetizer menu, both of which were disappointingly mediocre:\n\n- The caesar salad was overdressed and served chopped rather than my preferred form factor with whole romaine leaves.\n\n- The thin julienne sliced zucchini salad with truffle oil and shaved parmigiano cheese served with olive paste garlic crostini is a bit strange to me. The julienned zucchini is not bad although somewhat forgettable but the accompanying olive paste crostini is a mismatched partner. The two items just don't seem to belong together. \n\nFrom the secondi section of the menu, I've sampled the pan roasted pork medallion, an aggressive recommendation from the charming waiter. He insisted that everyone who has ordered this dish from him has thanked him profusely. So I complied. Indeed, the gorgonzola sauce (and I don't even like blue cheese), mashed potatoes, and endives are excellent companions to the hearty piece of pork, but the pork itself was overcooked and thus dry. \n\nI've tried one dessert item: the lemon tart, which was tasty although not something I would order again.", "author": "Baochi N."}

The wine list is adequate and reasonably priced. Got the Creme Brule for desert and was satisfied. Not the best I ever had but still really good. The space is kind of small but cozy.

It had great reviews on yelp, so I was looking forward to trying it out.  Plus, it had gnocchi, which is my favorite!!  So we get there and they seat us right away (even though we were almost an hour late for our reservation bc of a very shoddy cab app).  I got the caprese salad and gnocchi al cinghiale.  the caprese was the best caprese I've ever had!  Heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella balls, and delicious basil, oils, and spices.  The gnocchi was a little disappointing tho.  The sauce has a 5-hour braised wild boar in it, so I was anticipating a lot of flavor.  I've never had wild boar before so maybe there isn't much flavor, but it was very mild for my taste.  I wish i would have gotten an arrabiatta sauce or something.  My friends got the Pappardelle Tortufino--which she loved--and the raviolli--we decided the best dish of the 3.  The service was a little off at first, but our waiter was a cool guy...got us a cab while we were paying the check and everything.  Overall, a good experience.  But if you like spice, stay away from the gnocchi.", "author": "Caitlin E."}

It wasn't - structure was poor, it was a loose mess, the tomato sauce was seriously under spiced and it was just overall bland and disappointing. Also, parts of the dish were much warmer than others, which meant it came to my plate straight from a microwave. \n\nThe penne on the other hand was really decent, with excellent mushrooms and great olives.

Service was excellent, the wait staff warm and friendly, and the food was very good.   As the birthday girl, our waiter was particularly sweet to me.  \n\nI'm nursing a hangover, so I apologize in advance for writing this review in list format.  Let's get straight to the important part:\n\n- The mushroom risotto special was just as good as previous reviewers have mentioned.  It was not overcooked as is so common in other restaurants. \n- I had the antipasto that consisted of mixed sauteed mushrooms and a puddle of melted smoked mozzarella.  Am I embarrassed to spoon melted stringy gobs of cheese into my face?  Hell no.  I recommend piling the cheese and mushrooms onto a piece of their lovely bread.  I also recommend sharing this dish, it was a bit too much for one person, although I ate it all anyway.  \n- Salad is large portioned, so definitely share between 2 people.\n- A standout menu item is the fettucine with mixed mushrooms and truffle oil.  Wow.  Their pasta is amazing. \n- The bread is really good, be careful not to overindulge while you are waiting for your appetizer and entree, or you'll end up stuffed.  Yes, I said appetizer AND entree.  You will want to order more than one dish, it would be criminal not to.  If you eat like a dainty bird, then split your antipasto or salad with someone else.  Also, if you eat like a dainty bird, you are not eating out with me.  Ever.\n- Ambiance is a bit loud, but not overly so.  It was full on a sunday night and mostly families.  Lighting is warm and flattering, suitable for a casual family dinner or a romantic one.  \n- There is this one guy who brings the shaved parm and black pepper grinder to the table... omg he is hot.  omg omg he also has an italian accent.  \n- Service is excellent, but encourages a long leisurely meal.  We were there for a bit over 2 hours.  Did not feel like a long time, but if you are making plans after dinner, opt for leaving lots of buffer space between your meal and your next destination.  It is worth it to sit back, relax, and enjoy a big comfort-carb plate of pasta and a bottle of wine and lots of good conversation.  \n- If you live in the neighborhood or regularly visit this restaurant, they recognize you, get to know you, and treat you like family.  This is the kind of restaurant you want to come back to again and again.  I cannot stress enough how amazing service was at Lupa.  The attentiveness and sensitivity of the wait staff were on par or better than the most expensive restaurants in the city.", "author": "Courtney Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-10", "description": "Another stop on my quest for good Italian! \n\nThe place has a warm, comfortable vibe you can't fake. The two-tiered dining area is flanked by a fireplace by the door and an open kitchen at the back. Warm colors and dark wood predominate. It looks elegant from the outside in a Nuevo Noe Valley way, but the inside has the sort of \"neighborhood restaurant\" atmosphere I crave, without the loud suburbanized version you see in a lot of mommy-daddy 'hoods. Homey and classy. With very Italian waiters.\n\nThe food was warm and comfortable, too. Not the segregated flavors of Cal-Ital, but the slow-cooked, somewhat mild blend of flavors, colors, and textures I was craving. A spinach salad with ricotta had a perfectly emulsified dressing, and the walnuts I rejected weren't missed at all. The gnocchi al cinghiale was the best I'd tasted since Norcia, with the gamey pork stewed \"for five hours\" into a buttery and rich sauce. Filletto di maiale presented a small medallion of tasty pork loin, cooked a bit well done, but coated in a wonderfully sweet and savory sauce and paired with silky (not at all bitter) Swiss chard and panfried polenta wedges that seemed like a cross between buttered popcorn and Texas toast. Everything had that well-cooked, well-blended, well-composed smoothness of flavor and texture you don't always see in local cuisine. Cook the food damnit! A long conversation with the server about driving around Central Italy helped connect the food to previous experience, and helped me appreciate it more. Dessert? The tiramisu was spectacular, substituting zabaglione for mascarpone to make the whole thing just a little gooier, in a good way. Phew. A nice selection of wines by the glass helped complement the meal.\n\nI don't spend as much time in this 'hood anymore, but if and when I do (or nearby), this will be one of the places I go to for real Italian comfort food. I add a fifth star for the overall satisfaction with the experience. The appetizers stay at $10 or less, the pastas at $15 or less, and Secondi range mainly in the high teens to low $20s. Not bank-breaking prices, and well worth it for the atmosphere and taste.\n\nUpdate: I've returned, and that cinghiale is still excellent. This is the most Italian place I've found in the Bay Area so far in attitude, atmosphere, comforting food, and service (yes, that's a slightly backhanded compliment). I'm bumping to five stars just because the whole experience has been repeatedly great--a rare thing for local restaurants.", "author": "Matt R."}

I knew that corner well, I used to work for Cotton Basics back in college, and I couldn't recall any such place.  But we pulled up to a stretch of 24th that I hardly recognized. There was Lupa, a small, dark, split level restaurant. \n(****Note: the rest of this review is skewed since my evening here revolved around a special wedding party of ~30 people.****)  \n\nThere's something to be said about the company making the meal,  for this was one of the most delightful meals I've had in recent memory.  The FOOD - I loved every bite of it!  Our first course was an antipasto platter w/2 prosciuttos and a salami, green olives and mozzarella balls. I had several thin salty-great slices wrapped around a bit of their crusty bread. 2nd course was a spinach salad w/raspberry vinaigrette, caramelized walnuts and goat cheese. I cleaned my plate w/hardly any dressing left - sign of a well dressed salad!  Then came a 3rd course ravioli in a tomato sauce w/roasted whole garlic cloves.  I pretty much cleaned that too, even the roasted-til-they-were-sweet-mild-and-soft-garlic cloves.  Then the main courses arrived...at the beginning of the evening the waiter gave us a choice of lamb chops or a salmon steak.  My sister selflessly took the salmon while I had the lamb (we both LOVE lamb). But of course we shared.   They were BOTH soooooo good. Medium rare lamb chops with a nice rim of fat, wilted spinach and a balsamic reduction, and the salmon baked to a tender meltyness with haricot vert, both meats & veggies resting on a mound of buttery mashed potatoes. \n\nThere was a lot of wine, champagne and Italian-speak flying about the elevated back half of the restaurant, where our party's long tables were splayed out.  We ate, talked, walked around, ate and talked some more for 3 straight candlelit hours! Turns out the groom (and most of the guests) is from Italy, and friends with the owners; hence their willingness to host this reception. However, it was noted that they became friends cuz Lupa was the most authentic food he'd come across, food that reminded him of home.  All the staff were very nice, cheerfully filling glasses and joking with the guests (in Italian, which I don't understand, but whatever).\n\nI'll save going all 5 stars til I've dined here a few more times, and since mine was not a typical evening at Lupa.

First of all, we never even meant to go there in the first place. We were looking for Firefly, couldn't find it and gave up. So we wandered into Lupa after checking out the menu and were (relatively) promptly seated right in the middle of the small space. \nThey didn't have the wine we wanted, but the very charming waiter guessed out next pick and already had it in hand. I have never sent back wine in my life. I feel unqualified to do so. But Friday night was the closest I've ever come. We both took sips and not wanting to sound like a bitch, I kept my trap shut. \nMikey, however, instantly said, \"I hate this wine.\"\nBut we did nothing about it, so that's our fault. \nWe decided to begin by splitting the pear and prosciutto and I practically broke my knife cutting into this thing. The pear was so far from being ripe, I'm amazed it entered the kitchen, much less made it onto an actual plate. My mom does this thing, where she'll stick an unripe pear in the microwave for 30 seconds and suddenly, unripe fruit is edible. \nYou guys, I wanted to pop this shit in the microwave. \nThere were literally 5 pastas on the menu that I thought sounded AMAZING, so I asked the waiter for a recommendation. He steered me to the pappardelle with lamb ragu (I know. Sounds so good, right?), but didn't seem that excited by anything. I could rave about pastas till the cows come home, but this guy wasn't into it. \nThe pappardelle was WAY too al dente. I know it's all sophisticated and shit to have pasta that's perfectly done, and overcooking this delicate carb is a cardinal sin, but I'm talking crunchy, folks. And the ragu wasn't even that hot. \nMikey's pork was really boring and dry, and while he likes his sauce, I hated it.

If you can manage it, finish with a cup of strong espresso and a lemon tart, because fruit will help you justify all the fat and carbs you ingested before it.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

The food is awesome, and the prices aren't too outrageous. The service is nice too, very attentive but not ass kissy. Would make it a regular place if I could afford it more often. Last time I was there our server suggested a wine that was probably some of the best wine I have ever had. Both times had the panna cotta for dessert and it was amazing.", "author": "Jenice M."}

Went here for the first time in about 3 years, last week, and wondered why I had waited so long. Oh yeah - I no longer live in Noe Valley. No, seriously - for some reason, I had just completely forgotten about it. No specific reason other than poor memory. But I'll remember it for next time, for sure - totally casual but nice ambience, friendly staff (all smiles), delicious and relatively inexpensive food, they didn't laugh or roll their eyes when we asked if we could have a couple of entrees and even a salad split for us before they came to the table, the wine menu was decent enough, and it was crowded but not too loud to talk.

The appetizers were excellent, especially the crostini and the polenta.  We shared our four entrees,requiring extra places, which can be a fine balancing act on a mid-sized square table.  All the entrees were terrific.  We left some room for dessert and had the tiramisu, which was superb.  The profiteroles were a bit disappointing.  The chocolate sauce they used tasted like store bought cheap stuff.  It would have been better without the sauce completely, especially since I accidently bumped my left sleeve against the top of it and wound up wearing some of it on my light blue shirt.  I would go back again on a weekday when the parking is less competitive and the noise level is a few decibels less.", "author": "Neil F."}

We didn't make a reservation but we liked what we saw on the menu, and we walked in to see if there was table available. A very charming waiter with Italian accent came to greet us and seated us right away.\n\nWhile we were waiting on our order, we were a bit worried b/c for a Saturday night at 7pm, there sure wasn't many people. Thank god we were wrong. Three of us had the carpaccio, truffel risotto, duck breast, and veal, and they were all very declicious. The carpaccio was just alright, standard dish, can't go wrong with it unless they serve lunch meat (seriously, a restaurant did that to us once in ITALY!! Can you believe it).  Truffel risotto had a very cheesy taste, and personally I love the aroma and taste of truffel, so I loved it. Hubby's duck was pretty good too, it served with barley as rice and broccli leaf. The duck sauce had a special flavor, very tasty. My veal was very good. Even though I was expecting a big chunk of veal chop on the plate, and it turned out to be 2 or 3 thin slices of veal, it was still very good. It also has very flavorful sauce all over the veal, and it served with mashed potato and kale. Even the mash potato was very good. It was very milky and buttery.\n\nThe environment was comfortable. You can be casual or dressy, very flexible, and the waiters were all very nice and friendly.\n\nI would love to give it a 5-star cuz overall it was a great experience, nothing negative about this place, but I thought it would be unfair to the other fansy-smancy places where I also had great experience with well-known chef's creations.

It was hard to get someone to notice that we had arrived...no one was coming over to the door, but once they did notice we were there, we were seated right away. It's cute and cozy and not too large inside. There were a lot of specials... I had one, an ahi tuna spaghetti dish. Very yummy. Jay had a pasta dish with pieces of lamb or something in the sauce, which was good but not as good as mine. J had the veal, which he said melted in his mouth. The only thing is, it was tiny. Mine was large. The bread served at the beginning was tasty too, although we never got plates to put the bread on, from what I remember.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-02-17", "description": "Well, I had my hopes after reading some of the reviews of Lupa.   I showed up with three friends on a Friday night at about 8:00 p.m.  We only had to wait twenty minutes for a table, which seemed quite reasonable.  There was a crowd outside that looked to be waiting longer, but hey, Friday night, right?  \n\nWe ordered two appetizers.  There was a carrot-ginger soup that was a bit thick and not very flavorful, though it did have two or three buttery croutons that were incredible--I would have gladly eaten a bowl of them.  The fennel and blood orange salad was fine, but again, not much flavor there.\n\nWe had four entrees, three of which were pasta.  A strangely unseasoned seared swordfish that was overdone (how do you overcook something that's seared?), served over bland potatoes and wilted spinach, though my dinner companion was pretty happy (he's not picky, lucky guy).  Pappardelle with lamb bolognese sauce; the pasta was a bit more al dente then I like, and the sauce was good but again, bland.  The lamb in the sauce was great, tender and flavorful.  The pasta was nicely coated with the sauce, but there was not enough to soak up even a corner of the tastily chewy ciabatta-like bread that the waiter was kind enough to refill after we demolished the first basket.  The penne (or some kind of tube-shaped pasta) with carmelized onions, olives, and sundried tomatoes was unexciting, and again, too chewy, a.k.a. al dente (yes, I know that al dente is not mushy, but it's not supposed to be hard to chew either). Why sundried tomatoes?  They're kind of dated, and they went out of style because they don't play well with other ingredients.  The butternut squash with sage ravioli was way too sweet--the sage was crispy and delicious, but just couldn't balance the sugary ravioli filling, and the ravioli was overcooked, in an odd contrast to the other pasta dishes.  All of the portions were very generous--after the soup, I could only get through about half on my dinner, and they packed up the rest for me.  \n\nTwo of the three glasses of wine we ordered were really enjoyable, a crisp Pinot Grigio, and something cabernet-like that was big but very smooth (wish I'd paid attention, but I wasn't drinking).  The chianti was a bit chewy and sharp, not great.  At around $7-9 per glass, I thought the wine was kind of pricey, but boy were those glasses full.  No one needed a refill.  There did not seem to be any non-alcoholic drink options on our menu, except tap water or Pellegrino.  Bummer for me.\n\nDesserts were huge and extremely good.  The flourless chocolate torte with walnuts, toppped with vanilla gelato and raspberry sauce was perfectly balanced and addictive, and the profiteroles were perfect--delicately chewy pastry, amazingly creamy custard, and a nicely bittersweet drizzle of chocolate all over the pastry.  Heck, I don't even like profiteroles, and I was smitten with these.  Two desserts were more than enough for four of us.  The desserts pretty much saved the meal.\n\nService was fine, with an Italian waiter and a chef coming by consistently and often, and in that somewhat friendly but slightly diffident manner that I find in the servers at many Italian restaurants.  (Guessing that's a cultural thing.)  They let us sit at the table for at least forty-five minutes after we finished eating, no rush to turn over the table, though at that point, no folks waiting either.  It was really a pleasant place to just sit and chat.  The women's bathroom was icky.  Bad lighting, not very clean, and piles of paper towels just left out on a ledge.  Not what you'd expect from a mid-range restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance was relaxing, a little loud, but somehow cozy as well.  Later in the evening, the music came on, and was too loud, and not good (or memorable--soft rock?) .  We got to sit by the front window, and I really did enjoy the window bench with extra pillows for back support.  That's at only one table--we pretty much lucked out.\n\nOverall, the food was unexceptional and slightly overpriced.  I got the feeling that, given the inconsistency of the doneness of out dinners, the folks in the kitchen were either overworked or a little careless--probably both.  Lack of distinct flavor was a reoccurring problem.  I'm puzzled as to why someone would give Lupa more than three stars.  Perhaps if they're Noe Valley residents who like to walk to their neighborhood restaurant, and have fairly authentic-seeming but tragically underseasoned Italian food in large portions.  OK, and killer desserts.  I get the importance of that.  And a quality wine list, which matters to a lot of people who aren't me.  Since we only had one entree and three pastas, I would entertain the notion that the other non-pasta entrees were more exciting.  But if the pasta isn't good, I'm not going back to find out.  \n\n(I really miss Ponte Vecchio on Valencia and 23rd.  Killer food, a charmingly diffident yet very sexy Italian waiter/proprietor, and great prices.)", "author": "Joe B."}

The food was all amazing!  \n\nOur server had such charming personality and was extremely helpful with suggestions, descriptions, and was overall very accommodating to us all.\n\nI would absolutely recommend the pan roasted duck breast.  It was so flavorful with an excellent sauce.  It came with delicious rice with a complementary citrus flavor and grilled asparagus that was to die for.\nI literally savored every bite.  Easily one of the best meals I've ever eaten.\n\nThe prices are definitely reasonable.\nAnd with the excellent service we received, I cant wait to come back here.\n\nI should mention that it is a rather small place, so you may want to make a reservation to avoid a long wait.", "author": "Christophe B."}

At first we used to overlook it as a top Italian in Noe/Mission district since Lupa was so close, must be convenience bias we figured. However, we found ourselves truly preferring the pasta dishes here while sitting in other restaurants (many with much higher prices!?). Whenever we host out-of-town friends from NYC or Boston, Lupa never fails to please. Try the lasagna or tortelloni, my favorites!", "author": "John A."}

The waitress charged my credit card an extra dollar!  I know what you are going to say- you are cheap maybe you made a mistake.  I had been checking my bank account balance online the following week and saw that the charge was 30 and went back and checked my receipt which was 29.  Yes my table only ordered one bottle of wine and all had cheap pasta, but please.  I could have understood if you couldn't read my writing and mistook a five as a six or something like that, but she had to mess up two numbers.  A dollar isn't a lot, but if I thought she had earned the extra dollar I would have given it to her.  Also integrity is entirely underrated!  It is very possible this has happened to me at other places, but I haven't caught them. With as many restaurant as there are in San Fran I will not be back anytime soon.

Tina E  found this spot while scouring Yelp and we were not disappointed. In fact, we really liked it. OK, so it ain't fancy to look at, but isn't there some saying about not judging a book by... anyway, the review is all in the food, dude. I got the butternut squash ravioli with the fennel salad. It was nearly dreamy. Nearly. I have had better pasta, but not in SF in recent memory. Ravioli was plump, but not too big, and the skin wasn't too thick either. A little salty on the outside (a good thing) and nice and soft and sweet on the inside (OK, maybe too much info there, but it was too tasty not to describe a bit). Three of us shared desserts: Tiramisu (pretty standard), apple strudel (warm fruity goodness w/ a dollop of ice cream), and the white chocolate lemon tart (...oh my... so good!). As far as service goes, we entered better than we left. We had 7pm reservations and were seated in a great spot immediately. For every awkward staffer, there's a nicer, friendlier one at your service. As the night wore on, the entryway got a bit stuffed, and we were given our check before being asked if we wanted coffee or tea (which we didn't, so it was fine). Overall, we liked and we'd return to sample the gnocchi and the four other desserts we couldn't fit into our stomachs tonight!", "author": "Dan B."}

Just listen to me, I sound like a snooty yuppy import. But I have to say one thing, that when you eat at a place like this, be prepared for a tasteful experience. My only negator's about this this joint was the fact that when there's kids running around, it can tend to be quite loud. And also they need to fix the draft coming thru the doors a bit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-15", "description": "A cold burst of wind blew me into Lupa where a warm fire and cozy interior decorating created a welcoming homey feel.  The staff was very welcoming in that Italian way, and I felt comfortable rather quickly.  The food was decent, probably a good rendition of Roman fare.  The staff was similarly amicable, but probably over-stretched, as they didn't spend much time at our table, and seemed very hurried the whole time.  Despite the comfortable surrounding, this may have contributed to the fact that I left Lupa in under two hours (too fast for a meal over 100 bucks!).  The menu was a little short, although that can be charming, as it makes you think that Lupa put a lot of thought into their dishes.  I don't recommend the fennel and blood orange salad, but the asparagus appetizer was delicious.  Other than that, I would give the food three stars (it was good, but expensive).  In the end, Lupa gets 4 stars for creating that illusive warm & welcoming atmosphere, and offering friendly service.  Good place for a date if you like northern Italian food (although if you really want to impress, try Firefly first).", "author": "Mr. G."}

A lovely spinach salad tossed with just the right balance of oil and vinegar in our vinaigrette. A perfectly cooked penne served with Italian sausage, funghi and cream sauce. I ordered the special fish of the day: a grilled wild Salmon marinated in lemon and garlic served with chard and beautifully whipped potatoes (that's Italian? Guess so!)  The salmon was so perfectly cooked and flavored I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Seriously, the goosebumps of pleasure appeared immediately. Lovely place. Why not 5 stars?  While the service was good,  we had to wait nearly 10 minutes just to order our wine. And it was not super busy.  I want to be able to order my wine right away, so that I can peruse the menu and figure out what will complement my meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-18", "description": "Before I rate a restaurant, I like to try it at least twice to check for consistency of food and service as well as menu variety. Having lived in Italy and eaten at many trattorias and ristoranti, Lupa gets a solid 4-star rating and is, frankly, one of the better finds in the Bay Area. Both visits to Lupa over a 6-month period between 2006 and April 2007 were memorable, with emphasis on fresh food prepared simply and consistently. The ambience has the feeling of a neighborhood trattoria -- neither pretentious nor too utilitarian. The service is efficient with an Italian attitude -- which is to say, friendly, a little hurried, but with emphasis on the food. Both times, the waiters were attentive and spoke back and forth to the chef who's in plain view of the tables. Sometimes they may appear to be arguing...but really they are just discussing little details in a typically passionate Italian way. The chef wants it just right. The pastas are excellent, and we particularly enjoy the fettucine with mushrooms and black truffle oil. This is a great dish to share as a first course. On our last visit, I had fresh grilled wild salmon served on a bed of chard that was slightly underdone (the way vegetables should be) and then lightly sauteed to perfection -- I also asked for asparagus as a substitute for the potatoes -- which they gladly accomodated. My wife enjoyed mussles and clams in a light tomato broth. The bread is very good too and is great dipped in the olive oil. Overall, the prices and portions are a good balance, making Lupa a good value for a consistently enjoyable meal in San Francisco. The only reason Lupa doesn't get 5 stars is that the service is not refined and the atmosphere isn't upscale like some more pretentious places in the City. But that's not what Lupa is all about....so don't expect refinement it if you dine here. Rather, expect efficient service with focus on good Italian cooking, prepared with a minimum of fuss and emphasis on fresh ingredients, a little olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. We went out of our way to return to Lupa...and will gladly do so again. Oh, and save room for dessert -- they have a nice selection that varies from time to time. Simple but good.
