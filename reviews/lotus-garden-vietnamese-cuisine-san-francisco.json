I mean a 3 isn't that bad but it isn't that good either.\n\nAfter a weekend of traveling, I got back late and wanted some comfort Vietnamese food. So, I ordered for takeout delivery. I ordered shrimp and pork rolls, chicken salad, and catfish hot and sour soup which is canh cua in Vietnamese. I knew their catfish hot and sour soup won't fully taste like homecooked traditional soup but I was still hopeful. \n\nWhen I got my order, I was so excited to cave in and just eat. It was a pretty cold evening so I started with the soup. I took a sip of the soup and could not finish the rest. I hate to bash but this is just my personal experience, the soup had a powerful fish smell. The catfish fillet didn't taste fresh. It tasted like they threw it together last minute. I didn't mind average tasting soup but this was below average to me.\n\nThe shrimp and pork spring rolls were good. They were normal. I don't expect restaurants to go wrong with spring rolls. \n\nThe chicken salad was decent. It was chicken with cabbage salad with a fish sauce based vinaigrette. Though it was fish sauce based but it was light and not overpowering. It tasted good when tossed in the salad.\n\nOverall, the food was average. I think, for the most part, I'll stay away from the traditional home type of soup here. I don't know if I'll come back or order again but it was just a mediocre experience for me.", "author": "Ngoc P."}

I was disappointed because I had talked this dish up to my friend and then it wasn't very good.  \n\nThe shaking beef was really flavorful and delicious but it was served with saut\u00e9ed onions on top of a bed of chopped up lettuce.  It was really odd because the lettuce was too small to wrap the beef with so it seemed like you were supposed to eat it like a salad, even though the beef was hot.  In an order, which is like $13, you get probably \u00bc pound of meat, \u00bc pound of onions and a bunch of lettuce.  If they doubled the beef, I would recommend this dish.  \n\nThe shrimp fried rice was OK, but it tasted like the char from the wok had been scraped into the rice.  They need to throw some salt in that walk and scrub it.  They also cut the shrimp in half lengthwise, obviously to make it appear more plentiful in the dish, so you get like 3 small-medium shrimp (6 halves) and they are dried out from being cut so thin. \n\nThose three small, lackluster dishes and two sodas ran about $44.", "author": "Emma H."}

I honestly don't remember what my issue was, I think I just had very high expectations.\n\nToday, again I was craving pho and I was starving, so I thought I'd give it a try again. And you know what, it was pretty good. Was it the best pho I ever had? No. But this is the only Vietnamese restaurant around. Remember people, we are in Bernal Heights here. It's not a pho destination. There is no travel book that says Bernal Heights THE place to get pho. We are not in the tenderloin. We are not in Little Saigon in San Jose. \n\nNo one is saying, \"Awww man, I'm going to Bernal Heights to get me some amazing Vietnamese food.\" \n\nNo one says that.\n\nNow, tacos and pupusas? Yeah I'm going to judge it pretty harshly in Bernal. This is where you go to get it so it better be good. \n\nGiven this is the only Vietnamese food in the neighborhood, it's not bad. Broth was flavorful enough. Meat was good. Nice chunks of tendon. Strong Viet iced coffee.\n\nSome had complained about the portions on the Yelp. Given in SF you can go get a bowl of ramen that ends up being like... $15, $8.95 for a bowl of pho in SF in a gentrifying neighborhood is not bad. The portion was perfect for me, but maybe for a lumberjack who had a hard day chopping wood (very plausible in San Francisco.... JK JK), then yeah, maybe it's small. Perhaps the restaurant should think of having multiple sizes for people to choose. \n\nSo next time I'm in the mood for pho and don't feel like going for \"destination pho\", I will definitely be back.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

We started looking at menus on line and decided on this one so basically it was a pretty random choice.  When we got there, we were a little nervous because the place was pretty empty. Our party of five was the second one there - yikes! We started with the #2 shrimp and pork spring rolls with a peanut sauce and #50 vegetarian spring rolls with fish sauce.  Both were amazing. For our 5 family style dishes we picked the lemongrass chicken and lemongrass beef.  Both were delicious but unfortunately,  they were both too spicy for me. I would definitely order them again but ask for them without chili. We also had the garlic shrimp noodles which were very light tasting and a top ranking dish.  You could definitely taste the garlic but it did not over power the noodles or the shrimp. Then we had the coconut curry chicken which I think might have been my favorite.  Neither the curry nor the coconut were too strong. It was a nice delicate balance of both.  Finally, we had a vegetable dish but I'm not certain what the name was since it was someone else's choice but it was a great complement to all the other dishes.  FYI, none of the dishes come with rice but three orders were plenty for the five of us.  The service was good. Please don't be discouraged by the empty tables.  Apparently,  the do a lot of take out business as we saw many orders going out the door.  Don't know if we were told ahead of time but the tip was included even though there were only five of us.

It is what I consider to be a very special neighborhood gem, and a place that delivers solid foot at very reasonable prices.  Kathy, the owner, is a really awesome lady who makes me feel at home every time I go there.  My husband and I went for dinner tonight with my son. It had probably been a year since we have all eaten there, and Kathy remembered both my regular order and my husband's regular order!!  Talk about making someone feel welcomed! \n\nI love the appetizer combo. It is a plate full of dry rice papers (that you soak in water until they soften), mini imperial rolls, meats, noodles, veggies, spices, and sauce that you use to create your own delicious rolls. I think that it's an awesome interactive meal, and I have not seen this on other Vietnamese restaurant menus. It is absolutely delicious and a great sampling of different foods.  My husband had the Pho, and said that it had a nice rich flavor. Our 4.5 year old son had the chicken and veggies, and chowed down.. he even started grabbing broccoli, dipping it in the broth and proclaiming \"this is yummy!\".  \n\nIs the cuisine authentic? Honestly, I don't know! I have never been to Vietnam.  Is it delicious? Absolutely!!\n\nI love that Lotus Garden is a nice, clean, low-key place to go with my family. It's great to feel welcomed at a restaurant during prime dinner hours with a young boy who often cannot sit still or stay quiet! \n\nI honestly can't imagine why Yelpers would call Kathy rude. She's a really sweet lady and has always given me and my family amazing customer service. I also do not think itis fair for someone to complain about not being able to order sandwiches in the restaurant. There are no sandwiches on the menu!! There is, however, a huge sign out front that says that people can order sandwiches to go. (I think that this is a separate service for lunch, perhaps?)  In any case,  I hope that you will try it for yourself. It has been a reliable spot for me to eat for around 6 years and I would highly recommend it.", "author": "Sherri H."}

It's quite inexpensive, $4.50 for a tofu sandwich, and pretty standard of the flavor and composition of your average bahn mi (cilantro, pepper, shredded carrot, sauce). The bread was more airy and less crunchy than I prefer my French bread to be, which was sort of meh, but the tofu seemed freshly fried and was quite good.\n\nOverall, I'd go again if I was close by and hungry because it's cheap and pretty good.

I noticed no tripe, flank steak, etc. I settled on their Pho Tai (beef) and I was also craving something crunchy, so ordered their Chagio (imperial rolls). My order was going to take about 10-15 min. and sure enough it did (about 10 or so). When I went to go pick up my order, the place wasn't packed, but it was the start of lunch and they opened at 11 a.m. Nice restaurant. I've been in here only once before when it was  Japanese restaurant. I like that there's been a variety of Asian restaurants/cafes opening-up in Bernal Heights, although I can do without the yuppie/hipster bars.\n\nThe food: I read one person's review on here that the broth of the pho was \"overrated.\" Well, I beg to differ. I'm not a connoisseur of Pho, but I've had pho at many different places. The first time I had it was...let's see...29? 30? years ago in the Tenderloin. When my sisters and I took our first sip of the broth back then, we were hooked. Lotus Garden's broth reminded me of that day. Clear, rich, and oh so good. I did taste a slight sweetness to it though, but I've read that different regions in Vietnam make their pho differently...at least the broth is. I'd have to say Lotus' broth is up there with my usual spot for pho, but not as good as Pho Tan Hoa's. If anything, I could've just slurped the broth itself and forget the beef, noodles, etc., but wanted the whole shebang!! The broth was separate from the beef and noodles and came in a container, while the beef (raw), noodles, bean sprouts, and other condiments came in a plastic container, so you can add them together when you get home. Oh, and if you do order the pho for takeout and eat it at home, make sure you use a large (I mean big) bowl. I kinda miscalculated my bowl and forget that after adding the noodles and beef, etc. would make the broth spill over the sides of my bowl. Luckily I slurped some of the broth and was able to transfer it to a larger bowl and not lose any broth. \n\nThe Chagio, was crunchy and delish! This was an appetizer, but it was a meal in itself. It came with a small mound of vermicelli rice nooldes, shredded carrots and daikon radish, cucumber slices, three huge lettuce leaves, mint, cilantro, bean sprouts, and fish sauce. You get three imperial rolls that are cut in half. I would definitely order this appetizer again just for a small meal. \n\nRight now, I wish I had another bowl of pho because it's another cold day in January. I would definitely order takeout here or have lunch/dinner here again. For a neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant, this is a  reasonably-priced place to eat. I think they just need to add a variety of beef pho to their menu. Other than that, definitely good eats!! =)", "author": "Neni E."}

Usually don't order veggie pho (I mean c'mon, \"veggie pho\"?  Isn't that an oxymoron, or somewhat blasphemous?) but I was recovering from the flu and couldn't tolerate meat or seafood for a while.  The few times I have ordered veggie pho in the past at other places, I was rewarded with yucky blandness.\n\nIt's not easy to make vegan pho flavorful, but I was surprised at how good it was!  Hints of lemongrass, rich and full-flavored, slightly peppery, not greasy.  Even the noodles and veggies themselves were infused with flavor.  I'm sold.  The only quibble (minus one star):  I would like to see more Eastern veggies (bok choy, sprouts) and fewer Western veggies (broccoli, carrots).\n\nMy dining partner had vegetarian spring rolls and stir-fried rice noodles, which he said were also delicious.\n\nOwner and staff are very friendly and helpful.

So good that we ordered another...  \nTo quote my friend, BIll, 'The Garlic Noodles kicked ass!'\nTheir Imperial Rolls were the real deal and were made with Rice Paper and not the Chinese Egg Roll Wrapper.\nWe also had the the BBQ Beef Spring Rolls where you were given Rice Paper Wrappers to prepare your own Spring Rolls.\nThe only thing we couldn't get was Pho, because they only serve it for Lunch.  Will hafta go back to give it the ol' 'Pho Test' some time... \n\nOh yeah, they also have their own Dungeness Crab tanks, so that's another thing to go back for and try with their kick-ass Garlic Noodles.  Apparently they are known for their Crab and their Raw Beef Carpaccio, which are also now on my list.  Will report back...\n\nWe thought that the folks who worked there were incredibly nice people, it is family-owned by Kathy & her husband who is the Chef, and the Food was very good.

Because this place is awesome, and it'd be a shame if they went out of business. After seeing Heart go out of business, I don't want to see another gem go down. Normally I don't review restaurants I like, b/c I don't want them to get crowded, and I don't give bad reviews b/c I don't mind if people crowd out bad restaurants instead of the ones I like. I'm a bad person, I guess. \n\nBut this place is always empty, so, I'm worried, and the food is amazing. Plus, it's surrounded by lots of Asian competition, but it beats them all: Jasmine Teahouse, Pad Thai, the new Siam Saigon right across the street (!), Wild Pepper, etc. I've tried them all, and they're all good. \n\nAside from being the only all-Vietnamese of the bunch, Lotus Garden does something different. The sauce is always light so you can really taste the ingredients, which are fresh and prepared to perfection (especially the veggies and noodles). It's a more minimalistic approach instead of getting hit over the head with a thick sauce: i.e. sweet and sour sauce on thickly breaded protein that leaves you feeling heavy. So not only is it tasty, but it's more healthful, and you don't leave tired and bloated. \n\nEverything I've had on the menu is great, but somethings that come to mind are the Chicken Pho (best I've had), and the Crispy Noodle dish (a bunch of veggies and protein on top of crispy noodles). \n\nPlus, there's never a wait. So get over there and support these guys. Family owned. Mother's recipes. They're sweet. It would be a shame to lose them!", "author": "Ben M."}

Garnished with green onions and cilantro which might seem insignificant to some, but makes a huge difference in taste!\n+  Shrimp and Pork Rolls rocked too!  Had mint leaves, which many Vietnamese places forget about.  The peanut sauce was delish and didn't have sesame seeds, which I'm allergic to.\n+  Never busy (lots of people get take out) so service is fast, yet friendly.\n+  Served the coffee some neat Vietnamese contraption which makes the experience cooler!\n\nCons:\n-  Some items are overpriced.  Shrimp and pork rolls $6.95 for 2 and a really small, about 8oz. of Vietnamese coffee for $3.50.\n-  Total for one order of rolls, catfish fillets ($9.95), 2 orders of rice, and 2 coffees came out to be $30.  I thought that by splitting an appe and a main dish would save me money...but here, not so much.\n-  Portions are smaller than other sit-down Asian restaurants.

I think there was too much condensed milk.\n-  Credit card minimun $10 for lunch, and $15 for dinner.\n\nBottom Line:  I will be back.  That's all that matters right?

We didn't know what to do with the fish sauce and she told us to mix it in with the noodles.  It added quite a bit of delicious zing.

Don't be afraid of the sauce if you didn't have it.\n\nWhen she came to pick up the dishes, she said, \"oh... he didn't like it\" and smiled.  She got my husband just right.  He ate everything, and it was funny that she caught on that he was the kind of guy that would say, \"oh... it's ok\" when he liked something a lot.\n\nAlso, I'm glad the owner is so nice.  One woman wanted extra condensed milk added into her drink to make it sweeter, and she went ahead and did that for the woman.

I also ordered a thai iced tea for myself.\n\nFood arrived about 40 mins later as promised... but right away I saw the Xao Lam was unlike any interpretation I'd ever had before.  The sauce was watery, there were no vermicelli noodles in it (which is pretty much standard), and it was just plain dull.  The spring rolls were pretty good, served with sweet soy... but the garlic noodles were conspicuously prawn-less, and I also had no iced tea.\n(Which also brings up the continuing dilemma of wanting to verify that the order delivered to you is correct, but also not wanting to make the delivery guy wait uncomfortably on your doorstep while you do so).\n\nSo I called them back, and a very friendly (and apologetic) woman told me the driver had picked up the wrong noodles, and he would be back with the correct noodles and my iced tea.\nWell, the prawn-less noodles were pretty good mixed with the dull Ga Xao Lam plus a bit of added Sriracha (saves practically ANY boring Asian meal), so that seemed like a pretty decent resolution.  More garlic noodles... with the missing prawns... would make a good next-day meal.\nSo we ate what we had, and had just finished when the delivery guy came back, bearing my tea... and prawns.\n\nNo noodles, just prawns.\n\nSo... uhhhhh...   Hmmmm.   I guess I'll just pop these in the fridge.\n\n*shrug*\n\nDid I mention that our dinner came to a whopping $40 including a modest tip to the driver?\n\nWe may try them again, as EVERY place deserves a second try, but it won't be anytime soon.", "author": "Greg R."}

I also zoned out watching the crabs move around the tank in the back, vainly trying to escape.\n\nI remembered reading that the Vietnamese crepe was good, and it was tasty enough, if not entirely my cup of tea -- I just don't love bean sprouts (with which the dish was filled) that much. Better were the previously mentioned shrimps, which we wrapped in rice paper  with lettuce, cucumbers, carrot, mint, and basil. Our final two dishes, the lemongrass chicken with green beans and the eggplant in coconut curry sauce, were exquisitely flavored, with complex spicing we couldn't hope to achieve at home.

The best thing has been the chicken pho. Tonight I ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp. I asked to add veggies and was told it would be $1.50 extra, I said ok. I also ordered the fried vegetarian  rolls. When I got my food I found they gave me fresh spring rolls, which I don't like and the veggies for  $1.50 consisted of one broccoli flowerette, some anemic cabbage, 2 pieces of carrot - no joke. Wow. I called them and told the woman she made a mistake with my order - that I had ordered the fried rolls. Rather than apologize for the mix up, she started arguing with me that I made the mistake! That I ordered the fresh rolls. I said no - I read it straight from the menu. It went on like this for far too long - the woman insisting she didn't make a mistake and I did .Unbelievable. She was more interested in making it clear that she never makes mistakes , then correcting my order or apologizing for the mix up. It was very ugly. To top it off, when we finally agreed that they would deliver what I actually ordered,( and I would hand back the unwanted fresh rolls), -  she had to call me back and let me know that even though what I ordered was a dollar more than what they had charged me ( for an item I didn't order), they wouldn't charge me the extra dollar!  Wow. Gee, thanks.  Guess what? I won't be ordering from Lotus Garden any longer. They're not that good and certainly not worth such RUDE treatment. \n.", "author": "W L."}

That was a little odd.  Also, I had to ask for the sauces.\n\nThe pho itself was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  The beef was rare and thinly sliced.  The noodles were fine.  The soup itself didn't seem to have enough going on with it, but perhaps that's because I'm used to ordering pho tai nam which has other meaty goodness inside.  I'm talking about the sort of pho that makes you trawl the bowl over and over looking for any and all tasty bits that remain.  This was not that pho.\n\nI guess I was hoping for more based on the other reviews here.  Oh well.

Our soup had HAIR in it.  \n5. We called to get our money back, and explained reasons 1-4, the hair being the final straw.  The witch on the phone proceeded to tell me that it's Vietnamese food and isn't like other food.  Yeah, ok, why describe a curry coconut dish that has no curry or coconut?  She also told me the order arrived very quickly, I guess an hour is quick?  She denied that any hair could have been in the food, but agreed to refund me for the soup with said hair.\n6. Dude came to refund our hairy soup (within 10 minutes, quite prompt on that one).  They asked for the food back.  WTF.  We had eaten half the soup by the time we got to the hair.  Then threw the rest down the fucking drain because it's disgusting and tasted of hair and nothing else and you a*holes want it back?  Are you kidding?\n\nIn summary, I can't believe anyone eats here.  Even if we hadn't gotten slow service and hairy soup, the food was bad and pretty much tasted like nothing.

L.G. has received a lot of praise lately on food boards and I was apprehensive that it had perhaps been overrated. Of the three of us, one was a certified onion hater adding to my worries.\r\n\r\nMy worries were unfounded as Kathy, the petite and bustling owner, provided us with a great meal. I selected banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe $8.50) to start things off b/c neither of the boys had eaten one previously. The rice flour crepe was filled with a mixture of chicken and shrimp and had plenty of fresh, cool lettuce and grassy herbs to assist in bundling up everything into dippable packages. I love banh xeo and would rate Lotus Garden's version slightly below Bodega Bistro's, but still very tasty. \r\n\r\nBo luc lac (shaking beef) can fetch prices well into the double digit range around town. At $8.95, the juicy cubes of lightly charred beef, garlic, and chile slices were a real windfall. There is something mildly addicting about the accompanying piquant lime juice and pepper drizzled over the tender yet crisped on the edges beef. I would definitely order this dish again. Despite dining companion's allium enmity, he agreed to pick around them when the stir-fried garlic and pepper prawns ($9.50, requested ~spicy~) arrived. The shrimp tasted very fresh and were handled with care. They too had the flavor of a very hot wok but were cooked proficiently. It takes skill to impart a nice char on the exterior surface of meat while leaving the inside moist; I'm not sure who it is, but someone has some skills in the kitchen at Lotus Garden. We also enjoyed chicken with mixed vegetables ($8.50) and there were no leftovers remaining when we finally put down the chopsticks.\r\n\r\nA little bit of effort could transform the interior of Lotus Garden into a far more desirable dining destination. The spare white walls and tile floors would feel warmer and more inviting with a small candle on each table, slightly dimmer lighting, and mellow music in the background. Adding a few more options to the wine list and a more enticing ambiance could attract a lot of the overflow from the crowd waiting next door. Overall, 3.5 stars. As of right now, they do deliver but there is a $3 charge, and pho is only served at lunch time.\r\n\r\n***********************************************************************\r\nI have gotten delivery and take out a few more times and Lotus Garden continues to please.", "author": "Candice L."}

I don't have a great basis for comparison - I've only had pho a handful of times, but so far, this is by far the best I've had.  I've been here multiple times, and I've never been disappointed.  I've tried a couple different soups - beef noodle soup, spicy pork noodle soup, but nothing ever compares to the chicken noodle soup.  Each soup is served with a place full of fresh mint leaves, basil, bean sprouts, and sliced jalapenos.  I'm talking FRESH - like still on the stems, and you can \"decorate\" your soup to your liking.  The appetizers are good too - most recently I had the pork and shrimp rice noodle rolls - fresh and fabulous.

Reasonably priced - for two people, 1 appetizer, 2 huge soups, and drinks (Vietnamese beer and a Thai tea), we are always out the door at around $35 - and we are always FULL.  The seating area is always quiet and spotted with a few tables of people.  The service is WONDERFUL.  Very attentive, yet not annoying - a good balance.  Couple this place with a rainy day or a hangover = heaven.  Another perk - they deliver!  Kudos, Lotus Garden - I'll keep coming back!", "author": "Jenna C."}

So that means when you're posted up on the couch vibing some tv or nursing a hangover, they'll bring the pho right to you.  I love that about that.  Anyway, aside from enabling my laziness, the food is really yummy.  The pho is suuuuper delicious, it's all about the broth.  I haven't explored much else on the menu since the pho is spot on.  Also worth noting, their customer service is next level.  They didn't include hot sauce on my first order even tho I asked for it when I called it in.  When I asked about it, the sweet lady sent her guy back to my place to give me some hot sauce!  That said, be sure to ask for hoisin & sriracha when you order or they won't include it as they say some people don't like it.  ?  Whatevs, this place is great.", "author": "Emily T."}

I used to go there for lunch  (pho) quite a bit when working at home. I've been going to the new location for dinner regularly (about every other week), and the food is excellent. Kathy's husband is the chef, and he does a great job. The clams in black bean sauce (not always available) is exceptionally tasty (compared to other places where I've ordered similar). If the clams aren't available, order beef with the same sauce - the sauce is amazing. Five spice chicken is prepared very nicely (deboned chicken, great flavor), the shaking beef is excellent. For appetizers, the bahn xeo (as a Vietnamese friend once told me, it could be called a \"Saigon Taco\") is great, and the Nem Nuong (pork meatballs marinated in spices and fish sauce) is quite tasty.

Thier pho, especially the chicken, is so amazing that my boyfriend eats it at least once a week for dinner, much more frequently if I am not already cooking.  It isn't on the dinner menu, as with many higher-end Vietnamese places in town, but they will make it on request for a dollar or two more than it costs at lunch.  I am partial to the bbq pork bun here, and we have a hard time deciding between the vietnamese potstickers (NOTHING like a chinese potsticker) or the combination appetizer platter with bbq pork, shrimp, imperial rolls and rice paper/lettuce/vegetables for rolling.\nSeriously, we have eaten that basic meal at least 50 times in the last two years.  But a few weeks ago I finally got the bf to agree to switch the whole thing up.\n\nWe got the raw beef salad, which I haven't had there in years.  It was amazing, so clean tasting and delcious.  It was decided that we will have that whenever we eat in the restaurant.  We also had the Vietnamese Crab and it was fantastic.  We had seen it moving around the tank when we got there and 15 minutes or so later, it was on our plate.  The meat from the body is stir friend with ginger and garlic and molded back in, with the legs and small body portions left intact to get the feeling of working for you dinner.  It was amazing and we have vowed to get there again before crab season really ends.  \n\nWe will still get our delivery of the standard 'greatest hits' items, but have added it back to the list when we want to get out of the house and eat something that will really excite the palate.", "author": "M M."}

That was a couple of years ago. Today, I was feeling under the weather and a craving for Lotus Garden struck. So, I drove over to look for my old haunt and was very sad to discover the restaurant was no more. Then, a miracle happened... I had resigned myself to driving a few blocks up and finding some \"consolation meal\" of a burrito or burger, grabbed a random parking spot, looked across the road and saw a newer, improved version of the same Lotus Garden! Is it really the same place I wondered?! I went in, to find the same owner, Kathy. Now if you are looking for great Vietnamese food, you can't go wrong with this place. But what really makes Lotus Garden wonderful is that Kathy and her husband (the chef) truly love making their food and serving their customers. Kathy said the new place has been open 16 months now (the old place they lost their lease I believe), but they aren't getting enough traffic to pay the bills. She may need to close if something doesn't change. That's why I'm writing this. Sometimes, you don't want a good thing to be discovered/overrun, but if people don't start going here it will vanish, and that would be a big loss to San Francisco. There aren't enough places with phenomenal food where the owner really cares, and you can feast for less than the cost of a movie. If you go, Kathy will be there, and she will answer your questions with a smile on her face and perhaps tell you about her dream of writing a cookbook. Hopefully she will someday because their food is incredible and we'd all stand to benefit from being able to learn how to make it ourselves.", "author": "Shoshana D."}
