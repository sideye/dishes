Was sat immediately during the lunch hour, the staff was friendly and very attentive, the food arrived quickly, and the restaurant was clean and inviting. I had the lunch special, which was the Bento box, where I elected the chicken katsu and California Roll for my entrees.  A bowl of miso soup arrived first, which was well-flavored and hot, followed closely by the Bento box. The katsu was nicely fried with good flavor, the California Roll was very fresh-tasting and good, and the salad was super fresh. Pricing was right on point for downtown SF/Castro area.

Co-workers marveled at how much food I had on my table. Someone exclaimed, that looks awesome! Food came out fast. People were nice and the food was pretty spot on. But the best stamp approval for me is, I think I went to you 3 times that work week. I tried to order something different, but the bento deal was too good I couldn't. I've still failed to try anything else.\n\nBento Items\nChicken Katsu (3/5) - pretty good, I am just picky about chicken katsu. \nTonkatsu (4/5) - larger and juicer than I expected. \nTempura (5/5) - excellent quality, fried well\nYakiniku (3/5) - yummy, but tasted like a poor man's bulgogi. personally just prefer other items.\nAlaska Roll (5/5) - salmon & avocado. not mini-sized. nice balance to all these fried items.\n\nEverything not on bento menu - will I ever order something else?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-13", "description": "If you are on a sushi hunt in the Castro, I wish you much luck because the pickin's ain't that ripe over there. Sure, there's that sleeping tube of a spot, Sushi Time; then there's Takara Sushi on 18th which definitely has its high points; there's also that closet on Sanchez, Eiji, which has the silkiest tofu; and oh yeah, there's Wasabi and that boat place, Warakubune,... Wait a sec, maybe there are a lot of sushi places in the Castro, and Osaka has an enviable location right on Castro across the street from the theater (photo: http://bit.ly/2aRCm2a).\n\nHowever, I found it disappointing in terms of freshness and flavor. Primarily due to its prime spot, it's a most popular, noisy place. I suppose mediocrity is not a showstopper among the club-hoppers. I have to say the server with the sunny disposition helped me feel comfortable at the mini-table right next to the front door. The menu is certainly robust enough, and I started with the $6.95 Yakitori, two skewers of BBQ chicken lacquered in a sweet teriyaki sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2bq9NL3). The poultry was on the skimpy side, and it just made me shrug in utter indifference. For my main dish, I went for the $18.95 Chirashi.\n\nI generally order it when I feel indecisive about the sushi and want to see how fresh their fish really is. It arrived and looked like I was eating the leftover pieces from the cutting board (photo: http://bit.ly/2aKD8Th). Compared to new places like Tsubasa Sushi in Hayes Valley, Osaka doesn't do anything remotely creative with their chirashi. It was just the standard selection of bait that barely passed the fresh smell test. They were also rather stingy with the rice underneath, and it looked like they added tamago to fill in the dish. When I think about it, there ARE a lot of worthwhile sushi places in the Castro. This just ain't one of 'em.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...just plain disappointing\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...crowded and noisy, even for the Castro\nSERVICE - 4 stars...the one area where they excel\nTOTAL - 2 stars...not feeling it in Osaka", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-14", "description": "I may have a new favorite thing. In terms of Japanese food. Beyond nigiri. Osaka's sushi is average for San Francisco -- which means it's good. But they have a broad men I occasionally explore with fear and trepidation -- because I discovered Japanese food late in life (though I've eaten Korean since the third grade). \n\nA little background to explain why Osaka's soba noodles blew me away. \n\nI've been on a 90% vegetarian streak for weeks now. The 10% so far revolves around ham and good quality steaks. I had some carnitas recently that tasted like a dead animal. Same with chicken. Weird, huh? But ham and sirloin are okay. \n\nBut tofu!!??!! Can't get enough plain chunks of it. Not formed in chikken patties or wok fried with sweet sauce. Just tofu. \n\nWell enough about tofu. \n\nSo yesterday the three engines I attend, which normally provide a continental breakfast (you know, donuts and coffee), a nutritious and filling lunch (salad and rice, I have always disliked wings), and a snackable pre-dinner (trail mix and peanut butter crackers) failed to deliver. \n\nAlthough I was on time for all but the last (where there was one pack of crackers left), the other participants had consumed everything else. \n\nAs in 8 people ate 24 donuts and a half gallon of half and half. As in twice the normal number of people were at the lunch. One person was dipping the last piece of bread into the grease left from the wings. Fingers had scooped any traces of hummous. There were smears of Caesar salad dressing to hint at what had once been there. \n\nI found half a banana and two nuggets of watermelon. I was sad. \n\nSo after my last meeting, I was weak and cranky. And my 90% vegetarian leanings made Castro food choices a bit off. Budget inadequate to Catch or Fable. Not craving calorie laden Thai. Not being willing to walk to Church Street for Warakubune. \n\nAnd I thought of Osaka. Bento sounded good. \n\nBut when I sat down, I saw a sign for \"Ten zaru 11.95\" which the sign described as cold soba noodles with tempura. \n\n\"Hmmm,\" I thought. \n\nI saw a few things in the menu that were possibilities -- tempura mushrooms, octopus tsunomomo and the like. But I wanted to ask the server about the Ten zaru. \"Dipping sauce? Daikon? Yes,  I understand the noodles will be cold. I'd also like some miso soup, please.\"\n\nWell -- yum. Yum yum. Yum yum yum. Cold noodles in savory broth balanced by Osaka's always good tempura. One succulent shrimp, crisp green bean all interspersed with refreshing bites of buckwheat spaghetti and sesame seeds dipped into sauce. \n\nIt was light. It was satisfying. I was very very happy. 11.95 plus soup.", "author": "Tim P."}

Lot's of table top seating for  your convenience. The spacing between the tables were a bit small but I managed to fit into the booths.

Yellowtail, Hamachi, with green onions in a roll. It was alright. A nice piece of hamachi in the roll, the green onions weren't overpowering. Not jumping out of my see but for the price, I would get that again. \n\n-Miso ramen for $10.95. This miso ramen was filled with noodles, bamboo, seaweed, egg, pork, onions, and green onions. It was packed with toppings. Throughout the dish, I kept commenting on how many things were in here. Appreciated the amount of food. I thought there was a little too much onions in there and not enough noodles. The flavor was a little bland though, in my opinion. Other than the milky look to the broth, I couldn't really tell it's miso characteristic. Maybe more miso or more salt in the future. \n\nOverall, it was a good place.

You are able to pick 3 items and they'll whip it up in a bento box. I chose the teriyaki chicken, 5 piece sashimi, and the beef. It also comes with a salad, miso soup, and edamame. Pretty decent for $12-$13 especially in San Francisco?\n\nI was really surprised with the quality of the food since I saw a lot of bad reviews here. Their teriyaki chicken was juicy, their beef was soft and flavorful, and the sashimi tasted pretty decent. The most important thing to me is meat to rice ratio in my meals, and I felt like this meal was perfect. They give a generous amount of food, and that made me very happy :)\n\nThe waiter was really nice, and the service was fast because the restaurant wasn't too busy during lunch time.", "author": "Grace H."}

Well, I was wrong. This is a more than decent neighborhood sushi place. If you just wanna go out for an easy bite with friends, then go! \n\nThe presentations are not fancy, but they're straightforward and nice. The simple secret of good sushi is the quality and freshness of the fish; I have never had anything here that was remotely 'fishy,' be it rolls or sashimi. Always clean and fresh and clearly quality.\n\nIf you go on a Friday or Saturday night when all the gay boys are in their drunken party mania mode, service can be kind of random. I think most of the waiters are young with little experience, and do not handle the crowds well. During the day, however, they're considerably more attentive. But still, '3-star service.' Nothing to deter you. \n\nHappy Hour is a real stand out. I go often when I 'work from home' and want to bail early. From 4-6, Happy Hour menu includes discounted saki and beer, and small plates that are not always on the menu, usually in the $3-5 range. So great to share a few dishes with friends, or have on your own before you launch into your 'gay drunken party mania mode!'\n\nIf you want 4-star in the Castro, go to (considerably) more expensive Takara Sushi around the corner.

I personally think this place has the BEST sushi happy hour menu in the city. I am ALWAYS looking out for good sushi places that offer happy hour. I also really like that this place has a legit Japanese (not positive he is, my mistake if I'm wrong of course) chef, which I feel like adds a bit more authenticity. This isn't a place where it's just a bunch of low level prep cooks microwaving and defrosting your pre-cooked food. Granted, I only really come here for the happy hour because all of my favorites are about half off. The happy hour is from 4pm-6pm Monday thru Friday. The menu includes:\n- Edamame roughly $2.95\n- Assorted Tempura $3.95 \n- Fried Calamari $4.95 (My favorite)\n- CA Roll $3.95\n\nSips:\nJapanese Beer (small) $2.50\nGlass of Nigori $3.50\nKaratanba Glass $5\nSmall hot sake  $2.50\n\nI think they have a few other items but those are the ones they list on the board outside daily. I haven't been there in a very long time, but last time I was there they had a pretty large Happy Hour menu. Anywho the quality is pretty good over all, nothing amazing but haven't had any issues with the food here. Yes, the service can be a bit slow but, again, I haven't been here in quite sometime so I'm not really fit to review the service at this time. I popped my head in there this afternoon right before happy hour was over, and the place was empty. I would definitely suggest going during happy hour during the middle of the week if you can. It seems to be little busy so they are able to make your food hot and fresh pretty quickly. I have been here when it's been a bit more crowded too and no major complaints. Don't expect anything super spectacular or amazing but definitely worth a shot! For more authentic, go to Eiji on Sanchez. This place is good though no real complaints!

It was the white paper sleeve kind, and it was totally sealed and untampered with. It just happened to contain not a pair but a single chopstick. I don't recall seeing such an occurrence before at any restaurant. Jeez, talk about cutting corners. Kidding.\n\nI'd been here once before when I literally ran in between screenings of some film festival to order takeout edamame, eat it in the rain outside Q Bar where my L friends (not LGBTQAS, just L this time) were hanging out, then walk back to the theater and shove the rest into my mouth and talk chubby bunny-like with the ticket takers as the festival unpaused.\n\nSo, after a chance MUNI ride that landed me in the Castro, I decided to try this restaurant for real. The servers were nice, and the guy server looked like Final Fantasy. A table was immediately available on this particular Tuesday evening just after 10 pm. Aside from the servers, I was the only Asian. Aside from the servers + the cooks, I was the only non-white person. This doesn't matter to me - I only mention it because I know some people look at these restaurants through a \"how many Asians are there?\" scope. For the record: one.\n\nThe pair of white girls sitting two tables down from me were of the university varsity pullover hoodie variety. I wasn't paying attention to their conversation or their food, but I did take notice when one of them sent a crab (sashimi? roll?) dish back because \"It isn't fresh - it's very bad.\" She opted to just go without food instead of getting a replacement, but she eventually got a plate of something other than crab.\n\nI ordered the $18.95 \"dinner box\", which lets you choose 2 from among 21 items and comes with rice, salad, and miso soup. I chose chicken katsu and calamari katsu, and they were each served with a different condiment. I'd say the dish was... alright. The chicken was on par with McNuggets. The calamari had an unexpected look and feel. There's a texture you'd expect, then there's a \"is this really from the sea?\" texture, which was what I got. Sizewise, it didn't feel like an $18.95 load of food.\n\nI also ordered uni (sea urchin), and a funny thing happened with it. They only had one left, which I received. My server said I'd be charged half since the price was for 2 pieces. A minute or two later, they said I simply wouldn't be charged at all. I didn't know if the prior crab incident had set up a chain reaction of apologetic behavior or if this was just how they did things. In the old days, failure would've meant slicing oneself open then being beheaded. Perhaps this modern rendition was decapitating the price.\n\nSomehow, I can still picture myself here in the future. On most days, it's open an extra hour beyond other places in the area. The service was on-point, but the dishes were each lacking in one way or another.

Everyone was in the back for at least a few minutes before she came out. There were not that many people there at all.\n\nThe waitress said \"oh I'm busy, did you need something?, let me seat you somewhere else where there is 2 person seating, this is for 4\". This is at 9:30pm,  I said \"why cant we sit here? There are so many seats\" - seriously like 10 tables open. She went to \"talk to her manager\", which I saw her walk a few steps and turn back - and told us to move. \n\nMy friend looked at me and said \"Do you want to leave?\" and I said yes. I told the waitress we were leaving - which she said okay. No trying to reclaim our business, I was pissed.\n\nI'm glad I left - because I went to Barracuda down the street and the sushi there was awesome.

It cost $40 after a large hot sake and tips.\n\nThe chirashi ($18.95) was paved with bricks of thickly cut fresh sashimi and Japanese pickled vegetables. When I asked for extra shiso leaves as condiment, the Chef probably gave me a dozen pieces without charging me. And their miso soup had used a more flavorful fish broth instead of just dashi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-09", "description": "We've eaten at Osaka about a million times over the years, and I have to say it's a hard review to write. There seems to have been recent turnover in staff, so for the past year we've experienced kinda iffy service. Capable, but pretty standoffish. Our last visit happened to coincide with a Giants game, so we (politely) asked if they could put the game on instead of the ESPN news channel or whatever it was. The waitress asked what channel the game was on then made some excuse to stall for time. Eventually she asked the sushi chef to change, once we explained what channel it was on. Yeesh, this is becoming one of those annoying Yelp reviews, isn't it? Serves us right because the Giants plotzed anyway, we should have let them leave it on NASCAR coverage.\n\nThe real reason for the three star rating is that nowadays I'd say they're 4 stars at happy hour, when most normal sushi rolls are in the $4 range (we ate six rolls, edamame and gyoza for $33). At regular prices, you're knocking on $50+, and by that time you should just walk the couple blocks over to Amasia Hide's, where the sushi will cost about the same but be of much higher quality and the seaweed salad is superior by far.\n\nBe sure to check the signs around the walls and the specials list. The menu seems to lack some of the typical non-sushi Japanese stuff, but some of these wall signs let you know that you can get some of them (I saw a sign for tonkatsu, for example). Also, there's a sauteed mushroom appetizer that is just fantastic. I didn't notice it on the menu yesterday, but if it's still there it's really worth adding to your order. A nice complement to the typical sushi joint fare.", "author": "Spaulding A."}

Totally different vibes - Barracuda is more modern and trendy while Osaka is definitely more homey like a traditional Japanese restaurant. \n\nWhat first attracted me here was the happy hour menu that was decent. Happy hour here and eat something, then move on next door for more happy hour drinks. A perfect way to enjoy the evening. Sometimes I come here to eat after a night of drinking - I don't usually stay out late much, so them closing at 11pm works out perfect for me. \n\nThe sushi chefs seem to actually be Japanese which is a big plus for me.

I will give this place two stars as their sushi is perfectly acceptable for a neighborhood establishment (nothing special...but fine).  The ramen was just awful.  now I know that there are as many styles of ramen as their are restaurants that serve it.  This was just very unimpressive.  No richness, No porky goodness.  No anything that would recommend it.  The miso ramen was essentially your run of the mill sushi restaurant miso soup with ramen noodles.  The serving of pork chashu was miniscule.  There were unnecessary pieces of fake crab or fish cake.  Not good at all.  My dining partner had the Shou ramen which while slightly better tasting (broth) was still rather unappealing.

I'm insatiable, but Osaka on Castro is one of the few places that has come close to taming the wild sushi beast within me.\n\nMy most favorite things on their extensive sushi menu are: dragon roll (shrimp tempura & cucumber on the inside/unagi & avocado on the outside) & spicy crispy roll (unlike any sushi I've ever had-the whole thing, salmon/avocado/onion, is deep fried & topped with a spicy sauce.) I don't feel so guilty having all that fried goodness because it's so good, it's worth the extra mile on the treadmill.\n\nMy friend swears by their gangsta roll (i think he just likes to laugh at the name!), red dragon roll & pink lady roll. We usually get two rolls each & always have leftovers to take home.\n\nAwesome vibe, very friendly waiters/waitresses, prices are reasonable, quick service. I will definitely be returning.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I usually get takeout from here or stop in if I need a quick bite. I've never considered getting Nigiri because the fish in my rolls is just okay, and it's very pricey for the size/quality - so the sushi has never been appealing. \n\n3 stars is justified by the fact that: \n\n1. The menu is overpriced \n2. Staff are pleasant enough, but not friendly, and I often wait quite awhile before someone comes to take an order or check-in. \n3. Totally mediocre quality, but the tempura rolls are tasty. \n\nThere's better sushi in the Castro - go to Takara on 18th and Collingwood, about a block and half away. Much, much better, and cheaper. \n\nThey do have a pretty cheap happy-hour which, if you're intent on trying it out, might be a more appropriate price-to-quality ratio.", "author": "Haley B."}

They arrived lightning fast (I wondered how you could make them that fast).  When I took the first bite, I realized that the roll was hastily assembled - it didn't hold together well.  And something in the roll tasted a bit off.  The rest of the roll was inconsistent - some parts had more sauce, others none.  \n\nBut the worst was yet to come.  A short time after we finished dinner (it didn't taste so bad, so we finished it), I started having the runs.  Then some more.   Not to get into too many details, I'm now at home feeling pretty sick, and yes, I'm pretty sure the fish was to blame. \n\nOh, and to top it off, my boyfriend is very sensitive to MSG, but it is a bit of a delayed reaction.

Although it hasn't become amazingly great, it has improved a bit over time (which is always a good thing).\n\nMy friend Will and I visit Osaka often, and generally have a tasty and filling meal (before or after a fun night of drinks). \n\nOne of the greatest improvements that Osaka has made was the hiring of Michelle as a server. Generally, the servers here are both inattentive and rude. Michelle, on the other hand, is always incredibly friendly and an outgoing person. The first time I went in to have lunch and read my book, it was a slow day and she stopped to chat with me about what I was reading, as well as what she was reading at the time. And when I left, she was extremely sweet and caring. \n\nI thought it was a one time deal, but coming back with a friend for dinner later on, she was the exact same bubbly and friendly person. While dinner was quite tasty, she made it an even better time.\n\nCome in for the specialty rolls (they have a flaming roll that they serve to your table on fire, and that's pretty neat), enjoy the wonderful scenic options of the Castro (if you're lucky enough to get a table by the window), and cross your fingers that you'll be lucky enough to have Michelle be your server.", "author": "Nicolas H."}

With that said, this place is decent but nothing to come back for or rave about.\n\nMe and my girlfriend ordered their Bento Lunch Box, Caterpillar Roll, and Grilled Oysters. For our Bento Lunch Box we decided on Spicy Tuna Roll + Chicken Karaage, and Ebi Tempura Roll + Chicken Teriyaki. \n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll was \"MEH, I've had a lot better...not coming back here for that.\" Their Chicken Karaage was pretty good, because it had a nice crunch to it but was not soaked in oil. Although I've had better, it was good. Their Ebi Tempura Roll was \"umm...no.\" As for their Chicken Teriyaki, when compared to Tani's Kitchen...it makes this place look like a chump. The flavor is lacking and the teriyaki sauce is more on the watery side.\n\nTheir Catepillar Roll was the best out of all the dishes we ordered. I would say this is a 4 STAR  sushi roll. The rice tasted fresh and had a good flavor. The sushi was tight and compact. And the portions of avocado, eel, and cucumber were on point. \n\nFinally, their Mussels were a let down. The flavor and ingredients they used was REALLY GOOD! It had like this sweet and spicy sauce with the fish eggs. Although it tasted good, they over cooked it to the point of it being REALLY TOUGH and CHEWY :(.\n\nI realize this might be the only Japanese place in the castro, but when compared to other places in SF and even in San Mateo, this place is a 3 STARS at best.", "author": "Nick C."}

The Salmon Teriyaki was bland and for some reason the teriyaki sauce they used had the consistency of jelly???? Weird I know.

I haven't yet met a piece of sushi I didn't like, but finding originality in a commodity like fish in a place like SF can sometimes be challenging.  Case in point: on the whole, Osaka is a really cute little place, but fairly unremarkable.  And yet, there are a couple special touches that bring it up from a, \"Hm.  Well, I'm glad I tried that.\" to a \"Like muchly, would eat again.\"\n\nOsaka, in true San Franciscan restaurant style, is a small, rectangular space.  Running along one side is the sushi bar, and along the other are several tables, chairs, and bench seats run along the wall.  The atmosphere is very casual, and I remember being seated across from the requisite marker board telling me the day's specials in neat handwriting.\n\nI was lucky enough to be there with some friends at happy hour, where the deals were really quite good and where we were presesnted with a small menu of appetizer-like tasties, each for around $5 or less.  The regular prices were quite a bit more expensive, but the special rolls are large, and the quality is very good.\n\nThere were two dishes that really bumped Osaka up to a place of legitness in my mind.  The first was the Chirashi.  It's expensive, but if you're not super hungry it's actually enough for two.  It was this dish that introduced me to the glory of butterfish.  I don't know if it's all butterfish, or just the stuff they serve at Osaka but Oh.  Mygod.  I have never met an edible that was more aptly named.  All the other fishies were fresh and clean and served over rice that was gloriously sticky and sweet.  The other dish that I would really recommend is the Spicy Crispy Roll.  As someone who tries to be health-conscious, I don't really do the fried roll thing very often.  So I was a little dismayed to see so many \"crispy\" offerings.  However, the salmon was fried so perfectly, and that plus the avocado and tobiko (different colors for each piece!) made for a truly extravagant treat.\n\nIn a city veritably swimming with tasty raw fish bits, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to go to Osaka.  But you can bet that if I find myself in the Castro again, it's going to be hard to keep me away.", "author": "Becca S."}

First of all, the CRISPY one is fried... the crunchy one is rolled in eggs.  Just to clear that up.\n\nIt was the perfect sushi... the rice was well cooked and flavored, the nori was not too mushy or tough; and the insides were amazingly fresh and well flavored.  The crunch roll is filled with a spicy tuna mix and was wonderful, very spicy.  The kappa make was adorable in presentation with uneven pieces sticking about- quite wonderful... totaled to $13.\n\nThe tempora udon was my favorite- everything about that udon was perfection in a steaming bowl of broth, tempura and thick wheat noodles.  The vegetables were fresh and it was a gianormous bowl for only $13.. which in retrospect seems expensive, but for quality sake was great.\n\nFinally, my recommendation to all of you.. try the unfiltered Nigori sake for $4.50 a glass.  It is cloudy in appearance, smooth and has almost a coconut milk taste and texture- amazing flavor and not the typical nail polish sake.\n\nSeating is not as fun, and more window seating would appeal for another star.", "author": "Sasha S."}

Last night was one such night.\n\nWe had an hour to kill before seeing Inglorious Bastards at the Castro theater.  We had some dinner here.  2 rolls, 1 edamame, 1 sunomono and a large hot sake later, I was stuffed to the gills!  And it cost around $50 for the things listed above.  I was overstuffed but still malnourished.\n\nThink about this: the rolls here average $12.  It's 6 sloppy, messy, drippy pieces.  That's 2 dollars a piece.  For nigiri, it's not cheap either.  Hamachi was $5.50.  I attribute the high prices to the tony location and attempts at being posh.  It's not a reflection on the quality.  Recently, I've had some of the best sushi of my life.  That's because I grew something called standards.  Sure, they're not the highest, but they're higher than yours.  \n\nWhen I was young and naive, I was impressed by this place.

The fact that I can't remember means it was \"meh\" but not \"ugh!\"  I think I recall the CA roll being very mayonaisse-y.\nThe tempura, however, was not so good. At all. Thick, hard batter, too greasy, not salty enough, and overall lacked flavor. MInd you. I still ate it all, but that's because I always eat everything unless it' truly disgusting.\nBut I was very disappointed. The sauce stuff it came with was nothing more than soy sauce. I love Nara's accompanying tempura sauce- it's sweet and salty with a kick of something. But this? No. Pure liquid salt. It needed some sweet  to bring out some kind of flavor in the tempura, but no. While it's true the tempura lacked salt, the liquid salt sauce did not help.\nAll in all, a big, fat regret.  All that grease consumed for little enjoyment. Too bad.\nEven the tempura at Barracuda's all you can lunch is better.

Even though it was small sliver of fruit, it was...so exciting.\n\nI don't know how we finished two rolls and the Tropical Napoleon, but I loved it.\n\nDuring my second time with the BF, we ordered the Osaka Fantasy, a spicy special roll (which I don't remember the name of), and Yakiniku sizzling plate. The Osaka Fantasy was simply the sushi inards inside an egg crepe.  I appreciated the creativity, but it just simply tasted like sushi within an egg crepe.  I am not sure, but it could have been executed better for a better complexity of tastes.\n\nAnd I have to say, the spicy special roll was...so spicy.  I normally can't take too much spice but I usually try around the BF.  This time, I couldn't speak for nearly 5 minutes while I let the waves of \"heat\" rush through me.  But I was super glad that the BF loved the fact that he could taste the spiceness...although he didn't like the fact that I was so affected.

They actually did away with it for awhile but it was so popular they finally brought it back! \n\nVery comfortable and cozy, especially since the put the booths in.

Other than Ebisu (Inner Sunset), this place is serves some of the best sushi and sashimi dishes in the city (and you don't have to wait half-a-day to get seated).  \n\nThe size of the sushi and sashimi pieces are also very generous.  When I order sashimi at other places, I sometimes get these little slivers of fish that resembles carpaccio more than sashimi.  The rolls and specialties at Osaka are also very creative and they change daily.\n\nOther specialties that I would recommend are their Hamachi collar (the collar bone of the yellow tail tuna).  They bake it with a little lemon, salt and pepper.  You get a big piece for about $8.  It can be a dinner in itself with a bowl of rice.  To foodies, that's the best meat on the fish.  For those carbo-phobic, they have a great lobster roll appetizer.  It's lobster salad rolled in cucumber and served with orange fish eggs and a great dressing. \n\nThe reason I give it only 4 stars is because their service could improve.  It's not that they don't try, but rather, their wait staff seems to forget things a lot.  Every time I go, they will forget a dish or the check for example.  You may have to ask for things twice.  I have learned to order the appetizers and salads first and then dinner separately to get around this.  Other than that, the service is fine and the wait staff is very friendly.  The food come fast and you never have to wait for a seat there if you go before 7:00 for parties of 4 or less.  My motto is if the food is good enough, I will sacrifice some service.  Osaka's food is for me definitely in that category.\n\nIf you want to look at their website, it is:\n\nhttp://www.osakacastro.com/", "author": "Oliver S."}

I love it here, even if the sushi is not my favorite. I usually only eat nigiri but here I eat the rolls and that's because it's great to split them with Diane. If we go early we each get the bento box (cheap and good) and if we go at 4:30pm or later we do \"happy hour\" where they are practically giving the rolls away. It's, I don't know, $3.50 or something super inexpensive like that per roll. For early lunch we get out spending $12-$15 each and for happy hour we spend $8 - $10 each.

They've got a great lunch box deal for $9.50 that include miso soup, salad, rice, edamame, and 2 others entrees of your choice (off their selected list). Sometimes I splurge and go for one of their delicious special rolls which are huge and impossible to eat. Don't order this on a first date because it doesn't fit in your mouth in one piece, and well, I usually end making a mess of the beautiful roll. But oh so delicious.", "author": "Lindsay A."}

The wait staff are always incredibly nice and competent.  The food is always consistent and fresh.  And some of their special rolls are simply divine.  The Power of Love roll is just creative goodness - of course, not \"traditional Japanese sushi,\" but good food nonetheless.  It's right in the heart of the Castro and is open relatively late, so it's perfect for that pre- or post-going out meal.  Although it's a little pricey, if you mix special rolls with the regular menu, it comes out being reasonably priced.  Never had appetizers, beyond edemame and seaweed salad, though, so I can't speak to that.  Oh, and the hot sake is good.", "author": "Anya L."}

The portions here are decent for a Japanese restaurant, especially when it comes to the sushi. I had the tempura udon, which was very generous on the tempura side. The menu has a lot of great choices, but I was disappointed to see that a lot of things were only offered on the lunch menu. It's as if they post the lunch menu with the dinner menu just to torture me. I hate it when that happens.", "author": "Kristen R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-31", "description": "I've been here twice in the last month and both experiences were great. I think with Osaka it really depends on the day that you go in terms of fish freshness (can be a little inconsistent but so can most sushi places). They have a great happy hour special with different rolls, tempura and gyoza for half off. You also can get really cheap sake and beer specials. The second time was the charm: ordered the calamari (very small portion tho), dragon roll and the crazy roll. The dragon roll was the clear winner, the crazy roll was pretty bland and I could not distinguish between the three fish in it. The rolls are really good and the fish is usually fresh for the most part (the unagi can be a little mushy, but it is cooked so I'm not really surprised either). They also have daily specials of different fish from Hawaii and other parts of the world. It's not cheap, but if you're looking for something new to try it is worth it. The service was ok, I really think it depends on how many people are there...if it's busy the service gets scant (there's only two waitresses working there so what can you expect?).  The bento boxes are a good deal too!", "author": "Gina R."}

(He has never been) and he is craving sushi you end up asking someone from one of the stores \"Where do you go for Sushi?\" -- this is where you end up. My husband I eat Sushi all the time. We would probably eat it every day if we could. We wanted to go someplace nice since it was our only dinner in SF. We walked in and it was so crowded but we thought... a crowd says something about the place. We enjoyed it very much. It was great food. It was expensive to us (and we live in Washington DC... no cheap eats place) but it was a special occasion. We were not aware the portions where larger then usual so by the end we were stuffed. We really had a lovely time. The only complaint was the table next us. The guy sitting there was very loud and annoying. He went on and on about how hot he was (a model... for what? the before shots?). It is not Osaka's fault at ALL but we wanted to mention this as you are sitting very close to one another.", "author": "Jon R."}

I couldn't decide between the \"Chicken\" and \"Tofu\" Teriyaki, so i asked for the Chicken Teriyaki and asked if they could add in some Tofu [and i would pay extra of course]. Our waiter made this disgusting face and acted like I was requesting something that was way out of line. \"Tofu w/ Chicken Teriyaki!!\" he said? I explained they had both in the menu, and after being degraded enough by his comments and gross faces, i said \"Fine, I'll just have the chicken\". Needless to say, my chicken Teriyaki was completely burnt and not very good. It took us at least 20 min. just to get the check. I won't be coming back again.", "author": "Sandra D."}

I went with my friend on a Tuesday evening around 7ish and we were seated right away. There's not much leg room...the tables are very close together and I'm tiny. So watch out for that. There were a bunch of interesting looking sushis on the menu, all with tons of ingredients... I was having a hard time focusing and deciding what to get! J got 3 rolls and I forget their names. I had 2 rolls. One was really good with mango and the eel one had a funny aftertaste. Each roll is about $10-12ish, which isnt cheap, but not really totally expensive either. The tea was yummy. I would come back here again because from what I tasted of my good roll and j's rolls I tried, and even the one I didn't totally like but ate anyways, this is a pretty yummy sushi place.  I liked that it was quiet enough to hear ourselves talk, unlike the place down the street.

Very simply: food is average; prices are a tad high; sushi chefs are not friendly and do not talk to their customers, even when it is not busy at all. The service is, well, bad and inconsistent. An example: my partner ordered Iced Tea and we got them and drank them down before we got our meals, but they were never refilled and we had no liquids to drink throughout the meal. When I got the check and started to fill out the tip, the waitress interjected, \"do you want a refill?\"; I said no. It was too late for that. Another example, it took 15 minutes, after we got our menus, for our orders to be taken. Busy? No...there were only 2 other customers in the entire restaurant at the time. There is no excuse for bad service and unfriendly chefs.
