After a quick search on Yelp, I found that Dianda's was highly praised for their Tres Leches Cake. The cakes aren't fancy, they're old school, Aqua Net style but seem to be a crowd pleaser. \n\nCakes orders require a 3 days' notice but I called in 2 days prior and they accepted my order. So, if the cake order is simple, you may not have to call in 3 days in advance. A deposit is required for all orders.  \n\nI ordered a Mango Tres Leches Cake which was $37.75 and feeds 8-10 people: http://bit.ly/2mRQRLj. The 3 layers of leche: milk soaked sponge cake, custard, and whipped cream was rich and sweet but the mangos were slightly tart so everything kind of balanced out: http://bit.ly/2FUo5m3. \n\nNot really my style as the soaked sponge cake tastes just like it sounds, like a wet sponge but for those who like tres leches, I'm sure they'll feel differently. My co-workers said, they liked it (or maybe they didn't want to hurt my feelings).   \n\nFor cakes, my preferences are Fancy Wheat Field Bakery (San Bruno Avenue), Schubert's (Clement Street), Ambrosia Bakery (Ocean Avenue), and Tartine (Guerrero Street).\n\nThey spelled our intern's name wrong so I suggest asking them to repeat the spelling twice just to make extra sure. \n\nIf anyone has another recs from Dianda's, kindly send them along.

Last year their Almond raspberry torte was $14.25 today it was $19.25 a $5.00 hike in one year. The cakes they are known for, if not ordered in advance,  then you are out of luck. I mean these cakes were what put them on the map. \nA small cake 4-6 servings $55.00. If you don't order in advance,  they will pull out a frozen one if they have it ( make you feel like you should be grateful you're even getting one).

I love cake more than wine, whiskey, cheese, books, breakfast, a parking spot in SF, and the color pink. \n\nThat is a LOT of love! \n\nThe St Honore cake everyone raves about is good. The Italian cherries are lovely, the depth of chocolate is really nice, the boozy levels are too high for me. This is a difficult cake to make for the home baker when you take apart the individual technical merits/skill level you need coupled with the price of the quality ingredients this cake demands. Reminds me of making an Opera cake. Same demands on ones skill, time, and cost per slice. \n\nSOLUTION: BUY IT HERE!! My personal taste in no way reflects badly on the quality. It's definitely there. This is a stunner and others who like punchy obvious flavors in their mouth will love, no, worship this cake! \n\nBut for those of us with refined, discerning taste. Let me steer you to what is easily the most elegant non-European cake I have had the pleasure of eating more than one slice in a sitting.\n\nThe Banana Tres Leches cake. \n\nFresh bananas, wonderfully fluffy whipped cream, cake with a firm but tender crumb (to stand up to the soaking), and a base layer soaked in cream that isn't flimsy/doesn't fall apart. This cake is a visual and gastronomical delight!\n\nThe perfume of fresh bananas, the fatty cream and whipped cream, coupled with the texture of the cake make this the perfect choice for a special event (or if you are like me, a weekday) This doesn't keep so order a size that you will completely finish in a day.\n\nIf all that cake-loving talk wasn't enough praise, the cookies! I love Stella D'oro cookies from the market. I like the circles with pink or white frosting. Cheesy? Yes. Throwback to my childhood? You bet!\n\nThe same flavor can be found in the cookies here. Better quality cookie, more tender crumb, lovely Italian cherries, chocolate, and or nuts grace the individual varietals. Get a pound of cookies, brew some coffee, and take some time out of life to savor your alone time. \n\nI still grab a bag of Stella D'oro's when I see them but let's not tell lies here. That slide out box of store bought cookies pales in comparison to the freshly baked deliciousness the cookie case here boasts. \n\nI just love sweets. My gosh. \n\nI love this bakery. They completely justify my love for cake and everything that requires butter, flour sugar, eggs, leavening, and an oven. \n\nFive stars - well done!\n\nPS: You can phone same day to order a cake for pick-up.

So we got Mexican wedding cookies, almond coconut cookies, & the almond puff pastries that look like mini biscotti.  With one fedoretti.\n\nThe fedoretti...\nan almond pastry base topped w a chocolate rum cream & covered in chocolate.  It's wonderful.  We noshed it before we got to the car.\n\nOn the way out, I spotted the patty cakes & the strawberry rolls.  The patty cakes are chocolate cakes filled w whipped cream and covered in chocolate.  That just sounds amazing to me.  2 of my favorite things together in one heavenly piece of work.  The strawberry roll looks positively dreamy.  \n\nNext time.  \nIt's on.\n\nOver 50 years old & still a must do.\n\n5 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

One  is in the Mission District, San Francisco (the most popular) and secondly the other location is in San Mateo (which is where I live now).  I've got Yelper buddy Cheryl S to remind me just how AMAZING this bakery really is, as she took her very first visit there just recently and is HOOKED. That's what this place does to you!  It also brings back many childhood memories for me.  My Mom use to always make us tag along as she would go shopping for dinner parties (she was an excellent cook) I can remember she always ended the shopping extravaganza with a stop at Diandra's.They have a huge selection of pastries, cakes, and cookies.  I was also so very fortunate to receive a St Honore Birthday cake for EVERY birthday.  Boy was that a TREAT!\n\nTo this very day, I find myself at Diandra's. Instead of bringing a bottle of wine for a dinner welcome gift, I usually stop at Diandra's and pick up a box of cookies, which they sell by the half of pound. They are like gourmet cookies. They also sell Napoleons, which are my favorite,  tied with, of course, the St Honore Cake.  They also sell Cannoli's, slices of cakes, Tiramisu, cream puffs called \"the clam\", almond torte, and cream horns.  During Easter, they even sell the wonderful Hot Cross buns. If there's a word that could describe something much more than DECADENT and/or SCRUMPTIOUS, Please tell me.... Because that would describe Diandra's.  Forget Schubert's or Victoria Pastry....  Diandra's is truly a GEM!  \n\nYES they are expensive, the ladies behind the counter ROCK. But ohhhhhh... So worth it.\n\nTry it, you won't like it..... you'll absoultely LOVE it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-02", "description": "My family and I have been buying cakes and pastries here for probably over 30 years. We used to buy everything at their location on Green St in the North Beach and when they closed, we started buying at this location.\n\nUnfortunately, this 30 year tradition ends today. My mother called me last week to ask me what kind of cake I wanted for my birthday this year and I specifically asked for a chocolate cake with strawberries from Dianda's.\n\nMy mom placed the order on Thursday for pick up on Sunday. She arrived early in the morning only to find out that the cake was not there. Instead of expressing concern and trying to make this right, they all decide to interrogate my mother and treat her like she's an idiot. \n\nFirst they told her that someone already picked it up which was impossible because only 2 people knew that the cake was there, myself and my mom. Then they started interrogating her as if she was lying. They asked her how big the cake was, how many servings it was, how much it was and so on. I mean really? I understand asking what kind of cake but to ask her the rest of the questions was unacceptable. \n\nThen they accused her of placing the order at the San Mateo location. My mom told them repeatedly that she did not. They did not believe her and they called over there anyway and low and behold, no such order was placed there.\n\nThen it finally occurs to them to look at the receipts and it looks like they gave our cake to someone else by mistake. So after over 30 minutes of harassing my mom, they just grab another from the case, write on it and pack it. There was no apology or discount for loosing our cake.\n\nSo a few hours later, here we are getting ready to cut the cake and my mom makes a comment to me that the strawberries look really old and dry so I'm looking at it and I see that the strawberries are moldy. We then cut it open to see and the strawberries are equally as disgusting and they are brown and leaky. So we put all of it back into the box because the last thing I want to do is get sick and we go back to dianda's again. \n\nAlso, there is no way that they didn't see this. The baker actually took the cake to the back to write on so they were fully aware that the fruit was old and moldy but yet chose to still sell it to us.\n\nWhen we get there, my mom begins to talk to one of the ladies. She tells her about the rotten cake and another clerk chimes in and actually says to us that it is no moldy. My mom picks one of the strawberries up so they can take a closer look and one of them actually acknowledges that it is indeed moldy. So the clerk tells me she is going to get me another cake and I tell her that I don't want ANOTHER cake and that I just want a refund.\n\nAnother clerk chimes in and tells me that the manager is not in until tomorrow. I mean really!?! So you want us to come back a THIRD time? I live like 25 minutes away from here and tomorrow is Monday and people work. Also, it's not like I just didn't like the cake and want a refund even though they should refund your money or replace it under those circumstances too. The cake was rotten for God's sake! So that is when I started to talk and get really upset. \n\nI told them that this was unacceptable and that after they lost my cake, harassed my mom for over 30 minutes in the morning that their solution was to replace my lost cake with a rotten one. And that instead of being at home with my family celebrating my birthday, I'm here dealing with them.\n\nAll this time there was an older Italian lady with a really nasty attitude was just listening to what was going on even though I know she is affiliated with the owners and definitely had the authority to give me my money back. Because I was so upset, getting loud and customers were starting to listen, she finally stepped in and literally tossed the money at us and made a snarky remark that she gave us 25 cents more. WOW! 25 cents was totally worth TWO trips across the city, dealing with the difficult parking, having my mom treated poorly for 30 minutes, a lost cake, a rotten cake, ending up with NO birthday cake, having to get really upset before getting a refund, having the money tossed at me like we were a piece of garbage AND me having to take 1.5 hours out of my birthday to deal with this. Thank you so much for your generosity. I don't know what I would do without that extra 25 whole cents. What a bitch!\n\nAfter 30 years of buying a ton of cakes, after recommending them to all my friends and family all of these years and being one of their biggest supporters, it's a shame that it had to end this way. I will never ever step foot in this place again and I have already begun reaching out to my network to tell them what happened to us and that I don't want them buying me and surprising me with anymore cakes from here.\n\nLuckily, I live in SF where bakeries are a dime a dozen.

There were lots of Italian and Greek bakeries and restaurants all around Ditmars Boulevard, as there still are today. Yum!\n\nDianda's in the heart of The SF Mission brings me back to the Italian neighborhoods of NYC, where you might need to count \"Frankie's\" on a typical \"block\" with two hands and not one. You know what I mean?  Dianda's bakery has stood that test of time, having been in business over 50 years. It's a fast moving, all bakery, kind of place.  Don't expect a Vienna style bakery and wait service or restaurant. Wait in line, get your stuff to take it home or to the park.\n\nHow are the baked goods, you ask?\n\nVery nice, and the best part for me was the large selection of cookies. Cookies, cookies everywhere. The recipe's are good, and the unique flavors of say Anise Biscotti, will make you want to brew up the classic Italian Roast again and again. In fact most of these cookies are perfect coffee cookies. \n\nDianda's is especially a place to search out around the holidays, as we did for our Christmas dinner. Make sure you get two things, one for immediate satisfaction, and the second thing to make sure your holiday feast ends with a special flair. Then get on the treadmill later on.", "author": "Frank O."}

Some Yelpers call this item a custard puff but it's really more of a giant pastry clam with lots of custard in it.  Sadly, it's not as good as it used to be.  There were half as much custard and the custard itself was not creamy but more like overcooked cream (too dense and sweet).  I think they cooked the custard too long because that is how custard tastes when you cook it and condense it too long.  The shell or clam pastry didn't have that nice crispy sugar coating it used to, it was slightly soggy and doughy.  My memories of this perfect pastry has died.  I think it's because over the years, they have different bakers and this baker just isn't very good.\n\nThe original rum cake is pretty because the strawberry red color is the actual rum and it has custard in it.   Hubby thought it was good but messy to eat since the cake is topped with a hard pasty shell that shatters.  We also had the Napoleon which is layers of light crispy pastry with custard in between.  Sadly, the Italian Napoleon doesn't taste half as good as a Chinese Napoleon.  If you go to a good Chinese bakery in Chinatown, try their Napoleon because there are nuts in it and special sweet crispy layers that reminds you of a candy bar inside.  Hubby liked the Napoleon the best but that's because he hasn't tried the Chinese version yet.  \n\nDon't let the size fool you, these pastries are huge but they are super light and not very sweet so you can inhale them.  Unfortunately,  I found all of the pastries sitting out on the counter a little too long, it didn't taste fresh enough.\n\nI got my parents a slice of mixed fruit cake and yes, they did like it.  The pastries are all very pretty here so if you want to impress someone, buy a few pastries and get a box which is complimentary.  My four pastries came to 16 dollars but they do take credit card.", "author": "Lorissa W."}

No candied orange or lemon peel on top, but the more common cherry kind with the classic dusting of confectioners sugar. Each one about $3.95. \n\nHowever, the service here is dreadful, while a wait occurs even if there's no one else in the bakery. Some serious 'tude is common with the servers.  \n\nOn a side note, I took these cannolis to Philz down the street & had them with my coffee.

But sometimes the attitude of the service can be a turn off for me.\n\nAbout the St. Honore Cake: in my opinion Victoria Pastry Co. makes a more \"elegant\" (clean defined layers and less whipped cream) version which some older customers prefer, while Dianda's version looks more traditional.

This classic french dessert is a circle of puff pastry at its base with a ring of p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux piped on the outer edge. After the base is baked small cream puffs are dipped in caramelized sugar and attached side by side on top of the circle of the p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux.

Why at an Italian bakery in the Mission of course!

I wasn't expecting to find an italian bakery in the middle of mission but its convienently located right off the 24th st bart so its easy to get to. \n\nits a pretty nice sized store with a variety of different cookies, pastries, and also pies. I got a slice of  napolean, tiramisu, rum cake, and their popular canoli. the lady helping me was very nice and patient providing some advice as well. I didn't try all the dessert but I did have a sliver of the tiramisu and it was really good. the cake wasn't super soggy and nice balance of coffee. the rest of the desserts lasted until dinner as well and everyone said thye were really good. the pastry was flaky and very flavorful. the rum cake was rather strong too.\n\nAlso they take CC and if you call, they will put aside pieces for you! oh and for your price you pay, you get a nice big slice or portion.", "author": "Tao Tao W."}

A line out the door tells the story right away!  You know when you see a line out the door of any store or restaurant in San Francisco, the place has got it going on, because San Franciscans know what's good.  It was $144.50, by the way, so not a Safeway cake.  But you get what you pay for - and SO much more.  You want a cake people talk about, this is the one.

He said he would decorate a strawberry cake with fruit n cream. He did it and it came out cute!!\n\nThen he said it would be $45 because they had to charge for the decorating and the cake. I guess I should have asked first because I really think that's excessive for an 8 inch cake with a flag design of one row raspberries and the next a line of whipped cream?

It's the perfect excuse to take home a bunch of sweet goods without feeling too guilty. Not only does it go through the test of time, but my resistance of eating them all up before the week even ends. I think they're pretty good measurements of how much I like them.\n\nAnyway, I came here yesterday to stock up for the week and I'm sad to say my pastries took a beating before they even got home. The mushroom pastry was my favorite. It was drizzled in honey that hardened over, which gave it a nice crunch at times. The apple pastry was alright. The pastry part was nice and flaky, but the apple was a bit underbaked and perhaps an extra bit of cinnamon would've been nice too. The apricot tart was good. It was sweet and apricoty, but the glaze was too thick for me. I felt like half the topping was the glaze and not the fruit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-07", "description": "This marks the second time where I brought a Saint Honore Cake ($58) to the Private UYE I usually put together with my friends on Yelp. Tom R was the first person to tell me about this French cake, the best way to describe it would be a hybrid between an \u00e9clair and cream puff as the rim of the cake is stacked with cream puffs that are infused with rich custard and drizzled with thin caramel to couple with a crunchy sticky layer of brown sugar at the bottom with a taste of rum. Decorated with green, red and white-colored whipped cream and cherries, this particular cake has medicinal value as it is the #1 cure for those who couldn't stop eating Beard Papa. Although more lab test is required, my sample trial with one of the LA Yelpers who should remain unidentified certainly proved this to be true. The complexity of its taste and texture will take you far beyond the limits of a cream puff, and just when you find yourself arriving, it takes you further into an uncharted sweet spot with a rum chocolaty finish. \n\nToo bad I haven't been able to find the equivalent of Dianda's closer to home but it's a festive and ultra delicious cake that I recommend for all occasions. It was so nicely presented that it took a good 15 minutes of photo shoot before the group finally looked at each other to volunteer a person to cut it. This time the cake had a heavier rum finish but no one complained. It fed 23 people with plenty of leftovers and it complemented perfectly with the super juicy Brentwood cherries that Jonathan W brought to share with us. I suspect the recently cured Beard Papa fan had more than one slice so I later brought the person to Dianda's so she/he can thank the pastry chef in person. On the day of the event it took them a while to find my cake, but otherwise service was friendly and down to earth. Aside from the Saint Honore Cake, I also highly recommend their Almond Cookies and the innocent looking \"Mushroom\". I will definitely be back.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Which is why I was surprised that we got a sub-par birthday cake with banana filling for my mom's birthday (filling, topping ok, and the actual cake was dry beyond anyone's comprehension). Since this was the first time we though it was a fluke, we probably  got the baker in a bad mood and did not put the same level of attention when he was making it (this was back in June).\n\nWe order another cake for our twins B-day (raspberry filling with light frosting to balance the sweetness of it). Everything was great until we had a piece of the cake, same as in June the damn bread (cake) was dry. The cake was $60.00, I was expecting the bread to be moist, not drier than the Sahara desert (it had that sandy feeling since it was dry).\n\nIt makes me wonder if they still have the same people from 5 years ago baking the pastries and cakes. Because when it comes to the cake bread it is a huge disappointment. I cannot believe that I would rather have a Safeway generic piece of crap B-day cake over the ones they make in Dianda's (yes it was that bad except from the frosting and filling).\n\nThe three stars are for service counter people, who will do their best to meet your expectations, and the filling/frosting of the cake. They have lost my business for sure, as a long time customer I am extremely saddened that the quality of the cakes have fallen, not to mention the price they charge because it was amateur at best.", "author": "Daniel A."}

My wait time was less than 20 minutes, \n\nPEOPLE: IF YOU ARE IN THE MISSION DISTRICT AREA AND WANT GOOD PASTRY, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!", "author": "Pam N."}

I asked them to make slightly different design but that did not go very well and they were nice enough to offer to make another one (good thing I ordered it a day early..). Next day I got up at 7 am to go to the bakery as that is when the decorators are working, to tell them exact what I wanted.. To make things simple, I print a photo of a cake that would give a good guidance and left it with them in the morning. When I picked up the cake I did not know what to say... The top had to have a hard caramel decoration on it but the caramel was not cooked long enough and had a light yellow color.. It literally looked like dog peed on it.. When my husband came home and saw the cake he stayed silent for a moment and then said,  is there another place we can go and buy another cake right now?.. That will give you an idea of the esthetics of it. We actually bought another cake.  Later, after I made some of my own caramel decorations the cake looked more reasonable and we took both of them to the party but I have to say, I will not be back to the bakery. There are so many amazing bakeries in the city and this bakery needs to update the looks of their baked goods. They cakes look a bit too outdated and mass produced.  The flavor was good, but not great. \nI would recommend trying Ambrosia Bakery, Tartine, B.Patisserie. We really do have some amazing choices in the city.", "author": "Ausra S."}

I called them up a day before I needed the tres leches, and a lady took the order for about 30+ peeps and patiently transcribed all of the details I requested.  I didn't realize it was an Italian bakery until I walked inside its heavenly premise full of sweet thangs, cakes, red velvet and more!\n\nI was a lil confused because I heard the owner speaking in Italian and then the workers in Spanish (the same thing actually happened 3 days ago when I started sprinkling random Italian words in a conversation with a Costa Rican waiter (we were at a pizzeria in Manuel Antonio) who replied in Spanish and then went off in Italian hah) but it didn't really matter!  I didn't want a repeat of that funny yet embarrassing situation so I stuck with using the universal English in picking up the lovely cake.  Appearance wise, the tres leches with fresas looked aite, but when we all took a taste, it was really yummy.  \n\nDianda's got the tres leches goin on!  Check it.", "author": "Megha S."}

The almond cookie with pine nuts was particularly good - the texture was perfectly chewy and not too dry. It's far too hard to describe every single cookie, but I'll say this - there was not one that I didn't like, which will clearly make it impossible to get less than say, 20+ the next time I go back.\n\nTheir service was a little...unapproachable I guess is a good word. But really, if they boxed up those cookies while screaming at me the entire time, I would still give it 5 stars because the food was just that good.

TWO DELICIOUS DIANDA'S CAKES FOR MY BIRTHDAY!  \n\nOne birthday cake crafted entirely out of cream puffs.  Another made of luscious dark chocolate frosting and chocolate cake.  \n\nMy childhood dream comes true.\n\nMy bestie didn't know this when she ordered me these cakes for my surprise birthday party today at Dolores Park; but ever since I was a little girl, I have always wanted two cakes for my birthday.  One chocolate one and one non-chocolate one.  But does the youngest child in a family of 14 kids get TWO CAKES for her birthday?  Nooooo, she gets one cake, like everybody else, that is barely enough to feed everyone because older brothers eat EVERYTHING.  They're like always hungry.  Actually, I'm surprised the adults didn't just save the cake from the kid who had the birthday right before me and re-serve it on my birthday.\n\nSo today, when my hunny brought out my birthday cakes, I looked at them and looked at them and couldn't believe my eyes!  Not only did I get my TWO CAKES, but they were some of the most scrumptious looking cakes I'd ever seen.  A birthday cake made out of cream puffs?  I hadn't even dreamed up that one!  Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  But before I could finish admiring my lovely cakes, my TWO lovely cakes, people were sticking their dirty hands into the boxes and peeling away chunks of cream puffs from my cake.  And by \"people,\" I mean Aaron, my dear friend who drove up from L.A. to \"celebrate my birthday with me.\"  And by \"celebrate my birthday with me,\" I actually mean \"using his dirty hands to steal big chunks off my birthday cake.\"  Later on, I tried to squish an entire Diandia's cream puff into my mouth and ended up squishing all of the cream out of it and onto my face, hands and hair.  Very tasty.\n\nMoral of the story?  Everyone should get two cakes for their birthday.  Delicious ones.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: 06/04/2007\n\nThe chocolate cake has been in our fridge for almost 2 weeks.

Well it is a double ring of choux puffs (about 3 dozen plus puffs) filled with pastry cream and attached to each other with caramel and with a center filled with a Chiboust cream which is a pastry cream lightened with a meringue. This is very rich desert that stands out and and a single cake can provide many satisfying servings to a large group (Toro E. has attached a photo of the cake).\n\nBecause the St. Honor\u00e9 Cakes sell so well I suggested you reserve one.

I've been to other ones in SF and none can compare--I don't think Victoria even comes close (too sweet for my taste). Dianda's seems to really hit home when it comes to taste--desserts are meant to have a complexity of flavors and not just be sugary sweet with a lot of fluff. \n\nDianda's pastries in addition to the cakes are also pretty fabulous and you don't feel heavy as a boulder, on the contrary, the consistency of many of their creations are light as feather confections (custard cups with Chantilly cream or eclair with custard filling). Yes, the actual store may not be up to par with the \"look\" of an upscale bakery but that's what I love about this place.

The finishing touch is a generous drizzle of sugar syrup all over.  Hoooow can you resist it?  After your filling burrito at La Taqueria, dare to be dangerously stuffed...go next door and get a treat.  You deserve it, don't you?", "author": "Kristina R."}

It was a last minute thing and not very well thought out on my part, but they literally and figuretively catered to my request.

I've tried every kind of pastry ever sold here and I love them all even the sugar free cookies :) My favs though are the chocolate rum cake and the cream puff cake which I call bolitas cake :) (small balls cake)\n\nmmmm can i also recommend the candies they sell here, just yum yum.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-11-08", "description": "Oh thank god I read some recent reviews that agreed with my thoughts on this bakery, i thought i had lost my taste bud for a second there.  I have no idea why this place have 4 1/2 stars, while other more superior bakeries that uses all natural and organic ingredients have 4 or 3 1/2 stars.  I had a slice of the rum cake which was raved about and the black forest.  So with the black forest the center was filled w/some processed jelly that they also use on their pies and canned cherries, the cake itself was dry and the whipped cream was fake and not made from real cream.  The rum cake was made with the same fake whipped cream also and what tasted like those custard powder that you mix w/water to get instant custard, the cake part itself was ok.  I had really expected more from this bakery w/the 4 1/2 stars they were given, and was sadly dissapointed.  I didn't try anything else, but I don't expect the quality of the product to be any better.  I did weigh the fact that their cake slices were $3.75 and maybe i shouldn't be expecting too much, but still w/a 4 1/2 star I expected a bit more, oh heck.... a lot more.  I hope w/all the customers they are getting that they are making enough profit to go towards using more natural, fresh ingredients and start making their stuff from scratch rather then relying on canned and processed ingredients.  For those of you who love this place, more power to you, I hope you give them continued success and they give you the \"yummy\" cake you so love and at some point in the future they will reward you w/high quality ingredients and even yummier cakes.", "author": "joshua g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-29", "description": "Being a Dianda, I was enjoying my grandfather's pastries in the womb as was another reviewer and to this day I still pick up an almond torte, cannolli, chocolate mushroom and my favorite pastry is one my grandfather invented called the federetti. Its an amaretto cookie with chocolate mouse covered in dark chocolate.\nI've been eating Dianda's pastries for 44 years + 9 months in the womb and they taste exactly the same as when I was a child. Dianda's does not make Italian breads except for panettoni and Dianda's panettoni is much better than most of the imported brands.  I don't particularly have a taste for panettoni but some people like this sort of sweet bread with candied fruit and they swear by it. I prefer the brioche like my grandmother did which resembles a croissant and tastes like panettoni but without candied fruit.\nMy father still works at the bakery (its been 43 years now) and true the new owners are hispanic as most have been working at Dianda's for 10+ years and it was a practical decision when my uncles wanted to retire that the brothers sell the bakery to people who had been working side by side with my Father and Uncles and knew the family recipies inside out.\nSince the ownership change Dianda's is busier than ever and yes on holidays there are large lines around the corner. How many other bakeries in the City are open to accommodate their customers on holidays serving fresh cakes made overnight by bakers who just pulled a 12-24 hour shift?\nIts heartwarming to hear that most people appreciate the legacy started by my grandfather and carried on through my father and my uncles to the current owners.

There were so many little treats, cookies, pastries etc. etc. Although I usually just opt for the cheesecake (no matter where I go), I thought that maybe this place didn't have it. So I was eying the almond tart and the sugar free cookies (cause I still have the coughs). But when the crowd dispatched, there it was. CHEESECAKE! I bought a slice of that as well as a slice of chocolate mousse cake. The chocolate mousse was good, but I still can't find appreciation in mousse cakes, therefore I don't think I'll go for it again. I skipped most of the creme on top. But the bottom (chocolate cake) was quite good, and I ate it all (compared to the graham bottoms on cheesecake). The cheesecake was very good. It was just the right amount of thickness (although I still wouldn't mind it being thicker) and wasn't too sweet. My friend has never been a fan, and even he said it was quite good. At $3.50 a piece, its not bad. The rating lands at 3.5 stars, but because of the unhelpful and somewhat ehhh customer service the girl gave me, you land at a 3.", "author": "Elaine H."}

But they have so much more to offer I discovered...  \n\nTheir divine almond cake is perfect with a cup of coffee and tastes good even a week later.  I now bring it home to the 'rents b/c they don't have anything like it East.  And when dinner parties come up it's easy to transport and more unique than a bottle of wine.  Their St. Honore cake with the crispy cream-filled puffs  makes a great alternative to ho-hum birthday cake.  And when I'm jonesin' for a some panettone and its not christmas or easter, they have it.  Now that it's Easter week they have the best hot cross buns I've ever had (not that I'm an expert, but they are more bun than bread like some I've had with bits of fruit inside (raisins and citron I think) and the cross on top is not regular sugar icing but something custardy.  Wow. Go get 'em while they last.  \nThey even make the special pastries for St. Joseph's day that look like a donut hole but are filled with pastry cream.
