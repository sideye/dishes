The decor will immediately catch your eye with several comfy couches, eclectic light fixtures, and unique art. It's cozy and eccentric, like your crazy great-aunt's place. \n\nThe cocktails are delicious, and I especially liked the Sky Juice - gin, cacha\u00e7a, coconut cream, falernum, basil, lime, orange. If you're with a small group or going solo, sit at the bar and chat up the bartenders. They may let you taste drinks that could be on future menus. \n\nIt's a bar so the cocktails better be good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also stellar! We had the Deviled Eggs and Kale Salad - all classically good. But the real stand-out was The Burger. They only make 13 per day so make sure you order as soon as you arrive.", "author": "Dyanna Q."}

I guess the party didn't start until 6:30pm, but we arrived early on Friday, December 15th around 5:45pm. It turned out they reserved a table in the back, but since we didn't know, we started off at the table in the front by the bar.\n\n*DRUNKEN SAILOR: coconut-infused bourbon, white rum, grapefruit, falernum, cinnamon syrup, lemon ($11)\n*MANHATTAN: rye, carpano antica, bitters, orange ($11)\n*PORK BELLY SLIDERS: rock shrimp, house made kimchi, scallions, gochujang ($9)\n\nWe began with the above for the 30 or so mins we were here by ourselves. I got the Manhattan. It was nicely balanced. I wasn't trying to drink too much at first since our holiday party was the night before, so this was a good sipping cocktail. We decided to get the sliders to split. They were a nice snack to start the evening.\n\n*GRANDAD'S SPECIAL: rye, oloroso sherry, coffee, salted cacao, chili, bitters ($12)\n*PUNCH #3: rye, lemon, spice, sherry, ginger ($50)\n*BAR NUTS: warm mixed nuts with a blend of spices ($7)\n*POPCORN: with savory furikake ($5)\n\nOnce everyone started arriving, the going away girl ordered a punch bowl and snacks for the table. I believe we ended up with two punch bowls at the end of the night. The punch was good. Very drinkable and not too sweet. I ended up getting two more cocktails on top of the punch bowl. I believe both were the grandad's special. It was dark and spirit forward like I prefer, but there was something very cozy and maybe even a little christmas-y about the drink. I can't recall why, but I remember enjoying it. I only tried the popcorn which was good for munching on as the night progressed.\n\nFun night at Evil Eye. I was here for almost 5 hours before I left for a late dinner. Great spot for ccocktails and small bites.", "author": "Elena N."}

During the week probably around 8-ish there were plenty of seating options and all were comfy AF and conducive to intimate conversations.\n\nHead up to the bar for a gander at their menu. They have at least one staff member who goes around and clears empty glasses off the tables but to order and all that you have to go to the bar. The bartenders were soooo nice and unlike so many other Bay Area places, still made an effort to make eye contact with people waiting to order or close out, even when they were busy, and went that extra step to ask how they can help you and let you know they'll be with you in a minute. It almost brought a tear to my eye to receive this sort of dutiful Midwestern service again. It's been a while since that's happened and I wish other Bay Area restaurants and bars would take note. \n\nI got the Desert Rose, which was just my style - boozy without tasting like it with an mildly oversized leafy garnish.

It's kind of like a dive bar, but they have an extensive cocktail menu. They have some pretty interesting drinks!

He did tell the bartenders that he only wanted one, so I thought they shouldn't have made him pay for both. Unfortunately, he did not enjoy the drinks at all, and he actually found a piece of egg shell inside one of them (egg white was an ingredient in the drink). \nAnother thing was the location of the pool table.. It was so close to where people walk through from the bar, and it's common that the players would hit people on accident with their sticks.\nWe didn't have a very fun time here, but it's worth it to check out.

The phrase: Evil Eye gives me the heebie jeebies because my mom always gave me the evil eye for no reason at all. Her evil eye was so strong, I could feel it penetrate through her bug eye shades and Darth Vader visor as she rolled through in her little Corolla. \n\nI read the owners named their bar Evil Eye as a sign of good luck and the pictures of the retro-funk vibe with lots of plushy sofas really drew me in. It looked like a great place to chill over some cocktails and bar bites so my friend and I met up for happy hour during their opening week (several weeks ago). \n\nI found parking early so decided to wait inside for my friend. Upon arrival, I got the once over look by the bartender which was a bit unwelcoming. We decided to sit in the lounge area where the female server was much nicer. \n\nEvil Eye has a good variety of cocktails on their menu (18 kinds) ranging from $9-$12 but since we planned on being there for a while, we ordered one of their punch bowls. We ordered the Punch Bowl #1: Gin, cucumber, lime, absinthe ($50 + $10 upgrade to Hendrick's). I've ordered punch bowls before at other bars but this one looked very empty and was mainly ice: http://bit.ly/28LreWV. It was potent but this would be gone after one round with a larger group (my gf and I killed it and we both were able to drive home).  \n\nOn the food menu, they have snacks like popcorn and charcuterie ($5-$17), toasts ($10-$11), and small plates like salads, chicken wings, sliders ($8-$12).\n\nWe shared the following:\n*Furikake Popcorn ($5): http://bit.ly/28KMTvX\nCould use more furikake seasoning and the portion was quite small for the price. \n\n*Fried Green Tomatoes w/ burrata, confit cherry tomato, balsamic, basil ($11): http://bit.ly/28K5edF\nSkip; the burrata was fine but the batter on the tomatoes was terribly hard and lukewarm.\n\n*Brokaw Avocado Toast w/ charred corn, cherry tomato, queso fresco ($11): http://bit.ly/28Ls462\nLoved the creamy avocado and sweet and smoky corn but it was very messy to eat (corn and queso toppled off with each bite). Could of used some freshly cracked pepper or red pepper flakes to add some dimension. I don't mind paying for good food but this piece of toast seems overpriced by $2-$3. \n\n*Vietnamese Chicken Wings w/ savory caramel, cilantro, lime, peanuts (6 pc. - $9): http://bit.ly/28MPE2s\nEnjoyably crisp and tender with a nice salty sweetness from the fish sauce. \n\nFemale server was nice and attentive and was good about refilling our water glasses. The owner (?) came by to check in with us which I thought was nice since it seemed that we were one of the few customers that weren't friends of the owners that night. \n\nLoved the retro funky vibe with vintage furniture and lots of plushy couches. There's also a pool table, pinball machines, and one flat screen tv for watching the game. Such a transformation from the stark space and the awful pepto-bismol walls that previously housed Coco Frio. \n\nNot sure if I would return to Evil Eye as I read several disconcerting reviews where SF natives weren't treated well by the bartender. I was born and raised in SF and I'm all for gentrification (to an extent) but when you start alienating SF natives (specifically from The Mission where your business is located in)...not cool.

A+!\n\nHowever, we recently went here for dinner and the service really, really sucked. \n\nThe interior is cute and comfortable, the cocktail menu has a range of delicious and creative drinks. (The best Pimm's cup I've had in America so far, actually) We ordered about half the menu and everything was amazing. The brussel sprouts particularly were really tasty. \n\nI've been here a couple times for drinks, and the food menu caught my eye so we went back to get dinner. It was really early on a Saturday night. There was a server on, and we grabbed a table. There were two other tables seated.\n\nWhen she didn't bring us menus, we started watching her to see if there was in fact table service. The server (Rachel?) was waiting on other tables so we waited... and waited... and eventually grabbed a menu from the bar so that we'd be ready to order when she wasn't busy. I've been a server for years, so I know how it can be when you're trying to fire orders and have a table staring you down, we were being patient. \n\nAfter 20 minutes, it is clear that she's not serving us. She's hanging out at the server station chatting with the bar staff and drinking a beer. I assumed we had made a mistake and needed to order from the bar because she hadn't so much as greeted us at this point. The bartender informs me that no, the server should be taking our order. I look back and she's waiting on a the table next to us that just sat down. \n\nMy friend flags her down as she's waiting on this table, and she finally approaches us. I had made eye contact with her several times while we were waiting, so it seems impossible that she didn't see us... but clearly it's just a miscommunication, right? She didn't apologise for ignoring us in her section for 20 full minutes. I thought that was kind of rude, but, whatever. Let it go.\n\nWell, the table next to us gets their drinks and their food almost instantly. Had it been my table, I probably would have fired our food first since we'd obviously been waiting. They even ordered some of the same apps as us so I thought it was really weird that theirs came out first instead of at the same time, but whatever. I don't know their kitchen's flow. That's usually not the server's fault, ok. \n\nHowever, our entire meal finally came out within about half an hour. (We ordered 5-6 things that came out one at a time) and we still didn't have our drinks. She'd made several trips to our table at this point, and didn't say anything about our cocktails. Given the previous impression she'd made, I thought perhaps our server had forgotten to put them in. It happens to every server from time to time, especially if you're putting in orders for multiple tables at once. I asked (politely) if our drinks would be out soon. (Again, remember it had been about half an hour since we ordered) and our server snidely give me some spiel about how each drink is handmade and about 20 people had put their order in at the same time. Firstly, there's fewer than 30 people in the bar right now. You're really trying to tell me that they all put in their drink orders at the same time? Secondly, if that's the case, why did the table whose order you took 30 seconds before ours just get their SECOND ROUND of drinks? She could have just said, \"Sorry about the wait, your drinks will be right out\" but instead talked down to me about it. She continued to talk to me (specifically) in this weird passive aggressive patronising voice for the rest of our meal, it was palpably uncomfortable. When we asked for the bill, she ran my card before bringing it to review as well, which was annoying as we had intended to split it. I'm not sure what this particular server's attitude problem is, but she couldn't have been more condescending and rude unless she had called me a b***h right to my face. \n\nAgain, I've been a server for years in a lot of different types of venues from big nightclubs to tiny intimate bistros. I'm not easily shaken up about stuff like this. But I have never, ever, in my life had service that made me feel this uncomfortable and ruined my experience at a place this badly. \n\nI'd recommend that the management train their staff and keep a closer eye on them. It also concerns me that your staff is drinking on shift at 5:30. I find rude staff and drinking on shift go hand in hand in my experience...\n\nThe cocktails and food are fantastic and every other time we've been here has been a great experience. So, I'd like to come back, but if that server's working, I'll probably take a pass.", "author": "Sarah N."}

At this point the drink was absolutely unpalatable - so I told him I'd like a new one. He said you shouldn't waste drinks and threw the concoction he made down the drain. He then REFUSED to make me the new cocktail I wanted because \"I wouldn't like it cause I don't like sour things\" then made me a truly crappy and sweet new drink and charged me again.

My friends and I went the second week it opened and were one of the first groups to get there after work. We were all pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and cozy the space was. It really does feel like someone's living room, in the best way possible! They also have a few pinball machines for those looking for added entertainment. I really liked the mismatched vibe of the couches and tables - it didn't look disorderly, just homey. The evil eye theme is prominent but not overly done or in your face. The glassware is also mismatched and gorgeous. \n\nWe were able to snag a booth in the back that was big enough for the 6 of us. At one point, one of the owners came to our table to chat and see how things were going, and she was very personable and excited. Over the course of the evening, we ordered savory furikake popcorn and the deviled eggs, which were both great sharable snacks. For drinks, I tried the Cobra's Negroni, the Old Fashioned, and the Smoked Paloma. All of the drinks were very well made! The only issue we had the entire night was at one point, they got super backed up at the bar and our ticket got lost. It just so happened that 20ish minutes after we had placed that order, the owner had come up to chat and we mentioned that our drinks hadn't arrived. She quickly went to check on our drinks (ticket got lost) and was very apologetic. Otherwise, we had a really fun night and I look forward to going back!", "author": "Regina L."}

It wasn't that busy when I went on a Saturday night--I guess because it's so new and somewhat far down on Mission St. I like the setup of their place with various types of seating like bar stools, round booths, and couches/coffee tables that accommodate different party sizes. They sell delicious bowls of alcohol to share and tasty bar food. You could also get some ice cream (they had Secret Breakfast flavor from Humphry Slocombe the time I was there).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "Stopped in on a Saturday night after dinner, knowing this place was new and hoping it wouldn't be too crowded. Thankfully for us (though perhaps not for the owners) it had people, but there were plenty of open seats. \n\nOur group of four took a booth in the back, where the stage used to be when it was the Savannah Lounge. They've cleaned up the space a bit (not nearly as dusty as it was before, and some new lacquer) but kept the bar in the same spot. I've always thought it was weird that the space is narrow in the front and open in the back.\n\nOur server was attentive and helpful when we asked about one of the punches, and the bowl was perfect for our group of 4. It wasn't cheap at $50, but for four drinks and potentially multiple rounds, we probably would have paid a bit more otherwise. We also picked up some of the furikake popcorn, which was the only reasonably-priced snack on the menu. \n\nThe menu looked tasty, but it was pricey for a dark bar atmosphere where not all the seating is at proper tables. Hopefully they can find a happy medium between covering their costs and attracting customers soon.\n\nUPDATE: last Friday it seemed things were fully buzzing. We had to hover for one of the tables to clear out so we could sit. Now the pool table is in the way and a poor use of space considering how many drinkers could sit there-- nice for when it's not crowded, but annoying when it is :)", "author": "Krista L."}

My friends and I had just ordered a punch bowl and several goodies from the bar from the \"blonde bar tender\" who seemed friendly enough had only passed out a mugs worth of punch when the 2nd bar tender \"the brunette\" (who thought she was living in that 70s show) came up to our table of 7 and snapped at me and my friends in a very loud and very aggressive tone saying \"WAS THERE AN ISSUE CAUSE YOU DIDN'T TIP SO IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM I'll NEED TO KNOW\" we all looked at each other confused af because we weren't done ordering. A receipt was given because we had ordered food but planned on staying for a while (at this point based off what we ordered the bar tender who actually served us was looking at a 25 plus tip). I AM A BAR TENDER and I have never experienced this type of behavior from a bar tender I've worked with or been served by in my 6 year of going to/working at bars. It got outrageous. Responded with a very confused \"we thought we'd trip cash when we were finished (like at every other bar ever.)\" she glared at all of us and no joke hair flipped away then immediately went to go talk shit and giving play by play to the \"blonde bartender\" the two laughed like middle school mean girls and this continued the rest of the time we were there. Two more friends of mine showed up for my birthday and out of the total 11 people in the bar (9 of them in my group) it took over 5 minutes to even get a bar tender to say anything. Both saw us and said something to each other about us waiting AND POINTED like they couldn't be more obvious or childish. Nor were they getting any kind of tip at this rate, nice way to screw over your friend/place of employment because we will not go back here unless it's to speak to the manager/owner about this particular set of women because they really made a tremendous effort at ruining my birthday night. But bitches don't get me down. The food arrived and was passively aggressively thrown on our table, surprised any of it showed up at all. Our stools were taken away from our seating area to place that no one was using, like I said we are pretty much the only people in the entire bar. And the only burger we ordered came out burnt. Since I'm a bartender and a nice person I decided to tip the \"blonde bartender\" since she was somewhat helpful and did her job to some extent. I said to her \"i'd like to personally give you this tip and only you because I'm pretty sure you know your friend over there hasn't been very nice to us since we got here\". She giggled. \"OK well I hope you have a wonderful evening and I'll be writing just as wonderful of a review about both of you on yelp. Appreciate it the great service.\" Finally after all the shit talking and dirty looks we got we were leaving for a much more relaxing and friendly environment and this bitch had the fucking nerve to clap us out of the fucking bar. Yes, I said clap us out. I turned around and I was like \"hi excuse me if you have something to actually say now is the time\" this scared little Bitch hid behind her bar and wouldn't even look at me after pushing me and my friends the entire time. I told her to go fuck her self and I fucking mean it. I have worked in customer service since 2009 and that shit was unacceptable. Maybe this was her way of adding to the \"Evil Eye\" environment but it came off as just trashy. I will be calling to further this because I was looking forward to this experience and now I'd like to ruin its reputation.", "author": "Ashley S."}

The Latino bartender began serving us, when suddenly, the male owner Matt came by and asked if we needed anything else. I asked for more water, as he quickly directed me to help myself at their water station located at the end of the bar. I informed the owner that the other bartender had just given me water where I was sitting. He then responded rudely by informing me he was not going to treat me any different from any other customers and again directed me to the water station. I told him it's fine, I would help myself. As he walked away, I turned to my friend sitting next to me and said, \"why does he have to be an asshole about it?\" I quickly looked over and noticed he was nearby and overheard what I said. I looked at him and said, \"You heard me?\" He nodded his head, \"yes.\" I responded, \"I get it, you have your own protocol and all and that's fine, but I did feel you were very rude about it.\" He began repeating rudely, that he was not going to treat me any different from any other customers. \n\n\nWhen I went to the water station to help myself there was a lady fixing the cups. The lady asked me if I was having a good time. I informed her of what had occurred with the other owner and how I felt I was being subliminally racially discriminated against. I had a pleasant conversation with her and she had revealed that she was the owner of the bar and her name was Pipper and how she was Matt's wife. At the end of the conversation, I thanked her for changing my perception. I then went back to my seat where my friend was seated. Matt stood in front of me cleaning a cup and had rudely informed me that after tonight I was no longer welcomed into his bar. I informed him that it was perfectly fine and I would be leaving shortly. After exchanging words with Matt, Piper stood right behind me and disrespectfully informing me that I had to leave the establishment. I informed Pipper that I had just finish saying I was leaving and I could walk myself out. She began following me out, then suddenly she GRABBED MY ARM! I told her I was a respectable person from the community and a peace officer. I also informed her that there was especially NO NEED for her to be grabbing me and I was leaving her racist establishment without making a scene. I began questioning her of the need and audacity to place hands on me as she began to retrieve her physical grip and walked away.\n\n\nI have never experienced this level of disrespect in my LIFE!!! I am a person of the community, I have worked in the neighborhood for years in nonprofit work and now work as a respectable peace officer. I am completely APPALLED and ANGERED by the way I was treated and how both owners teamed up to badger and verbally disrespect me regarding a comment I made to my friend that was not meant for him to hear.\n\n\nGiven the fact San Francisco is enriched with a plethora of different cultures and nationalities from all walks of life, I did not find it skeptical to notice the bar was filled with predominantly Caucasian hipsters and myself being one of the only Latina females. This observation was never the issue. I honestly felt that the owners were targeting me given that I was the minority within the establishment. Knowing an extensive amount about customer service and its expectations, customers are an essential factor to a growing business and its reputation. Customer service should always be demonstrated as legendary to continue the growth and longevity of a business. And feel free to quote me if I am wrong, but it all begins with customer and employee optimizing interactions. Sadly, this business did not fulfill any of the criteria of a legendary service. Yes, if I were verbally antagonizing the owners and fellow customers along with demonstrating a volatile behavior then fine by all means get loud and ask me to leave! But I've engaged in none of these obscenities.\n\nOther precautionary measures could have been taken. We could have discussed the issue and delegated out the tension and negativity, but NO! Matt decides to feel violated and have his sense of pride shaken by a female due to catching whiff of someone's personal opinion spoken about him. Piper and Matt, your customer service is a fail. Try putting hands on the next person and let's see if after letting go, you'll be able catch another quick break!", "author": "Cindy A."}

Was acknowledged by the bartender 10 minutes after sitting at the bar. There were maybe 20 people in the bar total, and three parties ordering drinks. I understand the drinks take a minute to make, but at least be friendly and acknowledge your patrons.\nBarback asked if we needed anything / if we were doing OK. Asked if she could take drink orders and she said yes, so I ordered. 15 minutes later, no drink, no bartender at the bar.\nI was at the empty bar trying to cancel my drink and close out, while the barback sat with her boyfriend having an intimate moment. No acknowledgement. I had to ask for her help, in which she replied a very template response, 'the bartender will take care of that for you.' There was no bartender behind the bar. I asked her if she could cancel the drink order I placed with her, and her template response came out again, 'the bartender will take care of that for you'. I don't think she even put the drink order in, and was so infatuated with her non-work conversation. It was very rude. I recommended this place to a group of 6 friends, in which two made comments about how rude the barback was aside from my interaction. Sad, this place is so good, to have such poor service. I really don't think it was the bartender's fault.", "author": "Trevor M."}

I came here with a friend as our first stop on a cocktail binge in the Mission, we went with the Grandad's Special and Gift of the Andes. Grandad's Special was a nice spin on a manhattan-like drink. Gift of the Andes may need some less mixology to it, because the flavors seemed to clash too much and leave a strong fruit aftertaste. The bar has a cool pool table, but the service is a bit lagging.", "author": "Nikita K."}

But do avoid Friday & Saturday nights(it's crowded). The drinks take awhile to make... but I guess it wasn't as crowded that I did not have trouble with the bartender as most of these reviews stated. The fries were over seasoned in a spiced powder. The citrus drink I had with vodka, lime, pineapple, turmeric was delicious but easily fucked me up later on. I was buzzed. I think they frequently change their drink menu and I was actually excited to try their mission mule but didn't want to be a pain to order a drink from their previous menu. Would like to visit again if it's not as crowded.", "author": "Ann L."}

And one star for decor! What I didn't like was that the bartenders seem very annoyed to be at the bar and they all had very stale faces! I only got one smile from who I think was the barback. One thing that really bugged me was when a homie who was a little buzzed wanted to get some food and a short stack bartender went off on him, 86 him and making a scene! If this was a tech person they would've cater to him regardless!! To the owner of the bar you need to tell your bartenders to treat everyone equally regardless of how they look! One bad move like this to the wrong person and your going to end up like locals corner. Please have your bartenders respect La Mission and all its characters! FYI the drinks could use improvements they were ok, but I believe the bartender was a beginner so he will get a pass. Would I come back idk? I do recommend the food.", "author": "Duke Of Frisco X."}

The bartenders are extremely skilled, ready to make whatever your heart desires. The cocktail selection is excellent, as well as the bar bites. I had the pink deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes. The burrata melted perfectly on the tomatoes for some cheesy goodness. \n\nThe bar is beautifully decorated with plenty of space for groups. It feels very much like a classy friend's comfortable living room. There is a huge wood bar, and great details throughout. The glassware is an especially nice touch to complement the delicious cocktails. \n\nAlthough this place has barely been open, it's already popular. I found enough seats to comfortably fit my group of four though, since this bar is surprisingly big! I was really impressed at how fancy and clean the bathrooms rooms were, something of a rarity in the Mission. Definitely check this place out!", "author": "Amy B."}

The decor includes couches, cushioned bar stools, a pool table and even a couple of pinball machines.  Owner Matt works the bar like the cocktail wizard he obviously is and everyone else on staff really seems to enjoy being part of the great vibe \"Evil Eye\" creates.
