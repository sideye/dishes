Our delivery order arrived via Caviar last Friday, June 29th around 12:30pm.\n\n*Tres Empanadas:Served with guasacaca sauce (avocado dipping sauce), Queso ($7.50)\n*Shrimp Ceviche: With plantain chips ($9.50)\n\nOur orders were a little confusing as I don't think anything was labeled. Also, a coworker ordered a side of plantain chips so we figured the side that showed up was hers. After recapping the food above, I discovered my ceviche came with chips, so they actually forgot hers. At least I'm assuming the chips were mine and not the side she ordered. I wouldn't have ate them anyways, but they got our order wrong. It was also not packed well as the liquid from my ceviche got everywhere. If someone had a seafood allergy, they would not have been able to eat their dish.  Moving on to the food...\n\nThe ceviche was a good size. A nice amount of shrimp, avocado, etc. It was heavy on the tomato which I didn't prefer. And it was missing some acidity to balance it all out. I tried one of the empanadas my coworker ordered and they were not the normal empanadas I'm used to. There was no crust. It was basically like eating a smushed mozzarella stick. I didn't mind as I adore mozzerella sticks, but if you want that pie like crust, you will not find it here.\n\nThe food overall was average, but subtracting a star for the delivery situation. Maybe everything is better in house, but I found myself wanting more.", "author": "Elena N."}

I've had arepa's only a couple of times before so I was excited to try this place. It is located on Valencia & 15th and I was able to find parking on 15th a couple of blocks down. After going through the menu, I decided to get the Sweet Yellow Arepa with the shredded beef Pabellon filling ($11.50) to-go. After ordering it was a quick 10-minute wait and I was on my way.\n\nI got a small desert/snack size container with the arepa. It was a decent sized corn pocket which had become soggy. It had a nice sweet tinge which balanced the taste of the shredded beef perfectly. Unfortunately, the beef was a little chewy. It also two fried plantains that were way too oily for my taste. Overall, I thought this was passable. My memories of Arepas is that they are crispy/crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Maybe the drive home messed all this up.\n\nPrice wise it was pretty high for the quality and service size. If you are a light eater a single Arepa may be enough but most would need either the combo or a side of fries for a complete meal. If I'm in the area I'll give them another try but given what I got I'm not in a hurry to do that.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Finally had a chance and came by on a Sunday around noon for lunch with a group of friends. The line wasn't too long but the space is very cramped and we had a fight for about 15 minutes (after we got our food) to snag one of the few larger tables near the door. I definitely say this is an easier place to go to alone for a quick takeout meal. There's some bar seating but it runs parallel to the line and can get really cramped and uncomfortable. Because of how long the lines were there weren't any employees cleaning the tables which was unpleasant since the table before us left a mess but we didn't want to bother the employee who looked completely swamped at the register.\n\nOtherwise service was fine and the food came out fairly quickly and I appreciate how clean and straightforward their menu is. Between our group we ordered a variety of arepas with both white and yellow corn and a variety of meats. We also got a side of garlic Yuca fries and their nachos pica pica. \n\n1) Arepas: For my meal I got the blackened beef asado in a sweet yellow arepa. It came with a pleasantly light slaw on the side that pairs well with the meat. The arepa itself was really dry for the most part. I had a hard time chewing through it and it had very little flavor. The meat had juices flowing but texture-wise was stringy and slightly dry as well. The cheese and slaw were the main saviors. A bit pricy at over $10 (2.75/5)\n\n2) Garlic Yucca Fries: The garlic yucca fries were decent at first but once they weren't piping hot they revert to a stale-ish sawdusty texture. They had a thick crunch and a fluffy but dry starchy texture inside. I love the garlic on top and wish there was more. The fries became more of an aioli delivery vehicle for me after a while. (3.25/5)\n\n3) Pica Pica Nachos: The best part of the meal were definitely the nachos. Not exactly the most traditional dish but they're delicious and I don't care. I love taro chips and these were done very well. Large, evenly cooked, thin crisp chips stacked high with toppings. The only downfall of the dish was the pork which was flavorful but once again dry. (4.25/5)\n\nOverall, this wasn't the arepa heaven I was looking for. I may give the arepas another shot while I get more nachos though.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Forget tortillas - how about arepas??? \n\nIt wasn't too busy inside around 3pm on a Sunday, and we took our time assessing our options from the menu before settling on the 3 small arepas sample platter. There are a variety of fillings, but we chose the Spicy Chicken, Asado Negro, and vegan options.\n\nEven before our arepas arrived, I was already so excited by the number of sauces that this place offered. There were three types of aioli-type sauces, as well as a hot (?) sauce in big glass bottles. After lusting over other people's arepas, which were gaping open and showing the treasures within, we finally got our order. The arepas came looking adorably small but stuffed with fat plantains and meat, along with a side of slaw. \n\nPro tip: try everything separately before you have it all together! Only then will you get that crumbliness of the cornmeal wrap, the sweet juiciness of the plantain, and the smokiness of the meat... And there are so many more fillings and sides to try, along with the sweet corn tortillas that they also offer!\n\nI have now made it my mission to get this place to cater at our next work event.", "author": "Sophie W."}

Do it. \n\nI saw Pica Pica featured on Triple D years ago with Guy Fieri and walked passed the restaurant on many occasions as I strolled down Valencia. But only this year have I finally made an effort to stop by for dinner and boy was it worth it! I am disappointed that I didn't go sooner.\n\nOrder your food at the counter and grab a number. Three types of sauces are on the table and made in house. You can go for zesty, Herby, or spicy. The arepas are all delicious and the meats are juicy and flavorful - you can't go wrong. There are two different types of \"breads\". The original is made of white corn while the sweet is a yellow sweet corn. For the latter, I found the flavor subtle but my coworker found it too sweet for her - I think it's just personal preference. The sizes of the dishes are pretty substantial but definitely try out the fried plantains and yuca fries. The yuca fries are cut much thicker and have a denser texture than a typical french fry so you definitely can't eat as many. Make sure you eat them while hot though as that's when they taste best. \n\nSo... back to the nachos. If you think you've had taro chips and haven't liked them, you still need to try these. The chips are sliced super thin so that every bite is paired with a crisp base. Unlike tortilla chips, the taro chips have a very satisfying snap when you bite into one and are lightly salted. The chips are then loaded with savory meats, beans, fresh cheese and other toppings. It's a great dish to share if you're not too hungry but could also be a large meal for one if you really wanted.\n\nI'll need to come back a few more times but for now, it's certainly on my list of quick bites.", "author": "Liza X."}

The ingredients that go into each arepa was a fantastic combination, great balance. Protein, acid, savory, sweet, they thought of everything. And they've really made what goes into their arepas more complex, more creative, so that it all comes together nicely and balances out. The sauces they have really bring the arepas to another level, especially the hot sauce that had a perfect tanginess to it, and their cream sauces that had a great balance of herbs to it. But the arepa themselves, the part that should matter, what this place is named after, the corn cakes, were dry and tough, so it took away from the whole experience. Maybe if we had gotten the large individual sized ones vs the mini sizes it would've been less dry. \n\nYuca fries were pretty good, but the dipping sauce wasn't strong enough.

It was in Miami, and boy they were the bomb, so I was very excited to find this spot. I ordered nachos, pulled pork arepas, and shredded beef arepas via the yelp Eat24 app. \n\nThe nachos had amazing flavor. The cheese, beans, tomatoes, and onions were fresh and juicy. They missed putting pork on our orders, but we were refunded so thank you for that. It is made with taro chips, which are healthy and delicious. However, they were unevenly cooked, so I tasted a lot of bitterness. If I burnt some chips at home I'd eat them, but was expecting a restaurant to toss the burnt pieces. \n\nThe arepas were also decent, especially with the 3 sauces they have. I'm not a fan of the original white shell, they were not as crispy as I had hoped for, but it could be caused by being in delivery containers. The side slaw were way too sweet for me. To be fair I've only had Venezuela food once before, maybe that's authentic and just how they like it. \n\nOverall it seems like the flavor is there, just lacking in execution a little bit.

It arrived fairly on time, but without utensils or napkins. I had to sip my soup from the container and pick the chicken out with my hands.

It was also more dense then I thought that it was going to be. The black bean puree was flavorless and the shredded beef was actually pretty dry.

There are a variety of arepas available with different kinds of meat.

Pretty limited menu overall but it's a small and new-ish establishment with a solid focus so, fair.\n\nOrdered the shrimp ceviche and 2 of the arepas. The food came out pretty fast and seemed simple enough. The ceviche was quite watery, and very sweet with almost a ketchup-y sort of taste and a couple of shrimps, plus a small bit of taro chips. It wasn't terrible but definitely wasn't anything special. The pulled pork arepa with tomato, avocado and aioli was pretty good, especially on the yellow arepa. The filling has a very minuscule kick but the creamy avocado/aioli balances everything out pretty nicely. Meanwhile, the shredded beef pabell\u00f3n was a less complimentary mesh of flavors, with the thick and super sweet plaintain and the beef. While they were okay, it was very expensive for 2 rather small arepas for $10 and a very small cup of cole slaw.

The arepa also came with a good amount of aioli-like sauce and a green chile sauce, and there was even more on the table for squirting. My favorite sauce was the spicy aioli, as it was just so complex in flavor! Each arepa also comes with cole slaw on the side, which was very sour, but a good refreshing contrast to the meats.

The texture of the yucca was so smooth without being the least bit dry or gritty--the garlic flavor was so aromatic, and they went perfectly with the aioli sauce for dipping! \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic little restaurant with delicious, simple food. The portions were not too heavy and were fair for the price, and the service was fast and no frills. I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try out this classic Venezuelan street food!", "author": "David K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "TLDR - Tasty meat but portions are a little small for a meal and a little expensive for a snack\n\nSmall little spot in the Mission. Not a lot of seating so it's not great for a large group of people. Expect to have to wait for a table if it's busy or plan to take your food to go. They're known for their arepas, or corn pockets, but they also have other things like rice plates, cachapas (sweet corn crepes) and salads.\n\nI've been back twice now and tried the cachapas and the arepas, both of which you can choose the meat filling (beef, pork, chicken, veggie). The CACHAPAS ($14.50) are served with a side salad and bigger in portion size. The AREPAS ($10) are served with a small cup of cole slaw (light and sweet/tangy rather than mayo based) and are honestly pretty tiny and feel more like a pricey snack rather than a meal. I've had both the white corn arepa and yellow corn, and definitely prefer the sweet yellow corn. The white corn was flavorless, but I did like the crisp, grilled exterior.\n\n* SPICY CHICKEN CATIRA - 4.5/5\n[mozzarella cheese, greens, tomato, pica'pun]\nI got my spicy chicken without cheese in the cachapa and thought it was delicious! The chicken was soft and moist. The flavor honestly just tasted like a less sweet, less thick version of BBQ sauce mixed with thousand island, but I enjoyed it. Not very spicy. I loved the sweet corn crepe! Soft and chewy with some slightly crispier parts. I only wish the sauce didn't make the crepe soggy at the bottom.\n\n* GRILLED CHICKEN - 3.5/5\n[black bean puree, tomato, queso fresco, guasacaca]\nI got the grilled chicken on the white corn arepa and thought it was lacking flavor overall. The grilled chicken was tender but simple in flavor, and probably would have paired better with the sweet corn. I'm not a fan of beans so I was a little hesitant about the black bean puree, but it was a great consistency and not overpowering. Probably the healthiest meat option.\n\n* CRISPY CHICKEN - 3/5\n[spicy pickled mojo, lettuce, jicama, tomato, aioli, guasacaca]\nNot particularly crispy, kind of dry and also lacking flavor. Between this and the grilled chicken, I thought the grilled chicken was better since it was at least tender.\n\n* YUCA FRIES ($5.25) - 3/5\nMeh. If you like thick cut potato fries, you'd probably like these. I prefer thin, crisp fries, so I wasn't as fond of these. Very thick cut, drier than normal fries and pretty bland unless you douse them in sauce. At least they weren't super greasy and had some crispness on the outside.\n\nOverall, solid food, but depends on the meat you get. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other meat options or even their nachos or salads (yes, those looked good too), but might pass on the arepas since they're rather small.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Lucky for me, I did some research and found Pica Pica's arepa, and they're made of corn and it's gluten-free! Dream come true!\n\nWe came in on a Thursday night and it was super busy. People were coming in and out, people left their garbage on the table, the line didn't stop and the cashier was in charge of taking your order, dealing with take-out, refilling condiments and utensils on the table, and cleaning up after you! Whoo! She deserves a raise!\n\nWe ordered the Nachos Pica Pica ($14) which included pulled pork, taro chips, black beans, cheese, tomatoes and guasacaca sauce. Have you ever had taro chips? It's very interesting and new to us! The boyfriend said it tasted like chlorine? Hmm... I don't know if that's good or bad, but I'm just happy we tried it! The pulled pork was pretty chunky and cold but moisted up when dunked in the sauce! \n\nSecondly we had the shredded beef arepa ($10) with sweet plantains, black bean puree, queso fresco sauce in a yellow arepa pocket. I thought the yellow corn pocket was sweet and chewy and when combined with the plantain made it even sweeter. The shredded beef became a bit invisible to me because of the overpower of sweetness. I ended up picking out the beef and eating that first before eating the sweet yellow pocket with the plantains like a \"dessert\".\n\nLastly, we had the pulled pork pernil arepa ($10) that had tomatoes, half of an avocado, pica'pun, aioli sauce in a white arepa pocket. The pulled pork had a kick to it and it was really good on it's own. Unfortunately, I wasn't super wow'd by the white pocket. I thought that they were two separate things that didn't mold well together. But I loved them separately and enjoyed them separately!\n\nOverall I felt like Pica Pica has a good background and theme. The price was a bit shocking but it is very filling for such a small pocket. I like that it is gluten-free and that it satisfied my cravings!", "author": "Linda K."}

The pernil was very bland, most and juicy as it should be but no flavor for the first time of the maybe 5 times I've had it. The other very obvious difference, the employees just don't seem to care. All of our previous visits the employees were happy, helpful, listened to the customers, joked with them. They seemed genuine ya know?

The sauce was also too spicy for him - and he usually takes spicy pretty well. So if you can't take spicy - ask them for less sauce or sauce on the side. \n2) Grilled Chicken Arepa - came with avocado and black bean sauce also. I think this on was pretty good, but since the corn wrap is a little thick - it taste a little bland, but you can spice it up with their 3 selection of sauces. \n3) Yuca fries - These are not your typical fries! Yuca are roots - so the taste is a tad different than potatoes. They taste great with their red sauce. Get this as a side, because 3 yuca fries and my arepa definitely filled me up.\n\nIn addition, to their arepas, they also have bowls, salads, and these taro and plantain chips with meat and sauce I'm so coming back for to try! \n\nSERVICE: \nFriendly and effective. I can tell the food could take awhile to come out if this place was packed. \n \nAMBIANCE: \nVery festive and culturally decorated. A lot of natural lighting from the window which is great. Most seats are for parties 4-6 and single seats by the wall. Not the most spacious place, but decent sizes. \n\nOverall, great place to try if you want to try a different variation of mexican food - latin american food in this case. Food was pretty heavy for me haha. But  I will be back to try their taro and plantain chips!!!", "author": "Samantha F."}

Get a basket instead of just a side of it. \n\nI wish the tables were cleaner overall, but I guess that's what happens at places where you bus your own tables.. But I think they should still have someone go around and do the occasional wipe down.\n\nI'll also be honest, I'm a little bit salty about this place because the ledge that the silverware on is SLANTED. And I put my coconut lime juice on it while juggling my bags without noticing it was slightly slanted and my juice slowly slipped off without me noticing and spilled. I know I shouldn't expect it, but MOST places I go to, they would have just given you another one. And I know I shouldn't expect it, and honestly I'm happy to pay for another one (I did), but here they just asked me if I wanted to buy another one. Made me more frustrated than I already was.

It was so delicious and I made the right decision ordering this! It is a crepe made from fresh sweet yellow corn and the filling consists of plantains, shredded beef, black bean puree and cheese with a side of spring salad. The combination goes really well together because the sweet corn crepe balances out the savory shredded meat and bean puree. \n\nThe portions are pretty big too!

This past time I went I ordered the same meal, asking again to make sure it was dairy-free. This other person told me it was once she removed the aioli.. When I asked if the aioli had dairy in it, she replied yes and moved on. \n\nI ended up feeling so unsafe eating the food, as I didn't even know what was in it.. Nor did it seem anyone who worked there knew what was in the food. It wasn't listed anywhere on the site or on the menu in person whether items were dairy-free, or other allergen-free, so the cashier can tell you anything she/he wants...\n\nAlso when I got my cachapa, it looked like there was still aioli smeared on the bottom of it, though I guess I can't be sure...\n\nJust take caution..

The corn pita (or pocket) was dry, a bit flaky, the avocado gave it some creaminess, and the pulled pork was bland. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing?\n\nThe restaurant itself is narrow with seating around 3 walls and the kitchen and restroom taking the space in the back.

I'm not sure if it was an off night or this is one of those classic examples where vegetarians just don't see/feel/understand the magic the way their omnivore brethren do, but it was just okay. While the prices are awesome, the food was actually kind of a let down to me:\n- Garlic Coconut Rice: we only got this because other reviews said it was so good, but ours had no flavor whatsoever; it was just a big mound of bland, overcooked rice.\n+/- Yucca Fries: delicious! SO DELICIOUS. Crispy on the outside, melt in your mouth on the inside, I could have eaten just these all night long but... Iiterally we got five pieces. What am I supposed to do with five pieces (which, by the way, comes out to a dollar a fry)? \n+/- Vegetarian Arepa: I wasn't expecting this to be so sweet. Mine was mostly filled with plantain, so when I did hit pockets of avocado or bean, it was a reminder that this was dinner and not dessert.\n\nAlso, the service seemed a bit weird to me. Someone brought our food over to us and insisted it was ours despite us telling them otherwise, so we didn't touch it. About ten minutes later our actual food came to us, so they took the first tray of food away and plopped it in front of its actual owner. I don't know, is that weird to anyone else? I felt badly for the people who got a cold meal. \n\nAgain, off night maybe? Regardless, I'm just not inspired enough to ever find out if it was or wasn't.", "author": "Steff D."}

Every time I go to any city I try to find a Venezuelan restaurant because that's my favorite food (I'm Venezuelan). This place was incredibly disappointing! The staff was super rude. The girl taking the other seemed annoyed and was not helpful at all. After ordering I realized this place is actually very expensive. I live in Seattle which is also not a cheap city and most of the places that sell arepas have them for $8. When the food came it was not at all what I expected. I got an Asado negro arepa and it was the worst one I've ever tried and I've been eating Asado negro since 23 years (no kidding) that's my favorite dish. Also who serves arepas with cole slaw??? My boyfriend got a cachapa and the last thing that had was corn. It was basically made with yellow arepa mix and maybe a spoon of corn when it supposed to be made entirely of corn. Also came with a salad (very odd). While we were eating the other girls in charged of cleaning the tables was literally slamming the dishes around to the point where everyone was looking at her. Over all just sad. would not recommend.\nBtw there's was nobody from Venezuela in that place. We are normally very nice people.", "author": "Maria Gabriela C."}

The pork was flavorful and moist. I tried every sauce with it, and they all sang in my mouth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-21", "description": "I used to live in Miami, so I was super excited to see a Venezuelan place to feed my craving for a taste of home.  Arepas are my gluten-free secret weapon at home, but I never actually tried the Venezuelan ones.  I always make Colombian, and Venezuelan food was all about the empanadas for me.\n\nYou must know that this place was jam packed!  The line was long and people were watching like hawks to nab some seating, which was quite limited.  They got through the lines pretty efficiently. I got the lechon (roasted pork) arepa.  The arepa was tender, light, and fluffy like a gluten-free cloud that fell down from the heavens.  It was divine!  The filling, however was aiiiiight.  It was a bit bland for me.  Lechon should be a flavorful kick in the pants, but this was just a touch of flavor and no real zip or characteristic garlickiness.  It wasn't awful, but just pretty good.  It was nothing I was dying to have again.  \n\nDon't let me forget about the root vegetable chips.  No good.  They were super bland and cut way too thick for being the extra dense variety of vegetables they were.  They were also cooked too dark and had zero salt it flavor at all.  The \"guasacaca,\" which I have made before, was just regular old guacamole. No, they are not the same.  They were super funny about giving it out too.  They had forgotten mine and they were all debating about it in Spanish, like it was gold.  It's just the tiniest little spoonful that you get anyway.\n\nFor me, the arepa was the stuff of dreams, but the filling needed work.  The aguas, however, were the bomb.  The guava was refreshing and sweetened just right.  I would certainly go back just for that.  As for the food, everything was pricey and the flavor didn't really make up for it.  However, if you've never had the real deal, or if you're scared to venture out and try something new, it'll do the trick.", "author": "Kristen H."}

Each came with a couple bites of dressed tangy cabbage salad.\n\nPernil (spicy pork, avocado) ($10) - tasty and good portion of non fatty meat.\n\nSpicy Chicken ($10) - good, but the spiciness factor just came from the creamy hot sauce that is on the tables--that sauce is pretty spicy, so taste before you douse.\n\nOverall good, flavorful food, but just manage your expectations for the price-quantity.  Portion size is good for a slightly heavier snack, so if you're looking for a meal, be sure to order something in addition to an arepa.", "author": "Vanessa O."}

I got the yellow corn arepa with beef, nachos, and the corn crepe with crispy chicken. The corn arepa was disappointing, to say the least. The corn shell was barely crisp on the outside, although grilled, and mushy on the inside. The worse part of this was the beef that had so much watery sauce that it leaked through the arepa and made it impossible to eat. The sauce disintegrated the arepa and made everything fall apart. Is this the arepa's fault or the beef? I think both.  \n\nThe closest thing I can say to describe the arepa is that it's like a very, very dense cornbread with meat stuffed inside. I wish the arepa held the integrity of its shape as a pocket more to allow me to actually eat is as... you know a stuffed pocket (kind of like Mediterranean pita pockets in concept). Another thing was that the flavors didn't blow me away - they were good, there's no doubt about that, but not something that would make me want to come back. \n\nThe nachos ... were a good combination of salty, sweet, spicy. It was a tad bit on the salty side though. Another problem was that the taro chips got mushy REALLY quick and weren't crispy. Again, there was so much watery-something (juice from pork? beans? something?) that flooded the bottom of the nachos which doesn't help. I don't think taro chips stay crispy for long though so I won't ding them too much on this. I wish they could address why their dishes seem to be swimming in pools of water/sauce...\n\nThe coconut lime agua fresca was really good though, but a little on the sweet side! Coconut cream mixed with lime so you get a bit of zesty sour tang with sweet, sweet coconut. Kind of like a non-alcoholic pina colada lol. I'd definitely recommend this if you like coconut.", "author": "Melody L."}

They have about 6 tables and some counter seats as well. I came with a group of 4 around 630pm on a Friday evening. Waited about 25 mins for a table because all the tables were taken. Once we got a table we order. Lucky we waited to order if not, we would be eating standing up. It was my first time trying Arepas. You can choose from white or sweet (yellow) corn. \n\nWe ordered: \n**Garlic Yuca Fries Basket - It was okay, nothing amazing but not bad. There isn't a lot of flavor. It was crispy, but I rather have regular french fries.\n**Nachos Pica Pica made with pulled pork, taro chips, black beans, cheese, tomato, guasacaca sauce. - My favorite dish of the night. It was huge. Definitely something to share. I wish the pork had a little more flavor. \n**Pulled Pork Pernil Arepas with sliced tomatoes, avocado, pica pun, garlic aioli. - Wins best presentation. They use the same pork as the nachos. \n**Spicy Chicken Catira Arepas made with mozzarella cheese, greens, tomato, pica'pun. - Not at all spicy. But good flavor. \n**Crispy Chicken Arepas made with pickled mojo, lettuce, jicama, tomato, guasacaca. - Recommend with white corn instead of sweet. My favorite of all 4. The best flavor. \n**Blackened Beef Arepas made with sweet plantain, queso fresco. - It was way too sweet for me. \n\nWe also ordered the Sangria and **Fruit Frescas (coconut and lime). Sangria passion fruit. Does not taste like any others sangria. It was good because I can't taste the alcohol. The coconut drink was good, but you have to keep stirring it because the separation of the ingredients. More lime than coconut. \n\nRecommend to add the white and spicy sauce together. I use that for almost everything that night. Overall, my experience was just okay. Wish the flavors was more enhanced. People were nice and food came out quick.", "author": "Sandy B."}

The counter staff assured me without the aioli it would be all vegan (yay) and it came with a nice side salad and the dressing was vegan as well. My boyfriend got the Shredded beef plate (with Coconout rice, black beans & sweet plantains). The total came out to around $27.00 without tip (sheesh).\nWe were the only people in there so the food came out quick and it was hot/fresh. I was just not impressed. My Cachapa was SO GREASY. The tofu was a bit under seasoned and the combination of grease and super sweet crepes with sweet plantains was just kinda over whelming (I added some hot sauce for a bit of heat). My boyfriend said his was good, and the portions were quite filling.

Came here for the first time on Wed around 430p after work (day before Thanksgiving) and surprisingly there was a few parking spots right in front of the resto. Loved that right away! \n\nThere was no line and only 5 other people dining and seating was not a problem. The lady at the counter was super friendly. Being my first time here, went with her suggestion with the pulled pork corn arepa. Also ordered a side of garlic yuca fries and a passion fruit sangria. \n\nThe order came out extremely quick. Everything about the arepa I thought was delicious! Not dry at all and flavorful. The yuca fries were yummy. I'm a fries person only wish it was double the order haha. That's just me. I was so excited about eating that I forgot to try the sauces. Will definitely try them out next time. \n\nAll in all, I had an excellent experience.", "author": "Erica M."}

At Pica pica, you order at the counter, grab a number, and after you are finished with your delicious food, you are expected to bus your own tables.\n\nFor 4 people, we ordered:\n- Pork Nachos w/Taro Chips\n- Garlic yucca Fries\n- Pork cachapas\n- chicken arepas\n- Mango fresca \n- passionfruit fresca \n\nOne order of pork Nachos can easily fill 4 people if you order other things.  The bed of taro chips were topped with pulled pork, tomatoes, guac, cheese, and what they call the Guasacaca sauce.  Not too sure how to describe the sauce, but the combination of everything was magic! The taro chips are a bit thicker so there is a crunch to every bite.  And even until the very last bite, the taro chips did not get soggy. The garlic yucca fries were also amazing!! Very Garlicky!! I prefer the cachapas over the arepas, but both were good. The arepas itself was a bit more bland compared to the cachapas, which is a sweet corn crepe.  The mango and passionfruit frescas were both too sweet. But I prefer the passionfruit over the mango.  \n\nNext time I would love to try their plantains, and ceviche. And of course get everything I ordered again ^_^ (minus the frescas)", "author": "Janel L."}

Its one of those restaurant where you pay at the cashier for your food and drinks and seat wherever you want and they'll bring out your food. This place is very small so it can get pack fast during rush hours. \n\nI got the arepa white corn with pull pork. It comes with side vegetables. The pork was very tender and moist and has that sweetness from the flatbread. They do have a few special sauces that can either give the extra tangy, spiciness, or sweetness to go with your food. The vegetable has the sweet and sour favor. It cost $7.99. Although the food is good, but its quite pricy for a small meal. The price was not worth it.

It was a bit spicier than I would've liked it (is that what pica pun is?) so next time I will request that they leave the spicy sauce out as the pork itself was flavorful enough on its own.\n\nWhite Corn Vegetariana Arepas - I absolutely love the black beans and the sweet plantains in it.

We came here for the first time and tried an arepa and the pork nachos.  The staff was great, very helpful and the food came out in good time.  We really liked the flavors of the fried chicken arepa and thought the nachos plate looked fantastic.  We couldn't wait to try the taro chips because that is a favorite and not often on most menus.  After a few bites, however, we were disappointed -  The chips had no distinguishable taro flavor (not sure why), the pork was dry, hard to chew and also did not have any flavor, the small amount of guacamole was watery and the overall dish was bland.  We would usually welcome a mountain of taro chips, but given that the chips had no taro flavor, a suggestion is to perhaps have a few less chips and add some toppings that have some contrast?  We may go back to try more arepas and other items, but not the nachos.", "author": "Mary D."}

While at times the service is slow (they do orders through some apps now, which could be the reason), the food never, ever disappoints.\n\nTo order your arepa, you have your choice of corn. I go with yellow because I feel like it's a little sweeter, but the white is just as good! You then have your choice of meats (chicken or beef) and as a carnivore, I've found that I really love the tofu!

It is basically a grilled corn pancake that is filled with some type of protein. I got Crispy Chicken on Saturday and Grilled Chicken on Sunday. They also have two types of arepa, classic white and sweet yellow. The yellow seems to go better with chicken, but I'm interested in trying the classic white next time around. I also got the garlic yuca fries. Don't worry about the fact that each order only has like five fries. These are like steak fries on steroids and they will fill you up. \n\nThe chicken was perfectly cooked both times but something about the arepa keeps me coming back. So good. \n\nNow that I've had my arepa fill, I've got my eye on the nachos for next time.\n\nShout out to my homie E (known as Ivan F. on yelp), I was scrolling through yelp finding out what other people liked and came across his review.

My only previous experiences with arepas was a little place in Aptos, CA...that was in business well over a decade ago. I forget the name of the place, but frequented it often.\n\nGF and I arrived around 3:30 for a late lunch, and decided to order 3 different arepas so that we could try the flavors. We got the Grilled Chicken, Shredded Beef Pabell\u00f3n, and the Blackened Beef Asado. All were made to order, and took about 12 minutes to be served. \n\nThe place is very small, and we sat at a table in the corner near the door, and large picture window that opened to the street. It was very cold today, and it was a bit of a surprise that the window was wide open, and both of the fans in the restaurant were on. We had jackets, and didn't make a fuss about it, but seems like a bit of an oversight. \n\nAnyway, on to the arepas. They had extremely generous portions of the protein, and were served with a slide of simple cabbage slaw. For me, the plaintains in both of the beef arepas were just too sweet, and so I ended up pulling them out. \n\nThe grilled chicken was my favorite, and it had a nice smoky flavor to it, the Shredded Beef Pabell\u00f3n was #2, and the Blackend Beef Asado pulled in at #3 out of three. \n\nMy main nitpick is that due to the generous amount of protein, there was no easy way to get a perfect bite of all the flavors other than to fork and knife it (perhaps by design). Fortunately they offer plastic forks and knives at each table. I also felt that to get a completely satisfying bite, the sauces really needed to be included, and I would definitely recommend including the slaw in every bite.\n\nThe Mojo (vinegar + heat) is definitely the right stuff. They had three other sauces at the table, one that was kind of spicy chipotle mayo, another that tasted like it had cilantro and lime, and the bright red one was basically ketchup + red pepper, and I wouldn't recommend it (unless you like ketchup). \n\nBottom line after a single visit: Pica Pica seems like a great place for folks seeking a decent gluten free meal. It didn't knock my socks off, but it's a cool spot with some interesting combinations of flavors, and very good protein to dollar ratio.", "author": "Forrest F."}

Everything is gluten-free, most of the menu has no soy, there are many vegetarian and vegan options (with the vegan options marked), and other allergens were easy to avoid.  \n\nThe supergrain is corn, but there are also a lot of beans, plantains, yuca, and avocado.

My friend and I got delivery from here (ceviche, taro chips and yuca fries; all very tasty) and next day ... bad blisters. I couldn't believe it was from this place, since it's supposed to be 100% gluten-free and so a couple of days later, I ate the leftover yuca fries I had kept as part of a late dinner and, the next day, more bad blisters. Of course we don't eat anything with gluten at my house and I never went out, so I can't point to any other source than those yuca fries.\n\nI can't prove anything of course, but I wonder if they are perhaps cooking gluten-free, but not sourcing gluten free (there is cross contamination in factories that process many foods such as herbs, nuts, pulses and seeds along with wheat products).\n\nUpdate 1: I have updated my review to a 3-stars, based on their exemplary response to my original review above. We're going to test the suspect yuca fries. I will update again later.\n\nUpdate 2: Pica Pica folk were as good as their word and tested the fries. They came back negative for gluten down to 2 or 3 parts per million. So it may be sheer coincidence that I somehow encountered gluten both times another way, or it may be that I am one of the few that are so extreme in sensitivity that even 1ppm is a problem (as the FDA suggested in a 2011 report). Whatever the case, I appreciate Pica Pica taking me very seriously and being extremely nice about it throughout. It's great to be understood and respected, even if one's reaction is hard to track down. Many people would have lost their temper or at least been resentful about all this.", "author": "Victoria B."}

So when were back in SF and heard this was the same place, we knew we had to come! I had the pulled pork on the sweet corn arepa which came with avocado and a side of spicy coleslaw. Was a little too spicy for my taste. The sangria was a little too sweet. Plantains are a must. The empanadas (beef and then the plantain with black bean) were okay. Smaller than I expected as we eat Colombian empanadas which are much larger. It's a small place. Order at the counter and then sit down if you can grab a table or counted seat.

I've never had one before so it was great to try something new. I wasn't sure what to expect but it looked a bit like a soft taco! \n\nThe yellow corn pocket is soft and sweet with little corn bits. The filling had sweet plantains balanced out with salty shredded beef, both of which were delicious. I didn't like the black bean mix but because it was not spread throughout the arepa, I was able to scoop that aside. The arepa looked small in pictures so I was afraid it would not be filling, but the portion size was just enough for one person. \n\nUbereats had a deal on this for $5.

I had no expectations coming in, but I'm glad to say that Pica Pica proved to be a very pleasant surprise. \n\nI ordered the pulled pork arepa in the sweet yellow corn pocket. You have the choice of ordering either their classic white or the sweet yellow. I'm glad I chose the sweet yellow because the sweetness of it perfectly balanced out the savory meat. The pulled pork (or pernil) was tender, very flavorful, and even had hints of citrus and sweet aromas. If that's typical of Venezuelan food, then consider me a fan! The arepa was stuffed with the pulled pork, sliced tomatoes, avocados, a great garlic aioli sauce, and their pica'pun sauce. Their pica'pun sauce added the perfect hint of spice to the arepa. There's more of it on the tables that you can use to add to each bite if you'd like (I definitely did). The arepa also came with a side of slaw - nothing special about the slaw but it was a nice addition to the meal. \n\nThe price you pay for an arepa is very reasonable considering how much they stuff the arepas with your choice of meat or tofu if you're a vegetarian.

I decided on the mango/passionfruit agua fresca and the taro and plaintain chips. Agua fresca was nice, but the chips were just alright. They weren't even warm. Taro chips were just okay, and I love taro chips. They just weren't that flavorful and didn't have much of a sweet finish. Plaintain chips were worse - like starchy cardboard.

They serve extremely quickly!  I had enough time to self-fill my glass of water, check my phone, and my order was here.\n\nI ordered an arepa (a grilled corn pocket), a cachapa (corn crepe). plantains on the side, and taro/plantain chips with guacamole.  I got the vegetariana filling (grilled tofu, avocados, pureed beans, and plantains).  All were vegan!  This place is definitely vegan friendly and completely gluten-free.

It was pretty awkward because my boyfriend kept speaking to the owner in Spanish and she kind of would brush it off.

I won't lie; the main reason I first came here was the name.  I also wanted to see what an all-corn-based menu looked (and tasted!) like.  I may have bought something from their booth at the 2009 San Mateo County Maker Faire, but if I did, I don't remember what I got or whether I liked it.\n\nLike a lot of Latin American and Caribbean fare, Pica Pica's food can be a little bit heavy.  It's mainly the plantains, but there's also a way in which the flavors and textures aren't quite different enough to make you feel like you're eating more than one thing.  OK, that doesn't make any sense, but try Pica Pica and tell me that you don't understand that sentence after you've eaten the food.\n\nI've tried everything vegetarian on the menu, but I can't tell you what's best, because it all tastes the same to me.  And I really really really want to eat that giant non-taco as a taco, but the non-taco isn't sturdy enough to keep from falling apart in my hands, so I end up eating it carefully with a fork and knife like some dandy eating a banana in Vienna.\n\nThe food comes up quick, and all the people who work here are nice.  The location adds to the place's charm.  Back in the day, I don't think I would have spent too much time on this block, but I'm fascinated by it as well.  Remember when they ground down the projects into gravel?  That was just crazy.  Pica Pica also made me realize that I can pretty easily walk to the beginning of Haight Street from the Mission.

The kitchen is 100% gluten-free, so every fried item on the menu is safe for celiacs (a.k.a. \"heaven\").\n\nMy favorite meal is the pulled pork pernil, but with chicken instead of pork, on the white arepa. The white arepa is a thing of beauty: made only from corn, it mimics the crispy chewiness of an English muffin. The yellow arepa is closer in consistency to a pancake.\n\nPacked with meat, and together with a side of yuca fries and chipotle catsup, one arepa sandwich makes for a highly satisfying and flavorful meal. The \"fruit frescas\" are a bit on the sweet side, but they do help tame the spice of the meal.\n\nFor dessert (if you have room) you'll want to check out the coconut quesillo, a Venezuelan version of cr\u00e8me caramel, and the yuca beignets (need I say more?).", "author": "Omar Y."}

The sweet yellow arepa is too sweet, and the texture is so consistent and thick. The crispy chicken was over fried and oily....

I was feeling a little hungry, but mostly trying to be proactive, as our plans involved heavy drinking to properly start Pride Weekend off with a bang.\n\nI ordered the Vegetariano arepa, which is described as having \"grilled tofu, avocado, sweet plantains, black beans, garlic aioli\". I asked the cashier if omitting the aioli would make it vegan, and she said yes. I also opted for a side of the yuca fries. Total bill was around $14 bucks (including tip). A little on the pricey side, but I was willing to pay a few dollars extra for something exotic. \n\nYou are given a choice of classic white or sweet corn for your arepa, and I'm a stickler for the classics, so I chose the former. There was a lot of flavor in that bad boy. I especially loved the contrast between the savory ingredients and the sweetness of the plantains. I would order extra plantains, if anything, because if you accidentally eat all of them before you finish the rest of your arepa, it loses a lot of the flavor. \n\nPlus plantains are fan-freaking-tastic, and you should always order extra, regardless. \n\nI've only had one other arepa in my life, and Pica Pica's version was much more flavorful. Then again, I smothered mine with the red chili sauce on the table, which also gave it a nice kick. I love how plentiful the avocado was, as well. \n\nI'm not a gluten-free gal by any means, but this is a terrific option for any of those who are, as nothing in their restaurant contains any gluten. Yes, that's right. It's 100% gluten free! \n\nI appreciate that they offer a few vegetarian options, although I wish there was a vegan arepa listed on the menu, just to even it out and give us cruelty-free folks peace of mind when we order our food.", "author": "Brandi W."}

We also ordered vegetarian nachos that came with taro chips. \n\nThe nachos are heavenly. They're are incredibly delicious, authentic, and absolutely flavorful. All of the ingredients were fresh and the taro chips definitely were a good twist in comparison to traditional nachos chips. \n\nThe vegetarian arepa was a bit mediocre. The tofu was not flavorful at all. It was poorly cooked and not marinated.  The arepa wrap dominated most of the dish. It was sweet, but I expected something savory. \n\nThe coconut lime juice wasn't as potent in sweetness or tangy-ness as I'd like it to be. \n\nFor $40? You can go somewhere else better. \n\nTo-Go: \nIf you ever order it on the yelp app-it works great. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian nachos and the vegetariana ceviche.

Oh sure, I remember a little bit here and there.  But, three things actually stand-out.  1.  The Chupacabra.  Creepy.  2.  In Spanish, a rooster doesn't say Cock-a-doodle-doo.  It says:  Qui-qui-ri-qui.  3.  We saw a commercial for a packaged Arepa mix.  Dona Arepa!  That was the first I'd heard of Arepas.\n\nThere's a part of me that isn't quite sure if I love this place because of the food, or because every time I think of it, I think Dona Arepa!  As this is Yelp, and not a therapy session, we'll go with the fact that I love this place because it is delicious.\n\nThis was my first experience eating Arepas.  The menu is pretty extensive, ranging from starters to arepas to full-size entrees.  I've yet to have anything that wasn't good.  That said, I'm a creature of habit, so I go with the Arepas.  There are two that totally stand out to me:  The Beef Pabellon (with sweet plantains, black bean spread, queso fresco) and the Pulled Pork Pernil (with sliced tomatoes, avocado, pica'pun, garlic aioli).  Take the above, and serve it on a Sweet Yellow Corn Arepa (I've never tried the White Arepa, and I'm not sure I will because the Yellow Corn is SO good).  The mix of flavors is incredible and well balanced.  Truly one of the most tasty places I've come across.  The Arepas are about $9 and come with a nice slaw.  It's plenty of food - although it is tempting to get the Yucca Fries too.  Why - because the killer-star of the place is their side sauces.  Garlic Aioli.  Spicy Jalapeno Mustard.  Some sort of souped-up Ketchup.  Wow.  I'm wondering when they are going to start selling this stuff on its own.\n\nMy one and only conundrum with this joint is that I'm wont to stick with the same thing I've already had because it was just so good.  The platters and the Cachapas (sweet corn crepes) all look great.  But, how to pass-up what I already know is amazing.  ...  These are high-class problems.", "author": "Adam S."}

Also, the kitchen staff doesn't seem to understand what vegan means.\n\nI walked by one day and stopped to see if there were vegan options.  The cashier was really friendly and told me a few things that were vegan or could be made vegan.

We ordered/requested the vegan nachos and some black bean and plantain empanadas.  \n\nThe empanadas they brought out were beef, cheese and black bean/plantain.  It was not what we ordered, but my omnivore friend went ahead and ate the beef and cheese empanadas.  The black bean and plantain empanadas were pretty good.  All were incredibly greasy, tho.\n\nThen the nachos came out and they were sprinkled with cheese.  I asked the server if that was cheese and she said yes.  I told her that I had requested vegan nachos.  She took the plate back to the cashier who kind-of sighed and said that, yes, it was supposed to be vegan.  Then the server came back with what was obviously the same plate, but some of the cheese had been picked off.  I didn't want to make a fuss, as I was there with my friend but it totally grossed me out.  Every few chips I picked up, there was some cheese on it.  I can't believe they gave me back the same plate!!\n\nI'm really disappointed in this place.  It seems unprofessional, unsanitary and all-around GROSS that they picked off some the cheese and gave me the same dish!  They didn't even succeed in taking off most of the cheese.

The real secret for a good empanada is to make them very thin so cook faster and suck less aceite.  The empanadas were in a pool of oil...let it drip a few sec before plating..just a recomendation....\n\nIt was about 2pm and the place had a lot of business. The salads looked good.

My arepa was huge and the spicy chicken which was recommended by the lady at the cash register was delicious in my warm sweet corn arepa. My passionfruit agua fresca like drink was tart and slightly sweet like it was supposed to but the rest of my food wasn't made like I'd had it in the past. \n\nMy beef empanadas to go were great but the cheese \"tres empanadas\" were totally over fried and almost too crispy and soggy with oil. The cheese inside had dried out and when I took a bite the whole thing was like a big fat fried cracker. It crumbed and got grease all over my pants and of course hands. The pot de chocolat with shredded coconut flakes was a nice break from the oil, it was thick and rich and I was good after two bites. My sister enjoyed the rest in the car. \n\nBesides the soup, the highlight was the kid's chicken strips... I don't usually order from the kid's menu but due to my leaky gut and severe sensitivity (actually react immediately) to gluten, I order anything fried if it's gluten free no matter where I go. With their fine and fun sauces I was stoked for the fried chicken. The only problem was that it was an accordion cut. You know when you pick something up and it is one long stip because it is not cut all the way through?!? Still very edible but just with a little more care it would have been a little better. \n\nI don't mind that the prices went up (so it seems) as I just read they closed their Oxbow location which makes me very sad but I think they should bring it back to the level it was a few months back and put that pep back in their step.

Come prepared to wait, squeeze in, and perhaps even share a table. Don't worry, it's a friendly neighborhood. :)\n\nI was hoping to find authentic arepas like I've tasted in some other hole-in-the-wall Argentinian and Venezuelan places. The result was good, but was still missing something.\n\nI opted for the Spicy Chicken Catira arepa. No joke on the spice, my mouth was on FIREEEE. The filling was good, but the classic white corn arepa was quite doughy and lacked flavor. \n\nThere are a variety of sauces at the table, which I dabbled with. Some better than others, but a nice way to accent the flavor of the arepa.\n\nI'm actually surprised at the quantity of food they dish out from the tiny kitchen, but it definitely seems to work!

I placed my order on Eat24 through the yelp app, got my confirmation that my order would be ready in 20-30 minutes. I got there 30 minutes after my order was confirmed and they told me that I had to wait an additional 15 minutes. I was patient and waited. After another 30 minutes of waiting I finally got my food. No apology for the wait or anything. \n\nSo I take my food home and expected some nice and tender shredded pork but the meat was dry and lacked the aioli sauce. This was quite strange since the bottom of the container had a puddle of juice. My husband had the shredded beef arepa and he was disappointed to say the least. They had forgot the plantains and had what look like a rather big inedible bay leaf in it.\n\nI guess I would be more forgiving if this place were a bit more apologetic as I let but there was no remorse. There is no point in ordering online if I still have to wait. I get that it was busy but the extreme wait is not something I would want to waste my time with only to be provided with food less then mediocre. And I will never provide tip beforehand.

Yes, I saw them on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives...and they have such great reviews. Years ago I had actually tried the Pica Pica food truck at the Treasure Island flea market. Back then I ordered the vegetarian sweet corn arepa and thought it was super! My first time at the actual restaurant, though, was greatly disappointing. I actually left the place feeling sad.\n\nI ordered the beef pabellon white corn arepa with a side of yuca fries. The portion size and price I thought seemed normal for the area, so no complaints there, however the taste and quality of the arepa was pretty subpar--almost bad even. After I ordered, my food came out super fast. I was hungry so I picked it up right away and I was not able to even hold it because the whole thing was wet and mushy. So I had to eat it with a knife and fork. The arepa pocket itself was not cooked all the way through and was a little raw inside. The masa was wet and clumpy. The inside was quite lackluster and had just a one-note sweet flavor running through it. Like, sweetness was the only flavor I could taste at all. The beef was not very tasty either--even the meat had absorbed all the sweet flavor. The ratio of meat to plantains was strange too: there was very little meat but 3 big pieces of plantains (it was like a plantain sandwich). I did order the yuca fries and those were delicious though! But the avocado dipping sauce that came with it was super sour...like maybe they had put too much citrus without tasting it. The slaw accompaniment was also overly sour--I know it's supposed to be tart, but it was an unbalanced sour. My first Pica Pica experience at their food truck was great--I liked everything very much...but this experience at their Valencia St restaurant was disappointing. It seriously bummed me out and I was sad for the rest of the day because I had actually planned my day around going to lunch there. They only thing good I can say is that the yuca fries were really good and just like how it was from their food truck.", "author": "Sam C."}

The place is very cute and I love how they have sample dishes laid out in a cabinet so you know how their food looks like. I had ordered the shredded pork arepa and the yuca fries with the spiced ketchup. My total bill came out to $13 without tax. Really expensive for a fast-casual establishment.\n\nMy food came out pretty quick and I was excited to eat, mainly the yuca fries. The yuca fries were not like I remembered. They were more dense than the last time I had it but still had a nice crunch to it. The arepa too was very dense and wasn't light and airy like I had it in Napa.

Pica Pica specializes in Venezuelan street food.  Fond memories of tangy and wholesome fare from prior Latin dining experiences filled my mind and whet my appetite.  Sadly, Pica Pica did not satisfy and fell far short of my expectations.  Frankly, the food was not that tasty and the service was typical of a fast-food joint.\n\nWe tried several of their Arepas, which could be described as a corn flatbread sandwich with your choice of barbecued meat filling and a slice of plantain.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-maize-kitchen-san-francisco?select=fD81tF8tALBFtid4cJCk_g#xn9fSd7LoPVXsSFj8esj7Q   They also offered a vegetarian version with marinated tofu patties instead of meat which was fantastic tasting, better than the meat filling!    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-maize-kitchen-san-francisco?select=fD81tF8tALBFtid4cJCk_g#lPxfsuo3e74-_Y9i3X_8tw  For starters we shared an order of yucca fries, these were super crispy and pretty good when combined with any of their potent sauces.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-maize-kitchen-san-francisco?select=fD81tF8tALBFtid4cJCk_g#z9iY4LjpZMNbRZn_dXgJew\n\nOverall the food was decent and filling but relatively tasteless when compared with my favorite Latin restaurants, Sol Food in San Rafael or Brazil Cafe in Berkeley.

The crispy chicken Plato came with rice, black beans and fried plantain. It was very good. The chicken was a little over fried, causing it to be a bit dry but otherwise it was forgivable and tasty. The salad was tossed with a tasty vinaigrette that complimented the ingredients which were fresh. I actually liked the grilled chicken in the salad more, with the smoky flavor. It was also a bit dry but with the dressing, that helps give moisture. I cut the corn off the cob into the soup, which was flavorable and the chicken in it was shredded and tender. The yuca beignets were moist but also kind of doughy in the center. Maybe it was the yuca. The caramel dipping sauce was alright. Nice decor with cheerful colors and native decorations.

She brought our food out and then brought out something else we didn't order and told me she was out of the yuka and had that instead so I kindly asked her for a refund that I didn't want what she had brought. Don't get me wrong the food is good but it's so damn expensive for a small portion to boot the cashier with black hair doesn't seem to care at all about service or smiling. I understand you don't want to be at work or don't like people but you shouldn't be in customer service if it's like pulling teeth for you to be nice.

Our group was pretty big (7 people), but some people got there early so we got really lucky and snagged the largest table in the place. Also for this reason they don't take reservations.\n\nThe arepa ($8.95) and the cachapas ($10.95) are almost the same thing except cachapas are bigger. So the cashier looks at me and recommends the arepa but obviously I get the beef cachapa ... and eat the whole thing ^___^. Yum. It was very filling.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-27", "description": "My friend and I came here yesterday after she read the ROTD, and announced, I like corn, so let's try it.  Since I had been to the Napa Pica Pica, I told her that this place was going to be THE BOMB, but unfortunately, the Mission location does not compare with the original Pica Pica in Napa, CA.\n\nMy friend and I ordered:\n- a Pabellon arepa\n- a Pabellon Maizewich\n- garlic Yuca fries with aioli\n- Tajadas (stir fried plantains)\n\nThings tasted pretty similar between the Pica Pica in Napa and here, with the EXCEPTION of their plantains (in their tajadas and the plantains that they use to fill their arepas/Maizewiches/cachapas).  The plantains here tasted quite disgusting, almost like a deep fried, wet banana chips sopping with oil, barely even cooked--almost raw and too chewy, and definitely sweet.  Similarly, they smelled rancid, thus enhacing their unpalatable and disgusting taste.  The plantains over in Napa's Pica Pica has truly stirfried plantains, cooked in the Central American/Caribbean style whcih are wet, moist, soggy, and sweet due to the caramelization process from extensive stir-frying that brings out the sweetness.  \n\nBecause plantains are extensively used in Latin American cuisine, I had expected that the Mission's Pica Pica plantains would be cooked as I had like in the Pica Pica in Napa as well as what I've had in Latin American cuisine in general.  But no...and my friend was even more disappointed because she had expected that the plantains would be cooked the way we're used to... and truly the way to bring out the true flavor and sweetness of plantains.  As you could imagine, we could not finish the side of plantains because they just were not agreeable.\n\nThe one redeeming dish that Pica Pica does quite well is their yuca fries, which were as good as the Napa branch's.  Adding the garlic was an excellent touch, but costed an additional 50 cents.\n\nThe arepa and maizewich were so-so, and were a little too burnt.  They grill the arepa and maizewich (flat)breads, almost like a panini...but they overgrilled them that they were a bit on the charred side, imparting bitterness to the food.  It tasted like I was scarfing down carcinogenic charcoal down my throat.  Not very tasty and not pleasing to the palate either.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Pica Pica in the Mission as it did not compare with Napa's branch.  I would have thought that the Pica Pica in SF would be better due to the sheer fact that there are more Hispanics here, so the quality and freshness of the food would be better.  But my expectations were not met.  I don't think I'd come to this Pica Pica branch again due to my poor experiences here.  However, if I am in Napa, I'd definitely go to that Pica Pica since the quality and taste far surpasses the averageness I experienced here in the Mission.\n\nMy overall rating for the restaurant is a 2 *star*.  Breakdown is as follows:  *3* stars for good quality yuca fries, but minus *1* star due to the poor quality of their plantains.", "author": "Matthew L."}

Even though I'm a native San Franciscan, I can always rely on my friend Elise T. to find great eats in SF. She first heard about it in Napa and was stoked to find it here too. I've never tried Venezuelan food prior to this food and now, I'm wondering what other foods I'm missing out on! \n\nI ordered the Pulled Pork Yellow Corn Arepa ($9.50) and includes avocado, tomato, alioli (which contributes to a sloppy wet mess!), and pic a'pun. Initially, the portion seemed small for $9.50, but after taking a few bites, you realize the corn maize pocket will suffice. I loved the juicy, tenderness of the pulled pork. The alioli paired perfectly with the creaminess of the avocado. I squirted a lot of the orange sauce available on the table and though my mouth was burning, it burned too good to stop! \n\nMy friends all order different meats for their arepas, including steak skirt, fried chicken, and grilled chicken. We all sat in silence as we ate, unless we were making \"mmmmmmmmmm\" sounds, if that's not an indicator of how good it is, I'm not sure what is. \n\nMy friend also ordered Nachos ($10.25) and its not your average salsa, meat, cheese, and tortilla chips. Taro chips are used and its thinly sliced, crispy enough to withhold the toppings but still thin enough for a great, light crunch. The pulled pork meat, cheese, black beans, guacamole, and, oh excuse me while I wipe away my drool..... okay okay and Guausacaca sauce (white creamy sauce). IT WAS DELICIOUS! It wasn't really until towards the end that it got a bit soggy, but for the most part, the chips stayed crispy, paired perfectly well with the toppings, and I just want more!\n\nIts a very casual setting but offers high quality, fresh food.

Even the \"platos\" aren't filling on their own, and cost $14 each. So it's easy to spend $25+ per person on a full meal, which is a fortune for this type of meal.", "author": "David C."}

Sometimes, after building something up in your head for so long, the actual experience can't possibly compete. I'm glad to say that isn't the situation at all at Pica Pica. If you've heard good things, expect to experience good things. \n\nIn all my years of gorging on comida latina (I hope I said that correctly, otherwise it looks REALLY pervy), I don't think I'd ever had Venezuelan fare. Because of some cuties from Caracas, it had been on my radar, but I hadn't had the chance to try it. I was missing out. To start with, I ordered a passion fruit fresca. By now, readers should be well aware of my addiction to fruit (juice). I was in fresca overload. Every sip made me want to be in South America. I could have consumed a gallon of the good stuff. Definitely order it. Also? Pace yourself. One arepa might not sound like a lot but it and a couple of sides will be enough to satisfy without turning you in to a fattyfatfatfat. I opted for the sweet yellow corn arepa topped with grilled chicken, black beans, tomato, queso fresco, and Guasacaca sauce (which is magically delicious and a ton of fun to say). To the main course, I added sides of coconut garlic rice and taro chips. AND, to the arepa, I added a variety of the delectable sauces that were on the table (try 'em all).\n\nThe meal... delicious. Absolutely delicious. I'm a voracious eater and between everything I had set before me, I was more than satisfied. I knew I was a fan of arepas but between the yellow corn base and fantastic toppings, I was in culinary heaven. Truly, every bite was a blend of wonderfully satisfying flavor. But, there was more; there was dessert. Before that night, I probably would have passed on yuca beignets and that would have been a mistake. Not only were these beignets reminiscent of donut holes, they were served with a dulce de leche dipping sauce. Done. Done! How can you not be fatkid happy with that kind of sweet treat to close out the meal? Despite Pica Pica having nothing to do with a diner, dive or drive-in (seriously, does NO one in that production have a dictionary), this is a SF haunt to make a destination, be you resident or tourist.", "author": "Johnny T."}

The cachapas were reheated, rubbery and thick, cracked when bent, obviously dry, not fresh by any stretch which is key for a cachapa. The yellow arepa mix was not even right, it was like they mixed cachapa mix with arepa and the texture was off. Real yellow mix is soft and delicious, this was not it. The beef empanada was ice cold on the inside and could not be eaten, my daughter put it down and quit eating. The bean and platano empanada tasted like the bean was a bit spoiled, they should check their product better. The cheese empanada was great as were the yucca fries. So mediocre minus. You get a star for the yucca fries and one because I love Venezuela. So sad, this place used to be great with the sweetest owners.\n\nPs. At least play Venezuelan music at your Venezuelan restaurant.

This was a couple of years ago, but it really slipped from my memory. No offense to the owners, but I had an arepa with Pepeada - shredded chicken mixed with avocado and onions. It was Venezuelan chicken salad in one of their signature corn flour cakes shaped a bit like a Hot Pocket. My most vivid memory is waiting quite a while to get it since Pica Pica was easily the most popular eatery in the market. \n\nNow Pica Pica has come to the Mission where it competes with more rustic pupuserias as well as the full ethnic variety of food to be found here. Taking over for the more friendly and beloved Mi Lindo Yucatan, Pica Pica feels a bit too slick and manufactured to be in this 'hood, yet the audience appears ready-made for the hand-held creations they serve here. Jamie W. and I came to give it a try after having a couple of libations at the Casanova Lounge. We were peckish, not starving, so the tapas-size food was just the ticket. What to order, what to order, hmmmm... \n\nThis time, I avoided the Pepeada and went for the $7.99 Pelu'a Arepa, which has the grilled corn flour cake wrapped around a hefty mound of shredded skirt steak with equally shredded cheddar on top. Pretty good, a tad too salty for my taste (see photo). Jamie ordered the $7.99 Pabellon Arepa, apparently the national dish of Venezuela (stand up please), with shredded skirt steak, black beans and plantain slices (see photo). Heartier than mine but frankly not as tasty to me.\n\nWe shared a $3.99 order of Yucca Fries (Pasapalos) which were just too greasy for me to enjoy guilt-free although Jamie loved them (see photo). I thought the seating set-up was rather awkward with a narrow counter to the right and tables too close together to the left. If a large group comes in just before you, you may find yourself eating standing up. All in all, Pica Pica offers a reasonable dining option in the Mission but definitely not my first choice. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...decent arepas seem a bit pre-packaged to me \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...slick, commercial air about the place, none of the rustic charm of its predecessor (Mi Lindo Yucatan) \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...somewhat indifferent \nTOTAL - 3 stars...I think it made me want a handmade pupusa more", "author": "Ed U."}

We took 3 minutes to order, and she was worried about a shipping order, that she had to excuse herself, when all she had to do was swipe my card, instead of attending to a male delivery man, who didn't seem to mind at all. He wasn't in a rush and wasn't illegally parked, so I thought that was a bit rude. Guests want to feel welcomed and feel like they're appreciated, but that wasn't the case.\nMaria lacked genuinity and does not know how to make a guest feel welcomed.

Well, my argument is, why lock the door and provide a key, when easily a tourist, a guest, a child, an elderly, may not have known the rules to the Pica Pica bathroom. \nI then told Maria, that I will be yelping this because I stated, \"it is not nice to have a guest wait, while you insisted on finishing a shipping order, when all you had to do was swipe my card. Plus, I almost walked in on someone\". Maria then retorted, \"My bad\". \nFurthermore, there were no guests behind me waiting. I was ready, with my card out. I knew what to order since I've been there before. I would take my friends there!\nOnce we received our food, I noticed a line. Maria brought us our arepas which was accompanied by a nice tangy slaw salad. \"If you have any questions, let me know\", if what she told us add she walked away. I said, \"Thank you\".\nThere were 3 small bottles of  mystery sauces. I would have labeled them. What's the name of these sauces? Which one is sweet, spicy, or would it be great to put on the yucca fries, arepas, or salad?\nI was so hungry and excited to eat here again today. Out of all great restaurants in SF, we chose this place. But after such disappointment with the service, the delectable arepa ended up tasting ok and mediocre. A person can really change the taste of a meal, by just the way they look at you, present themselves, out how they make you feel when entering. \nAlso, I asked her why the Castro one closed and she responded with, \"They were more of a sit down place. I really don't know why they closed. Maybe they didn't do so well over there. I've never been to that location\". And I responded, \"I can see why\".\nNonetheless, I miss the Castro location because it had pizazz. When you walk into the bathroom, I noticed all the different framed photos of Venezuelan beauty pageant contestants. It had culture and a great vibe. This one on Valencia seems dark and if they don't change the customer service, it could harm the restaurant successes. \nI would love to go back, so that my mind will change about this once favorite restaurant of mine. \nI left feeling disappointed and upset and a bit sad:(", "author": "Shirley M."}

So, for our first visit my friends chose the Pabellon (skirt steak, black beans, plantains) and I had the Pepeada (chicken salad w/ avocado). They were each $5. \n\nMy friends shared the Pabellon since I don't eat beef. But anyway, they both really liked it and thought it was good. We all shared my chicken one and we all agreed that it was HELLA good! There was just something about the creaminess of the avocado that went really well with the chicken. \n\nWe came back for a second round and this time my friends had the Pernil (pulled pork, sliced tomatoes, avocado) and I had the Caribe (black beans, cheese, plantains). We also got a side order of plantains and it came out to $15. \n\nBy this time, we were already stuffed after making a few pit-stops at the other food trucks but we just had to get more arepas. My friends thought that the pork one was ok. They liked the steak one better. My vegetarian one was pretty good. I loved the black beans! The plantains were alright.\n\nOverall, this was by far our favorite food stand amongst the others we tried. Hopefully, we can make it out to the Mission to visit the actual restaurant and indulge in the full size arepas!", "author": "Fallon P."}

Well it's very sour. Ok how about the Mango? Apparently she thought there was nothing wrong with the mango so I was allowed to order that. Then I ordered the Empanadas. Got my table number and found a seat.\n\nThen I waited. And waited. The table next to me gets their food but when it's delivered they say \"we ordered empanadas too, are they coming?\" The waitress says oh yes I'll get them. I think to myself, \"uh-oh, wonder why there are delays for empanadas\". More waiting. The people who were directly ahead of me in line get their food. 10 minutes go by. I'm still waiting. \n\nFinally my food is delivered. And what is in the top of the little container of guacamole? Right in the center like its a garnish? A hair! Gross!!! I say excuse me but the waitress was already gone. Seriously? Ok so I walk back up to counter and very nicely and quietly say to her \"there's a hair in the guacamole\". I said it quietly because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's appetite, mistakes happen, right? So she hands the plate to the cook and again walks off. The cook is standing there looking like he doesn't know what to do. So for 5 more minutes I'm standing there, politely, waiting for her to explain to him what's wrong. Did I mention that no one has apologized to me for the hair in my food? For the long wait? For the fact that I had to bring the hairy guacamole back up to them since she couldn't wait one second after delivering my food to hear me immediately say there was something wrong? Finally she speaks to the cook and then she starts asking me if I want a different kind of sauce? I say \"I just want some guacamole without any hair in it\" and then she gives me attitude \"Well, I'm just asking\" like she's the one who should be offended. Finally they give me a new container of guacamole and hand the original plate back to me. So, finally I have my food and I go to sit back at my table where my Mango juice was and there are 2 guys sitting at my table and my juice is gone? What the heck. Ok all my patience and politeness and willingness to put up with disappointment is used up. And did I mention that I'm 7 months pregnant. That waiting a long time to eat when I'm hungry is very hard on me? That squeezing in and out of tight spaces and waddling up to the counter multiple times is uncomfortable for me? The guys at the table were mildly apologetic and offered to buy me another juice but I was just so upset. If the waitress had paid attention to the plate before she delivered me hair garnished guacamole, if she had waited one second before she dropped the plate on my table and ran away, if she had told the cook what was wrong immediately instead of dropping the plate in front of him and walking away, the guys wouldn't have assumed the table was free. \n\nI made it known that I was not happy but still no apology, no service, not even an inquiry as to what was wrong. I've never been treated so rudely before. You lost a customer today Pica Pica. I gave you many chances to make it right. I forgave you multiple transgressions. But enough was enough. I hope you stop pay attention to the food you serve before sending it out of the kitchen with hair perched on top.

Arepa is a native sort of bread made of ground maize (or flour), water, and salt which is fried or grilled into a thick bread. It can be topped or filled with meat, eggs, tomatoes, salad, cheese, shrimp, or fish depending on the meal. \n\nthe selection of the Arepa's at Pica Pica is pretty simple...6 different Arepa's to choose from with either white corn or yellow corn (the yellow corn is sweeter and tastes EXACTLY LIKE the sweet corn ball they make at Chevy's with every entree) all the Arepa's are priced at 8.95...small enough where you could easily eat two, but still big enough that you will feel guilty and full after.\n\nthe best way to describe biting into an Arepa is like eating a sandwich stuffed into a tamale...not exactly the life changing experience i was dreaming of or hoping for, but still good enough for me to drive over the bay bridge and look 30 minutes for parking to come get my Arepa fix next time around.", "author": "Kyu L."}

The maize shell was just crumbling and falling apart. and it ended up being a fork-and-knife dish instead of a sandwich.\n\nMy search for a great NorCal arepa will have to continue..", "author": "Kazu O."}

This negative review is about customer service, not about lacking the ingredients to complete an order.\n\nToday I walked to Pica Pica Maize Kitchen in the Mission and ordered the \"Pulled Pork Pernil\" platter that comes with \"Tostones.\" I saw the plate come in without the tostones but waited hoping that the lady helping me today would bring them later. After a few minutes with no sight of tostones coming my way, I asked the lady about the tostones. She looked at my plate and pointing at two plantain chips said, \"Those are your tostones.\" I explained that those were in fact \"plantain chips\" and that I knew that tostones were different because I had them before. (They're thick fried discs of smash plantains).\n\nShe laughed and said, \"No, these are real tostones. I know what you think tostones are but these are what we call tostones.\" I then explained that this could not be true because \"Plantain Chips\" were already mentioned/listed as \"Plantain Chips\" in another part of their menu. She then laughed again and said: \"These are what we call 'tostones' is just that where you are from, they are called different. What we called plantain chips are these 'Taro Chips,' I'll bring you some for you to see.\" A minute later, she produced a plate of - what do you know? - \"Taro Chips.\" At these point, I was feeling a bit insulted by her attempt to fool me with this poor customer service strategy of deceit and just said: \"No, I think that those are Taro Chips, from the Taro Root, which are also listed on you menu as 'Taro Chips.'\"\n\nSomewhere in the list of customer service rules, there has to be a bullet point that says: Do not lie to customers to cover shortcomings on your services.

Gluten free lure aside - I freakin' LOVE corn based ANYTHING.  Texture and taste of it wins my stomach over.  I was all for trying out this restaurant with my friends who suggested it!  And, I'm so happy I went with great company that treats eating out as an experience rather than a necessity, 'cause you know we DID get a little bit of (almost!) everything!\n\nI've never heard of an arepa before!  It was a lovely, light corn flavor with a good portion of undressed mixed greens to balance out the sandwich-like dish.  The aioli really enhanced the essence of it.  Had it with the #7 Pernil pulled pork, and I'm still smitten!  Reading other reviews from native Venezuelans left me curious to try an authentic, legit Venezuelan spot somewhere in the Mission to see and compare.  \n\nWhat I loved even more than the arepa were my amigas' cachapas!  Man, oh, man, was that corn flavor more evident!  The word \"pancake\" does not properly describe what I had chomped on, in my opinion.  The taste of this crunch-tastic dish was to die for.  I would definitely come back for this!\n\nWe also shared their hefty-sized chupe soup - really good for the rainy weather that raged on outside of this small, cozy restaurant.  The empanadas and yucca fries were great, as well.  For the empanadas, it was all about the sauces for me.  Slash ya gotta get at those plantains y queso fresco!  We had it with the tamarind sauce, but I'm sure the black bean one would have suited it more.\n\nAnyway, I shall be returning, and am very sad that my home in the Sunset is not eligible for delivery for this lovely place.  I'm always munching around in the Mission, but always for get there are some sweet spots on the other side of 16th, going towards 15th!  If you're around there, check it out.  It gets really crazy up in there, though.  So, if you don't want to wait for a spot, go during non-meal hours.", "author": "Nadia D."}

Why, yes. I think I will. \n\nI walked in, and was greeted enthusiastically. The guy was happy to explain any of the items to me, and I chose to do the lunch special, which comes with an arepa and a side. I had the arepa Pernil (pulled pork, avocado) and the yucca fries (which comes with one of a variety of sauces). \n\nI received my to-go order, carefully wrapped and stapled in a brown paper bag. I carefully contained my excitement (which is unusual) and walked to Dolores park. \n\nI opened the bag like a gleaming Christmas present, and went to town. Because I had already eaten a meal, I promised myself I'd only eat a portion. The corn of the arepa was thick and tender, so wonderful. I thought the pork could have had a little more flavor, but I was happy with the amount of avocado stuffed in there. \n\nbut..the best part... wait for it... the yucca fries!! crunchy in a light, fluffy way, I just had never had anything like it. they crunched a little and then melted in my mouth. I used the aioli dipping sauce from my sandwich and I was in heaven. needless to say, i didn't end up saving any for later. \n\nThe lunch special was a good deal, but otherwise they may be a little pricey for such a small portion.\n\nP.S.- the place also has empanadas and i REALLY wanted to try a chorizo and potato one. they look excellent, so, make a note to leave room in your belly :)", "author": "Rose K."}

I liked it enough to choose it amongst the plethora of amazing eateries in the city to bring my mom to for lunch today. The previous times a young, enthusiastic girl worked at the counter and was more than pleasant. But today we received awful service from the woman who was working the counter/cash register. She was not particularly friendly to begin with, but that was neither here nor there. After a REALLY long wait, at least 20 minutes or more, we got SOME of our food. She placed my and my husbands plates in front of us and then walked away, didn't even mention the other plate. I wondered if she forgot we had a third entree. My mom likes to eat lunch by like 12 noon latest and at this point is was going on 1PM. I felt so sorry for her being hungry. To make matters worse, we all now had to stare at 2 plates of food for the next 5 minutes while we waited. I finally got up and approached the desk, where i was ignored by the woman for several minutes, then I finally just addressed her and said \"my mom drove an hour to come here with us for lunch today\" and she said \"your other plate is coming\" and walked away. She and the men working in the kitchen talked and laughed and flirted with each other for several minutes after that, nobody seemed to really be working. I observed them cook my mom's arepa start to finish during that time, they had either forgotten it or didn't care about serving us our plates on time. One man grabbed hands full of lettuce (with bare hands) and stood there, waving them around in gesture while talking to the woman before tossing them on plates, haphazardly. It was beyond insulting. All of the men in the kitchen were staring at me with critical looks on their faces, obviously dismayed at my impatience. Finally she came back and handed me a plate, which I had now stood there waiting for for several minutes. I told her \"you shouldn't serve two plates and leave one diner with no food\" in a non-confrontational manner. She responded callously \"the arepa takes longer to make that's why but I can get a manager if you want a discount or something\". COMPLETELY added insult to injury. I told her \"no, I don't need a discount, I just wish you had acted a little more graciously\". When I got back to my table she was blatantly bad-mouthing me to the guys in the kitchen, they were all looking at me, scoffing and visibly making negative remarks about me. There was absolutely not a drop of professionalism in that place today. FURTHERMORE if \"the arepa takes longer to cook\" (crock of BS) then you start cooking it first Einstein. There was about a 10 minute lapse between the first 2 plates and the 3rd. Unacceptable! Our food was completely cold and soggy by the time we ate it. I will never return. There are so many hard-working great people in this city looking for work, why employ these kinds of lazy, unintelligent, rude people at an otherwise great restaurant?\nFor the owner's reference: Our bill says \"Lucero H\" at the top.", "author": "Emma H."}

The spicy chicken was decent but the shredded pork had no flavor whatsoever. None of the sauces on the table made it any better b/c they were crappy too. What a disappointment. We didn't even order drinks and it was over $30. I would not go back even if it was free.", "author": "May G."}

We spend about $200 per visit for the 10-15 of us.\n\nTonight I was super lazy and wanted something quick and this place is right by my house.  I call the order in and ask them to sub rice for my salad.  When I get there I pay, and then I check my order and they've given me a small bit of rice with an empty spot where the salad (or extra rice is suppose to be). No big deal.  I kindly tell them the mistake and they inform me that rice is extra... I literally see these people every week and always order my food the same way and it's never been a problem.  Anyways, they straight up fought me on not giving me rice instead of my salad and I walked out for what will be the last time I ever eat there or order it for my company.  Apparently they don't know how much rice costs... Will for the 5cents it would have cost them (probably less then the cost of salad) to give me the rice the way I ordered it they've lost my buisness. They can kiss there $7200 a year I spend there for our company lunches there goodbye.  The worst part is they read the order back to me the way I ordered it over the phone. Hell I would have even paid for the extra rice if they really wanted me to... Just charge me for it when I'm paying for the rest of my food.

The arepa is the star item here, so I had to get that and the nachos looked pretty bomb in the pictures, so we ordered that as well.  \n\nI had the shredded beef arepa on white corn and the girlfriend had the spicy chicken on yellow corn.  The yellow corn dough is definitely much more flavorful and I will likely get my next arepa on that the next time I visit.  Both the chicken and beef were quite flavorful and you can't really go wrong with either option.  Be careful as these little sandwiches are deceivingly filling.\n\nThe nachos are a definite pass next time.  They are definitely Pica Pica's take on nachos and taste nothing like normal nachos.  They come with pulled pork, beans, guacamole, and cheese.  All served over taro chips.  Now the taro chips on their own are delicious, but making them into nachos is a mistake in my opinion.  I would rather just have them plain and served with the guacamole or some other dip instead.\n\nWe also tried the yucca fries.  These were crisp and delicious.  They come with a side of guacamole, which could use some salt.  But the fries themselves were cooked perfectly.  \n\nOverall a good experience and I would likely come back if I was in the area.

They also have a variety of different sauces on the tables for you to try, which included a spicy chipotle and some others.\n\nMy only complaint is that the corn pocket became very soggy as it soaked up all the ingredients, which made it mushy at the bottom. It was so soggy it ruptured, causing the ingredients to fall out. Pica Picas wants you to eat its arepas with your hands, but it can get really messy. Also, the price ($8.95) is pretty steep for such a small pocket, and at this location, the free fountain water tasted foul. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I tried it once, but it's just not worth the price, and I've since found a new job, which is not in the Mission.

I called and was told by the man who answered the phone to put in my order at 11:30 the day we needed it, which was the next day. So we planned the lunch and when I called at 11am to place the order, a woman told me that they only deliver catering and that requires two days notice. She said, several times in a combative way, that there was no way a man answered the phone the day before- only she answers the phone?- but then remembered that they had a new staff person who had been taking calls and had given me incorrect info. She told me they could still bring lunch to my office, which is 3/4 of a mile away from their store, if I ordered from Eat24 or Try Caviar or GrubHub. I tried Eat24 and the app said I could only order pick up from them. And then I was out of time to spend on this that day. \n\nMiscommunications are bound to happen, but at every turn they gave bad info.\n\nIf you are trying to order from here, have a back up plan and make sure you have time to deal with it.

Located in the Mission District of San Francisco, it serves up delicious Venezuela-style sandwiches made with corn breads and yummy fillings and side dishes. This is a gluten-free kitchen, so it is safe for those with Celiacs, gluten-intolerence or gluten-sensitivitiy to dine here. Even if you are not among one of those, you can still go there to enjoy something a little different than usual.\n\nBased on the Yelp reviews, this place can get busy and a seat could be hard to get, so I arrived there early. I guess due to it was weekend, actually there were plenty of spots available! I informed that we will have a group of about 15 people for lunch, so the young guy at the counter suggested that I just pull a couple tables together to reserve for the group.\n\nFor appetizers, I tried the yaca fries and sweet plantains.  Maybe it is just me, but I honestly think the yaca frieds taste much better than the regular potato fries! The sweet plantains look like bananas, but taste more like sweet potatoes, with a firmer texture and perhaps sweeter in taste. It is filling too so you definitely want to share with your dine partners.\n\nI also ordered the \"chicken salad with Guasacaca (creamy avocado) in a grilled sweet corn bread. The portion of this \"Maize'wich\" is so huge, I could only eat half of it at one sitting, and later ate the 2nd half for dinner! The corn bread tasted fresh and it actually holds up well to contian all the heavny stuffings inside!\n\nFor dessert, I got \"Alfajor\", which are light biscuits filled with \"dulce de leche\" and rolled in coconut flakes. I love anything coconut, so as soon as I saw the word \"coconut\", I picked up one bag of the goodies from the counter.\n\nThey also serve gluten-free beers. And another Maize'wich that is popular here is the Pelu'a Aprepa (shredded skirt stake with chedder cheese in a grilled corn flour flat bread).

I absolutely LOVE corn, so naturally I'd be super excited to try a self-proclaimed maize kitchen.  \n\nHowever, after eating here last night, I was really disappointed. I came here with one of my favorites and we ended up ordering 4 things: a pabellon arepa, a pabellon maize'wich, garlic Yucca fries w/aioli, and tajadas (sweet plantains). \n\nThe cool thing about this place is that it enables you to personalize your order a bit. You start with picking one maize bread (arepa, maize'wich, or cachapa) and then continue on to choose a filling (too many options to list). The one we both opted for, pabellon, consisted of shredded beef, sweet plantains, black beans, and queso fresco. Sounds awesome, ya? Well, it wasn't :( \n\nThe primary culprit preventing them from attaining awesomeness? THE PLANTAINS. \n\nWhere do I begin? The plantains were horrible. Both the tajadas and the ones tucked into our pabellon dishes. There aren't very many things I like to eat soft and mushy; however, plantains are one of the few. I like 'em soggy, wet, moist, and sweet. But the plantains here were dry, hard, and too oily. No amount of cheese, meat, or sauce could mask their nasty taste. Sadness! \n\nThe one thing I truly enjoyed about our meal were the Yucca fries. These babies were delicious. Especially with the garlic smothered all over them. The aioli dipping sauce served on the side was pretty bomb too.  \n\nIf it weren't for the plantains, I think I would have enjoyed my meal a lot more. The maize bread was pretty good and the shredded beef was well seasoned. I'd say, this place has some potential. I like the concept of Pica Pica, and I hear the one in Napa is much better.

Think of a cross between a pita pocket and an English muffin made out of a corn tortilla filled with all kinds of savory goodness you can imagine. I tried the \"Clasica\" (ham and cheese) and the \"La Shuli\" (black beans and salsa served with side of guacamole). I also impulse ordered the beer sangria.\n\nThe arepas are fresh so they take a little bit to be ready. Good thing I had my beer sangria! It tasted peachy. I'm not sure what they put in there but the sign said \"made to order\" so I doubt it's something they have sitting around like real sangria. It's a refreshing drink. They also have fruit juices and lemonade that they make fresh.\n\nMy arepas were brought to my table and they were looking good. They came out hot off the grill or whatever cooking surface they use. \n\nI tried the La Shuli first. It was good but I was a little underwhelmed. The filling on this bad boy is really black beans and pico de gallo type salsa. The guacamole really saved it. This one was also a little difficult to handle and got messy quickly because the beans and salsa are kind of runny.\n\nNext I tried the Clasica. This one was my favorite. The ham was called deviled ham, but it's not like devil's food or deviled eggs. It's just good. The cheese was melty just the way I like. It was so good and I didn't want it to end. \n\nThese are pretty filling and I only ate about half of each. They are good for sharing.\n\nThere is so much more of the menu I want to try out.

So when I heard about this place, I was intrigued.\n\nPica Pica lets you customize your \"corn-y\" concoction any way you like it. First, you pick your outer \"shell\": arepa, maizewich or sweet corn. Each option is slightly sweeter than the previous one. Then, you pick from several filling combinations. \n\nMy favorite is the maizewich #7, which comes with pulled pork, avocado and tomato. It's savory, just a little sweet and really filling. The #2 is my husband's favorite because it just has beef and cheese. I love their garlic yucca fries - the pika'chup sauce that comes with it is really good, like a spicy ketchup. They even serve sangrias here, which are surprisingly strong.\n\nTheir weekday (noon - 3pm) lunch special is a pretty good deal: for $7.99 you get a medium arepa with one side.\n\nSo far, I am still a fan.

Here's the lowdown: if you like soft corn cakes, avocado, plantains and aioli, you'll dig it. Their main offerings are arepas and cachapas, which are identical other than their shape (one looks like a taco, the other looks like a burger). There are some meat and veggie options, but there won't be many permutations here. The corn is sweet, the aioli is good, and the yuca fries are a highlight.

My shrimp ceviche with taro chips were also good. Plantain chips and regular cooked sweet plantains, both amazing as well. The huge plate of taro chip nachos that passed by looked so good that it made me wonder why I didn't order that. \n\nSo why the 3 stars?\nIt was just 2pm on a Sunday and they were out of A LOT of stuff. No more yuca fries, no more agua frescas, what did they serve between then and closing time at 10pm?? They forgot to give me the taro chips that were supposed to come with the ceviche; I only got the side order of taro and plantain chips together.

She asked, \"You didn't take your number?\" I said, \"I did! But the server took it back!\" We laughed and she apologized and it was all good because I liked the way she smiled and because if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have had an orgasm in my mouth from the sweet corn arepa mixed with sweet plantains and savory shredded beef. Alternate by taking a bite of the arepa and then a bite of the salad on the taro chip to make the party even more wild! \nOh!

So we decided to come to Pica Pica because I happened to see it featured on the food network. Immediately I was intrigued by the \"arepa\". So when we walked into the restaurant it was very crowded. Luckily a table cleared up prettt quickly for us. The restaurant itself is very small but quite nice. The girl at the register wasn't very friendly. She looked flustered. I ordered the beef pabellon arepa. And as a starter we ordered the yucca fries. Our food took about 20 minutes to arrive. So, the yucca fries were very nice...crunchy and hot. They came with an ok guacamole. My arepa was quite flavorful and piping hot. It came with a tiny amount of coleslaw on the side. \n\nBottom line: good food, not so friendly staff.

The yellow corn maize-wich especially since the insides of the corn patty are still gooey and warm.  The fillings all worked together too; a good balance of sweet and savory (contrast of the plantains and queso fresco).

None of us had had Venezuelan fast food & I'd only eaten an arepa once (hardly making me the expert in the group.) \n\nTheir menu is all about decisions, decisions. First pick your vessel: arepa, cachapa or maize'wich then you pick from ten different fillings. For those more visually inclined, there are examples of each maize bread & some fillings behind glass at the counter.\n\nI chose an arepa ($7.99, grilled white corn flour cake) with the Perico filling (scrambled eggs, tomatoes, onions & cheese) which was a good sized sandwich. I liked the mix of ingredients & the fact that the arepa was a combination of crispy on the outside & softer on the other side. My only complaint is that the eggs were a bit overcooked. Our table shared plantains & yucca fries ($3.99 each, both of which were perfectly fried & therefore, a huge hit with our party.)\n\nThe bill for three came out to about $15 per person.

Don't take my word for it.\n\nThe three main types of corn/maize breads are the Venezuelan arepa (grilled corn flour cake), cachapa (sweet corn pancake) or maize'wich (corn bread cakes).

It seemed too sweet.  The pepeada filling is a creamy mixture of skinless chicken, avocado, red onions and herbs - imagine chicken mixed with a mild guacamole.  I wish it had a little crunch (more red onions?) and more fresh herbs.  It was bigger than I expected and generously stuffed with pepeada.

When we walked in, it was smaller than I expected but I loved the big windows.\n\nWe ordered the nachos pica pica which was humongous!!  and the spicy chicken arepas which was I think a decent size for one on the white pocket.  It was so light and fluffy...I think next time I wanna try the yellow one though.  The arepas came with a nice little salad.  The nachos though I think were the star!!  It was so gooodddd!!  Taro chips crispy (though bottom layers were quite soaked with cheese and guac and beans), pulled pork plentiful and juicy, and the guac (i wished i had more)....mmmm....\n\nDefinitely a good place for fast friendly venezuelan food.", "author": "Nikkie P."}

I was looking forward to the experience, but was left disappointed.\n\nIf I had to sum up Pica Pica's food in two words, it would be \"one note\".  There wasn't enough contrast in the perico maize'wich or empanadas to motivate me to finish my food.  Just a note, Pica Pica, a little acid goes a long way.  A crunch would have been nice as well, for texture.  Fresh onions would have done wonders for my maize'wich.  The grilled maize itself wasn't impressive enough to make me want to return for another.  \n\nI know the maize is supposed to be the star and unifying theme at Pica Pica, but I would like to nominate the cooking oil.  Everything was greasy, like it was cooked at the wrong temperature, so the oil saturated the food instead of crisping it.  Although this place is gluten-free, the copious amount of oil in the food produce the same result, upset tummy, as if I were eating gluten laden food.", "author": "Sandy K."}

The arepas were not cooked well (raw) so the \"masa\" stuck to the roof of our mouths. The pabell\u00f3n filling was bland and not even remotely like the Venezuelan pabell\u00f3n flavor. The spicy chicken was okay, but it was not a Venezuelan dish. It also was super expensive for being a self service place. There is no way we will go back to this place.

The black bean spread, queso fresco, and guasacaca sauce were a nice addition creating a nice deep savory experience.  \n\nThe pork pernil was rather disappointing. The pork was very tender so I was pretty excited, but it was very bland.  I tried it on its own and got no flavor.  The garlic aioli and/or pica'pun (don't know what that is?) had a nice kick that I liked.  There was perhaps a bit too much aioli for my taste.  The avocado was fresh and creamy which was nice.\n\nI haven't had too many arepas in my life, but I thought the actual arepa itself - corn cakes - were a bit tough and chewy.  \n\nOverall, I like what they're doing and would want to come back to try a cachapa and their yucca fries, because I love me some yucca fries.\n\nAlso, one arepa is plenty for one person.

The staff there knows what's up and they ask you the questions you need to get the perfect combo on, however, the line gets super long because there is an option for nearly every aspect of the dish. Thanks to smart staff this is made somewhat simpler but the menu is crazy confusing!\n\nStep 1: Identify what meat you want. There are two chicken options but one is more of a chicken salad, which wasn't feeling too healthy to me. \n\nStep 2: Based on that they can tell you which type of Maize wrapper you'll want to get. I got the Cachapa which is pretty sweet but that's how i roll. There is also more of a flat bread type option which is less deep fried looking.\n\nStep 3: choose a side like empanadas, and first select a salsa. Then they can tell you which meats go best with it since there are several filling options.\n\nSee what I am saying? There's an obvious flow to the menu that you don't get from reading it. Thanks for helping me staff members, the menu board was a hot mess! :)\n\nFood wise I felt like everything tasted the same to me and my husband agreed. It had a very \"house of same sauce\" feel to it, but the good news is that it was tasty! If they had a fresh salsa bar or some kind of sauce to add to things to change it up that would rock, the empandas were really bland without the sauce and I think my main dish would have been better served with some kind of accoutrement.

Boy, was I excited when I found out that Pica Pica was opening it's doors here in SF. They were supposed to have opened on 5/10 however there were some issues that delayed their grand opening and so that didn't end up happening for another 5 days. \n\nBeing that it was their grand opening it was a bit surprising there were PLENTY of seats available and virtually NO LINE when we got there. We had been stalking their website so we kind of had it figured out what we were going to order. We were absolutely famished and wanted to try out almost everything off the menu but settled on ordering the following between the two of us:\n\n-Pabellon - Arepa filled with shredded skirt steak, black beans, sweet plantains, cheese\n-Perico - Arepa filled with scrambled eggs, onions, diced tomatoes and cheese (this would be perfect as breakfast)\n-La Shuli - Arepa filled with black beans, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and a side of their version of guacamole \"guasacaca\"\n-A Maize'wich\n-Yucca Fries with garlic aioli dip (a must-order!)\n-A bottle of pale ale\n\nIt did taste a bit \"healthier\" (less greasy, less starchy) than the arepas from Caracas in NYC (I miss my freshly blended banana shake with cinnamon sprinkled on top) as Pica Pica boasts their wheat and gluten free menu which makes me feel better as we stuffed our faces here. I think for our next visit, I'll settle down with just one arepa. With a side of the yucca fries, TWO arepas each per person was certainly pushing it.", "author": "Esther A."}

I found the food here to be totally fine, but pretty disappointing, because a lot of it SOUNDED good, but from a small sampling, I have my doubts that any of it would be exciting. Definitely not as exciting as it could be, anyway.\n\nI had the pernil arepa. It had sizable chunks of avocado and slices of tomato, a mess of pork, and the garlic aioli on the side. The pork was too salty, which the avocado and tomato slightly, but insufficiently, balanced out. Overall the individual tastes were fine but the ingredients didn't particularly come together. This was even more evident in the pabellon - skirt steak, plantains, black beans and cheese makes a really nice plate of food, so you can see how it might make a nice sandwich - well, it doesn't. It's better to disassemble the whole thing and eat it separately although, as noted, the chili pepper on the menu more realistically designates only that it's been cooked with a pepper, as it's not spicy at all.\n\nThe yuca fries seemed to be entirely \"friedness\" with no evident vegetable.

This is the type of place where I ate like a cerdo and still feel like I didn't scratch the surface of the menu.  Some choices are much heartier than others so keep that in mind when considering budget or, like me, how to maximize the number of dishes you can try.\n\nPabell\u00f3n: This filling rocks since it gives you an arepa sized sampling of the tender slow cooked beef, hearty black beans, sweet plantains and that squeaky white cheese.  The beef was full of slow cooked, stringy goodness!\n\nPepeada: I usually associate this as the signature Venezuelan arepa since it's at the top of the menu at every arepa joint I go to.  It's usually called \"Reina Pepiada\" and it's usually a lot better than here!  My least favorite item I tried, I found the avocado too mushy and the chicken too bland.\n\nCl\u00e1sica: I had to order this because of the same sick curiosity that makes me order Spam from menus.  If was definitely better than that Underwood brand with the tiny red devil mascot.  However, despite the deviling, I still felt it was pretty bland and a little heavy on the mayo.  Probably best to enjoy this between a firm maize'wich since the mushy texture wouldn't go well with a soft cachapa.\n\nArepa: I wasn't a fan of how they cut the arepa, pretty much in half so it acted like bread around a sandwich.  I prefer the technique of a small incision in the top and stuffing it like a pita.  Semantics aside, the arepas was good.  Grainy texture with nice griddle marks on the outside.  Freshly made for my order.\n\nMaize'wich: These reminded of me those \"mozzarepas\" from street fairs.  It lies in firmness between the arepa and the cachapa.  The mixture of firm, yet chewy makes it perfect for any of the really pasty filings.\n\nCachapa: My favorite corn vessel!  Like a delicate corn pancake or corn omelette encasing your filling.  Absolutely love how there are fresh corn kernels mixed amongst the maize flour.\n\nTostones: Normally I get my fill of tostones at Cuban restaurants, but San Francisco is sorely lacking Cuban joints so I had to get them here.

I was in Berkeley one morning looking for a place to have breakfast, a gluten free breakfast. I wasn't in the mood to tell everyone about Gluten Free, Celiac, cross contamination, etc.. and a quick search on my iPhone gave me answer. Drive to San Francisco: PICA PICA MAIZE KITCHEN... Wait, what? AREPAS? like the ones I had in Venezuela... not quite.\n\nLooking for parking in the Mission in San Francisco can be as difficult as getting a quality service at Chile Lindo (a few blocks from Pica Pica), in other words, park and walk or simply take Bart. \n\nThe place is small, simple and clean.( be aware of the waiting time doing a line to order and to get a table) The staff is friendly but want you to know what you want to order by the time you get to the counter. The menu is front of you, so take a moment and decide...   Want a recommendation? Try the Veggy Arepa, griddle seared Tofu strips, cheese ,fried plantain and avocado topped with a thick sour cream and chipotle sause to die for!.\n\nThis place was able to master the art of arepas, a popular street food in Venezuela, giving them a new fresh spin more on the gourmet side, these are definitely not your mamma's  arepas, these are bold fun and modern (not cheap but superb!)\n\nOne arepa will be enough to satisfy you, they are big and by the time you pay and finish eating you'll be content with the price/quantity ratio!", "author": "Mr. T."}

I had enough food for 2.5 meals. \n\n-Empanadas: YUMMY! More of a lightly fried/crispy exterior than a flaky crust. For fillings, I liked them in this order (1) Morena (2) Tilapia (3) Guiso\n-Cachapas with Pabellon: Cachapa is a sweeter corn pancake. I liked it but maybe too sweet for a savory type filling. Pabellon is tasty. Next time I will try the Maize'wich.\n-Yuca Fries: Lightly fried, good sized wedge cuts. \n-Dipping sauces! YES! I had the salsa/ketchup and an aioli. Both are delicious for dipping anything!\n\nEmpanadas were my favorite. The empanadas are smaller but with 3 pieces, it can be filling. I want to try other sandwich combos.

We had a sampler with three different types and they were quite good.  We had a Pabellon and Palu Arepas and both were very good.  We also had the Yuca Fries which were a nice treat.

Unfortunately, value and portion size don't quite match its outsized reputation; too much for the light eater in our small party and too little for those of us with a healthy appetite. Nevertheless, Pica Pica certainly deserves a visit at least once for the arepas, which are their unique grilled flatbread sandwiches stuffed with slow-cooked meats, and for vegetarians, tofu. Particularly notable is the perfectly complementary textures of the arepas- crispy and flavorfully char-grilled on the outside and soft, starchy and salty cornmeal cooked just right inside. The fresh oregano, garlic aioli, and copious helpings of artfully sliced avocado make them nearly worth $8.95, although the curtido is shamefully plain as a side dish. One suggestion to the cooks would be to let the curtido marinate longer, as well as add more fresh herbs and vinegar to kick up the flavor a notch. The drinks were expensive but fresh, with a taste reminiscent of fruity melted popsicles (the Sangria was tasty but don't order it if you want to feel happier - I had to ask if it had alcohol, there was so little in it). For dessert, be sure to try the flan which is bathed in thick and buttery caramel, although there being no spoons anywhere in the vicinity meant no one could take pleasure in the confectionary soup so delicious one might skinny dip into a pool of its fatty-lusciousness. \n\n     The atmosphere was quite nice, as the the mission street atmosphere overflowed in through the widely partitioned window, giving us the feeling of being both inside and outside, while allowing us to share in the scent of pizza from a restaurant next door. The music was too clubby for our tastes and certainly too much old-school Nelly Furtado for one sitting. Less pop music and more cultural musical treasures from Latina America, please.\n\n     All in all, I would give it three and a half starts until they start giving the  sides more attention and culinary thought, and either drop the price of the drinks or up the alcohol content. The atmosphere neither hurt nor helped although the customer service was just fine, no complaints as the food was brought in a timely and friendly manner. Will we be going back? Maybe, but only after trying our hand at some home-cooked arepas first.", "author": "Peter F."}

The other half had a sudden onset of N/V, D (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea). The sweetness to all the dishes was a bit extra. The delicious balance between savory and sweetness was nonexistent.

My clamberponding proved fruitful this time. When we got there there was no line and our food was brought out quickly. It's a walk-in restaurant and you pay first. The menu had so many wonderful options. We each got the chicken arepas and they were delicious. There's not much to say that the other reviewers haven't already said.

The beans had no taste, the shredded beef fell short on flavor/spice, and I was expecting more of a sweeter taste from the plantain. :( To me, everything was just bland and saturated in oil. I had to constantly overuse their sauces to compensate the flavor my areap was lacking. (The sauces were pretty darn good). My husband had the Spicy Chicken Catira- in which fell short to his expectations as well - lack of flavor/greasy. I expected a lot more from this place granted all the amazing reviews it received.

The Gilt deal really wasn't worth it as we got far too much food for two people, more than we would ever normally order, while overall not even saving that much money. However, the food was pretty good. My favorite was the Beef Pabellon Cachapas. The thick corn crepe was both savory and sweet while the sweet plantains and beef complemented each other nicely. The Pulled Pork Pernil Platter on the other hand wasn't anything special. The pulled pork was pretty tasteless and the sides didn't do much to bring in any flavor. The Sangria was super different than anything I'd ever tried before- lots of different fruits blended together including passion fruit! Mmmm....BUT it was so sweet that drinking more than a glass made me feel like I was going to get a sugar hangover! \n\nThe BEST part of this whole experience was the Yuca Beignets. Usually when you bite into a beignet it's like biting into a soft, airy cloud. These, however, were super dense and sweet- amazing texture and absolutely delicious!

Not a bitter, spit-it-out, what-have-I-done disappointment. But a disappointment nonetheless.\nThe place itself is cute. Small but we went there mid-afternoon and it wasn't crowded. The service was friendly but I do take note that my friend ordered a side salad with his arepa and got served the arepa and the dessert but the salad came only once we were almost done (we did get reimbursed for that).\nThe main disappointment for me was the food. When the small coleslaw-type salad (with cilantro, onion carrots and such) on the side is the highlight you know it wasn't a great meal. I had a beef pabellon arepa and I didn't care for it. Hear me out, I don't know what it is supposed to be like so maybe they did it perfectly authentic and I just don't like arepas. But the textures were all wrong. Everything was mushy. The plantains, the arepa shell, the beans and that shredded beef that I really didn't like. It needed some texture to be enjoyable to eat. The mush turned out to be off-putting after a few bites. And the flavor were unremarkable. I tasted mostly the beans. Which wasn't bad but ... Meh.\nAnd don't get me started on the yuca fries. Now again maybe that's what they are supposed to be but the gross hardened part I found in one of them completely turned me off and the fry itself was too thick and dry to be enjoyable. It wasn't a fry, it was mostly yuca flesh.\nMy friend didn't care too much for his similar order but gave thumbs up to his coconut flan for what it is worth.\nI also ordered a coconut-lime fresca which was a very interesting and original flavor so points for that. But as a drink, the \"originality\" got old pretty fast and I had to resort to water by the end of the meal.\nSo I give it three stars. Not four or five because I didn't like it and won't be back. But not two or one because disappointing as it was, nothing was bad or shocking about the meal or the restaurant. I just don't get the hype. Well, at least, we didn't pay the Castro Pica Pica prices that are almost all $1.50 to $2 higher than the ones at this location.", "author": "Dorian S."}

It was like bait for a fish.\nWhence the desired dish was on my plate I magnanimously forgot the paens and started munching through but Lo and behold, I saw something different. Sitting in one corner of my plate was a piece of meat. Okay being a congenital vegetarian I could have raised a hue and cry but I usually let it be and this is one of the places where I was made a fool of.

I was a bit surprised at it being a counter-order kind of restaurant, but I don't mind. The seating is really nice inside and pretty roomy despite appearances. I had no idea what kind of food to expect actually, it was sort of a random lunch decision for me and my friend and thank goodness it paid off! We both got arepas - she got the vegetariana and I the pulled pork and they were both VERY different but IMO equally delicious! The pulled pork meshes with the garlic aioli and arepa in an incredible way - it ALMOST (almost almost... not quite) makes the chunky avocado superfluous. My friend's vegetariana was also amazing but with really different flavors, naturally, since hers had tofu and grilled plantains. I thought it was superb as well, but not comparable to the pulled pork if you're really looking for a huge kick of flavor. Ooh, and the yucca fries!! This is a can't miss. It was pretty similar to the one's I had at Limon but the sauces are bit more standard - garlic aioli, spicy/tangy mustard, and a barbeque (which are found on the table, so they don't exactly come with the yucca fries... they're for anything, really).\n\nAll in all, we left with super stuffed and super happy bellies.

Sure, their main ingredient is corn, but I love that they have gone the extra step to run their kitchen gluten-free. This means that I can eat everything on the menu, a rare and wonderful feeling.\n\nThey specialize in sandwiches made on your choice of gluten-free corn bread--you can opt for cachapa (a sweetcorn crepe of sorts), arepa (made from a ground corn dough), or the maize'wich, situated somewhere between the previous two as a sweetcorn bread. \n\nIt doesn't really matter what you get, because it's all very tasty. You have an array of hearty fillings to choose from, with solid meat, veggie and vegan offerings. Basically, pretty much anyone can eat here--though I did once manage to dine there with a friend who's allergic to chili. She enjoyed it, but as you might guess in a joint that does Venezuelan grub, we had to be pretty careful.\n\nOn the spectrum of San Francisco dining, Pica Pica definitely counts as cheap and cheerful. They have plenty of gluten-free drinks (with alcohol and without), and you can also grab soup, empanadas and delicious yuca fries. \n\nAny considerations of price must take into account the fact that you will not be hungry for another day or two after eating there--it's incredibly filling fare, replete with plantains, beans and avocado.

I wasn't very disappointed since there are options to replace what I ordered . . .  let me explain:\n\nThis restaurant has 3 types of \"breads\" to choose from, all corn based.  There's a corn bread, a dough corn flat bread, and a corn pancake.  I ordered the pork w/ avocado and tomato on the corn pancake.  The sandwich had potential, but I think the sweetness of the pancake (which was advertised, so I was warned) threw me off.   I heard the corn bread is THE best, but of course they were out of it.  So sad.  So if I were to return, I probably wouldn't choose the corn pancake.\n\nThe sides they offer are yucca fries, fried green plantains, and fried sweet plantains.  We had the fried sweet plantains which were served with a spicy dipping sauce and garnished with what I think may be queso fresco.\n\nTowards the end of my meal I felt like some hot chocolate, but of course they were out of that too.  Actually, we were informed that the machine was broken.\n\nFinally as to service.  Not the friendliest of service.  She was kind of just going throw the motions of assisting the guests.  The beers we ordered, several times, were poured for us about 5-10 minutes after the fact, yet we saw her pour beer for other patrons on the spot as they ordered.

This last visit put me over the edge... LOVE their food but I won't send people there anymore. I was running late for an event at the theatre two blocks over and thought ahead enough to call a take out order in. The girl answered and then put me on hold -- for the entire 12 minutes it took me to drive across town-- I literally walked into the restaurant listening to her chatting with someone else through my phone. Spoke to a guy (who turned out to be the manager) about my situation, and could he make something while I wait in line to pay? He was absolutely unapologetic, tried to talk me into ordering something I didn't want that was easier to make, and then sent me to stand in line. As I was finally arriving to the front of the line the same cashier that had put me on hold (and not once in this time looked at the phone to see I was no longer on hold) she just walked away to take care of someone else. I would have appreciated her at least saying, \"sorry, I'll be right with you.\" Finally got my food, and all the manager had to say about it all is \"we're busy.\" In summary, good food if you can handle the lack of customer service. And for them, give someone a heads up if you are going to put them on hold for almost 15 minutes so they can choose whether or not to call somewhere else.\n\n*On a food note, a agree with many other vegetarian posters that the tofu arepa is a bit bland.

The corn pancake was crispy but fluffy, the pork filling was tender and flavorful, and the aioli sauce that came with it complimented it extremely well. My girlfriend got the Arepas bread with the Pabellon filling. She was a little concerned about the sweetness of the plantains in the sandwich, but they ended up going very nicely with the bread and beef flavors. We got a side of Yuca fries, which were simply amazing. They were thick-cut wedges of Yuca potatoes, lightly fried so they were crispy on the outside and fluffy all the way through - I HIGHLY recommend giving them a try. I also had a glass of the passion fruit Sangria, and while I'm no expert on sangria, I found it to be extremely refreshing and original.\n\nThe only drawback we could find about this place is that it's very small -- there's probably only seating for about 20 people -- but since the ordering process is walk-up rather than sit-down we saw past this pretty quickly.

We drove from Alamo to San Francisco to eat at the restaurant.  The outer corn shell was supposed to be cripsy; however, it was soggy.  We could barely eat the Arepas because it was falling apart.  I mentioned this to the staff and they just blew us off.  I contacted the owner to express my concern.  She said that this happens sometimes if the batter isn't prepared properly or if the Arepas sits too long.  She apologized and offer to send me coupons to return and try it again.  There are 3 issues:\n1) I could have taken my brother to many great restaurants.  I'm a foodie and have dined at food trucks along with all the 3 Michelin restaurants in SF, Chicago and New York.\n2) I wasted gas by driving to SF.  There are great restaurants in the East Bay,\n3) The owner said she would send coupons and never did.  I called to remind her and she still didn't send the coupons.\nThis restaurant isn't managed properly.  The owner lacks customer service skills.

For $8 you choose between 3 different types of sandwiches & a handful of fillings. For $6 you get a tall skinny glass of sangria - which, to their credit, was 1 of the better sangrias I've had...not overly sweet. For an additional $3.25 (w/ purchase of sandwich) you can add a salad, soup or fries.\n\nI had the arepa with carita - chicken in their sofrito with cheddar cheese. The sofrito (mix of veges in sauce) had no flavor, didn't show up in the arepa at all except as a few diced onions & red sauce. The chicken was ok, the arepa was at least grilled very well. The cheddar cheese??? They threw shredded cheddar cheese (like the kind you buy in Safeway) on top of the chicken/sofrito mix right before serving me...so I had raw shredded cheddar cheese on top of bland chicken in sauce stuffed into an arepa. For $8.00. \n\nI also ordered - since I was getting a free arepa with purchase of sangria - a salad to go w/ my meal...bululu (? don't remember how to spell). Sounded delish on the menu board & the counter guy said it was pretty big. Since I wanted it for later, I asked for it To-Go. They brought me a rather tiny salad that was missing 2 ingredients! Glad I checked before leaving! I asked for the 2 ingredients - and really wanted to ask to beef up the salad overall, but didn't. The cook found the missing roasted corn but they apparently didn't have daikon sprouts...in fact, they didn't even know it went in the salad! The counter guy & cook looked in a fridge, apologized & said they must have run out. Right...or you never had it to begin with & don't know your menu too well. \n\nNot a place I'd go back consistently.

There are 3 kinds of maize breads: arepa, cachapa, and maize'wich.  I've heard that the arepa is a bit bland and dull so we went with their cachapa with catira filling and maize'wich with pabellon filling.  The pabellon was a perfect blend of tender shredded beef with sweet intermixed plantains.  I can imagine it would go well with any one of their bread options, but the maize'wich was definitely my high preference over the cachapa.  The maize'wich had a sweet taste with an outside crunch compared to the capacha which had a similar sweet taste but without the same kind of crunch on the outer layer.  I especially liked the fact that there were sweet kernals of corn in the breads; adding to the authenticity of what Pica Pica brings to its menu.\n\nI've heard some good things about their yuca fries so I'll definitely be back again for that and another maize'wich.

Similar to Kasa in its execution, Pica Pica offers Venezuelan food made quickly, with fresh ingredients, and for an extremely reasonable price.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean, friendly and efficient, with counter seating and a few communal tables.  You order at the counter, take a number and they bring you your food when it's ready.  Ordering is far less daunting when you look at the clear case below the register to see the difference between a Maize'Wich, an Arepa, and Cachapas.  \n\nWe tried a few things, starting with the Empanadas with Queso Fresco.  These are smaller than empanadas that you may have had before, and more crisp and textured.  You get 3 per order, so this is a great starter to share.\n\nThe main dishes are as Don H. said, about the size of a medium burrito, and filled to overflowing, so for $7.99 they are quite a bargain. We tried 3 Arepas:  Pepeada (chicken salad with creamy avocado), Pabellon (shredded skirt steak with plantains), and Catira (sauteed chicken).  My favorite by far was the Catira - the chicken had great flavor.  We also tried one Maize'wich, which is basically like eating a sandwich using cornmeal pancakes instead of bread - yum - the Pernil (pulled pork).  This one was the best by far, with moist meat with tons of flavor.\n\nThe sangria is $6 a glass, and for a big glass with tiny chopped apples in it - very refreshing.\n\nYou can eat well here for about $10-15, and I appreciate that a lot in these tight times. Plus everything on the menu is wheat and gluten-free, and there aren't too many places that can boast that.  This is not the place for your vegetarian or vegan friends if they want a lot of variety - only the cheese empanadas, the yucca fries, and the salad are not meat-based.

Thankfully, they also offer a glossary of words and a plexiglass cabinet so you can see what each of the items are. I'd never had Venezuelan food before that afternoon, so the vocabulary as well as the mix of sweet and savory was completely new to me.\n\nI ordered the #3 Arepas, a thick corn flour cake sandwiching skirt steak, black beans, plantains and cheese. The mix of sweet and savory was fantastic, though I was hoping it would be a bit more spicy than it ended up being. According to the glossary, this mix of black beans, plantains and steak is the national dish of Venezuela. Interesting...\n\nThe menu also said you could order a side of yuca, a soup or a salad for an extra $3 with your entree. The arepas looked small, so I underestimated how filling that would be and ordered a side salad to go along with it.\n\nThe sandwich was extremely filling because of the dense starchy nature of the corn cake. Side note: this place is completely gluten free, and you don't find many cornbreads that are 100% corn. Because of this dense corn, however, this place will fill you up despite their tiny looking portions. Even so, I am still so glad I bought the side salad because it was possibly one of the best, most interesting side salads I've ever had.\n\nIt looked standard at first: mixed baby greens, bell peppers, pineapple and jicama. But as I dug down I saw  some sweet roasted corn and some quinoa. The dressing was the bright yellow of Frenchs mustard, but it was a fabulous passion fruit vinaigrette. It was sweet, savory and best of all, different!\n\nThe service was friendly, the bathrooms were clean, and I was able to sit for an hour and a half with my leisurely lunch while reading The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. I will be back for some more delicious steak and plantains, and I will try the yuca in the futurel", "author": "Stephanie H."}

It was worth waiting in the long line.\n\nI've had an arepa and a cachapa. The cachapa is a gordita-thick sweet whole corn pancake that's used to wrap the insides taco-style. It's delicious. I like the sweetness against the fillings, which was pulled pork. The arepa is pita-like, but made out of corn. It's white and they grill them, so they're super hot and crispy, keeping your steak, beans, plaintains and cheese warm (this filling is called \"pabellon\").\n\nAnd the yucca fries! Oh the yucca fries. Fried to perfection. Really crispy brown outside, fluffy inside, comes with spicy ketchup. So filling, yet as your belly struggles you'll look at your plate sadly, thinking it would be such a waste not to finish them. I recommend sharing an order. Or sharing the sandwich-thingies with a friend and getting an order each of the fries.\n\nI'll have to come to the restaurant sometime when I'm not starving in a long fair line so I can try the chicken salad or the vegetarian options, which all looked really good.", "author": "Amy N."}

I ordered an arepa and yuca fries for a little over 12 bucks (no drink.... bad economy and I work in a non-profit=broke!).  \n\nIn regards to the food, the pulled pork is the more tastier of the dishes. I decided to try a pabellon the other day and was disappointed, as was my friend who ordered the same. It needed sauce or something. It also was listed as being spicy by the use of a chile pepper next to its name and if that is spicy, well, spicy went on vacation.\n\nI once ordered a drink got charged 3 bucks... I know that said drink has a suggested retail price of $1.29-$1.49. \n\nFor a restaurant that you have to get your own utensils, expected to clear your table, and go to a counter to place your order, you should really walk away feeling like you just had a great meal at a great value, not guilty and telling yourself \"I think I over paid\". \n\nI love of arepas and support a So. American joint around here anytime (because I just get super tired of Mex food!), but lets be realistic... for this neighborhood... it is too pricey for what you get. \n\nSuggestions: \n- Make your spicy foods spicy when listed as spicy\n- Consider adding a little something to the plates, even 2 slivers of  plantains with a piece of yuca (this way you get more people that are unfamiliar with yuca to try them out!)\n- Have some sort of combo deal that actually presents a savings and this will most definitely encourage people to come back. I know you guys are in NAPA, and perhaps there is an expectation of a high price for things while you are in wine country and this formula has worked for you at that local, but this is a completely different area.\n\nI say all this because I really want to see this place stick around and am extremely happy to have you guys in the neighborhood.

It's an order-at-the-counter sort of place, so just walk right up.  The menu is simpler than it appears - Choose your wrapping, then choose your filling.  Done.\n\nThe Arepas is sort of like a corn version of a thick pita - it's got the texture, flavor & consistency much like lightly fried polenta, with an almost crispyness to the edge.  Very good.  I went with the Pabellon filling, which is shredded skirt steak that was seriously as tender as perfect pulled pork.  Fantastic!  Also nice chunks of fried plantain, black beans, and cheese.  This was pretty much awesome, and way more filling than I expected.  Pretty comparable to a medium-sized burrito.\n\nI also tried the empanadas, which arrive as a set of 3, and are of the thin, deep fried variety.  Be warned - they come HOT!  I got the black bean & cheese option, and they were tasty, but on the greasy side.  They're also pretty small.\n\nEverything comes with a dipping sauce (there are a few different options, mostly based on spiciness I think), which all seem to be mayo blended with various things.  Reasonably tasty, but thick & mayo-y.\n\nThey have a few beers and wines available, as well as a standard selection of sodas & such.\n\nPica Pica is definitely a fast-food sort of place - it's small, ain't fancy, but is clean and well designed for quick turnover.

The vibe here in the Mission is definitely different - there's a seating area (instead of just a window counter) and I like the bamboo/wood decor. I went with a bigger group so we were able to sample a lot - here's what it came down to:\n\n- Sangria: Meh. My friend really liked it, but don't expect Cha Cha Cha's style sangria. It's thicker and darker, and more tart. You won't find any fruit floating around in your cup either!\n\n- Pasapalos (side dishes): Yucca fries are amazing. Light, crunchy, and thick. They were super hot and came with a garlic aioli dipping sauce...my favorite! The plantains are just okay. They were kind of burnt and I'm not the biggest fan of how sweet they were.\n\n- Empanadas: Here's where Pica Pica could earn an extra star. The empanadas left MUCH to be desired. They were undercooked almost, kind of doughy, and really flat. Skip these!\n\n- Chupe: The only time I've ever seen soup come with half a corn on the cob! I didn't taste this dish, but it looked good. A soup with shredded cheese...mmm!\n\nAnd now for the main dishes....I'm just going to throw it out there and say that I prefer the maize'wich over everything else. The arepas taste like they could just be a plain pita, and the cachapas are messy. Go for the gold and get the corn maize'wich.\n\n- Pepeada: Basically just like chicken salad with some creamed avocado. Meh. I liked the fact that it didn't fall apart when you took a bite of it, but it wasn't anything special or that flavorful even.\n\n- Pabellon: Delicious skirt steak, with plantains, black beans and cheese. I didn't like the sweetness of the plantains. The black beans made it really watery and messy, so I had to eat it with a fork and knife. The menu claims this dish is spicy... it wasn't at all.\n\n- Pernil: Saved the best for last. Everyone's favorite. Shredded pork, tomato, avocado, and what else? Aioli. I liked to add extra.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try some of the other combinations that looked interesting (like the only breakfast option - perico, the Venezuelan-style scrambled eggs stuffed into an arepa or maize'wich). \n\nSpice up your empanadas, get on top of your sangria, and you'll earn 5 stars, Pica Pica!", "author": "Hannah L."}

We kept the order because by the time we sat down and figured it out there was a long line waiting to order and didn't want deal with it. Then the food came, only one of the arepas never came. When we finally were able to ask for it, they brought the wrong one.

My wife preferred the white corn arepa to the yellow corn (I liked the yellow one more) but we agreed that both were quite good. We both enjoyed the vegetarian arepa to the shuli since it basically had the same ingredients but included a tasty tofu and plantains so we would probably just order that one next time. The arepa concept is cool, kind of like a pita taco with a soft, corn shell which they have clearly mastered. We could see ourselves coming back, maybe on a colder day as the food was comforting.

One bite of the queso fresco empanada with the crispy outside and gooey inside and I was hooked. My friend that I shared the empanadas with has family from Ecuador, and she exclaimed that these were the best empanadas she's had besides the ones her grandma makes in Ecuador.

I think this sandwich would be best without the tofu or with a marinated and baked tofu. Simply using more of the delicious black bean spread would have made the sandwich perfect, no tofu needed. Sadly, this is a tragic fault of many vegetarian dishes.\n \nBut, I would be willing to repeat the experience for the tasty bread. \n They had quick and friendly service.

My husband got the maize-wich, which was much smaller but even thicker, moister, made with sweet yellow corn. Both were delicious just on their own.\n\nMy arepa I had filled with catira, which was chicken and cheddar cheese with sofrito sauce. While this was pretty good, I would have preferred a little more spice and flavor. My husband got the pernil, pulled pork, which was REALLY great. Lots of porkiness, great sauce and avocado to boot. \n\nWe also got the side salad, which had quinoa, pineapple, lettuce, peppers and jicama --but in spite of all that, was sort of unremarkable. Came with a passionfruit vinaigrette, even. Good, fresh, healthy, but somehow a little boring. \n\nMy main issue was that even with a salad, it wasn't quite enough food. It's about the equivalent of a small sandwich. For the price, they could give you about 15% more and that would be just enough. As it is, you're going to probably want sides --fried yucca or plaintains --neither of which is a light choice for those of us who are trying to avoid becoming an obesity statistic. \n\nBut the food did taste good, and we didn't have any problems with service (but it was definitely crowded).

Looking to the menu I saw that almost everything was spicy, even considering that most of the people here in SF mostly like spicy food, it's not normal in Venezuela to eat spicy, we just have different sauces and you choose how spicy do you want it. The arepas were completely burned which make no sense because they just made arepas and a few other stuffs. I tried also the empanadas and surprisingly they were spicy as well. Sincerely as a \"Venezuela place\" is just awful because there was not even one dish exactly as is prepared in Venezuela and they are not hard to do at all.

We were lucky enough to get a small table in the corner.. Its basically fast food. Order at the counter and they give you a number.\n\nLa Vegeteriana Arepa - OK, lacking a little flavor. Comes with their aioli which was too garlicky. could definitely have used a little flavor.\n\nLa Shuli Cachapa - Really good. Beans were nicely spiced and went really well with the rest of the ingredients\n\nMorena Empanada - Good, but we ordrered the smoky tomato sauce with it.. We didn't like the sauce as much\n\nFried Plantains - Good, We got the tamarind sauce with it.. Very nice.. Tamarind sauce was just like the indian tamarind chutney.\n\nSangria - Small glass, $6.00 - a little expensive, but, they screwed up our order, so, got another glass on the house.

I was completely blown away and I couldn't wait to get home and look them up on the internet.  But I was only disappointed to find out the only one they had was in Napa, so it was kinda a bit far for me to go there just for a maize'wich/cachapa.  With that said, I was super excited when my gf told me that they are opening one up in the city.  After waiting around for months, it finally opens, and we couldn't wait to get there.\n\nSo we took a couple of friends with us and headed up to the city for dinner on a Monday night.  We got there around 8pm and the place was still pretty packed.  The place is definitely leaning towards the small size, I could imagine a group of 5 or more would have problem getting a table to sit together.  \n\nSo my gf and I both got a different cachapa and both were great.  She had the pabellon and I had the pernil.  We also ordered 2 glasses of sangria and an order of enpanadas (3).  The sangria came in a rather small glass and quite frankly a bit over priced.  The enpandas were a bit bland, we would probably skip them next time.  \n\nBut the cachapas were amazing.  The size was decent even though I've read reviews that some felt they could be bigger.  The meat were tender and the ingridents were fresh.  I really like the sweet corn flour that they used.  I think it might not be a sizable dinner for people who has a bigger appetite, a maize'wich to me would make a perfect lunch for both size and price.\n\nWe also ordered the yucca fries and they were really good.  We had the aioli sauce, highly recommended.\n\nThe day we went they were also having some problem with their POS, and some orders didn't print out for the kitchen staff, so we were waiting around for a while only to having to tell the server what we ordered.  But I'll let that slide since they pretty much just opened and I understand they still need time to iron out some stuff.  Also the staff seems to be a bit overwhelmed that day, maybe due to the POS failure, and didn't really get around busing the empty tables till a while later.  Even so, the staff were really friendly and really helpful.\n\nI will definitely give it another try maybe in a month or so and see if they have their stuff together a bit better.\n\nBut overall, based on the fact that it's a new store and how yummy the food was, I think they deserve a 4 star review on my first visit.", "author": "Anthonio C."}

I pointed longingly at one of the sample items in the display case--the Pabell\u00f3n. Stuffed with shredded skirt steak, sweet plantains, black beans and cheese, this quesadilla-like Arepa variation confused and delighted my bored palate.

I am a vegetarian so naturally I got the vegetarian option.  It's a big, warm, yummy pocket of goodness filled with tofu, black beans, plantains.  Kind of messy to eat- hard to pick up.  But once you get it down to a manageable size it's great.  Love the side of slaw they give you as well.", "author": "Sarah G."}

I'd more go with \"juicy\" as a descriptive term.  Either way, I can let that go and give you that these little arepas are a little hard to eat.  I was expecting something more street-foody, but it was nearly impossible to eat my black bean arepa without a knife and fork.  Since that's the case, I feel like we could do without the paper wrapping.. that gets a little gross.\n\nThere were a couple good veggie options on the menu, which was great for me.  I also tried some yummy yucca fries as others have mentioned.  Apart from the hard-to-pick-up part, the other downside is coming here with a group.  None of your food comes out at the same time, so it's hard to enjoy the meal together.  It also takes a while for them to make the tasty little sandwiches.\n\nAll that said, I'll still be back.  This is a great stop for a quick, cheap, interesting meal in the Mission if your expectations are set accordingly.", "author": "Gretchen S."}

It was yummy and my mother-in-law's pulled pork, the Pernil (#7), was great too. The only thing I'd do differently next time would be to pair the sandwiches with the Arepa bread instead of the Cachapa as it was a little too much sweetness overall.

Their yuca fries with dipping sauce has potential but that's about it.

The cachapas were super sweet and delicious.The meat was great and oh those plantains.  The plantains were the best part.  So good.  \n\nThe portions for the cachapas are pretty huge.

The Cachapa was soooooo incredibly good, especially with the garlic aioli (and they give you extra to take with you). I will definitely try them again and again.

For my first lunch outing, I had the arepa, filled with pulled pork, and a side of yuca fries. They brought back memories of growing up in Miami - the arepa was nice, moist, sweet corn patties with lots of whole corn kernel, and the pulled pork was very (perhaps a bit too) juicy, and flavorful, with just a bit of spice and heat. It came with some green salad on the side, dressed with just a bit of citrus dressing, and awesome, crusty, crunchy, starchy yuca fries. If you haven't had yuca before, it's kind of like a really starchy, dense potato. It came with a garlicky white herb dressing, and I also ordered their spicy ketchup, which was excellent.

But that's another review), one of them reminded us that we hadn't had dinner yet. It wasn't very late really, but hey, 'm always in for food. So, we gave her the responsibility of taking us to a good place (which, trust me, should put a lot of pressure on your shoulders). After walking around a bit in the Mission/Valencia area it was like she suddenly had a vision (or whatever) to go to Pica Pica - she'd been there before and had loved it. One of the best epiphanies I've seen in others, ever. (okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration).\n\nPica Pica serves something unique, at least to me. I haven't had/seen that anywhere else before. It is like a not-so-fluffy pancake (the one I had was made of Maize - the semi-sweetness was lovely!) cut horizontally through the center and opened up like Pacman, whose mouth's filled with sheer awesomeness. The awesomeness in my case was mostly shredded beef and friend ripe-plantains. Fried Plantains! I tell ya, I miss that thing a LOT. The maize-wich (as they call it) was overall really good and apparently is gluten-free (which doesn't really make any difference to me, but hey 'm just throwing it out there in case it helps). The only problem I had was that the quantity you get, especially for the price you pay, is pretty limited. I could've easily eaten two of them maize-wiches (and I wasn't even really hungry, ha). Also, not something they could control, but we had to sit outside coz all tables inside were taken, and it was really cold!\n\nDefinitely a must eat place. Unique and delicious.\nAs an added bonus, they have funny names for some food items. If you don't think 'Bululu' is funny, you're wrong.\n\n\nPS: The good food experience means I might have made a friend for life ha.", "author": "Pravin P."}

Hell, those Maize'wiches are more addictive than heroin. Screw that dirty cheesesteak place on Divis, Pica Pica really should have that sign hanging out front warning that \"eating here can be habit forming\".\n\nThe wife and I first had the pleasure of eating these overstuffed morsels of heaven at this year's Fillmore Jazz Festival (the BEST Fillmore Fest yet, BTW). On that glorious Saturday afternoon, I ordered the Pernil Maize'wich with a side of Yuca Fries, while the wife went with the Pabellon Maize'wich. I don't think I've ever inhaled food that quickly in my life (well, at least not while sober). That Maize'wich was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten, super sweet cornbread stuffed with a heaping mound of juicy, perfectly seasoned pork and creamy avocado. My wife downed hers so fast I didn't even get a bite of the Pabellon. This was an obvious miscarriage of justice, so naturally this wrong had to be made right the next time we were in La Mission.\n\nBlessedly, we found ourselves at that newly-sainted corner of Valencia & 15th this past Friday evening. The restaurant was only half full at around 6:30, so I went up to order while wifey sat down at one of the few tables that Pica Pica managed to shoehorn into their dining room. We did the old switcheroo this time around, with me ordering the Pabellon Maize'wich while the boss went with the Pernil, both with a side of those amazing Yuca Fries. Those Maize'wiches were even better the 2nd time around! The steak was perfectly cooked and impossibly moist, and the fried plantains added yet another layer of sweetness to the heavenly cornbread. The old lady LOVED her Pernil, taking down her Maize'wich in \"Joey Chestnut ain't got sh*t on me!\" time. The Yuca Fries are absolutely divine, and the Napa Smith Ale on tap washed it all down perfectly. Total tab: $27, thanks to the free Arepa coupons they were giving out at the festival. Damn, I wish I had taken a few more of those...\n\nPica Pica has since become my 2nd most unhealthy addiction and is a fantastic addition to an already amazing neighborhood restaurant scene. We finished our crack habit dinner, headed to The Phoenix for some pints of my 1st most unhealthy addiction, and watched the Giants kick the D-Bags' asses.

So, for one CACHAPA and a diet coke and another soda it was $15.05 !  Not worth the trip.  The cachapa was mildly bland and listless.  Ehh.  Skip it, even if you could find parking.

I noticed the maize bread had a nice, crispy outer texture with bits of corn attached to it. \nWe also had a side of thick cut yuca fries with spicy ketchup dip. The sweet taste and slightly firm texture of the yuca were accented nicely when fried to a golden crisp.\nFour stars for gluten free food, unpretentious service, and for being in my favorite sunny neighborhood.

The interior was nice, if small. It had that kitschy SF foodie spot feel to the place, which is always pleasant. But don't judge a book by it's cover. \n\nFirst off-the food. It was terrible. I had empanadas, plantains, and a maize-wich. The empanadas were greasy, thick, and the included sauce had a strange taste to it. It would have been nice if the stuffing wasn't quite so bland as well. The plantains were alright, sweet and good for sharing (although I personally did not like the cheese sprinkled on top). The maize-wich was the WORST. The pancake itself was very greasy and it seemed unevenly cooked or warmed-up. One side was really hot and dark colored, while the other side was luke warm and of a more natural color.  The filing was a mixture of various ingredients pureed with avocados, so it had an off green texture that did not look appetizing (kind of like toothpaste with particles of food stuck in it). The filing was also COLD, and I personally don't like cold and hot foods to mix. That was an extreme downer for me, considering the wait time couldn't they at least have warmed up the filling a little? I mean I'm talking about straight out of a cold freezer. I also had a drink with my meal and was charged $3. Any other place on mission would charge 1-1.75 reasonably. For the amount I paid, I would expect more and of a higher quality. Of course, part of why I am upset, I went here for dinner thinking I could get a complete and filing meal. Needless to say I left disgusted and utterly unsatisfied. \n\nI went with a Venezuelan friend and even he said that this was not typical Venezuelan cuisine. Everything was too greasy, too thick, and some ingredients seemed much more from Mexico. I think a lot of fellow San Franciscans are being fooled into coming here for the idea of eating Venezuelan food and feeling \"cosmopolitan\" and cultured. Unfortunately, they are being duped like sheep into paying for overpriced stodge from a hole in the wall operation.\nBOTTOM LINE:\nTHERE ARE MANY OTHER FINE CULINARY EXPERIENCES ALONG MISSION AND VALENCIA MORE WORTHY OF YOUR TASTEBUDS AND PRECIOUS DOLLARS.

They also offer a small selection of beer on tap and wines which is a nice addition to the yummy food.\n\nThe place is nicely painted in bright colors which are more restaurant feeling than the otherwise cafeteria style order, seat yourself, pick up your own food and beers kinda service.\n\nThe only real downside for me with this place is that it is definitely NOT fast food.

The corn bread thing itself was inoffensive but I don't really ever need to eat another one. The filling didn't work AT ALL. The meat was fine in terms of seasoning, but the giant chunks of plantain completely dominated the sandwich and made everything way too sweet. They needed to be much smaller and better distributed. The bites without plantain in them were definitely the best. I also found that the black beans got completely lost in there. Also, this thing is marked on the menu as spicy, which I think must be code for \"contains flavor,\" because there was no heat whatsoever. I also ordered the yuca fries. The fries themselves were pretty tasty, but I was surprised when I wasn't asked which dipping sauce I wanted, since there are 5 or 6 options listed on the menu. I liked the sour cream-chipotle thing they came with, though. The one issue was that the fries were not well enough drained and there was a sizable pool of oil that dripped out of the cone thing they came in and onto the table. Gross! All in all, the food was totally forgettable and i will never ever crave it. \n\nAtmosphere:\nTotally fine work-lunch crowd. Not very \"missiony.\" It might work better in a mall or something.

The sweet and fluffy cornbread adds a real kick to the other mostly salty ingredients.  The cheese empanadas were really fresh and the yucca fries were great albeit SUPER greasy after awhile.

At Pica Pica on Valencia Street, you can stop in for a \"Maizewich\" just like the good old days. Everything on their menu is gluten free. If you've never tried an Arepa, Maizewich or Cachapa, they are variations on a delicious Venezuelan corn bread which looks something like a cross between a pancake and pita bread. Choose your specific corn pocket and have it stuffed with a variety of fillings, like tofu, plantains, black beans and a zesty spread or juicy pulled pork with shredded cheese- they even have a chicken salad filling. Two specific vegan options are available, and for the dairy sensitive carnivores- just ask them to leave off the cheese. The Pernil (shredded seasoned beef with plantains and black beans) with or without cheese is delicious- among many others. Don't ignore the tasty sides offered like yucca fries and sweet plantains. \n\nFor photos and more gluten free friendly restaurants in San Francisco: www.GFinSF.com", "author": "lauren v."}

This place transports me to my Tia and Abuelo's kitchen.  It is a very accurate representation of these Venezuelan dishes, and I probably would eat here way too often if I lived in the Mission.  The only downside is that their menu is small and simply changes fillings for types of bread.  There are a couple other foods that I would love them to add.  If you want know what Venezuelan food is like, then you should try this place out.  If you don't like it, then you don't like venezuelan food.", "author": "Alaric F."}

There is something awesome and amazing about eating regular everyday stuff like sandwiches with the twist that they're made with unique and delicious maize puffy things instead of bread. I had the chicken salad sandwich, a delightful take on a classic with avocado in the mix.

I understand this is a gluten free resto, and we do love us some gluten, so that wasn't a selling point. But as vegetarians (OK, I'm a pescatarian) we had several options on the Pica Pica menu. When the food came we were wowed by the sauces - though we weren't sure what was supposed to go on what, it just didn't matter. The creamy spicy one, the mustardy spicy one, and the fruity sweet one: all yummy. Wished we'd gotten 2 or 3 orders of the empanadas - tasty little deep fried treats. The Cachapa corn crepe option elevated the sandwich from, well, a sandwich to *dinner.\"  The website ordering was easy, apart from not being able to find the salsa explanations.

I went because a vegan blog source mentioned there are vegan options and I'm always looking for great places to go with my omnivore friends.  The food is tasty and it's easy on the brain when it comes to deciding what to order since the menu is tiny (and when you're vegan it's even more limited.)\n\nBoth my friend and I had the chachapas, mine was the La Vegetariana and my friend had the La Shuli.  We also had a side order of the Bululu and Sweet Plantains.  The plantains are awesome though probably highly caloric.  My chachapa was ok/good, tofu was nice and tender.  The salad was ok, the dressing was the most interesting part of it - definitely full of passion fruit flavor. \n\nWhy only 3 stars?  I guess I expected (rightly or wrongly) that they would better understand how to \"serve\" a vegan given the review I had read.  \n1) The first statement out of my mouth when I ordered was that I was vegan.  I double checked if the La Vegetariana was vegan and was told yes.  When it arrived - turns out the sauce it comes with is anything but vegan, so though the sandwich was still tasty I felt I was missing something.\n2) When the sweet plantains arrived they were covered in cheese.  When I brought this to their attention I was told \"it comes with cheese\" but when I pointed out that it does not state that on the menu he took it back and made a new batch for us.\n3) He had recommended the Aioli sauce to go with the Plantains and since the menu said it was made with \"garlic and olive oil\" I went with his recommendation.  But when it came out it clearly had some sort of dairy base to it.  Upon questioning it, the waiter was kind enough to go check with the cook and came back with the verdict that it was made with garlic, olive oil, cilantro, pepper.  I sincerely don't believe it, maybe I'm wrong, but I'd bet money there is dairy in the sauce.\n\nSo all to say, as a vegan I would have appreciated more accurate assistance in navigating the menu.  To all vegans, be very very clear when ordering, ask specific questions, don't trust that the ingredients listed on the menu are the only ingredients in each dish.  (I personally also dislike cilantro, and nowhere does it say there is cilantro in the aioli.)  Good luck!", "author": "Q E."}

While it was not strong, it was deliciously flavored with peach juice and had lots of crispy fresh chunks of apple floating at the top. The plantains with aioli were really good, the soft sweet morsels of dense deliciousness paired well with the creamy aioli and salty bits of a feta-like cheese. The veggie arepa was satisfying with grilled tofu, black beans, slices of avocado, more plantains and a spicy cream. The tofu was firm and smokey, and cream was perfectly spicy and moisten'd up the corn exterior.

Ergo, we gave up and assumed this was just another great eatery that fell victim to complacency. On Sunday, we happened to be in the Mission and decided, if for nothing other than nostalgia, we would stop by and grab a bite. And just when I thought the food couldn't be any worse...they totally redeemed themselves!!! I mean the arepas were cooked properly and full of flavor, the empanadas were crispy and fresh, the yucca fries were just plain awesome!!! You even get a small salad with your food (which is supper delicious btw). Not to mention all of the new fresh juices they offer!!! Oh and dessert??? Forget about it...soooo good!\n\nWe had a moment to talk to one of the new partners and asked him about the changes. He let us know that they now have fresher ingredients, a new chef, new items, and have revamped the presentations. Thank the food gods!!!

I had the Maize-wich with the Chicken filling and my bf had the pancakey one with the chicken/avocado filling. They were both very tasty. The service is still getting polished. For example we waited quite a long time, and the wrong cheese was on my order, and there were no utensils or napkins given. It came to over $25 for those two dishes, which were pretty small, and two sodas. I think that is overly expensive for a Latin-American style lunch in the Mish. Anyway, I would go back and try some other things because it certainly was tasty. And looking forward to the hot chocolate as well.

In Venezuela cachapas are made thinner, with queso fresco, I've never seen a cachapa with avocado and rice, etc. They are trying too hard to make each dish into a full meal. Most the dishes they serve there are meant to be snacky foods, so just charge less and stick to original recipies.  The arepa wasn't all that good either. The masa was correct, but otherwise we don't really use avocados in Venezuela for arepas. What happened to hot dogs with salsa rosada or carne mechada or simple hamon y queso.

At first, I  was very excited to hear that there was going to be a Venezuelan restaurant in San Francisco. The first 5 times I went there I really enjoyed their quality food. Even though I thought it was kind of expensive, I didn't hesitate to pay for the super tasty chachapas, pabellon arepas, passion fruit juice, platains or yuca. It became one of my fav restaurants in the mission, but then they changed cooks and the food lowered its quality completely . I am Venezuelan and I can tell anyone how tasty  pabellon and reina pepiada arepas are. Pica Pica aperas and cachapas are now way too far to taste as good as the real Venezuelan food. After a while away from Pica Pica, I decided to go back last Sunday, and sadly I have to say that it has gotten even worse. I ordered a pork arepa and a side of yuca with guasacaca. The pork wasn't fresh, the yuca was just ok, but the guasacaca was plain guacamole, so thinking that I got the wrong order, I asked the waitress to changed it for guasacaca, and she said that what I got was guasacaca.

They have sauces for you to use at the tables, and I chose the sour cream+chile one - uber delicious, went perfectly with the sandwich and had a nice kick to it. Even the little salad on the side was fantastic with that flavorful passion fruit dressing. My friend ordered yucca fries and I've got to say I've had those from a Peruvian food truck before and these definitely topped the list. Absolutely yummy and go perfectly with any of those sauces on the table. I basically scarfed down the sandwich and will definitely be back for more! Location is pretty close all the other great stuff Mission has to offer, definitely noisy and cramped inside but food is so worth it.", "author": "Olga S."}

But I think their food is stellar regardless of its glutenity (I just made that word up). The arepas are the next best think to real middle eastern pitas, and let's face it, who doesn't like fried plantains in their pita?? Also, I was really not a fan of yucca fries before this place, since they are usually a stringy chewy oily mess. But pica's fries are deliciously crispy and soft at the same time. Awesome.", "author": "Y T."}

Does not compare to Caracas, Arepa Bar in the East Village of Manhattan.  That was the first time I ever had an arepa and have been looking for some here in SF ever since.  Next time you're in NYC, stop by Caracas, 93 East Seventh St. and see for yourself.", "author": "Mabel C."}

I don't need gluten free, and I found the corn wrapper to be overly dense and hard to cut into, let alone palate.  The plantains and the empanadas were saturated in oil and otherwise pretty flavorless.  I also found the menu and decor sort of corporate, Chipotle-esque.", "author": "Malena W."}

It's small, sparse and clean. I walked in a few minutes before it got busier, around 2:30. \nI ordered a vegetarian maize-wich, pasapalos de yuca and a drink, and the total was a little over $15. The cashier was totally icy. \nI scored one of the of the small tables before a large group walked in. Somebody plonked down my order and vanished. The sandwich was barely warm and quite honestly, it was boring. It contained one wedge of avocado, one square tofu patty, two 1/3 slices of platano maduro, and approximately two tablespoons of frijoles negros, which were absolutely bland. \nI'm from San Juan, and I've tasted plenty of cachapas and arepas in Caracas. The only thing that I can think is that the vegetarian presentation is more of an after-thought. I also noticed that the meat sandwiches are considerably larger than what I was served. I'm not a food glutton, but I couldn't help but notice the discrepancy.\nYuca is a common feature in my part of the world, and while I've never been a fan of it - I prefer yautia (taro), I will say that the yuca was good because it was crunchy, almost as though it had been twice-fried like a European-style french fry. The sauce that accompanied it was bland.\nOver all; I found the un-engaging service and the blandness a losing combination. Pica Pica was way too \"come y vete\" for my taste.", "author": "Ram\u00f3n B."}

The corn was sweet and the bread was fluffy.  The vegetarian filling had slices of avo, tofu and lightly carmelized plantains.  Mmmm.  The Yuca fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and perfect for dipping in the thick garlic aoli or smoky black bean paste.  We'll be back.  Alot.", "author": "Marisssa M."}

Here is a place where for the first time in the 1.5 years since my diagnosis, I was able to fully relax and enjoy a restaurant meal without worrying about getting sick.  That state of mind might have colored my appreciation for the food, but everything was  delicious - interesting and novel combinations of flavors and ingredients that were very satisfying.   This place is now my default destination - make it yours to insure their success!   Thank you Pica Pica!", "author": "Bob C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-11", "description": "If you wish to pay $8.50 for $1.50 of ingredients, and have bland, uninteresting food in TINY portions, this is the place for you.  My wife and I had the Arepa with #2 filling ($8.50 with tax), the $9.00 sweet corn pancake with vegetarian filling, the #1 salad, and the Yucca fries.  The amount and quality of the filling in the Arepa was laughable.  In general, the portions were so small and the food was so bland, it made me feel disrespected as a consumer.  The only OK part of the meal were the Yucca fries, which were pretty good.  That doesn't excuse the rest of the meal or the outrageous prices.  If your eating choices are limited on account of being gluten-intolerant you and have money to burn, you might consider eating here.  I appreciate that people requiring this special type of diet need a place to go, but I don't believe that this, on its own, should be the basis for a four or five star review.  Anyone looking for a good meal at a fair price look elsewhere.  There is a dozen better choices in the Mission, in terms of both taste and value.", "author": "Alex V."}
