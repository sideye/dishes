No one that works there greets or acknowledges you the first time they see you. So you may have to hang out at the register for w bit while you wait to make your oder. This happened both times I visited. So you'll wait to place your order. Then you can seat yourself. You just kind of tell them where you'll be. Or they'll look for you. It's not a super huge place.\n   The food is delicious! Totally worth not being greeted or acknowledged right away. We ordered a pierna enchilada torta Jr. Size. That's the most popular torta there, and it's totally delicious! Pulled pork and enchilada sauce. The taco with the huitlacoche was even delicious. It's a really big taco served on a tortilla. There's no meat in it. It's like the huitlacoche is the meat. But that taco is super delicious. We also ordered the carne asada torta. Jr. Size. Also very delicious. The meat is well seasoned, the cheese is amazing. And they didn't put too much beans or any of the tortas. It was like the beans were just used for a spread. \n     On my first visit a month ago, I got the pi\u00f1a colada smoothie. You may think it's pricey, but that too was super delicious! I mean I have never had a pi\u00f1a colada smoothie that good before! Creamy and delicious! \n     Once you get in well and get your food ordered the service is excellent! The waitresses are very attentive, and bring everything you could want or need before you can even ask for it. \n    The restroom is small, but very clean. So don't hesitate to use it if you're one of these people that hates using public bathrooms. You'll be pleasantly surprised. \n       Parking on a Sunday usually is easy. You can park for free at the meters on Sunday. You may have to park a block or two away, but it's never too far. \n      I will come here every visit I have to San Francisco.", "author": "Zoe S."}

My chorizo and potato torta had VERY little chorizo, a few potatoes and lots of lettuce.

The tortilla made with blue corn masa was not fully cooked and was hard and not tasty. There were no black beans, no salsa, 3 thin slices of avocado, a bit of chopped onion and fortunately 2 eggs. All for $8.95 (half order size). When we mentioned the problems to the owner he made said they had made substitutions ??!! They substituted food for empty real estate on the plate. And when I asked about the missing salsa from the dish, he pointed to the salsa on the table. He was very defensive and stored off. Not a good sign. If he was confident in what they were serving, he would of stayed and discussed the problem. When we asked for the check he said \"no charge\". I would of preferred a good meal that I pay for rather than a free bad one. \nAlso prices are high. $14.95 for Huevos Rancheros for a diner is very expensive.\n\nIn fairness, I have eaten here before and it was good.

We split a pierna enchilada (pulled pork) torta and it was absolutely delicious. The bread was perfectly toasted while still being soft on the inside, the tortilla was fluffy and light, and the pork was so flavorful and tender. One torta is pretty big, about 6\" x 4\", so our group was able to easily split one and still have enough food to take the edge off our hunger without spoiling our appetites. \n\nThe champurrado can be an acquired taste for those new to atoles, but is definitely worth getting if you love trying new things. Basically, it's a chocolate-flavored atole (a hot, masa-based drink) that's popular in Mexico and Central America. La Torta gives a rather generous amount in a big mug that will keep you warm on cold nights.\n\nThe staff here are super nice too. When we ordered just one torta and one cup of champurrado to split amongst 4 people, our waitress was understandably confused. (We made sure to come in the middle of the afternoon when there were few patrons.) When we explained that we were doing a food crawl, she made sure to cut up the torta into 4 even, individually wrapped pieces. We didn't even have to ask her! She and the rest of the staff also wished us well when we were leaving, saying they hoped the rest of our food crawl was good. So nice. :)", "author": "Josephine L."}

We came into the busy restaurant and sat down on our own.  While we waited for a server, I saw a girl come in and grab a napkin to dab her ankle which had gotten cut, followed immediately by the bossman I had spotted earlier (I'm observant, okay?) telling her that she had to ask him for the use of 'that' napkin. She told him that she's a regular customer and neighbor but that only pissed him off more. I couldn't hear what he said back to her. She looked totally offended and stormed out of the restaurant without buying anything. I think she was just there to borrow the napkin. I guess she should have asked him if she could borrow one of his Costco napkins. I'm saying Costco because I know he got a good deal on bulk napkins.\n\nAll of this drama before my order was even taken?

The tortas are all pretty solid but the China Poblana and the Al Pastor are both so savory and decadent, I always come back for more. The woman who runs the place always greets me like a neighbor (and i am) but I don't get this from the other spots in my patch of SF. It is true as another review points out that many of their ingredients come from Costco as I have been there on delivery days as well. But my business shops at Costco too because they sell fairly high quality goods for the price. Costco actually does alot of local sourcing, that many food distributors don't so I think it is a shame to ding them for this. While I'd like to see local ingredients I know that comes with a higher price tag, I am willing to accept either as long as they serve delicious food at a fair price with a smile. They do all of this.\n\nOne other thing. I also like trotting out my Spanish from study abroad and she is very patient and helpful on keeping my Espanol tuned up. Nice plus.", "author": "Sean Q."}

It was awesome!!!  fresh ingredients, great customer service, good prices, and clean. Unfortunately the place changed of owner and everything went down. The menu changed totally!!!!  the service people are not the same, even the \"cashier\" dresses and acts like a hooker with the customers.   I went to get 3 tortas to go and while they made them we sat at the counter and watch the whole process which by the way they need to get better and clean that greasy range hood (drips grease).   When I saw that they didn't put tomato on them, I asked the cook if they didn't put that because a real traditional Mexican torta has tomato!!!  so he said that I wanted some he'll put it.  So.. after 35 minutes of waiting... they finally called my name to pay...  when I come to the cashier she tells me that it was $43 dollars for 3 tortas..  WTF????????   So I asked her why it was so high?  she said becuase It was a dollar each extra for the tomato,...  and I said... a dollar for two slices of tomato?  That's ridiculous!!!!   and this ASSHOLE!!!  who was standing there next to me at the register.. said:  They don't give me the tomatoes for free at the store.... And i asked... WHO ARE YOU? He said... the owner.   OMG!!!  really?  NO wonder why this place sucks now!!!  So I said.... I'm not asking you to give me nothing for free... but it's not fare to try to steal or rip off your customers.   So... I asked for my receipt and they said they didn't have receipts....  and I said... o.k. give me something in writing of what I paid.   He said to Hooker Cashier to give a business card...  really dude???  so.. I was a fan of this place.. Now...  NEVER COMING BACK!!!  \n\nHave you guys tried tortas LOS PICUDOS?

Upon checking the menu you'll find that there's a bigger torta theme than most Mission locations, and there is good reason for that. Their sandwich selection is very good and you can't go wrong by choosing your favorite meat torta and calling it. The JR size is usually enough to fill you up but I always get the full size and save half for later. \n\nAdding avocado and other customizations can increase the bill somewhat but overall they've got very reasonable pricing. Sit down and enjoy the classic atmosphere which combines old school diner with classier Mexican decor than most places on 24th street. \n\nThis isn't El Farolito; it's a place that you can have coffee with your breakfast (the chilaquiles are delish) and actually spend some extended time in a comfortable setting. The service has always been top notch and it's full of Mission locals who know where to get authentic cuisine.\n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "Sean K."}

Its like a whole micro neighborhood within the mission, and its so much more \"mission\". Gone are the hipsters, bring in the authentic mexican restaurants, spanish being thrown around everywhere, mexican grocery stores, the complete package.\nLa Torta Gorda is a little Mexican Diner (and this is a legit diner, complete with bar stools, greasy food, tv screens and beer) that has a small list of city-famous Tortas.\nNow, the only reason why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 : Since I was hungry and wanted to try everything : I went with the \"everything torta\". Whilst most of the meat in this was great, and the buns were perfectly buttered and crisped, the sausage was a GIANT MISS. The sausage in this torta was MOST DEFINITELY NOT needed. So my only tip when you go here : Get any torta without sausage, and you'll come out stuffed and smiling\n\nTip: Their portions are GIGANTIC.

I had a friend for a while, Antonio-Something-Sexy-Sounding, who could like everything about an Italian resaurant, but if the soup was no good the restaurant got no love from Antonio. None. Nada. Nien. Here is a clip of one of our conversations: \n\nMe: Hey, I'm hungry. And I want Italian. And don't throw in some remark about you being Italian and how I can have you. I want Italian food. Not you, the Italian. \n\nASSS: Me, too. \n\nMe: How 'bout that little place on 18th street? I hear it's got a killer gnochi. \n\nASSS: No. \n\nMe: Wha? Why? It's supposed to be fantastic. \n\nASSS: I won't go dere. Da soup sucks balls. \n\nMe: So don't get the soup. \n\nASSS: I can't NOT get da soup. \n\nMe: You're irritating. \n\nASSS: No, I'm Italian! **throws hands in the air** I can't just go to an Italian restaurant and not get da soup! **Keeps hands in the air and stares at me with challenge**\n\nMe: Yes you can. You're being dramatic. \n\nASSS: Dere's just some tings you can't look past! It's like seeing a beautiful woman, and den noticing she has a mustache. She's not beautiful anymore. Same with da soup. It makes the place. And dat place is like a girl with a mustache. \n\nMe: (Silence)\n\nASSS: (Staring) \n\nMe:  Fine. How about the place on Valencia we went to a couple months ago? Or is that place like a beautiful mustachioed woman, too? \n\nASSS: No. That's a true beautiful lady. We can go there. \n\nMe: You're buying. \n\nAnyway ... that's how I am about salsa. I'm a self-admitted salsa-snob. And I like it HOT! \n\nSince I moved to the Mission four months ago I have made it my personal goal to try every taqueria in my neighborhood of 24th avenue. The rest of the goal? Not gaining mass LB's in the process. I'm most of the way through it, but two weeks ago Torta Gorda shot their way to the top of my  list by offering the best damn salsa in the city. And it's hot. Like, really, really hot. And you know that onion-y, habanero-y cabbage-y thing you can get at some taquerias? The coveted salsa with no name? Yeah, the one at Torda Gorda blows them all away. In every sense of the word. In fact, if you're not used to spicy this will be a bit too much for you, but I chose to pile it high on top of my chilaquiles and pay the consequences later. It was sooooo worth it. \n\nWhich reminds me: Get the chilaquiles with eggs the way you like them and carna asada. I asked for over medium and was rewarded with the best eggs I've had in 34 years on this planet. It's like, how can you make an egg better? It's an 'effing egg. But they do. Their eggs taste betterr. \n\nThat should be their motto: La Torta Gorda -- Our Eggs Taste Better. \n\nAnd did I mention they have a patio? Mmmhmm. It's there. Since they don't offer booze, and since I live right around the corner, I'm thinking I'll order of of their amazing juices and add my own dash of something adult-like. I'm thinking Cazadores. In fact, I'm thinking it's gonna be an awesome Cazadores-type of a summer on the patio of Torta Gorda gorging myself on chilaquiles and habanero salsa. \n\nMeet me there. I'll be the girl making sweet, sweet love to her food in the corner. It'll be pretty weird. You can't miss me.", "author": "Mel H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-09", "description": "La Torta Gorda brought tears to my eyes today. The food is absolutely delicious and prepared with love, made apparent by the delicate flavors in the dishes and the pride and joy the staff displays. Today was my first visit, inspired by an article written about LTG my friend had passed on. She and I are constantly on the search for good Mexican food in the bay area - this place certainly delivers.\n\n*Tortas are not the only thing on the menu. Other items were featured in the article I had read, so I went with those (below):\n\n1) Quezadillas con Huitlacoche (mushroom that grows on corn, subtle-sweet-earthy flavor)\n---This is not a quesadilla at all in the usual way. A handmade corn tortilla, filled with fresh corn, fresh epazote, huitlacoche, and a LITTLE bit of cheese is filling yet light, and very tasty. \n\n2) Tlacoyos al Albanil\n---This handmade refried-black beans filled corn tortilla, topped with a light tomato sauce, fried egg, and sliced avocado, was my favorite of both dishes.\n\nAccompanying my meal were three hot sauces from three different types of chiles, roasted - two red & a green. Those were lovely.\n\nI complimented my server (perhaps also an owner) on the unusual and yummy dishes and he seemed to take pride, very graciously. He explained that the kitchen of La Torta Gorda was a unique one in The Mission; dishes prepared at LTG are traditional to central/southern Mexico, or Puebla.\n\nAs I was settling up, a woman who also worked there was waiting for her own lunch to arrive. She pointed to a picture of a dish near the \"specials\" board, called\" CHILES EN NOGADA\": a pork, peach & pear-stuffed chile, smothered in a light walnut  crema sauce, garnished with pomegranate seeds and fresh parsley. When it arrived, she insisted that I take a bite and try it. In a word: Ambrosia. Again, obviously prepared from the heart!\n\nAnother selling point to this place - the atmosphere: It is spotlessly clean and lovingly maintained, including the bathroom - a rarity in the business! Also, the old diner feel gives this place a genuine charm, complete with antique looking lights and wall sconces.\n\nFinally, the service was FANTASTIC.\n\nGo to La Torta Gorda and perhaps try something other than a torta. And go before they remove the \"Chiles en Nogada\" from their seasonal offerings.", "author": "Angela M."}

Nestled amongst the \"best of\"'s was La Torta Gorda. The bf is in love with tortas, and since I've never had one before, I decided this may be worth the trek out to the Mission. I kept this place filed away in the back of my brain for one of those days when we get tired of the restaurants around us in the Richmond District.\n\nThat day came last week and I draaaagged the bf and myself off our lazy butts and into my car, me driving and silently hoping that my pain-in-the-ass-ishness about going would be rewarded with a tasty dinner choice. \n\nWe were rewarded. Oh lordy, were we rewarded.\n\nThe place was empty, which seemed strange because of all the praise 7x7 and Yelpers were heaping onto it. The bf and I placed our orders (torta carnitas for me, torta carne asada for the bf) and sat down. The food came up fast and while we were waiting, 3 or 4 people (regulars, it seemed) came and went, all ordering food to go.\n\nWe bit into those tortas and mmmm.. heavenly. The cheese was good, the bread was wonderful, the meat.. meaty deliciousness. It was definitely worth the trek and assuaged my worries that I'd. be. made. a. fool. (Nobody ever likes to be the person who drags someone else to the lame party, the whack bar, or.. the bad torta place?)\n\nHA! IN YOUR FACE, THESE TORTAS WERE AWESOME AND WORTH THE TRIP!\n\nAhem. So, in summary. Go here. Eat the tortas. If you are uber-hungry, get the regular. Otherwise the junior is a good size to get.\n\nFunny side note: you can buy (order?) cup of noodles here!\n\nOh, oh, oh! I almost forgot: the staff is awesome.

I wouldn't come here for anything but their big, juicy, meaty, cheesy delicious sandwiches (tortas) - but they do them well it's worth the trip even though the rest of their items don't look too tempting for me. What seemed strange is their name has 'torta' in it right? So obviously these sandwiches are their main attraction. And while watching them work they only have 2 sandwich presses back there. And they're not like giant either. So we thought the wait would be a while since there was a big group of guys in front of us, but they have great space and time management on those grills and the wait was only about 8 minutes. Not too bad. They've got a cute patio in the back so we got to enjoy our yummy sandwiches in the sunshine which is always an added treat. We tried the Pierna enchilada torta (big eats list item) as well as a saucy carne asada torta. I thought the regular size was way too big so i got the junior. At first glance it was big enough but it tasted soooo good I really wanted more, not that i wasn't totally full after my slightly smaller sandwich, it was just the kind of good that you want to continue eating until you're to the painfully uncomfortably full you know?

It has 3 personalities.\n\nFirst, it's a taqueria. It's in the south mission, everyone who works there is latino, they specialize in tortas, they have shelves behind the register with abuelito hot chocolate and ramen, and when I was there the whole back of the restaurant was filled with a sprawling familia latina, having quite a good time.\n\nSecond, it's a 1950s soda shop. You go in and you can sit down at the bar on a row of soft red cushioned stools. There are big Coca-Cola light fixtures that hang down from the ceiling. While I waited for my meal a well-curved white woman and her daughter came in to order a chocolate milkshake. For all I know they drank it with 2 straws, cheek to cheek, while listening to Paul Anka.\n\nThird, it's a french cafe. They have those faux french liquor art posters everywhere. I ordered a chorizo and egg torta. The guy calls out \"chorizo y huevo..?\" so I go to retrieve it, expecting a torta similar to what I might find up the street at Taco Loco or Farolito. Instead I get an impeccably crafted masterpiece, a work of art, not a drop of grease anywhere, just good mexican ingredients tightly wrapped in paper, looking just like a $15 panini sandwich.

Wait person acknowledged I was going to be dining on the back patio.  15 minutes passed and no wait person or menu.  So I went inside, she apologized profusely.  I ordered the pulled pork 1/2 size Torta which was very good by the way.  But to my dismay there was no Pineapple as the menu said & I didn't realize this till 1/2 way through.  Other disconcerting feature, all the \"extra items mentioned\" I thought would be \"on the side\" and low and behold they were \"inside\" the sandwich.  So from a presentation perspective to receive a sandwich all wrapped up in wax paper, in a basket w/nothing else was somewhat boring.  I did ask for some chips which they don't usually provide but server was very accommodating.  All this being said, waiting 25 minutes for just a sandwich seemed a bit much.  Watermelon drink and sandwich totaled $10.00 (kind of steep for so little).  I felt all the owners/cooks & wait people were self absorbed in some sport game on the TV and therefore other patrons were being ignored.  Will I go back, yes, one more time to try something else.  If i find the serve is yet again \"spotty\" at best, I won't be returning.  Sorry to write such a bummer of a review when all other reviews were glowing, but obviously my experience was much different than anyone else's.", "author": "Marla B."}

Not the best service (if you come in during the lunch hour) takes them a while, and with good reason, lots and lots of people call in big orders. Great prices. I always leave happy with a full belly.", "author": "Arnold S."}
