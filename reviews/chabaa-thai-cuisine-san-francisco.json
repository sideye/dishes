Their duck fried rice is SO good. I just wish they put less onions and less duck skin. Their pad Thai with shrimp is better than the one with chicken because the chicken can be quite dry. Their chicken wings are good, but can be small so I don't really recommend the chicken wings. \n\nThis place is reliable and has pretty good food at decent price!

Total stars:2.5\n\nService: 3 &half stars \nWhen i go in not busy, just two tables filled. Maybe because i came in with a family, and they didn't see /notice me sitting on the other table. I had to waved my hand few times before they can see me and get me the menu, then waved them again two times to get their attention for take my order.  Other then that... my waitress, who wear grey top, pretty nice tho always came check on me and asked everything ok. They always have a smiling face on them when talking to customer, i like that.\n\nFood &Drink: 1 stars\nGrilled Pork Shoulder: ok, nothing special\nSliced Beef Noodle Soup: Soup base ok. After add the chilly sauce in the soup it taste lot better. Beef, look and taste like pork, nothing like beef and also dry\nThai Ice Tea: I then ordered a cup of Thai Ice Tea for Togo just because my waitress's good service. My wrong decision! This is not the first time order Thai Ice Tea in here.  Before it was still too sweet but taste normal &after the ice melt i can accept it. Today's thai tea looks the same drink but taste totally different. I don't know what have added on my drink.... It taste nasty and weird, ill...... also super super super sweet. Wondering the reason they made it over sweet are they trying to cover other taste not belong to the drink?, i don't know!  After gulp down two or three sips can't drink anymore, need to throw away. Also after drinking that my stomach not feeling well. Never order this drink again in here.\n\nCleanliness: 3 stars\nBy looking at my table very clean but touch it its a little sticky.", "author": "Epicure M."}

One of them had never tried the duck fried rice about which the rest of us had previously sung praises, so we decided to get two orders to share. The three of us who have ordered it before thought that it was unfortunately very mediocre compared to all the past times. It just wasn't as tasty, so that was a major disappointment, especially when introducing it to someone who had never had it. The tom ka with chicken and the pad si-yu with beef were fine. Service was good. Since the restaurant was empty, we sat and just talked for at least half an hour after our meal - the wait staff didn't make us feel like we were in the way and I really appreciated that. \n\nI'm not writing this restaurant off just yet - will need to return and try the duck fried rice again and see if they were just having an off day.", "author": "Nicole M."}

Our waitress seemed bothered, and not in the mood to take our order. w/e the night continues. \n\nMy order came in 5 minutes, food was meh, wasn't great, wasn't bad either. My wife's green curry didn't come for another 20 mins, by this time I had already finished eating, and shared a bowl with her so she doesn't just watch me. We asked our waitress if her food was coming, she told us there wasn't an order from my wife. \n\nConfused, we asked her to double check, sure enough, she never wrote down my wife's order. She then acknowledged the mistake, and told us the order will be on its way. We double checked with her the order was for a mild green curry. She started to skirt our table for the next 20 minutes. When we asked her again, she very curtly said \"it will be here\". So we waited. When the curry finally came, it was spicy. We asked her again, then she flatly said we never told her it was supposed to be mild. We are mild tempered people, so we didn't feel the need to confront her. And, by now, we had been waiting for over an hour for the right order to show up, and we decided it wasn't worth the effort to argue our point, so we asked for a box to go. \n\nOur waitress *couldn't see us* for the next 10 minutes, so we had to flag down someone else to bring us the box. Our waitress then came by and threw down the tab, as if to tell us to GTFO. \n\nI'm sorry, but I thought this was the service industry and customers were supposed to be treated with respect.

It's Thai in San Francisco, and my aunt recommended it and I saw good reviews on yelp. But my experience... I was disappointed. \n\nThe restaurant is decent. Clean, kind of weird lighting, but it wasn't packed and I liked that. But there were people there--Oh and I'm also that freak who hates walking through anywhere to get to the bathroom... So I didn't go. Because it's through the back/kitchen/whatever. \n\nThe servers came by every two minutes until we ordered. I just got here, I was tired from the plane, and I didn't know what I wanted. And they clearly wanted me to... Immediately. And didn't seem pleased when I didn't. However, when my water glass was empty, they were nowhere to be found, and came back without filling it. I didn't appreciate that. \n\nAnd the big drawback for me... The food. We got the pad kee mao I think--which I felt good about because I saw a tip on yelp saying it was good... We also got the pork larb with pork skin. \n\nSo, did I order wrong? Because the pad kee mao was weird. The green beans were barely cooked at all... even a little, and it had an odd sweetness to it. The larb... Run, don't walk away from this dish. It smelled real funky. My brother (whose hobby is cooking) can make larb at home 10x better than theirs. I don't know what I expected from the pork skin, but yuck, gross; I did not have fun. It was so offensive to my aunt that she put her serving back... I was hungrier, so I kept trying for a few minutes. \n\nNot sure what to say here. Was this great Thai food and I actually have never had good Thai food so I don't know? I would hate to make that assumption. Sorry all--I won't be back.", "author": "Tina S."}

Everything was rather bland. The soup at least had a contrast of sweet, savory with a little spice. The duck fried rice was second. Had some flavor from the duck, but the rice was rather mushy. The pad thai had the same issue. Was overcooked and a little on the sweet side. Maybe too much tamarind? The papaya salad was awful! I ask for this extra spicy and there was no spice. I also noted no peanuts, but there they were! Thank goodness it wasn't ground or crushed. Most of them were whole peanuts, so I could pick them out.\n\nVery disappointing dinner.

I ordered the Panang Curry in addition to other plates and when it came, 1) it was in a small bowl and 2) the bowl looked half filled.

Now what's an extra $2 but the plate was already 11.45 so to add more $ would total to ~$14 and I could not justify paying that for a small bowl of curry and some rice.

Chicken, peanut sauce over boiled veggies.\n\nI have them a low score because I was disappointed that they used expired tofu in my pad Thai. That was the chef not doing his job right. For the fried rice, I should have went across the street to eat the Bbq roast duck with rice and i would have felt I spent my moneys worth cuz I would have gotten way more meat. Chef only gave me about four thin slices of duck breast, the rest was just skin and a whole lot of grease. The peanut sauce chicken was just too watery.  I'm so disappointed at this place that I will stay away from this place and I will also tells my friends and family to stay away too.", "author": "pooky b."}

I remembered how hot it was served at the restaurant, perfect blend of flavors, and how well the noodles twirled around my fork for a perfect bite....those were the days! \n\nAnyway so the crushing climatic point of that story is that I'm allergic to shellfish now and found out a year ago, so my dreams of eating pad Thai everyday seemed to be over. So that's background why I don't eat Thai food anymore. I figured I might be bias in this review since you'll see I didn't order anything with seafood (a lot of popular Thai dishes have shellfish ingredients which make their flavors unique and outstanding!)\n\nI came to Chabaa today in attempt to experience some nostalgia of the day I first discovered how much I loved their pad Thai. Was going to eat a little bit literally for the memory of it. While looking at the menu I saw they had a vegetarian pad Thai so ordered that to save my self from anaphylactic shock tonight, the sweet Roti, and the fried chicken over fried rice. \n\nHere's my take: \n\nVeggie pad Thai: a little too sour for me, no fishy sauce flavor which I realize is the best part of the dish. I threw in some chili sauce since there wasn't a kick. No spice no salt...just sweet and mostly sour. It turned out to be just okay after I did that...\n\nFried chicken over fried rice: I've had this at Thai BBQ in South SF before but stopped going there because they started serving really stale rice. I tried the one at Chabaa and it had a nice crunch and seemed to be fried kind of like how sole is fried for fish and chips. The whole time I couldn't convince myself I was eating chicken and I swear it's like I was eating fried fish. The rice was perfect. I can't say this is my fave dish but the crunch makes it worthwhile since I love eating things that are crunchy lol.\n\nSweet Roti: kind of greasy. Just had some sticky (I'm assuming condensed) milk and sugar thrown on. It wasn't really easy to eat, perhaps a little too thick.\n\nI'm not sure if how I feel about Chabaa today is how I felt about them years ago. May now need to just put myself on a hunt for the perfect veggie Thai to revive my fanaticism for the noodle dish.\n\nNote that food was served very hot and the wait for all the food may have been 30 minutes. ~$30 for my whole meal + a Thai beer", "author": "Melanie G."}

There was a few boba places nearby but when we got here, everything around was closed. When we walked in, there was no one there except 2 servers who were busy watching tv. I saw some posters on the wall about special dishes. There was an Asian Chicken salad that looked pretty good- it was described to have boiled eggs, chicken, peanut sauce, and the veggies. My boyfriend ordered a pad see ew with chicken, there weren't much egg pieces in there, and we also got a chicken satay. I have to say that I loved the peanut sauce. The sauce for the chicken is also the same peanut sauce for the salad. The pad see ew came out first, pretty delicious, as we were famished. Next came the satay, definitely taste good hot, when I brought it home the next day, to eat with my salad since the salad chicken was the same, the chicken was pretty hard and stiff. Next my salad came. I was pretty disappointed by the salad. There was 1) no presentation 2) not much taste but the peanut sauce 3) it just looked like a dennys sad salad with some satay chicken on top of it which was pretty depressing. I wanted tea, and they gave me some weird tea that had the smell of a scented candle, smelled good, but I did not enjoy it, it taste like one of those tea they give you post thai massage in thailand. Don't get me wrong- im sure people enjoy it, it's just .. not my thing. I felt like with us being the only two customers there we should have been taken care of, but no.

I know that a lot of locals are drawn to Marnee because it has a lot of Michelin reviews, but the food we got at Chabaa was quite delightful. \n\nWe arrived as a group of 5 on a Saturday evening around 7:20. The restaurant was about half full. They had to move some tables around to accommodate our number, but they were very gracious about it. Chabaa is a favorite go-to Thai place for some of the people I was dining with, so we took our lead from them in terms of ordering. They highly recommended the roti (which is not on the menu) and the chicken wings. We got two orders of each and both were a hit (no leftovers)! The roti comes with a yellow curry chicken dipping sauce that has chunks of chicken, onions, and potatoes. There was more than enough curry and not enough of the roti, which they had cut up into triangles for dipping. The curry was good to use as a sauce on top of other dishes though. The wings were SOOOOOO good. They were crispy and hot and sweet and sticky and covered in basil leaves. Definitely a must order! I was so sad that I dropped my half eaten drummet. \n\nI ordered beef pad see ew as my main entree. The beef was tender, though there wasn't a ton of it. The dish came with chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli, which I liked. A friend ordered the vegetarian version that comes with tofu, and her dish also had cabbage and carrots, which I found a bit strange. The portion size was very generous, and I ended up taking half home. \n\nService was friendly and efficient. We never had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled.

Staff checked on us three times and we shrugged and said we were OK.  We ordered chicken noodle soup for our daughter.  We tried to confirm with staff that her soup was peanut-free as she is very allergic.  They said yes, but there was somewhat of a language barrier, so who really knows.  They let you select your type of noodle.  We ordered egg noodles and it came with vermicelli.  My son ordered pad Thai with chicken.  The chicken noodle soup was very vinegary as was the pad Thai.  My husband ordered a beef and veggie dish along with Brown rice.  Also very strong vinegar flavor.  The service was OK, but the better business decision by the staff would've been to offer to reduce our bill since 3 out of 4 in our party obviously did not enjoy their food.  My husband commented to the waiter that the flavor seemed \"off\".  Waiter seemed unconcerned and shortly after brought us the bill.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment.

Thing is, EVERYTHING ELSE was great -- I like the people there, and the service, atmosphere, prices, and the other ingredients in my dinner, which aside from the sketchy chicken, tasted great.\n\nChabaa, can I make a serious suggestion, please?\n\nEvery day, all you have to do is walk one block down the street and pick up a fresh roasted whole chicken from any of the nearby Chinese restaurants, you know, the ones with whole chickens and ducks hanging in the window.  Use that chicken instead of whatever it is you currently use, and your chicken dishes will instantly go from 2-star to 4 or even 5-star quality.\n\nThe people at Chabaa are really nice, and I believe many of their other dishes are tasty and well-prepared.  I waited 3 or 4 months, and ordered the same dish at least three times, before writing this review.  If you go here, I'd recommend ordering something else besides chicken, and dressing warmly (it's often FREEZING inside on a cold day!).", "author": "Richard A."}

Because it's cheaper and more authentic than Marnee Thai, there is hardly a wait, and the service here is good.  I've been a fan of Chabaa for many years now, and I've always been impressed with the quality and freshness of their food.  The only sad thing was when they raised the prices (50 cents), but hey--you can't stop that from happening with inflation in our economy!  Businesses need to make money after all.\n\nMy fave dishes here:\n-papaya salad - crisp and tart\n-hoi jor - delicious crispiness fused with chewy-inside\n-corn cakes (my friend Natasha H. loves these!)\n-green curry (in my opinion, best green curry in SF, much better than King of Thai's)\n-pad thai/see ew/kee mao -- all good\n\nJust a few tips on ordering at the restaurant:\n* If you want to get curry, get it at lunch because it comes with rice for free.  If you get curry for dinner, you have to pay extra for rice.\n* If you want starch for dinner, get noodles.  Noodles are the same price for lunch and dinner, so you might as well get the noodles for dinner--and the curry (with rice) for lunch.  \n\nThis place opens late--later than most restaurants in the general area (I think like 1-2am on some days?) so it's really great for a late night bite...kind of like back in Asia.  The food has been reliably good at all the different times I've went (lunch, late lunch, dinner, late dinner), so I highly recommend this place to anyone.

The Tom yum noodle soup was the first to arrive. I was about to serve the soup for me and my boyfriend when I found a little bug in the soup. I wasn't that surprised honestly because the restaurant had flies everywhere. So the server came over and took our soup and asked if we wanted a new one. Of course we did! After she left, another server asked us if we wanted a brand new order of the soup. I said yes because isn't that what they're supposed to do? \n\nThe tom yum noodle soup wasn't the worst part. The crab fried rice was served and I could already tell that it wasn't going to be good. The rice was made with jasmine rice but it was cooked with so much water that the fried rice looked more like dried out porridge than fried. I tasted it and automatically knew something was wrong. I called one of the three servers that night and told her that the crab tasted like it was frozen and left out for a couple days. (It smelled and tested spoiled) she looked at me like I didn't know what I was talking about and asked me if I wanted to change my order. I said no and we'll just eat the tom yum noodle soup. She didn't like that so she said she'll replace it and asked demanding us what we wanted. We decided on shrimp pad Thai because it's something that Thai restaurants shouldn't be able to mess up. But that was a mistake. \n\nAfter the pad Thai was served, our original server came by the table and said \"we tasted the crab and it tasted normal. It only tastes like that because we used canned crab\". This made me so angry. Why in the world would you use canned crab when Thai food is always represented to be made with fresh ingredients? Why???!!! I've had fresh crab before because I've lived in the Philippines for ten years where the wet markets have seafood caught the morning of so I know what fresh crab tastes like. \n\nNote to restaurant: if you run out of fresh crab that night just take it off the menu.

The flavor was OK but the texture was just so awful. I had to really dig for a piece of chicken and when I found one it was so dry! I didn't try the fried rice but I was told it was super greasy and just didn't have good flavor.

And on a Sunday night.\n\nI am uberly happy that this place opened til 1am since my friends and I stopped by after a long drive from Los Angeles back to San Francisco. We ordered phad thai, pineapple fried rice, and tom yum soup, which all were delicious! Just enough noodles. Just enough pineapples. Just enough spice and sour. And they have Sprite! That's important to note in my dinning experience here because I get easily motion-sickness and being in a car for 6-7 hours didn't help with my tummy. Sprite really helps minimize the nausea. Also, a neat surprise with the Sprite was the rose made out of the straw paper at the end of my straw. (Go see the picture!). \n\nAs for the service, it was great. Especially for a restaurant that's not a bar and opens til 1am, everyone was friendly and not grumpy. They also have take-out if you have a sudden craving for Thai food at midnight.\n\nUnfortunately, I live in Seattle. Time to scout out for something similar.", "author": "Vicky L."}

I get it every time I go there since there's not much else on the menu that looks tempting to me as a vegan. Although it does say on the menu that they will make most items without eggs and meat/fish sauce. The price isn't too bad. Could be a bit less.  \n\nUsually when we eat in for lunch, it's just us and maybe one or two other tables full. The several times I've been there, the waitresses have all been different, yet all of 'em easy on the eyes and nice. The short spinner chick is especially attractive.

Chabaa has been on Irving for a long time, and by no means is a \"hole in the wall\"; it's just an average Thai restaurant (that may have some questionable cleanliness practices). In terms of food, I had the duck larb, pumpkin red curry, and Pad Thai (the first two were on the \"Secret\" menu). The larb was strange - I understand that it's supposed to be like a duck meat/skin, Thai basil, and lime sour salad, but the flavors were just off and overpowering, to the extent that it felt like eating food doused in vinegar and Thai chili. The duck was also quite chewy - the skin wasn't crisp and the meat was rather stringy. The pumpkin curry was alright - while the pumpkin was cooked down quite well (rather soft), the curry itself was watery and thin - very little coconut milk or richness or flavor. The pad thai was okay; small shrimp portions as well as tofu; there were lots of sprouts (the ratio is nearly 1:1 in terms of sprouts to noodles) and the flavor was far too sweet. Overall, a disappointing meal - while everything looked appetizing, the flavors just did not gel really well at all.", "author": "Bobby W."}

This place has gone downhill and is no longer what it used to be. I will not be back (for a very loooong time at least).\n\nChabaa used to be reliable for good, hot, yummy Thai food, without a long wait and open even in the late hours. \n\nI gave you three chances. This past Friday was the last strike - we are done.\n\nSTRIKE ONE:\nI ordered the Silver Noodle Salad. It was so salty! I think the sauce was straight up fish sauce and lime. It was like biting into pure salt. The waitress delivered the other dishes we ordered and offered to remake my salad. Ok, it comes back just slightly less salty. I'm in a hurry, its still salty but I can deal with it. The shrimp was slightly 'weird' I can't name it, but I'm in a hurry to leave, took a couple bites, whatever. I ate at most half a plate and ended up having to go to the bathroom every hour of the night after - 2am, 3am, 4am, 5am, etc. \n\nSTRIKE TWO:\nRoast Duck Noodle Soup. There's bugs swimming in my soup. Probably from the veggies, I guess stuff like this can happen.. I let the waiter know and he took it back to remake it. Round Two: The noodles come back and there are STILL bugs in my soup! Really? I let the waiter know again and he takes it back. A waitress comes to me and asks if I want another one remade. No, I don't! Two times is enough. She takes it item off my tab..\n\nSTRIKE THREE:\nI used to love their Beef Noodle Soup. Did you get a new cook or something? My noodles sucked. Not even half way through my meal my rice noodles were breaking into little bits as I'm trying to pick them up with my fork and spoon. I can easily go to any other Thai place and my noodles will not do that. Ridiculous. Perhaps there were bugs in this broth too, just that I can't see it since the broth is not clear..\n\nI like that Chabaa is close to my house, but this is unacceptable.

No wait, almost empty other than one other party. Was given our menus, and glasses of water when first being serviced. After a good amount of time with the menu, the waiter took our orders, and answered my question regarding the spice level of the green curry. I asked if it was very spicy, according to the two chili marks compared to the red and yellow curry, and he said that it was. Hearing that it was very spicy, I ordered it because I love spicy food and green curry, and so together, it should have been a great meal. Because it was after lunch, the green curry was a la carte, and so I had to order a side order of rice to go along with it.\n\nOur food came out very quickly. My curry was first to come out and I was also given a nice large scoop of rice. My first sip of the curry, I was seeing how spicy \"very spicy\" was. I was actually disappointed. There was some heat, but not enough to be considered very spicy. I added a good amount of dried red pepper flakes into the curry to up the spicy level. The curry had a lot of bamboo, a good amount of green beans, and two medium slices of maybe a quarter of a Japanese eggplant (roughly 1 1/2 inches of eggplant that was cut into quarters and you're only given a half of the eggplant, if that makes any sense). I ordered the chicken, which looking back I regret now. The chicken was a little rough, a little too overcooked and it was not tasty, very tasteless actually.

Not bad but nothing special.\n\nGrilled Pork Neck with Jaew sauce - pretty damn good. pork neck has this particular texture to it that when grilled curls in to delectable bits. The sauce is pretty intense but since you're dipping you can have as much or little as you can handle.\n\nIssan Norther Style sausage - pork sausage with sticky rice fermented.

Delicious, especially with the dipping sauce, I was a little disappointed with only 3 small pieces for $5.25.\n\nAppetizer Combo - Great if you want a variety. You get about 2-4 pieces of each (tofu, prawns in a blanket, egg rolls, fish cakes), which is perfect to split among a small group.\n\nSom Tum (Papaya Salad) - Very tangy and a little spicy, interesting combination of flavors.\n\nPad Thai - Honestly, it didn't blow me away as it has at other Thai restaurants. I found it quite bland.\n\nPad Kee Mao - VERY VERY VERY SPICY! They're heavy handed with the Thai chili. I ask them to not make it milder, but still, it's sooo spicy. Order this dish with caution!\n\nCrab Meat Fried Rice - Good, but very simple with only a few ingredients: crab meat, onion, and egg. I recommend sharing this because it gets boring quickly.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice - Yummm... One of my favorites here! Only four pieces of shrimp is a little stingy though. Very interesting how they put fruit in it, such as pineapples and raisins.\n\nVegetable Fried Rice - Has a good variety of vegetables. I appreciate how they're concerned with customers' restrictions, for example, (if you're a vegetarian) they'll ask you if egg or fish sauce if alright. \n\nI've also tried some of their entrees and curries over rice. Overall, they're really good. Curries are can be a tad runny at times, but definitely have some heat. AND of course, what's a meal at a Thai restaurant without Thai Iced Tea?! Yummy!

I ordered a green curry while my friend ordered the yellow curry. Whenever I go to Thai restaurants, my to-go dishes tend to be a curry (Pumpkin curry for the win! They didn't have pumpkin curry.), pad thai, or something with eggplant in it. So, green curry it was. $7.95, which includes rice during lunch hours until 3pm. Relatively large meal. I couldn't finish. Curry wasn't disappointing but the rice was. Not the best rice I've had at a restaurant. Who rates the rice?!! Clearly, I do.\n\nSaved my stomach for mango with sticky rice ($4.50), and as mentioned above, it was yum! Sticky rice was sweet, warm, with sesame scattered atop. Not mushy. Mango has always been a great addition. \n\nGood meal.", "author": "Lily Z."}

Chabaa use to be a reliable, delicious, neighborhood thai restaurant but my last few visits have been terribly disappointing! I use to order dine-in and take-out from this restaurant at least twice a month, and then I had a temporary leave of absence for a school-friendlier budget of not eating out (as much) but as much as I hate to say it,  the past three visits have landed chabaa with only two stars in my book.\n\none star- bc it's LESS msg than marnee thai down the street\ntwo star- some of the friendly staff ( .... there was this one girl who I've never seen before tonight that was just too pushy despite the lack of customers around..... she tried to collect my plate while my fork was still in my hand?!)\n\nWhat I ordered:\n\npad thai with shrimp attempt #1- TOO salty. I think i had to wave down my waiter at least 10x to refill my water and gulp down all that sodium\n\npad thai with chicken attempt #2 (on a DIFFERENT visit)- waaaaaaaaay too salty! i had to task my waiter to bring me a bowl of rice so I could make it less salty. He simply glanced at me and said ok, brought out a bowl of white rice, and charged me for it. I guess I was just trying to be polite to not ask for a new plate but really, you're gonna charge me for a bowl of rice so I could drown out the sodium and not even offer to take it back? i guess it's my fault for not learning my lesson in attempt #1\n\nfried chicken over fried rice- still delicious but the quantity has definitely been down-sized.\n\ntom yun soup- I use to LOVE the tom yun soup here but last night was a total disappointment. MOSTLY clear broth with 8 mushrooms and even fewer pieces of chicken. Where's my lemongrass and onion? OR FLAVOR? :( overall, I feel like my tom-yun craving was not satisfied at all. \n\nbrown rice- $2/bowl which is average\n\nI wonder if the quality and quantity of food has decreased since they exploded around the city.... oh well... looks like I wont be returning anytime soon.", "author": "Patricia K."}

I ordered #19 (I forgot what it was called) and it was perfect! You have the option between various proteins, but I ordered the chicken (I think it was chicken breast) sauteed with green beans in a chili sauce and rice. It had just the right amount of heat (I like spicy things) so that I didn't have to add anything to it. The sauce was also good, so even though I like to avoid or minimize the amount of carbs I eat, I just had to use some of the rice to soak up the sauce. Also, I like that they offer you the choice between white and brown rice.\n\nService-wise, it took them awhile to get all of our dishes out. There were seven of us, but my food was luke warm by the time the final dish came out and mine wasn't even the first to arrive at the table!\n\nAnyways, since my dish was seasoned so perfectly, I was quite satisfied.

And, up until now my limited Yelp reviews have only been positive.   But, I think the Yelp system is broken and I must take a stand, man!\n\nHow Chabaa received four stars is beyond me.  Yelp, for me, is becoming useless and an enabler of poor food choices!  (Can I Yelp, Yelp??)\n\nMy husband and I ventured out from our normal Thai delivery because they only accept cash and last night we had no bills!  So, I yelped a few placed that delivered and had good reviews.  After reviewing a few, Chabaa had what we wanted (panang) and the best prices.  Sidebar:  Not sure what the complaints below are about the prices--they are cheap!  Anywhoot!  We placed our order of Tom Ka, Panang Curry with Pork, Egg Rolls and a side of Coconut Rice.  Bonus point:  you can order online.  The food arrived pretty quickly and was hot.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe panang curry was BLAND.  I have had curries that are too hot or too oily...but NO flavor?  It was not bad tasting...it was NO tasting.  The pork in the curry did have flavor and was a good texture, but overall very disappointing. \n\nThe Tom Ka was also lacking in the flavor department and was also super oily.  The mushrooms in the soup were oddly spongy and borderline inedible.  There were two sliced tomato pieces sadly bobbing in the broth like lost buoys, but no other veggies were found.   I feel like Tom Ka is a pretty common Thai staple and to get that wrong...is blasphemy!  \n\nPositives:  The coconut rice & egg rolls were very tasty.  The side dishes definitely out-flavored the main dishes.  Chabaa is like the Will & Grace of Thai Restaurants...you know...because Jack & Karen are really the best part of the show?   Anyone?  Anyone?\n\nIn summary:  If mediocrity is your bag...this is the place for you.  But if you demand more from your Thai food, go elsewhere.  In a city FILLED with so many amazing Thai choices DO NOT.

The food USED to be good, the service USED to be fantastic, and the experience USED to be awesome.  But my recent experience at Chabaa has been horrid, disappointing, but definitely eye opening.\n\nFood:\nLet me start by saying that their portion size has decreased significantly since I was here last (i.e., 3 mos. ago).  We had the salmon pumpkin curry, shrimp pra ga tiem, and duck pad see ew, and.  The curry was definitely over seasoned and the salmon was fishy, I don't think its fresh.  The shrimp pra ga tiem (garlic black bean sauce with shrimp) was very salty and it comprise of five shrimp that I have no reason to doubt its not the frozen variety.  Last but not least, the duck pad see ew.  The dish was very oily and salty, the duck was very chewy, and the entire plate dish itself seems extremely black.  As far as I can tell, they're either reusing old cooking oil and/or too much sauce. Neither would surprise me.  At any rate, we took a few bites and found the pad see ew to be inedible and told the waiter to send it back to the kitchen for the above reasons.  After everyone is almost done with their food, we had to check with them again to see if they're bringing the pad see ew back. To which they asked if we still want it.  We said nah because everyone is already done.\n\nAnd so the eye opening dining experience begins.\n\nService:\nThe wait staff was good, but I cannot say the same about the management.  When we got our bill, we saw the pad see ew still on our bill.  We kindly asked if it was a mistake.  We were quickly confronted by what seems to be either the daughter and/or wife of the owner.  I was immediately told that \n1) She tasted the dish and found nothing wrong with it.  (wtf?)\n2) Additionally, they do not refund dishes in which all the ducks were eaten and if a sizable portion of the dish has been eaten. (I suppose eating one out of the three pieces duck they gave us exceeded their \"refund\" threshold.  And I guess accusing your customers are trying to screw you out of $10s is a valid reason)\n3) I should have instructed the waiter to bring it back. (I'd assume its common sense for the waiter to confirm a credit and/or a new dish, guess I've been eating at places that are doing it wrong?)\n\nAfter a short 4 minutes of scenic exchange, I was promptly \"checked\" and I quote \"you better check your attitude\" by what seems to be a friend and/or employee of the restaurant, neither would surprise me.  \n\nTo conclude, I have no intentions of returning to this chain in the foreseeable future because the food quality, quantity, and overall service has fallen significantly and definitely do not justify the price they're asking.  Wait staff is attentive but could use training.  Management/old lady running the show will need to re-evaluate her approach to customer service and the service industry in general.  \n\nThe only question is, are you really going to threaten your already slightly unsatisfied customer to take it outside over a $10 duck pad see ew?\n\nI tipped 20% because the wait staff was attentive.", "author": "Sai Kiu H."}

They do these beautifully twisted straw wraps that are a special touch. I've never seen anything like it. One of the servers was sweet to show us exactly how it's done. It's definitely time taken to make the small things count. A plus in my book.  \n\nWe ordered the chicken red curry with brown rice & beef pad si ew, both extra spicy and DELISH!!! \n\nWe'll definitely be back and can't wait to explore the menu. Also, I noticed on their website that they have a \"secret thai menu\" that has some inviting dishes to try out.", "author": "Christina A."}

I've been here several times before and left satisfied every time. My little sister recommended me this place for the Green Curry since she knows it's my absolute favorite. She couldn't be more right! The green curry is super creamy here and has tons of coconut flavor (my fave on the menu!)\n\nWayne and I shared the Green Curry, Spicy Angel Wings, and something that could have been the Guay Tiew Nua Sub. We forgot the name of it...\n\nThe Spicy Angel Wings came in tiny portions. For the price of $7.75 for 5/6 wings, that was totally not worth paying for. Marnee Thai makes much better tasting ones imo...\n\nThe dish that Wayne ordered had Ground beef served on top of stir fried rice noodles and also topped with a fried egg. The beef looked a bit on the dry side but it wasn't. Everything was hot and steamy! Very good!\n\nOverall, I would come back again. I liked the Green Curry very much.

It's definitely my go-to take out or quick dine-in dinner spot. \n\nEat in: Yes, they deliver, but when you're ordering noodles like pad thai or pad si yu, you need to eat in - otherwise the sauce will likely be all absorbed and the noodles a little dry by the time you get them. Completely forget fried foods for delivery - soggy. Not their fault, it's delivery.\n\nThat said, these time-sensitive noodle dishes are delicious fresh out of the kitchen, piping hot, flavorful, and exactly-what-you-want-right-now. Add some crispy appetizer, and a thai iced tea with a little wrapper sculpture on top of the straw, and you've got a casual \"this is how we Wednesday night\" date spot.\n\nTake out: Now's the time for thai curries! My favorite is always Panang curry, my boyfriend's is yellow curry chicken. Couple orders of rice and you're good to go. New favorite: Pad ma kuer also travels well.\n\nThey only deliver to certain areas of the city, and depending on who answers the phone, sometimes they come to the Inner Richmond for free, for $3, or flat out will not. It's worth the gamble, and it's easy enough to scooter across the park myself if I strike out.\n\nVegan Note** They do say they can make some dishes vegan by excluding fish and oyster sauce. Did this once, and I don't recommend it unless you NEED to, or have a magical flavor sauce you plan on adding yourself. Turns out fish and oyster sauce is pretty important for the nostalgic Thai flavor I'm craving. But it is an option, and may work with some dishes better than others.\n\nThanks Chabaa!", "author": "Stephanie R."}

However, we noticed Chabaa was open and had to give it a try!\n\nBunny and I were happy that we found something that was open at that hour. We parked and head over. As we entered, a server greeted us and asked us to take a seat anywhere. She was friendly and polite. There was a good variety of food. As we looked through the menu, we decided on the Yellow Curry Chicken, Omelet with Minced Pork and Pad Kee Mao.\n\nThe Yellow Curry Chicken arrived first, which came with a bowl of steamed rice. The curry flavor wasn't extremely spicy,but it was a bit mild. There was also onions and potatoes (my favorite). It was a good portion and we enjoyed it. Next that came out was the omelet. The size was larger than expected and we were unable to finish. However, it had a lot of flavor and I liked it. Last was the stir fried flat rice noodles that came with green beans, bell peppers, Thai chili and sweet basil. Our choise of meat was beef.

Namely, the corn cakes, pad thai, and chicken yellow curry w/brown rice. MmmMmm!\n\nCorn cakes - Corn fried in batter and shaped into imperfect little circles. Served with a sweet and spicy chili dipping sauce and pickled cucumbers. It's delicious! \n\nPad Thai - It's  pad thai! Don't know what else I can say except that Chabaa sure cooks up a tasty one! I always like to add extra peanuts to mine. Yummy :)\n\nChicken yellow curry - Creamy, yellow curry with chicken & potatoes. The coconut milk makes everything taste so buttery and rich. Love it! Rice is included at lunch time; however, during dinner hours it is a $1 extra. So, I usually try to only order this during lunch hours. \n\nOther dishes I like here are the pad see ew (it's not eww...promise!) and the pad pra ram. Pad see ew is a lot like chow fun, but it's just a little sweeter in my opinion. Gotta try this one! The pad pra ram is meat and veggies covered in a delicious peanut sauce.

We went on a rainy Sunday night and the place began to fill up fast by seven o'clock. \r\n\r\nSome might say, Who needs another Thai restaurant in San Francisco? But one visit to Chabaa will have you rethinking that sentiment. In a neighborhood know for its cuisine but certainly not for its atmosphere or attention to detail in design, Chabaa stands out prominently. Look for the restaurant's cheerful lime-colored sign- it's hard to miss.\r\n\r\nInside, the walls are painted in sumptuous, warm colors. Everything from the plates to the wall decorations has thought put into it. The stellar branding job at Chabaa is evident throughout- from the sign to the menus and all points in between. This is uncommon, and I think it works for this restaurant. \r\n\r\nYou will likely be greeted by friendly manager and partner Pawaree Sriprasom, for whom this restaurant is clearly a labor of love. She'll guide you toward a cold Thai beer to start your meal off right.\r\n\r\nBut make no mistake about it, for all its prettiness, the charm of Chabaa most certainly lies with the food. Start with the delicious corn cakes. Dish the sweet and spicy cucumber salad atop the cakes for maximum enjoyment. The tom ka is an excellent balance between the lime and coconut milk flavors that make this soup  a Thai staple. If its on special, the pumpkin curry made with kabocha squash is definitely worth ordering. \r\n\r\nAnd what's more, Chabaa is open until one in the morning!", "author": "Miriam W."}

It's got the more interesting dishes and it has the english translation, so people shouldn't have a problem with it. \n\nThere's a certain serenity to this restaurant. Maybe it's the high ceilings, the warm color of the walls, the red lighting near the windows, or the pretty hanging lamps, but the interior of the restaurant comes together to create a nice ambiance. The service was also exceptional. Genuinely friendly and efficient, they're good at what they do. \n\nThe food is better than most other Thai places we've been to in the city. With the added allure of the Thai menu, we chose to bypass the standard pad thai and curries to try some different things.\n\nFirst up: papaya salad, spicy wings. The papaya salad was very refreshing with its julienned papaya strips mixed with fresh vegetables and tossed in a slightly acidic/slightly sweet fish sauce-accented dressing. Very good, but might have preferred a slightly more flavorful dressing, and  on the menu it says it's prepared with crab, but I didn't really see any crab it it. The spicy wings were covered in a delicious sauce and were very juicy yet crispy on the outside. I really liked them with the fried basil leaves. \n\nEntrees: Pineapple fried rice, BBQ beef. Pineapple fried rice was good, and surprisingly not oily like most other fried rice dishes you get at other Thai/Chinese restaurants. Big chunks of pineapple, succulent shrimp, cashews, a hint of curry. I sometimes like a little more curry flavor, but I was ok with this one. BBQ beef was off the Thai menu. Can't remember what it's called, but it's basically bbq beef strips with a spicy tamarind sauce. It was delicious. The beef was so tender but well grilled. Simple, but something that really hit the spot. The spicy tamarind sauce was a good accompaniment, but I thought the menu said it came with rice, but it came with something like a salad with some iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Kind of strange since there's really nothing to eat it with. Still, the beef was really good. \n\nDessert: I don't often get dessert at asian restaurants, but when I see sticky rice and mango, it's hard to resist. We got it and i love the sticky rice, but the mango wasn't that good. Not really ripe enough. But love that sticky rice with coconut milk. \n\nOverall a great choice for Thai food in this area of the outer Sunset.

Apparently there's one on Irving as well.\n\nMy family and I were in SF to ring in the new year. We were looking for a place to have dinner that didn't have a multi-hour waiting list (hard to find on New Years). When I first saw this place on Yelp (4 stars, one $) I thought it was a mistake. I called and found out that they only had a 15-30 minute wait, so I told my group of 8 that we were going to walk over and have Thai tonight. \n\nThis place is small and a little out of the way, but there were people standing outside which is a good sign. I put my name on the list and we stood outside. The hostess seemed a bit grumpy and I was worried, but I worried for nothing. It only took 10 minutes and they were able to set up a table for us. The entire time we were there, there was a line and people waiting outside. \n\nWe are a family of foodies and without exception, everyone loved the food here. Each dish was very well done and brought to the table very fast. We couldn't believe the tiny kitchen (up front by the window where you can see the cooks) were turning out the dishes so fast! We ordered a lot and also had 2 desserts!\n\n1. Thai iced tea - as good as expected and a nice touch was the flower they made out of the paper wrapping for the straw. \n2. Papaya salad - very fresh ingredients and excellent dressing. \n3. Calamari salad - calamari was cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n4. Tom Yum Soup - great broth with rich flavor. One of the best I've had.\n5. Roast duck appetizer - wife said it was one of the best she's had and she's SUPER critical and a gourmet chef.\n6. Green curry - Lots of ingredients (Chicken, bamboo, green and red peppers and onions. Just the right mix of sweet and spicy. It's great on top of white rice.\n7. Pad Thai - the old standby, done extremely well with lots of sprouts.\n8. Crab fried rice  - OMG! Never had this before and everyone wanted more!\n9. Beef flat noodles - Had a great smokey flavor to it. Never had it done this way before but it was really tasty. We wanted to lick the plate.\n10. Fried bananas with Pineapple ice cream - once again, we devoured it. The ice cream had chunks of pineapple in it and was not too sweet.\n11. Sweet crispy pancake with pineapple ice cream - this didn't last 2 minutes after it arrived. Everyone took a bit and we almost ordered more!\n\nAll during the meal, we had 3 people wait on us. All were super pleasant and very helpful when we asked questions or needed more napkins or water, etc.\n\nAfter all this food, we walked out of there with a bill of only $116 including the gratuity! This is dinner for eight (8) people!  It was a really good value. I'd come back here in a second. We had lunch by the wharf earlier that afternoon and spent almost $170. Getting a meal like this for 8 people near Union Square for this price was amazing.\n\nOK, if you can't tell we really liked this place.

(no offense)\n\nThe waiters were really nice and pleasant. The girl was cute too. I ordered a thai tea, shrimp pad thai, and crispy chicken over fried rice. My little big sis ordered pad see ewe while my cuzn got the yellow tofu curry. I've had alot of thai food around my area but I've got to say Chabaa wins hands down. The flavors were not overpowering or bland. It was just right and they give a generous amount of food. We all shared and STILL had leftovers. I really wish there was a Chabaa around my area. I hate driving all the way to the city to get authentic food but aye, Ill do it if I have to.", "author": "Fran N."}

We got the appetizer sampler (4 pieces each of fish cakes, eggrolls, and fried tofu. 2 pieces of fried shrimp), young papaya salad, morning glory (ong choy), basil chicken, and my favorite - penaeng curry. \n\nI thought the appetizer sampler could have been stronger, but it's a nice thing to start with. The veggie dishes were both good and it was nice to have both a raw veggie dish and a cooked one. The basil chicken was delicious and I loved the eggplant in the dish, but I couldn't focus too much on it because the curry was so darn good!

It came in 45 minutes!! That is an amazing feat in itself. We live across the sunset too.\n\nI ALWAYS order #36. What is it called? I have no idea. The name of the dish is too complicated for my simple mind to remember, but it is ground beef over noodles with a fried egg on top. Doesn't sound healthy? Because it isn't... this dish is NOT for the faint of heart - but damn is it delicious. I have yet to find this dish elsewhere and I always order it when eating here. In fact, we ordered two of these dishes.\n\nWe also ordered a soup (I don't know which one because my friend picked it) that had coconut milk and lemongrass in it. It was also delicious and made for a tasty snack leftover. Definitely one of the better thai soups I've had.\n\nPad see ew. Yes, it is one of the most common dishes in all of thai foodom... but damn, does this place do it right. The only place that I've had better pad see ew is in Berkeley at Thai Basil. My friends, who rarely eat Thai, loved this dish as well. They really hit this out of the ballpark.\n\nIn addition, we got yellow curry which was satisfactory but doesn't scream exemplary to me. I would definitely eat it again but it doesn't make me go bonkers like their other dishes.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, we ordered the pineapple fried rice. This is one of the better pineapple fried rice dishes I've had. They include some dried fruits and nuts in the dish, which I found to be weird at first but have learned to embrace and desire it. This dish is definitely tasty and sometimes I even order this instead of #36. \n\nOverall, one of the better thai places in the sunset.

I don't think she really spoke english, but the server explained that she was the owner of the restaurant and the watermelon wasn't on the menu, she was just eating it haha. Oh well! But a few minutes later, a server came by with a plate of watermelon slices, complements of the owner! I was so surprised and definitely impressed by how thoughtful and generous they were!\n\nAs for the food, we ordered the pad prik king (beef with green beans in chill paste sauce) and rice noodles with ground beef and an egg on top. We didn't really like either of the beef in our dishes... the ground beef was strangely kind of elastic and the stir fried beef was similar. But I loved how they cooked the rice noodles (slightly burnt in wok style) and the egg was perfect with the dish!

I mean, Thai food in general is near and dear to my heart, and I can't say that I've really had Thai food I did not immensely enjoy in all my time in San Francisco.  Should I be so generous with the very first Thai restaurant I review?\n\nSo I thought about the food.  I thought about their tofu satay appetizer with peanut sauce.  I thought about how it was pretty much the heartiest tofu I have ever had, and how it's firm, and chewy, and seasoned just right.  Then I thought about their curries, and all their diverse vegetables just swimming in a thick and creamy sauce.  I thought about how tender the pumpkin is, and how the tofu is soft and melty, so you know they're no one-trick tofu-pony.  I thought about the euphoric gleam in my boyfriend's eyes as he consumed a gigantic plate of spicy, tender pork shoulder (I tried it, you know, just to be sure).\n\nAnd then my thoughts turned to calories, and the devil on my shoulder said \"You know, all that coconut milk and all those pan-fried noodles, they'll catch up with you.\"  But then I remembered that the food at Chabaa is some of the healthiest around.  For so many dishes that are sauteed, everything feels so clean and fresh!  And I thought about how insanely easy it is for me to make healthier choices at Chabaa - almost everything on the menu will be happily turned into a vegetarian dish, and it doesn't feel like a cop out!  The flavors and textures are all still so remarkably intricate that you can really tell they put a lot of care into their food.\n\nSpeaking of which, hey!  I should think about their kind and friendly waitstaff and the way that, even when they're rather busy the food comes out with surprising promptness.  Or about the multitude of space heaters they have, to keep people like me warm in what seems like a sea of perpetually-chilly San Franciscan restaurants.  (Many are cold, but few are frozen.)\n\nAnd then I thought about how we got two entrees (specials, no less!) that yielded leftovers, an appetizer, and a Thai iced coffee for $30.  For dinner.  Yeah.

So in-the-line, so to speak..and it made me fell all nice inside, and it looked good too. The quiet softness about the place made me feel right.  It was also literally very quiet, great place to have a peaceful meal.

When the waitress realized I was Thai, she said they had a Thai menu. I was like nah i can read English just fine but then she said \"No, no I mean we have dishes that are catered to a Thai person.\" And  I instantly looked and my buddy and we said at the same time \"SECRET MENU\". Whoa this is like In and OUT.  There are so many different items that were on there like Issan sausages (sai krok issan) and Northern sausages (sai oor). They have Som tum bhu LAOs style which is not very common- the stinkier..the better. They made the som tum so hot that my eyes were watering. They even had the Yum nam salad..(nam is a fermented sausage). Pork shoulders with nam prik and roasted rice.\n\nThe menu is in Thai so you may want to bring someone who can read it or take thai lessons. The flavors are so strong so maybe thats why they don't have these dishes on the regular menu and the heat is like White man die hot!! Thai people don't like wasting food so they will make it less spicier for foreigners. If you can handle the heat, you can  politely ask to add more chili because it's harder to go from spicier to less spicy.", "author": "Geo D."}

The interior of the restaurant is nice and clean. The staff is pretty nice , they get you the things you need. The quality of the food is good for the price and the taste is good as well. I really don't have any complains about this place. Another thing that is good about this place is that it closes late and if you need a late night dinner this is the place to go . I've had their roast duck noodle soup, the chicken noodle soup,  and roast duck fried rice.  All of them were delish, except the fried rice was a little greasy.

My dining experience has been later in the evenings and I have not yet ordered from their takeout or delivery menu. \n\nWith that being said, I also found the service to be more then adequate if not a little overbearing at times. The wait staff is excellent but like I said, I tend to go during off hours so I can't say what the earlier shift is like.  For me I've had people help me figure out what I'd eaten in the past that was totally yummy but couldn't remember the name of.\nThe picture menu helps. \nOne young lady even showed us how they make the roses out of the straw wrapping when we asked. \n\nThe meal portions are acceptable but not overflowing. \nThe menu is the key to this place.  For me, their strong points are their salads, appetizers and their duck. Their soups and noodles are fine and their Thai iced tea is not overly sweet, which I like. \n\nThey stay open until 1AM. Need I say more? \n\nThe only things open later into the evening on a weekday, that I know of, are some yogurt shops, a crepes place, some donut shops and Chabaa.  And Chabaa stays open longer then all of them. \n. \nThe space is long and skinny with a mix of modern and traditional decor. The wood gives it a nice warm feeling. Because of the long and skinnyness (is that a word?) of the restaurant, it helps to be assertive when getting the inital attention of the wait staff.\nThe kitchen is on the other end of the restaurant and it would just be weird to have the staff hanging around the door in such a narrow space but once seated, everything is good. \n\nIn summary: I like this place.

Parking took a little time, but found something within a couple blocks.\nThis is a tough review because I was torn between the good, the bad, and the ugly...\n     The good was the \"secret Thai menu\" is translated into English and available seemed more of a word of mouth gimmick.  We chose the BBQ pork back with tamarind sauce was super delicious.  \n     The corn cakes are large and a fantastic mix of corn and batter, great appetizer and starter with the Thai Iced Tea with an origami rose was a neat touch.  The Chicken Pad Thai was good, but needed an extra kick, ask for the hot sauce, they will bring a tray of 4 jars of red pepper flakes, garlic chili sauce, vinegar infused with jalapeno, and crushed peanuts.\n    Service was good, my friend from out of town was late 30 min, they allowed us to sit at a table without making a big fuss.  Water was refilled without asking.\n    The bad was the fish cakes looked like something you get out of the frozen section of Ranch 99, uninspired taste and McDonald's sausage patty texture was just not good for $7 for 4 is a pass.\n    The ugly was the Thai beef fried rice looked like a 5 yr old kid made it.  The rice was too wet with the consistency of wet concrete that glued to the spoon when trying to get a serving on the plate. It had maybe 5-6 pieces of thin sliced small pieces of beef, barely any veggies and not worth the $9.\n      The bill was under $60 for a table of 4 was a really good deal.  I like really good deals, but the only thing that was memorable was the pork back.  Everything else was just lacking a little in full Thai flavor kick.

When I found the place PACKED last Friday night, however, I decided that I was too hungry to wait, and thus, convinced my date to take a risk on Chabaa Thai.\n\nAll I can say is: What a pleasant surprise!\n\nTo my tastes, the food was just as good as Marnee's (we tried the pad see-u and the masaman curry), but the service was far superior. While I have frequently found the waitstaff at Marnee to be  rather  rude (I hate  feeling pressured to order the most expensive items!),  the servers at Chabaa were warm and friendly. And while Marnee often tries to rush me out the door, Chabaa didn't seem to mind our lingering for almost 2 hours over our 1 course meal!\n\nMy only complaint is that our waitress had absolutely ZERO knowledge of the wine they serve. Being a wino and having noticed wine glasses on several tables, I was suprised to find out that the restaurant not only had no wine list, but had also failed to educate its waitstaff in the difference between whites and reds. Amusingly, once the information was retrieved, Chabaa turned out to have a pretty decent selection of standard labels (BV, Kendall JAckson, Ecco Domini, etc)., and the chianti we ordered did pair quite nicely with the masaman curry :)\n \nOverall, however, my experience at Chabaa was quite enjoyable.

The Tom Yum soup does taste like the soup base of the silver shrimp MaMa packages, but more sour, which was too much for my liking but I heard this is how the soup usually is.\n\nSo overall the food was good, we could have even disregarded the soup and eaten 3 dishes among all five of us and we all would have left satisfied. This place can be cheap if you eat family-style, but if not, you'll be paying about $10-$11 depending on how much you tip (with no drink).", "author": "Alice C."}

It's about as cold inside as it is outside, and this is in the middle of the sunset on a winter evening. \n\nThe waiters and service were average. Some simple requests were apparently challenging for these guys. We asked for straws for our glasses of water since the cups were questionable in cleanliness. Our server came back with one. We asked for a couple more. Twice...\n\nNow on to the food. This is a real doozy. The name of the restaurant itself is  Chabaa \"Thai\" Cuisine. Nothing the three of us at our table ordered remotely resembled Thai food. I eat Thai food on occasion but often enough to distinguish, authentic Thai and good Thai. This was neither. One order at our table was Tom Yam soup. It is supposed to be spicy, fragrant with hints of seafood tastes. What we got was a red-looking beef broth with soup noodles. Not going to be overly critical here, but isn't that Pho? You know, Vietnamese cuisine? Next at our table was an order of Pad Kee Mao. It is a basil-laden, spicy stir fry of flat rice noodles with a combination of many unique spices to the country of Thailand. My friend commented that it was rather bland, not so spicy and boring. It reminded him of Chow Fun. That's Chinese... I had the Pad Thai. One simple question I will pose to offer as evidence of my claims: where were the peanuts? Pad Thai is a peanut-sauce based dish. There were no crushed peanuts, no peanut oil, no peanut sauce in general. Disappointing. \n\nAs a restaurant, it's fine, deserving of 3 stars even. As a \"Thai\" establishment? 1 star.

We were seated immediately (though the restaurant was busy on a Friday night, and parties larger than two might have to wait for a table).  We ordered two Singhas (~$4 each) and an appetizer of fried tofu ($6).  The waitress was friendly and prompt; our appetizer arrived shortly after she brought our beers.  The fried tofu was a large portion and tasted great with its accompanying sweet peanut sauce, but the sauce had to be rationed to leave enough for each piece.  We couldn't finish the entire appetizer; unless you go with a larger group, you might want to stay away.  It tastes fairly awful when reheated the next day, and overall is less sweet and tender than the fried tofu in their other dishes.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered Chicken Panaeng Curry ($7.70, rice costs extra during dinner) and Prawn Pad Thai ($8.50).  The portions were massive, filling, warm, and delicious.  They also arrived quickly, especially for a Friday night.  There was plenty of moist chicken in the Panaeng Curry, and my companion and I cleaned our plates.  The Pad Thai, which had a somewhat small quantity of prawns, was so huge (and we were so stuffed with curry) that we had to package most of it for the next day.  It was still delicious when reheated, unlike the fried tofu.  We will certainly return, especially on chilly, damp evenings.", "author": "Kate T."}

Except that the amount of (Chinese) broccoli they put in the dish would have been appropriate only as a garnish. If I hadn't had it much better every other time I've ordered it elsewhere I wouldn't complain. Aside from the lack of green the noodles were mediocre and I wouldn't eat em unless I was really hungry, but that's not the hat I wear when I'm critiquing food.  \n\nThe clincher was the girl's attitude when I called in disappointed and hoping for some explanation (I ordered take out and picked it up).

Maybe the food is different if you eat it there? I tried three different dishes, and they ranged from okay to nasty.\n\nThe fresh spring rolls were wrapped in some kind of unusual wrapper, not the rice paper wrapper I am used to. This wrapper was thick, stiff, and dry, and each roll had a line of mustard on top, which to me really clashed with the dish. Perhaps this is a regional variation of the delicious fresh spring rolls I'm used to, but even the mustard couldn't save these from deathly blandness.  The vegetarian yellow curry was fine. The predominant flavors there were sweet and ginger, never a bad combo. The vegetarian Pad See Ew was revolting. Overly salty, heavy sauce with no complexity to it at all. Not too greasy, which is always helpful for this dish, but just entirely dull and kind of lumpish. I ended up throwing most of it away - there was just nothing appealing about it that might entice me to consume it.\n\nThere's so much Thai delivery out there these days that I've been researching, trying to find one that really delights, but I think I may stick to the already known solid-3-star places for a while, not wanting to risk another disappointment like this one.", "author": "Scrumptious S."}

We  had the cashew chicken and it was horrible. They say saut\u00e9ed sliced chicken but it was breaded chicken. Actually the chicken was so tough it tasted like cartilage. I was shocked it was breaded. It was like they ran out of chicken so they decided to fool us with breaded bread. Never going to eat here again. I've been to many Thai restaurants and this was the worst. Pad Thai noodles tasted like yesterday's noodles. Chicken Tom Ka was weak. Chicken was very chewy and broth was too light.

Chabaa Thai Cuisine.  Good thing.  I like this place a lot.\n\nRight in the middle of the block.  They serve all the different kinds of thai food that you could want.  I like that they like to use some chinese ingredients like chinese sausage in their BBQ Pork Friend Rice.\n\nI decided to try their paenang chicken curry.  I was told it was medium spicy.  Now, most people go with SPICY as, HOT.  Or HOT HOT HOT.  You know what i mean.  Well, this spicy is that amount of FLAVOR.  I LOVE THAT.  When the flavor is incredible you want spicy.  You want it medium Spicy, this place doesn't burn your tongue.  So if you consider spicy as Hot, then you aren't looking for this.\n\nI like the prices too.  Its actualy cheaper than most of the Thai Places i've been to.\n\nTHE BEST THING?  One of the girls is very helpful and speaks really good english.

They used to be cheaper when they just started and now the prices seem too much. Even though it's just 50 cents more to each dish, when you add it up to certain dishes it's too expensive. An example would be the appetizer Prawn in a Blanket, which costs more than $7 for six fried shrimps and some sauce.  That's more than a buck a piece!! It tastes great but $1.25 for a shrimp?? Plus if you compare the prices of appetizers to main entrees, they're pretty much the same prices.  I mean, aren't appetizers supposed to be cheaper??\n\nI have to admit their food tastes great but with the prices they offer, I think I rather go to Marnee Thai.

Even then, whenever I do make trips up, Chabaa is one of those stops you HAVE to make when you are in SF.  It's became my instant favorite Thai restaurant.\n\nJust walking in, the decor is simple, and very clean.  The place is well lit, and has a very friendly environment.  My first visit was probably like no other.  The waitress welcomed us like we were frequent patrons of theirs. I admitted it was my first time, and asked for food suggestions.  After knowing what types of food I liked, she made several suggestions that I still order today.  I asked her how spicy she can make my curry.  Explaining how I loathe curry that is too spicy, and no flavor, and vice versa,  She explains the process of how they create their dishes, and how it can maintain flavor, AND spiciness.  I was skeptical until the dish came out, and she definitely delivered her promise.\n\nAll of them are extremely friendly, and even long hours of work, they're laughing along with you.  I like most, is how they're not afraid to ask how the food was.  They stop by once in a while and will ask if everything was alright, or if it met our expectations.  You know it's a good restaurant when the waiters are not afraid to ask.\n\nThe menu consists of a wide selection to chose from.  I generally dislike menus with pictures, because often times, businesses misrepresents them, HOWEVER, the pictures on Chabaa's menus actually looked exactly like the ones in the picture, (if not better).\n\nThe food is always fresh, and does not disappoint.  I love how flexible they are too.  Sometimes I bring friends who are picky, and want to modify a dish.  They're happy to make that special dish for them.  Very quick, and very dependable.\n\nDefinitely a place I will always be going back to.", "author": "April W."}

I really wanted fried rice and so I tried the BBQ pork fried rice and got the vegetarian pad thai. The service was good. (I feel like all Thai restaurants have good service.) When the barbeque pork fried rice came it was in a small portion. I couldn't see any BBQ pork but saw a lot of chines sausages. The rice was pretty oily and I was fearing for the added fat in my body. If you are \"watching your weight\" you should ask for less oil because the amount of oil is just scary. Usually I would get Pineapple fried rice and that dish isn't as oily as this one but maybe the oil was from the sausages. I also thought it was pretty salty, especially the eggs. The sliced bbq pork was good. Then came the vegetarian pad thai. The difference between vegetarian and regular pad thai (chicken/shrimp) is that the vegetarian one was more salty. I liked how they put a lot of veggies in it but it was lacking in ground peanuts -it seems like there was one teaspoon of peanuts in there. I don't know if it was the timing that made these dishes less than admirable but I was not very satisfied with the taste of food. I am not even picky but I think they should be more careful with seasoning the food. The thai iced tea was very sweet. I think their long hours at work may have impaired their work because it seems as if they just add extra salt, sugar, and oil to make them \"taste better\". I should have went to king of thai.", "author": "Carmen L."}

After 1+ hours of driving around, my friends decides to head to Irving and 9th and just pick a restaurant.  Needless to say, we couldn't find parking AGAIN.

The noodles were flavorful (in chinese, there was enough \"wok hay\")  and portions were plentiful.  I scarfed down the whole meal just bc it was so good.  I also tried my friend's pumpkin yellow curry and that was also delicious.  The service was great since the waiter kept refilling our water without asking. \n\nHere's the reason why I gave three stars:  Despite the fact that the food was good and the service great, my friend ordered the Tom Yum Soup and found a bug in her soup.

My meal-mate, normally a vegetarian, should have been in veggie heaven with a menu that says you can any dish with the three basic meats or veggies and tofu; but in the end he succumbed to the lure of the mixed seafood red curry, and did approximately the same amount of damage to his plate as I did to mine.\n\nAs a huge Singha fan, it doesn't hurt me that they don't have a full bar but only wine and beer.  The food is excellent.  The service is friendly and attentive but leaves you space to relax and enjoy your meal.  My server was extremely helpful.  I asked about the spiciness of the green curry, which had two peppers beside it on the menu instead of one; she probably thought a blue-eyed dirty blond would be wanting something soft, and said they could tone it down.  I demurred, and we talked until she offered me a scale of one to seven.  I said, \"Five\", and was a little surprised to hear her say \"Really?\"  Was I going too far?

The Red curry was good, not too hot for me, but I didn't like the bamboo shoots that were in it. The Guay Tiaw Lord was okay, I'm partial to it since I don't like calamari. But what made me order from them again was the serving size! I got this tall cup of curry, pretty much full to the brim. It was a great price for the amount you get.\n\nSo because I knew it was a good deal, we ordered out from them again, this time getting the Yellow curry with chicken ($6.50) and the Pad Si-Yu with chicken (stir fried flat rice noodles with egg, Chinese broccoli and soy sauce, $7.25). This time, we didn't get rice because we could just make it ourselves. I was looking forward to my tall cup of Yellow curry so when I opened it, I was surprised to find it only halfway full! I was REALLY bummed (since this dish was YUM!) and wondered if the decreased portion size had anything to do with not ordering rice. The Pad Si-Yu was YUM as well.

Our waitress was SUPER attentive, filling our teas promptly and clearing finished plates equally fast.

From the secret menu I chose the seafood curry custard (ho something-or-other). The waiter asked mild, medium or spicy. When it came it was on the spicy side of mild, though I can't blame him. Next time I'll ask for medium-plus. There really needs to be a spiciness calibration scale that can be used between restaurants, like\n\n\"If your place's spicy is Thai House Express Tenderloin spicy then I want medium, but if it's Regent Thai's spicy then I want extra spicy.\"  Or maybe \"one-half of Thai spicy.\" Or something like that.\n\nStill it had a nice, fresh, curry-ish flavor with a nice underburn. It wasn't \"custard\" custard a la the Japanese chawan mushi, but there were agglomerations of custardy egg here and there. Anyway, it was flavorful and a reasonable portion and I would order it again.\n\nI made a nutritional misstep with dessert. I incorrectly assumed that roti with coconut ice cream wouldn't come with the sweetened condensed milk. It does. I must admit a guilty pleasure in enjoying condensed milk's creamy sweetness, so of course I didn't try to scrape it off or anything, and it was really good with the ice cream. But I think it's a bit overboard and if I were to order it in the future I'd specifically order it with ice cream only. Just saying.\n\nPleasant service. Do bring a sweater if it's cold out, I was fine with one and not chilly, but a coat would not be needed.

So tonight's choice, hubby's request, was Chabaa. I place an order online at 7:10. The website said to allow UP TO 45 minutes for delivery. So I wait. And wait. And wait. 8 pm. Nothing. I am very hungry at this point. I call them. \nMe: Hi. I placed an order online about 50 mins ago. I hope it went through. My food is still not here.\nChabaa-What is your address?\n I tell them. \nChabaa-Your food is on the way, the driver already left.\nMe-Great, thanks a lot. \n8:15. I am super hungry. Still no food. I call again.\nChabaa- I told you, your order is on the way. Please be patient. We have a lot of orders today.\nMe-Ok......Do you know about how long?\nChabaa-The driver should be there any minute. He left a while back.\n8:35 STILL NO FOOD! At this point I am ready to kill somebody!\nI call back.\nMe-It's me again, where is my food????\nChaba-YOUR ORDER NEVER WENT THROUGH. It happens sometimes, technical issues with the website. Let me take down your order again, and the driver will deliver it as soon as it's ready!\nMe-Are you f***ing kidding me??? It never went through? You couldn't have checked when I called the first 3 times?\nChabaa-Sorry. Let me just take your order again.\nMe-No thanks. I will order from somewhere else. And do expect a review on Yelp about this experience.\n9:00 pm. My phone rings. It's the manager of Chabaa, asking if she can do anything to make the whole situation better.\nI say no, I already ordered from Marnee Thai and will have my food in 10 mins (hubby drove to get it).\nMoral of the story? Don't get delivery from this place. At least don't place your order on their website. (Sri Thai's website works perfectly each time). But if you don't want delivery, why in the world would you choose this place over Marnee Thai???", "author": "Alina S."}

I've explored most of the menu and have yet to run into a dish I dislike.  The only knock I can think of is their lack of spiceyness on certain dishes (but I just think they're trying to be nice).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-14", "description": "If I went to this place to sit down and eat I might have given it 4 stars, but since I always order delivery, and it is honestly the best delivery I can get that isn't pizza, 5 stars it is. The minimum delivery of $20 is only a bummer if you are ordering for only one person.  When ordering for two it usually is pretty easy to hit the mark.\n\nI've ordered a bit here and there from the menu until my boyfriend and I settled on \"the usual\" as we are prone to doing.  Everything we've ever tried from here has always been well prepared and had quality ingredients, some of it just doesn't fit our tastes.  \n\nThe best thing about the food, in my opinion, is that it is consistent.  I hate when the food from any restaurant is really good one day, and then is terrible the next.  Having ordered from Chabaa at least 20 times now, I can say that isn't the case, the food is always just as good as it was the last time I ordered.  \n\nSince it has been awhile since I have ordered anything other than 'the usual', it is the only thing I feel comfortable talking about.\n\nI normally get the yellow curry and my boyfriend, the pad thai, both with chicken.  The yellow curry is really good,not too sweet or spicy.   It has just enough of a kick to make my nose water a bit, which for me is perfect.  The potatoes in the curry are usually undercooked though, I think they've only come fully cooked once, but there is always a good amount of chicken, which is properly cooked.  The pad thai is seasoned perfectly, always has plenty of chicken and fried tofu, though sometimes I do wish it has a little more peanut flavor, but my boyfriend is always happy with it.  \n\nWe also typically get a fried rice, which is the same rice base topped with whatever 'other' you order.  We've tried all the options that don't have pork or beef in them.  By far our favorite is either the duck or the fried chicken, typically there is only one breast/cutlet.  My last personal favorite are the egg rolls, I love the noodles that are inside of them.  My boyfriend really likes the fish cakes.  \n\nThe chicken for everything seems to be the same thinly sliced chicken that looks like it was steamed, maybe poached, I'm not sure.  It isn't tough or anything like that, but it hasn't had time to pick up the flavor of whatever you order it in either, which can make it out of place in some of the soups.  It is always white meat though, which I think tastes better in the food we normally get than dark meat would.\n\nFrom time to time I get the mango with sweet sticky rice as dessert.  The amount of mango it comes with seems to be determined by the season.  When they are in season it comes with a whole, pretty good sized mango.  When off season, usually a half of a large mango or a whole small one arrives.   The sticky rice is flavored very well, not too sweet, and it is wrapped separately.  This is really nice if you are like me and can never eat dessert with your meal because you are always stuffed, but you like your sweet sticky rice warm and your mango cold.  It also comes with a little sweetened coconut milk to pour over everything.\n\nAgain, definitely, by far, the best delivery I've managed to get in my neck of the woods, oh, which is Parkside btw.  Good, consistent food, and the people that run the place are really nice.   One of these days I may even make the trip to eat at the restaurant too.", "author": "Loni B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-06", "description": "Chabaa, an unassuming little shoebox of a place with earth tone walls and a surprising lack of crowds for a saturday night, is not a place that gets your expectations particularly high, so it was a welcome surprise when they brought me the best-tasting thai curry in San Francisco (though, admittedly, I haven't sampled much competition yet).  Some thai curry sauces have a tendency to cop out by over-relying on either spiciness or creaminess, but Chabaa's nails both aspects (I had the red curry, but also got to try a bit of panang and tom ka soup--amazingly consistent).  Throw in the crisp veggies and chewy rice, and you've got everything you need.  It'll be very interesting to see how it compares to Marnee's.

We loved it, it was cheap, and they delivered so there really wasn't a reason not to.  BUT, the last time I ordered from there it took an hour and a half for my order to come!  (It's only supposed to take 45 min)  I called and asked them where my food was and they weren't particularly friendly or apologetic.  When the food finally came it was cold and flavorless and extremely sludgy and oily..  Like so gross that I didn't even eat it.  I haven't been back since and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed.  One of these days I'll write them a letter of complaint.  \n\nI still gave three starts because every other time I ate there it was great.  I recommend getting the pad ma keur a la carte with a side of sticky rice.  Also, the bbq pork soup with vermicelli noodles is soooo good.  They're also happy to accommodate you when it comes to spiciness (my boyfriend can't handle the thai chilis).  I would recommend eating at the restaurant instead of ordering delivery (ever since my bad experience).  Overall Chabaa is a great little restaurant when you want some of your favorite thai staples.", "author": "Mira D."}

We went in and asked if it was OK to order just dessert and initially they were fine with it, but soon after they came for us to take the order the attitude kicked in.\nAlthough the attitude was not the worst part of all it was their dessert, we order the mango sticky rice which was decent but I definitely had much better somewhere else. I usually like it when the rice is warm and sticky while the mango is cold and fresh, but we got a room temp rice and room temp mango.\nWe also order the fried banana with Thai ice tea ice cream, which was incredibly disgusting. The banana was clearly fried a while ago and they just poped in the microwave to warm it up because the batter was mushy and the banana was almost liquidfy.  The Thai ice tea ice cream was clearly water down cause it was full of ice crystal and crunchy ice cream is just not  \"good eats\"\nObviously my review does not reflect their food but as for their dessert please just walk across the street for some frozen yogurt at Tutti Melon.", "author": "Andres K."}

There were 6 of us so we had a bunch of dishes.  Corn fritters, curry dish, vegi dishes- they were all good.  Then we went to order the mango with sticky rice for dinner and the waitress told us the mangos suck so don't order.  I was blown away!  The restaurant turned down a sale to preserve their quality.  \n\nLater on I convinced myself the place wasn't that good and I just had low expectations going in.  This past weekend me and the lovely lady made another trip and once again it was damn good.  Larb = boomin', red curry = kickin', tofu dish I can't pronounce = righteous.  Its clear this place is a cut above the rest. \n\nBottom line is the Thai food is better than anyplace even close to their price range.

The Chabaa staff knew nothing of her condition. Back then, the staff remembered us as customers and even remembered what my mother liked. The food was fresh and yummy,  reasonably priced, and the service was great. I seem to recall wanting to eat every morsel, leaving nothing behind. My mom really enjoyed their calamari salad that was always delicious. We had the eggplant, which was another one of my mom's favorite dishes. It's good to see that Chabaa has done well enough to expand to a second restaurant. Thanks Chabaa for contributing to nice memories of lunching with my mom and for treating us so well.", "author": "Akiki A."}

Not good, but not bad either. My roast duck noodle soup was too salty. The same noodle soup from King of Thai was a little too salty to me, too. But that was only a little, this was overly salty. But none of my friends said anything about their food so it could be just me and not the food.\n\nThe worst part of that meal was the service. We were served by a heavily powdered lady who was nice enough to warn us that all the flat rice noodle was out before we placed any ordered. And then it came the wrong bowl of noodle soup. But it's okay, as long as the powder on her face didn't fall into the soup. Then it came the bug in my soup. That little creature had been sitting at the bottom of the bowl until I was more than half way through with the noodle. Then it came right in the spoon floating on the soup when I was trying to scoop some roast duck out. Of course it wasn't the heavily powdered lady's fault that the bug was there. But then when my friend showed the bug, which was already on a piece of tissue paper by then, to the heavily powdered lady, instead of apologizing to us, she began to lecture us on how common it was to find bugs in vegetables! \"It's from the vegetable...blah blah blah......\" To prevent her lecture from damaging my meal further, I told her that I already know that the bug was from the vegetables (we could see the green inside the creature). Smashing the already dead bug like it's alive, the heavily powdered lady raised her voice. In a defense she said that she could \"void\" my item in a tone I was really afraid the powder on her face would fall off like old paint from a wall.\n\nI left the restaurant very scared that other customers will get the same service from the same waitress. If it's not the lady, it will get three stars, for the fact that it opens late and my friends didn't complain about their food.
