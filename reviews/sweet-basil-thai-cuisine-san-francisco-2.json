I had two things for dinner: fried crab cakes, and chicken pad thai.  The crab cakes were decent; nothing great; crab with some filler that was deep fried.  2 or 2.5 stars.  The pad thai, on the other hand, was probably the WORST pad thai I've had in my life.  And I've eaten A LOT of pad thai (I'm a native of SF and have been eating Thai food since I was a kid).  I think they re-heated the pad thai that they cooked a day before.  The noodles were hard and chewy.  The fried tofu was super duper hard and gummy.  The chicken was stringy (in long pieces, which I've never seen before in Thai).  And where was the bean sprouts?  The ground peanuts?  The green scallions?  The freshly cooked eggs?  There were a few measly green onions, and I think some sprinkles of ground peanuts.  It looked like a giant plate of ORANGE: orange noodles, fried tofu, and strips of chicken.  There was no color, no freshness, no vibrancy.  It was all so bland and gummy.  It was actually hard to eat.  I've had such experiences before, where you want to eat fast, and just get it over with.  This was like that!  UUUGGHHHHH!    \n\nBecause I had an appetizer, I didn't eat the whole pad thai.  Typically I'll save my leftovers and eat it the next day.  NOT THIS!  I threw that stuff in the compost bin!  NO WAY I'm going to eat such terrible food again!\n\nThe sad thing is that the other Thai restaurant in the neighborhood (Pad Thai Restaurant), is closed.  And I think permanently.  What a shame.  They made very good Thai food.  I won't bother coming back to this place.  How can you make bad pad thai?  I mean it's one of their signature dishes!  But I guess you can.  I'll just have to jump in my car and go to a Thai restaurant in another neighborhood when I feel like eating Thai.  \n\nHASTA LA VISTA SWEET BASIL!", "author": "Ramon C."}

Then they asked if they should deliver my order which to me was an unnecessary question since I am now physically at the location. \n\nTo top of it off, they quoted me an additional 30-45 minutes without regard to the time when the order was placed. From observation, I can see they ignore all their phone calls. I can clearly see that they have no regard to answer not a single one. I had hoped the reviews weren't correct about the quality of the food since my friend gave me personal testimony about a previous experience but this was already proving to be questionable. \n\nI support small business but experiences like these are so discouraging.

(Hi Dad, if you happen to be reading...don't worry, I mean Vienna sausages.)\n\nFormerly Thai Idea (second location), a vegan and vegetarian restaurant, Sweet Basil Thai is their carniwhorous sister restaurant by the same owners according to the staff. They still have faux meat available for all their dishes but decided to change their name since they offered meat dishes. Sweet Basil also has a location on Haight street and in Foster City. \n\nSweet Basil is definitely a neighborhood restaurant in Bernal Heights as it's not a destination restaurant. Finding street parking is awfully frustrating if you come after 6 pm on the weekdays or anytime on the weekends. Since Safeway is across the street, you can always buy a pack of gum which then technically makes you a \"customer\" so you can park in the lot for 90 minutes. Just a thought but park there at your own risk. \n\nJust like Thai Idea in TL, you can count on the wonderfully friendly service, trendy and sleek atmosphere, and beautiful presented dishes at reasonable prices. The menu ($6.95-$16.95) has a good selection of soups, salads, appetizers, curries, entrees, seafood, noodles, and chef specialties but they seem to be more of Americanized dishes which is not surprising given the area. \n\nI love Thai Idea in TL so I thought I would love their carniwhorous sister even more especially since they also don't use MSG and have brown rice available (my review: http://bit.ly/1aWSTNo). Disappointingly, I wasn't a fan of Sweet Basil's meat and fish dishes because they weren't well executed. I probably would have liked their faux meat more assuming it's prepared like their sister restaurant in TL. \n\nAs suggested by other Yelpers, we ordered the Massaman Curry ($8.95): http://bit.ly/1aWQYIH. We ordered it with duck for an extra $2. Deliciously rich, coconutty, and peanutty, the robust Massaman Curry was our favorite of the night. The duck could have been cut more thoroughly (pieces were stuck together) but it was very tender. This went very well with brown rice which soaked up all the yummy curry sauce. \n\nUnfortunately, things went downhill after this. The Volcanic Beef ($12.95) was pleasing to the eye but not the palate: http://bit.ly/1ce9q2A. There was no sear on the beef cubes making them incredibly chewy. I'm not a fan of OSHA Thai but I prefer their rendition over Sweet Basil's.\n\nThe Ginger Fish ($13.50) arrived on a bed of veggies with cornstarchy gravy: http://bit.ly/15bAe0w. There wasn't much ginger flavor but there were tons of button mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. Just odd and not how I envisioned it based on the menu description. My biggest gripe was the batter they used; it was heavy and cakey which really compromised the delicateness of the fish fillets.\n\nThe wine started talking to me so the Fried Bananas w/ Ice Cream ($5.95) was ordered for dessert: http://bit.ly/18MWaOm. To be frank, it was just awful. The same heavy and cakey batter was used for coating the bananas and the accompanying ice cream was ultra icy and ironically wasn't creamy.\n\nI hope they work out the kinks with their frying batter and meat preparation because they DO have an edge over their next door competitor (Pad Thai Restaurant) when it comes to faux meat options and using no MSG. IMO, it would be nice to see a couple of more popular and authentic Thai dishes like Ko Mu Yang: Grilled Pork Shoulder on the menu. Or even Sai Oua: Thai Sausage. I mean, who doesn't love a good piece of sausage?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Not as good as Pad Thai up the street (or as good as Dusit which it replaced).  Tom yum was small, lame, no complexity, not sure what was wrong but it definitely wasn't happening.  Green curry was uninteresting.  Maybe they were having an off night, but probably won't be back.", "author": "Sammy B."}

I'd been craving Thai food all day, but couldn't decide if I should give in or make something @ home instead.  I finally decided to just go for it.  But now it was almost 9:30...\nI call in to see if it's too late to place an order for pick up, since they close at 10:00.  The gentleman that took this call suggested delivery.  Problem was we are out of their delivery range.  He then says they'll deliver it anyway, if I don't mind a small delivery fee.\n\nOf course I don't mind.  I don't mind at all.\n\nHe says...\nWhy not stay nice & warm at home?\nNo rushing.  No driving.  No parking (on mission?  That's a laugh)...just relax & let them take care of it?  Uh...is this a trick question?  You don't have to ask me twice!\n\nHe then tells me he'll put my order in pronto, & that we'll be the last delivery of the night...no biggie.\n\nWhy can't everyone be this accommodating & everything be this easy?\n\nThe food arrived @ 10:00!  What?!  And everything was correct...\nDuck egg rolls.\nThai samosas.\nSpicy basil pork.\nSpicy fried rice w pork.\nJasmine rice.\n\nIf you like duck, you'll love the duck egg rolls.  If you love Indian samosas, you'll like these.  The Thai version are just smaller, without the peas in the filling, & a tad less spicy.  Delicious!  I wolfed down 2 of them before I even brought out the plates & silverware for crisake!  The basil pork was the only dish that I didn't find exceptional; the flavor was on point enough but it was way overcooked.  The spicy fried rice w pork was perfect.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly spicy, perfectly moist.  It was so good I'm salivating just thinking about it.  We loved it.\n\nThis was the most personable phone order I have ever experienced.  This guy was downright charming.  Absolutely gracious.  He was funny.  He was sweet.  He didn't rush me.  Considering the fact that I called just a half hour before closing time on a sleepy weeknight, that is beyond impressive.  \n\nSo...\nextraordinary phone side manner, lightening speed order to delivery time, & the food being above par, well...\n\nThat's why I have to give them 5 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

I've eaten here almost a dozen times now, and I have to put this review down to combat the absolutely disgusting Thai place that is a couple doors down \"Pad Thai.\" DO NOT go there. If you're considering the two Thai places, go to Sweet Basil Thai. \n\nThis is a very decent neighborhood Thai place. I wouldn't say it's the best Thai place in the world, but it's a great place to get take-out or stop by for a quick bite in the hood. \n\nFirst of all, they definitely know how to pack food. I've ordered noodles several times from here and they separate everything perfectly so that the noodles don't get too soggy. I mean, that is some ingenuity and thoughtfulness put into their take-out protocol. \n\nPlus they give you pretty big portions. We got green curry from this place and it came in a big soup container which ended up being two meals worth! It was loaded with pork and veggies too - not all sauce.\n\nThe tom yum noodle soup here is also quite good. This is my favorite thai dish, and although I wouldn't say it's the best I've had, it's a fine substitute for my tom yum craving. \n\nSo yeah, I don't know why \"Pad Thai\" a couple doors down has 4 stars and this is only getting 3.5 right now, that's kind of sketchy. We went to \"Pad Thai\" once and since they are called \"Pad Thai\" I thought I\"d try the pad thai. It was so sticky sweet - it was like candy noodles. Clearly, it was made for a less asian clientele. Had also gotten green curry with pork and the pork was like mystery meat... and not very much of it either - just a few pieces. Most of it was this neon green curry sauce... I'm not thai, but I don't think it's suppose to be that color.\n\nAnyways, this review should be about THIS restaurant... and everything I've had here has been decent to good. I'm glad to have this as a neighborhood go-to restaurant, especially for take-out, though the service has been good when I've eaten here. \n\nAs for people complaining about delivery - you have to wonder if it's really Sweet Basil's fault. I would go pick up my food 10 mins after placing my order and it's almost always ready or if not then waiting just a few minutes. I mean whenever I've used Eat24 or any delivery service, it always takes forever. It's just dumb to complain about this. Basically in this city if you want delivery, you should expect it taking an hour and half, that's always been my experience. Do they even have their own delivery person, or does Eat24 provide the delivery person? \n\nAnyhow, I think some people are entitled, especially in this city, and don't think about things, so just wanted to put that out there. Sorry, I'm a libra so I like to fight for justice. Just not for the justice of that \"Pad Thai\" restaurant down the street. :P Sorry dudes.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

The soup was thin, and tasteless.  \n\nSalad roles smelled as though the shrimp may be bad, but we were so hungry we ate them anyway.  Unfortunately, they fell apart as we picked them up so they were not freshly made ...it was as if they had sat in out all day. The peanut sauce that comes with the rolls was oily at top and thick sauce...again as if it had sat out all day.\n\nIn addition it took 1.5 to get delivery - in driver's defense, it was raining and I felt bad for her as she said she was the only delivery person.  \n\nThe rolls and and soup went down the drain after spending $43 for food+delivery+ tip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "description": "That was the least satisfactory Thai (or any) meal I've ordered for delivery in a very long time.  Bad enough to write a review for the first time in a long time as well.\n\nFirst time customer, found and ordered via Caviar.\n\nI kept it simple.  Three standards I generally try at a new to me Thai choice.  The larb gai, the dish I was craving most, was inedibly spicy and I'm no novice nor averse to heat. So disappointing since if it'd even been simply good, I'd not be writing such a review.  Hard to know for sure since I didn't get past first bite and it's more of a subtle issue, but the chicken seemed undercooked as well.  And again, not a novice.  I cook a lot of chicken in a lot of ways and know the line between perfectly juicy but done and undercooked.\n\nOK, on to a usually comforting dish to me, yellow curry with chicken and onions. Boring and sad.  This was slapped together and lacked any depth of expected flavors in the coconut based yellow curry.  The onions were nicely tender and not mushy but the potatoes were grainy.  Probably russets and maybe should be something like a Yukon gold?\n\nI should note here that I had this over rice.  But there was no option to order rice. I added it as a note to the order but I fault the restaurant for not adding side rice choices to their Caviar setup. But I give them credit for noticing the note I added.\n\nLast, I often add tom yum soup to any Friday night Thai order to have it in fridge for lunch or a dinner starter Saturday.  I'm not eager to find out what it's like but it can't possibly make this review better.\n\nSadly submitted.", "author": "Jon R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-11-19", "description": "Some customer service tips to the non-accented English speaker who took my call on Monday night (11/18). (Reading through the other negative customer service reviews, it is likely that this person is Allen, the manager, though I have no idea):\n\n-If a customer has been waiting over an hour and a half for an order placed at the very reasonable time of 6:44 pm, and now it's 8:23 pm, and he's already called the online ordering service once to check to see why his order is so late, and they said it would be 5-10 minutes more, and then 15 minutes pass and still no food, that customer has a perfect right to be kind of annoyed. \n\n-Putting on super-fake bright affect, like saying \"awesome!\" when the customer reluctantly agrees to be put on hold, does not help at all. Tanking blood sugar levels mean that the customer is not having an \"awesome\" experience and just pretending like everything's totally \"cool!\" is likely to make the customer even angrier. \n\n-Invest in a proper hold button, or at least a mute button. When the customer can hear you trying to do damage control with the driver, it makes it that much harder to get that customer to believe you when you tell him that you're just \"really busy.\"\n\n-When the customer calmly asks you what went wrong, better to tell him the truth and then try to make it right instead of getting defensive and belligerent. Remember, he heard you talking to the driver. \n\n-When the customer starts to get angry at your ongoing deception and your refusal to make any effort at all to even apologize, and he suggests that you may want to just explain what really happened if you don't want to get some one-star reviews, you should probably go ahead and come clean instead of just repeating more loudly how much people \"like your food.\" This customer likes your food too, and he found out from your extremely apologetic and polite driver that you fell behind on the Eat24 orders. That's not such a big deal. If you had just owned it instead of covering it up and then getting defensive about it, you might have found that your customer is actually a pretty rational and forgiving person. \n\n-Yelling at the customer that he is threatening \"slander\" is also not a good move. Here is the definition of slander: \"the action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person's reputation.\" See that word \"false\"? \n\nHere are some facts: online ordering system reported that food would arrive in 45-60 minutes.  Food took 105 minutes to arrive. Customer received rude and incompetent service and repeated attempts to \"spin\" him instead of trying to resolve the situation. There was no apparent concern for acknowledging or rectifying mistakes.  \n\nHaving worked in the restaurant industry for some years myself, I can safely say that those facts are probably going to get you a bunch of one star reviews. \n\nI can only speculate, but your attitude and tone really indicated that you probably felt like you were \"too good\" to be taking customer complaints. Maybe that's not your strong suit; it's definitely a challenge, I know. I have no idea what your story is, but you certainly haven't taken your job seriously enough to figure out how to do it well. So, here's a free lesson, courtesy of the internet, on how to handle an irate customer:\n\n1. Remain calm; don't reflect and amplify your customer's anger.\n2. Empathize; if your customer has a valid reason to be angry, assure him that you understand his frustration.\n3. Apologize; a simple apology goes a long way towards defusing heated situations.\n4. Find a solution; a free appetizer or even a free meal will cost your business much less than a lost customer, and much, much less than a bad online review; you might even find that the proper response to a negative situation will not only result in a happy, paying, loyal customer, but glowing online reviews commending you for thinking fast and putting the customer first. \n\nDude, you completely blew it on every single point. Maybe you've got plenty of customers already and can afford to p*ss a few of them off. Maybe only having four stars on Yelp instead of five is worth not learning how to do customer service properly. I don't know. Seems like you're doing a lot of things right already; why not all of them?", "author": "j. d. c."}

It is lovely inside, the servers are positively charming and very accommodating, and the food is simply beautiful and tastes superb. As I noted in the \"Yelp Tips\" section, they have a vegetarian menu that's as equally huge as the meaty one.\n\nTheir Volcanic Veggie-Beef is really outstanding, as is their Panang Curry with Veggie-Chicken. I have yet to try a single bad dish here, and I come here fairly often.\n\nIf I had to make a criticism, I'd say that they should hand out the fabulous vegetarian menu along with the meaty one--currently, you have to know to ask for it. Also, if you want a spicy dish, even when a dish is marked as spicy, you really need to request for it to be \"very spicy\" in order for it to give you a nice kick to the mouth. Regardless, I really adore this place, and am, admittedly, a bit of a Thai snob.\n\nLove! Thanks for the great food, Sweet Basil Thai (formerly Thai Idea)!", "author": "Elle J."}

At first glance Sweet Basil is small, clean, and very good atmosphere (mind you that I was their first customer of the evening checking in at 5:05PM).  \n\nThe service was fast and cordial as stated by other Yelpers reviews. I waited for the food to be ready and chose to stand up while I waited ( I was offered a glass of water and to have a sit), I accepted the glass of water but decided to wait standing up. I got everything packed and I was on my way out the restaurant, I will say they do earn one and a half stars thus far for the cleanliness of the place and helpful service (so far, so good).\n\nNevertheless, we are here for the food review and it goes as follows:\n\nAppetizers - \n- The Chicken Satay was well seasoned and moist (not dried like other places).\n- The Crab Cakes were well seasoned and I was warned that condensation may make them soggy by the time I got home (Thus far, I have not experienced any other restaurant doing that).\n\nMain Dishes -\n- Chicken Pad Thai noodles, not outstanding or good, rather it was decent. Noodles cooked well, the chicken was moist and the dish had a nice balance of ingredients yet it lacked the bold flavor that Pad Thai is known for.\n- Chicken Pad See Ew, was a very nice dish. The noodles were cooked nice and had that smoky flavor without the sore eye of burned noodles. The chicken was moist, the veggies were not overcooked thou it could use a bit more broccoli.\nShrimp Yellow Curry, now that is what I call curry. Well seasoned, spice on point and it went very well with brown rice (the rice was nicely done). The potatoes in the curry were nice, not under or over cooked.\n\nThe overall experience was above average and earns them three stars. However, they get half a star taken off for not double checking that the complete order was in the bag (They missed the Thai Iced Tea and my wife was looking forward to it). The prices for the dishes seem to be on par with other Thai restaurants. In addition, while other restaurants seem to cut back on portions, this restaurant makes generous portions.

It was yummy, but didn't produce the mouth watering effect of the Massaman Curry.\n\nPaired these babies with a Riesling, which my friend (who worked at a wine start up for two years) informed me was great for pairing with Thai food due to its high acidity (which, evidently, also makes your mouth water). Whatever you say, Jon.\n\nAs for the restaurant itself, the decor was very nice: a waterfall curtain at the back of the restaurant, small tables lined up in two rows, but far enough apart that you don't pay much attention to your neighbor. Decorative cushions acted as back rests, and the whole place breathed trendiness.

We ordered delivery of Tom Kha veggie soup, specifying that we're vegan, Green Curry and Pad Thai, both spicy. Considering 'spicy' is the second hottest option, we knew it'd be hot. \nAfter taking well over an hour for everything to arrive which was understandable because it's Friday (I guess...we're on 22nd so not far), but when we plated everything, it looked awful. The Tom Kha had next to nothing in it, the green curry was brown and the same consistency as the soup and the pad Thai was a hunk of sticky mess. Whatever, we were starving. \nOur hunger was quickly replaced with sadness since everything tasted like the god damn sun it was so spicy. Ugh. Then, to top it off, there was CHICKEN in my vegan soup...\nObviously I called back and told Alan (the guy who answers the phone) what was up. He told me, \"oh yeah, I remember you. You specifically ordered spicy.\"  I agreed, then added that we didn't order nuclear and it was inedible. Side note: I looooove hot! This was just outrageous. He informed me that we could come in and pick up another order of soup (we're in pjs so no) or that he could refund me for it. I told him we payed cash and he said (verbatim) \"well, ma'am, we have cars nowadays, so I'll have the driver head back over.\" Real smartassy.

Alan got us started with thai iced tea, followed by thai samosas and crispy spring rolls, followed by pad thai, tofu yellow curry and chicken massaman curry. He personally made sure that food came out in good time, and that it was distributed such that everyone could easily access it. Even the rest of the staff was super friendly and helpful and catered to all our requests with a smile! :) They even let us get in a birthday cake, held it for us in the back and set out all the plates and spoons for us, all at no additional cost! :D\nThe presentation of the dishes was also pretty awesome, especially the spring rolls which came in a martini glass!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-01", "description": "I loved this place when it was Thai Idea and on a visit a couple days ago was pretty disappointed.\n\nMaybe my server just wasn't aware, but when I asked for the vegetarian menu (mentioned in other reviews, was expecting the full menu they used to have as Thai Idea) she said there was none, but that almost anything with meat on the menu could be made with fake meat. The vegetarian section on the new menu is actually pretty short and boring, but we stuck to it, since neither of us are huge fans of fake meat anyway.\n\nOn earlier visits to Thai Idea (both the one on Polk, and when Sweet Basil Thai was a Thai Idea) I honestly felt it was some of the best Thai food I'd ever had. It had complex flavors and legitimately spicy. I had even talked it up to my friend quite a bit. On this visit we asked for a vegetarian version of the green curry, vegetarian spring rolls, and chili green beans.\n\nWhile the presentation is still beautiful, the food was kind of boring. The green curry was not very flavorful and did not come with the vegetables advertised--lots of carrots and green beans, and some cabbage, but no eggplant, sadly. The chili green beans were okay but not very exciting, or Thai-tasting, either. \n\nIt's pretty close to my house but I'm sad to say I probably won't be back. Maybe when they decided to start serving meat they also decided to Americanize their food a bit---it just seems bland now. It sort of feels as if they sold out, and it's a loss, and not just because it used to be much more veg-friendly.", "author": "Tamara F."}

Luckily I love mock duck, but that could get horribly confusing for a meat eater. It sounds like from the other reviews that all the meat is mock?

Was greeted as soon as we walked in - wasn't too busy (early evening around 7pm) - had a good table by the window.  We were provided water & menus.  The waiter asked if we wanted to start off with anything to drink - he said that \"happy hour\" was still happening - so we were pleased with that.  He brought a menu for us - but wonder why it wasn't provided along with the dinner menus?  Had some beer & wine (which is their only choice - that's fine) - but I wonder if they really charge $10,00 for a glass of wine (which aren't large glasses) - if it's not \"happy hour\" - it was just chardonnay Clos Du Bois.  Probably should have gotten bottle, as had three glasse & does add up.\n\nThe owner/manager also spoke with us, very nice, asked if we'd eaten here before - no first time.  Then said he had made some mango stickey rice, which he'd serve us for dessert, as took 6 hrs to prepare.  Sounded great.  He said their portions were big.  We ordered some appetizers, but we were disappointed - the portions really weren't ample enough to share for three people (chicken satay & shrimp rolls).  Although the entrees were good portions.  \n\nIt started to get a bit busy - we finsihed, but never saw the owner/manager again - I wonder how the mango stickey rice was?  Oh well, I guess he forgot or got busy?\n\nWe'll probably go back - liked the happy hour & maybe next we'll try the mango sticky rice.", "author": "Suzi P."}

My carnivorous dinner companion and I only shared one dish, the green papaya salad, which was delicious -- shredded green papaya with green beans and other vegetables, all very fresh and crunchy, with a spicy sweet-sour chile-lime dressing.  I had the vegetarian coconut milk soup, which was a bit creamier and milder than others I've had, but still excellent.  I was full by that time (the soup is meant for more than 1 person), so I had to take home the tofu and vegetables in green curry & coconut milk sauce.  I just now finished the leftovers, and it's just how I like it -- lots of garlic.  The vegetables, by the way, were eggplant, broccoli, cabbage and carrots.  \n\nI'm afraid I didn't notice what my friend ordered, but he was happy with it.\n\nUnlike most Thai restaurants I've been to, the waiter didn't ask how spicy we wanted anything.  I'd say the green curry would probably be called \"medium\" in most restaurants.  The papaya salad was spicier, but not too hot.  They are so accommodating about everything else that I'm sure you can request the heat to your taste.\n\nThere are lots of vegan choices (and you can ask for a vegan version of any dish on the menu), but since I had a real yen for green curry that night, I didn't try any of the many dishes that were new to me.  But I'll definitely be back, so I'll have plenty of opportunities.", "author": "Deborah B."}

First they took ages to answer the phone,ok, fine, they're busy. But when they finally answered, the guy sounded put out that he had to take an order. After 45 minutes I just now got my food, without my credit card receipt. The driver said there was some mistake made by the restaurant and I should just sign the back of the food receipt, which I did. He said to call the restaurant if I want a copy of my credit card receipt. Which I did. The guy who answered was a total an arrogant a**hole. I told him I'd like a copy of my cc receipt , he asked if I had a fax number - which I don't.  I told him it was the restaurants responsibility to give me a copy.  To which he answered for me to calm down - I wasn't uptight until he told me to calm down - I told him not to speak to me that way, I just want my receipt. He told me to calm down again - wow. I said he was going to lose a customer if he kept telling me to calm down - His response was that he has hundreds of customers....unbelievable arrogant attitude - he takes my money and talks to me that way.  Their food isn't even that good, it's very so-so take out. Not a four star establishment is it? What a jerk. I live in the neighborhood and have lots of friends here who will know about his shitty attitude to his customers.", "author": "Wendy L."}

With less than a few hours notice before our reservation, the restaurant manager, Alan, was extremely helpful & accommodating, and made our dinner experience a most enjoyable and memorable one!  Ambiance: trendy, comfortable & clean. The menu had plenty of variety & great vegan options. Price inexpensive & good portion size. Food excellent flavor & presentation. The fresh salad roll & Thai Samosa were delicious. The Som Tum (payaya salad) was spicy hot, so ask for mild if you can't take the heat. Larb salad w/chicken was one of the best that I've tasted. We also had Massaman curry with chicken, string beans with beef, Pad Thai and basil chicken: plus all these in vegan option. Great flavor, but not too salty or oily.  The wait staff were friendly & provided very good service. Will definitely return to try other dishes on the menu!", "author": "Linda L."}

Since that time almost two years now*wipes tear*  they have been a godsend in the munchie department lol. Turns out im not even in their delivery range anymore but they have decided to continue to deliver to us regardless. The food is cooked exactly to specifications,  and if not they very swiftly ammend any mistakes.  Not to mention the food is awesome with a wide variety, veggie menu extra points!,  lots of spice(the delivery driver laughed after dropping off the last order) and fresh ingredients. Right on sweet basil", "author": "Glen Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-14", "description": "This place is great. Yummy with fresh flavors and great presentation. My only complaint is that their online ordering system does not work which makes it difficult to call in orders because the restaurant is so loud that talking over the phone makes it difficult to communicate. And the other thing is that there is a lack of vegetables. For example, if you order the vegetarian curry it doesn't really come with much more than the sauce with a few bits of veggies.. As a person who really loves a lot of veggies in Asian food that is the only real lack. But they are the best Thai place in the neighborhood so I'm a fan.", "author": "s k."}

I don't recommend the tea, though. I think they make it with minerally tap-water and it tasted kinda gross... and minerally. The server was great, though, and really nice, and it's the most savory and flavorful thai food I could have hoped for.", "author": "Mia M."}

It's that good. The decor and the atmosphere is classy and comfortable, the food is good, and I am utterly impressed by the presentation of the food they serve. For the price of a sandwich downtown they give you such good food AND such elaborate plating. I feel very pampered by such attention they pay to their dishes. I also like it that they have such an extensive menu - meat, vegetarian, vegan... and they are cool with substitution however you want. The staff is very friendly without being annoying, and you can really tell that they care about what they do from the way they interact with you. My favorite dish (so far) is the Pumpkin Curry with Veggie Beef. I don't usually like fake meat but the veggie beef is good. I go there whenever I don't feel like cooking... the staff recognize me now.", "author": "Mei L."}

My friend and I heard a new veggie friendly Thai place had opened and didn't know what to expect. First the ambiance was great, good music and comfy tables. Second, the service was excellent. Allen was an awesome server and friend. He made recommendations, checked on us frequently, and guaranteed good food. Third the good stuff: the food was great! We did veggie options but there were plenty of meat lover choices available that I plan to come back and try. Its nice to find a neighborhood restaurant that cares about the neighborhood!", "author": "Tracey K."}

I try a new dish every time and hubby has pad thai every time :) He samples pad thai all over the city and he thinks the pad thai here is tied with Thai House Express as the best.  I love pretty much every dish I've tried, except for maybe crab fried rice...but then again, crab isn't in season.  The staff is always super friendly and accommodating since we have a 8 month old whom we always take with us.  They don't ask for \"spicy\" level when ordering though, so you have to remember to tell them \"mild\" if you don't like spicy food.", "author": "Jane M."}

For the appetizers MAKE SURE to have the Thai Samosa, it's very good. Their crab cakes are not bad as well, they totally put a different twist (in a good way) to it. For dinner my girlfriend and I had the Panang Curry and Pineapple Friend Rice; both were good selections. For dessert, I ordered the Mango Sticky Rice! This dessert is good as well. What got me to rate this establishment with 5 stars is Allen, the very attentive and charismatic restaurant manager and his excellent staff. I didn't have a cake for my girlfriend so I asked Allen if it were possible to put a candle on one of the desserts. Allen was very accommodating and he even gave me a tap on the shoulder as a signal that the dessert was coming soon. My girlfriend and I definitely will be back to this establishment. Very amazing experience!", "author": "Jimmy D."}
