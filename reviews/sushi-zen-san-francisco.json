I yelped this place and I had to try this considering it has a solid 4 stars and over 500 reviews. Got seated after 10 min which wasn't bad at all. Place closes at 10pm on a Friday, we arrived around 9:15pm. It's very kid-friendly, with nice tables and pictures against the wall. Anyways about the food, the wait time was sort of long to me. That's my *only* complaint about this place but it's well-worth it once u dive into your sushi. \n\nI ordered a winter wonderland, and a caterpillar roll. Both were reasonable portion sizes-not teeny tiny sushi rolls. It was reaaaaaaaaally good! Flavorful, and filling! I wanted to order more but after ordering those, I was already stuffed. It wasn't bad at all paying only $27 with seaweed salad on the side which is what I always have to have when I eat sushi.

Sushi Zen is good, cheap, and somewhat quick. Put on some glasses though cause you will probably walk past this place. The entrance is literally one door and squeezed between two larger restaurants. The interior is more old-fashioned which is quite cute and there's hardly a line.\n\nIn terms of authenticity, it's probably not going to be the most authentic sushi but the fish is fresh and the rolls are quite good. Tsunami and sunset rolls were quite good and their bento boxes aren't too bad. For what you pay, you can get a pretty substantial meal. So all in all, Sushi Zen is actually a pretty underrated restaurant but that may also be cause it's so low key.", "author": "Derek T."}

So we ended up stopping by at this place here in the city! \n\nENVIRONMENT - 3/5 Rate\nYes, you are here in San Francisco. Although this part of the area, parking was not as excruciating. Just give a little patience and you will find a metered parking on the streets. Judging on the outside of this restaurant, you could tell that this place is a typical hole in the wall. The inside was very casual. Nothing that sparked my eye. I love how they put pictures of customers eating their food on the wall. Shows the community spirits! Staffs were really friendly and welcoming as soon as we walk in. I love the traditional way where whenever customers walk, they would aggressively greet you in Japanese!\n\nBENTO BOX - 7.5/10 Rate\nAt any sushi restaurant, it is mandatory for me to order the bento boxes. I am a big eater and could easily demolish the entire box. This particular bento I've ordered came with Sashimi, Chicken Katsu, California Rolls, salad, and rice. The Sashimis were fresh. Definitely love the raw fish with wasabi. The Chicken Katsu was slightly soggy but didn't bother me to an extent. Everything was very nicely presented in this bento. The bento box was a good size portion, although could be bigger.\n\nCONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, you got yourself a decent Japanese restaurant in town. I would adequalely say that this is an average sushi restuarant, there wasn't anything that stood out. Nothing exotic or impressive. The staffs were friendly and provided great services.  I would recommend this restaurant to Yelpers. I would come back here and eat again!", "author": "Alan L."}

The rolls came out in the order they were made, rather than all together, which was fine with me. They were average in size and had a good amount of fish. There wasn't really anything wrong with them, but they lacked a \"wow\" factor and didn't include what they said was included on the menu (one of our rolls was supposed to come with spicy tuna on the inside, but instead, there was shrimp tempura....). I thought each roll was either too salty or too sweet.

Not a simple hello or anything when we sat down at our table. Our server didn't ask us what we would like to drink, but came to place waters on our table, made no eye contact, and then left. We weren't able to place our order until we had to flag her down again to talk to her. The wait for our food wasn't long, unfortunately, our sushi was slightly warm when it came to our table which gave me an unsettling feeling. Our portions were somewhat small as well. As we ate our food, our server didn't come once to the table to ask if we needed anything. Pretty much providing no service. \n\nTo top it all off, after paying for the bill, we left our tip on the table. As we were putting on our coats to leave, our server shoves me aside to get to our table, swipes the tip and hurries to clean up. I made the effort to look around to see if we needed to rush, however, there was no line and plenty of seats open. No thank you was said or please come again, instead I said sorry for being in her way and also said thank you to her for her service.

The first time was roughly a year ago, I came with a friend for my sushi cravings. If I remember correctly, it was during lunch time. There wasn't a long wait and the service was pretty good. I'm not a roll person,  if you want a review on rolls please check out fellow yelpers that have reviewed this place. I'm focused on nigiri and hand rolls. First off, I can't get sushi just anywhere. I came here the first time to just satisfy my tummy. It was pretty average. But what got me was the sashimi, it wasn't fishy or slimy. The only con is I wish the rice and fish were more room temperature and if they put wasabi between their fish and rice.\n\nFast forward a year. I am celebrating a special occasion with my boyfriend. It was a Sunday night and literally was the most reasonable sushi place near SFSU. Nigiri at this place goes from 3 to 9 depending on what you get. I ordered everything I personally get at my sushi restaurant back home. My boyfriend doesn't really ever order nigiri so it was his first experience and he loved it, especially the uni! The fish didn't taste frozen. There was no pink or redish color on my rice, usually that's because the fish slice was frozen. It basically melted in your mouth. \n\nIf you want to go to get decent nigiri for a reasonable price go here. The only con was that the second time the food took an extremely long time, people even left.

Service was bustling and very motherly (my guess is due to the area), but tea refills came quite frequently and recommendations were enthusiastic. We wouldn't have ordered the saba shioyaki if not for the recommendation of the waitress that it was her frequent dinner on the menu, and it turned out to be a favorite.\n\nMiso soup:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SreqPSrNxaO7KVRUuPzYKg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nMediocre at best, the miso soup here had a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's a personal preference, as I know some friends who actually prefer that aftertaste, but I like my miso soup a tad lighter. \n\nSashimi side order:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BxLkVI2sx1s3LowYp1E0qw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe caliber of sashimi here is very mediocre. I understand that it was a side order, but the pieces were rather thin with little texture. The salmon was slightly dry and the tuna a bit mealy, but the super white tuna was decent. Wasabi obviously came from a tube, and the ginger veered on the sweet side. \n\nAmaebi:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H22z8Z07Koov5vSDn71BIw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nFried amaebi heads:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aSXvGju4jmCOGAP0EE4fZg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe amaebi nigiri here was some ridiculous price (I think maybe $3.99?), which was the least expensive I've ever seen it being offered. I was a little skeptical to order it at first, as you usually get what you pay for, but the nigiri was surprisingly good. It was fresh and had really nice texture, down to the tobiko on top. The fried heads were a bit overbreaded, but came out piping hot and were obviously freshly fried. For that price and surprising caliber, I had to order a second round.\n\nSaba shioyaki:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=A4n4uuiQhVQJNKRipv_hUw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe unexpected star of the night, this saba shioyaki was probably one of the best grilled pieces of fish I'd ever had. It was so incredibly succulent and moist and well-marinated that I almost - almost! - ordered a second, but I was pretty full after our roll came that I didn't. It was the perfect balance of salty and smoky, and I was definitely impressed with the waitress's recommendation. The salad was unmemorable, and I didn't use the sauce because the fish really didn't need it so can't comment on it. \n\nSuper white tuna roll:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DE2eBlr7u8jFXtZTOk1-dg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI probably wouldn't order rolls here again, but I thought I'd give this one a try. The super white tuna was interestingly pink, but it didn't have bad texture. The sushi rice was subpar though, and the roll pretty much fell apart at the touch of a chopstick. I did appreciate that the roll itself wasn't drenched in sauce, but it left much to be desired and wasn't worth the asking price.\n\nI may not return to Sushi Zen unless I were in the area and didn't want to venture farther, but it yielded a decent dinner during my visit.", "author": "Maggie X."}

Being a Friday night, the high rated places off Irving/Mission neighborhoods weren't in the plan. We settled for Sushi Zen.\nThe photos on the Yelp page looked promising, but looks can be deceiving as we soon found out. I don't want to come off as a sushi snob, but well, maybe I do. We ordered our usual basics (well, tried to) hamachi, tuna..(nope, looked frozen), salmon..(nope not having farmed), uh had to fill in with whatever else possibly would suffice. Rounded up with escolar (partially frozen), tai (bad cut, super chewy that they had to cut slits in the fish so you can eat it), and scallop (best of all tonight). Time to fill in a roll as well so we won't leave hungry - Sunset Strip roll (pretty good roll with hamachi, mango and unagi inside with tuna and salmon with house sauce outside).\nI saw another couple eating Japanese dinner entrees at the sushi bar, which isn't a good sign as normally the sushi bar is more for patrons wanting sushi. The tempura dinner looked good, so what the heck, I'll have one too. I must say, this was the highlight of dinner. 3 pieces of shrimp with a variety of vegetables, a bowl of rice and miso soup for $10.99. What a deal!\nSo on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate the sushi quality as a 4. There were irregular shaped cuts, partially frozen cuts and well, cuts that shouldn't even be served on sushi. However, the prices here at Sushi Zen won't break the bank. You get what you pay for.\nBefore I forget, the service is to be desired. How would you like the waitress squeezing herself against you to put in the order and pick up at least 10 times during your meal, waiting 10 minutes to get more tea or best of all (drum roll please...), the sushi chef asking you if everything IS ok when you are about to leave.

I opted for this place after checking Yelp for the nearest sushi restaurant and of decent quality. I called for to-go and it was a bit difficult to communicate with the employees. However, after 4 attempts, they finally understood my order. Not that it was complicated, but maybe because they couldn't understand me correctly through the phone. After ordering, the male employee told me that it'll be ready in 5-10 minutes. I was surprised at how fast it was claimed to be finished by and I arrived within 5-10 minutes. \n\nMy order consisted of sushi lunch combo C and 2 pcs of uni nigiri. My order was surprisingly ready when I arrived. For both items, it came out around $21 and I was surprised by the cost for the quantity. $21 for 8 pcs of California roll, 5 pcs assorted nigiri, and 2 pcs of uni nigiri. The quality was okay, you definitely get what you paid for. I enjoyed the California roll and the uni nigiri. The uni had that gamey-mess I really liked and it did not taste bad. The ratio of crab meat to avocado in the California roll was like 3:1, but nonetheless, it was passable. The quality of the fishes for the assorted nigiri could be better, but like I have mentioned, you get what you pay for. \n\nThe service was friendly and fast. If Amami is closed and I'm craving for sushi, I would definitely come back.", "author": "Brenda K."}

The restaurant is pretty tiny -a hole in the wall type of spot. Upon entering, I hear the waiters speaking in Chinese, which was my first question of authenticity for a Japanese restaurant. Either way, we were seated and served water right away although there was a lack of refill for the water later into the meal. We decided to share the Taraval Roll ($9.95), Sunset Strip Roll ($11.95), and King Kong Roll ($11.95). First of all, I didn't like how there was a good five minute gap between each roll that came out. Next, they drizzled a house special sauce over every single roll, which I was not too fond of either. Lastly, the rolls were not assembled tightly as the rice was falling apart and tasted mushy. The sushi rolls would've been worth the value otherwise, but not the best sushi I have had. Overall, okay spot as I'm hoping it was just an off day for the sushi chefs. Will I be back though? Only if I'm craving sushi that badly.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

Although I'm normally inclined to buy a lot of sushi, i couldn't pull myself to buying sushi knowing there's another sushi restaurant that has half off Wednesdays, so we opted for the sashimi, chicken teriyaki / tempura bento plate, and the grilled squid.\n\nThe best grilled squid i've had in quite a while and would definitely come back just for that. The texture was soft and chewy, but not rubbery. The mayonnaise sauce was a great compliment, but the standard sauce they have it in was more than enough flavor. The portion size for this was quite generous as well.\n\nThe sashimi was still frozen, so although this is a sushi place, i don't think i'll have sushi next time either.\n\nChicken teriyaki was average taste, but was filling. The tempura was nice and hot and had a good consistency. There were two shrimps, a couple of yams, green beans, egg plant, and maybe another item or two that weren't as memorable.\n\nBetween a 4 and 5 star is what i would give this, but with the frozen sashimi, it's closer to a 4 star.", "author": "Ricky J."}

My bf and I ordered a couple of their special rolls and the uni sashimi. Rolls were okay, but the quality and color of the fishes seemed off and didn't taste fresh. There was a piece of fish bone in one of the pieces that I ate which took me by surprise. The uni was light in color and looked bad. I took a small bite and it was foul and gritty, the most disgusting uni I ever tasted. We immediately told our server and with the chef's permission, they took it away and didn't charge us. \n\nI'm honestly surprised I didn't get food poisoning from here, but I rather not risk it and will avoid this place. Let's just hope I'll remember next time.", "author": "Renee Y."}

We were served hot tea promptly, which is always nice on a gloomy day. We ordered the half shell oyster appetizer, 4 nigiri orders (2 albacore, maguro, and ika) and 2 rolls (White Winter and Sunset Strip). Our orders came separately, but evenly spaced out. \n\nNigiri: The maguro was fresh, the albacore was very soft, and the ika was good too. The rice was a little too warm for my liking though. \nRolls: Both rolls weren't very tightly rolled and didn't seem to have enough rice to even hold everything together. The Sunset Strip roll was decent, but they went a little overboard with the green onion garnish. The White Winter roll was better made, but still just an average roll. The rolls seemed a bit \"skinny\" too, probably not enough rice. They're also a bit heavy-handed with sauces too. \nOysters: Presentation was blah, and there was too much of the shredded radish and white onion, making it a bit hard to eat in one go. But the oysters were nice and creamy, and the sauce was good (wish they gave a bit more). \n\nService was good. They don't give you a teapot, but they refill often enough that you never have an empty cup. Our bill came out to $46 before tip. \n\nOverall, average sushi and no big complaints.", "author": "Doris K."}

I don't really see myself coming here all the time, but I have been here several times in the past with not too many memorable experiences.\n\nI did come here yesterday with my grandma because she wanted Japanese food, so because this is the closest restaurant to us, we decided to take a little walk over. They greeted as we walked in and gave us ice water and tea. We got their lunch special bento boxes; I got the salmon teriyaki with sashimi (substituted from the tempura for same price!) and four small pieces of California rolls ($7.95). My grandma got the chicken teriyaki with tempura and Cali roll as well ($7.50). Both came with a small slab of wasabi, miso soup, rice, and a little side of salad. I was pretty full afterwards. A part of me was tempted to try their chirashi bowl for $12.95, which I thought was a fairly good price. I think next time I will go for that, and also one of their specialty rolls.\n\nThe service was good. We got our food pretty fast despite how many people were there and the lady kept refilling our waters and tea. \n\nThe restaurant is a little squished with not too much room, and the lighting isn't all that great. There are always flies at the door when you walk in which is pretty gross. They do have pictures of people eating and showing off their experience in the restaurant which is kinda cool, since you don't see that very often.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

I wanted the white tuna roll since it was supposed to be topped with wasabi tobiko (not sure how to spell it, but its the tiny fish egg, things..). I enjoyed the white wonderland since it was super saucy and I love my sushi saucy. But as for the Super white tuna roll, I was kind of disappointed. I didn't quite taste wasabi in the tiny balls. We also got the sunset roll which was pretty good as well. I enjoyed the atmosphere more so than Sushi Raw. The parking was okay, not too hard to find.

It's a small place that seems a bit hidden away between the two neighboring buildings. \n\nI got a table for three during dinner time. I often check Yelp reviews for food recommendations; sadly, the most popular suggestion was the LUNCH special. However, we did try the super dynamite roll as well as the winter wonderland roll. As far as specialty rolls go, both are priced very well for what they give you. I believe they were in the $7-9 range. From past dining experiences around the city, they could have easily charged $10+ for the rolls. Both rolls tasted fresh and were accompanied with delicious sauces drizzled on top. I personally liked the super dynamite roll a little more because it was spicy. \n\nSushi Zen offers good quality at good pricing and I would love to try the lunch special one day.

The first roll I really didn't care for (nothing about the quality of the fish; I just didn't personally care for the flavors of the sauce with the fish) so I got a california roll (which was awesome-- fresh crab!).  I insisted on paying for the first because it was a taste preference, not a quality, yet they insisted on taking it off my bill.\n\nWhen I got in the restaurant, I realized I left my phone laying out in the car.

She tried to offer me two pieces of a different fish, on the house, but after being grossed out by what I ate, I did not want that. She stated that the owner wasn't there and since she already rang me up for the meal, she was not able to do anything, and walked away. I waited for her to return to the table, paid my bill and told her that the way she handled it was bad for business.

Sometimes the sashimi slices (4) are a bit too cold, almost like they haven't thawed properly (?). Sometimes the katsu is a bit underwhelming. The California roll (4), made with fake crab, always taste the same to me and I'm not complaining. \n\nBut I mean, how can you go wrong for an $11 sushi lunch after tax and tip? There's variety and rice, soup, salad and tea to accompany it. You could get a $7.99 tray of sushi at Safeway or a sit-down meal for just a little bit more. \n\nI've had their rolls before, and they're pretty good, but I'm always too full if I come by myself!", "author": "Jenna Rose F."}

It's a small, no-frills joint, run by Chinese people.  Chinese-owned Japanese restaurant.  In SF, that label usually speaks for itself.  But I'll do some further explaining myself. :)\n\nAs already mentioned, the rolls aren't very special.  They're decent, though.  Nothing memorable, but I was satisfied.  We ordered 5 or 6 rolls between the four of us, and the food came out SUPER quick.  That's definitely appreciated.  Although, it was around 7:30pm on a Friday night, and we were the only people in the restaurant, so that may partly explain the efficiency.  \n\nAnyway, back to the food.  Most of the rolls were your standard ones, and the fish was good enough.  There was, however, one STANDOUT roll that I REALLY enjoyed.  The Crunchy California Roll.  It was basically a breaded and deep-fried California roll. MMM!  The roll was huge, and it was delicious.  This, I would get again.  Everything else = meh.  \n\nAside from the mostly average food, there are a couple non-food things that I liked:\n\n+ Decor: very homey, and there were pictures of all their patrons covering their walls, which was cute.  I didn't quite understand the, what looked like children's drawings (including one of Sailor Moon) on printer paper on the walls, but maybe the owners have kids, and that was their artwork?  Cute, though.\n\n+ Price: Okay, now THIS is the best part. THIS PLACE IS SO CHEAP OMG.   Some of the rolls we got were like $3.50 or something, which is crazy cheap, considering they still give you like 6-8 pieces of the sushi.  Maybe this means the quality of the fish is really subpar, but whatever! It still tastes fine, and really, you can't beat the price!\n\n+ Service: I swear, the waitress was filling our tea/water every 5 minutes, I never had a less-than-full cup of tea! \n\nEven though the sushi isn't amazing (then again, I don't know what amazing sushi tastes like), I like this place. It's super cheap, it's homey, the service is fast, and they let us just sit there for quite a long time, chatting away on a chilly Friday night in the good ol' Avenues.  \n\nAnd that, my friends, is awesome. :)", "author": "Vivian C."}

The workers did nothing to quiet them down and all the other tables around them kind of just stared with disgust. \n\nThe service is pretty appalling, or just the waiter - the short Asian guy with a bowl cut. When the waiter was taking down our orders, he abruptly stopped us and told us that they don't split the check for individuals. Okay.. thank you for the fun fact. The food took a while to come and for the most part, the waiter didn't really come back. It's slightly pricey for the size but it's not something to freak out about. About most of us got our meals and started eating, some of the food was still missing. We were missing one roll and ALL the tempura for my friend's tempura udon. It was incredibly difficult to get the waiters attention since they were literally in love with the table of drunk girls. The sushi chef was the one who saw our hands waving and had to notify the waiter of our needs. That's just sad.\n\nThe chicken katsu donburi was really good. The super dynamite roll is still one of my favorites. The rest of the food was alright and pretty standard (udon, chicken teriyaki). My friend ordered the butter yaki and the waiter gave her rice and said it was on the house. Either that was a sweet gesture or a straight up lie. The waitress felt bad about their service (she should be) and gave us all free mango ice cream. Since we had a party of six, the tips is already included so we HAD to pay waiter more than he deserved.\n\nPerhaps it's a bad experience and even if everything worked out nicely, at most it would get 3 stars for the food.", "author": "Ryan L."}

Just a husband and wife running business, serving good food and give all their best to their customers. Honest and sincere. \n\nThe student lunch specials are probably the best deal EVER. The salmon teriyaki over rice is only $4.50. If you go to Safeway and get a salmon steak like that will probably cost you more. How is that even possible? \n\nThey have so many special rolls and all of them are so good. I especially like their Winter Wonderland, Pink Dragon Roll, and Super Dynamite. \n\nSo it's good food, a little above average, and EXCELLENT service. I always leave this place satisfied and happy. Sometimes they'll also give us dessert on the house... ice cream or oranges cut into roses. \n\nI come here almost everyday for the past month. One Sunday in the afternoon they were closed, I had to go to another sushi place down the block... I paid double and only got half the portion.

We were greeted by the owner - but only because he thought we were part of \"the last three\" of a party they were hosting. Um, my bf and I do not count as three people btw. Anyway, we were seated promptly in a four-seat table. (I wish they had two seat tables, that way, it's a little more personal.) While we read the menu to decide what to order, the party of 15(?) next to us engaged in the fun game of sake bomb. It kept us entertained for a bit since we had to wait a while to get our order taken.\n\nAbout ten minutes or so, the waitress came to our table to take our order. I ordered the chicken teriyaki and tempura combination dinner, the bf ordered the unagi-don, and we decided on the super dynamite roll to share. The super dynamite roll arrived first. Since the roll was fried, it was really crunchy. The roll was cut into ten thin slices, making it easy to fit into our mouths. In a way, it was kind of like an appetizer. A yummy appetizer, at that.\n\nThe bf's unagi-don was huge! The portion of bbq eel was... more than enough to feed him but he finished it all anyway. (Hehe, fatty.) Needless to say, I think my portion was food was huge as well. The tempura was more memorable. Fried long green beans, sweet potato, broccoli, and shrimp - all very good. The chicken teriyaki, miso soup, rice, and salad was the standard Japanese bento boxes quality - nothing bad about it at all.\n\nAll in all, another satisfying meal for two for $30.", "author": "Annie S."}

The first thing that came out was the watery miso soup, which lead me to think this place was going to suck. The sushi was really nothing special and the hamachi kama was disappointing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-05", "description": "Popped in for a quick lunch and split three rolls: Winter Wonderland, Wasabi Hama, Sunset Strip. They were pretty good, but nothing more special than I've gotten other assorted sushi places I've been. If anything, I kind of thought there were sometimes a few too many things going on, which made for a lot of flavors competing with each other. Also pretty average price for rolls like this - maybe even slightly underaverage for SF, I'm not sure.\n\nThe service was extremely quick, but there were only two other tables occupied at the time, so I guess that's good!

I didn't see the incident myself, but I did see the tips of her ponytail come within a hair's breadth of the sushi she was serving to the table 3 feet away from us. Her long pony tail, which was pulled to the left side of her head, came down about half way between her shoulder and waist. My daughter has been to the restaurant over 5 times in the last couple of months, and my husband and I have been there twice within the last month.

They were pretty decent though.  That's okay because it left more room in my stomach to enjoy the spicy yellowtail roll that I order.  Here instead of the usual six pieces, they cut it into eight, with the rice outside which for this type of roll is what I prefer.  The size of each one is smaller that in a way that makes them more enjoyable.\n\nThey also have large hot sake for a good price: $4.95 (as I recall).

Minor adjustment, I know, but they also brought out rolls cut in 8's (not just 6's) once the figured out we were all sharing all of the various rolls.

I got the Winter Wonderland (Good, but needed spice or something to cut the two sauces that were both sweet) and split a Veggie Tempura dinner (Not much variety, tempura sauce was bland, ok portioning) with Momo E. Some other things that were ordered were:\n\nKappa Maki (add cream cheese): Originally B. ordered this but they brought out tekka maki but B. doesn't like raw fish so there was no way she was going to eat the tekka maki AND it didn't have cream cheese. Despite it being an easy fix, our waitress dragged her feet in just bringing us the correct maki. And when she did bring us another it was an avocado maki and not kappa (cucumber).\nSalmon Teriyaki dinner: Decent, moist, good portioning. Comes with the usual miso, rice, and salad.\nChicken Teriyaki dinner: Again good portioning, typical chicken teriyaki.\nChirashi: This was super disappointing. For around $13 this was not worth the money what so ever. All the fish looked eh and we definitely would have preferred better quality fish then more quantity. What bothered me the most was that there was an entire layer of wakame aka filler.\n\nDespite the mix up with the Kappa maki the service was not bad on the whole, although most of this was due to another waitress not our waitress.

Very tender meat and good portion.\n\nSUNSET STRIP ROLL: very good! no complaints, it was our best roll. had unagi inside topped with raw tuna, hamachi, topped with a sweet sauce and their spepcial house sauce.\n\nPINK DRAGON ROLL: not up to par. it was supposed to be baked but it wasn't and when we asked our waiter if this was our order he said yes. we asked again because it was supposed to be baked. after all of us had a piece to try...we concluded that it wasn't the roll we had ordered, so we notified the waiter again. FINALLY, he asked the chef to make a new one. and waiting almost 40 minutes later, it came. WACK! that is so not cool.  Good thing we had other food keeping our tummies full and had a lot of catching up to do.\n\nTARAVAL ROLL: not what the menu made it seem like. i thought it was made very poorly. It had avocado, crab meat and hamachi, but it didn't taste all that great. very dissappointed.\n\nWe really enjoyed the Tuna poki, hamachi kama, and the sunset strip.\n\nDid not enjoy the service too much, especially when the waiter tried to play it off as if the pink dragon roll was supposed to be the way it came. NO, my friend noticed because she can't eat raw food.  He wasn't even apologetic at all that they tried to serve us the wrong roll.  It gave me the feeling as if he knew they made it wrong, but didn't say anything about it...thinking that we wouldn't notice it. THAT'S WRONG!!!\n\nI would give it another shot again, if the waiter who served us is NOT WORKING.", "author": "Sarah F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-14", "description": "It's mad busy here on a Friday night due to a large birthday party group taking over half the restaurant.  But with it being only a party of two, we were able to squeeze into the sushi bar with minimal wait.  Behind the sushi chef lies a variety of sake bottles making it a pretty display behind him.\n\nIt's loud here, and not just because of the large group.  The employees are hollering at each other in Cantonese.  If I didn't see Japanese food on the menu, I would think we were in the middle of the lunch rush at a fast-paced Chinese food place.\n\nAfter getting our orders in, complimentary miso soup arrived.  Not a bad start when you get free stuff.  To start, Lorna D. ordered the Tuna Poki ($7.95).  It looks like a decent amount, until you realize how much seaweed salad is lurking underneath.  A bit misleading if I do say so myself.  It was okay, not spectacular or anything.  I ordered the Sashimi Chef's Choice ($17.95), which is about 15 pieces.  The chef asked if I ate surf clam, and included that on my dish.  I jokingly said I also eat ikura and uni if he wanted to add that on there too, and not only did he say a definite no, but I got a definite no from the waiter saying it'll cost more, blah blah blah.  (Duh, I know that!)  My final sashimi order included 3 pieces of maguro, 2 pieces of albacore, 2 pieces of hotate, 3 pieces of sake, 2 pieces of surf clam, and 3 pieces of hamachi.  Overall, the sashimi was decent.  The albacore was a bit mushier than I would have preferred and the scallop wasn't that great either.  \n\nLorna D. ordered two rolls - the Lazy Summer Roll ($8.50) and the Energy Roll ($8.95).  The Lazy Summer Roll was refreshing with the fresh cucumber.  The Energy Roll was okay, I couldn't really taste the mango because of everything else in there.  And there's a spicy sauce all around the roll, which was a killer for Lorna D. since she's not a spicy eater.  \n\nWe also got complimentary ice cream (vanilla, green tea, or mango) to close out our meal.\n\nService - the waiter and waitress both reached in front and across from me to get things or to refill my glass. At one point, I was facing my dining companion only to see this arm come right in front of me to refill the tea cups.  I watched as the tea pot leaked tea onto our sushi rolls.  (Why couldn't he go around, there was plenty of room on both sides of us?)  The waiter was also hollering in my ear a lot - whether he was talking to me or shouting to the chef.  \n\nOverall, it's an okay place.  Prices aren't ridiculously expensive or anything and they offer combo lunch specials for a pretty good price too.  I wouldn't come here for a date or if I wanted high grade sushi.\n\n(You can see pics of our eating in the business profile section!)\n\nThey are open Mondays through Saturdays from 11 am to 9:30 pm.  They do close for an hour from 4 pm to 5 pm.  And stay open until 10 pm on Fridays and Saturdays.  They are only open for dinner on Sundays from 4:30 to 9:30 pm.", "author": "Teri C."}

But I feel like Sushi Zen earned it. My girlfriend and I have been here on many occasions, and it has become our favorite Japanese restaurant in the Bay Area. It is consistently excellent, and while you might find slightly better sushi at a very high end (read: expensive) place, in terms of value, we haven't found better Japanese food anywhere. Furthermore, some Japanese restaurants do sushi fine, but fall apart when it comes to the other items on the menu. Not Sushi Zen--while the sushi is consistently fresh and delicious, they also make outstanding tempura (so light and crispy!), udon, tonkatsu, you name it. Their prices are extremely reasonable (including for sake!), the service is exceptionally friendly, and there's almost never a wait. Your dishes come out as they're ready, so sometimes the order of arrival may be a bit off (a main dish before an appetizer, for example), but we don't really care about that. It's worth it to get everything super fresh as soon as it comes out of the kitchen. We love you, Sushi Zen!", "author": "Moses G."}

The hamachi nigiri was very fresh, the tempura was perfectly battered and there was plenty of it, and the rolls were the only thing that left something to be desired. They were filling and mostly good, but some of the fish used wasn't so good.\n\nMiso soup was complementary, hot tea and water were always refilled quickly.\n\nIt's odd to see that the nigiri was tasty and the rolls were less satisfying, usually my experience is the other way around.

It's the Sunset so street parking is everywhere along with some meters. \n\nFood:  4/5\nI went with the edamame, hamachi nigiri, California crunch roll and the super dynamite.   The food came quick and was prepared nicely. Everything was on par based on price. I should probably try some of the \"less dressed\" rolls next time. The combo I made was a little much. The nigiri was great though so I ordered a second round of that. \n\nService: 3/5\nThe food came quick but considering how slow it was when I was there it should have been a little quicker when it came to refills and getting the check.

I must say I was very disappointed with the food and the service. \n\nI was with 3 other people and we ordered tempura udon, tonkatsu donburi, and chicken teriyaki. When I tried to order some special rolls, the waiter said it was too much food for us already. Really? You are going to tell me that we can't order more food because it's a lot of food? I thought most places would tell you that you didn't order enough. I usually appreciate it when the servers advise you not to order too much food, but our server was very rude about it. \n\nWe got our food in about 15 minutes. Nothing really special to write about. The chicken teriyaki was dry, the tempura was mostly batter, and the udon broth was very salty. I'm actually glad we didn't get the rolls we wanted to order in the beginning.\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking of giving Sushi Zen 2 stars and maybe, just maybe, give them another chance. That is until it came time to pay the bill. \n\nOur bill came out to $28. We gave them $35. The server takes our money. He doesn't ask us if we need change nor did we tell him that we didn't need change. He assumed that we didn't need change and that was his tip! Really?

Since then it has become one of my favorite sushi spots in the city,\n\nIt is a cozy little place with a homey feel.  The service is friendly, attentive, so accommodative, and the food comes out pretty quick.  There's a nice selection of bento boxes and lunch specials for  a cheap price.  Their rolls taste great and looks fabulous.  The sashimi is fresh and tasty and more importantly for all the uni lovers out there, the uni is amazingly sweet and fresh.  Order a sake bomb and the sushi chef will drink one with you.  Order another sake bomb and the chef will drink another with you.  Basically, he will drink with you as many as you order.  What can I say, they are warm, welcoming, and friendly.  The best part of all, dessert is FREE!  Yes, it's true, choose your pick of mango or classic green tea flavor ice cream!\n\nI'm an avid sushi lover and have had many meals of great, good, and bad sushi so I would consider myself to know the quality of fresh fish when I taste it.

It was around noon and I expected it to be busy, but surprisingly, the restaurant was barely filled. The sushi chef is so friendly, and greets everyone as they come and go. Service was average. My teacup was never less than half-filled. We ordered the British Columbia (BC) roll, the King Kong roll, the tempura appetizer, and the 9 or 13 piece sake sashimi (don't remember, sorry!). The menu states that the sashimi is assorted, but they're okay with giving you all salmon or whatever you prefer, so just ask the waiters. The BC roll was definitely my favorite of the two rolls. The lemon is so refreshing; it makes the sushi taste super fresh. The sashimi was really delicious and fresh as well! Everything was good, but I'm disappointed with their small menu, especially when it comes to the rolls they offer.

The sushi chef and his help for the evening are some happy-go-lucky people, and rightfully so! Their business is successful and their customer service is literally unparalleled in the Sunset.\n\nMy boyfriend and I walked over to the Sushi Zen and we knew we were going to be back. Why, you ask? $3.00 student lunch special!!! @#$#@ tight!!! Katsu, Chicken Teriyaki, 2 rolls of sushi, all for $3 each! Forget Dragon City, which is right next door and has yet to be Yelp'ed, I'm coming to the Sushi Zen for lunch.\n\nThe waiter was seriously ninja like. I think I caught him peeping behind the noren (Japanese curtain thing) from the kitchen checking to see if I had enough water; and he never ONCE let my cup get remotely half empty. He was great and was genuinely proud of the food he was serving us - and good attitudes and great customer service is definitely hard to find in the Sunset.\n\nOk, so I'll be honest. I'm Japanese and I hate fish. The Japanese side of my family also owns a successful fish market in Berkeley. Sue me. But if there is one thing about every hapa girl that hates fish, it's this: we LOVE us some California Roll!! It was excellent here at the Sushi Zen and I also loved the Gyoza. Yeah, it was probably \"the frozen kind\"    and I *think* we sell that exact same kind at our store in Berkeley, but who the hell cares...it was good, piping hot, inexpensive, and I didn't have to make it OR clean it up. Super cool.\n\nMy boyfriend - fish fan all the way - got the dynamite roll which he really liked. The presentation was beautiful as well. Since the Sushi Zen is so close to our apartment and the service was so great - did I mention that I ordered CA roll, watched the chef make it, and it was served in less than 2 minutes!?! - we'll definitely be back again.

Sushi Zen offers a variety of fresh rolls for a moderate price (around 10 dollars a roll). My boyfriend and I usually get a dinner combination that comes with some type of meat, rice, house salad, and tempura along with two rolls. Our bill comes out to under 40 each time. The rolls are pretty good, my favorite is the Crazy roll. They also have common rolls such as the 49er roll or the Spider roll. Service is good for the most part. Sometimes, it's really good and others it is average.", "author": "Khanh C."}

My 5 friends and i arrived, and they only set out 2 menus for us. I didn't receive chopsticks till I finally got a waiter's attention after several tries. Most of the fish was not incredibly fresh, and our raw oysters weren't good at all. The waiters gave us the wrong order a few times and had a hard time keeping track of what we had ordered. I understand tonight was a busy night for them, but the service was incredibly poor. The waiters yelled to people in line that our table would be leaving before we even received our whole order. Our rolls fell apart before we could even pick them up. I would never come back here. The people in line for this place are much better off at another restaurant.", "author": "carrie l."}

The atmosphere is spectacular and the staff are great.

I have a group of about 20 coming soon and they are still able to fit us in, even though the place is snug.  I've also been to their restaurant during the Winter holiday and I have seen loyal groups that come and are always having a good time.\n\n-The service is usually great, with Sushi Chef Kevin joining in the sake festivities if you ask him to.  Also, the staff are pretty attentive and they usually offer me ice cream on the house at the end (they have the best green tea ice cream I have ever tasted!).  They familiarize frequent faces and are always giving an energetic \"hello\" and \"thank you, goodbye.\"\n\n-The prices are very reasonable with specialty rolls ranging around $8-13 bucks.\n\n-My recommendation foodwise belongs to the British Colombia Roll and the Winter Wonderland.  From time to time, I also like ordering their raw oysters and Chicken Yaki Udon...delish!  From what I have tasted at Sushi Zen, I have yet to be disappointed by any of their sushi rolls.\n\nCons:\n- They can be a little tight on space at times when it is a busy night, but that's what you kind of have to expect with sushi restaurants in SF.  \n\n-There is metered street parking that may be hard to snatch up sometimes but usually isn't a really big problem.\n\nI really do adore this place.  Sometimes they will have their polaroid camera out, take pictures of their patrons and then post them up along their wall.  It isn't a super trendy place but definitely a place where you can go with your friends and still be able to converse with one another (none of that loud blasting music joints).

I say the latter not because I'm a crotchety old man, but because it took over my favorite neighborhood hole in the wall Vietnamese joint. One night over two months ago, I was hankering for a pho fix and drove on autopilot to Lam's and poof, it had upped and left, only to be replaced by this posher doppelganger.\nSo when I walked in, it was with a shifty gaze and heavy heart for the dearly departed for all things rare and brothy. I plopped down, and set my sights on a bowl of tempura udon. Dammit, if I couldn't have the real deal, I was for sure going to have something resembling a bowl of soup.\nThe decor is clean, simple, pastel colored, and is most akin to a Chinese dessert house you would see in the Richmond. This is not surprising as the owners are my peoples. The sushi chef made it a point to greet me when I came in and seemed very friendly. The waitress on hand was also quite polite.\nHow was the udon you ask? Functional, somewhat predictable, and satisfied my appetite. The soup wasn't the best, but not nearly the worst. I came on a good night though, as I ran into an old classmate friend of mine who happened to know the sushi chef. Because of that, he hooked up us up with a complimentary super dynamite roll, which I quite enjoyed for its spicy tuna and tempura batter goodness.\nAll in all, it wasn't a bad experience, considering I came in with such suspicion and ill will.", "author": "Kevin A."}

Trust me, we were never sad once during this meal.  It's that good.  You know how some restaurants give you a huge stack of rice, and almost no sushi in their nigiri?  This place gives you such  huge slices of meat I had to find the RICE!\n\nI think that the sushi chef's name is Kevin.  Well, assuming it is, Kevin is an amazing guy.  He cuts with such precision and gives such generous portions, at least at the bar.  The guy refilling our tea and taking empty plates away was very prompt.\n\nBut I'm missing the point.  The food is SO FREAKING GOOD.  First, I got the tempura and gyoza as appetizers, and we both had a miso soup.  Good, not overcooked at all, nice and warm, too.  I ate the shrimp tempura, and ex ate the vegetable ones.  So tasty.  We were fighting over who gets the last gyoza, in a way.  It was good.\n\nI bought the 15 piece chef's choice sashimi (It's a combo on the back of the menu), and the best was the whitefin tuna, and the salmon...and the scallops...and the...okay, they were all super good.  They kept bringing us hot tea, which was interesting, because we stayed for over 2 hours just talking with Kevin, and the tea was still hot.  But I digress.  After the 15 piece sashimi, we had the Spicy Scallop Hotate.  Good, but VERY spicy.  I love spicy, though.  Very good.  Then I had 2 servings (4 pieces) of the whitefin tuna nigiri.  Kevin (you know, maybe it was Ken.  I was too immersed in my food to be paying that much attention.  Anyone know his name?) gave me 5 pieces, said that he \"had some extra\".  Kudos there...then he gave us a $7.50  (this place is cheap, so that's one of their more expensive combos) of this seared whitefin tuna with lots of caviar, and some radish and garnish.  I even ate the garnish.  It was so delicious.  Did I mention, GAVE us?  He just decided to make it (it was a lull at about 7:30 PM, some regulars inside, but mainly just us two were eating), and give it to us free.\n\nSo then, he gave us this orange dessert thing.  It was like, a fruit plate, with 4 small pieces of mango and two entire oranges cut up.  Very asian style desert.  He made the top of the orange into a little umbrella over the orange with a toothpick.  Oh, right, that was free too.  Yup, he just gave it to us.  Love this guy.\n\nAlso, this place was super cheap.  Oh, did I mention my ex also got a huge sushi roll for super cheap?  There are $4.95 rolls for us college kids.  The most expensive roll is about $11.95, I think, and that's the one with the most meat (understandable)\nOh, and he's very generous with the roe and caviar.  He just throws huge piles on there, so let him know if you don't like much of that.  Personally, I LOVE fish eggs, especially on my sushi, so it was a big plus.\n\nJust go there.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nTrust me.", "author": "David P."}

The waiter that I speak to every time on the phone told me, \"No, you cannot do that.\" Since, I have did this countless of times I counter back that I do this all the time. He gave an sigh and went to ask the owner, and came back to tell me it was going to cost $3 to do the switch. Of course no I am not going to order it anymore with that attitude. He continued to argue with me that I must have made a mistake it cannot be \"their restaurant\", they never allow free substitution. I would not have been so angry if they have not made comments about me within earshot. Excuse me, I speak Cantonese too. Plus the food is not as good as before. There were a couple of times that the tempura batter was still raw and the rolls were falling apart. I almost took out my Sushi Zen receipts that I had in my wallet to show him how wrong he and the owner was, but decided not to.", "author": "Erica B."}

The place is small but the quality of the food was good--very fresh.  Customer service is stellar--was greeted very loudly but the entire staff upon entering.  Not a huge selection but had all my favorites--their Super Dynamite Roll is really good.", "author": "deeks .."}

I love these guys, they cheer every time I walk in to pick up my lunch order of Sushi D-how could you NOT love that? I always have lunch here and it's great for eating in or takeout. The guys who work here are super friendly and the sushi is always good. I have had a bit of a fishy-tasting roll every now and then, but hey, it happens everywhere. Good lunch specials, never been for dinner but the special rolls look great! Yum!", "author": "Alexis D."}

The service there inst all that great, they sometimes take a while for ur order or for even a glass of water. but the food is pretty good. i go to Lincoln so at lunch u just pick up a box of katsu, terryaki chicken, or spicy chicken over rice for $3.50. not really nice to teenagers. But if u just go there for dinner or something theyre a lil better. i dig it", "author": "Preston L."}

(-1 star for needing a tip to be nice) he started being nice and saying thank you a ton. i walked out for a bit and come back in and wait for my food, then he offers me a seat with a cup of tea. how nice. \n\noverall as good and decent this place was, i hate that it takes a nice tip for some nice service. won't be coming back. (-1 star because i'm still unhappy!)", "author": "Rhonda H."}

Mediocre sushi for CHEAP prices. You can't go wrong for a $6 bento box. The waiters are attentive and generally quick. And their to-go lunch specials are a steal! Come on a school day and the entire front door will be blocked by mobs of high school kids.", "author": "Sheri L."}

A relative of mine from NYC who has visited many parts of the world said it was the best she's tasted and when visiting again, insisted we go to \"Kevin's.\"  Another friend of mine who was flying the same day to Seattle for a week, actually packed some up in a small cooler to take to her family. I've eaten here sometimes 3 times a week since he opened a year and a half ago and t remainss one of my 2 favorite restaurants in SF-the other being Regent Thai.", "author": "mary n."}
