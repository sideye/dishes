We got an email from the owner after we posted the feedback on Yelp and he admitted the mistake. They provided us with 3 boxes of veg momos and delivered it to my office without any charge. The momos were really tasty and were same as we wanted it to be. Thanks to Gorkha Kitchen and will definitely revisit you. \n\nMy first experience with Gorkha Kitchen was really good, and I loved their momos, and that's why I decided that on my wife's birthday I will order momos from here. \n\nOn 24th August 2018, I ordered six sets of Vegetarian Momos(1 set = 6 pieces), and I specifically mentioned that I want the Vegetarian Momos\n\nInstead of giving us Vegetarian Momos these guys gave us three sets of non-vegetarian momos, and when we served those momos in front of our guests after the first bite, they realize something is wrong. \n\nWe immediately called the restaurant, and they were not ready to accept there mistake.\n\nSomehow we were able to manage the moment as the Party was already spoiled and tried to serve the other 3 set of Vegetarian Momos, the outer flour coating was so hard and thick, It was practically impossible to eat it.\n\nHighly disappointed and I am not recommending this place to anyone.", "author": "Prashant L."}

Decided to order lunch / brunch from Gorkha Kitchen on Saturday, August 11th. I placed a delivery order through their website at 11:38am. It arrived at 12:47pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Everest Chicken Momo: Chicken dumpling filled with minced chicken, herbs and spices served with homemade fire-roasted tomato and sesame chutney ($7.95)\n*Samosa: Mildly spiced potatoes and peas, served with extra mint sauce, 2 pcs, no tamarind sauce ($5.35)\n*Chicken Tikka Masala: Boneless white meat chicken cooked to perfection in the tandoor, then simmered Indian classic sauce, Extra spicy ($13.45)\n*Bullet Naan: Naan stuffed with chilies, garlic and cilantro ($2.95)\n*Garlic Naan: Fluffy Naan with cilantro and a hint of roasted garlic ($2.95)\n\nIf you order through their site, some dishes are priced a little lower. The samosas are normally $5.95 and the tikka masala $14.95, so I saved $2.10 ordering through their site versus another delivery service. Just something to keep in mind if you want to get delivery from Gorkha.\n\nI adored the naan. If was soft with a nice chew. And a good amount of garlic, chilis, etc. The tikka masala had a nice heat as I asked for it extra spicy. And it was nice and creamy. But I did find the curry a touch too sweet. The momos were good. The wrapper had a nice chew and they were very meaty. Also, that tomato and sesame chutney was very tasty. The samosas were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Very happy they gave me extra mint chutney as one side was enough for one samosa. I had enough for both.\n\nDefinitely fulfilled my Indian food craving. Such a great option when I need something warm and satisfying.", "author": "Elena N."}

There are prayer flags hanging and good music playing. Unlike a lot of other SF restaurants, this one is relatively quiet and intimate. You get a free glass of wine with a yelp check in, and Gorkha Kitchen honors that. Their house wine is tasty and delightful to sip on.\n\nThe food is incredible, though! We ordered the chicken chili, buff momo, and naan to start. The momo was as you'd expect--flavorful and very mildly spicy. The chicken chili was the perfect amount of spicy and 100% delicious. For entrees, we got the goat curry dhal bat and the butter chicken. So, butter chicken is a really common thing that everyone's had a ton of, but this butter chicken is something else!!!! The chicken itself has a slightly charred, smoky taste to it and the sauce is creamy and sweet--this is the most crave-able chicken I've ever had. I highly recommend trying it, even if you're the type of person who likes to order more exotic dishes. The goat was also super tasty, and we loved the saut\u00e9ed vegetables that came with it. \n\nI'd say the only bad thing is that they seem to be out of a lot of the desserts that they offer, but honestly, the food was so incredibly good that this didn't upset me and I'd easily still give this restaurant 5 stars.  \n\nOverall, the service was awesome and the food was even better!

I might just order two of these and some rice next time!\n\nThe chicken curry has BONED chicken and is a little more watery but still very flavorful. Little salty \n\nEggplant is super flavorful and not too oily. \n\nButter chicken is super buttery. Good but a little too much for me. \n\nChicken biryani was very good. Love it. It does come with nuts and raisins.  One time they took my request to not put those in. And one time the receipt clearly had handwriting to say no nut and raisins, but it was full of them.  So who knows.\n\nMomos seem like any other Ive had so it's ok. \n\nThey offer 10% off if you order directly from their site but I was out of their delivery radius on their site so I ordered through yelp instead (grubhub). I wish I could order from their site! \n\nI also ordered UberEats from here and that was a much faster delivery and a flat $4.99 delivery fee (no surge pricing time).  I'm sure the owner would prefer not to pay a commission but if you need some guarantee and tracking on your order, it might be easier to order UberEats.", "author": "Traci H."}

A mix of crowds was here which is always good. Not too noisy, not too hipster or Americanized. It felt authentic and also modern/clean.\n\nFood: (4/5) Now I actually enjoyed the food, but this is where I critiqued a lot of items. We got:\n\n1) Dal Bhat Thakari Platter (4/5). If you're not super sold on ordering a certain dish, I 100% recommend this. For $19, you get so many items, it's amazing. (Keep reading for my breakdown of every little thing you get). I'm also glad I got this for the IG Pics LOL. I was hella feeling those tiny metal bowls on a metal platter. This platter meal includes:\na) Curry - (5/5) Choice of goat, chicken, veggie. I chose chicken. This was my favorite. Tomato-based, sweeter, which I like. It wasn't thick so it was hard to put on top of the naan. The chicken however was so tender and melt in your mouth. It was an expected happy surprise. I've had some chicken curries where the meat was like a brick but it's usually all about the sauce so I'm fine. \nb) Dal - (5/5) Soup with lentils I believe. Yummy. Very easy to eat. \nc) Rice - (5/5) Nothing special. Didn't really need it since you also have naan. Carb overkill?!\nd) Naan - (5/5) The naan was one of my favorite things. It wasn't extra fluffy like I normally like my naan, but it didn't feel lacking or plain either. I've definitely had worse naan. It was fresh and warm. It looked slightly greasy, but I couldn't stop eating it. Reminded me of Chinese green onion pancakes, my favorite. NOMNOM.\ne) Vegetable of the Day (4.5/5) - Salad with SUPER creamy dressing. Totally overdressed, but still delicious for people who hate salads. I tend to underdress my salad to save calories. Wish the dressing came on the side.\nf) Vegetable of the Day x2 (2.5/5) - It was a spinach dish that wasn't that bad actually. It was just so salty that I tried to wash it with water even. I wasn't trying to keep eating extra rice to compensate.\nf) Chutney (0/5) - Spit this out. I thought chutneys were sweet. I'm Asian and I've had my fair share of super pickled, and/or spicy and/or fermented pungent things to eat with rice. I didn't like this at all. But that didn't bother me since it was so small and just extra.\ng) Cup of Yogurt (4/5) Nothing special, but loved that it was provided. Tart yogurt yummy. I had to prioritize my stomach though so I didn't finish this.\nh) Thali (4/5) - It doesn't say on the menu, but apparently the server told us that the platter came with a dessert/thali which happened to be rice pudding. Not the best rice pudding I've ever had but I LOVE rice pudding. It was different. It wasn't too sweet. It was perfect in terms of flavor. However, it was oddly cold (to the point of having some icicles in some parts) and had bits of coconut and other textural mysteries lol! But, the sweetness and flavoring was perfect!\n\n2) The bf got the lamb vindaloo and a side of rice. It proved to be too much food for the both of us so we took most of his to go. The lamb vindaloo was (5/5). Yummy!", "author": "Josie W."}

Small tables in the front and large Indian style seating in the back.\nService: amazing. The people are so genial and happy.  Especially Lum! Our favorite server.\nTaste: absolutely delicious. One of a kind \n\nWowed my socks off. Left here craving it for another week. Came back the next day kind of good. Goodness that is heavy on your heart like young love. \n\nThis Indian Himalayan joint outperforms in all categories consumers need. From the moment you walk in they have you at hello with a smile like good old cordial pals.  They remind me of that friend everyone has who is sumptuous in their pleasantries and peculiar in one way or another. Peculiar were their triangle hats they wore.  It just made it all the more enjoyable.  Later to find out these hats were reputed throughout Nepal as being worn by the Gorkha army and the small crosswords emblem pinned to it is a Gorkha army signature weaponry known as the Kukri.  The inward curved machetes are revered. The weapons are deftly wielded akimbo to a solider and the conspicuous look has made the Nepali military renown.  So now I imagine a blood crazed militant coming out with my goat curry and his Gorkha army hat.  Haha just kidding.  ;)\n\nWe were seated in the front tables which I believe is for the most casual diners. It seemed much more intimate in the back, Indian style seated cushions. No one was sorted about these, so I'm not sure if it must be a special request section. The front tables are nice enough: white table cloth with floriferous vases.  We were served some kind of large dried out cracker with a couple of sauces that were tangy and sweet. Our server was punctual and attentive.\n\nOur food came out with a demanding demeanor, sizzling so every eye in the room  branded it to brain.  That would be the lamb shish kabob. Best lamb I've ever had. Thick, juicy tender flanks served over onion and pepper.  Highly recommend if your a shepherd of that sort of taste. I got the goat curry, hot and spicy the way I like it. Served over rice, the bites of goat and sauce amalgamate to a savory entree that will not go forgotten easily.\n\nIn the case that 'you should save money and not go out to eat' I would argue sometimes addictions are stronger than  convictions. This food is unique and cannot be made at home. I've yet to find a place like it.  Definitely going back\n\n\nUpdate: after going vegan, this has become one of mine and my wife's favorite vegan places to eat. Many options, all savory and delectable, will have you curious to try more. Without regret tonight I deiscovered my favorite: the Chana Masala with roti and basmati rice.   Amazing.

I will say though, when I took this home for leftovers and had it the next day, it was spicier - maybe the spices didn't come through right after cooking but the next day it was packed with flavor. \n\nService:\nReally really really slow. They were nice but I think they were just understaffed and the place was mostly full. It took a really long time to get our order in and then it took even longer to get our food. We were definitely starving by the time our food came out. There was a couple next to us that actually just left because they were getting frustrated with the wait.\n\nOverall, not the best indian food I've ever had but there were some good dishes that made it an enjoyable experience.", "author": "Lisa D."}

It's a cute little restaurant and it seems like they have family seating in the back(?).\nFirst, we had the buffalo dumplings and they were really good.

Gorkha was my second experience with Himalayan, that all-important opportunity where life-long opinions are made. One bad experience with a new cuisine is bad luck, two, of course, is a pattern. I am happy to report that Gorkha was my third experience with Himalayan, as well as my fourth. This place is delicious.\n\nThe decor is really cool. Understated, but it's got a style to it. The staff were attentive and prompt, no doubt helped by the fact that the place is always weirdly empty. I always get the bullet naan. I can't even remember what's on it; all I know is the waiter brings it out, there's a hole in my memory, then it's all gone and I'm smiling. And y'know what, I'm perfectly happy with that.\n\nThe first time I went, I got...something. I don't remember because my dining partner got the chicken biryani. I tried that and immediately forgot what I ordered. I remember my own dish being good, but the biryani was incredible. It was a delicious mix of rice, countless herbs and spices, tender chicken, and a spicy mystery sauce that sealed the whole thing together perfectly. I always ask for another serving or two of the sauce before I leave.\n\nThey've got a pretty classy-looking wine bar too, but I still think Franzia is palatable so I am absolutely not the person to comment on that.\n\nIn summary, delicious food, reasonable dinner prices, great service, and a huge menu full of delicious-sounding things.

And the spinach with the toasted cumin seeds was delicious. I'm fussy about eating meat, and the chicken tasted of good quality. Somewhere else on the menu I saw that they served organic chicken. \n\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars is because the bathroom was absolutely disgusting filthy. It looked as though it had not been cleaned in a year. It was worse than some gas station bathrooms in which I've been.

He was hesitant to try it, because the windows were blacked out and he could not see inside. Would he be eating alone, or was it full of satisfied diners?\n\nWe decided to bite the bullet and give them a try. I was glad to see there were many other people eating here with us. We were greeted warmly and escorted to a table. If you dine in the very back of the restaurant, you can sit low to the floor on cushions.\n\nI was expecting a straight Indian restaurant from how my friend described it. No, they also serve Himalayan/Nepalese food here. And that's a good thing.\n\nLooking at the menu, we started with the Buff Momo. Then we ordered the Half Moon Bay Salmon Tikka, Goat Biryani, and a garlic naan.\n\nIf you like pot stickers, you will love the Buff Momo. The big difference is that these are stuffed with buffalo meat, and served with a side of sesame chutney. I really liked it. I'm not sure if it tasted better with or without the chutney. Try it and decide for yourself.\n\nThe Goat Biryani came with ample portion of rice. The meat was rather bony, but what was there was very tender. We were both hoping for boneless chunks of goat.\n\nThe garlic naan was excellent. Just a little crispy, without being doughy.\n\nI was really looking forward to the Salmon Tikka, which was cooked in a tandoor. It's one of my favorite Indian dishes if cooked well. But this was disappointing. There was a good portion of fish on the plate, but that was about it. The salmon was definitely overcooked and a little on the dry side. Some of the vegetables on the platter were more than a little burnt on the edges too. \n\nI love the blackened onions which stick to the bottom of the metal platter when I order fajitas. Given the condition of the vegetables, I was expecting to pick off a lot of them. But there were only a few onions like that to scrape off.\n\nService was excellent, their staff were very friendly.", "author": "The Bottomless Pi T."}

Their menu is a mix of Indian and Himalayan dishes, including curries, momo dumplings, tandoori meats (and cauliflower), and rice dishes like biryani. Peruse the appetizer menu for some unique dishes. We called them up for takeout and they were very professional and friendly. Prompt order processing and well within the estimated time frame.\n\nBecause we're crazy for momos, we ordered their momo chili with chicken, buff momo of Mahaboudha (buffalo), and sakahari (vegetable) momo (6 nicely sized momos per order). We also got some curries on the side (no rice included--you'd have to order it separately). The chili momo is likely deep fried and doused in their sweet, tangy chili sauce--a bit too similar to a sweet and sour sauce for our liking, but the filling was generous, chivey and herbal. The buffalo momos are good for carnivores because they're pretty much just packed with meat, and contain the rich, juicy flavors you'd expect from buffalo. The veggie momos contained spinach, herbs, and paneer.\n\nAs far as the curries go, they are creamy, aromatic and not overly spicy, and generous with the fillings (e.g., goat meat, tofu). The Gorkha goat curry is a tomato and onion based curry, similar to a rogan josh curry, and the meat practically fell off the bone. The saag tofu curry had some heat and the tofu comes crisped.\n\nOverall, a good experience. There are cheaper options for Indian food in the Sunset, but Gorkha creates a bit more ambiance and is worth experiencing for some classics made with quality as well as unique dishes.", "author": "Jade V."}

From students/residents/doctors at UCSF to neighbors that grew up in The Sunset (myself included), it was a fun evening getting to try new food and meet new friends.  The generous owner even offered a special 3-course grand opening tasting for only $8!  It was the first time I had a chicken momo (reminds me of a XLB) and it was delicious!!  Each tasting came with 2 entrees (4 to choose from), along with rice and naan, ending the evening with dessert (2 to choose from).  Everything was tasty with the perfect amount of heat/spices given that I cannot take spicy.  I appreciated the offerings of not only quality organic meats but also the fresh taste on the vegetarian dishes as well.  I couldn't stop eating the tofu saag, I usually like my poultry but that was probably my favorite entree that evening. \n\nNot only were the prices great, but we left very full with food still left on the table.  It was a very satisfying meal and if you picked up a flier on your way out, there's a 25% off coupon for your next visit. :)\n\nAside from the usual table/chairs seating...towards the right hand back corner of the restaurant, there's also floor seating with comfy pillows and cushions where you take off your shoes.  We got to sit in this part of the room and it was fun!  Met a lot of new friends sitting in the same area, we chatted while waiting for our food.  The owner shared with us that this is more of a traditional Northern style and it's great, really brings family and friends together.   \n\nThe owner himself was overwhelmed with the outpouring support.  While most customers waited patiently to be seated or get their food/bill, some had tired looks on the faces.  I'm sure the special pricing drew a lot of attention with the crowd and while dinner service was a bit longer than usual, it was expected for the first night.  The owner and staff were all hustling, doing their best to make sure things were running smoothly.  They were very apologetic and the owner himself came over several times to each table to check on everyone.  That's very commendable given that I overheard him say they ran out of food twice already in the course of the day.  However, he kept going and making sure his supplies got replenished yet with the utmost quality of food.  \n\nI got a chance to look at their regular menu as well and am excited to come back and try other things on the menu.

Really good. By this time the host had come by and had a pleasant conversation with us, let us try a little of the Chardonnay he had in stock, and made sure everything was okay. Nice guy. I ordered a Pino Noir (I think?) that had a bit of spice to it, not too much tannin, and went really well with the dumplings.\n\nWe finished our night with an entree chicken platter (I think they described it as \"a common Nepalese dish\") which was similar to Indian meals I've had but beautifully presented and with really unique and subtle flavors.\n\nThe host overheard that a friend of ours would be visiting Nepal, and commented that he would be happy to offer some suggestions \"better than Lonely Planet's.\" I believe him.\n\nWill definitely come back for more.", "author": "Abe D."}

One member of our party has a problem with too much spice.  As everyone knows, no two people's terminology will work for both parties; what's \"mild\" and what's \"medium\"? For those who try the delicious chicken momos, Nisha called them \"mild,\" and for me they were. For our friend they were at the edge of her tolerance! When we chatted with Nisha about that, she said that with the exception of the Tandoor items, anything on the menu could be customized to taste, and she seemed totally capable of figuring out where on the \"heat scale\" a patron was.\n\nWarning: if you order for \"family style,\" make sure YOU are all in agreement before you order! :)\n\nAnother thing to note is that the portions are generous.

It has replaced Curry Village, which was a good Indian restaurant at the outset, but was killed by the indifference of the owners, and their poor health scores.\n\nWe've been talking about trying Gorka, so we finally did last weekend.  I'd like to report it was good but, alas, it was mediocre at best. On Saturday evening, around 7:00PM, it was pretty crowded, but we got a table. In general the staff was nice, but clearly they are not well-versed in service skills. After we ordered we sat and waited for 45 minutes, not a moment less, for our food. Not once did a staff member come over to offer us anything at all while we waited, nor did they speak to us at all.  Finally, I told one of them that we'd been waiting 45 minutes, and a minute later the food came out.\n\nWe had Saag Paneer, which was very good, and definitely the best order we received.  Garlic nan was just so-so.  The goat curry and lamb rogan josh both lacked any discernible flavor.  Neither was \"bad\", but neither was at all memorable.  \n\nConsidering the ridiculous wait, the rather clueless staff, and the lack of flavor in the food, we will not be returning.

Water served was also lukewarm.\n\nOrdered the chicken momo, dal platter, and garlic naan, which seemed to be popular from the pics. This took awhile to come out- again not in a rush so didn't mind it as much. Chicken momo was good. Haven't had dumplings in an Indian restaurant before. The dal platter was disappointing however. We only finished the rice (with curry that we ordered later on) and the chicken side. The greens and beans? Curry on the platter was still half full when we left. \n\nWe still felt unsatisfied so we decided to order a butter chicken curry to go with the rest of the naan and rice. This came out a lot faster than expected. It was okay but was not the best butter chicken I've had. They offered complimentary rice refills which was nice.\n\nHowever towards the end of the meal, our stomach wasn't feeling that great and we regret getting that butter chicken afterwards.

Victor G. is right in that this place is mainly Indian, other than the momos, which we didn't try. The flavors here are strong, and the chicken is tender, albeit a little salty. The chicken 65 is a great appetizer reminiscent of a chicken curry with larger chunks of meat and outside of the normal bowl of curry. Garlic naan is slightly on the bland side, and masala's are heavy. Service is a little on the slow side, even on a Sunday afternoon. I do feel a little bad for these guys.

Hard to tell if the ingredients were raw or not since there's a lot of sauce in the dumplings. I ate one entire dumpling and my partner ate half of one until we realized the dumplings were not cooked thoroughly. There was another review that noted that their momo appetizer was undercooked or raw as well. Maybe the feedback hasn't gotten back to the cooks.\n\nHad the spicy chicken appetizer and was not overly impressed. We ended up throwing it away after a few bites. Sauce tasted like there was a lot of tabasco.\n\nAlso ordered the aloo gobi and chicken vindaloo. Both were decent but there are better renditions of the dishes in other Indian restaurants in town.

A nice, surprisingly upscale ambiance, excellent food with numerous, clearly-labeled vegan options (plenty of non-vegan options as well), and reasonable rates. Yes, yes, and yes. So happy to have been introduced to this place by a friend. Here are some details of our visit:\n\nStarters - They bring out a plate of papadam with a couple of dipping sauces. From the sauces I already knew this was going to be a great meal - the best tamarind sauce I've had in a while.\n\nAppetizers - Samosas: crispy, but not oily, flavorful without being overwhelming. These were excellent.\n\nMains - Tofu Sag: My favorite Indian dish before becoming a vegan was paneer sag ... I have since eschewed it in lieu of sag daal or other variations and have found some good ones, but nothing that compares with this. It is not only the best sag I've had since becoming a vegan, it is the best sag I've ever had, period. The stuff of dreams. If you like spinach, you must get this dish.\n\nChow Mein Kathmandu Style: I did not expect this at a \"Indian\" restaurant and so we thought we'd give it a try. This dish was good, but nothing special. The seasoning was light, and would appeal to those who like more delicate flavors. However, in my opinion it could have done with more vegetables.\n\nSide: Roti: The roti did not disappoint and was an excellent accompaniment to the sag.\n\nService: Very attentive and friendly. Great staff.\n\nAtmosphere: Nice. Much better than the prices would suggest and certainly a step up in comparison with most \"Indian\" restaurants. You could dress up and bring a date here (though we were perfectly comfortable in street clothes).\n\n* Note: I put \"Indian\" in quotation marks because this is technically a Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant, but many of the dishes overlap with those found in Indian restaurants which will be more familiar to most readers.", "author": "Candan S."}

There was another restaurant across the street, but this one was only one with true vegan options. The decor was beautiful and I loved the signage and design of the entrance. The service was great. Our server, who seemed to be the lead, took great care of my friends and I. We ordered a little of everything and even when we made a mistake the server was nice enough to take it back and replace the dish for us. The food was very good, even my friends were pleasantly surprised. My only complaint was the chana masla seemed a little undercooked. I like my chickpeas tender to the bite, almost like it melts in your mouth. That's just a personal preference, but other than that, everything else was on point. Definitely I will be revisiting this place whenever I'm around the area.", "author": "DeShaun W."}

The butter chicken melted in my mouth and it is organic and non GMO (owner even showed me!). Vegan dishes were spectacular and we can't wait to go back with our friends!!", "author": "Rebecca W."}

We ordered Butter chicken, Prawns curry, garlic naan, coconut madras rice, chicken Tikki Masala). Their hours are supposed to be from 11am, and we arrived at 11am, but they weren't ready to open until 11:15am because they still had to clean the floors and tables (from the night before?). Anyway, despite the little wait, food was delicious. Will come again and try something else.", "author": "Karen L."}

I was not hungry but when I saw this new restaurant, I wanted to give a try and tried their Kathmandu style chowmein and momo. Chowmein was delicious and less oily. momo was juicy and liked their momo's  chutney. Staffs are friendly and very knowledgeable, excellent ambience with soft music on background. Perfect place for date. I would definitely go back with my friends and family and highly recommend this place.", "author": "Aj K."}

Everyone I've brought here has loved it, and it quickly became my favorite indian restaurant in the city. Most of the waiters and staff are friendly also, and very hospitable. The vibe in the restaurant is also great!", "author": "Jessie K."}

We've been multiple times since it opened and everything has been delicious. Complex, fresh flavors in every dish we've tried, nothing too heavy, lots of vegetarian options, and the right amount of spice. Don't miss the vegetarian momos or the dal bhat tarkari platter. The cowherd kheer (Himalayan rice pudding) for dessert is a delight.", "author": "Kate S."}

I can't remember the last time I've been to a restaurant where the staff was so thoughtful. They don't have beer/wine yet but we brought our own wine, no corking fee. The gorkha chili chicken appetizer and baingan bharta were my favorites. Highly recommend!!", "author": "Mary M."}

Food served was hot and a pleasant dining affair. Gorkha staff wears symbol of 2 knives (Kukri) on their hats and which is quite a traditional.", "author": "Nisarg G."}
